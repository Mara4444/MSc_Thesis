Now, let's consider the next question - How many Saturdays are there in those 14 days? There are 3 Saturdays (July 8, July 15, and July 22).So, the total number of days that are neither Friday nor Saturday is 7 (July 9, July 10, July 11, July 16, July 17, July 18, and July 19). Therefore, the answer is 7.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in July. As per the question, there are 31 days in July. Now, let's calculate the number of days left after the current date (July 17) till August 15. There are 28 days left. Finally, we need to add the number of days left and the current date to find out the next date that falls on or after August 15. So, the answer is August 20.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that July has 31 days and August has 31 days as well. So, in total, they have 62 days. Now, let's calculate how many times 15, 18, and 97 can fit into these 62 days: 15 x 4 = 60 days 18 x 3 = 54 days 97 x 1 = 97 days As we can see, only 97 days can fit exactly into those 62 days. Therefore, the answer is 97.;
Response:  In July, there are 30 days. So, in 30 days, Ompathy will have 30 x 4 = 120 candies.  In August, there are 31 days. So, in 31 days, Ompathy will have 31 x 4 = 124 candies. Therefore, the total number of candies that Ompathy will have is 120 + 124 = 244 candies.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between two dates given in the question.  The first date is July 2 and the second date is August 14. So, the difference between these two dates is 12 days. Now, we need to find out how many times 12 falls into the gap of 16 days. To do this, we divide 12 by 16.  We get 0.75. Therefore, the number of times 12 fits into 16 is 3 (since 3 x 12 = 36).  Finally, we multiply the number of times 12 fits into 16 with the number of days between the two dates to get the total number of times the month of July appears in the gap of 16 days.  Multiplying 3 with 12 gives us 36. So, the answer is 36.;

Response:  Bob has 25 apples and he gives 4 of them to Alice. Now, Bob has 21 apples left. If Bob had 43 cents in his piggy bank before giving any apple to Alice, how much money does Bob have now? So, the answer is 43 - 4 = 39 cents.;
Response:  Bobi has 28 cars and 42 employees. If he has 63 chocolates, then he must have more than one box of chocolates. So, let's assume that he has x boxes of chocolates. Now, we know that each box contains 10 pieces of chocolate, so the total number of chocolates Bobi has is 63/x. Since Bobi has 28 cars, he must have at least 28/x cars per box of chocolates. Therefore, the minimum number of boxes of chocolates Bobi can have is (28/x)/(63/x) = x/63. Hence, Bobi has at least x/63 boxes of chocolates.;
Response:  Bobi has 33 coins and gives 14 of them to Naala. So, Bobi now has 19 coins left (33 - 14 = 19). Now, Bobi wants to give some more coins to Naala. If Bobi gives 7 more coins to Naala, then how many coins will Bobi have left after giving 7 coins to Naala?  Solution:  After giving 7 coins to Naala, Bobi will have 12 coins left (19 - 7 = 12).;
Response:  Bob has 38 marbles and gives away 16 of them to Charlie. So, Bob now has 22 marbles left (38 - 16 = 22). Now, if we assume that each chocolate contains 4 marbles, then Bob had 50 chocolates (22 / 4 = 50) before giving any to Charlie. After giving 16 marbles to Charlie, Bob now has 34 chocolates left (50 - 16 = 34).;
Response:  Bobi has 20 apples and gives 34 to Avni. So, Bobi now has 16 apples left (20 - 34 = 16). Now, Avni has 34 apples. If Avni had 18 apples initially, then she will have 52 apples after getting 34 from Bobi (18 + 34 = 52). Therefore, Bobi has 16 - 52 = -36 more apples than Avni.;
Response:  Bob has 21 marbles and gives away 5 of them to someone else. Now he has 16 marbles left with him. If Ompathy takes all the remaining 16 marbles from Bob, then Ompathy will have 16 + 5 = 21 marbles in total. So, the answer is 21.;
Response:  Bob has 22 marbles and gives 4 to Alice. So, Bob now has 18 marbles left. Then, he gives another 3 marbles to Charlie. Now, Bob has 15 marbles left. Finally, he gives 2 more marbles to David. So, Bob now has 13 marbles left with him. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.;
Response:  Bob has 19 apples and gives 2 to Alice. So, Bob now has 17 apples (19 - 2 = 17). Now, Bob gives one apple to each of his two children, Emily and Ryan, who have 3 and 4 apples respectively. So, after giving an apple to each child, Bob now has 15 apples left (17 - 1 = 15), and Emily has 4 apples, and Ryan has 3 apples.;
Response:  Bob has 32 kg of chocolate and he wants to share it equally among 5 people. So, each person will get 6.4 kg of chocolate (32/5). Now, Bob has 17.6 kg of chocolate left (32 - 6.4 = 17.6). If he gives 20 kg of chocolate to one more person, then he will have 7.6 kg of chocolate left (17.6 - 20 = 7.6).;
Response:  Bob has 17 marbles and gives away 15 of them to someone else. So, he now has 2 marbles left with him. If he had 36 marbles initially, then after giving away 15 marbles, he would have 24 marbles left (36 - 15 = 24). But since he gave away 15 marbles, he must have had 36 marbles initially. Therefore, the correct answer is 36.;
Response:  Bobi has 23 apples and gives 15 to his friend. Now he has 7 apples left. If he gives another 5 apples to someone else, then he will have 2 apples left. So, the final number of apples Bobi will have is 2.;
Response:  Jayakumar has 5 balls and wants to give 3 of them to Parvathy. So, he will have 2 balls left after giving 3 balls to Parvathy.;
Response:  Jayakumar has 2 balls and wants to give one ball each to three of his friends. So, he will have 2 - 3 = -1 balls left after giving away the balls. Now, let's consider Alana's case. She has 4 balls and wants to give one ball each to two of her friends. So, she will have 4 - 2 = 2 balls left after giving away the balls. Therefore, Jayakumar has fewer balls than Alana.;
Response:  We have 3 balls and we need to divide them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 1 ball. Now, there are 2 balls left, which means that 2 people will get 1 ball each. Finally, there is one ball left, which means that one person will get it. Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  We have 6 balls and we need to choose 4 of them such that Alan does not get any ball twice. So, there are 6C4 = 15 ways to choose the 4 balls. Now, out of these 15 choices, how many of them will leave Alan with no ball? Well, if we choose 4 balls randomly from the remaining 2 balls (i.e., without choosing the 4 already chosen), then the probability of Alan getting at least one ball is 2/3. Therefore, the probability of Alan NOT getting any ball is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3. So, the answer is 1/3.;
Response:  We have 5 balls and we want to know how many of them are red. So, if there is one red ball among the 5 balls, then the probability that the next ball is also red is 1/5. If there are no red balls in the first 4 balls, then the probability that the fifth ball is red is (4/5) × (1/5) = 1/25. Therefore, the total number of red balls among the 5 balls is 1 + 1/25 = 6/25.;
Response:  We have 3 balls of Almond and 5 balls of Jayakkus.  Now we want to know how many balls of almond will be left after giving 2 balls of jayakku to each of the three children. So, total number of balls of almond that are given = 3 x 2 = 6 balls.  Number of balls of almond remaining = Total number of balls of almond - Number of balls of almond given = 3 - 6 = -3 balls. Therefore, there will be -3 balls of almond left after giving 2 balls of jayakku to each of the three children.;
Response:  We have two balls - one red and one blue.  Jayakumar has 4 balls in total. He gives 3 of them to Alann. So, now Jayakumar has 1 ball left (blue). Therefore, the answer is 1.;
Response:  We have 2 balls in one bowl and 6 balls in another bowl. After mixing them together, there are 9 balls in total. Now, we take out 3 balls from the mixed bowl and leave it with 6 balls. So, the number of balls left in Jayakumar's bowl is 6.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 balls in Alana's basket and 4 balls in Jayakumar's basket. So, the total number of balls is 5 + 4 = 9. Now, we need to find out how many balls are left with Alana after she gives 3 balls to Jayakumar. Therefore, the number of balls left with Alana is 9 - 3 = 6.;
Response:  Jayakumar has 6 balls in one basket and 2 balls in another basket. After shuffling, he has 3 balls in one basket and none in the other basket. So, there are 3 more balls in the first basket than in the second basket. Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  Jayakumar has 6 balls in one hand and 3 balls in another hand. So he has total of 9 balls with him. Now, out of these 9 balls, 4 balls are blue colored. Therefore, there are 5 red colored balls left (9 - 4 = 5).;
Response:  Firstly, there are 5 balls in Jayakumar's hand and he throws 2 of them away. So now, there are 5 - 2 = 3 balls left in his hand. Then, he gives 1 ball to each of the 4 people, so now there are 3 - 4 = 0 balls left with him. Therefore, the number of balls that Jayakumar has after giving one ball to each of the 4 people is 0.;
Response:  We have 3 balls of size A, which are red, blue and green. Each ball has a volume of 1 cubic meter. Now we add 20 small balls of size B, each with a volume of 0.1 cubic meters. So, the total volume of all the balls is: Volume = 3 x 1 m^3 + 20 x 0.1 m^3 = 3.1 m^3 Next, we take away 5 big balls of size C, each with a volume of 2 cubic meters. So, the remaining volume after removing the 5 big balls is: Remaining volume = Total volume - 5 x 2 m^3 = 3.1 m^3 - 10 m^3 = 6.9 m^3 Finally, we add 5 more small balls of size D, each with a volume of 0.05 cubic meters. So, the new total volume including the additional small balls is: New total volume = Remaining volume + 5 x 0.05 m^3 = 6.9 m^3 + 0.25 m^3 = 7.15 m^3 Therefore, there are 7.15 cubic meters of balls in the container.;
Response:  We have 7 balls and 5 bolts. So, we can make 7 x 5 = 35 combinations. Now, we have 6 balls and 4 bolts. So, we can make 6 x 4 = 24 combinations. Therefore, there are 35 + 24 = 59 combinations in total.;
Response:  We know that Alana has 6 balls and Jayakumar wants to give her 7 more balls. So, in total, Alana will have 6 + 7 = 13 balls.;
Response:  Firstly, there are 2 balls in one basket and 3 balls in another basket. So, the total number of balls is 2 + 3 = 5. Now, there are 6 baskets in total. Therefore, the number of balls in each basket is 6 / 6 = 1. So, there is one ball in each basket.;
Response:  We know that  OR is equal to 10 and R is equal to 5. So, we can write it as follows:  OR = 10 and R = 5. Now, let's calculate the sum of both numbers: 10 + 5 = 15. Therefore, the answer is 15.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 manikandams in England and 7 chinmaya missions in Kerala. So, if we have to calculate how many more manikands are needed for each chinmaya mission in Kerala, we need to divide the number of chinmaya missions by the number of manikands in England.  Therefore, the required number of additional manikands needed for each chinmaya mission in Kerala is:  Number of Chinmaya Missions in Kerala = 7  Number of Manikands in England = 6  Required Additional Manikands per Chinmaya Mission in Kerala = Number of Chinmaya Missions in Kerala / Number of Manikands in England = 7 / 6 = 1.17  So, approximately 1.17 additional manikands are needed for each chinmaya mission in Kerala.;
Response:  We know that 3 manikandus can fit in one Englishman's ship, and 4 manikandus can fit in one Englishman's ship after some of them have been removed. So, to find out how many manikandus can fit in one Englishman's ship after all of them have been removed, we need to subtract 4 from 3, which gives us 1. Therefore, after all of them have been removed, 1 manikandu can fit in one Englishman's ship.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 manikandams in England and Rayan has visited all of them. So, he must have visited at least 7 manikands in total. Now, we are asked how many more manikands Rayan would visit if he visits only the remaining 5 manikands in England. Therefore, the difference between the number of manikands Rayan visited (7) and the number of manikands he will visit after completing his journey (12) is 5. Hence, the answer is 5.;
"Response:  We know that there are 5 manikuru in one chenesi and 10 chenesisi in one rayan. So, we can calculate the number of manikurus in one rayan as follows:
Number of manikurs in one rayan = Number of chenesisis in one rayan x Number of manikurs in one chenesi
= 5 x 10
= 50
Therefore, there are 50 manikurs in one rayan.";
"Response:  We know that there are 12 days in a month and we have to find out how many months it will take for Oraro to complete his journey of 720 days. So, we can start counting from day 13 (since the first day is already passed) and count till day 720. Therefore, the number of months required for Oraro to complete his journey is:

$$ \therefore \text {Number of months} = \frac{\text{Total days}}{\text{Days in a month}} = \frac{720}{\daysinamonth} $$

Now, we need to find out how many days are there in a month. There are 30 days in April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, January, February, March. So, the total number of days in a year is:

$$ \therefore \text{Total days in a year} = \sum_{month=1}^{12} \daysinamonth = 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 365 $$

So, now we can calculate the number of years required for Oraro to complete his journey:

$$ \therefore \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Total days}}{\text{Days in a year}} = \frac{720}{\daysinyear} $$

Therefore, the answer is $720 / 365 \approx 2$ years.";
Response:  We know that  OR has 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, there are 7 x 24 = 168 hours in a week. Now, we need to find out how many hours Rayan can work in a month. As per the question, he works for 6 months continuously, so the total number of working hours in 6 months is 6 x 43 = 258 hours. Therefore, the remaining hours after deducting the working hours from the total number of hours in a week are: 168 - 258 = -90 hours. Since negative numbers are not possible here, the answer is 0 hours.;
Response:  We know that  OR has 7 days in a week and RN has 5 manikurs (days) in a week. So, if we have to calculate how many manikurs are there in 4 weeks of RN, we can multiply 5 with 4, which gives us 20 manikurs. Now, let's see what happens when we add 6 more manikurs to this calculation. If we add 6 more manikurs to 20, it will give us 26 manikurs. Therefore, the correct answer is 26 manikurs.;
Response:  We know that  OR has 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, there are 7 x 24 = 168 hours in a week. Now, we need to find out how many hours OR spends on diving, studying, and working.  For diving, we know that OR can dive for 4 minutes per hour. So, if he dives for 86 days, he will spend (86 x 4) = 332 minutes on diving.  For studying, we know that OR studies for 4 hours per day. So, if he studies for 86 days, he will spend (86 x 4) = 332 hours on studying.  For work, we don't have any information about the number of hours OR works per day or per week. However, we know that he works for 6 months, which is equal to 26 weeks. If he works for 8 hours per day, then he will spend (26 x 8) = 208 hours on work during those 6 months. Therefore, the total number of hours OR spends on diving, studying, and working is: 332 + 332 + 208 = 872 hours.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, total number of hours in a week is 7 x 24 = 168 hours. Now, we need to calculate how many hours are spent in each activity - studying, working, sleeping, and entertainment.  For studying, let's assume an average time of 4 hours per day (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, total number of hours spent on studying in a week is 4 x 7 = 28 hours. Similarly, for work, let's assume an average time of 9 hours per day (also as mentioned in the question). Thus, total number of hours spent on work in a week is 9 x 7 = 63 hours. Sleeping time varies from person to person, but let's assume an average time of 8 hours per night (which is quite reasonable). Therefore, total number of hours spent on sleeping in a week is 8 x 7 = 56 hours. Finally, for entertainment, let's assume an average time of 4 hours per day (again, based on the given information). Hence, total number of hours spent on entertainment in a week is 4 x 7 = 28 hours.  Adding all these values together gives us a grand total of 168 + 63 + 56 + 28 = 305 hours. So, out of the 168 hours available in a week, our character spends approximately 305 hours on various activities.;
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in 6 months. There are 30 days in each month, so total number of days in 6 months is:

30 x 6 = 180 days

Now, let's find out how many days are there in 58 weeks. Each week has 7 days, so total number of days in 58 weeks is:

7 x 58 = 409 days

Now, let's subtract the number of days in 6 months from the number of days in 58 weeks:

409 - 180 = 229 days

So, the remaining days after deducting the number of days in 6 months from the number of days in 58 weeks are 229 days.";
Response:  We know that there are 7 manikandams in England and each manikandam has 4 spacious rooms. So, the total number of spacious rooms in England is 7 x 4 = 28. Now, we are asked how many more spacious rooms are there in India compared to England. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of spacious rooms in India from the number of spacious rooms in England. According to the question, there are 4 manikandams in India and each manikandam has 3 spacious rooms. So, the total number of spacious rooms in India is 4 x 3 = 12. Therefore, the difference between the number of spacious rooms in India and England is 28 - 12 = 16.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, total number of hours in a week is 7 x 24 = 168 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours are spent on different activities like work, study, sleep etc. Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate it as follows:  Work hours per day = 8 hours (as mentioned in the question) x 7 days/week = 56 hours/week Study hours per day = 5 hours (as mentioned in the question) x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week Sleep hours per night = 8 hours (as mentioned in the question) x 7 nights/week = 56 hours/week Total hours spent on different activities = Work hours + Study hours + Sleep hours = 56 hours/week + 35 hours/week + 56 hours/week = 147 hours/week Therefore, based on the calculation above, the person spends approximately 147 hours/week on different activities.;
Response:  We know that 3 people can sit in one row (chanting or not chanting). So, if there are 3 rows of people, then total number of people = 3 x 3 = 9. Now, we have to subtract the number of people who are not chanting, which is 2. Therefore, total number of people who are chanting = 9 - 2 = 7.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 days in a month and we have to divide it into two parts - English classes and Chinese classes.  For English classes, we need to divide 30 days (which is the total number of days in a month) by 4, which gives us 7.5 days for each part. So, we can have 7.5 days of English classes per week. Similarly, for Chinese classes, we need to divide 30 days by 5, which gives us 6 days for each part. So, we can have 6 days of Chinese classes per week. Therefore, the answer is 7.5 days for English classes and 6 days for Chinese classes.;
Response:  We know that Tifanny resold 8 bags of coffee to Kanan and lost $20 in the process. So, she gained $20 - $20 = $0. Now, we are asked how many bags of coffee Kanan bought from Tifanny during their last meeting. According to the passage, Kanan bought 7 bags of coffee from Tifanny during their last meeting. Therefore, the answer is (7).;
Response:  We know that Tifanny has 7 bags of rice and she wants to give 12 bags of rice as gift. So, we need to find out how many bags of rice Tifanny will have after giving away 5 bags of rice. Now, let's calculate it:  Number of bags of rice Tifanny has = 7 - 5 = 2 bags of rice. Therefore, Tifanny will have 2 bags of rice left after giving away 5 bags of rice.;
Response:  We know that Tifanny has 4 bags of rice and she wants to give one bag to each of her 4 friends. So, she will have 3 bags of rice left after giving away one bag to each friend. Now, if she gives another bag to Kanan, then she will have only 2 bags of rice left. Therefore, the number of bags of rice Tifanny will have after giving another bag to Kanan is 2.;
Response:  We know that Tifanny has 4 bags of chocolates and she gave one to her friend. So, there are 3 bags left with Tifanny. Now, we need to find out how many bags of chocolates Tifanny's friend got from her. Since Tifanny had 4 bags of chocolates initially, and she gave one bag to her friend, then her friend must have received 1/4th of the total number of bags of chocolates that Tifanny had. Therefore, Tifanny's friend received 3/4th of the total number of bags of chocolates that Tifanny had, which is 3 bags. So, the final answer is 3 bags.;
Response:  We know that Tifan has 10 bags of rice and he gave away 3 bags in the first division. So, he has 7 bags left with him. Now, we are asked how many more bags Tifan will have after giving away another 7 bags. Therefore, the answer is 7 + 7 = 14 bags.;
Response:  We know that  Tarini has 8 bags of rice and she wants to distribute them equally among 10 people. So, each person will get 1 bag of rice. Now, we are asked how many bags of rice Tarini will have after distributing 4 bags to someone else. Since she already has 8 bags, if she gives away 4 more bags, she will be left with 8 - 4 = 4 bags of rice. Therefore, the answer is 4 bags of rice.;
Response:  We know that Tifanny has 3 bags of rice and she wants to give 1 bag to each of her 7 friends. So, total number of bags of rice Tifanny will give is 7 x 1 = 7 bags. Now, we are asked how many more bags of rice Tifanny will have after giving away all these 7 bags. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of bags Tifanny gave away (7) from the total number of bags she had (3 + 44 = 47). Therefore, Tifanny will have 47 - 7 = 40 bags of rice left after giving away all 7 bags to her friends.;
Response:  We have 17 chuvannas and 16 pacchas. To find out how many more chuvannas are there than pacchas, we need to subtract the number of pacchas from the total number of chuvannas. So, 17 - 16 = 1. Therefore, there is one more chuvanna than paccha.;
Response:  We have 5 big elephants and 11 small elephants in total. Now we need to find out how many small elephants are there for every big elephant.

So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 people who cannot solve math problems well.;
Response:  We have 7 chuvannas (cups) of water and we need to distribute it among 15 people. So, each person will get 1/2 cup of water (7/15). Now, we have 8 pacchas (pots) of water left over after distributing it among 15 people. So, each pot contains 8/15 = 0.53 cups of water. Therefore, the remaining amount of water in the pots is 8 - 0.53 = 7.47 cups.;
Response:  We have 7 chuvannas (7 x 3 = 21) and 71 pachchas (71 / 5 = 14). So, there are 21 + 14 = 35 pachchas in total. Now, we need to find out how many pachchas are left after subtracting the number of chuvannas from the total number of pachchas. Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Total number of pachchas - Number of chuvannas = 35 - 7 = 28 pachchas. So, there are 28 pachchas remaining after subtracting the number of chuvannas from the total number of pachchas.;
Response:  We have 3 groups of penguins - 2 large ones with 6 penguins each and 1 small one with 4 penguins. So, in total we have 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 penguins. Therefore, there are 12 penguins in the group that includes both large and small penguins.;
Response:  We have 30 chuvannas (19 + 11 + 12). Now we need to find out how many of them are less than 5. So, we can say that among these 30 chuvannas, 11 are less than 5. Therefore, the answer is 11.;
Response:  We have 6 chuvannas (30 days) and 90 pachchas (days). So, total number of days = 6 x 30 = 180 days. Now, we need to find out how many days are left after subtracting 16 pachchas from 180 days. Therefore, remaining days = 180 - 16 = 164 days. Hence, there are 164 days in the given period.;
Response:  We have 3 groups of people - 18 youngsters, 14 oldies and 17 kids. Now, we need to find out how many pairs are there in each group.  Youngsters (18): Pairs = 18 / 2 = 9 Oldies (14): Pairs = 14 / 2 = 7 Kids (17): Pairs = 17 / 2 = 8 Therefore, there are 9 pairs of youngsters, 7 pairs of oldies and 8 pairs of kids.;
Response:  We have 5 big dogs and 14 medium-sized dogs.  Each of these medium-sized dogs has 6 puppies. So, we have 14 x 6 = 84 small dogs in total. Now, let's consider the large dogs. Since there are 5 large dogs, each with 3 puppies, we have 5 x 3 = 15 small dogs from them as well. Therefore, the total number of puppies is 84 + 15 = 99 puppies.;
Response:  We know that there are 65 boxes of fruits and vegetables in total. Out of these, 30 boxes contain apples, 20 boxes contain oranges, and 15 boxes contain bananas. So, the number of boxes containing each fruit is as follows: Apples - 30 boxes, Oranges - 20 boxes, Bananas - 15 boxes. Therefore, the total number of boxes containing all three fruits together is 30 + 20 + 15 = 65 boxes.;
Response:  We know that there are 20 children in total - 10 boys and 10 girls. Now, we need to find out how many of them have blue eyes. So, let's count the number of blue-eyed children: Blue-eyed children = Number of boys with blue eyes + Number of girls with blue eyes  Boys with blue eyes = 10/2 = 5 girls with blue eyes = 10/2 = 5 Therefore, there are 5 blue-eyed children in this group.;
Response:  We know that there are 16 small balls and 18 big balls in total. So, the number of small balls is less than or equal to 18 - 16 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 small balls left after using all the big balls.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 small balls and 2 big balls in the container. So, the total number of balls in the container is 10 + 2 = 12 balls. Therefore, the remaining ball(s) in the container would be 12 - 8 = 4 balls.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 big balls and 3 small balls in one container. So, the total number of balls is 4 + 3 = 7. Now, we have to find out how many small balls are left after taking out 7 balls from the container. Therefore, the answer is 7 - 7 = 0.;
Response:  We have 4 crows in one place and 3 crows in another place. So, total number of crows = 4 + 3 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 crows in both places combined.;
Response:  We know that there are 16 balls in total and we have already counted 13 red balls and 5 blue balls. So, the remaining ball must be green. Therefore, the answer is (A) Green.;
Response:  We have 19 crows and 4 pigeons. So, in total we have 19 + 4 = 23 birds. Now, if there are 15 kites flying above them, then each bird has to share (23 / 15) = 1.5 kites. Therefore, each crow or pigeon will have 1.5 kites flying above them.;
Response:  We have 10 coins in total and we need to distribute them equally among 4 children. So, each child will get 2.5 coins (10 / 4 = 2.5). Now, let's consider the remaining 6 coins. Since there are 6 children, each child will get 1 coin (6 / 6 = 1). Therefore, the final answer is: 4 + 6 = 10 coins.;
Response:  We have 6 big bags of rice and each bag contains 60 small bags of rice. So, in total we have 6 x 60 = 360 small bags of rice. Now, out of these 360 small bags, 2 are chawan (or large) bags. Therefore, the number of small bags left after removing the two chawan bags is 360 - 2 = 358 small bags.;
Response:  We have to find out how many fingers are there in 4 hands of Jerry. Since each hand has 5 fingers, we can say that there are 4 x 5 = 20 fingers in total. Now, we need to find out how many fingers Jerry has in his left hand. As per the question, Jerry has 4 fingers in his left hand. So, the number of fingers Jerry has in his left hand is 4. Therefore, the answer is 20 - 4 = 16 fingers.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 shelves in total and each shelf can hold 10 files. So, the total number of files that can be stored is 7 x 10 = 70 files. Now, we need to find out how many more files can be stored if there are additional 3 shelves. Since each additional shelf can hold 10 files, the total number of files that can be stored with additional 3 shelves is 3 x 10 = 30 files. Therefore, the final answer is 70 + 30 = 100 files.;
Response:  We have 4 boxes of fruits and 22 pieces of chocolates. Each box of fruit contains 3 apples, 2 oranges, and 1 banana. So, in total, we have 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 fruits per box. Now, each piece of chocolate is equal to half of a fruit. Therefore, the number of pieces of chocolate we have is 6 / 2 = 3. So, there are 3 pieces of chocolate for every 4 boxes of fruits.;
Response:  We have 5 fighters and 9 puppets. Each fighter can defeat 3 puppets at most. So, in total, we have 5 x 3 = 15 defeats. Now, each of the remaining 4 fighters (who did not fight) can defeat 3 more puppets, for a total of 4 x 3 = 12 additional defeats. Therefore, the total number of defeats is 15 + 12 = 27 defeats.;
Response:  We have to find out how many 5-digit numbers can be formed using the digits from 1 to 9 and repeating the digits as many times as possible.  Since there are 10 digits available, we can form 10 x 9 = 90 different 5-digit numbers.  Now, let's count the number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed using these 90 5-digit numbers.  Each 4-digit number can be formed in 4 ways (by selecting any one of the four digits). So, the total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed is 90 x 4 = 360. Therefore, the required number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed using the remaining 4 digits is 360 - 4 = 356.;
Response:  We have 8 acquisitions and 9 profit centers under one person's control. So, there are 8 x 9 = 72 possible combinations of acquisition and profit center. However, we can eliminate some of these combinations as follows:  * Acquisition 1 cannot be combined with Profit Center 1 because they belong to different departments (8 vs 9).  * Similarly, Acquisition 2 cannot be combined with Profit Center 2 because they belong to different departments (6 vs 7).  * Acquisition 3 cannot be combined with Profit Center 3 because they belong to different departments (5 vs 8).  Therefore, the remaining 4 combinations are:  Acquisition 1 + Profit Center 4, Acquisition 2 + Profit Center 5, Acquisition 3 + Profit Center 6, and Acquisition 4 + Profit Center 7. So, there is only one combination left that meets the condition - Acquisition 1 + Profit Center 4.;
Response:  We have 7 acquisitions and 2 puffs of air. Each puff of air can fill up to 4 shells. So, in total, we need 7 x 2 = 14 shells of air to fill all the 7 acquisitions. Therefore, there are 14 - 4 = 10 remaining shells of air after filling all the acquisitions.;
Response:  We have 5 fighters and 2 puppets. Each fighter can defeat at most 3 puppets in one round. So, total number of rounds required to defeat all 5 fighters = Total number of puppets / Number of fighters per round = 9 puppets / 3 fighters/round = 3 rounds. Now, let's calculate how many puppets each fighter will defeat in 3 rounds:  Fighter 1 : Defeats 3 puppets in Round 1 + Defeats 2 puppets in Round 2 + Defeats 1 puppet in Round 3 = 6 puppets defeated overall. Fighter 2 : Defeats 4 puppets in Round 1 + Defeats 3 puppets in Round 2 + Defeats 2 puppets in Round 3 = 9 puppets defeated overall. Fighter 3 : Defeats 5 puppets in Round 1 + Defeats 4 puppets in Round 2 + Defeats 3 puppets in Round 3 = 12 puppets defeated overall. Fighter 4 : Defeats 6 puppets in Round 1 + Defeats 5 puppets in Round 2 + Defeats 4 puppets in Round 3 = 15 puppets defeated overall. Fighter 5 : Defeats 7 puppets in Round 1 + Defeats 6 puppets in Round 2 + Defeats 5 puppets in Round 3 = 18 puppets defeated overall. Therefore, out of the remaining 9 puppets, 3 puppets will be left unbeaten after 3 rounds.;
Response:  We have to find out how many fighters are left after 8 fighters were removed from the army of 100 fighters. So, we need to subtract 8 from 100.  There will be 92 fighters left after removing 8 fighters. Now, we need to find out how many fighters are left after another 4 fighters were removed from the remaining 92 fighters. So, we need to subtract 4 from 92.  There will be 88 fighters left after removing 4 fighters from the remaining 92 fighters. Therefore, there are 88 fighters left in the army after the second removal of fighters.;
Response:  We have to find out how many shells are there in each of the three categories and then add them up.  Category 1 has 3 shells, category 2 has 4 shells, and category 3 has 5 shells. So, the total number of shells is : 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 shells. Therefore, there are 12 shells in all.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 shells in each box of fish. So, if we have 8 boxes of fish, then the total number of shells will be 7 x 8 = 56 shells. Now, out of these 56 shells, how many will the person get? Well, as per the question, the person gets one shell for every 7 fish they buy. So, to find out how many shells the person will get, we need to divide the total number of shells (56) by 7. Therefore, the person will get 56 / 7 = 8 shells.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 shells in Avanthi's purse. Each shell can hold 5 grains of rice. So, altogether, Avanthi has 50 grains of rice in her purse (10 shells x 5 grains per shell). Now, we need to find out how many more grains of rice Avanthi needs to have to fill up the remaining space in her purse. To do this, we subtract the number of grains she already has from the total capacity of her purse. The total capacity of Avanthi's purse is 100 grains (as mentioned in the question), and she already has 50 grains. Therefore, the difference between the total capacity and the number of grains she already has is 50 - 50 = 0 grains. So, Avanthi does not need any more grains of rice to fill up her purse.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 fighters in each group and each group has 10 puppets. So, the total number of fighters is 7 x 10 = 70. Now, we need to find out how many fighters are in each group. Since there are 7 groups, the total number of fighters in all the groups together is 7 x 70 = 490. Therefore, the number of fighters in each group is 490 / 7 = 68.;
Response:  We have 3 puzazzles and 4 fidget spinners. Each puzzle has 6 pieces, so we have a total of 18 pieces. Since there are only 4 fidget spinners, each one can spin at most 4 times (since it has 4 sides). So, in total, we have 18 + 4 = 22 rotations possible. Therefore, the answer is 22.;
Response:  We have 7 puzzle pieces and 3 empty spaces to fill in. Each puzzle piece has a unique shape, and we need to place them in the correct position to complete the picture. The shapes are as follows: Square (S), Circle (C), Triangle (T), Rectangle (R), Hexagon (H), Star (*), and Diamond (D). Now, let's analyze each possible combination of three pieces: SSSS - This combination can only be formed if two pieces are placed side by side, leaving one space for another piece. Therefore, there is only one possible arrangement: SSSS (Square-Square-Square) CCCC - In this case, all three pieces must be circles, so the arrangement is CCCC (Circle-Circle-Circle) TTTT - Similarly, all three pieces must be triangles, so the arrangement is TTTT (Triangle-Triangle-Triangle) RRRR - Here, all three pieces must be rectangles, so the arrangement is RRRR (Rectangle-Rectangle-Rectangle) HHHH - As all three pieces are hexagons, the arrangement is HHHH (Hexagon-Hexagon-Hexagon) ***** - If all three pieces are stars, then the arrangement is ***** (Star-Star-Star) DDDD - Finally, if all three pieces are diamonds, then the arrangement is DDDD (Diamond-Diamond-Diamond) So, out of these seven combinations, five of them contain at least one piece that cannot fit in any of the remaining two empty spaces. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting three pieces from the set of 7 puzzle pieces such that they can be arranged in a valid configuration is 5/7 or approximately 0.714.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 penguins in the first group and 4 more penguins will join them later. So, the total number of penguins in the first group is 6 + 4 = 10. Now, we need to find out how many penguins will be left in the second group after 4 penguins join it. To do this, we need to subtract the number of penguins that joined the first group from the total number of penguins in the second group. Therefore, the answer is (10 - 4) = 6 penguins will be left in the second group after 4 penguins join it.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 pencils in total and we have already counted 5 of them. So, there are remaining 5 pencils left to count. Now, let's assume that each box contains an equal number of pencils (which is not explicitly mentioned in the question). Therefore, if there are 5 boxes, then the total number of pencils in all the boxes together would be 5 x 5 = 25. Since we have already counted 5 pencils, that means there are 20 pencils left in the other boxes.;
Response:  We have 4 paksis and 46 kakkas in Velichery. Each paki has 3 kakkas under it. So, total number of kakkas = 4 x 3 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 kakkas under each paki in Velichery.;
Response:  We have 3 apples and 2 cakes in one bag. Now we take out 1 apple from the bag and put it aside. So now there are 2 apples left in the bag. Next, we take out 1 cake from the bag and eat it. Now there is only 1 cake left in the bag. Therefore, the answer is 2 (the number of cakes left in the bag).;
Response:  We have 3 apples and 4 oranges in one basket. If we take out an apple from the basket, there will be 2 apples left in the basket. Now, if we take out another apple from the basket, there will be only one apple left in the basket. So, the number of apples left in the basket after taking out two apples is 1. Similarly, if we take out four oranges from the basket, there will be three oranges left in the basket. Therefore, the total number of fruits left in the basket after taking out four oranges is 3 (apples) + 3 (oranges) = 6.;
Response:  We have three penguins and each penguin can hold one fish at most. So, in total, we have 3 x 1 = 3 fishes that can be held by all the penguins together. Now, there are 7 penguins in total, so each penguin can share 3/7 = 0.42857 fishes. Since there are no remainders, we round off to the nearest whole number, which is 4 fishes. Therefore, the answer is 4 fishes.;
Response:  We have 4 paksis and 6 kakkas in Velichery. So, there are 10 people in total (4 paksis + 6 kakkas). Now, we need to find out how many of them are left-handed. Among the 4 paksis, 2 are left-handed, so their number is 2. Similarly, among the 6 kakkas, 3 are left-handed, so their number is 3. Therefore, the total number of left-handed people in Velichery is 2 + 3 = 5.;
Response:  We have 3 paksis and 4 kakkas in Velichery. So, there are 3 x 7 = 21 paksis and 4 x 5 = 20 kakkas in total. Therefore, there are 21 + 20 = 41 birds in Velichery.;
Response:  We have to find out how many crows are there in the field and how many paddy grains are left after they eat all the paddy.  So, we can say that each crow eats 1/4 of the paddy grain.  Now, let's calculate the number of crows and paddy grains as follows:  Number of crows = Total number of paddy grains / (Number of crows x Amount of paddy each crow eats)  Number of paddy grains = Total number of paddy grains - (Total number of paddy grains x Amount of paddy each crow eats)  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:  Number of crows = 30 / (2 x 1/4) = 60  Number of paddy grains = 1500 - (1500 x 1/4) = 1000  Therefore, there are 60 crows and 1000 paddy grains left in the field after they eat all the paddy.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number of crows ( irrespective of their size) is divisible by 3 and also find out how many times it is not divisible by 3. So, we can write down two cases: Case I : Number of crows are divisible by 3 Case II : Number of crows are not divisible by 3 Now let's consider each case separately: Case I: When the number of crows are divisible by 3, then the number of crows will be of the form 3k, where k is an integer. Therefore, the total number of crows in this situation will be 3k x 3 = 9k. Since there are 10 options for the number of crows, so the probability of getting exactly 9k crows is 1/10. Hence, the answer is 9k. Case II: When the number of crows are not divisible by 3, then the number of crows will be of the form 3k + 1 or 3k + 2, where k is an integer. Therefore, the total number of crows in this situation will be 3(3k + 1) = 9k + 3 or 3(3k + 2) = 9k + 6. Since there are 10 options for the number of crows, so the probability of getting exactly 9k + 3 or 9k + 6 crows is 1/10. Hence, the answer is 9k + 3 or 9k + 6. Therefore, the final answer is 9k + 3 or 9k + 6.;
Response:  We have 4 big boxes and 8 small boxes. Each big box can hold 3 small boxes, so we can fit 12 small boxes inside each big box. Therefore, there are 4 x 12 = 48 small boxes in total. So, the number of small boxes that will be left after taking out 4 big boxes is 48 - 4 = 44.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 9 appears in the sequence of numbers given in the question.  The sequence is : 4, 7, 2, 8, 5, 3, 6, 9, 1.  Now let's count how many times each number appears :  Number Appearances : 1 - 3 times, 2 - 2 times, 3 - 1 time, 4 - 2 times, 5 - 1 time, 6 - 1 time, 7 - 1 time, 8 - 1 time, 9 - 2 times. Therefore, there are 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 occurrences of the digits from 1 to 9 in the sequence. So, the answer is 10.;
Response:  We have three pots - one big and two small. The big pot can hold 50 liters of water, and each small pot can hold 10 liters of water. Now, we need to fill all the three pots with water. How much water will be left in the big pot after filling all the three pots? Solution: First, let's fill the big pot with 50 liters of water. Then, we have 2 small pots, each holding 10 liters of water. So, altogether, we have 30 liters of water (50 - 2 x 10). Therefore, there will be 20 liters of water left in the big pot after filling all the three pots (50 - 30).;
Response:  We have 5 crows and 3 paksis in a well. The crows can fly out of the well but the paksis cannot. After some time, all the crows are gone except one. Now, there is only one crow left in the well with three paksis. So, the answer is 1 crow and 3 paksis.;
Response:  We have three crows and three dogs in a field. Each crow can eat one grain of wheat, and each dog can eat two grains of wheat. So, total number of grains eaten by crows = 3 x 1 = 3 grains. Total number of grains eaten by dogs = 3 x 2 = 6 grains. Therefore, there are 9 grains left in the field (3 - 6 = 9).;
Response:  We have 3 big cats and 2 small cats in the jungle. The big cats are lions, tigers, and leopards. So, there are 3 types of big cats. Now, we need to find out how many cubs each big cat has. According to the question, each big cat has 6 cubs. Therefore, the total number of cubs for all three big cats is 6 x 3 = 18 cubs. Now, we need to subtract the number of small cats from the total number of cubs. There are 2 small cats, so the total number of cubs minus the number of small cats is 18 - 2 = 16 cubs. Finally, we can see that 4 big cats (lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars) have 16 cubs altogether.;
Response:  We know that there are two rows of puppies in the picture. The first row has 48 puppies and the second row has 11 puppies. Now we need to find out how many more puppies are in the first row than in the second row. So, let's subtract the number of puppies in the second row from the number of puppies in the first row:  Number of puppies in the first row - Number of puppies in the second row = 48 - 11 = 37 Therefore, there are 37 more puppies in the first row than in the second row.;
Response:  We know that there are two rows of puppies in the picture. The first row has 37 puppies and the second row has 80 puppies. Now, we need to find out how many more puppies are in the second row than in the first row. To do this, we can subtract the number of puppies in the first row from the number of puppies in the second row:  Number of puppies in the second row - Number of puppies in the first row = 80 - 37 = 43 Therefore, there are 43 more puppies in the second row than in the first row.;
Response:  We know that in one puustakam there are 93 peds. So if we have two puustakams, then the total number of peds will be 93 x 2 = 186 peds. Now, out of these 186 peds, 60 peds belong to the first adhyaya and remaining 126 peds belong to the second adhyaya. Therefore, the difference between the number of peds in the first adhyaya and the number of peds in the second adhyaya is 126 - 60 = 66 peds.;
Response:  We know that in one puzha (pouch), there are 2 adhyayams (days). So, in 67 pouches, there will be 67 x 2 = 134 adhyayams. Now, let's find out how many adhyayas are left after 36 pouches. In 36 pouches, there are 36 x 2 = 72 adhyayams. Therefore, the number of adhyayas left after 36 pouches is 134 - 72 = 62 adhyayas.;

Response:  We have to find out how many apples are there in Rachel's bag based on the information given in the question.  According to the question, Rachel has 6 apple-like objects in her bag, and each object is either 2 or 4 paise heavy. So, we can represent the situation as follows: Number of 2 paise apples = x Number of 4 paise apples = y Total weight of apples = x + y Now, we know that the total weight of apples in Rachel's bag is 6 paise, so we can write an equation: 6 = x + y Substituting the values we know, we get: 6 = x + y Now, we need to solve for x and y. Since there are 2 paise apples, we can say that x = 3 (since 3 x 2 = 6). Similarly, since there are 4 paise apples, we can say that y = 3 (since 3 x 4 = 12). Therefore, the number of 2 paise apples in Rachel's bag is 3, and the number of 4 paise apples is also 3. So, the final answer is: Number of apples in Rachel's bag = 3 + 3 = 6;
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are there in Rachel's bag based on the information given in the question.

Hence, Edin would have 6 additional bullets if he had 20 initial bullets.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number of Vidyadharas in each group is divisible by 4.  Firstly, we can see that there are 408 Vidyadharas in total.  Of these, 360 Vidyadharas belong to Group A and 48 Vidyadharas belong to Group B.  Now, let's calculate the number of Vidyadharas in each group that are divisible by 4:  For Group A, there are 360 Vidyadharas, and 150 of them (divisible by 4) are in this group. So, the number of Vidyadharas in Group A that are not divisible by 4 is 110 (360 - 150).  Similarly, for Group B, there are 48 Vidyadharas, and 16 of them (divisible by 4) are in this group. So, the number of Vidyadharas in Group B that are not divisible by 4 is 32 (48 - 16).  Therefore, the total number of Vidyadharas that are not divisible by 4 is 110 + 32 = 142.  Hence, there are 142 Vidyadharas that do not fit into any of the groups.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many triangles are there in each group of 100 triangles. We can do this by dividing 479 (total number of triangles) by 100 (group size). So, the number of triangles in each group is : 479 / 100 = 4.79  Next, we need to find out how many groups of 100 triangles are required to make 489 triangles. We can do this by multiplying 4.79 with 489 (target number of triangles). So, the number of groups required is : 4.79 x 489 = 236.5  Therefore, there will be 236.5 groups of 100 triangles each, and each group will contain 479 triangles.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 310 Vidyadharas who have taken the examination and out of them, 185 have passed. So, the number of Vidyadharas who did not pass is 310 - 185 = 125. Now, among those who did not pass, some may have attempted more than once, so let's assume that 50 of them attempted twice (i.e., they were unsuccessful in both attempts). Therefore, the total number of Vidyadaras who attempted the examination but failed to clear it is 125 + 50 = 175.;

From the question, we know that there are 324 Vidyadharas who are not interested in any of the above-mentioned professions and 374 Vidyadharas who are interested in one or more of these professions. So, the total number of Vidyadharas is 324 + 374 = 698. Now, let's find out how many Vidyadharas among them are interested in each profession. According to the question, 128 Vidyadharas are interested in trade, 256 Vidyadharas are interested in agriculture, and 104 Vidyadharas are interested in both trade and agriculture. Therefore, the number of Vidyadharas interested in each profession is as follows: Trade - 128, Agriculture - 256, Both - 104. Finally, we need to find out what percentage of Vidyadharas are interested in each profession. To do this, we will divide the number of Vidyadharas interested in each profession by the total number of Vidyadharas (i.e., 698) and multiply it by 100. The results are as follows: Trade - 18%, Agriculture - 36%, Both - 15%.;

So, the total number of Vidyadharas is 228 + 105 = 333. Now, let's find out how many Vidyadharas have failed the examination. Out of the remaining 93 Vidyadharas, 33 have failed, so the number of Vidyadharas who have failed is 33. Therefore, the total number of Vidyadharas who have passed the examination is 105, and the total number of Vidyadharas who have failed is 33, i.e., 48 (105 - 33).;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many people are there in total. We know that there are 66 old men and women who need help with daily tasks. Now, let's assume that each of them needs an average of 2 hours of help per day (this is just an assumption, you can adjust it according to your understanding). So, the total number of hours required for all these old men and women would be: 66 x 2 = 132 hours/day. Next, we have to find out how many young people are available to provide this help. As per the question, there are 450 young people who are willing to work as caregivers. However, they cannot work more than 8 hours/day (as per the rule). So, the total number of hours they can contribute towards helping these old men and women is: 450 x 8 = 3600 hours/day. Finally, we have to calculate the difference between the total number of hours required and the number of hours available. This will give us the shortage of hours: Shortage = Total hours required - Total hours available = 132 - 3600 = -3480 hours/day. Therefore, there is a shortage of 3480 hours/day in providing help to these old men and women.;
"Response:  We know that there are 218 Vidyadharas who can perform the ritual of offering oblations to the fire. Out of these, 351 Vidyadharas have offered oblations to the fire so far. Therefore, the number of Vidyadharas who have not yet offered oblations to the fire is:

Number of Vidyadharas who have not offered oblations to the fire = Total number of Vidyadharas - Number of Vidyadharas who have offered oblations to the fire
= 218 - 351
= -133
Therefore, out of the remaining 351 Vidyadaras, 133 have already offered oblations to the fire and 218 have not yet done so.";
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Vidyadharas are there in total. From the question, we know that there are 269 Vidyadharas who have taken the examination and 330 Vidyadharas who have passed the examination. So, the total number of Vidyadharas is 269 + 330 = 599. Now, we need to find out how many Vidyadharas have failed the examination. From the question, we know that among the 599 Vidyadharas, 76 have failed the examination. Therefore, the number of Vidyadharas who have passed the examination is 599 - 76 = 523.;

Now, we need to find out how many more ants than penguins are there in the school. To do this, we can subtract the number of penguins from the total number of creatures: 349 - 135 = 214. Therefore, there are 214 more ants than penguins in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 308 penguins and 318 ankylosaurs in the school. Since we have to find out how many more ankylosaurs than penguins there are, let's subtract the number of penguins from the total number of animals: 318 - 308 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 more ankylosaurs than penguins in the school.;
"Response:  We know that there are 315 penguins and 309 ankylosaurs in the school. So, we have:

Number of penguins = 315
Number of ankylosaurs = 309
Total number of animals = Number of penguins + Number of ankylosaurs
= 315 + 309
= 624
Therefore, there are 624 animals in the school.";
Response:  We know that there are 402 students in one class and 739 students in total. So, to find out how many classes there are, we can divide the number of students in total by the number of students in each class:  Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 739 / 402 = 1.8  Therefore, there are approximately 1.8 classes with 402 students each.;
Response:  We know that there are 458 students in one classroom and 692 students in total. So, we need to find out how many classes there are in the school. To do this, we can divide the number of students in total by the number of students in each classroom:  Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per classroom = 692 / 458 = 1.53 classes Therefore, there are approximately 1.53 classes in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 362 odd numbers and 257 even numbers in the list of numbers given in the question. So, the total number of numbers in the list is 362 + 257 = 619. Now, we need to find out how many of these numbers are greater than 403. Since 403 is an odd number, among the odd numbers in the list, only 362 (which is the sum of both parts) are greater than 403. Similarly, among the even numbers in the list, only 257 (which is also the sum of both parts) are greater than 403. Therefore, the total number of numbers greater than 403 in the list is 362 + 257 = 619.;
Response:  We know that Edgar is 18 years old and has $100 in his wallet. He wants to buy something for $50. So, he will have $50 left after buying something. Now, let's assume that he has already spent $20 of the $50 he had left, so he now has $30 left. Therefore, the amount of money Edgar has left after spending $20 is $30.;
Response:  We know that Edgar has 13 dollars and he wants to buy something worth 50 cents. So, we need to find out how many things Edgar can buy with his money. Now, let's calculate it: $ 13 / $ 0.50 = 26.So, Edgar can buy 26 things worth 50 cents each.;
Response:  EDV 9 dollars = 8 dollars x (1 dollar / 80 cents) = $ 16. So, the number of rupees equivalent to 17 dollars is: $\frac {17 \times 16}{100} = 252$.;
Response:  We know that Edgar has 16 dollars and he spent 92 cents on something. So, his remaining amount of money is $16 - $0.92 = $15.08. Now, we are asked how much more money does Edgar have than 6 dollars. To find this out, we need to subtract 6 dollars from $15.08, which gives us $9.06. Therefore, the answer is $9.06.;
Response:  We know that Edgar has 6 dogs and each dog has 3 puppies. So, in total, Edgar has 6 x 3 = 18 puppies. Now, we are asked how many more rupees Edgar would have if he had 12 dogs instead of 6. To find this out, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the cost per dog. If it costs 500 rupees for each dog, then Edgar would have 12 x 500 = 6,000 rupees extra if he had 12 dogs instead of 6. Therefore, the correct answer is 6,000 rupees.;
Response:  We have 6 dollars and 16 pennies. If we add them together, we get $6 + $0.16 = $6.16. So, the total amount of money is $6.16.;

Response:  We have 16 dollar bills and 8 penny coins. So, in total we have $16 + $0.08 = $16.08. Now, if Avun has 19 dollars, then he has $19 - $16.08 = $3.92 left with him.;
Response:  EDV 17 dollars = 17 x $1 = $17  Now, we have to find out how many rupees are equal to $17. We know that 1 USD is approximately equal to INR 70-80. So, $17 / $1 = INR 1260 - 1400 (approximately). Therefore, the number of rupees equivalent to $17 is between 1260 and 1400.;
Response:  We know that 44 pushups can be done in 30 seconds, and 58 taps on the drum can be done in 20 seconds. So, if we want to find out how many pushups and taps can be done simultaneously, we need to divide the time taken for each activity by 2.  Therefore, the number of pushups and taps that can be done simultaneously is:  Number of pushups = Time taken for one pushup / Time taken for one tap x Number of taps = (30 sec/pushup) x (20 sec/tap) x 44 pushups = 168 pushups Number of taps = Time taken for one tap / Time taken for one pushup x Number of pushups = (20 sec/tap) x (30 sec/pushup) x 44 pushups = 79 taps Therefore, 168 pushups and 79 taps can be done simultaneously.;
Response:  We have to find out how many classes are there in each group and then add them up.  For Group A, we have 31 students in Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII. So, there are 11 classes in this group.  Similarly, for Group B, we have 20 students in Classes I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII. Therefore, there are 9 classes in this group. Now, let's calculate the total number of classes. The sum of 11 + 9 = 20. Hence, there are 20 classes in total.;
Response:  Devid has 44 push-ups in class X. Out of these, he did 30 push-ups correctly. So, the number of correct push-ups is 30.;
Response:  Devid has 51 push-ups in class 51. So he can do 49 more push-ups than Sachin. Therefore, Devid can do 100 push-ups (51 + 49).;
Response:  We know that there are 59 pushups and 44 knee raises in total.  Since Devid did 19 pushups, he has done 19/59 = 0.32 or approximately 32% of the total pushups. Similarly, since Devi did 27 knee raises, she has done 27/44 = 0.6 or approximately 60% of the total knee raises. So, Devid did more than half of the pushups but less than half of the knee raises. Therefore, the answer is (D).;
Response:  We have to find out how many times Devid has scored more than 40 points and less than or equal to 44 points in total. So, we need to count the number of instances where his score is greater than or equal to 40 and less than 44.  From the given information, we know that Devid has scored 44 points in 6 matches, which means he has scored at least 7 points per match (since there are 6 matches). Therefore, the number of instances where his score is greater than or equal to 40 and less than 44 can be calculated as follows: Number of instances = Total number of matches - Number of matches with score less than or equal to 40  Total number of matches = 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21 matches Now, let's calculate the number of instances where Devid's score is greater than or equal to 40 and less than 44: Instances = 21 matches x (7 points/match) / 40 points = 5.25 instances Since you cannot have a fraction of an instance, we round up the result to the nearest whole number, which gives us 6 instances. Therefore, the answer is 6.;
Response:  We have to find out how many push-ups and crunches can be done in total.  Firstly, we know that there are 53 push-ups and 14 crunches in each class. So, altogether they will do 53 x 14 = 752 push-ups and crunches. Now, we need to calculate how many classes can be conducted with this number of push-ups and crunches. To do so, we divide the total number of push-ups and crunches by the number of classes (which is given as 10). Therefore, we get 752 / 10 = 75 classes. So, altogether, 75 classes can be conducted with 752 push-ups and crunches.;
Response:  We have to find out how many push-ups and crunches Sakkari can do in total.  From the given information, we know that Sakkari can do 35 push-ups in 30 seconds, which is equivalent to 1.167 push-ups per second. Similarly, she can do 3 crunches in 30 seconds, which is equivalent to 1 crunch per second. Now, let's calculate the total number of push-ups and crunches Sakkari can do in one minute: Total push-ups = (35 x 60) / 100 = 2100 push-ups Total crunches = (3 x 60) / 100 = 180 crunches Therefore, Sakkari can do 2100 push-ups and 180 crunches in one minute.;
Response:  We know that there are 46 pushpaks and 58 krathus in the class. So, if we divide the total number of pushpaks (46) by the number of classes (6), we get 7 pushpaks per class. Similarly, if we divide the total number of krathus (58) by the number of classes (6), we get 9 krathus per class. Now, let's find out how many more pushpaks than krathus are there in each class. If we subtract the number of krathus from the number of pushpaks in each class, we get 30 pushpaks minus 40 krathus = -10 pushpaks per class. Therefore, there are -10 pushpaks less than the number of krathus in each class.;
Response:  According to the question, there are 19 puppies in Class A and 39 dogs in Class B. So, the total number of puppies is 19 + 39 = 58. Now, let's find out how many dogs Jon has. According to the question, Jon has 13 dogs. Therefore, the total number of dogs including Jon is 58 + 13 = 71.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 51 pushups in total and John did 22 of them. So, the number of pushups left for John to do is 51 - 22 = 29. Now, let's consider David's part. We know that he did 4 pushups out of the remaining 29 pushups. Therefore, the number of pushups left for John to do after David finished his part is 29 - 4 = 25. Hence, John has to do 25 more pushups.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that 15 students are in Class X and 39 students are in Class XII. So, there are 39 - 15 = 24 more students in Class XII than in Class X. Now, out of these 24 students, 9 are from Jon's class. Therefore, the number of students left is 24 - 9 = 15. So, there are 15 more students in Class XII than in Class X.;
Response:  Devid has 30 classes and each class has 37 students. So, in total, Devid has 30 x 37 = 1080 students.;
Response:  We know that Devid has 38 push-ups in class and he wants to do more than 56. So, we need to find out how many extra push-ups he needs to do to reach his target of 56.  To do this, we can divide the difference between the two numbers (56 - 38 = 18) by the number of push-ups he already did (38). This gives us an average of 0.47 push-ups per day. Therefore, Devid needs to do around 56 / 0.47 = 120 push-ups every day for the next 3 weeks to achieve his goal of doing 56 push-ups in class.;
Response:  We know that there are 40 pushpaks and 17 kuravas in the first class. So, the total number of pushpaks and kuravas in both classes together is 40 + 17 = 57. Now, we have to find out how many more pushpaks than kuravas are there in the second class. Since there are 34 pushpaks and 62 kuravas in the second class, the difference between the number of pushpaks and kuravas in the two classes is 34 - 62 = -28. Therefore, there are 28 fewer pushpaks than kuravas in the second class compared to the first class.;
Response:  We have to find out how many more pucks Devil has than Classy in total. So, we need to subtract the number of pucks Classy has from the total number of pucks Devil has.  According to the question, Devil has 36 pucks and Classy has 33 pucks. Therefore, the difference between their numbers is 3 (36 - 33) = 3.  Now, we need to add this difference to the total number of pucks Classy has to get the final answer. So, the number of extra pucks that Classy has over Devil is 3 + 33 = 36.;
Response:  We have to find out how many classes Devid has attended in total and then calculate the number of absent classes based on the given information.  Total classes attended = 27 + 7 = 34 Classes absent = 34 - 20 = 14 So, Sacchi has 14 absent classes.;

Response:  We know that there are 6 elephants in Ravil's group and each elephant has 3 babies. So, the total number of elephants including Ravil is 6 + 3 = 9. Now, we need to find out how many elephants will be left after one year. As per the question, 5 elephants will die every year, so the number of elephants left after one year will be 9 - 5 = 4. Therefore, there will be 4 elephants left after one year.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 elephants in Ravil's camp and 64 camels in Jack's camp. So, altogether we have 67 animals (3 + 64) in both camps. Now, let's consider the number of animals that will be left after one day. From the problem statement, we know that 5 elephants and 54 camels will leave Jack's camp after one day. Therefore, the remaining animals in Jack's camp after one day will be 64 - 5 = 60 camels. Similarly, in Ravil's camp, there are 3 elephants, and none of them will leave after one day, so the remaining elephants in Ravil's camp after one day will be 3. Thus, the total number of animals left in both camps after one day is 60 + 3 = 63 animals.;
Response:  Ravili has 5 eggs and 6 cat toys. After one day, he will have 9 eggs and 7 cat toys. So in one week (7 days), Ravili will have 5 + 9 = 14 eggs and 7 + 6 = 13 cat toys. Therefore, after one week, Ravili will have 14 eggs and 13 cat toys.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 elephants in the jungle and 12 trees. So, we have to find out how many elephants can be accommodated under each tree. Since there are 3 elephants less than the number of trees, we need to subtract 3 from the total number of elephants. Therefore, the number of elephants that can be accommodated under each tree is: Number of elephants per tree = Total number of elephants - Number of trees  Number of elephants per tree = 10 - 12 = -2  So, there are -2 elephants that can be accommodated under each tree.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 elephants in the Ravili's jungle and 8 monkeys. So, the total number of animals in the jungle is 6 + 8 = 14. Now, we have to find out how many animals are left after Ravili has eaten 2 elephants and 7 monkeys. To do this, we need to subtract the number of animals Ravili ate from the total number of animals in the jungle. Therefore, the number of animals left in the jungle after Ravili has eaten 2 elephants and 7 monkeys is 14 - (2 + 7) = 14 - 9 = 5. So, there are 5 animals left in Ravili's jungle after he has eaten 2 elephants and 7 monkeys.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6 immigrants in Jakki's group who have come from different places and have been living together for one year. Out of these 6 immigrants, 3 have gone back to their respective countries after spending one year with Jakki. So, the number of immigrants left with Jakki is 6 - 3 = 3.  Next, we know that there are 91 people living in Ravil's village. Among them, 20 have come from other villages and have been staying with Ravil for one year. So, the number of people who have stayed with Ravil for one year is 91 - 20 = 71.  Now, let's find out how many immigrants are left with Ravil after one year. We know that among the 71 people who have stayed with Ravil for one year, 18 are immigrants. So, the number of immigrants left with Ravil after one year is 71 - 18 = 53. Therefore, the difference between the number of immigrants left with Jakki and those left with Ravil after one year is 3 - 53 = -50.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 elephants in the first row and 2 elephants in the second row. So, the total number of elephants we can see at any given time is 4 + 2 = 6 elephants. Now, let's assume that one elephant moves to the other side every 3 days. Since there are 6 elephants initially, after 1 day, 2 elephants will move to the other side, leaving us with 4 elephants on each side. After 2 days, 2 more elephants from the original 6 will move to the other side, leaving us with 2 elephants on each side. Therefore, after 3 days, there will be 4 elephants on each side, as expected. So, the answer is (6 - 4) / 3 = 2 elephants per day.;
Response:  We know that there are 9 immigrants in total and they have to be divided equally among the two groups - those who will stay up north and those who will go down south. So, we need to divide 9 by 2 to get the number of immigrants each group will receive.  Therefore, the answer is 4.5 immigrants per group.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 months in May and June, so the total number of days in these two months is: 3 x 30 = 90 days. Now we have to find out how many days are left for July. Since July has 31 days, we can subtract the number of days in May and June from the total number of days in July to get the remaining days: 90 - 90 = 0 days. So, there are no days left for July.;
Response:  We have three elephants and six monkeys in one Ravil (Ravil is equal to 24 hours). So, for every 6 hours, there are 3 elephants and 6 monkeys. Therefore, after 10 meyils (Meyil is equal to 4 hours), there will be 3 x 10 = 30 elephants and 6 x 10 = 60 monkeys.;
Response:  We have to find out how many cubes of size 3x3 can be placed in a rectangular box with dimensions 9x12.  To do this, we need to divide both numbers (9 and 12) by their common factor of 3, which is the side length of each cube. So, 9 / 3 = 3 and 12 / 3 = 4. Therefore, there are 3 x 4 = 12 cubes that can fit inside the box. Now, let's count the number of cubes of size 5x5 that can fit inside the remaining space. Since the dimensions of the remaining space are 9 - 3 = 6 and 12 - 4 = 8, we can place 8 x 6 = 48 cubes of size 5x5 inside the remaining space. Finally, we add the number of cubes that can fit inside the box and the number of cubes that can fit inside the remaining space to get the total number of cubes. Therefore, the answer is 12 + 48 = 60 cubes.;
Response:  We know that Puli has 31 teeth and Tavil has 35 teeth. So, if we add both numbers together, we get 66 (31 + 35). Therefore, the total number of teeth in Puli and Tavil is 66.;
Response:  We know that there are 36 pulleys in total and each pulley has 4 grooves. So, the total number of possible combinations is 36 x 4 = 144. Now, we need to find out how many combinations have 17 or more grooves. There are 17 grooves in total, so let's count the number of combinations that have exactly 17 grooves: 17 grooves can be achieved in 2 ways (0 + 17) and 3 ways (1 + 16), for a total of 2 + 3 = 5 combinations. Similarly, there are 15 grooves in total, so let's count the number of combinations that have exactly 15 grooves: 15 grooves can be achieved in 2 ways (0 + 15) and 1 way (14 + 1), for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 combinations. Therefore, the remaining 98 combinations do not have either 17 or 15 grooves. So, the extra drum has 98 - 5 = 93 grooves.;
Response:  We have to find out how many eggs are in total and then calculate the number of eggs for each category.  Total number of eggs = 25 + 18 + 2 = 45 eggs. Now, let's calculate the number of eggs for each category:  For Pulley, there are 45 eggs / 3 = 15 eggs. For Tavil, there are 45 eggs / 2 = 22.5 eggs. And for Elly, there are 45 eggs / 1 = 45 eggs. So, the number of eggs for Elly is highest among all categories. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Elly.;
Response:  We know that  pullu has 19 inches and tavilay has 10 inches. So, we can calculate the difference between their heights as follows:  Difference = Tavilay height - Pullu height = 10 inches - 19 inches = -9 inches Now, let's find out how many more inches Elia needs to be shorter than PulLu.  We know that Elia is 20 inches tall, so we need to subtract his height from PulLu's height to get the difference: Difference = PulLu height - Elia height = 19 inches - 20 inches = 1 inch Therefore, Elia is 1 inch shorter than PulLu.;
Response:  We know that  pullu has 19 inches and tavil has 39 inches. So, if we want to find out how many tavils are needed for one pullu, we can divide 19 by 39, which gives us approximately 0.5. Therefore, to cover one pullu with three tavils, we need 3 x 0.5 = 1.5 tavils.;
Response:  We have to find out how many chutti (marks) Elia will get in total.  PulLu got 25 marks and Thavala got 32 marks, so their total marks are 25 + 32 = 57 marks. Now, we need to subtract the number of marks that Elia scored from the total marks obtained by PulLu and Thavala. So, the difference between 57 marks and the number of marks scored by Elia is the number of marks that Elia will get. Therefore, Elia will get 57 - x = 57 marks, where x is the number of marks scored by Elia. Since Elia scored 26 marks, therefore, Elia will get 57 - 26 = 31 marks.  Hence, Elie's score is 31 marks.;
Response:  We know that  puli has 24 teeth and tavil has 33 teeth. So, if we want to find out how many more teeth Elia has than Puli, we can subtract the number of teeth in Puli from the number of teeth in Tavil. Therefore,  Number of extra teeth = 33 - 24 = 9. So, Elia has 9 more teeth than Puli.;
Response:  We know that there are 13 inches in a foot and 12 feet in a yard. So, we can convert the length of the pulley as follows: Pulley length = (13 x 12) + 4 = 156 inches Now, let's find out how many yards long is the pulley: Yards = inches / 12 = 156 / 12 = 12.5 yards Therefore, the pulley is approximately 12.5 yards long.;
Response:  We know that there are 35 pullets in total and each pullet lays an average of 3 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs laid by all the pullets is: 35 x 3 = 105 eggs/day. Now, we need to find out how many eggs are laid by the hens. Since there are 4 hens for every 100 pullets, the number of eggs laid by the hens can be calculated as follows: Number of eggs laid by hens = Total number of eggs laid / Number of hens per 100 pullets  Number of eggs laid by hens = 105 eggs/day / 4 hens/100 pullets = 26.25 eggs/day. Therefore, the answer is 26.25 eggs/day.;
Response:  We know that  puli has 19 eyes and eliyum has 4 eyes. So, total number of eyes in both is 19 + 4 = 23 eyes. Now, we need to find out how many chothis (eye sockets) are there in each group. For puli, there are 4 eye sockets for every 3 eyes, so total number of chothis in puli group is 23 / 3 = 7 chothis. Similarly, for eliyum, there are 4 eye sockets for every 3 eyes, so total number of chothis in eliyum group is 23 / 3 = 7 chothis. Therefore, the answer is 7 chothis.;
Response:  We know that there are 39 pullets in total and they will lay eggs for 19 days. So, the total number of eggs laid by all the pullets is : 39 x 19 = 701 eggs. Now, we need to find out how many eggs each pullet lays per day. To do this, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of days taken to lay them: 701 eggs / 19 days = 36.85 eggs per day. Therefore, Elly lays more than 36 eggs per day.;
Response:  We know that  puli has 21 teeth and eliyum has 16 teeth. So, if we want to find out how many teeth ELIYUM has more than Puli, we need to subtract 21 from 16, which gives us 4. Therefore, ELIYUM has 4 more teeth than Puli.;
Response:  We have to find out how many cubes of size 39 inches can be formed using 17 pieces of wood of length 1 inch each. To do this, we need to divide 17 by 1, which gives us 17.

Number of times 3 appears in പുല്ലും (9): 1  Number of times 3 appears in തവളയും (3): 2  Number of times 3 appears in എലിയും (33): 4 Therefore, the number of times 3 appears in എലിയേഷ്ടം is greater than that in either of the other two numbers. So, the answer is (D) 33.;
Response:  Pulley has 14 teeth and wheel has 37 teeth. So, for every 14 teeth of pulley, there are 2 tooth of wheel. Therefore, number of teeth of elastic band = (Number of teeth of pulley x Number of teeth of wheel) / (Number of teeth of pulley + Number of teeth of wheel). = (14 x 37) / (14 + 37) = 580. Hence, Elia will stretch more than Pully.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri is 14 years old and has 6 cousins. So, the total number of people in her family including herself is 14 + 6 = 20. Now, we are asked how many more children Meri has than her father's brothers. We know that Meri's father has 3 brothers, so the total number of children among them is 3 x 3 = 9. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Meri has and the number of children her father's brothers have is 20 - 9 = 11. Hence, Meri has 11 more children than her father's brothers.;
Response:  We know that Meri has 9 cats and 11 dogs. She gave away 4 cats to her friend. So, now she has 9 - 4 = 5 cats left with her. Now, we need to find out how many dogs are left with her after giving away 4 cats. We know that she had 11 dogs initially, so the number of dogs left with her is 11 - 4 = 7 dogs. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 cats and 7 dogs.;
Response:  We know that Meri has 6 cats and 13 dogs. So, in total, she has 20 pets (6 cats + 13 dogs). Now, we are asked how many more cats Meri will have if she gets 5 more cats. Therefore, the answer is 5 more cats = 5 x 6 = 30 cats. So, Meri will have 30 cats in total after getting 5 more cats.;
Response:  We know that Meri has 11 cats and 7 dogs. So, if she wants to give away some of them, she will have to give at least 4 cats (since each cat takes up 2 spaces) and 3 dogs (since each dog takes up 1 space). Therefore, the minimum number of animals Meri can keep is 11 - 4 = 7 cats and 7 - 3 = 4 dogs.;
Response:  We know that Meri has 11 cats and 3 dogs. She wants to give away 5 of her cats and 2 of her dogs. So, she will have 6 cats and 1 dog left after giving them away.

Response:  Meri is asking for the number of apples and oranges that are in the basket. The basket contains 12 apples and 5 oranges. So, the total number of fruits in the basket is 12 + 5 = 17. Now, Meri wants to know how many more apples are there in the basket than oranges. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of oranges from the number of apples. Therefore, the answer is 17 - 5 = 12 more apples than oranges in the basket.;
Response:  We know that Meri has 9 cats and 5 dogs. So, in total, she has 14 pets (9 cats + 5 dogs). Now, we are asked how many more cats Meri has than dogs. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of dogs from the number of cats. So, 14 (cats) - 5 (dogs) = 9. Therefore, Meri has 9 more cats than dogs.;
Response:  We know that Meri has 5 cats and 14 dogs. She wants to give away 10 cats and 2 dogs. So, she will have 3 cats and 12 dogs left after giving them away. Therefore, the correct answer is (3 cat + 12 dog) = 15 pets.;
Response:  We know that Meri has 12 cakes and she gave 5 to Pachakka. So, Meri now has 7 cakes left (12 - 5 = 7).  Next, we know that Pachakka had 49 candies and he gave 30 to Avatar. So, Pachakka now has 19 candies left (49 - 30 = 19).  Now, we are asked how many candies Avatar has after receiving from both Meri and Pachakka. To find this out, we need to add the number of candies Avatar received from each person. Therefore, Avatar has 11 + 30 = 41 candies in total.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times 10 can be divided into 20. We know that 20 is divisible by 5, so 10 can be divided into 20 exactly 4 times. Now, let's calculate the number of times 80 can be divided into 20. We know that 80 is divisible by 4, so it can be divided into 20 exactly 4 times. Finally, we need to subtract the number of times 10 can be divided into 20 from the number of times 80 can be divided into 20. So, the difference between 4 and 4 is 0, which means they are equal. Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the number 12 appears in the given sequence of numbers. We can see that the number 12 appears twice in the sequence - once in the first set of numbers and again in the second set of numbers. Therefore, the number of times the number 12 appears in the given sequence is 2. Similarly, we can count the appearances of other numbers in the sequence as follows: Number of appearances of 14 = 3 Number of appearances of 7 = 2 Number of appearances of 2 = 1 Total number of appearances of all numbers except 12 = 6 Now, let's come to the last part of the question - how many times the number 12 appears more than any other number in the sequence? To find this out, we need to compare the number of appearances of each number with the number of appearances of 12. Since 12 appears twice in the sequence, it means that every other number appears fewer times than 12. So, the number of times the number 12 appears more than any other number in the sequence is 6 (the total number of appearances of all numbers except 12). Therefore, the answer to the question is 6.;
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times each number appears in the given sequence.  Number of appearances of each number is as follows:  Meri (M) - 3  Kekkunnu (K) - 2  Paachakku (P) - 1  Maavu (M) - 4  Upappu (U) - 2  Anchu (A) - 1  So, total number of numbers in the sequence = 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 Now, we need to find out which number appears most frequently in the sequence.  Among all these numbers, the one that appears most frequently is ""M"" (Mercury). It appears 3 times in the sequence. Therefore, the answer is 3.";

Response:  We know that Meri has 9 cakes and wants to share them equally among 7 friends. So each friend will get 1 1/3 cake (9 / 7 = 1 1/3). Now, Meri also wants to give 4 more cakes to her brother, so she will have 1 1/3 - 4 = 1/3 cake left for herself. Therefore, the answer is 1/3.;
Response:  We know that Meri has 11 cats and 9 dogs. She wants to give away 3 more cats and 2 more dogs. So, she will have 11 - 3 = 8 cats left after giving away 3 cats. Similarly, she will have 9 - 2 = 7 dogs left after giving away 2 dogs. Therefore, the total number of pets Meri will have after giving away 3 cats and 2 dogs is 8 + 7 = 15 pets.;
Response:  We know that Meri has 7 cakes and wants to share them equally among 10 friends. So, each friend will get 1/2 of a cake (7/10). Now, we need to find out how many cakes Meri can give to each friend if she wants to distribute them equally among 4 friends. To do this, we divide the total number of cakes (7) by the number of friends (4): 7 / 4 = 1 1/2 cakes per friend. Therefore, Meri can give 1 1/2 cakes to each of her 4 friends.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 12 cakes and 14 mangoes. Now, she wants to distribute them equally among her friends. So, each friend will get 5 cakes (12/2 = 6) and 7 mangoes (14/2 = 7). But Meri herself doesn't want to eat any of these fruits, so she will keep all of them for herself. Therefore, the total number of fruits that Meri gets is 6 + 7 = 13 fruits.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 days in Shravan month and 60 days in Shravana masa. So, if Shravana masa starts on July 28th, then it will end on September 17th (19 + 60 = 79 days). Now, let's calculate the number of days between August 15th and September 17th. There are 34 days in this period. Therefore, the remaining days in Shravana masa after August 15th are 79 - 34 = 45 days.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between two consecutive rainy days in Shravan month. According to the question, it is given that there are 87 rainy days in this month. So, the number of days between two consecutive rainy days = Number of rainy days in Shravan month - Number of rainy days before the current day. Therefore, the number of days between two consecutive rainy days = 87 - (Number of rainy days before the current day). Now, let us calculate the number of rainy days before the current day. As per the question, the current day is August 15th. So, the number of rainy days before August 15th = Total number of rainy days in Shravan month - Number of rainy days from August 1st to August 14th. Therefore, the number of rainy days before August 15th = 87 - 13 = 74. Hence, the number of days between two consecutive rainy days = 74.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 days in Shravan month and 14 days in Avittam Nakshatra. So, if Shravan month starts on July 28th, then Avittam Nakshatra will start on August 12th (as there are 14 days between these two dates). Now, let's calculate the number of days left for Avittam Nakshatra after Shravan month ends. We have 20 days in Shravan month, out of which 7 days are already over (July 28th to Aug 3rd). So, the remaining 13 days in Shravan month will overlap with Avittam Nakshatra. Therefore, the total number of days left for Avittam Nakshatra is 13 days.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in total between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of birth from the date of death.  Date of birth - ശൈത്യകാലം = 85 years  Date of death - ശൈത്യകാലം = 23 years  So, there are 62 years difference between the two dates. Now, let's calculate the number of months that have passed since the date of birth till the date of death.  Number of months = Total years / 12  Number of months = 62 years / 12 = 5 years per month  Therefore, there are approximately 5 years left for the person to live based on the calculation.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many weeks are there in 8 months. There are 4 weeks in one month, so there are 4 x 8 = 32 weeks in 8 months. Now, we need to find out how many days are there in 32 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 32 x 7 = 230 days in 32 weeks. Finally, we need to divide the total number of days by the number of weeks to get the average number of days per week. Therefore, the answer is 230 / 32 = 7.25 days per week.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 38 microorganisms in Malayalam and 47 of them can be found in Africa. So, the number of microorganisms that can be found in both places is 38 + 47 = 85.

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 days in Shravan month and 59 days in Karkidakam month. So, if it is Shravan month now, then there are only 49 days left for Onam. Secondly, we know that Malayalis have 24 hours in a day, so there are 49 x 24 = 1156 hours left for Onam in Shravan month. Finally, considering the fact that Malayalis have an average of 7 working days in a week, there are 1156 / 7 = 163 working hours left for Onam in Shravan month. Therefore, the answer is 163 working hours left for Onam in Shravan month.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 days in a month and 30 days in April. So, if it takes 27 days for one Malayalam month to complete, then it will take 30 days for two months to complete. Therefore, the number of days taken by Shaitya Kalam to complete is 60 days (2 x 30 = 60).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 86 days in a month and each day has 24 hours. So, if it takes 86 days for Malayalees to forget something, then it would take approximately 3 months (86 days x 3 = 258 days) for them to forget something completely. Now, let's consider the case of a person who is 45 years old. If he/she forgets something everyday, then it means that he/she will have forgotten around 1500 things (45 years x 365 days per year x 24 hours per day). However, this calculation assumes that the person remembers everything perfectly before forgetting anything. In reality, people tend to remember some things better than others, so the actual number of things forgotten may be lower. Therefore, the approximate time taken for an average Malayalee to forget something completely can be estimated as follows: Time taken to forget something completely = Total number of things remembered - Number of things forgotten per day x Number of days taken to forget something completely Approximate value of total number of things remembered = 1500 (as calculated above) Approximate value of number of things forgotten per day = 45 (based on the assumption that a person forgets something everyday) Approximate value of number of days taken to forget something completely = 258 (calculated earlier) Substituting these values into the formula gives us: Time taken to forget something completely = 1500 - 45 x 258 = 1097 days or approximately 3 years and 4 months.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 days in Shravan month and 35 days in Ashadha month. So, if it takes 62 days to reach from one riverbank to another during these months, then it will take more than 41 days to cover those 35 days of Ashadha month. Therefore, the answer is greater than 41 days.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Malayalam has 3 vowels and 21 consonants. So, in total there are 24 phonemes (distinct sounds) in Malayalam. Now, let's consider the duration of each sound. The shortest duration is for the 'a' vowel which lasts for 0.5 milliseconds. The longest duration is for the 'r' consonant which lasts for 2 milliseconds. Therefore, the average duration of a single sound in Malayalam is (24 x 0.5)/(total number of sounds) = 12 milliseconds.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 253 pens and she gives 70 of them to Suresh. So, the number of pens left with Polly is 183 (253 - 70). Now, we are asked how many times Suresh can use these pens in one year. As there are 12 months in a year, Suresh can use these pens for 183/12 = 15 months. Therefore, the answer is 15.;
"Response:  We know that there are 300 students in class A and 200 students in class B. So, if we take 55 students from class A and add them to class B, then the total number of students in class B will be:

Class B = Class A + (55 x 200) = 300 + 10,000 = 10,300

So, there will be 10,300 students in both classes combined after taking 55 students from class A.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pollin has 440 peas in total and he gives 111 peas to Suresh. So, the number of peas left with Pollin is 329 (440 - 111). Now, we are told that Suresh has 106 peas. Therefore, the difference between the number of peas possessed by Pollin and Suresh is 23 (329 - 106). Hence, the correct answer is 23.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 65 pens and she gave one to each of her 213 friends. So, total number of pens given away is 65 x 213 = 14050. Now, we are asked if there is any remaining pen after giving all these pens away. Since there are only 16 people left including Polly herself, there is no remaining pen. Therefore, the answer is (D) No.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pollin has 589 peas and wants to share them equally among 3 of his friends. So, each friend will get 196 peas (589 / 3 = 196). Now, we are told that one of Pollin's friends is very generous and gives away 100 peas to another friend. So, now there are 2 friends left with 96 peas each (196 - 100 = 96). But then, we are also told that one of these remaining two friends is very stingy and takes back 40 peas from the other friend. So, now there is only one friend left with 56 peas (96 - 40 = 56). Therefore, the answer is 56.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 110 apples and she gives 90 of them to her friend Rachel. So, Polly now has 210 apples left (110 - 90 = 210). Now, we are told that Rachel has 412 apples in total. Therefore, after giving some apples to Rachel, Polly has 622 apples left (210 + 412 = 622). Finally, we are asked how many more apples Polly has than Rachel. To find this out, we subtract the number of apples Rachel has from the number of apples Polly has: 622 - 412 = 210. So, Polly has 210 more apples than Rachel.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 563 pens and Raj has 558 pens. So, if they want to share them equally among themselves, each of them will get (563 + 558) / 2 = 1121 pens. Now, we need to find out how many pens Polly will give to Raj so that he gets an equal number of pens as her. Therefore, Polly will give 332 pens to Raj (332 is the difference between their total number of pens).;
Response:  We know that Polly has 52 pens and Raj has 535 pens. So, if they want to share their pens equally among themselves, each of them will get (52 + 535) / 2 = 267 pens. Now, let's see how many pens Raj has left after giving some to Polly. If he gives 492 pens to Polly, then he will be left with (535 - 492) = 43 pens. Therefore, the answer is 267 pens for Polly and 43 pens for Raj.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 521 can be divided by 66 and also how many times 154 can be divided by 66.  Firstly, we need to divide 521 by 66: 521 / 66 = 7.8390776923 Recurring (which means it repeats). Now, let's divide 154 by 66: 154 / 66 = 2.33 Recurring. So, there are 7 times when 521 can be divided by 66 and 3 times when 154 can be divided by 66. Therefore, the answer is 7 x 3 = 21.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 531 crore people in India and 38% of them are residing in rural areas. So, the number of people living in rural areas is 531 x 0.38 = 204 crore. Now, we have to find out how many bakery shops are there in each village. According to the passage, there are 391 villages in each district, and each village has an average of 7 bakeries. Therefore, the total number of bakeries in each district is 391 x 7 = 2697 bakeries. Since there are 204 crore people living in rural areas, the total number of bakeries in rural areas is 204 x 2697 = 53,634 bakeries. Finally, we need to subtract the number of bakeries in urban areas from the total number of bakeries to get the exact number of bakeries in rural areas. As per the passage, there are 38% of people living in urban areas, which means that there are 38% of 53,634 = 19,666 bakeries in urban areas. Hence, the final answer is 53,634 - 19,666 = 34,068 bakeries in rural areas.;
Response:  We know that there are 601 students in class A and 406 students in class B.  If we divide the number of students in each class by the number of recesses (3), we get:  Class A: 601 / 3 = 200 recesses per day Class B: 406 / 3 = 135 recesses per day Now, let's find out how many recesses each student will have. Since there are 336 students in total, we can calculate their average recesses as follows: Total recesses / Number of students = Average recesses per student 336 students x 200 recesses/day + 135 recesses/day = 670 recesses So, each student will have approximately 670 recesses per day.;
Response:  The first number is 291 and the second number is 315. So, if we subtract the smaller number from the larger number, we get: 315 - 291 = 24. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 24.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 267 beads and she gives 154 beads to Rony. So, Polly has 113 beads left after giving them to Rony. Now, we are asked how many beads Rony has after receiving 308 beads from Polly. Since Rony already had 231 beads, he now has a total of 539 beads (231 + 308). Therefore, the answer is 539.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times 457 can be divided by 320. We know that 457 / 320 = 1.46. So, there are 146 residuals left after dividing 457 by 320. Now, let's calculate the number of remainders when 523 is divided by 146. Using modulo arithmetic, we have 523 % 146 = 38. Therefore, there are 38 remainders when 523 is divided by 146.;
"Response:  We know that there are 11 caste groups in Kerala and each group has at least 3 sub-castes. So, the total number of sub-castes in Kerala is:

So, there are 33 sub-castes in Kerala.";
Response:  We have three vehicles (cars) and four passengers (A, B, C, D). So, each vehicle can carry at most four passengers. Now, let's see how many combinations are possible based on the given information: Combination 1: A in Vehicle 1 - B in Vehicle 2 - C in Vehicle 3 - D in Vehicle 4 This combination is not possible as there are only three vehicles available. Combination 2: A in Vehicle 1 - B in Vehicle 2 - D in Vehicle 3 - C in Vehicle 4 This combination is also not possible as there are only three vehicles available. Combination 3: A in Vehicle 1 - B in Vehicle 2 - C in Vehicle 3 - D in Vehicle 4 This is the only possible combination that satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  We know that there are 9 cats in total and each cat has 3 kittens. So, the total number of kittens is 9 x 3 = 27. Now, we have to find out how many more kittens there are than adult cats. The difference between 27 and 9 (the number of adult cats) is 18. Therefore, there are 18 more kittens than adult cats.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 caste groups in Kerala and among them, 5 are Muslim communities. So, the number of Muslim castes is 5/14 = 0.36 (or 36%). Therefore, out of 100%, 36% are Muslim castes in Kerala.;
Response:  We know that there are 13 caste markings in total and out of them, 4 are from the same person (the one who has given the answer). So, the number of different people with at least 4 caste marks is 13 - 4 = 9.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 caste marriages in total and 15 castes have married so far. So, we need to find out how many castes are left without marriage. To do this, we can subtract the number of castes that have already married from the total number of castes. Therefore, the answer is 7 (12 - 15 = 7).;
Response:  We know that there are 3 caste groups among which 4 people belong to each group. So, in total, there are 3 x 4 = 12 people belonging to different caste groups. Now, we are told that out of these 12 people, 8 have more than one wife. So, the number of people who do not have any wives is 12 - 8 = 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 caste groups in Kerala and each group has 4 sub-castes. So, the total number of sub-castes in Kerala is 8 x 4 = 32. Now, we are told that out of these 32 sub-castes, one person belongs to 99 different sub-castes. Therefore, the remaining 308 (32 - 1) sub-castes have only one member each.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 caste groups in Kerala and each group has 14 sub-castes. So, the total number of sub-castes in all 12 caste groups is 14 x 12 = 168. Now, we are asked how many more sub-castes Aravind needs to have to make it 10 times the number of sub-castes in each caste group. Therefore, Aravind needs an additional 168 / 10 = 17 sub-castes.;
Response:  We have three dogs (D1, D2, and D3) that can bark simultaneously for 2 minutes each. In total, they will bark for 6 minutes. Now, we have two cats (C1 and C2) who want to play with them. The time taken by the cats to play with the dogs is 4 minutes. So, in total, the dogs will be silent for 4 minutes after playing with the cats. Therefore, the answer is 4 minutes.;
Response:  We know that Dan is 3 years older than Dolly. So, if Dolly is currently 16 years old (as per the question), then Dan would be 19 years old (Dolly + 3).;
Response:  We know that Dan has 99 chocolates and he wants to share them equally among 3 of his friends. So each friend will get 31 chocolates (99 / 3 = 31). Now let's consider how much more or less each friend gets compared to the average number of chocolates per person. If one friend gets 40 chocolates, then the other two friends will get fewer chocolates than the average. For example, if one friend gets 40 chocolates, then the first friend will get 31 + 9 = 40 chocolates, and the second friend will get 31 - 9 = 22 chocolates. Similarly, if the third friend gets 50 chocolates, then the first friend will get 31 + 10 = 41 chocolates, and the second friend will get 31 - 10 = 21 chocolates. Therefore, the total number of chocolates shared among all three friends is 41 + 21 + 40 = 102 chocolates.;
Response:  Dan has 3 dollars and he wants to buy something from Conrad's store which costs $10. So, Dan needs $7 more ( $10 - $3 = $7). Now, there are 4 dollar bills in total ($7 x 4 = $28). Therefore, each dollar bill is worth $\frac{28}{4} = \boxed{7}$ rupees.;
Response:  We know that there are two dogs and three cats in the picture. So, the total number of animals in the picture is 2 + 3 = 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (5).;
Response:  We know that Dan has 7 dollars and he wants to buy chocolates worth 2 dollars each. So, he needs $14 (2 x 7 = 14) for buying those chocolates. Now, we are told that there is an extra dollar left after buying the chocolates. Therefore, the remaining amount of money in Dan's hand is $1 ($14 - $14 = $1).;
Response:  We know that Dan has 7 dollars and Dolly has 6 dollars. So, if they want to share equally, each of them will get $4 ( $\frac {7}{2} = \frac {6}{2}$).;
Response:  Dan has 2 dogs and each dog can bark 6 times in an hour. So, total number of barks from both dogs is 12 (2 x 6). Now, one dog barks for 3 hours, so total number of barks from that dog is 3 x 3 = 9 barks. Therefore, total number of barks from all dogs including the second one is 12 + 9 = 21 barks.;
Response:  Dan has 5 dollars and he wants to share it equally among his 4 friends. So each friend will get $1 dollar. Now, if Dan gives 2 dollars to one of his friends, that means he has only $3 left (5 - 2 = 3). Similarly, if he gives 3 dollars to another friend, he will have nothing left (3 - 3 = 0). Therefore, the correct answer is:  Dan has nothing left after giving money to all his friends.;
Response:  Dan has 10 dollars and he wants to buy a doll that costs 5 dollars. So, he will have 5 dollars left after buying the doll.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many dollars Dan can afford to spend after selling his car for $30,000. Since he has already spent $20,000 on taxes, he is left with $10,000. Now, we need to calculate how much of that amount he can afford to spend on each of the three things he wants to buy. For buying a new laptop, he needs $5,000; for paying off his credit card debt, he needs $3,000; and for saving money, he needs $2,000. So, the total amount he can afford to spend on these three things is $5,000 + $3,000 + $2,000 = $10,000. Therefore, Dan cannot afford to spend more than $10,000 on these three things combined.";
Response:  We have to find out how many dollars Dan can afford to spend after selling his three cars for $10 each. So, we need to calculate the total amount of money he will get from selling all three cars. The total amount is: $10 x 3 = $30. Now, we know that Dan has $50 left after buying the 10 chocolates. So, he can afford to spend $20 more than what he has left ($50 - $30 = $20). Therefore, the maximum amount Dan can afford to spend is $20.;
Response:  Dan has 3 dollars and each dollar is equal to 100 cents. So, Dan has 3 x 100 = 300 cents. Now, there are 4 dollars in total, so the total amount of money is 4 x 100 = 400 cents. Since Akhil got 2 chocolates for free, he gained 2 x 100 = 200 cents. Therefore, the final amount of money that Orono got was 400 - 200 = 200 cents.;
Response:  Dan has 5 dollars and he gives 3 dollars to Rachel as a loan. Now, Dan has 2 dollars left with him. If Dan had 7 dollars earlier, then he must have given 5 dollars to someone else (let's call them Bob) as a loan. So, now Dan has 2 dollars left with him, and Rachel has 3 dollars that she got from Dan as a loan. As for Bob, he has 5 dollars that he received from Dan as a loan. Therefore, the final amount of money each person has is: Dan - 2 dollars, Rachel - 3 dollars, and Bob - 5 dollars.;
Response:  Dan has 7 dollars and he spends one dollar on a candy bar. Now he has 6 dollars left. He then buys another candy bar for 2 dollars. So now he has 4 dollars left. The total amount of money Dan has spent is 6 + 2 = 8 dollars.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 115 puppets and she gave 78 of them to Vinay for his birthday party. So, we have 37 extra puppets left with Polly.;
Response:  We know that there are 137 eggs in one dozen and each egg weighs approximately 60 grams. So, the total weight of 137 eggs is 137 x 60 = 8280 grams. Now, let's convert this weight to pounds. There are 453.592 grams in one pound, so 8280 grams / 453.592 grams/pound = 18.1 pounds. Therefore, there are approximately 18.1 pounds of eggs in one dozen eggs.;
Response:  We know that there are 108 puṣkāras in one garjana (wheel). So, if we divide 108 by 35, we get 3 as the quotient. Now, let's find out how many puṣkāras are present in each suhṛti of the wheel. If we divide 62 by 3, we get 20 as the result. Therefore, there are 20 puṣkāras in each suhṛti of the wheel.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 50 puppets and each puppet has 151 eyes. So, in total, Polly has 7551 eyes (50 x 151).;
Response:  We know that there are 150 puppets in the garage and Polly has taken 58 of them. So, we have to find out how many more puppets Polly took than what was left.  To do this, we need to subtract the number of puppets Polly took (58) from the total number of puppets available (150). Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 92 (150 - 58 = 92).  So, Polly took 92 more puppets than what was left in the garage.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 21 puppies and each puppy weighs an average of 42 grams per week. So, in total, Polly will have 908 grams (21 x 42 g/w) of weight gain per week. Now, let's calculate how much Polly will weigh after 15 weeks. To do this, we need to multiply the weight gain per week by 15. Therefore, Polly will weigh 13600 grams (908 g/w x 15 w) after 15 weeks.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 71 puppets and she gave 38 of them to Vinay. So, we have 71 - 38 = 33 remaining puppets with Polly. Now, we are told that Vinay received 116 puppets from someone else. Since he already got 38 puppets from Polly, the number of puppets he received from someone else is 116 - 38 = 78. Therefore, there are 78 additional puppets that Vinay received apart from the ones he got from Polly.;
Response:  We know that there are 108 puṣkāras in one garjana and 55 pēnakas in each puṣkāra. So, in total, there are 108 x 55 = 5740 pēnaka-s in one garjana. Now, we need to find out how many pūṣkāras have 66 or more pēnaka-s. From the given information, we can see that among the 108 pūṣkāras, 66 have 66 or more pēnaka-s, and among these 66 pūṣkāras, 59 have exactly 66 pēnaka-s. Therefore, the number of pūṣkāras with 66 or more pēnaka-s in one garjana is 66 + 59 = 125.;
Response:  We know that there are 51 puppets and 106 penances in one garage. So, if we divide the total number of puppets (51) by the number of garages (1), we get the average number of puppets per garage = 51/1 = 51. Similarly, if we divide the total number of penances (106) by the number of garages (1), we get the average number of penances per garage = 106/1 = 106. Now, let's find out how many puppets and penances are present in each garage. If there are 82 puppets and 14 penances in one garage, then the ratio of puppets to penances in that garage is 82/14 = 5-1/2. Therefore, the answer is 5-1/2.;
Response:  We know that Polly has 27 puppets in her collection and she wants to give 136 of them away. So, we need to find out how many puppets Polly will keep for herself.  Since each puppet can have at most 4 strings attached to it (as mentioned in the problem statement), the total number of strings that Polly needs to attach is equal to the number of puppets she wants to give away minus the number of puppets she wants to keep for herself. Therefore, the number of puppets Polly will keep for herself is given by: Number of puppets Polly keeps = Total number of puppets - Number of puppets Polly wants to give away  In this case, the total number of puppets is 27, and Polly wants to give away 136 puppets. Therefore, the number of puppets Polly will keep for herself is: Number of puppets Polly keeps = 27 - 136 = -109 puppets. So, Polly will keep none of the puppets for herself.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 134 puppets in total and 39 of them have been used to create one garage. So, the number of puppets left is 134 - 39 = 95. Now, out of these 95 puppets, 68 have been used to create another garage. Therefore, the remaining number of puppets after creating the second garage is 95 - 68 = 27.;
Response:  We know that there are 95 pens and 153 pencils in the garage. So, the total number of stationery items is 95 + 153 = 248. Now, we need to find out how many stationery items are left after taking away the ones used by Bakkiyude. From the information given in the question, we know that Bakkiyude has used 13 pens and 23 pencils. Therefore, the number of stationery items left after taking away those used by Bakkiyude is 248 - (13 + 23) = 248 - 36 = 212. So, there are 212 stationery items left in the garage after taking away those used by Bakkiyude.;
Response:  We know that there are 42 pens and 143 pencils in one garage. So, if we divide the number of pens (42) by the total number of stationery items (155), we get 0.27 or approximately 27%. Similarly, if we divide the number of pencils (143) by the total number of stationery items (155), we also get 0.94 or approximately 94%. Now, let's calculate the percentage of pens in the other garage. If there are 113 pens and 19 pencils in another garage, then the percentage of pens is (113/155) x 100 = 73% and the percentage of pencils is (19/155) x 100 = 12%. Therefore, the percentage of pens in the second garage is 73%, and the percentage of pencils is 12%.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 roses in Jessica's bouquet.  Of these, 3 are red, 2 are pink, and 5 are white. So, out of the remaining 7 roses, how many can be yellow?  Therefore, there is only one yellow rose left in the bunch.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 23 roses in the bouquet.  Now, let's consider how many of them are red. We are told that all the roses in the bouquet are red, so the number of red roses is equal to the total number of roses. Therefore, the number of red roses is 23.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 roses in Jessica's hand and she has given 3 of them to Rachel. So, there are 4 - 3 = 1 rose left with Jessica. Now, we are told that Jessica has 7 roses in total. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica has after giving 3 to Rachel is 7 - 3 = 4 roses. Since Rachel has already received 3 roses from Jessica, there are only 4 roses left with Jessica. Hence, the answer is 4.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 roses in the bouquet. Jessica has taken 33 roses from the bouquet. So, now there are 18 (15 - 33) roses left in the bouquet. Then, we are told that 17 of these remaining roses are red. Therefore, the number of non-red roses is 18 - 17 = 1.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 roses in Jessica's bouquet and she gave 34 roses to her friends. So, there will be 13 extra roses left over (21 - 34 = 13). Now, let's assume that these 13 extra roses were given away equally among all the 15 people present at the party. Therefore, each person received 2/3 of an extra rose (13 / 15 = 2/3), which is equivalent to 0.67 roses per person.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 roses in the bouquet. Now, out of these 7 roses, Jessica has taken 59 roses. So, the number of roses left with Rosie is 59 - 59 = 0 roses. Therefore, the answer is 0.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 roses in Jessica's bouquet and she wants to give one rose each to 12 of her friends. So, the total number of roses she needs is 12 x 13 = 156 roses. Now, if Jessica has 21 roses left after giving away all the roses, then the remaining number of roses she has is 21 - 156 = -135 roses. Therefore, the correct answer is -135 roses.;
Response:  We know that there are 15 roses and 62 orchids in Jessica's bouquet. So, we have a total of 77 flowers (15 + 62) in the bouquet. Now, let's find out how many roses and orchids Jessica has. Since she has 17 roses and 96 orchids, we can conclude that she has 17/77 = 0.22 or approximately 22% of roses and 96/77 = 1.23 or approximately 123% of orchids in her bouquet. Therefore, Jessica has more than twice as many orchids as roses in her bouquet.;
Response:  We have 12 roses and 2 orchids in Vasan's garden.  Since there are more roses than orchids, we can give 6 roses to each of the two friends. So, the number of roses given to each friend is 6 x 2 = 12. Now, let's see how many orchids are left after giving away the roses. There were initially 2 orchids, and since we gave away all the roses, there are now only 2 orchids left in the garden. Therefore, the final answer is 12 roses and 2 orchids.;
Response:  We have 5 roses and 3 orchids in Jessica's bouquet. Since there are more roses than orchids, we can give priority to them. So, out of the remaining 12 roses, we will take 6 for ourselves (6 x 5 = 30). Now, we have 6 roses left. Out of these 6 roses, we have already taken 3 for ourselves, so we will leave 3 for Jessica (3 x 6 = 18). Therefore, the number of roses that Jessica gets is 18.;
Response:  We have 7 roses and 12 orchids in Jessica's bouquet. So, we can conclude that there are 7 + 12 = 19 flowers in total. Now, let's find out how many of them are roses. Since we know that 11 roses are in the bouquet, so the number of roses is 11. Therefore, the number of orchids in the bouquet is 19 - 11 = 8.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 roses in the bouquet. Now, out of these 19 roses, 3 are red. So, the number of red roses is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 roses and 84 orchids in Jessica's bouquet. So, the total number of flowers in the bouquet is 13 + 84 = 97 flowers. Now, we need to find out how many roses and orchids are left after Jessica took 91 orchids and 14 roses. To do this, we will subtract the number of orchids taken (91) from the total number of orchids (84), which gives us 91 - 84 = 9 orchids remaining. Similarly, we can calculate the number of roses remaining by subtracting the number of roses taken (14) from the total number of roses (13), which gives us 13 - 14 = -1 rose remaining. Therefore, the answer is 9 orchids and -1 rose.;
Response:  We have 16 roses and 3 orchids in Jessica's bouquet. Since there are 7 orchids and 13 roses, we can conclude that there are 7 + 13 = 20 flowers in total in Jessica's bouquet. So, the answer is 20.;
Response:  We have 6 roses and 20 orchids in Jessica's bouquet.  Since we need to divide them equally among the six rose bushes, each bush will get 3 roses (6/6 = 3). Now, let's see how many orchids each of the six rose bushes will get. There are 20 orchids left, so each bush will get 3.33 orchids (20/6 = 3.33). So, the total number of roses in Jessica's bouquet is 3 + 3 = 6, and the total number of orchids is 3.33 + 3 = 6.33. Therefore, there are exactly 6 roses and 6.33 orchids in Jessica's bouquet.;
Response:  We have 9 roses and 6 orchids in Jessica's bouquet. Since we need to choose one rose and three orchids, there are 9 - 1 = 8 roses left after choosing one rose. Similarly, since we need to choose 3 orchids out of 6, there are 6 - 3 = 3 orchids left after choosing three orchids. So, the total number of roses and orchids in Jessica's bouquet is 8 + 3 = 11.;
Response:  Robini has 17 marbles in total and she gives 4 of them to her friend. So, Robini now has 17 - 4 = 13 marbles left.;
Response:  We know that Robbin has 20 marbles in his pocket and he wants to share them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 4 marbles (20 / 5 = 4). Now, we are asked how many marbles Robbin will have left after giving 3 marbles to one of the friends. To find out, we need to subtract 3 from 4, which gives us 1 (4 - 3 = 1). Therefore, Robbin will have 1 marble left after giving 3 marbles to one of the friends.;
Response:  Robini has 16 inches in length and wants to cut it into equal parts of 11 inches each. So, he will have 4 pieces of equal length (16 / 11 = 4). Now, if he adds 3 more inches to each piece, he will get 5 pieces with a total length of 12 inches (4 x 3 + 3 = 12). Therefore, Robini's remaining length after cutting is 12 inches.;
Response:  We know that Robini's age is 19 years old and her mother's age is 18 years old. So, we can conclude that Robini's mother was born when Robini was 1 year old. Therefore, Robini's mother was born in 1993 + 1 = 1994.;
Response:  We know that Robini has 13 teeth in his upper jaw and 14 teeth in his lower jaw. So, if he loses one tooth from either jaw, how many teeth will he have left? Therefore, the correct answer is 12 teeth (13 - 1 = 12).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robini has 14 teeth in total and 8 of them are incisors. So, out of those 8 incisors, how many are on the top row (π)? We can assume that all the incisors are equally distributed between the upper and lower rows. Therefore, if there are x incisors on the top row, then there will be 14 - x incisors on the bottom row. Now, we have to find out how many incisors Robini has on the top row. According to the question, he has 20 teeth above his mouth. Since an adult human has 8 incisors in their upper jaw, we can infer that Robini has 8/2 = 4 incisors on the top row. So, the number of incisors Robini has on the top row is 4.;
Response:  We know that Danikka has 12 cups of coffee and he wants to share it equally among his friends. So, each friend will get 1 cup of coffee.

= 53 x 0.4
= 21 + 21
= 42 cups
Therefore, Ayah can give 42 cups of coffee to the 53 people.";
Response:  Dan has 63 caps and gives away 33 of them. So he has 30 remaining (63 - 33 = 30). Now, out of those 30 remaining caps, 27 are given away to Rachel, leaving him with 3 fewer than he had initially (30 - 27 = 3). Therefore, Dan has 3 caps left after giving away all the caps.;
Response:  Dan has 36 caps in his parking lot and he gives 35 of them to Parvathy. So, he has 1 cap left with him. Now, if he wants to give some more caps to Reema, how many will he have left after giving 22 caps to her?  Therefore, the answer is 1 - 22 = -21.;
Response:  Dan has 30 capsules and he wants to divide them equally among 63 people. So, each person will get 1/63 of the total number of capsules, which is 1/63 x 30 = 1/2. Therefore, there are 2 capsules left over after dividing them among all 63 people.;
Response:  Dan has 22 cups of coffee and 8 racks of eggs. If he wants to have at least 28 cups of coffee and 63 racks of eggs in his refrigerator, how many more cups of coffee should he buy? We know that he already has 22 cups of coffee, so we need to find out how many additional cups he needs. To do this, we can divide the total number of cups he wants (28) by the number of cups he already has (22):  Number of additional cups = Total number of cups wanted - Number of cups already had = 28 - 22 = 6 Therefore, Dan needs 6 more cups of coffee to reach his desired goal of having at least 28 cups of coffee in his refrigerator.;
Response:  Dan has 22 cups of coffee and 30 racks of cigarettes. If he smokes one cup of coffee for every two racks of cigarettes, how many cups of coffee will he smoke in total?

Now, we need to find out how many cups of coffee Dan can give to each of his remaining 6 friends (who are not included in the initial distribution). To do this, we divide the total number of cups left with Dan (52) by the number of friends he wants to distribute them among (6): 52 / 6 = 8  Cups of coffee per friend. Therefore, Dan can give 8 cups of coffee to each of his additional 6 friends.;
Response:  We know that Dan has 82 caps and 29 cups.  If we divide the number of caps by the number of cups, we get 3 (Dan has 82 / 29 = 3). So, Dan has exactly 3 more cups than caps. Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  We know that Dan has 66 rap songs and 39 cupcake recipes. So, in total he has 66 + 39 = 105 creations. Now, we are asked how many of these creations are his own work. Well, if Dan created all 66 rap songs himself, then he has 66/105 = 0.627 or approximately 63% of his creations are his own work. Similarly, if Dan made all 39 cupcake recipes himself, then he has 39/105 = 0.373 or approximately 37% of his creations are his own work. Therefore, Dan's own work constitutes approximately 63% of his rap songs and 37% of his cupcake recipes.;
Response:  We know that Dan has 46 caps and 50 cups. If he gives 21 cups to Rachel, then he will have 46 - 21 = 25 remaining caps. Similarly, if he gives 52 racks to Rachel, then he will have 50 - 52 = -2 remaining cups. So, Dan has at most -2 cups left after giving some to Rachel.;
Response:  We know that Dan has 65 caps and 5 cups of rice. So, we can calculate how many cups of rice he has based on the number of caps he has. Since there are 8 cups in a cap, we can divide the total number of cups of rice by 8 to get the exact number of cups. Therefore, Dan has 80 cups of rice (65 x 8 = 520). Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. According to the passage, Dan has 31 caps and 9 racks of rice. To find out how many cups of rice he has, we need to divide the total number of cups by the number of racks.

Response:  Jayakumar has 7 horses and 14 cows. So, in total, he has 21 animals (7 horses + 14 cows). Now, let's find out how many more animals Jayakumar needs to have to equal the number of animals that Sreevi has. To do this, we need to subtract the number of animals Jayakumar has from the number of animals Sreevi has: Number of animals Sreevi has = 15 - Number of animals Jayakumar has = 15 - 21 = -6 animals Therefore, Jayakumar needs 6 more animals to have an equal number of animals as Sreevi.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jayakumar has 18 cars and Sreevini has 13 cars. So, the total number of cars owned by both is 18 + 13 = 31 cars.

Response:  Jayakumar has 3 cars and 8 bicycles. So, in total, he has 11 vehicles (3 cars + 8 bicycles). Now, let's find out how many more vehicles Sreeja has than Jayakumar. We know that Sreeja has 20 vehicles, so we need to subtract the number of vehicles Jayakumar has from 20 to get the difference. Therefore, the answer is 9 (20 - 11 = 9).;
Response:  Jayakumar has 12 puppies and he wants to give 6 of them away to someone who loves dogs. So, there are 6 puppies left with him. Now, Sreevi has 11 puppies and she wants to give 5 of them away to someone who loves dogs. So, there are 6 puppies left with her. Therefore, the number of puppies that Jayakumar has is equal to the number of puppies that Sreevi has minus 5, which is 6 - 5 = 1. Hence, Jayakumar has 1 puppy more than Sreevi.;

Therefore, there are 64 cattle left with Sreeja after considering both their perspectives.;
Response:  Jayakumar has 16 cups of tea and he wants to distribute them equally among 10 people. So, each person will get 16/10 = 1.6 cups of tea per person. Now, let's consider how many cups of tea Jilu will get from the remaining 12 cups. Since there are 12 cups left after distributing 16 cups among 10 people, each cup will be divided into 12/10 = 1.2 cups for each person. Therefore, Jilu will get 12 x 1.2 = 14.4 cups of tea.;
"Response:  We know that there are 12 cups in a pound and 79 apples in a pound. So, if we have 1 pound of apples, then we have:

1 pound = 12 cups x 79 apples/cup = 936 apples

Now, let's find out how many more apples Jayakumar has than what is available in 1 pound:

Jayakumar has 1200 apples - (936 apples / 1 pound) = 264 apples extra

Therefore, Jayakumar has 264 additional apples beyond what is available in 1 pound.";
Response:  We know that Jayakumar has 13 cups of tea and 3 apples. So, he has a total of 16 items (13 x 1 = 13 + 3 = 16). Now, we are asked how many more items Jayakumar has than Sreeja. Since Sreeja has 9 cups of tea and 8 apples, she has a total of 17 items (9 x 1 = 9 + 8 = 17). Therefore, Jayakumar has 16 - 17 = -1 more item than Sreeja.;
Response:  We know that Jayakumar has 6 cups of tea and 8 sugar cubes. So, the total number of sugar cubes he needs is 6 x 8 = 48. Now, we are asked how many more sugar cubes Jayakumar needs to have in order to have exactly 17 packets of sugar. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of sugar cubes he already has (48) from the desired number of packets of sugar (17). Therefore, Jayakumar needs an additional 17 - 48 = -31 sugar cubes. Since negative numbers cannot be used as answers, we will round off the result to the nearest integer, which is 0. So, Jayakumar needs no extra sugar cubes to have exactly 17 packets of sugar.;
Response:  We know that Jayakumar has 3 cars and 10 bicycles. So, in total, he has 3 + 10 = 13 vehicles. Now, we are asked if he can have more than 12 cars and 15 bicycles.

Response:  Jayakumar has 14 puppies and wants to give 6 of them away to Jeevan. So, he will have 8 puppies left (14 - 6 = 8). Now, out of these 8 puppies, 3 are already with Jeevan, so Jayakumar will be left with 5 puppies (8 - 3 = 5).;
Response:  Jayakumar has 84 apples and 10 cups of sugarcane juice. He wants to distribute them equally among 13 people. So, he will give each person 6 apples (84/13) and 1 cup of sugarcane juice (10/13). Now, let's calculate how many apples and cups of sugarcane juice Jayakumar has left after distributing them equally among 13 people: Apples = 84 - (84 x 13 / 13) = 84 - 10 = 74 Apples Cups of sugarcane juice = 10 - (10 x 13 / 13) = 10 - 1 = 9 Cups of sugarcane juice Therefore, Jayakumar has 74 apples and 9 cups of sugarcane juice left after distributing them equally among 13 people.;
Response:  We know that Jayakumar has 13 apples and 17 peaches. So, in total, he has 13 + 17 = 30 fruits. Now, we are asked how many more apples Jayakumar has than peaches. Since Jayakumar has 8 apples more than peaches, we can say that Jayakumar has 8 (more apples) - 8 = 0 more apples than peaches. Therefore, Jayakumar has no more apples than peaches.;
Response:  Jayakumar has 8 cups of rice and 10 apples. He wants to distribute them equally among 11 people. So each person will get 8/11 = 0.73 cups of rice and 10/11 = 0.909 apples. Now let's calculate how many more or fewer apples each person gets compared to rice. Each apple is worth 2 apples, so for every extra apple a person gets, they get 2(0.909 - 0.73) = 0.165 apples more than expected. Similarly, for every fewer cup of rice a person gets, they get (10 - 8)/11 = 0.181 cups less than expected. Therefore, the average difference between the number of apples and cups of rice each person gets is 0.165 + 0.181 = 0.346.;
"Response:  We know that there are 3 cups of tea and 4 spoons of sugar in Jayakumar's cup. So, we have:

3 cups x 200 ml/cup = 600 ml tea

We know that Edward has 91 dollars less than അവൾ, which means he/she has a total of 123 - 91 = 32 dollars. So, the answer is 32 dollars.;
Response:  We know that there are 106 dogs in the shelter and 26 of them are puppies. So, the number of adult dogs is 106 - 26 = 80. Now, we need to find out how many dogs are in each category based on their age. According to the passage, among the adult dogs, 49 are older than six months, so the number of adult dogs who are younger than six months is 80 - 49 = 31. Similarly, among the puppies, 26 are less than six months old, so the number of puppies who are older than six months is 26 / 2 = 13. Therefore, the total number of dogs in the shelter can be calculated as follows: Total dogs = Adult dogs + Puppies = 80 + 13 = 93 dogs.;

Response:  We have to find out how many fans Dev can afford based on his salary of Rs 89000 per month.  As per the question, he has already spent Rs 21000 on 21 fans. So, he is left with Rs 68000. Now, we need to calculate how many fans he can buy with this amount. To do this, we divide the remaining amount (Rs 68000) by the cost price of one fan (Rs 8900). This gives us the number of fans that Dev can afford, which is 78 fans (68000 / 8900 = 78). Therefore, the answer is 78 fans.;
Response:  We have to find out how many fans Dev can buy with his money.  He has Rs 1500 and he wants to buy fans for himself. So, we need to divide Rs 1500 by the cost of one fan.  If each fan costs Rs 71, then Dev can buy 21 fans (Rs 1500 / Rs 71 = 21). But he already bought 71 fans, so he still has some money left over. The remaining amount is Rs 639 (Rs 1500 - Rs 21 x Rs 71 = Rs 639).;
Response:  We have 16 apples and 77 fans. So, we can make 1 apple for every 4.87 fans (16/77). Now, let's consider the remaining 5 apples and 23 fans. For these, we can make 0.69 apples per fan (5/23). Therefore, the total number of apples that will be left after delivering all the orders is 16 + 0.69 x 23 = 40.49 apples.;
Response:  We have 17 apples and 21 fans.  Among them, 3 apples and 7 fans are defective. So, the remaining number of apples is 17 - 3 = 14, and the remaining number of fans is 21 - 7 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 apples and 14 fans that are not defective.;
Response:  We have 15 apples and 24 fans.  Among them, 7 apples (15 x 0.3) and 6 fans (24 x 0.25) are common to both sets. So, we have 8 apples and 18 fans in common. Therefore, there are 7 apples and 16 fans that are not common.;
Response:  We have 19 apples and 18 fans. So, we can make 1 apple for every fan. Therefore, the number of apples that will be left after giving one to each fan is 19 - (1 x 18) = 17 apples. Now, let's see how many fans will get more than one apple. There are 6 fans who got more than one apple, so they will get 6 / 18 = 0.33 apples per fan. And there are 15 fans who didn't get any apple, so they will get 0 apples.;
Response:  We know that Devika has 17 fans and she wants to give away 18 bags of chocolates. So, we need one more bag of chocolate to satisfy her desire. Therefore, the answer is 19.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many numbers are less than or equal to 59 and also find out how many numbers are greater than or equal to 15. So, we can write two separate equations as follows:
For numbers less than or equal to 59:
Number of such numbers = Total number of numbers - Number of numbers greater than or equal to 59
= 100 - 12
= 88
For numbers greater than or equal to 15:
Number of such numbers = Total number of numbers - Number of numbers less than or equal to 15
= 100 - 30
= 70
So, there are 88 numbers that are less than or equal to 59 and 70 numbers that are greater than or equal to 15.";
Response:  We know that there are 24 hours in a day and 13 apples in a basket. So, we can say that each apple represents 24/13 = 1 hour and 80 minutes. Now, let's consider the remaining time of 17 hours and 21 minutes. Since there are no more than 24 hours in a day, this extra time must be from tomorrow. Therefore, the next day starts at 17 + 21 = 38 hours and 21 minutes after today. So, the answer is 38 hours and 21 minutes.;
Response:  We have 24 apples and 9 fans. Each fan consumes 3 apples per day. So, in total, 9 fans will consume 27 apples (24 x 3) per day. Now, we are asked how many apples will be left after 5 days if 12 apples are consumed every day. To find out, we need to subtract the number of apples consumed per day from the total number of apples available. Therefore, the answer is 27 - 12 = 15 apples will be left after 5 days.;
Response:  We have 11 apples and 3 fans. Each fan can cool 24 apples. So, total number of apples that each fan can cool is: 11 x 3 = 33 apples. Now, we have 2 apes and 2 fans left. Each fan can cool 24 apples, so total number of apples that each fan can cool is: 2 x 24 = 48 apples. Therefore, there are 48 apples in total.;
Response:  We know that Neelakanta has 242 cards in his deck and he discards 136 of them to make Jeff play. So, there are 106 remaining cards in Neelakanta's deck. Now, we need to find out how many more cards Neelakanta has than Jeff. To do this, we can subtract the number of cards Jeff has (136) from the total number of cards Neelakanta has (242): 242 - 136 = 106 Therefore, Neelakanta has 106 more cards than Jeff.;
Response:  We know that Neelakanta has 301 cards in his deck and he wants to give 154 of them to Jeff. So, we have 301 - 154 = 147 cards left with Neelakanta. Now, we are asked how many more cards Neelakanta needs to get to make up for the ones he gave to Jeff. Therefore, the answer is 147 + 154 = 298 cards.;
Response:  We know that Nelly has 528 cards in her deck and Jeff has 11 cards in his deck. So, the total number of cards in both decks is 528 + 11 = 539 cards. Now, we need to find out how many cards are left with Nelly after giving some cards to Jeff. From the question, we come to know that Nelly gave 252 cards to Jeff. So, the remaining number of cards with Nelly is 539 - 252 = 287 cards. Therefore, the answer is 287 cards.;
Response:  We know that Nelly has 566 cards in her deck and Jeff has 234 cards in his deck. So, the total number of cards in both decks is 566 + 234 = 798 cards. Now, we need to find out how many cards are left with Jeff after he gives some cards to Nelly. The number of cards given by Jeff to Nelly is 535 - 234 = 301 cards. Therefore, the remaining number of cards with Jeff is 798 - 301 = 497 cards.;
Response:  We know that Neelakanta has 309 cards in his deck and he wants to distribute them equally among 10 friends. So, each friend will get 30.9 cards ( rounded off to nearest integer). Now, we have to find out how many decks of cards Neelakanta needs to make for each friend to get exactly 30 cards.  To do this, we divide the total number of cards Neelakanta has (309) by the number of friends (10): 309 / 10 = 30.9. Since we cannot give a fraction of a card, we round it off to the nearest whole number, which is 31. Therefore, Neelakanta needs 31 decks of cards to distribute equally among 10 friends.;
Response:  We know that Neelakanta has 246 cards in his deck and 214 of them are jokers. So, he has 32 non-joker cards (246 - 214 = 32). Now, we need to find out how many non-joker cards Neelakanta has after removing 404 cards from his deck. To do this, we will subtract 404 cards from the total number of non-joker cards he had earlier, which is 32. Therefore, the number of non-joker cards Neelakanta has after removing 404 cards from his deck is: 32 - 404 = -372. Finally, we need to add 495 cards to the remaining non-joker cards to get the total number of non-joker cards Neelakanta has now. So, the number of non-joker cards Neelakanta has after adding 495 cards to the remaining ones is: -372 + 495 = 163. Hence, Neelakanta has exactly 163 non-joker cards in his deck.;
Response:  Nelly has 573 cards in total and she gave 195 cards to Jonathan. So, she has 378 cards left with her. Now, out of these 378 cards, she gave 210 cards to Jeff. So, Nelly has 168 cards left with her after giving them to Jeff. Therefore, the answer is 168.;
Response:  We know that Neelakanta has 438 cards in his deck and he wants to distribute them equally among 55 people. So, each person will get  $\frac {438}{55} = 8$ cards. Now, we have to find out how many cards each of the remaining $178$ people will get. Since there are $178$ people left, each person will get $\frac{438}{178} = 2.4$ cards. Therefore, the total number of cards each of the $10$ people who got less than $5$ cards will get is $\frac{438}{10} \times 5 = 21.9$.;
Response:  We know that Neelakanta has 239 cards in his deck and 38 10-card packets. So, he has a total of 38 x 10 = 380 cards in his deck. Now, we are asked how many more cards Neelakanta needs to have 400 cards in his deck. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of cards he already has (380) from the desired total number of cards (400). Therefore, Neelakanta needs an additional 20 cards (400 - 380 = 20) to complete his deck.;
Response:  We have 19 small balls and we want to pack them in boxes of size 35 each. To find out how many boxes we can make, we need to divide the total number of small balls by the number of small balls that fit in one box.

Response:  We have 13 apples and we give 4 to Aravind. So now we have 9 apples left. Then, we add 36 more apples, so now we have 45 apples in total. Therefore, there are 45 apples left after giving 36 apples to Aravind.;
Response:  Ayala has 5 kukkis and each kuki contains 7 eggs. So, Ayala has 5 x 7 = 35 eggs in total. Now, let's calculate how many more eggs Paako needs to have to make up for the 20 eggs he gave away. To do this, we need to subtract the number of eggs Paako gave away (20) from his current number of eggs (35). Therefore, Paako needs an additional 35 - 20 = 15 eggs.;
Response:  We know that there are 17 cups in total and 14 of them are full. So, we have to find out how many cups are left empty. Since 13 cups are filled with water from Suhritti's jug, we can conclude that 4 cups are left empty (17 - 13 = 4). Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 cups in a pound and 16 cups in 3 pounds. So, if we have 21 eggs, then we can calculate the number of cups as follows: Number of cups = Number of eggs / Number of cups per pound x Number of pounds Therefore, the number of cups is : Number of cups = 21 eggs / 12 cups/pound x 3 pounds = 48 cups Now, let's find out how many eggs are left after consuming 21 eggs. Number of eggs remaining = Total number of eggs - Number of eggs consumed Therefore, the number of eggs remaining is : Number of eggs remaining = 21 eggs - 21 eggs = 0 eggs Finally, we can conclude that after consuming 21 eggs, none of them are left.;
Response:  We know that there are 22 small balls and 75 large balls in total. So, the number of small balls is 22/100 = 0.22. Now, we need to find out how many small balls are among the remaining 75 large balls. Since there are 15 small balls among them, the proportion of small balls among the large balls is 15/75 = 0.20. Therefore, the number of small balls among the remaining 75 large balls is 0.20 x 75 = 15.;
Response:  We know that there are 9 big coins and 6 small coins in total. So, the number of big coins is 9/2 = 4.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a coin, let's round it off to 5 big coins. Now, we need to find out how many small coins are left after giving 5 big coins to Paaccoy. From the problem statement, we know that there are 6 small coins remaining after Paaccoy takes 5 big coins. Therefore, the number of small coins left with Paaccoy is 6 - 5 = 1. So, the final answer is 5 big coins and 1 small coin.;

$$ \therefore Gwen's new total wealth = 80 + 4 = 84 $$
So, the answer to the question is $84.";
"Response: 
Given that Gwen has 3 dolls and each doll costs $10, then Gwen has spent a total of $30 on her doll collection. 
Now, Gwen's mother gave her 6 more dollars to buy more dolls. So, Gwen now has a total of $36 ($30 + $6). 
Since Gwen wants to buy 4 more dolls, she will spend $4 x 4 = $16 on them. Therefore, Gwen's new balance is $36 - $16 = $20.";

Let's calculate the difference between the cost of the item and the amount of money Gwen has:
Cost of item = $4
Amount of money Gwen has = $5
Difference = Cost of item - Amount of money Gwen has = $4 - $5 = $-1
Therefore, Gwen needs to borrow $1 from her mother to buy the thing she wants.";
Response:  We know that Gwen has $50 and her mother gave her $30 more. So, Gwen now has $80 in total. Since Gwen is 12 years old, she can save $7 every year (as per the question). Therefore, after 10 years, Gwen will have saved $70 ($7 x 10 = $70). Now, let's calculate how much money Gwen will have after 20 years. If she continues to save $7 every year for 20 years, then she will have saved a total of $140 ($7 x 20 = $140). So, after 20 years, Gwen will have $140 + $80 = $220.;

Now, let's assume that one of the friends is already holding 3 balls from Joshini earlier. So, out of the remaining 8 balls, 7 balls will be distributed among the other 4 friends, which means each of them will get 1 ball. Therefore, the final distribution is as follows: Joshini - 0 balls; Friend 1 - 3 balls; Friends 2-5 - 2 balls each.";
Response:  Joshini has 22 gulliks and she distributed them equally among her 13 friends. So each friend got 22/13 = 1 Gullik from Joshini. Now, out of these 13 friends, 5 are girls and 8 are boys. So, Joshini gave 5/13 = 0.385 Gulliks to the girls and 8/13 = 0.615 Gulliks to the boys. Therefore, the remaining amount that Joshini kept for herself is 0.615 - 0.385 = 0.23 Gulliks.;
Response:  Joshini has 15 balls in total and she throws 9 of them. So, there are 6 balls left with her. Now, out of these 6 balls, she throws 23 more. So, now there are 43 balls (6 x 23) that Joshini has thrown. But we were told that Joshini threw only 15 balls initially, so the remaining balls must be those which she picked up after throwing the initial 15. Therefore, the number of balls that Joshini picked up is 43 - 15 = 28.;
Response:  Joshini has 3 gulicks in her hand and she throws them randomly among 6 mice. Since there are 5 mice that have not eaten any food yet, they will get the remaining 2 gulicks equally. So, each of those 5 mice gets 1 gulick. Now, let's see how many bullets Joshini has left after throwing all these gulicks. She had 3 gulicks initially, so she has 3 - (3 x 2/6) = 3 - 4 = 1 bullet left. Therefore, the answer is 1.;

Response:  We have to find out how many balls can fit in Basil's basket given that there are 10 balls in total and Basil has already taken 5 of them. So, we need to find out how many balls Basil can take from the remaining 5 balls.  Since each ball takes up one cubic meter of space, we can calculate the volume of each ball as follows: Volume of each ball = 1 cubic meter Therefore, the total volume of all 5 balls is: Total volume of 5 balls = 5 x 1 cubic meter = 5 cubic meters Now, we know that Basil took 5 balls from the original 10 balls, so the number of balls left after Basil took his share is: Number of balls left = 10 - 5 = 5 balls Now, we want to know how many balls Basil can take from these 5 balls. To do this, we divide the volume of each ball by the volume of Basil's basket: Volume of each ball / Volume of Basil's basket =? We are told that Basil's basket can hold 10 balls, so the volume of Basil's basket is: Volume of Basil's basket = 10 cubic meters Now, let's divide the volume of each ball by the volume of Basil's basket: Volume of each ball / Volume of Basil's basket = 1 cubic meter / 10 cubic meters = 0.1 cubic meters or 10% of the basket's capacity Therefore, Basil can take at most 10% of the total volume of the remaining 5 balls, which is: 10% of 5 cubic meters = 0.5 cubic meters So, Basil can take at most 0.5 cubic meters of balls from the remaining 5 balls.;
Response:  We know that there are 26 letters in the English alphabet.  So, if we have to find out how many words can be formed using these letters, we need to divide the total number of letters by the number of letters in each word. In this case, since we have 38 letters in total and 26 letters in each word, we can form 38/26 = 1.47 words. Therefore, there will be approximately 1.47 words formed using the given set of letters.;

Response:  We know that there are 43 balls in total and 21 of them are blue. So, the number of red balls is 43 - 21 = 22. Therefore, out of the remaining 21 balls, 7 are red (since there are 7 red balls for every 3 blue balls). So, the final answer is 7.;
Response:  We know that there are 41 balls in total and 18 of them belong to Basil. So, the number of balls left with Basil is 41 - 18 = 23. Now, we need to find out how many balls are left with Steve. Since he has 18 balls, the number of balls left with him is 23 - 18 = 5.;
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then calculate how many balls are left after 10 balls are taken out of the basket.  So, let's first count the number of balls in the basket. According to the question, there are 21 balls in the basket. Now, we need to subtract 10 balls from the total number of balls. This means that 10 balls are taken out of the basket. So, the remaining number of balls in the basket is :  Number of balls in the basket = 21 balls Number of balls taken out = 10 balls Remaining number of balls in the basket = 21 - 10 = 11 balls Therefore, there are 11 balls left in the basket after taking out 10 balls.;
Response:  We have to find out how many triangles are there in each of the five boxes and then add them up.  Box 1 has 7 triangles, Box 2 has 9 triangles, Box 3 has 8 triangles, Box 4 has 10 triangles, and Box 5 has 12 triangles. Therefore, the total number of triangles is: 7 + 9 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 56 triangles. So, there are 56 triangles in all the five boxes combined.;
Response:  We have 36 balls in total and we need to divide them equally among 68 people. So each person will get 1 ball. Now let's assume that there are 12 children who want to play with the balls. How many balls will each child get? Well, since there are 12 children and 36 balls, each child will get 3 balls. Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  We have 22 balls in one basket and 40 balls in another basket. So, if we take 1 ball from the first basket, there will be 21 balls left in that basket. Similarly, if we take 1 ball from the second basket, there will be 39 balls left in that basket. Now, let's assume that we took 5 balls from both baskets together. So, after taking 5 balls from the first basket, there will be 16 balls left (21 - 5 = 16), and after taking 5 balls from the second basket, there will be 34 balls left (40 - 5 = 34). Therefore, the difference between the number of balls in the two baskets after taking 5 balls from each is 16 - 34 = -18.;
Response:  We have 28 balls in one basket and 82 balls in another basket. If we take out 30 balls from the first basket, then there will be 58 balls left (28 x 2 = 56 + 30). Now, if we put all these 58 balls into the second basket, then there will be 132 balls in total (82 + 58). So, the number of balls that are not in the same basket as their original basket is 94 (132 - 58).;
Response:  We have 23 balls in one basket and 24 balls in another basket. So, there are 23 + 24 = 47 balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many balls are left in each basket after taking away the ones that are common between them. From the question, we know that 10 balls are common between the two baskets. So, the number of balls left in each basket is: Basket A - 23 (initial balls) - 10 (common balls) = 13 balls Basket B - 24 (initial balls) - 10 (common balls) = 14 balls Therefore, there are 13 balls left in Basket A and 14 balls left in Basket B.;
Response:  Ayah has 51 friends and each friend has an average of 4 children. So, total number of children = 51 x 4 = 204 children. Now, out of these 204 children, Becker has 133 kids. Therefore, remaining 71 children are with Ayah's other 49 friends.;
Response:  We know that there are 54 keys in total and Becker has 13 of them. So, we need to find out how many more keys Becker does not have. To do this, we will subtract the number of keys he has (13) from the total number of keys (54). Therefore, the answer is: 54 - 13 = 41.;
Response:  We know that Becker has 145 eggs and wants to share them equally among 72 people. So, each person will get 2 eggs (145 / 72 = 2). Now, let's see how many eggs Becker will have left after sharing them with the other people. Becker had 145 eggs initially, and he shared them equally among 72 people, so he gave away 103 eggs (145 - 42 = 103). Therefore, Becker is left with 42 eggs (145 - 103 = 42);
Response:  We have to find out how many more candies Becker can eat beyond his limit of 155 candies. Since he has already eaten 140 candies, we need to find out how many more he can eat. So, the number of additional candies Becker can eat is: 155 - 140 = 15. Therefore, Becker can eat 15 more candies beyond his initial limit of 155 candies.;
Response:  We have 121 balls and we want to divide them equally among 105 people. So each person will get 1.14 (121/105) balls. Now let's consider the remaining 17 balls. Since there are already 105 people with some balls, we can distribute these additional 17 balls among themselves in any way they like. So, each of them will get 0.163 (17/105) balls. Therefore, the total number of balls that each person gets is 1.14 + 0.163 = 1.303 balls.;
Response:  We know that there are 13 cats in the picture and each cat has 9 whiskers. So, the total number of whiskers is 13 x 9 = 117 whiskers. Now, we are asked how many more whiskers there are than the number of cats in the picture. Therefore, the difference between the total number of whiskers (117) and the number of cats (13) is 117 - 13 = 104 whiskers.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 78 exceeds 170 and then find out how many times 31 exceeds 78.  So, we need to perform two calculations:

1. How many times does 78 exceed 170?
2. How many times does 31 exceed 78?

To solve these problems, we can use mental math or estimation techniques. Here are our calculations:

Step 1: How many times does 78 exceed 170?
We know that 78 is greater than 170, so we don't need to calculate anything here. The answer is simply ""infinity"" because there are an infinite number of times that 78 exceeds 170.

Step 2: How many times does 31 exceed 78?
Let's divide 31 by 78 to find out how many times it exceeds:

31 / 78 = 0.40 (approximately)
So, 31 exceeds 78 approximately 0.40 times.

Now, let's combine both calculations to find out how many times the total number of beakers exceeds the number of vacant beakers:

Infinite times (from Step 1) + 0.40 times (from Step 2) = Infinite + 0.40 = 0.40 x infinity = infinity

Therefore, the answer to the question is infinity.";
Response:  We have 110 balls and we need to divide them equally among 75 people. So each person will get 1.53 balls (110/75). Now, there are 76 more balls available, so each of these additional people will get 1 ball (76/2 = 38). Therefore, the total number of balls that Becker has is 1.53 + 38 = 49.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 144 is divisible by 71 and also how many times it is divisible by 111.  So, we need to perform two calculations:

Divisibility by 71:

* 144 / 71 = 2 (with remainder 0)
* 144 / 71 = 2 (with remainder 1)
*... (repeating pattern of 2 and 1)

Therefore, there are 3 instances where 144 is divisible by 71.

Divisibility by 111:

* 144 / 111 = 1 (with remainder 33)
* 144 / 111 = 1 (with remainder 22)
*... (repeating pattern of 1 and remainders)

Therefore, there are 2 instances where 144 is divisible by 111.

So, in total, there are 3 + 2 = 5 instances where 144 is divisible by both 71 and 111.";
"Response:  We have 149 coins and 91 sticks.  If we want to find out how many coins are left after giving 10 coins and 90 sticks, we can do it as follows:

Response:  We know that there are 7 crows and 148 posts in the village. So, we can say that each crow has posted 21 posts (7 x 148 = 1036). Now, let's find out how many more posts each crow has made than the number of posts they have taken. To do this, subtract the number of posts taken from the total number of posts made: 1036 - 7 x 21 = 969. Therefore, each crow has made 969 more posts than the number of posts they have taken.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 126 and 48 are divisible by each other.  So we need to divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 126 and 48 is 12. Therefore, 126 / 12 = 10 and 48 / 12 = 4. Now, let's count how many times 10 and 4 appear in the two lists:  List A: 115 x 10 = 1150 81 x 4 = 324  Total: 1474 List B: 48 x 10 = 480 126 x 4 = 504  Total: 984 Now, we can see that there are more elements in List A than in List B. Therefore, the answer is (List A) 1474 - (List B) 984 = 490.;
Response:  We have 19 crows and 131 posts to distribute among them.  Since each crow can carry only one post at a time, we need to divide 131 posts by 19 crows. So, each crow will get approximately 6.85 posts (131 / 19 = 6.85). Now, let's consider the remaining posts after distributing them equally among the crows. There are 70 kites that want to fly in the sky along with the crows. If we assume that each kite needs one post to fly, then there are 70 posts left over after distributing them among the crows. Therefore, the number of posts available for distribution among the kites is 70 - 6.85 = 63.15 posts (round off to nearest integer).;
Response:  We know that there are 157 cubes and 169 pyramids. So, we have to find out how many more pyramids than cubes.  There are 158 kites and 147 stars.

Response:  We know that 81 - 46 = 35. So, there are 35 vacant positions in the second team.;
Response:  We know that there are 61 posts and 167 keys in total.  Of these, 108 keys are with Bakker and 44 posts are with him. So, the number of keys left with Bakker is:  Number of keys with Bakker = Total number of keys - Number of keys with him = 167 - 44 = 123 keys.;
Response:  We have 56 posts and 124 keys. So, we can make 1 post with 1 key or 56 posts with 1 key each. Now, let's consider the remaining 104 keys. If we distribute them equally among the remaining 29 posts, then each post will get 3.79 keys ( rounded off to 3 keys). Therefore, there are 3 keys in each of the remaining 29 posts.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 52 and 84 are divisible by 3.  So we need to divide them by 3: 52 / 3 = 17 84 / 3 = 28 Now we see that both numbers are divisible by 3 exactly once. Therefore, there are 17 + 28 = 45 pairs of multiples.  Finally, we add 102 (which is not a multiple of either number) to get our total: 45 + 102 = 147.;
Response:  We have 134 beakers and 11 kegs. Each beaker contains 100 ml of liquid, so we have 134 x 100 = 13400 ml of liquid in total. Similarly, each keg contains 50 liters of liquid, so we have 11 x 50 = 550 liters of liquid in total. Now, let's calculate the percentage of liquid that is left over after filling all the beakers and kegs: (13400 - 550) / 13400 x 100% = 86%. So, there are 86% of the original amount of liquid left over after filling all the beakers and kegs.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 cats and 153 dogs in the picture. So, the total number of animals is 167 (14 + 153). Now, we need to find out how many of them are black and white. From the question, we know that 8 of the black and white animals are puppies. Therefore, the number of black and white adult animals is 153 - 8 = 145. Finally, we have 97 brown dogs and 8 black and white dogs, so the total number of dogs is 97 + 8 = 105.;
Response:  We know that there are 43 cats and 114 dogs in total. So, if we divide the number of dogs by 2 (since each dog has one bone), we get 57 bones for dogs. Now, since each cat has 2 bones, we have 94 bones for cats. Therefore, the total number of bones is 57 + 94 = 151 bones.;
Response:  We have to find out how many gears are there in total and then divide it by 140 to get the number of gears per revolution. So, let's count the number of gears first. From the question, we know that there are 22 gears in total. Therefore, the number of gears is 22. Now, let's divide it by 140 to get the number of gears per revolution.  Number of gears per revolution = Total number of gears / Revolutions per minute So, number of gears per revolution = 22 / x (where x is the number of revolutions per minute) Now, we need to solve for x. According to the question, the engine makes one rotation every 7 seconds. Therefore, the number of revolutions per minute is 7 x 60 = 420 revolutions per minute. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get number of gears per revolution = 22 / 420 = 5.33 gears per revolution. Therefore, there are approximately 5.33 gears per revolution in the transmission.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many gears are there in total and then divide it by 2 to get the number of gears that Kellikk can shift at once. So, let's count the number of gears in each transmission ratio given in the question:

Firstly, we have 106 transmission ratios, as mentioned in the question. Now, let's count the number of gears in each transmission ratio:

* Ratio 1: 1st gear (1:1) = 1 gear
* Ratio 2: 2nd gear (1:2) = 2 gears
* Ratio 3: 3rd gear (1:3) = 3 gears
*...
* Ratio 105: 105th gear (1:105) = 105 gears
* Ratio 106: 106th gear (1:∞) = infinite gears

Total number of gears = Sum of all the above numbers = 1 + 2 + 3 +... + 105 = 53

Now, let's divide the total number of gears by 2 to find out how many gears Kellikk can shift at once:

Number of gears Kellikk can shift at once = Total number of gears / 2 = 53 / 2 = 26

Therefore, Kellikk can shift 26 gears at once.";

Therefore, the answer is 63 gears.";
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 46 kelvins in one degree Celsius and 100 degrees Celsius is equal to 460 Kelvin. So, if we convert 132 degrees Celsius to Kelvin, we get:

132°C = 460 K

Now, let's find out how many sones are equivalent to 460 Kelvin. We know that one sonne is equal to 100 Kelvin, so:

1 sonne = 100 K

Therefore, we can calculate the number of sons needed to reach 460 Kelvin as follows:

Number of sons = 460 K / 100 K = 4.6

So, there are 4.6 sons required to reach 460 Kelvin from 132 degrees Celsius.";
Response:  Kerala has 80 districts. If each district has 31 government offices, then there are 80 x 31 = 2560 government offices in Kerala. So, there are 2560 - 31 = 2529 government offices left after deducting the number of government offices in Thiruvananthapuram district.;

Response:  We know that Ranadhike has 79 blocks and Gopuram has 14 blocks. So, we need to find out how many blocks are left after giving 14 blocks to Gopuram. To do this, we will subtract 14 from 79, which gives us 65 blocks remaining. Now, we know that Veejay has 11 blocks, so we need to find out how many blocks are left after giving 11 blocks to Veejay. To do this, we will subtract 11 from 65, which gives us 54 blocks remaining. Therefore, there are 54 blocks left after distributing 14 blocks to Gopuram and 11 blocks to Veejay.;
Response:  We know that Ranadhike has 58 blocks and Goopuram has 27 blocks. So, we can say that Goopuram has fewer blocks than Ranadhike. Now, let's consider the weight of each block. According to the question, the weight of one block of Ranadhike is equal to the weight of two blocks of Goopuram. Therefore, if we want to find out how many blocks of Goopuram are equivalent to one block of Ranadhike, we need to divide the number of blocks of Ranadhike (58) by the weight of one block of Ranadhike (1). This gives us an equivalent value of 58/1 = 58 blocks of Goopuram. So, there are 58 blocks of Goopuram equivalent to one block of Ranadhike.;
Response:  Randi has 37 balls in total and he wants to distribute them equally among Goopy and Winky so that each of them gets an equal number of balls.  If we assume that Goopy can hold 33 balls and Winky can hold 13 balls, then we need to find out how many balls Randi needs to give to each of them so that they both have an equal number of balls.  To do this, we need to divide the total number of balls (37) by the capacity of each person (Goopy - 33, Winky - 13).  So, Randi needs to give 37 / 33 = 4 balls to Goopy and 37 / 13 = 2 balls to Winky.  Therefore, the answer is 4 for Goopy and 2 for Winky.;
Response:  We know that Ranadivu has 86 blocks and Gopuram has 79 blocks. So, we can say that Gopuram has fewer blocks than Ranadivu. Now, let's consider the weight of each block. According to the question, the weight of one block of Ranadivu is 10 kg, and the weight of one block of Gopuram is 8 kg. Therefore, if we want to find out how many blocks of Gopuram are equal to 82 blocks of Ranadivu, we need to divide the weight of 82 blocks of Ranadivu (i.e., 82 x 10 = 820 kg) by the weight of one block of Gopuram (i.e., 8 kg). Thus, we get 105 blocks of Gopuram equivalent to 82 blocks of Ranadivu.;
Response:  Randi has 36 balls in total and he wants to give one ball each to 59 people. So, we need to divide 36 balls among 59 people. To do this, we can use division. Division is a mathematical operation that divides a number or quantity into equal parts or groups. In this case, we are dividing 36 balls into 59 parts. The result of this division will be the number of balls each person gets. Therefore, the answer is 0.6 (or approximately 1/17) balls per person.;

Based on the given list, we can identify the following movies as critically acclaimed - ""Sahya"", ""Vazhve Mayil"", ""Kutty Srank"", ""Kodiyettam"", ""Manichitrathazhu"", ""Perumthachan"", ""Ramanujan"", ""Thaskara Veeran"", and ""Vinayaka Geetham"". Therefore, there are 10 movies in this category. Finally, based on the question, we have to find out the total number of movies mentioned in both lists combined. So, the total number of movies is 7 + 10 = 17 movies.";
Response:  We know that there are 10 interesting facts about Kerala and 11 movies produced in Kerala. So, we have a total of 21 items to consider. Now, let's assume that each item has an equal weightage of 1/21. Therefore, the total score for the movie section would be (11 x 1/21) = 5.26. Similarly, the total score for the interesting fact section would be (10 x 1/21) = 4.76. Therefore, the final score for both sections combined is (5.26 + 4.76) / 2 = 4.98.;
"Response:  We are given that there are 11 vocational courses and 17 film courses in 'Kreesa School of Film and Media Studies'. Now, we need to find out how many students can study these courses simultaneously. From the question, we know that each student can take up to 7 vocational courses and 21 film courses. So, the total number of students who can study these courses simultaneously is:

Number of students studying vocational courses = Number of vacancies x Maximum number of courses per student
= 11 x 7
= 77 students

Number of students studying film courses = Number of vacancies x Maximum number of courses per student
= 17 x 21
= 367 students

Therefore, there can be a maximum of 77 students studying vocational courses and 367 students studying film courses at Kreesa School of Film and Media Studies.";
Response:  We are given that there are 14 puppets in the skull of Brahma. Now, we need to find out how many eyes each puppet has. Since each puppet represents one of the gods, we can assume that they have two eyes each. So, the total number of eyes is 2 x 14 = 28. Therefore, the answer is 28.;
"Response:  We know that there are 62 movies and 19 awards in the list provided.  Now, we need to find out how many awards each movie has won.  To do this, we can divide the total number of awards (19) by the total number of movies (62).  So, the average number of awards per movie is:

19 / 62 = 0.306

Now, let's round off this value to the nearest integer. Since 0.306 rounds up to 1, so the average number of awards per movie is 1. Therefore, the answer is (D) 1.";
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies in the list and each movie has 21 scenes. So, the total number of scenes is 8 x 21 = 168 scenes. Now, we need to find out how many scenes are left after removing the 7 scenes that have already been watched. Therefore, the remaining scenes are 168 - 7 = 161 scenes. Finally, we need to calculate how many movies are left after watching 4 movies. Therefore, the number of movies left is 161 / 4 = 40 movies.;
Response:  We are given that there are 14 movies in the list and 15 puffs of popcorn. So, we have to find out how many puffs each movie will get.  Since there are 11 movies with more than 40 minutes duration, we can assume that each movie will get approximately 40/11 = 3.636363636... puffs of popcorn per minute. Therefore, the total number of puffs of popcorn for all 14 movies is 14 x 3.636363636... = 50.792387924... puffs. Now, let's check if this answer is correct. According to the question, the total number of puffs of popcorn for all 15 movies is 15 x 40 = 600 puffs. As we calculated earlier, the total number of puffs of popcorn for all 14 movies is 50.792387924... puffs. This means that there are 600 - 50.792387924... = 549.207612076... puffs of popcorn left over after distributing them among all 15 movies.;
Response:  We know that there are 17 movies in the list and 11 of them have won awards. So, the number of movies that haven't won any award is 17 - 11 = 6. Now, we need to find out how many of these 6 movies are from Kerala. Since the question mentions 'Kerala State Film Awards', it is clear that all the movies mentioned are from Kerala. Therefore, the number of movies from Kerala that haven't won any award is 6 / 11 = 5.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 movies in the list and each movie has 2-3 awards associated with it. So, the total number of awards for all 10 movies is 10 x 2 = 20 awards. Now, we need to find out how many awards are given to Malayalam movies. Out of the 10 movies, 6 are Malayalam movies, so the number of awards given to Malayalam movies is 6 x 2 = 12 awards. Therefore, the answer is 20 - 12 = 8 additional awards given to non-Malayalam movies.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 5 TV shows in the list. So, the total number of items is 8 + 5 = 13. Now, we need to find out how many of these items are from Mollywood.

Response:  Devyani has 7 tickets in total and she wants to distribute them equally among her friends. So, each friend will get 1 ticket. Now, there are 2 more tickets left, which means that Devyani can give 1 ticket to each of her remaining 2 friends. Therefore, the final distribution is as follows:  Devyani - 1 ticket + 1 ticket = 2 tickets.;
Response:  Devyani has 12 tickets in total and she wants to distribute them equally among her 5 friends. So, each friend will get 2 tickets (12/5 = 2). Now, Devi has 14 extra tickets left, which she can give to any other person of her choice. Therefore, the final answer is 2 + 14 = 16 tickets that Devyani will distribute among her friends and others.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 tickets in total and Devina has already picked 5 of them. So, there are 13 remaining tickets left for her to pick. Now, we need to find out how many of these 13 tickets have at least one number in common with the 5 tickets that Devina has already picked. Using basic counting principle, we can see that among the 13 remaining tickets, 11 have at least one number in common with the 5 tickets picked by Devina. Therefore, the probability that the next ticket picked by Devina will also have at least one number in common with one of the previously picked tickets is 11/13 = 0.846 (approximately).;
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 19 appears in the sequence of numbers given in the question.  The sequence starts with 19 and then repeats itself after every 3 positions. So, we can count the number of appearances of 19 as follows: 19 - 0 appearances (since it appears only once at the beginning) + 19 x 3 = 57 appearances. Therefore, there are 57 times the number 19 appears in the sequence of numbers given in the question.;
Response:  We know that there are 13 tickets in total and each ticket has 8 numbers. So, the total number of numbers is 13 x 8 = 104. Now, we need to find out how many numbers are common between both sets of numbers (numbers from the first set and numbers from the second set). To do this, we will subtract the number of unique numbers in the second set from the total number of numbers in the second set. In other words, we will subtract 18 from 104. Therefore, the number of common numbers between both sets is 104 - 18 = 86.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 14 and 2 divide into 36.  So, we need to perform division operations.  For 14, it divides 36 exactly 2 times with no remainder.  For 2, it also divides 36 exactly 2 times with no remainder.  Therefore, the number of times Devika can draw tickets is 2 x 2 = 4.;
Response:  Helium has 14 atoms in its molecule. Each atom weighs approximately 4 u (unified atomic mass units). Therefore, the total weight of one helium molecule is 14 x 4 = 56 u. Now, let's consider a single helium atom. Its weight is 4 u. So, if there are 9 marigolds in a tiffin, and each marigold weighs approximately 0.2 g, then the total weight of 9 marigolds is 9 x 0.2 = 1.8 g. Since there are 56 u in a helium molecule, and only 1.8 g of marigolds are present in the tiffin, it means that there are approximately 56 / 1.8 = 31.1 marigolds in the tiffin for every helium molecule.;
Response:  Helly has 13 dresses and each dress takes up 6 meters of fabric. So, in total, she needs 13 x 6 = 78 meters of fabric to make all her dresses. Now, let's calculate how many pieces of cloth are needed for that amount of fabric. There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter, so there are 78000 centimeters in 78 meters. Therefore, we need 78000 / 100 = 780 pieces of cloth to make all the dresses.;
Response:  Helly has 20 marbles in total and she wants to distribute them equally among her four friends. So, each friend will get 5 marbles (20/4 = 5). Now, let's consider the remaining 16 marbles that are left after distributing them equally among the four friends. Since there are 16 marbles left, we can conclude that Helly has 4 more marbles than what she gave to her friends (16 - 5 = 4). Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  We know that Helium is lighter than air and floats upwards when released in the atmosphere. So, if we release 5 balloons at once, they will float upwards immediately. Now let's consider how many balloons will be left after 12 minutes. If each balloon takes 2 minutes to reach its maximum height, then there will be 6 balloons remaining (5 + 1). Therefore, out of 12 balloons, only 6 will remain after 12 minutes.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helena is pregnant with twins (Option A). Now, let's consider each of the other options: Option B - Helena has triplets (not possible as there are no triplets in the given information). Option C - Helena has four babies (also not possible as there are only two babies mentioned). Option D - Helena has five babies (impossible as there are only two babies mentioned). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A - Helena is pregnant with twins.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 months in a year and each month has 30 days. So, if we multiply 12 x 30, we get 360 days in a year. Now, let's calculate how many years it takes for a cat to grow from kitten to full-grown adult. Generally, cats take around 4-5 years to reach their full size after they are born. So, if we divide 360 days by 4 or 5 years, we get approximately 90 or 80 days per year. Therefore, a cat grows from kitten to full-grown adult in around 90-80 days.;
Response:  We know that there are 13 dogs in total and they have to be divided equally among 4 cats. So, each cat will get 3 dogs (since 13 / 4 = 3). Now, let's see how many dogs each cat will get if we divide them evenly among the 3 cats. Each cat will get 3/3 = 1 dog. Therefore, the answer is 13 - 1 = 12 dogs left over after dividing them equally among the 4 cats.;
Response:  We have to find out how many wheels are there in 11 cars and then compare it with the number of wheels in 50 bicycles. So, the total number of wheels in 11 cars is 11 x 4 = 44 wheels. Now, let's see how many wheels are there in 50 bicycles. Each bicycle has two wheels, so the total number of wheels in 50 bicycles is 50 x 2 = 100 wheels. Therefore, there are more wheels in bicycles than in cars.;
Response:  On day 1, there were 66 skittles in the jar. After one division, there were 66 / 4 = 16 skittles left. So, on day 2, there were 16 + 28 = 44 skittles in the jar. Therefore, after two days, there are 44 skittles in the jar.;
Response:  The man said he had been waiting for 3 days and 3 nights. So, in total, it has been 3 x 3 = 9 days since he started waiting. Now, we are asked how many more days he will have to wait until his friend returns. Therefore, the answer is 9 + 24 = 33 days.;
"Response:  We know that there are 56 days in an year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we divide the total number of days (56) by the number of hours in a day (24), we get the answer as follows:

Number of hours = Total number of days / Number of hours in a day
= 56 / 24
= 2.3 hours
Therefore, the answer is 2.3 hours.";
Response:  We know that in one day, there are 360 degrees (1 degree = 60 minutes). So, in 38 days, there will be 38 x 360 = 14560 minutes. Now, we need to find out how many hours are there in this time period. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 14560 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 246 hours. Therefore, in 49 days, there will be 49 x 246 = 12744 hours.;
Response:  For 66 days, there were 31 weeks (since each week has 7 days). So, in total, there were 31 x 6 = 186 days. Now, let's find out how many weeks are left for the remaining 87 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the remaining days by 7 to get the number of weeks: 87 / 7 = 12 weeks. Therefore, there will be 12 additional weeks after the 186 days. Hence, the answer is 186 + 12 = 198 days.;
Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we divide 365 days by 24 hours, we get 15 days per hour. Now, let's calculate how many hours it takes for an elephant to grow from 3 feet to 35 feet tall. Assuming that the elephant grows at a constant rate, we can estimate that it takes approximately 15 hours for an elephant to grow one foot tall. Therefore, it will take around 2250 hours (or roughly 90 days) for an elephant to grow from 3 feet to 35 feet tall.;
Response:  We know that there are 16 suits in total and each suit has 4 ranks (Ace to King). So, the total number of cards in a deck is 16 x 4 = 64. Now, we need to find out how many cards have been dealt so far. According to the question, 80 cards have been dealt out of a total of 64 cards in the deck. Therefore, the remaining cards in the deck are 64 - 80 = 24. To find out how many more rounds it will take to deal all the cards, we divide the remaining cards by the number of rounds played so far (i.e., 1 round = 1/24 of the deck). So, it will take approximately 24 / 1 = 24 rounds to deal all the cards.;
Response:  We know that there are 67 days in a week and 12 months in a year. So, if we multiply 67 with 12, we get 804 weeks in a year. Now, let's calculate how many ounces of water can fit inside an orange. According to some sources, one medium-sized orange contains about 35 ounces of juice. Therefore, we can assume that one orange has approximately 35 ounces of volume. Now, let's convert this volume into weight. One ounce is equal to 28.3 grams, so 35 ounces would be equivalent to 969 grams (35 x 28.3). Finally, we need to divide the total number of ounces of water by the number of ounces in an orange to find out how many oranges it takes to fill up 35 ounces of water. This gives us a ratio of approximately 1:2.5, meaning that it would take around 2.5 oranges to fill up 35 ounces of water.;
Response:  We know that 74 - 71 = 3. So, in 3 days, there will be 3 more students who will have completed their education and got graduated. Therefore, after 51 days, there will be 51 + 3 = 54 students who have completed their education and got graduated.;
Response:  We know that there are 76 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a year is 76 x 24 = 1824 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours are spent in sleeping during one night. According to the question, an average person spends 6-8 hours per night in sleeping. Therefore, the total number of hours spent in sleeping in a year is 6 x 365 (days) = 2190 hours. Finally, we subtract the number of hours spent in sleeping from the total number of hours in a year to get the remaining time for other activities like work, study, leisure, etc. So, the answer is: Total hours available for other activities = 1824 - 2190 = -366 hours.;
Response:  We know that there are 28 days in a week and 52 weeks in a year. So, if it takes 26 days for an orange to grow from a small size to a big size, then after how many years will it take for an orange to grow from a small size to a big size?  Therefore, the answer is 13 years (26 x 26 = 676 days).;
Response:  We know that in one week (7 days), there are 7 x 8 = 56 days. So, if we have to find out how many days it will take for the stock of 82 bags to be finished, we need to divide the number of bags by the number of days available. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of days required to finish the stock of 82 bags = 82 / 56 = 14.69 days.;
Response:  We know that there are 31 days in March and 24 hours in a day. So, if we divide 45 days by 24 hours, we get 1.875 days. Therefore, the number of times an elephant can eat 24 packets of biscuits in one day is 1.875.;
Response:  We know that there are 44 seconds in one minute and 25 seconds in one hour. So, if we have to calculate how many seconds it takes for an orange to grow from 1/8 inch to 3/8 inch, we need to multiply these two numbers.  There are 44 seconds in one minute, so it will take 44 x 60 = 2640 seconds for an orange to grow from 1/8 inch to 3/8 inch in one day. Now, let's convert this time into hours. There are 3600 seconds in one hour, so 2640 seconds / 3600 seconds per hour = 0.73 hours. Therefore, it will take approximately 0.73 hours or 45 minutes for an orange to grow from 1/8 inch to 3/8 inch in one day.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 small boxes and 74 large boxes. So, if we want to pack 100 boxes in one day, we need to use 36 small boxes (5 x 12 = 60) and 48 large boxes (74 - 26 = 48). Therefore, it will take 36 + 48 = 84 days to pack all the boxes using only these two types of boxes.;
Response:  The man said he had 54 sacks of rice and gave one-eighth of it to his brother every day. So, in how many days will he finish giving all the rice? Solution: To find out how many days it will take for him to give away all the rice, we need to divide the total number of sacks (54) by the amount given per day (one-eighth). Therefore, the man will finish giving all the rice in 67 days (54 / 0.125 = 67).;
Response:  The man has 56 sacks of rice and he wants to distribute them equally among 14 days. So, each day he will get bury 390 grams of rice (56/14 = 390).;
Response:  The person has spent Rs. 25 for one day and Rs. 5 for another day, so in total they have spent Rs. 30. Now, if he spends Rs. 73 for 73 days, then he will have spent a total of Rs. 73 x 73 = Rs. 5190. So, there are 5190 - 30 = 5160 days left.;
Response:  We know that in one week (7 days), there are 65 skittles per day and 46 skittles per day for the other team. So, after 6 days, the total number of skittles collected by both teams will be: 65 x 6 = 390 skittles for the first team and 46 x 6 = 286 skittles for the second team. Therefore, after 6 days, the difference between the two teams is: 390 - 286 = 104 skittles.;
Response:  On day 1, he had 41 sugar candies and spent 86 rupees. So, he has 45 rupees left (41 x 2 = 82). On day 2, he spends 30 rupees for buying toys. So, his balance is now 12 rupees (82 - 30 = 52). Now let's calculate how much money he will have after one week (7 days) if he continues to spend at this rate.  Day 1: 41 sugar candies, spent 86 rupees, balance 45 rupees. Day 2: Spent 30 rupees, balance 12 rupees. Day 3: No spending as he already has 12 rupees from previous day. Day 4: No spending as he already has 12 rupees from previous day. Day 5: No spending as he already has 12 rupees from previous day. Day 6: No spending as he already has 12 rupees from previous day. Day 7: No spending as he already has 12 rupees from previous day. Therefore, after one week (7 days), he will have 12 rupees in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 71 squares in total and each square has an area of 1 sq km. So, the total area of all the squares is 71 x 1 = 71 sq km. Now, we need to find out how many squares can fit inside a circle with a diameter of 60 km. To do this, we will use the formula for the area of a circle, which is : Area of Circle = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the circle is 60 km, its radius is half of that value, i.e., 30 km. Now, plugging this value into the formula above, we get : Area of Circle = π(30)^2 = 25100 sq km. Therefore, the number of squares that can fit inside the circle is : Number of Squares = Total Area of Circle / Area of Each Square = 25100 / 71 = approximately 358 squares. So, after one day, approximately 358 squares will be left unused from the total area of 71 squares.;
Response:  Jessie has 12 apples and 11 oranges. So, if we add both of them together, Jessie has a total of 23 fruits (12 + 11 = 23). Therefore, the correct answer is 23.;
Response:  Jessie has 7 apples in her bag and she wants to share them equally among 14 children. So, each child will get how many apples?  Therefore, the answer is 7/14 = 0.5 apples per child.;
Response:  Jessie has 7 heads and each head has 14 teeth. So, in total, Jessie has 7 x 14 = 98 teeth. Now, if we want to know how many teeth are there in one of Jessie's heads, we need to divide the total number of teeth by the number of heads. Therefore, the number of teeth in one of Jessie's heads is 98 / 7 = 14 teeth per head.;
Response:  Jessie has 11 heads and 15 tails. If she flips a coin 16 times, there is a probability of getting 8 heads (since each head appears with probability $\frac{11}{22}$) and 8 tails (since each tail appears with probability $\frac{15}{22}$). So, the total number of times Jessie will get a head is $8 \times 16 = 128$. Therefore, the answer is $128$.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesy has 2 moles of hair and wants to dye them blonde. So, she needs 12 volumes of developer to achieve the desired shade. Now, let's calculate how much developer Orlando will need for each mole of his hair. Since he has 4 times as many moles as Jesy, he will require 4 x 12 = 48 volumes of developer in total. Therefore, the final answer is 48 volumes of developer needed to dye all of their hair blonde.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesy has 19 hairs in her eyebrow and 18 hairs in her mustache. Now, if there are 20 hairs in total, then the number of hairs in each part will be equal. So, the number of hairs in Jesy's eyebrows is 19/20 = 0.95 and the number of hairs in her mustache is 18/20 = 0.9. Therefore, the answer is 0.95 for the number of hairs in Jesy's eyebrows and 0.9 for the number of hairs in her mustache.;
Response:  Jessie has 19 years of experience and wants to earn $20 more per hour. So, her desired hourly wage is $19 + $20 = $39 per hour.;
Response:  Jessie has 10 fingers and 5 toes. So, she has 15 digits in total (10 fingers + 5 toes). Now, let's calculate the length of each digit. The length of each finger is approximately equal to half the length of the hand. Therefore, the length of each finger is about 2.5 inches or 6.35 cm. Similarly, the length of each toe is also about 2.5 inches or 6.35 cm. Thus, the total length of all the digits (fingers and toes) is: Total length = Length of fingers x Number of fingers + Length of toes x Number of toes In this case, the total length of all the digits is: Total length = (6.35 cm x 10) + (6.35 cm x 5) = 63.5 cm + 31.75 cm = 95.25 cm This means that Jessie's hands are approximately 95.25 cm long, including her fingers and thumbs.;
Response:  Jessie has 10 fingers and 2 toes, so she has 12 body parts in total. Now, let's calculate the length of each part: Fingers - 10 x 4 cm = 40 cm Toes - 2 x 2 cm = 4 cm Total length of all body parts = 40 + 4 = 44 cm Therefore, the length of Jessie's body is approximately 44 cm.;
Response:  Jessie has 18 cats and each cat has 4 kittens. So, in total, Jessie has 72 kittens (18 x 4). Now, out of these 72 kittens, 20 are male. Therefore, the number of female kittens is 52 (72 - 20).;
Response:  We know that Rajesh has 23 dogs and each dog weighs an average of 45 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all Rajesh's dogs is: 23 x 45 = 1025 kg. Now, let's find out how many teak trees with a diameter of 23 cm can be planted using this weight. To do this, we need to divide the weight by the volume of one teak tree. The volume of a teak tree is approximately 70 cubic feet (or 2.9 cubic meters). So, dividing the weight by the volume gives us: 1025 kg / 2.9 m^3 = 360 teak trees. Therefore, Rajesh can plant around 360 teak trees with a diameter of 23 cm using the weight of his 23 dogs.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 tiger sharks in the tank with 51 dolphins. So, we can assume that each tiger shark eats one dolphin per day. Therefore, the number of dolphins left after 3 days will be: Number of dolphins = Total number of dolphins x (Number of days / Number of tiger sharks) = 51 x (3 / 3) = 51 x 1 = 51 dolphins After 3 days, all 3 tiger sharks will have eaten 17 dolphins each, leaving none behind.;
"Response:  Rajesh has 87 dogs and each dog weighs an average of 20 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all dogs owned by Rajesh is:

Weight of dogs = Number of dogs x Average weight per dog
= 87 x 20 kg
= 1740 kg

Now, let's calculate the number of trucks needed to transport all these dogs. We know that one truck can carry a maximum load of 95 dogs or 3600 kg (based on the information provided in the question). So, to find out how many trucks are required to transport all the dogs, we divide the total weight of dogs by the maximum load capacity of a single truck:

Number of trucks = Total weight of dogs / Maximum load capacity of a single truck
= 1740 kg / 3600 kg
= 0.48 trucks

Therefore, based on the given information, Rajesh needs approximately 0.48 trucks to transport all his 87 dogs.";
Response:  We know that there are 106 dogs and 242 cats in the village.  Since each dog has 3 kittens and each cat has 4 kittens, we can calculate the total number of kittens as follows: Number of kittens = Total number of cats x Number of kittens per cat = 242 x 4 = 976 kittens Now, let's find out how many kittens are born to each mother cat. To do this, we need to divide the total number of kittens by the number of mothers: Number of kittens per mother = Total number of kittens / Number of mothers = 976 / 115 = 8.5 kittens per mother So, each mother cat gives birth to approximately 8.5 kittens on average.;
Response:  We know that there are 720 tires in total (98 x 7 = 720). Now, we need to find out how many tires will be left after 163 tires have been sold. To do this, we can divide the total number of tires by the number of tires available for sale:  Total tires - Number of tires available for sale = Leftover tires So, in this case, the leftover tires would be: 720 - 163 = 557 tires. Therefore, there will be 557 tires left after 163 tires have been sold.;
Response:  We know that there are 78 dogs and 186 cats in the village.  Since each dog has 3 teeth and each cat has 4 teeth, we can calculate the total number of teeth as follows:  Dogs: 78 x 3 = 234 Teeth Cats: 186 x 4 = 792 Teeth Therefore, there are 234 + 792 = 1026 teeth in the village.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of teeth in both sets of teeth. The total number of teeth in Reshma's set is 62 + 99 = 161 teeth. Similarly, the total number of teeth in Ramesh's set is 183 + 31 = 214 teeth. Now, let's find out how many more teeth Ramesh has than Reshma. We can do this by subtracting Reshma's total number of teeth from Ramesh's total number of teeth: 214 - 161 = 53 teeth. Therefore, Ramesh has 53 more teeth than Reshma.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of teeth in both sets of teeth. The total number of teeth in Reshma's set is 67 + 165 = 232 teeth. Similarly, the total number of teeth in Ramesh's set is 74 + 156 = 230 teeth. Now, let's compare the number of teeth in each set and find out who has more teeth.  Number of teeth in Reshma's set = 232 teeth Number of teeth in Ramesh's set = 230 teeth Therefore, Reshma has slightly more teeth than Ramesh. So, the answer is (A) Reshma.;
Response:  We know that there are 192 dogs and 34 cats in the text.  Each dog has an average of 6 puppies, and each cat has an average of 3 kittens. So, we can calculate the total number of offspring as follows: Dogs: 192 x 6 = 1144 puppies Cats: 34 x 3 = 102 kittens Now, let's convert these numbers to rupees based on their respective values: Dog Offspring Value: ₹1144 per puppy Cat Offspring Value: ₹102 per kitten Total value of offspring: ₹1144 x 1144 = ₹128,000 + ₹102 x 102 = ₹10,400 Therefore, one teaxas (1 T) of offspring is worth approximately ₹118,400.;
"Response:  We know that there are 100 reservoirs in Texas and Oklahoma, each holding 75 million gallons of water. So, the total amount of water stored in these reservoirs is:

$$ \text {Total water storage} = \text {Number of reservoirs} \times \text{Capacity of each reservoir} $$

= 100 $\div$ 75 $=$ 1.33 billion gallons

Now, we need to find out how much water is required for irrigation purposes. The question states that ""about 25% of the water is used for irrigation."" So, let's calculate the amount of water required for irrigation:

$$ \text {Irrigation water requirement} = \text {Total water storage} \times \text {Percentage used for irrigation} $$

= 1.33 $\div$ 0.25 $=$ 0.53 billion gallons

Finally, we need to convert the volume from gallons to cubic feet. There are 7.5 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

$$ \text {Irrigation water requirement (in cubic feet)} = \text {Irrigation water requirement (in gallons)} \times \text {Conversion factor} $$

= 0.53 $\div$ 7.5 $=$ 7.19 billion cubic feet

Therefore, the answer to the question is approximately 7.19 billion cubic feet of water is required for irrigation purposes in Texas and Oklahoma.";
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of teeth in Reshma's mouth. According to the question, she has 51 teeth. Now, let's find out how many teeth are there in each denture. As per the question, there are 8 dentures with 130 teeth in each denture. Therefore, the total number of teeth in all eight dentures is 8 x 130 = 1040 teeth. So, the total number of teeth in Reshma's mouth is 51 + 1040 = 1091 teeth.;
"Response:  Reshma has 201 dollars in her wallet and she wants to buy a new laptop worth $1400. So, she needs to borrow money from someone. Now, let's calculate how much she can borrow based on the amount of money she has with her.  The ratio of the amount of money she has to the cost of the laptop is :

$$ \frac {201}{1400} = \boxed {0.145} $$

So, Reshma can borrow $\boxed{145}$ dollars from someone to buy the new laptop.";
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many teeth are there in total in the mouth of an average person. According to various sources, including dentists and medical professionals, the average number of teeth in an adult human mouth is around 32. So, there are 32 teeth in total in the mouth of an average person. Now, let's come to the second part of the question. The question asks us to calculate how many teeth will be left if one loses 60% of their teeth. To do this, we need to multiply the total number of teeth (32) by the percentage lost (60%). This gives us 19.2 teeth that will be left after losing 60% of the original teeth. Finally, the last part of the question asks us to calculate how many teeth will be left if one loses another 40% of their remaining teeth. To do this, we can use the same formula as before, but with a new percentage value of 40%. This gives us 10.8 teeth that will be left after losing another 40% of the remaining teeth. Therefore, the final answer to the question is 10.8 teeth.;
"Response:  We know that there are 5 T-shirts in total and each T-shirt has 3 boxes of 6 pieces each. So, the total number of pieces in all 5 T-shirts is:

5 x 3 = 15

Now, we need to find out how many dollars each piece costs. According to the question, the cost per piece is $21.50. Therefore, the total cost of all 15 pieces is:

15 x $21.50 = $324.50

So, the answer is $324.50.";
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of buying all the items that Reshma wants to buy. The cost of each item is given in the question as follows:  * 5 dresses at Rs 500 each = Rs 2500  * 215 pairs of shoes at Rs 300 each = Rs 64500  * 20 t-shirts at Rs 100 each = Rs 2000  * 64 jeans at Rs 800 each = Rs 51200 Total cost of buying all these items = Rs 79750 Now, let's find out how much money Reshma has left after buying all these items. We know that she had Rs 2000 initially and spent Rs 79750 on buying the items mentioned above. So, the amount of money Reshma has left = Initial amount + Amount spent - Cost of items bought = Rs 2000 + Rs 79750 - Rs 79750 = Rs 5000 Therefore, Reshma has Rs 5000 left after buying all the items she wanted.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of squares in the grid. There are 76 rows and 204 columns in the grid, so there are 76 x 204 = 16,396 squares in the grid. Now, let's find out how many squares each shape occupies. The rectangle has an area of 158 square meters, which is equivalent to 158 / 100 = 1.58 squares. Similarly, the triangle has an area of 2 square meters, which is equivalent to 2 / 100 = 0.02 squares. Therefore, the total number of squares occupied by all shapes is 16,396 - (1.58 + 0.02) = 16,394 squares. So, there are approximately 16,394 squares in the grid that do not have any shape drawn on them.;
Response:  We know that there are 210 dogs and 240 cats in the shelter.  Each dog has an average of 7 puppies per litter, and each cat has an average of 3 kittens per litter. So, we can calculate the total number of animals at the shelter as follows:  Number of dogs = 210 x 7 = 1570 Number of cats = 240 x 3 = 720 Total number of animals = 1570 + 720 = 2290 Now, let's find out how much money is needed to spay/neuter all these animals. The cost of spaying or neutering an animal varies depending on its size and age. According to the ASPCA, the average cost of spaying or neutering an animal is around $50 to $100. Since we have a large number of animals at the shelter, it would be more economical to get them spayed or neutered en masse. Therefore, we will assume that the cost of spaying or neutering one animal is around $75 (which is roughly halfway between the lowest and highest estimated costs). Now, let's calculate the total cost of spaying or neutering all the animals at the shelter: Number of dogs to be spayed/neutered = 1570 x $75 = $116,250 Number of cats to be spayed/neutered = 720 x $75 = $52,500 Total cost of spaying/neutering all animals = $116,250 + $52,500 = $168,750 Therefore, if we want to spay/neuter all the animals at the shelter, it would cost approximately $168,750.;
Response:  We know that there are 115 dogs and 25 cats in the shelter.  Each dog has an average of 7 puppies per litter, and each cat has an average of 4 kittens per litter. So, we can calculate the total number of animals at the shelter as follows:  Number of dogs = 115 x 7 = 805 dogs Number of cats = 25 x 4 = 100 cats Now, let's assume that half of the dogs (402.5 dogs) and half of the cats (50 cats) are adopted. The remaining dogs and cats will be transferred to other shelters or euthanized. Therefore, the number of animals left at the shelter after adoption is: Number of dogs left = 805 - 402.5 = 402.5 dogs Number of cats left = 100 - 50 = 50 cats Based on these calculations, if 100 dogs and 25 cats are adopted from the shelter, then the remaining animals at the shelter would be approximately 402.5 dogs and 50 cats.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 sets of meshes and each set contains 10 casements. So, in total, there are 5 x 10 = 50 casements. Now, we need to find out how many more casements are required for the additional 3 rooms. Since each room requires 4 casements (as mentioned in the question), we need 3 x 4 = 12 extra casements. Therefore, the final answer is 50 + 12 = 62 casements.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 parts in one parottie and each part contains 4 seeds. So, total number of seeds in one parottie is 12 x 4 = 48 seeds. Now, we need to find out how many parotties can be made with 500 seeds. To do this, we divide the total number of seeds (500) by the number of seeds in one parottie (48). Therefore, the answer is 500 / 48 = 10.42 (approximately) parotties.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 people in each team and 7 teams in total. So, the number of people in each team is 4 x 7 = 28. Now, we need to find out how many sets of 5 people can be formed from these 28 people. To do this, we divide 28 by 5, which gives us 5.6. Since you cannot have a fraction of a set, we round off the result to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, there are 6 sets of 5 people that can be formed from the given population of 140 people.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 months in an year and each month has either 28 or 29 days (leap years). So, if we have to calculate the number of weeks in a year, we need to divide the total number of days in a year by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). Now, let's do this calculation: Total number of days in a year = 365 (non-leap years) + 366 (leap years) Total number of weeks in a year = Total number of days in a year / 7 Therefore, the number of weeks in a year is : 365/7 = 50 weeks per year (approximately);
Response:  We know that there are 10 sets of meshes and each set contains 6 casements. So, in total, there are 60 casements (10 x 6 = 60). Now, we need to find out how many more casements are required to make 11 pairs. To do this, we can divide 11 by 2 (since each pair requires two casements) and get 5.5. Since you cannot have a fraction of a casement, we round off 5.5 to 6 casements. Therefore, there are 6 additional casements required to make 11 pairs.;
"Response:  We know that there are 12 meshes and 14 caste groups in total. Out of these, 6 caste groups have more than one mesh. So, we need to subtract the number of meshes associated with each group from their total count. Here is the calculation:

Group 1 (Meshes - 3): 12 - 3 = 9
Group 2 (Meshes - 5): 14 - 5 = 9
Group 3 (Meshes - 2): 10 - 2 = 8
Group 4 (Meshes - 4): 8 - 4 = 4
Group 5 (Meshes - 1): 7 - 1 = 6
Total number of caste groups without any mesh: 6
So, out of the remaining 14 caste groups, 8 have at least one mesh associated with them.";
Response:  We know that there are 4 sets of meshes and each set has 3 casements. So, in total, we have 4 x 3 = 12 casements. Now, out of these 12 casements, 14 are openable from inside, which means 14 - 3 = 11 casements are closed from outside. Therefore, the answer is 11.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 cars in Orono's collection and each car has 7 seats. So, the total number of seats in all the cars is 14 x 7 = 98 seats. Now, we need to find out how many more seats are available after subtracting the number of seats occupied by Orono himself. Since Orono occupies 3 seats, the remaining seats are 98 - 3 = 95 seats. Therefore, the correct answer is 95 seats.;
Response:  We know that 5 x 460 = 2300. So, if we subtract 2300 from 4800, we get 2500. Therefore, the difference between 4800 and 2500 is 2300.;

Response:  We know that there are 216 days in an academic year and each day has 8 hours of schooling (including breaks). So, total hours of schooling per year is: 216 x 8 = 1728 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours of schooling a student attends everyday on average considering all the holidays and weekends. Lets assume that there are 702 days in a year including weekends and holidays. So, total number of days attended for schooling is : 702 days. Average number of hours of schooling per day can be calculated as follows: Total hours of schooling / Number of days attended for schooling = 1728 hours/702 days = 2.45 hours/day. Therefore, a student attends approximately 2.45 hours of schooling per day on average considering all the holidays and weekends.;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 1357 days in 40 years (as per the given information). Now, let's find out how many days are there between two consecutive years. We can do this by subtracting the number of days in one year from the number of days in the next year. For example, if the first year is 2020 and the second year is 2021, then the difference in days between these two years is: 2021 - 2020 = 1 day. Similarly, for each subsequent year, we need to subtract the number of days in that year from the previous year until we reach the last year. Using this method, we get: Year 1 (2020) - Day Difference: 0 Days; Year 2 (2021) - Day Difference: 1 Day; Year 3 (2022) - Day Difference: 1 Day;...; Year 40 (2060) - Day Difference: 40 x 1 = 40 Days. Therefore, the total number of days between the two dates is: Total Day Difference = 1 + 1 + 1 +... + 40 = 40 x 1 = 40 Days. So, the answer is 40 days.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 1091 students in class XL of Loyola School. Out of them, 28 students scored full marks (i.e., 100%) in their exams. So, the number of students who got less than 939 marks is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who scored full marks. Therefore, the number of students who got less than 939 marks is:  Number of students who got less than 939 marks = Total number of students - Number of students who scored full marks = 1091 - 28 = 1063 students.;
Response:  We know that there are 403 students in Lewis' class and 233 of them passed the examination. So, the number of students who did not pass is 170 (403 - 233). Now, we need to find out how many of those who did not pass got more than 45 marks. From the question, we know that among the 170 students who did not pass, 49 scored less than 45 marks. Therefore, the number of students who got exactly 45 or more marks is 121 (170 - 49).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 368 days in an year and 1359 weeks in 40 years. So, if someone has worked for 40 years, they have worked for 54,720 hours (368 days x 1359 weeks). Now, let's calculate how much money this person would have earned if they were paid $10 per hour. The calculation is as follows: Total hours worked = 54,720 hours x Salary per hour = $547,200. Therefore, the answer to the question is $547,200.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 491 dolphins in the ocean and they swim at an average speed of 1181 meters per hour. Now, to find out how many kilometers they travel in one hour, we need to convert the speed from meters per hour to kilometers per hour. There are 1000 meters in one kilometer, so we can convert the speed as follows: 1181 meters/hour x 1000 = 1181 km/h. Therefore, the dolphins travel 1181 kilometers in one hour.;
Response:  We know that the number of days in September is 30. So, if today is September 13th, then we have 30 - 13 = 17 days left in September. Now, we need to find out how many days are left after 133 days from today. Therefore, we subtract 133 from 17, which gives us 116 days left in September after 133 days from today.;
Response:  We have two dogs and each dog has 3 puppies. So, in total we have 6 puppies (2 x 3 = 6). Now, one of the dogs is 1 year old, which means it was born after 178 days from the last litter. Therefore, the other dog must have been born before 178 days ago. Hence, the correct answer is 177 days.;
Response:  We know that Veena has 10 fingers and Deni has 9 toes. So, if we add up both numbers, we get 19 (10 + 9). Now, let's see how many fingers and toes Veena has in total. Since she has 10 fingers and 9 toes, Veena has a total of 19 body parts. Therefore, the correct answer is 19.;
Response:  We know that Denny has two dogs and each dog has 8 tails. So, in total, Denny has 16 tails (2 x 8 = 16). Now, we are asked how many tails Ronin has. Since Ronin is older than Denny, he must have more tails than Denny. Therefore, Ronin has 14 tails (more than Denny's 16 tails).;
Response:  We know that Denny is 11 years old and Ronnie is 12 years old. So, if Denny starts playing at 4 pm, then Ronnie will start playing at 5 pm (since he is 1 year older than Denny). Therefore, the time difference between their playtime is 1 hour.;
Response:  We know that Denny has 15 marbles in his pocket and Ronnie wants one of them. So, we need to find out how many marbles are left after Ronnie takes one. There are 13 marbles in Denny's pocket minus the one he gave to Ronnie, so there are 12 marbles left. Therefore, the answer is 12.;
Response:  We know that Ronin has 16 moths and Den has 9 ears. So, we can calculate the number of ears per month as follows:  Number of ears = Total number of ears / Monthly ear growth rate  In this case, the total number of ears is 16 (for Ronin) + 9 (for Den) = 25. The monthly ear growth rate for Ronin is 4 (as he grows 4 moths in one year), so his new number of ears will be: New number of ears = Old number of ears x Monthly ear growth rate  For Ronin, the new number of ears will be: New number of ears = 25 x 4 = 100  Therefore, after 13 months, Ronin will have 100 ears.;
Response:  We know that Ronin is 15 years old and Deni is 6 years old. So, if we calculate their age difference, it will be 9 years (15 - 6 = 9). Now, let's find out how many months this age difference is equivalent to. There are 12 months in a year, so we can convert 9 years into months as follows: 9 x 12 = 108 months. Therefore, Ronin and Deni are 108 months apart in age.;
Response:  We know that Brahman is beyond all numbers and quantities. So, we cannot say that Brahman has 34 or any other number of aspects. However, in Vedanta philosophy, there are 34 main principles (or Upanishads) that discuss various aspects of Brahman. These Upanishads provide insights into the nature of Brahman and help us understand its true essence. Therefore, the correct answer is option A - Brahman has 34 aspects.;

Response:  Ayah has 23 shelves with 27 packets and 80 masikakals. If she wants to know how many packets are in each shelf, we can divide the total number of packets (27) by the number of shelves (23). So, there are approximately 1 packet per shelf. Now, if Ayah wants to know how many masikakals are in each shelf, we can divide the total number of masikakals (80) by the number of shelves (23), which gives us approximately 3.48 masikakals per shelf.;
Response:  Ayah is 30 years old and has been working at Brilliant for 5 years. She earns $80,000 per year and her company provides health insurance coverage for herself and her husband. Her husband is also 30 years old and works as an engineer at a different company that offers medical insurance coverage to its employees. They have two children who are 7 and 9 years old respectively and they both go to private schools. Their monthly expenses including rent, utilities, food, transportation, entertainment, and savings come out to be around $12,000. So their annual income after taxes would be around $96,000. Now let's calculate how much money Ayah can save each month based on her take-home pay of $7,000 per month. If she saves 50% of her take-home pay which is $3,500 then she will have saved around $42,000 in one year. This means she will have around $138,000 left over after saving for one year. Therefore, if Ayah invests this amount at an interest rate of 6% compounded annually, she will have around $151,000 after 5 years.;
Response:  Ayah is 29 years old and has 23 friends in her salon who are also her clients. Each of these friends spends an average of 61 minutes with Ayah per month. So, the total time Ayah spends with all her friends and clients in her salon every month is: 23 x 61 = 1373 minutes.;
Response:  Brahmanandam has acted in 7 films with Ajay Devgn. So, there are 7 options for the first film. For each of these films, he had at least one song. Therefore, the total number of songs sung by Brahmanandam is at least 7 x 1 = 7. Since Brahmanandam has acted in more than 28 films, we can conclude that the number of songs sung by him is greater than or equal to 28. Therefore, the answer is (A) Greater than or equal to 28.;
Response:  Brahmanandam has acted in 105 films as per the information given in the question. So, he has acted in 2 films for every 3 years of his career. Therefore, if Brahmanandam started his acting career at age 38, then he would have acted in 2 x 38 = 76 films till that age.;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""ശ്രമം"" (shramam) appears in the text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of that word in the given text.  After careful count, we find that the word ""ശ്രമം"" appears 4 times in the text. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. The question asks us to find out how many times the word ""സുഹൃത്തും"" (suhritthum) appears in the text after the word ""ക്ഷണം"" (kshanam). Again, we can count the number of occurrences of that word in the given text and find that it appears 3 times after the word ""ക്ഷണം"". Therefore, the total number of times the word ""സുഹൃത്തും"" appears in the text is 7 (4 + 3). Finally, the last part of the question asks us to find out how many times the word ""ക്ഷണം"" appears in the text before the word ""സുഹൃത്തും"". This time, we can easily see that the word ""ക്ഷണം"" appears only once before the word ""സുഹൃത്തും"", so the answer is 1. So, the final answer to the question is 7.";
Response:  The question is asking about the number of times a certain person has visited 12 different places in Kerala. We are given that this person has visited these places 3 times each. So, the total number of visits to all 12 places = 3 x 12 = 36. Therefore, the answer is 36.;
Response:  Keralan's age is given as 75 years. He has 10 grandchildren. Each of his grandchild has an average of 4 children, which means he has 40 great-grandchildren. Since each great-grandchild has an average of 2.5 siblings, Keralan has a total of 100 nephews and nieces. Therefore, the number of people who are related to Keralan through blood or marriage is 140 (100 nephews + 40 great-grandchildren). Now, let's calculate the probability that at least one of these people will be present in the audience. There are 100 people in the audience, so we need to divide the number of relatives by 100 to get the probability. So, the probability is 14%.;
Response:  Keralan is asking how many dogs he can keep in his house if he has 14 kennels and each kennel can accommodate 6 dogs. So, the total number of dogs he can keep = 14 x 6 = 84 dogs. But Keralan already has 11 adult dogs, so he cannot keep any more than that. Therefore, the maximum number of dogs Keralan can keep in his house is 84 - 11 = 73 dogs.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 people in total - Aravind, his wife, and two children.  So, the number of pairs of relatives is 4 x 3 = 12.  Now, out of these 12 pairs, 3 are father-son pairs (Aravind's father, Aravind himself, and one of his sons). Therefore, the number of remaining pairs is 12 - 3 = 9.  Finally, we know that Aravind has 9 cousins, so the number of cousin pairs is 9.  Hence, the answer is 9.;
Response:  We have 12 melons in one basket and 36 baskets in total. So, the number of melons in all baskets is 12 x 36 = 432. Now, we need to find out how many melons are left after some of them were taken away. If 20 baskets had 5 melons each, then the total number of melons in those baskets is 20 x 5 = 100. So, the remaining number of melons in all baskets is 432 - 100 = 332. Therefore, there are 332 melons left in all baskets.;
Response:  We have three Melissa's and each of them has 81 Pokémon in their collection. So, the total number of Pokémon that all three Melissas together own is: 3 x 81 = 243 Pokémon.;
Response:  We know that there are 109 people in Melissa's orchestra and 82 bones in each person's body. So, the total number of bones in Melissa's orchestra is: 109 x 82 = 8640 bones. Now, we need to find out how many bones are left after subtracting the number of people who have fewer than 79 bones. To do this, we will divide the total number of bones (8640) by 79, which gives us: 8640 / 79 = 109. Therefore, there are 109 people in Melissa's orchestra who have fewer than 79 bones.;
Response:  We know that Melisa has 21 cats and she wants to give them away equally among her 5 friends. So, we need to divide 21 by 5 which gives us 4.2. Therefore, each of Melisa's friend will get 4.2 cats from her.;

To do this, we will divide the total value by 50. So, 1143 / 50 = 22.86 coins. Therefore, there are 22 coins with 50 paise or more.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 4 seats can accommodate in each of the four seasons.  Summer has 3 months (April to June), Autumn has 3 months (September to November), Winter has 3 months (December to February) and Spring has 3 months (March to May). So, we need to divide 12 by 3 for each season to get the number of times 4 seats can accommodate in that season.  For summer, it is 4 x 3 = 12; for autumn, it is 4 x 3 = 12; for winter, it is 4 x 3 = 12; and for spring, it is 4 x 3 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 times 4 = 48 seats available in total.";
Response:  We know that there are 9 students in each class and 3 classes in total. So, the number of students in all three classes together is 9 x 3 = 27. Now, we need to find out how many students will be promoted to higher classes. As per the question, 4 students from each class will be promoted to higher classes, so the total number of students promoted is 4 x 3 = 12. Therefore, the remaining 15 students (27 - 12) will continue in their current classes.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 stations in the first phase of the project and each station has 15 platforms. So, the total number of platforms in the first phase is 19 x 15 = 285 platforms. Now, we need to find out how many more platforms will be added in the second phase. According to the question, an additional 20 ferry terminals will be constructed, which means that the total number of platforms in the second phase will be 285 + 20 = 305 platforms. Therefore, the answer is 305.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 seats in the Parikkaril's car and 15 of them have already been taken. So, we need to find out how many seats are left vacant. Since 10 seats are available for each student, if all students want to sit together, then only 10 students can sit in the car. Therefore, the remaining number of students who cannot sit with their friends is 5 (15 - 10 = 5).;
Response:  We know that there are 6 stations in the first sector and each station has 14 platforms. So, the total number of platforms in the first sector is 6 x 14 = 84. Now, we have to find out how many platforms are left after removing 16 platforms from the remaining 84 platforms. To do this, we need to subtract 16 from 84, which gives us 68. Therefore, there are 68 platforms left after removing 16 platforms from the remaining 84 platforms.;
Response:  We know that there are 2 large stations and 23 small stations in Parukkili. So, the total number of platforms is 2 + 23 = 25. Now, we need to find out how many platforms have more than 14 passengers and how many have less than or equal to 54 passengers. To do this, we can divide the total number of passengers (108) by 14, which gives us 7.64. Since we cannot have a fraction of a platform, let's round it up to 8 platforms with more than 14 passengers. Similarly, we can divide the remaining 90 passengers by 54, which gives us 1.67. Since we cannot have a fraction of a platform either, let's round it down to 1 platform with fewer than 54 passengers. Therefore, there are 8 platforms with more than 14 passengers and 1 platform with fewer than 54 passengers at Parukkili station.;
Response:  We have three large fir trees and seven small fir trees in one of the parks. Each large tree has 16 branches, and each small tree has 12 branches. If we remove all the branches from one of the large trees, how many branches will be left in that park? So, there are 16 + 7 = 23 branches remaining in the park after removing one large tree.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number of days in one year (365) is divided by the number of weeks in a year (52). So, we need to divide 365 by 52.  The result is 7. Therefore, there are 7 years in 4 seasons.;
Response:  We have 4 people in one car and they are traveling for 10 hours. Each person can sit comfortably for 2 hours maximum. So, total number of trips = Total time taken / Time per trip = 10 hours / 2 hours = 5 trips. Therefore, there will be 5 seats available in the other car.;
Response:  We have 7 oranges and we want to share them equally among 14 people. So, each person will get how many oranges?  To find out, divide 7 by 14: 7 ÷ 14 = 0.5 (or half) So, each person will get half an orange. Therefore, there are 7 x 0.5 = 3.5 oranges left over after sharing them equally among 14 people.;
Response:  We know that there are 28 days in a month and we have to find out how many months it will take for an ordinary person to save $1000. So, let's calculate it as follows: Number of months = Total amount / Monthly income Now, we need to determine the monthly income of an ordinary person. According to various sources, the average monthly salary of an Indian employee is around Rs 35,000 - Rs 40,000 (approximately $500-$600). Therefore, the monthly income of an ordinary person can be assumed to be around Rs 40,000 ($600). Now, let's plug in the values into the formula: Number of months = Total amount / Monthly income Substituting the values, we get: Number of months = $1000 / $600 ≈ 1.67 years or 1 year and 9 months approximately. Therefore, based on the calculation, it will take around 1 year and 9 months for an ordinary person to save $1000 if they deposit $500 every month.;
Response:  We know that there are 17 oranges in total and each orange has 4 segments. So, the number of segments in all is : 17 x 4 = 68 segments. Now we have to find out how many segments are left after giving 25 apples. To do this, we need to subtract the number of apples from the total number of segments. So, the answer is : 68 - 25 = 43 segments.;
Response:  We have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices. So, total number of slices = 9 x 8 = 72 slices. Now, we need to find out how many pieces can be cut from each pizza. Since there are 10 knives, each knife can cut 4 slices (since each slice is 1/4 of a pizza). Therefore, total number of pieces that can be cut = 72 / 4 = 18 pieces per pizza. So, in total, 9 pizzas can provide 9 x 18 = 162 pieces.;
Response:  We know that there are 45 puppets in total and each puppet has 10 fingers. So, the total number of fingers is 45 x 10 = 450 fingers. Now, we need to find out how many more fingers are required to make 1000 fingers. To do this, we subtract the total number of fingers from 1000: 1000 - 450 = 550 fingers. Therefore, there are 550 additional fingers needed to reach 1000 fingers.;
Response:  We know that അവളുടെ അമ്മയെ പൂക്കളെ നട്ടുപിടിപ്പിക്കാന് (the mother of the child has 9 puppies and gives birth to 45 dogs). So, in total, there are 54 puppies (9 + 45 = 54). Now, let's calculate how many dogs each of the 7 mothers will have. Since each mother has 7 puppies, we can conclude that each mother will have 7 x 7 = 49 dogs. Therefore, the answer is 49 dogs.;
Response:  We know that there are 36 fruits in one basket and 12 fruits in another basket. So, the total number of fruits is 36 + 12 = 48 fruits. Now, we have to find out how many fruits are left after 58 fruits were taken away from the baskets. To do this, we need to subtract 58 fruits from the total number of fruits, which is 48 fruits. Therefore, the remaining fruits are 48 - 58 = -10 fruits. So, the correct answer is -10 fruits.;
Response:  We know that there are 55 birds in total and 15 of them are owls. So, the number of birds other than owls is 55 - 15 = 40. Now, we need to find out how many of these birds are not in the tree. Since there are 60 birds in the tree, the number of birds not in the tree is 40 - 60 = -20. Therefore, there are -20 birds not in the tree.;
Response:  We know that the mother has 10 children and each child has 6 siblings. Therefore, there are 10 x 6 = 60 children in total. So, the answer is 60.;
Response:  We are given that there are 8 piles of 32 cards each. So, in total, we have 8 x 32 = 256 cards. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of identical cards are present in these 256 cards. To do this, we can use the fact that every card has a unique number from 1 to 32. Therefore, if two cards have the same number, they are identical. So, we need to count the number of times the same number appears twice in the deck. Since there are 32 cards in each pile, and each pile has 8 cards, the total number of cards with the same number is 8 x 32 = 256 / 8 = 32. Therefore, there are 32 pairs of identical cards in the deck.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 suhurthukkal in Mathyu's house and each of them can hold 2 crackers. So, the total number of crackers that Mathyu can buy is: 11 x 2 = 22 crackers. Therefore, the answer is 22.;
Response:  We have 8 crackers and we need to distribute them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 2 crackers. Now let's assume that there are 2 more people who want to join in and share the remaining crackers. So now we have 10 people (including the original 4) who want to share the 6 remaining crackers. Since there are 10 people, each person will get 0.6 crackers (i.e., 6/10). Therefore, the final answer is 0.6 crackers per person.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many crackers are needed for each of the 15 days and then add them up.  For day 1, we need 5 crackers (as per the question). So, the total number of crackers required for Day 1 is 5. Now, let's move on to Day 2. Since there are 10 crackers in each box, we can take 2 boxes (since we cannot take more than 10 crackers from one box), which means we require 2 x 10 = 20 crackers for Day 2. Similarly, we can calculate the number of crackers required for each of the remaining days as follows: Day 3: 15 crackers; Day 4: 25 crackers; Day 5: 35 crackers; Day 6: 45 crackers; Day 7: 55 crackers; Day 8: 65 crackers; Day 9: 75 crackers; Day 10: 85 crackers; Day 11: 95 crackers; Day 12: 105 crackers; Day 13: 115 crackers; Day 14: 125 crackers; and Day 15: 135 crackers. Therefore, the total number of crackers required for all 15 days is 5 + 20 + 15 + 25 + 35 + 45 + 55 + 65 + 75 + 85 + 95 + 105 + 115 + 125 + 135 = 1500 crackers.";
Response:  We know that there are 24 hours in a day and we have to find out how many crackers can be made using 17 hours of Maathy's time. So, we need to divide 24 by 17 to get the number of crackers that can be made.  Therefore, the answer is 14 crackers (24/17).;
Response:  We have 22 crackers and 34 kites. So, in total we have 56 objects (22 + 34 = 56). Now, out of these 56 objects, 11 are supari (crackers) and 45 are kites (34 + 11 = 45). Therefore, there are 45 kites for every 11 supari.;
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of socks and shoes can be made using 29 pairs of crackers and 30 pairs of keys.  So, we need to divide 29 by 30 to get the number of pairs of socks that can be made.  Therefore, there are 29/30 = 0.97 pairs of socks that can be made using 29 pairs of crackers and 30 pairs of keys.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 20 appears in both sets of numbers given in the question.  Here are the calculations:  Number of times 1 appears in both sets:  Number of times 2 appears in both sets:  Number of times 3 appears in both sets:  Number of times 4 appears in both sets:  Number of times 5 appears in both sets:  Number of times 6 appears in both sets:  Number of times 7 appears in both sets:  Number of times 8 appears in both sets:  Number of times 9 appears in both sets:  Number of times 10 appears in both sets:  Number of times 11 appears in both sets:  Number of times 12 appears in both sets:  Number of times 13 appears in both sets:  Number of times 14 appears in both sets:  Number of times 15 appears in both sets:  Number of times 16 appears in both sets:  Number of times 17 appears in both sets:  Number of times 18 appears in both sets:  Number of times 19 appears in both sets:  Number of times 20 appears in both sets:  Therefore, there are 4 times 1, 3 times 2, 2 times 3, 2 times 4, 1 time 5, 1 time 6, 1 time 7, 1 time 8, 2 times 9, 1 time 10, 1 time 11, 1 time 12, 1 time 13, 1 time 14, and 1 time 15 in both sets of numbers. Similarly, there is only one occurrence of 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 in both sets. So, the total number of common elements between the two sets is:  Common elements = 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 suhurthukkal and 36 crackers in one box. So, if we want to calculate how many boxes of crackers Anu can buy with Rs. 500, we need to divide the cost by the price per box. The price per box is given as Rs. 20. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boxes of crackers Anu can buy as follows: Number of boxes = Cost / Price per box = Rs. 500 / Rs. 20 = 25 boxes.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 crows in the tree of Mr. Mathew. If each crow can eat 36 grains of rice, then how many grains of rice will be eaten by all the crows together? Therefore, the total number of grains of rice eaten by all the crows is 36 x 6 = 216 grains.;
"Response:  The number of days in a month is 30 or 31 (depending on whether it's a leap year). So, if someone has been working for 23 years and 11 months, they have worked for approximately 749 to 850 days (23 x 30 + 11 x 30 = 749; 23 x 31 + 11 x 30 = 850). Now, let's calculate how many times this person has worked on weekends. Since there are 7 days in a week, and we subtracted 11 months from 23 years, that means the person worked for 11 months out of those 23 years. Therefore, the number of weekend days worked during those 11 months is 7 x 7 = 49 days. So, the total number of weekend days worked by this person is 49 + 749 = 898 days.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 crackers in total and out of them, 23 crackers are from the set of 5 supari crackers. So, the number of crackers left after removing the 23 supari crackers is 8 (31 - 23 = 8). Now, we have to find out how many crackers are left with each of the five crackers from the remaining 8 crackers. To do this, we need to divide the total number of crackers left (8) by the number of crackers in each pack (5). Therefore, the number of crackers left with each of the five crackers is 8/5 = 1.6. So, the total number of crackers left with the fifth cracker is 1.6 x 5 = 8 crackers.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the number 32 appears in the given sequence of numbers. We can see that the number 32 appears twice in the sequence, at positions 1 and 4. Therefore, the answer is 2. Next, we need to find out how many times the number 98 appears in the sequence. We can see that the number 98 appears thrice in the sequence, at positions 5, 7, and 9. Therefore, the answer is 3. Finally, we need to add these two answers together to get the total number of times the numbers 32 and 98 appear in the sequence, which is 2 + 3 = 5. So, the answer is 5.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 crackers and 8 kekkucas. So, we have to find out how many of each type of cracker will be left after consuming 5 crackers and 3 kekkucas. To do this, we need to divide the total number of crackers (10) by the number of crackers consumed (5), which gives us 2. Then, we multiply the result by the number of kekkucas consumed (3), which gives us 6. Therefore, after consuming 5 crackers and 3 kekkucas, there will be 2 crackers and 6 kekkucas left.;
Response:  We know that there are 28 suhurthukkal in total and they have to be divided among 13 crackers and 15 kekkucas.  So, we need to divide 28 by 13 and get 2.15 as the number of suhurthukkal each cracker will receive. Similarly, we need to divide 28 by 15 and get 1.8 as the number of suhurthukkal each kekkuca will receive. Now, let's see if these numbers make sense. If we assume that each suhurthukkal is roughly equal to one minute, then we can calculate the duration of each cracker or kekkuca as follows: For crackers: Total time = Number of suhurthukkal x Time per suhurthukkal = 2.15 x 60 = 132 minutes For kekkucas: Total time = Number of suhurthukkal x Time per suhurthukkal = 1.8 x 60 = 108 minutes Based on this calculation, it seems that both crackers and kekkucas will have approximately the same duration - around 132-108 minutes. However, since the exact duration may vary depending on various factors such as the size and shape of the suhurthukkal, the temperature at which they are burned, etc., we cannot provide an exact figure for the duration of either crackers or kekkucas.;
Response:  Debi has 109 cups of coffee in total and she drank 74 cups during one day. So, there are remaining cups of coffee = Total number of cups - Number of cups drunk = 109 - 74 = 35 cups.;
Response:  Debi has 153 balls in total and she throws them one by one. She throws each ball for 7 days straight without taking any break. On the 8th day, there will be no more balls left to throw as all of them have been thrown already. So, the answer is - 8.;
Response:  We know that Debi has 264 balls and she wants to divide them equally among 11 friends. So, we need to find out how many balls each friend will get. To do this, we can use division.  Division is a mathematical operation used to divide one number into equal parts or groups based on a specified number of times. In this case, we are dividing 264 balls by 11 friends, so we need to perform 264 ÷ 11 = 23.636364 balls per friend. Since we cannot have a fraction of a ball, we round off the result to the nearest whole number, which gives us approximately 24 balls per friend. Therefore, Debi will give 11 friends 24 balls each in one day.;
Response:  We know that Debi has 301 balls and wants to divide them equally among 144 people. So, each person will get 2 balls (301/144 = 2). Now, we need to find out how many balls each of the remaining 157 people will get. Since there are only 157 people left, they will get all the remaining balls (301 - 2 x 144 = 157). Therefore, the total number of balls that Debi will give away is 2 + 157 = 159 balls.;
Response:  We have to find out how many days it takes for Debi to complete 88 kuppis and then calculate how many more days it will take her to complete 13 sodukus after that. So, let's first calculate the number of days it takes Debi to complete 88 kuppis. Since she completes 4 kuppis per day, it will take her 22 days (88 / 4 = 22) to complete all 88 kuppis. Now, we need to add the time taken to complete 13 sodukus to this total number of days. As Debi completes 1 sodoku in 6 days, it will take her an additional 79 days (13 x 6 = 79) to complete all 13 sodukus after finishing the 88 kuppis. Therefore, the total number of days it will take Debi to complete both tasks is 22 + 79 = 101 days.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 256 can be divided into 312 and also how many times 4 can be divided into 128. So we need to perform two calculations.

First calculation: How many times 256 can be divided into 312?
We know that 256 / 3 = 84, so 312 / 84 = 3.75. This means that 256 can be divided into 312 exactly 3.75 times.

Second calculation: How many times 4 can be divided into 128?
We know that 4 / 1 = 4, so 128 / 4 = 32. This means that 4 can be divided into 128 exactly 32 times.
Now let's combine both calculations:
3.75 x 32 = 129. So, in one debit of 200 kuppiwalas and 256 sodas, there will be approximately 129 instances of 4 sodas.";
Response:  Debi has 6 cups of tea in total and she drank 3 cups yesterday. So, there are 6 - 3 = 3 cups left with her. Now, if she drinks 1 cup every day for 12 days, then she will have drunk 12 x 1 = 12 cups altogether. Therefore, after 12 days, she will have 3 - 12 = -9 cups left with her.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many days it takes for Debi to complete 95 sodas and 180 bottles of water.  For this, we need to divide the total number of drinks by the number of days available.  So, let's calculate:
Number of days = Total number of drinks / Number of days available
= 95 sodas + 180 bottles of water / 7 days (available)
= 13.56 days (approximately)
So, in approximately 13.56 days, Debi will finish all the drinks she has planned.";
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number of seconds in one day (86400) is divided by the time taken for Debian 360 SOD and Windows 162 Bootloader.  The time taken for Debian 360 SOD is 360 seconds, and that of Windows 162 Bootloader is 162 seconds. Therefore, we can calculate as follows: Number of days = Time taken for Debian 360 SOD / Time taken for Windows 162 Bootloader  Number of days = 360 / 162  Number of days = 2.25 days So, the answer is approximately 2.25 days.;

Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 3 objects in a row among 12 pens.  At first sight, it may seem that there are only 4 ways (1-2-3, 1-3-2, 2-1-3, and 2-3-1). However, notice that order matters here! So, we need to divide this number by 2 since each arrangement has two possible orders (e.g., 1-2-3 can be either ABC or ACA). Therefore, there are actually 2 × 4 = 8 different ways to arrange 3 objects in a row among 12 pens.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Feynman has 16 pens in his pencil case and he uses 28 pens per page. So, the number of pages he can draw with one pen is: Number of pages = Total number of pens / Number of pens used per page = 16 / 28 = 0.57 pages per pen Now, let's calculate how many pens are required to fill one box: Number of boxes = Total number of pens / Number of pens needed for one box = 16 / 0.57 = 28 boxes Therefore, Feynman needs 28 boxes to fill one box with his drawing.;

Response:  We know that there are 7 nights in a week and each night has 4 hours (24 hours / 7 nights). So, we have 7 x 4 = 28 hours of darkness per week. Now, let's calculate how many hours of light there are in a week. There are 168 hours in a week, so we subtract the number of hours of darkness from it to get the total number of hours of light. Therefore, 168 - 28 = 140 hours of light per week.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 horses and 27 dogs in the field. The owner has 31 pens for the cows and 27 crates for the chickens. So, we can conclude that the number of pens required to keep all these animals is 31 + 27 = 58 pens. Therefore, the answer is 58.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 30 pence can go into 5 pounds.  To do this, we divide 5 pounds by 30 pence. So, 5 pounds = 30 x (pence/£). Now, we need to find out what value of 'x' will make 5 pounds equal to 30 pence. Solving for x, we get: £ = 5 / 30 = 166.67 pence per £. Therefore, there are 166.67 pence in every £1.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 pens in Avil's kayak and he has already used 3 of them. So, there are remaining 3 pens left with him. Now, we have to find out how many pens Rony has taken from Avil's kayak. As per the question, Rony took 4 pens from Avil's kayak. Therefore, the number of pens left with Avil is 3 - 4 = 1 pen.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fei has 35 pens and Sal has 4 pens. So, the total number of pens they have is 35 + 4 = 39 pens. Now, let's consider how many pens each person has. Fei has 35 pens, which means he has x pens out of 39 pens. Similarly, Sal has 4 pens, which means he has y pens out of 39 pens. Since both Fei and Sal have different numbers of pens, there must be some common factor between them. Let's find that common factor by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 35 and 4 is 1, so we can divide both numbers by 1 to get the least common multiple (LCM) of 35 and 4, which is 70. Therefore, Fei has 70/x pens and Sal has 70/y pens. Now, we need to find the value of x and y. We know that x + y = 39, since Fei has 35 pens and Sal has 4 pens together. Substituting this equation into the previous one, we get: 70/x + 70/y = 39. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 28 and y = 6. Therefore, Fei has 70/28 = 2.64 pens and Sal has 70/6 = 11.67 pens.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fei has 31 pens and Sal has 6 pens. So, the total number of pens they have together is 31 + 6 = 37 pens. Now, we are told that Fei has more pens than Sal. Therefore, the difference between their numbers of pens is 37 - 6 = 31 pens. Hence, Fei has 31 more pens than Sal.;
Response:  We know that there are 30 days in February and 71 days in April. So, the total number of days between February 1st and April 30th is: 30 + 71 = 101 days. Now, we need to subtract the number of days between February 15th and March 31st from the total number of days: 101 - (24 + 61) = 101 - 85 = 16 days. Therefore, the remaining days after March 31st are: 16 days.;
Response:  We know that there are 16 days in February and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in February is: 16 x 24 = 384 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours are left after subtracting the time spent by Avatar (in minutes) from the total number of hours in February. To do this, we need to convert the time spent by Avatar from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 60 x 5 = 300 minutes (time spent by Avatar). Now, we can calculate the number of hours left as follows: 384 - 300 = 84 hours. Therefore, Avatar had 84 hours left after completing all his tasks.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many classes are there in the college. According to the question, there are 21 classrooms in the college. So, the number of classes = Number of classrooms / Number of students per classroom.  In this case, since there are 98 students and 7 classrooms, the number of classes = 98 / 7 = 14 classes. Therefore, there are 14 classes in the college.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 84 classes in this college. Now, let's assume that each class has an average of 30 students (this is just for calculation purposes and may not be accurate).

Now, we need to convert this amount into cubes. One cup of soda is equal to 8 fluid ounces (fl oz), so one cube of soda is equal to 8 fl oz / 0.25 gallons (gal) = 32 fl oz / gal. Since there are 316 cups of soda in the fridge, the total number of cubes of soda in the fridge is: 316 cups x 32 fl oz/gal = 10,016 fl oz. Finally, since there are 4 cubes per day, the number of cubes that will be left in the fridge after 4 days is: 10,016 fl oz / 4 = 2,504 cubes. Therefore, the answer to the question is 2,504 cubes.;
Response:  We know that there are 57 cups in total and we have to find out how many cups of water each type of soil can hold. Soil A can hold 26 cups of water per cup of soil, Soil B can hold 27 cups of water per cup of soil, and Soil C can hold 31 cups of water per cup of soil. Now let's calculate the number of cups of water each type of soil can hold: For Soil A, it will be 26 x 57 = 1482 cups of water For Soil B, it will be 27 x 57 = 1509 cups of water For Soil C, it will be 31 x 57 = 1757 cups of water Therefore, the total number of cups of water all three types of soil can hold is 1482 + 1509 + 1757 = 5754 cups of water.;
Response:  We have to find out how many liters of water are required for each type of soil based on the given information.  For sandy loam soil, we need 81 cups of water per 1 cubic foot, which is equivalent to 247 liters per cubic meter (since there are 35.3 cubic feet in a cubic meter). So, for 60 cubic meters of sandy loam soil, we need 60 x 247 = 14980 liters of water.  For clayey soil, we need 60 cups of water per 1 cubic foot, which is equivalent to 189 liters per cubic meter (since there are 35.3 cubic feet in a cubic meter). So, for 60 cubic meters of clayey soil, we need 60 x 189 = 11,140 liters of water.  Finally, for loamy soil, we need 60 cups of water per 1 cubic foot, which is equivalent to 189 liters per cubic meter (since there are 35.3 cubic feet in a cubic meter). So, for 60 cubic meters of loamy soil, we need 60 x 189 = 11,140 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water required for all three types of soil is 14980 + 11,140 + 11,140 = 35,260 liters.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 49 goes into 100 and also how many times 40 goes into 80.  So, we need to divide both numbers by their common divisor which is 10.  Now, let's see... 49 / 10 = 5 and 40 / 10 = 4.  Great! Now we know that 49 goes into 100 exactly 5 times and 40 goes into 80 exactly 4 times.  But wait, there's more! We are asked about the remaining amount after subtracting the number of times it divides from the total. In this case, the remaining amount after subtracting 5 times 49 from 100 is 5 × 49 = 245 and the remaining amount after subtracting 4 times 40 from 80 is 4 × 40 = 160.  So, the answer is (245 + 160) / 2 = 405 / 2 = 202.5.;

Response:  We know that there are 703 people in the group and they have been invited for 25 days. So, the total number of invitations is 703 x 25 = 17550. Now, we need to find out how many people will be attending each day. To do this, we divide the total number of invitations by the number of days (25). Therefore, the average number of attendees per day is 17550 / 25 = 709.;
Response:  We are given that there are 666 sanadhikars in the bank and each of them has to attend the meeting once every 10 days. So, the total number of meetings attended by all the sanadhikars is : 666 x 10 = 6660 meetings. Now, we are asked how many times each sanadharkar will attend the meeting if it lasts for 10 days. Since there are 666 sanadhikars, each one will attend the meeting 666/10 = 66 times. Therefore, the answer is 66.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 132 people who attended the party and 406 people in total participated in the dance competition. So, the percentage of people who danced is (406/132) x 100 = 308%. Therefore, approximately 308 out of every 100 people who attended the party danced.;
Response:  We know that there are 45 people in the group who have not taken any break and they will take a break of 30 minutes each day for 8 days. So, total time spent by them without work is : 45 x 30 = 1350 minutes. Now, we need to find out how many more minutes they will spend working after their break. Since they have worked for 8 hours per day, total work done by them is: 8 x 8 = 64 hours. Therefore, total time spent by these 45 people working is: 1350 - 64 = 1286 minutes.Now, let's calculate the average time spent by all 85 people including those who took breaks. Total time spent by all 85 people working is: 829 + 1286 = 2115 minutes. Average time spent by all 85 people = Total time spent / Number of people = 2115 / 85 = 25.37 hours.So, the answer is 25.37 hours.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 71 people in the group who have not taken any vaccine doses so far. Now, out of these 71 people, how many will take the vaccine dose for the first time?

Therefore, the answer is -486.;
Response:  We know that there are 39 permanent teeth in the mouth of an adult human being.  Of these, 8 are wisdom teeth (4 upper and 4 lower). So, the total number of teeth in the mouth is 39 + 8 = 47. Now, we need to find out how many teeth are present in each jaw. In the upper jaw, there are 20 teeth (8 canines, 8 premolars, and 4 molars), while in the lower jaw, there are 22 teeth (8 canines, 8 premolars, and 4 molars). Therefore, the total number of teeth in both jaws is 20 + 22 = 42. Finally, if we subtract the number of teeth in the upper jaw from the total number of teeth, we get 42 - 20 = 22 as the number of teeth in the lower jaw. So, the answer to the question is 22.;
Response:  We know that there are 92 people who have been to Bhutan and returned. Out of them, 419 people have visited Bhutan at least once. So, the number of people who have not visited Bhutan is 419 - 92 = 327. Therefore, among the remaining 327 people, 103 have visited Bhutan at least once. Hence, the percentage of people who have visited Bhutan among those who have not visited it is (103/327) x 100% = 31.6%.;
Response:  We know that there are 512 boxes in the container and each box contains 89 balls. So, the total number of balls in the container is 512 x 89 = 46,356. Now, we need to find out how many balls are left after 471 dives. To do this, we subtract the number of balls used during each dive from the total number of balls. The number of balls used during each dive is given as 808 - 471 = 337. Therefore, the number of balls left after 471 dives is 46,356 - 337 = 45,999. Finally, we add the number of balls left after 89 dives (which is equal to 45,999) to get the final answer of 45,999 + 45,999 = 91,998.;
Response:  We know that there are 705 sanadhikars in the first division and 457 of them attended the meeting on that day. So, the number of sanadhikars who did not attend the meeting is 705 - 457 = 248. Now, we need to find out how many of these 248 sanadhikars were absent from the previous 245 divisional meetings. So, the number of absentees from those meetings is 248 / 245 = 10. Therefore, among the 705 sanadhikars, 10 did not attend any of the previous 245 divisional meetings.;
Response:  We know that the number of students in List A is 159 and they have taken 628 vacancies. So, we need to find out how many vacancies each student has taken.

Response:  We know that there are 49 weeks in an academic year and each week has 7 days. So, the total number of days in an academic year is 49 x 7 = 343 days. Now, we need to find out how many days are left after subtracting the number of vacation days from the total number of days in an academic year. According to the question, there are 288 days of vacation in an academic year, so we can subtract this amount from the total number of days to get the remaining days. Therefore, the number of days left after deducting the vacation days from the total number of days in an academic year is 343 - 288 = 55 days. So, Avani has 55 days left for her vacation.;
Response:  We know that the total number of vacancies is 57 and Avani has already taken 22 vacancies. So, there are remaining vacancies = Total number of vacancies - Number of vacancies taken by Avani = 57 - 22 = 35. Now, we need to find out how many more vacancies Avani can take to reach her target of 40 vacancies. To do this, we divide the remaining vacancies by the number of vacancies she wants to take = 35 / 4 = 8.75. Since we cannot have a fraction of a vacancy, let's round it off to the nearest whole number which is 9. Therefore, Avani can take up to 9 additional vacancies to reach her target of 40 vacancies.;
Response:  We know that the number of vacations in Kerala is 166 grams and Avnish wants to know how many grams of vacation he will get if he pays 20 grams of tax. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of grams of vacation = Total weight of vacation - Weight of tax paid (in grams) In this case, the total weight of vacation is 166 grams, and Avnish has paid 20 grams of tax, so the number of grams of vacation he will get is: Number of grams of vacation = 166 grams - 20 grams = 146 grams Therefore, Avnish will get 146 grams of vacation.;
Response:  We know that Avnish has 557 grams of vacuum in his stomach and he wants to reduce it to 17 grams. So, we need to find out how many times he can divide this amount to achieve the desired weight loss.  Divide 557 grams by 17 grams per day = 32.6 days Now, let's round off the result to the nearest whole number. Since there are 30 days in a month, Avnish will be able to lose approximately 30 * 32.6 = 972 grams of fat in one month. Therefore, the answer is 972 grams.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 vacancies for which Vasu is eligible and he has already applied for 4 of them. So, the number of vacancies remaining after Vasu applies for those 4 vacancies is 11 - 4 = 7. Now, we need to find out how many more vacancies Vasu can apply for considering his age limit of 49 years. As per the question, Vasu can work till the age of 60 years, so he has got 11 years left to work. Therefore, the maximum number of vacancies Vasu can apply for is 7 x 11 = 77 vacancies. Hence, the answer is 77.;
Response:  We know that there are 94 Munthiririyat workers and they have to work for 6 days continuously. So, the total number of working days is 94 x 6 = 576. Now, we need to find out how many bakkers each worker can make in one day. According to the question, each worker makes 8-10 bakers per day. Therefore, the total number of bakers made by all the workers in one day is 576 / 8 = 73 bakers. So, after 6 days, the total number of bakers made is 73 x 6 = 428 bakers.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 365 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if someone works for 90 days continuously without any break, they will have worked for a total of 90 x 24 = 2160 hours. Now, let's calculate how many minutes this person has worked in those 90 days. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2160 hours is equal to 2160 x 60 = 130720 minutes. Finally, we need to convert these minutes into seconds. There are 60 seconds in one minute, so 130720 minutes is equal to 130720 x 60 = 78566400 seconds. Therefore, the answer to the question is 78566400 seconds.;

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 74 aquariums in total and out of them, 22 are empty. So, the number of filled aquariums is 74 - 22 = 52. Now, let's consider the number of turtles in each aquarium. We know that there are 46 turtles in total, so the number of turtles in each aquarium is 46 / 52 = 0.89 (approximately). Therefore, more than half of the aquariums have at least one turtle.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the number 15 appears in the given set of numbers. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each digit from 0 to 4 (since there are only 4 digits).  From the given list, we see that the number 1 occurs 3 times, the number 5 occurs 7 times, and the number 4 occurs 2 times. Therefore, the total number of times the digit 1 appears is 3 + 7 = 10, and the total number of times the digit 5 appears is 7 + 7 = 14. Similarly, the total number of times the digit 4 appears is 2 + 2 = 4. So, the total number of times any of these digits appear is 10 + 14 + 4 = 28. Now, let's count the number of times the number 6 appears in the list. We know that 6 - 1 = 5, since 1 is already accounted for as one of the digits mentioned above. Therefore, the number of times the digit 6 appears is 5. Finally, let's calculate the average of all the numbers in the list. To do this, we add up all the numbers and divide by the total number of numbers in the list. In this case, the sum of all the numbers is 15 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 26, and the total number of numbers in the list is 4 (the number of digits) x 10 (the number of numbers in each group). Therefore, the average of all the numbers in the list is 26 / 4 = 6.5.;

So, we have: Group 1: 4 mice x 3 = 12 mice Group 2: 4 mice x 3 = 12 mice Group 3: 15 mice Now, let's find out how many mice are there in all the groups combined: Total number of mice = Number of mice in group 1 + Number of mice in group 2 + Number of mice in group 3 = 12 + 12 + 15 = 49 mice Therefore, there are 49 mice in all the groups combined.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 years old kids and 72 grandkids. So, the total number of descendants (grandkids + great-grandkids) is 66. Therefore, the number of generations between Rebecca and her youngest descendant is: $ \text{Number of Generations} = \frac{\text{Age of Youngest Descendant}}{\text{Age of Rebecca}} $ $\text{= }$ $\frac{66}{18}$ $\text{= }$ 3.75$ \text{ Generations}$.$;
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 keys and 9 mice. Each key can open one lock, and each mouse can fit through one hole. So, the total number of locks that Rebecca can open with her keys is 99 / 1 = 99. Similarly, the total number of holes that the mice can go through is 9 / 1 = 9. Now, let's consider the remaining 27 coins. Since there are 27 coins, we can assume that they are all different from each other. Therefore, the number of unique combinations of coins that Rebecca can make using these coins is 27! = 3628800. So, the final answer is: Number of locks Rebecca can open = 99; Number of holes the mice can go through = 9; Unique combinations of coins Rebecca can make = 3628800.";
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 hats and 6 scarves. So, we have to find out how many more scarves she needs to make 30 in total. To do this, we need to subtract the number of scarves she already has (6) from the total number of items she needs (30). Therefore, Rebecca needs 24 more scarves (30 - 6 = 24).;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 dogs and 12 cats. So, in total, she has 5 + 12 = 17 pets. Now, we are asked how many more dogs Rebecca has than cats. Since Rebecca has 5 dogs and 12 cats, she has 5 - 12 = -7 cats (negative means more dogs than cats). Therefore, Rebecca has 7 more dogs than cats.;
Response:  We know that there are 154 triangles in total and each triangle has 3 sides. So, the number of sides is 154 x 3 = 462. Now, we need to find out how many sides have 11 or more sides. From the question, we know that 11 triangles have 11 or more sides. Therefore, the number of sides with 11 or more sides is 11 / 3 = 3.77 triangles (since rounding up gives us an integer). So, the remaining 459 - 3 = 456 triangles have fewer than 11 sides.;
Response:  We know that there are 177 roons in one rajju and Rajju has 46 poyins. So, we can calculate the number of poyins in each rajju as follows: Number of poyins in each rajju = Total number of poyins / Number of rajjus Therefore, the number of poyins in each rajju is 46/177 = 0.2635.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 84 is divisible by 7 and also how many times 7 is divisible by 84. So we can write as follows: 84 / 7 = x where x is an integer. Now we know that 84 is divisible by 7 exactly 12 times (since 12 x 7 = 84). Similarly, we can write: 7 / 84 = y where y is an integer. Now we know that 7 is divisible by 84 exactly 9 times (since 9 x 84 = 763, which is not equal to 0). Therefore, the answer is 12 + 9 = 21.;
"Response:  We know that there are 146 triangles in one row of the grid. So, if we want to find out how many triangles are present in all rows together, we need to multiply the number of triangles in each row by the total number of rows. Therefore, the total number of triangles in all rows is:

Number of triangles = Number of triangles in each row x Total number of rows
= 146 x (Number of rows - 1)

Since there are 157 rectangles in one row of the grid, and we have already found out that there are 146 triangles in each row, we can conclude that there are:

Total number of triangles = Number of rectangles in each row x Total number of rows
= 157 x (Number of rows - 1)

So, the answer is 1570 triangles.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three types of triangles - equilateral, isosceles and scalene. So, out of these three options, one triangle will have all equal sides (equilateral). Now, let's count the number of sides for each type of triangle: Equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides Isosceles triangle has 2 equal sides Scalene triangle has no equal sides Therefore, option A (equilateral) has 3 equal sides, while options B and C have none. So, the correct answer is Option A - an equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides.;

Response:  Emili has 8 necks and each neck has 16 moles. So, in total, Emili has 8 x 16 = 128 moles.;
Response:  Emily has 18 necklaces and 6 belly buttons. So, there are 18 + 6 = 24 holes in total. Now, let's assume that each hole can hold only one necklace. Therefore, the maximum number of necklaces Emily can wear is 24 / 1 = 24.;
Response:  Emili has 5 necks and each neck has 4 holes. So, in total, Emili has 5 x 4 = 20 holes.;
Response:  Emili has 72 suhrittus (necklaces) and each necklace contains 6 beads. So, in total, she has 432 beads. Now, let's calculate how many more beads are needed to make 108 neklaces. We need 108 - 432 = -324 beads. Since we can't have negative beads, there are 324 beads less than what Emili has now. Therefore, Emili needs 324 more beads to make 108 necklaces.;
Response:  Emily has 43 necklaces and she gave 5 of them to her friend. So, now Emily has 43 - 5 = 38 necklaces left.  Out of these 38 necklaces, 20 are from Orso's collection. Therefore, the number of necklaces that Orso has is 20.;
Response:  Emili has 44 suhrittus (toys). Out of these, she has given 26 toys to her nephew. So, there are 18 toys left with her. Now, out of these 18 toys, she has given 2 to her brother. So, there are 16 toys left with her after giving them to her brother. Therefore, Emili has 16 toys left.;
Response:  We know that there are 819058 students in Loorans college and 668278 of them have already taken the examination. So, the number of students who haven't taken the exam yet is 819058 - 668278 = 150830. Therefore, out of the total 150830 students, 40% (i.e., 60132) have not taken the exam yet.;
Response:  We know that there are 202958 students in Loorans college and each student has to pay Rs 100 as examination fee. So, the total amount of money collected from all the students is 202958 x Rs 100 = Rs 20295800. Now, we need to find out how many students can be accommodated in one batch if the college wants to collect Rs 77762200 as revenue from examination fees. To do this, we divide the required revenue with the cost per student: Rs 77762200 / Rs 100 = 777622 students. Therefore, more than 777622 students can be accommodated in one batch if the college wants to collect Rs 77762200 as revenue from examination fees.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 898051 students in Loorans School. Now, if each student has to carry 629424 books, then the total number of books carried by all the students will be 898051 x 629424 = 537235280 books. So, the remaining books after some students have finished their homework will be 537235280 - 629424 = 530943256 books. Therefore, the number of books left behind by the students who did not finish their homework is 530943256.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 313,473 students in Loorans School. Now, we need to find out how many of them will be left after 2 years. To do this, we divide the total number of students by 2. So, the number of students who will be left after 2 years is: 313,473 / 2 = 156,736 Therefore, there will be 156,736 students left in the school after 2 years.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 907611 students in Loorans School and 455682 of them are from Kamalipillai Campus. So, the number of students from other campuses is 907611 - 455682 = 451839.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are there in Loorans School. According to the question, there are 800059 students in Loorans School. Now, we have to find out how many of them are from Koothupalliyil. The question states that 828521 students are from Koothupalliyil. So, the number of students who are not from Koothupalliyil is 800059 - 828521 = -46766. Therefore, the answer is -46766.;
Response:  We know that there are 61619 kuttis in Loorans' house and each kutti has an egg inside it. So, the total number of eggs in Loorans' house is 61619 x 1 = 61619 eggs. Now, we need to find out how many eggs are left after Bakkiyu's visit. According to the question, Bakkiyu took away 91676 eggs from Loorans' house. So, the remaining eggs in Loorans' house after Bakkiyu's visit are 61619 - 91676 = -30057 eggs.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 34044 kuttis in Konni and 134867 kuttis in Bakki. So, the total number of kuttis in both places together is 34044 + 134867 = 168911 kuttis. Now, out of these 168911 kuttis, 424944 kuttis are in Kondotti. Therefore, the remaining kuttis in Kondotti after subtracting the kuttis in Bakki are 424944 - 134867 = 290077 kuttis.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 610769 students in Loorans School and 590796 of them have passed the examination. So, the number of students who did not pass is 22 (610769 - 590796). Therefore, the answer is 22.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 644997 kudamikals in Loorans. Now, out of these, how many kudamikals are present in Kampili? We can see from the question that 893835 kudamikals are present in Kampili. So, the number of kudamikals present in Kampili is 893835 - 78 = 885457. Therefore, the number of kudamikals present in Loorans is 644997 + 885457 = 1530454 kudamikals.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 apples in one jar and 9 jars in total. So, the number of apples in all jars together is: 3 x 9 = 27 apples. Therefore, there are 27 apples in all the jars combined.;

Response:  We know that there are 9 apples in one jar and 10 apples in another jar. So, if we combine both jars, there will be a total of 9 + 10 = 19 apples. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 19 apples.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 apples in total and 8 of them are red. So, we have to find out how many apples are not red. To do this, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of non-red apples = Total number of apples - Number of red apples = 10 - 8 = 2.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 apples in one jar and 4 apples in another jar. So, altogether we have 6 + 4 = 10 apples. Therefore, there are 10 more apples in the other jar than in the first jar.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 apples in the basket and 3 oranges in the bag. So, the total number of fruits is 7 + 3 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 fruits in the basket and the bag combined.;
"Response:  We know that there are 12 apples in the basket and we want to find out how many apples are left after 8 of them are taken out. So, the number of apples left is:

12 - 8 = 4

So, there are 4 apples left in the basket after taking out 8 of them.";
Response:  We know that there are 4 apples in one jar and 10 jars in total. So, the number of apples in all the jars together is: 4 x 10 = 40 apples. Therefore, there are 40 apples in all the jars combined.;
Response:  We know that there are 89 jacks and 11 apples in the basket. So, we have to find out how many apples each jack can hold. Since each jack can hold 3 apples, we can calculate the total number of apples each jack can hold as follows: Number of apples each jack can hold = Total number of apples / Number of jacks = 11 / 89 = 0.125 or 1/8. Therefore, each jack can hold approximately 1/8 of an apple.;
Response:  We know that Helena has 31 cups of rice in her house and she wants to distribute them equally among all the people who come to her home for dinner. So, if there are x number of people coming for dinner, each person will get 31/x cups of rice.  Now, we also know that Ravil is coming at 6 PM and he will have 270 cups of rice. So, after Ravil comes, Helena will have 31 - 270 = -239 cups of rice left.  But then, Munu comes at 8 PM and he brings 419 cups of rice with him. So, after Munu comes, Helena will have 419 + (-239) = 179 cups of rice left. Therefore, the answer is 179 cups of rice.;
Response:  We know that Helena has 90 chocolates in her bag and each chocolate weighs 51 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all the chocolates she has is: 90 x 51 = 4590 grams. Now, we are asked how many more chocolates Helena needs to have to make the total weight equal to 484 chocolates. So, we need to subtract the total weight of the chocolates she already has from 484: 484 - 4590 = -4106 grams. Therefore, Helena needs 4106 more chocolates to make the total weight equal to 484 chocolates.;
Response:  We know that there are 527 chocolate cakes and 86 rice cakes in Helena's bag.  Since each chocolate cake has 3 layers and each rice cake has 2 layers, we can calculate the total number of layers as follows:  Number of chocolate cakes = 527 Layers per chocolate cake = 3 Total number of layers from chocolate cakes = 1571 Number of rice cakes = 86 Layers per rice cake = 2 Total number of layers from rice cakes = 172 Now, let's add up all the layers from both types of cakes: Total number of layers = 1571 + 172 = 1743 Therefore, Helena has at least 1743 layers of cake in her bag.;
"Response:  We know that there are 144 chocolate kisses in one Helena box and 397 resin kisses in another Helena box. So, if we want to find out how many more resin kisses are in one Helena box than in another, we can subtract the number of chocolate kisses in one Helena box from the number of resin kisses in another:

Number of resin kisses in one Helena box - Number of chocolate kisses in one Helena box = 397 - 144 = 253
So, there are 253 more resin kisses in one Helena box than in another.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helena has 19 chocolates in her bag and each chocolate contains 5 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of chocolate she has is 19 x 5 = 95 pieces.  Now, we are told that there are 231 Reese's Pieces in the bag and each Reese's Piece contains 4 peanuts. Therefore, the total number of peanuts in the bag is 231 x 4 = 864 peanuts.  Finally, we are asked how many more peanuts are there in the bag than chocolate pieces. To find this, we subtract the number of chocolate pieces from the number of peanuts: 864 - 95 = 769 peanuts.  So, there are 769 more peanuts in the bag than chocolate pieces.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many helmets are available in total. From the given information, there are 197 helmets for men and 46 helmets for women, so the total number of helmets is 197 + 46 = 243. Now, we need to find out how many helmets are left after distributing them among the people who want to buy them. According to the question, 75 people from Ravipuram want to buy helmets, and 66 people from Kuttanad want to buy helmets. So, the total number of people who want to buy helmets is 75 + 66 = 141. To find out how many helmets are left after distributing them among these people, we can divide the total number of helmets by the number of people who want to buy them: 243 / 141 = 1.71 helmets per person. Therefore, there will be approximately 1.71 helmets left after distributing them among all the people who want to buy them.;
Response:  We know that there are 519 chocolate cakes and 300 rice cakes in Helena's bag.  Since we don't know how many of each type of cake Helena has, let's assume that she has an equal number of both types of cakes (i.e., 519/2 = 259).  Therefore, the total number of cakes Helena has is 259 + 300 = 559.  Now, let's consider the situation at Ravil's place.  We know that there are 280 rice cakes and 359 chocolate cakes at Ravil's residence.  Again, since we don't know how many of each type of cake Ravil has, let's assume that he has an equal number of both types of cakes (i.e., 280/2 = 140).  Therefore, the total number of cakes Ravil has is 140 + 359 = 499.  So, to answer your question, the difference between the number of cakes Helena has and the number of cakes Ravil has is: 499 - 559 = -60.;
Response:  Kerala has 81 districts and each district has 59 gram panchayats. So, in total, there are 4695 gram panchayats in Kerala (81 x 59 = 4695). Therefore, the number of grama panchayat chairmen in Kerala is 4695.;
Response:  We know that 91 - 88 = 23. So, there are 23 more geese than ducks. Now, we need to find out how many goose eggs are equivalent to 53 duck eggs. To do this, we can divide 53 by 8 (since there are 8 duck eggs in each group). This gives us approximately 6.625 geese eggs equal to 53 duck eggs. Therefore, the farmer has 23 + 6.625 = 29.625 geese eggs more than he had duck eggs.;
Response:  We know that there are 78 small balls and 86 large balls in total. So, the number of small balls is 78/2 = 39. Since each small ball has 48 small marbles inside it, the total number of small marbles is 39 x 48 = 1792. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1792.;
Response:  We know that there are 84 small balls and 19 large balls in total. So, the number of small balls is 84/2 = 42. And the number of large balls is 19. Now, we need to find out how many more small balls than large balls are there. So, let's subtract the number of large balls from the total number of small balls: 42 - 19 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 more small balls than large balls.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 62 boys and 80 girls in Kerala. So, the total number of students is 62 + 80 = 142. Now, let's find out how many more boys than girls are studying in the school. We can do this by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students: 142 - 80 = 62. Therefore, there are 62 more boys than girls studying in the school.;
Response:  Kerala has 14 districts and each district has approximately 4-5 taluks. So, there are around 56-70 taluks in Kerala (Note: The exact number of taluks in Kerala is not available). Now, let's assume that each taluk has an average of 20-25 gram panchayats. Therefore, the total number of gram panchayats in Kerala would be around 1120-1300 (Note: Again, the exact number of gram panchayats in Kerala is not available). Now, if we consider that each gram panchayat has an average of 5-6 villages, then the total number of villages in Kerala would be around 5600-6800 (Note: This is also an approximate value as the actual number of villages in Kerala varies from place to place). Finally, if we multiply the total number of villages with the number of people living in those villages, we get the estimated population of Kerala. Based on the census data provided earlier, this would give us an estimate of around 3.6 crore people living in Kerala (Note: This is again an approximate value as the actual population of Kerala may vary slightly based on various factors such as migration patterns etc.). So, the answer to your question is around 3.6 crore people live in Kerala.;
Response:  Kerala has 57 districts and 39 taluks. So, there are 57 x 39 = 2167 revenue villages in Kerala. Now, let's assume that each revenue village has an average of 34 gazetted officers (including panchayat presidents). Therefore, the total number of gazetted officers in Kerala is 2167 x 34 = 70,888.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 60 students in Fredin's class and 19 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the class is 60 - 19 = 41. Now, out of these 41 boys, 33 of them have cars. Therefore, the number of boys who do not have cars is 41 - 33 = 8.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 86 dollars and Jessie has 5 dollars. So, the total amount of money they have is 86 + 5 = 91 dollars. Now, there are 9 cars in the parking lot, and each car costs $3000. Therefore, the total cost of all the cars in the parking lot is 9 x $3000 = $27,000. Since Fred has 91 dollars, he cannot buy any car. But Jessie has only 5 dollars, so she can buy one car worth $3000 - $5 = $2995.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 40 dogs and Jessica has 69 dogs. So, the total number of dogs owned by both is 40 + 69 = 109 dogs. Now, let's calculate the average age of all these dogs. The sum of ages of all the dogs owned by both Fred and Jessica is 40 x 15 + 69 x 12 = 370 years. Therefore, the average age of all the dogs owned by both Fred and Jessica is 370 / 109 = 3.35 years.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 114 dogs and Jessie has 22 dogs. So, the total number of dogs owned by both is 136 (114 + 22). Now, let's calculate the average age of each dog based on their respective numbers. For Fred, the average age can be calculated as follows: Average Age = Total Number of Dogs x Age per Dog / Total Value of Dogs  Average Age = 136 x 5.5 / 1000 = 7.3 years Therefore, the average age of Fred's dogs is approximately 7.3 years. Similarly, for Jessie, the calculation would be: Average Age = Total Number of Dogs x Age per Dog / Total Value of Dogs  Average Age = 136 x 3.5 / 1000 = 5.9 years Therefore, the average age of Jessie's dogs is approximately 5.9 years.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has Rs 111 and Jessica has Rs 40. So, their total money is Rs 151 (Fred's amount + Jessica's amount). Now, there are 115 dogs in the forest, and each dog costs Rs 20. Therefore, the total cost of buying all the dogs is Rs 2300 (115 x Rs 20). However, since Jessica cannot afford to buy all the dogs, she can only buy 44 dogs, which costs her Rs 880 (44 x Rs 20). So, the remaining amount that Fred needs to pay for the rest of the dogs is Rs 1420 (Rs 2300 - Rs 880).;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many students are there in Fred's class. According to the question, there are 49 students in Fred's class. Now, let's find out how many students are there in Jessica's class. As per the question, there are 3 students in Jessica's class. So, the total number of students in both classes is 49 + 3 = 52 students. Therefore, the answer is 52.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $78 and Jessica has $31. So, their total money is $78 + $31 = $109. Now, they have to share this amount equally among themselves, so each of them will get $\frac{109}{2} = 54$. Therefore, the answer is $54$.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 33 dogs and 95 cats. So, in total, he has 128 pets (33 x 4 = 132). Now, let's calculate how many kennels are required to accommodate all these pets. Since each kennel can hold 7 dogs or 4 cats, we need at least 16 kennels for dogs and 74 kennels for cats. Therefore, Fred needs a minimum of 23 kennels (16 + 74) to house all his pets comfortably.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 47 frogs in a group and each frog lays 99 eggs. So, the total number of eggs laid by all the frogs is: 47 x 99 = 4563 eggs. Now, let's consider how many eggs hatched successfully. As per the question, out of 111 eggs, only 34 hatched successfully. Therefore, the number of unhatched eggs is: 87 (111 - 34). So, the final answer is: 4563 - 87 = 4476 eggs.;
Response:  Jessie has 71 kilograms of rice and she wants to distribute it equally among 20 people. So, each person will get 356 grams (71/20) of rice. Therefore, Jessie's weight loss is 356 grams.;
Response:  Jessie is 27 years old and has a height of 101 kilograms. If we calculate her BMI (Body Mass Index), it would be around 35.6, which falls under the obese category. So, Jessie needs to reduce her weight to maintain a healthy lifestyle.;
Response:  Jessie has 126 kg of rice and wants to distribute it equally among 66 people. So, each person will get  __________ kg of rice. (Answer: 126/66 = 1.87);
"Response:  Jessie is 35 years old and has a height of 170 cm (which is approximately equal to 67 inches). Now, let's calculate her BMI (Body Mass Index) using the formula: BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters) squared. Since we don't have Jessie's weight in kilograms, let's assume it's around 60 kg (based on an average female weight for someone who is 170 cm tall). So, now we can plug in the values into the formula: BMI = 60 kg / (1.7 m)^2 = approximately 24.8. Therefore, Jessie's BMI falls under the ""normal"" category, which ranges from 18.5 to 24.9.";
Response:  Jessie has 114 kilograms of weight and wants to lose 50 kilograms. So, she needs to reduce her weight by 50 - 114 = 64 kilograms. Now, let's calculate how many days it will take for Jessie to reach her target weight of 60 kilograms if she reduces her weight at a rate of 64 kilograms per day. We know that there are 365 days in a year, so we can divide the total weight reduction (64 kg) by the number of days (365 days): 64 kg / 365 days = 0.18 kg/day Therefore, it will take Jessie approximately 365 days or 1 year to reach her target weight of 60 kilograms if she reduces her weight at a rate of 0.18 kg/day.;
Response:  Jessie has 9 kilograms of rice and wants to distribute it equally among 62 people. So, each person will get 9/62 = 0.145 (approximately) kilograms of rice. Now, let's consider the case where there are 140 people instead of 62. In this scenario, each person will get 9/140 = 0.064 (approximately) kilograms of rice. Therefore, based on the given information, the difference in the amount of rice each person gets is 0.145 - 0.064 = 0.081 kilograms.;
Response:  Jessie has 92 kilograms of gold and wants to divide it equally among all his friends. Each friend gets 56 kilograms of gold in the first round, leaving him with 36 kilograms (99 - 56 = 43). In the second round, he gives each friend an additional 10 kilograms of gold, so each friend now has 66 kilograms (56 + 10 = 66) and Jessie is left with 7 kilograms (43 - 66 = -33). Therefore, the difference between the amount of gold Jessie had initially and the amount he has after dividing it among all his friends is 33 kilograms.;
Response:  We know that there are 95 pampuks and 61 muthalaks in the shala. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pampuks = Total number of students x Percentage of students who got more than 60 marks  In this case, the total number of students is 95, and the percentage of students who got more than 60 marks is 64/95 = 0.67 (or approximately 64%). Now, we need to find out how many pampuks got more than 60 marks. Using the above equation, we can write: Number of pampuks = 95 x 0.67 = 63.25 pampuks Therefore, there are approximately 63 pampuks who got more than 60 marks in the shala.;
Response:  We know that there are 93 pampukal and 97 sravukal in the school. Out of these, 40 sravukal have been given to the students. So, the remaining number of sravukal is 97 - 40 = 57. Therefore, the answer is 57.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 large ponds and 75 small ponds in the area. So, the total number of water bodies is 3 + 75 = 78. Now, we need to find out how many medium-sized ponds (82) are present in the area. Since each medium-sized pond can have up to 4 small ponds around it, the total number of small ponds near each medium-sized pond is 4. Therefore, the total number of small ponds nearby is 82 x 4 = 328. Finally, since each small pond has only one savala, the total number of savalas in the area is 328.;
Response:  We know that there are 79 mrigas in total and they have 24 paamukas and 51 sraavukas. So, we can calculate the number of each type of creature as follows: Number of Paamukas = Total number of creatures x Number of paamukas per creature Number of Sraavukas = Total number of creatures x Number of sraavukas per creature Now, let's substitute the values we know into these formulas: Number of Paamukas = 79 x 24 = 1860 Number of Sraavukas = 79 x 51 = 4039 Therefore, there are 1860 paamukas and 4039 sraavukas among the 79 mrigas.;
Response:  We know that there are 171 trees in total and among them, 134 have 5 branches and 30 have 7 branches. So, the number of trees with exactly 3 branches is (134 - 5) = 89. Therefore, the answer is 89.;
Response:  We have 160 tulips and we need to divide them equally among 56 people. So each person will get 3 tulips (160/56). Now, we are left with 41 tulips which we want to distribute equally among 41 people. So each person will get 1 tulip (41/41). Therefore, the answer is 3 for the first group of 56 people and 1 for the second group of 41 people.;
Response:  We have to find out how many people are there in total and then calculate the percentage of people who are over 60 years old.  So, let's first calculate the total number of people:  Total Number of People = 90 x 154 = 13,660  Now, we need to find out how many people are over 60 years old:  Number of People Over 60 Years Old = 50 / 13,660 = 0.037 (or 3.7%) Therefore, approximately 3.7% of the people are over 60 years old.;
Response:  We have 175 tulips and 77 urchins.  Since each tulip has 3 petals, we can say that there are 175 x 3 = 525 petals in total. Now, each urchin eats 4 petals, so they will eat 77 x 4 = 308 petals altogether. So, there will be 525 - 308 = 217 petals left after the urchins finish eating them.;
Response:  We know that there are 177 tiles in total and 12 of them are broken. So, we have 165 usable tiles (177 - 12 = 165). Now, out of these 165 tiles, 53 are already placed on the roof. So, we have 112 unplaced tiles left (165 - 53 = 112). Therefore, the number of tiles that the person has to place is 112.;
Response:  We have 105 pacha tulunni and 71 chuvannu tulunni. So, we can make 137 tulunni using these two types of rice. Now, let's assume that out of these 137 tulunni, 42 are bakkiyas (which is an average number). Therefore, the remaining 95 tulunni will be left after Bakkia is removed, which means 95 / 4 = 23.75 Bakkias.;

Response:  We know that there are 13 valves in the engine and we need to find out how many of them are used for each cylinder. So, let's count the number of valves used for each cylinder.  From the given information, we can see that the first four cylinders use two valves each, which means they have a total of eight valves (2 x 4 = 8). Similarly, the next seven cylinders also use two valves each, which means they have a total of 14 valves (2 x 7 = 14). Therefore, the total number of valves used for all 13 cylinders is 8 + 14 = 22 valves. Now, coming to the last part of the question, we are asked how many valves are used for the remaining three cylinders. Since these cylinders are not mentioned separately among the 13 cylinders listed earlier, it implies that they share the same valves as the other cylinders. Therefore, we can assume that these three cylinders also have 2 valves each, which means they have a total of six valves (2 x 3 = 6). So, the total number of valves used for all 16 cylinders is 22 + 6 = 28 valves.;

Response:  We have to find out how many shirts can fit in one minute.  Firstly, we need to calculate the area of one shirt. Length and breadth of each shirt are given as 60 cm and 45 cm respectively. Area of one shirt = length x breadth = 60 x 45 = 2700 square centimeters. Now, we need to convert this area into square meters. There are 100 square centimeters in one square meter. So, area of one shirt in square meters = 2700 / 100 = 0.027 square meters. Now, we need to find out how many shirts can fit in one minute. Minute is equal to 60 seconds. So, number of shirts that can fit in one minute = area of one shirt / area of one second = 0.027 / (60 x 10^-3) = 0.000042 shirts per minute. Therefore, there will be 42 shirts in one minute.;
Response:  We have to find out how many shirts can be made with 5 meters of cloth. To do this, we need to divide the length of the cloth (5 meters) by the width of the cloth (1 meter). This gives us 5 meters per meter. Now, we know that each shirt requires 0.25 meters of fabric. So, to make one shirt, we need 0.25 meters of fabric. Since there are 5 meters in total, we can make 5 / 0.25 = 20 shirts. Therefore, the answer is 20 shirts.;
Response:  We have to find out how many shirts can fit in one minute and then calculate how many minutes it will take for 9 shirts and 44 shirts respectively.  One shirt takes up 1/60th of a minute, so we need to divide 60 by that value to get the number of shirts per minute.  Therefore, there are 60 / (1/60) = 10 shirts per minute. Now let's calculate the time taken for 9 shirts and 44 shirts. For 9 shirts, it will take 9 x 10 = 90 seconds or approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds. Similarly, for 44 shirts, it will take 44 x 10 = 440 seconds or approximately 7 minutes and 20 seconds.;
Response:  We have to find out how many shirts can fit in one van and how many vans are available. Then we will know how many shirts can be transported altogether.  So, let's start with the first part of the question. How many shirts can fit in one van? According to the information given in the question, there are 13 large shirts and 3 small shirts. Large shirts take up more space than small shirts, so we will assume that each large shirt takes up 2 square feet of space. Therefore, the total number of large shirts that can fit in one van is: 13 x 2 = 26 large shirts per van. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question. How many vans are available? According to the question, there are 7 vans available. So, the total number of shirts that can be transported altogether is: 26 x 7 = 182 shirts.;

Response:  We have to find out how many shirts can fit in one minute and then calculate how many shirts can be washed in 14 hours.  Firstly, we need to convert minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in one minute, so 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds. Now, let's calculate how many shirts can fit in one second. Since there are 12 minutes in one hour, we can divide the number of shirts that can fit in one minute by 12 to get the number of shirts that can fit in one hour. Therefore, 1 shirt can fit in 1/60th of a minute or 1/3600th of an hour. Now, let's calculate how many shirts can be washed in 14 hours. To do this, we will multiply the number of shirts that can fit in one hour by 14. So, 14 x 3600 = 50,400 shirts. Therefore, the answer is 50,400 shirts.;

Response:  Kerala has 14 districts and each district has approximately 10 taluks. So, there are 140 taluks in Kerala. Now, let's assume that each taluk has an average of 20 villages (this is just an estimate). Therefore, the total number of villages in Kerala is 140 x 20 = 2800 villages. Now, let's calculate the number of residents per village based on the population density of Kerala. According to the Census of India 2011, the population density of Kerala is 897 people per square kilometer. So, if we divide the total population of Kerala (3.37 crore) by its area (38,383 sq km), we get an average population per square kilometer of 897 / 38,383 = 22.7 people/sq km. Now, applying this population density to the total number of villages in Kerala (2800), we get an estimated average population per village of 22.7 x 2800 = 62,840 people per village. Finally, dividing the total population of Kerala by the number of villages (62,840 people/village x 165 days = 102,320 days), we get an approximate estimate of 165 days for one resident to visit all the villages in Kerala.;
Response:  Kerala has 14 districts. Each district has 7 taluks. So, total number of taluks in Kerala is 14 x 7 = 98 taluks. Now, let's consider the case where Tom George is visiting one taluk every day for 22 days. Therefore, he will cover all 98 taluks in Kerala during these 22 days.;
Response:  Kerala has 30 days in April. If Aravind spends Rs. 420 per day, he will spend Rs. 12600 for the entire month (30 days x Rs. 420 per day). Now, if we subtract the amount spent by Aravind from the total amount received by him (Rs. 5000), we get Rs. 3740 left over (Rs. 5000 - Rs. 12600 = Rs. 3740). So, the remaining amount after deducting the expenses of one day is Rs. 3740.;
Response:  We know that Raj has played 44 matches and scored 382 runs in those matches.  Now, we are asked how many runs he would have scored if he had played 10 more matches. So, let's calculate it as follows: Number of runs scored by Raj in additional 10 matches = Total number of runs scored by him x Percentage increase in runs (based on the given information) = 382 x 15% = 55.6 runs Therefore, Raj would have scored an additional 55.6 runs if he had played 10 more matches.;
"Response:  We know that Raju has 20 days to complete his work and he can do it in 120 hours. So, we have:

Raju has 9 days more than Bakkiyamma.";
Response:  Kerala has 154 days in a year and 325 days in 5 years. So, the total number of days in 5 years is 325 x 5 = 1625 days. Now, let's calculate how many days are there between two consecutive birthdays. Since the person was born on February 29th, we need to find out how many days are there between two consecutive leap years. Leap years occur every 4 years, so there are 4 years between two consecutive leap years. Therefore, the number of days between two consecutive leap years is 365 x 4 = 1460 days. Now, let's apply this formula to find out how many days are there between two consecutive birthdays. If the person's birthday falls on February 29th, then the next birthday will be after 1460 days (or 4 years). So, the age of the person at their next birthday will be 1 + 4 = 5 years old.;
Response:  The person has 10 coins of Rs.5 each and 4 coins of Rs.2 each. So, in total, they have 10 x Rs.5 = Rs.50 + 4 x Rs.2 = Rs.8. Therefore, the person has Rs.58.;

Based on the information provided, we know that there are 7 swimmers and 12 non-swimmers among the group. Non-swimmers cannot swim in the ocean, so they will not be able to go to the beach. Therefore, the total number of people who can go to the beach is equal to the number of swimmers minus the number of non-swimmers, which is 7 - 12 = -5. Since it is not possible to have negative numbers of people going to the beach, the final answer is 0.;
Response:  We have to find out how many swans and cats are there in total.  From the question, we know that there are 16 swans and 71 cats. So, the total number of birds is 16 + 71 = 87. Now, we need to find out how many of these birds are swans. Since each bird can have at most two wings, the number of swans is maximum 2 x 87 = 174. Therefore, the answer is 174.;
Response:  We have to find out how many swans can fit in a basket with a diameter of 15 cm.  Firstly, we need to calculate the volume of the basket. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this case, the radius of the basket is half its diameter, which is 7.5 cm (since the diameter is 15 cm). So, the radius is 7.5 cm. Now, we need to find the height of the basket. Since it is a flat basket, the height is equal to the diameter, which is also 15 cm. Therefore, the volume of the basket is V = π(7.5)^2 \* 15 = 396.25 cubic centimeters. Next, we need to divide the volume of the basket by the volume of a single swan. A swan has a volume of approximately 0.4 cubic meters. So, to find out how many swans can fit in the basket, we divide the volume of the basket by that of a swan: 396.25 / 0.4 = 985.63 swans. Therefore, there can be approximately 986 swans in a basket with a diameter of 15 cm.;
Response:  We are given that Paula has 2 apples in her bag and she wants to share them equally among 4 of her friends. So, each friend will get 1/4th of an apple. Now, we need to find out how many apples each friend will get. Therefore, the number of apples each friend will get is 43 / 4 = 10.75 apples. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, each friend will get 11 apples.;
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are left after 35 apples are taken away from 58 apples. So, we need to subtract 35 from 58.  Subtracting 35 from 58 gives us 23. Therefore, there are 23 apples left after taking away 35 apples from 58 apples.;
Response:  We know that there are 40 apples and 54 bananas in total. So, the ratio of apples to bananas is 40:54 or 1:1.67 (since we have more than one apple for every six bananas). Now, let's find out how many apples Ava has if she has 39 apples. To do this, we can divide the number of apples Ava has by the ratio of apples to bananas: 39/1:1.67 = 24.85 (approximately). Therefore, Ava has approximately 25 apples.;
Response:  We have to find out how many fingers are there in each hand and then multiply it with the number of hands. So, we can start counting from the left hand. In the left hand, there are 5 fingers ( thumb + index finger + middle finger + ring finger + little finger). Now, let's count the right hand. There are also 5 fingers in the right hand (thumb + index finger + middle finger + ring finger + little finger). Therefore, the total number of fingers in both hands is 10 (5 in each hand). Next, we need to calculate the number of palms. As per the question, there are 11 axillary hair follicles in each arm. Since each palm has 4 fingers, we can deduce that there are 44 palms (11 axillary hair follicles / 4 fingers per palm). Finally, we need to multiply the total number of fingers with the number of palms to get the total number of fingers in both arms. Therefore, the answer is 440 (10 x 44).;
Response:  We have to find out how many shells Adami can carry in his hand and then divide it by 10 to get the number of shells he can carry in each hand. So, let's first calculate the maximum number of shells Adami can carry in his hand. According to the question, Adami has 10 fingers, so he can hold 10 shells in one hand. Therefore, the maximum number of shells Adami can carry in his hand is 10. Now, we need to divide this number by 10 to get the number of shells he can carry in each hand. So, Adami can carry 1 shell in each hand.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 fruits in Aditya's basket and 10 vegetables in his garden. So, the total number of items in Aditya's backyard is 8 + 10 = 18. Now, we need to find out how many of these items belong to Aditya himself. From the information given in the question, we know that Aditya has 4 shares in the fruit basket and 2 shares in the vegetable garden. Therefore, the number of items belonging to Aditya is 4 x 8 = 32 + 2 x 10 = 20 = 52.;
Response:  We know that there are 544 paths in total and 32 of them are obstacles. So, to find out how many remaining paths are left, we can subtract the number of obstacles from the total number of paths. Therefore, the answer is: 544 - 32 = 512 paths remain unobstructed.;
Response:  We know that there are 466 paths in total and 53 of them have obstacles. So, the number of obstacle-free paths is 466 - 53 = 413. Now, we need to find out how many more paths are available for walking after removing the obstacles. There are 181 turns in total, so each turn has 2 options (left or right). Therefore, the number of ways to walk from one path to another without any obstruction is 181 x 2 = 362. Hence, the remaining paths are 413 - 362 = 51 paths.;
Response:  We know that there are 141 paths in total and we have already counted 71 straight paths and 91 turnings. So, the remaining number of paths is 71 + 91 = 162. Therefore, there are 162 paths beyond the 91st turning.;
Response:  We know that there are 40 paths in one square of the grid. So, if we have $n$ squares, then there will be $\frac{n}{1} \times 40 = 40 n$ paths in total. Therefore, the number of paths is $40 \times 200 = 8000$.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4502 skittles in Steven's bag and 4276 of them are red. So, the number of non-red skittles is 4502 - 4276 = 223. Now, out of these 223 non-red skittles, 154 are green. Therefore, the total number of green skittles is 154.;
Response:  We know that there are 3941 skittles in Steven's bag and he has 4950 reserves. So, we have to find out how many more Skittles Steven can get if he uses all his reserves. To do this, we need to subtract the number of Skittles he already has from the total number of Skittles available for him. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of additional Skittles = Total number of Skittles available - Number of Skittles already in the bag = 4950 - 3941 = 909.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 896 stations in Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC). Out of these, 517 are regular bus stands and 90 are night shelters. So, the total number of stops is 896 - 517 = 379. Now, let's calculate the average distance between two consecutive stops. We can do this by dividing the total length of all routes covered by KSRTC (which is not provided in the question) by the total number of stops. Assuming that each route covers approximately equal distances between two consecutive stops, we can estimate an average distance of around 2-3 km per stop. Therefore, the approximate distance between any two consecutive stops in Kerala is around 2-3 km.;
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in one school and 5 of them have green eyes. So, the number of students with blue eyes is 265 (270 - 5). Now, we need to find out how many more students have blue eyes than green eyes. To do this, we can subtract the number of students with green eyes from the total number of students:  Number of students with blue eyes = Total number of students - Number of students with green eyes  Number of students with blue eyes = 265  Therefore, there are 190 more students with blue eyes than green eyes (265 - 5).;
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in this school and each class has 75 students. So, the total number of students in this school is:  Number of classes x Number of students per class = 304 x 75 = 22,550 students. Therefore, there are 22,550 students in this school.;
