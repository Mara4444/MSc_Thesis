"Response: 43
Explanation:
Let's use the information given in the question to find out how many pages are in the second part (ikalawang kabanata) compared to the first part (unang kabanata).
The total number of pages in the book is 2 x 100 = 200 pages.
So, if the first part has 37 pages, then it accounts for 37/200 = 0.185 pages of the book.
Similarly, if the second part has 80 pages, it accounts for 80/200 = 0.4 pages of the book.
Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in the two parts is:
0.4 - 0.185 = 0.215 pages."

Explanation:
The first part of the question states that an Aklat has 2 Kabanata and the first Kabanata has 60 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the first Kabanata is 60 x 2 = 120 pages.
Since there are 93 pages in the second Kabanata, we can calculate the number of pages in the entire book as follows:
Total Number of Pages = Number of Pages in First Kabanata + Number of Pages in Second Kabanata
= 120 + (93 - 60)
= 157 pages
Therefore, the answer to the question is 157 pages."

Response:  The amount of money that Edward spent is $ 10 ($ 13 - $ 3).
Response: 20 (Edward had $ 9 before he lost it and gained $ 8 today, so he now has $ 17)
"Response: 43000
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Edward had $ 16 before he bought 92 books worth $ 16 each. Therefore, the total amount of money that Edward spent on buying the books is $ 16 x 92 = $ 1456. Since Edward now has $ 6 left after buying the books, we can calculate the number of times he could have bought the books by dividing the remaining amount of money ($ 6) by the cost price of each book ($ 16): $ 6 / $ 16 = 4 times. So, Edward was able to buy 4 x 92 = 376 books with his initial $ 16."

"Response: 10
Explanation: Based on the given information, we can calculate the distance between the two points as follows:
Distance = Uod - Daga
= 24 - 5
= 19 pulgadas
Therefore, the distance between the point where the palaka and the daga intersect to the point where the daga intersects with the ground is 19 pulgadas or approximately 48 cm."
Response: 4 pulgadas (or 4 inches)
Response: 120 feet
Response: 20 - 4 = 16
Response: 40 - 19 = 21 inches.
"Response: 30%
Explanation:
The distance between the balang and the daga is 25 - 16 = 9 inches or 23 cm. Therefore, the difference in height between the two objects is 23 cm.
Since the diameter of the balang is 21 pulgadas (or 53 cm), we can calculate the ratio of the height to the diameter as follows:
Height / Diameter = 23 cm / 53 cm = 0.43
So, the balang is 43% taller than the daga."
Response:  The diameter of the palaka (17 pulgadas) is longer than the diameter of the balang (39 pulgadas), so the difference between their diameters is 22 pulgadas (39 - 17 = 22).
Response: 10 inches (or 25 cm)
"Response: 20
Explanation: Based on the given information, we can calculate the difference in height between the two objects as follows:

Difference in height = Height of Daga - Height of Palaka
= 16 pulgadas - 37 pulgadas
= 20 pulgadas

Therefore, the distance between the Daga and the Balang is 20 pulgadas."

Response:  Let x be the number of families of birds that migrate to warmer areas. Since 60% of the bird families migrate for warmth, we can say that 60x/100 = 30x/100, or 2x = 30. Therefore, there are twice as many bird families that migrate to warmer areas than those that stay near the mountain.
Response:  The number of families of birds that moved to warmer areas is 7 times more than the number of families that moved away from warm areas. Therefore, if 7 families of birds migrated to escape the heat, there are approximately 7 x 87 = 609 families of birds living near the mountain.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, there are 20 families of birds that migrated to the hotter countries while 14 families remained in their original habitat near the mountain. Therefore, the number of families of birds living near the mountain before migration is 14.
Response:  There are 106 families of birds living near the mountain. If 23 families moved towards Apple and 37 families moved towards Asia, how many families of birds remained in the vicinity of the mountain?
Response:  There are 42 families of birds that migrate towards Appria and 31 families of birds that migrate towards Asia. Therefore, there are more families of birds that migrate towards Appria than towards Asia.
Response:  There are 16 more families of birds that migrate to Asia than to Africa. Specifically, there are 47 families of birds that migrate to Aprika and 94 families that migrate to Asia, while there are only 40 families that migrate to Africa.
Response:  There are 45 families of birds that migrate to warmer countries. Of these, 38 families migrated towards Appria and 80 families migrated towards Asia. Therefore, there are 38 + 80 = 118 families of birds that migrated for warmth.
Response: 253 families of birds are living near the mountain. If 18 new families of birds join them, there will be 253 + 18 = 271 families of birds living near the mountain now.
Response: 108 families of birds live near the mountain. Among them, 59 families moved to warmer areas and 24 new families of birds arrived in the area nearby the mountain from Arctic. How many bird families are left behind near the mountain?
Response:  There are 41 families of birds living near a mountain. If 27 families of birds migrate to a warmer country due to the change in weather, then there are 41 - 27 = 14 families of birds left near the mountain.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, there are 86 families of birds that migrate to warmer areas from nearby mountains. If there were 45 families of birds living near the mountain initially, then the number of families that migrated to escape the cold is 86 - 45 = 41 families.
Response:  There are 41 families of birds living near the mountain and 35 families moving towards Asia. However, there are more families of birds moving towards Africa than towards Asia.

Response:  $1
Response:  The value of the candy bar is $ 3.
Response:  The total cost of 99 chocolate bars at $3 each would be $297 (99 x $3 = $297).
Response:  The cost of each chocolate bar is $4, so the total cost of 2 chocolate bars is $8. Therefore, the cost of one chocolate bar is $8/2 = $4.
Response: 5 bars of chocolate. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, if Dan spent $ 20 and each bar of chocolate costs $ 6, then he bought 5 bars of chocolate (20 / 6 = 3).
Response:  The total amount of money spent by Dan is $10 ( $2 for the chocolate bar + $3 for another chocolate).
Response:  The total cost of the items bought by Si Dan is $ 4 + $ 7 = $ 11 + $ 6 = $ 17. Therefore, he spent $ 17 to buy the candy bar and the chocolate.
Response:  The cost of the chocolate bar is $ 6 and the cost of the other chocolate is $ 3, so the total amount spent by Dan is $ 6 + $ 3 = $ 9. Therefore, the difference in price between what Dan paid for the chocolate bar compared to the other chocolate is $ 9 - $ 2 = $ 7.
Response:  The cost of one chocolate bar is $ 2 and the cost of one chocolate is $ 3. Therefore, if he buys both, the total cost will be: $ 2 + $ 3 = $ 5. So, he will spend $ 5 for both chocolates.
Response:  $13
Response:  The value of the chocolate is $ 6 - $ 4 = $ 2.
Response:  The total cost of 10 chocolate bars with equal prices of $ 3 each is $ 3 x 10 = $ 30.
Response:  The cost of each chocolate bar is $ 6. Therefore, the total cost of two chocolate bars is $ 12.
Response:  The cost of the chocolate bar is $ 7, and the cost of the hot chocolate is $ 3. So, if he spent $ 5 on hot chocolate, then he has $ 2 left over to buy the chocolate bar. Therefore, the amount he spent on the chocolate bar is $ 2.
Response:  The cost of one chocolate bar is $ 2, and the cost of one cup of hot chocolate is $ 7. So, if he buys one chocolate bar and one cup of hot chocolate, his total expense will be $ 2 + $ 7 = $ 9. Therefore, he will have $ 9 - $ 4 = $ 5 left after buying both items.

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul had 108 books and sold some of them at a garage sale. After selling some books, he was left with 62 books. Therefore, the number of books that Paul bought at the garage sale is 40 (62 - 108 = 40)."
Response: 36 (151 - 50 = 36)
"Response:  $290
Explanation:
If Paul has two books and bought 150 new ones at a garage sale, then he now has 178 books (2 + 150). If each book costs $30, then the total cost of the books that Paul bought is $5,600 ($178 x $30). Therefore, the amount that Paul spent on the books is $5,600 - $290 = $5,310."
"Response: 360
Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:
Paul has 21 books and sells some of them at a garage sale to raise funds for his new purchases. Let's assume he sold x books at the garage sale. Since he already had 21 books before selling any, the total number of books he now has is 21 + x.
Now, he buys 42 new books, so the total number of books he owns now is 21 + x - 42 = 15 (since he cannot have negative books).
Therefore, the maximum number of books Paul could have bought with the money he raised from selling his old books is 15 - x, since he already had 21 books before selling any.
So, if he bought more than 15 books, it means he spent more money than what he raised from selling his old books, which is not possible. Therefore, the answer is 15 - x."

Response: 30
"Response: 47
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are currently 16 caps and 68 wrappers in Danny's collection. This means that Danny had 39 packages of bote before he collected 16 caps, which is equal to 23 packages (since each package contains 39 wrappers). Therefore, the number of wrappers Danny has collected so far is 68 - 23 = 45 wrappers."
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were initially 46 packages and 50 wrappers in Danny's collection. Now, there are 21 caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. Therefore, the number of caps is greater than the number of wrappers by 31 (21 - 52 = -31)."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are currently 31 caps and 9 wrappers in Danny's collection. To find out how many more wrappers than caps Danny has, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the number of caps: 31 - 9 = 22.

Explanation: To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than Jeff, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards that Jeff has from the total number of baseball cards that Nell has. Based on the information given in the question, Nell has 415 baseball cards and Jeff has 309 baseball cards, so the difference is 106 (415 - 309). Since each set of 10 cards contains 10 cards, the total number of sets of 10 cards that Nell has is 10 x 10 = 100. Therefore, the number of baseball cards that Nell has more than Jeff is 106 - 100 = 6."
"Response: 378
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell has 246 baseball cards and 214 10-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, which increased her total number of baseball cards to 404. Since she had 214 10-card packs before giving any to Jeff, she must have had 378 10-card packs after giving some to him. Therefore, the difference between the number of 10-card packs that Nell has and the number of baseball cards she has is 378."
Response: 210 - 195 = 15
"Response: 260
Explanation:
Nell has 438 baseball cards and gave away 18 of them to Jeff. So, she now has 438 - 18 = 420 baseball cards left.
Jeff received 55 10-card sets from Nell, which is equal to 55 x 10 = 550 cards.
So, the total number of baseball cards that Nell has after giving some away and receiving new ones is:
420 + 550 = 970 cards."
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell has 239 baseball cards and 38 non-baseball cards initially. After receiving some of her cards from Jeff, she now has 376 baseball cards and 111 non-baseball cards. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than non-baseball cards, we subtract the number of non-baseball cards from the total number of baseball cards: 376 - 111 = 265. Since there are 10 cards in each pack of baseball cards, we divide this number by 10 to get the total number of baseball cards that Nell received from Jeff: 265 / 10 = 26.5. Therefore, Nell has 45 more baseball cards than non-baseball cards."

"Response: 72
Explanation: If the baker sold 51 cakes to the buyer and made 82 cakes in total (including the ones he sold), then the number of cakes left with the baker is:

Left with Baker = Total Cakes - Sold Cakes = 82 - 51 = 31
Therefore, there are 31 cakes left with the baker."
"Response: 21
Explanation: According to the problem, Baker has 54 cakes and sells 13 of them. Therefore, he still has 41 cakes left (54 - 13 = 41)."
Response:  The baker sold 145 pieces of cake to the customers. If he had 72 remaining pieces before selling them, then the number of pieces he sold is equal to 72 / 2 = 36. So, the amount earned by the baker is 36 x ₱100 = ₱3,600.
Response: 35 (155 - 140 = 35)
"Response: 36 (121 - 105 = 16; 16 / 2 = 8)"
"Response: 72 (13 - 9 = 4; 4 - 154 = -148)"
Response: 49 (78 - 31 = 49)
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the baker made 110 cakes and sold 75 of them. This means that the baker has 35 remaining cakes (110 - 75 = 35). After making another 76 cakes, the total number of cakes the baker now has is 35 + 76 = 111. Therefore, there are 111 cakes available for sale."
"Response: 23 (144 - 71 = 73; 73 + 111 = 184)"
Response:  The cost of each cake is Php 136 and each pastry is Php 87. So, if the baker sells 10 cakes and 90 pastries, he/she will earn a total of Php 1,360 from the cakes (Php 136 x 10) and Php 753 from the pastries (Php 87 x 90). Therefore, the total amount earned by the baker is Php 2,113.
"Response:  The cost of one pie is Php 15 and the cost of one cupcake is Php 103. So, if the baker sold 7 pies and 148 cupcakes, the total amount earned from selling these items would be:

Php 7 x Php 15 = Php 105 for the pies
Php 148 x Php 103 = Php 15,294 for the cupcakes
Total earnings = Php 15,399
Therefore, the answer to the question is Php 15,399."
Response:  To determine how much more money the baker earned from selling more cakes than pastries, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold (81) from the total number of pastries produced (48). So, the difference is 33 pastries. Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by each cake and pastry based on their prices given in the problem. The price of one cake is $126, while that of one pastry is $48. Therefore, the revenue generated by each cake is $126 x 126 = $15,792, while that of each pastry is $48 x 81 = $3,704. Now, let's find out how much more money the baker earned from selling more cakes than pastries. We can do this by subtracting the revenue generated by the pastries ($3,704) from the revenue generated by the cakes ($15,792): $15,792 - $3,704 = $12,088. So, the baker earned $12,088 more from selling more cakes than pastries.
Response:  The cost of 131 pastries is Php 16,523 (Php 125 x 131).  To find out how much more the customer paid for each additional pastry compared to each additional cake, we need to divide the total cost of the extra pastries by the number of extra pastries: Php 16,523 / 54 = Php 308 per additional pastry.
Response: 3 more cakes were sold than pastries. Therefore, the number of cakes sold is 158 - 147 = 11.
Response: 70 (pastries) - 68 (cake) = 2 more pastries were sold than cakes.
Response:  The number of cakes that the baker can make in one day is 48 / 44 = 1.07 (approximately). So, if the baker makes 44 cakes initially and then decides to make more, they can potentially produce approximately 10-11 additional cakes per day.
Response:  The cost of each cake made by the baker is Php 200. Therefore, the total cost of 40 cakes is Php 8,000 (Php 200 x 40).
"Response: 22 (or 20)
Explanation:
Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of cakes that the baker has left after making 169 cakes for her friend. Since the baker had 137 cakes remaining before she made any cakes for her friend, we can set up the equation:
x + 137 = 169
Now, let's simplify the equation by subtracting 137 from both sides:
x = 32
So, the baker has 32 cakes left after making 169 cakes for her friend."

Response: 78
Response: 76 (139 - 145 = 76)
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the passage, the baker made 62 cakes and then sold 144 of them. This means that there are 82 cakes left with the baker (62 - 144 = 82)."
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the question, Baker made 81 cakes initially and then made another 92 cakes after that. So, in total, he made 173 cakes (81 + 92). However, he sold only 46 of these cakes, which means he had 127 remaining (173 - 46). Therefore, Baker made 45 more cakes than the ones he bought."
"Response: 23
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the baker has sold 108 keys and 44 pastries for a total of PHP 61. Since the baker still has some remaining stock after selling these items, we can infer that they have a total of 23 keys left (44 - 108 = 23)."
"Response:  The cost of one pastry is Php 38 and the cost of one cake is Php 104. So, if the baker sold 104 cakes and 29 pastries, the total amount earned by the baker would be:
Php 104 x 104 = Php 10,760 + Php 29 x 38 = Php 1,062 = Php 11,822
Therefore, the baker earned a total of Php 11,822 from selling 104 cakes and 29 pastries."
Response:  If Baker sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries, then the total number of units sold is 102 + 94 = 196. Since the cost per cake is Php 84 and the cost per pastry is Php 52, we can calculate the total revenue as follows: Revenue = Number of units x Cost per unit = 196 x Php 84 = Php 167.64 million. Therefore, if more cakes were sold than pastries, the baker would earn more money from selling cakes than pastries.
Response:  The baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes, for a total of 145 items. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries, then he sold more pastries than cakes by a margin of 5 (145 - 140 = 5) pastries.
Response:  If he sells 8 pastries and 97 cakes, then the total number of pastries sold is 8 + 97 = 105. The total number of cakes sold is 97. To find out how many more pastries were sold than cakes, we subtract the number of cakes from the number of pastries: 105 - 97 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more pastries sold than cakes.
Response:  If he sold 154 pastries and 78 cakes, then the total number of items sold is 232 (154 + 78). Since he sold more pastries than cakes, we can say that the average price per pastry is lower than the average price per cake. Let's assume that the average price per pastry is x pesos and the average price per cake is y pesos. We know that the total revenue from selling pastries is 232x pesos and the total revenue from selling cakes is 232y pesos. To find out how much more money he made from selling pastries than from selling cakes, we need to subtract the total revenue from selling cakes from the total revenue from selling pastries: 232x - 232y = . Therefore, if the average price per pastry is higher than the average price per cake, the baker will make more money from selling pastries than from selling cakes.

"Response:  $36
Explanation:
Dave won 19 tickets in total. If he used 12 tickets to buy large items and 7 tickets to buy small items, then he has 19 - 12 = 7 remaining tickets.
Since each ticket is worth $1, the cost of buying large items using 12 tickets is $1 x 12 = $12. The cost of buying small items using 7 tickets is $1 x 7 = $7.
Therefore, the total amount that Dave spent on both large and small items is $12 + $7 = $19."

Then, he used 18 more tickets to buy clothes. So, he has 0 tickets left (5 - 18 = 0) after buying both games and clothes. Therefore, the answer is 0."
"Response: 36
Explanation: If Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, he has 12 tickets left. If he uses 10 of these tickets to buy games, that means he has 2 tickets left. Therefore, the number of tickets remaining for Dave is 2."

Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 12 talampaks and its width is 11 talampaks. Therefore, the area of his room is 132 units (12 x 11 = 132).
Response:  The area of the carpet needed by Jesse is 14 square feet x 7 talampakan = 98 square feet.
Response:  The area of the room that Jesse needs to cover with carpet is 14 square feet. To determine how many tiles he will need, we can use the formula: Number of tiles = Total area of room / Size of each tile. In this case, the size of each tile is 7 talampakan (or 28 inches) per side, so: Number of tiles = 14 sq ft / 28 in/side = 50 tiles. Therefore, Jesse will need 50 tiles to cover the entire room.
Response: 240 square feet (11 x 22 = 24) + 390 square feet (15 x 26 = 39). So, to cover the entire room, Jesse needs an area of 630 square feet of carpet (240 + 390).
Response:  To cover the entire floor with tiles that are 4 square feet each, Jesse needs 360 tiles (2 talampakan x 12 talampakan = 48 squares / 4 square feet per tile = 120 tiles).
"Response:  To calculate the carpet needed to cover all the surfaces of Jesse's house, we need to find the total area of all the surfaces first. The length and width of each surface are given as follows:

* Length of wall = 19 meters
* Width of wall = 18 meters
* Area of one surface = length x width = 19 x 18 = 342 square meters

Since there are multiple surfaces, we need to add their areas together to get the total area of all the surfaces:
Total area = 342 square meters x number of surfaces = 342 x 5 = 1720 square meters
Therefore, Jesse needs a carpet with an area of 1720 square meters to cover all the surfaces of his house."
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 19 talampaks and its width is 20 talampaks. Therefore, the area of his room is 19 x 20 = 380 square talampaks.
Response: 20 square feet (since 10 square feet x 2 = 20 square feet)
Response: 48 square feet (2 x 20 = 40 square feet + 8 square feet for the doorway).
Response: 360 square feet (18 square feet x 4 talampakan).
"Response: 150
Explanation: According to the passage, Razorback sold $ 23 per t-shirt and earned $ 230 during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. Therefore, if they sold 150 t-shirts, their total earnings would be $ 34,500 ($ 23 x 150)."
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt sold by Razorback is $51.
Response:  The Razorbacks earned $87 for each T-shirt sold during the time of the Arkansas game and $95 for each T-shirt sold during the time of the Texas Tech game. If they sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, their total earnings from selling T-shirts would be: $87 x 47 = $4,069.
Response:  The Razorbacks sold 242 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, and they earned $106 per t-shirt. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from selling t-shirts during that game is: 242 x $106 = $25,372
"Response:  $57,400
Explanation:
To find out how much money Razorbacks earned from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we need to multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price of each t-shirt. According to the question, they sold 163 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game and each t-shirt cost $98 dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game is:
$98 x 163 = $57,400
Therefore, the answer is $57,400."
Response:  $340,500
Response:  The Razorbacks earned $10,547 from selling T-shirts during the game against Texas Tech. This is calculated by multiplying the number of T-shirts sold (183) by the price per T-shirt ($62).
Response:  $165 x 156 = $25,940
Response:  The cost of a Razorback t-shirt is $192, while the cost of a jersey is $34. If they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, then the total revenue from t-shirts would be $192 x 157 = $28,640, and the total revenue from jerseys would be $34 x 19 = $656. So, the average price of a t-shirt is higher than that of a jersey.
Response:  The cost of a Texas Tech jersey is $232, while the cost of an Arkansas t-shirt is $86. Therefore, if they sold 43 jerseys and 254 t-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, the total revenue from jerseys would be $43 x $232 = $9,760, while the total revenue from t-shirts would be $254 x $86 = $21,992.
Response:  The revenue generated by selling each T-shirt is $ 51 dollars. If they offered a discount of $ 8 per T-shirt during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game and sold 130 T-shirts, their total revenue would be:  Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt + Discount per T-shirt x Number of T-shirts sold  Revenue = 130 x $ 51 + ($ 8 x 130) = $ 67,900
Response:  The revenue of Razorback from selling t-shirts is $ 201 per t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they increased the price of each t-shirt to $ 217 and sold 14 t-shirts. Therefore, their total revenue from selling t-shirts is $ 3,069 ($ 217 x 14).
Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop earned $60 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game if they sold $10 per t-shirt that they sold.
Response:  The value of each t-shirt is $43 ($215 / 5 t-shirts).
Response:  The Razorbacks earned $1,296 from selling 64 jerseys and $1,376 from selling 20 t-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
Response:  The Razorbacks earned $1,396 from selling T-shirts and $204 from each of the 2 Jerseys they sold during their game against Texas Tech, for a total revenue of $1,596.
Response:  The value of a T-shirt is $ 240 / 177 = $ 135 per T-shirt.
Response:  The value of a Razorback jersey is $115 compared to $25 for a T-shirt. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 113 T-shirts and 78 jerseys. Therefore, the value of a Jeremy Lin Jersey is $115 - $25 = $90 more than a T-shirt.

Response:  The number of days that will pass before Lewis's savings double is 84 days (1216 / 16 = 84).
Response:  The amount of money that Lewis has at the end of the period is $ 702 - $ 21 x 216 = $ 495.
Response:  If Lewis works for 223 days in a year and earns $ 1357 per week, then his total income for 73 weeks of work would be: Total Income = Number of Weeks x Weekly Income = 73 x $ 1357 = $ 94,601
"Response:  The total amount of money earned by Lewis during his annual leave can be calculated as follows:
Total earnings = Regular salary + Overtime pay
= $28 x 1091 days
= $297,488
Therefore, Lewis earned $297,488 during his annual leave."
Response:  The total amount earned by Lewis during the 233 days of annuity is $ 100,690 ($ 403 x 233). To find out how much he earned per day, divide the total amount by the number of days: $ 100,690 / 233 = $ 435 per day. Therefore, Lewis earns $ 435 per day during the period of annuity.
Response:  The amount that Lewis will pay as interest per month is $ 388 - $ 368 = $ 20. So, he will pay an additional $ 20 per month for the loan of $ 368 during the 1359 days of the lease period.
Response:  The amount of money that Lewis has at the end of the period is given by the formula: Ending balance = Beginning balance + Total income - Total expenses. In this case, the beginning balance is $0 (since there is no initial investment), and the total income is $491 x 1181 = $573,811. The total expense is $216 x 1181 = $245,766, so the ending balance is: Ending balance = $573,811 + $573,811 - $245,766 = $381,876. Therefore, Lewis has $381,876 at the end of the period.
Response:  $133 x 19 = $2547
"Response:  The number of days that have passed since Lewis started saving money is given as $ 2 per week for a period of time until he accumulated $ 178. Therefore, the number of days that have passed since he started saving money is:

$ 2 x Number of weeks = $ 178

Number of weeks = $ 178 / $ 2
= 89 weeks

Therefore, the number of days that have passed since Lewis started saving money is:

89 weeks x 7 days/week = 603 days"
Response:  The depth of water is 10 times that of Dean's height, so if Dean is 3 meters tall and the water level is 10 times his height, then the water level is 30 meters deep.
Response:  The height of the water level is twice as high as Dean's height, so it is 16 feet (2 x 8 feet) above the ground.
Response:  The height of the water is 6 times the length of Ron's body. So if Ron's body is 12 feet long, the height of the water is 6 x 12 = 72 feet.
Response:  The height of the water is 15 times greater than Dean's height. Since Dean is 4 feet tall, and each step is equal to 6 inches, then the distance from the ground to the top of the water is 15 x 6 = 90 inches or approximately 7.5 feet.
Response:  The height of the water is 20 times that of Ron's height. So if Ron's height is 13 paa (feet), then the height of the water is 20 x 13 = 260 feet.

"Response:  The total number of students who will go on the field trip is 98. Since there are 7 buses available, each bus can accommodate approximately 14 students (based on the assumption that each bus has a seating capacity of 14). Therefore, the total number of upuan or tickets sold for the field trip is:

Total number of students = 98
Number of buses = 7
Seating capacity per bus = 14
Upuan per student = Total number of students / Number of buses x Seating capacity per bus
= 98 / 7 x 14
= 3560 upuan
Therefore, the cost of the field trip for each student is approximately PHP 3560."

Explanation: To determine the number of students who want to go on the field trip, we need to subtract the number of students who do not want to go from the total number of students in the school. In this case, 22 students do not want to go, so we subtract that from the total number of students (102) to get the number of students who want to go (70)."
Response: 76 (11 - 8 = 76)
Response: 4 buses are needed to accommodate all 111 students of the school for the field trip.
"Response:  The cost of each student's fare for the field trip is PhP 500 per person. Therefore, the total amount needed to pay for all students and buses is:
PhP 500 x 92 = PhP 46,000 + PhP 46,000 (for the 46 school buses) = PhP 92,000
Therefore, the total cost of the field trip for all students and buses is PhP 92,000."

"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the problem, Brenda made 18 cookies and each guest received an equal number of cookies regardless of how many guests arrived. Therefore, if 9 out of 10 guests did not arrive, Brenda would have given 9 x 1 = 9 cookies to the remaining guest. So, the total number of cookies distributed was 18 + 9 = 27 cookies."
Response:  The number of cookies given to each guest can be represented by the equation: Number of Cookies = (Number of Guests x Number of Cookies per Guest) / Total Number of Cookies. In this case, the number of guests is 2 and the number of cookies per guest is 7, so the total number of cookies is 14. Therefore, the number of cookies given to each guest is: Number of Cookies per Guest = 14 / 2 = 7.
Response:  The number of cookies that Brenda prepared is 10 x (number of visitors). So if there are 50 visitors, she prepared 500 cookies (10 x 50 = 500).

Therefore, the percentage of children who stayed in the camps is approximately 97.3%.
Response:  The number of children in Lawrence County who go to camp is 91676 / 61619 = approximately 1.5 times as many.
Response:  The number of children who went to camp was 34044 + 134867 = 168911. Additionally, there were 424944 new children from outside the province who attended the camp, so the total number of children who attended the camp was 168911 + 424944 = 593055.
Response:  The number of children aged 6 to 18 in Lawrence County who went to camp and the additional 22 children from outside the province who attended the camp are not sufficient information to determine the total number of children in the province. Therefore, we cannot accurately calculate the number of children in Lawrence County based on this information alone.
Response:  The number of children in Lawrence County is 644997 and there are additional 893835 children who came from other places to join them in their camp. Therefore, the total number of children in Lawrence County is 644997 + 893835 = 732,832.

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the total number of planks needed for the roof as follows:
Number of planks needed = Number of tables x Number of rows per table x Length of each plank
= 11 x 3 x 6 = 730
Since there are 8 extra planks, the total number of planks needed is:
Total number of planks = 730 + 8 = 738
Therefore, John needs 738 planks to build the roof of the house."

Response: 32
Response: 2560 (74 x 36)
"Response:  To determine how many planks John needs to buy for the construction of his house, we need to calculate the total number of planks required based on the sizes of the large and small tables. Let's assume that each large table requires 14 pieces of wood (kukos) and each small table requires 25 pieces of wood.

Large tables: 12 x 14 = 168 kukos
Small tables: 17 x 25 = 425 kukos
Total number of planks needed = Large tables + Small tables
= 168 + 425
= 593 kukos
Therefore, John needs 593 planks to build his house."
Response:  There are 13 packets of gum that Robin has (3 x 42 = 126).
Response: 50
Response:  There are 58 packages of gum that Robin has.

* May 45 na pakete ng kendi (45 packages of chocolates)
* Ilang piraso sa bawat pakete (Number of pieces in each package) = 9 (as given in the question)

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of chocolate that Robin has:
Total number of pieces of chocolate = Number of packages x Number of pieces per package
= 45 packages x 9 pieces/package
= 375 pieces

Therefore, the correct answer is 375."

Response: 180 minutes (or 3 hours)
Response: 120 (4 x 5 minutes)
Response: 10 minutes. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the machine can produce 3 shirts per minute. Therefore, if it produced 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today, it worked for 10 minutes yesterday (9 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 3 minutes) plus the time it took to produce 44 shirts today (44 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 14 minutes).
Response: 50 minutes (or 50/6 = 8.33 minutes per shirt)
Response: 30 minutes (or 1.5 hours)
Response: 120 minutes (or 2 hours)
Response:  The machine can produce 6 shirts in 1 minute. Therefore, it produced a total of 6 x 6 = 36 shirts in 12 minutes and 36 x 2 = 72 shirts in 14 minutes.
Response:  The machine can produce 6 shirts in 1 minute, and it worked for 5 minutes yesterday and produced 12 shirts today. Therefore, the number of shirts made by the machine today is 6 x 5 = 30 + 12 = 42 shirts.

"Response:  The carnival game ""Ring Toss"" at Karnabal earns $144 per day. They are inside Karnabal for 22 days. How much money do they make in total?"
Response:  $168/day
Response:  The total amount earned by the carnival game operators in the given period can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = (First 44 days) x $382 + (Last 10 days) x $374 Total earnings = $382 x 44 + $374 x 10 Total earnings = $16,596 + $3,740 Total earnings = $20,336 Therefore, the total amount earned by the carnival game operators is $20,336.
Response:  The amount earned by the players in one day during the first 20 days of the carnival can be calculated as follows:  Total earnings = (Number of successful throws x Prize money) / Number of throws During the first 20 days, there were 120 successful throws and $120 prize money per successful throw. Therefore, the total earnings for one day are: Total earnings = 120 x $120 = $14,400.
Response:  The amount earned by the players in one day of the carnival can be calculated as follows:  On the first 154 days, they earned $325 per day = $325 x 154 = $49,000.  On the remaining 57 days, they earned $114 per day = $114 x 57 = $6,380. Therefore, their total earnings for the entire 57-day period = $49,000 + $6,380 = $55,380.
