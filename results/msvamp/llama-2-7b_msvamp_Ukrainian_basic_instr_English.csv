6 hours/day x 86 days = 512 hours studying Chinese
Therefore, Rayan spends 30 hours per day (or 720 hours in total) studying both languages combined."
"Response: 24 hours
Explanation: According to the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, 7 hours per day studying Chinese, and 3 hours per day studying Spanish. To find out how many hours he spends on each language in total, we can multiply the number of days by the number of hours spent on that language per day: 6 hours/day x 7 days = 42 hours studying Chinese, 3 hours/day x 7 days = 21 hours studying Spanish. Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 24 hours (42 + 21) studying all three languages combined."
Response: 4 hours. According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, 3 hours per day studying Chinese, and 58 hours per day studying Spanish. To find out how many hours he spends studying English compared to Chinese, we can divide the number of hours he spends studying English by the number of hours he spends studying Chinese: 6 hours / 3 hours = 4 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English, which is more than the time he spends studying Chinese (3 hours).

"Response: 71

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that David made 36 more pull-ups than Zachry and 33 fewer than Zachry in class today. So, if Zachry did 58 pull-ups and 33 crunches, then Zachry did a total of 91 exercises (58 + 33). Therefore, the number of pull-ups Zachry performed is 71 (91 - 20)."
"Response: 34

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that David made 27 more pull-ups than Zachry and 7 fewer pull-ups than Zachry at their physical education class today. So, if Zachry did 5 pull-ups and 17 screamshots, then Zachry did 34 screamshots (27 + 7 = 34) more than he did pull-ups."

Question:  Кусака, жабка і миша змагалися в стрибках. Кусачок стрибнув на 24 дюйма. Жаба стрибала на 33 дюйма далі від комарка, а миша стрибала на 5 дюймів менше від жаби. Наскільки дальше може стрибати миша від комарка?

Answer: Based on the information provided in the question, we can see that the distance traveled by the mouse is 5 dm less than the distance traveled by the frog. Therefore, if the frog traveled 33 dm beyond the mark, then the mouse traveled 28 dm (33 - 5 = 28) beyond the mark."
Response: 28 cm (or 11 inches)
Response: 42 cm
Response: 40 cm
Response: 15 d (units of measurement not specified)
"Response: 39 inches
Explanation:
From the information given in the question, we can calculate the distance traveled by each of the three animals as follows:

* Kuksak (frog) jumped 25 dunams + 21 dunams = 46 dunams.
* Kuksa (toad) jumped 25 dunams + 16 dunams = 41 dunams.
* Mouse jumped 21 dunams.

Therefore, the cockroach jumped the farthest at 46 dunams, followed by the toad at 41 dunams, and the mouse at 21 dunams."
Response: 42 inches (or 106 cm)
"Response: 12 d
Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, we can calculate the distance traveled by each animal as follows:

* Kuksak (frog) jumped 9 inches. So, it traveled a distance of 9 inches x 0.08 feet/inch = 0.72 feet.
* Mouse stumbled 3 inches less than the frog, so it traveled a distance of 0.72 feet - 3 inches = 0.69 feet.
* The length of the jump made by the fish is not given in the problem statement, but since it was mentioned that the fish jumped ""дальше"" (farther) than the mouse, we can assume that it jumped a greater distance than the mouse. Let's call this distance X.
* Since the mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog, and the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the cockroach, we can say that the distance traveled by the mouse is equal to the distance traveled by the frog minus 3 times the distance traveled by the cockroach. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is:

X = 0.72 feet - 3 x 0.03 feet = 0.69 feet + 0.09 feet = 0.78 feet

Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is 0.78 feet."
"Response: 20 d
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, we know that:

* Кusaк (Kusak) stumbled and jumped 14 inches.
* Миша (Misha) jumped 16 inches less than Kusaк.
* Жабка (Zhaba) jumped 37 inches more than Комар (Komar).

So, if Komar jumped x inches, then Zhaba jumped x + 37 inches.

We are also given that Miša jumped y inches less than Zhaba, so Miša jumped x + 37 - y inches.

From this information, we can set up the equation:

x + 37 = y + 14

Solving for y, we get:

y = 20

Therefore, Miša jumped 20 inches from the starting point."

Response: 24
Response: 46 books were sold at the garage sale.
"Response: 35

Explanation:
The statement ""Пол мав 50 книг"" means that Paul had 50 books initially. The phrase ""у ньому залишилося 151"" implies that after buying something in a garage sale, he now has 151 books left. Therefore, the number of books Paul bought is 35 (151 - 50 = 35)."
"Response: 32

Explanation:
The statement ""Пол мав дві книги"" means Paul had two books. The phrase ""продавши деякі з них на гаражному розпродажі"" means he sold some of them at a garage sale. The number of books he sold is not specified in the question. Therefore, we can assume that he sold half of his original two books, which is equal to 1 book. So, he has 4 books left. Then, he bought 150 new books, which brings the total number of books he has to 194 (4 + 150). Finally, the question asks how many books he sold, and since he sold one book, the answer is 32."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Paul sold some of his books at a garage sale and used the money he earned to buy 42 new books. If he had 21 books initially and sold some of them, then he must have bought 42 - 21 = 21 new books. Therefore, there are now 15 more books that he bought than he sold (15 = 21 - 21)."
"Response: 54
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale, which resulted in him buying 38 new books. Therefore, he has 71 - 38 = 33 more books than he sold. So, he bought 38 - 33 = 54 more books than he sold."
"Response: 32

Explanation: According to the passage, after selling books and pens in the garage sale, Paul had 66 books and 59 pens left. If he started with 108 books and 55 pens, then he sold 32 books (108 - 66 = 42) and 27 pens (55 - 59 = -8)."
Response: 34
Response: 49 books were sold by Paul at the garage sale, leaving him with 27 books. Therefore, he initially had 136 books.
"Response: 27

Explanation:
The statement ""Пол мав 134 книги"" means that Paul had 134 books initially. Then, he gave his friend 39 books, which is equal to 39/134 = 0.29 of the total number of books. So, after giving his friend some books, Paul had 134 - 39 = 95 books left.

Next, he sold some books at a garage sale and earned $27. Since each book costs $X, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the amount he earned ($27) by the number of books he sold (x):

$27 / x = X

Solving for X, we get:

X = $27 / 68 = $0.40 per book

So, Paul sold 68 books at the garage sale, and each book cost him $0.40. Therefore, the answer is 27 books."

Explanation: According to the question, Jessica removed 4 trojanads from the vase and planted new ones in her garden, resulting in a total of 23 troyanids in the vase now. To find out how many troyand she cut, we need to subtract the number of troyands she added (4) from the original number of troyands in the vase (23), which gives us 19. Therefore, Jessica cut 10 troyands from the vase."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Jessica removed 33 trojanads from the vase and threw away 3 more. Therefore, she removed a total of 36 trojandds (33 + 3 = 36)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Jessica removed 34 trojanads from the vase and then cut several more from her garden to add to the vase. This means she removed a total of 34 + 7 = 41 trojanads. Therefore, she must have thrown away 9 trojanads in addition to those she cut from her garden."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 7 trojanads in Jessa's garden, and she removed some more from her own garden, which had 59 troyannds. So, the total number of troyandds that Jessica removed is equal to the difference between the initial number of troyands in her garden and the final number of troyansd in her garden, which is 59 - 20 = 39. Therefore, Jessica removed 13 troyansd from her garden."
"Response: 9
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initially, there were 13 trojanads in Vasilisa's garden.
* Jessica removed some more troyanads from her own garden, which had a total of 12 troyanads.
* Now, Vasilisa has 21 troyanads in her garden.

So, to find out how many troyanads are left in Jessica's garden, we need to subtract the number of troyanads that Vasilisa took from Jessica's garden (i.e., 12) from the initial number of troyanads in Jessica's garden (i.e., 12 + 13 = 25). Therefore, the answer is 9."

"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the passage, there were initially 13 trojan and 84 orchids in Jessica's garden. Then, she removed some more flowers from her garden, leaving 91 orchids and 14 troanads. To find out how many troandds Jessica removed, we can subtract the number of troandds after she removed them (14) from the initial number of troandds (13): 13 - 14 = -1. Therefore, Jessica removed 1 troandon from her garden."

415 - 309 = 106
Since each 10-card pack contains 10 cards, the total number of baseball cards Nell has after giving some away is:

"Response: 320

Explanation:

From the information provided in the question, we know that they collect 76 baskets of oranges per day and throw away 64 baskets. Therefore, the number of oranges collected per day is equal to the number of baskets collected minus the number of baskets thrown away:

Number of oranges collected per day = 76 - 64 = 12

Since each basket contains 50 oranges, the total number of oranges collected per day is:

Total number of oranges collected per day = 12 x 50 = 600

Therefore, the answer to the question is 600."

"Response: 378

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* The store ""Rayzorbec"" makes $106 per sold jersey.
* They sold 242 jerseys during two games (in Arkansas and Texas).
* They sold 115 jerseys during the game in Arkansas.

To find out how many jerseys they sold during the game in Texas, we can subtract the number of jerseys sold in Arkansas from the total number of jerseys sold:

242 - 115 = 127

Therefore, Rayzorbec sold 127 jerseys during the game in Texas."
"Response: 4520
Explanation:
The total number of footballs sold during both games is given as 163 + 89 = 252. Since each football costs $98, the total revenue from sales of footballs is 252 x $98 = $24,744."
"Response: 440
Explanation:
The total number of footballs sold during both games is 186 + 172 = 358.
If they earned $78 per each sold football in Arkansas and Texas Tech game, then their total earnings from selling footballs are:
$78 x 358 = $27,992
Therefore, they earned $27,992 from selling footballs during both games."
"Response: 183 x $ 62 = $ 11,546

Question:  Магазин ""Рэйзорбек"" заробляє $ 62 на кожній футболці & $ 99 на кожній майщиці. Poduring game Arkansas & Texas sold 183 football jerseys and 31 baseball jerseys. How much did they make from selling t-shirts?
Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the amount made by the store from selling t-shirts as follows:

Number of t-shirts sold = 31
Price of each t-shirt = $ 99
Total amount earned from selling t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold × Price of each t-shirt
= 31 × $ 99
= $ 3,079

Therefore, the store made $ 3,079 from selling t-shirts during the game."
"Response: 74 x $ 67 = $ 4890

Question:  Магазин ""Рэйзорбек"" заробляє $ 67 на кожній футболці & $ 165 на кожній майщиці. Poduring game Arkansas & Texas sold 74 footballs & 156 t-shirts. How much did they make from selling footballs?
Answer: 74 x $ 67 = $ 4890"
"Response:  $ 168
Explanation:
The total revenue from football jerseys is $ 192 + $ 34 = $ 226.
During the game, Arkansas and Texas sold 157 football jerseys at $ 34 each, so their total revenue was $ 5,088 ($ 157 x $ 34).
Therefore, the difference between the cost of a football jersey and a t-shirt is:
$ 226 - $ 5,088 = - $ 4,862
So, a football jersey costs more than a t-shirt by $ 4,862."
"Response:  $ 109
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the cost of each football jersey is $86 and the cost of each t-shirt is $232. Therefore, if we subtract the cost of a t-shirt from the total revenue generated by selling 254 football jerseys and 43 t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas, we get:

$ 86 x 254 = $ 21,744
$ 232 x 43 = $ 9,666
Total revenue = $ 31,408

Now, let's find out how much more does a football jersey cost than a t-shirt:

Cost of football jersey - Cost of t-shirt = $ 109

Therefore, the answer to the question is $109."

So, the price of a football shirt is $90 more than the price of a t-shirt."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs. Therefore, there are 5 x 10 = 50 chairs in total. Since they want to hold an evening party in their backyard, there must be at least one chair for every two people attending the party. So, if there are 50 chairs and 20 people will attend the party (as assumed), then there will be 50 / 20 = 2.5 chairs per person. Since you cannot have a fraction of a chair, there will be 3 extra chairs left over after everyone is seated."
Response: 4 stools per table. Therefore, there are 48 stools in total (12 tables x 4 stools/table).
Response: 3
Response:  There are 13 x 11 = 143 stools in total at their backyard.
"Response: 3
Explanation: If there are 10 tables and 6 stools per table, then the total number of stools is 6 x 10 = 60. Since there are 11 people sitting at the tables, that means 50 people (11 x 4) are not sitting on any stool. Therefore, 3 stools remain unoccupied."
Response: 30 stools. Explanation: According to the question, they have 12 tables and 14 chairs, which means they have 12 x 14 = 168 seats available for guests. Additionally, there are 6 extra chairs, so they have a total of 168 + 6 = 30 additional stools for guests.
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, they have 4 sets of tables with 3 stools each, for a total of 12 stools. If there are 14 people attending the party, then they will need an additional 3 stools (for a total of 15 stools). Therefore, the answer is 5."
"Response: 5
Explanation: If they have 14 stools and 9 parties of tables (which means they have 9 x 2 = 18 tables), then they will need more than 14 stools to accommodate all the guests. Therefore, there are 5 extra stools needed."

"Response: 3548$

Explanation:
Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, which is equal to $44,920 in total. If he has to pay $702 in taxes, then at the end of the season, he will have $44,218 left ($44,920 - $702)."
Response: 1357 x 73 = $96,801
Response: 457 dollars.
"Response: 5860

Explanation:
Lewis earns $403 per week for 233 weeks during the harvest season. To find out how much he earns in total, we can multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he works:

$403 x 233 = $91,730

Now, Lewis has to pay $49 per week as rent. To find out how much he pays in total, we can multiply his weekly rent by the number of weeks he works:

$49 x 233 = $11,317

So, Lewis earns $91,730 and spends $11,317 on rent, leaving him with $80,413."
"Response: 40200

Explanation:
Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks, which is equal to $474,620 over one year. Since he has to pay $388 per week in rent during the harvest season, he pays a total of $16,728 in rent ($388 x 1359 weeks) over one year. Therefore, his net income after paying rent is $457,892 ($474,620 - $16,728)."

"Response: 36 feet
Explanation:
The given information can be represented in the following equation:
Let D = height of Din (feet)
Let W = depth of water (times greater than height of Din)
So, we have:
D + 9 = W(10)
Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:
W = 36
Therefore, the depth of water is 36 feet more than the height of Din."
"Response: 20 feet
Explanation: According to the passage, Dyn is 8 feet below Ron, and Ron stands at 14 feet above water level. Therefore, the depth of the water is 20 feet (14 - 8 = 6 + 8 = 20)."
"Response: 90 feet
Explanation:
According to the passage, ""Після відпочинку вони вирішили поплавати."" This means that they decided to go swimming after their rest.
The next sentence states, ""Глибока вода в 5 разів вище за висоту Рона."" This means that the deep water is five times higher than Ron's height.
We are then told that Dyn is 3 meters (9.84 feet) below Ron. So, if Rona is 12 feet tall, and Dyn is 3 meters below him, we can calculate the depth of the water as follows:
Depth = Height of Rona + Depth of Dyn
= 12 ft + (-3 m)
= 90 ft
Therefore, the depth of the water was 90 feet."
"Response: 20 feet
Explanation: According to the passage, Dine is 4 feet higher than Ron, and the water is 15 times deeper than Dine's height. Therefore, if Ronaldo stands at 13 feet tall, then the depth of the water would be 20 feet (15 x 4 = 60)."
"Response: 40 feet
Explanation: According to the passage, ""Після відпочинку вони вирішили поплавати."" This means that they decided to go swimming after their rest. The next sentence states, ""Глибокість води в 16 разів перевищує висоту Рона."" This translates to ""The depth of water is 16 times greater than Ron's height."" Since Ron is 9 feet tall, and the depth of water is 16 times greater than his height, the depth of water would be 16 x 9 = 144 feet. However, the question asks for the glyoby (глибина) of water, which is different from its depth (глибина). Therefore, we can conclude that the glyoby of water was 40 feet."
"Response: 270 feet
Explanation:
We know that Ronaldo is 15 feet tall and Dino is 6 feet shorter than him, so their height difference is 9 feet (15 - 6 = 9).
The water is 9 times deeper than Ron's height, which means it is 9 x 15 = 135 feet deep for Ron. Since Dino is 6 feet shorter than Ron, the water depth for Dino would be 135 - 6 = 130 feet.
Therefore, the gist of the question is asking about the water depth at the location where they decided to swim after resting. The correct answer is 270 feet or 82 meters."

Explanation: According to the question, Peyдж and her mother planted 45 seeds in 9 clumps. If they placed an equal amount of seeds in each flower pot, then the number of seeds they placed in each clump is 45 / 9 = 5. Therefore, if they planted 5 seeds in each clump, the total number of seeds they planted is 5 x 9 = 45."
Response:  There were 58 kernels that germinated and grew into plants in each of the three gardens, so there were 58 x 3 = 174 plants grown overall.
Response: 37 flowers. Explanation: According to the passage, Peyдж and her mother planted 55 seeds in total, and they placed 15 seeds in each of the five gardens. Since only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each garden, the total number of flowers that Peyдж and her mother grew is 60 x 5 = 300 flowers. However, since they only had 55 seeds to start with, there are 37 flowers left over after accounting for those that did not grow (300 - 55 = 37).

"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Matviy gave an equal number of creamers to his 18 friends. If he had 36 creamers in total, and there were 18 friends, then each friend received 2 creamers (36 / 18 = 2)."
Response: 4
Response: 4 creamers. Explanation: According to the question, Mattyev had 23 creamers and gave an equal number of creamers to his friends. Therefore, after he gave away some creamers, he had 11 creamers left. If each friend got an equal number of creamers, then the number of creamers each friend received is 11 / (number of friends) = 4 creamers per friend.
Response: 5
"Response:  Each of Matthew's friends received an equal number of creamers and pies from him. If he initially had 32 creamers and 98 pies, then each friend received:

Number of creamers = Total number of creamers / Number of friends

= 8 creamers per friend

Similarly, each friend received:

Number of pies = Total number of pies / Number of friends
= 98 / 4
= 24 pies per friend"
Response:  Each of Matthew's friends ate an equal number of creamers and pies, so they ate 2 creamers and 2 pies each. Therefore, there are 20 creamers left (10 x 2) and 16 pies left (8 x 2).

Response: 98 students x 7 school buses = 696 seats in total.
Response: 84 x 95 = 7900 students in school
"Response: 10
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus. Since there are 67 classes in the school and each class has 66 students, the total number of students is 67 x 66 = 4282. If each bus can hold 6 students, then we need 4282 / 6 = 713 buses for the trip. Therefore, the answer is 10 buses."
"Response: 46
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Number of classes = 87
Number of students per class = 58
Number of seats in each bus = 2
To calculate the number of buses needed for the trip, we can use the following formula: Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of seats in each bus.
Plugging in the values from the question, we get:
Number of buses = 87 classes x 58 students/class / 2 seats/bus = 46 buses
Therefore, the school needs 46 buses to transport all the students for the field trip."
"Response: 36
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x classes in total. Since each class has an equal number of students, we can write:
x = 120 / n
where n is the number of students per class.
Since there are 24 classrooms, we have:
n = 24 / x
Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
x = (120 / 24) = 36
Therefore, there are 36 classes in the school."
"Response: 4
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed to transport all the students without those who do not want to go on the trip, we need to divide the total number of students (102) by the capacity of each bus (8). This gives us 13 buses (102 / 8 = 13). Since 22 students have expressed their unwillingness to go on the trip, subtracting them from the total number of students gives us the number of buses required for the trip: 13 - 22 = 4 buses."
"Response: 34
Explanation: According to the question, there are 102 students in the class and 11 students who do not want to go on the trip. Therefore, the number of students who will be going on the trip is 102 - 11 = 91 students. Since there are 99 seats available in each school bus, the number of students who can fit in each bus is 99 / 91 = 1.09 (or approximately 11 students per bus). So, in total, there will be 11 students per bus x 5 buses = 55 students going on the trip."
"Response: 46
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus. Since there are 72 classrooms in the school and each bus can hold 3 students per seat, we have:

Total number of students = 72 x 3 = 216

So, to accommodate all the students, the school will need 216 / 46 = 4.8 buses. Therefore, the answer is 5 buses."
Response: 350 seats in each bus. Explanation: Let's assume that all 46 school buses are fully occupied with students. Since there are 92 students in total, and each bus can carry an average of 350 students (based on the typical capacity of a school bus), we have: Number of buses = 46 Total number of students = 92 Capacity per bus = 350 students So, there are 350 seats in each school bus.

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Hayley gave 5 cubes to each boy, so she gave a total of 5 x 4 = 20 cubes. Since there are 10 cubes in total, this means that Hayley has 10 - 20 = -10 cubes left."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Haley has 23 cubes and wants to keep 15 for herself. This means that the remaining number of cubes is 23 - 15 = 8. Since there are four boys who like to play with the cubes, each boy will receive 8 / 4 = 2 cubes. Therefore, the number of cubes received by the boys is 2."
"Response: 26/13 = 2
Explanation: According to the question, there are 13 boys who like playing with cups and 50 boys who like playing cards. If Haley has 26 cups, then each boy will receive 26 / 13 = 2 cups."
"Response: 40
Explanation: If Hayley has 20 cups and each cup contains an equal number of marbles as there are boys in her class who like to play with marbles, then she will have 40 marbles in total (20 cups x 2 marbles per cup)."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave each boy two marbles. If she had 28 marbles in total, then she must have given them to 14 boys."
"Response: 70 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Frank read 14 pages of his favorite book every day. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages (392) by the number of pages he reads per day (14): 392 / 14 = 28 days. However, since Frank started reading the book at the beginning of the week, he had 7 days off from reading, so he actually needed 70 days to finish the book (28 + 70)."
Response: 104 pages
"Response: 35
Explanation:
Let's assume that Frenk read x pages per day. Since he needed 6 days to finish the book, we can write an equation:
x + (6 \* x) = 612
Simplifying the equation:
7x = 612
Dividing both sides by 7:
x = 89
Therefore, Frank read 89 pages per day."
"Response: 31
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Frank was reading his favorite book.
* The book had 555 pages.
* The book was divided into 5 chapters.
* It took Frank 220 days to finish the book.

Now, let's calculate the number of pages in each chapter:

Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 555 pages / 5 chapters
= 111 pages per chapter

So, there were 111 pages in each chapter that Frank read."
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Frank read 193 pages of his favorite book, which is equally divided into 15 chapters. To calculate how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book. Since Frank needed 660 days to complete the book, he read approximately 24 pages per day (660 / 193 = 24)."
"Response: 105
Explanation:
Let's assume that Frenk read x pages per day. Since he needed 3 days to finish each book, the total number of pages he read in 3 days is 3x.
Since there are 249 pages in each book, we can set up the equation:
3x = 249
Solving for x, we get:
x = 86
So, Frank read 86 pages per day."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read some books and each book had 66 pages. It took him 12 days to finish each book, so he needed 492 days (or 1 year) to finish all the books if he read 3 of them."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Frank needed 16 days to finish his favorite book, which means he read an average of 3 pages per day (16 days / 112 pages = 3 pages/day)."
"Response: 30 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 8 pages per day, and the book had 576 pages in total. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 576 / 8 = 72 days. However, since the question asks for the number of days Frank needed to ""finish"" the book, which implies that he has already started reading it, we can round down to 30 days."
"Response: 900
Explanation:
The book had 41 chapters with 450 pages each, making it a total of 18,600 pages in the book. Since Frank took 30 days to finish reading the book, he read an average of 620 pages per day (18,600 / 30)."
Response: 3 x 594 = 1782
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Frank read an book that had 2 chapters with 405 pages each. It took him 664 days to finish reading the book, which means he read one chapter per day. Therefore, the answer is 3."

"Response: 146
Explanation:
If there are 290 bananas and they are divided into two groups of 146 each, then the number of bananas in each group is:

Number of bananas in each group = Total number of bananas / Number of groups
= 290 / 2
= 145

Therefore, there are 146 bananas in each group."
"Response: 40
Explanation: If there are 384 apples and 192 bananas, and we divide the bananas into groups of 345, then each group will contain 345/192 = 40 bananas. Similarly, if we divide the apples into groups of 16, then each group will contain 384/16 = 24 apples."

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 58"
"Response: 39

Explanation:
The total number of pink bottles (both regular and diet) is 83. Since there are 61 diet sodas, that means there were 22 regular sodas. Therefore, the difference between the number of diet sodas and regular sodas is 22 - 22 = 0. So, the answer is 0."
Response: 79 pints (30 regular soda + 8 diet soda + 41 apples)
"Response: 18 (79 - 53 = 26; 26 > 18)."
Response: 107 (83 - 54)
Response: 5 pints (or 3 liters) of diet soda were consumed by the customers in total.
Response: 40 (the difference between 60 and 19).
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, there were 72 bottles of regular soda and 32 bottles of diet soda. However, there were more jars of jam (78) than bottles of soda. Therefore, the difference between the number of bottles and jars is 40 (78 - 32)."
"Response: 27
Explanation: According to the question, there were 36 jabluks and 80 plastic bottles of regular soda. Therefore, the total number of bottles was 80 + 36 = 116. However, among these bottles, there were also 54 dietetic sodas, which means that the total number of bottles containing soda was 116 - 54 = 62. So, there were 27 more bottles than jabluks in the store."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, there were 30 pouches of soda in total, and 28 of them were regular gas-filled ones. Therefore, the number of dietetic sodas they drank is 7 (28 - 28 = 0)."
Response: 321 pints
Response: 100 pints. Explanation: The total number of plastic bottles in the store is given as 57 + 26 = 83. Since there are 8 fluid ounces (fl oz) in a pint, we can convert the total number of plastic bottles to pints by dividing each value by 8 fl oz: 83 / 8 fl oz = 10 pints. Therefore, there were 100 pints of soda in the store.
"Response: 21
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 81 pints of regular soda, 60 pints of diet soda, and 60 pints of carbonated soda. To find out how many more pints of regular soda there were than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of pints of soda:

Total number of pints of soda = 81 + 60 + 60 = 191
Number of diet sodas = 60
Difference between regular and diet sodas = Total number of pints of soda - Number of diet sodas = 191 - 60 = 131
Therefore, there were 21 more pints of regular soda than diet soda."

"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 317 guests at Buckingham Palace yesterday and 295 visitors the day before. Therefore, the number of additional visitors today is:

Additional visitors = Number of visitors today - Number of visitors yesterday
= 317 - 295
= 40
So, there are 40 more visitors at Buckingham Palace today than there were yesterday."
"Response: 190
Explanation:
If there were 703 guests who visited Buckingham Palace in the previous day and Racheal found out that only 246 visitors came to the palace in the current day, then we can calculate the number of visitors who visited the palace over the past 25 days as follows:
Number of visitors = Total number of guests / Number of days
= 703 / 25
= 190
Therefore, the answer is 190."
"Response: 34
Explanation: According to the question, there were 666 visitors in the previous day and 100 guests visited Buckingham Palace after they prepared food. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors in the previous day and the number of visitors after they prepared food is 34 (100 - 666)."
"Response: 406 / 327 = 1.25

Explanation:
To find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace in the previous day, we need to divide the number of visitors who attended the palace that day (406) by the number of days passed since the last time they visited (327). Therefore, the answer is 1.25."
"Response: 36701
Explanation:
According to the passage, 45 guests arrived at Buckingham Palace in the previous day, and Racheal found out that 829 people visited the palace over the last 85 days. Therefore, we can calculate the number of visitors per day as follows:
Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 829 / 85
= 9.8
Now, let's find out how many visitors came to the palace on the day Racheal visited by multiplying the average number of visitors per day by the number of days since the previous day:
Number of visitors on the day Racheal visited = Average number of visitors per day x Number of days since the previous day
= 9.8 x 1
= 9.8
Therefore, 36701 visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel visited."
"Response: 260

Explanation:

Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in each day is X. Since there were 557 guests who visited the palace on the day after Racheal and her friend went there, we can write an equation:

X + 188 = 557

Now, let's solve for X using subtraction:

X = 369

So, there were 369 visitors to Buckingham Palace in each of the previous 57 days."
"Response: 41
Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, there were 39 paintings at Buckingham Palace and 661 visitors came to the palace that day. On the previous day, there were 600 visitors. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors on those two days is:
661 - 600 = 61
So, more people visited Buckingham Palace today than yesterday by 41 visitors (61 - 20)."
"Response: 567

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* After cooking food, they went to see Buckingham Palace.
* Rachel found out that 92 guests had arrived at Buckingham Palace that day.
* In the previous days, there were 419 visitors and 103 visitors per day.

To find out how many visitors have visited Buckingham Palace until that day, we can use the following formula:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days

Plugging in the values given in the question, we get:

Number of visitors = 567

Therefore, the answer to the question is 567."
"Response: 3650

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* After cooking food, they went to see Buckingham Palace.
* Rachel found out that there were 512 guests at Buckingham Palace today.
* In the previous day, there were 471 guests.
* In the day before that, there were 808 guests.

To find out how many visitors have visited Buckingham Palace over the last 89 days, we can use the following calculation:

Number of visitors = Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors the day before - Number of visitors 89 days ago
= 471 + (-808) + (-512)
= 3650

Therefore, the answer is 3650 visitors."
Response: 705 - 191 = 514 additional visitors to Buckingham Palace in this day compared to the previous 245 days.
Response:  If he already has 470 grams of wax and needs an additional 159 grams to glue the feathers together, then he currently has 628 grams of wax (470 + 159 = 628).
"Response: 30 grams.
Explanation: According to the passage, the man has 288 grams of wax for gluing feathers and needs 49 grams of colors to paint them. Therefore, he already has 260 grams of wax (288 - 49 = 260)."
Response:  There are currently 22 grams of wax in his list, so he needs an additional 331 grams to reach the total amount required for all the feathers (353 - 22 = 331).
Response: 34 grams of wax are needed to glue together all the feathers. Since he currently has 20 grams of wax, how many more grams does he need? Solution: To find out how many more grams of wax he needs, we can subtract the amount of wax he already has (20 grams) from the total amount of wax needed (166 grams): 166 - 20 = 146 grams. Therefore, he needs an additional 146 grams of wax.
"Response: 39 grams of wax are needed to glue together all the feathers. If he currently has 557 grams of wax and needs only 17 grams in total, how many grams of wax does he need for each feather?

Solution: To find out how much wax is needed for each feather, we can divide the total amount of wax needed (17 grams) by the number of feathers (40). So, each feather requires 0.4286 grams of wax (17 / 40)."
Response:  He needs an additional 483 grams of wax (492 - 11 = 483).

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, if 90 bottles of wine were filled during a 6-day period, then the number of bottles that could be filled per day is:

90 / 6 = 15
So, there could have been 15 bottles of wine filled each day."
"Response: 41.2 (41.3)
Explanation: According to the passage, it took 5 days to fill 90 barrels of wine, which means that they filled 18 barrels per day ($ \therefore $ 18 \text{ barrels} / 5 \text{ days} = 3.6 \text{ barrels} / \text{day}$). Since there were 266 collectors who helped him, each collector contributed $\boxed{\frac{3.6}{266}} = \boxed{41.2 (\boxed{41.3})}$ barrels of wine per day."
"Response: 5080
Explanation:
The passage states that there are 244 booths of grape juice per day and 47 booths of blackberry juice per day. This means that in total, they can fill 244 + 47 = 291 booths per day. Since there are 146 days left after the last stop, we can calculate the total number of booths filled as follows: Total number of booths = Number of booths per day x Number of days left = 291 x 146 = 43,566 booths. Therefore, the answer is 43,566."
"Response: 4968
Explanation:
The passage states that there are 221 bottles of wine filled per day and 100 baskets of grapes filled per day, for a total of 321 baskets filled per day. Since there are 77 days in the period covered by the passage, we can calculate the total number of baskets filled during this time as follows:

Total baskets = Number of baskets per day x Number of days
= 321 baskets/day x 77 days
= 24,777 baskets

Since each basket contains 100 bottles of wine, we can calculate the total number of bottles of wine filled during the 77-day period as follows:

Total bottles = Total baskets x Number of bottles per basket
= 24,777 baskets x 100 bottles/basket
= 2,477,700 bottles

Therefore, over the course of 77 days, it would be possible to fill 2,477,700 bottles of wine using the information provided in the passage."

Response: 30 packages of cookies. Explanation: According to the question, you had 26 bags with equal amounts of cookies. If you had 15 cukes and 52 cookies in total, then you have 30 packages of cookies.
"Response: 30
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 14 bags with equal number of cookies and each bag contains 28 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is 28 x 14 = 376 cookies. Since there are also 86 cukes in total, the number of packages of peanut butter is 376 / 86 = 4.3 packages. So, there are approximately 4 packages of peanut butter in total."
Response:  There are 5 houses in each block, and Postman gives away 5 pieces of incorrect mail to each house. Therefore, he gives away a total of 5 x 5 = 25 pieces of incorrect mail in one quarter.
"Response: 180
Explanation:
If Postman needs to deliver 9 pieces of unwanted mail in each house in every quarter, and there are 20 houses in each quarter, then he will need to deliver a total of 180 pieces of unwanted mail (9 x 20)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Since there are 6 houses in the quarter and the postman needs to deliver 24 pieces of undeliverable mail to each house, he will need to deliver a total of 144 pieces of undeliverable mail (24 x 6 = 144)."
"Response: 70
Explanation:
The total number of houses in a quarter is given as 14 x 4 = 56. Since Postman sends 2 letters that are not interesting to each block, he will send a total of 56 x 2 = 112 letters in the entire quarter. Therefore, there are 112 / 7 = 16 blocks in the quarter."
"Response: 48
Explanation: To determine how many pieces of undeliverable mail the postman should deliver to each quarter, we need to divide the total number of undeliverable letters (32) by the number of houses in each quarter (20). Therefore, the postman will deliver 48 pieces of undeliverable mail to each quarter."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, the postman needs to give 30 pieces of unwanted mail to each of the 78 quarters. Since there are 19 houses in each quarter, the postman needs to give 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house (since 30 / 19 = 4)."
Response: 104 houses in each quarter.
"Response: 360
Explanation:
Since there are 81 quarters and each quarter has 12 houses, the total number of houses in all 81 quarters is 972 (12 x 81). Since the postman needs to deliver 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house, he will need to deliver a total of 360 pieces of unwanted mail (972 houses x 4 pieces per house)."
"Response: 280
Explanation:
In each quarter, Postman must give 4 pieces of undesired mail to each house. Since there are 16 quarters in total, he needs to give 4 x 16 = 64 pieces of undesired mail in total. Therefore, the number of pieces of undesired mail that Postman must give in total is 64 + 64 = 128."

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Rebecca wants to divide her egg collection into 3 groups. She has 4 cups and 15 eggs in total. To find out how many eggs will be in each group, we can divide the number of eggs by the number of cups. Since there are 4 cups, each cup will hold 15/4 = 3.75 eggs. So, there will be 3 groups with 3.75 eggs in each group."

"Response: 20 trees
Explanation: According to the question, John used 4 gwods of nails to build the wall of his house. If each tree requires two nails, then he needs 8 trees for one side of the wall (since there are four gwods of nails). Therefore, he needs 20 trees in total to build the entire wall."
Response: 25 gvozdy (gvozdy is the Russian word for nails).
Response: 5 dozens of planks. Explanation: According to the question, John used 11 nails to pierce large wooden boards for the wall of his house. If each board requires three nails to be nailed onto it, and there were additional 8 nails used, then John needed 5 dozens (or 60) of planks to build one side of the wall.
Response: 17 gwynnies (gwynnies are fictional units of measurement).
Response: 40 gwods (gvozdy)
Response: 56 trees are needed for John's wall. Explanation: According to the question, each tree requires 74 nails for installation. Since there are 8 large boards in total, we need to divide the number of nails by 8 to find out how many trees are required. Therefore, 56 trees are needed for John's wall.
Response: 30 doorks. Explanation: According to the question, John used 12 large boards and 17 small boards for the wall of his house. Each large board requires 14 nails, and each small board requires 25 nails. Therefore, in total, John needs 12 x 14 = 168 nails and 17 x 25 = 425 nails, respectively. So, the total number of nails needed is 168 + 425 = 593 nails. Since there are 30 doorks in one package of nails (as mentioned in the problem), John needs 593 / 30 = 19.7 doorks for the wall of his house.

Explanation: According to the question, there are 4502 spades and 4276 rubber bands in Steve's collection. If they are organized into groups of 154 each, then the size of each group is 154."
"Response: 27
Explanation:
Let's assume that each group contains an equal number of spades and hearts (since they are equally likely to be chosen). Therefore, the total number of cards in each group is:

Number of spades x Number of hearts = Total number of cards per group
= 3941 x 4950 = 1866150
Since there are 495 groups, the total number of cards in all groups is:

Total number of cards per group x Number of groups = Total number of cards
= 1866150 x 495 = 935677500
So, there are approximately 93 billion cards in all possible combinations of 495 groups."
"Response: 42
