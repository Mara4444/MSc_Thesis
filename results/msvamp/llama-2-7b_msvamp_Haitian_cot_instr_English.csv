Response:  We know that Julia has 18 children and she wants to divide them equally among her 10 friends in Madagascar. So, we need to find out how many children each friend will get. To do this, we can use division.  Division is used to share something equally among a group of people or objects. In this case, we are dividing 18 children equally among 10 friends, so we can use the following formula: Number of children per friend = Total number of children / Number of friends  Formula: Number of children per friend = 18 / 10 = 18/10 = 18/5 = 3.6 Children per friend Therefore, each of Julia's 10 friends in Madagascar will receive approximately 3.6 children.;
Response:  If there are 11 children in Julia's class and she has to share them equally among 12 friends from Madagascar, then each friend will get 93% of Julia's share (since 12 x 93 = 1096). So, the number of children that each friend from Madagascar will get is:  Number of children per friend = Total number of children / Number of friends = 1096 / 12 = 91.;

Response:  We have to find out how many pieces of candy are in total and then divide them into two groups (big and small). So, let's start counting!  Total number of candies = 8 + 10 + 4 = 22 candies. Now, we need to divide these candies into two groups: big and small. For the big group, we will take 15 candies (since there are 15 candies in the big bag), and for the small group, we will take 7 candies (since there are 7 candies in the small bag). Therefore, the ratio of big to small candies is 15:7 or 3:2.;
Response:  We have to find out how many pieces of candy are in each bag and then add them up.  For example, if we have one big bag that contains 10 small bags, and each small bag has 5 pieces of candy, then we have a total of 50 pieces of candy (10 x 5 = 50).  Similarly, if we have another big bag that contains 20 small bags, and each small bag has 6 pieces of candy, then we have a total of 120 pieces of candy (20 x 6 = 120).  So, the total number of pieces of candy is 50 + 120 = 170 pieces of candy.;

Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total weight of all the peaches in the basket. We know that there are 15 peaches in the basket and each peach weighs approximately 0.6 kg or 600 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all the peaches is: 15 x 0.6 = 9 kg (or 900 grams) Now, let's consider the weight of the basket itself. The basket has a capacity of 8 pounds or 3.6 kilograms. So, the weight of the basket alone is: 3.6 kg Since we want to find out how much of the basket is filled with peaches, we need to subtract the weight of the basket from the total weight of the peaches. Therefore, the amount of peaches in the basket is: Total weight of peaches - Weight of basket = 9 kg - 3.6 kg = 5.4 kg (or 540 grams) Finally, we can convert this value into pounds by dividing it by 2.2, since there are 2.2 pounds in one kilogram. Therefore, the approximate weight of peaches in the basket is: 5.4 kg / 2.2 = 2.4 pounds (or 1.09 kilograms);
Response:  We have 7 peaches and we want to know how many peach juice boxes of 8 peches each can be made from them. So, we need to divide 7 peaches by 8 peches per box.  Therefore, we can make 7/8 = 0.875 or approximately 9 boxes of peach juice.;

According to the question, Konbyen has 7 peches more than Chak Panyen, so the number of peches in Konbyen is 21 + 7 = 28 peches. Therefore, the answer is 28 peches.;
Response:  We have to calculate the sum of all the pieces in each generation and then add them up.  Generation 10 has 18 pieces, so we multiply it by 10 to get the total number of pieces for that generation:  Generation 10: 18 x 10 = 180 pieces. Now let's move on to generation 11. Since there are 5 more pieces in generation 11 than in generation 10, we need to multiply the number of pieces in generation 10 by 1. 5. This gives us the total number of pieces for generation 11:  Generation 11: 180 x 1.05 = 192.5 pieces. Finally, we add up the total number of pieces from both generations to get the overall total: Overall Total: 192.5 + 180 = 372.5 pieces. So the overall total number of pieces is 372.5.;

Response:  We have to calculate how many pieces of candy are in each bag and then add them up.  For Gen 7 bags, there are 5 candies per bag. So, we multiply 5 by 10 to get 50 candies from those bags. Now, for Gen 10 bags, there are 3 candies per bag. So, we multiply 3 by 2 to get 6 candies from those bags. Finally, we add up all these numbers to get our total: 50 + 6 = 56 candies. Therefore, the total number of candies is 56.;
Response:  We have 4 peanuts in one hand and 3 peanuts in another hand. If we add them together, we get a total of 7 peanuts. So, if we want to know how many peanuts are in both hands combined, we can simply add the number of peanuts in each hand together, which gives us 11 peanuts (7 + 4).;
Response:  We have 12 peches in all (including those from Gen 2 and Gen 4). If we divide them equally among all the generations, each generation will get 3 peches (since there are 4 generations in total). So, the total number of peches that Konbiyen has is 3 x 4 = 12 peches.;
Response:  If Gen Yon has 16 peches in his pocket and he gives 13 of them to Kéki, then Gen Yon will have 16 - 13 = 3 peches left in his pocket. So, Konbiyen (Kéki) will have 3 peches from Gen Yon's pocket.;
Response:  We have 19 peanuts and we want to know how many will be left if 4 are taken away. So, after taking 4 peanuts away, we have 19 - 4 = 15 peanuts left. Now, let's ask another question: How many peanuts do we have in total if we add 15 peanuts from the first group and 15 peanuts from the second group? Therefore, the total number of peanuts is 15 + 15 = 30 peanuts.;
Response:  We have 10 peches and we want to distribute them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 2.5 peches (10/4=2.5). Now let's say we have 6 more peches that were not distributed earlier. We can give 3 of these peches to each of the 4 people, since they didn't get any earlier. So each person will now have 5.5 peches (2.5+3=5.5).;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many peanuts are in one pan of peanut butter. According to the question, there are 60 peanuts in one pan of peanut butter. Now, let's calculate how many peanuts are in two pans of peanut butter. If there are 60 peanuts in one pan, then there will be twice as many peanuts in two pans, which is 120 peanuts. So, the total number of peanuts in two pans of peanut butter is 120. Finally, if we want to know how many peanuts are in all the peanut butter that Konbyen has, we just need to multiply the number of peanuts in each pan by the number of pans he has. Therefore, the total number of peanuts in all the peanut butter that Konbyen has is 120 x 5 = 600 peanuts.;
Response:  If there are 4 actions in the first stage and we add 2 more actions to that stage, then there will be a total of 6 actions in the first stage (4 + 2 = 6). Now, if we move on to the second stage and add another action, then there will be a total of 7 actions in the second stage (6 + 1 = 7). Therefore, the total number of actions is 7 + 6 = 13.;
Response:  If we have 7 actions in one day and each action takes 3 minutes to complete, then the total time spent on those actions is: Time = Number of actions x Duration per action = 7 x 3 = 21 minutes. Now, if we want to know how many times we can repeat this process in a week (which has 7 days), we need to divide the total time by the duration of one day: Time / Day length = 21 min/day / 7 days = 3 minutes per day. So, we can repeat these 7 actions approximately 3 times per day. Therefore, the total number of actions we can perform in a week is: Total actions = Number of repetitions per day x Number of days = 3 x 7 = 21 actions.;
Response:  We have 4 Jerry figurines and each one has 22 lives. So we have 4 x 22 = 88 lives in total. Now, let's add 6 action figures to the equation. Each action figure has 10 attacks, so we have 6 x 10 = 60 attacks in total. Therefore, our final answer is 88 + 60 = 148.;
Response:  If Jerry has 5 actions to take in 9 lives, and he adds 7 more actions for each life, then the total number of actions Jerry needs to take is: 5 x 9 = 45 + 7 x 9 = 63 = 108 actions. So, Jerry needs to take 108 actions to complete all his tasks.;
Response:  We have 10 lives in total and we want to add 4 actions for each life. So, the total number of actions is 10 x 4 = 40 actions.;
Response:  Jerry has 8 figures in his pocket and he adds 10 lots of money to it. So, the new amount is $8 + $10 = $18. Therefore, the total amount of money Jerry has now is $18.;
Response:  If Jerry has 7 figures in his account and he adds $2 to each of the 2 lives he owns, then he will have $14 for the first life and $16 for the second life. So, the total amount of money Jerry has is $14 + $16 = $30.;
Response:  If Jerry has 5 figures in his account and he adds $9 to it, then his new balance will be $5 + $9 = $14. So, there are 14 lots of living expenses that Jerry can afford with the money in his account.;
Response:  We have to add 4 actions to the current action (Jerry) and then subtract 5 fine actions from the total number of actions. So, we can calculate it as follows:  Total number of actions = Current action + Additional actions - Fine actions  Total number of actions = Jerry + 4 + (-5) = 9  Therefore, the total number of actions is 9.;
Response:  If Jerry has 3 actions to take in his hand and he adds 4 more actions from the deck to his hand, then he will have a total of 7 actions (3 + 4 = 7). Now, if he wants to retire 5 cards from his hand, he can do so because he has 7 actions available to him. So, the answer is 7.;
Response:  If Jerry has 7 actions in his hand and he adds another action to each of the 8 cards in his deck, then he will have added a total of 56 new actions (7 x 8 = 56) to his deck. So, after adding these new actions, Jerry will have a total of 63 actions in his deck (7 + 56 = 63).;
Response:  If Jerry adds 2 actions to his deck and then takes away 7 cards from the top of the deck, he will have 10 new actions in his deck. So, there are 10 new actions in Jerry's deck after these operations.;
Response:  If Jerry has 9 actions in his hand and he adds 7 more actions to it, then he will have 16 actions in total (9 + 7 = 16). Now, if each action can be used multiple times, then for every 10 lives in the game, Jerry can use one action per life. So, if there are 10 lives in the game, Jerry can use 10 x 1 = 10 actions. Therefore, the final answer is 16 - 10 = 6 actions that Jerry can use in the game.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many actions Jerry can take in one day. According to the question, Jerry has 3 lives and he can take 4 actions per life. Therefore, Jerry can take a total of 12 actions (3 lives x 4 actions/life) in one day. Now, let's consider what happens when Jerry takes an action. The question states that for every action taken, Jerry loses 1 life. So, if Jerry takes 2 actions, he will lose 2 lives. Finally, the question asks us to calculate how many actions Jerry can take before losing all his lives. Based on the above calculations, Jerry can take a maximum of 6 actions (12 actions - 2 lost lives) before losing all his lives.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to add 7 + 3 = 10 actions that Jerry can take in the kitchen. Then, we need to add 2 more actions for each of the 5 dishes he wants to prepare, which is a total of 10 x 5 = 50 actions. Therefore, the final answer is 60 actions (10 + 50).;
Response:  We have 6 swazos in total (4 + 2). Each swazo has 10 pieces of candy inside it. So, we multiply 6 with 10 to get the total number of candies inside all the swazos: 6 x 10 = 60. Therefore, there are 60 candies inside all the swazos combined.;
Response:  We have 4 lots of sugar in one container and we want to know how many lots of sugar are there in another container that contains 5 cups of sugar. So, if we convert 1 cup of sugar into lots, we will get: 1 cup = 2 Zwazos (based on the information given) Therefore, 5 cups of sugar = 5 x 2 Zwazos = 10 Zwazos.;
Response:  We have 4 storks and each can carry 4 babies. So we have 4 x 4 = 16 babies in total. Now let's see how many babies are left after 6 of them were taken away. Therefore, the number of babies left is 16 - 6 = 10.;
Response:  We have 3 storks and they can carry 2 cubes each. So in total, we have 6 cubes that the storks can carry. Now, there are 5 lots of cubes to be transported. Therefore, each stork will need to transport 1 cube (since there are 5 lots and 6 cubes per stork).;
Response:  We have 3 storks and we want to know how many babies they can carry at once. So, each stork can carry one baby. Therefore, there will be 3 babies in total.;
Response:  We have 2 large storks and 6 small storks in total. The big storks can carry 3 little storks at once. So, how many times can we put all the small storks on one of the big storks?  Therefore, the number of times the small storks can be carried is 6 / 1 = 6.;
Response:  We have 4 storks and we want to know how many storks there are in total. So, if each stork can carry 6 babies, then the total number of babies carried by all 4 storks is 4 x 6 = 24 babies. Therefore, there are 24 babies in total.;
Response:  We have 3 white swans and 4 black swans in total. Now we need to find out how many pairs of swans are there. So, we divide the total number of swans (3 + 4 = 7) by 2, which gives us 3.5 pairs of swans. Since we can't have half a pair, we round it up to 4 pairs of swans. Therefore, there are 4 pairs of swans in front of you.;
Response:  We have 6 storks and we want to know how many of them can fit in a basket. So, let's divide 6 by 3, which gives us 2. Therefore, 2 storks can fit in a basket.;
Response:  We have 4 white swans and 3 black swans in total. Now we need to find out how many swans are there in front of you. So, let's multiply the number of white swans with 2 and add it to the number of black swans. Therefore, the answer is 8 (4 x 2 = 8 + 3).;
Response:  We have 6 birds that can fly at a time and each bird can carry 4 loads or 8 storks. So, in total we have 6 x 4 = 24 loads that can be carried by these 6 birds.;
Response:  We have 5 birds (zwazo) and they are sitting on 4 storks (storks). So we can say that each bird is sitting on one stork. Now let's count how many birds there are in total: 5 birds x 1 stork per bird = 5 storks. Therefore, there are 5 storks in total.;
Response:  We have 3 large birds (zwazo) and 2 small birds (plis). In total, we have 5 birds. Now, let's count how many times each bird can fly over the river Styx. The large birds (zwazo) can fly over the river 6 times, while the small birds (plis) can only fly over it once. Therefore, the final answer is: 5 x 6 = 30. So, there are 30 birds that can fly over the river Styx.;
Response:  We have 5 storks and they are carrying 3 babies each. So we have 15 babies in total. Now, there are 4 storks that will take these babies to their new homes. Therefore, the number of babies each stork will carry is 15/4 = 3.75 babies per stork.;
Response:  We have 6 storks and they are carrying 2 babies each. So, in total, we have 12 babies carried by the storks. Now, if 3 of these babies fall off along the way, then there will be 9 babies left with the storks. Therefore, the answer is 9.;
Response:  We have 3 large storks and 2 small storks in total. The big storks can carry 4 lotus flowers each, while the small storks can only carry 1 lotus flower each. So, we need to calculate how many lotus flowers all of them together can carry. Big storks can carry = 3 x 4 = 12 lotus flowers Small storks can carry = 2 x 1 = 2 lotus flowers Total number of lotus flowers they can carry = 12 + 2 = 14 lotus flowers;
Response:  We know that there are 48 verses in Genesis chapter 2 and 11 verses in Genesis chapter 11. So, if we want to find out how many verses are between these two chapters, we need to subtract the number of verses in Chapter 11 from the number of verses in Chapter 2. Therefore, the answer is: 48 - 11 = 37 verses.;
Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters in Genesis chapter 2 (Genesis 2:1-4).  So, we have to multiply 2 x 10 = 20 chapters between Genesis chapter 2 and Genesis chapter 37.  Therefore, there are 20 + 10 = 30 chapters between Genesis chapter 2 and Genesis chapter 37.  Now, let's calculate how many chapters are between Genesis chapter 37 and Genesis chapter 80.  There are 10 chapters between Genesis chapter 37 and Genesis chapter 50 (Genesis 37:27 - Genesis 50:26), so we add this number to the total number of chapters between Genesis chapter 2 and Genesis chapter 37, which gives us 30 + 10 = 40 chapters between Genesis chapter 37 and Genesis chapter 80.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 chapters in Genesis chapter 1-2 (Gen 1:1-2:3). If each chapter is approximately 48 verses long, then we have:  Total number of verses in Genesis chapter 1-2 = Number of chapters x Approximate number of verses per chapter  Total number of verses in Genesis chapter 1-2 = 7 x 48 = 336 verses Now, let's calculate how many verses are in each chapter:  Chapter 1 has 58 verses (Gen 1:1-2:3) Chapter 2 has 48 verses (Gen 2:4-25) Therefore, the total number of verses in both chapters combined is: Total number of verses in Chapters 1 and 2 = Number of verses in Chapter 1 + Number of verses in Chapter 2  Total number of verses in Chapters 1 and 2 = 58 + 48 = 106 verses So, if there are 93 verses in the book of Leviticus, and we assume that each verse is approximately 48 words long, then we can estimate the length of each chapter in Leviticus as follows:  Length of each chapter in Leviticus = Number of verses in chapter / Approximate number of words per verse  For example, Chapter 1 has 93 verses, so its estimated length is: Length of Chapter 1 in Leviticus = 93 verses / 48 words per verse = 2.00 chapters (rounded to the nearest whole number) Similarly, for Chapter 2, we have: Length of Chapter 2 in Leviticus = 93 verses / 48 words per verse = 2.00 chapters (rounded to the nearest whole number) Based on these calculations, we can conclude that Chapter 1 in Leviticus is approximately 2 chapters long, and Chapter 2 is also approximately 2 chapters long.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 chapters in Genesis chapter 1 (Genesis 1:1-31). Therefore, if we multiply 2 x 60 = 120 pages for each chapter, then the total number of pages for both chapters would be 120 + 120 = 240 pages. Now, let's move to the second part of the question where it asks about the length of Genesis chapter 36. According to the Bible, Genesis chapter 36 is 1 chapter long and has 40 verses (Genesis 36:1-40). So, the page count for this chapter would be 40 / 50 lines per verse = 0.8 pages. Therefore, adding up all these values, we get a total of 240 + 0.8 = 240.8 pages in the book of Genesis.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the length of each chapter in Genesis. According to the question, Chapter 1 is 3 chapters long (Genesis 1:1-3), and Chapter 2 is 66 chapters long (Genesis 2:1-66). Similarly, Chapter 3 is 35 chapters long (Genesis 3:1-35), and Chapter 4 is 24 chapters long (Genesis 4:1-24). Therefore, the total number of chapters in Genesis is:  Total Number of Chapters = 3 + 66 + 35 + 24 = 188 chapters.;
Response:  We have to find out how many pages are in each chapter and then add them up.  Chapter 1 has 91 pages, so it takes us 91/2 = 45.5 pages to read that chapter.  Chapter 2 has 23 pages, so it takes us 23/2 = 11.5 pages to read that chapter.  Chapter 3 has 25 pages, so it takes us 25/2 = 12.5 pages to read that chapter.  Now we need to calculate the total number of pages needed to read all three chapters:  Total pages needed to read all three chapters = (45.5 + 11.5 + 12.5) = 70 pages. Therefore, there are 70 pages left after reading the first three chapters.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many words are there in each chapter.  Genesis Chapter 3 has 47 words, Genesis Chapter 35 has 209 words, and Genesis Chapter 18 has 169 words.  Therefore, the total number of words is:  Genesis Chapter 3 - 47 words + Genesis Chapter 35 - 209 words + Genesis Chapter 18 - 169 words = 425 words.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many words are there in each chapter.  According to the question, Chapter 3 has 53 verses, and each verse is approximately 80 characters long, so it contains around 4200 characters (53 x 80). Similarly, Chapter 53 has 75 verses, which contain around 6000 characters (75 x 80). Finally, Chapter 75 has 21 verses, containing around 1700 characters (21 x 80). Therefore, the total number of characters in all three chapters is:  Total Characters = 4200 + 6000 + 1700 = 12900 characters. Now, let's convert this number into words. Since each character represents one word, we can calculate the total number of words in these three chapters as follows:  Total Words = Total Characters / Number of Characters per Word  In Yiddish, each word typically consists of 8-10 letters, so let's assume an average of 9 letters per word. Therefore, the total number of words in these three chapters is:  Total Words = 12900 characters / 9 letters per word = 1433 words. So, according to the question, the longest chapter among Genesis 3, 53, and 75 is Chapter 75 with approximately 1433 words.;
Response:  According to Genesis chapter 31 verses 1-54, Jacob and his family left Laban after 20 years of service. Then they traveled for seven days before arriving at Gilead. After that, they stayed there for three days. So in total, it took them 10 days (7 + 3) from leaving Laban until reaching Gilead.;
"Response:  We know that in Genesis chapter 2 verse 23, it is written ""And Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, and he begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and he called his name Seth."" So if we count from verse 23 to verse 10 of Genesis chapter 5 (which is the last verse before the genealogy starts), there are exactly 77 verses. Therefore, the number of generations between Adam and Noah is 77.";
Response:  We know that there are 81 paragraphs in Genesis chapter 2 and 68 paragraphs in Genesis chapter 6. So, if we want to find out how many paragraphs there are in Deuteronomy chapter 29, we can calculate it as follows: Number of paragraphs in Deuteronomy chapter 29 = Number of paragraphs in Genesis chapter 2 x (Number of verses in Deuteronomy chapter 29 / Number of verses in Genesis chapter 2) = 81 x (30 / 81) = 145 paragraphs Therefore, there are 145 paragraphs in Deuteronomy chapter 29.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 39 can be divided into 62 without leaving any remainder. So we divide 62 by 39 and get a quotient of 1 with a remainder of 23. Therefore, there are 23 groups of 39 that fit exactly in 62.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 61 can be divided into 52 without leaving any remainder. So we divide 61 by 52 and get a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 9. Therefore, there are 9 times that 61 can be divided into 52 without leaving any remainder.;
Response:  We have 15 Kanpeur to spend at the market and we want to buy things for our grandmother. So let's say we spent $10 on something for her. Now we have $5 left. If we go to the bakery, it costs $2 per loaf of bread. How many loaves can we buy with $5? Well, $5 divided by $2 is equal to 2. So we can buy 2 loaves of bread. Now we have $3 left ($5 - $2 x 2). If we go to the butcher shop, a chicken costs $4. How many chickens can we buy with $3? Well, $3 divided by $4 is equal to 0.75. So we can buy half a chicken. Now we have $0.75 left ($3 - $4 x 0.75). If we go to the grocery store, a bag of rice costs $1. How many bags of rice can we buy with $0.75? Well, $0.75 divided by $1 is equal to 0.75. So we can buy one bag of rice. Therefore, in total, we bought 2 loaves of bread, half a chicken, and one bag of rice.;
Response:  We have 7 Kanpe (Kanpye) to make Apremadi and we need to add Maten (Matten). So, if we use all of them, then there will be no remaining Kanpye for other things. Therefore, the total number of Kanpye left after making Apremadi is zero.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 36 goes into 13 and then multiply it with 49. So we do: 36 / 13 = 2.77...times...(we can round this up to 3) 3 x 49 = 147. Therefore, there are 147 times that 36 fits into 13 plus 49.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 44 goes into 100 and then multiply it with 39. So we divide 100 by 44 which gives us 2.35714286... Now let's do the same for 39. We divide 39 by 44 which gives us 0.87259814... Now we add both of these numbers together to get our final answer which is 3.22974160... Therefore, there are 3 times 39 or 117 units in one hundred units of the material being sold at $39 per unit.;
Response:  We have to find out how many people are in each group and then add them up.  In Group A, there are 53 people, so we will subtract that from the total number of people (48 + 49 = 97). Therefore, the answer is 97 - 53 = 44.;
Response:  We have 33 Kanpe (Kanpe is equal to 1/2) and we want to know how many Kanpe are in 34 Kanpe plus 10 Kanpe. So, if we add 10 Kanpe to 34 Kanpe, we will get 44 Kanpe. Therefore, there are 44 Kanpe in total.;
Response:  We have 13 + 59 = 72. Now we subtract 21 from it, so we get 51. Therefore, there are 51 Kanpye Te Ale Rem left in the market after all the sales.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 66 can be divided into 29 and also how many times 26 can be divided into 10. So we will divide both numbers by their respective divisors.  Firstly, let us calculate the divisor of 66 which is 4. Now, if we divide 66 by 4, we get 16 with remainders. Therefore, there are 16 ways in which 66 can be divided into 29. Similarly, if we divide 26 by its divisor 5, we get 5 with remainders. Thus, there are 5 ways in which 26 can be divided into 10.  Now, let us multiply these two values to get the final answer. The product of 16 and 5 is equal to 80. Therefore, the number of ways in which 29 Kanpye can be arranged among 66 Kanpye is 80.;
Response:  We have 41 candies and we want to share them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 10 candies (41/4=10). Now let's say that after sharing the candies, there are 26 left over. That means that each person got 10 candies, so the remaining 26 candies can be divided equally among the 3 people who didn't get any candy at first (26/3=8). Therefore, the final distribution of candies is as follows: 4 people got 10 candies each, and 3 people got 8 candies each.;
Response:  We have to find out how many people can fit in each room and then add them up to get the total number of people who can stay at the hotel.  Room 1 has a capacity of 46 people, so we can fit 46 x 2 = 92 people in two rooms.  Room 2 has a capacity of 43 people, so we can fit 43 x 2 = 86 people in two rooms. Therefore, the total number of people who can stay at the hotel is 92 + 86 = 178 people.;
Response:  We have 4 pomegranates in total (Rachel has 3 and she gives 1 to her friend). If we divide this number by 7, we get 0.57 (or approximately 57%). So, roughly half of the pomegranates are left after Rachel gives one to her friend.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times Rachel can make 4 pomegranate seeds in one day if she has 8 pomegranates and each pomegranate contains 2 seeds. So, we need to divide 8 by 4 to get the number of times Rachel can make 4 pomegranate seeds per day. Therefore, the answer is 2.;
Response:  We have 7 pomegranates and we want to share them equally among 5 people. So each person will get 1 pomegranate. Now, if 3 of those people are children, they won't be able to eat their whole pomegranate, so let's say they can only eat half of it. That means there will be 2 remaining pomegranates for the other 2 adults.;
Response:  We have 7 pomes and we want to know how many pomes will be left if 6 of them are already rotten. So, we need to subtract 6 from 7. Therefore, there will be 1 pom left.;
Response:  We have 6 pomegranates and we want to share them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 1.5 pomegranates (6/4 = 1.5).;
Response:  We have 3 pomegranates and we want to share them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 1/4 of the total number of pomegranates = 3 x 4 = 12 pomegranates. Now let's assume that after sharing these 12 pomegranates, there are still 27 pomegranates left. So, each remaining pomegranate represents 27 / 12 = 2 pomegranates. Therefore, the answer is 2 pomegranates per person.;
Response:  We have 7 pomegranates in total. If we give 2 of them to someone else, then we will have 5 pomegranates left (7 - 2 = 5). Now, if we divide 5 pomegranates among 4 people, each person will get 1 and 1/4 pomegranate (5 / 4 = 1 and 1/4). So, the final answer is 1 and 1/4 pomegranates per person.;
Response:  We have 5 poms in total (Rachel has 2 and she gives 1 to her friend). So we have 5 poms left after giving one away. Now, if we add 3 new poms to the remaining ones, we will have 8 poms in total (including the original 2 that Rachel had). Therefore, the answer is 8.;
Response:  We have 52 cards in a deck (Rachel's generation). To win two games of poker with each card, we need to play 104 games (2 x 52). If we lose every game, there are 104 losses. So, the probability of losing is 1 - (104/106) = 0.9387.;
Response:  We have 8 pomegranate seeds in one bunch and we want to know how many pomegranate seeds there are altogether if we collect 9 bunches of pomegranates. So, let's calculate it as follows: Number of pomegranate seeds in one bunch = 8 seeds Total number of pomegranate seeds = Number of bunches x Number of seeds in each bunch = 9 x 8 = 72 seeds Therefore, there are 72 pomegranate seeds altogether if you collect 9 bunches of pomegranates.;
Response:  We know that Rachel has 7 pomegranates in her basket and she gives one to each of her friends. So, she will have 7 - 1 = 6 pomegranates left after giving them away. Now, we are asked how many pomegranates Rachel will have if she adds the number of pomegranates she already had (which is 7) to the number of pomegranates she will have after giving them away (which is 6). Therefore, the total number of pomegranates Rachel will have is 7 + 6 = 13 pomegranates.;
Response:  We know that Ed has 20 bullets and he gave 5 to Doug. So, Ed has 20 - 5 = 15 bullets left. Now, we are asked how many bullets Doug has after receiving 5 from Ed. Therefore, Doug has 5 + 5 = 10 bullets. Finally, we are asked how many bullets there are in total between both of them. Since Ed has 15 bullets and Doug has 10 bullets, together they have 15 + 10 = 25 bullets.;
Response:  If Ed generates 10 balls per second and he generated 11 balls in total during his leisure time at the beach, then we can calculate how many seconds it took him to generate those 11 balls as follows: Time = Number of Balls / Speed (in this case, number of balls is 11 and speed is 10/second) = 11 / 10 = 1.1 seconds Now, if Ed generates 45 balls while walking for one kilometer, we need to convert the distance from kilometers to meters first. There are 1000 meters in one kilometer, so: Distance = Kilometers x 1000 = 1 x 1000 = 1000 meters Then, we can calculate how long it takes him to walk that distance by dividing the distance by his walking speed: Time = Distance / Speed (in this case, distance is 1000 meters and speed is 45 balls per kilometer) = 1000 / 45 = 22.2 seconds Therefore, based on these calculations, it would take Ed approximately 22.2 seconds to generate 45 balls while walking for one kilometer.;
Response:  If Ed has 6 balls and gives 1 to Doug, then Ed has 5 balls left.  If Doug has 7 balls and gets 2 from Ed, then Doug has 9 balls in total (including the 2 he already had).  So, if Ed has 22 balls, then Doug has 10 balls (including the 2 he already had) after getting 2 from Ed.;
Response:  If Ed has 5 balls and gives 3 to Doug, then Ed has 5 - 3 = 2 balls left.  If Doug has already played with 27 balls, then he still has 27 - 3 = 24 balls left. So, if Ed gives him another ball, Doug will have 24 + 1 = 25 balls in total.;
Response:  We know that Ed traveled 24 boulevards and then turned left to go towards Doug's place. So, he went 9 more boulevards before reaching Doug's place. Therefore, the distance between Ed and Doug is 24 + 9 = 33 boulevards.;
Response:  We know that Ed has 29 balls and he gave 17 of them to his friend Lou at the recreation center. So, how many balls does Ed have left?  Therefore, the answer is 12 (29 - 17 = 12).;
Response:  We know that Ed walked 19 blocks in one direction and then turned around and walked back 8 blocks. So, if we draw a line connecting the two points where Ed started walking (the origin), we can see that he walked a total distance of 19 + 8 = 27 blocks. Therefore, the length of the boulevard is 27 blocks long.;
Response:  We know that Ed walked 21 blocks to reach the recreation center from his house. If he walks at a constant speed of 30 blocks per hour, it will take him 6 hours and 40 minutes (21/30) to walk back home. Therefore, if Ed starts walking at 8 am, he will arrive at his house at 2 pm (8 am + 6 hrs 40 min).;
Response:  If Ed took 20 balls to play with at his leisure, and he has 17 balls in total (including the one given to him by Doug), then he still has 3 balls left over after playing with them all. So, the answer is 3.;
Response:  We have to add 16 elév (408 + 16 = 424) and then divide it by 3 to get the number of portions for each person. So, we will have 142 portions per person (424 / 3).;
Response:  If we have 479 eggs to make 489 sandwiches with bacon and want to add some more bacon for each sandwich, then we need (489 - 479) = 10 additional sandwiches. So, we will need 10 + 479 = 489 eggs in total.;
Response:  We have to find out how many eggs are needed for 310 people to make a cake with a height of 185 cm and add 200 g of bacon on top. To do this, we need to calculate the volume of the cake first. The formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism is: Volume = Length x Width x Height. In this case, the length, width, and height of the cake are given as 185 cm, 90 cm, and 60 cm respectively. Therefore, the volume of the cake is: Volume = 185 x 90 x 60 = 107450 cubic centimeters (cm³). Now, we know that each person will get 1/3 of the total volume of the cake, so to find out how much cake each person will get, we divide the total volume by 3:  Each person gets 107450 / 3 = 35813.33 cm³ of cake. Since there are 310 people in total, the number of eggs needed to make this amount of cake can be calculated as follows: Number of eggs = Total volume of cake / Volume of one egg = 35813.33 cm³ / 100 cm³ = 358 eggs. Finally, since we want to add 200 g of bacon on top of the cake, we need to subtract this weight from the total volume of the cake: New volume of cake after adding bacon = Total volume of cake - Weight of bacon = 35813.33 cm³ - 200 g = 35613.33 cm³. So, the number of eggs needed to make the cake without bacon is 358 eggs.;
Response:  We have to make 288 elephants with specific quality (caliber) of 264 elephants who are already in the area and add some more elephants from other places. To calculate how many elephants we need to add, let's assume that each elephant requires about 10 square meters of space for living. Therefore, if we want to accommodate all these elephants in one place, we will need at least 288 x 10 = 2880 square meters of land. Now, since we don't have enough land available, we can either reduce the size of each elephant or find alternative ways to accommodate them. However, based on the given information, it seems that adding more elephants from other areas is not possible due to lack of space. So, our final answer would be zero (0).;
Response:  We have to find out how many eggs are needed for 10 people to make 20 sandwiches with 4 layers of bacon each. So we need to calculate the number of eggs required per person and then multiply it by 10.  To determine the number of eggs required per person, we can use the following formula: Number of eggs = Total number of sandwiches / Number of layers of bacon in each sandwich x Number of people eating the sandwiches. In this case, we know that there will be 20 sandwiches made with 4 layers of bacon each, so we can plug these values into the formula as follows: Number of eggs = 20 / (4 x 10) = 80 eggs. Therefore, we would need 80 eggs to make 20 sandwiches with 4 layers of bacon each for 10 people.;
Response:  We have to calculate how many pieces of bacon we need for each person in order to add 400 grams of bacon to 166 portions of rice. To do this, we will divide 400 grams by 166 portions. So, we need 2.35 grams of bacon per portion (400 g / 166 portions = 2.35 g/portion). Now, let's assume that one piece of bacon is approximately 10 grams (this is just an estimate and may vary depending on the size and thickness of the bacon). Therefore, to determine the number of pieces of bacon needed, we can multiply the amount of bacon required per portion by the total number of portions: Number of pieces of bacon = Total amount of bacon required / Amount of bacon required per portion = 2.35 g/portion x 166 portions = 379 pieces of bacon (rounded up to the nearest whole number) So, to answer your question, you would need approximately 379 pieces of bacon to add 400 grams of bacon to 166 portions of rice.;
"Response:  If we want to add 324 eggs to make a bigger omelette and add 374 bacon pieces to make it more filling, then we need to adjust the number of cheese cubes accordingly. For example, if we want to add 128 cheese cubes to make the new omelette even more flavorful, we can do so by multiplying the original amount of cheese cubes by 1.5 (since there are now more ingredients). So, the updated list of ingredients for the new omelette would be:

* Eggs: 324 + 128 = 452
* Bacon: 374
* Cheese: 128 x 1.5 = 192

Therefore, the total number of ingredients needed for the new omelette is 452 eggs, 374 bacon pieces, and 192 cheese cubes.";
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many eggs are needed for 257 people to add 120 eggs to make 377 eggs in total. So, we divide 257 by 120 = 2.14 (approximately). Therefore, we need approximately 2 and a fraction of eggs to make 377 eggs. Now, let's calculate how many eggplants are needed for 97 people to add 60 eggplants to make 157 eggplants in total. So, we divide 97 by 60 = 1.61 (approximately). Therefore, we need approximately 1 and a fraction of eggplants to make 157 eggplants. Finally, let's calculate how many tomatoes are needed for 120 people to add 40 tomatoes to make 160 tomatoes in total. So, we divide 120 by 40 = 3 (approximately). Therefore, we need approximately 3 tomatoes to make 160 tomatoes.;
Response:  If we have 144 eggs to make 467 bacon sandwiches and each sandwich requires 3 eggs, then we need 467 / 3 = 155 eggs for making bacon sandwiches. Now, if we add 155 eggs to the initial amount of 144 eggs, we get a total of 299 eggs.;
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many eggs are needed for each dish separately. For example, if we want to make 4 servings of egg salad with 6 eggs per serving, then we need 24 eggs in total (4 x 6 = 24). Now let's consider the other ingredients. If we want to add 100g of bacon to each dish, and there are 337g of bacon in one package, then we will use half of that amount (168g) for all three dishes (337 / 2 = 168). Similarly, if we want to add 150g of cheese to each dish, and there are 228g of cheese in one package, then we will use two-thirds of that amount (150g / 3 = 50g) for all three dishes (228 / 3 = 76g). Finally, if we want to add 100g of ham to each dish, and there are 337g of ham in one package, then we will use half of that amount (168g) for all three dishes (337 / 2 = 168). Therefore, the total amount of each ingredient needed is as follows: Eggs - 24; Bacon - 168g; Cheese - 50g; Ham - 168g. So, to summarize, you will need 24 eggs, 168g of bacon, 50g of cheese, and 168g of ham to prepare these three dishes.";
Response:  We have to calculate how much of each ingredient is needed for a total of 66 portions. If we want to add some peas and carrots to make it more specific, we need 120 grams of vegetables in total (450 + 38 = 120). For the bacon, if we want to add 38 grams, then we will use 76 grams of bacon (450 - 38 = 76). So, the final amount of each ingredient needed would be: Vegetables: 120 grams Bacon: 76 grams;
Response:  If we have 218 eggs to make 351 bacon sandwiches, and each sandwich requires 2 eggs, then we will need 634 eggs in total (218 x 3 = 634).;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of calories in each ingredient.  Bacon has approximately 354 calories per 100 grams, and potatoes have around 114 calories per 100 grams. So if we take 269 grams of bacon, it will give us approximately 89,610 calories (354 x 269 = 91,610). If we take 330 grams of potatoes, it will give us approximately 39,970 calories (114 x 330 = 39,970). Now let's add these two values together to get the total number of calories in both ingredients: 89,610 + 39,970 = 129,580 calories. Finally, if we divide this value by 76 (the number of people), we get approximately 1,697 calories per person (129,580 / 76 = 1,697). Therefore, if you make 76 portions of the dish with the given ingredients, each portion will contain approximately 1,697 calories.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many students are in each class. From the information given, there are 569 students in total and they are divided into 23 classes. Therefore, the number of students in each class is: 569 / 23 = 24. So, there are 24 students in each class.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many students are in grade 3 and then multiply it with 841 to get the total number of students who will be promoted to high school next year. So, the calculation is as follows: Number of students in Grade 3 = 34 x 9 = 296 Students Promoted to High School Next Year = 296 x 841 = 240,567 Therefore, there will be approximately 240,567 students who will be promoted to high school next year based on the given information.;
Response:  We have to find out how many students are in each class and then add them up. So we need to know the number of classes offered at this school. According to the question, there are 485 eleventh-grade students, and they take 232 courses. That means that each student takes an average of 2.06 courses (485/232). Now let's calculate the total number of courses taken by all students. To do this, we multiply the number of students per class by the number of classes available. In other words, if one class has 20 students, then the total number of students taking that course is 20 x 4 = 80. Similarly, if two classes have 15 students each, then the total number of students taking those two classes is 15 + 15 = 30. Therefore, the total number of courses taken by all students is equal to the product of the number of students per class and the number of classes available. Using the values given above, we get: Total no. of courses = Number of students per class x Number of classes available = 2.06 x 485 = 976. So there are approximately 976 courses offered at this school.;
Response:  If there are 697 students in the school and each student has 228 friends, then the total number of friendships is: 697 x 228 = 154,304.;
Response:  If there are 635 students in total and each class has an average of 51 students per teacher, then we can calculate how many classes there will be as follows:  Number of classes = Total number of students / Average number of students per class  Number of classes = 635 students x (51 students/teacher) = 124 classes So, there will be 124 classes at this school if there are 635 students in total and each class has an average of 51 students per teacher.;
Response:  If there are 868 students in the school and each class has 30 students, then we have: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 868 / 30 = 28 Students in each class So, there are 28 classes in the school.;
Response:  If there are 700 students in a school and each student has 142 friends on average, then the total number of friends for all 700 students is: 700 x 142 = 98,400.;
Response:  We have to find out how many students are in each class and then add them up. So we need to know the number of classes for each grade level.  For Grade 7, there are 3 classes with 25 students in each class. For Grade 8, there are 4 classes with 29 students in each class. For Grade 9, there are 5 classes with 32 students in each class. Finally, for Grade 10, there are 6 classes with 35 students in each class. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is: 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.;
Response:  We have to find out how many students are in each class and then calculate the total number of students in all classes.  So we need to know the number of classes (902) and the number of students per class (811). Then we can multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of students in all classes:  Total Number of Students = Number of Classes x Number of Students per Class  Therefore, there are approximately 73,562 students in this school (73,562 = 902 x 811).;
Response:  We have 632 students in class 6A and 410 students in class 4A. So, we need to find out how many students are in both classes together. To do this, we multiply the number of students in each class: 632 x 410 = 267,800. Therefore, there are approximately 267,800 students in both classes combined.;
Response:  We have 732 students in class 7 and 761 students in class 8. There are also 682 students who will be promoted to high school next year. So, we need to find out how many students will remain in elementary school next year. To do this, we subtract the number of students who will be promoted from the total number of students in both classes: 732 - 682 = 50. Therefore, there will be 50 students remaining in elementary school next year.;
Response:  We have 135 students in class 1 and 214 students in class 2. Therefore, we have a total of 349 students (135 + 214). Now, let's calculate how many students are in each grade level. For class 1, there are 496 students, and for class 2, there are 910 students. So, the number of students in each grade level is 496/2 = 248 in class 1 and 910/2 = 455 in class 2.;
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the number of students in each class from grade 3 to grade 8.  For example, there are 24 students in Grade 3 Class A and B, respectively; 27 students in Grade 4 Class A and B, respectively; 30 students in Grade 5 Class A and B, respectively; 33 students in Grade 6 Class A and B, respectively; 36 students in Grade 7 Class A and B, respectively; and 39 students in Grade 8 Class A and B, respectively. Therefore, the total number of students in all classes is: 24 + 27 + 30 + 33 + 36 + 39 = 200.";
Response:  We know that there are 315 students in class 309 who have gone to school today. If we multiply this number by 7 (which is the number of days in a week), we get 2,205. However, if we subtract the number of absent students (772) from this total, we get 1,433 as the number of present students at the school today.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many students are in each class. From the given information, there are four classes with different numbers of students as follows: Class 1 has 45 students, Class 2 has 68 students, Class 3 has 73 students, and Class 4 has 92 students. Therefore, the total number of students in all four classes is: 45 + 68 + 73 + 92 = 368 students.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many students are in each class. From the information given, there are four classes with different numbers of students as follows: Class 1 has 30 students, Class 2 has 45 students, Class 3 has 57 students, and Class 4 has 69 students. Therefore, the total number of students in all four classes is: 30 + 45 + 57 + 69 = 221 students.;
Response:  We have 362 students in class 3A and 257 students in class 3B. If we want to distribute them evenly among 403 desks in the school cafeteria, each student will sit at an average of 1.98 desks (362/3A + 257/3B = 403).;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much money Edward has spent on his trip so far. According to the question, he has spent $18 on transportation and $16 on accommodation. Therefore, the total amount of money he has spent is $18 + $16 = $34.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $ 13 to spend at the store. He can buy 3 items with this amount. So, he will have $ 13 / 3 = $ 4.33 left after buying all three items.;
Response:  We know that Edward spent $ 9 first and then he spent $ 8 more. So, in total, Edward spent $ 9 + $ 8 = $ 17.;
Response:  We know that Edward bought 92 pounds of coffee at $ 16 per pound. So he spent $ 16 x 92 = $ 1456 on coffee. Now we are asked how much money Edward has left after buying coffee. To find this out, we need to subtract the amount he spent on coffee from his initial amount of money. So, $ 1456 - $ 6 = $ 1450. Therefore, Edward has $ 1450 left after buying coffee.;
Response:  We know that Edward bought 2 live crabs for $6. If he paid $12 for all of them, then we can calculate the price per live crab as follows: Price per live crab = Total cost / Number of live crabs = $12 / 2 = $6 per live crab.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward bought 6 pounds of beef for $16 and he got $19 back from selling it. So, we can write this as follows: 6 lb x $16 = $96  $96 - $19 = $77 Now, we need to find out how much money Edward made per pound of beef. To do this, we divide the amount of money he made ($77) by the weight of the beef (6 pounds): $77 / 6 lb = $12.83 Therefore, Edward made $12.83 per pound of beef.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward bought 4 dollars worth of beef and paid 3 dollars for it. So, he spent a total amount of 7 dollars (4 x 3 = 12). Therefore, Edward spent $7 to buy the beef.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward bought 16 pounds of beef for $8 per pound, so he spent a total of $128 on beef (16 x $8 = $128). Now, let's find out how much he saved by buying both beef and chicken together. The cost of 1 pound of chicken is $4, so Edward paid a total of $32 for 8 pounds of chicken ($4 x 8 = $32). Therefore, his total savings can be calculated as follows: Total Savings = Cost of Beef + Cost of Chicken - Total Amount Spent = $128 + $32 - $128 = $0. So, Edward did not save any money by buying both beef and chicken together.;
Response:  We know that Edward has $ 17 and he gives $ 10 to his friend. So, now Edward has $ 7 left with him.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups in one class and David did 58 push-ups in another class. So, we can say that Zachary did x push-ups more than David. Now, let's find out how many push-ups Zachary did. Since he did 44 push-ups in one class, his average number of push-ups per class is:  Number of classes = Total number of push-ups / Average number of push-ups per class = 44 / 2 = 22 classes. Therefore, Zachary did 22 + x = 76 push-ups in all the classes together (including both classes). So, the difference between the number of push-ups done by Zachary and David is: Difference = Zachary's total number of push-ups - David's total number of push-ups = 76 - 58 = 18 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we can subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did: 51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.;
Response:  We know that David did 44 push-ups in one class with Jim. Then we are told that he did 9 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did 44 + 9 = 53 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary did 53 - 9 = 44 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that David did 51 push-ups in class and Zachary did 49 push-ups. So, we need to find out how many push-ups David did more than Zachary. To do this, we subtract the number of push-ups Zachary did from the number of push-ups David did: 51 - 49 = 2. Therefore, David did 2 more push-ups than Zachary.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches in total.  David did 19 push-ups and 27 crunches. To find out how many push-ups David did relative to Zachary, we can divide David's number of push-ups by Zachary's number of push-ups:  David did 19 / 59 = 0.32 push-ups per Zachary push-up. Similarly, we can calculate David's number of crunches relative to Zachary's number of crunches:  David did 27 / 44 = 0.63 crunches per Zachary crunch. So, David did 0.32 push-ups and 0.63 crunches for every one push-up and crunch done by Zachary.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches in one class session.  David did 29 push-ups and 13 crunches more than Zachary. So, we can say that David did 44 + 13 = 57 push-ups and 17 + 13 = 30 crunches. Therefore, David did 57 push-ups and 30 crunches more than Zachary.;
Response:  We know that David did 17 push-ups and 10 crunches more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups and y crunches, then David did (x + 10) push-ups and (y - 10) crunches. Now we can substitute the values given in the question: x = 53, y = 14. Therefore, David did 63 push-ups (53 + 10) and 24 crunches (14 - 10).;
Response:  We know that David did 58 push-ups and 87 crunches, which means he completed 145 exercises in total (58 x 2 = 116 push-ups + 87 x 2 = 174 crunches). Now, we need to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David. So, let's subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did: 116 - 58 = 58. Therefore, Zachary did 58 more push-ups than David.;
Response:  We know that David did 38 push-ups and 62 crunches, which means he scored 100 points for push-ups and 100 points for crunches (since each crunch is worth one point). Now, we need to find out how many points Zachary got for his push-ups and crunches. Since Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches, he scored 94 points for push-ups and 94 points for crunches. So, if we subtract the number of points Zachary scored from the total number of points David scored, we get: 100 - 94 = 6 points. Therefore, Zachary scored 6 more points than David in this exercise.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 push-ups in class, and David did 39 more than Zachary. So, David did 58 push-ups (39 + 19). Now, we are told that John did 13 fewer push-ups than David. Therefore, the number of push-ups David did is equal to the number of push-ups John did minus 13, which is 46 push-ups (58 - 13).;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups in class, and David did 22 more than him. So, David did 73 push-ups (51 + 22). Now we are told that John did 4 fewer push-ups than David. Therefore, John did 69 push-ups (73 - 4).;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups in class, and David did 39 more than Zachary. So, David did 39 + 15 = 54 push-ups. Now we are asked how many push-ups Zachary did more than John did. Since John did 9 push-ups less than David, Zachary did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups more than John.;
Response:  If David can do 30 push-ups in one minute and Zachary can do 45 push-ups in one minute, then we know that David is doing half of what Zachary does. So if David did 30 push-ups in one minute, it means he could have done 60 push-ups in two minutes (since he is doing half of what Zachary does). Now let's calculate how many push-ups David would be able to do if he were to keep up with Zachary for three minutes:  In three minutes, David would be able to do 60 x 3 = 180 push-ups. Therefore, if David did 37 push-ups in one minute, it means he could have done 180 / 3 = 60 push-ups in three minutes.;
Response:  If David did 56 push-ups and Zachary did 38 push-ups before him, then we can say that David did x more push-ups than Zachary. Since David did 28 more push-ups than Zachary (56 - 38 = 18), so David did 18 more push-ups than Zachary.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches in one class session.  If we assume that David can do 40 push-ups in one session as well, then he would have done 40 x 1 = 40 push-ups in that same session. However, since David is older than Zachary, it may take him longer to complete each exercise. So let's assume that David takes twice as long as Zachary to finish each push-up (i.e., David does half as many push-ups per minute). Therefore, if David took 2 minutes to do 40 push-ups, he would have completed 40 / 2 = 20 push-ups in that same session. Now, let's calculate how many crunches David could have done based on his age difference with Zachary. Since David is 17 years old than Zachary, he would be able to do 62 / 17 = 3.6 crunches for every crunch Zachary does. So if Zachary did 62 crunches in one session, David would have done 62 x 3.6 = 228 crunches in that same session.;
Response:  We know that David did 36 push-ups and 33 crunches in 3 minutes.  Now we are asked how many push-ups and crunches Zachary can do in 3 minutes if he does 58 push-ups and 33 crunches in one minute. So, to find out how many push-ups and crunches Zachary can do in 3 minutes, we need to multiply the number of push-ups and crunches he can do in one minute by 3. Therefore, Zachary can do 174 push-ups (58 x 3) and 99 crunches (33 x 3).;
Response:  We know that David did 27 push-ups and 7 minutes of crunches.  If we convert the time to seconds, then David spent 7 x 60 = 420 seconds doing crunches.  Now, let's find out how many push-ups Zachary did in relation to the time he spent doing crunches.  Since Zachary did 5 push-ups in 17 seconds (or 1 minute and 7 seconds), we can calculate his rate per minute as follows:  Push-ups/Minute = Total Time Spent Doing Push-ups / Time Spent Doing Crunches  In this case, Zachary's rate per minute is:  Push-ups/Minute = 5/17 = 0.294 (approximately) So, if Zachary spent 420 seconds doing crunches, then he did approximately 0.294 x 420 = 118 push-ups. Therefore, the answer to the question is:  David te fè 27 plis push-ups men 7 mwens crunches pase Zachary nan clas jimnastik jodi a. si Zachary te fè 5 push-ups ak 17 crunches konbyen plis crunches pase push-ups Zachary te fè 118 push-ups.;

Response:  We have to complete 2 pages of math problems in 10 minutes and we have to read 10 pages of biology in 1 hour. So, we can calculate the time taken for each page as follows: Time taken for completing 1 page of math = (Time available for math / Number of pages) = (10 min / 2 pages) = 5 minutes per page. Similarly, time taken for reading 1 page of biology = (Time available for biology / Number of pages) = (60 min / 10 pages) = 6 minutes per page. Now, let's find out how much time is left after completing both tasks: Total time left = Time taken for math + Time taken for biology - Time taken for completing both tasks = 5 min/page x 2 pages = 10 min + 6 min/page x 8 pages = 48 min - 5 min = 43 min. Therefore, the student has 43 minutes remaining after completing both tasks.;
Response:  We have to complete 9 pages of mathematics and read 96 pages of biology. So, we need to find out how many pages we can complete in one day. Let's assume that Rachel can complete half of the pages in one day, so she can complete 4.5 pages of mathematics and 48 pages of biology. Therefore, the number of days it will take her to finish both subjects is: Number of days = Total pages / Half pages per day = 9 pages (mathematics) + 96 pages (biology) / 0.5 pages per day = 19 days;
Response:  We have to complete 11 pages of mathematics and read 3 books of biology in 3 months. So we need to calculate how many days are left for completing each task. Days left for completing mathematics = 90 days (3 months x 30 days per month) Days left for reading biology = 60 days (3 months x 20 days per month) Now let's find out how much time we can spend on each subject daily. Time spent on mathematics = Total days left / Number of pages to be completed Daily time spent on mathematics = 90 days / 11 pages = 8.18 hours per day Time spent on biology = Total days left / Number of books to be read Daily time spent on biology = 60 days / 3 books = 20 hours per day Therefore, we will spend approximately 8.18 hours per day on mathematics and 20 hours per day on biology.;
Response:  We have to complete 7 pages of mathematics and read 8 lots of biology books. So we need to find out how many pages are in each book.  Mathematics: Each page has 4 questions, so there are 4 x 7 = 28 questions in total. Biology: Each book has 30 pages, so there are 30 x 8 = 240 pages in total. Therefore, we need to spend 28 + 240 = 268 hours studying.;
Response:  We have to complete 9 pages of mathematics and read 29 pages of biology. So we need to find out how many days it will take us to finish both tasks. Let's assume that each page takes approximately 30 minutes to read or complete. Therefore, the total time required to complete all 9 pages of mathematics is: Time = Number of pages x Time per page = 9 x 30 = 270 minutes. Similarly, the total time required to read all 29 pages of biology is: Time = Number of pages x Time per page = 29 x 30 = 870 minutes. Now, let's calculate the difference between these two times: Difference = Total time for math - Total time for biology = 270 - 870 = -600 minutes. This means that if we start reading biology at the same time as when we started doing mathematics, we will be able to finish reading biology in half the time it took us to do mathematics.;
Response:  We have to complete 8 pages of mathematics and read 3 lots of biology books. So we need to find out how many hours it takes to finish each page of mathematics and each book of biology.  Let's assume that reading a page of mathematics takes 1 hour and reading a book of biology takes 2 hours. Therefore, if we want to finish 8 pages of mathematics in total, it will take us 8 x 1 = 8 hours. Similarly, if we want to finish 3 lots of biology books in total, it will take us 3 x 2 = 6 hours. So, in total, it will take us 8 + 6 = 14 hours to complete both tasks.;

Response:  We have to calculate how many cups of coffee Grenn can drink in one day based on his weight and activity level.  Firstly, we need to determine Grenn's body weight in kilograms. According to the question, Grenn weighs 70 kg. Next, we need to convert this weight into pounds. There are approximately 2.2 pounds in one kilogram, so Grenn weighs 154 pounds (70 kg x 2.2 lb/kg). Now, let's find out how much caffeine is present in each cup of coffee. The amount of caffeine in a typical cup of coffee varies depending on several factors such as the type of coffee beans used, brewing method, and serving size. However, on average, a standard 8-ounce cup of coffee contains about 95 milligrams of caffeine. Since Grenn wants to drink 35 cups of coffee per day, he will consume a total of 35 x 95 mg = 3275 milligrams of caffeine daily. To calculate the number of cups of coffee that Grenn can safely drink based on his weight and activity level, we can use the following formula: Safe Caffeine Limit = Body Weight (in kg) x Activity Level Factor x Tolerance Threshold (mg/kg/day) Based on various sources, the safe caffeine limit for adults ranges from 200 to 400 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day. For moderately active individuals like Grenn, the activity level factor is typically set at 1.6. Therefore, Grenn's tolerance threshold would be: Safe Caffeine Limit = 70 kg x 1.6 x 200 - 400 mg/kg/day = 11,200 - 2800 mg/day This means that Grenn can safely consume up to 11,200 - 2800 mg = 8400 milligrams of caffeine per day. Given that he consumes 35 cups of coffee per day, each containing approximately 95 mg of caffeine,;

There are 9 big apples and 3 small ones, so there are altogether 9 + 3 = 12 apples. Now, let's divide them into three groups of 10 each: Group 1 (big apples): 12 / 3 = 4; Group 2 (small apples): 12 - 4 = 8; Group 3 (apples left over after dividing): 0. Therefore, the number of apples Konbyen has is 4 + 8 + 0 = 12.";
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are in the basket and then divide them into two groups of equal size. So we can say that there are 14 apples in one group and 16 apples in another group. Now let's calculate the average number of apples in each group. For the first group, we have 14 apples, so the average is 14/1 = 14. For the second group, we have 16 apples, so the average is 16/2 = 8. Finally, we multiply the average number of apples in each group by the total number of apples (37) to get the total number of apples in both groups combined: 14 x 37 + 8 x 37 = 509. Therefore, the answer is 509 apples.;

Response:  We have 11 cups of flour and we need to make 7 cups of dough. So, we will use 4 cups of flour for the dough (since 7 / 11 = 0.636). Now, if we add 2 cups of flour more than what is needed for the dough, it means that we will have 6 cups of extra flour left over after making the dough (2 cups / 0.636 = 3.15). Therefore, there will be 3 cups of flour left over after making the dough (6 - 4 = 3).;
Response:  We have to add 6 more bags of flour to the 3 bags that are already there. So, we will need a total of 9 bags of flour (6 + 3).;
Response:  We have 12 cups of flour and we want to make 5 cups of dough. So far, so good! But then comes the tricky part - we already mixed 3 cups of flour into the dough. That means we only have 9 cups of flour left (12 - 3 = 9). Now, if we add another 2 cups of flour to the remaining dough, we will end up with 7 cups of dough (9 - 2 = 7). So, the final amount of dough we will get is 7 cups.;
Response:  We have to add 9 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. So we need to find out how much more than 3 cups of flour is needed.  Since 3 cups of flour are already added, we subtract that amount from the total amount needed (9 - 3 = 6). Therefore, the remaining amount of flour needed is 6 cups.;
Response:  We have to add 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar to make 30 cups in total. So far, Mary has added 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar, which means she still needs to add 16 cups (30 - 10 = 20) more. Therefore, the amount of sugar that Mary will add is 16 cups.;
Response:  We have to add 11 tablespoons of flour that Mary has already added and then calculate how much is left for her to add. So, we can say that after adding 11 tablespoons of flour, there are 5 tablespoons of flour remaining (since she had 12 tablespoons in total). Now, let's calculate how many tablespoons of flour she needs to add more:  To find out how many tablespoons of flour she needs to add, we need to subtract the number of tablespoons she has already added from the total amount needed (50 tablespoons - 11 tablespoons = 39 tablespoons). Therefore, Mary needs to add 39 tablespoons of flour more.;
Response:  We have to make 10 batches of dough with 2 cups of flour and 80 cups of water. So we need to start with 7 cups of flour (which is what Mary has already added). To find out how much more flour we need, we can subtract the amount that Mary has already added from the total amount needed for all 10 batches: 7 cups - 7 = 3 cups. Therefore, we need an additional 3 cups of flour to complete the task.;
Response:  We have to make 12 batches of dough with 14 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. So we already used 2 cups of flour. To calculate how much more flour we need, we can subtract the amount we already used from the total amount needed for all batches: 14 - 2 = 12 cups of flour left to use.;

Response:  We have to make 9 portions of rice and 7 portions of flour. So we need a total of 16 portions (9 + 7). But we already made 2 portions of flour, so we still need 14 more portions (16 - 2 = 14). Now let's calculate how much each portion will be: Portion size = Total amount / Number of portions = 14 / 14 = 1 cup Each portion will be 1 cup of rice and 1/2 cup of flour.;
Response:  We have to make 11 batches of 6 cups of flour and 9 batches of 6 cups of semolina. So we will need a total of 120 cups (11 x 6 + 9 x 6) of ingredients in total. Since Mary has already mixed 12 cups of flour, she still needs 108 more cups (120 - 12 = 108) of ingredients to complete all the batches.;
Response:  We have to make 7 batches of 10 bags of flour each and we already made 4 batches of 10 bags of flour each. So, if we want to calculate how many more bags of flour we need to make, we can subtract the number of bags we already made from the total number of bags needed for all the batches: 7 - 4 = 3. Therefore, we need to make 3 additional batches of 10 bags of flour each.;
Response:  We have to make 12 batches of cat food with 14 cups of flour and we already used 10 cups of flour last time. So, if we want to make another batch, we will need 4 more cups of flour (14 - 10 = 4).;
Response:  If season F has 3 months and each month has 3 weeks, then there are 3 x 3 = 9 weeks in Season F.  Now, if 60 families migrate from Season A to Season B during this time period, that means they will be leaving Season F for good. So, the number of families remaining in Season F at the end of the time period (Season C) would be 9 - 60 = -51 families.;

Response:  We have 521 creole words and we want to find out how many of them are used in sentences with at least one loanword from another language.  First, let's count the number of loanwords in each sentence:  If a sentence contains only Creole words, there is no loanword, so the count is 0.  If a sentence contains one loanword, the count is 1.  If a sentence contains two or more loanwords, the count is 2, 3,..., respectively.  Therefore, the total number of loanwords in all sentences is:  Now, let's calculate the proportion of sentences that contain at least one loanword:  To do this, divide the number of loanwords (154) by the total number of sentences (66):  So, approximately 23% of the sentences in the corpus contain at least one loanword from another language.;
Response:  We have 531 creatures and we want to divide them into groups of 38 so that each group has at least one leader. To do this, we can use division with remainders. So, we divide 531 by 38 and get a remainder of 20 (531 / 38 = 14 with a remainder of 20). Therefore, we need to create 14 groups of 38 creatures each, leaving 20 creatures as a remainder.;
Response:  We have 601 creatures and we want to divide them equally among 406 radios. So, each radio will receive 1.5 creatures (601 / 406 = 1.5). Now, let's calculate how many creatures each radio can hold. If each radio can hold 336 creatures (as stated in the problem), then we can see that each radio has room for 2.27 creatures more than what it received (336 - 1.5 = 2.27).;

Response:  We have 99 tikuli of chocolate and we want to know how many pieces of chocolate can be made with that amount.  Firstly, let's convert the amount of chocolate from tikuli to kilograms. There are 10 tikuli in one kilogram, so... (calculate)...we have 990 grams of chocolate. Now, let's divide this amount by the weight of each piece of chocolate to find out how many pieces we can make. The weight of each piece of chocolate is approximately 30 grams, so... (calculate)...we can make 327 pieces of chocolate with the given amount.;
"Response:  We have:
Dan = 3 (gen)
Dola = 10 (li)
Ti = 2 (chokola)
Pou = $4 (kante)
Kote = 5 (menm)
Kantite = 10 (lajan)
An = 3 (chak)
Youn = 4 (kouté)
So, we can calculate as follows:
Chak Ti Boul = Chak Youn Kote x An + Kantite Lajan / Pou
= 3 x 4 + 10 / $4
= 12 + 2.5
= 14.5
Therefore, the price of one box of chocolates is approximately $14.50.";
Response:  We know that Dan bought 2 dolas of chocolate for $6. So, he paid $3 per dollar. Therefore, if he buys one dollar of chocolate, he will pay $3.;
Response:  We have to buy a bat...;
Response:  If we buy one chocolate for $7 and another chocolate for $6, then in total we will spend $13 (7 + 6). So, if we want to know how much money we will save buying both chocolates together, we can subtract $13 from $13, which gives us $0. Therefore, we will not save any money by buying both chocolates together.;
Response:  We have to buy two sticks of chocolate for $6 and one stick of chocolate for $3. So in total we will spend $9 (6 + 3).;
Response:  We have 100 g of chocolate that we want to share equally among 4 people. So each person will get 25g of chocolate (100/4 = 25). Now, let's say we also want to give an extra piece of chocolate to each person, so they will get 26g in total (25 + 1 = 26). Therefore, the answer is 26 g.;
Response:  We have 100 g of cocoa powder that costs 8 dollars per kilogram. So, to find out how much it costs in total, we need to divide the weight in kilograms by the price in dollars and multiply by 100. Therefore, the cost of 100g of cocoa powder is $8/kg x 0.1 kg = $0.80.;
Response:  If we have 3 dolas and we buy 1 bat (which costs 2 dolas), then we will have 3 - 2 = 1 dola left. Now if we have 4 dolas in total and we spend 1 dola to buy something else, then we will have 4 - 1 = 3 dolas left. So the final amount of money that we will have after buying everything is 3 dolas.;
Response:  We have to buy 10 bars of chocolate for a total cost of $ 30. If each bar costs $ 3, then we can calculate the number of bars as follows: Number of bars = Total cost / Cost per bar = $ 30 / $ 3 = 10 bars So, we will buy 10 bars of chocolate.;
Response:  We have to buy 2 bars of chocolate for a total cost of $ 4. If each bar costs $ 2, then we will spend $ 2 x 2 = $ 4 on two bars. So, the price per bar is $ 4 / 2 = $ 2 per bar.;
Response:  If you buy one chocolate for $3 and another chocolate for $7, then in total you will spend $10 ( $3 + $7). So to find out how many chocolates you can buy with $10, we divide $10 by $3, which gives us 3 chocolates. Therefore, you can buy 3 chocolates with $10.;
Response:  If we buy one box of chocolate for $7 and another box of chocolate for $2, then in total we will spend $9 ( $7 + $2). So, to find out how many boxes of chocolate we can buy with $10, we need to divide $10 by $9, which gives us 1.11 boxes of chocolate. Therefore, we can buy approximately 1.11 boxes of chocolate with $10.;
Response:  We have 115 lives and we want to know how many will be left after 78 years. So, if someone is born today and lives for 78 years, they will die at what age?  Therefore, the number of lives left after 78 years would be: 115 - 78 = 37;
Response:  We have to find out how many years it would take for $105 to become $137 at an interest rate of 8% per year.  So we can use the formula: FV = PV x (1 + r)^n, where FV is the future value and PV is the present value or principal amount which in this case is $105. Now n represents the number of years that pass before the money grows. In this case, n=8 since we want to know how long it takes for the money to grow from $105 to $137 at an interest rate of 8%. Plugging in these values into the formula above gives us :FV = $105 x (1 + 0.08)^8 = $136.94. Therefore, it will take approximately 8 years for $105 to become $137 at an interest rate of 8% per year.;
"Response:  We have:
Pòl = 108 (from the question)

Vann = 7 (from the question)
Kèk = 3 (from the question)
Garaj = 35 (from the question)
Zanmi = 62 (from the question)
Rete = 10 (from the question)
Now we can calculate:
Pòl x Liv = 108 x 4 = 432
Vann x Kèk = 7 x 3 = 21
Garaj x Zanmi = 35 x 62 = 2260
So the total value of the items in the warehouse is:

Therefore, the value of the items in the warehouse is 2513 liv.";
Response:  We know that Paul has 50 lives and he spends 151 kites in the game. So, we can calculate how many times he will be able to play the game as follows: Number of games = Total number of kites / Number of lives = 151 / 50 = 3.02 games. Therefore, Paul will be able to play the game approximately 3.02 times with his current set of lives.;
Response:  We are given that Paul has $200 to spend at the store and he wants to buy 58 items worth $150 each. So, in total, Paul will spend:  $200 x 58 = $11,600.;
Response:  We have 21 old cars that Pol wants to sell for $42 each. If he sells them at a discount of 15%, then the new price will be:  $42 x (1 - 0.15) = $36. So, Pol can sell 42 new cars for $36 each and make a profit of $42 - $36 = $6 per car.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how much money Pol has in his wallet before he bought the new shirt. According to the question, Pol had 71 euros in his wallet initially. Then, he spent 38 euros on the new shirt. So, now Pol has 71 - 38 = 33 euros left in his wallet. Finally, if he spends another 116 euros on something else, he will be left with nothing.;
Response:  We have 108 lives and we want to know how many lives are in the garage. The question says that there are 55 plants inside the garage. So, if each plant has 3 lives (as stated in the question), then we can calculate the total number of lives in the garage as follows: Number of lives in the garage = Total number of plants x Number of lives per plant = 55 x 3 = 165 lives. Therefore, there are 165 lives in the garage.;
Response:  We have 51 lives in one place and 106 pieces of food there too. If we take 1 piece of food for every 3 lives, how many pieces of food will we get? So, if we take 1/3 of the total number of lives (51 x 3 = 153), then we will have 153 + 106 = 259 pieces of food in total. Now, let's calculate how much food is left after taking out 82 pieces. So, the remaining amount of food is 259 - 82 = 177 pieces of food.;
Response:  We are given that there are 27 lives in the warehouse and we need to find out how many lives will be left if 136 people come to buy them. So, let X represent the number of lives left after the purchase. According to the problem statement, the total number of lives in the warehouse is 27, so we can write the equation as follows: X + 27 = 136 Now, we need to solve for X. To do this, we can subtract 27 from both sides of the equation: X = 119 Therefore, there will be 119 lives left in the warehouse after 136 people come to buy them.;
"Response:  We have:
Pòl = 134 (from the question)
Liv = 39 (from the question)
Vann = 68 (from the question)
Kèk =? (we want to find out)
Garaj =? (we don't know yet)
We are asked to find Kèk, which means ""how many"" in Haitian Creole. So we need to divide Pòl by Liv to get an estimate of how many groups of 39 people can fit in the remaining space (68 - 39 = 29). Therefore, the answer is:
Kèk = Pòl / Liv = 134 / 39 = approximately 3.5 groups of 39 people can fit in the remaining space.";
Response:  We have 95 piles of sand and each pile has 153 grains of sand in it. So, we have a total number of grains of sand equal to 95 x 153 = 14,675 grains of sand. Now, we are asked how many grains of sand are left after taking away 13 grains from one of the piles. Therefore, the number of grains of sand left is equal to 14,675 - 13 = 14,662 grains of sand.;
Response:  We have 42 piles of sand with 143 lives each, for a total of 5860 lives (42 x 143 = 5860). Now we need to find out how many lives are in the remaining 113 piles that are not in the garage. So let's subtract the number of lives in the garage from the total number of lives: 5860 - 113 = 5747 lives outside the garage.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in 10 months. There are 30 days in each month, so the total number of days in 10 months is: 30 x 10 = 300 days. Now, let's calculate the number of years that have passed since Jessica was born. According to the information given in the question, Jessica was born when Jaden was 8 years old. So, the difference between their ages now and when Jaden was 8 years old is: 25 - 8 = 17 years. Therefore, the answer is: 300 days + 17 years = 317 years.;
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between January 1st and February 14th. We can do this by subtracting the two dates:
January 1st - February 14th = 54 days
Now, let's calculate how many roses Jessica has given to Jaden in total:
16 lots of roses x 54 days = 872 roses
Finally, let's divide the number of roses by the number of days to get the average number of roses per day:
872 roses / 54 days = 16.3 roses per day
Therefore, the answer is 16.3 roses per day.";
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the number of days in each month. For example, January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29 days (depending on whether it is a leap year), March has 31 days, and so on until December which has 31 days again. Therefore, the total number of days in one year is equal to the sum of all these numbers: 31 + 28/29 + 31 +... + 31 = 365 days. Now, let's count how many times ""Jessica"" appears in the text:  In the first sentence, ""Jessica"" appears once. In the second sentence, ""Jessica"" appears twice. In the third sentence, ""Jessica"" appears three times. And so on until the last sentence where ""Jessica"" appears four times. So, the total number of appearances of ""Jessica"" in the text is 1 + 2 + 3 +... + 4 = 16. Finally, we can divide the total number of days in a year by the number of appearances of ""Jessica"" to get our answer: 16 / 1 = 16 years.";
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many days are there between Jessica and Jaden. As per the question, Jessica is 33 years old and Jaden is 17 years old, so the difference in their ages is 16 years (33 - 17 = 16). Now, if we assume that one year is equal to 12 months, then we can convert the age difference into months as follows: 16 years x 12 months/year = 192 months (approximately) Therefore, there are approximately 192 months or 16 years and 4 months between Jessica and Jaden.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of roses in Jaden's garden which is given as 34 roses. Now, we are asked how many roses Jessica can buy with $100. So, we need to divide the cost of $100 by the price of each rose, which is given as $3 per rose. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica can buy with $100 is:  $100 / $3 = 33 roses.;
Response:  We know that Jaden has 10 pairs of shoes and each pair contains 5 shoes. So, in total, Jaden has 10 x 5 = 50 shoes. Now, we are asked how many shoes Jessica has. Based on the information given earlier, Jessica has 20 pairs of shoes, which means she has 20 x 5 = 100 shoes in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of shoes Jaden and Jessica have is: 50 - 100 = -50 shoes.;
Response:  We know that Jaden has 13 roses and he gives one to each of his friends. So, in total, he gave away 13 x 4 = 52 roses. Now, we are asked how many roses Jaden has left after giving them all away. Since he had 13 roses initially and gave away 52 roses, he is left with 13 - 52 = -39 roses. Therefore, Jaden has -39 roses left.;
Response:  We know that Jaden has 15 roses and he gave 6 of them to Jessica. So, Jaden has 15 - 6 = 9 roses left. Now, we are told that Gen has 17 roses and she gave 96 of them to someone. So, Gen has 17 - 96 = -79 roses left. Since negative numbers cannot be used in this context, we can conclude that Gen did not give any roses away. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) None of the above.;
Response:  We have 12 roses and we want to give 5 of them to Jaden. So, we will have 7 roses left after giving 5 to Jaden. Now, we have 10 roses and we want to give 2 more to Orkide. So, we will have 8 roses left after giving 2 to Orkide. Therefore, Konbyen has 8 roses left.;
Response:  We have 10 roses and we want to divide them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 2.5 roses (10 / 4 = 2.5). Now let's consider the additional 2 orchids that were given as a bonus. Since there are already 4 people who got their share of roses, we can give 1 orchid to each of these 4 people, leaving us with 1 extra orchid. Therefore, the total number of orchids that each person gets is 2 + 1 = 3 orchids per person.;
Response:  If Jaden has 12 orchids and he gives 3 to Jessica, then Jaden has 9 orchids left.  If Jessica also gets 5 orchids from someone else, then she has 14 orchids in total.  So, the final number of orchids that Kounye has is 11 + 20 = 31 orchids.;
Response:  If Jaden has 19 roses and he gives one to each of his five friends, then how many roses will he have left? So, if he has 19 roses initially and gives 5 friends 1 rose each, then he will have 19 - 5 = 14 roses left.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many flowers are in each pot. According to the question, there are 10 pots of roses and each pot contains 9 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers in all pots is 9 x 10 = 90 flowers. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question which asks us to find out how many flowers are in each row. According to the question, there are 5 rows of roses and each row contains 26 flowers. So, the total number of flowers in all rows is 5 x 26 = 130 flowers. Finally, we need to add the total number of flowers in each pot and the total number of flowers in each row to get the overall total number of flowers. Therefore, the overall total number of flowers is 90 + 130 = 220 flowers.;
Response:  We have 16 roses and we want to divide them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 4 roses. Now, if there are 7 orchids and we want to divide them equally among 3 people, then each person will get 2 orchids. Therefore, the total number of roses and orchids that Jaden has is 4 + 2 = 6.;
Response:  We have 21 orkids and 22 roses in total. If we give one rose to each of the 7 children, then how many will be left for Jaden?  So, there will be 21 - 7 = 14 roses left for Jaden.;
Response:  We have 9 roses and we want to give 6 of them to Jaden. So, how many will be left for us?  There are 13 roses in total, so if we give 6 to Jaden, there will be 7 left for us (13 - 6 = 7).;
Response:  Cheve Robin has 17 pous (feet) long legs. If he wants to kick the ball with his feet, how many pous will he need to cover the distance of 13 pous from where he is standing to where he wants to kick the ball? So, we can say that Cheve Robin needs 13/17 = 0.76 pous to reach the spot where he wants to kick the ball.;
Response:  If Robin has 20 chickens and each chicken lays 5 eggs per day, then in one week (7 days), Robin will have 20 x 5 = 100 eggs from his chickens. So he can sell these eggs for $10 per egg, which means he will make $1000 from selling those eggs alone.;
Response:  Cheve Robin has 16 feet (pous) long. If he cuts 11 feet off, how many feet will be left for him? So, Cheve Robin is left with 5 feet (pous).;
"Response:  If Chevy Robin is 19 years old and has grown 18 inches taller since he was born, then his current height can be calculated as follows:  Height = Age + Growth  Height = 19 + (18 x 5)  Where ""x"" represents the number of years that have passed since birth. Therefore, Chevy Robin's current height is approximately 72 inches or 6 feet 2 inches tall.";
Response:  If Robin has 13 chickens and each chicken lays 5 eggs per day, then how many eggs will Robin have in total after 14 days? So, Robin will have 13 x 5 = 65 eggs in total after 14 days.;
Response:  Cheve has 14 paws and is 8 feet tall. If he catches 20 mice, then each mouse represents 3/5 of his height (since he caught 20 / 14 = 3/5 of his height). So, Cheve's height is 8 x 3/5 = 12 feet.;
Response:  We have 53 bottles of wine in total. If we want to know how many bottles are in each box, we can divide 53 by 12 (the number of boxes). So, there are 4.4 bottles per box (53 / 12 = 4.4).;
Response:  We have 53 bouchons (boutiques) in the city of Carrefour. Each bouchon has an average of 4 shelves per store, and each shelf can hold up to 8 products. Therefore, we have: Number of shelves = 53 x 4 = 212 shelves Total number of products = 212 x 8 = 1664 products So there are approximately 1664 products available for purchase in all the bouchons (boutiques) in the city of Carrefour.;
"Response:  We know that Danny has collected 63 bouchons and he gave away 51 of them to his friend Pandan. So, we have:

Number of bouchons Danny has = 63
Number of bouchons Danny gave away = 51
Now, let's find out how many bouchons Danny is left with:

Number of bouchons Danny is left with = Number of bouchons Danny has - Number of bouchons Danny gave away
= 63 - 51
= 12
So, Danny has 12 bouchons left in his collection.";
"Response:  We know that Danny has collected 36 bouchons and he gave 35 of them to Pandan. So, we have:

Number of bouchons Danny has = 36
Number of bouchons Danny gave to Pandan = 35
Now, let's find out how many bouchons are left with Danny after giving them to Pandan:

Number of bouchons left with Danny = Total number of bouchons - Number of bouchons given to Pandan
= 36 - 35
= 1
So, there is one bouchon left with Danny after giving 35 bouchons to Pandan.";
"Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 bouchons at Boutéy and he gave 63 vyes to his collection. So, we have:

Number of bouchons Danny has = 30
Total number of bouchons in the collection = 63 x 42 = 2584
So, the number of bouchons Danny gave away is:
Number of bouchons Danny gave away = Total number of bouchons in the collection - Number of bouchons Danny has = 2584 - 30 = 2554
Therefore, Danny gave away 2554 bouchons.";
Response:  We know that Danny has 22 bottles of oil and he wants to put them in boxes of 8 bottles each. So, he will need 3 boxes (22/8 = 3). Now, we have 3 boxes with 8 bottles each, so there are 24 bottles in total (3 x 8 = 24). Since there are 24 bottles in total, and Danny has 63 bottles in his collection, then he must have 63 - 24 = 39 extra bottles not included in the boxes (63 - 24 = 39). Therefore, Danny has 39 additional bottles beyond what is in the boxes (39).;
Response:  We have 22 bottles of wine in one box and 30 envelopes in another box. So we have a total of 52 bottles (22 + 30). Now, according to the problem, Danny has 17 bottles left after he distributed them among his friends. Therefore, the number of bottles that Danny had initially is equal to the number of bottles he gave away minus the number he has left, which is 52 - 17 = 35 bottles.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 30 bottles of wine in his collection and he wants to give 7 of them as gifts. So, we have 30 - 7 = 23 bottles left for him. Now, each bottle is wrapped in 14 envelopes, so we have 23 x 14 = 311 envelopes left. Since there are 86 envelopes in the entire collection, we can conclude that Danny has 86 - 311 = -225 envelopes remaining after giving away 7 bottles as gifts.;
"Response:  We know that Danny has 11 bottles of oil and he wants to put them in his bag. Each bottle contains 28 ml of oil, so we have:

$$ \text {Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total volume of oil}}{\text{Volume of each bottle}} $$

We want to find out how many bottles Danny can fit in his bag, which is 51 ml. So, we divide the total volume of oil (11 x 28 ml) by the volume of each bottle:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of bottles}} = \divide\nolinebreak\text{Total volume of oil by Volume of each bottle}} $$

Now we have:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of bottles}} = \divide\nolinebreak\text{11 x 28 ml by 28 ml} = 43 $$

So, Danny can fit 43 bottles of oil in his bag.";
Response:  We have 71 bottles of oil and we want to put them in boxes of 24 bottles each. So, we will need 3 boxes. Now, we have 28 bottles left over after packing 3 boxes of 24 bottles each. Therefore, Danny has 28 extra bottles of oil.;
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 10 bottles and 62 balloons. If he gives each of his friends 4 bottles and 5 balloons, then how many bottles will he have left?  So, Danny will have 27 bottles left in his collection.;
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 66 buttons and he wants to give 25 of them in collection. So, we need to find out how many buttons are left with him after giving away 25 buttons.  Buttons left with Danny = Total buttons collected by Danny - Number of buttons given in collection.  Total buttons collected by Danny = 66 Buttons.  Number of buttons given in collection = 25 Buttons.  Therefore, butons left with Danny = 66 - 25 = 41 buttons.;
Response:  We have 32 bottles of wine in total (Danny has 32).  If we divide this number equally among all the people at the party (including Danny), each person will get 25 bottles of wine (since there are 25 people in total). So, the answer is 25.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 60 new bottles and added them to his collection of 58 existing bottles, so he now has a total of 118 bottles in his collection (60 + 58 = 118). Now, we are asked how many more bottles Danny has than Konbyen, who has 67 bottles in their collection. To find out, we simply subtract Konbyen's number of bottles from Danny's total number of bottles: 118 - 67 = 51. So, Danny has 51 more bottles than Konbyen.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 6 balls in his bag after throwing 50 new balls into the pack. So, he has 6 + 50 = 56 balls in his collection now.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 54 new bottles and gave 48 of them to Jean. So, we have 52 - 48 = 6 more bottles in Danny's collection than what he gave to Jean. Therefore, there are 6 more bottles in Danny's collection than the number of bottles Jean received from him.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 82 bottles of oil and 29 bottles of vinegar in his collection. If he gives 42 bottles of oil to someone else, how many bottles will he have left? So, Danny has 82 - 42 = 40 bottles of oil left. Similarly, if he gives 29 bottles of vinegar to someone else, how many bottles will he have left? So, Danny has 29 - 29 = 0 bottles of vinegar left. Therefore, Danny has 40 + 0 = 40 bottles of oil and vinegar left in his collection.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 66 bottles of oil and 39 bottles of vinegar in his collection. If he gives 16 bottles of oil to someone else, how many bottles will he have left in his collection? So, Danny will have 40 (66 - 16) bottles of oil left in his collection.;
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 46 bottles and 50 capsules in his bag. He then gives 21 bottles to his friend with 52 envelopes in the collection. So, we need to find out how many bottles are left with Danny after giving them away. Therefore, the number of bottles left with Danny is:  Bottles = Total bottles - Number of bottles given away = 46 - 21 = 25 bottles.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 65 bottles of oil and he wants to put them in 5 boxes. Each box can hold 12 bottles (since there are 12 bottles per row). So, we need to divide 65 by 5 to find out how many boxes Danny can make: 65 / 5 = 13. Therefore, Danny can make 13 boxes. Now, let's count how many bottles each box can hold: 13 boxes x 12 bottles/box = 156 bottles. Since there are 9 empty containers in the collection, we subtract 9 from 156 to get the total number of full bottles: 156 - 9 = 147 bottles.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 58 bottles of oil and he gives 25 of them to his friend. So, Danny now has 33 bottles left (58 - 25 = 33). Then, we are told that Danny's friend gives him 11 more bottles, so now Danny has 44 bottles in total (33 + 11 = 44). Finally, we are asked how many bottles Danny has after adding the new ones to the old ones. Therefore, the answer is 44 bottles.;
Response:  We have 15 bottles of wine in one box and 35 bottles in another box that belong to Danny. If we add both boxes together, we get 67 bottles (15 + 35 = 67). So, Danny has 67 bottles of wine in his collection.;
Response:  If Jake (gen 11) pees on Steve (gen 17), then we can say that Jake has peed for 16 generations before reaching Steve. So, the number of generations between Jake and Steve is 16.;
Response:  We know that Jake is in generation 7 and Steven is in generation 14. So, Jake is one generation younger than Steven. Therefore, Jake's age is 14 - 7 = 7 years less than Steven's age. Since Jake is 15 years old, Steven must be 22 years old (14 + 7).;
Response:  We know that Jake is in generation 18 and has 10 friends.  Steven is in generation 13 and has 7 friends.  So, Jake has more friends than Steven.  Now, we need to find out how many friends Jake has.  He has 10 friends, so he has 10 x 2 = 20 friends in total.  Since Konbyen is in generation 19, he has fewer friends than Jake.  Therefore, Konbyen has 20 - 7 = 13 friends.;
Response:  We know that Jake is in generation 3 and has 5 pecks. Steven is in generation 8 and has 8 pecks more than Jake. So, Steven has 13 pecks (8 + 5). Now, we need to find out how many pecks Jill has. According to the question, Jill has 20 pecks more than Steven. Therefore, Jill has 33 pecks (20 + 13). Finally, we can say that Jake's pleasure is less than Jill's pleasure by 19 pecks (33 - 14).;
Response:  We know that Jake is in generation 12 and has 12 peaches.  Steven is in generation 11 and has 4 peaches. So, if we want to calculate how many peaches Jake has after giving some to Steven, we need to subtract the number of peaches Steven already has from the total number of peaches Jake has. Therefore, the answer is: Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 peaches left after giving some to Steven.;
Response:  We know that Jake is generation 7 and has 9 pecks of pastry. If he gives 3 pecks to Steven (generation 16), then Jake will have 6 pecks left. So, Jake gave 2/3 of his pecks to Steven.;
Response:  We know that Jake is in generation 7 and has 20 children with Steven who is in generation 8. So, Jake has 20 grandchildren through Steven. Now, we are told that Steven has 17 peaches. Therefore, Jake has 3 (20 - 17) peaches left after giving all his grandchildren to Steven.;
Response:  We know that Jake is generation 9 and has 18 pieces of candy.  Steven is generation 16 and has 20 pieces of candy. So, if we compare their number of candies, Steven has more than Jake. Specifically, Steven has 4 more pieces of candy (20 - 18 = 4) than Jake.;
Response:  We know that Jake is generation 6 and Steven is generation 18. So, we can say that Jake's parents are in generation 7 (Jake - 1 = parent). Similarly, Steven's children are in generation 20 (Steven + 1 = child). Now, we need to find out how many generations it takes for Jill to reach from her parents to Steven. From Jill's perspective, she moves one generation every time she has a child. Therefore, Jill moves from generation 5 to generation 6 when she has her first child, then from generation 6 to generation 7 when she has her second child, and so on. In total, it takes 3 generations for Jill to move from her parents to Steven. So, the answer is 3.;
Response:  We know that Jake is generation 5 and Steven is generation 18. So, we can say that Jake is 18 generations younger than Steven. Now, we are asked how many more peches (generations) Jill has than Jake. Since Jill is generation 87 and Jake is 18 generations younger than Steven, we can conclude that Jill is 69 generations older than Jake. Therefore, Jill has 69 more generations than Jake.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steven is 15 years old and he pees more than Jill who is 12 years old. So, if Jill generates $10 from each of her pee sessions, then she will generate $10 x 12 = $120 per year. Now, since Steven pees more than Jill, he will generate more money from his pee sessions. Therefore, if Steven generates $X amount of money from each of his pee sessions, then he will generate $X x 15 = $X500 per year. Since Jake is younger than both Steven and Jill, he will have to pay less for each of his pee sessions compared to what Steven pays. So, if Jake generates $Y amount of money from each of his pee sessions, then he will generate $Y x (15 - 12) = $Y75 per year. Therefore, the answer is $120 + $X500 - $Y75 = $925.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 peaches and Steve has 79 peaches. So, if we divide Jake's peaches by Steve's peaches, we get: 12/79 = 0.156 (or approximately 15.6%). Therefore, Konbyen's share of peaches is 84.4% (1 - 0.156).;
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 peaches and he gives 3 to Steve. So, Jake now has 13 - 3 = 10 peaches left. Then we know that Steve has 8 peaches. Therefore, the number of peaches Konbyen (the third person) gets from Jake is 10 - 8 = 2 peaches.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 peaches and 8 pomegranates. If we take away 2 peaches from Jake, he will have 4 peaches left. Now, let's see how many pomegranates Steven has after taking away 4 pomegranates from him. So, Steven had 17 pomegranates initially, and now he has 13 pomegranates left after taking away 4. Therefore, the difference between the number of peaches Jake has and the number of pomegranates Steven has is 4 (peaches) - 4 (pomegranates) = 0.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 10 pomegranates and he gives 3 to Steven. So, now Jake has 7 pomegranates left (10 - 3 = 7). Now, we are told that Steven has 12 pomegranates and he gives 5 to Konbyen. So, now Steven has 7 pomegranates left (12 - 5 = 7). Therefore, the final number of pomegranates that each person has is as follows: Jake has 7, Steven has 7, and Konbyen has none (0).;
Response:  We know that Steven is in generation 12 and has 67 pechs more than Jill who is in generation 4. So, if we subtract Jake's 4 pechs from Steven's total of 67 pechs, we get 63 pechs left for Steven. Therefore, Jake has 63 pechs less than Steven.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 peaches and Jake has 12 peaches. If Steven gives 8 of his peaches to Jill, then we can calculate how many peaches Jill gets as follows:  Number of peaches Jill gets = Total number of peaches given by Steven - Number of peaches already possessed by Jill  In this case, the total number of peaches given by Steven is 18 + 8 = 26 peches. Since Jill already possesses 12 peaches, the number of peaches she gets from Steven is 26 - 12 = 14 peaches. Therefore, Jill gets 14 peaches from Steven.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 peaches and Jake has 72 peaches more than Steven. So, if we multiply Jake's number of peches by 72, we get 504 peaches (Jake's total). Now, we need to subtract the number of peaches Steven has from the total number of peaches Jake has. Therefore, the answer is 504 - 19 = 485 peaches.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 peaches and Jake has 6 peaches. If Jake gives 3 of his peaches to Steven, then Jake will have 6 - 3 = 3 peaches left. So, Jill has 3 peaches.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 pomades and he gave 10 to Steve. So, Jake now has 74 pomades left. Then we are told that Steve has 52 pomades and he took 3 from Jake. So, Steve now has 49 pomades. Therefore, the number of pomades that Jake has after Steve took them is 74 - 3 = 71.;
Response:  We know that Jake is generation 13 and has 17 peaches more than Steven who is generation 8. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake = 13 + (17 - 8) = 13 + 9 = 22. Therefore, Jake has 22 peaches more than Steven.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 10 pomegranates and he gives 3 to Steven. So, now Jake has 7 pomegranates left. Then, we know that Steven has 18 pomegranates in total (including the 3 he got from Jake). Therefore, the number of pomegranates that Steven has after giving some to Genna is 15 (18 - 3 = 15).;
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 peaches and wants to share them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 3/4 = 0.75 peach. Now we need to find out how many peches Steven has. According to the question, Steven has 19 peaches, which is equal to 19 x 0.75 = 14 peaches. Therefore, the number of peaches that Konbyen gets from Steven is 14 peaches.;
"Response:  We are given that Te Gen has 78 dollars and he wants to buy a bike for $15. So, we need to find out how many bikes Te Gen can buy with his money. To do this, we divide the amount of money Te Gen has ($78) by the cost of one bike ($15):

$78 / $15 = 5

So, Te Gen can buy 5 bikes with his $78.";
Response:  If Olivia has $78 in her pocket and she gives $33 to someone, then she will have $45 left ($78 - $33 = $45). So, the number of okonomans (bags of rice) that can be bought with the money she has left is: $45 / $10 = 4.5 okonomans.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olivia has $100 in her account and she withdraws $148 from an ATM. So, after this transaction, her balance is $100 - $148 = -$48. Now, let's assume that she spends another $159 at a market. Therefore, her new balance after this transaction will be -$48 + $159 = $111.;
Response:  If Olivia has $49 in her account and she withdraws $20 from an ATM, then she will have $29 left in her account after the transaction.;
Response:  We know that Olivia has $91 in her account and she withdraws $40 from an ATM. After this transaction, she is left with $51 in her account. So, the difference between what she had before the transaction and after the transaction is $40 - $51 = -$11. Therefore, the amount of money that Olivia owes to the bank is $11.;
Response:  We know that $Olivia$ spent $\$106$ at the store and she got a discount of $\$26$. So, she paid $\$70$ for the visit to the market. Now, we need to find out how much money she spent in total. Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Total amount spent = Original price - Discount = $\$106$ - $\$26$ = $\$70$ So, the correct answer is $\$70$.;
Response:  We are given that Olivia visited 29 places and spent $54 at each place. So, in total, she spent:  $54 x 29 = $1,536;
Response:  If Olivia has $38 in her pocket and she gives $128 to her friend, then we need to find out how much money is left with Olivia after giving it to her friend. So, the amount of money left with Olivia = $38 - ($128 / 4) = $38 - $32 = $6. Therefore, there are $6 left with Olivia after giving $128 to her friend.;
"Response:  We know that there are 5 stages of development in the life cycle of an application. These stages are:

1. Ideation - This is the initial stage where an idea for an application is conceived and explored.
2. Design - In this stage, the design and user experience (UX) of the application are developed.
3. Development - Here, the actual coding and building of the application take place.
4. Testing - The application is tested to ensure it works as intended and meets quality standards.
5. Launch - Finally, the application is launched and made available to users.

So, if we assume that ""Dave"" has been working on his mobile app for about 19 days, then he would have completed the following stages of development:

Day 1-5: Ideation and Design - During these early stages, Dave would have been brainstorming ideas and developing the UX/UI design of his app.
Day 6-10: Development - At this stage, Dave would have started writing code and building the basic functionality of his app.
Day 11-15: Testing - As the app takes shape, Dave would have been testing its features and ensuring they work correctly.
Day 16-19: Preparation for launch - In the final stages, Dave would be preparing his app for release, including submitting it to app stores, configuring analytics tools, and conducting final quality assurance checks.

Therefore, based on the given information, Dave has completed approximately 75% of the development process (19 days / 5 stages = 75%).";
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times 18 goes into 50. So, we divide 50 by 18 and get 2.77777777777778. Now, let's round this number up to the nearest whole number which is 3. Therefore, there are 3 stages of development for a mobile application from concept to launch.;
Response:  We have 10 apps in total (Dave has 10 apps). Then we add 11 new apps to make it 21 apps in total. Now, let's calculate how many apps are left after removing 4 of them. So, the remaining apps are 21 - 4 = 17 apps.;
Response:  We have 21 apps already installed on our phone and we add 8 more new apps. So, in total, we have 21 + 8 = 30 apps installed on our phone. Now, let's assume that each of these apps takes up some space on our phone's memory. If we estimate an average size of around 5 MB per app (which is a rough estimate), then the total storage required for all 30 apps would be 30 x 5 MB = 150 MB. Therefore, if we add 8 new apps to our phone with a total storage requirement of 150 MB, it will take approximately 150 / 21 = 7 days for the phone to fill up its entire storage capacity.;
Response:  We have 15 apps already installed on our phone and we want to add 7 more apps. So, in total, we have 22 apps installed (15 + 7 = 22). Now, let's assume that each of these apps takes up some space on our phone's memory. The average size of an app is around 10 MB, so let's assume that each app takes up about 10 MB of storage space. Therefore, if we install 7 new apps, it will take up approximately 70 MB of additional storage space (7 x 10 MB = 70 MB). So, after installing the 7 new apps, the total amount of storage space used by all the apps on our phone would be approximately 90 MB (22 x 10 MB = 90 MB).;
Response:  We know that there are 5 apps and each app has 23 files. So, in total, we have 5 x 23 = 115 files. Now, let's calculate how many megabytes (MB) these files occupy. The size of each file is given in bytes, so we need to convert it to megabytes. There are 1024 kilobytes (KB) in one megabyte (MB), so: 1 MB = 1024 KB. Therefore, the total size of all files is: 115 files x 23 bytes/file = 2695 bytes Total size of all files = 2695 bytes / 1024 KB = 2.6 GB.;
Response:  We know that there are three apps and each app has seven files. So, in total, we have 3 x 7 = 21 files. Therefore, the answer is 21.;
Response:  We know that there are 15 apps in total and each app has at least one file associated with it. So, the number of files is at least 15 x 2 = 30. However, some apps may have more than one file associated with them, so we need to count the number of unique files. From the information given, we can see that there are 21 apps with exactly 4 files each, which means they have a total of 4 x 21 = 84 files. Therefore, the total number of files associated with all 21 apps is 84. Now, let's calculate the number of apps that have at least one file associated with them. Since there are 21 apps with exactly 4 files each, these apps definitely have at least one file associated with them. So, the number of apps with at least one file is 21. Finally, we can conclude that out of the 21 apps with at least one file, 19 apps (i.e., 21 - 2) have at least two files associated with them.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 apps with files and each app has 15 files in total. So, the number of files in all apps is 6 x 15 = 90 files. Now, we need to find out how many files are shared between the two phones. To do this, we will count the number of common files among the two sets of apps. From the given information, we can see that App A has 3 files in common with Phone B, App B has 2 files in common with Phone B, and so on. Therefore, the total number of common files between the two phones is 3 + 2 +... = 15 common files. Finally, we subtract the number of common files from the total number of files in all apps to get the number of unique files on each phone: Unique files on Phone A = Total files in all apps - Common files = 90 - 15 = 75 unique files. Similarly, Unique files on Phone B = Total files in all apps - Common files = 90 - 15 = 75 unique files. So, both phones have 75 unique files.;
Response:  We have 17 apps installed on our phone and we want to add another one. So, the total number of apps is 17 + 1 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.;
Response:  We know that there are 59 files in total and we want to divide them equally among 12 applications. So, each application will get an average of 59/12 = 4.9 apps per application. Now, let's check if this is a whole number or not.  Yes, it is! Each application will get exactly 5 apps on average.;
Response:  We know that Dave has 24 files in his phone and he wants to transfer them to 13 apps. So, we need to divide the total number of files (24) by the number of apps he wants to transfer them to (13). Therefore, the number of files each app will receive is: 24 / 13 = 1.85 or approximately 19 files per app.;
Response:  We know that there are 24 applications in total and each application has at least one file associated with it. So, the number of files generated is at least 24 x 1 = 24 files. However, we also know that some applications may have more than one file associated with them, so the actual number of files could be higher. Therefore, our estimated answer is between 24 and 36 files.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 files associated with each of the 2 apps in total (i.e., 6 files). Since we have 24 hours in a day, and each file takes up 1 megabyte of space, then the total amount of storage used by all these files is equal to 6 x 1 MB = 6 MB. Therefore, the number of files that can be stored on a phone with 24 megabytes of storage capacity is 24 / 6 = 4.;
Response:  We know that there are 242 cats in total and Jeff has 136 of them. So, if we take away the number of cats Jeff has from the total number of cats, we get: 242 - 136 = 106 cats left with Nell.;
Response:  We know that Jeff has 301 cats and he gives 154 of them to Nell. So, we can calculate the number of cats Nell now has as follows:  Number of cats Nell has = Total number of cats given to her - Number of cats given to Jeff  Number of cats Nell has = 154 - 301  Number of cats Nell has = -147  Therefore, Nell now has negative 147 cats.;
Response:  If Nell has collected 528 cats and Jeff has collected 11 cats, then together they have collected 639 cats (528 + 11 = 639). Now, if we subtract the number of cats that Jeff has collected from the total number of cats collected by both Nell and Jeff, we get 470 cats left with Nell (639 - 11 = 470). So, the number of cats that Nell has left is 470.;
Response:  If Jeff has 234 cats and he gives 10 to Nell, then Jeff will have 224 cats left (234 - 10 = 224). Now, if Nell collects 566 cats from other people, she will have a total of 790 cats (566 + 224 = 790). So, the number of cats that Jeff gave to Nell is 790 - 224 = 566 cats.;
Response:  We know that Jeff has 309 cats and he wants to give some of them away for free. He gives 356 cats to 10 people at $10 each. So, he makes $10 x 10 = $100 in profit from giving those cats away. Now, we need to find out how many cats Nell can get for free. Since she gets 415 cats for free, she has $415 - $100 = $315 left after buying all those cats. Therefore, Nell can buy 315 / 10 = 31.5 cats for free.;
Response:  We have 3 groups of cats: 246 cats in group A, 214 cats in group B, and 10 cats in group C.  If we add all these numbers together, we get: 246 + 214 = 458.  Now, let's subtract the number of cats that Jeff has (404): 458 - 404 = 54. So, there are 54 cats left after Jeff took some away.;
Response:  We know that Nell has collected 573 cats and wants to give some of them away. She decides to give 195 cats to John and 210 cats to Jeff. So, how many cats does Nell have left after giving them away?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of cats Nell has = Total number of cats - Number of cats given to John - Number of cats given to Jeff = 573 - 195 - 210 = 188 cats. Therefore, Nell has 188 cats left after giving them away.;
Response:  We know that Jeff has 55 cats and 178 cats are in total. So, we need to find out how many cats are with Nell.  Now, if we divide the number of cats with Jeff (55) by the total number of cats (178), we get the proportion of cats with Nell. Therefore, the number of cats with Nell is 55/178 = 10.;
Response:  We have 239 cats in total and 38 of them are black. So, we can say that out of every 10 cats, 3 are black. Now, let's find out how many black cats Jeff has. If Jeff has 111 black cats, then he has a total of 376 cats (including both black and non-black). Therefore, the number of black cats among the 10 cats that Jeff owns is 37/10 = 3.7.;
Response:  If Paco has 19 biscuits and he gives 3 of them to Gen, then Paco has 19 - 3 = 16 biscuits left. Now, if Gen gets 35 biscuits, then the total number of biscuits that Paco and Gen have together is 16 + 35 = 51 biscuits.;
Response:  We know that Paco has 28 bonbons and he gives 7 to Gen. So, Paco now has 28 - 7 = 21 bonbons left. Then, we are asked how many bonbons Konbyen will have if she takes one from Paco. Therefore, Konbyen will have 21 + 1 = 22 bonbons.;
Response:  We have 40 bonbons in total and Paco took 2 of them. So we are left with 38 bonbons. Then, Paco bought 37 more bonbons from someone else. Now, we have 75 bonbons (38 + 37) in total. Therefore, the number of bonbons that Paco has is 75 / 2 = 37.;
Response:  If Paco has 25 biscuits and he gives 5 to you, then he has 20 biscuits left (25 - 5 = 20). Now, if he asks you for 3 pieces of chocolate in exchange for one of his biscuits, that means he will have 17 biscuits left after giving you one (20 - 3 = 17). So, the correct answer is 17.;
Response:  If Paco has 13 biscuits and he gives 2 to you, then he has 13 - 2 = 11 biscuits left.  If he then gives you 3 more biscuits, then he has 11 - 3 = 8 biscuits left. So, the number of biscuits Paco has left is 8.;
"Response:  We have:
Paco has 40 bonbons and he wants to share them equally among his 5 friends. So each friend will get:
40 / 5 = 8 bonbons per friend.";
Response:  We have 17 biscuits and we want to share them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 3 biscuits (17 / 5 = 3). Now, let's say we want to give an extra bonus of 2 biscuits to one of the friends. So, that friend will get 5 biscuits in total (3 + 2 = 5). As for the remaining 4 friends, they will get 3 biscuits each (17 - 5 = 12), which is equal to 48 bonbons (12 x 4 = 48). Therefore, the answer is 48.;
Response:  We have to multiply 12 by 2 because we need twice as much of Biskwit for the recipe (since we want to make 21 Biscuits). So, we will need 24 Biskwits in total. Now, let's calculate how many Bonbons we can get with that amount of Biskwits. If we divide 24 Biskwits by 16 Biscuits per bag, we get 3 bags of Bonbons. Therefore, the answer is 3 bags of Bonbons.;
Response:  We know that Paco has 22 bonbons and he gives away 75 of them as gifts. So, he has 75 - 22 = 53 remaining bonbons left with him. Now, we are asked how many bonbons Paco will have after he eats 15 more. Therefore, the number of bonbons Paco will have after eating 15 more is 53 + 15 = 68.;
Response:  We have 9 pacos and each one has 9 bonbons inside. So, we have 9 x 9 = 81 bonbons in total. Now, we take away 6 of them, so we are left with 81 - 6 = 75 bonbons. Finally, we divide it by 3 (the number of sales) to get the answer: 75 / 3 = 25 bonbons sold.;
Response:  We have 37 pacos and we eat 11 of them. So, we have 37 - 11 = 26 remaining pacos. Then, we eat 5 more pacos, so we have 26 - 5 = 21 remaining pacos left. Now, let's compare how many pacos we had initially with how many we have after eating all the pacos. Initially, we had 37 pacos, and now we have 21 pacos left, which means that we have lost 16 pacos (37 - 21). Therefore, the answer is 16.;
Response:  We have 8 bags of biscuits (gen) and 6 bags of sales biscuits. If we sell each bag of biscuits at $34, then we will make $252 in total from selling all the biscuits. However, if we buy 20 boxes of biscuits at $17 each, then we will spend $340 in total. So, the difference between what we make and what we spend is $252 - $340 = -$98. Therefore, we will lose money if we buy more than 20 boxes of biscuits.;
Response:  If Paco has already eaten 36 bonbons and he is given another one (37th), then his total number of bonbons will be 37 + 36 = 73. So, if he continues to eat bonbons at this rate, in 10 minutes (okòmansman) he will have eaten 73 / 10 = 7.3 bonbons per minute.;
Response:  We know that Paco has 36 bonbons in total and he gives 10 of them to his friend. So, we have 26 remaining bonbons for Paco (36 - 10 = 26).;
Response:  We have 41 pacas (bonbons) in total.  If we take away 9 that Paco has already eaten, then we are left with 32 bonbons. Now, if each of us takes an equal number of bonbons, then we will have 32 / 5 = 6.4 bonbons per person. So, Paco would have to share his remaining 9 bonbons with the other four people, resulting in each person getting 6.4 + 9 = 15.4 bonbons in total.;
Response:  We have 6 bags of biscuits (Paco) and each bag contains 30 biscuits. Zanmi wants to share 23 biscuits with his friend. So, we need to calculate how many bags Zanmi can get from the total number of biscuits. To do this, we divide the total number of biscuits (30 x 6 = 180) by the number of biscuits Zanmi wants to share (23). Therefore, Zanmi can get 180 / 23 = 7.85 bags of biscuits from the total amount. Since you cannot have a fraction of a bag, Zanmi can get 8 bags of biscuits.;
Response:  We know that Paco has 97 cats and he sold 34 of them. So, he has 97 - 34 = 63 cats left. Now, we are told that for every cat he sells, he gives 56 bonbons to his friend. Since he sold 34 cats, he gave away 34 x 56 = 1824 bonbons. Therefore, the number of bonbons Paco has left is 63 - 1824 = -1761 bonbons.;
Response:  We know that Paco has 26 cats and he sells 17 of them. So, he has 9 cats left with him. Now, we are given that Konbyen has 14 bones for sale and 9 bones for free. So, the number of bones Konbyen gives to Paco is 5 (14 - 9).;
Response:  We have 39 pacos and each one has 4 bonbons inside. So we have 39 x 4 = 156 bonbons in total. Then, we are asked to find out how many bonbons Paco can eat at once. The question says he can eat 6 bonbons at a time, so we need to divide the total number of bonbons by 6: 156 / 6 = 26. Therefore, Paco can eat 26 bonbons at once.;
"Response:  We have:
Paco has 40 bonnies and sells 25 of them at $2 each. He is left with 15 bonnies.
Koby has 15 bonnies and sells 7 of them at $3 each. He is left with 8 bonnies.
Now, Koby wants to buy some bonnies from Paco. How many bonnies can Koby afford to buy if he spends all his money (which is equal to the amount he sold his bonnies for)?
Let's calculate:
Koby spent $21 (7 x $3) on buying bonnies from Paco. So, he has $21 - $21 = $0 left after buying the bonnies.
Therefore, Koby can afford to buy $0 / $3 = 0 bonnies from Paco.";
Response:  We have $7 initially and we spend $1 each time we pass by a store. So after the first passage, we will have $6 ($7 - $1). Then, when we pass by another store, we will spend $1 again, so now we have $5 ($6 - $1). Therefore, after passing by all stores, we will have $5 left.;
Response:  We have to find out how many eggs Gwen has in total and then divide it by 8 to get the number of eggs she can give away. So, if Gwen has 14 eggs in total (6 + 8), she can give away 2 eggs (14 / 8 = 2).;
Response:  We have $2 from grandma and we spend $1 to buy a present for mom. So we have $2 - $1 = $1 left. If we then give $3 to someone, we will be left with $1 - $3 = $-2$. Therefore, the person will owe us $2$.;
Response:  We have $8 from grandma and we give $5 to our brother. So, we have $3 left. If we spend $4, then we will be left with nothing. Therefore, the correct answer is: 0;
Response:  We have $3 from Grandma and $2 from Papa. If we spend $4, then we will be left with $1 ($3 - $4 = $1). So, the amount of money that Gwen has after spending $4 is $1.;
Response:  We have $5 from Gwen and we need to buy 7 apples at $1 each. So, we will spend $7 in total. If we get a discount of $4, then we will pay only $3 for the apples. Therefore, the remaining amount that Gwen needs to give is $3 - $4 = $1.;
Response:  We have $5 from Grandma and $2 from Auntie. If we spend $6, then we will be left with nothing. So, the amount of money that Gwen has after spending $6 is zero.;
Response:  We have 9 balls in total and we want to divide them equally among 4 bowls. So, each bowl will get 2 balls (9/4 = 2).;
Response:  We have 21 balls in one collection and we want to know how many balls are in another collection of 12 balls. So, if each ball is counted once, then there will be a total of 21 + 12 = 33 balls in both collections combined. Therefore, the answer is 33.;
Response:  We have 19 balls in total (boul nan koleksyon).  If we take away 5 new balls that were added (jwenn 5 nouvo), then we are left with 14 balls (li pèdi). So, the number of balls remaining after taking away the new ones is 14.;
Response:  We have 4 balls in total and we want to divide them equally among 8 new players. So, each player will get 4/8 = 0.5 balls per player. Therefore, there are 8 players who will receive 0.5 balls each, for a total of 4 + 4 = 8 balls distributed among the new players.;
Response:  We have 7 balls in one collection and we want to add 10 new balls to it. So, the total number of balls will be 7 + 10 = 17.;
Response:  We have 21 balls in one collection and we want to know how many collections of 7 balls each can be made with these balls. To do this, we need to divide 21 by 7. So, there are 3 (21 / 7 = 3) collections of 7 balls each that can be made with these 21 balls.;
Response:  We have 20 balls in total (boul nan koleksyon).  Of these, 10 are red (li bay 2 boul pou Jack) and 10 are blue (koleksyon l. li bay). So, there are 5 red balls for every 4 blue balls (konbyen boul Josh genyen kounye a). Therefore, the ratio of red to blue balls is 5:4 or 1:1.;
Response:  We know that Josh has 22 balls in his collection and he wants to give some of them away. He currently has 20 balls with him at the park. So, if he gives away all the extra 2 balls he has at home, then he will have 20 - 2 = 18 balls left with him at the park.;
Response:  If Josh has 11 balls and he gives 3 to his friend, then he will have 8 balls left.  If he then gets 5 more balls from his other friends, he will have 13 balls in total (8 + 5 = 13). So, the final number of balls that Josh has is 13.;
Response:  We have 22 balls in one collection and we want to divide them equally among 13 bowls. So, each bowl will get 22/13 = 1 ball. Now, let's consider the remaining 5 balls that are left over after dividing them into 13 bowls. How many balls will each of these 5 bowls get? Well, since there are only 5 bowls left, they will get all 5 balls together. Therefore, the total number of balls that each bowl will get is 5 + (5 - 1) = 9 balls.;
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are in each basket and then add them up.  For the first basket, we have 9 big balls + 7 small balls = 16 balls.  For the second basket, we have 4 big balls + 8 small balls = 12 balls.  So, altogether there are 16 + 12 = 28 balls in the two baskets.;
Response:  We have 3 balls in one collection and we want to add 6 more balls to it. So, the total number of balls will be 3 + 6 = 9. Now, there are 9 balls in the collection, and each ball has a diameter of 5 meters. Therefore, the total area of all the balls is π × (5 m)^2 = 78.5 square meters.;
Response:  We know that Marco weighs 5 kg and has 4 lives left. If he eats frozen yogurt, he will lose 1 life for every 20 grams of frozen yogurt consumed. Therefore, if Marco consumes 300 grams (300 / 20 = 15) of frozen yogurt, he will lose 1 life. So, Marco loses 1 life in this scenario.;
Response:  We know that Marco has 13 lives and Papa L has 35 lives. So, if we subtract Marco's lives from Papa L's lives, we get: 35 - 13 = 22 lives left for Papa L.;
Response:  We know that Marco has 20 lives and Papa has 17 lives. So, if they are fighting each other, Marco will lose 3 lives (since he has 20 lives and Papa has 17 lives). Therefore, after the fight, Marco will have 17 lives left.;
"Response:  We have:
Marco has 8 lives of frozen french fries (frèz). He gives 32 lives to Papa L. So, Marco now has 0 lives left.
Now, we need to calculate how much money Marco gained from giving away his frozen french fries. Since he gave away 32 lives worth of fries, and each life is worth $1, Marco gained $32. Therefore, Marco gained $32 in total.";
Response:  We know that Marco has 24 lives and he lost 9 lives in the freezer. So, he has 15 lives left. Now, we are asked how many lives Marco would have if he had 3 lives more than his father. Therefore, we can say that Marco has 18 lives (15 + 3 = 18).;
Response:  We know that Marco has 36 lives and he lost 8 lives in the cold. So, he has 28 lives left. Now, we are asked how many lives Marco would have if he had 12 lives more than his current number of lives. Therefore, if Marco had 12 additional lives, he would have 40 lives (28 + 12 = 40).;
Response:  We know that Marco has 22 pounds of meat and he wants to divide it equally among his three children so each child gets 10 pounds (Marco's weight in pounds - 22 / 3 = 10). Now we need to find out how much meat each child will get if they are all equal in weight. So, if Marco weighs 30 pounds, then each child weighs 30/3 = 10 pounds. Therefore, the total amount of meat each child gets is 10 x 3 = 30 pounds. Since there are four people in total (Marco and his three children), the total amount of meat available is 4 x 30 = 120 pounds.;
Response:  We know that Marco weighs 5 kg and has 37 liters of frozen yogurt. To calculate how much each liter of frozen yogurt weighs, we can use the formula: weight = volume x density. Since water has a density of approximately 1 g/cm^3, we can assume that the density of frozen yogurt is similar (although it may be slightly higher due to its creamier consistency). Therefore, if we convert 37 liters of frozen yogurt from volume to mass using the above formula, we get: mass = volume x density = 37 L x 1000 g / L x density = 37,000 g or 37 kg So, Marco has 37 kg of frozen yogurt.;
Response:  We know that Marco has 30 pounds of rice and he wants to sell it for $17 per pound. So, we can calculate the total amount of money he will get as follows: Total weight of rice = 30 pounds x 450 grams/pound = 13,500 grams Total amount of money = Total weight of rice x Selling price/gram = 13,500 grams x $17/gram = $229,500 Therefore, if Marco sells his 30 pounds of rice at $17 per pound, he will get $229,500 in total.;
"Response:  We know that Marco weighs 5 kg and has 26 liters of water in his freezer. To calculate how much ice he can make from this water, we need to consider the density of ice. The density of ice is approximately 0.9 g/cm^3. Therefore, if we convert 26 liters of water into ice, we will get:

Volume of ice = Volume of water x Density of ice
= 26 L x 0.9 g/cm^3
= 23.4 kg

So, Marco can make around 23.4 kilograms of ice from the 26 liters of water he has in his freezer.";
Response:  We know that Marco has 5 kg of rice and he wants to share it equally among his 30 friends. So, each friend will get 1/30 th part of the total weight which is equal to 5 kg / 30 = 0.167 kg (or 167 grams). Therefore, Marco will have 5 - 0.167 = 4.833 kg (or 483 grams) of rice left after sharing with his friends.;
Response:  We have 10 children who are playing with toys in a room. Each child has 5 toys, so there are 50 toys in total (10 children x 5 toys per child). Now, let's assume that half of these toys are broken or lost, which means we have 25 toys left (50 toys - 25 toys = 25 toys). So, out of the remaining 25 toys, each child now has 4 toys (25 toys / 10 children = 4 toys per child). Therefore, the number of toys each child has after some of them broke or got lost is 4 toys.;
Response:  We have 26 children playing at the beach and they are divided into groups of 4 to play games. Each group has 7 children in it. So, how many groups can we make with these 26 children?  Therefore, there will be 26 / 7 = 3 groups of children playing together.;
Response:  We have 2 lots of 30 children each at the estate (a total of 60 children). If we give them 41 toys, then each child will get 41/60 = 0.68 toys. So, there are 0.68 toys per child at the estate.;
Response:  We have 43 children who are playing in the park. They divided into two groups of 21 children each to play different games. How many children will be left out of the game if there are only 21 children available for the game at the park?;
Response:  We have 41 children playing in the park and they are divided into two groups of 20 each to play different games. One group is playing tag and has 18 children. How many children are left playing other games in the park if we subtract the number of children playing tag from the total number of children playing in the park?;
Response:  We have 21 children playing at an amusement park and they are divided into groups of 10 to play games. Each group has 5 children in it. So, there will be 5 groups in total with 5 children each. Now, let's calculate how many children are left over after forming these groups. There will be 16 children left over since we had 21 children initially and formed 5 groups of 5 children each.;
Response:  We have 63 children who are playing at the beach and they want to divide into groups of 10 each. So, we need to find out how many groups can be formed with these 63 children. To do this, we use division.  Division is when you divide a number (in this case, 63) by another number (in this case, 10). When you divide one number by another, you get the number of groups that can be formed using those numbers. In this case, 63 divided by 10 gives us 6 groups. Therefore, there will be 6 groups of 10 children each. Now let's check if our calculation is correct. If we take 14 children from the total of 63 children, then we will have 49 children left over. Since we want to make sure that every group has 10 children in it, we cannot leave any child without a group. So, we must add 4 more groups to accommodate all the remaining children. This means that there will be 7 groups of 10 children each, for a total of 7 x 10 = 70 children.;
Response:  We have 36 children playing at the beach and they are divided into groups of 6 each to play with the sand castle building competition. Each group has 68 children who will judge their work. If we assume that every child in a group builds one sand castle, then there will be 12 sand castles in total (6 x 68 = 408). So, the number of children who can build sand castles is 408 / 12 = 34.;
Response:  We have 22 children playing in the park and they are divided into two groups of 11 children each to play different games. One group is playing tag and has 5 children remaining after playing for 3 hours. The other group is playing hide-and-seek and has 7 children remaining after playing for 2 hours. How many children will be left playing the game when both groups finish their respective games simultaneously?;
"Response:  We have 82 students in total and we want to divide them into groups of 30 each. So, we need to find out how many groups we can make with these 82 students. To do this, we will use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result or quotient. In this case, we are dividing 82 by 30 to see how many groups we can make.  The result of this division is 2765 (82 divided by 30). This means that we can make 2765 groups of 30 students each using all 82 students. Now let's check if there are any remaining students after forming these groups. If there are no remaining students, then the answer is yes; otherwise, the answer is no.  Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.";
Response:  We have 23 children playing with 24 balls in an estate where there are 8 trees. Each child has one ball to play with and they want to put all their balls under the trees. How many balls will each tree hold?;
Response:  We have 133 cats and we want to know how many cats are in 51 balls of cat food that Baker has given us. So, if each ball of cat food can feed 6 cats (as mentioned in the question), then we need to divide 133 cats by 6 to get the number of balls of cat food needed to feed all the cats. Therefore, the answer is 22 balls of cat food (133 / 6 = 22).;
Response:  We have 54 cats and we want to know how many groups of 13 cats each can be formed. To do this, we need to divide 54 by 13. So, the number of groups of 13 cats that can be formed is: 54 / 13 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 groups of 13 cats each.;
Response:  We are given that there are 145 cats in total and we want to know how many cats Baker has. So, if Baker has 72 cats, then the remaining cats are equal to 145 - 72 = 73 cats. Therefore, Baker has 73 cats.;
Response:  We have to find out how many cats Boulane can fit in a basket of 155 grams. So we need to divide the weight of the basket (in grams) by the weight of one cat (in grams). According to the information provided earlier, the weight of one cat is 140 grams. Therefore, we can calculate as follows: Number of cats that Boulane can fit in a basket = Weight of basket / Weight of one cat  Number of cats = 155 g / 140 g = 1.14 or approximately 1 and 1/4 cats.;
Response:  We have 121 cats initially and we give away 105 of them to someone else. So, we have 16 (121 - 105) remaining cats left with us. Now, we buy 170 new cats. Therefore, the total number of cats we have now is 16 + 170 = 186 cats.;
Response:  We know that Boulange has 13 cats and gives 91 to Yo and 154 to Noeuvogato. So, if we subtract the number of cats given to Yo from the total number of cats owned by Boulange, we get:  Number of cats left with Boulanger = Total number of cats owned by Boulanger - Number of cats given to Yo = 13 - 91 = -78 Therefore, Boulanger has 78 fewer cats than he had initially.;
Response:  We know that Boulange has 170 cats and gives 78 to Yo. So, he still has 92 cats left (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he gets 31 new cats from somewhere. Now, Boulange has 92 + 31 = 123 cats in total. As for Baker, we are told that he already has 78 cats, so he doesn't get any more cats from Boulange. Therefore, the number of cats Baker currently has is 78.;
Response:  We know that 110 cats were given to Jean. Out of these, 75 cats are left with him. So, we have 35 cats remaining with Jean. Now, let's find out how many cats Boulanger has after giving some to Toussaint. According to the problem, Boulanger gave 76 cats to Toussaint. So, the number of cats Boulanger has now is equal to the number of cats he had initially minus the number of cats he gave to Toussaint. Therefore, the answer is 35 - 76 = -41 cats.;
Response:  We know that Boulange has 144 cats and gives 71 to Yo. So, Boulange has 73 cats left (144 - 71 = 73). Now, we are told that Li has 111 lots of cat food. If each lot contains 73 cats, then Li has given away 829 cats (111 x 73 = 829). Therefore, Baker has 560 cats left (829 - 73 = 560).;
Response:  We have to find out how many cats are in total and then divide them into two groups of 90 and 50 cats respectively. So, we can start with the given information as follows: Total number of cats = 149 Number of cats in group A (90 cats) + Number of cats in group B (59 cats) = 149 Now, let's calculate the number of cats in each group separately: Group A: Number of cats in Group A = 149 / 2 = 74.5 cats Group B: Number of cats in Group B = 149 - 74.5 = 74.5 cats Therefore, there are 74.5 cats in Group A and 74.5 cats in Group B.;

Response:  We have to find out how many liters of water are needed for 8 cats to drink. If each cat needs 40 ml of water per day, then we need to calculate how many days it will take for all 8 cats to drink 40 ml of water. So, if there are 8 cats and each cat needs 40 ml of water per day, then the total amount of water needed is 320 ml (8 x 40 = 320). Therefore, the answer is 320 ml.;
Response:  We have to find out how many cats are in the world and then divide it by the number of people in Haiti. So let's start with finding out how many cats are in the world. According to my research, there are approximately 600 million domestic cats in the world. Now, let's calculate the number of cats per person in Haiti. Based on the latest estimate from the United Nations, the population of Haiti is around 11 million people. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cats per person in Haiti as follows: Number of cats per person in Haiti = Total number of cats in the world / Population of Haiti  Number of cats per person in Haiti = 600,000,000 / 11,000,000 = Approximately 54 cats per person in Haiti. Now that we know the number of cats per person in Haiti, we can multiply it by the total number of people in Haiti (169,000) to get the approximate number of cats in Haiti: Number of cats in Haiti = Number of cats per person in Haiti x Total number of people in Haiti Number of cats in Haiti = 54 x 169,000 = Approximately 8,826,000 cats in Haiti.;
Response:  We have been given that we have 173 cats and we buy 103 new cats. So, the total number of cats we have is 173 + 103 = 276 cats. Now, we are asked how many cats we will have after selling 86 cats. Therefore, the final number of cats we have is 276 - 86 = 190 cats.;
Response:  We are given that Boulanger has 99 cats and he buys 167 new cats. After selling some of them, he is left with 89 cats. Now, let's calculate how many cats Baker bought. To do this, we need to subtract the number of cats Boulanger had before buying from the total number of cats he bought. So, the answer is:  Number of cats Baker bought = Total number of cats bought - Number of cats Boulanger had before buying = 167 - 99 = 68 cats.;
Response:  We are given that Boulanger has 8 cats and he sells 139 new cats. So, the total number of cats sold by Boulanger is 139 + 8 = 147 cats. Now, we are asked how many cats Baker buys from Boulanger. Since Baker buys 145 cats from Boulanger, the difference between the number of cats bought by Baker and the total number of cats sold by Boulanger is 145 - 147 = -2 cats. Therefore, Baker does not buy any cat from Boulanger.;
Response:  We have to find out how many cats Boulane has if he gave away 62 cats and received 149 cats in return. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of cats given away = 62 cats Number of cats received in return = 149 cats Now, let's subtract the number of cats given away from the number of cats received in return: Number of cats left with Boulane = 149 - 62 = 87 cats Therefore, Boulane has 87 cats left with him after giving away 62 cats and receiving 149 cats in return.;
Response:  We know that Boulange has 81 cats and he gives 92 lots of cat food to each cat. So, in total, he gives 92 x 81 = 7320 cat food. Now, we are asked how many cat foods Baker has. Since Baker gets 46 cat foods from Boulanger, Baker has 7320 - 46 = 7274 cat foods.;

Finally, we need to calculate the number of groups of 84 cats each. To do this, we divide the total number of cats by 84, which gives us 10 groups or 10 x 84 = 840 cats. Therefore, the answer to the question is 840 cats.";
Response:  We have 134 cats and 11 dogs. If we give each cat 92 pieces of bread and each dog 140 pieces of bread, how many pieces of bread will be left for the cats if they get 140 pieces of bread too? So, the number of pieces of bread left for the cats is: (140 - 11 x 92) = 680 pieces of bread.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many cats are in total and then divide them into groups of 10 or more. So, we can start with the first part of the question which is ""boulanje te fè 14 gato"". This means there are 14 cats in total. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question ""ak 153 patisri"". This means that among these 14 cats, 153 have been spayed/neutered. Finally, we come to the last part of the question ""si li vann 8 pastè ak 97 gato konbyen"". This means that among the remaining 14 cats (i.e., those who haven't been spayed/neutered), 8 have given birth to kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens born = 8 x 97 = 762. Now, let's calculate the percentage of spayed/neutered cats: Number of spayed/neutered cats = 153 / Total number of cats = 153 / 14 = 11.14% So, approximately 11.14% of the total number of cats have been spayed/neutered.";
"Response:  We have to find out how many cats are in total and then divide them into groups of 43 cats each. So, we can start with the first part of the question which is ""boulanje te fè 43 gato"". This means that there are 43 cats in total. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question ""ak 114 patisri"". This means that there are 114 pieces of food for these 43 cats. Finally, we come to the last part of the question ""si li vann 154 patisri ak 78 gato"". This means that there are 154 more pieces of food available for the remaining 78 cats. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food available for all the cats is 114 + 154 = 268 pieces of food. As for your question about dividing the cats into groups of 43 each, it would be possible if you had 43 cats only. However, since there are actually 78 cats, you cannot divide them equally into groups of 43 each.";
Response:  We know that Kelly has 22 JWET (Joy-Con Wheel Edition) from Nintendo. Each Joy-Con Wheel has 140 degrees of rotation. So, in total, Kelly has 22 x 140 = 3080 degrees of rotation available for her to play games with her Joy-Cons.;

Response:  Firstly, we know that Kelly has 20 JW-G20 speakers from Nintendo and 70 JW-G70 speakers from Sony. Now, let's calculate how many JW-G12 speakers Nintendo can produce with $50 million. We have to divide the amount of money available for production (i.e., $50 million) by the cost price of one JW-G12 speaker ($30). So, the number of JW-G12 speakers Nintendo can produce is: $$ 50,000,000 / $30 = 1,666,667 \text {JW-G12 speakers} $$ Therefore, Nintendo can produce approximately 1,666,667 JW-G12 speakers with $50 million.;
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 JWET points from playing Nintendo games and 132 JWET points from playing Sony games. To find out how many JWET points Sony would give her for a new game, we need to divide the number of JWET points she currently has (46 + 132 = 178) by the number of JWET points required for each Sony game (31). So, Sony would give her approximately 5.79 JWET points for each new game she buys.;
Response:  We know that there are 31 games in the Nintendo library and we want to find out how many matches Kelly can play with Gen 80. To do this, we need to divide the number of games by 6, which is the number of players in each match. So, the answer is:  Number of matches = Total number of games / Number of players per match = 31 games / 6 players = 5.17 matches (round up to 5 matches);
Response:  We have 52 blocks to construct two rows of 17 blocks each. So we need 34 blocks in total for both rows. But we are given that 38 blocks were constructed, so there are 4 extra blocks left over. Therefore, the number of blocks that were not used is 4.;
Response:  We have to make 72 blocks of size 4x4 each (total area = 160 square units). Now we need to divide these blocks into two groups such that each group has the same number of blocks. For example, if we want to divide them equally among two groups, then each group will get 36 blocks (since 72 / 2 = 36). So, the answer is 36 blocks.;
Response:  We have 14 blocks to construct one big block and 11 blocks to construct another big block. So, we need 14 + 11 = 25 blocks in total.;
Response:  We have 58 blocks of Randy and we want to use 27 blocks to construct two different shapes. So, we will have 58 - 27 = 31 extra blocks left over after constructing these two shapes. Now, let's consider each shape separately. For the first shape, we need 53 blocks to cover the entire area. So, we can use all 31 extra blocks to cover the remaining area that is not covered by the first shape. Therefore, the number of blocks left over after constructing the first shape is 0. For the second shape, we also need 53 blocks to cover the entire area. However, since we already used 31 blocks for the first shape, we only have 22 blocks left over to construct this second shape. Thus, there are 22 blocks left over after constructing both shapes.;
Response:  We have 37 blocks for generation and we need to use 33 of them to construct two identical copies of a square with sides of length 10 units each. So, we can use 33/37 = 0.89 blocks for this purpose. Now, let's consider how many blocks are left after using 33 blocks for construction of squares. Therefore, the number of remaining blocks is 37 - 33 = 4 blocks.;
Response:  We have 79 blocks to construct one wall and 82 blocks to construct another wall. So, we need 13 (79 + 82) blocks in total to build both walls.;
Response:  We have 36 blocks to construct a square with sides of length $2$. So we need $\frac{36}{4} = 9$ rows of blocks. Since each row has $4$ blocks, we need $9 \times 4 = 36$ blocks in total. Therefore, the number of blocks needed is $36$.;

Response:  If there are 13 people in one group and they have 8 children between them, then each person has an average of 2.6 children (13 / 8 = 2.6). So, if we assume that this is also true for all groups in the village, then the total number of children born to all villagers would be: Total number of children = Number of groups x Average number of children per group = 8 x 2.6 = 20.8. Therefore, the correct answer is 20.8.;
Response:  If Gen 22 has 10 fingers and each finger is different in length, then we can assume that the total number of fingers is 10 x (different lengths). So if there are 12 lives in Gen 22, then the total number of lives would be 12 x (different lengths) = 64 lives.;
Response:  If we have 19 lives and each life has 7 fields to plant crops, then we can plant 133 crops (19 x 7 = 133).;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the number of students in each class. According to the question, there are 16 classes and 14 teachers. So, the total number of students is 16 x 14 = 228 students. Now, let's find out how many students are in each class. If there are 19 students per class, then the total number of students in all classes is 228 / 19 = 12 classes. Therefore, if there are 19 students per class, there will be 12 classes with 19 students each in the crazy silly school.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of students in Gen 8 and FIM Differan respectively.  For Gen 8, there are 19 students x 5 classes = 95 students.  For FIM Differan, there are 10 students x 3 classes = 30 students.  Now, let's find out how many students are common between both groups.  Among the 95 Gen 8 students, 27 students are also in FIM Differan (since they are from the same school). So, the number of students who are not common is 95 - 27 = 68 students.  Therefore, if all 68 non-common students were to attend Crazy Silly School, the total number of students attending would be 68 + 30 = 98 students.;
Response:  If we have 10 generations of humans and each generation has 11 fewer people than the previous one, then in the last generation ( Generation 10), there will be only 1 person left. So, if we add 13 more people to that last generation, there will be 14 people in total in that generation. Therefore, the answer is 14.;
Response:  If we have 11 generations of people living in a village and each generation has 7 members (on average), then there will be a total of 7 x 11 = 77 people in the village. Now, if we assume that every person in the village lives to be 70 years old (which is a reasonable age for an average lifespan), then there will be a total of 77 x 21 = 1597 years lived by all the people in the village. So, if we divide the total number of years lived by the number of generations, we get 1597 / 11 = 143 years per generation.;
Response:  If there are 8 lives in each of the two schools and they have a total of 14 different lives, then we can calculate as follows: School A has 8 lives x 2 = 16 lives, and School B has 8 lives x 3 = 24 lives. So, the difference between them is 24 - 16 = 8 lives.;
Response:  We have 62 FIM (French International Mathematical Olympiad) problems and 19 Liv (Indian National Mathematics Olympiad) problems. If we compare them, we can see that there are 34 FIM problems with 4 lives each, while there are only 4 Liv problems with 10 lives each. So, if we want to know how many lives Gen pou Li has, we can calculate it as follows: Number of FIM lives = 62 x 4 = 252 Number of Liv lives = 4 x 10 = 40 Therefore, Gen pou Li has 252 + 40 = 292 lives in total.;
Response:  If there are 7 different Pokémon in Generation 8 and each of them has 4 forms, then we have a total of 7 x 4 = 28 different forms in Generation 8. So, if you want to know how many different forms there are in the entire series (including all Generations), you would need to add up the number of forms from each Generation. Therefore, the answer is:  Gen 1 - 30 forms Gen 2 - 30 forms Gen 3 - 30 forms Gen 4 - 30 forms Gen 5 - 30 forms Gen 6 - 30 forms Gen 7 - 30 forms Gen 8 - 28 forms Total number of forms in the entire series = 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 28 = 210 forms.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of lives in both series. In Generation I, there are 15 Pokémon with different numbers of lives. In Generation II (Generation 2), there are 11 Pokémon with different numbers of lives. Therefore, the total number of lives in both generations is:  Total Number of Lives = 15 + 11 = 26 lives. Now, let's consider how many lives each Pokémon has in each generation. For example, Pikachu has three lives in Generation I and four lives in Generation II. So, the total number of lives that Pikachu has across both generations is:  Total Number of Lives for Pikachu = 3 + 4 = 7 lives. Similarly, other Pokémon also have different numbers of lives in each generation. To find out the total number of lives that all the Pokémon have across both generations, we need to add up their individual numbers of lives. Thus, the final answer is:  Total Number of Lives Across Both Generations = 26 x (Number of Pokémon) = 26 x 89 = 2244 lives.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of lives in Generation I and Generation II. In Generation I, there are 15 Pokémon with different evolutionary lines, while in Generation II, there are 10 more Pokémon with different evolutionary lines, making it a total of 25 Pokémon. Now, let's count the number of lives for each Pokémon in both generations separately:  Generation I:  Pikachu (1 life) - Raichu (1 life) - Sandslash (1 life) - Ninetales (1 life) - Jolteon (1 life) - Vaporeon (1 life) - Flareon (1 life) - Espeon (1 life) - Umbreon (1 life) - Leafeon (1 life) - Growlithe (1 life) - Arcanine (1 life) - Paras (1 life) - Venusaur (1 life) - Blastoise (1 life) - Gyarados (1 life) - Dragonite (1 life)  Total number of lives in Generation I = 15 Pokémon x 1 life per Pokémon = 15 lives Generation II:  Cyndaquil (1 life) - Quilava (1 life) - Typhlosion (1 life) - Charmander (1 life) - Charmeleon (1 life) - Charizard (1 life) - Squirtle (1 life) - Wartortle (1 life) - Blastoise (1 life) - Gyarados (1 life) - Dragonite (1 life)  Total number of lives in Generation II = 10 Pokémon x 1 life per Pokémon = 10 lives Now that we have calculated the total number of lives in both Generations, let's find out how many lives are left after evolving all the Pokémon from Generation I into their respective final forms. We will assume that all the Pokémon in Generation I evolve into their final forms without any exceptions.  For example, Pikachu evolves into Raichu, Sandslash evolves into Sandshrew, etc. So, the total number of lives remaining after evolving all Pokémon from Generation I would be: Total number of lives remaining after evol;
Response:  If we have 10 generations of humans with an average lifespan of 70 years each (as in Genesis), and there are 6 different families or tribes mentioned in Leviticus 10-19, then we can calculate how many people were alive during each generation based on these factors. Here is one possible calculation: Generation 1: 10 x 70 = 700 years Total population at end of generation: 700 x 6 = 4200 individuals Generation 2: 70 - 70 = 63 years Total population at end of generation: 63 x 6 = 378 individuals Generation 3: 63 - 63 = 50 years Total population at end of generation: 50 x 6 = 300 individuals Generation 4: 50 - 50 = 40 years Total population at end of generation: 40 x 6 = 240 individuals Generation 5: 40 - 40 = 30 years Total population at end of generation: 30 x 6 = 180 individuals Generation 6: 30 - 30 = 20 years Total population at end of generation: 20 x 6 = 120 individuals At this point, we reach the end of the sixth generation after Adam, which means that there would be approximately 120 individuals alive who could potentially be related to Noah and his family. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes a constant rate of growth and does not take into account other factors such as migration, disease, or environmental changes that may affect population size over time.;
Response:  If we have 8 generations of Pokémon and each generation has 5 different types of Pokémon, then in total there are 8 x 5 = 40 different types of Pokémon. Now, if we take any one Pokémon from Generation 1 and compare it to all the other Pokémon in Generations 2-8, we can see that there are only 16 different types of Pokémon that appear in all 8 generations. So, the answer is 16.;
Response:  If Nan has 7 tickets and she wants to buy something worth $10, then she needs at least 2 tickets for that purpose. So, if she only has 2 tickets left after buying something worth $10, then she will have 5 tickets remaining (7 - 2 = 5).;
Response:  We know that Dave has $12 to spend at the arcade and he wants to buy as many tickets as possible. So, we will try to maximize the number of tickets he can buy with his budget.  Firstly, let's calculate the cost of each ticket in terms of dollars: Ticket Cost = $0.50 per ticket Now, let's find out how many tickets Dave can buy with his budget of $12: Number of Tickets = Budget / Ticket Cost = $12 / $0.50 = 24 tickets Therefore, if Dave spends all of his $12 on tickets, he will be able to buy 24 tickets from the arcade.;

Response:  If Dave has $19 to spend and he wants to buy 7 items that cost $1 each, then he will have $1 left over after buying those 7 items. So, if he spends $12 on something else, he will have $1 left over. Therefore, the answer is $1.;
Response:  If Nan has $13 to spend and she wants to buy 8 items that cost $5 each, then she will have $40 left over after buying those 8 items ($13 x 8 = $92). Now, if she wants to buy another item that costs $18, she won't be able to do so because she doesn't have enough money left ($92 - $18 = $74). So, the answer is $74.;
Response:  We know that Nan has 14 tickets and she gives 2 to Dave. So, Nan now has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. If Dave buys 10 tickets from Nan, then he will have 10 + 2 = 12 tickets in total.;
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the storm (September 9) from the date when the tree was planted (April 14). So, the number of days between these two dates is:

April 14 - September 9 = 150 days

Now, we need to convert this number into years, months, and days. To do this, we divide the number of days by 365 (or 366 in leap years), which gives us the number of years plus the number of months. For example, if we have 150 days, dividing it by 365 gives us approximately 2 years and 4 months. Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Approximately 2 years and 4 months";
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the previous storm (June 6) from the current date (August 13). So, the number of days between these two dates is:

13 - 6 = 7 days

Now, we need to calculate how many times the wind speed exceeded 60 km/h during those 7 days. To do this, we will use the information provided in the question that the wind speed exceeded 60 km/h for 2 days. Therefore, the total number of times the wind speed exceeded 60 km/h during those 7 days is:

2 x 7 = 14

So, the final answer to the question is: The wind speed exceeded 60 km/h for 14 hours during the 7-day period.";
Response:  We have 20 pebbles in total and we take out 4 of them to make a trail. So, there are 16 pebbles left after making the trail.;
Response:  If there are 5 pigeons per tree and we have 10 trees in total, then there are 50 pigeons (5 x 10 = 50). Now, if each pigeon lays 3 eggs per day, then there will be 150 eggs (50 pigeons x 3 eggs/pigeon/day = 150). Finally, if it takes 7 days for an egg to hatch, then after 7 days, there will be 150 baby pigeons (150 eggs x 1 egg/egg/day = 150 baby pigeons). So, the answer is 150.;
Response:  If Haley planted 9 coconuts in her garden before the storm and after the storm she found 5 more coconuts there, then we can calculate the total number of coconuts as follows: Total number of coconuts = Number of coconuts before the storm + Number of coconuts found after the storm Total number of coconuts = 9 + 5 Total number of coconuts = 14;
"Response:  If we have 12 people in a small room (okòmansman) and each person has to stay at least one meter away from each other (pyebwa), then we can calculate the maximum number of people that can fit in the room as follows:

1. Calculate the area of the room: The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of each side. Since we don't know the exact dimensions of the room, let's assume it's a regular square with sides of equal length (s = 1 meter). Therefore, the area of the room is:
A = (1 meter)^2 = 1 square meter
2. Calculate the distance between each person: As you mentioned, each person needs to be at least one meter away from each other. So, if there are 12 people in the room, the minimum distance between any two people is:
d = 1 meter
3. Calculate the total area available for each person: Now, let's divide the total area of the room (from step 1) by the minimum distance between each person (from step 2):
Available area per person = Total area / Minimum distance
= 1 square meter / 1 meter
= 1 square meter
4. Determine the maximum number of people that can fit in the room: Finally, we can determine the maximum number of people that can fit in the room by dividing the total area of the room by the available area per person:
Maximum number of people = Total area / Available area
= 1 square meter / 1 square meter
= 12 people
Therefore, based on the information provided, the maximum number of people that can fit in the room is 12.";
Response:  If we have 10 typhoons and each one destroys 5 houses, then after 3 typhoons, there will be 3 x 5 = 15 destroyed houses in total. But if we add the fact that 2 of those houses belong to Haley, then we subtract 2 from the total number of destroyed houses, leaving us with 15 - 2 = 13 destroyed houses in total. So, the answer is 13.;
Response:  If we have 11 people who want to cross the street and there are already 5 cars passing through, then in total, there will be 16 vehicles (11 people + 5 cars) that need to pass through the intersection.;
Response:  We are given that there are 66 Sak Chak in total and we need to find out how many are in Zoranj's collection if he has collected 28 of them. So, we can start by dividing the total number of Sak Chak by the number of Sak Chak Zoranj has collected:  $66 \div 28 = 2.35$ Sak Chak. Therefore, Zoranj has collected approximately $2.35$ Sak Chak out of the total $66$.;
Response:  If we have 8 Sak Chak (Sak) in our possession and we want to exchange them for 24 Zoranj (Zor), then we will get 3 Zor per Sak Chak. So, if we have 8 Sak Chak, we will receive 3 x 8 = 24 Zor.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 4 years are in 100 years. So we divide 100 by 4 and get 25. Now we multiply 25 by 12 months per year and get 300 months. Finally, we add 300 months to 4 years and get 304 years. Therefore, the answer is 304 years.;
Response:  We are given that there are 38 cows and each cow gives 42 liters of milk per day. So in total, we have: 38 x 42 = 16576 liters of milk per day. Now, let's convert this to kilograms: 16576 / 1000 = 16.576 kg/day. Therefore, the answer is 16.576 kg.;
Response:  We are given that there are 66 Sak Chak in one jar and each Sak Chak weighs 10 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all the Sak Chak in one jar is: 66 x 10 = 660 grams. Now, we are asked to find out how many Zoranj (a unit of weight) are equivalent to 25 Sak Chak. To do this, we divide the weight of 25 Sak Chak by the weight of one Sak Chak: 25 x 10 = 250 grams / 10 = 25 Zoranj. So, if you have 87 jars of Sak Chak, the total weight of all those jars would be: 87 x 660 = 56,200 grams.;
Response:  We are given that there are 8 Sak Chak in Jou and each Sak Chak generates 35 Zoranj. So, we can calculate the total number of Zoranj generated as follows:  Total Number of Zoranj = Number of Sak Chak x Number of Zoranj per Sak Chak  Total Number of Zoranj = 8 x 35  Total Number of Zoranj = 280 Zoranj;
"Response:  We have to find out how many days there are between January 1st and June 30th in a leap year with 57 days in each month. So, we need to calculate the number of days from January 1st to June 30th in this leap year.  To do so, we can use the following calculation:

Days from January 1st to June 30th = (57 x 6) - 1 = 342 days
Now, let's convert this number into weeks:

Weeks from January 1st to June 30th = 342 / 7 = 49 weeks
So, there are 49 weeks from January 1st to June 30th in this leap year. Now, let's calculate the number of days that have passed since January 1st:

Days passed since January 1st = 49 x 7 = 333 days
Finally, we need to subtract the number of days that have passed since January 1st from the total number of days in the leap year to get the number of days left in the year:

Number of days left in the year = 57 x 6 = 342 - 333 = 9 days
Therefore, there are 9 days left in the year after June 30th.";
Response:  We are given that there are 67 cents in one zoranj and 12 zoranjs in one jar. So, if we have 67 cents in one zoranj, then we have 67 x 12 = 804 cents in one jar. Now, we are asked how many sak chak (Haitian currency) we will get if we use 804 cents to buy something. Since there are 100 sak chak in one Haitian gourde, we can convert 804 cents to Haitian gourdes as follows: 804 cents / 100 = 8 Haitian gourdes. Therefore, if we use 804 cents to buy something, we will receive 8 Haitian gourdes in return.;
Response:  We are given that there are 74 cakes and we have to find out how many of them John has bought. So, if John has bought x cakes, then he must have spent at least $x/2 in total. Now, we know that John has spent a total of $71 on cakes, so we can set up the equation: $x/2 = $71. Solving for x, we get: x = $355. Therefore, John has bought 74 - 35 = 39 cakes.;
Response:  We are given that there are 76 items in total and 64 of them were sold. So, we have 12 items left over (76 - 64 = 12). Now, we need to find out how many items were sold at $64 each. To do this, we divide the number of items sold by the price per item: ($64 / 64 = 1). Therefore, 1 item was sold for every $64 spent. Finally, we multiply the number of items sold by the price per item to get the total amount of money made: ($1 x $64 = $64). So, the total amount of money made is $64.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 28 zoranj fit in 52 zoranj. To do this, we divide 52 by 28: 52 / 28 = 1.9230769230769231. So, approximately 1.92 zoranj of the first group can fit in 1 zoranj of the second group. Now, let's calculate how many zoranj are left after dividing the remaining zoranj by that number: (52 - 1.92) / 1.92 = 26.45. Therefore, there will be approximately 26 zoranj left after dividing the remaining zoranj by the number of zoranj that can fit in one group.;
Response:  We have to find out how many sacks of rice are needed for each group of people and then calculate the total number of sacks required.  For example, if we want to distribute 82 sacks of rice among 61 people, each person will get 13/4 sack (since there are 4 people in each group). So, we need 82 / 4 = 20 sacks of rice to feed all these groups of people. Now let's calculate the remaining amount of rice that is left over after distributing it equally among all the groups. To do this, we subtract the number of sacks distributed from the total number of sacks available: 82 - 20 = 62 sacks of rice remain unsold or leftover. Therefore, the answer to the question is 62 sacks of rice.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 31 days are in 45 years. So we divide 45 by 31 and get 1.496 (rounded). Now let's calculate how many months there are in that number of years. We multiply 1.496 by 12 and get 180.72 (rounded). Finally, we subtract the number of months that are not leap years from the total number of months to get the average number of days in a non-leap year. Therefore, the answer is approximately 365.35 days per year.;
Response:  We have 44 students who are good at math and 25 students who are not so good at it. If we divide the total number of students into two groups based on their math skills, then the ratio of good to bad students would be 44/69 or 1:1.57. So, approximately 1 out of every 1.57 students is good at math.;
Response:  We have 5 Sak Zoranj that are completely mature and ready to harvest (matirite), and we want to know how many Sak Zoranj will be fully matured in 74 days if they start maturing at the same rate as the ones that are already mature (chak jou). So, we can calculate the number of Sak Zoranj that will be fully matured in 74 days using the following formula: Number of Sak Zoranj = Total number of Sak Zoranj x Rate of maturation / Time taken to mature In this case, the total number of Sak Zoranj is 50, and the rate of maturation is 1/5 per day (since it takes 1 day for 1/5 of the Sak Zoranj to become mature). Therefore, the number of Sak Zoranj that will be fully matured in 74 days is: Number of Sak Zoranj = 50 x (1/5) / 74 = 26.67 Sak Zoranj will be fully matured in 74 days.;
Response:  If you have 54 zoranjs and you give away 18 of them, then you will have 36 zoranjs left (54 - 18 = 36).;
Response:  We are given that there are 56 zoranj in total and we want to know how many zoranj John has. So, if John has x zoranj, then he has 56 - x zoranj. Now, we are also given that John has 14 zoranj more than Jean. So, if Jean has y zoranj, then John has 14 + y zoranj. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 56 - x = 14 + y. Solving for x, we get: x = 42. So, John has 42 zoranj.;
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice are needed for 25 bags that will be sold and 5 bags that will be kept in stock. So we need 20 bags of rice (25 - 5 = 20). Now, if we sell 73 bags after 1 week, then we will have 73 / 20 = 3.65 bags left over after 1 week.;
Response:  We have 65 apples that are not yet ripe and 46 apples that are already ripe. If we want to know how many apples will be ready in 6 days, we can calculate as follows: Number of apples that will be ready = Total number of apples x Rate at which they will be ready per day Number of apples that will be ready = 65 + (46 x 6) / 7 = 65 + (6 x 46) / 7 = 65 + 308 / 7 = 383 / 7 = 54.6 apple;
Response:  We have 41 Sak Zoranj (SZ) that are not yet mature and need to be harvested, while we have 86 SZ that are already mature and can be sold. If we want to maximize our profit, we should sell the mature SZ first because they will bring more money. So, the number of SZ that we should keep for further cultivation is 41 - 86 = 45 SZ.;
Response:  We have 71 Sak Zoranj that are not yet finished and need to be delivered within 60 days. If we deliver 50% of them in one day (chak jou), then we will have 35.5 Sak Zoranj left to deliver (71 - 50 = 35.5).;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between two dates. We can do this by subtracting one date from another date in days. So, if we take the first date as January 1st and the second date as December 31st of the same year, then the difference between these two dates is 365 days. Now, let's come back to the original question. The length of a year is 365 days, so we can say that Jesse has been playing for 12 years. Therefore, the number of days he has played is equal to 12 x 365 = 43800 days.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse is 7 years old. Now, if he has been playing for 14 years, then he must have started playing when he was 7 - 14 = 7 years old. So, Jesse started playing cricket at the age of 7.;
Response:  If Jesse has 7 pieces of candy and he gives one to each of his friends, how many candies will he have left after giving away all 7 pieces? So, Jesse will have 7 - 7 = 0 candies left.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many days are there between Jesse and his friend who lives in Tapachena. We know that Jesse is 11 years old and his friend lives in Tapachena which is 15 years away from their current location. So, if they travel at a constant speed of 40 km/h, it will take them approximately 38 hours to reach Tapachena. Now, let's assume that they start their journey on Monday morning at 9 am. Therefore, they will arrive in Tapachena on Wednesday evening at around 7 pm (considering they travel non-stop). As for the second part of the question, since Jesse reaches Tapachena on Wednesday evening, he has spent 2 nights in Tapachena before returning back home on Thursday morning at 9 am.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in 3 months. As we know that each month has 30 days, so total number of days in 3 months is: 3 x 30 = 90 days. Now, we need to calculate how much time will pass if Jesse takes 2 years to complete his project. We know that one year consists of 365 days, so two years consist of: 2 x 365 = 730 days. Therefore, the total time taken by Jesse to complete his project is: 90 days + 730 days = 820 days. Finally, we need to convert this time into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so: 820 days x 24 hours/day = 19,360 hours.;
Response:  If Jesse has 19 years and he is currently 18 years old, then in 1 year, he will be 19 years old. So, if it takes him 1 year to cover all the mountains in Konbit, then he will need 20 years to cover all the mountains in Konbit plus himself (since he needs 1 year to cover his own age). Therefore, Jesse will take 20 years to cover all the mountains in Konbit including himself.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 people in the group and they have to walk for 20 hours straight. So, each person has to walk for approximately 1 hour and 46 minutes (20/19).;
Response:  We have 10 apples and we want to divide them equally among 5 people. So each person will get 2 apples (10/5=2).;
Response:  We have 10 apples and we want to divide them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 2 apples (10/4=2).;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in 3 months. As we know that each month has 30 days, so total number of days in 3 months is: 3 x 30 = 90 days. Now, we have to calculate how much time will pass if we subtract 4 days from 90 days. So, the answer is: 90 - 4 = 86 days.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of one T-shirt is $23. So if they want to buy 10 T-shirts, the total cost will be $23 x 10 = $230. Therefore, the answer is $230.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of one razorback lace. According to the question, it costs $51 per dollar. So, the cost of one razorback lace is $51. Now, let's find out how many razorback laces can be bought with $51. We know that three chemiz pandans match Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, the total amount spent on buying razorback laces for these matches is $51 x 3 = $153. Hence, the number of razorback laces that can be bought with $51 is $153 / $51 = 3.;
Response:  We know that the sum of the scores for both teams is 95 (Arkansas + Texas Tech).  If we subtract the score of Arkansas from the total score, we get:  Total score - Arkansas score = 95 - 47 = 48. So, if you won 47 points in the match against Arkansas, and you scored a total of 95 points overall, then you would have scored 48 points in the match against Texas Tech.;
Response:  We know that the total number of chemists in both teams is 242. If Arkansas has 115 chemists and Texas Tech has 127 chemists, then we can calculate the difference between them as follows:  Difference = Total number of chemists in Texas Tech - Total number of chemists in Arkansas  Difference = 127 - 115  Difference = 12  Therefore, if Arkansas has 115 chemists and Texas Tech has 127 chemists, then the difference between them is 12.;
Response:  We know that there are 163 chemical reactions in total. If we win 89 of them, which is half of the total number, then we can calculate the percentage of winning as follows: Percentage = (Number of won reactions / Total number of reactions) x 100 So, if we win 89 chemical reactions out of 163, the percentage of winning would be: Percentage = (89/163) x 100 = 54% Therefore, if you win 89 chemical reactions against Arkansas and match Texas Tech, you will have won 54% of the total chemical reactions.;
Response:  We know that there are 186 chemists in total (172 from Arkansas + 14 from Texas Tech). If we subtract the number of chemists from Arkansas (172) from the total number of chemists (186), we get: 186 - 172 = 14. So, there are 14 chemists from Texas Tech.;
Response:  The price of the Razorback Fitted Hat is $62, and that of the Jersey is $99. So, if you buy both together, it will cost you $62 + $99 = $161. Therefore, the difference between the total cost of buying both items separately and the cost of buying them together is $161 - ($62 + $99) = $68.;
Response:  The cost of one Razorback F$ 67 dollar shirt is equal to 0.8 times the cost of one Razorback jersey which costs $ 165 dollars. So if we want to buy both items together, we can calculate it as follows:  Cost of one Razorback F$ 67 dollar shirt = 0.8 x Cost of one Razorback jersey = $ 130. Therefore, you would have to pay $ 130 for both items.;
Response:  We know that Boutik La Razorback sells t-shirts for $ 192 dollars and jerseys for $ 34 dollars. So if we want to buy both a t-shirt and a jersey, the total cost will be: $ 192 + $ 34 = $ 226. Therefore, the difference between the cost of the t-shirt and the cost of the jersey is: $ 226 - $ 34 = $ 192.;
Response:  We know that the cost of one Razorback F$ 86 dollars and the cost of one jersey is $ 232. So if we want to buy both items together, we will have to pay a total amount of $ 86 + $ 232 = $ 318. Therefore, the difference between the price of the jersey and the price of the T-shirt is $ 232 - $ 86 = $ 146.;
Response:  We know that the cost of one razor is $51 and we have to buy 130 razors. So, the total cost will be:  $51 x 130 = $6,330.;
Response:  We know that the total amount of money spent on razors is $201 and we want to find out how much each razor cost. So, let's divide the total amount of money spent on razors by the number of razors bought: $201 / 14 = $14 per razor. Therefore, each razor costs $14.;
Response:  We know that Pandan has $60 to spend at either Arkansas or Texas Tech bookstore. If he spends all of it at Arkansas Bookstore, then he will have $40 left over after buying something worth $60. Now, if he spends $10 from his remaining $40 at Conway Bookstore, then he will have $30 left over after buying something worth $50. So, the amount he will have left after buying something worth $60 is $30.;
Response:  We are given that Pandan has 5 chemicals and he wants to sell them for $215 each. So, we can calculate the total amount of money Pandan will make from selling all 5 chemicals as follows: Total Amount = Number of Chemicals x Price per Chemical Total Amount = 5 x $215 Total Amount = $1,075 Now, let's check if this calculation makes sense based on the information provided in the question. According to the question, Pandan is from Arkansas and he is going to Texas Tech University. The distance between Fayetteville, AR (where Arkansas is located) and Lubbock, TX (where Texas Tech University is located) is approximately 648 miles. Based on Google Maps, the driving time from Fayetteville to Lubbock is around 9 hours and 30 minutes. Given these distances and travel times, it seems unlikely that Pandan could sell all 5 chemicals within such a short period of time, especially since he needs to drive to Texas Tech University to do so. Therefore, the answer to the question is $0.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Boutik La Razorback is selling a jersey for $50 and a t-shirt for $215. Now, let's calculate how much money they are making from each item. For the jersey, they are making $50 x 64 = $3200 in profit. And for the t-shirt, they are making $215 x 20 = $4300 in profit. So, altogether, they are making $7500 in profit from these two items.;
Response:  We know that Boutik La Razorback sells t-shirts for $204 and jerseys for $76. So if we want to find out how much it costs to buy both a t-shirt and a jersey from Boutik La Razorback, we can simply add the prices of the two items together: $204 + $76 = $280. Therefore, the total cost of buying both a t-shirt and a jersey from Boutik La Razorback is $280.;
Response:  We know that Boutik La Razorback is selling a jersey for $240 and a t-shirt for $210. So if we want to buy both items together, the total cost would be $240 + $210 = $450. Therefore, the difference between the cost of the jersey and the cost of the t-shirt is $450 - $210 = $240.;
Response:  The cost of one Razorback Fitted Jersey is $ 115 dollars and the cost of one T-Shirt is $ 25 dollars. So if we want to buy both items together, we will have to pay a total amount of : $ 115 + $ 25 = $ 140 dollars. Therefore, the difference between the price of the jersey and the t-shirt is : $ 140 - $ 25 = $ 115 dollars.;
Response:  If you have 5 serious tabs and each tab has 10 cheese pieces, then in total, you will have 5 x 10 = 50 cheese pieces.;
Response:  We have to calculate the number of pieces for each type of food and then add them up.  For example, if we want to know how many pieces of rice are needed for 10 people, we can multiply 10 by the number of servings per person (which is assumed to be 2 in this case). So, if we need 2 servings of rice per person, we would need 2 x 10 = 20 pieces of rice in total. Similarly, if we want to know how many pieces of meat are needed for 10 people, we can multiply 10 by the number of servings per person (which is also assumed to be 2 in this case). So, if we need 2 servings of meat per person, we would need 2 x 10 = 20 pieces of meat in total. Now, let's apply these calculations to the problem at hand. If we want to know how many pieces of food are needed for 12 people, we can use the same logic as before. So, if we assume that each person needs 2 servings of food per meal, we would need 2 x 12 = 24 servings of food in total. And since there are 4 types of food (rice, meat, vegetables, and fruit), we would need 24 / 4 = 6 pieces of each type of food. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food needed for 12 people would be 6 x 4 = 24 pieces of food in total.;
Response:  If you have to decide how much money to give to each of the three people you know, and if you want to give a total of $9 to them, then we can calculate it as follows:  For Person 1: $9 / 3 = $3 per person (since there are 3 people)  For Person 2: $9 / 3 = $3 per person (again, since there are 3 people)  For Person 3: $9 / 3 = $3 per person (one more time!) So, in total, you will give $3 + $3 + $3 = $9 to all three people.;
Response:  If you have 11 serious tabs and each of them can generate 10 serious chaks, then in total, you will have 11 x 10 = 110 serious chaks generated from those tabs. However, if you also consider the additional 2 chaks that are generated for every serious tab, then the total number of chaks generated would be 11 x 12 = 132 chaks. So, the final answer is 132 chaks.;
Response:  If we have 10 series of 6 chairs each, then we will have 60 chairs in total. Now, if 11 people are sitting at the conference room and there are only 60 chairs available, then some people will not be able to sit. So, the number of people who cannot sit is equal to the difference between the total number of chairs and the number of people who can sit, which is 60 - 11 = 49 people.;
"Response:  First, we have to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event. In this case, we have:
Date of first event = January 1st, 2023 (seri 1)
Date of second event = February 15th, 2023 (seri 14)
Subtracting the two dates gives us:
Number of days between the two events = 45 days
Now, we need to convert these days into weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we can divide the number of days by 7 to get the number of weeks:
Number of weeks = Number of days / 7
In this case, we have:
Number of weeks = 45 days / 7 = 6 weeks and 1 day
Therefore, the answer is 6 weeks and 1 day.";
Response:  We have to calculate the number of people who will attend the party at Konbyen plus those who will attend the party in other places. So we need to add 4 and 3 which gives us 7. Therefore, there are 7 + 14 = 21 people attending the party altogether.;
Response:  If you have 14 children and each child has 9 siblings, then the total number of children in your family is: 14 x 9 = 126.;
Response:  If Lewis touches a total of $460 dolphins in 5 seconds, he will touch each dolphin for how long?  Therefore, the time taken to touch each dolphin is $\frac{460}{5} = \boxed{92}$ seconds.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis touched a total of $1216 and then he gave $16 to someone else. So, the amount left with Lewis is $1216 - $16 = $1190.;
Response:  We know that Lewis touched $ 21 and gave it to Pandan for $ 216. So he got back $ 702 after selling the season tickets. Therefore, his profit is $ 702 - $ 21 = $ 681.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis touched $ 1357 and then he gave some of it to Pandan. We are not told how much he gave him but we do know that Pandan received 223 semen. So, if Lewis had 73 seasons worth of rice, and he gave some of it to Pandan, then we can calculate how many seasons worth of rice he has left. To do this, we need to divide the number of seasons worth of rice he had before giving any to Pandan (which is 73) by the number of seasons worth of rice he gave to Pandan (which is 223). This gives us a ratio of 73/223 = 0.314 or approximately 31.4%. Therefore, Lewis has approximately 31.4% of his original 73 seasons worth of rice left after giving some to Pandan.;
Response:  We know that Lewis touched 28 chak semen and collected 1091 seeds from them. If he touched each seed with his tongue for 5 seconds, then he spent 939 dolas (dollars) to travel to the place where he could collect those seeds. So if we calculate how much time he spent collecting one season of seeds, it would be equal to 939/5 = 187.6 secs.;
Response:  We know that Lewis touched 233 seeds of pandan and he received $ 49 for each seed. So, in total, he received $ 10,798 (233 x $ 49). Now, we need to find out how much money Lewis would have if he had touched all the 403 seeds of pandan. Therefore, we multiply the number of seeds he actually touched with the amount he received per seed: $ 10,798 x 403 = $ 4,356,470.;
Response:  We know that Lewis touched $ 368 and gave it to Pandan for seasoning. Then he got back $ 388 from Pandan. So, we can calculate the amount of money that Pandan made as follows:  Amount of money made by Pandan = $ 388 - $ 368 = $ 20. Therefore, the answer is $ 20.;
Response:  We know that Lewis touched 491 pieces of sand and collected 1181 pieces of sand in total. If he picked up 216 dolas (a unit of measurement) worth of sand per season, then we can calculate how many seasons it took him to collect all those sand as follows: Number of seasons = Total amount of sand / Amount of sand picked up per season = 1181 / 216 = 5.37 seasons So, it took Lewis approximately 5.37 seasons to collect all the sand he touched.;
Response:  We know that Pandan has 19 seeds and each seed produces 4 offspring (Lewis touched). So, in total, we have 19 x 4 = 76 offspring produced by Pandan's seeds.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis touched 2 dolas and got 200 dollars from each of them. So, he got a total of 400 dollars from both dolas. Then, he gave 100 dollars to Pandan as his share. Therefore, Lewis has 300 dollars left with him. Now, if he touches another 2 dolas and gets 200 dollars from each of them, he will have a total of 600 dollars after getting 100 dollars from the second set of dolas. So, the amount of money Lewis has after touching the second set of dolas is 500 dollars (300 + 200). Finally, he gives 100 dollars to Rokot as his share, leaving him with 400 dollars. Thus, the answer is 400 dollars.;
Response:  If we have $10 to spend at the store and there are 9 products in total that cost $5 each, how much will it cost us if we buy all of them? So, the total cost would be $5 x 9 = $45. Therefore, we will have $10 - $45 = -$35 left after buying all the products.;
Response:  If we have $20 and we want to buy two items that cost $10 each, then we will have $20 - $20 = $0 left after buying both items. So, the answer is zero (0).;
Response:  We have 5 apples in front of Ron and he gives one to Dean. So now we have 4 apples left with Ron. If Ron can keep 12 apples for himself, then how many apples will be left with him after giving one to Dean? Therefore, the answer is 4 apples.;
Response:  We have 15 apples and we want to share them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 3.75 apples (15 / 4 = 3.75). Now let's say that Dean has already eaten one apple, so he has 2 left. If Ron can eat only 13 pieces of fruit in total, then he will eat 13/4 = 3.25 pieces of fruit (not including the apple that Dean already ate).;
Response:  We are given that there are 16 feet in a yard and we want to know how many yards Ron can jump.  If Dean can jump 9 feet high, then Ron can jump at least 13 times as far as Dean since he is older than Dean. So, Ron can jump 13 x 9 = 117 feet high.;
Response:  We have 9 frogs (fwa) and we want to know how many will be left after one frog jumps over the well (dlo). If each frog can jump over the well 6 times, then after one frog has jumped over the well, there will be 9 - 1 = 8 frogs remaining. So, after all 9 frogs have jumped over the well once, there will be 8 \* 9 = 72 frogs remaining.;
Response:  We have to distribute 34 people equally among two floors of a building with 10 rooms per floor. So we need to divide 34 by 2 and get 17 as our quotient. Now, since each room has 5 beds (as mentioned in the question), we can divide 17 by 5 to get the number of people who will be accommodated in each room, which is 3. Therefore, there will be 3 people in each of the 10 rooms on the first floor and 3 people in each of the 10 rooms on the second floor.;
Response:  We have 42 lives in total and we want to know how many are living in each of the two areas (Kebetew and Konoby). So, let's divide the total number of lives by 2: Total lives = 42 / 2 = 21 lives living in Kebetew and 21 lives living in Konoby.;
Response:  We have to calculate how many lives are in each magazine and then add them up.  For example, if we look at the first magazine, it has 27 lives inside of it. So, we multiply that number by 10 (since there are 10 questions) and get 270 lives from that one magazine alone! Then, when we move on to the next magazine with 80 lives inside of it, we multiply that number by 10 as well and get 800 more lives added onto our total count. Finally, after adding all ten magazines together,we come out with an overall total of 2650 lives!;
Response:  We have 9 lives in one bag and 46 bags in the entire store. So, we need to calculate how many lives are in all the bags together. To do this, we multiply the number of lives per bag (9) by the number of bags (46). Therefore, the total number of lives in all the bags is 9 x 46 = 424 lives.;
Response:  We have to calculate how many lives are in each group and then add them up.  For Group A, there are 23 lives in 61 magazines, so there are 23/61 = 0.37 lives per magazine.  For Group B, there are 61 lives in 29 magazines, so there are 61/29 = 0.21 lives per magazine.  Therefore, the total number of lives is (0.37 x 61) + (0.21 x 29) = 21 + 5.89 = 26.89 lives.;
"Response:  We have 7 stages of life and each stage has a different number of years. Here are the stages with their corresponding numbers of years:

3. Adolescence (11-17 years) - 7 etajès
4. Young adulthood (18-35 years) - 9 etajès
5. Middle age (36-60 years) - 10 etajès
6. Old age (61-75 years) - 9 etajès
7. Very old age (76+ years) - 7 etajès
So, in total, there are 28 etajès of life.";
Response:  We have 40 lives in total (38 + 2). So if we want to distribute them equally among 5 people, each person will get 8 lives (40 / 5 = 8).;
Response:  If Carole has 10 friends and she buys each friend one ticket for $50, then she will spend a total of $500. So, if she wants to buy two more tickets for her other friends, she will have to spend an additional $100, making it a total cost of $600.;
Response:  We have 12 friends who want to go on vacation together. Each friend wants to bring 3 family members along with them. So, in total, we need to find out how many people can fit in one vacation spot. To do this, we divide 12 (the number of friends) by 3 (the number of family members each friend brings). Therefore, the maximum number of people that can fit in one vacation spot is 12 / 3 = 4.;
Response:  We have 4 zanmi (Carol, Marie, Jean, and Pierre) who want to go on vacation together. They can choose from 10 different vacation spots, and each spot has a cost of $700 per person. So, if they all decide to go on vacation together, the total cost would be:  $700 x 4 = $2800.;
Response:  We know that Carol has 14 invitations to give away and she gives 6 of them to her friend. So, she now has 11 invitations left. Therefore, the number of people that Carol can invite is 11.;
Response:  We have 4 people who want to go to the beach and they can choose from 3 different beaches. Each person can choose either 1 or 2 of these beaches. So, in total, we have 4 x 3 = 12 possible combinations. Now, let's assume that each combination has 9 people going to the beach. Therefore, the total number of people going to the beach is 12 x 9 = 108.;
Response:  If Melissa has 12 points in each of the 4 matches, then she will have a total of 48 points from all 4 matches. So, if she wins 36 points in the championship match, her final score would be 48 + 36 = 84 points.;
Response:  We have 3 matches and each match has 4 points. So, we multiply 3 x 4 = 12 points for all three matches combined. Now, let's subtract the number of points scored in one match (81) from the total number of points available (12 x 3 = 36). Therefore, there are 36 - 81 = -45 points left over after the first match.  Now, we repeat this process for the second and third matches, multiplying the number of matches by the number of points available per match, and then subtracting the number of points scored in each match from the total number of points available. Finally, we add up all these negative numbers to get the total number of points left over after all three matches. So, the answer is: -45 + (-45) + (-45) = -135 points.;
Response:  We know that Melissa has 109 points in total and she got 82 points as bonus. So, her new score is 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now, we need to find out how many points Li has scored in the game. According to the question, Li scored 79 points. Therefore, the final answer is 191 - 79 = 112 points.;
Response:  We have 21 balls in total and we need to find out how many of them are not matching with each other. So, if we take 7 balls at random from the remaining 14 balls, then the probability that they do not match is (14 - 7) / 14 = 0.56. Therefore, there are approximately 0.56 or 56% of the remaining balls that do not match.;
Response:  We have 91 points in total for 13 matches played so far. If we divide this number by the number of matches played (13), we get an average score per match of 7 points (91/13 = 7).;
Response:  We have 20 mountains and each mountain has 10 meters of height. So, we need to calculate the total height of all the mountains which is equal to 20 x 10 = 200 meters.;
Response:  We have to find out how many people can fit in one row of seats in the park and then calculate how many rows are needed for all 18 people to sit together.  So let's assume that each row can accommodate 3 people comfortably. Therefore, we need to divide 18 by 3 to get the number of rows required.  Thus, there will be 6 rows of seats in total (i.e., 18 / 3 = 6). Now, since each row has space for 3 people, we can see that 6 x 3 = 18 people can sit in the park altogether.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many times 19 goes into 15. We know that 19 x 1 = 19 and 19 x 2 = 38, so 19 goes into 15 exactly 2 times. Therefore, there are 2 Ferris wheels in total. Now let's count how many people are on each Ferris wheel. If there are 20 people on one Ferris wheel, then there are 40 people in total (2 x 20).;
Response:  We have to find out how many meters are between two points in space. In this case, we need to calculate the distance from point A (18° north latitude) to point B (15° south latitude). To do this, we can use the Haversine formula, which gives us the distance between two points on a sphere (like Earth) based on their longitudes. The formula is as follows: Distance = sin(lat1) \* sin(lat2) \* cos(lon1) \* cos(lon2) \* 6371 Where lat1 and lon1 represent the coordinates of point A, and lat2 and lon2 represent the coordinates of point B. Using these values, we get: Distance = sin(18°) \* sin(-15°) \* cos(180°) \* cos(-90°) \* 6371 ≈ 4350 km So there are approximately 4350 kilometers between point A and point B.;
Response:  If we have 6 plants and each plant produces 14 fruits, then in total, we will have 6 x 14 = 84 fruits. Now, if we want to know how many fruits WOULD A NAN PARADISE PARK GENERATE IN 16 MONTHS, we need to multiply the number of fruits produced per month by 16 months. So, 84 fruits x 16 months = 13024 fruits.;
Response:  We have 23 people going to the park and each person has 5 friends (on average). So, we have 23 x 5 = 115 people in total who will be at the park. Now, let's calculate how many people will be there if all of them bring their parents along. Since there are 14 adults among the 23 people going to the park, each parent will be accompanied by an adult. Therefore, the number of parents accompanying children is 14 / 2 = 7. So, the total number of people at the park including both children and parents is 115 + 7 = 122 people.;
Response:  We have 7 children and we want to divide them equally among 12 adults. So each adult will get 7/12 of the total number of children, which is 7 x 12 = 84 children. Now let's calculate how many children each adult will get: 84 / 12 = 7 children per adult. Therefore, there are 7 children per adult.;
Response:  We have 16 mountains and we want to know how many mountains are visible from one point in Menm Tan An. So, if we divide 16 by 4 (the number of directions), we get 4. Therefore, there are 4 mountains that can be seen from each point in Menm Tan An.;
Response:  We have 4 mountains and we want to know how many people can fit on each mountain. So, if we divide 4 by 2, we get 2. Therefore, 2 people can fit on each of the 4 mountains.;
Response:  We have 7 pits of different sizes and we want to know how many cubic meters of sand are in all the pits together. If each pit contains 30 cubic meters of sand, then the total volume of sand in all the pits is:  Volume = Length x Width x Height = 7 x 5 x 3 = 110 cubic meters. So there are 110 cubic meters of sand in all the pits.;
Response:  We have 3 pizzas with different toppings and each pizza has 14 slices. So, we need to calculate how many slices of pizza are there in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza. Therefore, the total number of slices of pizza is: 3 x 14 = 42 slices.;
Response:  We have to calculate how many pits are in each trench and then add them up.  In Trench 1, there are 17 pits, so we can write this as 17 x 4 = 68 pits in all four trenches combined. Therefore, the total number of pits is 68.;
Response:  We have 9 pits and we want to divide them equally among 10 trenches. So each trench will get 1 pit. Now let's assume that there are 2 nans (or none) in one of the trenches. In this case, the remaining 8 trenches will share 7 pits, which means each trench will get 7/8 of a pit. Therefore, the distribution is not equal.;
Response:  We have to plant 10 flowers in each of the 45 flower beds. So, we will need to plant 10 x 45 = 450 flowers altogether.;
Response:  We have 45 green beans in total and we want to know how many green beans will fit in a basket with a capacity of 9 plants. So, if we divide 45 by 9, we get 5. So, approximately 5 green beans can fit in that basket.;
Response:  We have 36 green beans and we want to divide them equally among 5 people. So each person will get 7 green beans (36 / 5 = 7). Now let's say that one of the people has already taken 12 green beans from the pot, leaving 44 green beans for the remaining 4 people. Each of these 4 people will now get 11 green beans (44 / 4 = 11), since they are sharing the remaining amount equally. Therefore, the total number of green beans that Konbyen has is 11 + 7 = 18 green beans.;
Response:  We know that we have to plant 55 green beans in a row and then add 15 more green beans in the middle of the row. So, the total number of green beans we will plant is 70 (55 + 15). Now, let's calculate how many rows of green beans we can make with these 70 green beans. To do this, we divide the total number of green beans by the number of green beans in each row, which is 60 (since there are 60 green beans in the picture). Therefore, we can make 1.17 rows of green beans (70 / 60 = 1.17).;
Response:  If we have 10 green beans in one pot and we plant 60 green beans altogether in the entire field, then we can calculate the number of pots needed as follows: Number of pots = Total number of green beans / Number of green beans in one pot So, Number of pots = 60 green beans / 10 green beans per pot = 6 pots Therefore, if we have 10 green beans in one pot, we will need 6 pots to plant all 60 green beans altogether in the entire field.;
Response:  We have to find out how many green beans are in each row of the garden and then multiply it with the number of rows to get the total number of green beans in the garden.  So, let's count the number of green beans in each row first.  There are 8 plants in each row, and each plant has 4 green beans. Therefore, there are 8 x 4 = 32 green beans in each row. Now we need to find out how many rows are there in the entire garden. According to the question, there are 32 green beans in each row, and we want to know how many rows are there in the entire garden. So, if we divide the total number of green beans (32 x 8) by the number of green beans in each row (32), we will get the number of rows in the entire garden. That is, 32 x 8 / 32 = 8 rows. Therefore, there are 8 rows in the entire garden, and there are 32 green beans in each row.;

Now he has 12 crackers left (Matthew toujou gen 12 krakè). He wants to share these crackers equally among 5 friends (Matthew want to share krakè chak zanmi manje). To do this, we need to divide the number of crackers he has left by the number of friends he wants to share them with: 12 crackers / 5 friends = 2.4 crackers per friend (krakè pou 5 zanmi l yo epi li toujou gen 2.4 krakè).;
"Response:  We have to find out how many times ""krakét"" appears in Matthew's speech.  Firstly, we know that Matthew says ""krakét"" 24 times. Now, let's count how many times ""krakét"" appears after each of his statements:

Response:  We know that Matthew has 22 cats and he wants to give 34 of them away. So, if we subtract the number of cats he wants to give away (34) from the total number of cats he has (22), we get: 22 - 34 = -12. Therefore, Matthew will have -12 cats left after giving away 34 cats.;
Response:  If Matthew has 29 cats and he wants to give 30 of them away as gifts, then he will have 6 (29 - 30) cats left for himself.;
Response:  If Matthew has 14 cats and he gives 2 to his friend, then Matthew has 14 - 2 = 12 cats left. Now, if each of those 12 cats can have 7 friends (on average), then Matthew's total number of friends is 12 x 7 = 84 friends.;
Response:  We are given that there are 18 friends and each friend has 36 children. So, in total, we have: 18 x 36 = 648 children.;

Response:  We have 23 crows (krak) and we want to know how many babies they can produce in one year. According to the information provided, each crow can lay 5 eggs per year. So, if we multiply 23 crows by 5 eggs per year, we get 115 eggs per year. Now, let's calculate how many baby crows these eggs will hatch. Each egg will hatch into 1-2 baby crows, depending on various factors such as food availability and predator presence. So, assuming an average of 1.5 baby crows per egg, we get 170-249 baby crows born in one year. Therefore, the answer is between 170 and 249 baby crows.;
Response:  We have to find out how many friends Matthew has in total and then divide it by 5 to get the number of friends he has with each one of them. So, let's calculate: Total number of friends = 31 + 23 = 54 Friends per person = 54 / 5 = 10 Therefore, Matthew has 10 friends in total.;
Response:  We have 4 zanmi (friends) and each friend has 98 cats. So, in total we have 4 x 98 = 384 cats. Now, let's calculate how many cats are there in one place (konbyen).

Response:  We have 4 zanmi (friends) and each friend has 10 cats. So, we have 4 x 10 = 40 cats in total. Now, there are 8 goatmen living in the village. If each goatman can feed 5 cats per day, then they will need to feed 8 goatmen x 5 cats/day = 40 cats per day. Therefore, the villagers will need to buy 40 cats per day from the market.;
Response:  We have 28 friends who want to play with us and we have 13 balls. If each friend plays with one ball, then there will be 13 balls left over for other activities or games. So, if 15 more people join us later, they will not have any balls to play with. Therefore, the total number of balls available for all players is 13 + 0 = 13.;
Response:  We are given that Debbie bought 109 pairs of shoes and she paid $74 for them. So, we can calculate the cost per pair as follows: Cost per pair = Total cost / Number of pairs = $74 / 109 = $0.68 per pair.;
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 153 pairs of shoes for $20 each. So, in total, she spent $3,060 (153 x $20). Now, we are asked how many times $3,060 can be divided by 17. To do this, we divide $3,060 by 17: $3,060 / 17 = 184. Therefore, there are 184 pairs of shoes that Debbie has left after selling 17 pairs.;
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 264 boutiques for $10 each. So she spent a total of $2640. If she gave you 15 boutiques out of the 264 she bought, then she has 249 boutiques left. Therefore, the number of boutiques she has after giving you some is 249.;
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 301 bunches of bananas and she gave 144 bunches to her friend. So, we have 301 - 144 = 157 bunches left with Debbie.;
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 88 bottles of rum and 13 bottles of soda. If she gave you 4 bottles of rum and 87 bottles of soda, then you have 4 + 87 = 91 bottles in total.;
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 200 bottles of rum and 256 bottles of soda. If she gave you 312 bottles of rum and 4 bottles of soda, then we can calculate how many bottles of soda she had left. So, if she had 256 bottles of soda initially and gave you 312 bottles, then she has 312 - 256 = 56 bottles of soda left.;
Response:  If Debbie has 6 boutiques and she buys 12 boutiques from someone else, then the total number of boutiques that Debbie now owns is: 6 + 12 = 18 boutiques.;
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of rum at $18 each. So she spent a total of $3270. Now we are asked how many bottles of rum YOU would buy if you had $15 to spend and there were 54 bottles of rum available for sale at $3 each. To find out, we can divide $15 by $3, which gives us 5 bottles of rum that you could buy with your $15.;
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of rum. If she had 122 bottles of soda left after giving some away, then she must have given away 148 bottles of soda (360 - 122 = 148). So, out of the remaining 122 bottles of soda, she gave away 9 bottles of soda (148 / 16 = 9). Therefore, Debbie has 113 bottles of soda left (122 - 9 = 113).;
Response:  We have 14 runs and 11 creyons in total. So, we need to find out how many times each run can be divided into 11 equal parts. To do this, we divide 14 by 11: 14 / 11 = 3 rounds of 11 creyons each. Therefore, there are 3 x 11 = 33 creyons in total.;

Response:  We have 22 creons in one jar and we want to divide them equally among 6 jars of 14 creons each. So, how many creons will be left over after dividing them into 6 jars?  Solution: To find out how many creons will be left over, we need to subtract the number of creons that will go into each jar from the total number of creons available.  In this case, if we divide 22 creons into 6 jars of 14 creons each, we will have:  Jar 1: 14 creons + 7 remaining (from 22) = 21 creons Jar 2: 14 creons + 5 remaining (from 22) = 19 creons Jar 3: 14 creons + 3 remaining (from 22) = 17 creons Jar 4: 14 creons + 2 remaining (from 22) = 16 creons Jar 5: 14 creons + 1 remaining (from 22) = 15 creons Jar 6: 14 creons + 0 remaining (from 22) = 14 creons Total number of creons left over = Number of creons in jar 6 - Total number of creons divided = 0 - (21 + 19 + 17 + 16 + 15) = 0 Therefore, there are no creons left over after dividing 22 creons into 6 jars of 14 creons each.;
Response:  We have 5 creons in one jar and we want to know how many creons are in 35 jars with 7 creons each. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of creons in one jar = 5 Creons per jar x Number of jars = 35 Jars x Number of creons in one jar = 175 Creons (Note that there are 100 creons in one jar). Therefore, if we have 35 jars with 7 creons each, then the total number of creons is 35 x 7 = 245 creons.;
Response:  We have 19 runs and 4 creyons in the first run, so we multiply them together to get 76 (19 x 4 = 76). Then, we add 27 more creyons to that total, which gives us an answer of 103 (76 + 27 = 103). Therefore, the number of creyons generated is 103.;
Response:  We have 7 runs and 36 creyons in total. In each run, there are 30 creyons. So, if we want to know how many creyons Faye has, we can multiply the number of runs by the number of creyons in each run: 7 x 30 = 210 creyons. Therefore, Faye has 210 creyons.;
Response:  We have 11 runs and each run has 31 creyons. So, in total we have 31 x 11 = 341 creyons.;
Response:  If we have 30 creons in one jar and 5 creons in another jar, then if we want to mix them together, how many creons will be in total? So, the answer is 30 + 5 = 35 creons.;
Response:  If we have 2 rows of 6 creatures each, then in total, we will have 2 x 6 = 12 creatures. So, if we want to know how many creatures are in one row, we can divide 12 by 2, which gives us 6 creatures per row.;
"Response:  We have 35 pawns and we want to place them in 4 rows of 8 pawns each. So, we will need 8 rows in total. Now, let's count how many spaces are available for each row: In the first row, there are 7 spaces available since we already used one space for the first pawn. In the second row, there are 6 spaces available since we already used one space for the second pawn. Similarly, in the third row, there are 5 spaces available, and in the fourth row, there are 4 spaces available. Therefore, we can place 35 pawns in 4 rows of 8 pawns each as follows: Row 1: Pawns 1-7; Row 2: Pawns 2-6; Row 3: Pawns 3-5; Row 4: Pawns 4-4.";
Response:  We have 31 days in January and we need to find out how many days are there between 20th of January and 19th of February. So, let's count the number of days from 20th of January to 19th of February.

Response:  We have 30 runs in total and we need to find out how many times each player scored at least one run. So, we can start with the first run and see if it is at least one run. If it is, then we add 1 to the count of that player. Now let's move on to the next run and check if it is at least one run again. If it is, then we add 1 to the count of that player as well. We keep doing this until all 30 runs are checked.  Therefore, the number of players who scored at least one run is 24 (since 24 is the highest number of runs any player scored).;
Response:  We have 16 runs and 6 creyons in one run, so we multiply them together to get 96 (16 x 6 = 96). Then, we add 21 more creyons to that number to get our final answer of 117 (96 + 21 = 117). Therefore, there are 117 kreyons in total.;
Response:  We have 21 students in class GEN 98. If we divide them equally among 7 classes, each class will have approximately 30 students (21 / 7 = 3). So there are about 30 students per class.;

Response:  We have 102 students in class GEN 11. If we divide them equally among 99 desks at the back of the classroom, each student will sit with 3 other students per desk (since there are 3 desks for every 4 students). Therefore, if 8 students want to sit together, they can choose any combination of 3 seats out of the remaining 99 seats available. So, the number of ways in which these 8 students can sit together is 99C3 = 765.;
Response:  We have to calculate how many students are in each class and then add them up to get the total number of students at the school.  Classes with 3 periods x 72 students per class = 216 students. Total number of students at the school is 216 + 111 (students who need to be enrolled) = 327 students.;

Response:  If Haley has 10 balls and gives 5 to her friend, then she will have 10 - 5 = 5 balls left. So, the number of balls that Haley has after giving some to her friend is 5.;
Response:  If Haley has 23 balls and she gives 15 of them to her friend, then how many balls does Haley have left? So, the answer is 8 (23 - 15 = 8).;
Response:  If there are 13 people in one group and each person has 50 friends on average, then the total number of people that Haley knows can be calculated as follows:  Number of people Haley knows = Total number of people in all groups x Average number of friends per person in each group  In this case, if there are 13 people in each group, then the total number of people in all groups is 13 x 13 = 169 people.  Now, let's calculate the average number of friends per person in each group:  Average number of friends per person in each group = Total number of friends in all groups / Total number of people in all groups  In this case, the total number of friends in all groups is 50 x 13 = 650 friends.  Therefore, the average number of friends per person in each group is 650 / 169 = 3.84 people.  So, Haley knows approximately 3.84 people for every person in their group.;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each class (K1-K5). We know that there are 20 students in total and they are divided into five classes with approximately equal numbers of students in each class. So, let's assume that the number of students in each class is x. Then, we can write an equation based on this assumption:

x + x + x + x + x = 20...(1)

Now, we have to solve for x using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving equation (1), we get:

x = 4

So, there are 4 students in each class. Now, we need to calculate the distribution of books among these classes. Since there are 4 students in each class, and there are 30 books in total, we can distribute them as follows:

Class K1 - 8 books
Class K2 - 8 books
Class K3 - 6 books
Class K4 - 6 books
Class K5 - 4 books

Therefore, the final answer is:

Haley gen 20 boul. nan klass li 2 ti gason renmen jwe mab. Si li distribye boul li egalman konbyen chak ti gason ap resevwa!";
Response:  If Haley has 2 balls and she gives each of her friends one ball, then she will have 2 - 1 = 1 ball left.  If she gives each friend 28 balls in total, then she will give out all of her remaining 1 ball, so she will have no balls left after giving them out. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.;
Response:  We have to find out how many days it takes for Frank to finish his work if he works for 8 hours a day and has 392 working days in a year. So, we can calculate the number of days Frank works per year as follows:  Number of working days = 392 days (per year) x 8 hours/day = 3065 hours/year Now, we need to convert the number of hours worked into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: Minutes worked/year = 3065 hours/year x 60 minutes/hour = 183900 minutes/year Next, we need to find out how much work Frank can do in a minute. Based on the information provided earlier, Frank can do 14 pieces of work in one minute. Therefore, the total number of pieces of work Frank can do in a year is: Total pieces of work done/year = 183900 minutes/year x 14 pieces/minute = 2576600 pieces/year Finally, we need to divide the total number of pieces of work done by the number of days Frank works per year to get the average number of pieces of work Frank does per day: Average number of pieces of work done/day = 2576600 pieces/year / 3065 hours/year = 847.6 pieces/day Conclusion: Based on the calculation above, Frank completes an average of 847.6 pieces of work per day.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many days it takes for Frank to finish his work if he works at most 8 hours per day and has 104 days of vacation.  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of working days in 569 days. If Frank works 8 hours per day, then he will work for a total of:

$$ \text {Total working days} = 569 \div 8 = 73 $$

So, Frank will work for 73 days. Now, let's subtract the number of vacation days from the total number of working days:

$$ \text{Vacation days} = 73 - 104 = -31 $$

Frank has negative vacation days, which means that he doesn't take any vacation during these 31 days. Therefore, he will finish his work within $73$ days.";

Response:  If we have 42 mosquitoes and each one bites two people simultaneously, then... (1) We will have 84 bitten people if all mosquitoes bite at once. (2) But since there are only 2 seconds between each bite, it means that in those 2 seconds, each mosquito can bite only half of the remaining number of unbitten people. So, after the first second, there will be 42/2 = 21 unbitten people left. In the next second, each mosquito can bite only half of these 21 people, resulting in 10.5 unbitten people left (since rounding down to the nearest whole number gives us 10). Therefore, after both seconds are over, there will be 31.5 unbitten people left.;
Response:  If we have 26 mosquitoes in one place and 33 mosquitoes in another place that are not connected, then there will be no mixing of the two groups.

"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many bottles of soda are available in total. According to the question, there are 67 bottles of soda in total. Now, let's find out how many bottles of soda each person can drink per day based on their dietary needs. As per the question, there are 9 different types of soda for dietary needs, and each type has its own recommended daily intake. For example, for Type A diet, the recommended daily intake is 1 bottle, while for Type B diet, it is 2 bottles. Therefore, if we assume that all 67 bottles of soda are consumed equally among all people according to their dietary needs, then the number of bottles of soda each person can drink per day would be:

Type A Diet: 67 / 9 = 7.5 bottles/day
Type B Diet: 67 / 9 = 7.45 bottles/day
Type C Diet: 67 / 9 = 7.38 bottles/day
Type D Diet: 67 / 9 = 7.25 bottles/day
Type E Diet: 67 / 9 = 7.06 bottles/day
Type F Diet: 67 / 9 = 6.87 bottles/day
Type G Diet: 67 / 9 = 6.68 bottles/day
Type H Diet: 67 / 9 = 6.5 basket/day
Type I Diet: 67 / 9 = 6.33 bottles/day

Therefore, the total number of bottles of soda each person can drink per day based on their dietary needs is:

Total Daily Intake = (Number of Bottles of Soda x Number of People) / Total Available Bottles
= (7.5 x 67) / 67
= 47.75 bottles/day

So, the answer to the question is approximately 47.75 bottles of soda each person can drink per day based on their dietary needs.";

So, we can start by calculating the number of bottles in one batch:  One batch contains 30 bottles of soda. Now, let's find out how many batches there are in total:  There are 8 batches in total. Therefore, the total number of bottles of soda is:  Total = Number of batches x Number of bottles per batch = 8 x 30 = 240 bottles of soda.;
Response:  We have to calculate how many bottles of soda are sold in Konbyen and then multiply it with the price per bottle to get the total revenue from selling soda in Konbyen.  To find out how many bottles of soda are sold in Konbyen, we need to know the number of bottles that Yo has produced and the percentage of bottles that he has managed to sell. According to the question, Yo produces 79 bottles of soda every day and manages to sell 53 bottles of soda daily. This means that he has a sales percentage of 53/79 = 0.67 or 67%. So, if Yo produces 100 bottles of soda today, he will manage to sell 67 bottles, which is equivalent to 67% of 100 = 67 bottles. Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling soda in Konbyen. If Yo sells 67 bottles of soda at an average price of 42 pence per bottle, his total revenue will be 67 x 42 = £28.44. Therefore, the answer to the question is £28.44.;
Response:  We have to calculate how many bottles of diet soda and regular soda we can buy with $54.  To do this, we need to divide $54 by the cost per bottle of each type of soda.  For diet soda, the cost is $0.99 per bottle, so we can buy:  $54 / $0.99 = 55 bottles of diet soda.  For regular soda, the cost is $1.49 per bottle, so we can buy:  $54 / $1.49 = 36 bottles of regular soda.  Therefore, we can buy 55 bottles of diet soda and 36 bottles of regular soda with $54.;
Response:  We have 17 bottles of soda with 9 in each bottle, so we have a total of 153 (17 x 9) bottles. Since there are 29 pomades in one box, and we need to calculate how many boxes it takes to fill all the bottles, we can divide the number of bottles by the number of pomades per box: 153 / 29 = 5.26 boxes. Therefore, you will need approximately 5.26 boxes to fill all the bottles with pomade.;
"Response:  We have to calculate how many bottles of soda are needed for each person in Konbyen based on their daily consumption and the number of people living there.  If we assume that each person consumes an average of 2 liters of soda per day (which is a reasonable estimate), then we need to divide this amount by 60 to get the total number of bottles required for one person per week. So, the total number of bottles needed for all the residents of Konbyen would be:

Total number of bottles = Total daily consumption / Number of people living in Konbyen x Number of weeks in a year
= 2 liters/day x 60 bottles/week x 52 weeks/year
= 31,200 bottles/year

So, if there are 19 bakeries in Konbyen, then the total number of bottles needed from each bakery would be:

Total number of bottles from each bakery = Total number of bottles / Number of bakeries
= 31,200 bottles/year / 19 bakeries
= approximately 1,647 bottles/bakery/year

Therefore, if you want to know how many bottles of soda each bakery in Konbyen needs to produce to meet the demand of its residents, you can multiply the total number of bottles by the number of bakeries and divide it by the number of years they will be producing soda.";
Response:  We have to make 72 bottles of soda in total, and each bottle requires 32 ounces of soda. So we need 72 x 32 = 2256 ounces of soda altogether. Since there are 16 fluid ounces in a cup, we can calculate that we need 2256 / 16 = 140 cups of soda overall.;
Response:  We have 36 potatoes and we want to make 80 bouts of soda. To do this, each batch will require 54 potatoes. So, in total, we need 80 x 54 = 4240 potatoes.;
Response:  We have 30 bottles of soda and we want to know how many are left after 28 days. So, if we consume one bottle per day, we will have 30 - (28 x 1) = 20 bottles left after 28 days.;
Response:  If you have 4 bottles of diet soda and each bottle contains 79 calories, then in total you would have consumed 316 calories from those 4 bottles (4 x 79 = 316).;
"Response:  We have to calculate how many bottles of each type are available in the store and then add them up to get the total number of bottles. Here is what we know from the question:

* There are 57 different types of sodas available at the store (boutèy soda).
* Each type has either 26 or 27 bottles available (depending on whether it's regular or light).
* The total number of bottles available at the store is 26 + 27 = 53 bottles.

So, the total number of bottles of soda available at the store is 53.";
Response:  We have to calculate how many bottles of regular and light soda are needed for each day of the week.  For this, we will use the information provided in the question.  The total number of bottles of soda that Yon wants to drink per day is 81.  Of these, he wants to drink 60 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of light soda. So, we need to divide 81 by 60 to find out how many bottles of regular soda Yon wants to drink per day.  Therefore, Yon wants to drink 13.5 bottles of regular soda per day (81/60). Similarly, we can find out how many bottles of light soda Yon wants to drink per day by dividing 60 by 60. Therefore, Yon wants to drink 10 bottles of light soda per day (60/60). Now, let's calculate the total number of bottles of soda that Yon needs for the entire week. To do this, we simply multiply the daily requirement by seven days. Therefore, Yon needs 91 bottles of regular soda (13.5 x 7) and 60 bottles of light soda (10 x 7) for the entire week.;
Response:  We have to calculate how many bottles of regular and diet soda are available in each store, then multiply that number with the price per bottle to get the total cost for each store. Finally, we add up all these amounts to find out the total cost across all stores. Here is the calculation breakdown:  Regular Soda:  In one store, there are 49 bottles of regular soda. If we assume that this store has multiple shelves or locations where the soda is stored, then it's possible that some of those bottles may be sold already. So let's estimate that only half (24.5) of those bottles are actually available for sale at any given time. This means that the actual number of bottles of regular soda available for purchase in this store is 24.5 x 49 = 1234.5 bottles. Diet Soda: Similarly, in another store, there are 40 bottles of diet soda. Again, assuming that some of these bottles may be sold already, let's estimate that only half (20) of them are available for purchase at any given time. Therefore, the actual number of bottles of diet soda available for purchase in this store is 20 x 40 = 800 bottles. Total Cost: Now let's calculate the total cost of both types of soda across all stores. For regular soda, we have calculated the number of bottles available for purchase as 1234.5 bottles. At $1.50 per bottle, the total cost of regular soda would be 1234.5 x $1.50 = $1847.25. For diet soda, we have calculated the number of bottles available for purchase as 800 bottles. At $1.25 per bottle, the total cost of diet soda would be 800 x $1.25 = $900. Total Cost Across All Stores: To find the total cost across all stores, we simply need to add up the costs of regular and diet soda from each store. The total cost across all stores is therefore $1847.25 + $900 = $2747;
Response:  If you visit Buckingham Palace every day for one month (30 days), and you have already visited it 295 times before that, then you will have visited it in total 325 times.;
Response:  If Rachel visited Buckingham Palace 703 times and had 246 visits to the palace in total, then she must have visited it 2.91 times per day (703 / 246 = 2.91).;
Response:  If you visit Buckingham Palace every day for one year (365 days), and Rachel tells you that she has received 100 visitors to her palace in that time period, then we can calculate how many visitors she would have received overall. So, if you visited Buckingham Palace every day for one year, you would have made 365 visits in total. Now, let's convert this number into a percentage. To do this, we divide the number of visits by the total number of days in that time period. In this case, there are 365 days in one year, so we divide 365 by 365 to get our percentage. This gives us a percentage of 100%. Therefore, based on the information provided, Rachel has received 100% of her expected visitors to her palace.;
Response:  We know that in one day (327 days), 406 people visited Buckingham Palace. Now we need to calculate how many times each person visited Buckingham Palace during their lifetime. To do this, we divide the total number of visitors by the number of days they spent visiting Buckingham Palace. So, if each person visited Buckingham Palace once per year, then: Number of visits = Total number of visitors / Number of days spent visiting Buckingham Palace  Number of visits = 406 visitors / 327 days  Number of visits = 1.25 visits per person per day  Therefore, based on the given information, approximately 1.25 times per person per day visit Buckingham Palace.;
Response:  If there are 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace per week and each visitor stays for one hour, then the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in a year is:  Number of visitors = Total hours visited / Hourly rate  Number of visitors = 45 x 52 (weeks per year) / 1 (hour)  Number of visitors = 2,304 visitors per year  Therefore, if 829 people have visited Buckingham Palace in 85 years, the average number of visitors per year is: Average number of visitors per year = Total number of visitors / Number of years  Average number of visitors per year = 2,304 visitors/year / 85 years  Average number of visitors per year = 27 visitors per year;
Response:  Firstly, we are asked how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace in one year. The answer is given as 557,000 visitors per year. Now, we are also told that there are 365 days in a year (not including leap years). So, to calculate the number of visitors per day, we divide the total number of visitors by the number of days in a year: 557,000 visitors / 365 days = approximately 1,542 visitors per day. Therefore, if you visit Buckingham Palace every day for 57 consecutive years, you would have visited it around 90,000 times (57 x 1,542 visitors/day);
"Response:  If you visit Buckingham Palace every day for one year (365 days), and each time you spend $39 per person to enter the palace, then in total, you would have spent:

$39 x 365 = $14,725

So, if you visited Buckingham Palace 600 times, your total cost would be:

$14,725 x 600 = $8,620,000

Therefore, the answer is $8,620,000.";
Response:  If you visited Buckingham Palace 92 times and each time you visited there were 419 people visiting with you, then in total, you would have visited with 419 x 92 = 38,568 people to Buckingham Palace.;
Response:  If you have visited 3 times to see the Queen at Buckingham Palace and there are 512 visitors per day, then in one year (assuming the palace is open 365 days), you would visit approximately 153 times (512 x 3 = 153). However, if you have actually visited 471 times, that means you have missed 118 visits (471 - 153 = 118) over the course of a year. Therefore, your actual number of visits to Buckingham Palace since you were born until now is 118 + 808 = 926.;
Response:  If you visit Buckingham Palace every day for one year (365 days), and you have already visited it 191 times before that, then in total, you will have visited the palace 556 times (191 + 365).;
Response:  We have to calculate how much of each type of candy is in the bag and then add them up to find out the total weight of all candies in the bag. So we can start with the first part of the question which asks us to calculate the number of pieces of each kind of candy that are in the bag. According to the question, there are 159 grams of hard candy in the bag, so let's assume that this represents x number of pieces of hard candy. Similarly, there are 74 grams of chewy candy in the bag, so let's assume that this represents y number of pieces of chewy candy. Finally, there are 30 grams of soft candy in the bag, so let's assume that this represents z number of pieces of soft candy. Now we need to use these values along with the weights of each type of candy to determine the total weight of all candies in the bag. To do this, we can multiply the weight of each type of candy by its corresponding number of pieces and then sum up all of those products to get our final answer. Using this approach, we can write an equation as follows: Total weight = x \* weight of hard candy + y \* weight of chewy candy + z \* weight of soft candy where x, y, and z represent the numbers of pieces of hard, chewy, and soft candy respectively, and weight of hard candy, chewy candy, and soft candy represent their respective weights per piece (in grams). Substituting the given values into this equation, we get: Total weight = x \* 159 + y \* 74 + z \* 30 = 628 Since we know that the total weight of all candies in the bag is equal to 628 grams, we can solve for x, y, and z using algebraic manipulation. For example, if we divide both sides of the equation by 159, we get: x = Total weight / 159 = 628 / 159 = 4 Therefore, there are 4 pieces of hard candy in the bag. Similarly, if we divide both sides of the equation by 74, we get: y = Total weight / 74 = ;
Response:  We know that there are 49 grams of sugar in one liter of cola. So if we want to calculate how much sugar is in 288 grams of cola, we can divide 288 by 49, which gives us approximately 5.7 liters of cola. Now, since each liter of cola contains 49 grams of sugar, we can multiply 5.7 liters by 49 grams/liter to get the total amount of sugar in 288 grams of cola, which is approximately 260 grams. Therefore, if Plimy hands over 288 grams of cola to Kole, Kole will have approximately 260 grams of sugar.;
Response:  We have to calculate how much water is left in the bottle after pouring out 100 grams of sugar. To do this, we need to subtract the weight of the sugar from the total weight of the contents of the bottle. So, if there are 57 grams of coffee and 22 grams of cream in the bottle, the total weight of the contents is 57 + 22 = 79 grams. If we then pour out 100 grams of sugar, the remaining weight of the contents will be 79 - 100 = 21 grams. Therefore, there are 21 grams of water left in the bottle after pouring out 100 grams of sugar.;
Response:  We are given that there are 166 grams of sugar in a liter of cola and we want to know how many grams of sugar are in 5 liters of cola. So, if we have 5 liters of cola, then we have 5 x 166 = 830 grams of sugar in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 557 grams of sugar in one liter of cola. So if we have 10 liters of cola, then we have 5570 grams of sugar in total (10 L x 557 g/L). Now, we need to calculate how much weight is lost due to evaporation. According to the question, the temperature of the cola decreases from 20°C to 10°C during storage. This means that some water has evaporated from the cola, which will cause it to lose weight. To calculate this weight loss, we can use the following formula: weight loss = mass of water vaporized / density of water. The density of water is approximately 1 g/cm3. Since we don't know exactly how much water vaporized during storage, let's assume that half of the initial volume of cola (i.e., 5 liters) evaporates. Therefore, the weight loss would be: weight loss = 5570 g / 2 = 2785 grams. Finally, we subtract the weight loss from the total weight of sugar in the cola to get the remaining amount of sugar after storage: remaining sugar = 5570 - 2785 = 2785 grams.;
Response:  We have to calculate how much sugar is in each serving of coffee and then multiply it by the number of servings we want to make. So, if we want to make 492 grams of sugar syrup for our coffee, and each serving contains 11 grams of sugar, we need to calculate as follows:  Number of servings = Total amount of sugar / Amount of sugar per serving  In this case, the total amount of sugar is 492 grams, and the amount of sugar per serving is 11 grams. Therefore, we can calculate the number of servings as follows: Number of servings = 492 grams / 11 grams/serving = 44 servings Now that we know the number of servings, we can convert the total amount of sugar into individual packets or containers of sugar syrup. For example, if we want to package the sugar syrup in small bottles with a capacity of 50 ml (which is roughly equivalent to one-fourth cup), we would divide the total amount of sugar by 50 ml to get an estimate of how many bottles we could fill. Number of bottles = Total amount of sugar / Capacity of each bottle  In this case, the total amount of sugar is 492 grams, and the capacity of each bottle is approximately 50 ml. Therefore, we can calculate the number of bottles as follows: Number of bottles = 492 grams / 50 ml = 9.84 bottles So there you have it! To make 492 grams of sugar syrup for your coffee, you will need about 9.84 bottles of granulated white sugar, assuming each bottle holds approximately 50 ml. Of course, you may adjust the amount of sugar depending on your personal preference for sweetness level, but this should give you a rough estimate to work from.;
Response:  We have 94 people who want to cross the river and there are only 10 canoes available. Each canoe can hold up to 9 people. So, we need to divide 94 by 10 to find out how many trips we can make with the available canoes. Therefore, the number of trips is 94 / 10 = 9.;
Response:  We have 266 people who want to cross the river and reach the other side. If each person can carry 90 bags of rice, then we need to calculate how many trips it will take for all these people to transport all those bags of rice. So, if there are 5 journeys in total, then we can divide the number of bags of rice that each journey can hold (i.e., 90) by the number of people making the trip (i.e., 266), which gives us the number of bags of rice that one person can carry per journey: $ \boxed{13} $. Therefore, if there are $ \boxed{5} $ journeys in total, then the number of bags of rice that one person can carry is: $ \boxed{13 x 5 = 65} $.;
Response:  We have to find out how many baskets of raspberries there are in total and then divide it by the number of pickers to get the average basket per person. So, we need to calculate the total number of baskets first. According to the question, there are 294 pickers who picked 244 baskets of raspberries. That means they picked an average of 47 baskets each. Now, let's calculate the total number of baskets: Total baskets = Number of pickers x Average baskets per picker = 294 pickers x 47 baskets/picker = 146 baskets Therefore, the average basket per picker is 146 baskets.;
Response:  We have to find out how many bars of Raspberry and Reese's are in total.  The number of bars of Raspberry is given as 235, and the number of bars of Reese's is given as 221. So, we add these two numbers together to get the total number of bars: 235 + 221 = 456 bars. Now, we need to divide this total number of bars by the number of people who want to share them equally (which is 77): 456 / 77 = 5.9 bars per person. Therefore, each person will get approximately 5.9 bars of candy.;
Response:  We have to find out how many baskets Renmen has and then multiply it with 108 to get the total number of balls he has. So, we need to know how many baskets Renmen has first. According to the question, Renmen has 57 baskets. Now, let's calculate how many balls are in each basket. The question states that there are 252 Nan Moun (a unit of measurement) in one basket. Therefore, there are 252/57 = 4.36 Nan Moun in each basket. Finally, we can multiply the number of baskets Renmen has by the number of balls in each basket to get the total number of balls he has: 57 x 4.36 = 249.62. So, Renmen has approximately 249 balls.;
Response:  We have to find out how many bars of soap are needed for each person in order to wash their body completely.  If we assume that an average person needs about 8 bars of soap to wash their entire body, then we can calculate how many bars of soap will be needed for 36 people. So, if we multiply 36 people by 8 bars per person, we get 288 bars of soap needed altogether. Now, let's convert this number into kilograms. To do this, we divide the number of bars of soap by 100 (since there are 100 grams in one bar of soap), and we get approximately 2.88 kg. Therefore, based on these calculations, it is estimated that around 2.88 kg of soap will be needed to wash the bodies of 36 people completely.;
Response:  We have 26 aquariums and each one can hold 52 fish in total. So, we have 26 x 52 = 1328 fish in all the aquariums combined.;
Response:  We have 40 bets in total and we want to know how many different aquariums can be made with 2 bets left over. So, let's count the number of ways to make an aquarium using 2 bets. There are 36 possible combinations for making an aquarium with 2 bets (since there are 36 cards in a standard deck). Now, since we have 40 bets in total, we need to divide the number of ways to make an aquarium by 2 to get the number of different aquariums that can be made with 2 bets left over. Therefore, the answer is 36/2 = 18 different aquariums.;
Response:  We have 56 aquariums for fish and 10 aquariums for shrimp. Each aquarium can hold 39 betta fish or other small animals. So, in total, we have 56 x 39 = 2148 fish and shrimp in all the aquariums combined. Therefore, Tyler has 2148 fish and shrimp in his aquariums.;
Response:  We have 74 aquariums for fish and 22 aquariums for shrimp. Each aquarium can hold 10-20 fish or shrimp. So we have 74 x 10 = 740 fish in total and 22 x 20 = 440 shrimp in total. Therefore, there are 740 + 440 = 1180 living creatures in all the aquariums combined.;
Response:  We have 15 aquariums for fish and 62 aquariums for plants. Each aquarium can hold up to 10 fish or 20 plants. So, we need to calculate how many fish and plants each aquarium can accommodate. For the fish aquariums, each one can hold up to 10 fish, so we have 15 x 10 = 150 fish in total. For the plant aquariums, each one can hold up to 20 plants, so we have 62 x 20 = 1240 plants in total. Now, let's add both numbers together to get the total number of living beings in all the aquariums: 150 + 1240 = 1390. Therefore, there are 1390 living beings in all the aquariums combined.;
Response:  We have to find out how many shirts Manmohan can buy with Rs 390 he has. So, we need to divide Rs 390 by the cost of one shirt.  Cost of one shirt = Price per shirt x Quantity of shirts = Rs 13 x Number of shirts = Rs 13 x 39 = Rs 547. So, Manmohan can buy 39 shirts with Rs 390.;
Response:  We have 10 t-shirts in total (6 white and 4 black). If Manman buys 6 white t-shirts, then we will have 4 white t-shirts left (6 - 6 = 4). Now, if we buy 3 more white t-shirts, then we will have 1 white t-shirt left (4 - 3 = 1). So, the final number of white t-shirts available is 1.;
"Response:  We have to calculate how many white t-shirts Manman has bought and then multiply it with the price of each t-shirt to get the total cost. So, we can start by finding out how many white t-shirts Manman has bought. According to the question, ""Manman achte 28 pake ki gen."" This means that Manman has bought 28 pairs of white t-shirts. Since each pair consists of two t-shirts (one for each hand), we can say that Manman has bought a total of 56 white t-shirts. Now, let's find out the total cost of these t-shirts by multiplying their number with the price per t-shirt. As per the question, ""si manman achte 28 pake ki gen 56 chemiz blan an total konbyen chemiz blan chak pake genyen."" This means that the total cost of all 56 white t-shirts is equal to the cost of one white t-shirt multiplied by 56. Therefore, the total cost of all 56 white t-shirts is 56 x $10 = $560.";
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many pairs of pants Chemiz has. According to the question, Chemiz has 53 pairs of pants in total. Now, we have to calculate how many pairs of pants he has sold. From the question, we know that Manman has bought 57 pairs of pants from Chemiz. So, the number of pairs of pants Chemiz has left is equal to the number of pairs of pants he had initially minus the number of pairs of pants Manman has bought. Therefore, the number of pairs of pants Chemiz has left is: 53 - 57 = -4 pairs of pants. Finally, we subtract 34 (the price of each pair of pants) from the negative number of pairs of pants to get the profit made by Chemiz: (-4 x 34) = -136.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many white chems (chemiz blan) ManMan has bought in total. According to the question, he has bought 51 white chems. Now, we need to find out how many packs of 3 white chems each ManMan has purchased. To do this, we divide the number of white chems he has bought by the number of chems in a pack. So, ManMan has purchased 51 / 3 = 17 packs of white chems.;
Response:  Manman bought 70 white shirts at a discount of 50%. So, he paid $35 for each shirt. Now, let's calculate how much Manman would pay for 14 black shirts if he buys them at a discount of 60%.  Firstly, we need to find out how much one black shirt costs at the original price. Since the discount is given as a percentage, we divide the discount rate (60%) by 100 to get the actual amount saved per shirt. Therefore, the cost of one black shirt at the original price = $40 x (1 - 0.6) = $24. So, Manman will pay $24 x 14 = $336 for 14 black shirts.;

Response:  We have to calculate how many candies each of the 15 Sirét children got and then add it up to find out how many candies they have in total. Each child got 52 biscuits, so if we divide that number by 15, we get: 52 / 15 = 3.467 (rounded to two decimal places) So each child got approximately 3-4 biscuits. Now let's count how many candies each child has based on this information: If each child got 3-4 biscuits, and each biscuit contains 5 pieces of candy, then the total number of candies each child has is: 3-4 x 5 = 15-20 candies per child In conclusion, there are between 15-20 candies for each of the 15 Sirét children in total.;
Response:  We have to calculate how many candies (bonbons) there are in total and then divide it by the number of biscuits (biskwit). So, we know that there are 14 candies per bag and we have 28 bags of candies. Therefore, the total number of candies is: 28 x 14 = 376 candies. Now, let's count the number of biscuits: There are 86 sirét (siréts) in total, and each siré has 9 biscuits (biskuits), so the total number of biscuits is: 86 x 9 = 774 biscuits. Finally, we can divide the number of candies by the number of biscuits to get the ratio of candies to biscuits: 376 / 774 = 0.5 or 1/2.;
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are in 5 miles (postal mile). A block is equal to 0.167 square kilometers. So, we can calculate as follows:  Distance = Speed x Time = 5 miles / 35 km/h = 0.138 hours. Now, let's convert time into distance using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time = 0.138 hours x 0.167 sq km/block = 0.02194 square kilometers. Therefore, there are approximately 25 blocks in one square kilometer.;
Response:  We have 9 mosquitoes in one block of mail and we want to know how many blocks it would take for 20 mosquitoes to cover all the blocks. So, if there are 9 mosquitoes in one block, then there will be 9/20 = 0.45 blocks per mosquito. Therefore, it would take approximately 4.5 blocks for 20 mosquitoes to cover all the blocks.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the number of junk mails received in one day.  According to the question, there are 24 junk mails per month, and since there are 30 days in a month, we can assume that each day receives 24/30 = 8 junk mails.  Now, let's consider how many junk mails are received in one year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the daily amount of junk mails by 12 to get the total number of junk mails received in a year: 8 x 12 = 96 junk mails.  Finally, we need to convert this number into blocks. To do so, we divide the total number of junk mails by the size of a block (which is not specified in the question). Assuming an average block size of 5 kg, we get: 96 junk mails / 5 kg = 19.2 blocks. Therefore, the answer is 19.2 blocks.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 pieces of junk mail in total. Then, we have to divide them equally among the 3 blocks (A, B, and C). So, each block will get 4 pieces of junk mail. Now, let's count how many pieces of junk mail are in Block A. Since Block A has 5 houses, each house will get 2 pieces of junk mail (since there are 2 mosquitoes per piece of junk mail). Therefore, Block A has 10 pieces of junk mail (5 houses x 2 mosquitoes/house = 10). Similarly, Block B has 8 pieces of junk mail (6 houses x 2 mosquitoes/house = 12), and Block C has 7 pieces of junk mail (4 houses x 2 mosquitoes/house = 8).;
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are in each generation and then calculate the total number of blocks from generation 1 to generation 20.  Generation 1 has 4 blocks (since there are 4 posts), so we multiply it by 20 to get the total number of blocks for that generation: 4 x 20 = 80 blocks.  For generation 2, we have 8 posts, so we multiply it by 20 to get the total number of blocks for that generation: 8 x 20 = 160 blocks.  We continue this process until we reach generation 20, which has 32 posts. So, we multiply it by 20 to get the total number of blocks for that generation: 32 x 20 = 640 blocks. Therefore, the total number of blocks from generation 1 to generation 20 is: 80 + 160 + 240 +... + 640 = 5760 blocks.;
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are in 30 miles and then divide it by 78 blocks per mile. So, we can calculate as follows:  Distance = 30 miles x 5280 feet/mile = 164,000 feet Total distance = 164,000 feet / 78 blocks/mile = 2100 blocks;
Response:  We have 8 mosquitoes that can lay up to 55 eggs per block of 10 blocks (or 550 eggs total). So if they laid all their eggs in one block, there would be 550 / 10 = 55 eggs per block. Now we need to find out how many blocks it takes for them to cover the entire area of 32 lots. Therefore, we divide the number of eggs by the number of blocks and get 55 eggs/block x 32 lots = 1760 eggs.;
Response:  We have 4 mailboxes in each of the 81 blocks (4 x 81 = 324). So, we have a total of 324 mailboxes. If there are 12 mailboxes per block, then there are 324/12 = 26.7 mailboxes per block.;
Response:  We have 4 mailboxes in each of the 16 blocks, so we have a total of 4 x 16 = 64 mailboxes. If there are 17 mailboxes in one block, then the total number of mailboxes is 64 + 17 = 81.;
Response:  If there are 4 groups of 5 people each and Rebecca has 10 balls to distribute among them, then she will have to divide them equally among all the groups. So, each group will get 5/4 = 1 1/4 balls per person. Since there are 20 balls in total, each person in each group will get 1 1/4 x 20 = 28 balls.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 balls and 15 zebras in her collection. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with this money, we need to divide the total amount of money she has ( $10 + $15 = $25) by the cost of one pair of shoes ($5). So, Rebecca can buy 5 pairs of shoes with the money she has.;
Response:  If we have a group of 11 people and they generate 2 children per couple, then the total number of children in the group will be: $11 \times 2 = 22$ So, there are 22 children in the group.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 groups of students and each group has 6 bowls. So, in total, we have 4 x 6 = 24 bowls.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has divided her collection into three groups of 4 and 15 items each. So, we can calculate the total number of items in all three groups as follows: Group 1 (4 items): 4 x 1 = 4 Group 2 (15 items): 15 x 1 = 15 Total number of items in all three groups: 4 + 15 = 19 Therefore, there are 19 items in Rebecca's collection.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 groups of 4 people each in total (6 x 4 = 24). So, if we divide 18 by 4, we get 4.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, let's round up to the nearest whole number which is 5. Therefore, there are 5 groups of 4 people each in total.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 balls in total and she wants to divide them equally among 3 groups of people. So, we need to find out how many balls each group will get. To do this, we can use division. Division is when you divide one number by another to find out how many groups you can make. In this case, we are dividing 99 by 3 = 33. This means that each group will get 33 balls. Therefore, the answer is 33.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 groups of 6 balls each, so in total she has 5 x 6 = 30 balls.  Therefore, Rebecca has more than 20 balls.  So, the correct answer is (more than 20).;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 balls and she gives 12 to her group. So, we need to find out how many balls are left with Rebecca after giving them away. Therefore, the number of balls left with Rebecca is: 5 - 12 = -7.;
Response:  We know that Luke has 154 pens and he gives 11 pens to his friend. So, we can say that Luke now has 143 pens left (154 - 11 = 143).;
Response:  We know that there are 46 people in the village and each person has one penny. So, if we multiply 46 people with 1 penny each, we get 46 pence.;
Response:  If Luke has 84 points and he gives 20 of them to Jean, then Luke will have 64 points left (84 - 20 = 64). Now, if Jean gives him back 15 points, then Luke will have 79 points (64 + 15 = 79). So, the final answer is 79.;
Response:  If Luke has 146 pounds and he wants to know how much weight he will lose if he loses 157 pounds of trivial fat, we can calculate it as follows:  First, let's find out what percentage of his total body weight is made up of trivial fat. To do this, we need to divide the weight of trivial fat (157 pounds) by his total body weight (146 pounds). This gives us a percentage of approximately 108%. Now, to find out how much weight he will lose in terms of his total body weight, we multiply the percentage by his total body weight. So, if he loses 157 pounds of trivial fat, he will lose approximately 139 pounds of his total body weight (108% x 146 pounds = 139 pounds).;
Response:  We are given that there are 3 pennyworth of trivial things in the basket and we want to know how many pennies it would be if there were 78 pennies in the basket. So, we can calculate as follows:  Pennyworth = Number of pennies x Value of one penny  In this case, the value of one penny is $0.01, so:  Pennyworth = $0.01 x 3 = $0.03  Therefore, if there were 78 pennies in the basket, the total value of the trivial things in the basket would be:  Total value = $0.03 x 78 = $2.54;
Response:  We are given that Emily has 100 apples and she wants to share them equally among her 4 friends. So, each friend will get 25 apples (100/4 = 25). Now, we are asked how many baskets of 32 apples each can be made with these 25 apples. To find out, we need to divide 25 apples into groups of 32 apples each. There are several ways to do this, but one way is to group them in sets of 4 apples and then multiply it by 8 (since there are 8 sets of 4 apples). Therefore, the number of baskets of 32 apples each that can be made with Emily's 25 apples is: 25 apples / 32 apples per basket = 8 baskets.;
Response:  We know that Emily has 11 baskets of rice and she wants to share them equally among 28 people. So, we need to divide 11 baskets by 28 people. To do this, we can use division. Division is when we divide one number by another to find out how many groups or parts there are in total. In this case, we will divide 11 by 28 to see how many baskets each person gets.  So, if we divide 11 by 28, we get... (wait for it)...3! That means each person gets 3 baskets of rice from Emily.;
Response:  We know that Emily has 8 friends and each friend gives her 4 pounds of candy. So, in total, Emily gets 32 pounds of candy (8 friends x 4 pounds per friend). Now we are asked how many pounds of candy Konbye gave to Emily. Since Konbye gave 16 pounds of candy, we can deduce that he gave twice as much candy as any other friend (i.e., 2 x 4 = 8 pounds). Therefore, the amount of candy Konbye gave to Emily is 8 pounds.;
Response:  We are given that Emily has collected 18 apples and she can give 6 of them to her friend. So, we have 18 - 6 = 12 apples left with Emily.;
Response:  We know that Emily has 5 apples and she gives 2 to her friend. So now Emily has 3 apples left. Then, we are asked how many apples Emily's friend gets. Since Emily gave 2 apples to her friend, her friend got 2 apples. Therefore, the final number of apples Emily's friend has is 4 apples (2 + 2).;
Response:  We are given that there are 72 friends and Emily has 6 pairs of shoes. So, in total, Emily has 6 x 2 = 12 pairs of shoes. Now, we are asked how many shoes does Emily have altogether (including both pairs and singles). Therefore, the answer is 12 + 3 = 15 shoes.;
Response:  We have 43 friends who want to share 5 green apples equally among themselves. So each friend will get 1/43 of an apple (or 1/43 x 5 = 11.36 apples). Now we need to find out how many whole apples are left after they are divided into equal parts. There are 20 apples in total, so if we divide them equally among our 43 friends, there will be 20 / 43 = 0.47 apples left over for every friend. Therefore, the remaining number of apples is 43 x 0.47 = 20.81 apples.;
Response:  We are given that Emily has 44 friends and she gives 26 of them cookies. If each friend gets 2 cookies, then how many cookies does Emily have left? So, Emily has 18 cookies left (26 - 2 x 44 = 18).;
Response:  We are given that there are 819058 children in Lawrence County and we want to know how many of them have not taken any vacation in the past year. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of children who have taken a vacation from the total number of children. So, if 668278 children have taken a vacation, then the remaining 819058 - 668278 = 150834 children have not taken any vacation in the past year.;
Response:  We are given that there are 202958 children in Lawrence County and we want to know how many of them will be in school in 2029. To do this, we need to subtract the number of children who will not be in school from the total number of children. According to the question, 777622 children will not be in school. Therefore, the number of children who will be in school is: 202958 - 777622 = 125236.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many children are in total. According to the question, there are 629424 children and their parents who want to go on vacation together. Now, let's calculate the number of children per family. Assuming that each family has only one child, then the number of children per family is 629424 / 1 = 629424. Therefore, the number of families with children is 629424 / 1 = 629424.;
Response:  We have to find out how many children are in each of the three groups (A, B, and C). Then we will calculate the total number of children in all the groups. Finally, we will divide the total number of children by the number of people who want to take care of them to get the answer. Here is how we can do it: Group A has 100 children, Group B has 200 children, and Group C has 300 children. In total, there are 600 children. Now, let's assume that 274,865 people want to take care of these children. To find out how many children each person can take care of, we need to divide the total number of children by the number of people who want to take care of them: 600 children / 274,865 people = 0.0022 or approximately 0.02 children per person. Therefore, the answer is 0.02 children per person.;
Response:  We are given that there are 907611 people in Lawrence County and we want to know how many children under the age of 18 live there. To find this number, we can multiply the total population of Lawrence County by the percentage of the population that is under the age of 18. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of the population under the age of 18 in Lawrence County is approximately 23%. Therefore, we can calculate the number of children under the age of 18 as follows: Number of children = Total population x Percentage of population under 18  Number of children = 907611 x 0.23  Number of children = 209633. So, there are approximately 209633 children under the age of 18 living in Lawrence County.;
Response:  We know that there are 800059 children in Lawrence County and we want to find out how many of them live in each town. So, we need to divide the total number of children by the number of towns in Lawrence County. There are 7 towns in Lawrence County, so we can divide the total number of children by 7 to get the average number of children per town. Therefore, the answer is 800059 / 7 = 11429.;
Response:  We know that there are 61619 children in the school and we want to find out how many of them come from Konte Lawrence. So, we divide the number of children who attend the school (61619) by the number of students who come from Konte Lawrence (91676). Therefore, the percentage of children from Konte Lawrence is 54.3%.;
Response:  We are given that there are 34044 children in Lawrence County who have been absent from school for more than 10 days without excuse. Out of these, 134867 children have not received any assistance yet. So, we need to find out how many children have received some kind of assistance. To do this, we will divide the number of children who haven't received any assistance (134867) by the total number of children (34044). This gives us a proportion of 39.5%. Therefore, approximately 39.5% or 424944 children have received some kind of assistance.;
Response:  We are given that there are 610769 children in Lawrence County. Out of these, 590796 children have already been registered for school. So, we need to find out how many more children need to be registered. To do this, we subtract the number of already registered children from the total number of children in Lawrence County: 610769 - 590796 = 198873. Therefore, there are 198873 children who still need to be registered for school in Lawrence County.;
Response:  We are given that there are 644997 children in Lawrence County. Out of these, 893835 children have been registered to receive food assistance. However, only 78 children have been able to access this assistance so far. So, the number of children who have not yet accessed food assistance is:  Number of children who haven't accessed food assistance = Total number of children - Number of children who have accessed food assistance = 644997 - 78 = 644219 children.;
Response:  Adam is generation 3 and Jackie is generation 9. So, if Adam had children with Jackie (who is generation 9), then their offspring would be in generation 12. Therefore, the answer is 12.;
Response:  Adam is generation 10 and Jackie is generation 2. So, the difference between their generations is 8 (10 - 2). Therefore, if Adam was born in the year x, then Jackie was born in the year x + 8.;
Response:  We know that Adam is in generation 9 and Jackie is in generation 10. So, the difference between their generations is 1 (Jackie - Adam = 1). Now, we need to find out how many years have passed since Adam was born until Jackie was born. According to the information provided, Jackie was born after Adam. Therefore, the time difference between their birthdays is equal to the number of years that have passed since Adam's birthday until Jackie's birthday. In other words, the answer is 9 + 1 = 10 years.;
"Response:  We know that Jackie is 10 generations ahead of Adam. So, if we count backwards from Jackie to Adam, each generation represents a gap of 5 years (since each generation is equal to 5 years). Therefore, the number of years between Jackie and Adam would be:  
Jackie - Adam = 10 x 5 = 50 years";
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 6 children in total. If we divide this number by 2, we get 3. So, there are 3 pairs of twins among their children.;
Response:  We know that Gen 9 has 7 people (Adam and his 6 children). So if we add Adam and Jackie to this group, there are now 8 people in total. Therefore, the answer is 8.;
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 12 children in total. So, if Adam has 8 more children than Jackie, then Jackie must have had 4 children less than Adam. Therefore, the difference between their number of children is 8 - 4 = 4.;
Response:  We know that Adam is generation 4 and Jackie is generation 10. So, between them, there are 6 generations (Adam to Jackie). Therefore, the number of years between Adam and Jackie is 6 x 5 = 30 years.;
Response:  We know that Adam is generation 5 and Jackie is generation 89. So, we need to calculate how many generations separate them.  One generation is equal to 10 years (according to the information provided in the question). Therefore, we can calculate the number of generations between Adam and Jackie as follows:  Generation gap = Jackie's generation - Adam's generation = 89 - 5 = 84 generations.;
Response:  We know that Helen has 31 marshmallows and she wants to share them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 31/4 = 7.75 marshmallows. Now, we have to calculate how many bags of 4 marshmallows each can be made with this number of marshmallows. Therefore, the total number of bags is 7.75 x 4 = 30 bags.;
Response:  We know that Helen has 90 chocolates and she gives 51 of them away to her friends. So, now she has 484 chocolates left.;
Response:  We know that Helen has 527 cats and 86 dogs. If each cat gives her 10 pieces of chocolate, then she will get 527 x 10 = 5270 pieces of chocolate from the cats. Similarly, if each dog gives her 5 pieces of chocolate, then she will get 86 x 5 = 430 pieces of chocolate from the dogs. Therefore, in total, Helen will receive 5270 + 430 = 5690 pieces of chocolate.;
Response:  We know that Helen has 144 cats and 397 dogs. She also has 85 turtles and 403 turtle shells. So, we can calculate the total number of animals she has as follows: Total animals = Cats + Dogs + Turtles + Turtle Shells = 144 + 397 + 85 + 403 = 929 animals Therefore, Konbyen has 929 biscuits to share among the animals.;
Response:  We know that Helen has 19 chocolates and she wants to share them equally among her friends. So, if we divide 19 by the number of friends (which is not given in the question), we get the number of chocolates each friend will receive. However, since there are more than one friend, we need to multiply this number by the total number of friends to get the total number of chocolates each friend will receive. Therefore, the number of chocolates each friend will receive is:  Number of chocolates = Total number of friends x Number of chocolates per friend  Since we don't have the total number of friends, let's assume it's 50. Then, we can calculate the number of chocolates each friend will receive as follows: Number of chocolates = 50 x 19/50 = 98 chocolates Each friend will receive 98 chocolates from Helen.;
Response:  We know that Helen has 197 cats and 46 dogs. She also has 75 turtles and 66 tortoises. So, in total, she has 385 pets. Now, let's compare this number with Jody's collection of 200 pets. Therefore, Jody has more pets than Helen.;
Response:  We know that Helen has 519 cats and 300 dogs. She also has 280 cats and 359 dog toys. So, if we want to calculate how many cat toys Helen has, we can use the following equation: Number of cat toys = Total number of pets x Number of cat toys per pet. In this case, the total number of pets is 519 + 300 = 819. The number of cat toys per pet is 280/819 = 0.347 or approximately 347 cat toys. Therefore, Helen has approximately 347 cat toys.;
"Response:  We know that Katie is 81 years old and her friend is 59 years old. So, if we want to find out how many times older Katie is than her friend, we can use the following calculation:
Age of Katie = 81 Years
Age of Friend = 59 Years
Difference in Age = 81 - 59 = 22 Years
So, Katie is 22 years older than her friend.";
Response:  We have 91 jwets from DS and we want to add them with 88 jwets that another friend has. So, the total number of jwets is 91 + 88 = 179 jwets. Now, we are asked how many jwets our new friend has. Since he/she has 53 jwets, so the total number of jwets for all three friends is 179 + 53 = 232 jwets.;
Response:  We know that Katie is 78 years old and has 86 friends. If she makes new friends at the rate of 48 per year, then after how many years will she have made new friends equal to her current number of friends?  Time taken = 48 x (Number of years - Current age) / Number of friends at present;
"Response:  We have:
Katie is 84 years old and has been married for 19 years. Her friend is 69 years old. How many years younger is her friend than Katie?
So, we need to subtract the age of her friend from the age of Katie:
84 - 69 = 15 years
Therefore, her friend is 15 years younger than Katie.";
Response:  We have:  Katie is 62 years old and has 80 new friends at age 41.  So, Katie made 73 new friends in total (80 - 62 = 73).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Katie is 57 years old and she has been working as a teacher for 63 years. So, if we calculate the number of days she has worked as a teacher, it will be: 57 + 63 = 120 years x 365 days/year = 43,850 days.;
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 years old and she wants to have 39 new friends. So, we need to find out how many friends she will gain or lose based on her age difference with Zanmi. Since Zanmi is 34 years younger than Katie, if we subtract Katie's age from Zanmi's age, we get the number of friends Katie will gain. Therefore, the answer is 28 (57 - 34 = 28).;
Response:  We know that Fred has $60 and gives $20 to Jason. So, Fred now has $40 left. Then, we know that Jason has $19 plus the $20 he got from Fred, so he now has $39. Finally, we are told that Jason gave $33 to someone else. So, after giving this amount away, Jason is left with $6 (which is what he had originally). Therefore, the correct answer is $6.;
Response:  We know that Fred has $86 and gives $10 to Jason. So, Fred now has $76. Then, we know that Jason has $5 and spends $9 on something. So, Jason now has $4. Therefore, the final amount of money that each person has is as follows:  Fred - $76 + (-$9) = $67  Jason - $4 + ($10) = $14;
Response:  We know that Fred has $40 and Jason has $69. If we subtract what Fred has from what Jason has, we get: $69 - $40 = $29. So, Fred touches $29 of the Wikenna money.;
Response:  We know that Fred has $114 and Jason has $22. So together they have $136. Now we are asked how much money Jason has after buying something from Fred. Since Jason bought $78 worth of goods from Fred, he now has $58 ($136 - $78).;
Response:  We know that Fred gave $111 to Genie and $40 to Jason. So, in total, Fred gave away $151 ($111 + $40). Now, we are told that Jason delivered a journal worth $44 to Genie. Therefore, the amount of money that Genie received from both Fred and Jason is $151 + $44 = $195. So, the amount of money that Genie touched was $195.;
Response:  We know that Fred gave $49 to Gen and $3 to Jason. So, in total, Fred gave away $52. Now, we are told that Fred took back $112 from Gen and delivered $63 to Jason. Therefore, the amount of money that Konbyen touched was $175 ($112 + $63).;
Response:  We know that Jason has $78 and spends $31 on something. So he is left with $47. Then, he gives $14 to someone. So his remaining amount is now $33. Finally, Fred leaves him $90. Therefore, the total amount of money Jason has after everything is $123 ($33 + $90).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred delivered $16 worth of journals and left $74 worth of machines for Jason. So, the total amount of money that Fred made from these transactions is: $16 + $74 = $90. Therefore, the answer to the question is $90.;
Response:  We know that Fred has $47 and gives $11 to Jason. So, Fred now has $36 ($47 - $11). Then, he buys something for $34, so his new balance is $70 ($36 + $34).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 71 kg of weight. Then, she loses 20 kg of weight, which means she now has 51 kg of weight left. So, her new weight is 51 kg.;
Response:  Jessie has 27 kg of rice and he wants to share it equally among his 4 friends. So, each friend will get 6.75 kg of rice (27/4). Now, let's assume that after sharing the rice with his friends, Jessie is left with 101 kg of rice. This means that he had 33 kg of rice remaining (101-6.75=33). Therefore, the amount of rice Konbyen took from Jessie was 33 kg (since Jessie had 33 kg of rice remaining after sharing with his friends).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has lost 126 kg of weight. Now, if he had 66 kg of fat before losing weight, then after losing weight, his remaining weight would be 66 kg - 126 kg = -60 kg. So, Jessie now weighs -60 kg less than what he used to weigh initially.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has gained 35 kg of weight from his original weight of 69 kg. So, his new weight is 69 + 35 = 104 kg.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 114 kg of weight and he wants to lose 50 kg in 6 months. So, he will have lost 50/2 = 25 kg in each month. Therefore, after 6 months, his remaining weight is: 114 - (25 x 6) = 79 kg.;
Response:  Jessie has 9 kg of rice and he wants to share it equally among his 5 friends. So, each friend will get 9/5 = 1.8 kg of rice. Now, let's calculate how much rice Konbyen will get if he takes half of what Jessie has left after sharing with his friends. Half of 1.8 kg is 1.8 / 2 = 0.9 kg. Therefore, Konbyen will get 0.9 kg of rice from Jessie.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 92 kg of weight and he wants to lose 17 kg (which is equal to 37.4 pounds). So, his new weight after losing 17 kg would be 92 - 17 = 75 kg. Now, let's calculate how much weight he will gain if he eats an extra 56 kg of food. To do this, we need to divide the amount of food he gained (in kg) by the number of days he spent eating it (in days). In this case, he gained 56 kg of food over 99 days, so we can calculate his daily intake as follows:  Daily intake = Total weight gained / Number of days spent eating = 56 kg / 99 days = approximately 0.58 kg per day. Therefore, Jessie will gain approximately 0.58 kg per day for 99 days, which means he will gain a total of 58 x 99 = 5670 grams or 12.5 lbs in 99 days.;
Response:  We have 95 students in one class and 61 students in another class. If we add these two numbers together, we get 156 students. Now, if we subtract the number of students who are absent (64), we are left with 92 students. Therefore, there are 92 students present in both classes combined.;
Response:  We have 93 students in one class and 97 students in another class. If 40 of them are good at math, then we can calculate the number of students who are not good at math as follows: Number of students who are not good at math = Total number of students - Number of students who are good at math So, the number of students who are not good at math is: 93 + 97 - 40 = 56 Students who are not good at math.;
Response:  We have 3 groups of 25 students each and 75 additional students. So in total we have 3 x 25 = 75 + 75 = 150 students. Now let's calculate how many students are in each group: Group 1 has 25 students, Group 2 has 25 students, and Group 3 has 25 students plus the additional 75 students (for a total of 100). Therefore, there are 100 students in Group 3.;
Response:  We have 79 balls in total and we want to know how many will fit in a basket with a capacity of 51 balls. So, if we fill the basket completely, it means that 79 - 51 = 28 balls are left outside the basket. Therefore, there are 28 balls left outside the basket.;
Response:  We are given that Yo has 171 tomatoes in his garden and he wants to share them equally among 30 of his friends. So, each friend will get how many tomatoes?  To find out, we can divide the total number of tomatoes (171) by the number of friends (30): Number of tomatoes per friend = Total number of tomatoes / Number of friends = 171 / 30 = 57 tomatoes per friend.;
Response:  We are given that there are 160 tomatoes in a basket and we want to know how many tomatoes will be left if 56 of them are taken out. So, firstly, we need to subtract 56 from 160 which gives us 104 tomatoes remaining in the basket.;
Response:  We have 90 tomatoes in one basket and we take out 15 from it. So, now we have 75 tomatoes in that basket. Then, we take out 50 more tomatoes from another basket, so now we have 25 tomatoes left in that basket. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes we have is 75 + 25 = 100 tomatoes.;
Response:  We have 175 tomatoes and we want to know how many there are in 77 pods. So, if each pod contains 3 tomatoes (as per the question), then we can calculate as follows: Number of tomatoes in 77 pods = 175 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes per pod = 58.33 pods Now, since we cannot have a fraction of a pod, let's round up to the nearest whole number, which is 59 pods. Therefore, there are 59 pods containing tomatoes.;
Response:  We have 177 tomatoes and we want to divide them equally among 12 people. So each person will get 14.64 tomatoes (177/12). Now let's say one of those people has 53 extra tomatoes that they want to share with the other 11 people. So each of the remaining 11 people will get 4.82 tomatoes (53/11).;
Response:  We have 105 tomatoes in one basket and 71 tomatoes in another basket. If we add them together, we get 176 tomatoes (105 + 71 = 176). So, if we take away 137 tomatoes from this total, we will be left with 39 tomatoes (176 - 137 = 39).;
Response:  We have 4 clous and we want to use them to tie up 10 bunches of bananas (bwa). So, each cluster can tie up 2 bunches of bananas. Therefore, John has 8 clusters left after tying up 10 bunches of bananas with 4 clusters.;
Response:  We have 13 gloves and we want to distribute them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 3 gloves (13 / 4 = 3). Now let's say that John wants one more glove than he is supposed to get. So he will get 4 gloves instead of 3 (John gets 4 - 3 = 1 extra glove). Therefore, John has 1 extra glove compared to the others.;
Response:  We have 11 clous and we want to make 8 clusters with John. So, we will need 3 more clous for John. Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  We have 12 groups of 4 people each (48 people). Each group has to stand in a line that is at least 6 feet long (72 inches), so we need at least 10 lines of people standing in them (720 inches). Now, let's assume that each person takes up about 3 square feet of space when they are standing sideways (which is roughly accurate for an adult). So, if there are 4 people in each line, then the total area taken up by all 10 lines would be 4 x 10 = 40 square feet. Finally, since Konbyen Klou John wants to fit more than 5 people in each line, he will want to make sure that each line is at least 40 / 5 = 8 square feet wide. Therefore, the minimum width of each line would be 8 feet (96 inches).;
Response:  We have 16 planks and we want to divide them equally between two people (John and me). So, each person will get 8 planks.;
Response:  We have 8 glasses of water and we want to divide them equally among 74 people. So each person will get 0.11 (approximately) glasses of water. Now let's calculate how many glasses of water John will get if he is one of the 74 people. Therefore, John will get approximately 0.11 x 74 = 8 glasses of water.;
Response:  We have 12 gloves and we want to put them in 17 boxes of size 3x4 each. So, we will divide 12 into 17 parts using division.  Each part is equal to 1/17 of the total number of gloves. Therefore, the number of gloves per box = 12 / 17 = 7 gloves per box. Now, let's calculate how many boxes John can get with 25 gloves. Since each box has 7 gloves, John can get 25 / 7 = 3 boxes of gloves.;
Response:  We know that there are 42 mosquitoes in total and we have to find out how many mosquitoes Robin has caught. So, if Robin catches x number of mosquitoes, then the remaining mosquitoes will be 42 - x. Therefore, the equation is: 42 - x = x + 3 (since Robin caught 3 mosquitoes). Solving for x, we get: x = 39. So, Robin has caught 39 mosquitoes.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many times ""Robin"" appears in each of the given phrases and then add them up.  Phrase 1: ""Robin gen 43 pake chive."" - The word ""Robin"" appears once in this phrase.  Phrase 2: ""Gen 23 moso nan chak pake."" - The word ""Robin"" does not appear in this phrase.

Response:  We know that Robin has 6 mosquitoes and gives 3 to his friend Gen. So, Robin now has 6 - 3 = 3 mosquitoes left. Then, Gen gets 2 more from Robin, so Gen now has 2 + 2 = 4 mosquitoes. Finally, Gen gives 1 mosquito to another person named Kantie, so Kantie now has 1 + 1 = 2 mosquitoes. Therefore, the total number of mosquitoes among Robin, Gen, and Kantie is: 3 + 4 + 2 = 9 mosquitoes.;
Response:  We know that Robin is 28 years old and has been working for 4 months. So, we can calculate his salary as follows: Salary = Monthly income x Number of months worked = $5000 x 4 = $20,000 Therefore, Robin's total salary for the year (2023) would be $20,000.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin is a character from DC Comics and has been featured in various comic book series over the years.  Secondly, we are given that Robin Gen 21 is a version of Robin who was created in the 21st century. Thirdly, we are told that this particular Robin wields an AK-47 rifle. Fourthly, we are informed that he kills nine mosquitoes with one shot. Finally, we are asked how many mosquitoes Robin would kill if he used his AK-47 to shoot at them. Based on the information provided, we can calculate the number of mosquitoes Robin would kill as follows:  Number of mosquitoes killed = Total number of mosquitoes / Shot taken to kill one mosquito  In this case, there are 9 mosquitoes in total (as stated in the question). To find out how many shots it takes to kill one mosquito, we need to divide the total number of mosquitoes by the number of mosquitoes killed per shot. Assuming each shot kills one mosquito, we have: Number of shots taken to kill one mosquito = Total number of mosquitoes / Number of mosquitoes killed per shot  Substituting the values we have obtained, we get: Number of shots taken to kill one mosquito = 9 / 1 = 9  Therefore, Robin would take 9 shots to kill one mosquito using his AK-47 rifle.;
Response:  We know that Robin is 28 years old and has been working for 6 months. So, in total, Robin has worked for 28 + 6 = 34 months. Now, we need to calculate how much money Robin has earned during these 34 months. According to the information provided, Robin earns $14 per hour, so he has earned $14 x 34 = $456 in total. Therefore, the correct answer is $456.;
Response:  We have 3 machines that can produce 6 chemicals in total. So, if we want to know how many minutes it takes for one machine to produce one chemical, we can divide the number of chemicals produced by each machine by the number of minutes required to produce one chemical. In this case, we get:  Minutes per chemical = (Number of chemicals produced / Number of machines) x Time taken to produce one chemical = (6 / 3) x 10 = 20 minutes. Therefore, it takes 20 minutes for one machine to produce one chemical.;
Response:  In 5 minutes, you can do 4 chemical reactions per minute. So in one minute, you can do 4 x 60 = 240 chemical reactions. Therefore, in one hour (60 minutes), you can do 240 x 60 = 14400 chemical reactions.;
Response:  We have to make 9 sets of 44 clothes each, so we need to make a total of 386 pieces (9 x 44). Now let's calculate how many minutes it will take to complete this task. If we assume that one set takes 1 minute to prepare, then it will take us 386 minutes or approximately 6 hours and 26 minutes to finish all the sets (386 / 60 = 6.4 hours).;
Response:  We have to make 13 shirts and 3 pants in one day. So we will produce 16 pieces of clothing per day (13 x 2 = 26). Now let's calculate how many days it takes to complete all the work. If we produce 16 pieces of clothing per day, then it will take us 8 days to finish all the work (26 / 16 = 8). Therefore, the total number of days required to complete all the work is 8 days.;
Response:  We have to make 9 chems in 8 minutes and we need 2 more chemicals for each minute. So, if we want to finish all the work within one hour (60 minutes), then we will need 14 chems (9 x 2 = 18).;
Response:  We have to make 3 chemical reactions in one minute. So we will need 3 minutes for each reaction. If there are 4 chemical reactions and 8 chemical reactions, then the total time needed is 3 x 4 = 12 minutes + 8 minutes = 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time needed to complete all 8 chemical reactions is 20 minutes.;
Response:  We have to make 6 chemical reactions in 30 minutes. Each reaction takes 12 minutes and produces 4 chemicals at once. So, we will produce 14 chemicals altogether. Therefore, the total number of chemicals produced is 14 x 4 = 56.;
Response:  We have to make 6 chemical reactions in 30 minutes. So we will work for 5 minutes and then take a break of 12 minutes. In one hour, there are 60 minutes. Therefore, during the breaks, we can do 6 x 12 = 72 chemical reactions. So, after completing all the breaks, we will have done a total of 6 + 72 = 88 chemical reactions.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are five people in the group and each person has one bottle of water. So, the total number of bottles is 5 x 1 = 5. Now, we need to calculate how much money each person spent on water. Since the cost per bottle is $2, then the amount spent by each person is 5 x $2 = $10. Therefore, the total amount spent by all five people is $10 x 5 = $50. Finally, we subtract the amount spent by each person from the total amount collected, which gives us the remaining amount left over after everyone paid their share. In this case, the remaining amount is $165 - $50 = $115.;
Response:  If we have $144 to spend and there are 22 people in the group, then each person will get $6.59 ( $144 / 22).;
Response:  We know that there are 30 people in the group and each person has to pay $420 dollars. So, we have: Total amount of money = Number of people x Amount per person = 30 x $420 = $12,600. Now, we also know that one person paid $22 dollars extra. So, we can subtract this amount from the total amount of money: New total amount of money = Old total amount of money - Extra amount paid = $12,600 - $22 = $12,578. Therefore, the remaining amount of money after one person paid the extra fee is $12,578.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that is being spent in one year (44 years x $382 per year = $16,596). Then, we need to subtract the amount of money that was saved during those 44 years ($16,596 - $374 per year = $16,222). Therefore, the total amount of money that Konbyen has after saving for 44 years is $16,222.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 120 dollars in 20 premiums for 6 months, which is equal to $30 per month. So, if we multiply this amount by 2 (since there are two premium payments), we get $60. Therefore, the total amount paid for both premium payments is $60.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that $325$ is divided into two parts: $154$ and $114$. Now, let's calculate how many times $114$ can be multiplied to get $325$. We multiply $114$ by itself $3$ times to get $342$, which is still less than $325$. Therefore, we need to multiply $114$ by itself $4$ times to get $325$: $$ \boxed{114} \times 4 = 325 }$$ So, there are $4$ ways to distribute $325$ dollars among $57$ people in the given scenario.;
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 bicycles at $4 each and she also bought 4 cats for $2 each, then...;
Response:  We have to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up to get the total cost.  Cost of 4 packs of biscuits = $8 x 4 = $32  Cost of 22 packets of cat food = $5 x 22 = $110  Cost of 16 packets of chocolate = $7 x 16 = $112 Total cost = $32 + $110 + $112 = $254;
Response:  If Lucy bought 23 bags of sugar and each bag contains 5 pounds (pound), then she has purchased 115 pounds of sugar in total (23 x 5 = 115). Now, if she also bought 10 boxes of candy and each box contains 5 pounds of candy, then she has purchased 50 pounds of candy in total (10 x 5 = 50). Therefore, the total amount of sweets that Lucy has purchased is 165 pounds (115 + 50 = 165).;
Response:  We have to calculate how many bicycles and cats Lucy has bought in total.  For each bicycle, Lucy paid $20, so she spent $2 x 2 = $40 for two bicycles. Similarly, for each cat, Lucy paid $12, so she spent $12 x 3 = $36 for three cats. Therefore, the total amount of money that Lucy spent is $40 + $36 = $76. So, the answer is $76.;
Response:  We have 12 months in a year and each month has 4 weeks. So we have 48 weeks in a year. Now let's calculate how many days there are in a year. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply 48 weeks by 7 days to get 328 days in a year. Finally, we divide 328 days by 365 days (the number of days in a leap year) to get approximately 0.93 years. Therefore, if it takes 12 months for one generation to pass, it will take approximately 0.93 years for 4 generations to pass.;
Response:  We have 8 mountains and each mountain has 12 monkeys. So, in total we have 8 x 12 = 96 monkeys. But then we are asked how many monkeys there are on 3 of these mountains. So, let's subtract 3 x 12 = 36 monkeys from the total number of monkeys, leaving us with 96 - 36 = 60 monkeys on the remaining 5 mountains.;
"Response:  We have 13 people in one group and they want to climb 4 mountains. Each person can carry only one mountain at a time. So, we need to divide them into groups of 4 so that each group can climb one mountain simultaneously. Now, let's calculate how many times these 13 people will be able to climb all 4 mountains if they work together:

Group 1: Climbs Mountain A Group 2: Climbs Mountain B Group 3: Climbs Mountain C Group 4: Climbs Mountain D

Since there are 4 mountains, each group will climb one mountain once. Therefore, the total number of times these 13 people will be able to climb all 4 mountains is 4 x 4 = 16 times.";
Response:  We have 8 people in one train car and 11 people get off at each station. So, how many people are left on the train after 5 stations?  People left on the train = Total number of people who got off - Number of people who got off at each station x Number of train cars.  Therefore, the answer is:  People left on the train = 11 x 4 = 44.;
Response:  We are given that there are 22 generations in the program for 676 months in total. To find out how many people were involved in each generation, we need to divide the number of months by the number of generations. So, if we divide 676 by 22, we get approximately 31 people per generation.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the number of weeks in a year which is 52 weeks. Then, we multiply it with the number of hours in a week which is 168 hours. Finally, we divide it by the number of days in a program which is 744 days. So, the answer is approximately 109 years and 3 months.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the number of students in each class. For example, if there are 5 classes and 30 students in each class, then the total number of students would be 5 x 30 = 150. Now, let's assume that out of these 150 students, 50% or 75 students pass the program successfully. So, the percentage of successful students would be (75/150) x 100 = 50%.;
Response:  We have to divide 177 by 44. So we will get 4.03571428571429. Therefore, there are approximately 4.03571428571429 people in each of the 177 villages.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to convert both numbers into their equivalent decimal values. The number 919 can be written as 919/10 = 92 in decimal format. Similarly, the number 1307 can be written as 1307/10 = 130.7 in decimal format. Now, let's calculate the difference between these two numbers: 92 - 130.7 = -38.7. Therefore, if you subtracted 2 wochen (which is equal to 14 days) from 919 days, you would have 570.3 days left.;
Response:  We are given that there are 1218 pyramids in one direction and 849 pyramids in another direction. To find out how many pyramids we will see during a 17-kilometer journey, we need to calculate the total number of pyramids along the route.  The distance of the journey is 17 kilometers, so let's assume it takes us x hours to travel this distance at a constant speed. Since we have 1218 pyramids in one direction and 849 pyramids in another direction, the total number of pyramids we will see during the journey is: Total Number of Pyramids = (Number of Pyramids in One Direction) + (Number of Pyramids in Another Direction) x Time Taken for Journey / Distance of Journey In this case, the time taken for the journey is x hours, and the distance of the journey is 17 kilometers. So, we can plug these values into the formula above to get: Total Number of Pyramids = (1218) + (849 x x / 17) = 1218 + (849 x x / 17) Now, we want to know how many pyramids we will see per kilometer of the journey. To do this, we divide the total number of pyramids by the distance of the journey: Total Number of Pyramids per Kilometer = Total Number of Pyramids / Distance of Journey = (1218 + (849 x x / 17)) / 17 = 1218 + (849 x x / 17) / 17 = 1218 + x / 17 Therefore, if it takes us x hours to travel the 17-kilometer distance, we will see approximately x/17 pyramids per kilometer of the journey.;
Response:  If I leave Nan at 6:59 PM and take two hours to reach Twou Wòch, then I will arrive at Twou Wòch at 8:59 PM. However, if I continue from there for another seven hours and six minutes (762 pye), I will arrive in Konbyen at 3:06 AM.;
Response:  We have 6 goldfish in a tank and each goldfish can eat 2 pellets per day. So, we need to calculate how many pellets are needed for all 6 goldfish together. There are 8 pieces of food in a pack, so if we divide it equally among all 6 fish, each one will get 1 piece of food per day. Now, let's talk about the koi fish. The owner said that there are 6 koi fish in the pond and they eat 3 pellets each per day. So, we need to calculate how many pellets are needed for all 6 koi fish together. Since there are 8 pieces of food in a pack, if we divide it equally among all 6 fish, each one will get 1 piece of food per day. Therefore, the total number of pellets needed for both tanks is 6 + 6 = 12 pieces per day.;
"Response:  We have 7 people in one group and 12 people in another group. If we want to make sure that each person has at least one friend from the other group, then we need to find out how many pairs of friends there are between the two groups. To do this, we can use the formula for counting the number of pairs of friends: Number of pairs = Total number of people x (Total number of people - 1) / 2 So, in our case, the total number of people is 7 + 12 = 19. Using the formula above, we get: Number of pairs = 19 x (19 - 1) / 2 = 36 pairs of friends Now, since each pair of friends counts as one ""disparité"", we have: Disparité = Number of pairs x 2 = 36 x 2 = 72 Therefore, there are 72 disparités between the two groups.";
Response:  We have 16 goldfish and 7 catfish in a tank with a total volume of 71 gallons. If we want to calculate the average number of fish per gallon, we need to divide the total number of fish by the total volume of water in the tank.

Response:  We have 8 actions and each action takes 10 minutes in one of the 10 cabins. So, we need to calculate how many minutes it will take for all the actions together. The total time taken = Number of actions x Time per action Total time taken = 8 x 10 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 80 minutes.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in 10 years. There are 365 days in a year, so there are 365 x 10 = 3650 days in 10 years. Now, let's calculate how many times Jaden can play Pokémon Go in 10 years. As per the question, Jaden can play Pokémon Go for 1 hour every day. Therefore, he can play it for 3650 hours in 10 years. Finally, we need to convert hours into days. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3650 hours is equal to 147,500 minutes (3650 x 24). So, Jaden can play Pokémon Go for approximately 147,500 minutes in 10 years.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many people are in each generation.  In Gen 466, there are 466 people.  In Gen 53, there are 53 people.  Now, let's calculate the total number of people from both generations.  The sum of 466 and 53 is equal to 520.  Therefore, the answer is 520.;
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many generations are there between Genesis 141 and Psalm 91. We can do this by counting the number of years between these two events. According to the Bible, it took Abraham 25 years to father Isaac (Genesis 21:5), and Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old (Genesis 21:5). Therefore, if we assume that Abraham lived for another 50 years after Isaac's birth, he would have been 150 years old when Isaac was born. This means that the time difference between Genesis 141 and Psalm 91 is approximately 365 years (i.e., from Abraham's birth to Isaac's birth plus 50 additional years). So, now we know that there are 365 years between Genesis 141 and Psalm 91. Next, let's count the number of generations between each pair of consecutive verses in Psalm 91. For example, verse 1 says ""He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty."" Verse 2 says ""I will say of the Lord";"He is my refuge and my fortress; my God; I will trust in him.'"" There are three generations between these two verses - one generation from Abraham to Isaac, one generation from Isaac to Jacob, and one generation from Jacob to David. Similarly, there are two generations between each pair of consecutive verses in Psalm 91, so there are a total of six generations between the beginning of Psalm 91 and its end. Now, finally, we need to calculate the number of generations between Genesis 141 and Psalm 91. Since Genesis 141 is part of the book of Genesis, which covers the history of the patriarchs from Abraham to Joseph, we can use the same method as before to determine the number of generations between Genesis 141 and Psalm 91. Using the same assumptions as earlier, we estimate that there are approximately 18 generations between Genesis 141 and Psalm 91. Therefore, the answer to the question is 18 generations."
Response:  We have to find out how many pots are in each generation and then add them up.  In Generation 1, there are 40 pots.  In Generation 2, there are 400 pots. So, in total, we have 40 + 400 = 440 pots.;
Response:  We have to organize Skittles into groups of 154 people in a city with 4276 residents. To do this, we need to divide the total number of Skittles (4502) by the number of people in the city (4276). So, we can start by dividing 4502 by 4276 and rounding up to the nearest whole number: $ \frac{4502}{4276} = 1.03$  Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, we will round up to the next whole number, which is 1 group of 154 Skittles. Therefore, there are 154 Skittles organized into groups in that particular city.;
Response:  We have to organize 495 groups of 4 people each. So, we need to divide 495 by 4 to get the total number of groups that can be formed. Therefore, the answer is 123.75 (rounded off to nearest whole number).;
Response:  We have 8 groups of Skittles in total (according to the question). Each group has 517 Skittles (also according to the question). So, we can calculate the total number of Skittles for all 8 groups as follows: Total Number of Skittles = Number of Groups x Number of Skittles per Group Total Number of Skittles = 8 x 517 = 4,068 Skittles Therefore, there are approximately 4,068 Skittles in all 8 groups combined.;
Response:  We have to calculate the number of students in each class and then add them up to get the total number of students at school. So, we need to know how many classes there are in the school. If there are 5 classes in the school, then the number of students in each class is 270 / 5 = 54 students per class. Therefore, the total number of students at the school is 54 x 5 = 270 students.;
Response:  We have 304 classes in grade 3 and each class has 75 students, so we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class = 304 x 75 = 22,500 students.;
