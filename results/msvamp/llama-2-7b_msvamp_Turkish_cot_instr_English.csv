Response:  On Monday (Pazartesi), Julia played with 18 children. On Tuesday (Salı), she played with 10 children. So, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is: 18 - 10 = 8 more children. Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Salı), Julia played with 11 children. On Tuesday (Pazartesi), she played with 12 children. So, if we compare these two days, Julia played with 1 more child on Tuesday than on Monday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is 1.
Response:  Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 8 children on Tuesday. If she had played with 15 children, then she would have played with 3 more children on Tuesday than on Monday (since there are 7 days in a week). So, Julia played with 8 + 3 = 11 children on Tuesday.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Saturday and she played with 16 children if it were Sunday, then we can say that... ( continue reading )
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children on Friday (pazartesi), and each child is equivalent to 4 points, then Julia scored 64 points (16 x 4). Now, if she played with more than 12 children on Saturday (salı), let's say she played with 18 children, then her score would be 72 points (18 x 4). So, the difference in scores between Friday and Saturday is 10 points (72 - 64). Therefore, Julia played with 10 more children on Saturday than on Friday.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Sunday and each child is equal to 2 children more than Sunday, then she played with 7 children on Saturday (Sunday - 14 = 7). So, Julia played with 7 + 2 = 9 children on Saturday.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 3 children (Salı, 15, and Çarşamba, 2) together. So, we can say that they played as a group of 3 children. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  On Monday (Pazartesi), Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday (Salı), she played with 20 more children, so in total, she played with 35 children. On Wednesday (Çarşamba), she played with 97 more children, so in total, she played with 132 children. Therefore, the answer is: 132 - 35 = 97
Response:  On Monday (Pazartesi), Julia played with 5 children. On Tuesday (Salı), she played with 9 children and on Wednesday (Çarşamba), she played with 15 children. Therefore, the total number of children Julia played with is: 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children.
Response:  On Sunday (Salı), Julia played with 2 children and on Wednesday (Çarşamba), she played with 16 children. So, we can say that Julia played with x + 2 = 16 - 2 = 14 children on Wednesday. Therefore, Julia played with 14 children on Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday (Pazartesi), Julia played with 9 children. On Tuesday (Salı), she played with 7 children. And on Wednesday (Çarşamba), she played with 96 children. So, we can calculate how many more children Julia played with on Wednesday compared to Monday as follows:  Number of children Julia played with on Wednesday - Number of children Julia played with on Monday = 96 - 9 = 87. Therefore, Julia played with 87 more children on Wednesday than on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Pazartesi), Julia played with 14 children. On Tuesday (Salı), she played with 2 fewer children than on Monday (12 - 2 = 10). And on Wednesday (Çarşamba), she played with 8 more children than on Tuesday (10 + 8 = 18). So, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and the number of children she played with on Wednesday is 6 (18 - 14 = 6).
Response:  On Monday (Salı), 8 children played together. On Tuesday (Çarşamba), 11 children played together. So, on Tuesday, there were 3 more children who played than on Monday. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  On Monday (Pazartesi), Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday (Salı), she played with 18 children. And on Wednesday (Çarşamba), she played with 7 children. So, we can say that Julia played with more than 15 children on Tuesday and less than 18 children on Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday and Wednesday is 3 (18 - 7).
"Response: 
Julia played with 13 children on Sunday and 10 children on Monday. Therefore, she played with a total of 23 children.  So, Julia played with 23 children in total."
"Response: 
Julia had 7 children and took them to the park on Monday. On Tuesday, she took 13 more children to the park. If they played together on Thursday, then Julia took a total of 20 children to the park that day. So, in total, Julia took 7 + 13 = 20 children to the park."
"Response: 
Julia played with 12 children on Sunday and took turns playing with them for 3 hours each. Therefore, she spent 36 hours (3 x 12) playing with them on Sunday. 
On Monday, she played with 14 children at once for 2 hours. So, she spent 28 hours (2 x 14) playing with them on Monday.  In total, Julia spent 64 hours (36 + 28) playing with both groups of children combined. Since there are more than 10 children in the group, we can say that Julia played with more than 10 children together."
Response:  On Monday (Pazartesi), Julia played with 19 children for 2 hours = 2 x 90 minutes = 180 minutes.  On Tuesday (Salı), she played with 18 children for 2 hours = 2 x 90 minutes = 180 minutes. In total, she spent 180 + 180 = 360 minutes playing with children over two days.
Response:  On Monday (Pazartesi), Julia played with 5 children. Then she played with another 6 children on Tuesday (Pazartesi). So in total, Julia played with 11 children.
Response:  Julia fought with 18 children together on Monday. On Monday, she played with 4 children. How many children did she play with on Tuesday? Therefore, Julia played with 20 children (18 + 4) in total.
"Response: 
Julia played with four children on Thursday (çarşamba). On Saturday (pazartesi), she played with 17 children. So, the number of additional children she played with compared to Thursday is:
4 - 17 = -13
Therefore, there were 13 fewer children playing with Julia on Saturday than on Thursday."
Response:  At first, Bobby ate 7 pieces of candy. Then he ate 25 more pieces. So, in total, Bobby ate 32 pieces of candy (7 + 25 = 32).
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 pieces of candy and then he ate 42 more pieces after that. So, in total, Bobby ate 70 pieces of candy (28 + 42 = 70). As for chocolate, Bobby ate 63 pieces. Therefore, Bobby ate a total of 70 + 63 = 133 pieces of sweets.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy and then he ate 4 more pieces. So, in total, Bobby ate 37 pieces of candy (33 + 4 = 37). Additionally, he ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby ate a total of 51 pieces of candy and chocolate (37 + 14 = 51).
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 pieces of candy and then ate another 36 pieces. So he ate in total 74 pieces of candy. Additionally, he ate 16 more chocolates. Therefore, Bobby ate a total of 90 pieces of candy (74 + 16).
Response:  Bobby first drank 20 glasses of sugar water and then he drank another 34 glasses. So far, he has drunk a total of 54 glasses (20 + 34). Then, he drank 18 more glasses after that. Therefore, the final number of glasses Bobby drank is 72 (54 + 18).
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of candy and gave away 5 pieces. Then he took 9 more pieces. So, at this point, Bobby has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy and he ate 7 pieces. Then, he ate another 5 pieces, so now he has 12 pieces left. If he still has 8 pieces at the end, then he started with 8 pieces. So, the number of pieces of candy that Bobby had at the beginning is 8.
Response:  Bobby has eaten 19 sweets and he gave away 2 of them. So, he has 17 sweets left. Now, if he gives away another sweet, he will have 16 sweets left. Therefore, there are 16 sweets left after Bobby gives away the third sweet.
Response:  If Bobby has taken 32 pieces of candy and he gave away 7 pieces, then he has 32 - 7 = 25 pieces of candy left. So, if 20 pieces of candy remained, Bobby would have eaten 5 (25 - 20) pieces of candy.
Response:  At first, there were 36 pieces of candy (given). Then, Bobby ate 17 pieces and left with 15 pieces remaining. So, initially, there were 36 - 17 = 19 pieces of candy left. Later, Bobby ate another 15 pieces, leaving none. Therefore, the final number of candies is 0.
Response:  If Bobby has 23 pieces of candy and he eats 7 pieces, then he will have 23 - 7 = 16 pieces of candy left. So, out of the initial 30 pieces of candy, only 16 pieces are left after Bobby eats 7 pieces. Therefore, the correct answer is 16.
Response:  If Alan has 5 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons, then together they have 8 balloons (5 + 3). So, there are 8 - 3 = 5 more balloons in Alan's collection than in Jake's collection.
Response:  If Alan had 2 balls and Jake had 3 balls, then after Jake gave one ball to Alan, Jake had 2 balls left and Alan had 3 balls. So, there are 3 balls in total (Alan has 3 + Jake has 2 = 5).
Response:  If Alan has thrown 3 balls into Jake's park and if Allan had thrown 2 balls into the same park, then there are 5 balls in total in the park (3 + 2 = 5).
Response:  If Jake has 6 balloons and gives 4 more to Alan, then Jake has 6 - 4 = 2 balloons left. So, Alan has 6 + 4 = 10 balloons in his park.
Response:  If Alan has thrown 5 balls into the park and Jake has picked up 6 more than what Alan threw, then Jake has picked up 6 + 5 = 11 balls in total. So, there are 11 balls in the park that belong to Jake.
Response:  If Alan has 3 balls and Jake has 5 balls, then together they have 8 balls (3 + 5). Since Alan had one more ball than Jake, we can say that Alan has 4 balls and Jake has 3 balls. So, there are 4 balls in Alan's park and 3 balls in Jake's park.
Response:  At first, Alan had 5 balloons and gave 3 to Jake. So, Jake had 8 balloons (5 + 3). Then, Alan got 3 more balloons from Jake. Therefore, Jake had 5 balloons left (8 - 3), and Alan had 6 balloons (5 + 1).
Response:  At first, Alan had 5 balloons and gave 2 to Jake. So, now Alan has 3 balloons left. Then, Jake got 6 balloons from Alan. Now, Jake has 8 balloons (including the ones he already had). Therefore, there are 5 - 3 = 2 more balloons in Jake's park than in Alan's park.
Response:  Firstly, Alan got 5 balls and then he lost 2 balls. So, he had 5 - 2 = 3 balls left in his hand. Then, Jake got 4 balls. Now, there are 3 + 4 = 7 balls in total. Therefore, Alan has 3 balls and Jake has 4 balls.
"Response: 
Jake has 2 balls in his park. 
Alan has 6 balls in his park and gives 3 to Jake. So now Jake has 5 balls (2 + 3 = 5).  Therefore, there are 5 balls more in Alan's park than in Jake's park."
"Response: 
Alan had 6 balls in his park, and then he gave 3 balls to Jake. So, now Jake has 3 + 3 = 6 balls in his park.  Then, Jake added 4 more balls to his park, so he has 6 + 4 = 10 balls in total. Therefore, there are 10 - 6 = 4 more balls in Jake's park than in Alan's park."
"Response: 
Alan got 5 balls and then gave 2 to Jake. So, Alan has 5 - 2 = 3 balls left. Then, Jake got 6 balls and gave 3 to Alan. So, Jake has 6 - 3 = 3 balls left. Therefore, Jake had 3 balls in total."
Response:  Alan has 3 balls and Jake has 5 balls. In total, they have 8 balls (3 + 5). So, there are 8 balls in their park.
Response:  Alan has 7 balls and Jake has 6 balls. They played together in the park for an hour. If they played equally, each of them threw their ball to the other 3 times. So, Alan threw his ball to Jake 3 times (since he had 7 balls). Similarly, Jake threw his ball to Alan 3 times (since he had 6 balls). Therefore, the total number of throws made by both of them = 3 + 3 = 6. Now, let's count how many top got caught per throw:  For Alan, every time he threw his ball, there was a 2/3 chance that it would be caught by Jake. Since Jake caught 4 balls in total, we can calculate the probability of catching one ball as follows: P(catch) = Number of balls caught / Total number of throws = 4 / 6 = 1/2.  So, Alan threw his ball 6 times ( since he had 7 balls), and Jake caught 3 balls ( since he had 6 balls). Therefore, the final answer is:  Alan threw 6 times and caught 2 balls. Jake threw 6 times and caught 3 balls.
Response:  If Allan has thrown 5 balls and Jake has caught 3 balls in the park, then Jake has 3 balls left. So, Jake has caught 3 balls out of the total of 6 balls that were thrown (5 + 1 = 6). Therefore, the correct answer is 3.
Response:  If Allan had 3 balls and then got 2 more balls, he would have 5 balls in total (3 + 2 = 5).  Then, if Jake got 6 balls, Jake would have 6 - 5 = 1 extra ball than Allan. So, there are 1 more ball in Jake's park than Allan's park.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese. To determine how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the time spent studying English from the total time spent studying both languages. So, if Ryan spends 6 x 24 = 144 hours per week studying English, and 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week studying Chinese, then he spends 144 - 14 = 130 hours more studying Chinese than English per week. Therefore, Ryan spends approximately 130 hours more studying Chinese than English per week.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how much time he spends studying Chinese compared to English, we need to divide the number of hours he spends studying Chinese by the total number of hours he spends studying both languages. So, if Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying Chinese, that means he spends 7/13 = 0.538 hours studying Chinese for every hour he spends studying English.
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and an additional hour or two studying Chinese. If he spends a total of 4 hours studying English each day, then he must spend at least 2 hours studying Chinese per day. Therefore, Ryan spends 2/3 of his time studying Chinese.
"Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and 4 hours studying Chinese per day. If he spends more than 2 hours studying Chinese for every hour he studies English, then the number of hours he spends studying Chinese is:

$$ \therefore \text {Number of hours studying Chinese} = \frac{\text{Time spent studying Chinese}}{ \text{Time spent studying English}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \therefore \text {Number of hours studying Chinese} = \frac{4}{7} = \boxed {0.57} $$
So, Ryan spends approximately $0.57$ hours studying Chinese for every hour he spends studying English."
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying Turkish and 2 hours studying English. If he spends more than 2 hours studying English compared to Turkish, then he spends 3 hours studying English. So, if he spends 3 hours studying English, he has spent a total of 8 hours (5 + 3) studying both languages together. Therefore, Ryan spends 8/5 = 1.6 hours studying English for every hour he studies Turkish.
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese for 5 days. Therefore, he spends a total of:

English: 6 x 5 = 30 hours
Chinese: 7 x 5 = 35 hours
Total time spent studying: 30 + 35 = 65 hours."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese per day. If he takes two days off, he will spend a total of 12 hours (6 x 2 = 12) studying English and 10 hours (5 x 2 = 10) studying Chinese. So, in total, Ryan spends 22 hours (12 + 10 = 22) studying both languages over two days.
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying English and 4 hours per day studying Chinese. If he studies for 6 days in total, then the total number of hours he spends studying is:  5 x 6 = 30 hours + 4 x 6 = 24 hours = 54 hours. So, Ryan spends a total of 54 hours studying both languages combined over 6 days.
Response:  If Ryan takes English and Turkish lessons for 86 days, he will have taken a total of:  English lessons = 4 hours/day x 86 days = 324 hours English lessons = 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours Total hours spent on English and Turkish lessons = 324 + 504 = 828 hours
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English, 7 hours studying Chinese, and 3 hours studying Spanish every day. In total, he spends how many hours studying these three languages per day?  Total time = Time spent studying English + Time spent studying Chinese + Time spent studying Spanish  Total time = 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours per day
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English for 3 hours and Spanish for 58 hours. To determine how much time he spends studying English compared to Spanish, we need to divide the number of hours he spends studying English by the total number of hours he spends studying both languages. So, Ryan spends (6/2) = 3 hours more studying English than Spanish.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English today and 2 hours studying Spanish. If he studies Spanish for more than 4 hours, then he has spent a total of 6 hours studying Spanish (since 4 hours is greater than the time he spends studying English). Therefore, Ryan spends more time studying Spanish than English.
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours studying English, which is equal to 1/3 of his total study time. Therefore, he spends 2/3 of his total study time on Spanish. So, if we divide 4 hours (the amount of time he spends studying Spanish) by 2/3, we get 6 hours. Thus, Ryan spends more time studying Spanish than English.
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and Chinese every day. If he studies English for 2 hours per day, then he spends x hours studying Chinese. Since we know that Ryan spends 3 hours studying both languages altogether, we can set up the equation: 3 = 2x + x (where x is the number of hours Ryan spends studying Chinese). Solving for x, we get: x = 1 hour. So, Ryan spends 1 hour studying Chinese every day.
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 9 hours (4 + 5) per day studying both languages together. So, in one week, he spends a total of 63 hours (9 x 7) studying both languages.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany bought 8 packages of food for Geri's transformation. The next day (Tuesday), she found that there were 7 more packages of food than she had on Monday. So, in total, Tiffany had 15 packages of food (8 + 7 = 15). Therefore, the number of additional cans of food that Tiffany found on Tuesday is 7.
Response:  On Monday (Pazartes), Geri donated 7 packages of food for conservation. The next day (Tuesday), he bought 12 more packages of food. So, in total, Geri has 19 packages of food (7 + 12 = 19). Therefore, the correct answer is 19.
Response:  We know that Tiffany has bought 4 packages of food for her transformation journey on Monday. Then she found some more packages on Tuesday. If there are total 6 jars, then how many jars did Tiffany find on Tuesday? So, the answer is 2 jars.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany bought 2 boxes of food for Geri's transformation. If each box contains 4 cups of food, then the total number of cups of food that Tiffany bought is 2 x 4 = 8 cups. Therefore, if there are 8 containers in total, then on Monday, Tiffany bought 2 containers.
Response:  We know that Tiffany has bought 10 packages of food for her transformation journey. On Monday, she received 3 packages and on Tuesday, she received 7 packages. So, in total, Tiffany received 10 + 3 = 13 packages of food. Therefore, there were 13 cantons.
Response:  On Monday (pazartes), Geri donated 8 packages of food. Then on Tuesday (ertes), he found 10 more packages and distributed them. So, in total, Geri has distributed 18 packages of food (8 + 10). Now, let's find out how many cans were left after that. If Geri had 4 cans before distributing the food, then after distributing the food, he will have 18 - 4 = 14 cans left. Therefore, the answer is 14 cans.
Response:  We know that Tiffany has collected 3 cups of conserves on Monday and then she bought 7 more packages of conserves and 44 packages of canned food. So, in total, Tiffany has collected 3 + 7 = 10 packages of conserves. Therefore, there were 10 cups of conservation kettles.
Response:  We have 17 red beads and 16 green beads in total. If we take one green bead from the pile of 16 green beads, there will be 15 green beads left. So, now we have 17 red beads and 15 green beads. To find out how many red beads are next to each green bead, we need to divide the number of red beads (17) by the number of green beads (15). This gives us 1 red bead per 15 green beads. Therefore, there are 15 red beads next to the remaining 15 green beads.
Response:  We have 5 red beads and 11 green beads in total. If we take one red bead from the pile of 5, then there are 4 red beads left. So, now we have 5 + 11 = 16 beads altogether. Therefore, after taking one red bead away, there are 4 green beads remaining among the 16 beads.
Response:  We have 10 red beads and some more green beads. If we add all the beads together in the bag, then there are 15 beads in total. Since there are already 10 red beads, that means there must be at least 5 green beads in the bag (since 10 + 5 = 15). So, there are exactly 5 green beads in the bag.
Response:  We have 3 red chips and 10 more yellow chips than red chips. So, in total, we have 3 + 10 = 13 yellow chips.
Response:  We have 7 red apples and 15 yellow apples. If we add them together, we get 22 apples in total. Now, there are 8 green apples. So, altogether, there are 22 + 8 = 30 apples in the basket. Therefore, there are 30 apples in the basket.
Response:  We have 7 red apples (kırmızı şeftali), and each red apple has 3 yellow apples (sarı şeftali) attached to it. Therefore, we have in total 7 x 3 = 21 yellow apples. Now, among these 21 yellow apples, there are 8 green apples (yeşil şeftali). So, the number of green apples is 8 out of 21, which means that for every 3 yellow apples, there is 1 green apple. Thus, the answer is 8/3 = 2.
Response:  We have 2 red balls and 6 yellow balls in one basket, and 14 green balls in another basket. So, altogether we have 8 (2 + 6) balls of different colors. Now, let's count how many green balls are there among them. Since all the balls in the second basket are green, there are 14 green balls in total. Therefore, the number of green balls that are not in the second basket is 8 - 14 = -6. So, there are no green balls in the first basket.
"Response:  We have 19 red chess pieces and 11 yellow ones. If we subtract the number of yellow chess pieces from the total number of chess pieces, we get:

19 - 11 = 8

So there are 8 more red chess pieces than yellow ones."
Response:  We have 6 red balls and 90 white balls in total. Since there are 16 green balls, we can assume that they are equally distributed among themselves (i.e., each group of 4 green balls has 4/16 = 1/4 of all green balls). Therefore, the number of green balls in each group is 1/4 x 16 = 4. So, the number of red and yellow balls together is 6 + 90 - 4 = 86.
Response:  We have 18 red beads and 14 yellow beads in total. Now we need to find out how many red beads are there among all these beads. So, the number of red beads is: 18/2 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 red beads in total.
Response:  We have 5 red apples and 14 green apples in total. If we take away 3 green apples from them, how many green apples will be left? So, there are 11 green apples left. Now, let's count the number of yellow apples. There are 6 yellow apples in total. Therefore, the answer is 11 + 6 = 17.
Response:  We have 65 balls in total and each ball has one of three colors - red, green or blue. So, we need to count how many balls of each color are there. There are 7 red balls, 3 green balls, and 2 blue balls. Therefore, there are 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 balls in total.
Response:  We have 11 bags in total. Each bag contains either 10 red apples or 18 green apples. So, we need to find out how many apples are there in total. To do this, we can use the multiplication principle. If each bag has 10 red apples and 18 green apples, then the total number of apples is equal to the number of red apples multiplied by the number of green apples. Therefore, the total number of apples is: 10 x 18 = 180 apples. So, there are 180 apples in total.
Response:  We have 6 bags of different colors. Each bag contains either red or green beads. The total number of red beads is 16 and the total number of green beads is 18. So, in total, there are 16 + 18 = 34 beads in all six bags combined.
Response:  We have 7 bags of different colors. Each bag contains either 10 red beads or 2 green beads. So in total, we have 7 x 10 = 70 red beads and 7 x 2 = 14 green beads. Therefore, there are 70 + 14 = 84 beads in all the bags together.
"Response:  We have 5 sepaters (A, B, C, D, and E). Each sepaters has different number of red beads and green beads as follows: A - 4 red, 3 green; B - 2 red, 4 green; C - 1 red, 5 green; D - 3 red, 2 green; E - 6 red, 1 green. So, in total we have 7 types of beads (red + green) = 7 x 7 = 49 beads. Therefore, there are 49/5 = 9 sepaters in our collection."
Response:  There are two bins with different colored marbles. Each bin has 4 red marbles and some more green marbles. If there are total of 12 marbles in both bins combined, how many green marbles are there in each bin? We can start by counting the number of red marbles in each bin: Bin 1 - 4 red marbles + 4 red marbles = 8 red marbles Bin 2 - 4 red marbles + 4 red marbles = 8 red marbles Now we know that there are 8 red marbles in each bin. So, if there are 12 marbles in total, then the number of green marbles in each bin is: Total number of marbles - Number of red marbles = 12 - 8 = 4 green marbles per bin Therefore, there are 4 green marbles in each bin.
Response:  We have 16 red balls and 13 of them are red. So, there are 13 red balls in total. Now we need to find out how many green balls there are. Since some of the balls are green, we can conclude that not all of the remaining 16 balls are red. Therefore, among the remaining 16 balls, there must be at least one green ball. So, there is at least one green ball among the 16 balls. Thus, there are at least 1 green ball in total. But since we already counted 13 red balls, this means that there are 14 balls in total (including both red and green).
Response:  We know that there are 19 red and 4 green fish in her basket. If there are 15 similar baskets, then the total number of fish is: 19 + (15 x 4) = 19 + 60 = 79. Therefore, there are 79 fish in all the baskets combined.
Response:  We have 10 bags in total and each bag contains either 4 red apples or 6 green apples. Since there are equal number of red and green apples, we can say that every bag has 5 apples (4 red + 6 green). Therefore, the total number of apples is 5 x 10 = 50 apples. So, our answer is 50 apples.
Response:  We have 6 yellow balls and 60 red balls in total. If we take one red ball from the pile of 60 red balls, there will be 59 red balls left. So, now we have 6 yellow balls and 59 red balls. Now, if we take another red ball from the remaining 59 red balls, there will be 58 red balls left. So, now we have 6 yellow balls and 58 red balls. Therefore, the number of yellow balls that can fit in the remaining space after taking two red balls is 6 / 58 = 1/11.
Response:  We know that there were initially 4 action figures in Jerry's room. Then, Jerry added some more action figures to the rack. If there are now total of 8 action figures on the rack, then we can conclude that Jerry added 4 more action figures to the rack after adding the initial 4. Therefore, Jerry added 4 more action figures to the rack.
Response:  The original image had 4 action figures. Then, 7 more action figures were added. If there are total of 10 action figures in the image, then the number of action figures that were originally present is: Number of action figures = Total number of action figures - Number of action figures added = 10 - 7 = 3. Therefore, the first three action figures that were present in the original image were: Action figure 1, Action figure 2, and Action figure 3.
Response:  We know that there were initially 4 action figures and 22 books in Jerry's collection. Then, he added 6 more action figures. So, the total number of action figures is now: 4 + 6 = 10 action figures. Therefore, there are 10 action figures in Jerry's collection.
Response:  The initial number of action figures was 5 and then 7 more were added. So, in total there are 12 (5 + 7) action figures now.  Since each action figure has 9 books, the total number of books is 12 x 9 = 108. Therefore, there are 46 more books than action figures (108 - 62).
Response:  Initially, there were 2 action figures and 10 books in Jerry's collection. Then, 4 more action figures were added to the collection. So, the total number of items in the collection now is: 2 + 4 = 6 action figures and 10 + 4 = 14 books. Therefore, there are more than 14 books in Jerry's collection. The correct answer is: More than 14.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books initially. Then he added 10 more books. So, in total, there were 8 + 10 = 18 items.
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 action figures and 2 books in Jerry's collection. Then, he added 4 more books to his collection. So, the total number of items in Jerry's collection after adding the new books is: 7 + 4 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 action figures and 2 books in Jerry's collection now.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 action figures and 2 books in Jerry's collection. Then, he added 9 more books to his collection. So, the total number of items in Jerry's collection now is:  Initially, there were 5 + 2 = 7 items in Jerry's collection. Then, he added 9 more books, so the final number of items in Jerry's collection is:  $7 + 9 = 16$ items. Therefore, there are indeed more than 5 action figures in Jerry's collection after adding the new books.
Response:  At first, there were 8 action figures in Jerry's collection. Then, 4 more action figures were added to the collection and later 5 of them were removed. So, the final number of action figures in Jerry's collection is: 8 + 4 = 12 - 5 = 7 action figures.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 action figures in Jerry's collection. Then, he added 4 more action figures and removed the old ones. If there are 6 action figures in total in Jerry's collection, then we can conclude that 2 of the original action figures (the 3rd and the 4th) were removed and replaced with new ones. Therefore, Jerry removed 2 action figures from his collection.
Response:  At first, there were 7 action figures in Jerry's room. Then, he added some more action figures and removed one of them. If there are 8 action figures in total now, then we can conclude that Jerry added 1 new action figure after removing 1 old one. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  If there were initially 4 action figures in Jerry's room and he added 2 more, then there are now 6 action figures in total (4 + 2 = 6). Then, if he removed 3 of them, there would be 3 action figures left (6 - 3 = 3). So, the number of action figures that Jerry had at first is 3.
Response:  Initially, there were 9 action figures in Jerry's room. Then, 7 more action figures were added. If there are 10 books in the room, and each book has 4 pages, then the total number of pages is 10 x 4 = 40 pages. So, the total number of action figures that can fit on one page is 40 / 9 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 additional action figures that can be placed on top of the original 9.
Response:  We know that there were initially 3 books and 4 action figures in Jerry's room. Then, two more action figures were added to the raffle. So, after adding these new action figures, there are now 5 action figures in total (including the initial 4). Therefore, the number of books minus the number of action figures is equal to 3 - 5 = -2. Thus, there are 2 fewer books than action figures in Jerry's room.
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 books and 3 action figures in Jerry's room. Then, two more action figures were added to the raffle. So, after adding these new action figures, how many action figures would be in the raffle now? The answer is 5 (7 - 2 = 5). Therefore, among the items in the raffle, there are more than 7 books.
Response:  There are two birds sitting on top of a branch (kuş 1 and kuş 2). Then, other three birds come and sit on the same branch with them (kuş 3, kuş 4, and kuş 5). So, in total, there are five birds sitting on the branch now (kuş 1 + kuş 2 + kuş 3 + kuş 4 + kuş 5). Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We have 4 birds initially and then 1 more bird joins them. So, in total we have 5 birds. At the beginning, there were 4 birds. Therefore, the answer is (4).
Response:  We have 4 birds and 46 bugs sitting on top of each other. If 6 more birds join them, then there will be a total of 10 birds (4 + 6). So, there are 40 bugs (46 - 4) sitting on top of each other.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 2 dogs sitting on top of a wall. Another 5 birds join them later. So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 birds and 2 dogs.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 dogs sitting on top of each other. If we add another bird to them, then there will be 4 birds in total. So, the number of birds is 4 - 3 = 1 more than the number of dogs. Therefore, there are more birds than dogs.
Response:  We have 2 birds and 6 snakes initially. If we add 3 more birds, then we have 5 birds in total (including the initial 2). Now, let's count the number of snakes. There are 6 snakes initially, plus 3 more snakes that were added later, so there are 9 snakes in total. Therefore, there are 4 more snakes than birds (9 snakes - 5 birds = 4).
Response:  We have 4 birds and 6 dogs sitting on top of a wall. If we add 2 more dogs to them, then there will be 6 dogs in total. So, the number of dogs on the wall is 6. Therefore, the answer is (6).
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 dogs sitting on top of a wall. 6 more dogs join them. How many birds and dogs are there in total on the wall?  Total number of birds = 3 + 6 = 9 Total number of dogs = 4 + 6 = 10 Therefore, there are 9 birds and 10 dogs on the wall.
Response:  There are 6 birds and 3 dogs sitting on top of each other. If we add another dog, there will be 7 animals in total. So, among the birds, there are more than 6 birds. Therefore, the answer is (more than 6).
Response:  We have 4 birds and 3 dogs sitting on top of a wall. 6 more dogs join them. How many dogs are there in total now?  Total number of dogs = Number of dogs initially + Number of dogs that joined = 3 + 6 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 dogs in total.
Response:  We have 6 birds sitting on branches initially. Then, we add 4 more birds to sit on the same branch, making it 10 birds in total. Finally, we add another 8 birds to sit on the same branch, making it 18 birds in total. So, there are 18 birds sitting on the branches.
Response:  There are 2 birds sitting on one branch. Then, 5 more birds join them, making it 7 birds in total. Next, 4 snakes also join them, bringing the total number of creatures to 11 (7 birds + 4 snakes). So, there are more than 7 birds on the branch. The correct answer is A) More than 7 birds.
Response:  We have 3 birds sitting on 3 branches. If we add 2 more birds to the group, there will be 5 birds in total (3 + 2 = 5). Now, if we add 6 more snakes to the group, there will be 11 snakes in total (5 + 6 = 11). So, from the given information, we can conclude that there are 8 snakes more than birds on the branches (11 - 3 = 8).
Response:  There are 5 dogs and 3 cats sitting on the mat. If we add 4 more cats, there will be a total of 7 cats including the original 3. So, there are more cats than dogs. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).
Response:  There are 6 birds and 2 cats sitting on top of each other. If we add 3 more birds, there will be a total of 9 birds. So, in this case, there are more than 4 birds above the cat (6 + 3 = 9). Therefore, the correct answer is A) More than 4 birds.
Response:  Firstly, there are 3 birds sitting on top of each other. Then, 6 dogs and 2 more birds join them. So, in total, how many birds are sitting on top of each other? Therefore, the answer is 9 (3 + 6).
"Response:  The first book has 48 pages and the second book has 11 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages in the second book from the total number of pages in the first book, we get:  
Pages in First Book - Pages in Second Book = 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, the first book is 37 pages longer than the second book."
Response:  The first book has 37 pages and the second book has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second book than in the first book, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first book from the number of pages in the second book. So, 80 - 37 = 43. Therefore, there are 43 more pages in the second book than in the first book.
Response:  The book has two parts with 60 pages in the first part and total of 93 pages. So, if there are 60 pages in the first part, then there will be 33 pages (93 - 60) in the second part.
Response:  If there are 67 pages in total and the book has two parts with 36 pages each, then...
Response:  First book has 66 pages, second book has 35 pages and third book has 24 pages. So total number of pages is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, the book consists of 125 pages.
Response:  First book has 91 pages, second book has 23 pages, and third book has 25 pages. So total number of pages is:  First book + Second book + Third book = 91 + 23 + 25 = 149 pages. Therefore, first book has 58 more pages than second book (149 - 91 = 58).
Response:  First book has 35 pages, second book has 18 pages, and third book has 3 pages. So total number of pages is:  First book + Second book + Third book = 35 + 18 + 3 = 60 pages. Therefore, in the second book, there are 60 - 18 = 42 pages between the two books.
Response:  First book has 53 pages, second book has 75 pages and third book has 21 pages. So total number of pages is:  First book + Second book + Third book = 53 + 75 + 21 = 149 pages. Therefore, there are 149 - 21 = 128 pages between first and third books.
"Response:  The book consists of 31 chapters and each chapter contains 61 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

31 x 61 = 1891

So, the book has 1891 pages."
Response:  The book has 23 pages and consists of 2 chapters. Each chapter contains 10 pages. Therefore, the first chapter consists of 10 pages. So, the first chapter is 10 pages long.
Response:  First book has 81 pages and it is divided into two volumes. So, volume one has 81/2 = 40.5 pages. Volume two has 81 - 40.5 = 40.5 pages. Therefore, there are 40.5 pages in the second volume.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 62 kampçı (camels) carried their loads in the morning and then 39 of them dropped their loads afterward. Now, to find out how many more camels dropped their loads than those who did not drop their loads, we need to subtract the number of camels that dropped their loads from the total number of camels that carried their loads in the morning. So, the difference between 62 and 39 is 23. Therefore, 23 more camels dropped their loads than those who did not drop their loads.
Response:  If there were initially 52 campers who made breakfast at 8 am and then 61 more campers joined after that, the total number of campers making breakfast would be:  Initially, 52 campers x 1 breakfast = 52 breakfasts Made Total Number of Campers = 52 + 61 = 113 campers Afterward, each camper makes one breakfast, so the total number of breakfasts made is: 113 campers x 1 breakfast = 113 breakfasts made In conclusion, between 8 am and when the additional campers arrived, 61 extra campers participated in cooking breakfast, resulting in an increase of 51 additional breakfasts (from 52 to 113).
Response:  On that day, he caught 15 fish in the morning and then caught a few more after noon. If he had caught 32 fish altogether that day, then he would have caught 17 fish after noon (32 - 15 = 17). So, he caught 17 fish after noon.
Response:  If 40 campers went to the beach at 7 am and 30 more came after that, then there were 70 campers in total at the beach. If they all built sandcastles simultaneously for an hour, then each camper would have built half as many sandcastles as the number of hours they spent at the beach (in this case, 1 hour). So, if there were 70 campers at the beach, each one would have built 35 sandcastles (70 x 1/2 = 35).
Response:  Firstly, we know that 36 campers went to Sabah and then 13 campers left afterward. So, the total number of campers who went to Sabah is 36 + 13 = 49. Therefore, the answer is 49 campers kicked the bucket.
Response:  On the first day (Sunday), there were 44 campers in total. Then, on Monday, 39 campers left and only 25 remained. On Tuesday, another 16 campers left, leaving 8 campers behind. Finally, on Wednesday, 31 more campers arrived, bringing the total number of campers to 50. So, the correct answer is:  $ \boxed{50} - \boxed{44} + \boxed{39} - \boxed{16} + \boxed{31} = \boxed{75}$
Response:  Firstly, we know that 53 kampçı (camels) carried the load in the morning and after 48 kampçı (camels) returned, 49 kampçı (camels) carried the load in the evening. So, the total number of camels carrying the load is : 53 + 48 = 101 camels.
Response:  If there were 33 campers in the morning, and they made 34 trips to the beach after that, then the total number of trips is: 33 + 34 = 67 trips. Since each trip takes 10 minutes, the total time spent at the beach is: 67 trips x 10 minutes/trip = 670 minutes. Therefore, the difference between the afternoon and evening is: 670 minutes - 330 minutes = 340 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 13 kampçı kürek çekti and then 59 kampçı sabah yürüyüşe çıktı. So in total, 72 kampçı (13 + 59) çekti. After that, 21 more kampçı kürek çekti. Therefore, the final number of kampçı kürek çekti is 72 + 21 = 93 kampçı kürek çekti.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 29 kampçı kürek çekti and then they started their journey at 66 kampçı. So, initially there were 66 - 29 = 37 kampçı left behind. Then, after 26 kampçı passed through, 37 + 26 = 63 kampçı remained. Therefore, the number of kampçı who passed through more than 29 kampçı is 63 - 29 = 34 kampçı.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 41 kampçı kürek çekti and then 4 kampçı went for a morning run. So far, there are 45 kampçı (41 + 4). Then, 26 kampçı Öğleden Sonra kürek çekti. Now, let's calculate how many kampçı went for a morning run after 26 kampçı Öğleden Sonra. We can see from the question that 26 kampçı were left behind, so the number of kampçı who went for a morning run is equal to the total number of kampçı minus the number of kampçı who did not go for a morning run. Therefore, the answer is 41 - 26 = 15 kampçı went for a morning run after 26 kampçı Öğleden Sonra.
Response:  On any given day (g), there are 46 kampçı who can blow their horns. If 43 of them blow their horns in the morning and afternoon combined (S + O), then how many of them blow their horns after Öğleden Sonra (OS)?  Therefore, the number of kampçı who blow their horns after Öğleden Sonra is: 46 - 43 = 3.
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree and there were initially 7 apples in the tree, then after she picked them, there would be 3 apples left in the tree (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are 3 apples left in the tree now.
Response:  Rachel had 4 apples in her tree and then she picked two of them. So, after picking two apples, Rachel has 2 apples left in her tree. Therefore, Rachel picked 4 - 2 = 2 apples.
Response:  Rachel picked 7 juicy apples from an orchard and left 5 apples in the tree. If 3 of the remaining apples are also juicy, how many juicy apples are left in the tree?
Response:  We know that Rachel picked two apples from the tree and then there were five apples left in the tree. If we subtract 2 (the number of apples she picked) from 5 (the number of apples left in the tree), we get 3. So, there are three apples left in the tree.
Response:  We know that there were initially 6 olives in the tree and then 3 more olive fruits grew. So, the total number of olives in the tree is: 6 + 3 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 olives in the tree.
Response:  Rachel picked three apples from the apple tree. Now there are two apples left in the tree and 27 apples that have not yet ripened. So, how many apples were there initially in the tree? We know that Rachel picked three apples, so if we subtract three from the total number of apples in the tree, we will get the initial number of apples. Therefore, the answer is 30 (3 - 3 = 0).
Response:  Firstly, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree. Then, two new apples grew on the same tree. Now, there are 6 apples in the tree. So, initially, there were 9 apples (7 + 2) in the tree. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that at first, there were two apples in Rachel's tree. Then, Rachel picked four apples from the tree. So, after she picked them, there were 2 + 4 = 6 apples left in the tree. Finally, three new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples in Rachel's tree is 6 + 3 = 9 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 52 apples in total and we picked two from one of the trees. So, after picking two apples, there were 50 apples left on the tree. Now, we found seven more apples. Therefore, the number of apples on the tree is 50 + 7 = 57 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 3 apple trees and each tree has 8 apples in total. So, the total number of apples is 3 x 8 = 24 apples. Now we are told that after harvesting some apples from these trees, there are still 9 apples left in the trees. Therefore, initially (at the start), there were 24 - 9 = 15 apples in the trees.
Response:  Rachel has 4 apple trees and picks 7 apples from each tree. So she picks a total of 28 apples (7 x 4 = 28). Now there are 29 apples in total, including the ones Rachel picked. Therefore, Rachel picked 1 apple less than the total number of apples. So the answer is 28 - 1 = 27 apples that Rachel picked.
Response:  We know that Ed had 20 marbles before he lost some of them in the game area. Now, we are told that Ed has 19 marbles left. So, if Ed lost some marbles, then he must have lost 1 marble. Therefore, Doug lost 1 marble.
Response:  We know that Ed has 45 marbles in total and he lost 10 of them in the game. So, Ed had 35 marbles left after losing 10. Then, he won 11 more marbles from the game, so now he has 46 marbles (35 + 11 = 46). Therefore, Ed has 46 - 10 = 36 marbles left in his bag.
Response:  We know that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed has x marbles, then Doug has x - 7 marbles (since he lost 7 marbles). Since Ed has 22 marbles in total, we can set up the equation: x = 22 - 7. Solving for x, we get: x = 15. Therefore, Doug has 9 marbles (x - 7 = 9).
Response:  We know that Ed had 27 mermaids and lost 3 of them in the game with Doug. So, initially, Doug had 27 - 3 = 24 mermaids.
Response:  We know that Ed has found 9 more pieces of treasure than he lost. So, if he had 24 pieces of treasure to start with and lost 27, then he must have started with 24 - 27 = -3 pieces of treasure. But we also know that he found 9 more pieces of treasure, so he actually ended up with 9 + 9 = 18 pieces of treasure. Therefore, there are 18 pieces of treasure left in Doug's cave.
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 marbles in total and lost 17 of them. So, he has 29 - 17 = 12 marbles left.
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 marbles in his pocket before he lost some of them playing the game. Then, we are told that Ed lost some marbles and now has 8 fewer marbles than he did before. So, if Ed had 19 marbles initially, then he must have had 11 marbles left after losing some (since 8 is less than 19). Therefore, Ed lost 7 marbles during the game.
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 marbles before he played the game and lost 7 of them (he lost 21 marbles in total). So, after losing those marbles, Ed has 91 - 21 = 70 marbles left. Now, we are asked how many more marbles Ed has than he had initially. Therefore, the answer is 70 - 30 = 40 additional marbles that Ed has compared to his initial amount.
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 marbles before he played the game with Doug. After playing the game, Ed lost 5 marbles, so now he has 7 marbles left (12 - 5 = 7). Now we are told that Doug won 20 marbles from Ed in the game. So, after the game, Doug had 20 + 7 = 27 marbles in total. Therefore, Doug had 27 - 17 = 10 marbles left.
Response:  If 408 students were asked to add potatoes to their menu and 42 students suggested adding meat, then among those who suggested adding meat, how many more students added potatoes than suggested adding meat? So, the difference between the number of students who added potatoes and the number of students who suggested adding meat is 408 - 42 = 366. Therefore, 366 students added potatoes instead of suggesting meat.
Response:  If 479 students preferred to add potatoes to their menu instead of meat, and among those who preferred potatoes, 489 students added it to their menu, then we can calculate the number of students who preferred potatoes as follows:  Number of students who preferred potatoes = Total number of students - Number of students who did not prefer potatoes (in this case, 489) Number of students who preferred potatoes = 479 - 489 = -10 So there are 10 fewer students who preferred potatoes than expected.
Response:  If we assume that all 310 students were asked to choose between adding potatoes or meat to their menu, and 185 of them chose potatoes, then we can say that 125 (310 - 185) students did not choose potatoes. Therefore, 125 students suggested adding meat to their menu.
Response:  The total number of students is 288.  Of those, 264 students suggested adding meat to the menu (which means they did not suggest any vegetarian options). Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes to the menu is 264 - 264 = 0 students. So, none of the students suggested adding potatoes to the menu.
Response:  If 63 out of 457 students preferred to add mashed potatoes to their menu instead of pasta, then 63/457 = 0.14 (approximately). So, approximately 14% of the students preferred mashed potatoes over pasta.
Response:  If 166 out of 182 students recommended pasta instead of potatoes, then the number of students who recommended pasta is 166/182 = 0.91 (or approximately 91%). So, there are 91% of students who recommended pasta and 9% who recommended potatoes.
"Response:  If we assume that each of the three options (patates püresi, pastırma, and domates) has an equal probability of being chosen by the students, then the number of students who will choose each option can be modeled as follows:

Patates püresi: 324 / 608 = 0.52
Pastırma: 374 / 608 = 0.61
Domates: 128 / 608 = 0.21

So, in total, 169 students (0.52 x 324 + 0.61 x 374 + 0.21 x 128) will choose one of these three options."
Response:  If we assume that all of the students voted equally (which is unlikely), then the number of students who chose each option would be roughly proportional to their total numbers. So if 257 students chose kartoffelpüresi, and 120 students chose pastırması, then there are approximately 3 times as many students who preferred kartoffelpüresi than those who preferred pastırması. Therefore, out of the remaining 97 students, more than half (56 students) preferred domates.
Response:  If 467 students preferred to add meatballs to their menu instead of mashed potatoes (as suggested), and 79 students preferred to add tomatoes instead of mashed potatoes, then how many more students preferred to add mashed potatoes than added tomatoes?  Therefore, the number of students who preferred to add mashed potatoes is 467 - 79 = 388.
Response:  If Sofia suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 337 students agreed, then among those who agreed, how many more students than Sofia suggested added pasta to the menu? So, there are 337 - 228 = 109 students who added pasta to the menu. Therefore, out of all the students (including Sofia), 23 + 109 = 132 students suggested adding vegetables to the menu.
Response:  If 450 students were asked to choose between 66 different dishes and 38 of them chose pasta as an additional option, then we can calculate the number of students who did not choose pasta as follows: Number of students who did not choose pasta = Total number of students - Number of students who chose pasta = 450 - 38 = 412. Therefore, 412 students did not add pasta to their menu.
Response:  If 351 out of 218 students preferred to add potatoes to their menu when Sofia suggested it, then 64 (351-198) students did not prefer to add potatoes to their menu. Therefore, among the remaining 198 students who did not prefer to add potatoes, 107 (198-91) students preferred to add only meat to their menu, and 97 (91+16) students preferred to add both meat and potatoes to their menu.
Response:  If Sofia suggested adding peas to the menu and 269 students agreed, then there are 100 students who did not agree (since the total number of students is 330).  If she then suggested adding carrots and 76 students agreed, then there are 244 students who did not agree (again, since the total number of students is 330). So, among the students who did not agree with adding peas, 58% (244/434) agreed with adding carrots.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. So, if we subtract 236 from 569, we get: 569 - 236 = 333 Therefore, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We have 34 girls and 841 boys in school. To find out how many more boys there are than girls, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. So, if we subtract 34 from 841, we get: 841 - 34 = 796. Therefore, there are 796 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 children in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls in the school and 463 boys remaining. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students (girls + boys), we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys - Number of boys = 697 + 463 - 228 = 1058 Therefore, there are 1058 males in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls in the school and 510 boys more than girls. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Number of boys = 635 + 510 = 1145 Therefore, there are 1145 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 587 boys in the school, then the total number of students in the school is 868 + 587 = 1455. Since the number of boy students is 281 more than the number of girl students, we can deduce that the number of girl students is 1455 - 281 = 1174. Therefore, there are 1174 students in the school.
Response:  If there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls in that school, then the total number of students in the school is:  Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls)  Total number of students = 700 + (142 - 700)  Total number of students = 700 + (-68)  Total number of students = 632  Therefore, there are 632 students in that school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 students in total, of which 418 are girls. So, the number of boys is 706 - 418 = 288. Therefore, there are 288 boys in the school currently.
Response:  We know that there are 902 girls in school initially. If 44 more girls join the school, then the total number of girls will be: 902 + 44 = 946 girls. So, currently, there are 946 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls in school and 410 boys. If 465 more girls joined the school, then we can say that the number of girls increased by 465 - 410 = 55. So, there are now 687 girls (632 + 55) in the school. As for the boys, they remained unchanged at 410. Therefore, there are 55 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in school. Then, 682 girls and 8 boys joined the school later. So, we need to find out how many girls are currently in the school. To do this, we can use the information given in the question: Number of girls who joined = 682 Number of boys who joined = 8 Total number of students joining = 682 + 8 = 690 Now, let's subtract the total number of students joining from the initial number of girls: Initial number of girls - Total number of students joining = 732 - 690 = 42 Therefore, there are currently 42 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in the school initially. So, altogether we have 135 + 214 = 349 students in the school initially. Then, 496 girls and 910 boys joined the school later. So, the total number of students in the school now is 349 (initial) + 496 = 845 students. Therefore, there are 845 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. If we add these two numbers together, we get 626 students in total (308 + 318). Since there are 36 teachers at the school, the number of students per teacher is 626 / 36 = 17. So, there are 17 students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Additionally, we know that there are 772 teachers in the school. Therefore, the total number of people (students + teachers) in the school is 624 + 772 = 1396.
Response:  If there are 402 girls more than the number of boys in that school, then...
Response:  If there are 458 male students in the school and 692 girls, then the total number of students is 458 + 692 = 1140. So, there are 1140 students in the school.
Response:  We have 362 boys and 257 girls in school initially. If 403 more girls join the school, then the total number of girls will be: 257 + 403 = 659 girls. So, there are 659 - 362 = 297 more girls than boys in the school now.
Response:  If $18 was in Edwar...
Response:  At first, Edward had $13 and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, Edward spent $10 ($13 - $3).
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $9 dollars and then he added $8 more to it, so now he has $17 dollars. So, before adding $8, Edward had $9 - $9 = $0 dollars.
Response:  We know that $ 16 was spent to buy 92 books initially. So each book cost $ 0.18. Now there is $ 6 left after selling some of the books. Therefore, the number of books sold = $ 6 / $ 0.18 = 34 books were sold.
Response:  We know that Edward paid $6 for one book and now he has $12. So, if we divide $12 by $6, we get the number of books he bought: $12 / $6 = 2. Therefore, Edward bought 2 books.
Response:  We know that $6 was spent to buy Edward's books and $16 was spent to buy his calculators. So far, we have spent a total of $22. Now, there are $19 left after buying these items. Therefore, before buying any of these items, Edward had $19.
Response:  We know that $4 was spent on Edward Kitap and $3 was spent on Kalemler. So, total amount spent = $4 + $3 = $7. Now we have $12 left after spending. Therefore, the amount spent on Edward Kitap and Kalemler is $7.
Response:  Firstly, $16 was spent on Edward Kitaplar and $8 was spent on Kalemler. So, total amount spent = $16 + $8 = $24. Now, there is $19 left. To find out how much more was spent on Edward Kitaplar than on Kalemler, we need to subtract the amount spent on Kalemler from the remaining amount: ($19 - $8) = $11. Therefore, $11 more was spent on Edward Kitaplar than on Kalemler.
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $17 dollars and then he received $10 from his friend. So now he has $27 dollars. Then he spent $7 dollars. Therefore, Edward's initial amount was $17 + $10 - $7 = $10.
Response:  We know that Zachary has scored 44 points in sports class today and David has scored 58 points more than Zachary. So, David has scored 58 + 44 = 102 points in total. Therefore, Zachary and David together have scored 44 + 102 = 146 points.
Response:  We know that Zachary scored 51 points and David scored 44 points. To find out how many more points Zachary scored than David, we need to subtract David's score from Zachary's score: 51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachary scored 7 more points than David.
Response:  We know that David has given 44 punches and Zachary gave more than 35 punches but less than 44 punches. So, we can say that Zachary gave exactly 9 more punches than David. Therefore, the number of punches given by Zachary is 44 + 9 = 53 punches.
Response:  We know that David has scored 51 points in sports class today and Zachary has scored 49 points less than him. So, Zachary has scored 51 - 49 = 2 points. Therefore, both of them together have scored 51 + 2 = 53 points.
Response:  We know that Zachary has scored 59 points and David has scored 19 more than Zachary. So, David has scored 59 + 19 = 78 points.
Response:  We know that Zachary has scored 44 points and made 17 shots. So, he has scored an average of 2.56 points per shot (44/17). Now, we need to find out how many shots David took. According to the question, David took 29 more shots than Zachary. Therefore, David took a total of 29 + 17 = 46 shots. Since David scored 29 more points than Zachary, David scored a total of 46 x 29 = 1304 points.
Response:  We know that Zachary has scored 53 points and made 14 shots. David has scored 17 more points than Zachary but made fewer shots than him. So, we can say that David has scored 53 + 17 = 70 points and made 14 + 10 = 24 shots. Therefore, Zachary has scored 53 points and made 14 shots.
Response:  We know that David made 35 shots and scored 3 points, so his shooting percentage is (3/35) x 100 = 9%.  Now we are told that Zachary made 35 shots as well but scored only 26 points, which means he has a lower shooting percentage than David (26/35) x 100 = 74%.  However, we are also given that Zachary scored 87 more points than David did, which means he must have taken 87 more shots than David did. So if David took 35 shots, then Zachary took 35 + 87 = 122 shots. Therefore, Zachary kicked out 122 - 35 = 87 baskets from the hoop.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 46 exercises and lost 58 kg.  David did more than 38 additional exercises but still lost less weight than Zachary. So, we can say that David did at least 38 + 46 = 84 exercises in total. Now, let's calculate how much weight Zachary lost compared to David:  Weight loss of Zachary = Total number of exercises done by Zachary - Total number of exercises done by David Total number of exercises done by Zachary = 46 Exercises done by David = 84 Exercises done by Zachary - Exercises done by David = 46 - 84 = -38 Exercises done by Zachary is negative because David did more exercises than Zachary. Therefore, the answer is 38.
Response:  We know that Zachary has scored 19 points in sports class today. David has scored more than Zachary, so he must have scored at least 19 + 3 = 22 points. Since John David has scored fewer points than David, he must have scored less than or equal to 22 - 13 = 9 points. Therefore, David scored 22 points.
Response:  We know that Zachary has 51 marbles and David has 73 marbles more than Zachary. So, David has 124 marbles (51 + 73). Now we are told that David gave away 22 marbles to someone else. Therefore, John must have received 22 marbles from David. Since John had 4 fewer marbles than David, John has 96 marbles (124 - 22 - 4 = 96).
Response:  We know that Zachary has 15 marbles and David has 39 more than Zachary. So, David has 54 marbles (39 + 15). Now we are told that John has 9 fewer marbles than David. Therefore, John has 45 marbles (54 - 9). Finally, we are asked how many more marbles Zachary has than John. Since Zachary has 15 marbles and John has 45 marbles, Zachary has 30 more marbles than John (15 + 30 = 45).
Response:  According to the question, David has scored 30 more points than Zachary in sports today. So, if David scored 37 points, then Zachary must have scored 37 - 30 = 7 points. Therefore, Zachary scored 7 points less than David.
Response:  According to the question, David has scored 56 more points than Zachary did in sports class today. If David scored 38 points, then Zachary scored 18 points less than David (56 - 38 = 18). Therefore, David and Zachary together scored 74 points (38 + 18 = 74).
"Response:  According to the question, Zachary made 40 more shots than David did today. So, if David made x shots, then Zachary made x + 40 shots. Moreover, Zachary scored 62 points and David scored 34 points. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x + (x + 40) = 34
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
2x + 40 = 34
Subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation, we get:
2x = 9
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:
x = 4
So, David made 40 more shots than Zachary did today."
Response:  According to the question, David scored 36 more points than Zachary in sports today. So, if Zachary scored 58 points and David scored 36 more points, then David scored 94 points (58 + 36 = 94). Therefore, Zachary scored 33 fewer points than David.
Response:  According to the question, David scored 27 more points than Zachary in sports today. So, if Zachary scored 17 points, then David scored 27 - 17 = 10 points more than Zachary. Therefore, Zachary scored 17 + 10 = 27 points.
Response:  If Rachel had 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework, then she had a total of 7 pages of homework (5 + 2 = 7). So, there are 3 more pages of homework than what Rachel had to do (7 - 3 = 4). Therefore, the answer is 4 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading comprehension homework. So in total, she completed 3 + 4 = 7 pages of homework. Therefore, Rachel has completed more than 7 pages of reading comprehension homework than math homework.
Response:  If Rachel has completed 5 pages of math homework and needs to complete an additional 2 pages, then she has a total of 7 pages to complete. So, if she completes each page of reading comprehension homework in average time of x minutes, then she will need to spend (7/x) minutes on each page of reading comprehension homework.
Response:  If Rachel has completed 7 pages of her math homework and needs to read 4 more pages beyond that, then she needs to read an additional 4 x 7 = 28 pages. Therefore, the answer is 28 pages.
Response:  If Rachel completed 8 pages of her math homework and needs to submit an additional 3 pages more than what she has already submitted, then the total number of pages she needs to submit is 8 + 3 = 11 pages.
Response:  If Rachel completed 8 pages of her math homework, and she has to read 6 more pages beyond that, then we need to find out how many total pages she needs to read. So, the total number of pages = 8 + 6 = 14 pages. Therefore, Rachel needs to read 14 pages of her math homework.
"Response:  If Rachel completed 10 pages of her math homework, and she has to read 3 more pages than that, then...

So, in total, Rachel needs to read 13 pages (10 + 3)."
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 2 pages of math homework, 3 pages of reading comprehension, and 10 pages of biology homework. To find out how many pages she needs to complete in total, we can multiply the number of pages for each subject: 2 x 4 = 8 (math), 3 x 5 = 15 (reading), and 10 x 6 = 60 (biology). Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 8 + 15 + 60 = 93 pages in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel completed 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework.  Therefore, she has completed a total of 9 + 2 = 11 pages of homework.  Now, we are asked how many more pages she would have to complete if she had done 96 pages of biology homework instead of 11 pages. So, the difference between the number of pages she actually did (11) and the number of pages she would have done if she had done 96 pages (85) is equal to the number of additional pages she would have to complete: 85 - 11 = 74 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. She also completed 3 pages of biology homework. So in total, she completed 11 + 2 = 13 pages of homework. Therefore, she has done more than 3 pages of math homework than biology homework.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 7 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. She also completed 8 pages of biology homework. So in total, she completed 7 + 11 = 18 pages of homework. Therefore, she had to complete at least 8 - 18 = -10 pages more than the number of pages she completed for biology homework.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. She also completed 29 pages of biology homework. To find out how many pages she has left to complete in each subject, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages she has already completed. For math, this means dividing 30 (the total number of pages) by 9 (the number of pages she has already completed), which gives us 3.33 pages remaining to complete. For reading comprehension, this means dividing 40 (the total number of pages) by 11 (the number of pages she has already completed), which gives us 3.64 pages remaining to complete. And for biology, this means dividing 50 (the total number of pages) by 29 (the number of pages she has already completed), which gives us 1.72 pages remaining to complete. So, according to these calculations, Rachel has approximately 3-4 pages remaining to complete in each of the three subjects.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had 8 math problems and 7 reading comprehension problems in total. Since there are 3 biology questions, we can conclude that she had 3 + 8 = 11 problems in total. Therefore, Rachel had 11/2 = 5.5 problems in each subject (math and biology) to complete.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 5 math problems, and each problem requires her to read 4 pages of material. Therefore, she needs to read a total of 20 pages (5 x 4 = 20). Now, we also know that she has to complete 3 biology assignments, and each assignment requires her to read 3 pages of material. So, she needs to read a total of 9 pages for biology (3 x 3 = 9). In summary, Rachel needs to read a total of 29 pages (20 + 9 = 29) to complete all of her assignments.
Response:  If Rachel had to read two pages of math homework and four pages of reading comprehension, then she would have read a total of six pages (2 + 4 = 6).
"Response:  We know that Rachel completed 4 pages of reading assignments, 7 pages of math homework, and 19 pages of biology homework. To find out how many more pages of math homework she had to complete than reading assignments, we can subtract the number of pages of reading assignments from the total number of pages of homework:

Total number of pages of homework = 4 + 7 + 19 = 30
Number of pages of math homework = Total number of pages of homework - Number of pages of reading assignments
= 30 - 4
= 26
Therefore, Rachel had to complete 26 more pages of math homework than reading assignments."

Response:  Jack received 3 emails after noon and 4 more emails in the evening, so he received a total of 7 emails that day. If we add this to the number of emails he received earlier (3), then Jack received a total of 10 emails that day. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  On Saturday (Sabah), Jack received 3 emails and made 64 responses. Then he received 5 more emails after that. So in total, Jack received 8 (3 + 5) emails on Saturday.
Response:  On Saturday (Sabah), Jack received 5 emails and 6 messages. After that, he received 9 more emails and 7 more messages. So in total, Jack received 14 emails (5 + 9) and 13 messages (6 + 7). Therefore, Jack received 14 emails and 13 messages on that day.
Response:  On Saturday morning (bu sabah), Jack received 10 emails and then he didn't receive any email for 3 hours (öğleden sonra). So during this time period of 3 hours, Jack received 3 more emails, which means he received a total of 13 emails after the break (Jack sabah öğleden sonra aldığından kaç tane daha fazla e-posta aldı = 13).
Response:  On Monday morning (Jack bu sabah), he received 6 emails and 8 messages. Then after that, he received 2 more emails and 7 more messages. So in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails and 8 + 7 = 15 messages. Therefore, from Monday afternoon to Tuesday morning, Jack received 8 more emails and 15 more messages.
Response:  On Monday, Jack sent 6 emails and then he didn't send any more until Tuesday when he sent 2 emails. Then on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, he sent 91, 85, 70, and 63 emails respectively. Therefore, in total, Jack sent 6 + 2 + 91 + 85 + 70 + 63 = 495 emails during the week. So, Jack sent 495 emails during the week.
Response:  Firstly, Jack sent 4 emails and then he received 2 replies. So, in total, Jack sent 4 + 2 = 6 emails. Then, after that, he sent 8 more emails. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack sent during one day is 6 + 8 = 14 emails.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 9 emails in total. If he received 7 emails before noon and then some more after noon, that means he received a total of 9 emails. So, Jack received 2 emails after noon.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails after noon and 5 emails before noon. So he received a total of 8 emails that day. Now, if we assume that Jack received more than 8 emails after noon, then he must have received at least 9 emails in total (8 + x) where 'x' is the number of additional emails he received after noon. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails after noon and 6 emails before noon, then he received a total of 9 emails that day. So, if he received 10 emails in all, he must have received 1 email before noon and 9 emails after noon. Therefore, Jack received 10 - 1 = 9 emails after noon.
Response:  If cekirge ran 9 seconds faster than kurbağa and kurbağa ran 12 seconds faster than cekirge, then we can say that kurbağa ran x seconds faster than cekirge. Since cekirge ran 9 seconds faster than kurbağa, we can write an equation as follows: x = 9. Now, we know that kurbağa ran 12 seconds faster than cekirge, so we can substitute this value in the previous equation to get: x + 9 = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 3. Therefore, kurbağa ran 3 seconds faster than cekirge.
Response: Çekirge atladı 31 santim, and Kurbağa atladı 35 santim. So, in total they atladı 31 + 35 = 66 santim.
Response: Çekirge has scored 36 inches and Kurbağa has scored 17 inches more than Çekirge. So, Kurbağa has scored 36 + 17 = 53 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Çekirge has thrown 25 inches. Then, we are told that Kurbağa threw 18 inches more than Çekirge and Faré threw 2 inches less than Kurbağa. So, the total distance thrown by Faré is:  Distance = 18 + (-2) = 16 inches. Therefore, Faré threw 16 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Çekirge has scored 19 inches. Then, we are told that Kurbağa has scored 10 inches more than Çekirge and Faré has scored 20 inches more than Kurbağa. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Çekirge = x + 10 (where x is the score of Kurbağa)  And also, Faré = x + 20 (where x is the score of Kurbağa). Now, we have two equations with two unknown variables. We can solve this system of linear equations using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving for x, we get: x = 14 In conclusion, Faré scored 39 inches more than Çekirge.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Çekirge has scored 19 inches. Then, according to the problem statement, Kurbağa is 39 inches higher than Çekirge. Therefore, the distance between Çekirge and Kurbağa is 39 + 19 = 58 inches. Now, we are asked how much Fare is above Kurbağa. According to the problem statement, Fare is 94 inches above Kurbağa. So, the distance between Kurbağa and Fare is 94 - 58 = 36 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Chekige moved forward 25 inches and then Kurdagh moved forward 32 inches beyond Checkige. So, the distance between Checkige and Kurdagh is 32 - 25 = 8 inches. Now, we are asked how far Fare moved from Kurdagh. Since Fare moved away from Kurdagh by 26 inches, it means that Fare moved a total distance of 26 + 8 = 34 inches away from Kurdagh. Therefore, Fare moved 34 inches away from Kurdagh.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Çekirge has moved 24 inches forward. Then, we are told that Kurbağa has moved 33 inches more than Çekirge. So, the distance traveled by Kurbağa is 33 + 24 = 57 inches. Finally, we are given that Fare has moved 5 inches less than Kurbağa. Therefore, the distance traveled by Fare is 57 - 5 = 52 inches.
Response: Çekirge has scored 13 inches and then advanced 2 inches further. So, Çekirge is now 15 inches ahead (13 + 2 = 15). Now, we need to find out how far behind Kurbağa was initially. According to the question, Kurbağa was 17 inches behind Çekirge. Therefore, the final distance between Çekirge and Kurbağa is: 15 - 17 = -2 inches.
Response: Çekirge atladı 35 inç. Çekirge, çekirgeye göre 10 santim daha ileri atladı, so 45 inci atladı. Therefore, they totalled 80 inches (45 + 35).
Response: Çekirge has scored 19 inches and is ahead of Kurbağa by 10 inches. Fare is ahead of Kurbağa by 20 inches. So, the total score of Kurbağa is: 10 + 20 = 30 inches. Therefore, Kurbağa scored 30 inches.
Response: Çekirge has scored 39 inches and Kurbağa has scored 19 inches more than Çekirge. Therefore, Kurbağa has scored 58 inches (39 + 19). Now, we know that Faré has scored 12 inches less than Kurbağa. So, Faré has scored 46 inches (58 - 12).
Response: Çekirge has scored 21 inches more than Kurbağa and 16 inches less than Fare. So, if we compare Çekirge with Fare, Çekirge is 47 inches (21 + 16) higher than Fare.
Response:  If Kurbağa ran 39 seconds faster than Çekirge, then Çekirge ran for (39 - x) seconds where x is the time taken by Kurbağa to complete the race. Since Kurbağa completed the race in 17 seconds less than Çekirge, we can write an equation as follows:  39 = x + 17  Now solve for x using subtraction: x = 22 Therefore, Kurbağa ran 22 seconds faster than Çekirge.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Çekirge scored 9 inches more than Fare. So, if Fare scored x inches, then Çekirge scored x + 9 inches.  Secondly, we know that Kurbağa scored 10 inches less than Fare. So, if Fare scored x inches, then Kurbağa scored x - 10 inches. Now, we have two equations:  x + 9 = x + 10 (from the first equation) and x - 10 = x (from the second equation). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 7 inches. Therefore, Fare scored 7 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Çekirge scored 14 inches more than Kurbağa. So, Çekirge scored 14 + 16 = 30 inches. Now, we are asked how much more did Fare score than Çekirge. Therefore, Fare scored (37 - 30) = 7 inches more than Çekirge.
Response:  We know that Mary has cooked 14 pounds of pasta and needs 6 cups of sugar to make it sweet enough for her guests. She already used 5 cups of sugar. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs. To do this, we can divide the amount of sugar needed (6 cups) by the amount of sugar used so far (5 cups): 6/5 = 1.2. This means that Mary needs 1.2 additional cups of sugar to sweeten all 14 pounds of pasta.
"Response: 
Mary has cooked 3 cups of pasta (9/4 = 2.25). She wants to add 1 cup of sugar (11 - 4 = 7). So, there are 7 cups of sugar left after adding 3 cups of sugar. Therefore, there are 4 cups of sugar left (7 - 3 = 4)."
Response:  If Mary wants to make 6 cups of pasta and she has 13 cups of sugar, then she needs to add some more sugar if she wants to have 8 cups more than what she currently has. So, we need to calculate how many additional cups of sugar she needs:  Number of additional cups = Total amount of sugar needed - Current amount of sugar  In this case, the total amount of sugar needed is 8 cups (since Mary wants to have 8 cups more than her current amount) and her current amount of sugar is 13 cups. Therefore, the number of additional cups of sugar needed is:  Additional cups of sugar needed = 8 - 13 = -5 cups  Since Mary cannot have negative cups of sugar, we can conclude that she needs 5 cups of sugar more.
Response:  If Mary needs 11 cups of pasta and she has already cooked 7 cups, then she still needs 4 more cups (11 - 7 = 4). Now, if she adds just a little bit more than half of the remaining amount (i.e., 4/2 = 2), then she will have enough sugar for all her pasta (2 + 7 = 9). So, Mary needed to add 9 cups of sugar to her pasta.
"Response: 
Mary has already cooked 11 cups of pasta and wants to add more sugar. She needs at least 4 more cups for a total of 15 cups. If she adds 3 cups more, it will be 18 cups in total. So, if she still needs 6 more cups after adding 3 cups, then the number of cups needed is 6 / 3 = 2 cups. Therefore, the answer is 2 cups."
Response:  If Mary wants to make 12 portions of pasta and she needs 5 portions of sugar, then she will need 7 more portions of sugar (12 - 5 = 7). So if she already added a little bit of sugar, she will need 6 more portions of sugar (7 - 1 = 6). Therefore, Mary will need 6 portions of sugar in total.
Response:  Mary has already cooked 9 cups of pasta and wants to add another cup. She needs 5 cups more sugar than what she has already added (which is 3 cups). So, in total, Mary needs 14 cups of sugar (9 + 5 = 14).
"Response:  Mary has taken out 10 fincan of pasta and wants to add 14 fincan of sugar. She added 2 fincan of sugar initially. To find out how many more bardak (bottles) of sugar she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she already added from the total amount of sugar she wants to add:

14 - 2 = 12
So, Mary needs to add 12 more bardak (bottles) of sugar."
Response:  We know that Mary has already cooked 12 cups of pasta and needs another cup to make it 13 cups in total. So, we need to find out how many cups are left after she added 5 cups of sugar and 49 cups of salt. As there are 11 cups of pasta remaining after she added the sugar and salt, we can deduce that Mary needs to add 1 more cup of pasta to reach her target of 13 cups. Therefore, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  We know that Mary has cooked 10 pounds of pasta and needs 2 pounds of sugar and 80 pounds of salt to finish it. She already has 7 pounds of sugar. So, we need to find out how many more pounds of sugar she needs. To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar she already has from the total amount needed: 7 pounds - 2 pounds = 5 pounds. Therefore, Mary needs an additional 5 pounds of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has cooked 12 pounds of pasta and needs 14 pounds of sugar and 7 pounds of salt to make it. She already added 2 pounds of sugar. So, we need to calculate how much more sugar she needs. To do this, we divide the remaining amount (14 - 12 = 2) by the weight of one pound of sugar (16 oz / lb). Therefore, Mary needs an additional 32 oz (2/16) or approximately 2 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already cooked 5 cans of sauce and she needs 3 more cans to complete her task. So, we need 3 + 5 = 8 cans of sauce in total. Since there are 12 cans in a pound, we need 8 / 12 = 0.67 pounds (or approximately 1/1.67 pounds) of sugar. Therefore, the answer is 1 pound and 1.67 pounds of sugar.
"Response:  Mary has cooked 12 pounds of pasta and wants to add 13 pounds of sugar. Even if she adds two cups of sugar, it is still not enough to make up for the difference in weight between the two quantities. Therefore, the correct answer is:

$ \boxed{4} $ bardak şeker daha eklemesi gerekiyor."
Response:  Mary has cooked 9 cups of pasta and wants to add 6 cups of sugar. She added 4 cups of sugar initially. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she already added from the total amount of sugar she wants to add. So, the answer is: 6 - 4 = 2 cups of sugar needed to be added.
"Response: 
Mary has already cooked 6 cups of pasta and wants to add more sugar. She needs 9 cups of sugar in total. If she added 2 cups too much, then... 
So, we need to subtract 2 cups from the total amount of sugar needed (9 - 2 = 7). Therefore, there are 7 cups of excess sugar."
"Response: 
Mary has cooked 3 cups of pasta (5 + 14 = 19). She added 5 spoons of sugar and took out 11 spoons. So, there are 8 spoons of sugar left (19 - 11 = 8)."
"Response: 
Mary wants to make 3 servings of pasta and she needs 10 cups of sugar for that. If she adds a little bit more than necessary, then she will have enough sugar for all three servings. So, if she needs 10 cups of sugar for 3 servings, then she will need 3 x 10 = 30 cups of sugar in total.  Therefore, Mary should add 30 cups of sugar."
Response:  If Mary wants to make 13 cups of pasta and she has already made 5 cups, then she needs to make an additional 8 cups (13 - 5 = 8). However, if she adds just a little bit more than half of the remaining amount (8 / 2 = 4), then she will have exactly 12 cups left over after making all 13 cups (12 + 4 = 16). So, Mary should add 4 cups of flour to make 13 cups of pasta.
Response:  Mary has already cooked 6 cups of pasta and wants to add another cup. She currently has 7 cups of sugar and needs 14 cups more. If she added one more cup of sugar, how much would that be in total? So, the answer is 1 + 7 = 8 cups of sugar needed.
Response:  Mary has already cooked 11 cups of pasta and wants to add another cup (12th). She currently has 9 cups of sugar and needs 1 more cup to complete her recipe. So, in total, she needs 13 cups of sugar (11 + 9 = 13).
"Response: 
Mary has already cooked 3 cups of pasta and needs 10 more cups to make it 15 cups in total. She added 6 cups so far. To find out how many more cups she needs, we can subtract the amount she added from the total amount needed:

15 - 6 = 9
So, Mary needs 9 more cups of sauce."
"Response: 
Mary has to prepare 9 cups of pasta and she has 14 cups of sugar. She also needs 40 cups of salt and she added 4 cups of sugar already. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add.  To do this, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added (4) from the total amount needed (40). Therefore, Mary needs an additional 36 cups of sugar."
Response:  We know that Mary has already put 2 cups of sugar (7 fincan) and 4 cups of salt (un). Now we need to calculate how much more salt she needs to add to make 9 cups of pasta. So, we subtract 4 cups from 9 cups, which gives us 5 cups (5 fincan). Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of salt to her pasta.
Response:  We know that Mary has cooked 11 cups of pasta and needs 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of salt to finish it off. She already added 12 cups of sauce. So, we need to calculate how much more sugar she needs to add. To do this, we divide the total amount of sugar needed (6 cups) by the amount of sauce she already added (12 cups): 6/12 = 0.5 or  half cup of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs half a cup of extra sugar to complete her pasta dish.
Response:  Mary has already put 4 cups of sugar (which is equal to 32 teaspoons). To find out how many more teaspoons she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount she wants (7 cups - 4 cups = 3 cups). So, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar.
Response:  Mary has taken 10 cans of sugar out of 12 cans she wanted to take (10/12 = 0.83). So, she still needs to take 2 more cans of sugar (2/12 = 0.17) to fulfill her desired amount. Therefore, there are 2 more cans of sugar that Mary needs to take.
Response:  If 60 küçük kuş ailesi (bird families) have left their homes and migrated to warmer climates, then there are currently 19 bird families remaining in the nearby mountains. If 60% of these birds migrate, that means 11 bird families (60/19 = 58%) will leave their homes. So, out of the total 60 bird families, 49 families (19 + 30) will remain in the nearby mountains during winter.
Response:  If 7 kuş ailesi (bird families) left their nest during winter and went to warmer places, then there would be less birds in the area where they lived before. So, if 87 kuş ailesi (bird families) still live in that area, it means that there are 80 kuş ailesi (bird families) fewer than before. Therefore, the answer is 80.
Response:  We know that out of 20 kuş ailesi (bird families) that went to the mountain, only 14 came back. So, we can say that 6 kuş ailesi (bird families) did not come back from the mountain. Therefore, there were 6 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  If 23 kuş ailesi went to Africa and 37 kuş ailesi went to Asia, then in the vicinity of the mountain, there would be 85 - (23 + 37) = 45 kuş ailesi left. Therefore, there are 45 kuş ailesi left in the vicinity of the mountain after some birds migrated to Africa and Asia.
Response:  If 42 birds from Europe migrate to Africa and 31 birds from Europe migrate to Asia, then the total number of birds that migrated to Africa is 42 + 31 = 73. Therefore, there are more birds in Africa than in Asia.
Response:  According to the question, 38 bird families are living in the nearby mountains. Of these, 47 bird families have migrated to Africa and 94 bird families have migrated to Asia. So, the number of bird families that have migrated from the nearby mountains to Africa is 47 - 38 = 19. Similarly, the number of bird families that have migrated from the nearby mountains to Asia is 94 - 38 = 56. Therefore, the answer is 19 + 56 = 75 bird families.
"Response:  If 38 birds from Europe migrate to Africa and 80 birds from Europe migrate to Asia, then we have:

Migrated birds in Africa = 38 x 18 = 672 birds
Migrated birds in Asia = 80 x 18 = 1440 birds
Total number of birds that did not migrate = Total number of birds - Migrated birds
= 18 x 100 = 1800 birds
Therefore, 1800 birds did not migrate for the winter season."
Response:  If there are currently 87 kuş ailesi in the area near the mountain and 18 new kuş ailesi join them, then the total number of kuş ailesi in the area will be: 87 + 18 = 105 kuş ailesi. So, there are now 105 kuş ailesi living in the area near the mountain.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, there were initially 49 bird families living near the mountain. Then, 59 birds from these families migrated to warmer climates. Finally, 24 new bird families arrived at the mountain from Northern Kurdistan. So, the number of bird families that remained near the mountain after all this migration is:  
$ \text { Initially } = 49 $  
$ \text { Migrated } = 59 $  
$ \text { New arrivals } = 24 $  
Therefore, the total number of bird families remaining near the mountain after all this migration is:  
$$ \boxed{ 73 } $$"
Response:  We know that 27 birds from one family migrated to another country and 41 bird families are currently living nearby. So, if we subtract 41 from 27, we get 16. Therefore, 16 bird families remained in the original country after migration.
Response:  We know that 86 birds from one family migrated to another country and 45 bird families are still in the nearby mountains. So, we need to find out how many bird families did not migrate. To do this, we will divide the total number of bird families (131) by the number of bird families that migrated (86). Therefore, 45 bird families did not migrate.
Response:  According to the question, most of the animals have migrated to warmer climates and only 41 bird families remain in the nearby mountains. Of these 41 bird families, 35 families have migrated to Asia, while 62 families have migrated to Africa. So, the number of bird families that have migrated to Africa is 62 - 35 = 27.
Response:  We know that 3 families of birds are living in the vicinity of the mountain.  When 26 new bird families migrated to the area from the north, they settled in the nearby mountains.  As a result, there were 3 + 26 = 29 bird families living near the mountain. So, the number of bird families that remained in the mountain was 3 - 29 = -26. Therefore, there were -26 bird families remaining in the mountain after the migration.
Response:  We know that Paul has collected 253 stamps in total and he sold 70 of them during his school year. So, the number of stamps left with him is = Total stamps - Number of stamps sold = 253 - 70 = 183 stamps. Therefore, the number of albums filled with stamps is equal to the number of stamps left with Paul, which is 183.
Response:  If Paul was born on January 1st and he collected 551 sticks of wood in his first year (2018), then he must have collected 374 sticks of wood in his second year (2019) since he only had 177 days left after collecting 551 sticks in his first year. So, Paul collected 374 + 177 = 551 sticks of wood in total during his two years.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 440 pieces of pasta to his classmates throughout the year. If he lost 106 of them, then we can calculate how many he has left as follows: Number of remaining pasta = Total number of pasta given - Number of pasta lost = 440 - 106 = 334 So, Paul has 334 pieces of pasta left.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 213 pencils to his classmates throughout the year and 16 of them are missing. So, we have 213 - 16 = 207 pencils left. Since he got 65 pencils on his birthday, we can say that he has 207 + 65 = 272 pencils in total.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 589 pencils in total and lost 161 of them. So he has 428 pencils left. Now we need to find out how many more pencils he gave away than he lost. To do this, we can subtract the number of pencils he lost from the total number of pencils he gave away: 428 - 161 = 267. Therefore, Paul gave away 267 more pencils than he lost.
Response:  If Paul gave away 110 pencils and lost 412 of them, then he has 718 pencils left (110 - 412 = 718). So, his friends have received more than twice as many pencils from him as they have given back to him.
Response:  If Paul gave away 563 pens to his classmates throughout the year and lost 558 of them, then he has 7 (563 - 558) remaining pens left. Now, if only 332 pens were given out on his birthday, then the number of pens he received on his birthday is equal to the number of pens he had left after giving away all the others, which is 7. Therefore, Paul received 7 pens on his birthday.
Response:  If Paul gave away 52 pens to his classmates every year and lost 535 in total, then he must have given away at least 492 pens (52 x years = 492). So, there are 492 - 535 = 83 pens that were either given away or lost. Therefore, the answer is 83.
Response:  We know that Paul has 521 pencils and he gives away 66 of them without using any of them. So, after giving away 66 pencils, he has 521 - 66 = 455 pencils left. Now, we are asked how many pencils Paul gave away in total. Since he gave away 154 pencils during the school year, we can say that the number of pencils he gave away is equal to the number of days in the school year minus the number of pencils he kept for himself (which is 0 since he didn't use any). Therefore, the number of pencils Paul gave away is:  Days in the school year = 365  Number of pencils given away = 365 - 154 = 211 pencils.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 531 pieces of spaghetti and lost 38 pieces. So he has 493 pieces left. Then we are asked how many pieces he would have if he didn't lose any more. Therefore, the number of pieces he has after losing 391 pieces is equal to the total number of pieces he had initially minus the number of pieces he lost while he still had them all (i.e., before he lost the last 391 pieces). This gives us:

Number of remaining pieces = 493 - 391 = 102
So there were 102 pieces of spaghetti left in Paul's bag after he lost 391 pieces."
Response:  We know that Paul had 601 boxes of pasta and gave away 406 of them. So he has 601 - 406 = 195 boxes left. Now we are asked how many silgis (or cookies) he has after giving away just one silgi. Therefore, if he has 195 boxes of pasta left, and he gives away only one silgi, then he will have 195 - 1 = 194 boxes of pasta left, which is the correct answer.
Response:  We know that Paul got 291 kalems in total and lost or gave away 124 of them. So, he had 291 - 124 = 167 kalems left. Now we are asked how many kalems Paul got on his birthday. Since he only received 167 kalems overall, he must have gotten 0 kalems on his birthday. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  If Paul gave away 308 pieces of candy to his friends and he had 267 pieces left after giving some away, then he must have started with 267 + 308 = 575 pieces of candy. So, he gave away 575 - 267 = 308 pieces of candy to his friends.
Response:  We know that Paul has 457 marbles and gives away 173 of them to his friend. So he now has 457 - 173 = 284 marbles left. Then, he loses 106 marbles from this remaining amount, so he is left with 284 - 106 = 178 marbles. Finally, he gives away 52 more marbles, leaving him with 178 - 52 = 126 marbles. Therefore, there are 126 pastel colored pencils in the box.
Response:  At first, there were 11 customers in total. Then, some of them left and only 3 remained. So, we need to find out how many more customers left than remained. To do this, we can subtract the number of remaining customers from the initial number of customers: 11 - 3 = 8. Therefore, 8 more customers left than remained.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 customers (A, B, and C). After some of them left, there were 4 customers (D, E, F, and G). So, the number of additional customers is: 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, 1 more customer joined after some of the initial customers left.
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers. After they left, 12 new customers arrived. So, initially, there were 9 + 12 = 21 customers. Therefore, at the beginning, there were 21 customers.
Response:  We know that 14 customers initially visited the store and 5 of them left without buying anything. So, the number of customers who bought something is 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, 9 customers purchased something from the store.
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 customers and after one customer left, 4 new customers arrived. So, now we have 13 - 1 = 12 customers remaining. If 9 customers remain, then the number of customers who left is 9 - 12 = -3 customers. Therefore, 3 customers left.
Response:  At first, there were 12 customers. Then, 15 customers left and 14 new customers joined. So, the total number of customers now is: 12 + (15 - 14) = 12 + 1 = 13 customers. Therefore, 1 customer remained after 15 customers left.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 customers and then 5 more customers arrived, making a total of 8 customers. So, new customers who arrived = 5.
Response:  At first, there were 8 customers. Some of them left and only 5 remained. Then, 99 new customers joined. So, the total number of customers after the new customers arrived is: 5 + 99 = 104 customers. Therefore, 6 customers left (104 - 8 = 6).
"Response:  At first, there were 12 customers. Some of them left, so now there are 14 customers. Then, 10 new customers joined. So, currently, there are 

Answer: 14 + 10 = 24 customers."
Response:  If he got $2 in sugar at the beginning and then lost $1, so he had $2 - $1 = $1 left. Then, if he lost another $1, he had $1 - $1 = $0 left. So, initially he had $1.
Response:  If Dan has $4 and gives $1 as a tip, then he has $3 left ($4 - $1 = $3). So, the amount of money that Dan gave as a tip is $1.
Response:  We have $4 and we buy 99 pieces of candy for $3 each. So, in total, we spent $3 x 99 = $297. Now, let's see how much money we have left after buying all those candies. We started with $4, so if we spend $297, then we are left with $4 - $297 = $-293. Therefore, we have lost $293.
Response:  We have $3 and we want to buy two chocolates that cost $4 each. So, in total, we need $8. Now, since there are three of us, we can split the $8 equally among ourselves, which means each person will get $2.67 ($8 / 3). Therefore, the price of each chocolate is $2.67.
Response:  We know that Dan has $2 and he bought 3 pieces of candy for $6. So, we can write an equation as follows:  $2 + $3 = $6. Now, let's solve this equation to find out how many pieces of candy Dan bought. To do this, we need to subtract $3 from both sides of the equation: $2 + $3 - $3 = $6 - $3. Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation gives us: $2 = $3. Therefore, Dan bought 3 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Dan has $7 and he spends $2 for chocolate, then he has $7 - $2 = $5 left.  Then, if he spends another $3 for chocolate, he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. So, the amount of money that Dan has left is $2.
"Response: 
Dan has $4 and spends $1 on candy. So he now has $4 - $1 = $3 left. 
Then he buys another piece of candy for $0.50, so he pays $0.50 + $3 = $3.50. 
Now he has $3.50 - $3 = $0.50 left. 
Finally, he buys another piece of candy for $0.60, so he pays $0.60 + $0.50 = $1.10. 
So in total, Dan spent $3.50 + $1.10 = $4.60."
"Response: 
Dan has $2 and spends $1 on candy. So he has $2 - $1 = $1 left.  Then he buys ice cream for $3, so he pays $1 + $3 = $4 from his remaining balance of $1. Therefore, he now has $1 - $4 = $-3 left."
"Response: 
Dan has $5 and spends $2 on candy. So he has $5 - $2 = $3 left.  Then he spends another $3 on candy, so he has $0 left. Therefore, he spent more than he had.  So the answer is yes, he spent more than he had."
Response:  Firstly, Dan has $4. Then he buys candy for $8. So now he has $4 - $8 = $-4 left. His friend gives him $5, so now Dan has $5 + (-4) = $1.
Response:  If Dan had $3 left after buying candy, and he started with $4, then he spent $1 on candy. So, the price of the candy was $1 per piece.
Response:  We have $4 and we want to buy 10 candies with each costing $3. So, total cost of buying all these candies is: $$ \text {Total Cost} = 10 \times 3 = 30 $$ dollars. Therefore, the amount left after buying all these candies is: $$ \text{Amount Left} = 4 - 30 = -26 $$ dollars.
Response:  We have $3 and we want to buy 2 bottles of soda that cost $1 each. So, in total, we will spend $2 + $2 = $4.
"Response: 
Dan has $5 and spends $3 on chocolate. So he has $5 - $3 = $2 left.  Then, he spends $7 on candy. So he has $2 - $7 = $-5 left. Therefore, Dan does not have enough money to buy more candy after buying chocolate."
Response:  If Dan has $4 and spends $1 on candy, he will have $3 left. Then, if he spends another $1 on ice cream, he will have $2 left. So, in total, Dan spent $2 + $1 = $3. Therefore, Dan has more money than he had before ($3 - $1 = $2).
"Response:  We know that Paul had 115 books and he gave away 78 of them. So, the number of books left with him is:

115 - 78 = 37

Therefore, there were 37 books left with Paul after he gave away 78."
Response:  We know that Paul had 137 books and then he sold 105 of them. So initially there were 137 - 105 = 32 books left with him. Therefore, at the beginning, there were 32 books.
Response:  According to the question, Paul had 108 books in his collection initially and then bought some more books after that. He gave away 35 of them to his friend later. So, the number of books he had left is: 108 - 35 = 73 books. Therefore, Paul had 73 books in his collection after giving away 35 books to his friend.
Response:  According to the question, Paul had 50 books initially and then bought 151 more after that. So, in total, he has 201 books (50 + 151). Therefore, the answer is 201.
Response:  We know that Paul had two books and sold them in a garage sale. He then bought 150 new books. If he had 58 books left after the sale, it means he sold 92 books (150 - 58 = 92). So, Paul sold 92 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had 21 books and he bought 42 new ones at a garage sale. If he already had 15 books, then the total number of books he has now is: 21 + 42 - 15 = 68 books. So, he sold 3 more books than he originally had.
Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books and he sold 38 of them in the garage sale. So, now he has 71 - 38 = 33 books left. If there were initially 116 books, then we can find out how many more books Paul bought by subtracting the number of books he sold from the total initial number of books: 116 - 38 = 78 books. Therefore, Paul bought 78 additional books.
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and 55 pens initially. After he bought some books and pens at the garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens left. So, we can calculate how many books he bought as follows: Number of books bought = Total number of books - Remaining number of books = 108 - 66 = 42 books. Similarly, we can calculate the number of pens he bought as follows: Number of pens bought = Total number of pens - Remaining number of pens = 55 - 59 = -4 pens (since he sold more pens than he had). Therefore, Paul bought 42 books and -4 pens at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that there were initially 51 books and 106 pens in the garage. After placing 82 books and 14 pens inside, we have 39 books and 92 pens left outside. So, the number of pens placed inside is 92 - 106 = -14 pens.
Response:  We know that Paul started with 136 books and gave away 27 of them. So, he has 109 books left. Then, we are asked how many books he sold. Well, if he sold 4 books, then he has 105 books left (109 - 4 = 105). Therefore, the answer is 105.
Response:  According to the question, Paul had 134 books in total. He gave 39 of them to his friend and then sold some of them at a garage sale. So, he had 68 books left after the garage sale. Therefore, the number of books that Paul sold at the garage sale is 68 - 39 = 29.
Response:  We know that Paul had 95 books and 153 chapters in total. After he put them in the garage, 13 books and 23 chapters were left behind. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of books = Number of books left behind + Number of books taken to the garage. In this case, the total number of books is equal to 95 (books left behind) plus 13 (books taken to the garage), which gives us 108. Therefore, Paul took 97 books to the garage.
Response:  We know that Paul had 42 books and 143 chapters in total. After he added a few books and chapters to his collection, he had 113 books and 19 chapters left. So, we can calculate how many books and chapters Paul added as follows:  Books added = Total number of books - Number of books left after adding = 143 - 113 = 30 Books added Chapters added = Total number of chapters - Number of chapters left after adding = 143 - 19 = 124 Chapters added Therefore, Paul added 30 books and 124 chapters to his collection.
Response:  We know that Vasoda had 10 flowers in her bouquet initially and she gave away 6 of them to Jessica. So, now Vasoda has 4 flowers left (10 - 6 = 4). Therefore, there are 4 flowers in Vasoda's bouquet currently.
Response:  We know that there were initially 4 flowers (gul) in the basket. Then, Jessica added 16 more flowers from the garden to the basket. So, now there are total 20 flowers (gul) in the basket. Finally, we are asked how many flowers were initially in the basket. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Jessica has given 4 flowers to Vasilisa and Vasilisa had 23 flowers in total. So, if we subtract the number of flowers Vasilisa gave to Jessica (4), then we are left with the original number of flowers Vasilisa had before giving any to Jessica:  $23 - 4 = 19$ Therefore, Vasilisa originally had 19 flowers.
"Response: 
Vazoda had 15 tane of guls and gave 33 gul to Jessica. So, Vazoda has 17 - 33 = 14 guls left."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has collected 34 flowers from Vazona's garden and added them to her own collection. Then, she went back to Vazona's garden and picked another 15 flowers. So, in total, Jessica has collected 49 flowers (34 + 15). Therefore, the correct answer is 49.
Response:  We know that Vazoda had 20 guls and he gave some to Jessica. So, after giving some to Jessica, Vazoda had x - 20 guls where x is an unknown number. Now we are told that Jessica has 59 guls in total including the ones she got from Vazoda. Therefore, the difference between the total number of guls Jessica has and the number of guls Vazoda had after giving some to her is equal to the number of guls Vazoda initially had minus the number of guls he gave to Jessica: 59 - x = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 39. So, Vazoda had 39 guls left after giving some to Jessica.
Response:  We know that Vazoda had 13 guls in her garden and she took some of them to give as presents. So, after taking some away, she had 21 guls left in her garden. Now, we are asked how many guls were in the garden before she took any away. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of guls she took away (which is not given) from the total number of guls she had (which is 21). Therefore, the answer is 21 - x, where x is the number of guls she took away.
Response:  We know that Vazoda had 15 guls and 62 orchids in her garden initially. Then, Jessica took some more flowers from the garden, which included 3 guls and 4 orchids. So, now Vazoda has 17 guls and 96 orchids left in her garden. To find out how many guls Vazoda lost, we need to subtract the number of guls Jessica took from the initial number of guls Vazoda had. Therefore, the answer is: Number of guls lost = Initial number of guls - Number of guls taken = 15 - 3 = 12 guls.
Response:  We know that Vazoda had 12 guls and 2 orchids initially. Then Jessica took some more flowers from the garden, including some guls and orchids. So, we can say that Vazoda had fewer guls and orchids after Jessica took them. Specifically, Vazoda had 10 guls and 21 orchids left. Now, to find out how many orchids Jessica took, we need to subtract the number of orchids Vazoda had after Jessica took them (21) from the total number of orchids Vazoda had initially (2). Therefore, Jessica took 19 orchids.
Response:  We know that Jessica has 5 guls and 3 orchids. So, she has a total of 8 (5+3).  Now we are told that Vazoda has 12 guls and 2 orchids. Therefore, he has a total of 14 (12+2).  Since Vazoda has more than Jessica in both guls and orchids, there are more than 8 guls and more than 3 orchids in his collection.  In other words, Vazoda has at least 6 additional guls and at least 1 additional orchid compared to Jessica.
Response:  We know that Jessica took some flowers from the garden and gave them to Vasoda.  The number of flowers Vasoda had before is given as 11 guls and 20 orkides. After Jessica gave her some more flowers, Vasoda now has 11 + (number of flowers Jessica gave her) = 11 + x guls and 20 + (number of flowers Jessica gave her) = 20 + x orkides. Since Jessica gave Vasoda 3 guls and 4 orkides in total, we can write: 11 + 3 = 14 guls and 20 + 4 = 24 orkides. So, Vasoda now has 14 guls and 24 orkides. Therefore, the answer is 14 - 11 = 3 additional guls and 24 - 20 = 4 additional orkides that Vasoda received from Jessica.
Response:  We know that there are 19 guls in total and initially 3 of them were given to Jessica. So, we need to find out how many guls Jessica received. To do this, we can use subtraction. The difference between the total number of guls (19) and the number of guls Jessica received (3) is equal to the number of guls that were left behind. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  We know that Vazoda had 13 guls and 84 orchids in her garden. Jessica took some of them from the garden and gave 5 guls and 2 orchids to Vazoda. So now we have:  Vazoda has 91 orchids and 14 guls. To find out how many guls Kestin, let's divide the number of guls Vazoda has (14) by the number of guls Jessica gave him (5):  Therefore, Kestin received 2 guls.
Response:  We know that Vazoda had 16 guls and 3 orchids initially.  Jessica took some of them from the flower garden and gave them to Vazoda as well. So, let's say she gave him 5 guls and 2 orchids. Now, we have:  Vazoda has 16 + 5 = 21 guls and 3 + 2 = 5 orchids.  Then, Vazoda lost 7 orchids, so he has 5 - 7 = -2 orchids left. And he gained 13 guls, so he has 21 + 13 = 34 guls now. Therefore, Vazoda lost 2 orchids.
Response:  We know that Vazoda had 6 guls and 20 orchids in her garden initially. Then, Jessica took some more flowers from the garden, including some guls and orchids. So, after Jessica took some flowers away, Vazoda had fewer guls and orchids than before. Specifically, she had 21 orchids and 22 guls left. Now, we are asked how many more guls Vazoda has compared to what Jessica took. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of guls Jessica took (which is 4) from the total number of guls Vazoda had at first (which is 22). Therefore, there are 22 - 4 = 18 more guls in Vazoda's garden than what Jessica took.
Response:  We know that Jessica took 4 flowers and 2 gul from the garden. So, there are 13 - 4 = 9 remaining flowers in the garden. Since each flower has 3 seeds, there are 9 x 3 = 27 seeds left in the garden. Now we need to find out how many more seeds Vazoda has than Jessica. So, Vazoda has 3 + 2 = 5 more seeds than Jessica. Therefore, Vazoda has 13 + 5 = 18 seeds in total.
Response:  If Robin had 17 inches of hair and cut off half an inch, then he had 16.5 inches of hair. Now if his hair length has reduced to 13 inches, then he must have cut off 3 inches (16.5 - 13 = 3). So, Robin cut off 3 hairs.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 20 inches long and now it is 10 inches long, then we can calculate how much it used to be by subtracting the current length from the original length: 20 - 10 = 10 inches. So, before cutting, Robin's hair used to be 10 inches long.
Response:  At first, Robin had long hair that was 16 inches (40 cm) long and then it got cut to 12 inches (30 cm). So, initially, Robin had 16 x 1 = 16 inches of hair. After cutting, he had 12 x 1 = 12 inches of hair left. Therefore, Robin lost 4 inches (or 10 cm) of hair.
"Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 inches long and it grew by 1 inch each year, then after 3 years, his hair would be:

Year 1: 19 inches
Year 2: 20 inches (1 inch growth)
Year 3: 21 inches (1 inch growth)
Therefore, if Robin's hair grew by 1 inch each year for 4 years, his hair length would be:

Year 1: 19 inches
Year 2: 20 inches
Year 3: 21 inches
Year 4: 22 inches
So, Robin's hair length after 4 years of growing by 1 inch each year is 22 inches."
Response:  If Robin's hair was initially 13 inches long and now it is 14 inches long, then we can calculate the increase as follows: Increase = New length - Initial length = 14 - 13 = 1 inch So, Robin's hair has increased by 1 inch.
Response:  At first, Robin had 14 inches of hair length. Then, 8 inches were cut off, leaving him with 6 inches (14 - 8 = 6). Finally, an additional 20 inches were cut off, bringing his new length to 4 inches (6 - 20 = 4). So, Robin's hair was 4 inches long after all the cutting.
Response:  We know that there are 12 caps in Danny's collection and we found 53 caps in the park. So, to find out how many more caps are in the park than in Danny's collection, we can subtract their numbers: 53 - 12 = 41. Therefore, there are 41 additional caps in the park compared to Danny's collection.
Response:  We know that there are 21 shoe boxes in Danny's collection and he has found some more shoes outside. If there are 53 shoe boxes in total, then we can conclude that Danny has found 32 additional shoes (53 - 21 = 32). So, Danny has found 32 shoes outside.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 63 leaves in the park and he has given away 51 old leaves. So, now he has 33 leaves left in his collection. To find out how many leaves Danny had initially, we can divide the number of leaves he gave away (51) by 2 (since he gave away two old leaves for each new leaf he collected). Therefore, Danny had 25 leaves initially.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 leaves in the park and he already has 22 of them in his collection. So, how many more did he collect than what he already had?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of leaves he already had (22) from the total number of leaves he collected (36): 36 - 22 = 14 Therefore, Danny collected 14 additional leaves beyond what he already had.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 shells in the park and then he put them in his collection. Now we see that there are 42 shells in his collection. So, to find out how many more shells Danny collected than what he already had in his collection, we need to subtract the number of shells he already had (30) from the total number of shells he found (63). Therefore, the answer is:  More shells = 63 - 30 = 33
Response:  We know that Danny had 22 shish kebabs and 8 containers in his collection initially. Now he has 28 shish kebabs and 63 containers in his collection. So, to find out how many shish kebabs Danny added or collected later, we need to subtract the initial number of shish kebabs from the current total number of shish kebabs. Therefore, the answer is:  Initially, Danny had 22 shish kebabs, and now he has 28 - 22 = 6 more shish kebabs.
Response:  We know that Danny had 22 shoe boxes and 30 packages in his collection initially. Now we are told that he has 17 shoe boxes and 57 packages in his collection after adding more items. To find out how many packages Danny added, we can subtract the number of packages he already had (30) from the total number of packages he has now (57): 57 - 30 = 27. So Danny added 27 packages to his collection. Therefore, the answer is 27.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 30 capsules and 14 boxes in the park. Now he has 7 more capsules and 86 more boxes in his collection. So, the total number of capsules Danny has collected is: 30 + 7 = 37 capsules. Similarly, the total number of boxes Danny has collected is: 14 + 86 = 100 boxes. Therefore, Danny has collected 7 more capsules and 86 more boxes than what he had in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had 11 shoe boxes and 28 packages in his collection before he went to the park.  After going to the park, he found 68 shoe boxes and 51 packaging materials. So, we can calculate how many more shoeboxes Danny collected at the park as follows: Number of additional shoeboxes = Total number of shoeboxes after going to the park - Total number of shoeboxes before going to the park Additional shoeboxes = 68 - 11 = 57 Therefore, Danny collected 57 more shoeboxes at the park than he had before.
Response:  We know that Danny has already collected 71 shoe caps in the park and 24 of them are packed into his collection. Now he has 28 more shoe caps in his collection. So, the total number of shoe caps Danny has is: 71 + 28 = 99. Therefore, Danny currently has 99 shoe caps in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 10 caps in the park and 62 packages. Now he has 27 caps and 43 packages in his collection. To find out how many more caps he has than packages, we need to subtract the number of packages from the number of caps:  Number of caps - Number of packages = 27 - 43 = -16 So, Danny has 16 fewer caps than packages in his collection right now.
Response:  We know that Danny had 66 shoe boxes in his collection and lost 66 of them in the park. So he has 25 shoe boxes left in his collection now. To find out how many shoe boxes Danny had initially, we can divide the total number of shoe boxes he had (66) by the number of shoe boxes he has left (25). Therefore, Danny had 260 shoe boxes initially.
Response:  If there are 32 shisha caps in Danny's collection and he finds 25 of them in the park, then we can conclude that there are 7 (32 - 25) shisha caps left in his collection after finding the ones in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 60 old newspapers in the park and found 58 new ones. So, the total number of newspapers he has now is 60 + 58 = 118. Therefore, the number of newspapers Danny had at first was 118 - 67 = 51.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 6 old newspapers in the park and added them to his collection of 50 newspaper caps. So, now he has a total of 56 newspaper caps (6 + 50). Then, we are told that there are 60 newspaper caps in his collection overall. Therefore, the number of newspaper caps Danny collected from the park is equal to the total number of newspaper caps in his collection minus the number of newspaper caps he already had: 60 - 56 = 4. So, Danny collected 4 additional newspaper caps from the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 54 old newspapers in the park and then found 48 new ones. So, now he has a total of 52 newspapers (54 - 16 = 38 + 48). Therefore, Danny collected 16 more newspapers than he already had.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Danny had 82 packages and 29 boxes of candy in his collection initially. Then he found 42 more boxes of candy and added them to his collection. So, the total number of boxes of candy that Danny has now is: 82 + 42 = 124 boxes of candy. Therefore, the answer to the question is 124.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 66 packages in the park and 39 package caps. Now he has 16 package caps and 68 ambulatory devices in his collection. To find out how many packages Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of package caps he already had (39) from the total number of packages he collected (66): 66 - 39 = 27. So, Danny had 27 packages at first.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 46 packages and 50 boxes in the park. Now we have 21 boxes and 52 packaging materials in his collection. To find out how many more boxes Danny found than he already had, we need to subtract the number of boxes he already had from the total number of boxes he found:  Number of additional boxes = Total number of boxes found - Number of boxes already had  In this case, the total number of boxes found is 50 (from the park) + 21 (from the collection) = 71 boxes. So, Danny found 71 more boxes than he already had.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 65 packages and 5 cap boxes from the park. Now he has 31 capsules and 9 containers in his collection. To find out how many more packages Danny collected than what he already had, we need to subtract the number of packages he already had (65) from the total number of packages he collected (65 + 5 = 70). So, Danny collected 70 - 65 = 5 more packages than what he already had.
Response:  We know that Danny has already collected 25 ambalaj from the park. Now he is collecting more. So, after adding the new ones to his collection, he will have 11 + 12 = 23 additional ambalaj and şişe kapağı in his collection. Therefore, Danny now has a total of 25 (the initial amount) + 23 = 48 items in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny had 15 shish kebab packages in his collection initially. He then added 18 more packages to it. So, now he has 67 ambalajes (which is equal to 15 + 18) and 35 shish kebab packages in total. To find out how many additional shish kebabs Danny has, we need to subtract the number of shish kebab packages he already had from the total number of new ones he got: 67 - 35 = 32. Therefore, Danny currently has 32 additional shish kebabs in his collection compared to what he had initially.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 more shirts than Steven. So, if Jake has 17 shirts in total, then Steven must have 6 shirts (17 - 11 = 6). Therefore, Steven has 6 shirts.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 7 seftalis (Steven has 7). So, Jake must have at least 8 seftalis. Now we know that Jake has 15 seftalis and Steven has 14 + 7 = 21 seftalis. Therefore, Jake has 15 - 7 = 8 seftalis more than Steven.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 20 more sweets than Steven. So, if Steven has x sweets, then Jake has x + 20 sweets. Since Jill has 13 fewer sweets than Steven, Jill has x - 13 sweets. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Jake = x + 20; Jill = x - 13. Solving for x, we get: X = 16 (since Jake has 19 sweets). So, Jill has 16 sweets."
Response:  We know that Steven has 3 more shirts than Jake and he also has 5 shirts in total. So, if we subtract 5 from the number of shirts Jake has (which is 10), we will get the difference between their numbers of shirts. Therefore, Jake has 10 - 5 = 5 more shirts than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer shirts than Steven, so Jake has 11 + 4 = 15 shirts in total. Therefore, Jill has 15 - 4 = 11 more shirts than Jake. So, Jill has 11 shirts.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 more shirts than Steven and Jill has 9 more shirts than Steven. So, if we add these amounts together, we get:  Jake - 7 = 13 (shirts) Jill - 9 = 15 (shirts) Now, let's check how many shirts Jake has:  Jake - 13 = 3 (shirts) Therefore, Jake has 3 shirts in total.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 more shirts than Steven and Jill has 8 more shirts than Steven. So, if Steven has x shirts, then Jake has x + 7 shirts, and Jill has x + 8 shirts. Since Steven has 17 shirts in total, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 7) + (x + 8) = 17. Simplifying this equation, we get: 3x + 15 = 17. Solving for x, we find that Jill has 20 shirts in total.
Response:  We know that Jake has 9 shirts more than Steven and Jill has 18 shirts more than Steven. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake - 9 = Steven + 18  Now, we know that Steven has 16 shirts in total. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our previous equation:  Jake - 9 = Steven + 18 - 16  Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 = -2  This means that Jake has 3 fewer shirts than Steven. So, the answer is:  Jake has 3 fewer shirts than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 more sweets than Steven. So, if Steven has x sweets, then Jake has x + 6 sweets.  Since Jill has 18 more sweets than Steven, Jill has x + 18 sweets.  If Jill has 5 sweets, then Jake has (x + 18) - 5 = 13 sweets.
Response:  We know that Jake has 5 more shirts than Steven. So, if Steven has x shirts, then Jake has x + 5 = 3x shirts.  Now we know that Jill has 87 shirts in total. Since Jake has more shirts than Steven, and Steven has less shirts than Jill, we can say that Jake has at least 87 - (Steven's number of shirts) shirts. Therefore, the difference between the number of shirts Jake has and the number of shirts Jill has is at least 87 - (Steven's number of shirts).
Response:  We know that Jake has 16 shirts more than Steven. So, if Steven has x shirts, then Jake has x + 16 shirts.  Now we know that Jill has 15 shirts less than Steven. So, if Steven has x shirts, then Jill has x - 15 shirts.  If Jill has 12 shirts, then she has x - 15 = 7 shirts fewer than Steven. Therefore, Jill has 7 shirts fewer than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 12 shirts and fewer than 80 pants. So, he must have at least 13 shirts (since he has more than 12 - 13 = 1). Therefore, Jake has 13 shirts. Now let's count the number of pants he has: According to the problem statement, Jake has 79 pants, which is greater than the total number of shirts and pants that Steven has combined (12 + 14 = 26). So, Jake must have at least 53 pants (since he has more than 79 - 53 = 26). Therefore, Jake has exactly 53 pants.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 13 shirts and fewer than 10 pants. So, he must have at least 3 shirts and at most 12 - 3 = 9 shirts. Similarly, we can conclude that he has at least 8 pants and at most 13 - 8 = 5 pants. Therefore, Jake has 9 shirts and 5 pants.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer apples and 8 fewer pears than Steven. So, if Steven has x apples and y pears, then Jake has x - 6 apples and y - 8 pears. Since Steven has 17 apples and 16 pears in total, we can set up the equation:
x + y = 17... (1)
Jake has 6 fewer apples than Steven, so he has:
x - 6 = 10... (2)
We also know that Jake has 8 fewer pears than Steven, so he has:
y - 8 = 8... (3)
Now we have three equations and three variables. Can you solve them to find out how many apples and pears Jake has?"
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven and 10 fewer apples than Elma. So, if we compare Jake to Steven:
Jake - Steven = 3 (apples)
So, Steven has 3 more apples than Jake. Now let's compare Steven to Elma:
Steven - Elma = 10 (apples)
Elma has 10 more apples than Steven. Therefore, there are 10 less apples in total compared to Elma. So, the number of apples Elma has is:
Elma's apple count = Total apple count - Number of apples less than Elma
= 12 + (-10)
= 2
Therefore, Elma has 2 apples."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 shirts and Jake has fewer than 12 shirts.  We also know that Jake has 4 fewer shirts than Steven. So, if Steven has x shirts, then Jake has x - 4 shirts.  Now we are given that Jake has 67 more shirts than Steven. Therefore, we can write an equation:  x + (x - 4) = 67  Simplifying the equation: 2x = 63  Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:  x = 31  So, Jake has 31 shirts.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 marbles and Jake has 12 less than Steven, so Jake has 6 marbles.  Therefore, Jill has 8 marbles more than Jake, which means she has 14 marbles (8 + 6).
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 shirts and Jake has fewer than 19 shirts. So, Jake must have at least 19 - 12 = 7 shirts. Moreover, we are told that Jill has more than 72 shirts, so Jake cannot have more than 7 + 72 = 80 shirts. Therefore, Jake has exactly 7 shirts.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 marbles and Jake has 6 fewer marbles than Steven. So, if Steven has x marbles, then Jake has x - 6 marbles. Similarly, we know that Jill has 3 more marbles than Jake. Therefore, Jill has (x - 6) + 3 =? marbles. Since Jill has more marbles than both Steven and Jake, her total number of marbles must be greater than or equal to their combined total. So, the answer is .
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, we can say that Jake has x apples where x is less than 84 (the number of apples Steven has). Now, we also know that Jake has more oranges than Steven. So, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 10 = 52 (since Jake has 10 more oranges than Steven)
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, subtract 10 from both sides of the second equation:
x + 10 - 10 = 52 - 10
x = 42
So, Jake has 42 apples."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 13 apples and more than 12 apples. So, there are at least 12 - 1 = 11 apples in Jake's bag. Now we need to find out how many apples Steven has. According to the problem, Steven has 8 + 12 = 20 apples. Therefore, Jake has 11 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 apples and 10 pears less than Steven. So, Steven has 11 apples and 18 pears in total. Now, we need to find out how many pears Jake has more than Steven. To do this, we can subtract the number of pears that Jake has from the number of pears that Steven has: Number of pears that Jake has = Number of pears that Steven has - Number of pears that Jake has (less than Steven) In this case, the number of pears that Jake has is 10 (since he has 10 fewer pears than Steven). Therefore, Jake has 20 pears more than Steven (10 + 10 = 20).
Response:  We know that there are 3 fewer shirts and 4 fewer pants than before in Steven's wardrobe. So, we can write an equation as follows: Shirts = 19 - 3 = 16 Pants = 4 - 4 = 0 Therefore, Steven has 16 shirts and no pants.
"Response:  If $78 was in Olivia's wallet and she spent $15 at the supermarket, then...

Answer: $63

Explanation: To find out how much money is left in Olivia's wallet after spending $15 at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount spent ($15) from the initial amount in her wallet ($78). So, the final amount in her wallet is $63."
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and she had $33 in her wallet initially, then we can calculate how much money she gained as follows: Gained amount = Total spending - Initial balance = $78 - $33 = $45 So, Olivia gained $45.
"Response: 
Olivia started with $100 in her wallet. She got $148 from an ATM, so now she has $248 ($100 + $148). Then, she spent $159 at a supermarket, leaving her with $99 ($248 - $159). Therefore, Olivia gained $51 (($99 - $100) = $51)."
"Response: 
Olive had $3 in her wallet to start with. She got $46 from the ATM ($49 - $3). So now she has $50 in total ($3 + $46). When she went to the supermarket, she spent all of the $50 she had, so she is left with nothing. Therefore, the amount she spent at the supermarket is $50."
"Response: 
Olivia had $53 in her wallet at first. Then she got $91 more from an ATM. So now she has $144 ($53 + $91). But then she spent $14 at the supermarket. So now she has $128 ($144 - $14). Therefore, the amount of money that Olivia spent at the supermarket is $128."
Response:  If $106 was in Olivia's wallet and she spent $26 at the supermarket, then she had $70 left ($106 - $26 = $70). Now if she spent another $49 at the showroom, then she has $21 left ($70 - $49 = $21). So the amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket is $26.
Response:  If Olivia spent $29 at the supermarket and had $54 in her wallet initially, then she has $29 - $54 = -$25 left after shopping. So, she actually borrowed money from the cashier.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $38 is the total amount spent at the supermarket and $128 is the initial amount of cash in Oliva's purse. To find out how much change she received, we need to subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of cash. Therefore, the change = Total Amount Spent - Initial Amount of Cash = $38 - $128 = -$90. So, Oliva received $90 as change.
Response:  We know that there were 19 applications in Dave's phone initially and he deleted 5 of them. So, the number of remaining applications is 19 - 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 applications left in Dave's phone after deleting 5 of them.
Response:  At first, there were 18 applications in Dave's phone. After he deleted 13 of them, there were 5 remaining apps. So initially, there were 18 applications in Dave's phone. Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  We know that there were initially 10 applications in Dave's phone and he added 11 new ones. So, the total number of applications now is 10 + 11 = 21. When some of them were closed, we don't know exactly how many, so let's assume it was 4. Therefore, the number of applications left open after closing some is 21 - 4 = 17.
"Response:  If there were initially 21 applications in Dave's phone and he added 89 new ones, then the total number of applications in his phone would be:

21 + 89 = 106

So, Dave added 83 more applications than he deleted (106 - 24)."
"Response:  If there were 15 applications in Dave's phone and he added 71 new ones, then the total number of applications would be:

15 + 71 = 86

So, out of the 86 applications, 14 remained after some were deleted. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Yes, Dave deleted more than he added."
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 applications and 77 files in Dave's phone. When he deleted some of them, the number of applications decreased to 5, and the number of files decreased to 23. So, we can conclude that Dave deleted 11 applications (16 - 5 = 11) and 54 files (77 - 23 = 54).
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 files and 17 applications in his phone. When he deleted some of them, he lost 3 applications and 7 files. So, the number of files he lost is 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  At first, there were 15 applications and 24 files in Dave's phone. After some of them were deleted, there were 21 applications and 4 files left. So, the number of applications that were deleted is 15 - 21 = -6, and the number of files that were deleted is 24 - 4 = 20. Therefore, there are 6 fewer applications and 20 fewer files in Dave's phone after deleting some of them.
Response:  We know that there were initially 19 applications and 18 files in Dave's phone. When he deleted some of them, there were 6 applications and 15 files left. So, we can say that the number of applications decreased by x, where x is the number of applications deleted (6). Similarly, the number of files decreased by y, where y is the number of files deleted (15 - 18 = -3). Therefore, the total number of applications after deleting some of them is 6 + x, and the total number of files after deleting some of them is y + (-3) = 12. So, the number of applications and files left in Dave's phone after deleting some of them are 6 + x = 14 and y + (-3) = 9, respectively.
Response:  At first, there were 17 applications in Dave's phone. Then he added 3 more (18 - 17 = 3). So, Dave added 3 new applications to his phone.
Response:  We know that there were initially 59 files and applications in Dave's phone. Then, some of them were deleted, leaving us with 12 applications and 30 files. So, we can conclude that Dave deleted 47 files (59 - 30 = 47) and 3 applications (59 - 12 = 3). Therefore, Dave deleted 47 files and 3 applications from his phone.
Response:  We know that there were initially 24 files and 13 applications in Dave's phone. After some of them were deleted, we are told that 17 applications and 21 files remained. So, to find out how many files Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of remaining files from the initial total number of files:  Number of files deleted = Initial total number of files - Remaining number of files  Number of files deleted = 24 - 21  Number of files deleted = 3  Therefore, Dave deleted 3 files from his phone.
Response:  We know that there were initially 24 applications and 9 files in Dave's phone. When he deleted some of them, there were 5 fewer applications (so 19) and 12 fewer files (so 7). Therefore, there are 7 applications and 7 files left in Dave's phone after deleting some of them.
Response:  We know that there were initially 11 applications and 3 files in Dave's phone. When he deleted some of them, the number of applications decreased to 9, and the number of files decreased to 24. So, the total number of applications and files after deletion is:  Applications = 9 + 2 = 11 Files = 24 - 3 = 21 Therefore, there are 11 applications and 21 files left in Dave's phone after deleting some of them.
Response:  We know that Nell had 242 cards and gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Nell is:  Number of cards left with Nell = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff = 242 - 136 = 106 cards. Therefore, Nell has 106 cards left.
Response:  At first, Nell had 301 cards. Then she gave 154 of them away. So, at the end, Nell had 301 - 154 = 147 cards left.
Response:  We know that Jeff had 11 cards initially and gave some of them to Nell. After giving some cards to Jeff, he has 252 cards left. So, if we subtract the number of cards Jeff gave to Nell from his initial number of cards, we get: Number of cards Nell got = Initial number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff = 528 - x = 528 - 11 = 517 cards. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 517 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 566 cards and gave some of them to Jeff. After giving some to Jeff, she had 535 cards left. So, we can say that Jeff had x number of cards initially. Since he got y number of cards from Nell, his new total is x + y. Now, since he has 234 cards now, we can set up the equation: x + y = 234. Solving for y, we get y = 132. Therefore, Jeff had 132 cards initially.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card packs. She gave some of them to Jeff. Now she has fewer than 415 baseball cards and fewer than 149 ten-card packs. So, the number of baseball cards Nell has is less than 415 - 309 = 106. And the number of ten-card packs she has is less than 149 - 356 = -107. Since we cannot have negative numbers of items, Nell must have more than 106 baseball cards and more than 107 ten-card packs. Therefore, yes, Nell has more than 10 baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now she has fewer cards than before. Specifically, she has 404 baseball cards left and 495 10-card packs. To find out how many 10-card packs Nell has, we can divide her total number of cards by 10: 404 / 10 = 40. So Nell has 40 10-card packs left. Since each pack contains 10 cards, Nell has a total of 40 x 10 = 400 cards left. Therefore, the answer is 400.
Response:  We know that Nell gave John 195 cards and more than she gave Jeff. So, if we subtract the number of cards given to John from the total number of cards (573), we get the number of cards given to Jeff: 573 - 195 = 378. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 378 cards.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 438 ten-speed bicycles and 18 ten-speed bicycles with 10 gears each. She gave some of them to Jeff. Now there are 55 ten-speed bicycles and 178 beyzbol (which means ""bicycle"" in Turkish) bicycles left. So, we can calculate the number of ten-speed bicycles Nell has left as follows: Number of ten-speed bicycles Nell has = Total number of ten-speed bicycles - Number of ten-speed bicycles given to Jeff Number of ten-speed bicycles Nell has = 438 -?? = 283 Therefore, Nell has 283 ten-speed bicycles left. As for the second part of the question, since Nell has 283 ten-speed bicycles left and she had 18 ten-speed bicycles with 10 gears each, we can calculate the number of ten-speed bicycles with 10 gears Nell has left as follows: Number of ten-speed bicycles with 10 gears Nell has = Total number of ten-speed bicycles with 10 gears - Number of ten-speed bicycles with 10 gears given to Jeff Number of ten-speed bicycles with 10 gears Nell has = 18 -?? = 16 Therefore, Nell has 16 ten-speed bicycles with 10 gears left."
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now, there are 376 cards with 10 cards each and 111 cards with no cards at all. So, the total number of baseball cards is:  Total = Number of 10-card packs x Number of cards in each pack + Number of cards without any pack = 376 x 10 + 111 = 3970 cards. Since Nell had 239 baseball cards initially, the number of her remaining baseball cards (after giving some to Jeff) is: Remaining cards = Initial cards - Cards given to Jeff = 239 -? = 239 - x, where x is the number of baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff. Therefore, the number of 10-card packs Nell gave to Jeff is: Number of packs = Remaining cards / Number of cards in each pack = 239 / 10 = 23 packs. And the number of 10-card packs Nell has left is: Number of remaining packs = Total - Number of packs given to Jeff = 3970 - 23 = 3947 packs. Finally, the number of 10-card packs Nell has after giving some to Jeff is: Number of Nell's remaining packs = Number of initial packs - Number of packs given to Jeff = 239 - 23 = 216 packs. So, the number of 10-card packs Nell gave to Jeff is 23 packs.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 19 Kurabiyes at first and then he has eaten 35 more, in total he has eaten 19 + 35 = 54 Kurabiyes. So, he has eaten 54 Kurabiyes.
Response:  If Paco had 28 pieces of candy and he ate 7 pieces, then he has left 21 pieces of candy. So, Paco ate 7/21 = 35% of the total candies.
Response:  Paco started with 40 Kurabiyes and gave away 2 (he gave two). So he has 38 left. Then he got 3 more, so now he has 41. Finally, he gave away 5 more, leaving him with 36. Therefore, Paco had 36 Kurabiyes at the end.
Response:  Initially, there were 25 Kurabiyes and Paco took 6 of them (25 - 6 = 19). Then he took another 3 Kurabiyes, so now he has taken a total of 9 Kurabiyes (6 + 3 = 9). Therefore, from the initial 25 Kurabiyes, Paco took away 16 (25 - 9 = 16), leaving 9 Kurabiyes behind.
Response:  Paco started with 13 Kurabiyes and gave away 2 to his friend. So he has 11 Kurabiyes left. Then, he gave away another 2, so he has 9 Kurabiyes left. Finally, he gave away 3 more, leaving him with 6 Kurabiyes. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  Paco has 40 Kurabiyas and gives 5 to his friend. So he has 40 - 5 = 35 Kurabiyas left. Then, he gives another 13 to his friend, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 Kurabiyas left. Therefore, Paco has 22 Kurabiyes left.
Response:  Paco has 17 Kurabiyes and gives 14 of them to his friend. So he has 3 Kurabiyes left (17 - 14 = 3). Now, if he gave more than 13 Kurabiyes to his friend, then he would have fewer Kurabiyes left after giving them away. Therefore, the answer is NO, he did not give more than 13 Kurabiyes to his friend.
"Response:  Paco gave 12 Kurabiyes to his friend and then he took back 7 of them (since he said ""ve"" which means ""and then""). So, now Paco has 5 Kurabiyes left (12 - 7 = 5). Then, he gave another 9 Kurabiyes to his friend, so now Paco has given a total of 14 Kurabiyes to his friend (5 + 9 = 14). Therefore, the correct answer is 14."
Response:  At first, Paco had 22 sweet and 75 salty Kurabis. Then he ate 15 sweet and 54 salty Kurabis. So, at the end of this process, Paco has 22 - 15 = 7 sweet Kurabis left and 75 - 54 = 21 salty Kurabis left. Therefore, Paco has 7 sweet Kurabis and 21 salty Kurabis left.
Response:  Paco first ate 9 sweet pastries and then he ate 6 salty pastries. So, in total, he ate 9 + 6 = 15 pastries. Then, he ate another 36 sweet pastries and 3 more salty pastries. In total, he ate 36 + 3 = 40 pastries. Therefore, Paco had 40 - 6 = 34 salty pastries left after eating all those pastries.
Response:  Paco ate 37 sweet pastries and 11 salty ones. Then he ate 5 more sweet pastries and 2 more salty ones. So in total, he ate 48 pastries (37 + 11 + 5 + 2). Now we need to find out how many more salty pastries he ate than sweet pastries. To do this, we subtract the number of sweet pastries from the total number of pastries eaten: 48 - 37 = 11. Therefore, Paco ate 11 more salty pastries than sweet pastries.
Response:  We know that Paco ate 8 sweet pastries and 6 salty pastries. So, in total he ate 8 + 6 = 14 pastries. Then we are told that there were 20 sweet pastries and 34 salty pastries left after Paco finished eating them. Therefore, if Paco ate all of the sweet pastries, then he would have eaten 14 / 20 = 7/10 of the remaining sweet pastries. Similarly, if he ate all of the salty pastries, he would have eaten 14 / 34 = 1/4 of the remaining salty pastries. So, the number of salty pastries Paco ate is 1/4 x 6 = 1 1/4. Thus, the difference between the number of sweet pastries Paco ate (7/10) and the number of salty pastries he ate (1 1/4) is equal to 7/10 - 1 1/4 = 5/10.
Response:  At the beginning, Paco had 36 Kurabiyes. Then he gave away 37 Kurabiyes. So, how many Kurabiyes does Paco have left? We can see that after giving away 37 Kurabiyes, Paco has 0 Kurabiyes left. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  Paco has 36 Kurabiyas and gives 14 to his friend. So, he has (36 - 14) = 22 Kurabiyas left. Then, his friend eats 10 of them, so Paco is left with (22 - 10) = 12 Kurabiyas. Therefore, Paco has 12 Kurabiyes left.
Response:  Paco gave his friend 9 kurabiyes and then he ate 18 kurabiyes. So, if we subtract the number of kurabiyes that Paco ate (18) from the total number of kurabiyes given to him (9), we get the remaining amount of kurabiyes that Paco gave to his friend = 9 - 18 = -9. Therefore, Paco gave more than 9 kurabiyes to his friend.
Response:  Paco gave his friend 6 kurabiyes and received 30 in return. So, he gave more than he got. Therefore, the correct answer is:  More than 30 kurabiyes.
Response:  We know that Paco had 97 tuzlu kurabiyesi and 34 tatlı kurabiyesi initially. Then he ate 15 tatlı kurabiyesi and 56 tuzlu kurabiyesi. So, after eating, Paco had 97 - 15 = 82 tuzlu kurabiyesi and 34 + 56 = 90 tatlı kurabiyesi. Therefore, Paco kaldırdığında kaç tane kurabiyesi olan Paco'nun kaçtaki bir cevap var.
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 26 sweet pastries and 17 salty pastries. So, in total, he has eaten 26 + 17 = 43 pastries. Since there are 14 sweet pastries and 9 salty pastries left, we can say that Paco has eaten half of them (since he ate more sweet than salty). Therefore, the number of salty pastries left is 14 - 9 = 5. So, the number of salty pastries Paco has not eaten is 5.
Response:  Paco ate 39 sweet pastries and 6 salty ones, so he had a total of 45 pastries (39 + 6). Then, he ate 23 more salty pastries, so he had a total of 68 pastries (45 + 23). Finally, he ate 32 more sweet pastries, so he had a total of 100 pastries (68 + 32). Therefore, from the salty pastries, Paco ate 32 - 6 = 26 more than he already had, which means he ate a total of 26 + 6 = 32 more salty pastries than he initially had.
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 40 pieces of sweet bread and 25 pieces of salted bread. So far, he has eaten a total of 65 pieces of bread (40 + 25 = 65). Then we are told that he has eaten 28 pieces of salty bread and 15 pieces of sweet bread. Therefore, in total, Paco has eaten 93 pieces of bread (28 + 15 = 93). Now, to find out how many pieces of salted bread Paco has eaten relative to the total number of pieces of bread he has eaten, we need to divide the number of salted bread he has eaten (28) by the total number of pieces of bread he has eaten (93): 28 / 93 = 0.304 (or approximately 30.4%). So, Paco has eaten approximately 30.4% of his salted bread relative to the total number of pieces of bread he has eaten.
Response:  Firstly, $7 was spent for Gwen's birthday party. Then, $5 was left after the party. So, the amount of money that Gwen had after the party is $7 - $5 = $2.
Response:  Gwen spent $8 and saved $6, so she had to spend more than $6 to make up for that amount. So, if she spent $x dollars, then her total spending would be $x + 6 = 14 (since she saved $6). Now, we know that Gwen's total spending is equal to the amount of money she received ($20), so we can set up an equation: x + 6 = 20. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. Therefore, Gwen received $14 in total.
Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mother and her father gave her $4 more. So, she has $6 in total ($2 + $4). Then, she spent $3 of it. Therefore, Gwen has $6 - $3 = $3 left.
"Response: 
Gwen received $8 from her mother and her father gave her $5 more, so she has $13 in total ($8 + $5). Then, she spent $4 of it, leaving her with $9 ($13 - $4). So, Gwen's mother gave her $9."
"Response: 
Gwen received $3 from her mother and her father gave her $6 more than what she received from her mother. So, in total, Gwen received $9 ($3 + $6). Then, her father took $4 from her. So, finally, Gwen had $5 left ($9 - $4). Therefore, Gwen's father gave her $5 more than what her mother gave her."
"Response: 
Gwen received $5 from her father and then gave $4 to her mother. So, she has $5 - $4 = $1 left with her.
Now, her mother gave her $7 more than what Gwen had with her. So, if Gwen had $1 initially, her mother gave her $7 + $1 = $8 more.
Therefore, the amount of money that Anne gave to Gwen is $8."
Response:  Gwen received $5 from her father and then her mother gave her $3 more, so she has $8 in total ($5 + $3). Then, her brother took $6 from her, leaving her with $2 ($8 - $6). So, Gwen's mother gave her $4 more than what her brother took from her ($2 - $4 = $0). Therefore, Gwen's mother gave her $4 more than her father gave her.
Response:  We know that initially there were 9 mermaids in Josh's collection and some of them have escaped. If now there are only 4 mermaids left, then we can conclude that 5 mermaids have escaped (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  We know that there were initially 40 toads in the collection and 21 of them died. So, the number of toads left in the collection is:  $40 - 21 = 19$ toads. Now, we are asked how many mermaids are present in the collection if there are 12 mermaids for every $3$ toads. Therefore, the number of mermaids in the collection is: $\frac{12}{3} \times 19 = 57$ mermaids$.$
Response:  We know that 11 mermaids drowned and 5 were found. So, if we subtract the number of mermaids that drowned (11) from the total number of mermaids (19), we get the remaining number of mermaids: 19 - 11 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 mermais in Josh'un collection.
Response:  We know that 4 mermaids were collected in Joshua's collection and 16 of them died. So, the number of surviving mermaids is 8 - 16 = -8. Therefore, more than 8 mermaids died, which means the answer is positive infinity (∞).
Response:  We know that 8 mermis were lost and 10 more were found. So, in total, we have 8 + 10 = 18 mermis. Therefore, Josh had 18 - 7 = 11 mermis left after his collection.
"Response:  We know that 7 mermaids were found out of 21 in Joshua's collection. So, we can write this as:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of Mermaids Found = 7}} $$

Now, let's use the information given in the question to find the total number of mermaids in Joshua's collection:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total Number of Mermaids = Number of Mermaids Found + Number of Mermaids Not Found}} $$

We are told that there are 21 mermaids in Joshua's collection, so the number of mermaids not found is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of Mermaids Not Found = Total Number of Mermaids - Number of Mermaids Found}} $$

Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of Mermaids Not Found = 21 - 7}} $$

Simplifying, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of Mermaids Not Found = 14}} $$

Therefore, the total number of mermaids in Joshua's collection is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total Number of Mermaids = Number of Mermaids Found + Number of Mermaids Not Found}} $$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total Number of Mermaids = 7 + 14}} $$

Simplifying, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total Number of Mermaids = 21}} $$

So, there are 21 mermaids in Joshua's collection."
Response:  We know that Josh has 20 mermaids in his collection and he gave two to Jack. So, we have 20 - 2 = 18 mermaids left with Josh.
Response:  If there are 22 mermaids in Josh's collection and he gave 20 of them to Jack, then... (1) There are 2 mermaids left with Josh. (2) Jack has 20 + 2 = 22 mermaids now. So, Josh has 2 - 2 = 0 mermaids left. Therefore, Josh has no mermaids left.
Response:  According to the question, there were initially 19 mermaids in the collection. Then, 10 more mermaids were added. So, currently, there are 29 mermaids (19 + 10) in the collection.
Response:  We know that there were initially 22 mermaids in Josh's collection and 5 of them disappeared. So, the number of remaining mermaids is 22 - 5 = 17. Therefore, there are 17 mermaids in Josh's collection.
Response:  We know that 9 mermaids were caught and 23 mermaids disappeared without being caught. So, in total, 9 + 23 = 32 mermaids were encountered. Therefore, more than 32 mermaids disappeared beyond what was caught (23 - 9 = 14).
Response:  We know that 3 fish were in Josh's collection initially and 6 more were added later. So, the total number of fish in Josh's collection after adding the new ones is 6 + 3 = 9. However, we also know that 5 of them died. Therefore, the remaining number of fish in Josh's collection is 9 - 5 = 4.
"Response: 
Marco has 3 chiles (5 - 2 = 3). 
His father has 10 chiles (10 - 4 = 6). 
So, Marco's chiles are 3/6 of his father's chiles."
Response:  If Marco has 5 kg of chocolates and his father has 30 kg of chocolates in total, then Marco's share is 5/30 = 16.7% of the total weight of chocolates. So, the weight of chocolate that belongs to Marco's father is 30 - (16.7%) x 30 = 29.34 kg.
"Response: 
Marco has 3 chiles (he is not included in the total). So, the total number of chiles is: 
Total = Babasının çilekleri + Marco'nun çilekleri = 5 kg + 3 kg = 8 kg
Therefore, Marco's chiles weigh 8 kg."
Response:  Babasının çilekleri = 32 kg.  Marco's caterpillars = 8 kg. So, total weight of both caterpillars = 32 + 8 = 40 kg.
"Response: 
Marco and his father together had 24 kg of chicken. If Marco lost 2 kg of chicken, then he has 22 kg of chicken left (24 - 2 = 22). Now, we need to find out how much chicken his father had before Marco lost any chicken. We know that after Marco lost 2 kg of chicken, their total weight was still 24 kg, so his father must have had x kg of chicken beforehand, where x is the difference between 24 and 22, i.e., x = 2. Therefore, his father had 2 + 2 = 4 kg of chicken before Marco lost any chicken."
"Response: 
Marco and his father together had 9 kg of chickens. Afterward, Marco's father lost 2 kg of chicken. So now Marco has 5 kg of chicken. To find out how much chicken Marco's father had initially, we can subtract the amount he lost from the total amount they had together:

Initially, Marco's father had 9 kg - 2 kg = 7 kg of chicken."
"Response: 
Marco and his father together collected 22 kg of chicken. Then, when Marco's father was grilling, he found an additional 30 kg of chicken. So, now Marco has 10 kg of chicken left. Therefore, the amount of chicken that Marco's father had is 20 kg (30 - 10 = 20)."
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 37 kg of candy, and Marco has 5 kg of candy, then his father must have had 32 kg (37 - 5) of candy.
Response:  If Marco and his father together had 30 kg of chili peppers, and they weighed 17 kg together, then the weight of Marco's chili peppers is equal to the difference between the total weight and their combined weight. So, the weight of Marco's chili peppers = Total weight - (Marco + Babasın) x Weight per person. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Weight of Marco's chili peppers = 30 kg - (2 people x 17 kg/person) = 30 kg - 34 kg = -4 kg. Therefore, the weight of Marco's chili peppers is -4 kg.
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 26 kg of chili peppers, and Marco's chili peppers weigh 5 kg each, then how much do Marco's chili peppers weigh in total?  So, Marco's chili peppers weigh 5 x 3 = 15 kg. Therefore, the weight of Marco's father's chili peppers is equal to 26 - 15 = 11 kg.
"Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 30 kg of chili peppers, and Marco's father had 5 kg of chili peppers, then we can calculate how much chili peppers Marco had as follows:

Marco's share = Total amount - Father's share
= 30 kg - 5 kg
= 25 kg

Therefore, Marco had 25 kg of chili peppers."
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 children in the bus (Otobüste iki çocuk vardı). When another child got on the bus, the total number of children increased to 6 (Otobüste durağında, otobüse birkaç çocuk daha bindi). So, after adding one more child, the total number of children in the bus was 7 (Otobüste toplamda 10 çocuk vardı). Therefore, before the bus stopped, there were 3 additional children (kaç çocuk daha var) compared to when it started.  Answer: 3
Response:  We know that there were initially 26 children in the bus. Then, another 38 children got on the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus now is: 26 + 38 = 64 children.
Response:  We know that there were initially 41 children in the bus. Then, two more children got on the bus after it stopped at the next station. So, the total number of children in the bus now is 43 (41 + 2). Therefore, before getting off the bus, there were 43 - 2 = 41 children in the bus.
Response:  We know that there were initially 43 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off at certain stops. So, let's say x number of children got off at stop #1, y number of children got off at stop #2, and z number of children got off at stop #3. Since 21 children remained in the bus after they all got off, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of children = Number of children who got off at stop #1 + Number of children who got off at stop #2 + Number of children who got off at stop #3 - Number of children who remained in the bus After simplifying this equation, we get:  Number of children who got off at each stop = Total number of children - Number of children who remained in the bus Now, we are given that the total number of children was 43, and the number of children who remained in the bus was 21. Therefore, we can plug these values into the above equation to solve for the number of children who got off at each stop:  Number of children who got off at stop #1 = 43 - 21 = 22 Number of children who got off at stop #2 = 43 - 21 = 22 Number of children who got off at stop #3 = 0 (since no children got off at stop #3) Therefore, a total of 22 children got off at stop #1, 22 children got off at stop #2, and none got off at stop #3.
Response:  We know that there were initially 41 children in the bus and after some of them got off at the stop, 18 children remained in the bus. So, before the stop, there were more than 41 children in the bus (by 18). Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 41 children.
Response:  We know that there were initially 21 children in the bus and 10 of them got off at some point. So, the number of children left in the bus is 21 - 10 = 11. Then, we are told that some of these children boarded the bus again. However, we don't know how many of them did so. Therefore, we can conclude that there were still 11 children in the bus when it stopped.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 children in the bus and then 63 more children got on the bus after it stopped. So, the total number of children who got off the bus was 63 - 5 = 58. Since some of them boarded the bus again, we need to subtract those from the total number of children who got off the bus. Therefore, the number of children who bound the bus again is 58 - 14 = 44.
Response:  We know that there were initially 36 children in the bus and then 68 more got on the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus at any given time was 36 + 68 = 104 children. Now, we are asked how many more children got off the bus than got on it. To find this, we need to subtract the number of children who got on the bus from the total number of children in the bus at any given time (104). Therefore, the answer is 104 - 68 = 36 children got off the bus more than got on it.
Response:  We know that there were initially 22 children in the bus and some of them got off. So, let's assume that 16 children remained in the bus (since 40 - 8 = 16). Now, we are told that two children were left in the bus. Therefore, the final number of children in the bus is 16 + 2 = 18.
Response:  We know that there were initially 28 children in the bus and some of them got off (82 - 28 = 54). So, after they got off, there were 30 children left in the bus. Therefore, the number of additional children who boarded the bus is 30 - 28 = 2.
Response:  We know that there were initially 23 children in the bus and some of them got off (inmiş). So, the number of children left in the bus after they got off is: 23 - x, where x is the number of children who got off. Now we are told that there are total 8 children in the bus including those who got off. Therefore, the number of children who got off is: 8 - x. Since x is known as 24, so the number of children who got off is :x = 24. Thus, the answer is: The number of children who got off the bus is 24.
Response:  If baker made 133 pieces of pasta and gave 51 to fırıncı, then he has 82 remaining (133 - 51 = 82). So, if fırıncı gave 51 more pieces of pasta, then the total number of pasta that baker made is equal to 82 + 51 = 133. Therefore, baker did not make any more than 133 pieces of pasta.
Response:  We know that there are 54 pastries in total and some of them were given to the baker. If there are still 13 pastries left, then the baker must have received at least half of them (since he cannot receive more than half). Therefore, the number of pastries the baker received is equal to 13 / 2 = 6. So, the baker received 6 pastries.
"Response: 
If the chef made 145 pieces of pastry and there are currently 72 pieces left, then the baker must have made at least 73 more pieces (145 - 72 = 73). So, the answer is 73."
Response:  If baker has 155 pieces of pasta and his friend took 140 pieces from him, then he still has how many pieces left?  So, the number of pieces of pasta that baker has is 155 - 140 = 15.
Response:  We know that baker has 170 new pieces of pasta and he gave away 105 pieces to customers. So, the number of pasta left with the baker is: 170 - 105 = 65. Therefore, the baker has 65 pieces of pasta left.
"Response: 
Fırıncı 13 pasta yaptı means that baker made 13 pieces of pasta initially. 
Then, he sold 91 pieces and bought new ones (154-91=63). So, in total, baker has 63 more pieces of pasta than he had initially. Therefore, the answer is Yes, baker has more pasta now than he had initially."
"Response: 
Fırıncı 170 pasta yaptı means that baker made 170 pieces of pasta. 
Then, we have:
Total number of pasta = Number of pasta made + Number of pasta already there
= 170 + 78 (as given in the question)
= 248
Now, we are told that baker added 31 new pasta to the existing ones. So, the total number of pasta after adding the new ones is:
Total number of pasta after adding new ones = Total number of pasta before adding new ones + Number of new pasta added
= 248 + 31
= 279
Therefore, baker had 31 more pasta than he gave away."
Response:  The baker made 110 pieces of pastry and gave 75 away. Then he made another 76 pieces of pastry. So, in total, the baker has 110 + 76 = 186 pieces of pastry left. Therefore, the number of pastries that the baker kept is 186 - 75 = 111 pastries.
Response:  Firstly, we know that baker made 144 pieces of pasta and gave 71 to someone else. Then he made additional 111 pieces of pasta. So, in total, baker made 255 pieces of pasta (144 + 111).
Response:  If baker has sold 149 pieces of pasta and 91 pieces of pasta, then he has sold in total 230 pieces of pasta (149 + 91). Now if 10 more pieces of pasta are added to this total, then the number of pieces of pasta that baker will have sold is 240 (230 + 10). So, the answer is 240.
Response:  We know that baker has already made 15 and 103 pastries. So if he continues to make them at the same rate, how many more will he make? To find out, we can use the formula: Total = (Initial + Increment) x Time. Here, Initial is the number of pastries the baker has already made (15 + 103 = 118), Increment is the difference between the total number of pastries and the initial number (118 - 15 = 103), and Time is the time taken to make these pastries. Since the baker took 2 hours to make 103 pastries, the time taken to make each pastry is 103/2 = 51.5 minutes. Now, let's calculate the total number of pastries the baker will make: Total = (118 + 51.5) x 2 = 269.5 pastries. Therefore, the baker will make 269.5 additional pastries.
Response:  If baker made 126 pieces of pasta and sold 48 pieces, then he has 78 remaining pieces of pasta (126 - 48 = 78). Now, if 115 pieces were sold to customers and 81 pieces were left unsold, then the total number of pieces of pasta that baker had is equal to the number of pieces sold minus the number of pieces left unsold, which is: 115 - 81 = 34. So, there are 34 more pieces of pasta than what was sold.
Response:  If the baker made 19 pastries and sold 131 pastries, then he has 112 unsold pastries left (19 + 131 - 70 - 88 = 112). So, if he sells 70 more pastries, he will have 42 unsold pastries left (112 - 70 = 42).
Response:  If Çörekçi made 157 pieces of pasta and then gave some to Baker, who made 169 pieces of pasta, there are more than 158 pieces of pasta that Baker made if Çörekçi gave him some. In fact, Baker made 169 - 157 = 12 more pieces of pasta than Çörekçi. Therefore, there are 12 more pieces of pasta in total compared to what Çörekçi made.
"Response: 
If Çörekçi made 54 pieces of pasta and then gave 143 to the baker, that means the baker received 91 more pieces than Çörekçi (143 - 54 = 91).
So, out of the total number of pieces of pasta given to the baker, there are 68 pieces that Çörekçi did not give him (91 - 68 = 23)."
Response:  If there were initially 44 pasta pieces and then 4 more were added, there would be 44 + 4 = 48 pasta pieces in total. So, if there were initially 48 pasta pieces, there would be 48 - 44 = 14 pasta pieces left after one additional piece was added.
Response:  If baker had 8 pieces of pasta at the start and added 40 more, then he has a total of 48 pieces of pasta now (8 + 40 = 48). So, if he had started with 40 pieces of pasta, he would have added 4 more (48 - 40 = 4).
"Response: 
We know that the baker has already sold 137 pieces of pasta to his friend. So, initially, there were 169 - 137 = 32 pieces of pasta left in the basket. Now, the baker added another 10 pieces of pasta to the basket, so now there are 32 + 10 = 42 pieces of pasta left in the basket. Therefore, the baker's friend can buy 42 more pieces of pasta from him."
Response:  The baker made 173 pieces of pasta and sold 103 new ones. So, he has 70 remaining pieces of pasta (173 - 103 = 70). Then, he gave away 86 pieces of pasta to customers. Therefore, the number of pasta that the baker has left is equal to the number of pasta he had initially minus the number of pasta he gave away, which is 70 - 86 = -16.
"Response: 
Fırıncı 99 pasta yaptı means that baker made 99 pieces of pasta initially. 
Then, he bought 167 new pasta and gave 89 away. So, how many pasta does baker have now?
To find out, we need to subtract the number of pasta given away (89) from the total number of pasta baker had initially (99):
99 - 89 = 10
So, baker has 10 more pasta than he initially had."
"Response: 
Fırıncı 8 pasta yaptı means that baker made 8 pieces of bread. 
Then, we are told that baker bought 139 new pasta and gave 145 away. So, in total, baker had 139 + 145 = 284 pieces of pasta.
Therefore, baker had more than 8 pieces of pasta (the number he initially made). The difference between 8 and 284 is 276. Therefore, baker had 276 additional pieces of pasta beyond what he initially made."
Response:  The baker made 62 pieces of pasta first and then added another 149 pieces. So, in total, he made 211 pieces of pasta (62 + 149). Then, he gave away 144 pieces. Therefore, the number of pastries left with the baker is 21 - 144 = -123 pastries.
Response:  Firstly, baker made 81 pieces of pasta and then he added 92 more pieces. So, in total, he had 173 pieces of pasta (81 + 92). Then, he gave away 46 pieces of pasta. Therefore, the number of pasta that baker has left is 173 - 46 = 127 pieces.
"Response: 
We know that the baker has already made 61 loaves of bread and 167 cookies. If he sells 108 loaves and 44 cookies, then he will have sold a total of 252 items (108 + 44 = 252). So, if we subtract the number of items he has already sold from the total number of items he can make, we get:

Total number of items the baker can make - Number of items he has already sold = Total number of items left to sell
= 252 - 252 = 0
Therefore, the baker has zero more loaves or cookies left to sell."
"Response: 
We know that the baker has already made 56 pieces of bread and 124 pieces of cake. If he sells 104 pieces of bread and 29 pieces of cake, then he will have to make additional 37 pieces of bread (104 - 29 = 75) and 8 pieces of cake (124 - 29 = 95). Therefore, the baker will have to make 37 + 8 = 45 more pieces of bread and cake."
Response:  If baker made 52 pieces of pasta and then added another 84 pieces, in total he has 136 pieces of pasta (52 + 84). Now if he gave 102 pieces to one person and 94 pieces to another, there are still 36 pieces left with him (136 - 102 - 94 = 36). So, there are 36 more pieces of pasta that baker has than the number given to people. Therefore, the answer is 36.
"Response: 
We know that: 
* The number of pastries baked by Chef is 134 + 11 = 145.
* The number of pastries sold by Baker is 140 + 92 = 232.
So, there are more than 232 - 145 = 87 additional pastries baked by Chef compared to those sold by Baker."
"Response: 
If the baker made 14 pieces of pastry and sold 153 pieces, then he must have had some left over to sell. So let's say he had x pieces of leftover pastry. Then we know that the total number of pieces of pastry he sold is 153 + x. Since there are 8 trays of pastries and each tray has 9 pieces, the total number of pieces of pastries he sold in all is 8x + 9x = 17x. Now we want to find out how many more pieces of pastry the baker sold than he made. So we subtract the number of pieces he made (14) from the number of pieces he sold: 17x - 14 =?. The answer is 13. Therefore, the baker sold 13 more pieces of pastry than he made."
Response:  We know that baker has made more than 100 pastries and less than 200 pastries. So, we can say that the number of pastries made by baker is between 100 and 200. Now, let's consider the information given in the question:  • Fırıncı 43 pasta ve 114 pasta yaptı (the baker made 43 and 114 pastries)  • 154 tane pastırma ve 78 tane pasta sattıysa (the baker sold 154 and 78 pastries) From this information, we can conclude that the difference between the number of pastries made by the baker and the number of pastries sold by the baker is 43 - 78 = -35. Since the result is negative, it means that the number of pastries made by the baker is fewer than the number of pastries sold by the baker. Therefore, the answer to the question is: The number of pastries made by the baker is between 65 and 95.
Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and she wants to buy 140 more games, then we need to find out how many sets of 5 games (the maximum number of games that can be bought in one purchase) Kelly needs to buy.  We know that each set of 5 games costs $20, so the total cost of buying 140 games would be: $20 x 140 = $2800. Therefore, Kelly needs to buy 140/5 = 28 sets of 5 games.
"Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and she wants to know how many of them are from the 64-bit era, we can calculate it as follows:

Total number of games = 106
Number of 64-bit games =?

To find out the number of 64-bit games, we need to subtract the total number of games that were released before the year 2000 (when the Nintendo 64 was launched) from the total number of games that Kelly has.

Let's assume that the first Nintendo game was released in 1985 (the year when Nintendo was founded). Therefore, any game released before 2000 is not from the 64-bit era. So, the number of 64-bit games that Kelly has is:

Number of 64-bit games = 106 - (1985 - 2000) = 106 - 15 = 91

Therefore, Kelly has 91 Nintendo games from the 64-bit era."
Response:  If Kelly started playing Nintendo games in March and played for 92 matches after that, then he must have played 92 - 3 = 89 matches before March.
Response:  Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To find out how many Nintendo games she needs to give away in order to have 12 Nintendo games left, we can divide the number of Nintendo games she has (20) by the number of Nintendo games she wants to keep (12). So, Kelly needs to give away 8 Nintendo games (20 / 12 = 8) to meet her target.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games in total. To find out how many Sony games Kelly has left, we need to subtract the number of Sony games she already has (132) from the total number of Sony games she owns (132 + 46 = 178). So, Kelly has 178 - 132 = 46 Sony games left.
Response:  If Kelly has played 80 Nintendo games and has beaten 31 of them, then she has not beaten 59 games (80 - 31 = 59). To find out how many games she needs to play to beat 6 more, we can divide 6 by 59, which gives us approximately 0.104 (6 / 59 = 0.104). So, Kelly needs to play approximately 10 more games to beat 6 more.
Response:  If Randy has 52 blocks and he uses 38 of them to build his castle, then how many blocks does he have left? We can calculate this as follows: Number of blocks used = 38 blocks Total number of blocks = 52 blocks - Number of blocks used = 52 blocks - 38 blocks = 14 blocks So, Randy has 14 blocks left after building his castle.
Response:  We know that there are 97 blocks and we want to build a tower with them. If we use 72 of those blocks to build the base of the tower, then we have 25 blocks left over (97 - 72 = 25). So, we used 72 blocks to build the base of the tower.
Response:  We know that there are 79 blocks and we use 14 blocks to build one house. So, the number of houses built = Number of blocks / Number of blocks used per house. In this case, the number of houses built is: 79 / 14 = 5.6 houses. Since you can build more than one house with each block, we round up the result to the nearest whole number, which gives us 6 houses. Therefore, 6 houses were built using 14 blocks. Now let's consider the second part of the question where we use 11 blocks to build another house. Again, we divide the total number of blocks (79) by the number of blocks used per house (11): 79 / 11 = 7 houses. As before, since you can build more than one house with each block, we round up the result to the nearest whole number, which gives us 8 houses. Therefore, 8 houses were built using 11 blocks. So, in summary, 6 + 8 = 14 houses were built using a total of 25 blocks (14 x 11).
"Response:  We know that Randy has used 27 blocks for building one house and he needs 53 blocks for another house. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  

27 + 53 = 80  
So, Randy has used 80 blocks in total for both houses."
Response:  We know that Randy has used 37 blocks to build his tower and he needs 3 more blocks to complete it. So, he has used 37 + 3 = 40 blocks so far. Now, we are asked how many blocks he would need to use if he were building a house instead of a tower. To do this, we will compare the number of blocks needed for the house with the number of blocks already used by Randy. Since Randy built a tower using 37 blocks, he could have built a house using at least 37 - 13 = 24 blocks fewer than the total number of blocks he used to build the tower. Therefore, Randy would need 40 - 24 = 16 blocks less to build a house than he did to build the tower.
"Response:  We know that Randy has used 86 blocks to build his blog and 79 blocks to build his house. To find out how many more blocks he used for building the house than for building the blog, we can subtract the number of blocks used for the blog from the total number of blocks used for the house:

Number of blocks used for building the house - Number of blocks used for building the blog = 86 - 79 = 7

So, Randy used 7 more blocks to build his house than he did to build his blog."
"Response:  If we have 36 blocks to build one tower and we want to know how many blocks it would take to build a tower that is 59 blocks tall, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of blocks needed for each level of the tower. Since there are 36 blocks per level, if we divide the total height of the tower (59 blocks) by 36, we get...
Number of levels = Total height / Number of blocks per level = 59 / 36 = 1.625 levels

So, we need approximately 1.63 levels or 54 blocks to build a tower that is 59 blocks tall using 36 blocks per level."
"Response: 
Randy has used 95 blocks to build his house and he needs 50 more blocks to build the chimney. So, total number of blocks used by Randy is 95 + 50 = 145 blocks."
Response:  We know that Randy has used 90 blocks to build his house and he needs 1 more block to finish it. So, if we subtract 1 from 90, we get 89 blocks left for building the house. Now, let's consider how many blocks Randy has used to build the chimney. Since he needed 63 blocks to build the chimney, this means that he has used 63 - 89 = 74 blocks less than what he needed to build the entire house. Therefore, Randy has used 74 blocks fewer than he needed to build the house, which is equal to 74 / 90 = 0.81 or approximately 81% fewer blocks.
Response:  We know that there are 20 books in the series and we have read 5 of them so far. To find out how many books we have left to read, we can subtract the number of books we have already read from the total number of books in the series:  So, if we have read 5 books so far, then we have 15 books (20 - 5) left to read.
Response:  If you have read 13 books from the series and want to know how many more there are, we can subtract the number of books you have read from the total number of books in the series. So, if there are 20 books in the series, then: Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of books read = 20 - 13 = 7 Therefore, there are 7 more books in the series that you haven't read yet.
"Response:  If you have read 12 books from the series ""Foolish Genius School"" and watched 56 movies, then you have spent (12 x 4 =) 48 hours reading books.  Since there are 22 books in total, if you spend an average of 48 hours per book, it means that you will need to spend (48/22 =) 2.13 days to read all the books in the series."
"Response:  If you have read 4 books and watched 17 films from the series ""Foolish Teacher School"", then you have seen a total of 21 pieces of content from that series. So, if you want to know how many more films you would need to watch in order to reach 19 films, you can subtract the number of films you have already watched (17) from the total number of films available (4 + 17 = 21). Therefore, you would need to watch an additional 4 films to reach 19 films."
"Response:  If you have read 19 books and watched 13 movies from the series ""Foolish School"", then we can conclude that you have seen 13 movies minus the number of books you have read (19). So, the number of movies you haven't seen is: 13 - 19 = -6 movies. Therefore, there are 6 more movies in the series than the books you have read."
Response:  If you have read 19 books from the series and watched 61 movies, we can assume that each book is equivalent to one movie. So, if there are 8 books in total, then the number of movies will be equal to 8 x 1 = 8. Therefore, there are 73 movies (61 + 8) in the series beyond the ones you have watched.
"Response:  If you have read 13 books and watched 12 movies from the series, then:

* You have read more books than movies (13 - 12 = 1).
* Therefore, you have read one more book than movie.

So, if you have read 13 books and watched 12 movies, you have read 1 more book than movie."
"Response:  If you have read 7 books from the series and watched 21 movies based on those books, then:

* You have read 7/11 = 63% of the books in the series.
* You have watched 21/17 = 124% of the movies based on the books you have read.

So, if you have read more than 63% of the books in the series, you have watched more than 124% of the movies based on those books. Therefore, the answer is greater than 100%."
Response:  If there are 14 books in the series, and you have read 8 of them, then you still need to read 6 more books. So, the answer is 6.
"Response:  If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies from the series ""Foolish Teacher School"", then you have spent a total of 78 hours (4 x 15 + 34 x 2) watching movies and reading books. Therefore, if you want to know how many more books you can read, we need to subtract the time you have already spent watching movies and reading books from the total number of books in the series. So, the answer is: 78 - 4 = 74 books that you can still read."
Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies from the series, it means that you have experienced 7 + 4 = 11 different cultural products of the series in total. Therefore, to find out how many more films you need to watch, we can subtract the number of films you have already watched (4) from the total number of films available (21): 11 - 4 = 7. So, you still need to watch 7 more movies from the series.
Response:  If you have read 11 books from the series and watched 40 movies, we can assume that you have seen all of them. So, the number of movies in the series is equal to the number of books minus the number of movies you have seen. In this case, the number of movies in the series is: 15 - 40 = -25 movies. Therefore, there are 25 more movies in the series than the books you have read.
Response:  If you have read 13 books from the series and watched 63 movies, we can conclude that you have seen all the movies based on the books you have read. So, the number of additional movies in the series is equal to the total number of movies minus the number of movies you have seen. Therefore, the answer is:  Additional movies = Total movies - Movies seen = 11 - 63 = -52 movies.
"Response:  If you have watched 14 movies and read 19 books from the series ""Foolish Teacher School"", then we can calculate how many more books you have read than movies as follows:

Number of books read = 19 - 14 = 5

So, if you have watched 14 movies and read 5 books more than that, then you have watched a total of 19 movies + 5 = 24 movies."
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 films in the series. If you have read 16 books and watched 19 films, then you have not read any of the books. So, the number of films you have watched is 19 - 8 = 11.
Response:  If Dave had bought 7 tickets and used them to buy an actor, then he would have 7 - 2 = 5 remaining tickets left. So, Dave bought 5 actors with his remaining tickets.
Response:  If Dave has already sold 8 tickets and he needs to sell 6 more to get the prize money of $500, then he will have sold a total of 8 + 6 = 14 tickets. So, Dave has sold 14 tickets in total.
Response:  If Dave has already bought 18 tickets and needs to buy 5 more for himself, then he will have 23 tickets in total (18 + 5).  Now, if he also wants to buy a costume for himself, he will need 11 more tickets (23 - 11 = 12). So, Dave has 12 extra tickets left after buying the costume.
Response:  If Dave has already bought 19 tickets for the game and he wants to buy another ticket for himself, then he will need 7 more tickets. So, if he also buys a jersey for himself, he will need 7 + 1 = 8 additional tickets. Therefore, Dave has bought 19 + 8 = 27 tickets in total.
Response:  If Dave has already bought 13 tickets for himself and needs to buy 8 more tickets to get the costume, then he will need a total of 21 tickets (13 + 8).  Therefore, Dave will be using 9 more tickets than he originally planned to use (18 - 9 = 9).
Response:  If Dave has already bought 14 tickets and lost 2 of them, he has 14 - 2 = 12 remaining tickets. To get 10 more tickets, he would need to buy 10 + 12 = 22 new tickets. So, Dave has 22 extra tickets.
Response:  If Haley planted 14 trees in her garden and 9 of them died due to the storm, then there are 5 remaining trees. After the storm, more trees may have been destroyed, but we don't know the exact number. So, the final answer is 5.
Response:  If there were initially 13 trees in Haley's garden and 6 of them died as a result of the storm, then the number of surviving trees is 13 - 6 = 7. So, after the storm, 7 trees remained alive in Haley's garden.
Response:  We know that initially, Haley planted 20 trees in her garden. After the storm, 4 trees were destroyed. So, we need to find out how many trees were left after the storm. To do this, we can use subtraction. The number of trees left after the storm is: 20 - 4 = 16. Therefore, 16 trees were left after the storm.
Response:  If there were initially 12 trees and 5 of them died due to the storm, then the number of surviving trees is 12 - 5 = 7. So, after the storm, there are 7 new trees planted in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, Haley planted 9 trees in her garden. Then, a tornado killed 4 of them. After that, she planted 5 more trees. So, the total number of trees in Haley's garden is: 9 + 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 trees in Haley's garden.
Response:  If there were initially 12 trees and one tree died after Haley entered the backyard, then there are 11 trees left. If another tree dies due to Haley's entry, then there are 10 trees left. Therefore, if 2 more trees die due to Haley's entry, there will be 8 trees left in Haley's backyard. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  If Haley had planted 13 trees in her backyard before the storm and then 3 more trees were added after the storm, we can calculate the total number of trees that were destroyed as follows: Total number of trees = Initial number of trees + Additional trees Destroyed trees = Number of trees destroyed during the storm / Total number of trees So, if 13 trees were destroyed during the storm out of a total of 16 trees (initially), then the answer is 13/16 = 0.81 or 81%.
Response:  If there were initially 11 trees and one of them died in the storm, then there are 10 trees left. If two more trees die after the storm, then there are 8 trees left. So, if there were initially 11 trees and 2 more died after the storm, then there are 8 trees left.
Response:  We know that there are 66 cups in total and each cup contains 28 portakals. So, we can calculate the number of portakals per day as follows: Portakals/Cups x Cups/Day = Total Portakals Per Day  In this case, Portakals/Cup is equal to 28, since there are 28 portakals in each cup. And Cups/Day is equal to 66, since there are 66 cups in total. Therefore, the total number of portakals per day is: Total Portakals Per Day = (Portakals/Cup) x (Cups/Day) = 28 x 66 = 1760 portakals per day.
Response:  We have 8 cups of coffee per day and we want to make 24 cups in total. To calculate how many days it will take, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total amount / Amount per day. In this case, the total amount is 24 cups and the amount per day is 8 cups. Therefore, the number of days required to make 24 cups of coffee is: Number of days = 24 / 8 = 3 days. So, it will take 3 days to make 24 cups of coffee if you drink 8 cups per day.
Response:  We know that there are 56 cups of coffee in total and we have 4 days left. So, how many cups will be consumed each day? To find out, let's divide the total number of cups by the number of days left: Number of cups per day = Total cups / Number of days left = 56 cups / 4 days = 14 cups per day. Therefore, approximately 14 cups of coffee will be consumed each day.
Response:  We started with 38 cups and filled each cup with 42 marbles. After 49 days, how many cups will be full of marbles? So, we have 38 x 49 = 1762 marbles in total. Since there are 42 marbles in each cup, we can divide 1762 by 42 to find out that 40.5 cups will be full of marbles after 49 days. Therefore, the answer is 40.5 cups.
"Response:  We have 87 days after we put 66 cups of coins in the jar. Each cup contains 25 coins, so we have total number of coins as follows:
Coins = Number of cups x Number of coins per cup
= 66 x 25
= 1650 coins
Now, let's calculate how many coins will be added each day:
Added coins per day = Total number of coins / Number of days
= 1650 / 87
= 19 coins per day
Therefore, there will be 19 coins added to the jar every day for 87 days."
Response:  We have seen 8 baskets filled with apples and each basket contains 35 apples. So, in total we have 8 x 35 = 280 apples. Therefore, they are filling 280 baskets per day.
Response:  We have 80 cups of portakals to fill in total. Each cup can hold 57 portakals, so we need to fill 80/57 = 1.42 cups per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, it will take us 1.42 x 365 = 509 days to fill all 80 cups. Therefore, it will take approximately 509 days or about 1 year and 4 months to fill all 80 cups of portakals.
"Response:  If there are 67 cups and each cup contains 12 portakals, then the total number of portakals is:

67 x 12 = 804

So, if 35 cups are filled with portakals, then the total number of portakals in those cups is:

35 x 12 = 420

Therefore, the answer is 420 portakals."
Response:  We started with 74 cups of water and poured out 71 cups. So, we have 3 cups left. If we continue this process every day for 51 days, we will have (3 x 51) = 153 cups left at the end of those 51 days. Therefore, after 51 days, there will be 153 cups of water in the container.
Response:  We know that there are 76 cups of water and 64 spoons used in one day. If each cup contains 50 portions, then we can calculate how many portions were consumed per day as follows: Portion consumption = Total amount of water x Number of spoons used / Number of portions per cup So, if we substitute these values into the equation above, we get: Portion consumption = 76 x 64 / 50 = 1280 portions per day Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, it is calculated that approximately 1280 portions of yogurt were consumed per day.
Response:  We know that there are currently 28 good apples and 52 bad apples. After 26 days, how many good apples will be left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of bad apples from the total number of apples. So, after 26 days, there will be 28 - 52 = -24 good apples. Therefore, the answer is -24.
Response:  If there are currently 82 healthy portakals and they have grown by an average of 61% per day, then after 25 days:  Number of healthy portakals = Initial number of healthy portakals x (1 + Daily growth rate)^Days  Number of healthy portakals = 82 x (1 + 0.61)^25  Number of healthy portakals = 134.79  So, after 25 days, there will be approximately 135 healthy portakals.
Response:  If there are currently 31 healthy portakals and they have grown by 24 in 45 days, then the total number of healthy portakals after 45 days is:  31 + (24 x 0.06) = 31 + 1.44 = 32.44 healthy portakals. So, after 45 days, there will be approximately 32 healthy portakals.
Response:  We know that there are 44 successful portakals and 25 unsuccessful portakals in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of successful portakals = Number of successful portakals / Total number of portakals x 100% Total number of successful portakals = 44/79 x 100% = 56% Therefore, out of 79 portakals, 56% or 44 portakals were successful.
Response:  We have observed that out of 100 portakals, 5 are good and 74 are not good. So, among the remaining 26 portakals, how many may be good?  To find this out, we can use the ratio of good portakals to total number of portakals.  Ratio = Good Portakals / Total Number of Portakals = 5/100 = 1/20.  Therefore, among the remaining 26 portakals, 13 (1/20) may be good.
"Response:  If we can see 54 cups of water poured into the funnel every day, and if it takes 18 cups of water to fill one cup of water in the bucket, then...

Answer: The number of days it will take to fill all the buckets is 30 days.
Explanation: To calculate this, we need to divide the total number of cups of water that are poured into the funnel (54) by the number of cups of water needed to fill each bucket (18). This gives us a total of 30 days."
"Response:  We know that there are 56 cups of water in total and we want to find out how many cups were used per day.  Since it took 14 days to fill all those cups, let's calculate the number of cups used per day as follows:

Number of cups used per day = Total number of cups / Number of days
= 56 cups / 14 days
= 4 cups per day
Therefore, 4 cups of water were used per day."
"Response:  We started with 50 portakals and they doubled every day for 73 days. So, after 73 days, we have:

Portakals = 50 x 2^73 = 16,777,216 portakals!
So, there will be approximately 16,777,216 olgun portakals after 73 days."
"Response:  If there were 65 olunlaşmış portakals in the beginning and they turned into 46 olun portakals after 6 days, then we can calculate the number of olunlaşmış portakals that will turn into olun portakals as follows:

Number of olunlaşmış portakals turning into olun portakals = Total number of olunlaşmış portakals - Number of olun portakals remaining after 6 days
= 65 - 46
= 19
Therefore, after 6 days, 19 olunlaşmış portakals will turn into olun portakals."
Response:  We know that there are 41 cups of olives that have turned green and 86 cups of olives that have not turned green. So, in total, we have 41 + 86 = 127 cups of olives. Therefore, every day, approximately 127/30 = 4.23 cups of olives turn green.
Response:  We know that out of 71 olgun portakals, 60 are olgan. So, the number of olgan portakals among the remaining 11 portakals is (60/71) x 11 = 54. Therefore, there are 54 olgan portakals among the remaining 11 portakals.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 12 meters and its width is given as 11 meters. To find out how wide the room is in meters, we can divide the length by the width: 12 meters / 11 meters = 1.09 meters (approximately). So, Jesse's room is approximately 1.09 meters wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse has an area of 2 meters x 2 meters = 4 square meters for his room. If he needs a carpet with a length of 14 meters, we can calculate the width of the carpet as follows: Width = Length / Area = 14 / 4 = 3.5 meters. So, the width of the carpet will be 3.5 meters.
"Response:  If Jesse's room is 2 meters wide and he needs a carpet that is 14 square meters in size, we can calculate the length of the room as follows:
Length = Width x Area Required / Total Area
= 2 meters x 14 square meters / 20 square meters (total area)
= 7 meters
Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is approximately 7 meters."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much area of carpet is needed for the room. The length and width of the room are given as 12 meters and 5 meters respectively. So, the total area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = 12 x 5 = 60 square meters. Now, since there is already a carpet with an area of 5 square meters, we don't need that much extra carpet. Therefore, the amount of additional carpet required is: Additional Carpet Required = Total Room Area - Existing Carpet Area = 60 - 5 = 55 square meters.
Response:  We need to cover the entire area of 2 meters x 12 meters with tiles that are 4 meters long. To do this, we will need tiles that are at least 8 meters long (since each tile must be at least 4 meters long). Therefore, we will need 3/4 of the total number of tiles to cover the entire area. So, if there are n tiles in total, we will need 3/4 x n tiles to cover the entire area.
Response:  We have 20 rooms with an average size of 6 meters in length and width. To cover all the floors with carpets, we need to calculate how many carpets are needed based on the area of each room. The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is Area = Length x Width. So, the total area of all 20 rooms is: Total Area = 20 x (Length + Width) = 20 x (6 + 6) = 480 square meters. Since we want to cover all the rooms with carpets, we need at least one carpet that covers an area of 480 square meters. Therefore, we need 480 / 10 = 48 carpets.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 6 meters and its width is also given as 6 meters. So, we can say that the area of the room = length x width = 6 x 6 = 36 square meters.
Response:  We need to cover an area of 3 square meters with a carpet that is 1.5 meters long. To find out how wide the carpet needs to be, we can use the formula: Area = Length x Width. So, if we want to cover an area of 3 square meters, and the length of the carpet is 1.5 meters, then the width of the carpet must be: Width = 3 / 1.5 = 2 meters. Therefore, the width of the carpet needed to cover an area of 3 square meters in a room that is 1.5 meters long is 2 meters.
Response:  We know that Jesse wants to cover an area of 3 square meters with a carpet. Since he has a room that is 2 meters wide, we can calculate the length of the room as follows: Length = Width x Number of Meters Wanted to Cover (3) Length = 2 x 3 = 6 meters So, the length of the room is 6 meters.
Response:  The area of the room is given as $A = 5 \text{ meters} \times 4 \text{ meters} = 20 \text{ square meters}$. To cover the entire floor with carpeting, we need to calculate how much carpeting is needed based on the dimensions of the room. We know that the length and width of the carpet are in proportion to each other, so if the length of the carpet is $L$, then its width must be $\frac {L}{2}$ meters. Therefore, the total area of the carpet required to cover the entire floor can be calculated as follows: $$ A_\text {carpet} = L \times \frac {L}{2} = \frac {L^2}{4}$$ Since we want to cover the entire floor with carpeting, we must have $A_\text {carpet} = 20 \text{ square meters}$, which gives us the following equation: $$ \frac {L^2}{4} = 20 $$ Solving for $L$, we get: $$ L = \sqrt[4]{20} = 4 \text{ meters} $$ So, to cover the entire floor with carpeting, we will need $4$ meters of carpeting.
Response:  We know that each razorback tişört is sold for $23 and they have sold 230 tişörts in total. So, we can calculate the number of tişörts sold as follows: Number of tişörts = Total amount earned / Price of one tişörttotal amount earned / Price of one tişörtt = 230 / 23 = 9  Therefore, 9 people bought tişörts at the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
"Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling three t-shirts is $51. Since each t-shirt costs $17, we can find the price of one t-shirt as follows:
Price of one t-shirt = Total amount earned / Number of t-shirts sold
= $51 / 3
= $17 per t-shirt"
Response:  If they sold $87 per razorback tişört and they sold total of 95 tişörts in Arkansas and Texas Tech matches, then we can calculate how much money they made from each tişört as follows:  Money Made Per Tiş Ort = Total Amount Sold / Number Of Tişörts Sold So, if they sold $87 per razorback tişört, then the amount of money they made from each razorback tişört is: $87 / 95 = $0.92 per tiş ort. Therefore, they made a total of $0.92 x 95 = $91.60 from all the tişörts sold during the matches.
Response:  If Arkansas sold $106 for each of its 106 razorback hats and Texas Tech sold $242 for each of its 242 hats in total, then we can calculate how much money Texas Tech made from selling hats as follows:  Texas Tech made $242 x 242 = $57,344 from selling hats.  Now, if Arkansas sold 115 hats at $106 each during their game, they made $11,990 ($106 x 115). So, the difference between what Texas Tech made and what Arkansas made is: $57,344 - $11,990 = $45,354. Therefore, Texas Tech sold 328 (=$45,354 / $242) more hats than Arkansas did.
Response:  If they sold $98 for each razorback tişört and they sold total of 163 tişört in Arkansas and Texas Tech matches, then we can calculate how much money they made from each tişört as follows:  Money Made per Tişört = Total Amount Sold / Number of Tişört Sold So, if they sold 89 tişört in Arkansas match, then the amount of money they made from each tişört is:  Money Made per Tişört = $98 x (89/163) = $70.45 Therefore, they made $70.45 per tişört from both Arkansas and Texas Tech matches combined.
Response:  If they sold $78 for each razorback tişört and they sold a total of 186 tişört in both games, then the total amount of money made from selling tişört is:  Total revenue = Number of tişört x Price per tişört = 186 x $78 = $14,320 So, if they sold 172 tişört in the Arkansas game and 15 tişört in the Texas Tech game, then the amount of money made from selling tişört in the Arkansas game is: Amount earned in Arkansas game = Number of tişört sold in Arkansas game x Price per tişört = 172 x $78 = $13,096 And the amount of money made from selling tişört in the Texas Tech game is: Amount earned in Texas Tech game = Number of tişört sold in Texas Tech game x Price per tişört = 15 x $78 = $1,270 Therefore, the difference between the amount earned in the Arkansas game and the amount earned in the Texas Tech game is: Difference = Amount earned in Arkansas game - Amount earned in Texas Tech game = $13,096 - $1,270 = $11,826
Response:  The cost of each razorback duck is $62 or $99. If they sold 183 ducks and 31 ducks, respectively, then their total revenue would be: Total Revenue = Number of ducks x Price per duck = 183 x $62 = $11,546 + 31 x $99 = $3,073 So, the amount of money they earned from selling those ducks is $14,619.
Response:  The cost of each razorback duck is $67 or $165. If they sold 74 and 156 tickets respectively for the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, then their total revenue from ticket sales can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Tickets Sold x Cost per Ticket Total Revenue = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165 Total Revenue = $4,938 + $259 Total Revenue = $5,197 So, the Razorback fans made a profit of $5,197 from selling those tickets.
Response:  The cost of one razorback duck is $192 and the cost of one ticket is $34. So, if they sold 157 tickets and 19 tickets, respectively, then the total amount of money earned from tickets would be: Total revenue from tickets = Number of tickets x Cost per ticket = 157 tickets x $34 per ticket = $5,089 Total revenue from tickets = 19 tickets x $34 per ticket = $653 Total revenue from tickets = $5,742 Now, let's find out how much each ticket costs compared to a duck. To do this, we need to divide the total revenue from tickets by the number of tickets sold: Cost per ticket (in dollars) = Total revenue from tickets / Number of tickets = $5,742 / 157 tickets = $36.50 Therefore, each ticket costs approximately $36.50 compared to a duck.
Response:  The cost of one razorback duck is $86 and $232 for two. So if they sold 254 ducks, their total revenue would be: 254 x $86 = $21,976. If they sold 43 ducks, their total revenue would be: 43 x $232 = $9,606. Therefore, the price of one duck is $21,976 / 254 = $86.35 per duck.
Response:  The cost of each razorback t-shirt is $51. During the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 130 t-shirts at a discount price of $8 per shirt. So, how much money did they make from selling t-shirts? To find this out, we need to calculate the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts. We know that there were 130 t-shirts sold, so let's multiply the number of t-shirts by their original price: Total revenue = Number of t-shirts x Original price = 130 x $51 = $6,430 Now, we also know that they gave an $8 discount for each t-shirt, which means they had to sell them for $43 each instead of $51. So, let's subtract the discount amount from the total revenue to find the profit made from selling t-shirts: Profit = Total revenue - Discount amount = $6,430 - ($8 x 130) = $6,430 - $1,020 = $5,410 Therefore, the razorback t-shirt sellers made $5,410 in profit from selling 130 t-shirts during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
Response:  The cost of each razorback t-shirt is $20. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the price of each t-shirt increased by $5 to $217 for one t-shirt. If they sold 14 t-shirts, how much money did they make in total? So, the answer is $217 x 14 = $2968.
Response:  If Arkansas sold each Razorback hat for $60 and made a profit of $10 per hat, then they sold a total of 60/10 = 6 hats.
Response:  If Arkansas sold 5 t-shirts for $215, then each t-shirt cost $43 (215 / 5 = 43).
Response:  The cost of each razorback duck is $5 and the cost of each towel is $215. In total, they sold 20 towels and 64 towels for a total revenue of $1390. So, they earned $1390 - $1375 = $15 per sale. Therefore, they earned $15 x 20 sales = $300 from the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
Response:  The cost of each razorback duck is $76 and each tişörtten is $204. In total, they sold 158 tişört and 2 tişört for a total revenue of $31,960. So, they earned $31,960 - $76 x 158 = $20,488 from selling razorback ducks.
Response:  The cost of each razorback duck is $210 and $240 respectively. So, if they sold 177 tickets for $210 each and 23 tickets for $240 each, then their total revenue would be: Total Revenue = Number of Tickets x Price per Ticket = 177 x $210 + 23 x $240 = $56,930 + $5,320 = $62,250. Now, let's find out how much more expensive each ticket is compared to the previous one: Expensive Ticket Ratio = (Price of Next Ticket - Price of Previous Ticket) / Price of Previous Ticket = ($240 - $210) / $210 = 10% So, each subsequent ticket is 10% more expensive than the previous one.
Response:  We know that the price of each razorback is $115 and each tişörtten is $25. So, if they sold 113 tişörtler, they would have earned $24,950 ($115 x 113). If they sold 78 tişörtten, they would have earned $1,850 ($25 x 78). Therefore, the difference between the two prices is $23,100 ($24,950 - $1,850).
Response:  If there are 5 sets of blocks and each set contains 10 balls, then the total number of balls is 5 x 10 = 50. So, there are 50 balls in total.
Response:  We have two sets of plates in the backyard. Each set contains an equal number of plates. If there are total 12 plates in the backyard, then each set must contain half of them (since they are equally distributed). Therefore, each set contains 6 plates. So, there are 6 plates in each set and 2 sets in total.
Response:  We have 3 sandals in each of the 4 tables (12 sandals total). If there are 9 sandals in the backyard, then we can divide them equally among the 4 tables, giving 2 sandals per table (8 sandals total). So, there are 8 masala sets in the backyard.
Response:  If there are 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs in the garden, then the total number of chairs in the garden is: 11 x 13 = 133 chairs. Therefore, there are 133 chairs in the garden.
Response:  We have 10 sets of questions and each set has 6 sandals. If there are 11 people sitting in the garden, how many empty sandals will there be? To find out, we need to subtract the number of people from the total number of sandals. So, if there are 11 people and 6 sandals per set, then the total number of sandals is 10 x 6 = 60. Now, if there are 11 people, then the number of empty sandals is 60 - 11 = 49. Therefore, there will be 49 empty sandals in the garden.
Response:  We have 12 sets of questions and each set has 14 options. Additionally, there are 6 options from which to choose one. So, in total, we have 12 x 14 = 168 options. Now, let's calculate how many options are available for guests. Since there are 6 options that can be chosen only once, the remaining 162 options can be chosen multiple times. Therefore, the number of options available for guests is 162.
Response:  We have 4 sets of questions and each set has 3 options. If there are totally 14 people attending the party, then we need to buy how many pairs of shoes? So, the answer is 4 x 3 = 12 pairs of shoes.
Response:  We have 14 sandals in total and we want to know how many more there are after 9 masas are filled. So, let's count the number of sandals that can be placed in each masa:  Since there are 14 sandals in total, if we divide them equally among 9 masas, each masa will contain:  Therefore, there are 14 / 9 = 1.57 (approximately) sandals left over after filling all 9 masas.
Response:  If Lewis makes $460 in total and works for 5 weeks at an average of $92 per week, then he will make:  Weekly income = Total income / Number of weeks worked $92/week x 5 weeks = $460/5 = $92 per week
Response:  If Lewis is earning $1216 per week and he earned $16 in one day, then he must have worked for how many days to earn that amount of money? So, we can write an equation as follows: Weekly income = Daily income x Number of working days Now, we are given that Lewis earned $16 in one day, so let's substitute this value into our equation: Weekly income = $16 x Number of working days Now, we want to find out how many days Lewis worked to earn his weekly income of $1216. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the daily income: Number of working days = $1216 / $16 ≈ 78 days Therefore, Lewis worked for approximately 78 days to earn his weekly income of $1216.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $21 per week for 21 weeks, which is equal to $431 ($21 x 21). Secondly, he pays taxes of $702, leaving him with $379 ($431 - $702). Finally, since he works for half a year (21 weeks), his annual income can be calculated as follows: $379 / 2 = $189.50 per year. Therefore, at the end of the season, Lewis will have earned approximately $189.50 in profit.
Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week for 223 weeks of the season, his total income will be: Total Income = Number of Weeks x Weekly Income = 223 x $1357 = $294,061.

Lewis earns $1091 per week and spends $939 per week on groceries. If he works every week of the year, how much money does he make in a year?
To find out how much Lewis makes in a year, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year. So, Lewis makes:
$1091 x 52 = $56,724 per year
Now that we know how much Lewis makes in a year, let's find out how much he saves each month. To do this, we divide his annual income by the number of months in a year (which is also 12). So, Lewis saves:
$56,724 / 12 = $4,726 per month
Therefore, if Lewis works every week of the year and doesn't take any vacations or sick days, he will save $4,726 per month."
Response:  Hasan earns $403 per week and pays $49 in taxes each week. To find out how much money he makes after paying taxes, we can subtract the amount of taxes from his total income. So, if he earns $403 per week and pays $49 in taxes, then his net income is $403 - $49 = $354 per week. Therefore, Hasan makes $354 x 233 weeks = $81,769 per year before taxes.
Response:  Hasan earns $368 per week and he saves $100 each week. So, his total savings in one month (13 weeks) is: $368 x 13 = $4,752. If he spends $388 per month on something, then his remaining savings after each month would be: $4,752 - $388 = $4,364. Therefore, he will have saved $4,364 during the year.
Response:  Hasan earns $491 per week for 118 weeks. If he pays $216 every week, how much will be left at the end of the season? To find out, we need to subtract the amount paid each week from the total earned during the season. So, the number of dollars left after paying $216 every week for 118 weeks is: $491 x 118 - (118 x $216) = $57,304. Therefore, there will be approximately $57,304 left at the end of the season.
Response:  If Lewis makes $133 per week, and there are 7 weeks in a month, then he makes $921 per month ($133 x 7).
Response:  If Lewis makes $2 per week, then he has earned a total of $2 x 178 = $356 in 178 weeks. So, he worked for approximately 178/2 = 89 weeks.
Response:  If Dean's height is 6 feet (72 inches), and he jumps from a depth of 10 times that height (or 720 inches), then we can calculate how deep the water will be at the bottom of his jump using simple multiplication. So if the water is 9 feet deep at the surface, it will be 9 x 10 = 90 feet deep at the bottom of Dean's jump.
Response:  We know that Dean's height is two meters more than Ron's height. So, if Ron's depth is 14 feet, then Dean's depth would be 16 meters (2 meters x 8 feet = 16 meters).
Response:  We know that after Dumbledore's funeral, they decided to go swimming. So we can assume that the depth of the water is equal to the height of Ron plus three meters (since he is shorter than Dean). Therefore, if Ron is 12 feet tall (which is equivalent to 4 meters), then the depth of the water would be 9 meters ( since 4 + 3 = 9).
"Response:  We know that Dean is 15 times taller than Ron and Ron is 13 feet tall. So we can write this as:  Dean = 15 x Ron or Dean = 13 x 12 (since there are 12 inches in one foot)  Now we have two equations:  Dean = 15 x Ron and Dean = 13 x 12  To solve for the depth of the water, we need to isolate the variable ""Deep"" on one side of each equation. For example, let's solve the first equation for Deep:  Deep = 15 x Ron - Deep  Substituting what we know about Ron's height:  Deep = 15 x (13 x 12) - Deep  Simplifying:  Deep = 1980 - Deep  Finally, we can substitute the value we found earlier for Deep:  Deep = 1980 - 40  Therefore, the deepest point in the lake is 1940 feet below the surface."
Response:  We know that Ron is 5 feet 7 inches tall (Dean is 9 feet 4 inches tall). So, if we assume that Ron's height in the water is proportional to his height on land, then...
Response:  We know that Ron is 5 meters long and Dean is 6 meters long. To find out how deep they are in water, we need to divide their length by the depth of the water. If the water is 9 meters deep, then...
"Response:  If there are 34 books and they are divided into two libraries with equal number of books in each library, then we can say that... See the full answer

Answer: There are 17 books in each library (34 / 2 = 17)."
Response:  If there are 42 books in total and each bookshelf has 2 books, then...
Response:  We know that there are 23 bookshelves in total and each shelf has 27 books. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of books = Total number of bookshelves x Number of books per shelf. In this case, we have: Number of books = 23 x 27 = 611. Therefore, there are 611 books in total.
Response:  If there are 9 books and each book has 46 magazines, then the total number of magazines is:  Number of books x Number of magazines per book = Total number of magazines So, in this case, we have:  Number of books = 9  Number of magazines per book = 46 Therefore, the total number of magazines is:  Number of books x Number of magazines per book = 9 x 46 = 404 magazines.
Response:  We know that there are 29 bookshelves in total and each shelf has 23 books. Therefore, the total number of books is 29 x 23 = 673. Now, let's consider the magazines. If there are 61 magazines, then the total number of publications is 61. So, the final answer is 673 (books) + 61 (magazines) = 734.
Response:  We know that there are 7 kitaplık and each of them has an equal number of books. So, if we divide the total number of books (28) by the number of kitaplık (7), we get the average number of books in each kitaplık:  $ \frac{28}{7} = 4$ books per kitaplık. Therefore, there are 4 books in each kitaplık.
Response:  We know that there are 38 books in total and each book is divided into two parts (kitaplık). So, we have 38 / 2 = 19 pairs of books. Therefore, there are 19 kitaplığı.
Response:  If Carol has 10 friends and each friend receives two gift boxes, then in total, Carol needs to buy 20 gift boxes (10 friends x 2 gift boxes per friend). So, the answer is 20.
Response:  We know that there are 12 friends and each friend has received 3 packages. So, in total, we have 12 x 3 = 36 packages. Now, let's assume that each package contains an equal number of invitations. Therefore, the number of invitations inside each package is also 36. Since there are 3 packages in total, the total number of invitations is 36 x 3 = 108.
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to her friends for her birthday party and each package contained 10 invitations, then she sent a total of 10 x 7 = 70 invitations. So, if she only sends two packages, then she will send 2 x 10 = 20 invitations in total. Therefore, there are 70 - 20 = 50 invitations left over after sending two packages.
Response:  Carol sent invitations to her friends for her birthday party and received 6 packages in return with 14 invitations each. Then she received 11 more invitations. So, the total number of invitations Carol received is:  $6 \times 14 = 84$  Invitations $\therefore$ The number of friends who could have invited Carol is: $84 / 11 = 7$ friends.
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 8 of her friends and each invitation contains 3 invitations, then she has sent a total of 8 x 3 = 24 invitations.  If 9 more friends are added, then the total number of invitations will be 24 + 9 = 33. Therefore, there will be 33 invitations in total.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points out of 36 total points, then she played 36/12 = 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa played 3 matches and scored a total of 81 points, then in each match she scored an average of $ \frac {81}{3} = 27$ points.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in total and got 82 bonus points. So, we can calculate the number of points she scored for each match as follows: Match 1: Points = Total points - Bonus points = 109 - 82 = 27 Points Match 2: Points = Total points - Bonus points = 82 - 82 = 0 Points (Since she didn't play this match) Match 3: Points = Total points - Bonus points = 109 - 82 = 27 Points Therefore, Melissa scored 27 points in Match 3.
Response:  If Melissa scored an average of 21 points in all games and got 7 points per game, then she played $ \frac {21}{7} = 3$ games. Therefore, the answer is $ 3 $.
"Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in total and she got the same number of points for each match, then we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Match 1 + Match 2 +... + Match n Where ""n"" is the number of matches played by Melissa. Now, according to the question, Melissa played 13 matches, so we have: Total score = 13 x Points per match = 13 x 91 = 1143 points Therefore, the answer is 1143 points."
Response:  If there are 4 seats in each gondola of the Ferris wheel and if 20 people can fit in one gondola at the same time, then we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many gondolas can accommodate 20 people simultaneously. Therefore, the answer is 5 (20 / 4 = 5). So, 5 gondolas can accommodate 20 people simultaneously.
Response:  If there are x chairs in the Ferris wheel, then each chair can hold up to 9 people. So, if 18 people want to ride at the same time, we need to divide x by 9 to find out how many chairs will be available for them. Therefore, the number of chairs available is x/9 = 2.
Response:  In Paradise Park'taki her bir araba tekerleğinde 19 koltuk var. So in total there are 19 x 15 = 285 seats available for passengers. Now we have to find out how many people can fit in all 20 cars at once. Since each car can hold 15 people, so the total number of people who can fit in all 20 cars is 20 x 15 = 300 people. Therefore, the answer is 300.
Response:  If there are 18 people in total (including the ones who will get off), then each gondola can hold 15 people at most. So, if 10 gondolas break down, that means 10 x 15 = 150 people cannot fit into any of the remaining working gondolas. Therefore, the number of people who can move to the next rotation is 18 - 150 = -32 people.
Response:  We know that there are 6 seats in the Ferris wheel. If there are currently 16 people in the wheel, we can fit 10 more people (since each seat can hold 2 people). So, the maximum number of people who can get into the Ferris wheel is 10.
Response:  We have 2 small chairs and 23 big chairs in total. Each small chair can accommodate 14 people, while each big chair can accommodate 54 people. To find out how many people can move from one small chair to another, we need to divide the number of people who can fit in two small chairs (2 x 14 = 28) by the number of people who can fit in one big chair (54). So, there are 28/54 = 0.5 or half of the people who can move from one small chair to another. Therefore, 50 people can move from one small chair to another.
Response:  We have 3 small chairs and 7 big chairs in total. Each small chair can accommodate 16 people, while each big chair can accommodate 12 people. So, how many people can sit on the big chairs? To find this out, we need to divide the number of people who can sit on the big chairs by the number of big chairs available. In this case, we have 7 big chairs, so we can accommodate 7 x 12 = 84 people on them. Therefore, there are 84 people who can sit on the big chairs in addition to the 16 people who can sit on the small chairs, for a total of 100 people who can sit at Dev Tekerlek.
"Response:  If there are 16 people in total who want to move from Paradise Park to another place at the same time, and if they are seated in a car with 4 seats per row, then each row can accommodate 4 people. Therefore, the number of rows needed to transport all 16 people is:

$$ \text {Number of rows} = \frac{\text{Total number of people}}{\text{Number of people per row}} $$
= $\frac{16}{4}$
= $4$

So, $4$ rows would be needed to transport all $16$ people from Paradise Park to another place simultaneously."
Response:  If there are 4 people in total, each chair can hold 2 people. So, if we move all 4 people to one chair, there will be 1 empty chair left. Therefore, the number of chairs needed is 4 / 2 = 2.
Response:  If there are 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices (dilims), then the total number of slices is 7 x 7 = 49 slices. So if there were 14 slices in total, each slice would be divided among 3 pizzas. Therefore, each pizza would have 14 / 3 = 4.67 slices.
Response:  If there are 28 pieces of pizza in total and she ordered 2 pieces, then how many orders did she make?  So, the number of orders is 28 / 2 = 14.
Response:  If there are 17 people and each person has 4 slices of pizza, then the total number of slices is 17 x 4 = 68 slices. Since there are 25 people in total, the remaining slices after distributing them equally among all the people would be 68 - (25/4) = 30 slices. So, there are 30 slices of pizza left over.
Response:  If we have 9 people and each person gets 10 pieces of pizza, then total number of pieces of pizza is 9 x 10 = 90. So if there are two people, they will get 45 pieces of pizza (since 90 / 2 = 45).
Response:  We know that Paige and her friends planted 10 seeds in each pot. Since there are 45 pots in total, they have planted 45 x 10 = 450 seeds altogether. Therefore, they have planted 450 seeds.
Response:  If they put 45 bunches of flowers in each of the 9 flower beds, then the total number of bunches of flowers that they will have is 45 x 9 = 405. So, if they spread an equal amount of soil on each flower bed, then they will have 405 / 9 = 45 bunches of flowers per flower bed.
Response:  We know that there are 36 bunches of flowers and each bunch contains 12 flowers. So, in total, we have 36 x 12 = 432 flowers. Now, let's find out how many bunches of flowers are in each yatağı (room). According to the problem, there are 432 flowers and only 58 bunches of flowers in each room. Therefore, there are 432 / 58 = 7 rooms in total.
Response:  We know that there are 55 bunches of grapes and each bunch contains 15 grape clusters. So, in total, we have 55 x 15 = 825 grape clusters. Now, let's assume that each cluster produces 60 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes produced is 825 x 60 = 49500 grapes. So, the answer is 49500 grapes.
Response:  If Paige had given assistance in planting 10 flowers for each of the 60 tomato plants, then the total number of flowers planted would be 60 x 10 = 600 flowers. So, there would be 600 flower beds if 60 tomato plants were harvested.
Response:  If Paige has 8 bunches of flowers and she puts each bunch into one vase, then she will have 8 vases with flowers.  If she wants to put an equal number of flowers in each vase, then she will divide the total number of flowers (8) by the number of vases (8). So, there will be 1 flower in each vase.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends 2 krakers each, then he gave in total 2 x 11 = 22 krakers. So, Matthew has 22 - 5 (the number of krakers he received) = 17 krakers left.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his friends 2 crackers, then he gave a total of 2 x 8 = 16 crackers. So, Matthew gave crackers to 4 of his friends.
Response:  If there are 5 friends and each friend has an equal number of crackers (let's assume 10), then the total number of crackers among all 5 friends is 5 x 10 = 50 crackers. So, each friend had 50/5 = 10 crackers.
"Response:  If Matthew gave his three friends equal number of crackers (let's assume it is x) and currently there are 17 crackers left, then we can calculate how many crackers Matthew gave to each friend as follows:

Matthew gave crackers to his friends = Total number of crackers - Number of crackers remaining with him
= 17 - x

So, Matthew gave 3 friends an equal number of crackers, which means he gave 5 crackers to each friend (since 3 x 5 = 15). Therefore, Matthew gave a total of 15 crackers to his friends."
Response:  If Matthew had 22 crackers and shared them equally among his 3 friends, each friend would get 7 crackers (22 / 3 = 7). Now, if Matthew gave each of his 3 friends an equal number of pasta, each friend would get 11 pieces of pasta (3 x 11 = 33). So, in total, Matthew gave away 7 + 33 = 40 items.
Response:  If Matthew has 30 pieces of pasta and he shares them equally among his two friends, then each friend will get 15 pieces of pasta (30/2 = 15). Now, if Matthew also gives each friend an equal number of crackers, then each friend will get 5 crackers (15/2 = 5). So, in total, Matthew gave away 15 + 5 = 20 items to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew has 7 friends and he gives each of them an equal number of crackers and pasta, then the total number of crackers and pasta given to all 7 friends is:  Crackers: 7 x 7 = 49 crackers Pasta: 7 x 7 = 49 pieces of pasta Therefore, each friend received 49 crackers and 49 pieces of pasta.
Response:  If there are 36 crackers and each friend gets an equal number of them (which is not specified), then we can assume that each friend got 36/x crackers, where x is the number of friends. Since there are 7 friends in total, we can calculate the number of crackers each friend got as follows:  Number of crackers each friend got = Total number of crackers / Number of friends = 36 / 7 = 5 crackers per friend.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his friends 6 crackers and there are 36 crackers in total, then he gave 6/36 = 1/6 of the crackers to each friend. So, he gave 3 friends crackers (since 1/6 is less than 3).
"Response: 
Matthew had 23 crackers and divided them equally among his two friends. If he gave each friend an equal number of crackers, then each friend got 23/2 = 11 crackers. So, each friend ate 11 crackers."
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his five friends an equal number of crackers (5), and then he took back 23 crackers from them, then he would have given them a total of 77 crackers (5 x 5 = 25 + 23). So, Matthew gave his friends 77 crackers in total.
Response:  We know that there are four friends and they have equal amounts of crackers and pasta. So, if there were 32 crackers initially, each friend would have 8 crackers (32/4 = 8). Similarly, if there were 98 pasta initially, each friend would have 24 pasta (98/4 = 24). Therefore, each friend has 8 crackers and 24 pasta.
Response:  We know that there are four friends and they have shared equally among them. So, each friend has received half of what was given to all four together. Therefore, if there were initially 10 crackers and 8 pasta, each friend would have gotten 5 crackers (half of 10) and 4 pasta (half of 8). In total, then, there are 20 crackers and 32 pasta.
Response:  We know that there are 13 crackers and 15 pastas in total. So, each of them has to share an equal amount. Therefore, we can divide both numbers equally among themselves.  Crackers: 13 / 2 = 6 (each cracker gets 6) Pasta: 15 / 2 = 7 (each pasta gets 7)
Response:  If Debbie had 109 sticks in total and she sold 74 of them in one day, then she has 35 stick left. So, she sold 35/109 = 32% of her total sticks that day.
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 153 sticks of incense and burned them every day. Since she burned them for 17 days, we can calculate how many sticks she burned each day as follows: Number of sticks burned per day = Total number of sticks / Number of days = 153 / 17 = 9  So, Debbie burned 9 sticks of incense each day during those 17 days.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 264 slices of pizza and she ate 15 slices per day for 11 days, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days Debbie had the pizza.
Total days = Number of days x Number of slices eaten per day
= 11 days x 15 slices/day
= 165 slices (days)

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices Debbie ate during those 11 days.
Total slices = Total days x Number of slices eaten per day
= 165 slices (days) x 15 slices/day
= 2475 slices

So, Debbie ate 2475 slices of pizza in 11 days. To find out how many slices she left, we need to subtract the number of slices she ate from the total number of slices she bought:

Number of slices left = Total slices - Number of slices eaten
= 2475 slices - 264 slices
= 2211 slices

Therefore, Debbie left with 2211 slices of pizza after eating 2475 slices over 11 days."
Response:  If she bought 301 sticks of incense and used 144 sticks per day for several days, then the total number of days she used all 301 sticks is: Total Days = (Total Number of Sticks / Daily Usage) x Number of Days Used So, in this case, we have: Total Days = (301 / 144) x Number of Days Used = 216 days Now, if she had 157 sticks left after using all those sticks, then the number of days she used them is: Number of Days Used = Total Days - Remaining Sticks / Daily Usage = 216 - 157 / 144 = 60 days Therefore, she used 60 days worth of incense.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of soda and 13 bottles of juice, then she has a total of 101 bottles.  If she drinks 4 bottles of soda and 87 bottles of juice per day, it means that her stock will last for:

Days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles consumed per day
= 101 / (4 + 87)
= 101 / 91
= 11 days
Therefore, Debbie's stock of soda and juice can last for approximately 11 days if she consumes 4 bottles of soda and 87 bottles of juice per day."
Response:  If Debbie drank 200 bottles of water and 256 cans of soda in one day, then she drank a total of 200 + 256 = 456 units of liquid per day.  If she continued to drink this amount every day for 312 days (which is the number of days in a year), then she would have drunk a total of 456 x 312 = 147,984 units of liquid throughout the year. Since each can of soda contains 12 ounces or 355 milliliters, Debbie would have consumed a total of 147,984 / 355 = approximately 417,000 cans of soda throughout the year. Therefore, if Debbie drank 312 bottles of water and 4 cans of soda per day, it would take her approximately 417,000 / 312 = 1,333 days (or about 3 years and 9 months) for her to consume all those liquids.
Response:  If Debbie has 6 fish in her pond and she adds 12 more fish, then the total number of fish in the pond will be 6 + 12 = 18. Since it takes approximately 3 weeks for goldfish to grow from 1 inch long to 4 inches long (assuming they are well-fed and cared for), we can estimate that it will take Debbie around 18 / 3 = 6 weeks for the fish to reach their full size. Therefore, if Debbie adds 12 new fish to her pond today, she will have 6 weeks before all the fish are fully grown.
Response:  If they sold 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water in one day, then in total, they sold 95 + 180 = 275 bottles that day.  Now, if they had 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, it means they would have consumed (or used up) 15/275 x 275 = 36 bottles of water and 54/275 x 275 = 130 bottles of soda in one day. So, the number of days it would take for them to consume all the bottles is: Number of days = Total bottles / Daily consumption = 275 / 130 = 2.12 days. Therefore, they would be able to consume all the bottles in approximately 2.12 days.
Response:  If they sold 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of juice per day, then in total they sold 522 bottles (360 + 162) per day.  If they wanted to sell 122 bottles of juice and 9 bottles of soda per day, it would take them 4 days to do so (522 - 122 = 400 / 9 = 44 days). Therefore, the gas station could hold 44 days worth of supply of each drink.
Response:  We know that Faye had 14 pencils in total and she used 11 of them at each sitting. So, we can say that the number of pencils left after using 11 pencils is: 14 - 11 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 pencils remaining.
Response:  We know that there are 12 kaleminis in total and each one has 3 sides. So, if we divide the number of kaleminis (12) by the number of sides per kalemini (3), we get... 12 / 3 = 4. Therefore, each kalemini had 4 pieces of paper.
Response:  We know that there are 28 packets of pencils and each packet contains 24 pencils. So, in total, we have 28 x 24 = 672 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many rows can be formed using these pencils. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row, which is 16. Therefore, the number of rows that can be formed is: 672 / 16 = 43 rows.
Response:  We have 22 boxes of kaleme (kalem). Each box contains 14 pieces of kaleme. Therefore, in total, we have 22 x 14 = 288 pieces of kaleme. So, there are 288 kalem.
Response:  If Faye has 5 pens in each row and there are 35 rows, then she has total of 175 pens (5 x 35 = 175). Now if we assume that each pen represents one box, then Faye has drawn 175 boxes. Therefore, the answer is 175.
Response:  We know that there are 19 rows in total and each row has 4 pens and 27 pencils. So, we can write an equation as follows: Row x = Number of Pens + Number of Pencils. Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: Row 1 = 4 (Pens) + 27 (Pencils) = 31 Row 2 = 4 (Pens) + 27 (Pencils) = 31... Row 19 = 4 (Pens) + 27 (Pencils) = 31 Since there are 19 rows in total, the total number of pens is 19 x 4 = 76, and the total number of pencils is 19 x 27 = 503. Therefore, there are 76 pens and 503 pencils in total.
Response:  We have 7 rows and each row has 36 columns, so we have 36 x 7 = 252 cells in total. Now, there are 30 balls of different colors in each cell, so the number of balls per cell is 30/252 = 1/8. Therefore, there are 8 balls in total.
Response:  We know that there are 11 rows in total and each row has either 31 or 27 balls. So, we have to find out how many balls are in each row and then sum them up.  If there were 31 balls in each row, we would have: 31 x 11 = 341 balls Total number of balls = 341 + 27 x 11 = 568 balls Therefore, there are 568 balls in total.
Response:  If there are 30 kaleminis and each one has 5 kalemleri (or pieces), then we have a total of 30 x 5 = 150 kalemleri in total. So, Faye could make 150 sıralar with these kalemleri.
Response:  If there were 4 castles and each castle had 2 towers, then...
Response:  We have 35 packets of candy and each packet contains 4 candies. To arrange them in rows, we need to place 2 candies in each row. So, total number of rows = 35 / 2 = 17 rows. Therefore, Fay can arrange 17 rows of candies.
Response:  We know that there are 31 packets of candy and each packet contains 6 candies. So, in total, we have 31 x 6 = 186 candies. Now, Fayen has arranged them into 19 rows. Therefore, the number of rows is 19. Since each row contains 6 candies, the number of candies in one row is 6. So, the answer is 19 x 6 = 114 candies.
Response:  We know that there are 30 rows in total and each row has either 71 or 24 balls. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of balls = Number of rows x Number of balls per row In this case, the total number of balls is equal to 30 x (71 + 24) = 30 x 95 = 2850 balls. Therefore, there are 2850 balls in total.
Response:  We have 16 balls and we want to arrange them in groups of 6 or 7. The number of ways to do this is equal to the number of combinations of 6 or 7 items taken from a set of 16 items. Therefore, there are 16C6 = 30 ways to arrange 6 balls in a row, and 16C7 = 49 ways to arrange 7 balls in a row. So, there are 30 + 49 = 89 different ways to arrange the pasta shapes.
Response:  We know that there are 21 classes in the school and each class has 30 students. So, the total number of students is 21 x 30 = 630. Now, we have to find out how many seats are available in all buses combined. There are 7 buses, and each bus can carry 50 students. Therefore, the total number of seats available in all buses is 7 x 50 = 350. Since there are more students than seats available, not all students will be able to take the bus. The remaining students will have to walk or find another way to get to school.
Response:  We know that there are 84 students in the school and 118 people in the bus. Since each person can sit comfortably in a seat, we can assume that all of them will be seated in the bus. Therefore, the number of students who will go to the park is equal to the number of seats available in the bus. So, the answer is 118.
Response: 1) Total number of students = 67 x 6 = 392 2) Number of buses required = Total number of students / Number of seats in each bus = 392 / 6 = 65 buses. Therefore, 65 buses will be needed for the field trip.
Response:  We have 87 students in total and each class has an equal number of students (58). Therefore, we need at most 87 / 58 = 1.5 otobuses to transport all the students. Since there are 2 seats per otobus, we need at least 1.5 x 2 = 3 otobuses for this trip. So, the answer is 3 otobuses.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in total and each class has an equal number of students (120). So, we can assume that all classes have the same number of students, which is 120/24 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 students per class. Now, let's calculate how many students are in each bus. Since there are 84 colts in each bus, and since each bus carries 5 students from each class, the total number of students in each bus is 84 x 5 = 420. So, there are 420 students in total who will be going to school using these buses.
"Response:  We have 102 students in total and we want to know how many buses are needed if 22 students do not want to go on the field trip. So, let's divide the number of students by the number of seats available in each bus. There are 8 seats in each bus. Therefore, we need:

$$ \text {Number of buses} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of seats per bus}} $$

$ $ $\text{Total number of students}$ = 102$

$ $ $\text{Number of seats per bus}$ = 8$

So, we need:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of buses} = \frac{102}{8} = 13} $$

Therefore, there will be 13 buses for the field trip."
Response:  We have 102 students in total and 11 of them want to go for a walk. Since there are 99 seats available in each bus, if 8 students don't want to go for a walk, then how many will go for a walk? So, the answer is 102 - 8 = 94 students who will go for a walk.
Response:  We have 72 students in total and each bus can accommodate 30 students (3 seats per row). So, we need at least 72/3 = 24 buses for all the students to travel together. Since there are 111 students in total, we will need more than 24 buses since some students may not fit in one bus due to limited seating capacity. Therefore, the number of buses required is 24 + (111 - 72) / 3 = 35 buses.
Response:  We have 46 buses and 92 students in total. If all buses are full, then each bus can carry how many students?  To find out, we divide the number of buses (46) by the number of students (92). So, there is one student for every 2 seats in each bus. Therefore, there are 46/2 = 23 students per bus. Since there are 17 classes, each class has approximately 23/17 = 1.36 students per seat.
"Response:  If there are 11 students in Haley's class and each student gets 9 marbles, then...

Answer: There will be 9 x 11 = 99 marbles in total."
Response:  If there are 10 children and each child gets 5 marbles from Haley, then the total number of marbles distributed is 10 x 5 = 50 marbles. So, 50 marbles were given to the children.
Response:  If there are 4 children and each child gets to choose one marble from Haley's collection of 23 marbles, then each child will get to choose 23/4 = 5 marbles. So, in total, 4 children will choose 5 x 4 = 20 marbles. Therefore, the answer is 20 marbles.
Response:  If Haley has 13 children and each child wants to get one marble from Haley, then Haley will have 13 - 1 = 12 marbles left. Now, if there are 50 other children who want to take turns playing with Haley's marbles, they will be able to take 50 / 2 = 25 marbles from Haley. So in total, Haley will have 12 + 25 = 37 marbles left after all the children play together.
Response:  If Hayley has 20 toys and she wants to distribute them equally among 5 children, then each child will get 4 toys (20 / 5 = 4).
Response:  If Haley has 28 pieces of candy and wants to give each child two candies, then she will have to distribute them among 14 children (since there are 14 children in total). So, she will give 28/14 = 2 candies to each child. Therefore, she gave a total of 2 x 14 = 28 candies.
"Response:  If Frank read 392 pages of his favorite book and he reads 14 pages per day, then it will take him:

Days = Total pages / Daily pages
= 392 / 14
= 27 days
Therefore, Frank will need 27 days to finish reading his favorite book if he reads 14 pages per day."
"Response:  If Frank reads 22 pages per day and it takes him 569 days to finish reading the book, then he has read a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of pages} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Pages per day} $$

So, the total number of pages in the book is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total number of pages}} = 569 \times 22 = 12380 $$

Therefore, the book contains $12380$ pages."
Response:  We know that Frank read 612 pages of his book and it consisted of 24 chapters. To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the time it took him to finish reading the book:  Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to finish reading the book  In this case, the time taken to finish reading the book is 6 days, so: Number of pages read per day = 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day Now, let's convert this to a decimal format for easier calculation: Number of pages read per day (decimal) = 102 / 6 = 17 pages per day So, Frank read approximately 17 pages per day during the 6 days he had to finish reading his book.
Response:  We know that Frank read a book with 555 pages and it consisted of 5 chapters. To find out how many pages each chapter had, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters. So, if there were 5 chapters in the book, each chapter would have 111 pages (555 / 5 = 111). Now, let's calculate how long it took for Frank to finish reading each chapter. If it took him 220 days to finish reading the entire book, then he must have spent approximately 18 days reading each chapter (220 / 111 = 18).
Response:  We know that Frank read 15 chapters of his book and each chapter has 193 pages. Therefore, he read a total of 2895 pages (15 x 193 = 2895). Now we need to calculate how many days it took him to finish reading the entire book. According to the question, it took Frank 660 days to finish reading the book. So, we can divide the number of pages he read by the number of days he spent reading them: 2895 pages / 660 days = 4.3 pages per day.
Response:  If Frank read 249 pages of his book and it took him 3 days to finish reading it, then he must have read an average of pages per day. So, in 1 day, he read pages. In total, he read pages during the 3 days. Therefore, he read pages in total.
Response:  If it takes Frank 12 days to read one book and he has read 66 books in total, then it took him 66 x 12 = 792 days to read all the books. Since it will take him 492 days to read all the books if he reads at this rate continuously, we can conclude that Frank has already read 300 books (792 - 492 = 300).
Response:  If Frank read the book for 16 days and there are 112 pages in the book, then he must have read at most $ \frac{112}{16} = 7$ pages per day. So, Frank read $\boxed{7}$ pages per day.
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages in total, it will take him:

Time = Number of pages / Reading speed (pages/day)
= 576 / 8
= 72 days
Therefore, if Frank reads at a rate of 8 pages per day, he will finish reading the book in 72 days."
Response:  We know that Frank read 41 chapters in his book and each chapter has 450 pages. So, he read a total of 450 x 41 = 18,600 pages in his book. Now, we are asked how many pages Frank read per day. Since it took him 30 days to finish reading the book, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages read / Time taken to read the book = 18,600 pages / 30 days = 620 pages per day.
Response:  We know that there are three parts (or bölümler) in each book and each part has 182 pages. So, the total number of pages in one book is 182 x 3 = 546 pages. Now, we need to find out how many books Frank read during 607 days. To do this, we divide the total number of pages he read by the number of days he spent reading: 546 pages/day x 607 days = 335,220 pages. Therefore, Frank read approximately 335,220 pages in total.
Response:  The book has 405 pages and is divided into two parts of 202 pages each. To calculate how many days it took for Frank to read the entire book, we can use the formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Reading speed in pages per day. Based on this formula, if Frank reads at a rate of 100 pages per day (which is a reasonable estimate), it would take him 664 days to read the entire book (664 days = 405 pages / 100 pages/day). Therefore, the answer is 664 days.
"Response:  If we have 6 DVD packs that cost $120 in total, then each pack must cost:
$120 / 6 = $20 per pack
Therefore, each DVD pack costs $20."
Response:  If each package costs $81 and you want to buy 33 DVD packages, then...
"Response:  If there is an $106 discount for each package of 10 DVDs, then we can calculate how many packages you can buy with $93 as follows:

$93 / $106 = x
x = 9
So, you can buy 9 packages of DVDs with $93."
Response:  If there are 76 dollars for the entire DVD package and if we give a discount of $25 per pack, then the cost of each pack is:  76 / 4 = 19 dollars per pack. So, you would need to pay 19 x 3 = 57 dollars for three packs.
Response:  We know that $104 is equal to 104/1 = 104 dollars. Now we have to find out how many DVD packages of $26 each can be bought with $104. To do this, we divide $104 by $26: $104 / $26 = 4 DVD packages. So, you can buy 4 DVD packages for $104.
Response: 1 DVD costs $20. So, if we buy 2 DVDs, the total cost will be $40. Therefore, the price of each DVD is $20 / 2 = $10.
"Response:  If there are 18 pieces of music in Philip's collection and they can be divided into two groups with different sizes (let's call them Group A and Group B), then we have:
Group A - Number of pieces of music that belong to this group = 18 / 2 = 9
Group B - Number of pieces of music that belong to this group = 18 - 9 = 9
So, there are 9 groups of music in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 187 musicians in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of 140 musicians each. To find out how many groups there are, we can divide 187 by 140: 187 / 140 = 13 Therefore, there are 13 groups of musicians in Philip's collection.
Response:  If there are 203 musicians in Philip's collection and they can be grouped into 7 categories, then each category must contain at least 28 musicians (203 / 7 = 28). Similarly, if there are 63 portrait artists in Philip's collection and they can be grouped into 9 categories, then each category must contain at least 7 portrait artists (63 / 9 = 7). Therefore, the number of musicians in each category is 28, and the number of portrait artists in each category is 7.
Response:  If there are 142 musicians in Philip's collection and 356 portals, then we can divide them into groups of 47 musicians each. So, if we have x musicians in one group, then we will have 356 / 47 = 7 groups of musicians. Therefore, each group will contain 142 / 7 = 20 musicians.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in Philip's collection and each group contains an average of 3 musicians. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of musicians as follows: Total Number of Musicians = Number of Groups x Average Number of Musicians per Group Total Number of Musicians = 196 x 3 = 588 So, there are 588 musicians in Philip's collection.
Response:  We know that there are 18 types of music in Philip's collection. Since each type can be grouped into one of the 18 groups, we have:  Number of groups = Total number of types of music / Number of types per group  In this case, the total number of types of music is 180 (since there are 18 types x 10 pieces for each type). So, if we divide it by the number of types per group (which is 18), we get:  Number of groups = 180 / 18 = 10  Therefore, there are 10 groups in Philip's music collection.
Response:  If there are 87 ports and 290 musicians in Philip's collection, then we can say that each musician plays for how many ports on average?  To find out this value, we need to divide the number of musicians (290) by the total number of ports (87). So, each musician plays for approximately 3.4 ports on average. Now, let's assume that the distribution of musicians among groups is uniform. In other words, every group has an equal number of musicians. Therefore, if we have n groups of musicians, then the number of musicians in each group is also approximately 3.4/n. Since there are 93 groups of portakers, the number of portakers in each group is approximately 3.4/93.
Response:  If there are 384 portakals and 192 mus in Philip's collection, then we can divide them into groups of 345 portakals and 16 mus as follows: Portakals: 384 / 345 = 10 Mus: 192 / 16 = 12 So, each group contains 10 portakals and 12 mus.
Response:  If Brenda made 38 pieces of Kurabiye and each piece contains 19 Kurabiyes, then we can calculate how many people she served as follows: Number of People = Total number of Kurabiyes / Number of Kurabiyes in each piece So, if Brenda made 38 pieces of Kurabiye, then the total number of Kurabiyes is 38 x 19 = 672 Kurabiyes. Now, let's divide this number by the number of Kurabiyes in each piece to find out how many people Brenda served: Number of People = 672 Kurabiyes / 19 Kurabiyes per piece = 35 people Therefore, according to the given information, Brenda served 35 people with the 38 pieces of Kurabiye she made.
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 14 people Kurabiyе (a Turkish dish), and each person had 30 pieces of Kurabiyе, then...

Answer: 14 x 30 = 420 Kurabiyeler were prepared in total."
Response:  If Brenda's mother made 5 pieces of pizza and Brenda herself made 17 pieces, then together they made 22 pieces of pizza in total. However, if each person had to make an equal number of pizzas, then each person would have made half as many pizzas as there are people participating. Therefore, if there were 5 people participating (Brenda and her mother), each person would have made 4 pizzas (since 5 x 4 = 20). So, Brenda's mother made 5 + 4 = 9 pizzas, and Brenda made 17 - 4 = 13 pizzas.
Response:  If Brenda made 10 pieces of baklava for guests and only 9 guests arrived, then each guest received how many pieces of baklava? Baklava is divided equally among all guests, so if there are x guests, each guest will receive x/9 pieces of baklava. Since Brenda made 10 pieces in total, we can set up an equation as follows: 10 = (x/9) \* 9. Solving for x, we get x = 12. So each guest received 12 pieces of baklava.
Response:  If Brenda's mother gave each of two guests 14 Kurabiyess, then if there were three guests in total (including Brenda), each guest would have received 14 + 28 = 42 Kurabiyess altogether. So, Brenda's mother gave 42 Kurabiyess to the three guests together.
Response:  If Brenda's mother made Kurabiye for 5 guests and each guest received 2 pieces of Kurabiye, then the total number of Kurabiye served is 5 x 2 = 10. So, there are 10 people who received Kurabiye from Brenda's mother.
Response:  If Frank has taken 42 sweets and wants to divide them equally among two containers, each container will have 21 sweets (42/2 = 21).
Response:  If there are 26 pieces of candy and each piece is divided into 33 equal parts, then we have: Number of candies = Total number of parts / Number of parts per candy = 26 / 33 = 79 candies. Therefore, each person received 79 candies.
Response:  We have 33 pieces of candy and we lost 24 pieces. If we divide the remaining pieces equally among 9 boxes, how many pieces will each box contain?  So, there will be 33 / 9 = 3.67 boxes left.
Response:  If Frank has 11 bags of sugar and he wants to make 22 bags of candy, how many bags will each bag of sugar produce? So, if we divide 22 by 11, we get 2 bags of sugar per one bag of candy. Therefore, there would be 20 bags of candy (2 x 10 = 20).
Response:  If Frank has 16 pieces of candy and he distributed them equally among 4 bags, then each bag will contain 4/16 = 1/4 of the total number of candies. So, there are 16 / 4 = 4 candies in each bag.
Response:  We have 25 pieces of fruit and each piece has 3 parts (peel, pulp, and seeds). So, we have a total of 75 parts (25 x 3 = 75). Now, we are asked how many pieces of fruit can be made with these 75 parts. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of parts by the number of parts in one piece of fruit. In this case, there are 14 parts in one piece of fruit, so we can divide 75 by 14 to get our answer: 75 / 14 = 5. Therefore, we can make 5 pieces of fruit from the given amount of fruit peels.
Response:  If Shirley has 10 leaves and she wants to distribute them equally among 3 friends, then each friend will get 3 leaves. So, there are 3 friends in total. Now, if 5 of those friends receive delivery, that means 5 x 3 = 15 friends received deliveries. Therefore, there are 10 - 15 = 5 friends who did not receive any delivery.
Response:  The total number of sodas consumed is 67 (normal soda) + 9 (diet soda) = 76. So, there were 10 more sodas consumed from the diet soda than the normal soda.
"Response:  We know that there are 22 cans of regular soda and 61 cans of diet soda in total. To find out how many more cans of diet soda there are than regular soda, we need to subtract the number of cans of regular soda from the total number of cans of diet soda:

61 - 22 = 39
So, there are 39 more cans of diet soda than regular soda."
"Response:  We know that there are 30 cans of regular soda and 8 cans of diet soda. Since each can contains 12 fluid ounces (fl oz), we have:
Regular soda = 30 x 12 fl oz/can = 360 fl oz
Diet soda = 8 x 12 fl oz/can = 96 fl oz
Now, let's add the total amount of fruit juice to the total amount of soda:
Total = Regular soda + Diet soda + Fruit juice
= 360 fl oz + 96 fl oz + 41 elma (which is equal to 41 x 8 fl oz/elma = 328 fl oz)
Therefore, in total, there were 788 fl oz (or 25 şişe) of drinks consumed."
Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda in total. To find out how many more bottles of diet soda were consumed than regular soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of regular soda from the number of bottles of diet soda. So, the difference between the two is: 53 - 79 = -26. Therefore, 26 more bottles of diet soda were consumed than regular soda.
"Response:  We know that there were 54 cans of diet soda and 83 cans of regular soda in total. To find out how many more cans of regular soda were consumed than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of cans of diet soda from the total number of cans of soda. So, the difference between the two is:

83 - 54 = 29

Therefore, 29 more cans of regular soda were consumed than diet soda."
Response:  We know that there were 17 bottles of soda in total and 9 of them were regular soda. So, the number of bottles of diet soda is 9 - 9 = 0. Therefore, none of the bottles contained diet soda.
Response:  If bir market 19 cans of diet soda and 60 cans of regular soda were sold, then we need to find out how many more cans of regular soda were sold compared to diet soda. We know that there are 19/60 = 0.32 cans of regular soda for each can of diet soda sold. So, if 19 cans of diet soda were sold, then 19 x 0.32 = 6 cans of regular soda were also sold. Therefore, 6 cans of regular soda were sold more than diet soda.
Response:  We know that there are 72 cans of regular soda and 32 cans of diet soda. If we subtract the number of cans of diet soda from the total number of cans of soda, we get:  72 - 32 = 40 cans of regular soda left. Now, let's find out how many more cans of regular soda were consumed than elma juice:  40 (can of regular soda) - 78 (elma juice) = 38 more cans of regular soda were consumed than elma juice. So, there were 38 more cans of regular soda consumed than elma juice.
Response:  We know that there are 36 apples and 80 bottles of regular soda. If we subtract the number of apples from the total number of bottles, we get: Total number of bottles = 80 - 36 = 44. Now, let's find out how many bottles of diet soda were available: Number of diet soda bottles = Total number of bottles x Percentage of diet soda / 100 Total number of bottles = 44 x (54/100) = 23 So, there were 23 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.
Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles of soda in total. Of those, 28 were regular soda and the remaining two were diet soda. So, we can say that 28/30 = x/10, where x is the number of bottles of diet soda consumed. Now, we are asked how many bottles of diet soda were consumed. Therefore, we can substitute x into the equation above: 28/30 = x/10. Solving for x, we get x = 4. So, four bottles of diet soda were consumed.
"Response:  If there were initially 4 bottles of diet soda and they dranked 79 more bottles after that, then the total number of bottles consumed is:  
Total number of bottles = Initial number of bottles + Additional bottles consumed  
= 4 + 79  
= 83
Therefore, if they dranked more than 79 bottles of diet soda, they would have consumed 83 bottles in total."
Response:  We know that there are 57 bottles of regular soda and 26 bottles of diet soda. So, in total, there are 83 bottles (57 + 26). Now we need to find out how many liters each bottle contains. According to the information given in the passage, one liter of regular soda costs $1.99, while one liter of diet soda costs $1.49. Therefore, if we convert all the bottles into liters, we will get: Regular Soda: 83 bottles x $1.99/bottle = 160.77 liters Diet Soda: 26 bottles x $1.49/bottle = 37.66 liters Total: 160.77 + 37.66 = 208.43 liters So, the total number of liters of soda purchased is 208.43 liters.
Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda. So, if we subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the total number of bottles, we get:  Number of regular soda bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of diet soda bottles = 81 - 60 = 21. Therefore, there are 21 more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles.
Response:  We know that there are 49 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda. So, in total, there are 89 bottles (49 + 40). Now, we need to find out how many bottles of regular soda and diet soda were consumed. To do this, we can divide the number of bottles of each type by the total number of bottles. For regular soda, we have 89 / 49 = 1.77 bottles per person. For diet soda, we have 89 / 40 = 2.175 bottles per person. Therefore, 17 people consumed one or more bottles of regular soda, and 21 people consumed one or more bottles of diet soda.
Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and Rachel learned that 317 people visited today, then the number of visitors yesterday was 295 (since you subtract the number of visitors from today from the total number of visitors). So, the answer is 295.
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to the palace yesterday and Rachel learned that 256 of them visited today, then we can calculate how many people visited the palace in total as follows: Total number of visitors = Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors today Total number of visitors = 703 + 256 = 959 Therefore, according to the information provided, 959 people visited Buckingham Palace in the last 25 days.
Response:  If there were initially 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace and then another 440 visitors after that (as stated in the question), then the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day would be:  100 + (440 - 100) = 340 visitors. Therefore, the answer is 340.
Response:  If they visited Buckingham Palace after having a healthy meal and Rachel found out that 132 people visited the palace that day, then we can calculate how many people visited the palace in total as follows: Total number of visitors = Number of visitors on the day + Number of previous visits Total number of visitors = 132 + (Number of days x Number of previous visits) Total number of visitors = 132 + (327 x x) Where x is the number of days between the last visit and today's date. Since there are 327 days between the last visit and today's date, we get: Total number of visitors = 132 + (327 x x) = 132 + (327 x 406) = 132 + 130,420 = 562,420 Therefore, 562,420 people visited Buckingham Palace in total over the given period.
Response:  If 45 people visited Buckingham Palace yesterday and they are now at the palace today, then there will be 45 + (number of days since their visit) visitors in total. Since it has been 85 days since their visit, the number of visitors to the palace today is: 45 + 85 = 130. Therefore, 130 people visited Buckingham Palace today.
Response:  If there were 188 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the previous day and they visited it again today, then the total number of visitors in the past 57 days would be: 188 x 57 = 10,696. So, during this period, approximately 10,696 people visited Buckingham Palace.
Response:  If there were 39 tables in the palace that day and Rachel found out that 661 people visited the palace that day, then we can calculate the number of visitors per table as follows: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of tables = 661 / 39 = 17 visitors per table. Now, if there were 600 visitors the previous day, we can calculate the increase in visitors as follows: Increase in visitors = New number of visitors - Old number of visitors = 661 - 600 = 61 additional visitors. So, between the two days, there were 61 more visitors to the palace.
Response:  If there were 419 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 103 visitors today, then the total number of visitors in the past two days is: 419 + 103 = 522 visitors. So, in the past two days, 522 people have visited Buckingham Palace.
Response:  If there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and Rachel learned that 471 visitors came last week, then the total number of visitors in the past 89 days is:  Total visitors = Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors last week - Number of visitors last year  Total visitors = 512 + 471 - 808  Total visitors = 663 Therefore, in the past 89 days, approximately 663 people visited Buckingham Palace.
Response:  If there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 191 visitors two weeks ago, then the number of visitors in the past 245 days is:  705 - 191 = 514 visitors. So, there are 514 more visitors than in the previous period.
Response:  We have 159 grams of balm and we need 628 grams in total for all the trays. So, we need (628 - 159) = 469 grams more balm. Therefore, there are 469 grams of balm left.
Response:  We have 288 grams of ice cream that we need to divide among 10 scoops. Each scoop requires 49 grams of ice cream. So, how many scoops can we make with the available amount of ice cream? To find out, we can divide the total weight of ice cream (288 grams) by the weight required for each scoop (49 grams): Number of scoops = Total weight of ice cream / Weight required for each scoop  Number of scoops = 288 grams / 49 grams  Number of scoops = 5 scoops Therefore, there are 5 scoops of ice cream that we can make with the available amount of ice cream.
Response:  We have 57 grams of rice and beans together, which means we need 104 grams (57 + 47) more to make 353 grams in total. So, there are 29 grams of rice and beans left after making 353 grams. Therefore, there are 65 grams of rice and beans used altogether.
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of balm are needed for each tray. So we divide the total weight of balm (166g) by the number of trays (4). Then we get the amount of balm needed per tray: 166/4 = 41g. Now we know that there are 20g of balm available, so we subtract this from the amount of balm needed per tray: 41 - 20 = 21g. Therefore, we need an additional 21g of balm to fill all four trays.
Response:  We have 557 grams of balm available, and we currently need only 17 grams. To find out how many total grams of balm are needed, we can divide the amount of balm available (557 grams) by the amount of balm needed (17 grams):  Total number of grams of balm needed = 557 grams / 17 grams = 32 grams So, we need 32 grams of balm in addition to the 17 grams we already have.
Response:  We have 11 grams of balm in total, which means we need 481 grams (492 - 11) more balm to fill all the spaces between the tiles. So, we need an additional 481 / 11 = 43.7 grams of balm. Therefore, we need 43.7 + 11 = 54.7 grams of balm in total.
"Response:  If there are 94 top players and they can make 90 fruit bags in 6 days, then we need to calculate how many fruit bags each player can make per day. To do this, we divide the total number of fruit bags that can be made (90) by the number of days available (6):

Number of fruit bags each player can make per day = Total number of fruit bags / Number of days available
= 90 / 6
= 15
So, each player can make 15 fruit bags per day."
Response:  If there are 266 players and they can pick 90 figs in 5 days, then each player will be able to pick how many figs per day?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of figs that can be picked (90) by the number of players (266). So, each player will be able to pick 34 figs per day ($90 / $266 = 34$).
Response:  We know that in total there are 294 toplayıcı and they produce 244 fruit bags per day. So, we can calculate the number of fruit bags produced each day as follows: Number of fruit bags = Total number of toplayıcı x Number of fruit bags produced per day Now, let's find out how many days it takes for them to produce all these fruit bags. To do this, we need to divide the total number of fruit bags produced by the number of days taken to produce them: Days taken to produce all fruit bags = Total number of fruit bags / Number of fruit bags produced per day Now, we have two values: The total number of fruit bags produced is 244, and the number of fruit bags produced per day is 244/146 = 165. Therefore, it takes approximately 165 days for the toplayıcı to produce all the fruit bags.
Response:  We know that in total there are 235 trees and they produce fruit for 77 days. So, we can calculate the number of fruits produced per day as follows: Number of fruits = Total number of trees x Number of days  Number of fruits = 235 x 77 = 18,695 fruits. Therefore, during those 77 days, approximately 18,695 fruits were produced.
Response:  If he can control 57 pieces of fruit in 1 minute (which is equal to 57 seconds), then he can control 57 x 10 = 570 pieces of fruit in 1 hour. Similarly, if he can control 570 pieces of fruit in 1 hour, then he can control 570 x 24 = 13680 pieces of fruit in 1 day. Finally, if he can control 13680 pieces of fruit in 1 day, then he can control 13680 x 30 = 41040 pieces of fruit in 30 days. Therefore, there are 41040 pieces of fruit that are controlled in 30 days.
Response:  If there are 36 toplayıcı and each of them fills up 8 bags of figs per day, then in one day, they will fill up 36 x 8 = 288 bags of figs. Now, if we want to know how many days it takes for them to fill up 240 bags of figs, we can divide the total number of bags by the number of bags filled per day: 240 / 288 = 0.85 days. Therefore, it will take approximately 0.85 days (or 17 hours) for the 36 toplayıcı to fill up 240 bags of figs.
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums and each aquarium has a different number of fish. So, we can conclude that the total number of fish in all 26 aquariums is equal to 26 x (number of fish in one aquarium). Since there are 52 fish in total, we can write an equation as follows: Number of fish in all aquariums = 26 x Number of fish in one aquarium  Now, let's solve for the number of fish in each aquarium: Number of fish in one aquarium = Total number of fish / Number of aquariums  Substituting the value given in the problem, we get: Number of fish in one aquarium = 52 / 26  Number of fish in one aquarium = 2 Therefore, there are 2 fish in each aquarium.
Response:  We know that there are 40 fish in total and each aquarium has 2 fish. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of aquariums = Number of fish / Number of fish per aquarium. In this case, the number of fish is 40 and the number of fish per aquarium is 2, so we can plug these values into the equation: Total number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums. Therefore, there were 20 aquariums in the given scenario.
Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums for fish and other sea creatures. Since each aquarium can hold 39 animals, we have a total of 56 x 39 = 2174 animals in all the aquariums combined. So, Tyler has 2174 fish and other sea creatures in his aquariums.
Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums for sweet water fish and 22 aquariums for brackish water fish. Since each aquarium has 46 fish, we can calculate the total number of fish as follows: Total number of sweet water fish = Number of aquariums x Number of fish per aquarium = 74 x 46 = 3380 fishTotal number of brackish water fish = Number of aquariums x Number of fish per aquarium = 22 x 46 = 952 fishTherefore, Tyler has 3380 sweet water fish and 952 brackish water fish in his aquarium collection.
Response:  We know that there are 15 aquariums for animals and 62 aquariums for fish. Each aquarium has 19 animals or fish. So, in total, we have:  Aquariums for animals = 15 x 19 = 285 animals Aquariums for fish = 62 x 19 = 1178 fish In total, there are 285 + 1178 = 1463 living creatures in the two types of aquariums.
Response:  If Ann buys 13 pieces of white dresses and each package contains 5 dresses, then how many packages will she buy? So, the answer is 13 / 5 = 2.6 packages.
Response:  If Ann buys 66 beige t-shirts and each package contains 3 beige t-shirts, then we need to find out how many packages she can buy. We know that 66 / 3 = 22 packages of beige t-shirts. So, Ann can buy 22 packages of beige t-shirts.
Response:  If Annem has 56 beyaz t-shirts in total and she wants to sell them in packages of 28 t-shirts each, then we need to find out how many packages she can make with these t-shirts. To do this, we divide the total number of t-shirts (56) by the number of t-shirts per package (28): 56 / 28 = 2 So, Annem can make 2 packages of beyaz t-shirts using all 56 t-shirts.
Response:  If Ann has 53 packages of white dresses and she buys 57 packages in total, then she will have 53 + 57 = 109 packages of white dresses altogether. Since there are 34 pairs of pants among these packages, we can calculate the number of white dresses as follows: Number of white dresses = Total packages - Number of pants x Number of packages per pair = 109 - 34 x 2 = 65 White dresses
Response:  If Annem has 51 white shirts and she can buy three packs of white shirts at once, then we need to find out how many packs she can buy with 51 shirts. To do this, we divide 51 by 3, which gives us 17. So, Annem can buy 17 packs of white shirts with her 51 shirts.
Response:  If Annem buys 70 white shirts and each package contains 5 white shirts, then she will buy 7 packages of white shirts. So, if she buys 14 packages in total, each package will contain how many white shirts?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of white shirts in each package = Total number of white shirts / Number of packages = 70 / 7 = 10 white shirts per package. Therefore, there are 10 white shirts in each package that Annem buys.
"Response:  If there are 4 baskets and each basket contains an equal number of cookies (say x), then the total number of cookies in all baskets is 36 (since there are 4 baskets). So, we can write the equation:

x + x + x + x = 36...(1)

Now, since there are 4 baskets, each basket contains an equal number of cookies. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

x = 9...(2)

Substituting Equation (2) into Equation (1), we get:

9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36

Simplifying, we get:

36 = 36

So, each basket contains 9 cookies."
Response:  If there are 33 balls in total and each basket has 11 balls, then... (1) The number of baskets is equal to the total number of balls divided by the number of balls in each basket. So, (2) In this case, the number of baskets = 33 / 11 = 3 baskets. Therefore, there are 3 baskets with 11 balls in each basket.
Response:  If her çantada (bag) contains 41 kurabiyes and she has 53 çantanız (bags), then we can calculate how many kurabiyes are in each bag as follows: Number of kurabiyes per bag = Total number of kurabiyes / Number of bags So, the number of kurabiyes in each bag is: 41/53 = 0.78 We can round this value to the nearest whole number, which gives us approximately 1 kurabiye per bag. Therefore, if her çantada contains 41 kurabiyes and she has 53 bags, she will have approximately 1 kurabiye in each bag.
Response:  If there are 14 total pieces of candy and 7 cups, then each cup contains how many pieces of candy?  To find out, we can divide the total number of candies by the number of cups:  Number of candies per cup = Total number of candies / Number of cups  In this case, the total number of candies is 14, and the number of cups is 7, so we can calculate the number of candies in each cup as follows:  Number of candies per cup = 14 / 7 = 2  So, each cup contains 2 pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that her çantada (bag) has 3 kurabiyes (chocolates). So, we have 3 kurabiyes in total. Then, we are asked how many çantas (bags) there are in total if each bag contains 7 kurabiyes. To find out, we divide the number of kurabiyes in one bag by 7: 3 / 7 = 0.43. Since you can't have a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number: 0.43 rounded up is 1 bag. Therefore, there is 1 bag with 7 kurabiyes in total.
Response:  We have 26 pieces of candy and 15 pieces of chocolate. If we buy all these together, we will get 41 candies in total (26 + 15 = 41). Now, if we divide this number by 52, which is the number of pieces of bread, we will get the number of bags of bread that can be filled with the remaining pieces of candy after buying all the chocolates. So, there will be 0.8 bags of bread left over (41 / 52 = 0.8). Therefore, there will be 7 bags of bread left over after buying all the chocolates (0.8 x 7 = 5.6).
Response:  We have 28 pieces of candy and 86 cookies. If we divide them equally among 14 bags, each bag will contain:  Number of candies = Total number of candies / Number of bags = 28 / 14 = 2 pieces of candy per bag. Number of cookies = Total number of cookies / Number of bags = 86 / 14 = 6 cookies per bag. Therefore, there are 2 bags of candy with 2 pieces of candy in each bag, and 14 bags of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. So, in total, there are 2 + 14 = 16 bags of sweets.
Response:  If one blogger posts to each block 5 times, then there will be total of 5 x number of blocks = 5 x 10 = 50 posts in all the blocks combined.  Now, if each block has 25 posts, then there are 50 / 25 = 2 blocks in each block. So, there are 2 blocks in total.
Response:  There are 9 posts per block and there are 20 blocks in total. So, we need to calculate how many posts there are in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of posts per block with the number of blocks:  Total Posts = Number of Posts per Block x Number of Blocks  Total Posts = 9 x 20  Total Posts = 180 posts
Response:  If there are 6 blocks and each block has 24 posts, then we have to divide 132 (the total number of posts) by 6 (the number of blocks). So, each block has 22 posts (132/6=22). Therefore, each house will have 22 posts in total.
Response:  If the worker posts one letter to each block every day, then in how many days will he finish posting all letters?  Since there are 14 letters in total and the worker posts two letters per day, it will take him 7 days to finish posting all letters. So, if the worker starts posting letters on Day 1, he will finish on Day 8 (since there are only 7 days left after Day 7). Therefore, there are 8 blocks in total.
Response:  We have 20 blocks with 32 posts each, so we need to calculate how many posts are in total.  Total number of posts = Number of blocks x Number of posts per block = 20 x 32 = 640 posts.
Response:  We have to send 30 posts from each of the 78 blocks to their respective addresses. Since there are 19 houses in each block, we need to divide 30 by 19 to find out how many posts can be sent to each house. So, the answer is: Each house will receive 1.6 posts (30/19).
Response:  If there are 55 blocks and each block has 8 posts, then the total number of posts is:  Posts = Number of blocks x Number of posts per block = 55 x 8 = 440 posts. Now, if one block contains 32 posts, then we can find out how many blocks there are by dividing the total number of posts by the number of posts in one block: Blocks = Total posts / Number of posts per block = 440 / 32 = 14 blocks. Therefore, there are 14 blocks in total.
Response:  There are 81 blocks in total and each block has 4 posts. So, the total number of posts is 81 x 4 = 324 posts. Since there are 12 ev (units) in each block, the total number of posts per unit is 324 / 12 = 27 posts per unit. Therefore, the answer is 27 posts per unit.
Response:  We have 16 blocks and each block has 4 posts. So, total number of posts = 16 x 4 = 64. Since there are 17 villagers in total, we need to divide the total number of posts by 17 to find out how many posts each villager will receive. Therefore, the answer is 64 / 17 = 3.82 posts per villager.
Response:  We have 10 cups of water and 20 marbles. To make groups of 4 people, we need to divide these into equal parts. So, let's divide them equally among 4 groups. Group 1 will get 2 cups of water and 5 marbles each (since there are 4 people in this group). Group 2 will get 3 cups of water and 6 marbles each (again, since there are 4 people in this group). And so on... Now, let's calculate how many marbles each person in each group will get: Group 1 - 5 marbles/person x 4 people = 20 marbles Group 2 - 6 marbles/person x 4 people = 24 marbles Group 3 - 7 marbles/person x 4 people = 28 marbles Group 4 - 8 marbles/person x 4 people = 32 marbles Therefore, we can create 4 different groups with an equal number of marbles and cups of water for each group.
Response:  We have 10 bags of rice and 15 jars of honey to distribute among 5 groups. To find out how many items each group will get, we can divide the total number of items (10 + 15 = 25) by the number of groups (5). So, each group will get 5 items in total. Therefore, there will be 5 groups.
Response:  If there are 11 people in each group and each group has 2 yogurt cups, then the total number of yogurt cups is: 11 x 2 = 22 yogurt cups. So, Rebecca has 22 yogurt cups.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 yogurt and she wants to distribute them among 4 groups. So, each group will get how many yogurt?  To find out, we can divide 8 (the total number of yogurt) by 4 (the number of groups).  Therefore, each group will get 2 yogurt.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 bags of apples and 15 jars of jam. She wants to divide them into three groups. So we need to find out how many jars of jam each group will get. To do this, we can use division. For example, if she divides the jars equally among the three groups, each group will get 5 jars (15 / 3 = 5). But since there are only 4 bags of apples, one bag won't be used in any of the groups. Therefore, Group 1 will have 3 bags of apples (4 - 1 = 3), Group 2 will have 2 bags (4 - 2 = 2), and Group 3 will have 1 bag (4 - 3 = 1). Now let's count the total number of jars for each group: Group 1: 3 x 5 = 15 Group 2: 2 x 5 = 10 Group 3: 1 x 5 = 5 In conclusion, each group will have 15 jars of jam.
Response:  We have to divide 18 yumurtas among 4 groups of people. Each group can take at most 4-5 yumurtas (since there are only 4 people in each group). So we need at least 4 groups. Now let's consider the number of mus. Since there are 72 mus and 4 groups, each group will get at most 18 mus ( since there are only 4 people in each group). Similarly, for mermaids, since there are 66 mermaids and 4 groups, each group will get at most 16 mermaids (again, since there are only 4 people in each group). Therefore, we will have 4 groups with 18 yumurtas, 18 mus, and 16 mermaids each.
"Response:  We have 3 types of objects: mus (99), yumurtas (9), and mermaids (27). To group these objects into three categories, we can use the following criteria:
1. Mus - 99 objects
2. Yumurtas - 9 objects
3. Mermaids - 27 objects
So, there are 3 groups or categories: Mus, Yumurtas, and Mermaids."
Response:  We know that there are 5 people in each group and Rebecca has 20 marbles. So, total number of marbles = Number of groups x Number of marbles per group + Rebecca's marbles. Total number of marbles = 5 x 20 + 20 = 140 marbles. Therefore, Rebecca has more than 40 marbles (140 - 40 = 100) than the other children combined.
Response:  We know that there are 20 people in total and each person will collect 5 tomatoes and 12 eggs from Rebecca. So, the total number of tomatoes collected is 5 x 20 = 100 tomatoes. Now, we need to find out how many more tomatoes than eggs were collected. The number of eggs collected is 12 x 20 = 240 eggs. Therefore, the difference between the number of tomatoes and eggs collected is 100 - 240 = -140 tomatoes. Since it can't be negative, we conclude that Rebecca has more than 12 tomatoes.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points and won every round, then he would have played x rounds. Since each round has 11 points, we can write an equation: 154 = x \* 11. Solving for x, we get: x = 13 (rounded to nearest integer). So, Luke played 13 rounds.
Response:  If you score 46 points in each turn and there are 10 turns in total, then the number of points scored is:  Points = Number of turns x Score per turn So, the answer is: Points = 10 x 46 = 460
Response:  If Luke got 84 points in one round and he wins every round with the same number of points (let's call it x), then the total number of points he will get is equal to the number of rounds times his score per round, which is x. So, the total number of points Luke will get is: Total Points = Number of Rounds x Score Per Round = x x Number of Rounds = x^2. Therefore, Luke will get x^2 points if he wins every round with the same number of points.
Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in the previous game and he played another game of 157 questions, then he would have scored additional 157 - 146 = 11 points in this new game. Therefore, he scored 158 points in total (146 + 11).
Response:  If Luke got 78 points in one game and he played each round for 3 points, then he must have played 26 rounds (78/3 = 26).
Response:  We know that there are 2 pins and we need to fill 32 holes with them. So, each hole needs 16 pins (32 / 2 = 16). Therefore, there will be 16 pins left over after filling all 32 holes.
Response:  We know that there are 11 marbles in total and each marble is made up of 28 balls. So, to find out how many balls Emily has used, we can divide the number of marbles by the number of balls in each marble. In this case, we have: Number of marbles = 11 Total number of balls = 28/ball  Therefore, Emily has used 28/ball x 11 = 304 balls.
Response:  If Emily has 8 balls for each of her friends, and each friend gets 1 ball from Emily, then how many friends does she have in total?  Total number of friends = Number of balls given to friends x Number of friends per ball  Total number of friends = 8 x 4 (since there are 4 friends)  Total number of friends = 32 friends So, Emily can give out 32 collets to her friends.
Response:  We know that there are 18 balls in total and 6 of them have been used to make holes in the rubber bands. So, we need to find out how many balls are left after making these 6 holes. To do this, we can divide the number of remaining balls (18) by the number of balls used for each hole (6): Number of balls used per hole = 6 ∕ 18 = 0.33 or 3/10 balls. Since there are 10 balls left after making these 6 holes, we can conclude that each ball was used to make approximately 3 holes. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Emily took 5 marbles for each of her friends and she gave them to 4 of her friends. So, in total, Emily gave away 5 x 4 = 20 marbles. Therefore, Emily had 20 - 4 = 16 marbles left with herself.
Response:  If Emily has 72 friends and each friend needs 3 rubber bands for their hair, then the total number of rubber bands needed is: 72 x 3 = 216. So, Emily can make 216 hair buns.
Response:  If Emily has 5 balls and can make 20 marbles with each ball, then she needs to make 5 x 20 = 100 marbles in total. So, there are 100 marbles needed for her 43 friends.
Response:  We know that Emily has 44 friends and she gave each of them a rubber ball. So, in total, she gave away 44 balls. Then we are told that she gave 26 balls to each friend, which means she gave a total of 26 x 26 = 676 balls. Since each ball contains two marbles, the total number of marbles given away is 676 x 2 = 1352 marbles. Therefore, Emily had 1352 - 44 = 1308 marbles left after giving away all the balls.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children who went to camp and 668278 children who stayed at home. So, we need to find out how many more children were in the camp than at home. To do this, we can subtract the number of children at home from the total number of children: 819058 - 668278 = 150780. Therefore, 150780 more children were in the camp than at home.
Response:  We know that there are 202958 children who went on vacation with their families in Lawrence County and 777622 children who stayed at home. So, we need to find out how many children stayed at home among those who did not go on vacation. To do this, we can subtract the number of children who went on vacation from the total number of children:  Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went on vacation  Number of children who stayed at home = 777622 - 202958  Number of children who stayed at home = 574664 Therefore, 574664 children stayed at home among those who did not go on vacation.
"Response: 
Lawrence county has 898 children and 629424 of them are in camp. So, the number of children who are not in camp is: 898 - 629424 = 278386. Therefore, there are 278386 children at home."
Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in total and they will be divided into groups of 274865 children each for camping. So, we need to find out how many groups can fit in during the trip. To do this, we divide the total number of children (313473) by the number of children per group (274865): 313473 / 274865 = 11 Groups Now, let's assume that each group has 10 children on average (this is just an assumption, as the actual number may vary). Therefore, the total number of children who will go on the trip is: 11 x 10 = 110 Children
Response:  We know that there are 907611 children who go to summer camp in Lawrence County and 455682 of them stay at home. So, we need to find out how many children stay at home in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of children who go to summer camp with the ratio of those who stay at home: Number of children who stay at home = Total number of children x Ratio of children who stay at home Total number of children = 907611 x (455682/907611) = 378051 Therefore, there are 378051 children who stay at home in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that there are 800059 children who went on vacation with Lawrence and 746763 children who stayed at home in Lawrence County. So, the number of children who stayed at home is: 746763 - 800059 = 626104. Therefore, there are 626104 children who stayed at home in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that Yaz has moved out of Lawrence County and there are 91676 children in total in Lawrence County. So, if Yaz was among those 91676 children, then he/she would be counted twice (once as a resident of Lawrence County and once as a migrant). Therefore, we need to subtract the number of children who were already residents of Lawrence County from the total number of children in Lawrence County. This gives us 61619 - 91676 = -30055 children who lived in Lawrence County but not anymore.
Response:  We know that there are 34044 children who went on vacation with Lawrence and 134867 children who stayed at home. So, in total, there are 45451 (34044 + 134867) children. Now we need to find out how many more children joined from outside the district. According to the question, 424944 additional children joined from outside the district. Therefore, the final number of children who joined is 45451 + 424944 = 469455 children.
Response:  We know that there are 610769 children in total and 590796 of them stay at home. So, we have to find out how many children are from outside the county. To do this, we need to subtract the number of children who stay at home from the total number of children. Therefore, the number of children from outside the county is: 610769 - (590796) = 200003.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children at home and 893835 children in camp. So, the total number of children is: 644997 + 893835 = 1538232. Since there are more than 78 children from outside the county, we can conclude that there are exactly 78 children from Lawrence County. Therefore, the answer is (78).
Response:  We know that Adam has 6 elmases more than Jackie. So, if Jackie has x elmases, then Adam has 6 + x elmases. Since Adam has 9 elmases in total, we can write the equation: 6 + x = 9. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 9 - 6. Therefore, Jackie has 3 elmases.
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. So, in total, we have 10 + 2 = 12 apples. Therefore, there are 12 - 2 = 10 apples left after Jackie takes 2 apples.
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So, the difference between Jackie's apples and Adam's apples is:  10 - 9 = 1. Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  Jackie has 10 elmas, and Adam has 8 elmas. To find out how many elmas Jackie has more than Adam, we need to subtract the number of elmas Adam has from the total number of elmas Jackie has. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  10 - 8 = 2 Therefore, Jackie has 2 more elmas than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 6 apples between them. If Adam has x apples and Jackie has y apples, then we can write the equation: x + y = 6. Since Adam has more than half of the total number of apples (he has 4 more), we can say that x > 3. Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get: 3x + y = 6. Now, we need to find out how many apples Jackie has. So, we subtract 3x from both sides of the equation: y = 3(6 - 3x). Simplifying, we get: y = 9. Therefore, there are 9 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 9 apples in total. So, if we subtract the number of apples they have (7) from their total number of apples, we get:  $9 - 7 = 2$ apples left. Therefore, there are 2 more apples than Adam and Jackie have.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 10 apples (he has 12). So, he must have at least 13 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples Jackie has. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, Jackie has 4 apples less than Adam. Therefore, Jackie has 9 apples. Finally, since both of them together have more than 10 apples, there are 11 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has 10 apples, then Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 apples. Now we know that Adam and Jackie together have 20 apples (10 from Jackie and 10 from Adam). Therefore, there are 20 - 6 = 14 apples left after taking away the total number of apples that Adam and Jackie have. So, Adam has 14 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, then Adam must have 90 oranges (since he has 5 more than Jackie) and 16 apples (since he has 5 more than Jackie). Therefore, Adam has 90 oranges and 16 apples.
Response:  On Helen's birthday (June 3), she had eaten 31 cookies. Today is June 5th, so yesterday she ate 270 more cookies. Therefore, in total, Helen has eaten 301 cookies until today (including the ones she ate on her birthday). So, the number of cookies Helen ate between June 3rd and June 5th is: 301 - 31 = 270.
Response:  Yesterday (dün), Helen made 90 chocolate cookies and today she has added 51 more. So, in total, Helen has baked 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate cookies. Now, let's calculate how many chocolate cookies Helen has given away. According to the question, Helen gave away 484 chocolate cookies. Therefore, the number of chocolate cookies that Helen kept for herself is:  Number of chocolate cookies kept by Helen = Total number of chocolate cookies - Number of chocolate cookies given away = 141 - 484 = -340. So, Helen did not make any chocolate cookies yesterday.
Response:  On yesterday (dün), Helen made 527 chocolate cookies and 86 chocolate chip cookies. Today (Bu sabah), she made 86 chocolate chip cookies and 554 chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen baked 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate cookies.
"Response:  On yesterday (dün), Helen made 144 chocolate-covered Kurabiyes and 397 plain Kurabiyes. So in total, she made 541 Kurabiyes. Today (bu sabah), Helen made 85 chocolate-covered Kurabiyes and 403 plain Kurabiyes. In total, she made 588 Kurabiyes today. Now we need to find out how many chocolate-covered Kurabiyes Helen made today compared to yesterda
Answer:  Helen made 36 more chocolate-covered Kurabiyes today than she did yesterday."
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Helen has prepared 19 chocolate-covered Kurdish nuts and 231 regular Kurdish nuts for her guests. If we subtract the number of chocolate-covered Kurdish nuts from the total number of Kurdish nuts, we get: Number of regular Kurdish nuts = Total number of Kurdish nuts - Number of chocolate-covered Kurdish nuts = 231 - 19 = 212 So, there are 212 more regular Kurdish nuts than chocolate-covered ones.
Response:  Yesterday (dün), Helen had 197 chocolate-covered cookies and 46 chocolate chip cookies. Today (bugüne), she has 75 more chocolate chip cookies than yesterday. So, in total, Helen has 272 chocolate chip cookies today.
Response:  Yesterday (dün) Helen had 519 chocolate-covered Kurabiyes and today she has 280 more of them, so in total she has 799 chocolate-covered Kurabiyes. Additionally, yesterday she had 300 regular Kurabiyes and today she has 359 more of them, so in total she has 659 regular Kurabiyes. Therefore, the difference between the number of chocolate-covered Kurabiyes and regular Kurabiyes that Helen had yesterday and today is:  799 - 659 = 140. So, Helen had 140 more chocolate-covered Kurabiyes today than she did yesterday.
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 DS games and her friends have 59 games. So, we need to find out how many more games Katie's friends have than she does. To do this, we can subtract the number of games Katie has from the number of games her friends have: 59 - 81 = -22. Therefore, Katie's friends have more than twice as many games as Katie does.
Response:  According to the question, Katie has 91 DS games and her new friends have 88 games. So, the total number of games that Katie and her new friends have is: 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now, let's consider the old friends. They have 53 games in total. Therefore, the total number of games among all four groups of friends is: 179 + 53 = 232 games.
Response:  Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So, in total, they have 126 (78 + 48) new games. Now, let's compare this to the old games. Katie has 86 old games, and her friends have 86 old games as well. Therefore, the total number of new games is equal to the total number of old games, which is 172 (86 x 2). Hence, there are 172 new games in total.
"Response: 
Katie has 84 new games and her friends have 19 old games. So, in total, they have 103 games (84 + 19).
Now, let's find out how many new games Katie has. Since she has 84 new games, each of her friends must have had at least 2 new games (since there are 8 friends). Therefore, the number of new games that Katie's friends have is at most 8 - 2 = 6.
So, the total number of new games among all the players is 84 + 6 = 90."
Response:  We know that Katie has 62 new games and her friends have 73 new games. So, in total, they have 62 + 73 = 135 new games. Now, we need to find out how many old games they have. According to the question, Katie's friends have 80 old games, so Katie must have some old games too. Therefore, the number of old games Katie has is equal to the number of old games her friends have minus the number of old games she already played. So, Katie has 80 - 41 = 39 old games.
Response:  We know that Katie played 57 games with her friends and also played 63 DS games. So, we can say that the total number of games she played is:  57 + 63 = 120 games. Therefore, there are more than 120 games among Katie's friend's collection.
"Response: 
Katie has 57 new games and her friends have 34 new games. So, in total, they have 91 new games (57 + 34). Now, let's compare this to the number of old games they had. Katie had 39 old games, and her friends had 34 old games, so together they had 73 old games (39 + 34). Therefore, Katie's friends have more old games than Katie does."
Response:  First week, Fred had $60 and spent $20, so he has $40 left. Then Jason joined with $19 and they spent together $30, so now they have $70 left. Finally, Jason bought an car for $33 and sold it for $33, so he gained nothing. So, the total amount of money that Jason gained is zero.
"Response: 
Fred had $86 last week and earned $5 more this week. So, his current amount is $91.
Jason did not work this week, so he still has $0.
So, the total amount of money they have now is $91 + $0 = $91."
"Response: 
Fred had $19 last week and earned $40 this week, so his total earnings are: 
$19 + $40 = $59. 
Jason had $16 last week and earned $69 this week, so his total earnings are: 
$16 + $69 = $85."
Response:  We know that Fred had $114 last week and lost $21 this week, so his new amount is $93 ($114 - $21).  Similarly, we know that Jason had $22 last week and gained $78 this week, so his new amount is $100 ($22 + $78). Therefore, Jason gained $32 more than Fred this week. So, Jason's new amount is $100 (Jason's gain) = $132 (Fred's loss).
"Response: 
Fred had $111 last week and earned $40 more this week, so his total amount of money now is $151 ($111 + $40). 
Jason had $40 last week and earns $44 more this week, so his total amount of money now is $84 ($40 + $44). 
To find out how much they both gained in total, we need to subtract their initial amounts from their current amounts: 
$151 - $84 = $67 (Fred gained $67) 
$84 - $40 = $44 (Jason gained $44)"
"Response: 
Fred had $49 last week and earned $3 more this week, so he has $52 now ($49 + $3). 
Jason had $0 last week and is currently selling newspapers for $63, so he has earned $63 - $0 = $63."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred earned $78 last week and Jason earned $31 last week. Then, Jason spent $14 to buy a newspaper. After that, Fred bought an car for $90. So, the total amount of money they have now is: Fred - $78 + $14 = $92 Jason - $31 + $14 = $45 Now, let's calculate how much each person has after buying the newspaper: Fred - $92 / 2 = $46 Jason - $45 / 2 = $22.5 Therefore, Fred has $46 and Jason has $22.5 after buying the newspaper.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred earned $33 last week and Jason earned $95 last week. So, their total earnings are:  $33 + $95 = $128. Now, let's consider what Fred did during the week. He sold newspapers for $16 and did car washing work worth $74. So, his income from these activities is: $16 + $74 = $90. Therefore, Fred's total earnings for the week are: $128 - $90 = $38.
"Response: 
Fred had $47 last week, plus he made $111 from selling newspapers, so his total amount of money now is:
$47 + $111 = $158
Then, he spent $34 on gasoline, so his new balance is:
$158 - $34 = $124
Therefore, Fred currently has $124 in his pocket."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie lost 20 kg after she started running every day. So her current weight is 71 - 20 = 51 kg.
Response:  Jessie started running at 27 kg and gained 101 kg after one year of running every day. So, in one year, she gained 101 - 27 = 74 kg. Therefore, before starting to run daily, Jessie weighed 27 kg.
Response:  If Jessie lost 126 kg after starting to run every day, then she must have weighed more than 126 kg initially. So, let's assume that her initial weight was x kg. Then, we know that she lost 126 kg - x kg through running. Now, if she currently weighs 66 kg, then we can set up an equation as follows:  x + (126 - x) = 66...(1) Substituting the value of x from the problem statement into this equation gives us:  x + (126 - x) = 66 2x = 66 - 126 2x = -60...(2) Dividing both sides of Equation (2) by 2 gives us: x = -30 kg. Therefore, Jessie weighed 30 kg before starting to run every day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie lost weight after she started running every day. So, initially, she had a weight of 69 kg. Then, she ran daily and lost some weight. After running for one year, her weight became 35 kg. Therefore, now she weighs 35 kg - 69 kg = -34 kg.
Response:  First week (50 kg) + Second week (60 kg) = Total weight lost in two weeks = 110 kg. So, Jessie is currently at 110 kg.
Response:  First week (Jessie gained 9 kg), second week (lost 62 kg) = total weight lost in first week = 71 kg. Third week (lost 140 kg) = total weight lost in three weeks = 211 kg. So, the answer is 211 kg.
Response:  First week (Jessie gained 56 kg), second week (she lost 43 kg). So in total she gained 13 kg during the first week. Therefore, her weight gain per day is: $ \frac {13}{7} = 1.86$ kg/day.
Response:  We have 95 animals in total (including both cats and dogs). If we subtract the number of cats from the total, we get: 95 - 61 = 34. So, there are 34 dogs left.
Response:  If there are 93 yılans and 97 timsah in the cage, then if 40 timsah are placed inside, there will be 57 timsah left outside (97 - 40 = 57). Therefore, 57 timsah will not fit inside the cage.
Response:  We have 3 yılans and 75 timsah in a cage. If we add 82 yılans to this cage, there will be a total of 157 animals (3 + 82 = 157). Since each yılan takes up 1/4 of the space in the cage, the number of timsah in the cage after adding more yılans is equal to 157 / 4 = 39 timsah. Therefore, if 75 timsah were already present in the cage before adding more yılans, then after adding 82 yılans, there would be a total of 39 + 75 = 114 timsah in the cage.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in the zoo. If we subtract 24 elephants and 51 monkeys, then we have 34 animals left. So, 34 animals are not saklanmiyor (not Saklanan).
Response:  On day 1, there were 171 tomatoes in the farmer's garden. On day 2, he selected 134 of them. Today (day 3), he selected an additional 30 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes left in the garden after today is: 134 + 30 = 164 tomatoes. Therefore, 97 tomatoes were left behind (171 - 164).
Response:  On day 1 (dünya), there were 160 tomatoes in the farmer's garden. Then, he selected 56 of them yesterday (bugün). Today (şühai), he selected another 41 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes left after today's selection is: 160 - 56 + 41 = 73 tomatoes. Therefore, 73 tomatoes remained after today's selection.
Response:  On day 1, there were 90 tomatoes in the farmer's garden. Then, he selected 154 tomatoes yesterday and today he selected 50 more tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes that the farmer picked is: 90 + 154 + 50 = 294 tomatoes.
Response:  We know that there were initially 175 domesticated and 77 potatoes in the garden of the farmer. Since 172 potatoes were harvested, we can deduce that 3 (175 - 172) domesticated remained in the garden. Therefore, 3 domesticated and 44 (77 - 39) potatoes were left in the garden.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 177 fruits and vegetables in the garden. If 53 of them were picked, then we have:

Domates (fruits): 177 - 53 = 124
Patates (potatoes): 12
So, there are 124 fruits and 12 potatoes left in the garden after picking 53 fruits."
Response:  We know that there were initially 105 green and 71 red tomatoes in the farmer's garden. After harvesting 137 tomatoes, we need to find out how many of them are left. So, let's subtract the number of tomatoes harvested from the total initial number of tomatoes: 105 - 137 = 30 (green) + 71 = 101 (red). Therefore, after harvesting 137 tomatoes, there are 30 green and 101 red tomatoes left in the farmer's garden.
Response:  If we use 4 people to lift the big doors, and each person can hold 2 doors, then... (1) John needs 4/2 = 2 people to lift his door. So, he has 2 doors to lift.
Response:  We know that there are 13 big pillars and each of them requires 17 bricks to complete it. Additionally, smaller pillars require 8 bricks each. So, we need to calculate how many bricks John needs for his wall. The total number of bricks required is: (13 x 17) + (8 x Number of Small Pillars) = 209 + (8 x X) = 209 + 64 = 273 bricks. Therefore, John needs 273 bricks for his wall.
Response:  We need 11 boards for the big walls and we will use 3 boards per wall. So, total number of boards needed is 11 x 3 = 33 boards. Since there are 8 people who want to use boards, we can divide 33 boards among them, giving each person 4 boards (33 / 8 = 4). Therefore, John needs 4 boards for his wall.
Response:  We know that there are 12 big columns and 10 small columns in total. To place them side by side, we need 15 column pieces for the big ones and 5 for the small ones. So, to calculate how many column pieces John needs for his wall, we can divide the total number of column pieces (30) by the number of big columns he has (12): 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since you cannot have a fraction of a column piece, John needs exactly 3 column pieces for his wall.
Response:  We know that there are 16 tahtas in total and each tahta has two pieces (4 pieces). So, we need to find out how many pieces of each size are needed for all the walls. For example, if we have 8 walls, then we will need 8 x 2 = 16 pieces of each size. Therefore, the number of pieces required is 16 x 16 = 256 pieces. Since John wants to use big stones only, we can assume that he needs at least 256 - 16 = 240 pieces of small stones.
"Response:  If we have 8 big pillars and each pillar has 74 bricks, then in total we have:

8 x 74 = 592 bricks
So, John needs 592 bricks to build his wall around his house."
Response:  If there are 12 big columns and each has 14 shelves, then we have 12 x 14 = 168 shelves for the big columns.  If there are 17 small columns and each has 25 shelves, then we have 17 x 25 = 425 shelves for the small columns.  So in total, John needs 168 + 425 = 593 shelves to fill all the spaces between the big and small columns.
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of candy in total and each package contains 3 pieces. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of packages = Number of pieces / Number of pieces per package. In this case, the total number of packages is equal to 42 / 3 = 14 packages. Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of candy.
Response:  We know that there are 43 packages in total and each package contains 23 parts. So, we have 43 x 23 = 1007 parts in total. Now, we know that Robin has 8 sets of spare parts. Since each set contains 23 parts, we can say that Robin has 8 x 23 = 186 spare parts. Therefore, the number of spare parts Robin has is 1007 - 186 = 821.
Response:  We know that there are several packages of Robin's snacks. Each package contains 7 pieces. Robin has 6 different flavors among his snacks. Therefore, the total number of pieces of all flavors is 6 x 7 = 42. Since Robin has only 41 teeth, he must have more than one package of snacks. So, the answer is greater than 1.
"Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of sakiz and 13 packages of sugar. Each package contains 4 pieces of each. So, in total, we have:
 Sakiz: 28 x 4 = 112 pieces Sugar: 13 x 4 = 52 pieces Therefore, Robin has 112 pieces of sakiz."
Response:  We know that there are 21 packages of candy and each package contains 9 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of candies is: 21 x 9 = 189. Now we need to find out how many packages of sugar Robin has. From the question, we know that Robin has 45 packages of sugar. So, the number of pieces of sugar in each package is: 45 / 9 = 5. Therefore, the total number of pieces of sugar Robin has is: 5 x 45 = 225.
Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of candy and 14 packages of sugar. Each package contains 6 pieces of candy or sugar. So, in total, we have:  Number of candies = 28 x 6 = 168 candies Number of sugars = 14 x 6 = 84 sugars Now, let's check how many pieces Robin has: Number of Robin's pieces = Total number of candies + Total number of sugars - Number of pieces per package Robin has = 168 + 84 - 6 = 258 pieces Therefore, Robin has 258 pieces of candy or sugar.
Response:  The machine can produce 3 containers in 1 minute and 6 containers in 2 minutes. So, if it takes 3 minutes to make 3 containers, then it will take x minutes to make 6 containers, where x = 3/2 = 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the machine will take 1.5 minutes to produce 6 containers.
Response:  The machine worked for 5 minutes and could produce 4 bottles in that time. So, if we divide the total production time (5 minutes) by the number of bottles produced per minute (4), we get... 4/5 = 0.8. Therefore, the machine produced 0.8 bottles during those 5 minutes.
Response:  The machine produces 9 containers in one day and currently produces 44 containers per day. If it can produce 3 containers per hour, then...
Response:  The machine can produce 13 bags in one hour, and today it produced 3 bags. In an hour, it can make 8 bags. So, the total time taken by the machine to produce all the bags is: Total time = Number of bags / Production rate per hour x Time taken to produce one bag Total time = 8/3 x x Where x is the time taken to produce one bag. Since we are given that the machine takes 5 minutes to produce one bag, so: Total time = 8/3 x 5 = 40 minutes Therefore, the machine took 40 minutes to produce all the bags.
Response:  The machine produces 9 pieces in one hour and currently produces 8 pieces per hour. So, if it can produce two pieces in one minute, then...
Response:  If the machine can produce 3 containers in one hour, then it will take 2 hours for 6 containers (since there are 2 times as many containers). So, if today it produced 8 containers, it took 1/3 of an hour to make them. Therefore, the total time taken by the machine is 8/3 = 2.67 hours.
Response:  On Monday (dünya), 6 containers were made and on Tuesday (bugün) 12 more containers were made for a total of 18 containers. So, the machine produced 18 + 12 = 30 containers in all.
Response:  If the machine can produce 6 containers in an hour and worked for 5 hours today, then it produced 6 x 5 = 30 containers today.
Response:  If they played games every day and earned $165 in total over 5 days, then we can calculate their daily earnings as follows: Daily Earnings = Total Earning / Number of Days They Played Games So, the daily earnings of each person are: $165 / 5 = $32 per day Now, let's convert this amount into an hourly wage: Hourly Wage = Daily Earnings / Time Spent Playing Games So, the hourly wage of each person is: $32 / 8 hours (assuming they play for 8 hours a day) = $4 per hour
Response:  If they won $144 in one day and played for 22 days, then their total winnings can be calculated as follows: Total Winnings = Daily Winning x Number of Days Played = $144 x 22 = $3,088 So, they won $3,088 during the carnival.
Response:  We know that in total, $420 was earned during the 30 days of carnival games. Of this amount, $22 was earned by the game and its players together. So, we can calculate the daily earnings as follows: Daily Earning = Total Earnings / Number of Days = $420 / 30 = $14 per day Now, let's find out how much each player earned per day: Player's Daily Earning = Total Earning / Number of Players = $14 / 22 = $6.36 per day Therefore, each player earned around $6.36 per day playing the carnival games.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Karnavalda spent $44 in the first 44 days and earned $382 during this period. Therefore, his total earnings are:

Total Earnings = Earning per day x Number of Days = $382 x 44 = $16,596
Now, let's find out how much he earned in the last 10 days:
Earning in Last 10 Days = Total Earnings - Earning in First 44 Days = $16,596 - $382 = $16,214
Therefore, Karnavalda earned $16,214 in the last 10 days."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Karnavalda spent $120 in the first 20 days and $66 in the remaining 16 days. So, let's calculate how much he spent per day:  To find out how much Karnavalda spent each day, we need to divide his total spending by the number of days he spent money. Therefore, we can write:  Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation:  Substituting $120 for the first 20 days and $66 for the remaining 16 days gives us:  Finally, simplifying this expression gives us:  Therefore, Karnavalda spent an average of $78 per day during his trip.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that $Karnavalda$ spent $154 dollars in the first 154 days and earned $325 dollars during this period. Therefore, their profit is given by:
Profit = Earned amount - Spent amount = $325 - $154 = $171
Now, after 57 more days, they earned $114 dollars and spent nothing. So, their new balance is:
New Balance = Profit + Earning from last 57 days = $171 + ($114 x 57/154) = $171 + $6,098 = $6,269
Therefore, the remaining amount of money that $Karnavalda$ had after 57 additional days is $6,269."
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 10 packs of Kurabiye and 4 packs of Pasta. So far, she has spent $10 + $4 = $14. Now we need to find out how many more packs of Kurabiye Lucy bought. To do this, we will divide the total amount she spent ($14) by the cost per pack of Kurabiye ($1). This gives us: $14 / $1 = 14 packs of Kurabiye. Therefore, Lucy bought 14 additional packs of Kurabiye beyond the ones she already had (10 packs).
Response:  Paket Kurabiye = 4 x 1 = 4  Paket Kek = 22 x 1 = 22  Paket Çikolata = 16 x 1 = 16 Therefore, Lucy has purchased 4 + 22 + 16 = 42 packages in total.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packages of snacks and a few packages of pasta. So, she bought at least 26 packages (23 + a few). Therefore, Lucy bought 26 packets of pasta.
Response:  Firstly, Lucy bought 2 packages of Kurabiye and 12 packages of Pasta. So, she spent 56 Turkish Lira in total. To find out how many sets of purchases Lucy made, we can divide the amount she spent (in Turkish Lira) by the cost per set: Cost per set = Total amount spent / Number of sets purchased. In this case, the cost per set is: Cost per set = 56 Turkish Lira / 14 sets (since there are 14 sets of purchases). Therefore, Lucy made 14 sets of purchases.
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 people in the bus. When we get to the next stop, 4 more people boarded the bus, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. According to the problem statement, no more than 36 people can be accommodated in each bus, which means that the total number of people who can fit in all the buses is 36 x Number of buses = 36 x 5 = 180 people. Therefore, there are 180 - 16 = 164 people in the bus.
Response:  The first bus had 8 people. Then, 12 more people got on the bus in the next stop, so now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus. Finally, 3 people got off the bus, leaving 20 - 3 = 17 people inside the bus. Therefore, there are 17 people inside the bus at the moment.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 people in the bus and then 9 more people boarded the bus. So, the total number of people in the bus at any given time is equal to the initial number of people plus the number of new passengers who boarded the bus. Therefore, the answer is:  Total number of people in the bus = Initial number of people + Number of new passengers who boarded the bus. In this case, the initial number of people was 4, and 9 more people boarded the bus, so the total number of people in the bus at any given time is: Total number of people in the bus = 4 + 9 = 13.
Response:  At the beginning, there were 8 people in the training room. Then, 3 more people joined (8 + 3 = 11). Now, how many people are currently in the training room? Therefore, the answer is 11 - 3 = 8 people.
Response:  We know that there were 22 teachers and 676 students in total. So, we can find out how many students each teacher taught by dividing the number of students by the number of teachers. Therefore, each teacher taught an average of 31 students (676/22).
Response:  We know that there are 73 evetns and 724 students. So, we can calculate the number of teachers as follows: Number of teachers = Total number of people / Number of students x 100 (Since there were 744 teachers)  Therefore, the answer is 744.
Response:  We know that there were 174 teachers and 521 students in total. To find out how many more students than teachers, we need to subtract the number of teachers from the total number of students. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 521 - 174 = 347. Therefore, there are 347 more students than teachers in the program.
Response:  We know that there are 61 students in total and 177 students passed the examination. So, the number of students who did not pass the exam is: 177 - 61 = 116. Therefore, there were 116 students who did not pass the exam.
Response:  We know that the depth of the well is 919 feet and the distance traveled in the journey is 1307 miles. To find out how far away the well is from the starting point, we need to divide the distance traveled by the depth of the well. So, the calculation would be: Distance = Total distance traveled / Depth of the well = 1307 miles / 919 feet = approximately 1425 miles away from the starting point. Therefore, the well is approximately 1425 miles away from the starting point.
Response:  If they are traveling at a speed of 17 km/h and it takes them 849 hours to reach the cave entrance, then they will cover a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 17 km/h x 849 hours = 14361 km. Therefore, there is still a distance of 14361 km between the caves and their current location.
Response:  If they are at 659 feet and want to reach the bottom of the mine which is 762 feet deep, then they have to travel downward for 103 feet (762 - 659 = 103).
Response:  We know that there were initially 6 goldfish in the street. Then, Paige added 8 more goldfish to the street. So, the total number of goldfish in the street after Paige added them is: 6 + 8 = 14. Therefore, 14 - 6 = 8 goldfish kayboldu (or disappeared).
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 goldfish and 12 cats. So altogether we had 7 + 12 = 19 pets. Now, after some time, 15 of them have escaped or died. Therefore, the number of remaining pets is 19 - 15 = 4. So, the answer to your question is 4.
Response:  We know that Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 cats. If she gave them food, they would eat it. So, there are 98 animals in total (16 goldfish + 71 cats). Now, we subtract the two cats that disappeared, so we have 96 animals left (98 - 2 = 96). Therefore, 40 goldfish (96 / 2 = 40) went missing or died.
Response:  We know that Paige had 15 goldfish and she fed them to the street cats. If 5 of them died, then we have 10 fish left (15 - 5 = 10). So, there are 10 goldfish left.
Response:  We know that after pasta was cooked, there were initially 43 olives. Then, the chef used 2 olive halves to make a sauce. So, how many olives are left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of olives used from the initial total number of olives. Therefore, the answer is: 43 - 2 = 41 olives.
Response:  The chef has eaten 58 apples and then made 35 pies using some of those apples. So, how many apples did he use to make each pie? If he used x apples to make one pie, then he would have used 35/x apples in total to make all 35 pies. Now we need to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 35: x = 35 / (35 / x) = 35 / x^2. Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, the chef used 10 apples to make each pie. So, there are 350 apples left (35 x 10 = 350).
Response:  We know that there were initially 40 apples and 54 pears. After making some jam, 39 apples remained. So, we can say that x = 40 - 39 = 1 apple was used to make the jam. Therefore, 1 apple was used in total.
Response:  We know that there are 11 actions figures in each of Adam's rooms. So, if we have n rooms, then the total number of action figures is 11n. Since there are 4 rooms in Adam's house, the total number of action figures in his house is 4 x 11 = 44. Now, let's count how many action figures can fit in each room. There are 4 rafs and 40 dolaps in each room. Each raf can hold 3 action figures, so the total number of action figures in each raf is 3 x 4 = 12. Similarly, each dolap can hold 5 action figures, so the total number of action figures in each dolap is 5 x 40 = 200. Therefore, the total number of action figures in all the rooms is 44 + (12 x 4) = 86.
Response:  We know that there are 10 actions in each of Adam's breaths. So, if we multiply this number by the total number of breaths (which is given as 8), we get:  10 x 8 = 80 actions. Therefore, there were 80 actions in Adam's body.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 action figures and 10 balls in each room. So, in total, there are:

8 action figures x 4 rooms = 32 action figures
10 balls x 4 rooms = 40 balls

So, in total, there are 32 + 40 = 72 objects that can be carried from one room to another."
Response:  Bahçe (garden) has 10 sections. Each section has 544 pots. In each pot, there are 32 flowers. Therefore, we have: Number of flowers = Total number of pots x Number of flowers in each pot = 10 x 544 = 5440 flowers. So, there are 5440 flowers in total.
Response:  We have 466 tane (bags) of teneke (rice). Each bag contains 53 çiçek (stalks) and 181 çubuk (grains). So, in total, we have:  Number of stalks = 53 x 466 = 24,970 stalks Number of grains = 181 x 466 = 84,966 grains Therefore, there are 24,970 stalks and 84,966 grains in total.
Response:  We know that there are 141 tane (tents) in total. From one of the tents, we take out 71 flowers and put them into another tent. So, now we have 71 fewer flowers than before. Then, from the remaining tents, we take out 91 cups and put them into yet another tent. Therefore, the number of flowers left in each tent is equal to the original number minus the number of cups taken away. In other words, the number of flowers left in each tent is 71. Thus, the answer is 71 flowers.
Response:  We know that there are 40 flowers in total and each flower has 10 tentacles. So, we have: Total number of tentacles = Number of flowers x Number of tentacles per flower = 40 x 10 = 400 tentacles. Therefore, there are 400 tentacles in total.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4276 Silgis. If we divide each group into 154 subgroups, then the number of Skittles and Silgis in each subgroup will be equal. So, if we want to find out how many Skittles or Silgis are in each subgroup, we can use division. For example, if we have 4502 Skittles and we divide them equally among 154 subgroups, each subgroup will contain 30 Skittles (4502 / 154 = 30). Similarly, if we have 4276 Silgis and we divide them equally among 154 subgroups, each subgroup will contain 28 Silgis (4276 / 154 = 28). Therefore, the answer is 30 for Skittles and 28 for Silgis.
Response:  If there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4950 Silgis, then we can calculate the number of groups of Silgis as follows: Number of groups = Total number of Silgis / Size of each group = 4950 / 495 = 10 Since there are 10 groups of Silgis, each group contains 495 Silgis.
Response:  If we divide 896 into 8 groups of 112 each (round down), then each group will have 112 Skittles.  Since there are 517 silgis and 90 larger Skittles, the total number of Skittles in each group is: 112 + 517 = 639 Skittles per group.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we have: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in this school.
"Response:  If there are 304 students in total and each class has 75 students, then we have:
Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class
= 304 / 75
= 4
So, there are 4 classes in total."
