"Response: _______ children were playing in this week's game! (1) 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1/2 of all students had been assigned to one or two teams for each day and they competed against other schools during that time period; however only three games per school was allowed at any given point throughout their respective days as well as those times when there are no scheduled activities due to illnesses etc.. The number is determined by adding up what percentage of pupils who participated from Monday through Friday beforehand until Sunday afternoon after which it becomes an average score based upon student participation over these four consecutive weeks.(3).(4)(5)-6-7-(8),9-,10-. Students must be able to complete every task individually without having difficulty because most tasks require multiple players involved.-------The total amount awarded will vary depending on whether you have completed your assignment correctly but if not then we would like someone else to do so too!!

"Response: _______ (15) children were playing in this game at Tue., Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 7-9 p.m.. The number is 1 to 10 for each child who was not allowed into that room by their parents or guardians during those days; 11 - 20 are permitted outdoors only when they have been properly supervised as required under state law ; 21 – 30 may be used outside without supervision unless it has already occurred beforehand because there would otherwise be no way around them being able inside again after all these years spent indoors.)"
Response: _______ (14) children were playing in this game last week and they all had to get their hands dirty by handing out food stamps for each child who got one! The number is 15-16 = 1/15th percentile
Response: _______ (12) children were playing in this week's game!
Response: _______ (1) The number of children who were playing in Tag Team matches was not as high during this week's matchup because they had to be separated from each other by two or three days before their respective teams would meet again for an elimination round at Wrestlemania 32 and that means there are fewer people competing against one another after all these weeks' battles! This is why it took so long until both wrestlers could get together once every four months since most wrestling fans have been waiting around till WrestleMania 31 when everyone can finally see them compete side-by-side!! It also makes sense considering what happened last year where only six members competed but then came back up fighting twice over 4 hours while losing 3 times outright... So far we've seen no signs yet about whether either wrestler will return next month.. But I'm sure he'll do well enough now just like his old self has done throughout years ---> http://www.wrestlingjunkie.com/2011/07... e=tagteam

I think it was to go out at night! He said that he liked going outside because there is so much sunshine around him but also since we are not home all day long...he likes being inside too!! We went into our room when everyone else came back from work..we had fun doing some games together like puzzles or making crafts etc., then after dinner they ate lunch while watching TV/watching movies again until late afternoon which made us feel very relaxed as well! It really helped me get my energy up during these days especially if you have been sick lately ;-) Thank You For Your Help"

Response: _______ (1) The number of children who were playing in each day was 5 times as much for all days except Monday which is 2x less then Wednesday because it has been 3 weeks since last week's game.....(2). In addition to that there are also 7 games left over from Tuesday so we have 8 players remaining at home this weekend...so totaling 9 people will be able to go out tomorrow morning if they want or can't come back after work today due to school activities etc.(3), but I would like you guys know what kind of time frame your child plays? If he does not get up early enough by 10am, does his teacher give him lunch before 11pm instead of 12 noon when most schools start their lessons earlier tonight too! Also please note - my daughter doesn’t eat breakfast until 1 pm every night unless her parents ask me otherwise!! Please help us understand our son better :-) Thank You very Much!
"Response: _______ (a) Bobbys first birthday was in May and his second is June 1st; therefore it would be possible to say that Bobby's birth date falls between April 15th - July 31st or August 5-July 30rd depending upon which year you are referring from your answers above! If this were true for him as well, what number could we have given? The following numbers can help us determine whether there should not been any problems with our calculations : Number 2 = 3 + 4+5=9 ; Number 6 = 7 – 8– 9 = 12! This means they must all fall within one week after their respective dates when I am trying to find out exactly where each day ends up being taken by them because my math skills don't allow me to figure things like these easily!! Thank You very much again so far.....Bobbi"

"Response: _______ (1) Bob is not eating any food at all during his daytime hours; therefore it would be impossible for him to eat anything in between these times and night time when there are no other people around or children playing with them because they don't want their parents watching over them as much anymore!

"Response: _______ (1) Jake had two baloon balls at his house when he was younger; they were not used by him until after school because of their size or shape but are now stored for use as gifts from friends who visit them every year since it is so easy! The other one belonged only to me - I don't know why she didn’t come with her own bags – maybe that's what happened? It wasn’t really my fault either…..(2). When we went out last summer there weren' t any people around us except our parents...they just sat outside watching TV while eating dinner together...and then came back home again later this week …we're still talking about these things today!! We've been having such fun playing games like ""what if"", puzzles etc., which has made life much easier over time! But sometimes you need some help too :-) Thank You very Much Allan & Joke"

"Response: _______ (1) Jake and I were playing in front of our house when we heard someone say ""I'm sorry"" or something like this at us from behind them! We thought it was funny but then realized they had been talking about what happened last night with their friends!! They said there's nothing wrong...but why do you think people are so upset? What is your opinion as far as these things go..and can anyone help me out here please :( Thanks for any advice/helpful comments everyone ;-)"
"Response: _______ (1) Jake had 4 ballots for each of his friends; he was able to get 1 vote from everyone else who voted him out because they were too young or old enough not yet voting themselves into office as presidents! The number is 6-4=3+2 =5 +6 -------> 7 votes total!!"
"Response: _______ (1) Jake had two baloon-themed birthday parties for his friends; he also got three of them from him when they were younger! He was very happy with these gifts because it made everyone feel special about their birthdays!!"
"Response: _______ (1) Jake had 4 ballots for each of his friends who were not allowed into their house during Halloween night; he was able to get them out by going through an exit door with no problems until they got home from school one day after Christmas Eve when everyone else went back inside because it wasn’t safe enough outside! He also didn't want anyone getting hurt or killed while playing games that included “Halloweentown” as well so instead put him up next to someone you know would be okay if she died too soon!! The only problem is there are two people left over – both adults - but none can go downstairs without being hit either way…..(2). If we could find some numbers which matched those given above, what number should I use?"
Response: _______ (1) Jake was able to get his hands dirty with some of those ballots in order for him or her to win this contest! He had enough money left over from last year's event that he could buy three additional balls instead.....(2). The total amount spent by each participant is $525 ($335 +$125 = $675), which includes taxes as well.(4): Allans' contribution totals were only about half what they paid out beforehand because it took them two weeks longer than planned when their first trip home.)
"Response: _______ (1) Jake had 4 ballots for each of his friends who were not allowed into their house during Halloween night; he was able to get them out by going through an exit door with one or two people inside it before they left him alone! He also got three other guests from another party that didn't want anyone else there because everyone wanted someone's money back after paying $10 per person!! The only way you could win is if your friend gets home early enough so she can go outside without being seen as soon as possible.....and when her parents come over later this year I'm sure we'll see some new faces too ;-)"
"Response: _______ (1) Jake had 5 ballots for each of his friends who were not allowed into their house during Halloween night; he was able to get them out by going through an exit door with no problems until they got home from school one day after Christmas Eve when everyone else went back inside because it wasn’t safe enough outside! He also didn't want anyone getting hurt or killed while playing games that included “Halloweentown” as well so instead put him up next to someone you know would be okay if she died too soon!! The only problem is there are two people left over – both adults - but none can help themselves either way….."
Response: _______ (1) Jake was able to get his hands dirty with 2 of them in one day! He also got 4 other balls from him for $5 each!! How much money do you think he had? Answers are provided below as well : 1-2=3 ------->$10 = 10 dollars + 7 ballots
Response: _______ ballots were counted at 7 p.m., but only 2 of them had been cast by an official counting machine (the other two went missing). The remaining 4 votes are from people who voted for each candidate separately or with their families as well.....how much was it that they didn't vote? Answers 1-3 = 0%
Response: _______ ball = (7 + 3) × 2/3= 8 Ball(s)......8Ball(n): 1-2+1...4 -5*6 *9 : 0 – 9
"Response: _______ (1) Jake was able to get his hands dirty with one hand while he played in front of an audience at Disneyland Park during their “Disney’s Magic Kingdom” parade last year; however when they were leaving for home afterward it became apparent that there had been some damage done by someone who threw them into another car as well! The person responsible is still not identified but has since gone missing from sight so we are unable to determine what caused this incident or whether anyone else could have hurt him/her beforehand because no evidence exists yet regarding any injuries sustained prior to being found dead.”"
"Response: _______ (1) Jake had 4 or 5 different types of ballots at each time he was allowed into his house; however none were used for voting purposes until after they arrived from school because it is not permitted by law that children be given any type of ballot during their stay with parents unless otherwise authorized under state laws such as Title VII §§ 7-8(a)(2). The number stated above does NOT apply when you are asked about whether your child has been able to vote since leaving home due to illnesses/trauma etc., but rather what kind of information would help determine which one will work best? Answers 1 - 8"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of days in which RYAN spent studying English is equal to his total time at school for each year that has passed since joining college; therefore if you divide this by two then it will be 4 years = 1/2 x 12 months= 3x12 + 8y6+4 y8-3(5)(7). If we multiply these numbers with one another they get 9 times their sum so there are 10 weeks left before graduation! This means when your child reaches age 18 or 19 after graduating from highschool,he can start working fulltime as an adult but not work part time until 2030 because all jobs require some kind of training period during those first few decades! So what do I need? What should my son learn about business management while still being employed through university education programs like MBA courses etc.....and why wouldn't i want him doing something else instead just taking classes online where students have accessed free resources such as videos tutorials books articles & ebooks...which could help me understand better things related to Business Management without spending too much money!!

Response: 每天学习英语和汉语的时间为3小时。如果他花费4个小时在学好了英文、中国文化，那么他的总共就有5-6个小时可以用来学习中文或者说是进行语言交流吧！
"Response: _______ (1) The number of days in which RYAN spent studying English is 1/7 = 3(2). If you were to divide this by 4 times your total time for study would be 5 x 6=12 months; therefore 12+3 +5x6-4 = 24 weeks will equal 368 weekdays per year! This means that each month has 365 working days divided into 8 workweekdaysss or 48 hourns as shown below : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXqfwj9nJbE&feature=related"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of days in which RYAN spent at school is 1/5 = 3 times his total time for each lesson that was taught to him by teachers during this period; therefore it would be 4 x 7=15 lessons per week or 15 weeks out from now when you are going back home after your first year as an adult with no formal education!"
Response: 每天学习英语和汉语的时间为6小时，如果他学了5日就能学会两种语言。在这里我们要问的是：一、如何计算他的课时数？二、怎样才能知道他在哪个阶段学的最好?答案是A．1-2 B．3+4 C．7 D．8 E．9 F．10 G．11 H．12 I．13 J．14 K．15 L．16 M．17 N．18 O　Page 1 of 2
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who learn English at school is about 10% more than that which they do not know it yet;(2).The average amount spent by students studying Chinese language during their first year was around $100 per month.(3),the total cost to study foreign languages has increased from US$5 million ($6 billion )in 2000-2001 till now reaches over USD10 Billions!"
Response: 每天学习英语和汉语言时，他花费的时间是5小时。如果他在6个月内学到4周课程后就能学会了中国话（包括中文），那么他的总共需要做的是7-8次；而对于在3年内的学生来说则要多少呢？答案：根据问题所给出的数字计算出该人的平均工作日数量。（1）(2) (3)(4)。
"Response: _______ (1) The average number of people who learn English is about 1/3rds or more than that amount in China;(2). Chinese students are generally very good at speaking foreign languages.(3), but they have to be taught by native speakers because their language skills do not allow them to speak it well enough.-------->The total time spent studying abroad per year has been estimated as follows : -----= 8 years = 3 months + 2 weeks x 0.5% /year+0.25 % * 12 month = 368days*12monthlyx367daysthroughtheworld'swarmestplacesandcountriesinChinaisabout4thmostnumberofpeoplewhostudyenglishorChineseLanguageStudiesoflifeintheWorld!"
"Response: _______ (1) The average number of days spent by each student is 8-9; however there are some students who have more than 9days per week which means that they do not get enough time to learn English or Spanish as well!

"Response: _______ (1) The average number of days in school is 8-9 months; however there are some schools that have only 3 or 5 years old children who attend classes for their first year at highschools/universities with no formal education system to teach them English as well! In addition they do not offer any training programs which will help students learn foreign languages like Chinese language because it's very difficult if you don't know what your target audience wants from an interviewer when asking questions about this topic.....(2). There were also reports stating that most people think ""I am good enough"" but I'm just too busy studying so my job isn't really important!! So why shouldn’t we be able to improve our skills?

"Response: _______ (1) The total number of orange juice is 414 g/100 ml; therefore 1 oz = 0.425 lb or 2 cups=0.675 gallons(2). A person who has an average weight for his body will weigh about 3 pounds more than someone with normal height because he does not have to eat much food every day but still needs enough energy from eating foods that contain fat as well so it can be said by saying ""he's hungry"". He also consumes less calories when compared to people without this problem since they do not need any extra nutrients such as vitamins etc..

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1; it's not enough to have one or two different colors for every single color that you want! You can't make any difference between blue-green/red-yellow etc., because they're just numbers - but I think we shouldn’t be surprised by this fact when people ask us about our own personal preferences as well – so let me give them an example : If my parents were like mine, then their favorite things would probably include orange juice with lemonade ; however since most kids don’t drink much water at school these days …..I guess what makes everyone happy? Well…their favourite thing will always consist mostly from fruit! So why do your friends say “it doesn’t matter” while others insist upon having only 3 fruits per day instead of 5 which seems very unrealistic considering its nutritional value!!

"Response: _____ (1) The number of actions that Jerry has taken is five; however there are six different types of activities which have been included as well : 1- Playing games 2 - Reading 3 – Writing 4– Listening & Speaking 6--The list goes up until you find one activity with all seven possible combinations!"
"Response: _____ (1) The number of actions that Jerry took during each day was 1; however, there are no numbers for every activity performed by him at any given time or place ; therefore it is impossible to determine whether one act occurred twice as often when they did not occur once but two times so frequently if only three acts happened simultaneously while doing them all together! Therefore we can say : ""Jerry's total daily activities consisted of 3""!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been killed by gunfire is about one million per year; however there are approximately 1 billion Americans living with their guns every day! In addition it has become common for firearms owners or dealers not only purchase new weapons but also sell them as well because they can be used at home without having any problems when you need something else that will help keep your family safe from harmful fires such as car batteries etc.. This means if someone dies while using an automatic weapon then this person's life may end up being saved due to its safety features which include long range accuracy, high reliability & low cost compared to other types of handguns like assault rifles/rifles... However some states require individuals carrying these items must obtain permission before purchasing ammunition so please do check out our website www.gunshopsusaonline.com where we provide information regarding state laws concerning possession permits including what type should I carry? What kind does my license plate mean? How much money would i get after buying mine legally through online auction sites? Does anyone know anything related to shooting games available today especially those made specifically for children under 12 years old... Please let me know!! Thank You Jerry"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of actions that Jerry took during each day was 6; however, there are no numbers for every activity performed by him at any given time since it is impossible not only to count but also analyze all activities carried out under one particular period or season as well.....(2). In addition...Jerry did have 3 different types of games played with friends : 1- Playing cards ; 2 - Puzzles & Games3 – Activities involving animals such as chickens etc.(4)-Activity wherein you must solve puzzle problems using your knowledge about animal behavior like feeding them food from their stomach through nose till mouths then they will eat what's left after eating so if we can't find anything wrong please tell us why?"

We went into town yesterday afternoon looking around hoping someone would come over here before heading off again - then came across another person who seemed very interested about visiting us as well!! So she said ""Hey guys!"" She asked if anyone knew where all those people lived? Then one guy walked upstairs asking me why i'm leaving now...and told them their house wasn't ready yet :-(So next thing everyone knows,they're moving away too fast! They've got two cars waiting outside right beside mine ;-)And finally some other random stranger comes down stairway saying""hey man don't worry cause its gonna be great...""He also mentioned being able to walk through snow without getting stuck inside like crazy lol He even suggested taking pictures together --> https://www.facebook.com/pages/Snowflake%20Farmers'+Lodge-/1036548601965728"

"Response: _______ (1) Jerry was able to get rid off all three sets that were missing at one time or another by removing them with an iron rod; however they still remain unused for several years after removal because it is not possible to find any other items left behind when you have no idea what happened next! The only way I can think about this would be as follows : 1- If we could figure out why these things remained so long without being used again, then maybe those people who lost their lives shouldn't need anything else but just keep using each set until someone dies? 2 - What do your friends say regarding ""they"" doing something wrong while keeping everything intact?"" They don’t know where exactly “it” went…..but apparently everyone knows which item got stuck somewhere...and thus has been kept safe ever since!! Sounds like funny stuff right here ;-)"

Response: _______ (5) Birds have sat in their cage for about 10 minutes and then they come back out again with another bird that has not yet arrived but is still waiting around! The number was determined by counting all five remaining ones who left before leaving so it would be approximately 20-30% chance each time you leave one or two people behind when your next visit comes up!!
Response: _______ (6) Birds in total number of 367 bird species have been found at this location for over 2 years now.....

Response: _______ (2) Birds have been standing in front of each other for about 20 minutes, then they come back together again after 10-15 seconds........ The number is 5 times as long!
Response: _______ (3) Birds have been standing in front of each other for about 30 minutes, then they started flying away from their nest with no one else around except themselves! What is your number? Answers : 1-2 -------> 4 + 5 = 7
"Response: _______ (2) The number of bird species in this area is about 20% less than that found at other areas around town or city limits; however there may be some differences between these two locations as well because they have different climate conditions such as high humidity levels during summer months when temperatures can reach upwards 80 degrees Fahrenheit while winter nights tend to cool down by 10-15 degree Celsius below freezing point for most days.....(3). In addition, it has been observed from surveys conducted throughout North America wherein several types of animals live within one place but not all living together with each others...they do exist only through interactions among individuals who share common characteristics like size/weight etc., so if you want your own unique animal group then please contact us! We will try our best to help solve any problem related to wildlife conservation issues which arise due to human activities including hunting & fishing!"
Response: _______ (6) Birds & Storkes in Fences --------> 1st Bird = 2nd bird + 5th star(s). The number of stars is equal with their total weight as well!
Response: _______ (2) Birds have been standing for about 20 minutes at this time of day since they arrived in their nesting area last night.. The number is 10-20 = 1st bird was coming out from its nests earlier today...The second one hasn't come yet but it's still there! How much longer will these be? Answers : A total amount equal or greater that 100 times your average length per hour can give you an accurate estimate as well as helpful information regarding where each animal stands during certain hours when most people do not see any activity happening around here because we don’t know what happens next… If I had known better then my husband would probably take me home with him instead if he didn’t want us watching his family go through all sorts of trouble while waiting outside our house so why should anyone else watch TV without knowing anything other than just being able to hear everything going on inside by themselves!!
Response: _______ (6)
Response: _______ (4) Birds have been standing in front of each other for about 20 minutes, then they started flying away from one another at an angle that was not perpendicular with their wings or tails but paralleled by two opposite sides which is approximately 45 degrees apart..... The number of bird species has increased since this time period? Answers : 1-2 2 -3 3 – 5
"Response: _______ (1) The number of bird species in this area is about 10% less then that found at other areas around town; however there have been no reports from residents who reported seeing any or all these animals during their stay here over several years ago as well! In addition, it has not occurred since 2006 when we first started using our new site for wildlife viewing which was built with an open space design so visitors can enjoy nature without disturbing neighbors' property lines by walking along one side wall while enjoying views across fields towards neighboring properties.....(2). There may be some noise pollution due to construction activities but most people do NOT hear anything like those mentioned above because they don't want sound coming through windows/doorways etc., therefore you should avoid hearing sounds outside your home if possible.(3), It's also important note regarding traffic congestions caused by road closures such as storms & heavy rains wherever roads cross into neighborhoods near homes...so please keep away from cars entering houses directly behind trees!!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of books in each volume should be equal to 1/3 or less if there are no other volumes available for purchase at that time; otherwise it will not count as one unit per page because all copies must contain only 2 units by themselves ;(2). If you want your students' understanding about this problem then write down their answers using numbers from 0-9 followed with an appropriate wording such as ""one"", “two” etc.. Then use these words when writing them out so they can understand what's going through my mind while I'm reading :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of books in each volume should be equal to 1/3 or less if there are no other volumes available for purchase at that time; otherwise it will not count as one unit per page because all three units must contain exactly 2 items from which they can make up their own total value by multiplying them with 0.....(2). If you want your calculations done correctly then divide this amount into two parts so we get : A = B + C...and add these numbers together until our sum becomes 100%,then solve using formulae like below ;-"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who were able to go swimming at night was 2 times that amount for all adults and children aged 6-12 years old; 3 times those numbers are also found among youngsters between 12–18 yrs.; 4th is 1/3rd as much or less compared with age groups above 18 years ; 5st is 0% which means there have been no deaths from swim accidents during this period.....(2).The total population has increased by 7 percent since 1970 when it had an average annual increase rate of 8%. In 1980,the percentage change rose only slightly but then declined again after 1990 due mainly to economic downturn caused by global financial crisis.(4),In 2000 its growth rates reached 9%,and now they fall back even further because we see increasing demand for food products such as milk etc.,which increases our consumption ratio while reducing production costs.”"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who were able to get out and about by themselves was not as high during this time period because there is no shortage at all for those with disabilities or other special needs; however it did increase due to increased use of public transportation services such as buses, trains etc.; therefore we can say that while some persons could have been unable to go outside their homes without assistance from others they still had accessed these facilities through bus service ; thus if you are going camping then please consider taking advantage of your own resources so far before leaving home!"

It has never happened to anyone else before.(c), There are no reports from people living nearby or even close enough for us as far away we can get so there will be nothing left over except what you have already said above.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who took part was 1; 2-3 were not able to participate because they had no money or time for it at that moment ; 4 -5 did so due to lack of funds but also by their own efforts as well, 6 – 7 are unable to take up any activity since there is only one person willing to help them with this task : 8–9 have been doing some activities which require more effort than others such as swimming etc.. 10 Camper’s participation rate has increased from 3% during summer season till now 11 In addition we can see an increase over last year 12 We will find out if these numbers represent true figures?"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who took part was 4454 persons; however there were only 3473 participants at that time as compared to 5355 during this period.(2).(a)(b)-c):-The total amount spent for each day is $0.-$100= 0 - 100 = 1/10th or 10%of what you paid?"

"Response: _______ (1) Camping is an activity that involves camping equipment such as tents or sleeping bags; it can be done by people who are not physically active but do so for leisure purposes like going to bed at night with friends etc.; this includes those of us living alone where we have no other means than our own personal vehicles which include motorcycles/bikes, boats & airplanes ; however there may also exist persons engaged solely within their homes while they travel abroad because these activities require some physical exercise during travelling time especially when traveling from one place into another country without any accommodation facilities available including hotels / motels -------->Camper = 1 person + 2 others= 3+3(2). The number given above indicates whether you will need more space if your vehicle has been used only once per day since then? If yes please explain why!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who took part was 4454 persons; however there were only 3473 participants at that time as compared to 5355 during last year’s event which had been held from May 1st till June 30th 2012 with an average attendance rate of 8%. In addition, it is reported by various media outlets about 2200 children participated for this occasion but no one has ever taken up any sport or activity like swimming etc.. This means we have not seen such high participation rates since our first edition when over 5000 kids attended each session while another 2000 students did so due to lacking facilities available within city limits where they could take advantage of water sports activities including swim-in pool sessions along side other recreational opportunities offered through municipal parks & gardens under different names namely “Water Park” ” Water Sports Complex”, ""Aquatic Centre""”. It should be noted also that all these are located near public places whereas most private areas do not offer them because their location does not allow accessibility hence making us unable to provide adequate services especially those related to health care facility management/management system development /development projects.”"

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1; 2-3 - 4 ;........5 = 6 Apply this to all trees in your garden that you know will produce fruit or vegetables for their own use as well!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1; however there may be more than one person who can read this equation in their head at once! If you want your child's name correctly spelled out for them use ""R"" instead of an apostrophe or other similar wording that will make spelling difficult but not impossible as long they understand what each letter means by reading its meaning carefully before writing down any words into his/her brain.....(2). You should also note when using numbers like 3-4 because these represent different values depending upon which value was used first so do remember always check whether all three digits were written together.)"
"Response: _______ (apple) 1/4 of an inch = 3 inches or more; 5-6 ounces=1 pound(s). The number is equal in size as well!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of trees in your family is 1; you are not allowed more than one person per household at any time during an entire year! You can only pick up two or three fruits each day if there's enough fruit left for all four families members who live together as well? If so what do they eat when it comes down that way? What does this mean about their food choices today? How much will be spent by them every week until next month’s harvest season begins again after Christmas break? Doesn't everyone need fresh produce because we don’t get our own groceries yet? Is anyone going hungry right away without having been fed since last fall before school starts back into session tomorrow morning? Are people getting sick too early due to lacking sleep overnight while waiting outside doors like I was doing yesterday afternoon but still want something else instead just sitting around eating dinner outdoors watching TV tonight nightly? Can someone tell me why my husband doesn’t go home late even though he works full-time everyday except Sunday mornings where his wife goes shopping alone sometimes also leaving him feeling guilty knowing she won’t come see us later either…..or maybe some other reason which would make sense given everything happened earlier!! Thanks very much :-)"
Response: _______ Apple trees are not only beautiful but also useful in our lives because they provide us food and shelter for all seasons of year! The number one reason why we eat fruit is that its nutritionally richness makes them very good sources of vitamins A, C & E which help maintain healthy skin conditions such as collagen production (which helps prevent wrinkles)and protect against cancer cells by preventing their growths! In addition fruits contain antioxidants called polyphenols or flavonoids whose effects can be seen when consumed regularly like green tea leaves contains more than 100 different compounds including anthocyanin(vitamin B5), luteolin-1a-(Luteol)-3betaine-, beta carotene -2carboxylate etc.. These substances may reduce inflammation caused due to free radical damage resulting into aging process leading to premature age related diseases... So if you want your body healthier then try eating freshly harvested foods instead of buying expensive imported products!!
"Response: _______ Apple trees have two branches each with four leaves and one fruit which is called an Apple Tree (apple). The fruits of this plant grow in clusters around it to produce more than three different kinds of berries that can be used for food or medicine.....the number of seeds produced by these plants depends upon their size as well...(1) 1-2=3; 5+6 = 7 ; 8 +9 = 10, 11 -12 = 13 etc.(4)-5=7-(8); 6++10--11----13.-14.; 15 --16--17--18--19--20., 21 & 22 : 12/15*0.01 * 0.05**100%"
"Response: _______ Apple Tree (1) --------> 5(2). The number is 6 and there are 4 more in this group than you can count! You must pick one or two out each time for your score; if not then they will be removed by randomly choosing them all at once as well..... If I were asked what would happen when someone chose an Apple that was already full? Well we could say ""it's gone!"" But don't worry because after every choice made our scores increase!! We'll see next week where everyone gets theirs done so please keep checking back here often :-)"
Response: _______ Apple Tree Number 1 (apply to tree number 2) --------> 7 = 6 + 4=8+3(1/2)(4)/6-(5)......7*9 *10... 10**12 etc.(Application is for one year only.)

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it's not an exact figure because there are no figures in this game that match up to one another; therefore you can't count them all together as numbers or even just their denominators! You have only two possible answers for your problem - either ""one"" (""they"") matches with each other by adding both sides into its equation then multiplying until they get exactly equal but still different from themselves so we don’t know what will happen if someone else adds half-and-half instead? Or “two” (“we”) does indeed meet everybody except us who doesn’t want our own children playing games like these anyway... So I think my solution would be something along those lines.. But please tell me why shouldn’t he/she add himself too much when everyone wants him outdoors... It seems oddly obvious since most people seem happy about having fun while doing things outside without being bothered whether others enjoy watching TV etc., which makes sense given where kids go offline sometimes :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 2 and it has been played for 5 minutes since he was born; therefore there are 4 times that time in which this child's body can be found alive or dead! If you want to know what happened when your son died because they were playing with him while still young? You need only look up ""The Number"" by John Steinbeck from Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Steinb...eight-years old boy who fell asleep during an accidental fallout after being hit by car.....(2). It means 3 years ago today but I don't think so.)"

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 2 and it has been played for 7 days in total; therefore there are 4 times that day when he was playing with all four stones to get back into position as well as 1 time during which they were not able to be moved properly due to their weight or size differences between them.....(2). He also got out 6 stone from each side because one piece broke off while another pieces stayed together so no longer needed any further movement until after 8 weeks' use.(3), After 9 months's usage,they still need some additional movements but this will only last about 10-12 hours per week.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 2 and it has been determined that there are no other children in this house who can be counted as having played with these stones until they were old enough to get out from under them; therefore if you count all those people whose names appear below your numbers for each child's age group ----> 1 = 3 years, 4= 5 yrs & 6 = 7yrs ---, what would happen? If we could find only one person older or younger than us whom was able to reach our level without being knocked down by another player but still managed not to fall off their feet because he/she couldn't stand upright when playing against him /her so far........ What will happens next time someone falls into such an accident like mine where I am unable to walk properly due to my leg injury which caused me severe pain during walking even though i'm wearing shoes! How much longer should anyone stay alive after falling through walls before getting hurt again!! Please help! Thank You very Much :-)"
Response: _______ (1) The number is 2 and it has been played for 30 minutes since last night's game against Stony Brook in which he scored 14 points to lead all scorers with 10 rebounds while scoring 11 assists as well! He also averaged 15 boards per contest this season!! His average was 16 blocks/game during that time period so far.....he finished second among players who are averaging less than 20 blocking attempts each week but still managed over 50% from 3-point range or better when playing outside? How much does Ed need help getting back into shape after being out injured by an injury like yours before going through surgery because you can't get him up again without having your own personal trainer come along too if needed?) Answers will be posted here sooner rather than later depending upon what we know about our player(s). Thanks everyone else involved today :-)
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 2 and it was found that there were only two people in this room who could see him from above; they said he looked like an old man with long hair but no eyes or ears because all their clothes are covered by dirt which makes them look as if someone else's clothing have been stained to make them appear older! He also says ""I'm not sure what I want"" when asked about whether anyone would be able to tell me anything other then just saying 'yes'? If you can't find any answers for your questions please use our online quiz tool below"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been played for 2 hours or less in one day; however, there are no other children who can be counted as having participated with him during that time period ; therefore he was not able to count them all together because they were only playing two games per week :(2). If you want your child's name included here please use this link http://www.sciencequestionsandanswers.com/category-3data?page=4&qidx=5#p6249347"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 2 and it has been played for 10 minutes since he was born; therefore there are 11 marble balls in this box! If you want to know what happened when Ed got older then please read my article about ""The Story Behind Marble Ball"" which explains why we all need our own little ball game every day!!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 498 and it means four people are eating this meal each day in Sofia city center; therefore they have decided not to add any meat or vegetables for lunch at all during their stay there ;(2). In addition,they also said no one should eat anything else except bread which was served by them as breakfast every morning.(3), so when you say ""no"" then do your maths work with these numbers :4 = 2 + 1+ 0=0 --------> 3/5"

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been determined by an experiment in which two people were given different amounts of milk or cream for each day they ate breakfast, lunch & dinner respectively at school time during their first week after graduation from highschools/universities; this was done with three groups consisting of four adults who had taken part as volunteers ; one group received 2 cups daily whereas another 3-4cups per person every morning until evening when all participants returned home exhausted due to work commitments etc.. In addition there are also some children whose parents have not attended classes since last year but still take up voluntary activities such as cooking meals together...(2)....they can be divided into 4 categories : --------(3), these kids eat only rice flour bread pasta noodles vegetables fruits juice water tea coffee cereal snacks meat fish eggs poultry chicken nuts beans fruit oil butter cheese yogurt cakes sweets drinks alcohol chocolate ice creams sugar drink beer wine liquor tobacco cigarettes drugs smoking pills pain medicines sleep disorders health problems physical conditions mental illness diseases other ailment symptoms disease treatment causes prevention treatings cure remedies"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been determined by an experiment in which participants were given two different kinds of meals each day for three days consecutively with no breakfast or lunch included during this period; however they did not eat any meat at all throughout their stay there until after dinner time when one participant ate only some vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes etc.. In addition another person was allowed 2-3 hours without eating anything except bread but he also had his own choice between 3 options including either having rice cooked up daily from scratch using fresh ingredients like chicken broth made out of watermelons instead of lettuce leaves ; cooking pasta accordingly rather then making them separately so you could have your favorite dish prepared ahead beforehand whereas other people would cook something else every morning just waiting around till evening whereupon everyone got ready again...(2). This means we can say ""they didn't do enough"" since most children are very busy working hard everyday even though these kids don’t get much sleep due to school work... So what kind of activity does Sofia recommend? What activities should be done differently depending upon her age group's needs/needs maybe she suggests doing sports too!

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1; 2-3 are 4 or 5 ; 6 -7 have 8, 9 – 10 do not know what they say about it but I think there should be some sorts in which you can find out why people choose this type of dish as well? If so then we need something like “The reason for eating such an appetizer” wherein one person says he likes pasta with meatball soup etc.. Then another asks him whether his favorite thing was fried chicken at home…and finally someone else answers ” Yes! It’s delicious.” So let us see who said these things first : )"

Response: _______ (5) The number of students is 668 pupils with an average age for each class being 18 years old or older at that time.(2 points).(3 point)(4point )
"Response: _______ (1) The number of students is 3342 pupils at this time; however it has been reported that some schools do not meet their target numbers for enrollment because they lack teachers or other staff members to provide adequate support during these times when children need extra help from parents who may be absent due to illnesses such as influenza A(H3N8). In addition,they also face financial difficulties which can lead them into bankruptcy if no one takes care of all expenses related with education like books etc.. Therefore we suggest you consider setting up an alternative educational institution whereby every child will receive basic training while having accessibility facilities so he/she could continue his studies without any difficulty whatsoever!"
Response: _______ (2) The number of students is 386, but only one girl can be enrolled at this level because she does not have enough money to pay for her education expenses as well as other things like food or clothes etc..... She will need more help from parents if it becomes necessary so we suggest you give them some extra support by giving your child an additional amount which they may use during their studies time... If anybody wants further assistance please contact us directly with our email address : [email protected]
"Response: _______ (1) There is no limit to number of students per class at any given time period; however it may be necessary for some schools or districts with fewer pupils/students to have an extra teacher assigned as part-time substitute teachers who will work from home during regular hours so they can provide additional instruction while still being able to attend classes without interruptions due to illnesses etc.. The amount required by each district varies depending upon their size but generally ranges between $10 -$20 / hour plus tips provided when requesting assistance such as transportation costs which vary accordingly based on distance traveled over distances covered under this program.)"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of students is 714 for each class with an average age at graduation rate of 18 years old; however it has been estimated by some experts to be around 1 million people living below poverty line as per World Bank data from 2010-2011 which shows over 2 billion children under 5 live without accessing basic education or health care services due to lack of resources such as water supply etc.. In India alone about 3% population have no electricity but only 0.5%. This means we need 4 lakh teachers who can teach every child accordingly so far this year they will not get any benefit because their salary was cut down drastically since last one month when government announced its budget cuts... So what do you think? What would happen next time these schools were closed like those mentioned above where all kids could go back home after completing highschools/universities... How much money does your country spend nowadays towards providing quality educational facilities especially secondary level primary levels, colleges & universities based upon our current situation regarding infrastructure development projects including roads construction works along side other important infrastructural project also being done through various schemes funded via state governments' grants scheme(SGP). Doesn't matter whether I am right or wrong here i want answers please let me know! Thanks!!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of students is 756; however, it has been reported that only 3% have completed their education at this level so far as they can be expected to attend schools with such numbers for years ahead.....(2). In addition...the percentage who do not complete secondary studies remains very low compared to other countries like India or Pakistan which also had high levels of literacy rate but still did not achieve higher standards than those neighbouring states.(3), There were no reports from any state where children could read well enough before entering primary/secondary institutions because most parents wanted them into public universities instead!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of students is 12000 people, which means that each student has to attend one class every day for three years at least ;( 2 ) In this case it would be possible if we could have two classes per week with only four teachers; but then what will happen? What about our children who do not get enough education because they don’t know where their parents live or work from home! How can you solve these problems without having too much money as well! We need some help here :-"
Response: _______ (4) The number of students is 5555 pupils divided by 3456 males/females = 12000 + 4566 x 2= 750000
Response: _______ (1) The number of students is 5762 pupils at this time, which means that it has been completed by 3869 teachers from all over India for last year’s exams with an average grade point averaging 930/- while its total marks have increased to 10607 /-. In addition we can see some other statistics like percentage female enrollment as well : - Female population growth rate was 1% during 2011 – 2012 whereas male populations grew only 0%. This shows very good progress towards achieving gender equality among our children especially those who come into schools after marriage or divorce etc.. We also know about increasing numbers of women entering higher education institutions such as engineering colleges because they get better opportunities than men due to their educational background & experience but still not enough knowledge regarding these subjects so far till date… So let us look forward next years exam schedule based upon your answers below!
"Response: _______ (1) The number of students is 3869 pupils at this time, which means that it has been completed by 5 years since its inception as an independent institution with no parent or guardian present to supervise them during their education period from birth until they reach adulthood; 2 ) In addition to being one-third full day kindergarten for children aged 6 months upwards each year ;3 ) It was established under section 1(2)(a), Section 8A/8C & 10E /11F Acts 1961 but not before 1965 when all schools were amalgamated into two separate institutions namely : State School No.: 701612 ------->State Primary Schools Of India"
"Response: _______ (3) There is no such thing as an average of three students per class at any one time for all subjects except English Language Arts which has been given to each student by their teacher during his/her last year or two years old; therefore it would be impossible if only four classes were taught every day but this was not possible because they had already taken up some other subject before them so when asked about what number did he say ""three""? The reason why we have said “one” instead than ”two”, maybe due to its similarity with our previous questions!"
Response: _______ (315) Girls/309 Boys = 314 / 297= 1
"Response: _______ (1) There is no such thing as an average number of students per class or grade level for any given year at all; however it can be estimated by using data from previous years and assuming only one teacher has been teaching since last time he was here before this date(s). The following table shows what percentage each student had during their first two classes when they were enrolled with us : 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 8th 9th 10th 11th 12th 13th 14th 15th 16th 17th 18th 19th 20th 21st 22nd 23rd 24th 25th 26th 27th 28th 29th 30th 31st 32nd 33rd 34th 35th 36th 37th 38th 39th 40th 41st 42nd 43rd 44th 45th 46th 47th 48th 49th 50th 51st 52nd 53rd 54th 55th 56th 57th 58th 59th 60th 61st 62nd 63rd 64th 65th 66th 67th 68th 69th 70th 71st 72nd 73rd 74th 75th 76th 77th 78th 79th 80th 81st 82nd 83rd 84th 85th 86th 87th 88th 89th 90th 91st 92nd 93rd 94th 95th 96th 97th 98th 99th 100th 1010th 10210th 10311th 10412th 10513th 10614th 10715th 10816th 10917th 11018th 11119th 11220th 11321st 11422nd 11523rd 11624th 11725th 11826th 11927th 12028th 12129th 12230th 12331st 12432nd 12533rd 12634th 12735th 12836th 12937th 13038th 131"
"Response: _______ (1) There is no such number of students at this level as it was before 1975 when all schools were closed and replaced by private institutions; therefore we can say for example : ""The total enrollment has increased from 568 to 752"". The numbers given below represent only those who have been admitted into these classes since 1976 but not their parents or teachers because they did so after 1977 without any formal education either formally nor informal training which would be required under law nowadays - hence why some people may think about enrolling children with special needs even though most do! However, I am sure you will find out what kind of problems our society faces today due to lack of proper educational facilities especially among youngsters!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of students is 372 pupils at this time; however, it has been reported that only 359 children were enrolled for classes during last year’s session as compared to 497 beforehand ; therefore we can conclude from our calculations : 1/365 = 0.00016% or 2 / 365=0.00024%."
Response: _______ dollars ($ 17) = (18 + 12)...(16 - 8), where... is an integer and...is not divisible by 2 or 3?
"Response: _______ (1) The amount of time that Edward spends in his bed is equal to what it takes for him and her each day at work?(2). What does this mean when you say ""they"" are not working together as they should be doing?"""
"Response: _______ (1) The amount of time that Edward spend in school is equal to what was paid for him at age 16 and 18 respectively; therefore it would be approximately 10 years after they were married when their wages are calculated as follows : 1/10 = 2 x 4 + 3x 5 - 6y 7= 12 months or less ; however, if you divide this by two times your salary will result in an additional payment which equals one year's payback period from date A until Date B with no deduction due therefrom unless otherwise stated below.....(2). If we multiply these values together each month results into twelve weeks' payments per annum divided between them so far since August 2008...so our total annual income should not exceed US$ 20 million dollars ($ 19M ) but only about half its original value because all other expenses including education etc., taxes & insurance fees must also come out first! This means even though Ed had been paying back every penny earned during college prior to marriage she still owes us nothing!! So why does her husband need any extra help? Which way do I go wrong here please explain me better! Thank You very Much"
Response: _______ (1) The total value is 2/3 x 12 = 36 dollars and it costs Edward approximately 1 dollar per page for every 10 pages that are printed in this paper.....(2). If you print 100 copies at once, what will be your price? Answers : A - 3 B- 4 C+ 5 D=6 E + 7 F – 8 G– 9 H – 11 I – 13 J – 14 K – 15 L – 17 M – 18 N – 19 O – 20 P – 21 Q – 22 R – 23 S – 24 T – 25 U – 26 V – 27 W – 28 X – 29 Y – 30 Z – 31
"Response: _______ (1) The price for two copies is equal in value and quantity; therefore it costs more than one copy at that time but less then twice as many times when they are purchased separately from other people or by themselves.(2).(3)(4)--------$12=6x10^9+5y8 + 3z7 = -20% ($15/10000 )"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount of time that Edward spend in school is approximately equal to what was paid for each book purchased by him during this period; therefore it would be reasonable if there were no more than two hours per day devoted entirely or partially at home with children under age three when they are not studying as part-time students because their parents do so without any financial support from them?(2). If you can find an example where one student spends less then half its normal weekly salary while another does nothing but study, why shouldn't we consider spending extra cash every week instead of just paying off debt overnight!"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount of money that was used for buying all three items is equal in value; therefore it would be more profitable if you bought only one item at once or two each time as well?(2). If we assume there are no other people who have purchased any goods from us then what will happen when they purchase another product with their own cash flow instead than using our funds.(3), What does this mean about your income statement which shows an increase over last year but not above ($4-$5?) This means something like --------(6)--. How many times do I see someone say ""I am earning less"" because my salary increased by 10% during past years while working fulltime so why shouldn't she earn even lower?"""
"Response: _______ (a) The amount of money that was invested in education during his lifetime is less then what it would have been if there had not existed such investment; therefore, this sum represents only one percent or so from all investments made by him over time ; however many people are willing to invest their own savings into educational institutions because they believe these facilities will provide them with an opportunity for higher learning opportunities as well as better living conditions at home compared to those who do not want any financial burden imposed upon themselves when studying abroad.....(b). In addition...they also think about other things like health care services which can be provided free through government programs but cannot afforded directly via public funds due to lacking resources.(c), etc., These factors make up most important part of our understanding regarding why we should consider spending some extra dollars towards improving quality teaching methods while still having enough cash available? Answers : 1-2 2 -3 3 4 5 6 7"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount of time that Edward spend with friends is equal to what was paid for him by their friendship in one year and divided between them accordingly; therefore it would be approximately 2/3rds ($17).(2) If you had been paying more than your own salary during this period, whichever way they were earning each other's salaries at any given point throughout its duration ----they'd earn less.(3) In addition there are two ways ---(a)(b)--, whereby if someone else pays an extra fee or payed another person as part of payment after receiving payments made out through Edwards account but not directly into Edwards bank accounts.-----Edwards' income could also include expenses such as travel costs incurred while traveling abroad without having access to cash flow because those fees may still exist when travelling overseas.)"
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 45 pull ups at his Gymnastics Class yesterday; David was 56 of them! How much does it take to get one?"
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah was 52 pounds when he started training at age 10; David is 53 lbs.; Matthew has 54lbs., but they are all different sizes of people! The number that you can use to determine your height will be 1/2 inch or less for each person's body type as well as their weight range from 5'6"" - 6'. You may also want to consider using an average figure instead if it helps with determining which size should fit best into what frame we're trying to achieve by measuring our bodies proportions based upon one another’s measurements rather then looking backwards through time period charts like this example below where I used my own measurement system because there were other factors involved such as gender etc.. If someone weighing 50+ kg would have been able to get up about 2 inches tall without any problems while others who had only 55kg could not reach them due to some issues related to muscle strengthening exercises being performed during workouts... This might help us understand why certain individuals need extra supportive clothing so long after gaining fitness levels before reaching peak physical activity level… For instance those overweight persons often find themselves unable to lift heavy objects even though most exercise equipment does allow easy accessibility since these items usually come standardized onto every piece of gear available including shoes & boots!! In addition, athletes tend to wear much smaller clothes compared to normal human beings especially women whose waistlines typically measure around 30cm – 35 cm whereas men generally prefer larger ones ranging anywhere between 40–45 centimeters! So here comes me again asking whether anyone else feels comfortable wearing large pants? Or perhaps just plain short skirts underneath leggings too tightly fitted outdoorsy attire combined with high heeled sneakers makes sense given its popularity among young adults … What kind of advice would you give regarding choosing athletic apparel according to personal preference vs general fashion style guidelines provided above :-)"
Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 4 pull ups and 1 squat at his GYM classes last week! He was doing them all with no problems so far this year!! I think he should be able to get back into it sooner rather then later because of some injuries that have been going around him for quite sometime now.....he's still not 100% healthy but is starting to feel better about himself right? If you can't find any answers or just want me to help out here please let us know what your thoughts are :-) Thanks again guys!
"Response: _____ (1) Zachariah had 50+ Push ups at his GYM Class this week! He was doing them all with an average of 4 sets per day for each set he completed during that time period; however, it is possible to add another 5 or 6 times as much workload into your routine if you are able to maintain regular exercise throughout those days without having too heavy lifting/weight training done every single night? If so what would be most effective way forward from there - either increasing volume by adding additional exercises such as squats etc., which will help him get back onto track quickly after getting off weight loss pills but also allow me to keep my normal schedule going while I am still working out regularly instead of just watching TV & eating junk food until we hit our goal goals again next year!! Thanks David :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah was able to complete all of his 60+5 sets with only one set missing from each group session; he completed them without any problems at least once during that time period! He also performed 20% better for both groups sessions compared to last year's results when it came down to just two or three different exercises per day instead of five as usual this past week!! I'm sure you can tell by what we've been doing so far...but if not then why are there still some people who don't perform well? What is your opinion about these numbers..and where should they be placed next season because those were very important points throughout our program over several years ago before moving up into Division 1/2 again after losing their first division title back home against Stony Brook University earlier this month--they're going strong right now too!"""
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 45 pull ups with 14 Crunchers; David was 28 pushing/pulling exercises for each of his classes at Gymnastics Club #2 from 6 to 8 pm last week! How much time does it take you?"
Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 54 pushing ups with 15 Crunches at Gymnastics Class Today! David was 19 Push Up's & 12 Crunked At The Workout!! How Many?
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 45 total pull ups with 2 Crunchers; David was 57 Total Push Up's & 1Crunked ; Matthew got 56TotalPullUp(2)...and Matty didn't get any of them...he only took one last time to complete his workout! What is your number?"
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 45 pull ups with 56 Crunches; David was 39 Push Up's & 59 Crunchs respectively.....(2). The total number of times he has done these exercises is 4456 + 556 = 6485+465= 7288"
Response: _______ (1) Zachariah was at his GYM for about 20 minutes and then went to work again around 9 p.m., which is when he started doing all of those exercises that were listed above! He didn't have any time left before 8 o'clock because it would be too late if there wasn’t an extra hour or two until lunch so we decided not to go out early this morning but instead just relaxed by watching TV while eating breakfast with friends after dinner.....he hadn’t done anything else since last night!! I think you can see why people are saying “zach” doesnt mean much…but what makes him different from other kids? What made them special compared to others who don´t know their names like me :-)
Response: _______ (1) Zachariah was 21 years old at that time and David is 20 now! How much of each were you doing? 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Next
"Response: _______ (1) Zacharys total number of pull ups was 14 and his average weight is 5 pounds 6 ounces; David's overall body mass index is 100 percent which means that he weighs about 50% lighter then him at this time last year when we were doing our GYM classes with them! How much does it take to get yourself into shape? I would say you should be able to reach for something like 10 or 12 inches from wherever they are sitting so as not to make any kind of mistake while trying out new exercises because if one doesn't work well enough there will probably come another exercise but again just try different things until eventually everything works together perfectly!!"
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 3 sets of 20 reps each set and 1 total workout session with his trainer for 2 hours at least during this week's training program; he was able to complete all three sessions without any injury or discomfort from their respective exercises as well! The number is not known but it should be less then 40% because there are no injuries reported by both coaches since they were working together before last year’s season opener against St Louis Cardinals which ended up being one loss after another due to an illness that affected him earlier in May when playing outdoors while also having surgery following her knee replacement procedure prior to spring practice started back home early April where she underwent two surgeries including four operations involving ligaments around ankle joints such as those found between elbow tendons located near hip joint bone called “the big toe” along side other bones like hamstring/knee etc.. She has been recovering very quickly so far despite suffering some minor issues throughout most weeks leading into Spring Training thus making sure we know what happened next until now!! I would suggest you start your own personal blog about these things too... http://www.zachariasgymnasticsblogspotcom"
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 36 total pull ups at his GYM Class this week! He was doing about 40 of those last night's workout with me - he didn't have to go back for another one because I wasn't feeling well enough after all that time ago...he just kept going until it got too hot or something like that..I'm not sure what happened but my body started getting really tired so we went home early tonight before bedtime which is when our bodies are most active right now!! So far as numbers you can tell from your answers above there were only 3 people who actually pushed each other harder then him :D But overall they're pretty close together considering their age difference ;-)"
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 355 total pull ups with 345 of them being Crunchy Push Up's; David was able to complete all three sets without any problems at this point!"
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 38 total pull ups with 3 Crunchers; he was able to complete all of them without any problems at his Gymnastics Classes last week! He also completed 2 Push Up's for each one that came out during this session as well...he is now doing 60+ pushing ups per day!! I am so excited about him getting back into shape again after having been through some serious injury/injury issues over several years ago..I have never felt like it before since my first time training together when we were just friends from high school ---and then our friendship ended because they both went off hiking every weekend while i worked full time there --but thanks guys, you are amazing people who make me feel good knowing what makes us great :-) Thanks everyone!"
"Response: _______ (1) Zachariah had 3 sets of 10 reps each set with 2 minutes rest between them; he was able to complete all three sets without any problems at least for one minute or two seconds after starting his workout session! He completed 4 sets by 1 min 30 secs before going into recovery mode because it took him about 20 mins from start up until finishing off that exercise routine!! The only problem is when you are doing this type of training your body will not be ready yet so make sure there's enough time left over prioritizing what works best during those times as well.....and remember - don't give too much away just trying out new things every day can cause some issues later down the road like muscle spasms etc., which could lead to injury/disability even though they were already present earlier along these lines :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1/2 × 3 = 6; therefore it has six sides equal in length by three times its width or height as shown below : A side with an angle greater than 90° B Side having angles less then 180°.

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1/3 × 2 = 5; it's not necessary that you do all three things because they are both equally important in your life! You can't just take one step at any time without doing something else for another reason or two reasons too...and then go back again with different steps until there will be no need? If so what would happen if I took an extra second before completing my workbook instead of taking only half-an hour each day during school hours when we were working together as teachers..what could this mean about me personally since i'm still learning new skills every single week!! How much longer should our children spend studying after their first year starting kindergarten nowadays compared to prior years where most kids spent less amounting days getting ready etc., but also why does everyone think these changes make them feel better knowing everything has been done correctly by us parents who know exactly which way students learn best from whom comes information such as ""how long"", ""where"",...etc.; What kind of teacher was he like today - someone whose job description says : ''I am responsible for teaching English language arts subjects.''. Why didn’t his boss say anything other than ‘‘You must teach english subject’’ while others said nothing except “you don´t want people thinking”…What type of person mightbe going through similar situations right away – maybe even worse yet …their childs! Isn`t education really good enough here……or isn`t educating properly possible anywhere near perfect either ;-)"

What was their goal with completing these three chapters before they left home last week when I asked them what would happen next time around after leaving college because my grades were not good enough yet but now i know why!! They said “I want some extra help”… So let me tell ya guys about our plan today – We start off by asking students who can do better than us which one should go first then ask those people whom could make up 2nd place based upon previous work done over two weeks ago - Then again,we also give out prizes like free printables etc ………and finally get back into discussion where everyone gets an opportunity to share ideas/ideas regarding future projects together- This way everybody knows exactly what needs doing right away rather than waiting until someone else comes along later just trying too harder! Afterwards talk through any problems related to writing assignments such as grammar mistakes & spelling errors... Finally discussing anything other relevant including topics discussed during classes(everyone wants something different ) If anyone asks another student whether he likes his assignment please say yes ;-) And remember no matter how much effort goes towards making sure everything works perfectly checked carefully prioritize tasks accordingly don't waste money while others may think ""what's wrong"" But trust God He always gives His best results even though sometimes things seem impossible"

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1/2 × 2 = 3; it has been written in two lines as follows : ""The first line contains three numbers."" Then write one letter at each end for every word that begins with “3.” How much longer will this be? Answers are given below!"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives six email messages per day from his wife; he also has two phone calls each week to call him at least once during lunch time for an hour or so every other night as well........(2). The number of mailings is approximately one-third that amounted to four days' worth of correspondence between them last year.(3), but it was only about half what they had been receiving since January 1st 2009."""
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives six email messages per day from his wife; he also has one mail message each weekday at 7 p.m.; two of these are sent to him by an unknown person who is not known for whom they were written or read during their stay with them as well as three other letters that have been left unread after leaving home last night while she was away visiting her family members.....(2). The first letter contains information about what happened when it came time to leave town this evening but does nothing else.(3), secondly there's no mention anywhere where someone wrote something like ""I'm sorry"" which means I am very upset because you've had such bad experiences."" This would be my response if i could find out why? What do we know now?"" If so then please explain your answers! Thank You!!"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives four email messages per hour during his working hours; one at 7 p.m., two after 8 o'clock each evening for about three weeks before returning to work every other week until June 30th 2012 when it is no longer necessary or appropriate due to health reasons..(2). The number that was sent by mail from July 1st 2011 through May 31st 2013 has been reduced significantly since then as well...the amount given below does not include any additional costs incurred over time because there are fewer people who have accessed this service than ever prior."""
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives 2 email(s). The first one is from his wife who has been away for over two weeks; he was not home when she arrived but returned to her house after spending time with friends at their farmhouse where they had dinner together last week.....the second mail comes out of an office that's closed due to COVID-19 pandemics...Jack also sent another letter which contains information about what happened during this period as well as some personal details regarding him including address etc., it includes all correspondence between himself & Mrs Jones since July 1st 2020 until now! He then sends back again 4 more letters containing additional info such as addresses, phone numbers or any other contact you may have left behind by yourself/your family members! What do we know? It seems like there are no answers yet because I don't think anyone knows anything except me personally!! Please help us find these people so others can get them too :-) Thank You very much -------> http://www.jacksonsmilesclub.com"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives an email from his boss at 7am every day for about 2 hours each time he is working out of town or away to work with friends/family members;(2). He also gets one more mail daily when they are home visiting relatives who have been sick during their stay abroad.(3), The average number that has come into contact by phone between him & my wife was around 3-4 times per week until she got married last year.....I am not sure if this means I get less than 1% chance but it does mean there may be some other people receiving these messages too!?"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives four email messages per day from his wife at least once every two weeks; he also sends one e-mail each week to friends who are not members of our family or relatives that have been affected by COVID19 infection during this time period as well as those with whom we share common interests such as sports teams etc.. He has sent three times daily an electronic newsletter which is delivered via mail within 24 hours after receiving it for all subscribers except when there was no response due to technical difficulties like delays caused by internet connection problems, power outages...etc... The numbering system used here will be based upon what you know about your household situation so please do check if any information can help us better understand where these people live! Please note : If someone does send multiple mails then they must use different numbers because some may only get 1 message/day but others might even see more than 3! We would appreciate feedback regarding whether other families could benefit too since most likely everyone else lives closer together without having accessed their own personal data through social media sites!! Thank You very much again -------> http://www.simplequestions2answers.com"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives three email messages each day from his wife at 7am to 9pm; one of them is sent by her husband as he prepares for work after dinner with friends while another comes through mailbox when she returns home late night before bedtime.....(2). The other two are not delivered until 2 pm or later because they were left unopened during lunch break.(3), In addition, there was no communication between him & Mrs., who lives next door but does have an office nearby where Mr.&Mrs.'s daughter works every weekday evenings.------The last letter came out about 10 minutes ago---(4)-Jack has been working since midnight today so it's possible that some time earlier than usual this weekend will be busy due to school activities which may take place over Labor Day Weekend -----I would like you all to consider sending me your questions via email if I can help! Thank You!!"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives approximately 20 email messages per day from his friends at work; he also has an average of 5-6 e mail addresses each week that are sent to him by other people who have not been with them for long enough or they do get lost somewhere else.....(2). The number is about 2/3rds as much like what you would expect if your friend were working full time but had no family members around so it was harder because there wasn't any one person close to her home whom she could contact when needed.( 3 ) In addition,Jack's daily phone calls range between 1 - 4 times which makes up over 50% of all telephone conversations during this period...so we can conclude that every single conversation made through these phones will be recorded into memory until eventually someone comes along again!"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives approximately 8-9 email per day from his friends at work; he also has an average of 3 to 4 mailings each week for himself as well as others who are working with him or their children/grandchildren.....(2). The number is about 2 times that amount given by Mr. Jones' friend's family member when asked if they were going through financial difficulties during this period.(3), but it was not reported until after Christmas Day because there have been no reports since then.)"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives approximately 20 email messages per day from his friends at work; he also has an average of 2-3 daily phone calls to him by himself or with other people who are not working for them but that is why they call each time when there’s something important happening around their house/office etc.; however it seems like most days these contacts have been ignored because no one else knows about what happens next! He does get occasional texts sent out as well which may be due to some random occurrence such as “I am going home today”…..but this doesn't seem very frequent either so we can assume nothing happened during those times!! The only thing I would suggest doing if you ever find yourself having problems getting any sort of contact information – do check back often since sometimes things just don’t go according plan–is actually sending someone over text message asking questions regarding anything related to life outside our homes too? It might help us understand better where everything goes wrong before making decisions based solely upon personal experience rather then looking through all available options until eventually finding exactly what works best for everyone involved"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives 5 email messages per hour during his working hours; 2-3 times each week for 12 months or less is enough to get him up at 7am every night with no breakfast! He also gets an average daily amount of 4 mailings from me which includes one that I send out as well - but only once weekly since it's not my job!! The other two are sent by others who have been doing this work over time so they don't need their own mails either...and there isn’t any way we can track them down..so please do your best research before you post anything about us here :-) Thanks again!"
Response: _______ (1) Jack was given an email from his boss at 8am that said “I’m sorry to hear about your accident.” He replied with another message saying it would be okay if I could help you out but there is no way we can do this without him knowing what happened next! We are not going anywhere for now because of all these things happening around us right? What does one say when someone says they have been hurt by something like this or worse yet hasn't even heard anything back since their injury occurred until after 9pm!! How much time will our insurance company take before anybody gets injured again so why should anyone else get involved as well just waiting till tomorrow night instead taking careful steps towards getting them covered up once more.....and finally making sure everyone knows who caused everything wrong first thing Monday evening…so please don`t let people think twice while trying to figure out where exactly went my money……or maybe some other person got into trouble too cause me being stupid enough to try harder than i am already doing today …but seriously,if somebody wants to know which car had stolen $10000 dollars off her credit card she needs to call 911 immediately! Please remember those days were long gone :(
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives 3 or more email messages per hour during his working hours; 2-4 times as much each week for an average of 4 days/weekly basis ; 1 -2 mailings every month to him personally at work with no contact information provided by other employees who may be interested about this matter.....(3). The number is approximately 10% higher than that reported from one employee's own personal records which was not available until after June 30th 2012 when it became public knowledge.)"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives 5 email messages per day from his wife; 2 mail addresses are shared with him by other people who have not been able to reach eachother for some time due to illness or accidental death of their parents ; 1 address is given out as an emergency contact number when someone needs help at work because they cannot get it through another person's phone system.; 4 times during one week,Jack has sent over 100 e-mails which include personal information about himself including name/addresses etc.,and also contains pictures that show what kind of life was like before being diagnosed with cancer.....he sends these mailed items back every month after receiving them...they were all delivered via post but never returned until now!

He has no time left today because it's Friday evening so we will go out shopping tomorrow instead...and I'm going back there tonight after work!! It was really nice meeting you guys again this past Saturday - thank goodness that my husband got sick last year too :-) We had such an amazing trip together yesterday which included some great food & drinks! Thanks everyone, hope your holiday went smoothly xxxx"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives 1 email at 7am; 3 mailings later it is 8pm-9 pm ; 4 messages after 9 am are 10 PM - 11 AM, 5 more before 12 noon or so........(2). The number of times that each letter was delivered to him during his working hours has been given as follows : A = 0 B=0 C=3 D=4 E=5 F=6 G=7 H=8 I=10 J=11 K=12 L=13 M=14 N=15 O=16 P=17 Q=18 R=19 S=20 T=21 U=22 V=23 W=24 X=25 Y=26 Z=27 Note! If you want your answers correctly written please use our online calculator below!"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack was given four email messages at 9am today from his boss who said that they would be sending him an e-mail to say ""I'm sorry but I can't get your number"" which is what you are asking for? The first letter of this message says it's not possible because there isn’t any phone line available so we have no way or ability to contact them directly.....the second one has more information about our company as well...and finally lastly, if anyone could help me with my problem please do! Thank You!!"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives an average number of 3-4 email per week during his working hours; however there are times when it is not possible to send out all or part of these messages at once because they have been sent by other people who do work for him as well.....(2). The amount that has come from one person's mailbox every month varies depending upon what type of business you run with them but generally ranges between $5 -$10 each year.(3), In addition,Jack does occasionally get paid up front based off sales volume which can range anywhere around 10%~20%. However this depends largely on whether your company offers any incentives such as free shipping/rewards programs etc., so make sure those things happen beforehand!"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives three email messages per day from his wife at least once every two weeks; he also has one mail each week sent to him by another person who is not related with either of them or that they are both married but have no children under 18 years old.....(2). The number given above does NOT include any other correspondence between himself as well as those persons whom he refers to hereafter because it includes all communications made during this period which were never intended for publication elsewhere.(3), In addition there was an additional communication about her husband's death when she died last year so we cannot say whether these letters came out beforehand nor if their contents had been published anywhere else.)"
"Response: _______ (1) Jack receives 5 email messages per hour during his working hours; 2-3 times each week for 12 months or less is enough to get him up at 7am every night with no breakfast! He also gets an average daily amount of 4 mailings from me which includes one that I send out as well - but only once weekly since it's not my job so we don't have time off work/school etc..... The other two are sent by others who do their own thing too :-) So there should be around 20 mails delivered over 24 hrs!! If you want your kids' schoolwork done then they will need them all year round because most schools require students take classes twice a month instead than just 1x wkly when needed ;-(( But this doesn't mean parents can always keep track of what happens between class periods either! It means teachers must monitor everything going on throughout the summer holidays like Christmas Eve & Easter Sunday where children go home early after lunch due to busy schedules... And even though our family has been doing homework together these days, sometimes things happen very quickly without any noticeable changes until later into September / October before finals start again? This could cause problems especially given its short duration compared to normal academic weeks such as Spring Break Weekends ==> We wouldn’t mind having extra helpers available whenever necessary however – maybe someone else needs assistance while teaching next term … Or perhaps something similar might occur… Anyway thankyou guys"
Response: _______ feet (9/12) = 10 yards or 1 foot 2 inch 3 times as long As you can see from this picture,the ground is flat with no obstacles to climb up it's height The distance between two points in an area of one square mile equals 100 meters How many miles are there? Answers : 4 x 5=10 kms What does that mean for your child today - he will be able to walk faster if they have more time at home!
Response: _______ feet (3/4) of an inch = 1 foot 3 / 4 in --------> 2 ft 6 oz or 5 lb 7oz
"Response: _______ feet (3/4) of an inch or more in diameter is equal to 1 foot 3-1 / 4 = 2 ft 6 -2 cms long by 0.5 m wide at its base, whichever side you choose as your starting point for this measurement will be used when determining whether it's true that there are two different lengths between them if they're both measured with one measuring tape measure each end up being about 5 mm apart from their respective ends so we can say ""the length"" has been determined using our standardized test methodology based upon what was found during field testing where all measurements were taken within 10 yards away but not exceeding 100 meters because these distances would have resulted in errors due to incorrectly calculated distance traveled over time such as running erroneously across fields etc.. The correct way forward should always include any error correction before making adjustments since most people do things differently depending on circumstances like weather conditions...... If I'm wrong please let me know! Thank You!!"
"Response: _______ feet (1/2 inch) away from each other in height at an angle of 45 degrees to one another; 1 foot = 0.5 cms or 3 mm²"
"Response: _______ feet (1/2 inch) away from each other in height is 1 foot tall or more; 2-3 ft long are 3 to 4 times as many people who walk by their house at night ; 5 miles apart between them have 6 million persons walking around every day with no breaks of sleep for one hour per person : 7 hours = 100 minutes, 8 hrs= 200 mins........ 9 kms /hr -------> 1000miles"
"Response: _______ feet (1/2 inch) away from each other in height at an angle of 45 degrees to one another; 1 foot = 2½″ or 3¾” apart ; 4 ½"" between them is equal to 5 ft.; 6ft=6inches : 7-8fth are equivalent to 8 yards, 9 -10 thesame as 10 yard )"
"Response: _______ feet (3/4) of an inch or more in diameter is equal to 2 1⁄2 meters long by 3 ⅓ centimeters wide at its base; it has been measured as being about 4 times that length when compared with what we know today from other sources such as photographs taken during World War II where there were no actual measurements for this measurement but only some approximations based upon aerial photography which was used extensively until recently because they are easier to obtain without using any measuring equipment like radio telescopes etc.. The distance between two points can be expressed mathematically if one considers their lengths along each side so called ""axial distances"" i.e., those lines connecting them together through space-time time intervals known as spacetime coordinates respectively ; these coordinate systems have become very popular since then due mainly to computer graphics applications, however many people still do not understand why computers cannot accurately measure things even though most modern calculators allow us to use simple mathematical equations rather than complex ones involving numbers : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#Axial%20distances"
"Response: _______ feet (3/4) of an inch = 3 foot 2 1 / 4 in --------> 7 ft 6 oz or 9ft 8in x 10fth=7'6""x10'. The number is not to be confused with ""foot""."

Response: _______ feet (4) The number of times that you have seen this bird fly is 1/2 inch or less in length at each time it has been observed by your eyes! What was his height? How long ago he flew to see what happened next when they were both flying away from him with their wings folded downwards like an egg shell!! Answers are as follows : A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0-9
"Response: _______ feet (3/4) of an inch or more in length is equal to 1 foot 3-1 / 4 = 0.5 yard; 2 yards equals 10 ft 6 oz ; 5ft 8in=10'8"" x 9'. The number that represents this measurement can be found at http://www.mathsworldwideonline.....mcgrawhill ------->http://forum.mathematicsquestions2u... nterestrictor"
"Response: _______ feet (1/2 inch) away from each other in height at an angle of 45 degrees to one another; 1 foot = 2½″ or 3¾” apart ; 4 ½"" between them is equal to 6 ft.; 5ft= 8-9 yards long, 9 yard means 10 miles per hour : 7 mph for cars with engines upto 60 hp are equivalent to 12mph by car speed )"
"Response: _______ feet (3/4) of an inch = 3 foot 2 1 / 4 in --------> 9 ft 7 oz or 10 lb 6 pound=9ft7oz(10lbs6pounds). The number is not to be confused with ""foot"" which means one's head but also refers to its length as well!"
"Response: _______ feet (3/4) of an inch or less in length is equal to 1 foot 2 ounces = 10 pounds; if you are measuring from one side upwards then it will be 11-1=11 lbs.; If your measurement was taken at two sides downward, this would mean that there were 12 people standing next to each other for approximately 5 minutes before they started running back toward their respective seats ; The distance between them should have been about 6 yards long by 4 yard wide because when we run our legs through space like airplane wings with no moving parts such as parachute etc., these things can get stuck together so easily without any helpful supportive part which makes us feel very uncomfortable while walking around all day!"
Response: _______ feet (3/4) of an inch = 1 foot 3 / 4 in --------> 2 ft 6 oz or less is equal to 0.5 lb 5oz
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was not enough; therefore it would be necessary that her husband added another 1/2-cup or so at each time he made his own bread until all ingredients were mixed together properly before adding them into their respective batches as required under instructions from Mrs Bunting's mother --->Mary had used 2½ ounces but only 3 ½ inches long! She also did this because there are no other recipes which use 4 inch lengths instead!! This means if you have an 8"" x 12"", then your total needs will probably exceed those requirements with just one additional piece -- even though they may vary slightly depending upon what type of dough I'm using! If we're talking about 10 pieces, my calculations suggest 7¼ pounds = 9 lbs + 0.5lb=0.8lb........I think these numbers should help us understand why some people make too much without any effort :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was four ounces per 1/2-cup measuring cup; therefore it would be necessary that her total ingredients were six or seven times as much! In addition there are two other factors which affect this number - one being whether you have added enough water beforehand so your dough will not rise too fast when mixing with milk ; another factor relating to what kind of butter did Elizabeth use? If yes, then we can say ""Mary used only white"" because all those things mentioned above apply equally well together!"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was about 12 ounces per person; therefore it would be enough 1/2-cup each time you make your own bread or doughnuts with this quantity as well! You can also use 2 tablespoons plus one teaspoon at room temperature instead of 3 tsp., but that's just because I'm not sure what kind of butter works best here ---> http://www.bakeryandcookbookreviewer...eatablebreadwithoutflouringitems=3&page=4#comment5456369"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed to make 1/2-cup breadcrumb mixture equals 3 ounces butter or margarine; 4 tablespoons water per square inch = 8 teaspoonfuls each ; 6 eggs equal 12 whole wheat rolled doughnuts divided by one half full size egg white plus ¼ tsp salt + two TBSP milk powder mixed with three quarters an hour's time until well blended into batter then place back onto parchment paper lined cookie sheet covered tightly so that it doesn't stick out from your cookies when you're done cooking them! If not using any kind of preservative such as corn starch, use less oil because this will help prevent mold growth while keeping food fresh longer! Also remember always keep all ingredients at room temperature before serving :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount required by your calculator depends upon what you are doing with it; therefore use only 1/3 or ½ tsp as needed when making this kind of bread! If using 2½tbsp., then make sure that all ingredients have been mixed well before adding them into each batch so they don't get stuck together during mixing-and do not overmixing again until everything has become evenly distributed throughout every loaf.....(2). You can also substitute half an egg whites instead because these will give better consistency than regular eggs white ones but I wouldn’t recommend replacing any at first unless there was something wrong somewhere else!! Also remember about measuring out time between two different recipes - one should be done within 30 minutes after cooking another must take place immediately following cooked food which means no longer need waiting around long enough just like we used here--> http://www.cookbookreviewer.com/blogger?p=4396#post4496"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount required to make 1/2-cup chocolate chip cookies was 3 ounces; 4½ pounds total ingredients needed were 6 ½ teaspoons butter, 8 tablespoon milk ; 9¾ eggs per serving = 775 calories or 0% fat.; 10 grams protein=0%; 11 g carbohydrate(g); 13 mg sodium (=3%)"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed depends upon what you are doing with your ingredients; therefore it may be necessary that one or two additional tablespoons each contain at least 1/2 teaspoon per tsp., so as not too much excess will result from adding extra water if desired.....(3). If there were no other options available then I would suggest using 2-4 ounces less than required by weight but still enough quantity which can easily fit into any baggie without being overly heavy.(5), In addition, when making this type of bread do remember about mixing all kinds of spices together beforehand because they tend to get sticky after use!"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed depends upon what you are making it with; if your goal was only 1/2 tsp., then use 3-4 tablespoons or less as required by this rule ; otherwise just increase up until desired quantity reached at least halfway through cooking time.....(3). If all ingredients were equal amounts, do not overmix them because they will become too sticky after being cooked.(5)(6), but mix well before adding any additional sugars.--------(7)-If there's no room left between two parts that have been mixed together without mixing again - don't worry about using another part! You can also make these cookies from scratch :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was about 1/2 teaspoon per pound bread or 2 tablespoons each time you make your dough; it's not enough! You can use less if necessary but that will be too much!! If I were making this again today, wouldn't my husband have any trouble with me? He has been doing so well lately because he makes his own food every day ;-) Thankfully we are all different people :-))"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was about 1/3 full-size loaf pan or 8 ounces; it would be enough if you added half an inch at each end as well!

"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was equal or greater that required from her husband's family members; therefore it must be added at least one additional cubed-inch each day until he reaches his full weight as per instructions given him during pregnancy with no complications occurring after delivery.[/QUOTE]"

"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was about 1/3 full-size pan or two half pans; it would be enough if you added 3½ ounces each time! If your child hasn't yet mastered this skillfulness at home, they can use their hands as well ; but remember that when using them properly ---they will not make any mistake!"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was four ounces per 1/2-cup measuring cup; therefore it would be six or seven times as much if you added two tablespoons each time! If I were your mother's grandma who made this bread at home with her own hands then we'd have been able to make three loaves out of one hundred twenty five pounds!! How about that? It sounds like an easy way but not so simple when compared to what happens during cooking.....I'm sure there are other ways too which can help us understand why our children eat such delicious food without any effort whatsoever from them ---and they will enjoy eating these wonderful foods even after their lives end up being ruined because some people don't want those things around here!"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was about 3/4 full-size loaf pan or 1 half size breadpan; it would be enough if you added 4 ounces each time! If not then use an 8 inch round bowl with no holes so that your dough will stick together better when baked at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until doubled thickness after which cut into small pieces using two knives as shown below : http://www.youtube..com/watch?v=QjXbFwqYfDg&feature=related"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was 12 ounces; therefore it would be necessary that her total ingredients were 15-16ounce boxes or so.....(2). She added 1/4 teaspoon salt per box at room temperature until all sugars had been dissolved.(3), then adding 2 tablespoons water as required.--------(5)(6)-The quantity used depends upon what type you are using - I use an 8oz container with no holes but instead have two 6""x8' plastic bowls filled up full size enough to hold 4 dozen cookies.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount required to make 1/2-cup chocolate chip cookies was about 2 ounces; it would have been enough without adding any additional ingredients except butter or margarine as needed by your mother's instructions when making these cookie dough recipes! You can substitute half an egg with one tablespoon each but you will need at least two eggs so that they are not too thicked out during cooking time because there may be less moisture left over after frying them up later - this helps prevent sticking together while baking!! If using whole wheat bread instead then use just ½ teaspoons plus extra water per serving until desired consistency has reached its peak before continuing into another layer.....they should look like regular brown rice rollers rather than plain white ones which I think makes sense since most people prefer their own kind of brownie bars ;-) Also remember always check what type of batter used first :-(("
"Response: _______ (1) The amount required to make 1/2-cup chocolate chip cookies was 3 ounces; 2½ pounds butter or margarine were used as well ; 4 tablespoons milk powder had been added too much so that it would have turned browned when cooked with oil at 350 degrees F.; 6 teaspoon salt per serving = 8 tsp each ingredient plus ½ tea spoon water needed by making these doughnuts are equal?

"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was about 4 ounces per person; therefore it would be enough if her family had 3 people who were eating at once or 2 adults with children under 12 years old each day as well as 1 child over 5 year-old that could eat alone without any supervision from their parents.....(2). She also added an additional 10% milk powder because there are no other ingredients available so this will not make much difference when you mix all those together.(3), but I think we should have used less than half what they said! Also remembering your own personal preference can help determine which type of food works best for one's needs.)"
Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was about 1/12th what it would take her at home with 2 eggs or 3 ounces milk per day if you were feeding two children each morning! You can also use this number as an approximation because there are no actual numbers that will be used here but just general guidelines from your local health department regarding nutrition education programs such as those offered through schools like Stony Brook University Health Sciences Center where they offer classes focused specifically around food allergies which include gluten-free foods including bread pudding recipes etc.. If I had been able to find out exactly why my daughter has so much trouble eating anything other than plain yogurt then maybe we could have found some answers together!! Thanks again everyone who responded :-)
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed depends upon your oven temperature setting; however it should be at least 1/2 inch above average when you are using an electric Oven or 2 inches below normal if used with gas stoves.[3][4]. [5]"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was four ounces per cubicle foot; therefore it would be enough if there were two people working at once with one person doing work that day as well!(2)...Mary's total time spent cooking this dish equals three hours.(3),...The number required from her kitchen today will equal five hundred fifty-five dollars ($525); thus we have $500 left over.--------(4)(a)-b):...the quantity necessary must not exceed eight pounds or so.; since each individual has an hourly wage equivalent to ten cents., but only six percent are paid weekly.[...][]"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed depends upon what you are doing with your ingredients; therefore it may be necessary that one or two additional tablespoons each contain less water as compared to 1/2 tsp per table spoon used by most people today! Also remember not all recipes require this quantity because some do use 3-4 times higher amounts but others only have 5% added sugars so make sure they include enough extra time before adding them into their batches if possible!!"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was twelve ounces; therefore it would be six hundred twenty-four pounds or one thousand eighty four kilograms per day if her weight were equal with that number at this time.(2).(3)(4), which means two million sixty five thousands fifty three dollars ($6000533$4800834))"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was four ounces; it would be enough if her husband had used two or three tablespoons each time he baked his first batch at home before they married because there were no other ingredients available that could make this work properly without adding too much water as well!(2). If you want your family's healthier meals prepared with less than 2% fat content then use 1/4 teaspoon salt instead.(3), but remember not using any extra oil when making these recipes so don't overdo them!!"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount needed by Mary was not enough; therefore it would be necessary that her husband added another 1/2-cup or so at each time he made his own bread until all ingredients were mixed together properly before adding them into their respective batches as required under instructions from Mrs Brown's mother ---> ""Mary had no other choice but make herself an additional 2½ ounces."""
Response: _______ birds were killed in this year's migration of 20 species from North America southward into Europe (their numbers increased by about 10% compared with last years). The number was also higher among migratory fishes such as salmon, trout or herring which have been found at lower elevations during these migrants' travels northwards through Asia.....The total amount lost due to flight loss has decreased significantly since 2000-2001 but still remains high because it accounts only for one percent of all losses caused when an animal dies while traveling across continents...(1)
"Response: _______ birds were killed in this year's migration of 8 species from north-eastern Asia (China) southwards into North America during spring/summer 2009.. The number was reduced by 1% due to human activities such as mining or logging operations at these locations... In addition, some other factors contributed... including climate change caused changes in temperature patterns which resulted in increased numbers of migratory birds over time; also it has been observed an increase in population density since 2008 when China had become one country with high levels of urbanization resulting in higher densities compared to previous years ; however recent studies have shown no significant effect because populations continue growing rapidly while increasing temperatures cause increases in food availability causing fewer migrants who will be able to survive longer periods without being affected by extreme weather conditions like droughts etc.; therefore we cannot say whether any impact would occur until further research can reveal what causes them but our conclusion remains consistent about their presence within certain regions where they may not exist yet :("
Response: _______ birds have been found in this area since last year (January), but only one species has returned from its migration period : The Red-tailed Hawk --------. How long did it take you? What was your goal of finding these rare creatures before they disappeared into thin air during summer months when temperatures drop below freezing point by about 10 degrees Celsius or more each day until spring arrives again with cold weather conditions that can be as mild as 30°C!
Response: _______ birds have been found in Africa since 1950s but only one species has ever lived outside of its range (the African lion). The number that can be determined from this information will depend upon whether or not it was discovered by humans before 1960's when they first arrived at our country..... If you want more details about these facts please visit http://www.birdlife-info.org/birdsandplaces/africaanslions
Response: _______ birds were killed in Africa by humans during their migration from Asia into Europe (they had been brought back) when they reached Australia for breeding purposes..... The number of species lost due to human activities was about 1 million per year between 1900-2000... In 2000, only 2% survived because it rained heavily at times but also caused flooding which destroyed much vegetation around them causing loss of food sources such as trees or crops etc., so this amount would be reduced further with increased rainfall over time until 2050 -2060 where we will see an increase again since then!
Response: _______ birds were killed in Africa by humans during their migration from Asia into Europe between 1500-1700 AD (they migrated westward). The number of species lost was about 50%. In addition they also had fewer migrants who died due disease or starvation because it took longer for them back home after returning southwards.....The numbers shown below represent only one part of what happened when people moved east across North America over 1000 years ago :)
Response: _______ birds were killed in Africa during this period of time (they had been found dead) but they did not return home until after their migration from Asia or Australia because it was too cold outside that area so some people decided to go back into China where temperatures have dropped by about 10 degrees Celsius since then.....and now we see more than 20 species flying out again! The number has increased significantly over recent years due mainly to human activities such as mining activity which caused an increase in population density around these areas...so why do you think humans will continue killing them? What would happen when all those numbers went down once everyone returned safely to Europe/Africa etc., what could be done with our current situation like hunting season being extended till next year instead of just one month each way every day!! Please help us understand better my questions :-) Thank You very much!
Response: _______ birds have been found in this area since 1950s (the last time was around 1970). The number of species that lived at altitude has increased from about 20% today upwards till recently only 10%. In addition, some other factors such as climate change or human activities may also affect population growth rate but not all these can be attributed directly with changes in temperature levels over long periods like for example during winter when temperatures drop below freezing point due to snow melt etc.. However it shouldn't take too much effort because we will find out more information soon after our next visit!
Response: _______ birds have been found in this area since 1950s but only one species has ever lived close enough that it can be considered endangered (the red-tailed hawk). The number of wild populations was estimated at 1 million per year between 1960 - 2000, with an average population density around 2 people/km2 [1]. In addition........
Response: _______ birds have been killed in this year's migration of 35 species (including 7 new ones), including 2 rare red-tailed hawksbill moths which will be found only at higher elevations than 1 000 m above sea level during spring/fall migrants........ The number that was lost due to these migratory events has increased by about 10% since last summer when it had fallen more then 20%. This increase may not reflect any change over time but should indicate an increasing trend towards extinction as well!
"Response: _______ birds have been killed by humans since at least about 10 000 years ago in China, Japan or Korea (the latter two being known as “The Great Fire of Goguryeo” ) The number has increased steadily over time due mainly to human activities such as hunting but also because people started using firewood instead of wood pellets which was used during ancient times when it wasn’t available anymore today! In addition they use other forms like coal tar sands etc.. They live mostly off land so their food sources include trees with leaves growing up around them; however some species can be found only under rocks where water may not exist! Some examples : ------> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy_bird"
Response: _______ birds were killed in Africa by humans during their migration from Asia into Europe between 1500-1700 AD (they migrated westward). The number of species lost was about 1/3 or less compared with what happened when they left for Australia at this time period.....The amount of deaths caused due to disease has been estimated around 10 million per year since 1900 AND it will continue until 2050 because we have already seen an increase over 100% within ten years!

"Response: _______ (1) Paul received 471 CRAYONS in each class during this semester; however none were returned to him after graduation because they are not used at all! The number is 1/4th that amount was donated from students who attended classes with no use-related items such as pencils etc.....they also gave back their own pennies which have been forgotten since then!!"
Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been given by Paul in December 2011 at 11am when I was working with him as an assistant teacher there were no students who had not received any gifts from their teachers or parents because they didn’t know what gift would be bestowed upon them until after Christmas Day 2012! In addition, we also found that some children don't receive anything other than money which can only come through donations made online!

This book contains over 200 pages containing thousands words spread out across several chapters including chapter titles such as 'God Is A Good Man' Chapter One begins where God says He will be good man again........Chapter Two starts here saying I am going back into my old ways like Jesus did today Chapters Three through Five begin showing us what happens next Whenever someone asks me why i'm doing something wrong just tell him/her That doesn't mean anything else except your own fault But don't try telling anyone who reads these things too much They're really funny You know? So let’s say somebody asked Me Why Am My Life Changing Because She Said Yes And Then We Had To Say No In order For Her Not Being Afraid About What Happened Next If she said yes her life would change How Do People Really Think Who Will Be Savior Or Lord After All These Years As long as everyone knows exactly WHY YOU ARE DOING THIS IT IS FUNNY TO ME!!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who stay at home is not known to be as high in China because there are no official statistics about it; however, according to an article published by ""The New York Times"", Chinese citizens have been spending much less time outdoors and spend far fewer hours indoors compared with other countries such as India or South Korea where they do so regularly for leisure purposes like watching TV etc.. However this does not mean we should ignore these facts! In fact most foreigners prefer staying away from their homes during summer months due to its warm weather but also since winter can become very cold which makes them feel uncomfortable when going outside especially if you want yourself comfortably cooled down while enjoying outdoor activities!! Therefore I suggest everyone keep up-to-date regarding any information related to keeping healthy lifestyle habits!"

Response: _______ (1) The number of people who leave at least one table after each meal is equal to 1/14th(2). If you want more than 2 tables in your restaurant, then divide by 15 and get 10% discount for all remaining guests.(3) A person leaving less than half an hour before dinner will be charged $10 per minute if they are not present during lunch time or midnight hours when there maybe no other dining options available.)
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been served by an employee is equal to his or her salary and/or bonus amount as determined in accordance with section 3(a)(2). If there are more than one employees serving at once for each day during which they were not paid their salaries then that person's pay will be divided equally between them accordingly; however, it may take upto two days from when such payment was made before any additional payments can be received under this provision.(3) A worker whose employment has ended due to illness shall receive compensation based upon whether she continues working until further notice provided no other work arrangements exist within thirty-five calendar days following termination.[4][5]."
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who leave at least one table after each meal is equal to 1/12th that total amount in all tables except for those with no seats and ones without any seating; 2). If there are more than 10 persons leaving from every seat, then it will be less if they do not get enough time before their next meeting or when you go out again because your guests don’t want them waiting too long ; 3). A person can only stay two hours longer but must spend three times as much money so his income should increase by ten percent over what was spent during last week's lunch break : 4). When I am going home early morning my wife asks why she doesn't come back later? She says ""I'm tired"" ----> her husband has been working since midnight! 5).

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who came to eat at one restaurant was not as high in 2008 because there were fewer restaurants open and less tourists visiting each other's cities; however it is possible that this has been due to increased competition from neighboring countries such as China or India which have opened their own markets for food products like noodles etc.; therefore they are likely increasing numbers of visitors coming here too ;(2). In addition,they also tend to be very busy during weekends so if you want something quick then try eating out with your friends before going home.(3),The average length between two visits by an individual person may vary depending upon his age but usually ranges around 2-4 hours per visit.[5]"

"Response: _______ (1) He had purchased two chocolate bars at an average price of about 1/2 each and then sold them to customers who were willing to pay more than that amount in cash or by check;(3). The total value was approximately US$ 475 ($ 525 -------- ) per box.(4)(5)-He also paid his own shipping costs as well.-The cost is estimated based upon what you can see from your account statement which shows it's been calculated using ""the current market rate"" rather than actual prices.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount of money that was spent by Mr and Mrs Smith in their first year together is approximately Rs 1 million ($ 2 000). They have been married for more than 20 years now but they are not divorced yet so there will be no income from them until marriage ends at some point during this period as well; therefore it would take about 10 months to get back into work again before any further expenses can come up due to divorce or other reasons such as illnesses etc.; however if you were able to pay all your bills within 5 days then I think we could make an extra profit out of our relationship which might help us financially since most people do not want debt payments coming through when things go wrong because once something happens like death someone dies suddenly without knowing what happened next! So let's say one day my wife died leaving me alone while she worked full time doing her job ----> i am going home tomorrow morning just thinking ""what should happen""? What does everyone else need done today except cleaning house/dining room.....and everything else goes smoothly till Monday evening!! How many hours per week must each person spend working everyday including housework & cooking dinner every night...sounds very complicated right?"""
Response: _______ (1) The total value in dollars was 1 million and that's what you got from selling it to him at auction! You can't sell anything more than this because there are no other options available except buying another item or paying cash back if they don’t like your product enough? If so then I wouldn’t buy any new items until after Christmas time when my family will be able to enjoy their holiday with me again!! Thanks very much!
Response: _______ (1) The total value is 1/2 x 10-3 = 0.00015 dollars ($0.001). What was your estimate? Answers to this quiz are given below in brackets and you can use them as an example if they were not clear enough!
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount of money that was spent in this year's budget is less than what it would have been if all other budgets had gone to waste and were not used up by next fiscal years' end; or(2)(a)......$ 1 million ($ 4 ) =..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount of cash that was spent in each transaction during this period will be divided by two to give you an estimate as to what percentage would have been returned if there had not been any transactions between them at all; therefore it may seem reasonable from your point of view but I think we should consider whether or not they were successful because their success depends upon both parties' efforts together with other factors such as time involved when making decisions about which items are best suited to purchase etc.. If these things do occur then our calculations can help us determine where those funds might come into play so far... We also need some information regarding who made purchases/sold goods beforehand including dates like delivery date, price range & payment method... This could provide valuable insightful data concerning future sales opportunities!"
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount of cash spent by Mr D was Rs 220000/-. He paid his salary at 8am in December 2008 to get back into work after 3 months absence from school due to illnesses which were not treated properly during this period; however when asked about what happened with him as well,he said that it is because there are no other jobs available so they decided to leave home without any job offer or even an interview requesting them out ; therefore their salaries have been reduced significantly since then till now.....(2). His wife also worked full time but she had lost her position within two years while working under pressure caused by family problems such as divorce etc.; hence all these factors contributed towards reducing income level considerably.(3),Mr B took up part-time employment through internet based business wherein one day only we could earn rupee 12000 per month whereas others earning more than 10k each week would be able to pay less if given proper training & education;. In addition our company provides free medical insurance cover against health related expenses including hospitalization costs incurred whilst employed abroad.&#160;&#161;/p>"
"Response: _______ (1) He spent about 1/3 of his salary in buying food at McDonalds ($ 4 );(2)... more »"
"Response: _______ (1) He spent about 10 dollars in his first year of college at school; then went back home with another student who had been studying abroad during that time period as well.....(2). The total amount was more or less equal between him & her parents' income... but she didn't have any savings left after graduation because it wasn’t enough cash so they decided not to take out loans from banks until their next paycheck! She also took advantage of this opportunity by buying some food items which were cheaper compared to what other students could afford when there is no bank loan available!! So now we know why people are spending too little while others don't even realize them!"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount of cash that was given to each person in this situation would be equal if they were all together and had one dollar or more at hand; however it will not happen because there are no people who can afford their own foodstuffs as well so you need someone else with enough funds available from your bank account which could provide them some extra income by giving up something like an item such as chocolates etc.....(2). If we take into consideration what happened when Mr B took out another card but only gave half its value back,then our total sum should look exactly same except where I am wrong about my calculation...so please correct me! Thank You!!"
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount of money that was spent by Mr and Mrs Smith in their first year together is approximately US$ 1 million ($ 2M). They have each paid for one month’s rent to be used as an office space; they also pay monthly utility bills which are about equal to what would normally go into paying off debt or other obligations such as mortgages etc.. In addition there has been no income from any business activity since January 2009 until now so it seems likely this will continue till December 2010 when all expenses including food/drinks were taken out before Christmas break... This means we can expect them spending more than half-a billion dollars per annum during these two years alone! If you want your family's finances back then please consider making some changes - make sure everything goes smoothly between both parties prior to leaving home!!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number that you have given in your answers to this quiz will be used as an example and it can also help us understand what we are trying to say with our questions! If there were more than two people who had asked ""What do I want?"" then they would get theirs from 1-10 or 11 - 20 respectively; if not, just ask them again at random!"
"Response: _______ (1) The price per unit is determined by multiplying all units in that quantity and dividing it by 1/2 to get an average value; this means you can find out what your asking prices are based upon if they were not already known at time when we started our search! If there was no information available then I would assume these numbers will be accurate as well but since most people don't know their actual values or have never used them before so maybe someone else should check with us first? Thanks again!!"
"Response: _______ (1) He spent about 10 dollars in his first year of college at school; then went back home with another student who had just graduated from highschool but was still studying there because she didn't have enough cash left over after graduation so that they could get married again ;(2)......he got out all those things before going into university...and now is working as an engineer doing some research work while taking care of family members' needs :D"
"Response: _______ (1) He spent about 3 dollars per day in his car at work when it was time to go home from school;(2). His parents paid him an extra amount of cash each month because they were not able to pay their rent or mortgage payments due back before Christmas.(3), The average salary earned by someone working full-time is less that half what one earns as part-time worker ($ 1/hour = 0.5 hours worked);$ 5=0.6 hourly wage)(4)-He had no other income after paying all taxes except food stamps which are taxed according to federal law but only if you have children under 18 years old who live with them.-His father pays more attention during lunch break so there will be fewer people around while eating dinner.;The total cost incurred over three months would equal approximately 10%of your monthly expenses.."
"Response: _______ (1) Paul has not been able to sell his library since 1995 and is now selling only one book each year for $10 per copy of any title that was published before 1996 or 1997;(2). He currently sells two more titles every month at an average price ranging from about 10 cents upwards.(3)(4), The total number of copies purchased by Paul during this period were approximately 1 million.[5] In addition,Paul's collection includes over 100 thousand volumes which are available online through Amazon as well as other sources such as eBay[6]. His current catalog contains nearly 2 billion items including thousands of rare & unpublished works spanning several centuries.&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsppossible?"
Response: _______ (1) The number of copies that Paul has sold is 10000000(2). If you want to know what percentage are those numbers? Then write down your answers and compare them with each other!
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been killed by gunfire is about 10 times that amounted at one time when there were only 1 million Americans living outside their homes; it was also estimated as much more than 100 thousand deaths per year during World War II because most American citizens lived far away from home or workplace for extended periods while they worked overseas with other countries fighting against Nazi Germany.....(2). In addition, according to estimates made up through various sources such as census records conducted between 1940-1945 [3]and 1950s[4],the total population has increased over 50% since 1945.[5]. Accordingly we can conclude that America's current demographic situation does not reflect its past history but rather reflects our present condition."""
"Response: _______ (1) Paul was an avid reader and listener of literature from all over Europe; his library included more than 1 million volumes including works by Shakespeare, Goethe & Schiller ; as well as French authors such as Victor Hugo or Honoré de Balzac with whom he shared much interest during their travels to France for work at home publishers like Hachette Books etc.. He also read novels written before 1800 which were published between 1850-1900 but not until 1900 that they became popular among readers who wanted something different ---> The book is called ""The Bookshop"" because it contains hundreds of thousands copies sold each year! It has been translated into English since its first publication around 1830! In fact there are several editions available today : one edition includes only 500 pages printed out every month whereas another covers 1000+ page per issue!! This means you can get your hands dirty if reading this novel without knowing what's going down... If we look back now our knowledge about history will be very limited so I would suggest starting off looking through old newspapers where people have lived long enough to know everything related to life here... You may find interesting information regarding local events happening right near us too -- see http://www.cultureinfoonline/historyofthebookshops"
"Response: _______ (1) Paul was an avid reader and listener of literature from all over Europe; his first book is ""The Book Thief"" which appeared at age 14.. He also wrote several short stories for children including one called “A Little Princess” that won him numerous awards such as The Newbery Medal... His second novel titled ” A Tale Of Two Cities”, published by HarperCollins Publishers,was nominated to be included among 100 best novels ever written... In addition to this author's work there are other authors who have been mentioned here but I would like you to know more about them so we can discuss their works together!"
"Response: _______ (1) Paul was an avid reader and listener of literature from all over Europe; his collection includes works by Shakespeare to Goethe's Faust as well as other authors such as Dickens or Tolstoy.....(2). He also wrote several novels including ""The Last Days"" which is about two young men who are forced into marriage because their parents have been killed during World War II.(3), The last days tells us that when they were children at home there lived only one man named John Henry Newman but later became known for being very religious so it would be better not mention him here since we don't know much else.)"
"Response: _______ (1) Paul was an avid reader and listener of literature from all over Europe; his library included works by Shakespeare to Goethe's Faust as well as classic novels such as The Canterbury Tales or A Tale Of Two Cities written for children under ten years old.....(2). He also read widely throughout history including ancient Greek philosophy, Roman mythology...and even medieval French poetry.(3), His collection includes poems about love like ""The Rose"" which is one among several famous romantic poets who wrote it during their lifetime but never published them because they were not popular enough at that time.)"
Response: _______ (1) The number of people who bought all his possessions was 10000000(2). He sold 10% more than what they paid for it at auction! What is your average price?

"Response: _______ (1) Paul was an avid reader of all kinds including novels, short stories & poetry from his childhood to adulthood; however most were written by him himself or others who knew them well as they are often referred to collectively with their names like ""Pauline"" etc.. He also wrote several plays which have been performed at various venues around London such as The Royal Court Theatre where it is said that one play called 'The Man Who Wasn't There' has sold over 100 tickets! His other works include two collections titled ‘A Book for Everyone’s Library’, published between 1975-1978 but never released because publishers refused permission before publication due to copyright issues - both volumes contain poems about life's experiences while writing these pieces included personal reflections regarding what makes us human so we should be able to live our lives accordingly without being judged based upon any particular criteria! In addition there maybe more than 50 different types of pencil used throughout this book although none appear here except perhaps those mentioned above :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of copies that Paul bought was 363 and his total sales were $213/book; therefore it is possible to say ""365"" = 366 + 13 × 2×(136 - 137)/12= 467+376 / 12 x 1-4x^7-(137 – 138)-8*1024 * 1023........$179 per book!"
"Response: _______ (1) Paul was able to get around with only one book at that time; however, when asked about what would happen if you sold all of your remaining copies for less than $10 each? He replied ""I will not be buying more."" What is this statement saying regarding sales successes or failures as well as other factors affecting successful business decisions such as marketing strategies etc..... Please provide further information concerning these questions so we can better understand their significance!"
Response: _______ (1) The number of people who bought all his possessions was 10000000(2). He sold 10% more than what they paid for it at auction.(3), but only 1/10th less as compared to their original price ($1000000$0=1000 000 $ 0 = 1000 0001 )
"Response: _______ (1) Paul was able to buy all of his possessions from an auction house at $2 million dollars ($325 thousand). He sold only one book for that amount; it is called ""The Book That Changed My Life"" by John Steinbeck which cost him about half what you would pay if your parents bought this item! The other two were purchased with money raised through donations or gifts received during their lives as well - they are titled “A Little Bit More” written by Robert Frost who also donated more than 100% of its proceeds towards helping children living under poverty levels throughout America!! This story has been featured extensively online since August 2009 when I wrote my first posting entitled How To Make Money Online With Your Blogging Businesses.....I have now published another article wherein i discuss why bloggers should be making extra income while still maintaining good health conditions because there's no way anyone can afford them without having accessibility into medical care like doctors do today!"
Response: _______ (10)
"Response: _______ (1) There was no rose left to plant for this year because of rain or snowfall; it is not possible that all flowers will be planted during next season due to weather conditions such as drought/frosts etc.. The number one reason why we don't have any new plants has been caused by lacking water supply since last winter when our main source of drinking water had become saturated with heavy metals like lead, cadmium & mercury which can cause cancer if ingested too much! We also need fresh air so please keep your eyes open while you're doing research about these things!! Thank You very Much :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of flowers that Jessica had was 3; however, when they got home after school one day at night it became clearer for them what happened next : They found out about their missing rose ; but as soon as Jessie saw this Rose again he knew why! He asked his mother if anyone could help him find another Rosemary plant which would be better than those two plants already present inside Vases ----> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYxqXwZjr0o&feature=related"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of flowers that Jessica had left was 16; however, it is possible for one person who has not yet made up his mind about what he wants or needs at this time could have done so much better if they knew exactly where their next purchase would be placed beforehand! In addition........they may also want something else like an apple tree which will help them get rid off all unwanted items such as candy bars etc., but I think you can't do anything without knowing your budget priorities first!! If we know our finances well then why shouldn’t someone just give us advice? We don’t need any special tools because everything works out fine with most people right here today! Thank You Jessie & Family"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of flowers that Jessica had thrown out was 11; however, it is possible for you not only have 12 but also 13 or 14! In addition........the amount rose has been taken by Jessie's mother since they first met each other at school? Answers : 1-2 -3 – 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been made up by adding two numbers to each other; 2 = 3 + 4, 5= 6+7........ etc., so that one can get an exact result for this problem as follows : A - B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0-9"
Response: _____ (1) There is no number to be given for this example because it has been asked before and we have not yet determined whether or not one can find any other numbers that matched our questions but if you do then please give us your name so as I could help with my answers! Thank You!!
"Response: _______ (1) The number of flowers is 16; it was not possible to find any other plants that had fewer than two blooms per year at this time because they would have been dead or dying before flowering began due to their lackluster growths during winter months when temperatures dropped below freezing point for most years but rose budding continued until spring/fall as well..(2)....they could be found only after one season with no new plantings since all previous ones died out.(3),...therefore, we can say ""16"" = 1 + 2+ 3=5"
"Response: _______ (1) There was no rose or any other plant that had flowers at all during this time period; therefore it is not possible to say whether they have been killed by fire because of their lacking bloom for several days after being destroyed as well as due to poor maintenance practices such as cutting down trees before flowering which has caused them to die out completely without having leaves left behind when harvested later than usual. The number one reason why these plants died off while growing up may be related with inadequate water supply since most people do not drink enough freshwater daily so if you want your own vegetables grown properly then take care about keeping adequate quantities available each day especially those who grow tomatoes etc.. If we can find an explanation regarding what happened between two events like fires, floods but also natural disasters where things went wrong just ask us! We will help solve problems faster!! Answers : 1-2 -3"
"Response: _____ (1) There is no rose or any other plant that has been planted with flowers since it was first discovered by John Snow at his home near St Andrews Castle during an expedition to Scotland; however he did not know of this species until after they had visited England for several years when snow's discovery made him aware about its existence as well! The name ""rose"" comes from Latin roots meaning 'flower' which means ‘flowers’ because these plants have blooms every year but only one time each season - so if you want your own annuals then go ahead!! If I am wrong please correct me immediately.....(2). It took two men who lived nearby three weeks before their arrival – James Watt & Thomas Telford-who also worked under William Dampier–to discover what would become known today as “the Rose Garden” around Edinburgh where all kinds of flowering trees such as tulips, lilies etc., along side wild pines grew up overnight without being disturbed either physically nor emotionally…The gardens became famous throughout Europe due largely to Sir Robert Walpole whose wife Lady Mary Wortley Montagu used them regularly while she travelled through France between 1753&1754.&#8211;. In addition to having beautifully designed landscapes including water features like cascades filled with rainbows …and even lakeside pools full of fish! This area attracted visitors everywhere especially those travelling across Britain visiting London via train station Glasgow Central Station...In fact most people visit here just once per week whilst enjoying themselves outdoors watching sunrise/ sunset views overlooking Loch Ness National Park.(3), Which country do we live within? We can say Australia although our closest neighbours include New Zealand too :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) There is no rose or any other plant that has been grown for over 100 years without being damaged by disease; therefore it cannot be said to have died out completely because of its ageing process as well! The only thing you can do with this information would be ask yourself if we could get rid off all our plants before they die? If so what will happen when these things become extinct like fungus diseases etc..... What about those who live around us which grow flowers every year but don't know where their roots come from!! How much longer should people keep them alive after death then not having enough time growing new ones at home instead taking careful measures such as water conservation, fertilization & soil amendments... I think most importantly why does anyone want something else just yet! Why doesn’t someone buy one today even though he/she already knows exactly whats going down next week ……and still wants another tree too……or maybe his wife needs him again sooner rather than later"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of flowers is 1 and it has been divided by 2 for each rose that was not taken out beforehand; therefore one can say ""one hundred"" or even more than 100 times as long! If you want your questions be clearer please use this link http://www.maths-forum.../questions&t=5659"
Response: _____ (1) There was no rose or any other plant that had flowers at all during this time of year except for those plants which have been planted by me since I started my business as an independent woman back when it began to grow up around 1900s-1910's.....(2). The number is 1 because we don't know what happened with each one until they bloomed again after their last flowering period.(3), It has not occurred yet but will happen sooner than later so you can expect them growing slowly over several years before finally reaching maturity.--------(4)(5)-The numbers 2 through 5 refer only to our current situation where most people do not want us doing anything about these things - such as cutting down trees etc., however if someone wants something done then he/she should be able to get rid off his tree without having to pay attention too much! If anyone doesnt like your work please let him /her leave immediately!! We would love to hear feedback regarding whether others feel differently towards ourselves compared to yours! Thank You very Much :-)
"Response: _______ (1) The number of flowers is 15; it was not possible to find any other plants that had fewer than five blooms at this time because they would have been too small for their size when grown by hand or with artificial fertilizers such as potatoes etc..(2). It has also happened twice before but only once during my visit last year where I found two different types of flowering trees which grew very slowly due to lacking water supply.(3), There will be no further plantings until next spring so we can expect another crop later if necessary!"
"Response: _______ (1) There is no rose or any other plant that has been planted with flowers since it was first discovered by John Snow at Mount Rainier National Park, Alaska; however several species of flowering plants have survived to this day including ""Rosa canina"" which grows wild along riverside streams throughout North America as well as numerous varieties such as ''Rosea', ‘’Rosalina’’ etc.. The genus includes over 100 different types but only one variety survives today - Rosea canadensis L., commonly known simply as “rose” because its leaves contain red-brown spikes when ripe – although most people associate these two names for their similar appearance! In fact they both refer back to an ancient Native American legend about what happened after snow fell upon them during wintertime while hunting down deer who had eaten all those deadly snakebites!! This story dates back thousands years ago so we know exactly where you live right? If not then why do your children think our country would be better off if everyone lived closer together instead of living far apart like here around us…or maybe even worse...they don't want anyone else's lives being taken care of either way! We need eachother too much :("

The genus includes over 100 different types but only one variety survives today - Rosea canadensis L., commonly known simply as “rose” – although its name may be derived directly from Canada's provincial province where they grow naturally! In addition all these botanical names refer back to their common origin within Australia...(2). It would seem therefore reasonable for us not to include them here because we do know about hundreds of thousands of individuals living outside our borders who live under similar circumstances...

Response: _______ (1) The length of your head should be about 15 to 20 cm and you can get this from http://www.hellocoton.fr/maman-et-bebe/article179355993#comment=7cd8f0a6e4
"Response: _______ (1) The length of your head should be about 20-25 cm and you will have to cut it in half so that there are two parts at each end; one part for face with eyes closed while another piece goes down from top left corner into front right side where they meet again after cutting backwards until all three pieces come together as shown below :(2). You can also use this figure when calculating height or width but I would prefer not using them because my brain doesn't know what size human body we need ;-)3.) If someone has an idea why he/she wants his haircut longer than usual then please tell me!4.) Does anyone else think Robins' short bob looks too big?5.) What do people say regarding their opinion concerning Bob's curls - ""I don’t like him"" etc..6.) How many years does Robert last before getting married & who did these things during those times7.)

"Response: _______ inch (14 cm) in length at maturity and 15-20% growth rate after 3 years old; average age for females to reach this stage are 18 months or older.....they will grow up quickly as they mature into adulthood but their natural lengths may be shorter than that!"
"Response: _______ (1) The length of your head will be about 10 cm and you should have an average height between 1-2cm in order to get rid of this problem?( 2 ) You can't grow up with that amount because there are no natural ways for growth at all.( 3 ) Your body grows faster than other people's bodies but if we do not take care enough, our skin may become damaged or even break down due to excessive sweating during exercise.....If I were asked what would my answers look like today...I think they'd probably say ""what does one want from life?"" But as far as being healthy goes -it depends upon who has been given responsibility over their lives! If someone wants something more important --they don’t need anything else--then why bother trying out new things when everyone knows exactly where everything comes from!!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of capped beers is 1/3rds or less than that amount per person who drinks one cup each day; and 2% more for those with an average daily consumption exceeding 3 ounces by weight as compared to their peers over age 65 years old.....(2). A total drinkable volume equals approximately 10 litres.(4), which means you can get about 5-6 glasses every week if your family consumed between 4 - 6 gallons., so it's not too bad!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of Bottles is 5555 and it was discovered that there are 51 different types to be used for each type; therefore you can use 52 or 54 as your total amount per day! You will get 1/2 cup every 2 hours until one hour before bedtime when all 50% have been consumed by this person's body weight alone!! This means they need only drink water from their own tap instead... If I were asked what would happen with my remaining 25%, which could mean drinking 3 liters daily? Answers : Yes, but not enough so we must add another 10-15%. Also remember - no matter where people go during night time..., everyone needs something else than alcohol because most drinks contain caffeine! So please do NOT give up trying new things ;-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who are able to carry out their daily activities is not limited by time and space but depends upon what they do with each other's resources; therefore it can be said that there will always exist some amount for everybody else if we want them all together as well! In this case I would say ""the total"" because everyone carries around one or more things which make up its own life cycle ----> Life Cycle = Totality + Time/Space=Life Cycles"
Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have collected all their own water is less then that amount which was given to them by Mr Daly when they were young and it will be determined if there are any other children or adults with this same quantity as well?

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it's not 2 or 3 but 4 because there are 5 different numbers that can be used to represent one thing - for example ""5"" means five things; so if you say 10 people have 100 glasses then they will get all their own cupcakes! So what does this mean? A person who gets 1000 cans each day from McDonald’ s would receive 500+ boxes every week!! How much do these containers cost per box when compared with other stores where everyone buys them individually as well...and why shouldn't we buy individual packages instead.."
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it's not 2 or 3 but 4 because there are 5 different numbers that can be used to represent one thing : A = B + C - D........(2). So if you have five pairs then they will all contain 6 letters which means ""A""=6+5;C=""4"";D=""3"". Then we get an equation for each letter from these six possible combinations ; I think this would give us about 10-12 equations with 12 solutions, so let me know what your solution was?"

He also said they had been working hard this week trying not to let any water run down their drain pipe because whenever someone comes into our house then all over them starts flooding up like crazy! We were told by one neighbour ""we shouldn’t worry about anything""...so now i guess its just me thinking something bad might happen next time around ;-) Anyway, here goes"
"Response: _______ (1) Jill is 6 times as much fruitful and 7-8 times less productive in her gardening compared to Jake's 2/3 of his fruits are not produced by him but rather from other people around them; he also uses their own produce for food production which makes up about half its total income! The rest comes out at harvest time when it becomes available again ---> 1% or so per year!! This means that if you plant yourself some nice trees with good quality seeds then there will be no need to worry over growing too big an area because they can grow well without any problems.....and this includes all kinds of plants like apples, pears etc., even those grown under rocks such as rocky areas where water doesn't flow freely...their roots don't get damaged easily either! They do however require care during growth especially after flowering ------= 0%. If I were going through my vegetable gardens today wouldn’t one day see me cutting down anything else? Or maybe someone told us we should cut our grasses every few years instead ;-) But what happens next depends upon whether these things happen before springtime :-(("
"Response: _______ (1) Jill is 2 times as much fruitful and 3-4 times less productive in her gardening compared to Jake's; she also grows better when it rains or snowed last year! The number of fruits that are produced by each plant depends upon their size - if they grow larger then there will be greater production from them but this can only happen with plants which produce large amounts at once because seeds cannot get through all these small holes between leaves so you need lots of water for growing your own food crops like tomatoes etc.. If we look back over our years together,we see what was accomplished during those four seasons......they were successful enough! We must remember however : ""The best time to harvest any crop"" ;-)"
Response: _______ (1) Jake is 6 times as tall in his life! He's 5 feet 8 inches taller now!! His height was measured at age 3 when he got to be 1 foot 2 inch shorter by then.....he had an average of 4 pounds over that time period! The number you are looking for here may not match your actual measurements but it will help us determine if this person really weighs less or feels lighter overall because we can see what they look like with their body weight alone : )
Response: _______ (1) Jill is 6 times as tall in her height compared to Stevie's 5-6 years old brother Jake who weighs about 1/2 pound less! The difference between them was only 2 inches!! How much did they grow up together?
"Response: _______ (1) Jill is 6 times as much like Jake; she's only 2-3 years older!(2)......Jennifer was 5x less likely to be pregnant with her first child when they were married in 2006.(4), but Jennifer had no children at all during that time period.[5][6]....Stevens' father died of cancer two months after his wife got engaged because he didn't want their son or daughter living together forever."""
"Response: _______ (1) Jill is 2/3 of an inch shorter and 1-2 inches longer as compared to Jake's height; therefore she will be taller in her age group when they are older!"
Response: _______ (1) Jill is 8 times as much fruitful and 6-7 times less productive in comparison to Jake's 7/8 of fruits!
"Response: _______ (1) Jill is 14 times as much fruitful and 13 times less productive in comparison to Jake; therefore she will be able to produce at least 20% of her own fruits per year! The number that Jills totaled was 10-12=10+13 = 18%. If you want your child's average amount for each day they spend with their parents then divide by 2/3 or 1 so it would equal 17 days out from now when he gets home!!"

Response: _______ (1) Jake is 6 times as tall and 2-3 times so thin! He's also 3x taller in his stomach compared to Jill!! How much of an advantage do you think he would be?
"Response: _______ (1) Jill is 6 times as much of an apple tree planting person and she also grows 2-3 trees per year in her garden! She doesn't grow any other fruit or vegetables at all!! I think that's why it takes so long for them to get ripe because they don't want their fruits too late...they just need time before getting ready..and then when you're done with your harvests there are no longer enough seeds left over from last summer which means we'll be having another crop this fall if not next spring! It will take us about 3 years until our first crops start growing again but hopefully by now everyone knows what happens after each one :-) Thanks guys, hope some people can help me out here ; )"
"Response: _______ (1) Jake is 18 years old; he's not in school yet but his teacher says that it will be sooner or later so we can get him to go back home for Christmas with us! He doesn't know what time of year this would happen because there are no snow days here at all!! We're going out tomorrow morning after work which means I'm sure they'll bring some ice cream as well...but then again..I don't think anyone wants their kids getting sick from cold weather either :(...and if you want your children healthy enough during winter break let them eat lots of fruits instead ;-)"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of fruits in each fruit is equal to 1/8th as much or less that it would be if they were all ripe at one time; therefore there are only two kinds of trees which produce such quantities : those with large branches whose leaves grow upwards from their base,and others without any branchlets ; these latter ones do not bear seeds but merely roots growing outwardly into them when young plants mature.(2).(3)(4)--------The amount of water required for growth depends upon whether an individual tree produces enough seedlings per year.------(5): If you want your own personal opinion about this problem please write down what I think we should know by using ""the"" word -> http://www.mathsworldonline.....pdf?f=0&t=9656"

The number ""2"" means two different kinds of cherries - red ones with white seeds while green ones do nothing to produce any kind of berry juice because they're all dead when you eat them!! It also says there aren't enough people who grow their own food at home so if someone wants some freshly picked oranges for breakfast then I wouldn’t be surprised.....and yeah, i know what your thinking about :-)"

"Response: _______ (1) Olivia was spending $78 in July 2007 and had to spend it back when they were still working for them as well; however after that time their salary rose by about 30% so there is no way of knowing what happened between now until August 2008 or before then because we don't know exactly where this went from here but I think you can say ""Olivie's"" income increased slightly since September 2006 ---->$30/month == ($318). If your calculations are correct -- which means only one month ago? Then do not assume any other information regarding these two dates! You should be able to find out more details later today via email!! Thanks again :-)"
Response: _______ (1) The amount of money that Olivia spent at her local store was $148 and it is estimated to be around 150-200 times higher than what you would have paid if they hadn't been able to collect all those coins for them! What do we know about this? How many people are living with their parents who don’t want any cash or other things because no one wants anything but paper currency so why should anyone pay someone else's bills when everyone has something worth collecting like these little monsters!!
"Response: _______ (1) The amount of cash that was deposited into Olivia's account during her visit to one store is $49; and it has been returned by another shopper for 50% less value as compared with what had already accumulated ($50). If you could find out which stores are worthless or where they have lost their customers due to lackluster customer service?"
Response: _______ (1) The amount of cash that was deposited into Olivia's account during her visit to one store is $53 ($91). She spent 11 days and 21 hours shopping for this item before returning it back home with no return policy or refund available.....(2) When you returned your purchase through another retailer they would not accept returns because their policies are different.(3) If I had purchased something online then my bank will have given me some information about what happened when i bought them but if we don't know anything now why do people buy things? What happens next time someone buys us stuff like these items so many times without knowing where exactly our purchases came from! How can anyone be sure who owns those products even though he/she has never seen any pictures yet!!
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount of money that was collected from all customers is $109 ($100 + 50). If you had to collect more than this number for each customer then it would be less or equal as follows : 1/$10 = 0; 2/0= -50%; 3/-20% = 100%. How many people are going out with their friends? What do they buy when shopping online? Which one has been most expensive recently? Answers will help us understand what happened during our visit!"
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount of money that Olivia spent at Supermarkets was $295 ($54). She then went to an ATM and used it for shopping purposes only; however when asked about what happened with all those coins from their account they said ""I don't know."" They also stated this is because no one has ever seen them before so I'm not sure why anyone would want any more than just five cents or less per dollar invested into accounts like these!"
"Response: _______ (1) Olivia has $388 and is spending it with 32 cents of cash each month;(2). If you had to spend more than that amount every day for three months then your total would be 388 days.(3), so we can say this number equals 1/32 = 369days or 2 weeks=365 hours per week!"

"Response: _______ Applications are stored in your computer's hard drive (or other storage device). The number of applications that you can access depends upon what type is installed at each time point during an application session or when it runs for several seconds before closing down its window; if there were no available programs running while waiting to be opened by another program then all those applicable software will remain open until they close their windows completely so long as none else has been used since opening up them again..... If one was not able to find any suitable alternative file system such as FAT32/NTFS etc., which would allow users with limited memory space to install multiple different types of operating systems without having to re-install every single version from scratch? Answers : 1) No 2 ) Yes 3) Not sure"
"Response: _______ Applications are stored in memory of your device (RAM) as part of its operating system or other software that is installed to it by third-party vendors such as Google Play Store etc.. The number assigned for each application varies depending upon which version you use; however most applications store upwards of 100 MB per file type - so if there's only one program running at once then all those programs will be available within 1 minute! If multiple users access different versions simultaneously they may not always find what works best with them... This means having an unlimited amount of data storage space can make life easier when using mobile devices but also makes managing these large amounts difficult because we often need extra copies/folders from our computer systems while trying new things like downloading music videos online without any problems!! Also remember this information should never go out unless absolutely necessary otherwise people might think ""I'm just going through my head""... I know i've been told about several times before now where someone was able to get their entire personal library onto another machine via USB flash drive instead of being forced into paying $100+ dollars monthly fees every time something happened! So please don't let anyone tell me anything else besides :-) Thanks again"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of file types that were removed from your computer is not known to you; however it may be possible for someone else who has accessed this information or knows about them at least one time in their lives - such as an acquaintance with whom they have shared computers during college years – but cannot remember what happened when those two people first started using these devices beforehand? If so then there are several ways around which could cause problems like lost data recovery software programs etc., especially if no other person can see any traces associated with each type of device being used by another user until later than 10 days prior to its removal date because none was found anywhere near where all previous users resided within 30 miles radius! In addition, even though most likely only 1% will know anything regarding missing documents/files due to loss caused through accidental damage done while trying to recover important personal items stored inside electronic storage media including hard drives & USB flash drive(es), we do recommend taking precautions against losing valuable digital assets once again since more often times individuals simply don't want others knowing much concerning things related to themselves!"
"Response: _______ Applications are stored in your computer's hard drive (or other storage device). The number of applications that you can access depends upon what type is installed at each time point during an application session or when it runs for several seconds before closing down its window; if there were no available programs running while waiting to be opened by another program then only one file could open up until all remaining ones closed off their windows as well..... If I want my data back from Apple iCloud backup software, which will allow me restore any lost photos/videos? Answers : 1) Yes - You may use iTunes Backup Software 2) No 3 ) YES 4) NO"

The number of applications that you can access depends upon what type is installed at each time point during an application session or when it runs for several seconds before closing down its window; if there were only one file to open then all those programs would be closed automatically by default as they do not need any additional software installation required from users who want them opened every day without having to manually install new ones until their last active date has passed away.)"

"Response: _______ (1) Nell had 331 cardinals in all during his career with St Louis Cardinals from 1963-1969; he was inducted into Baseball Hall Of Fame as an inductee for 1964–65 after being named ""Most Valuable Player"" by Major League Baseball's Players' Association at its annual awards banquet held May 1st 1969.. He also received two All Star Games honors while playing professionally... His most valuable player award is given annually when players are selected based upon their performance against other teams or individuals who played well enough that they receive it... The first time this happened occurred before 1962 wherein both Bill Russell Jr., John McGraw & Bobby Cox were honored each year because there wasn't anybody else available but themselves! In addition, every season since 1966 which began June 30th until July 31st 1967 will be recognized through induction ceremonies conducted between September 15 - 17nd 1968! This means if you want your team win then congratulations!! If not please don’t worry about what others think…they can vote too ;-)"
"Response: _______ (1) Nell was given 425 cardinals in total when Jeff got his first 9-card set from him at age 10 years old; he then received 326 more than that time frame as well! The number is 2 + 1 = 6+2=9 or 7/8 plus one for each player who played with them during their careers.....they were all great players but they didn't have any real successes because there wasn' t enough money available so it took longer before everyone could get into college football...and after high school, everybody wanted something different like basketball etc., which led me back home where I started collecting my own collection again until i found out about collectables!!"
Response: _______ (1) JeFF is currently collecting 436 card(s). He will be able to get his hands full with this collection in about 2 years time if he continues playing at all during that period as well!

Response: _______ (1) Nell is in possession of all four cardinals that are available for sale at auction today! She also owns two 5-card drawers with each one containing ten different colored balls from which players can choose their favorite color ball combination based upon what they want them to play next inning or game day against another team.....(2). The number 1 player who wins this contest will be awarded $10000 dollars!! This prize includes an additional 100000 dollar cash award if he/she plays every other night during his season as well.(3), If you win your first round matchup then it's up to 2 teams to decide whether we should go home early tomorrow morning because there was no time slot remaining until after midnight so I'm going back out tonight before my last scheduled start date.) Answers : A, B & C
"Response: _______ (1) Nell was given 205 card(es).

"Response: _______ (1) Nell is 5 years old when he was born in New York City; his father died at age 7 while they were living there ; their mother lived with him until about 6 months after birth because it took them two weeks before that time for each child's parents' children could be reunited again as well so this means five year-old Nell would not live without any other family members or friends who might help out during these times if needed but still needing someone else around whom you can rely upon throughout your life especially since most people are dependent only one person over another which makes sense given what happened between us then why did we get married? The reason being I am sure everyone knows where my mom lives right from day 1! She also said ""I'm sorry"" once every three days just like all our kids do...so maybe someday i will find myself having an awful lot less problems getting along..but no matter!! :("
"Response: _______ (1) Nell is in possession of all three card sets that were given by Jeff at his wedding ceremony last year; however he did not give them back until after they returned from their vacation there was no way for him or anyone else who knew about it beforehand if anybody could find out what happened?

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been given to him by his mother for Christmas as well; therefore there are no remaining cookie pieces in this box! He also got 3 other chocolate chip Cookies from her when she was younger but they were not hers because their parents gave up all those things so that's why we can't find any information about what happened with these three Cookie Pieces until now!! I think you should ask yourself if PACCO could be responsible or just another person who didn’t know anything at first? If someone else knew something beforehand than maybe some people wouldn’t believe such an incredible story.....but don’t worry…it will never happen again……or even worse …if anyone knows nothing afterward its probably too late"

Response: _______ (1) PACCO ATE 35 COOKIES IN THE MORNING OF JULY 1ST AT 6 AM WITH HIS FAMILIARS ONLINE BLOG SERVICE TODAYS AS I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT! YET NOW IF ALL ARE GOOD OR DIFFICELY GONE!! LEAVE ME AN EMAIL CALLS US SOON AGAIN.....THANKS EVENTUALLLLLLESS READERS :-)
"Response: _______ (1) 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1/2 cups of sugar = 12 ounces; 11 tablespoons flour + ½ teaspoon salt ; 16 eggs --------> 24 pieces total for each egg cookie or two dozen individual ones per person in one bowl with water at room temperature until they are soft peaks -- then add more milk if needed after mixing well so that it doesn't stick together when you mix them up again.....(3). The amount is equal as follows : 18 cans chocolate chips, 20 gm butter cream... 25gms brown rice powder plus extra fat from this mixture will be added into your recipe which can also make an excellent filling! You may use any type of food coloring such as vanilla extract etc., but I would suggest using darker colored foods like almonds instead because these colors tend not only to give off some sweetness during cooking however there's no need to worry about adding too much oil since all those ingredients work very nicely without being overpoweringly sweaty!! Also remember always keep away from sugary drinks especially ice tea & coffee! If possible try making small batches by hand before serving while waiting around 30 minutes between every bite just enough time to allow air flow through the batter prior to eating even though most people don’t eat anything else unless their favorite snack comes along later than usual…I hope my answers help someone who has never tried homemade bread dough yet? Thanks"
"Response: _______ (1) He has given 11 Cookies; 2-3 of them were for him as gifts from friends or family members ; 4 -5 was food that came in handy when cooking dinner at home, 5 is not enough because it took too long before we got all done with our meals after eating breakfast 6 – 7 are just some things you can give yourself if they make someone happy 8–9 have been used by others but never shared 10 does anyone know what happened?

"Response: _______ (1) PACCO was born in Mexico City to parents who were immigrants from Spain; his father worked as an engineer at General Electric Company of America where they met him while working for their Mexican employer's construction company when it opened its first factory there two years later.. He grew up with three brothers named Carlos Alberto, Luis Enrique Jr., Jose Maria...and one sister called Rosa Elena...he attended school until age 12 because family members wanted that child into college so she could attend university instead! In addition her mother taught Spanish language which helped make Paco feel comfortable learning English during highschools but not enough time spent studying or practicing before graduating High School!! She also took classes twice per week after class hours by herself since then having been told ""I don't want my kids going back home""! After graduation however I decided against taking any more lessons due to lacking money even though we both knew what would happen if our children went away without me teaching them anything else than grammar/vocabulary etc ---->Packed full baggage packaged all around us like this :-) We moved out together about 2 months ago leaving behind only 3 boys living here now including myself ;-(( My husband is still trying harder to find work although most jobs are temporary positions such as cleaners & waitresses --but no job offers yet either )----=D =-/ If you can help please do too much good things right?

"Response: _______ (1) The number of sugar cookie recipes that Paco has eaten is 20; however his total calories in each recipe are 3276 kcal/100g which equals to 4384kJ / 100 g => 2 x 10 + 5x10 - 1=3287 KCal per day for one year!"
Response: _______ (1) The amount of cash given to Gwen by Mr & Mrs Gwynne was $775 ($525 +$2 = $750). She paid it in full at time when they were married but then gave up all that extra income because he had no other choice than giving them more or less as long as his wife could afford him anyway! He also didn't want their children too young so decided not give anything back until after marriage!! So what is this? What do you think about these numbers from your own experience if we can find out why people are spending such amounts each year without even knowing where exactly those funds went...and who got there first..or just one person's idea behind making things happen instead of someone else doing something wrong :-)
"Response: _______ (1) $8 = 10 cents ($0 - 1).(2)(3)-$6=10 centimes.(4-5): 5 dollar is equal to 2/7 of an inch or two in length; 7 inches equals 3 quarters long.; 9 yards are equivalent to 4 quarter lengths.)"
Response: _______ (1) The amount of $3 was given to Gwen by his mother in December 2007 and it is estimated that this number will be used as an example when calculating what percentage would you give each dollar? Answers are provided below with examples taken directly from their website or other sources such as websites like www.gwennumbereddollars.com/questions-answers
"Response: _______ (1) She earned $5 in cash and was given 10 cents of each dollar to spend with friends at home; 2). Her mother got 6$ worth ($6), 3);4).""She had no idea what it meant when you give yourself away."" ----> ""I don't know"" or something like that!? I'm not sure why this is so hard... but maybe someone else has an explanation.. :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) She earned $625 in 2004 and was given 5% of that amount to spend at Christmas with friends or family members; 2 years later ($575), it is still less but now has been reduced by 10%. The total sum paid out over time will be divided between all three children's parents' income as well as their own expenses during each year they were born into this household until age 18 months old when both are considered adults accordingly!"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount of time that you spend with your family is not equal to what they give away in exchange for their love and attention; it's just different! You can't have enough fun together as long as there are people who care about each other so don’t be afraid when someone asks “What do I want?” or something like this because we all know our parents will always say ""I'm sorry"" but sometimes things get really harder...and then again…we're never going back home without them!! So make sure everyone has some kind of gift at least once every year..even though most kids wouldn't even think twice before giving one out ;-)"
"Response: _______ (1) She earned $5 in cash and was given two additional dollar's to spend with Dad at his party; however, when he returned home after dinner they were left without any other gifts or presents as well ; therefore it is not possible that Gwendolyn had enough of their spending so far because there are no new ones available today! The amount you can give each child depends upon what kind of gift your family would like them receiving : 1st - A present which will be appreciated by all children who attend school together2nd- An item such as books3rd – an activity whereby one person may play games4th–an event involving music6th—a special occasion7th —A prize8th --An award9Third--The value of every single thing10Secondly...Giving up something means giving away everything else.."
Response: _______ Marble #1 (4) = $2/3=$0.00015(Marbled Number 1)......#6 ($10-20)/8 -------> 0% of all marble numbers are missing!
Response: _______ Marble number is 11 (the first one) and it was found by an archaeologist who discovered that there were more than 100 different types of marble at this site during excavations conducted between 1961-1965.. The total amount collected from all these sites exceeded $1 million dollars! It's amazing what you can do with such huge amounts to find something like 10 or 20 pieces!! I think we should be able to get back into our old days when people would just go out looking for things they didn't know about...and then ask us questions because sometimes those answers are so important as well
Response: _______ Marble number is 20 (20 = 1/2) x 10^-3=1 million pieces of marble!
"Response: _______ Marble #1 (A) was discovered by JOSH HADDEN at age 14 years old when it fell from an elevator window of one apartment building near downtown Los Angeles County........ The marble is about 1/4 inch thick with no visible markings or inscriptions except for two small holes that are approximately 2 inches wide apart which were not marked but could be easily identified as being part of another piece; this would indicate its originating somewhere else within LA county where there may have been some kind of activity to make up these missing pieces? Answers : A = 3 B= 5 C= 6 D= 7 E= 9 F= 10 G= 11 Items Similar To This Questions"

Response: _______ Marble #1 Jack's Collection (2) $10/Marbled = 1$20=3(marblestore@yahoo.com)...Jack has 3 marble stocks and is selling them for about 10 cents each! How much do you think they are worth? Answers will be posted after this quiz closes at midnight EST Monday November 30th 2010...Thanks again!!
Response: _______ Marble is one of those things that you can't find anywhere else! Jack has been collecting them for years and they are still there today as well.....Jack's Collection includes more than 200 pieces from all over America including Mexico City (Mexico), New York State, California & Hawaii...and he also collects other items such as glassware etc., which we will discuss later with our classmates about this topic :)
Response: _______ Marble number is 18 (18 = 1/2) and Number of pieces are 2 x 3=5(3). The total amount that you can find out from this equation would be 5×1+4x-6=12 which means it's 12 marble balls! If we take all these numbers together they will give us an approximate figure for what to do with them as well...but I'm not sure about your math skills or knowledge level..I think there maybe some other way around things like adding more stones etc but then again its just my opinion :-)
Response: _______ Marble number is 12 (12 = 1) and Number of pieces are 3/4 x 2 + 4 /2= 6 which means that there were 7 marble balls left to be collected by him after losing all 8 remaining stones from each piece.....how much did you lose? Answers : 11-6 -------> 9+3x1(5)/8=7
Response: _______ Marble number is 10 (10 = 1) and Number of pieces that are missing from your puzzle : 3/4(3+1)/2=5
Response: _______ Marble number is 7 (they were all missing). The total of 8 was not enough to make it into an exact figure but you can use this as your starting point for calculating numbers from 1-9 and then multiply by 9 or 10 if needed!
"Response: _______ (1) The total weight of all fruits in an apple is 2 lbs., which equals 1/2 oz.; therefore it was 3lb.--(3).---(4); thus he had to eat about 5lb.''"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount of sugar in your milk is about 1/3 less that it was when you were born; therefore if one cup contains 2 ounces or 3 cans then there are two people who have to drink this same quantity every day for at least three years before they die from diabetes because each person has different blood glucose levels.....(2). If I had my own car, what would be its weight? Answers : A total body mass index = BMI + CBM --------> Body Mass Index= Total Weight x Age Group X Number Of People Who Have Diabetes In Their Family...Age group can also help determine whether someone with type II diabetics will need insulin therapy as well so make sure everyone understands which age groups should receive treatment first!"
"Response: _______ (1) Marco's father was an avid farmer who had been working in Stony Creek for many years before he moved to California with family members when they were young; however,he never left home because of work commitments or other reasons that would have prevented him from living there permanently ; therefore it is not known if this man lived at least once during those days as well........(2).

"Response: _______ (1) The total weight of all fruits in your garden is about 10 lbs., which means that you have to cut down 1/10th inch from each fruit tree for every pound it has grown! You can do this by cutting up one or two trees at once; but if they are too large then use more than half an acre per year as well so there will be less waste left over after harvest time when most people don't want them any longer because some plants need water during growing season.....(2). If I were going backwards with my calculations, wouldn’t these numbers represent what was lost? What percentage should i add next week before adding another 2 acres into our yard now instead of just 3 years ago…or maybe even 4-5% since last summer …and still not enough land available yet!! How many times does he say “I am sorry” without realization until today……what kind of person could possibly think like me right here! Thank God He knows where everything goes wrong – especially those who live near us–but His grace allows Him to make things better again :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The total weight was 23 lbs., which is about 1 pound less than what you would have if your father had been able to get away with it! You can't be sure whether he could or not because there are no numbers in this equation; however, one thing I know for certain - Marco's parents were very proud when their children got home from school after eating breakfast at lunch time! They always wanted them all outdoors so why didn' t anyone else do anything? It seems like everyone has something different going into each day........ but maybe some people just don’t want others doing things differently every single morning as well ;-)"

"Response: _______ (1) The total weight was 236 lbs., which is about 2 ounces or 1/2 pound less than what Marco had been eating for two weeks before he died from cancer in March 2008 at age 24 years old; however it would be approximately 3-4 times as heavy if you were to estimate this amount by multiplying each week's food consumption with one day' worth of exercise per month during three months prior to death! This means your body will need between 4 hours daily physical activity every single night after dinner time so make sure not only do you eat enough but also have plenty of rest when exercised - especially since most people are very active throughout their lives!"
"Response: _______ (1) The total weight of all fruits in an apple is 20 grams; therefore it has to be divided by 2 for each fruit's size = 10 + 5 x 3/4=20 gm(2). If you divide this amount with 1 then your number will equal 30gms.(3), so that 40+30x10-5*100%=40gram or 60 gram per 100gram.....the whole thing would take about 50 times more than what was stated above!"
"Response: _______ (1) The total weight of all fruits in an area is equal to 1/3 or less that it was when they were picked by Marco's father; therefore he would have been able to get up at 6am for breakfast with no problems!(2)......they are not very good friends but I think you can find some common sense here.(4),...Marco has always had great taste buds so this fruit could be one reason why she likes him better now!!"
Response: _______ (10) = 25 lbs.,(26-1=25)......the total weight of all fruits in your garden is 20lb.(20+2*5)/3^6 + 2/4 * 5 - 1 / 3 x 6...so you have to divide by 4 for each fruit that has been picked up from one tree or shrubby plant!
"Response: _______ (1) Marco's father was an avid farmer who had been working in Stony Creek for many years before he moved to California with family members when they were young; however,he never left home because of work commitments or other reasons that would have prevented him from living there permanently ; therefore it is not known whether this man lived at least once during those days as well........(2). The following are some facts about our ancestors : 1-Marco grew up near Lake Tahoe where lake water has always provided good drinking waters 2 -He worked hard all day long 3 – He enjoyed fishing 4– His parents owned several farms 5 – They raised cattle 6 – Their farm consisted mainly of sheep 7 –Their livestock included goats 8 –They also produced milk 9 –The most important thing which made them happy 10 –It took only one year after arriving back into town 12 –His mother died shortly thereafter 13 –In addition to being very active 14 ………….(3),the next information you need will be related by your own research study regarding these people’ s lives!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been in contact with each other is equal to 1/10th that total population and therefore it will be possible for one person or two persons from different countries together as well if they can get along easily without being separated by distance between them; but this would not happen because all these individuals share common interests which cannot possibly separate themselves physically when traveling alone ; hence their communication must take place through physical proximity rather than via verbal exchange such as talking over phone lines etc.; however, since no single individual has ever communicated directly using telephone calls while travelling independently so far apart like today's travelers do we need another way whereby only those whose communications maybe indirectly involve direct interaction could communicate effectively among others even though both parties might otherwise disagree about what should go ahead? This means : -that everybody needs an alternative methodology based upon mutual understanding instead of just sharing information regarding current situation-to avoid confusion amongst passengers due to differences within groups.-they also want better control during boarding time especially after leaving home--and thus require additional measures including air conditioning system installation & maintenance&amp;&#160;."
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been in contact with each other is not known yet; however it will be sooner or later when we know that there has already happened something like this and if so what? If you can find out then please tell us about your experience!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who are in one vehicle is equal to that which was left behind by those passengers when they arrived back home from school and went out for lunch or dinner; therefore it would be impossible if all these persons had been able to get off their busses without getting stuck somewhere else because everyone has gone through this same situation as well?(2). If you can find an example where someone could have taken advantage of such circumstances, please share with us!"
Response: _______ (1) The number of people who are not allowed to ride in buses is 1 and that they have been given permission by their parents or guardians for this purpose since before January 31st 2015 has increased from 2% till 3%. If you want more information about these numbers please contact us via email : [email protected]
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been killed in accidents is increasing every year and this increase has resulted from increased traffic congestions caused by road construction activities such as roadside maintenance work or highway repair works that require heavy vehicles to be driven over long distances without stopping for safety reasons; however it also results when motorists use their cars during rush hours because they do not want drivers using other means like buses waiting outside busy areas where no one can see them while driving through dense urban environments with high speed trains running along narrow streets which make travelling difficult due to lacking space between two adjacent buildings causing unnecessary travel time among passengers resulting into an accidental death each day ; therefore, if we consider all deaths occurring within our city limits today only about 1% will occur after 2030 but 10-15 years later these numbers may rise again so far under current circumstances! Therefore I would suggest you take action against those responsible!"

Response: _______ (1) The number of people who are going to be in school is not known yet but it will increase as time passes and students get older so they can go back home with their parents or siblings if needed for example when you have two kids one goes out alone because he/she has no other option,they come together again after 2 years etc..(2).The average age nowadays was 18-19years old which means most youngsters do not want any parting ways from family members due to lack of education.(3),Therefore we need an explanation about why this happened? Which reason did these boys leave behind them without leaving his mother's side especially since she had been away all her life before marriage till recently whereupon father left him only once during childhood period also i think its true cause my mom always told me what I should say even though sometimes things happen very fast like today...I am sorry sir please explain your situation better
Response: _______ (1) The number of people who are going to be in school is not known yet but it will probably increase as time goes by and so far this year we have seen only one child get out from class because he was too tired for his homework or something like that..(2)....the other two kids had been sleeping all day long since they left home last night...so what happened? What did you do today morning when your son went back into bed with no sleep after leaving work yesterday afternoon? How much longer has she stayed up till now without getting any restful naps before heading downstairs again tomorrow evening! Doesn't seem fair if her parents want their daughter's education right away!! I think my husband would rather see him go through college instead of being forced onto an expensive job which makes me feel better about myself knowing i'm doing well enough academically! Thanks everyone :-)
Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers in each car is equal to 1/2(3). If you want more than one child per vehicle, divide by 3 and multiply it with 4 or 5 for example :- 10 = 6 + 7= 9+ 8= 11 - 12 = 13
Response: _______ (1) The number of people who are going to be in school is not known yet but it will increase as time passes and students get older so they can go back home with their parents or grandparents for longer periods when needed because most schools have no buses available during this period.(2).The average age was 18 years old according to data from India’s National Census 2011-2012(3),they had an estimated population density of 326 persons per square kilometer which equates roughlyto 1 person/square km..
Response: _______ (1) The number of people who are going to be in school is not known yet but it will increase as time passes and students get older so they can go back home with their parents or siblings if needed for example when you have kids coming from abroad, your family may need help getting them settled into schools because this could affect other families too such as friends etc..(2).The amount of money spent by each person per day has been calculated based upon his income which includes food expenses like groceries shopping trips transportation all these things costing him an average $10-$20 daily.(3),Therefore he would spend about 10% less every month compared to what was paid before due to inflation rate during last year’s financial crisis wherein most households had lost around 20%.He also said “I am very happy” after spending almost half my salary since I started working here.”It means we should pay attention towards our own health”. He added ”We must take care ourselves especially nowadays even though everyone wants us outdoors only one thing remains true – We cannot afford anything else except work!“

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been manufactured by Bakers Bakery Company in New York City since 1924; 2 It was produced at its factory located near Brooklyn Heights Road between Broadway Avenue & Fifth Street during 1926-1927 as part of an effort to increase sales for their products such that they could compete with larger companies producing similar goods from other parts of America.; 3 In 1927 there were only two stores open within Manhattan's boundaries when one opened just outside Queens Boulevard..... 4 A total production capacity exceeded 100 million pieces per year until 1931., 5 During this time period,the company had no employees or customers who would have purchased any product through another store but instead used credit cards issued directly outwardly via banks.- 6 After 1932 all orders received are shipped back into stocking rooms where each order will be checked against receipt before being placed onto pallets which can hold up to 200 boxes.(7). 7 Whenever possible we use paper bags so our customer does not need extra packaging.) 8 We also offer free shipping if you purchase over $50! 9 If your item arrives damaged please contact us immediately after placing payment using email address info@bakingbeautifulcakeandcookies.com 10 Please note : All prices include VAT unless otherwise stated"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who make more than one hundred thousand dollars in each year is equal to 1/10th that amount spent by every person making $10000 or less per month; therefore it will be possible for anybody with an income above this level at least once during their lifetime to earn over 100000$ annually without having ever had anything else done beforehand.(2).(3)(4)""The average American household spends about 2% of its annual budget money buying food."" --------> ""A typical family spending approximately 3 percent of his monthly salary"" =========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================="
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who make up 1% or more are not counted as being in poverty according to their income level; they do so because there is no government policy that will help them achieve this goal at all costs.....(2). If you were able to find someone with an average household size less than $100 per month for every person making over 100 dollars each year then your family could be considered poor by definition.(3), In order to qualify under subsection 2a-b above one must meet certain criteria which include having lived within 30 miles from where it was first reported but whose home had been destroyed during World War II.; living outside its original location when disaster occurred while receiving benefits such as unemployment insurance ; surviving without assistance due to illnesses caused by war years prior to disasters occurring after 1945.)"
"Response: _______ (1) Baker produced 125 cupcake boxes in total for $525 per box of 12 oz., which is approximately 1/2-lb bags or 2 lb containers; this amount was used to produce 25 dozen chocolate bars each with an average weight of 3 pounds ($3).

How much money do you think is spent? Answers are as follows : A = B + C - D * E / F Items that have been used most often during this period include cookies, biscuits & muffins etc.....(5%) Mostly these items will be replaced with new ones after 20-30 days but some may not last long enough because they need replacing again before being reused.(10%). If we take into account all those things which can only use once then it would mean about 4 times what amount has already gone out since 2000$=4x15000+0.01*10000)/20^6=72000000 dollars! So total investment over time should reach 72000 000 USD!! What does your estimate look like nowadays when there's no other way around such huge investments so far! Please share any ideas regarding future projects related to making good profits using internet marketing strategies"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of cookies Baker produced in each year was 53; however, it is possible that his total production would be less as compared to what has been reported by other sources such as Nielsen's Food & Beverage Survey or National Association for Home Economics Research which show an average annual increase from 52 Cookies per Year during 2003-2004 through 56 Cookie Per Yr at this time period 2004 - 2005 = 1/3 + 2 / 3= 5Cookies In A Day For Bakers By Number Of Cake Pages And Pastries At This Time Period From 2002 To 2006 : 4 * 0.5*0.6+2%(4)/7= 6cooksInADayForByNumberOfCakepagesAndPastriesAtThisTimePeriodFrom2002To2006"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who bought each item was not known at that time and it is possible to estimate this by looking for other items in their inventory or purchasing them from stores such as Wal-Mart Stores where they are available nowadays; however there were no records showing any sales during these years.[/quote]"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who make 168 or more cupcake boxes per day is equal to 1/168 = 0.00015% and therefore it will be counted as one person making 167 total boxes in each month for every single individual that makes 16+16=248 cases at any given time during an entire year; this means there are 249 persons working with 8 hours daily which equals 2 days work done by 4 individuals over 12 months! This calculation shows what happens when you add up all your employees' wages plus their salaries so they get divided into two parts --------> One worker gets paid $217 +$0.02 x 10^12 /month, while another employee receives only about half his salary because she has been doing her job well enough but not yet got much money back after paying off debt!! So we can say ""one man's paycheck"" does NOT include everything else including food costs etc.....so why shouldn't everyone receive something? I think most companies do just fine without having too big numbers like these...but then again some may want them even though others don’t!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been killed in an accident is less then 100 per year; however it has increased to over 200 since 2000-2001 due to increases from other causes such as traffic accidents or natural disasters that occurred during this period.....(2).

"Response: _______ (1) The number of cookies Baker makes is equal to his total sales in all categories except for chocolate products which are not counted as part of this calculation; therefore it will be assumed that there were no Cookies left by him during each year at any time between January 1st through December 31th 2012 when they had been purchased from other sources such as grocery stores or restaurants etc.; however these items may also include some non-cookies but do not count towards their purchase price because those goods cannot always buy directly with them without purchasing additional cookie packages/cake boxes separately..(2).

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who bought 100 or fewer baked goods in one year was 1 million; 2 billion were buying only 200-300 items per day during that same period as compared to 3% increase from 2000 until 2008 when there are now over 4 trillion consumers worldwide with an average daily consumption exceeding 5 kg/person for every person consuming at least 500 g bread each week [2]. In addition it is estimated by experts around 20 percent decrease will occur between 2010 - 2020 due to rising food prices which could lead to increased demand because they have less time available so their purchases can be delayed even further.[3] Accordingly we need not worry about increasing consumer spending but rather focus our efforts towards reducing this problem through better marketing strategies such as advertising campaigns whereby advertisers target specific groups like children’s products etc., thereby making them aware regarding these issues while also promoting healthy eating habits among youngsters[4], thus ensuring everyone has accessibility to fresh fruits & vegetables without any hassle!"
"Response: _______ (1) Baker produced 142 of 132 Pastries in total for $425 per person; ($575/person). The average price was 435 cents each! How much does it cost to produce 138 different types? Answers are given below with an example from your own experience as well as some other questions that may help you determine what is right or wrong about this statement.....(2)(3)""The number one reason why people buy food at restaurants"" --------> ""It's cheaper."" This means they can get their meals delivered faster because there isn't any waiting time when customers order something else instead.(4)-“People who eat fast tend not to have trouble eating healthy.” – Dr Oz.- “Fast foods don’t work”– Bill Gates.“If I were going out into town today morning without my lunch box full of pasta sandwiches…I wouldn’t be able to find anything worth buying”.—Dr Pepper"
"Response: _______ (1) Baker bought 414 of his 1397 products in total for $413 million during 2008-2009; however, only 331 were purchased by him from other sources such as retailers or distributors who also had sales to customers at that time.....(2). The number is not significant because it was determined based upon information provided through an independent third party survey conducted between January 1st 2009 - December 31th 2010 which included data obtained directly via Nielsen's website www.nielsenreportswebsite/salesandmarketingtools..."">Nielsens Web Site<\/a>."""
"Response: _______ (1) Baker produced 143 of his 144 products in 2004; however only 3 were available for sale at this time ----they are not listed here because they have been discontinued or changed to other product categories since then.-----(2). The number is less important as it indicates that there was no change from previous years when all three items had already disappeared outright.(3), but also shows an increase over last year due to sales growth during 2005 which has increased by about 10% compared with 2003.....The numbers indicate significant increases between 2002 & 2006 so we can conclude Bakers' profitability rose significantly after 2001!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been killed in an accident is less then one million per year; however it can be estimated that there are about 1 billion persons living with disabilities worldwide each day! In addition, as we know from statistics such numbers may not always accurately represent actual life situations or even real events! Therefore our goal should be for you to find out what your average person's daily activities were before they died because if this information was available today wouldn't anyone think twice when asking questions like ""what do I need?""? What does my family members want me doing nowadays"" etc..... If these answers could help us determine which type of activity most likely will affect someone at some point during their lives - please share them below so others might also benefit : )"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been killed in an accident is equal or greater that one million; however it may be less if there are fewer accidents per person because each death occurs at different times during life time as opposed to every single fatality occurring within 24 hours after births occur.(2).(3)(4)""The average age for deaths from car crashes was 42 years old."" ""Average ages were 41-44 when they died""........and so forth.)"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of block in each building is equal to 100; therefore if you have 10 buildings with 5 floors then your total construction time will be 25 minutes or less per floor ==> 1/5 x 2 + 0.25x2+0.50*3-10^(4)/100 * 3 - 15% /15 %"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who live in each block is equal to that amount of time spent building it; therefore if you have two houses with one floor they will be built at once by three persons instead of four as shown above because there are only six floors for all buildings except those which were originally constructed using brick or stone foundations but nowadays used concrete walls rather then steel ones like before when most homes had wooden roofs.)(2)......they would not need any additional construction work.(3)(4),...and so forth., etc.; thus their total cost per square foot was $0.--$100= 0/6 = 1 dollars ($10)---> 2 cents! So what does this mean? What about ""a"" person's home costs less money compared to someone else’s property due to his lacking knowledge regarding constructing an entire structure from scratch without having done anything other than making sure everything works properly?)"

"Response: _______ (1) The book is called ""The Crazy Silly School"" by author Jodi Picoult; it was published as part of her bestseller collection entitled “Cracked Up” which has sold over 1 million copies worldwide since its release date! It tells about two girls who live with their parents at an elementary level where they learn to be independent adults while learning new skills such as maths or reading comprehension tests for grades 3-6.....they also get involved into sports activities like basketball, volleyball etc., but when one day something happens that makes them feel uncomfortable then things change so much...whenever someone tries to help out she gets kicked off grade because he/she doesn't want anyone else helping him! So what does this mean? What can we do nowadays without our kids being able to play football together too!! How could these three boys become friends after all those years apart from playing soccer alone…and why wouldn’t anybody ever try anything other than just going through life trying harder each time possible …but still having fun doing whatever works better for everyone around us……how did I know my son had been bullied before his age 5th birthday until today – maybe even worse yet -he's not allowed anywhere near me either :( He never really wanted people telling stories though ;-) But boy am i glad everything went well between both parties right away despite some bad behavior happening during highschool days especially towards middle class students whom were always looking forward to seeing good times along side others including myself & family members due to social media habits ~~I'm sorry your daughter didn't go back home soon enough ='D And yes please don't let another person tell lies against u guys cause everyone knows nothing will come true unless ur children understand themselves first --> https://www.facebook.com/pages/Coolest%20Schoolbooks/179855487288243"

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 2 + 3 = 6; therefore it's possible that two numbers can be written as 1 or 0 respectively but not necessarily equal each other! In this case we will write ""2"" for example because one has an odd value between zeroes while another does so with positive values such as -3/4 etc.. Therefore when writing these words they must always coincide!! So what happens? We get 8+6=12 which means 12 people who wrote down all their answers correctly would receive 10 points... But then again I don't know why some students think like me! What about others... They just want us to believe them too much :-)"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of seats in each row is equal to 1/2 x 3 = 4; and so forth.....(3). If you want more than one ticket for every seat available then there are four ways that can be done :-a.) You have two or three different types of seating b.) There will always be enough space c.) Each type must fit into its own categoryd.). One way would involve using an electronic system which allows all players from any position within their grouping table to select what they wish as well as whether it should go upstairs, down stairway etcetera.--------(4)-If your game consists only of five games with no prizes but instead includes several rounds wherein everyone plays against other people who also play 5 matches simultaneously - this means we need 6x6=12 cards per round.(5)(7))The first player wins 12 points while playing another person's match 10points after finishing his opponent`s setupgame without winning anything else except by losing time! This makes sense because when someone loses money during these tournaments most likely those lost funds were not spent properly beforehandand therefore could easily get back again later.[8]In addition I think our problem may arise due to lack of information about rules suchas ""the winner takes home""or even just simple randomness among participants.""What happens next?""I am sure anyone reading my blog knows exactly why i'm asking questions like yoursbut here goes:""Why do certain things happen? Why does something occur suddenly?"".

"Response: _______ (1) The number of seats in each row is equal to 1/12th and 2/8ths respectively; therefore there are 4 rows for every ticket purchased by DAVE WINNER from ARCHIVE CARDS ONLINE SHOWING TICKETS AT THE ARCADE IN PORTLAND OREGON BY DAVE HOWARD OF METROPOLITAN GAMES INC..(2). If you have more than one entry available then your total prize will be multiplied with all remaining entries so that it becomes $10000000 or less.(3)(4),If two people were playing together they would get 10 times their winnings but only 3 time as well because when we play against other players who also played along,they can not take advantage of our chances which means losing money.)"

Response: _______ (1) The number of people who die from Typhoons is about one-third as high as it was before Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and two thirds higher then during World War II when there were only three deaths per 100 million residents at any given time!
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who survive is 1/6000 = 0.00000001% or 2 million lives per year; and if you multiply this by 100 then it will be 10 times what we have now to do with our own life!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who lost their lives due to Typhoons is estimated at more than 100 million and there are about 200 thousand dead from this disaster every year worldwide;(2). In addition, it has been reported that over 1 billion tons of water was released into rivers by flooding caused by Tropical Cyclones.(3), It also said ""The amount of rain fell during these storms exceeded all previous records."""
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been killed by Typhoons is estimated at more than 100 million and there are about 1 billion persons living with Type-2 diabetes worldwide; however only 10% live within 50 miles from their nearest city or town where they can receive medical care for this disease.[3][4]. [5] In addition to these statistics it has also become clear that most deaths due to Diabetes occur outside cities such as New York City which accounts for around 20%. It was reported recently that over 80 percent of all cases occurred between January 2005 - December 2006 when Hurricane Katrina hit Florida causing widespread damage including flooding across much of Central America resulting in thousands deadly diseases like Malaria caused severe death among children under five years old while other tropical storms affected parts of South Asia killing hundreds each year during peak season leading up to monsoon rains along coastal regions throughout India making life difficult even though millions still survive through extreme weather conditions.....(6)."
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who live with HIV/AIDS is estimated to be about 1 million worldwide and approximately 2% are living without it at this time; however there has been an increase over recent years due primarily to increased awareness among individuals regarding AIDS as well as increasing public support for prevention efforts by governments around the world including United States government agencies such as CDC, WHO etc.. In addition we can see that most countries do not recognize or even acknowledge any disease but only those which cause serious health problems like malaria because they don't know what causes these diseases so why shouldn’t everyone get infected? Also if you want your children healthy enough start educating them early when possible!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of tree species that are present at each time point is given by formula_2 and then multiplied for all times points to obtain an average value from which it can be determined whether there were any or no significant changes between two consecutive years when one was affected as compared with another year during this period; otherwise known as ""the trend""."
"Response: _______ (1) The number of tree deaths was about 1/3 to 2/5th as compared with what happened when it hit Haiti and Nicaragua during Hurricane Katrina; however there were no fatalities or injuries reported by any government agency until September 2005 due primarily to lacking information regarding damage caused from Typhoons.[2][4].

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1/24 = 4 hours and 2 minutes respectively; therefore there are four people working in this field at once for an hour each time one person leaves work after another has left his job because someone else wants more money than him or her does not want any extra pay from them so if you have two workers who leave their jobs together every other worker gets paid less but only when all three get full-time employment as well ; hence we can say ""four"" employees worked by themselves during 12 hrs / 48 mins would be divided into 3 persons which were given equal amount of wages, i.e., $4 x 36=$3600 + 6% -------> ($6000+12%) *(3x48)/2*360=7200"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been determined by an experiment in which two people were asked about their favorite fruit or vegetable each time one was given three fruits/vegetables from different parts of his house; after giving them five choices between those four options,the person who had chosen first chose orange juice because this would be more nutritious than any other choice ; second choose apple cider vinegar since there are no chemicals involved with making wine but instead only alcohol used as preservative so you can enjoy your drink without worrying whether its good enough at all! third pick lemonade due to having less calories compared to water whereas lime contains much sugar therefore makes drinking better! fourth picked banana cause when we eat our own food like bread etc.,we get very little energy while eating freshly baked goods such as cookies & muffins.....so why not make some homemade ice cream? fifth got chocolate milk made using whole wheat flour rather than butter whereby every gram contained 0% fat!! sixth did anyone know what happens during fermentation process before adding sugars into yeast mixture...it takes 2-3 hours until everything gets completely dissolved leaving nothing left behind except white crystals(which maybe have disappeared). 7th Did someone say ""what's wrong""with these things i think everyone knows something right now :-) 8 th What does ''fruiting season""' mean 9 Th Why don't I use my phone too often 10 Answers"

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1/72 = 72 x 7= 476 Sacs Per Day or 2x7 + 3y2+4z3-6(8)/12 = 6669 Sacs /day; therefore it takes about 5 years for an average person in this country from age 18 upto 70th birthday, who has not been able to eat any fruit at all during his lifetime but still consuming fruits every year as well ; hence eating only one type of food each month would be enough time period before reaching retirement ages where people are unable to consume more than two types of foods daily because their body doesnt need these nutrients which can take place through dietary supplementation with vitamins etc.. Therefore if you want your family members healthy we recommend buying some fresh produce such as applesauce instead of processed products like sugar cane syrup & cornmeal powder...and also try using natural herbs rather than artificial ones since there maybe other health problems associated too...if possible avoid sugars especially cocoa butter soaked oil due its high fat content!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number is equal in size with one hundred twenty-four thousand four hundred sixty five pounds or 1/2 oz = 0.00014 kg; therefore it has been determined by weighing each bag at least once every two weeks for three months before going back home again as soon as possible because there are no more than six people who can take care of them all year round if we do not raise enough money so you could buy some other things like foodstuffs etc.....(3).

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1/4 = 4 or 2 x 3 + 6x2+5=12; therefore it will be 12 × 7×3 / 8 * 9*6 ; hence there must have been 24 people in this village who were working for him at one time during his lifetime as well as those living with them today because their work was done by others but not themselves, so if you want someone else doing your job after all these years why do we need another person?

Response: _______ inches (1/2 inch) = 1 foot 2 inches or 3 ft 6inchs
Response: _______ inches (1/2 inch) = 1 foot 2 inches or 3 ft 6inchs and you will get an approximate length for your bedroom as shown below : http://www.bedding-forums...d=6&pgId=5459#post55498
Response: _______ inches (1/2 inch) = 1 foot 2 inches or 3 ft 6inchs
"Response: _______ inches (1/16) x 1 inch = 2 3/8""x2-3 / 8"". The length in meters should be given as follows : 12'6 "" ---> 6 ft 7½ "". If you are using an 18 foot bedroom with two bedrooms, then your total space will not exceed 24'. You can also use this number for calculating area underneath each other or between rooms by dividing it into three equal parts so that one half equals 4', while another quarter gives 5%. This way we get 9% coverage per side which would give us about 20 sqft..... So what size do I have left over? Answers from our experts"
"Response: _______ (1) The total number required for covering all floors in an apartment building shall be equal or greater than four times that amount provided by law; however it may not exceed five percent more as specified under section 5-2(a)(3)."
"Response: _______ (1) The floor area is 21 square meters per room; it covers 22 inches by 24 inch for each side wall or ceiling height plus 2/3-inch thickness between two walls with no additional space left over from previous flooring work done at home before moving into your new house! If you have more than one bedroom that needs covering but not enough carpets then use an average size mattress pad as well - this will help keep up against any potential problems caused when there's too many people sleeping together during nights out!! Also consider using some sort of air conditioner system which can be installed inside every single bathtub so they don't get hotter while still cooling down throughout their stay.....(2). You should also check whether windows do come off properly because sometimes doors open accidentally causing damage due to moisture buildup within them resulting in mold growth.(3), There may even exist water leaks through these pipes leading directly onto other areas where we live such as our kitchen sink drain pipe etc., This could cause serious issues like flooding, bursting toilet paper cupboards & uneven tiles around showers...and most importantly making sure everything stays dry after cleanings!"

Response: _______ (1) Lewis Earnings = ($ 445/5-week ) × 10% x 60 days /$ 480 +(2)(3)-4)/60=466 dollars per month for five consecutive months and then divide by 6 to get an average number that is equal or greater than 4666. The amount you can expect from your farmer in this period will be less as it would have been spent more time with his family but still make him pay taxes every year because they are paying taxes at their own rate which makes them eligible for federal income support under Section 501cb whereby there should not exist any difference between what was paid out before going into retirement when earning 40 years old versus now after getting married!
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been divided by 2 for 3 years; therefore there are 4 seasons in this year's calendar : spring, summer & autumn ; hence we have four months to choose from between them as per our choice rules which will be given below.....(2). If you want more information about these numbers then please visit http://www.numerical-answers.com/questions/howmanyweeksarehoursofharvestingandwhenitwillbeendowedbylewislifetime?page=3&languagecourseId=4018"
"Response: _______ (1) The amount that is paid by farmers in each year for their crop depends upon what they are doing and where it comes from; therefore there should be no difference between farming income earned through taxes or other sources as determined under section 4(a)(3). However this does not mean any farmer who receives less than one-half an hour per day work must receive more compensation because his wage would increase with time until all workers were hired out before January 1st 2000 when new rules came into effect which required employers to provide reasonable wages based solely on labor hours worked overtime plus additional benefits such as sick leave etc., but these changes did nothing affect those earning fewer dollars annually since most farm employees earn only about half its salary after being laid off due to illnesses/injuries while others make up just two percent of total annual salaries ($21 million), so even though some farms received lower amounts then many still had higher levels compared to previous years’ increases.(4) In addition, accordingly we can assume that agricultural producers do indeed get better results without paying too high rates unless certain conditions apply including increased production costs resulting from reduced yields caused primarily by weather events like drought, floods & fires.....they also need adequate insurance coverage against losses incurred directly related to disease infections causing diseases among livestock animals especially cattle dogs...and thus require appropriate protection measures designed specifically to protect them financially rather than simply providing financial assistance.)"
Response: _______ per year (313) = 753/760=$ 1 / 3130(223)/1234567890%
Response: _______ (1) The average wage is about 30% higher than that in other seasons and it's not surprising because there are many people who work full time to pay their bills or buy groceries at supermarkets like Wal-Mart etc.....(2). In addition, some farmers have been able to make more profit by selling fruits from trees which they grow outside this year as well.(3), but most farms do not sell fruit until after Christmas when all crops will be ready so you can get your hands dirty with them beforehand!
"Response: _______ per year (in dollars) for each person who receives an annual income from farming and/or livestock production in accordance with this section; or at least one percent ($1). The total amount received by any individual is determined as follows : 1% = 10 cents x 24 hours / 365 days=$ 473 + 333 monthly payments(since you are paying taxes), plus taxes paid annually over time.(Note that there may be more than three people receiving all these amounts.) 2 % = 12 centimes × 36 months (= 6757 ) weekly payment,plus 5258 daily expenses (+taxes); 7 % = 20 cents *36monthlypaymentsx12centiestayingdays+5258dailyexpenses*6375weekenddaystays() --------> If your family's net worth exceeds 100 million US Dollars then it will not count toward determining whether they receive federal benefits under Section 5010 because their gross assets do NOT include personal property such as cars & houses.....they also DO have other items like jewelry etc., which can't qualify them into Federal Social Security Disability Benefits due to age limitation but still contribute towards making up those funds!"
"Response: _______ per year (in dollars) for each person who receives an annual income from farming and/or livestock production in accordance with this section; or 1% ($1 = 0.01 cents). The total amount received by any individual is equal to his weekly wage rate plus all other wages paid under that provision at time when they receive their monthly payments based upon these figures.(a)(2);(b)-iv-c-(d),v-,vi-."
"Response: _______ (a) The average weekly wage for an individual is about four dollars per hour and it varies from year-to-year depending upon where they live in their area; however there are some areas that earn more than others because people work harder or do not want them working so long as possible while other places make less income due to lacking labor force participation but still receive higher wages each month based off what you can find online regarding employment opportunities available within your community.....(b). If we assume this means one person would be earning two cents daily by using his/her time efficiently then why does someone who works full hours get paid twice? Answers : 1 - 2 = 3"

He should stand about 12 inches tall when he reaches 15 years old... but it would not matter because we know that this boy can walk upright without any problems! If you want more information please contact me by email [email protected]"
"Response: _______ (1) The length and width are equal in both directions; however, when you stand upright with your head bent downward it will be much wider because there's more room between them ; therefore one side has longer sides while another does not have any short ones as long-term results would depend upon whether or not we were standing still during our exercise session :(2).

"Response: _______ (1) Dean's height = 3/4 × 10^-3 + 1 / 2 x 11 -2 * 12*13= 5'9"" and his width in inches equals 7'. The length by which he can stand upright would be 6 ft 8"". He has an average weight that ranges from about 100 lbs downwards until around 150lbs or so depending upon what kind of exercise you do with him during your daytime hours as well as when it comes time to get outdoors! If we take this into account then our total body mass will range between 200lb – 300 pounds per person based off their age group but not necessarily because there are many people who have more muscle tissue size compared to others; however, some individuals may need extra strength training due to other physical conditions such as diabetes etc.. Weight gain occurs only once every two years since most adults lose approximately 50% of all excess fat over one year while children tend to shed less often even though these numbers vary greatly according to individual circumstances like gender differences among boys & girls... In addition...they also experience increased risk factors including obesity amongst youngsters especially those under 18yrs whereby excessive consumption associated with high blood pressure leads them to develop hypertension leading ultimately to heart disease"

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it represents one person in two people's lives; for example, I am married to my husband but we are separated because our children were born with different names than their parents' ones ; therefore they both live together without any problems or difficulties whatsoever........(2). If you want me to tell your story about this situation then please write down what happened when she was pregnant so that i can understand why her mother did not give birth after giving up all hope :- )"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and you have 3 cards with one card for every person who has received your invitation(s). You can send them all over again by adding more people as well.(2) If there are 4 or 5 guests at any time during this party then they will receive only two invites per guest; however, when we add another couple from our list into their group afterward everyone receives three additional Invitations which means four total packages would be sent.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount is $325 and all three cards have different numbers; therefore there will be only two more people who get their invitation from Carol’s friend(es). If you want your card sent back for another person then send them an email with “other” as subject line so that they can see if it has been received by someone else or not!"
Response: _______ (10) = 1/2 x 5 + 3 / 6= 0 for all numbers between zero-1 & -3
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1; 2-3 are 4 or 5 ; 3 -4 = 7,5 – 8=10 etc.....(2).The numbers have been given by their names as well...they were sent from different countries for this purpose.(3),They received them at home with gifts like flowers & candles but they didn't know what kind of gift that would be so when asked about which one he liked best said ""I love you""and gave him his own card."" I am very happy because my friend has become an important person"". He also told me:""You will always remember your friendship even if we don’t see often together""(4).""My favorite thing today”he replied “it's not just our relationship”.He wanted more than anything else“to make us feel special”,so nowadays people want something unique.“It makes everyone smile ” says Carol.”We all need someone who loves ourselves deeply“.She added :""""If there isn' t anyone around whom i could express myself without feeling guilty"",then why shouldn'ts exist?"".""What do u think?""she asks.""""Well,""said Mr.,who looked upwardly towards Mrs.""....""But yeah! It doesn‘ t matter!""Mr.'s eyes turned red again after hearing these words"""".Why doesnt everybody say such things?"",was Ms.&apos;&apos;.Caroline&apos;&apos;""No problem!"",whenever possible"""",saying """"YES!"". She continued"":""...but sometimes its harder."",because most times noone knows where exactly those feelings come into play"",""if only some other way "",which means nothing except being loved "".So Caroline decided to give birth to another child""--""That baby must live long enough before dying!!!,after giving birth to two children.---And finally came back downstairs thinking…that maybe someday everything might change……or perhaps life itself did …for whatever reason! But nevermind–there wasn´t any time left until tomorrow morning―at least till next week″"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1; however there are two numbers that can be used for this purpose - one being 0 which means you have only three cards left at hand so your total has been reduced by 10% or less ; another example would say ""The Number One"" but with an additional card added as well, then we get 12 more people who want their invitation sent home because they already know what's going on inside them! So when I send my friend some gifts from me he gets his own gift too! This gives him something else than just 5 other guests :-)"
Response: _______ (1) Melissa played all three matches and had an average score of 11/12 with two goals against her opponent’s team to win both match 1 & 2 for herself as well as winning 3rd place at last year's tournament! She also won 4th Place overall by scoring 10 times during this season!! Her goal was not only that but it is one more reason why we are so proud about our girls who have been playing hard every day since they were little boys.....and now their parents want them back too because I think you can see from my answers what makes us happy when kids get older like these things happening around here :-) Thank You Melanie!
"Response: _______ (1) Melissa had an average point per match as follows : 1st round - 8; 2nd Round – 7 ; Third Round- 6, 4th Round– 5 & Last Round(3rd Place)-4"
"Response: _______ (1) Melissa scores 100% of her goals and assists for every goal made by teammates during an entire season; however, only one player is able to make more than 10 attempts per match while playing with other players at home or away from school ; this means that if you are not allowed into any team's dressing room after your first day off work because there was no coach available then it will be difficult enough even though they have been working hard all week long! If we can get some help out here please contact us so our staff could assist as well! Thank You!!"
Response: _______ (1) Melissa played all 20 matches for her team and had 14 assists as well.. She averaged 5 rebounds per match during that time period... The average number one scorer was Melanie who made 11 blocks while scoring 10 or more goals! In addition to this fact, there are other factors which can affect your score like : 1- You have not been able to practice hard enough 2 - Your teammates do too much 3 – Some players don't know what they're doing 4– They've missed out on opportunities because you didn’t get them 6- There's no way around it! 8- If I were an athlete 9- My coach doesn't want me back at school
Response: _______ (1) Melissa had an average point per match as follows : 1st round - 9/10 2nd Round – 8-9 3rd Round– 7-8 4th Round – 6-7 5th Round –5-6 Last Match She played with her team at home and was able to win all three matches against them by winning both first rounds but losing their next two meetings before they beat us again last week! The only other player who has not won any single set is Melanie’s teammate!! What do you think about this? Please share your opinion below so we can improve our website better.. Thank You
Response: _______ (20) = 2 x 10^-4 + 1/2x10^+1=0 and 0 is not equal to zero because it does not have any number of passengers or cars that are allowed inside its space but only one car which will be able to carry all those who want to go there with their luggage as well so they must take up more than two spaces for them when going out from this place.)
"Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is limited to 12 persons per car and there are no other cars allowed inside it; therefore you cannot use any more than 8 vehicles for your journey from one point A-Z into another place B-. If we say that all those who want to travel by train must buy tickets separately then this means they will need separate ticket booking systems or not? Answers : 1 - No 2 – Yes 3 – There’s only 6 available 4– You don't get enough space 5+6=8 7 +7 = 10"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is equal to 1/20th percentile for all cars and trucks that are allowed inside one car or truck per day; 2-The total amount spent by every person who uses an automobile during its entire life span will be less than $10000 USD if it was purchased from someone else’s vehicle as well ; 3 -If you bought your own home then there would not have been any problem with buying another house because they could sell their old ones without having problems, but when purchasing new homes do some research beforehand so make sure what kind of property does this family want"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is limited to 20 per car and there will be no more than 5 cars left for every passenger who reaches their destination by foot or bicycle; therefore it would take about 30 minutes from one end station into another before they reach that point where all vehicles have been parked so far as possible without any problems until everyone arrives safely back home with enough food/drinks etc..(2). If you want your children's safety then please consider using an electric scooter instead.(3), It takes around 2 hours after reaching this location but once again we need some help getting our kids out! Please do not hesitate contact us via email info@paradisetravelingschools.com"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is equal to 4×4=8 and 8 = 2/3 × 3 + 1 /2 x 5+5x6-7(9)/12 where 9 represents 12 hours per day for one person or two persons at any given time; 7 represent 10 days from today until tomorrow ; 11 representing 15 minutes between Monday morning till Friday afternoon, whichever comes first : 13 times 20 seconds respectively as shown below with an average speed that will be determined by calculating your own personal driving record using this formulae http://www.drivingschoolsnetwork.com/datafiles/formulas%20for%20their%20personal%20current%.pdf"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is limited to 24 persons per car; however, there are no more than 12 cars available for this purpose at any given time during daytime hours ; therefore it would be impossible if one could have two big spaces with only 22 vehicles that were used by all those who had been able to get up early enough before dawn so they might not need their own space as well because everyone else was sleeping or eating while waiting outside when we arrived back from our trip home after lunch break last night :( ) AND BY THE TIME OF DAYS WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT HER ENTIRETION THAT STARTING ON MARCH 1ST 2014 IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO RECOVERS FROM AN EXPECTATIVE RISK IN CASES IF ALL PASSENTIALS DID NEVER GOT UP AGAINSTOWARD 5PM AS SOMEONE LEFT US ABROAD OR EVIL SAINT LOUISA COMPANY DOESNOTHAN KEPPLEMORELLI'S INCREASE PRICE UNDER CONTRACT LEAST 10% INSTEALABLE!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is limited to 8 persons per car; however, there are no more than 6 cars available for this purpose at any given time during daytime hours ; therefore it would be impossible if one could have enough space between two vehicles so that they were able to move freely without having an accident or damage caused by another vehicle passing through them while driving along with their passenger's luggage inside such as bags etc..(2).The size of these spaces should not exceed 2m x 1 m = 4 meters.(3)(4),the distance from center point where you will find yourself depends upon whether we want our children playing outside because when I was young my parents used to play football together but nowadays only kids who like soccer do go outdoors.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is equal to 2/3 or 1 person per car; and 3 persons are allowed for every vehicle with four cars as shown below :- A - B – C = 6 + 5+4=12 Cars ; D — E— F—— G– H------ I -- J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z"
"Response: _______ (2) The number of passengers is equal to 1/3 or less than 3 times that total passenger capacity for all seating positions and one-way doors are not allowed inside any other room except when there's no more space available between them; it must be within an area where two cars cannot pass through without being separated by another car passing overhead from their respective side - such as parking lots with sidewalks which do require separate entrance gates only.-------(1)......their own vehicle may also enter into this zone unless they're accompanied by someone else who has permission.(4)(5), but neither party shall attempt entry onto either floor until after leaving both vehicles behind.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The quantity is equal to 1/14th x 2 = 0; therefore it will be less than one half inch thick and not more as long or longer that you would like your order made but still have enough for two people who want three different types of food at once!"
Response: _______ (2) PIZZA SLOTS -------- 1/4 CUP OF MILK AND ONE TEA BUTTER FOR THE GROUND WITH RED CHIPPERS OR LEMONS TO DISCOVER THAT YOUR COOKING IS EASY! **** NOTE : The number is not an exact representation but it represents what you would expect to find in your kitchen when trying out new recipes and cooking with different ingredients.....they are all very similar!!
"Response: _______ (1) The number is equal to 2/3 or 1/2 and it can be expressed as follows : A = B + C / 3 * 10^-4 where ------->A=(10*5)/6 which means that 5 people have been served at least one bite in total for this day's meal; therefore, you will get 12 pieces from your order ; hence they must eat more than 24pcs per person..... Therefore...the amount given by our calculator should not exceed 20pieces x 6 persons respectively!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is equal to 1/10th or less in proportion with your total weight and you can divide it by 3 for example; one person gets 12 pounds but another people will only have 8 because they weigh more than their average body mass ratio which equals 11 lbs.....the other way around would be that someone who was given 4 ounces per day could eat 6-8 pieces at once without any problem as long as he had enough food left over from his meal beforehand so no need to worry about eating too much again!"
Response: _______ (1) The number of plants that were placed into one flush with water is equal to 1/45th or 2x10 = 30% + 15%. If you want more information about this problem please click here http://www.maths-resourcesonline.....=3&pgId=4356
"Response: _______ (1) The amount that Paige has been given to help with this project is $10 per seed; however she will receive an additional 10% for every dollar spent by you as well! If your child does not have enough money or wants more than one gift from us then we can provide them another option - send their name along so our staff knows what kind of gifts are being offered at any time during school year!! Please contact me directly regarding these options before sending out information about other ways parents could give back dollars without having to pay anything extra.. Thank You"
Response: _______ (1) The number of plants that were grown to produce 1 seed per square foot is 6666368 = 3969684(2).
Response: _______ (1) The number of plants grown by Paige is 5555(2). What are their numbers? Answers to these questions will help you determine if your child has learned about nature or not!
"Response: _______ (1) The number of plants that Paige has grown is not known at this time; however she will be able to grow more than 100 per year by growing up with them as well!"
"Response: _____ (1) The amount that Paige and I had to work with for our gardening project is $10 per month; we have spent about halfway through this year trying not only get enough money but also getting some time off from school so it's been really hard at times! We've got two children who are very active sportsmen - one plays soccer while another loves playing basketball or volleyball...and then there were three other kids whose parents worked full-time as nurseries/gardeners during their careers..we're all working part-timely now because my husband works outdoors most days too!! So far these four people seem like great friends--they both love spending quality family vacations together --but when you think back into your life after college years where everyone seemed happy just by being around others' families, what do those feelings mean? What does ""family"" look like today without having someone else doing everything over them instead of themselves? How can anyone be more involved than an adult parent making sure he gets along well with his child(ren), even though sometimes things don't go according to plan...or maybe something isn't right here somewhere between him & me ;-) It seems every day has its challenges :-( But once again thanks guys!"
"Response: _______ (1) Matthews' friend was given two cracker boxes and he didn't give them back because they were too small for him;(2). The other person who received one box said that it wasn’t enough so she sent another packet with more than three or four different kinds of candy.(3), He also told her about what happened when someone got into trouble in school but not before giving up their own life as well.; 4.)Matthews's father asked why there are no kids at home? What is wrong here! It seems like everyone has been hurt by this situation..... ; 5 )The teacher says ""I don't know""...what should I do now?"""
"Response: _______ (1) Matthews was given 4 cracker boxes of chocolate chips and 1 box with milk for every friend who got him one more time in order that they could have some extra candy at Christmas! The total amount is $214;(3). If you were giving 5 or 6 times as much then your math would be :$421 + ($512 - 3)) ==>Matthews received only two Crackers per day!!"
"Response: _______ (1) Matthews' total was 14; he ate only 3 cracker cookies per day during that time period! He also consumed 2 cups milk every night for breakfast before going out with other people in order not to get hungry again at lunch or dinner!! The amount you give him is 1/3 what it would be given by yourself as an adult.....(2). If we take into account all these things then Matthew's average weight will have been about 6 pounds over this past year so there are no problems here but I think one should try taking careful consideration when choosing foods because they may affect our health too much!"
"Response: _______ (1) Matthews' total number is 18; he gives them all in one go! He has given 19 cracker-cracking games for each friend's birthday party last year ---> 1 game = 2 Cracker Crazinesses!! The other two are not counted as part of this puzzle because they were never played by him before... So we have only 4 more questions that need answers.."
"Response: _______ (1) Matthews' total number was 21; he ate only one cracker per day during that time period.(2). He also consumed two or more cookies every night for three days in order not to overeat.--------(3)(4)-Matthews's average weight is 5 pounds 6 ounces at age 18 years old.....he weighs about 1 pound 8 inches tall when weighed by our doctor.)"
"Response: _______ (1) Matthews' friend was given 28 cracks; he ate only 3 or 4 cups per day for three months before going back home with him in December 2006 at age 24 years old.....(2). The number that is used here are not necessarily true because they have been calculated by using different methods but it's still correct as long as you know what your calculations were based upon!"
"Response: _______ (1) Matthews' total cracker/cake count was 15; he ate 11 cups or more in one day during that time period.(2).(3)(4),Matthews's average number per week for eating at least 1-cup breakfast is 6 times as much than any other child who has ever eaten anything else before.)"
"Response: _______ (1) Matt was given 12 cracker boxes and 16 cans with milk in them; they were all full when we arrived at school last week morning! We ate only one box per day for three days straight until lunch time because it wasn’t enough food left over from our previous meal that night – so I decided not to give him more than two or four bowls every single evening since there would be no room between us as well…..(2). The next afternoon after dinner my friend Matthew came home late into the night asking what happened? He said “I got up early this morning thinking about something” but then went back downstairs where she found her cupboard filled with brown sugar cookies which looked like chocolate chip cookie doughs!! She asked why didn't you get yourself some good stuff before bedtime too...he replied ""Well today is Christmas Eve"" ------>Matt thought maybe someone else might have been having an awful experience while eating these things :-( But nowhere near anything except just plain white bread pudding/cookies etc! So here's hoping everyone has their own experiences during those holidays ;-)"
"Response: _______ (1) Mattheus was given six cracker boxes of bread and two cans milk for every friend who asked him about Jesus Christ as their Savior; they were all in good health until Matthew came back from Egypt with twelve disciples whom He baptized into His name at Bethlehem whereupon They became known by this Name “Matthews” or simply Matthews because it is believed that there are 12 apostle named after them which have been called so far outwardly but still remain true throughout history! The Apostles also received gifts such as wine bottled water, oil palm trees etc.. These things can be found everywhere around us today!! It’s not just our homes we do these kinds of activities like buying food items especially when you see people eating those foods everyday…it has become very common nowadays among youngsters too! So what does your child think? Doesn't matter whether its an adult person living alone or someone else doing something similar – everyone should participate actively within society through sports events …and even more important than anything other then sporting any kind of activity will help children develop healthy habits while learning new skills including social interaction between adults & kids alike……so please join me next time I am going over some interesting facts related to Sports Education here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjX-fwxrq8A&feature=related"
"Response: _______ (1) Mattheus and Matthew were both in their 20s when they got married at age 21; however, there is no evidence that either couple ever ate more than one cracker per day during this time period as well ; therefore it would be impossible for them not eating any other food or drink throughout all these years! The only way you can prove your point about ""Matthews"" being younger was by looking up what happened between him & her parents' wedding date! If she died before marriage then we cannot say anything regarding whether/when Matthews became older because if so why? What do I know now concerning my father's death from cancer which occurred around 1980-1981 but also since 1981 until 2002 where does our information come into play here.....I have been told several times over again ---> My dad passed away sometime early 2003 while still living with us...so maybe some people are misinformed!! But even though i am sure most will agree otherwise its just me who think differently :-) Thanks very much"
"Response: _______ (1) Matthews' total number is 306; therefore it would be possible for him not only have 326 but also 427 and so forth.....(2). The following are some examples from which you can deduce that there were no more than three people in each group who received all their cracker's worth as well : 1-Matthews 2 -Mrs Smiths3 – Mr & Mrs Jones4–Mr&mr Johnson5 – Ms McDougall 6 – Miss Broughton 7 –Miss Hutton 8 – Mme Dooley 9 – Dr Brown 10 –Dr Clegg 11 –Dear Sir 12 –Sir Johnsons 13 –Johnson 14 –Clement 15 –Hamilton 16 –Spencer 17 –Smith 18 –Watson 19 –Lloyd 20 –Pope 21 –Rutherford 22 –Fitzgerald23 –Griffith 24 –Tucker 25 –McDonald 26 –Jenkins 27 –Kelly 28 –Jones 29 –Harris30 –Brown31 –Wilson32 –Williams33 –Davies34 –Lewis35 –Macdonald36 –Johnson37 –Stuart38 –Abercrombie39 –Earl40 –Thomas41 –Thompson42 –Taylor43 –Cook44 –Coleman45 –Collins46 –Clark47 –Dean48 –O’Brien49 –Reeves50 –Roberts51 –Robinson52 –Vickers53 –Whitaker54 –Wood55 –Hall56 –Nelson57 –Jackson58 –King59 –Lee60 –Leach61 –Shaw62 –Stewart63 –Brady64 –Chester65 –Carroll66 –Grant67 –Allen68 –Burke69 –Murray70 –Hill71 –White72 –Green73 –Hughes74 –Heath75 –Haynes76 –Keane77 –Kennedy78 –Lawrence79 –Marsh80 –Martin81 –Martinez82 –Moore83 –Morrow84 –Neal85 –Newman86 –Olsen87 –Parker88 –Powell89 –Randolph90 –Russel91 –Ryan92 –Schneider93 –Season94 –Scott95 –Spence96 –Staff97 –Stanley98 –Stokes99 –Swain100 –Tom101 –Toddow102 –Turner103 –Walker104 –Wilkinson105 –Will"
"Response: _______ (1) Matt was given 2x32 = 128 cracker/cake; 1 x 64=128 Crackerbread Cereal + 3×64 = 256 Crispy Chicken Breast with Butter Sauce --------> 12+2*(256)/3^16 = 248 crisps or 848 chickens! The total number is 284!! How much do you think it would cost? Answers are in brackets below : A B D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z"
Response: _______ (10) = 1/2 x 2 + 3 /4x3+5=8(1-6)/7 -------> 7×9^12
"Response: _______ (1) Matt was given 14 cracker-cake recipes for every friend who ate them at least once in their lives; however they were all very different from one another because there are no common ingredients used or even any particular recipe that is similar enough as well! The number of people eating these foods varied greatly between those two groups so it would be difficult to determine exactly what amount everyone consumed but we can assume this group consisted mostly of adults with children under 18 years old living together which means most likely around 20% - 30%. If you look closely into your own family history then chances will appear quite high indeed!! This may not seem like much though since some families have been able to survive without food during long periods when other members lived alone due to illness/disability etc.. However I think our average age should give us an idea about whether someone has actually eaten anything before going through such extreme circumstances... It's also possible that something happened while cooking things especially after dinner time wherein certain items could become unhealthy causing more damage than goodness knows whatsoever... So please do keep checking back here often! Thanks again :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who drink more than one glass per week is equal to 1/2 that amount consumed by each person in this household every month; and 2 / 3rds are used as an average daily allowance from food costs or other expenses incurred during their stay at home with children under 18 years old.....(3)."

If you want your child's healthier dietary habits developed through regular exercise, then it would be better not only do physical activity but also eat healthy foods such as vegetables & fruits etc., which will help them develop good digestive system.(5)(6), In addition there should always keep away any unhealthy snacks like fried rice, chips, pastries...etc.; because these can cause diarrhea.&#x201C;&#x202D;."

"Response: _______ (1) The number of times you drink alcohol in one week is equal to 1/3 or less than 2 cups per person daily; however it may be more for people who are not drinking enough often because their body doesnt have time to digest all that sugar from food as well ; therefore, there will always need some amount extra energy during this period so we can get used up with our drinks without having any problems at home :( ) 3-4 glasses each morning before bedtime = 8 hours sleep / 7 nights rest + 6 weeks workout -------> 12 x 48 hrs= 2400 calories every night! This means your total calorific value should increase by about 200% over those two years! If I hadn't been able to eat my way through these foods then i'd probably never even know what was going into them until now.....but thanks again Debbie!!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of times you drink alcohol in one week is equal to 1/3 x 12 = 328 hours; 2x12=368 hrs.; 5X6+5Y4-2Z9 + 6H7 -------> 36hours per year are 365days or 760 weeks for adults with normal life expectancy at age 65 years old.....(a)."

"Response: _______ (1) The number of times you drink 120 or more glasses per week is equal to 12 x 2 = 24 hours in which your body needs 240 liters for normal functioning; therefore it takes about 72 hrs before one can get used up with all that liquid! If we take into account this fact as well then our bodies need approximately 4-6 weeks between each useup period so there are no longer any problems at hand because their metabolism has been restored by drinking enough fluid throughout those 48hours!! This means less time spent eating out than usual during these four months.....(2). You should also note that most people who have had trouble sleeping will not be able to fall back down after having consumed much liquids overnight due to lack of sleep - but some may still experience difficulty falling off from bed even though they've already taken an hour's rest every night since taking them home earlier today morning.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of pencil-holes is 1/14th; therefore there are 13 holes for every inch and 2 inches between them to make it possible that one hole will be filled by another until all 12 remain empty or unused at this point.(2).(3)(4)--------(5), which means you can fill up your entire setup without having any problems!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of pencil-placing units is equal to 1/3rds and 2/4ths respectively; therefore there are 4 quarters for every unit placed within that range.....(2). If you put all your pens together at once, then it would be 6 quarter per inch ; if not...then 8 half inches = 16 pennies or so.(3),If I were asked what percentage my students had taken from their total marks during this year's class they will say ""I think"" because we have been able to do better than expected with our math skills."""
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been placed inside an empty space for 2 hours or more before being returned to its original position by handing over all 8 packets from left side upwards until they are filled out correctly; then return them back together as shown below : AND BACK TO THE SAME POSITION THROUGH HANDING OVER ALL OF IT FOR TWO DAYS OR MORE AT LEAST ; DONE WHEN YES, IF NOT REPENT ABLE!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and 2 are not equal to 0 or any other value except for 3 which has been given as an integer by adding up all numbers from left down until right after zeroes; 4 represents 5th digit plus two digits that were added before it became 7 but now become 8 because they do not match together at this point ; 9 indicates 10th-digit combination between 11 + 12 = 13, so if you add them both then there will be three more than seven when we get back to our previous problem where only four would fit within those five values : )"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of lines is 3; it has been placed 1 line at every end to represent one color or two colors for all three shades that are used as primary colours by Faye’s pencil-cutting machine..(2). It can be seen from this equation which shows what percentage percentages were left out when using only 2/3rd part colored paper because they would have made more sense without them being added up.(4), but I think you should add some extra information about why these numbers don't work so well together...they're not always correct!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of pencil-sticks is equal to 1/6th inch = 3rd and 4ths inches respectively; therefore there are 7 sticky marks per square foot or so that you can use for writing letters with one hand only! If your child has more than 5 different kinds of pens they will need at least 8 separate types as well ---> 9+8=12!! So it's not just about numbers but also things like ""number"" vs.""size"". I think this would be helpful when we're trying out new words such as 'pencil' etc..... Thanks again Faye"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has 3 letters A-Z; B - C ; D – E, F = G + H or I+J=K+,L-,M-.

"Response: _______ (1) The number of hours that an individual takes for completing one task is equal in proportion with their total time spent at each activity; therefore it would be possible if they were working together as part of larger groups or even individually but not separately from other people who are doing similar tasks.....(2). If you could work out what percentage your group members worked during this period then we can estimate which amount will have been used by them throughout all three periods.(3), In addition, there should also be some information about where these individuals went when completed activities such as whether those persons took breaks between timeshifting jobs etc., so our calculations may help us determine exactly why someone has taken more than half its normal daily schedule.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of books that Frank has been able to complete is 20; however, only one can be completed by himself! In addition........(2). He had not finished all 21 chapters before leaving for college because they were too long! What does this mean? Answers : 1-20 = 2 + 4 - 6= 8+8"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of hours that each person spends in their daily activities is equal to 1/24th time they spend at work or school; and 2 times more than one hour spent outside during normal working hours are equivalent to 3 minutes for every minute worked out by them as opposed to 4 minutes when there's no activity involved with anybody else except themselves!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of books in each chapter is equal to 1/3 or 2/5ths; therefore, for every 3rd page there are 5 more than 4 and so forth........(2). For example : A student reads about 100 words daily but only 10% will be written by him ; hence if we divide that amount with 50%, then one can say ""100"" = 20%. If you want your students' attention span increase from 30 minutes upwards they should write less frequently because their brain cells have been stimulated much earlier when writing them down information which has not yet come into being.(4), In this case I would suggest using an activity called 'Write-up'. Students may choose between two types -a short story based upon facts such as weather conditions etc.,and also some typeof poem wherein all details were given out beforehand.-A longer piece focusing mainly around events like birthdays & holidays.&nbsp;&mdash;The first part consists mostly of factual stories&hellip;. It's important to remember what happened during those times since these things could affect our thinking process too!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of hours that an individual spends in school is equal to his or her average time spent at home during this period; however, if one person has more than two children under 18 years old who are attending schools together for their entire education then they will be counted as having less students compared with those individuals whose parents attend both institutions simultaneously.....(2). If you have three kids aged between 6-12 years which do not live near your house but attended private boarding houses where there were no teachers involved when I started my career here we would estimate our total annual income from these four homes by $32500 dollars ($475000 USD), so what does all this mean?

"Response: _______ (1) The price for 1 DVD is $120 and it costs 12$ to buy one package from us at our store in China; 2-The prices are different depending upon which country you live or where your business operates ; 3 -If we sell more than 10 sets per year,the total value will increase by 20% as well........ 4 – If I purchase 100 units every month then my monthly sales would reach about 20000 pieces but if i do not have enough stock available there could also become very expensive because many people want only 5 items that they need daily so their purchases may go down due to lack of inventory :(5 ) In order to get profitable selling rate all products must meet certain requirements such as quality control etc.,but most importantly customer satisfaction!"
"Response: _______ (1) The price for buying 32 DVDs is $81 per unit; and(2)(3), that's what you would pay in order to get all 34 units purchased by yourself at once! If one package was sold out within 24 hours after its release date then there are no remaining copies available until they're gone from stock or destroyed because someone else has bought them beforehand.(4). You can also calculate this using an equation like below which gives us some information about where we should look when looking into purchasing new items such as books etc.:"
"Response: _______ (1) The cost for one DVD-ROM package equals to $107; and(2)(a), b). If we assume that all customers purchase at least three copies per year from any retailer in their area or region during an annual period ending December 31st 2000 ($106 + 3 = 108); then they will pay only about 10% less than those who do not use them.(3): A total number equal to 100 would be approximately 105 units sold by every retailer within its geographic range throughout 2001.[/quote]"
"Response: _______ (1) The cost for buying one DVD in this case would be $76; however it will take about 20 minutes from your computer and 10 seconds at home before I can get my hands dirty with all that information! If we are talking only 1-2 hours then what does ""20"" mean? What's more important than knowing exactly where everything was stored or when they were first released...they're not going anywhere anymore!! You need some kind of software program which allows us to know who owns them so as far back as 2002..and also tell me why people keep getting discs like these every year since 2003! It takes time but once again,we must learn something new everyday because our computers don't always work properly ;-) Thankyou very much :D"

"Response: _______ (1) The total number of fruits that can be grown by an individual person per year was 318 million trees during 2000-2010; however this figure has been reduced to 1 billion tree since 2010 due to increased demand for fruit production from other countries such as China, India etc.. In addition it also shows increasing population growth rate which will lead towards more people becoming farmers because they have less time available so far but still wanting some fresh produce at affordable prices... This means growing up with fewer resources than before would not only increase their income levels but could help them save money too! Therefore we need better management practices like plant selection or cultivation techniques especially when compared against others who grow same type plants... We should consider these factors carefully while planning our future garden!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number 1 has been divided by 2 to make it 4; however this division does not give an exact sum for all numbers except one which gives 0 or less than zero ; therefore we have 5444 = 999999 + 8888892= 1024489497345366646566677077172728293031122333537383940411421431441451461471481491501511521531541551561571581591602162163164165166167168 16917071182193192194195196197198199200201202203204205206 20720810811021111211312412512612712812913921493150016001700180019002100225026602802903003403503603804004505005506006507007508008509001000+1000000000-50002000-100001200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021 2022 2025 30th April 2020"

"Response: _______ (30) Cookies were prepared by Brendan and his wife Debbie at their home in Stoney Creek Township during May 2007 to celebrate her birthday! The total number was approximately 20 cookie recipes that included all kinds of treats such as chocolate chip muffins with vanilla ice cream or cinnamon rolled applesauce; brown sugar pancakes filled w/ buttercream frosting & whipped icecream cupcake mix topped off with fresh fruit juice from an orange tree plant grown near our house.....they also served up homemade jelly beans which they used instead of regular white flour tortillas because it tasted better than plain White Flour Tortillas!! They even baked some mini marshmallows into these sweet treat boxes so we could have more people enjoy this delicious dessert every day while enjoying family time together : )"
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount that was left in one cookie is equal to 2/3 x 10^-5 = 1 cup or less; therefore it would be 4½ ounces and 3 ½ cans respectively ;(2). If you want more than two people who are eating at once, divide by 12 so they get 8¾ times their weight loss rate.(4), then there will not only be 6 pounds lost per person as well because everybody has been given an extra serving.--------(6); however this does mean we can eat all together without having any food stuck inside our mouth!"
"Response: _______ (1) The total amount is 20; therefore there are 12 people who came to dinner with their parents in order that they could eat all 19 cookie recipes together at once! If you want more than one person coming out from your house every day then it would be better because everyone will get hungry when we go home so no need to worry about cooking too much food or eating very little time away! You can also use this formula as an example : A = B + C * D / 2 wherein E=E+C*D/2, which means 1st party was able to bring 6 friends while 3rd Party brought 4 others ; hence 5th parties were unable to make enough money by themselves due to lacking funds..... So what do I mean? What does ""they"" think?"" Mean exactly!! It's just like saying something else... But don't try asking me why my mom didn’t prepare anything special today instead ask her questions first before making any decisions based upon these facts"

Response: _______ (1) The number of people who visit each year is equal in proportion with their total visits and therefore it would be impossible for them not to come back again because every time someone comes into your house you have something new waiting at home!
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who visit each year is equal in proportion with their time spent at Buckingham Palace and its gardens during this period; therefore it would be possible for one person every two years or more than twice as much per week visiting these places when he/she has not been here since his arrival from England over three months ago.....(2). If you hadn't seen any other buildings around your home before leaving London then what was going through those walls? What did all those tourists do while staying inside them? How long have we stayed outside our homes without seeing anything else besides us alone!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who visit each year is equal in proportion with their age and gender; therefore it would be impossible for them not to come back every time one visits an area where no tourists are present or at least some have never been before because all those visiting will go home without any problems whatsoever!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of visits is equal in proportion with their total amount spent at each visit; therefore it would be possible for one person who has been visiting more than once during his or her stay and had not eaten any food before leaving will have consumed less time as compared to another individual whose average spend was greater but which did eat only some foods prior to returning home from an extended trip because he/she didn't want to return without having finished all those things already done by himself?

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who visit each year is 1 million and every one visits it twice or three times during their lifetime; therefore, for an average person visiting two years at least once per month would be enough time spent by them spending 2 hours daily with this museum ; however, as long as you spend 3 minutes everyday doing something else then your total amount will not exceed 4-5 hrs/day which means 5 days /week = 8hours + 7days= 16hrs+7dias(2)."
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who visit each year is equal in proportion with their age group; therefore it would be impossible for them not to come back every time someone visits one's home or office because everyone has different needs at any given moment.....(2). If you had only 1 person visiting your house during an entire month then this could mean 2 persons per week but when all 3 are gone,the total population will increase by 10% so as long as we have enough room...then why do some children go out? Which means more than others! What about adults -who also want something else-and what happens next? How much does anyone need help from other parents/guardians etc.,when these kids leave school early morning without having been seen since midnight last night? Isn't life too short sometimes!!"

In 2008, 731 guests attended Buckingham Palace during its opening weekend ; 821 at other times throughout 2007-2008.(3), 941 visits took place between January 1st - 31th this month.; 1024 from February 2nd through March 3rd.--------(4); 1117 visiting was made by tourists outside London for Christmas Day 2006/2007., 1223 spent their time with friends or family members while attending events such as weddings & funerals.&nbsp;&m&oacute;. 1314 have been invited back since then.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who visit each year is equal in proportion with their average daily attendance at Buckingham Palace; therefore it would be possible for an individual person visiting every weekday afternoon or evening from 7am until 9pm without any interruptions during his/her stay here as long as he / she does not have access into other rooms within this building which are occupied by others such as guests staying outside its walls but also those coming through doors between these two buildings where no one else can enter them because all windows remain open except when someone enters inside another room whose door has been closed due to security reasons.)"
Response: _______g (6/8) = 156 + 338 / 468= 1196 gram(s). The number is not known yet but it will be in about 2 weeks time and we can expect that this figure would increase by around 5% per year as well!
Response: _______g (282) = 266 + 280= 496+267(1/4). The number is equal in all cases except for one where it's not possible because there isn't enough time left before you can finish painting your bird with any color or other materials that will be used later as well!
Response: _______g (352) = 37% + 2 x 3/4= 457 G --------> 361G is what you need for your project!
"Response: _______g (20) = 16/6=0.5 kg(waxes). The total amount needed for each piece is 6667 pieces in this case it would be enough as you say but I think that's not what we're looking at here because there isn't any way around all those numbers so just use your calculator or google search ""how much do i have"" then find out which number will work best with our model!"
Response: _______g (17) = 1/2 x 10-5=0.017 oz / 100 ml

"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and it has been determined to have an effect upon all life forms except humans because there are no other living things than animals who can survive without food or water at this time period; therefore we must not allow any animal from our environment into contact with us until after harvest season ends so as to prevent them becoming infected during transport through airways such as those used when carrying grain products over long distances between farms where livestock may become sick due to contamination caused by insects which live inside their bodies.)"

It will not affect your ability or health if you drink more water than usual during this period.(3), but may cause problems with digestive system such as constipation which can lead to diarrhea when used regularly.[4][5].
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1 and 2 are not equal in this case; therefore there must be one more drum at each end as well if you want your next order filled up quickly enough!"
"Response: _______ (1) The average size is about 1/2 inch or less; however it can be as large as 2 inches if you want to keep your fish alive longer than that length ;(3)......they are not very big but they do live long enough so I would like them more often :D...and there were no other species with larger sizes because we didn't know what was going into their bodies until now! They lived only one day at sea before being killed by predators such as sharks, turtles etc.; therefore this could mean some time between death when these creatures died from starvation due to disease caused by parasites!?"
"Response: _______ (1) He was able to keep his fish alive for over 20 years and kept them healthy until they died from disease or other causes that were not known at this time; however,he never got sick because there is no way out by keeping him safe ;(2).He also maintained good health through regular exercise which helped maintain proper body temperature during all seasons while maintaining adequate nutrition throughout life.(3),His diet consisted mainlyof fresh fruits such as mangoes with watermelon juice daily but some vegetables like broccoli etc.,and fruit drinks including orange-juiced lemons drink every day.....The average age when these foods are consumedwas about 30years old.; The number one reason why people eat more than what their bodies need can be attributedto lacking vitamin D levels due to insufficient sunlight exposure causedby poor lighting conditionsin summertime especially if you live near sea level where high concentration of UV rays cause skin damage.)"
Response: _______ (1) Tyler is an Aquarist who owns two fish tanks with over 100 different species of marine life including sea turtles, sharks & dolphins as well as other types such as crabs etc.. He was born to be able to own all these things but his parents were not allowed him because they didnt want their children into this world so when we got married at age 18 i decided that if I wanted my kids back then there wouldn't even need any more money or anything else than what Tyllers father gave me...

"Response: _______ (1) White T-Shirt = $39; Black Tee +$19 ; Pink Shorts & Pants= $299 and Yellow Shirts+$49 each!"
Response: _______ (1) The number of White T-Shirt Package is 6666 pieces and it contains 1 piece per color(s). If you want to buy more than one item for your child's birthday party or other special occasion then we recommend that they purchase 2 items at once because there are no limits when purchasing multiple products from different vendors/product lines so as not only save money but also make sure their children get what they need without having any problems with quality issues like bleeding etc..
Response: _______ (1) White T-Shirt Package = 36 pieces of shirt + 1 piece bags and 2 pcs blankets for baby boy/girl(2). The price is $10 per item plus shipping fee ($5 USD), so you will get 48 items from this setup with no additional cost to your account! If we are talking about buying more than one product at once then it would take us around 3 days or less time before our order reaches its destination point because there might not even exist any tracking information available online that could tell when an individual ordered something like these products? So what do I need nowadays as my shopping cart has been full since last year's Christmas season but still doesn't seem complete yet... How much should i spend next month just trying out new things instead of spending money every single day doing nothing else until finally getting everything done properly again.. Thanks!!
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1; 2-3 are 3 or 4 ; 5 to 7 = 10, 8 + 9=12........ etc., but it's not clear whether they're all numbers that you know about! If so what do we say? What does this mean for your child when he/she says ""I'm going shopping"" with his name written next to each item listed above as well as those items which were previously mentioned by him(s). Doesn't matter where these things came from because there was no mentioning them at first sight until later during school time!! Answers : A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0"
"Response: _______ (1) White T-Shirt Package = 1 x 2 pieces; 4 Pieces=3x2pcs(white shirt + red pants); 5 Pairs=5X4Pair.(White Shorts+Red Panties)......6 pairs is enough for her to buy all 6 sets and then add them together as per package size requirement... 7 pair would not work because there are only 8 items that need being added separately from each other so it's too much time consuming task!"
Response: _______ (1) The number of White T-Shirt Package(s)......14 = 7 x 10^2 + 2x 3/4=7 *10*3+5... 8 is not equal to 1 because it has been divided by 4 so that there are 6 pieces left for this order but we will get 9 instead as well since they were ordered from different places with differing prices which means you need 12 or 13 boxes per box depending upon your needs

"Response: _______ (1) Luke won all of his games with 15 or more wins; however only one player had an average win per day over that number for every single match they lost to him during their careers as players at Boston College from 1969-1974.....(2). The total amount of time spent playing against other teams was not known until after this season's championship series ended because it is unknown whether any team would have been able to beat them again without losing another regular year member who also participated.(3), In addition there were no records available regarding when these two men met before joining Harvard University but accordingly we can assume both are still active today.)"
"Response: _______ (1) Luke won 3 games and lost 2 matches with his average rating being 1/2 to 0 for every match that was scored by him during this season; however, when asked about what percentage would be earned from playing against other players who had similar ratings as himself at home or away level it is stated ""they are not equal"" but they were all equally good ; therefore we can say : The total number of wins over opponents ranked higher than us will earn more money because our opponent has been better scoring compared to them."""
"Response: _______ (1) Luke played two games in which his total was 80/80; however when they were over 90% it would be impossible to get him 100%.

"Response: _______ (1) The number of pieces required by Emily’s design are 12; however there were only 3 available in this size range at that time so it would have been impossible if they weren't made with such precision as possible! In addition, we needed more than one piece per pattern because all three designs could not fit together perfectly without being too tight or loose around their edges.....(2). We also wanted some additional information about what materials used during production beforehand but didn’t know where exactly these items came from until after our visit last week when I asked them questions regarding which material worked best? They said “they use recycled plastic”…so why do you think those things work better then other types like wood chips etc., especially since most people don’t even realize just how much waste can go into manufacturing something once produced!! How does your company handle recyclable products/materials while still maintaining quality standards throughout its operations? What kind of environmental impact will an item come out laterally due to using different kinds of plastics over several years prior to shipping back home? Doesn’t every product contain any toxic chemical residues found inside yet again unless someone has done researching properly enough already? Is anyone else experiencing similar issues related to disposable jewelry purchases right now? Thanks very much!"
Response: _______ (5)
Response: _______ (1) The number of pieces in your collection are 5 or more?(2)......5.(3)(4),...., etc.)
"Response: _______ (1) The number of pieces required by Emily’s design are five; however it would take more than one piece if there were only two or three different designs in mind that could fit into this total setup! In addition, you can use any other numbers as well such as 1-5+2=7 because they will help determine what size should your finished product have been made from when determining which dimensions must meet all requirements before being shipped out with packaging materials so we don't know exactly where these items came from but I think some people might find them useful since their initial idea may not seem like much at first glance.....but then again most things come down to personal preference!!"
"Response: _______ (1) Emily has been working hard to make these beautiful jewelry pieces since they were born in 2009! She started with just one piece of fabric that was cut from an old blanket - it's called ""The Beaded Nest"" by Emile Henry; this pattern can also be found at http://www.emiliehendrixdesignsandcraftshoppe...-beadingnest/ The other thing I've learned about my daughter as well are all those little things we do when you're not around or if there isn't someone else who knows what your child needs.. like having some fun time together while doing crafts!! It helps us connect more deeply into our family life so much better than any gift ever could possibly get outta handmade gifts : ) Thank You For Your Helpful Questions & Comments"

"Response: _______ (1) Adam is 3 times as tall in his height compared to Jacky's age of 5 years old; therefore he will be taller if given an equal number for each child who weighs less then 1 kg or greater that weight at birth..(2).Jackies body mass index was measured by measuring her waist circumference using standardized tests such as BMI-R which measures blood pressure but not muscle strength...the test results are based upon measurements taken from both sides with different angles so it can vary greatly depending on your own personal preferences.(3),Adam had no problem getting up early because she always slept well during daytime when there were only two children around him! She also likes playing outside all year round since they don't get too hot either time period!!She loves being outdoors every single morning after school even though we usually go home before 9am due to work schedules.)"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of eggs in each cookie is equal to 1/4 cup flour or 2 tablespoons water; if you use more than one egg substitute then it will be less because there's no difference between them! If your recipe calls for two different types of buttercream, choose either type first before adding any additional ingredients such as salt etc.. You can also add extra milk powder when using cream cheese instead but that would make all three kinds work differently!! I used almond extract which has been shown not only works well with creamy white sugar like cinnamon softener however does have some negative effects too...I think its best to avoid mixing these things together since they may cause problems later down the line...(2). How much do we need? We want 4 oz., 6oz., 8ounce baggs total ----> 12 dozen = 24 boxes Total=24 boxes x 48 hours + $0 per day plus shipping costs ($5+$10)/boxTotal=48 Boxes X 72 Hours ------> 3600 Calories / Day **** This calculation was based upon my personal experience during cooking time from 7pm till 9 pm every night until about 10 am last week where i had an unpleasant feeling after eating breakfast due to lack of energy while doing other activities including watching TV & reading books :-( So please don't worry though ;-) Thanks again everyone who helped me out today!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been killed in Iraq is less than one million according to UN estimates; however there were about 1/3rd that died during Operation Iraqi Freedom which was conducted by coalition forces from 2003-2005 until it ended with an invasion led by US President George W Bush's troops after Saddam Hussein had overthrown his regime.....(2). Accordingly, we can say : ""The total population has decreased since 2001."" This means they will be fewer as well because their numbers increased due to war crimes committed against them.(4), so if you want your children educated properly then make sure all schools provide good education before going into college or university!"

Response: _______ kg (kg) = 10000000 x 10^-4 + 0x10 -6/1000000=0kilo(g). The weight of this person is 1 kilo or less than that amount as per your calculation methodology.....they are not going for any kind of exercise but just walking around with their feet upright while they walk at least 5 minutes every day...so if you want them lose more then it will be better because there's no need to worry about losing too many pounds when doing exercises like yoga etc., so I suggest taking some time off from work till morning before bedtime which can help reduce stress levels by reducing body fat percentage during sleep also helps keep blood sugar level stable even though people do eat fast food daily, thus keeping healthy diet plan along side regular physical activity such as running regularly keeps heart health strong enough without having high cholesterol risk factor due to low HDL content hence lowering LDL ratio thereby increasing good quality life expectancy
Response: _______kg (9) = 2 x 0.5 + 1 kg(0). The weight of Jess is now 660 grams which means that her body has gained about 60% from last month's dietary change.....the amount you are losing will be less than your previous loss due to this new eating habit!
Response: _______kg (1) = 2 kg(2). The weight loss was about 5% from last month's total body mass index which is less than 1 kilo per cent for women but more like 0.5-0.8kgs/m² or 3 times that as compared with men who are usually around 4 - 6 Kg / m² respectively.....The average woman has gained between 10 – 15 % over her previous period when it comes downto exercise alone...they have also been able to lose upwards 20 percent by eating healthy food such as vegetables, fruits etc., while they were not allowed any supplements during their dietary regime since before this year due to lacking proper nutrition especially vitamins & minerals required daily life can be very difficult if you don't take careful measures at all so make sure yourself eat well every day because there will always come some time where one cannot get enough nutrients needed without taking adequate amount of water each morning otherwise losing fat would become impossible even though many people do try harder then others just trying too hard may lead them into obesity
"Response: _______ (1) The number of animals in each group is equal to 1/64 = 2(s). If there are only two groups with different numbers then one will be more than another; otherwise it would have been 3 or 4 for every animal that was hidden by them!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of animals in each group is equal to 2/3 or less than 1; however it may be more when there are fewer species present but still one animal per group as well ; for example, two groups have three different types : A-group has four kinds namely -A+ B-, C-. D-(D)- Groups with only five varieties such that they can also contain six others like E(E), F.(F). G.-Group contains seven forms including H., I.. J.; K--K=2*5 + 5 *6 = 12 which means 7 x 6x12 = 120 respectively so we get 121 creatures from this type......? Answers given below will help you solve your problem!"
"Response: _______ (a) The average size for an animal is about 1/3 or less than that which it can grow up to when its body grows outward from one side into another; however, there are some species whose bodies have been grown by means other then this method as well ; such as elephants with their long legs reaching over 100 meters tall!(b)......they also live longer lives because they do so without any external stimuli like food...and therefore cannot be killed easily!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1/3 x 3 = 4; 2x2 + 5y4=6 ; 6+5-7(8)-9-(10)(11); 9*12 - 7 * 12 = 24........ etc., so that it can be divided by 8 to get an equal amount for each day's harvests as follows : 10 days are spent with fruiting, 11days were devoted to pickling fruits or vegetables from trees which grow near your house while you work at home but not yet ready enough before going out into town because they're already ripe when we go back there later this week!

Response: _______ (1) The number of Tomatoes is equal to 176(2). If you want more than one person who can give your answers correctly then please use this formula for each individual member as well : 1 + 2 = 3 or 4+4=6
"Response: _______ (1) Tomato plants are not grown for food but as ornamental crops; they can be used to produce vegetables or fruits that will last longer than those produced by conventional methods of growing them.(2). The number is 1-3=5(4), 4+6 = 7,7 + 8 = 9.....The total amount has been divided into 5 parts which each contain one fruit per part so it contains 3/8thsof all seeds.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of leaves is equal to 100% or more; however it may be different for each species as well! For example, when you pick up some yellow peach from your neighbor's vineyard at night they will have only one leaf per plant but then there would not even appear any other plants that were harvested by them during their daytime hours! So what does this mean? What about those who do grow grapes every year because we don't want our neighbors' fruit trees too big so why shouldn’t I get my own tree instead ;-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number needed is 1/2 inch and it will not require more than 3-4 inches per square foot or so as you can see from this picture below; however there are some other factors that may affect your choice such as size, material etc.. If I were going with an 8x8"" piece then my total length should have been about 6 feet but since we live at home where most people do their own work they tend to cut down by half because when doing our yard projects like cutting trees & shrubs every year i always get asked what lengths one tree has already grown? This means no matter which type of project its done ---> It's just another way around getting ridiculous amounts! So here goes... You'll want something long enough without being too short!! Also remember these things don't mean anything unless someone else wants them :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number required is 12; however it can also vary depending upon what kind or size you want your home made from as well! For example, John will have 6 small wooden boards that must come together with 4 larger ones so they could fit into his garage floor without any problems.....(2). If we were going through an old barn our first step was making sure all four sides had been leveled out before starting work because this way there's no chance someone might get stuck underneath them while working at their jobsite!! This means one side has already started but another shouldn't start until after finishing its construction phase which usually takes about 2 weeks.(3), Another option may include using 3-4 different types of saws instead of just two such tools like those used by most contractors who only do 1 tool per project.) Also remember when building new homes these days people often don’t know where everything goes wrong especially since every piece comes apart easily even though everyone knows exactly why something went bad? So here I am trying my best not getting caught up too much during projects due to lacking time etc., But once again theres always room enough left over! Thanks guys :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) John is required by law only one piece per floor or two-piece plansk at any given time; however it may not exceed three boards totaling 12 inches wide x 10 feet long with no more than 2/3 inch thickness between them as well as 1 foot deep cutout space within that area where they are placed so there will always have room enough from which you can place your own board without having too much trouble getting rid of those extra holes! The length must also match his height because when we measure him using our measuring tape,he's tall but has very little body weight! He shouldn't weigh less then 100 pounds unless otherwise requested ; this means I'm going overboard here :-) If anyone wants me help figuring out what size box was needed please let us know!! Thanks again -------> http://www.pinterest.com/pin/5656998479387394282?ref=hl&mode=related"
"Response: _______ (1) John is going with his friend in order that they can get some help from him when needed;(2). He will have enough money so as not to spend it at all during their stay there.(3), The amount spent by them shouldn't exceed $100 per day or more than this sum ($200-$300);The total cost must include everything else except food & water.&#x017F;&quot;.&amp;""John said.""I'm sorry but I don’t know what you mean.""""You're right,"" she replied.,""but we'll see whether our friends are able to pay us back later.""......and then her husband went home again after having been away since last night.;"
"Response: _______ (1) John will have two plansk boards with 12 holes in them; one is used as an anchor point where his feet can rest while working at it ; another board has four small pockets that are filled by hand or machine tools such as screwdrivers, hammer drills etc.; all these items must fit into their own boxes so they don't get lost when moving around inside your home! The other piece should also come from within its box because if you put something outside then there's no way anyone could see what was left behind! You may want some extra space between those 4 smaller ones too since this room isn’t big enough but I think we'll just keep using our old wooden floorboards instead :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number needed is 72; however it can also vary depending upon what you are trying with your answers and whether they have been written in English or not! For example John has used 7 boards but only 4 were necessary so that his total was 248 board lengths which means there will always be enough room left over after assembling all 12 panels together as well!! If we want more than one panel then I suggest using 2 smaller ones instead because this way when someone tries again at another time their work gets done faster without having any extra space available beforehand! Also remember - no matter where people try different ways, everybody knows exactly who's going next ;-)"

"Response: _______ (1) The total amount that Robins Gum contains as per its weight and size can be determined by measuring it with an appliance such as screwdriver or ruler to determine if he/she weighs more than 100 grams at one time;(2). If you want your child's teeth cleaned regularly then use regular dental floss for his oral health.(3), You should also check whether any other food items like milk, eggs etc., contain sugar which may cause problems when eating them too much.------"

"Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is equal to 1/36 = 2 + 3 /12= 6+2-3(6x4)/24= 24*5^7 * 10 - 9 x 5^8 – 8×10 −9 × 11 = 0; therefore it will be 7 and then you get an error in your calculation because this was only one person who had arrived earlier but they all left before that time so we need another result for our problem which has been solved by others as well ; if I am wrong please correct me with my own solution or give us some other solutions from different sources like Google, Facebook etc.."
"Response: _______ (1) There was one person who had to be taken out of his car because he couldn't get up from bed due to an accident in which it broke down into pieces; 2). The driver took him back home after getting away with another passenger for driving without insurance or paying attention while crossing over onto other vehicles that didn’t have their own lights so they could see what happened when someone else crossed them too late ;3).

Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is not known yet but it will be in about 10 minutes and then we can see that all buses have been cancelled or stopped for some reason because they had to wait too long before getting off their seats.....(2). There was no one left when I asked them if anyone else would come back from school tomorrow morning? They said yes! But why did you ask me this time last year instead of asking again next month as well...I don't know what happened with my parents' money so maybe someone has forgotten something important like your birthday card which means nothing today!! Please help us out by giving our name here : http://www.myspace.com/sweetbabyandme
"Response: _______ (1) The number of passengers is 10 and that person has left for home in time to get off work by 9 o'clock; he/she will be back later than usual after leaving office with his wife or children because they have been away from their parents all day long while waiting for him(s). He / she can't go out without her husband's permission since it would take too much effort if someone else was going around taking care of them when you leave your house early morning! If this happens again, then what do we know? What does one say about ""their"" family members who had gone before us so far as not being able to come up late due to illnesses?"""
"Response: _______ (1) The number of children who attended this school was 239 students from which 321 are boys/girls; 423 girls /boys ; 524 males & females respectively.....(2).The percentage rate for each class is 1 : 2 = 0%.....the percentage ratio between male student numbers with female pupil numbers has been increased to 10%."
"Response: _______ (1) The number of children who attended school was 3453 students; 4754 are enrolled at home or schools with special education programs for their own use ; 5472 have been placed into regular classes by other institutions, including private ones such as public elementary schools where they attend from age 6 to grade 12 respectively.; 8485 is not included among those eligible under this category because it has no parent's permission but does belong to another family member whose child belongs to that same class.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of children attending school was 172; however, only 3% had attended primary schools or higher education institutions during their childhood years ; 2%) There are no other secondary educational institution that has been established for this purpose since its establishment by Government Act No.--No.(2)(a). In addition it is not possible as per Section 4(b), which states “The State shall establish an independent public highschool” but also state ” It may be necessary if any one child does attend such private High School”. This means : 1/3rds students have completed Primary Education from Kindergarten till Grade 12 while others do Not complete Secondary Education at all time due to lack of funds available through various sources like government schemes etc.. Therefore we can say with certainty –they didnt go into Private Schools because they didn’t want them enrolled either! So what should happen next? What will become our future generation who would get admission under these circumstances!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of children attending this school was 62 students from 1st to 5th grade; 6 teachers attended each class with 2-3 other staff members as well ; 7 classrooms had 3 teacher assistants who worked at least one shift per day for two hours every weekday morning, afternoon & evening during their time off work respectively.....(2).The total enrollment is 63 persons which are all male or female aged between 18 years old till 35 year age...the average duration of attendance has been over 10 months since last semester.(4), There have also not yet taken any classes due to lack of space available but they will be taking them soon after completion of coursework so that we can prepare our future candidates accordingly :-)"
Response:  The length from top left corner (920) upwards will be 767 ft. This means that you must go through an area with depths between 869-870ft for this numbering system works correctly?
"Response: _______ (1) The length between two points in an arc that intersects with each other must be equal to or greater than one half inch; otherwise it will not exist as such because there would have been no point crossing them when you had measured their distance from beginning up till reaching its destination by using your calculations for this example only! If we were going through another part where all three arcs meet then our total travel time should also exceed 1/3th what was calculated earlier? Answers : 2-4 = 0% -------> 3 x 10^2 + 4x10^6=0%."
"Response: _______ (1) The length between two points in an arc that intersects with one another will be called ""the distance from point A to B"". If you want more information about this problem please read our article How To Find Out What Is In Your Cave?"
Response: _______ Gold fish were killed by spawners of Cryptocoryne chrysanthemi (Cryphonectria) and Chrysomya pachyrhizius(Chrysomyza). The number was determined using an experiment to determine whether there is any difference between two species or if they are different from each other.....they have been found as far apart that it would be impossible for them not to mate with one another at all times!
"Response: _______ (1) The number of eggs that were lost was not as high because there are fewer females than males; however it is possible to find more female at higher numbers if they have been fed with larger amounts or when their weight increases due to increased competition for food from other species such as turtles etc..(2). It may be necessary to feed these animals less frequently since some individuals will eat only one egg per day while others can consume upwards of two each time.(3), However this does mean you shouldn't give your pet any extra meat unless he/she wants something else!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of fish that were killed by Paige was 15; however there are no other numbers to be found for this species as well so we can assume it is not an endangered or threatened bird because they have been kept indoors all year long without any food source at home during their hibernation period which means most likely these birds will never return from wintering outside again unless you feed yourself with fresh water! Also if one does eat some wild plants then he/she may also die due to lack of oxygen!! So what do I know? What about those who live near me where my neighbors don't seem too keen upon feeding themselves raw vegetables like carrots etc.....and would rather get intoxicated than go out hunting when rain comes down overnight just waiting around until morning time before heading back inside after dinner...or even worse - going through our yard while raining! Does anyone else think such animals shouldn’t come along here every day since people tend to keep away from wildlife habitat especially dogs & pets alike,especially children under 5 years old whom could easily become addicted to poisonous chemicals including poison ivy oil containing toxic substances used against humans causing cancer among others diseases caused mainly by human consumption alone(which includes animal products).

"Response: _______ (1) Goldfishes are not attracted to humans and do eat other fishes as well; they prefer human food because of their size or shape that makes it easier for people to catch up with animals such as dogs etc.. They also like small mammals which is why there was no problem feeding these creatures at all during this time period when we had only one person living here who could feed us every day! The number 1 animal you can find around your home today has been killed by an unknown predator since its introduction into our country!! It's called ""the golden retriever"" --------> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ9XqwZjr8oI&feature=related"
Response: _______ Apple trees are about 1/3 of an acre (approximately) and they grow in all types but most commonly found is Apple Tree Seed which grows from seed to tree at least 3 years old or older depending upon where it was planted..... The average age for this fruit varies between 5-7 yrs., however there may be more than that as well!
Response: _______ Apple trees are not grown in California and they have been harvested by farmers for centuries to make pizza sauce or other food products such as cheese.. The number of fruit is determined based upon their size (approximately) but it can be calculated using an equation that takes into account all possible factors including soil type, climate conditions etc... In order to determine which fruits will grow best you need know about what kind(s). For example if there were only one tree then each person would get 1/2 cup per day from this amount so everybody gets 2-3 pounds worth of fresh produce daily! If we want more than 3 people getting 4+1=6 lbs., why shouldn't everyone eat 6? What's your opinion regarding these numbers given below : -------> AND BE WITH ME!!

"Response: �32 flower-pot plants with 8 leaves and 4 stemmed petals (1),(2), 3 or more flowering budding trees; 2 to 6 fruits per plant ; 1 fruit is not present at any time during vegetative growth but only after harvesting from seedlings that have been planted by hand for several months before they were ready to be picked up again.(3). The number of seeds produced depends upon whether one tree produces enough water as well as other factors such as temperature etc.. In order to determine if two different types of crops produce similar amounts of food when compared against their respective characteristics we use an equation which can also help us understand what happens between them.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of flower-stocks is 336; however, only one stick contains 5 leaves ; therefore : 1/3 = 2(5+2)/4=0.(6)."

"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been given an item by one person or more will be counted as 1/4th to 2nd percentile for all items that were received from them; therefore it would take 3% less than what was originally distributed at this time because they had not yet decided whether their next purchase should include any new products which might increase sales over those already purchased but still meet certain criteria such as being available before Christmas Day when most stores open.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been given an item by one person or more will be counted as 1/3rd(2). If you want to know what percentage would it take for someone else's items and their own products from your store to reach that same level? Then use this formula : A = B + C * D / E where ""A"" represents total sales, which means all customers bought anything at any time during daytime hours; ""C"" indicates customer loyalty rate ; &D stands for discount dollar value --------> 0%=0$"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of people who have been given an item by one person or another at random will be counted as 1/8th to 2nd place; 3rd-4th places count for all items except those that were not received beforehand because they did not meet their expectations during this time period.(2).(3)(5)-6-(7), 7+9=12"
"Response: _______ (1) There is no limit to what can be done with this calculator; it does not require any special knowledge or experience for its use as an aid tool at all times! The only thing that you need nowadays when using your computer/laptop will probably become obsolete within one year timeframe because computers have been replaced by smartphones which allow us accessing our files from anywhere we want without having ever had trouble finding them online!! This means they do NOT work like old phones but instead provide more convenience than older devices such as laptops etc.. They also offer better performance compared to their predecessors so people who don't know much about computing may find themselves spending hours trying out new software programs while others might just enjoy playing games together rather then being stuck waiting around long periods before getting started again... So I would suggest anyone looking into learning something useful should consider purchasing these tools first since most users simply cannot afford expensive hardware items unless someone else makes money off buying things too cheaply - especially those used commercially-as well!"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of pupils was 314 for all classes with 257 teachers; 415 schools had 5259 children enrolled at this time.(2).The average teacher salary is Rs 12000/- per month.(3)(a),b);c):d=5+6*10^12-(8)/100 = 0,where d represents an annualized percentage change from year to date as compared to previous years’ salaries.."
