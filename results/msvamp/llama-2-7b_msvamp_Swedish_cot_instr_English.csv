Response:  On Monday (Måndag), Julia played with 18 children. On Tuesday (Tisdag), she played with 10 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  18 - 10 = 8 more children played with on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  On Monday (måndag), Julia played tag with 11 children. On Tuesday (tisdag), she played tag with 12 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Tuesday and Monday is:

12 - 11 = 1

Therefore, Julia played with 1 more child on Tuesday than she did on Monday."
Response:  If Julia played with 5 children on Monday and then some more children on Tuesday, that means she played with a total of 6 children (5 + however many she played with on Tuesday). So, if she played with 15 children in total, then she must have played with 9 children on Tuesday (15 - 6 = 9).
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and she played with a total of 16 children, then she must have played with 2 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday. So, Julia played with 14 + 2 = 16 children on Monday.
"Response:  If Julia played with 16 children on Monday and added 12 more children than she did on Tuesday, then the number of children she played with on Tuesday is:

16 + (12 - x) = 38

Where ""x"" represents the number of children Julia played with on Monday. Solving for ""x"", we get:

x = 16 - 12 = 4

Therefore, Julia played with 4 children on Tuesday."
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and added 8 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday, then we can conclude that Julia played with 22 children on Monday (14 + 8 = 22).
Response:  On Monday (15 barn), Tuesday (20 barn) and Wednesday (17 barn), Julia played with a total of 42 children. Therefore, she played with 42 children in total.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 15 children. So, she played with X = 15 children on Monday.  On Tuesday, she played with 18 children, so she played with X = 18 children on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, she played with 97 children, so she played with X = 97 children on Wednesday. Now we have three equations: 15x + 18x + 97x = 15 + 18 + 97 =? (We can simplify this equation by combining like terms.)  Solving for x, we get: x = 30. Therefore, Julia played with 30 children on Monday and Tuesday combined.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with five children. So, she played with 5 children on Monday.  On Tuesday, she played with nine children, so she played with 9 children on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, she played with 15 children, so she played with 15 children on Wednesday. Therefore, Julia played with 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children in total.
Response:  On Monday (14 barn), Tuesday (20 barn - 14 barn = 6 barn) and Wednesday (16 barn). So, Julia played with 6 + 6 = 12 barn on those days.
Response:  On Monday (monday), Julia played with 9 barn.  On Tuesday (tisdag), she played with 7 barn. And on Wednesday (onsdag), she played with 96 barn. So, we can see that Julia played with more barn on Wednesday than on Monday and Tuesday combined. Therefore, the difference between the number of barn Julia played with on Monday and the number of barn she played with on Wednesday is: 9 - (9 + 7) = 96 - 16 = 80 barn.
"Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 14 children. On Tuesday, she played with 2 children. And on Wednesday, she played with 8 children. So, we can calculate how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Wednesday as follows:
Monday - Wednesday = (14 - 8) = 6
Therefore, Julia played with 6 more children on Monday than on Wednesday."
Response:  On Monday (Måndag), Julia played with eight children.  On Tuesday (Tisdag), she played with eleven children more than she did on Monday, so she played with nineteen children (eight + eleven = nineteen).  On Wednesday (Onsdag), she played with nine children fewer than she did on Tuesday, so she played with ten children (nineteen - nine = ten). Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday and on Wednesday is ten.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 15 children. Then she had 18 more children playing with her on Tuesday. Finally, she had 7 children playing with her on Wednesday. So, in total, Julia played with 30 more children than on Wednesday (15 + 18 = 33). Therefore, the difference between the number of children who played with Julia on Monday and Tuesday is 33 - 7 = 26.
Response:  On Monday (Måndag), Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday (Tisdag), she played with 10 children. On Wednesday (Onsdags), she played with 15 children. Therefore, Julia played with a total of 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.
Response:  On Monday (monday), she played with 7 children + 13 children = 20 children. On Tuesday (tisdag), she played with 20 children. So in total, she played tag with 20 + 20 = 40 children.
"Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 12 children for x hours. On Tuesday, she played with 14 children for y hours, where y > x (since there are more children). The total time spent playing tag is given as 34 hours. So we can set up the equation:
x + y = 34... (1)
Now, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy this equation. We know that x < y, since Julia played with fewer children on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, we can write:
0 < y - x < 34... (2)
Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 6, y = 28... (3)
So, Julia played with 12 children for 6 hours on Monday and 14 children for 28 hours on Tuesday. In total, she spent 34 hours playing tag with both groups of children."
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 19 children and spent 19 hours playing tag. On Tuesday, she played with 18 children and spent 20 hours playing tag. So, Julia spent more time playing tag with 18 children than with 19 children. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is 1 (19 - 18 = 1).
Response:  On Monday (monday), Julia played with six children.  On Tuesday (tisdag), she played with five children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  6 - 5 = 1 child. Therefore, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played with 18 children in total. On Monday, she played with 4 children. So, the number of children she played with on Tuesday is: 18 - 4 = 14. Therefore, she played with 14 children on Tuesday.
Response:  On Wednesday (onsdags), Julia played with four children.  On Monday (måndag), she played with six children. So, we can say that Julia had more children playing with her on Monday than on Wednesday. The difference between these two numbers is:  6 - 4 = 2 Therefore, there were 2 more children playing with Julia on Monday than on Wednesday.
Response:  If Bobby had eaten 25 pieces of candy at first and then he ate another 18 pieces, we can say that he had a total of 25 + 18 = 43 pieces of candy in his stomach. So, he had eaten 43 - 25 = 18 pieces of candy initially.
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 gumdrops and then he ate 42 more. So in total, he ate 28 + 42 = 70 gumdrops. Then, he also ate 63 chocolate bits. Therefore, the number of gumdrops Bobby ate is 70.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 gummibears. Then he ate four more. So, in total, he ate 33 + 4 = 37 gummibears.  Similarly, he ate 14 chocolate pieces. So, in total, he ate 37 + 14 = 51 candies.
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 gummibears and then he ate 36 more. So in total, he ate 74 gummibears (38 + 36). Then, he also ate 16 chocolate pieces. Therefore, the number of gummibears Bobby ate is 74.
Response:  Bobby first ate 20 gumdrops. Then he ate an additional 34 gumdrops. Finally, he ate another 18 gumdrops. So in total, Bobby ate 20 + 34 = 54 gumdrops.
Response:  Bobby had initially 21 pieces of candy and then he ate 5 pieces. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy left. Then, he ate another 9 pieces, so now he has 16 - 9 = 7 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby has 7 pieces of candy left.
Response:  Bobby had initially 22 pieces of candy. If he ate some candy, then he had x pieces of candy left. Since he ate five more pieces of candy after that, he now has 8 pieces of candy left (x + 5 = 8). So, in the beginning, Bobby had eaten x = 14 pieces of candy (22 - 14 = 8).
Response:  If Bobby had 19 gumdrops and he ate two of them, then he has 17 left (19 - 2 = 17).
Response:  If Bobby had initially 32 pieces of candy and he ate some of them, then he has less candies now. So, if he has 20 pieces of candy left, that means he ate 12 pieces of candy (32 - 20 = 12). Therefore, Bobby has eaten 12 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Bobby had 36 pieces of candy to start with and he ate 17 at first, then he has 36 - 17 = 19 pieces of candy left. Then, if he ate another 15, he will have 19 - 15 = 4 pieces of candy left. So, Bobby has 4 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby had 30 gummies to start with and he ate 23 of them, then he has 7 remaining (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  Allan had five balloons and Jake had three balloons. So, in total, they have eight balloons (5 + 3). Now we need to find out how many more balloons Allan has than Jake. To do this, we subtract the number of balloons that Jake has from the number of balloons that Allan has: 8 - 3 = 5. Therefore, Allan has five more balloons than Jake in the park.
Response:  Allan took two balloons to the park and Jake took three balloons to the park. So, we can say that Allan has x fewer balloons than Jake in the park. Now, we know that Jake had 3 more balloons than Allan at the park. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x - 2 = 3. Solving for x, we get x = 5. So, Jake had 5 more balloons than Allan at the park.
Response:  If Allan took with two balloons to the park and he is one of the two people who went to the park (Allan og Jake), then Jake must have taken with him three balloons to the park since there are only three total balloons in all. So, Jake took with him three balloons to the park.
Response:  If Jake took with him six balloons to the park and he took four more than Allan did, then we can say that Allan took 6 - 4 = 2 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Allan took five balloons to the park and Jake took six more than Allan, then Jake took 11 balloons (6 - 5 = 11) to the park.
"Response: 
Allan had three ballons and took them to the park. So he had three ballons in the park initially. Then, he bought two more ballons. So now he has five ballons (three initial + two new). 
Jake also went to the park with five ballons. He did not buy any new ballons there. Therefore, Jake had five ballons at the park as well. In total, both Allan and Jake had five ballons each at the park."
"Response: 
Allan had two balloons initially and bought three more in the park. So, he has five balloons now (2 + 3 = 5).
Jake had four balloons initially.
So, the difference between the number of balloons Allan had and Jake had is:
Five - Four = One
Therefore, Allan had one more balloon than Jake in the park."
"Response: 
Allan had two balloons initially and bought three more in the park. So, he has five balloons now (2 + 3).
Jake had six balloons initially.
So, the difference between Jake's number of balloons and Allan's number of balloons is:
6 - 5 = 1
Therefore, Jake had one more balloon than Allan in the park."
"Response: 
Allan took five balloons to the park and then bought three more at the park. So, he had taken + bought = 5 + 3 = 8 ballons to the park."
Response:  Allan had six balloons and Jake had two balloons initially. Then, Jake bought three more balloons in the park. So, now Jake has five balloons (two he already had + three he just bought). Now, let's compare how many balloons Allan had to Jake's total number of balloons: 6 (Allan) vs 5 (Jake). Therefore, Allan had one more balloon than Jake in the park.
"Response: 
Allan had 6 ballons and Jake had 3 ballons initially. Then Jake bought 4 more ballons in the park, so now he has 7 ballons (3 + 4). Therefore, Jake has 7 ballons more than Allan in the park."
"Response: 
Allan took five balloons to the park and Jake took six balloons to the park. So far, they have taken a total of 11 balloons (5 + 6) to the park. Then, in the park, Jake bought three more balloons. Therefore, the final number of balloons that Jake took with him to the park is 11 + 3 = 14 balloons."
Response:  Allan had 3 ballons and 20 balls, so he had in total 23 (3+20).  Jake had 5 ballons and 59 balls, so he had in total 64 (5+59). Therefore, Allan had 23 ballons and Jake had 64 ballons in the park.
Response:  Allan had 7 balls and 5 bollas, so he had in total 12 objects (balls + bollas).  Jake had 6 balls and 4 bollas, so he had in total 10 objects (balls + bollas).  In the park, both of them together had 22 objects (Allan's 12 + Jake's 10).
Response:  If Allan took five balloons to the park and he is taking them with him, then that means he has taken away one of the six balloons that Jake had. So now Jake has only five balloons left. Therefore, Jake took three balloons to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought two balloons to the park and bought three more, then he had a total of five balloons in the park (2 + 3 = 5).  Now, if Jake took six balloons to the park, then Jake had six balloons more than Allan in the park (6 - 5 = x), where x is the number of extra balloons that Jake had over Allan. Therefore, the correct answer is x = 1. So, Jake had one more balloon than Allan in the park.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese. Therefore, he spends more time studying English than Chinese. In total, he spends 6 + 2 = 8 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. So, he spends 8 hours/day - 2 hours/day = 6 hours/day learning English.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. So in total he spends 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day learning languages.
Response:  If Ryan reads English for three hours and Chinese for some hours every day, then he reads English for x hours per day, where x is the number of hours he spends reading Chinese. Since he reads both languages every day, we can assume that x is greater than or equal to 3 (the number of hours he spends reading English). Therefore, the total number of hours he spends reading Chinese in a day is x + 3 = x + 4 (since he also spends 3 hours reading English). So, if Ryan reads Chinese for y hours every day, then he has read Chinese for a total of y + 4 hours.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English and some time studying Chinese, then he spends total of x hours per day studying both languages combined. Since he wants to spend two more hours per day studying English than Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 7 + 2 - x (where x is the number of hours he spends studying Chinese)
Now, we are given that Ryan lays two more hours per day studying English than he does studying Chinese. So, we can substitute x = 7 + 2 into the above equation:
x = 7 + 2 - x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3 = -x
Therefore, Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying Chinese."
Response:  If Ryan spends five hours per day learning Chinese and some time learning English, then he spends total of x hours per day learning English. Since he increases his time spent on learning English by two hours, he now spends x + 2 hours per day learning English. So, the answer is x = 7 hours.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. If he learns for 5 days, how many total hours will he spend learning both languages combined?
To find out, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends on each language per day by the number of days he will learn them. So, in this case, it would be:
6 hours/day x 5 days = 30 hours (learning English)
7 hours/day x 5 days = 35 hours (learning Chinese)
Adding these two numbers together gives us the total number of hours Ryan will spend learning both languages: 30 + 35 = 65 hours."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. If he learns for two days, how many total hours will he spend learning English?
To find out, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends learning English each day by the number of days he learns it. So, in two days, he will have spent 6 x 2 = 12 hours learning English."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese. If he learns for 6 days in total, then:

English = 5 x 6 = 30 hours
Chinese = 4 x 6 = 24 hours
Total = 30 + 24 = 54 hours"
"Response: 
Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese.  Therefore, he learns for a total of 10 hours (4 + 6) per day.  Since there are 86 days in the period, Ryan learns for a total of 860 hours (10 x 86)."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, 7 hours per day learning Chinese, and 3 hours per day learning Spanish. So in total, he spends:

6 hours/day x 24 days = 144 hours learning English
7 hours/day x 24 days = 168 hours learning Chinese
3 hours/day x 24 days = 72 hours learning Spanish

Therefore, Ryan spends a total of:

144 + 168 + 72 = 384 hours learning all three languages combined."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 times as much time learning English as he does Chinese. So if he spends 3 hours per day learning Chinese, he spends 18 hours (6 x 3) per day learning English. Therefore, he spends 18 - 58 = 40 hours more per day learning Spanish than he does learning English."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English, which means he learns English for 14 hours in total (7 x 2).  He also spends 4 hours per day learning Spanish, which means he learns Spanish for 28 hours in total (4 x 7). Therefore, Ryan spends more time learning English than Spanish. The difference is 20 hours (28 - 7)."
"Response: 
Ryan spends two hours reading English every day and five hours studying Chinese. So he spends a total of 7 hours (2 + 5) studying languages each day.
Now, let's find out how many hours he spends learning Chinese compared to Spanish:
Chinese = 5 hours/day
Spanish = 4 hours/day
So, Ryan spends 5 hours/day learning Chinese and 4 hours/day learning Spanish. Therefore, he spends more time learning Chinese than Spanish."
Response:  If Ryan spends three hours learning English every day and two hours learning Chinese every day, then he spends a total of five hours (3 + 2) learning languages each day.
"Response: 
Ryan spends four hours reading English each day (4 x 7 = 28). He also spends five hours reading Chinese each day (5 x 7 = 35). Therefore, he reads a total of 63 hours of English and Chinese in seven days."
Response:  On Monday, she had 8 baskets with cans. If she found 7 more baskets with cans next day, then total number of baskets with cans = 8 + 7 = 15. So, she had 15 more baskets than she found next day.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 7 baskets with cans. If she found additional 12 baskets with cans next day, then total number of baskets with cans she found is : 7 + 12 = 19. So, she found 19 more baskets than she had on Monday.
"Response: 
Tiffany had four bags of cans on Monday and found more bags with cans next day. So, she had six bags in total.  Therefore, she found 6 + 4 = 10 bags of cans next day."
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had some boxes with bottles. The next day, she found four more boxes with bottles. If she had a total of 8 boxes, how many boxes did she have on Monday?  Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had ten boxes of cans. If she found three more boxes with cans next day, then she had 10 + 3 = 13 boxes of cans total. And if she found seven more boxes with cans after that, then she had 13 + 7 = 20 boxes of cans total. So, Tiffany had 20 boxes of cans in total.
Response:  On Monday, she had 8 bags of cans. If she found 10 more bags with cans next day and 4 more bags with cans after that, then the total number of bags she found is: 8 + 10 + 4 = 22 bags. Therefore, she found 22 bags after Monday.
Response:  On Monday, she had 3 bags of cans. Then, she found additional 7 bags with cans and 44 bags with bottles. So, in total, she had 3 + 7 = 10 bags with cans.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 red pomegranates and 16 green pomegranates in the basket. To find out how many more red pomegranates than green ones are in the basket, we need to subtract the number of green pomegranates from the number of red ones:

17 - 16 = 1
So, there is one more red pomegranate than green ones in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 green persimmons and 5 red persimmons in the bag. So, we can write this as an equation:

Green = 11
Red = 5
Now, let's subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of persimmons to find out how many more green persimmons there are:

Total - Red = Green
26 (total) - 5 (red) = 21 (green)
Therefore, there are 21 more green persimmons than red persimmons in the bag."
Response:  If there are 10 red persimmons and 5 green persimmons in the bag, then the total number of persimmons is 10 + 5 = 15. So, there are 5 green persimmons in the bag.
Response:  If there are 3 red persimmons and some green persimmons in the bag, then the number of green persimmons is equal to the total number of persimmons minus the number of red persimmons. So, if there are 10 green persimmons in the bag, that means there are 10 - 3 = 7 red persimmons in the bag as well. Therefore, the final answer is 7 + 10 = 17 persimmons in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 3 types of persimmons in the bag: red, yellow and green.  The number of red persimmons is 7, the number of yellow persimmons is 15, and the number of green persimmons is 8. So, we can calculate the total number of persimmons as follows: Total = Red + Yellow + Green = 7 + 15 + 8 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 persimmons in the bag.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 green persimmons in the bag and we want to find out how many more green than red persimmons are in the bag. So let's count them separately:
Red Persimmons = 71
Green Persimmons = 8
Now, we can see that there are 8 green persimmons in the bag, which is more than the number of red persimmons (71). Therefore, the answer is: More than 71 green persimmons exist in the bag compared to the red ones."
Response:  We know that there are 6 gula persikors in the bag and 2 red persikors. Therefore, we have a total of 8 persikors (6 + 2). Now, let's count how many green persikors are present: According to the question, there are 14 green persikors in the bag. So, the number of green persikors is greater than the number of gula persikors. In other words, there are more green persikors than gula persikors in the bag. The difference between these two numbers can be calculated as follows: Number of green persikors - Number of gula persikors = 14 - 6 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more green persikors than gula persikors in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red pomegranates and 11 yellow pomegranates in the basket. To find out how many more red than yellow there are, we can subtract their numbers: 19 - 11 = 8. So, there are 8 more red pomegranates than yellow ones in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red persimmons and 16 green persimmons in the bag. So, we can write this as an equation: 6r + 16g = x, where x is the total number of persimmons in the bag. Now, we are asked to find out how many red and green persimmons are in the bag. To do this, we need to solve for r and g separately using the above equation. For example, to find out how many red persimmons are in the bag, we can substitute x = 6 into the equation: 6r + 16g = 6. Solving for r gives us: r = 4. Therefore, there are 4 red persimmons in the bag. Similarly, to find out how many green persimmons are in the bag, we can substitute x = 16 into the equation: 6r + 16g = 16. Solving for g gives us: g = 8. Therefore, there are 8 green persimmons in the bag.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red pomegranates and 14 yellow pomegranates in the basket. So, we can write this as an equation:

Red pomegranates = 18
Yellow pomegranates = 14
Now, let's find out how many green pomegranates are in the basket. According to the question, there are 17 green pomegranates in the basket. Therefore, we can add this value to our previous equations:

Total number of pomegranates = Red + Yellow + Green
= 18 + 14 + 17
= 59
So, there are 59 pomegranates in total - 18 red, 14 yellow, and 17 green."
Response:  We know that there are 6 green persimmons in the bag and 14 golden persimmons. So, we can calculate the total number of persimmons as follows: Green persimmons = 6 x 100% = 60%. Golden persimmons = 14 x 100% = 140%. Total number of persimmons = (Green + Golden) / 2 = (60 + 140) / 2 = 80. Therefore, there are 80 grüne und gelbe Persikos in der Korb.
Response:  We know that there are 65 korgar and each korg has either red or green persimmons. So, we can say that the total number of persimmons is 65 x (7 + 3) = 65 x 10 = 650 persimmons. Therefore, there are 650 persimmons in each korg.
Response:  We know that there are 11 korgar of persimmons and each korg has 10 red persimmons and 18 green persimmons. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of red persimmons = 10 x 11 = 110 Total number of green persimmons = 18 x 11 = 208 Therefore, the total number of persimmons in all 11 korgars is 110 + 208 = 318 persimmons.
Response:  We know that there are six korgars and each korg has 16 red persimmons and 18 green persimmons. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of red persimmons = Number of korgars x Number of red persimmons per korg Total number of green persimmons = Number of korgars x Number of green persimmons per korg Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Total number of red persimmons = 6 x 16 = 96 Total number of green persimmons = 6 x 18 = 108 Therefore, there are 96 red persimmons and 108 green persimmons in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 korgar of persimmons and each korg has 10 red persimmons and 2 green persimmons. So, we can write this as an equation: 7k = 10r + 2g where k is the number of korgars, r is the number of red persimmons, and g is the number of green persimmons. Now we want to find out how many green persimmons are in one korg. To do this, we divide the total number of green persimmons (2) by the number of korgars (7): 2/7 = x where x is the number of green persimmons in one korg. Solving for x, we get x = 0.286 or approximately 3 green persimmons per korg. Therefore, there are 3 green persimmons in each of the 7 korgars.
Response:  We know that there are 4 red persimmons and 3 green persimmons in each of the korgs with persimmons. So, if we have x korgs with persimmons, then the total number of persimmons is 4x + 3x = 7x. Since there are 7 persimmons in all, we must have x = 7. Therefore, there are 7 korgs with persimmons.
Response:  We know that there are two korgar and each korg has four red peaches and some green peaches. So, in total, there are 8 red peaches (4 x 2 = 8) and X green peaches (where X is the number of green peaches in each korg). Since there are 12 peaches in all, we can write the equation: 8 + X = 12. Now, we need to find out what value of X satisfies this equation. Solving for X, we get: X = 4. Therefore, there are 4 green peaches in each korg.
Response:  We know that there are 16 persimmons in total and 13 of them are red. So, if some of them are green, then we can say that the number of green persimmons is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green persimmons in the basket.
Response:  If every korg has 19 red persimmons and 4 green persimmons, then there are 19 + 4 = 23 persimmons in each korg. Since there are 15 korgs, the total number of persimmons is 23 x 15 = 345.
Response:  We know that there are 10 persimmons in total and they are distributed equally among some baskets. So, if each basket has 4 red persimmons and 6 green persimmons, then we can calculate how many baskets have persimmons as follows: Number of baskets with persimmons = Total number of persimmons / (Number of red persimmons + Number of green persimmons) = 10 / (4 + 6) = 5 baskets. Therefore, there are 5 baskets with persimmons.
Response:  We know that there are 60 yellow persimmons and 2 red persimmons in the basket. If we subtract the number of red persimmons (2) from the total number of persimmons (60 + 2 = 62), we get the number of green persimmons: 62 - 2 = 60 green persimmons. Therefore, there are 60 more green persimmons than red persimmons in the basket.
Response:  If Jerry had four action figures initially and later added some more to make a total of eight, then he must have added six action figures to his collection. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.
Response:  If Jerry had initially 5 action figures on his shelf and later added 7 more, then he has a total of 5 + 7 = 12 action figures on his shelf now. So, originally, Jerry had 5 action figures on his shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had four action figures and 22 books on his shelf. So he had a total of 4 + 22 = 26 items on his shelf. Later, he added six more action figures to the shelf, so now he has 26 + 6 = 32 items on his shelf. Therefore, Jerry had 32 action figures on his shelf after adding the new ones.
Response:  At first, Jerry had five action figures and nine books on his shelf. Later, he added seven more action figures to the shelf. So, initially there were 5 + 9 = 14 items in total on the shelf. After adding the new action figures, the total number of items became 7 + 14 = 21. Therefore, there are now two more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had two action figures and ten books on his shelf. Later, he added four more action figures to the shelf. So, at this point, there are 2 + 4 = 6 action figures on the shelf. Now, let's count how many books Jerry has left. He started with ten books, so he still has ten books after adding four more action figures. Therefore, the final number of books Jerry has is 10.  So, the correct answer is 6 action figures and 10 books.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books initially. Later, he added 10 more books to the shelf, so now he has 18 books in total (8 + 9 + 10).
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, now there are 4 + 2 = 6 books on the shelf. Since we know that each book takes up space equal to one action figure, then the number of action figures on the shelf is now 6 / 1 = 6 action figures. Therefore, there are 7 - 6 = 1 more action figure than book on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had five action figures and two books on a shelf in his room initially. Later, he added nine more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf is: 5 + 2 = 7. Since there are seven items on the shelf, including both action figures and books, there are three more books than action figures (7 - 5 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 3 more books than action figures.
Response:  At first, Jerry had eight action figures on his shelf. Later, he added four new ones and took away five old ones. So, if we calculate how many action figures were left after taking away the old ones, we get: 8 - 5 = 3. Therefore, Jerry had three action figures left on his shelf after adding the new ones and removing the old ones.
Response:  If Jerry had three action figures initially and later added four more, then there are six action figures in total now (3 + 4 = 6).  To find out how many action figures Jerry took away from the shelf, we need to subtract the number of old action figures he had (3) from the new total number of action figures (6): 6 - 3 = 3. So, Jerry took away 3 action figures from his shelf.
Response:  If Jerry had 7 action figures initially and later added more to make it 15 in total, then he must have taken away 8 of the original ones (since there are now only 8 left). So, Jerry has added 7 new action figures to his collection.
Response:  If Jerry had initially 5 action figures on his shelf and then added 2 more later, he now has 7 (initially) + 2 = 9 action figures in total on his shelf. So, originally, Jerry had 5 action figures on his shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had nine action figures on his shelf. Later, he added seven more action figures to the shelf. So, at this point, there are 16 action figures in total (9 + 7). If we also know that Jerry has ten books on his shelf, then we can deduce that there are six fewer action figures than books on his shelf (16 - 10 = 6). Therefore, there are six action figures left after adding the new ones to the original nine.
Response:  At first, Jerry had three books and four action figures on his shelf. Later, he added two more action figures to the shelf. So, at this point, there are five action figures on the shelf (the original four plus the new one). Now, let's count how many books Jerry has - we know that from the beginning, he had three books. Therefore, the total number of items on Jerry's shelf is five action figures + three books = eight things in total.
Response:  At first, Jerry had seven books and three action figures on his shelf. Later, he added two more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there are now seven + two = nine items on the shelf. Therefore, the number of books is still seven, but the number of action figures has increased from three to nine.
Response:  If two birds are already sitting on the fence and more birds come to join them, then there will be a total of $6$ birds on the fence. So, the answer is $6$.
Response:  In the beginning, there were only a few birds on the fence (5). Then, four more birds came to join them (4 + 5 = 9). So, in total, there are nine birds on the fence at the start.
Response:  We have 46 starlings already sitting on the fence. If six more birds come to join them, then we will have 46 + 6 = 52 birds sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  We have three birds and two storks already sitting on the fence. If five more birds come to join them, then there will be eight birds in total (3 + 5 = 8). As for the storks, they are still two. So, in total, we have 8 birds and 2 storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds and four storks sitting on the fence initially. Then two more birds come to join them, making it five birds in total. However, we still have four storks sitting on the fence, so the final number of birds is greater than the number of storks - 5 > 4 = 1. Therefore, there are one more bird than stork sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have two sparrows and six cranes sitting on the fence initially. Then three more birds come to join them. So, in total we have... (2 + 3) = 5 birds sitting on the fence. Since each bird is equal to one stork, therefore there are... (5 x 1) = 5 storks sitting on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 storks.
Response:  We have four birds and six storks already sitting on the fence. If two more storks come to join them, then we will have... (4 + 2) = 6 storks on the fence!
Response:  We have three birds and four storks initially sitting on the fence. Then six more storks come to join them. So, in total, we have... (3 + 6) = 9 birds and storks sitting on the fence!
"Response:  We have:
Sex (6) birds and three (3) storks are already sitting on the fence. Then two more storks come to join them. So, in total we have:
6 + 3 = 9 birds and 2 more storks = 5 storks. Therefore, there are 9 + 5 = 14 birds and storks sitting on the fence."
Response:  We have four birds and three storks sitting on the fence initially. Then six more storks come to join them. So, in total we have: Birds - 4 Storks - 3 + 6 = 9 storks Now, let's check how many bird are left after the storks joined. There were originally four birds, so now there are only four birds left. Therefore, the final number of storks sitting on the fence is 9 (the initial number plus the newcomers).
Response:  We have 4 birds and 8 storks already sitting on the fence. Then we add 4 more birds and 8 more storks to join them. So, in total, we have: Birds = 4 + 4 = 8 Birds Storks = 8 + 8 = 16 Storks Therefore, there are 8 birds and 16 storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have two birds already sitting on the fence (5 + 2 = 7). Then, five more birds and four more storks come to join them. So, in total we have 7 + 5 + 4 = 16 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 16 - 4 = 12 storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds initially sitting on the fence. Then two more birds come to join them, making it five birds in total. Next, six more storks arrive and join the group, bringing the total number of birds and storks to 11 (3 + 2 + 6 = 11). So, there are 11 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 3 storks and 4 more birds coming to join them. So in total we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three storks and two birds already sitting on the fence. If we add three more birds to join them, then there will be six creatures in total (3 storks + 2 birds + 3 new birds). So, the answer is 6.
Response:  We know that six storks and two birds arrived at the fence. So, in total, we have 6 + 2 = 8 creatures sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are more storks than birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  The first chapter is 48 pages long and the second chapter is 11 pages long. To find out how many pages the first chapter has more than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the answer is:  First chapter has 37 pages more than the second chapter (48 - 11 = 37).
Response:  The first chapter is 37 pages long, and the second chapter is 80 pages long. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we need to subtract the length of the first chapter from the length of the second chapter. So, the difference between the two lengths is: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter.
"Response:  If the first chapter is 60 pages long and there are 93 pages in total, then we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:

Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 60 pages
Total number of pages in book = 93 pages

Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter is:
Number of pages in Chapter 2 = Total number of pages in book - Number of pages in Chapter 1
= 93 pages - 60 pages
= 33 pages

So, there are 33 pages in the second chapter of the book."
Response:  If the second chapter is 36 pages long and there are 67 pages in total, then we can calculate how many pages are in each chapter as follows: Number of pages in first chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in second chapter First chapter has x pages. Since the second chapter is 36 pages long, we know that the total number of pages is greater than or equal to 67. Therefore, we can write an inequality equation: x + 36 <= 67 Now, let's solve for x using substitution. We know that the sum of the pages in both chapters must be less than or equal to 67. So, we can rewrite the inequality as: x + (36) <= 67 Substituting the value of x from the problem statement into this equation gives us: 2x + 36 <= 67 Solving for x, we get: x = 30pages This means that the first chapter has 30 pages.
Response:  First chapter is 66 pages long, second chapter is 35 pages long and third chapter is 24 pages long. So total number of pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, the book has 125 pages in total.
Response:  First, we know that the first chapter is 91 pages long and the second chapter is 23 pages long. To find out how many pages the first chapter has more than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, we can write: Number of pages in first chapter - Number of pages in second chapter = x Where x represents the difference between the two numbers. Now, we can substitute the values given in the question into this equation: 91 - 23 = x Substituting these values gives us: 68 = x Therefore, the first chapter has 68 pages more than the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter is 35 pages long, so it has x pages. Since the second chapter is shorter than the first one, its length can be represented as y < x. Similarly, since the third chapter is even shorter, its length can be represented as z < y. Now we have three equations: x + y = 35 (from the first chapter), y > 0 (since the second chapter exists), and z < y (from the third chapter). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 27, y = 9, and z = 3. Therefore, the second chapter has 9 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  First, we know that the first chapter is 53 pages long and the second chapter is 75 pages long. So, if we subtract the length of the second chapter from the length of the first chapter, we get: 53 - 75 = -22. Therefore, the first chapter has 22 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  We know that each chapter is 61 pages long and there are 31 chapters in total. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages in the book as follows: Total number of pages = Number of chapters x Length of each chapter So, the total number of pages in this book would be: Total number of pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the book has two chapters with 23 pages each. So, in total, there are 46 pages in the book (2 x 23 = 46). Now, we want to find out how many pages are in the first chapter. Since the first chapter is ten pages long, we can say that the number of pages in the first chapter is 10. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We know that the book has two chapters and each chapter is 81 pages long. So, if we want to find out how many pages are in the second chapter, we can multiply the number of pages in the first chapter (which is 81) by 2 since there are two chapters. Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter is 81 x 2 = 162 pages.
Response:  We know that 39 people went for a bike ride and rowed in the afternoon. So, if we subtract this number from the total number of people who went for a bike ride and rowed in the morning, we will get the difference between the two numbers. Therefore, the answer is: 62 - 39 = 23 more people went for a bike ride and rowed in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 52 people went fishing and rowed in the morning.  In addition, we are told that 61 people went fishing and rowed in the afternoon. So, to find out how many more people went fishing and rowed in the afternoon than in the morning, we can subtract the number of people who went fishing and rowed in the morning from the total number of people who went fishing and rowed in the afternoon:  61 - 52 = 9  Therefore, there were 9 more people who went fishing and rowed in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 15 people went for a bike ride and rowed in the morning. If 32 people went for a rowing trip that day, then the number of people who went for a bike ride must be less than 32 - 15 = 17. Therefore, 17 people went for a bike ride in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that some of the campers went and rode in the morning while seven of them went and rode in the afternoon. If a total of 60 campers went fishing that day, then we can conclude that... (more)  Therefore, the number of campers who went fishing in the morning is equal to 60 - 7 = 53.
Response:  We know that 36 games were played in the morning, and 13 games were played in the afternoon. Therefore, there are 36 + 13 = 49 games played in total during the daytime hours (morning and afternoon). Now we need to find out how many games were played at night. According to the question, 49 games were played at night. So, the final answer is: 49 games were played at night.
Response:  We know that 44 people went to work in the morning and 39 people went to work in the afternoon. Therefore, we can say that the difference between the number of people who went to work in the morning and those who went to work in the afternoon is equal to 44 - 39 = 5. So, there are 5 more people who went to work in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 53 games were played in the morning, and 48 games were played in the afternoon. So, there are 53 - 48 = 5 more games played in the morning than in the afternoon. Now we need to find out how many more games were played in the evening than in the morning. From the question, we know that 49 games were played in the evening, so let's subtract the number of games played in the morning from the number of games played in the evening: 49 - 5 = 44 more games played in the evening than in the morning. Therefore, there are 44 more games played in the evening than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 33 games were played in the morning and 34 games were played in the afternoon. Therefore, we can say that there are 33 - 34 = -1 game less played in the afternoon than in the morning. Since no games were played in the evening, this means that there are -1 fewer game played in the afternoon than in the evening. So, the difference between the number of games played in the afternoon and evening is -1.
Response:  We know that 13 people went for a walk in the morning and 21 people went rowing in the afternoon. So, the total number of people who went rowing is 21 + 13 = 34. Therefore, 34 people rodded.
Response:  We know that 29 people went for a walk in the morning and 66 people went for a hike in the morning. So, the total number of people who went for a walk or hike in the morning is: 29 + 66 = 95 people. Now we are told that 26 people went boating in the afternoon. Therefore, the difference between the number of people who went for a walk/hike in the morning and those who went boating in the afternoon is: 95 - 26 = 69 people. So, there were 69 more people who went for a walk/hike in the morning than those who went boating in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 41 campers went and reddened in the morning, so there are 41 - 4 = 37 campers who did not go and redden. Among these 37 campers, 26 went and rode in the afternoon, so there are 37 - 26 = 11 campers who did not go and ride. Therefore, the number of campers who went and reddened is 41, and the number of campers who went and wandered is 11.
Response:  In the morning, 43 campers went and rowed. So in total, we have 43 + x = 100 (where x is the number of campers who went and rowed in the afternoon). Solving for x, we get x = 57. Therefore, 57 campers went and rowed in the afternoon.
Response:  If Rachel picks four apples from her tree and there were seven apples to begin with, then after she picked four, there would be three apples left on the tree. So, there are three apples remaining on the tree.
Response:  At first, Rachel had four apples on her tree. Then she picked some of them and now there are two left. So, Rachel picked 2 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from her tree and now the tree has 5 apples left. If 3 of them are ripe, then there must be 2 unripe apples remaining (since 5 - 3 = 2). So, the number of unripe apples on the tree is 2.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked two ripe apples from her tree and now the tree has seven apples left. If six of them are ripe, then there must be one unripe apple remaining. So initially, the tree had one unripe apple.
Response:  We know that there are two mogna äpplen and four omogna äpplen now. So, if we add these numbers together, we get 2 + 4 = 6. Therefore, the tree had six apples to begin with.
Response:  We know that now there are 3 mogna äpplen and 27 omogna äpplen. So if we subtract the number of mogna äpplen from the total number of äpplen, we get the original number of mogna äpplen. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. So, initially, the tree had 7 + 2 = 9 apples. Then, two new apples grew on the tree, so now it has 9 + 2 = 11 apples. Therefore, the tree started with 11 apples.
Response:  At first, Rachel had two apples on the tree. Then she picked four apples from her tree. So now there are two apples left on the tree. After that, three new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples on the tree is 2 + 4 = 6 apples.
"Response:  We know that Rachel picked two apples from one of her trees, so there are now fewer apples on that tree. Specifically, we are told that after she picked two apples, the tree had seven apples left. So, if the tree originally had x apples, then we can set up the equation:
x - 2 = 7
Solving for x, we get:
x = 9
So, to begin with, Rachel's tree had 9 apples."
Response:  If Rachel picked 8 apples from each of her three apple trees, then she collected 24 apples in total (3 x 8 = 24). Now, there are 9 apples left on all the trees combined. So, initially, there were 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 apples on the trees (not including the ones Rachel picked).
Response:  If Rachel picked 7 apples from each of her 4 apple trees, then she picked a total of 7 x 4 = 28 apples. So, she left 1 apple on each tree (29 - 28 = 1). Therefore, Rachel picked 1 apple from each tree.
"Response:  We know that Ed had two more bullets than Doug initially. So, if Ed has 20 bullets and Doug has x bullets, then we can write an equation:
Ed = Doug + 2
Now, we are told that Doug lost some of his bullets at the playground. Let's say he lost x bullets. Then, we can update our equation as follows:
Doug = x - 2
Substituting this updated value for Doug into the first equation, we get:
Ed = Doug + 2 = (x - 2) + 2
Simplifying, we get:
Ed = 2x - 4
Finally, we are told that Ed now has 19 bullets more than Doug. Therefore, we can set up another equation:
Ed = 2x - 4 > 19
Solving for x, we get:
x = 16
So, Doug lost 16 bullets at the playground."
Response:  We know that Ed had ten more bullets than Doug. So if Ed had 45 bullets and lost 11 of them at the playground, he would have 34 bullets left (45 - 11 = 34). Therefore, Ed has 34 bullets more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had more than seven kulors and less than twenty-two kulors. So he must have had exactly nine kulors more than Doug. Therefore, Doug has 13 kulors now (7 - 9 = 13).
Response:  We know that Ed had five more kulor than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 27 kulor and Doug lost three of his kulor, then how many kulor did Doug have initially?  Well, if Ed had five more kulor than Doug, then Doug must have had fewer kulor than Ed. Therefore, we can conclude that Doug had 22 kulor (27 - 5 = 22).
Response:  We know that Ed had more than Doug initially (Ed had 24 more). Then, we are told that Doug lost 27 of his bullets at the playground while Ed found nine additional ones. So, if Ed had 9 + 24 = 33 bullets more than Doug to start with.
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 more bullets than Doug. If Ed lost 17 of his bullets at the playground, then he has 12 (29 - 17) more bullets than Doug now. So, the difference between Ed and Doug is 12 bullets.
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more bullets than Doug initially. Then, Ed lost some of his bullets at the playground. Now he has 8 more bullets than Doug. So, if Ed had x bullets initially and lost y bullets, then he would have x - y bullets left. Since Ed now has 8 more bullets than Doug, we can set up the equation: x - y = 8. Solving for y, we get: y = 11. Therefore, Ed lost 11 bullets at the playground.
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more bullets than Doug and he lost 21 of his bullets at the playground. So now Ed has 91 - 21 = 70 bullets left. Therefore, Ed has 70 more bullets than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more bullets than Doug initially. So if Ed has 17 bullets now and lost 20 of his bullets at the playground, then Doug must have gained those 20 bullets. Therefore, Doug currently has 37 bullets (17 + 20).
"Response:  If 408 students suggested potato dishes and 42 students suggested bacon in the menu, then we have:
Potato dishes = 408
Bacon = 42
Now, to find out how many more students suggested potato dishes than those who suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the total number of students who suggested potato dishes:
More students suggested potato dishes = Total number of students who suggested potato dishes - Number of students who suggested bacon
= 408 - 42
= 366
Therefore, there were 366 more students who suggested potato dishes than those who suggested bacon."
Response:  We know that 479 students suggested potato dishes and 489 students suggested bacon dishes. So, we have a total of 479 + 489 = 968 suggestions. Now, to find out how many more students suggested bacon than those who suggested potatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested potatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon: 968 - 479 = 489. Therefore, 489 more students suggested bacon than those who suggested potatoes.
Response:  We know that 185 eleversuggested adding bacon to the menu. Therefore, we can conclude that 185 eleverföreslogbacon.
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students suggested bacon for lunch while 20 students suggested potato salad. So, the number of students who suggested potatismos is 20.
Response:  If 457 students suggested adding potatoes and 290 students suggested adding bacon, then there are 457 - 290 = 167 students who did not suggest either option. Therefore, among the remaining 167 students, 63 more students favored potatoes than those who favored bacon. So, the number of students who favored bacon is 167 - 63 = 104 students.
"Response:  If 182 students suggested adding potatoes and 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding potatoes, then we can say that 

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ students\ suggesting\ bacon = Total\ number\ of\ students - Number\ of\ students\ suggesting\ potatoes $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ students\ suggesting\ bacon = 348 - 182 = 166 $$

Therefore, $166$ students suggested adding bacon to the menu."
Response:  We know that 324 students suggested adding potatoes to their lunches, and 374 students suggested adding bacon. Therefore, we can say that 698 (324 + 374) students participated in the suggestion of new food items for their lunches.
Response:  We know that out of 257 students, 257 students suggested potatoes (so they all suggested the same thing). Out of 120 students who suggested something else, 120/3 = 40 students suggested bacon. So, there are 257 - 40 = 217 students who did not suggest bacon. Now we need to find out how many more students suggested potatoes than those who did not suggest bacon. To do this, we divide the number of students who suggested potatoes by the number of students who did not suggest bacon: 217 / 257 = 0.86 or approximately 86%. Therefore, 86% more students suggested potatoes than those who did not suggest bacon.
"Response:  If 144 students suggested potato dishes and 79 students suggested tomatoes, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = Number of students who suggested potato dishes - Number of students who suggested tomatoes
= 144 - 79
= 65

Therefore, 65 more students suggested potato dishes than those who suggested tomatoes."
Response:  If 228 students suggested specific types of food and 337 students suggested potatoes, then we can say that 109 (228 - 337) students did not suggest any specific type of food. Now, if 23 students suggested tomatoes, then we have 109 + 23 = 132 students who suggested some other type of food than potatoes or tomatoes. Therefore, 132 - 33 = 99 more students suggested bacon than those who suggested tomatoes.
Response:  We know that out of 450 students, 45 (10%) suggested adding potatoes to the menu.  Therefore, we can assume that 395 (85%) did not participate in the suggestion.  So, the number of students who participated in the suggestion is 395.
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding potatoes and bacon to the menu while 351 students suggested only adding bacon, then we can conclude that 133 (218 - 351) students wanted bacon in the menu.
Response:  If 269 students suggested bacon and 330 students suggested potatoes, then there are more students who suggested potatoes than those who suggested bacon. So, we can say that |330 - 269| = x, where x is the number of students who suggested potatoes more than bacon. Since 76 students suggested tomatoes, we have the equation: |x| + 76 = 330. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. To do so, we can divide both sides of the equation by |x|: |x| + 76 / |x| = 330 / |x|. Simplifying, we get x = 154. Therefore, 154 more students favored potatoes over bacon.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the number of boys: 841 - 34 = 807. So, there are 807 more boys than girls at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at the school and we also know that there are 232 girls (flickor) which means that the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. So, there are 253 boys at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls and the remaining students are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys, then the number of boys is equal to 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls in the school and 510 more boys than girls. So, if we want to find out how many boy students there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:  Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys  = 635 + (510 - 635)  = 510 Therefore, there are 510 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 587 boys in the school, then the total number of students is 868 + 587 = 1455. Since there are 281 more girls than boys, the number of girls is 281 + 587 = 868. Therefore, the number of boys in the school is 1455 - 868 = 587.
Response:  If there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls in the school, then the total number of students in the school is:  Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Total number of students = 700 + (142 - 700)  Total number of students = 700 + (-70)  Total number of students = 630  Therefore, there are 630 students in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 706 girls and 222 boys in the school. If 418 more girls joined the school, then the total number of girls is now = initial no. of girls + new no. of girls = 706 + 418 = 1124. Similarly, the total number of boys is also increased by 418, so it becomes = initial no. of boys + new no. of boys = 222 + 418 = 640. Therefore, the present number of students in the school is = 1124 (girls) + 640 (boys) = 1764.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. If 44 more girls joined the school, then the total number of girls would be 902 + 44 = 946 girls. So, now there are 946 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then, 465 more girls joined the school. So, now the total number of girls is 632 + 465 = 1097. Similarly, the total number of boys remains unchanged at 410. Therefore, the difference between the number of girls and boys in the school is: 1097 - 410 = 687. Hence, there are 687 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, 682 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls is now: 732 + 682 = 1414 girls. Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys in the school and 135 girls.  Then, 496 more girls and 910 more boys joined the school. So, now we have: Number of boys = Initial number of boys + Newly admitted boys = 214 + (496 x 2) = 214 + 988 = 1202 boys Now, we can find out how many girls are in the school by subtracting the initial number of girls from the total number of students: Number of girls = Total number of students - Initial number of girls = 375 (girls joining the school) + 135 (initial number of girls) = 510 girls Therefore, there are 1202 boys and 510 girls in the school now.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, together they make up 626 students (308 + 318). Now we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in total at the school. There are 36 teachers, so the total number of people at the school is 626 + 36 = 662. Therefore, there are 662 students and 36 teachers in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in the school overall. There are 772 teachers, so the total number of people in the school is 624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1396. Therefore, there are 1396 people in the school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So if there are 402 girls and 739 total students (including both genders), then the number of boys must be less than 402.  Therefore, there are 402 - 73 = 331 boys in this school.
Response:  If there are 458 more girls than boys in the school and there are 692 total students, then we can write an equation based on this information: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of boys = 692 - 458 = 234. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. If 403 more girls joined the school, then the total number of girls is now 257 + 403 = 659 girls. Therefore, the difference between the number of boys and girls in the school is 362 - 659 = -391. So, there are 391 fewer boys than girls in the school.
Response:  Edward had $18 and spent $16. So he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. Therefore, Edward now has $2.
Response:  Edward had $13 and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, Edward has spent $10 ($13 - $3).
Response:  Edward spent $9 and then he had $8 left. Now he has $17. So, if he started with $x dollars, we can set up the equation: x - $9 = $8 + $17. Solving for $x, we get: $x = $26. Therefore, Edward had $26 before he used his money.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books at a cost of $1 per book. So he had $16 - ($1 x 92) = $15 left after buying the books. Now we are told that he has $6 left. Therefore, Edward had $15 + $6 = $21 before he used his money.
"Response:  We know that Edward paid $6 for two books and now he has $12 in total. So, if each book cost him the same amount of money, we can write an equation as follows: Book Cost = $6. Now, let's solve for ""Book Cost"" by dividing both sides of the equation by $6: Book Cost = $12 / $6 = $2. Therefore, each book cost $2."
Response:  Edward gave $6 for books and $16 for pens, so he had $6 + $16 = $22 left before spending his money. Now he has $19, so he spent $3 less than what he had initially ($22 - $3 = $19). Therefore, Edward had $22 before using his money.
Response:  Edward gave $4 for books and $3 for pens, so he has spent a total of $4 + $3 = $7 on those items. Therefore, Edward has spent $7 on books and pens combined.
Response:  We know that Edward gave $16 for books and $8 for pens. So he has $19 now. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he had: $19 - $8 = $11. Therefore, Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward spent $17 dollars. So he had $17 - $17 = $0 left after spending. Then his friend gave him $10. So now he has $0 + $10 = $10. Finally, he used some of his money and now he has $10 - $7 = $3 left. Therefore, Edward had $3 as his initial amount before using any of his money.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 arm curls in the gym today and David did more than Zachary. So, we can say that David did x arm curls where x is greater than 44. Now, we are told that David did 58 more arm curls than Zachary. This means that David did (x + 58) arm curls in total. Therefore, Zachary did 44 arm curls and David did (x + 58) = 102 arm curls in total.
Response:  Zachary did 51 arm curls and David did 44 arm curls. So, we can say that Zachary did x more arm curls than David since he did 7 more (51 - 44 = 7). Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  We know that David did 44 arm curls in the gym today. And we are told that David did nine more than Zachary. So if Zachary did x arm curls, then David did 44 - 9 = 35 arm curls. Therefore, Zachary did 35 arm curls in the gym today.
Response:  We know that David did 51 arm curls in the gym today and Zachary did 49 more than him. So, Zachary did 51 + 49 = 100 arm curls. Therefore, David and Zachary together did 100 + 51 = 151 arm curls in total.
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 arm curls and 44 knee bends in the gym today.  David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary but 27 fewer crunches than Zachary. So if we let X be the number of arm curls David did, then we can write an equation based on the information given:
X = 19 + 59 = 78
So David did 78 arm curls in the gym today."
Response:  We know that David did 29 more arm curlings than Zachary since he had 44 - 29 = 15 more arm curlings than Zachary. However, we also know that David did fewer knee bends than Zachary since he had 13 less knee bends than Zachary (17 - 13 = 4). Therefore, David performed 29 + 4 = 33 crunches in total.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 arm curls and 14 knee bends in total.  David did 17 more arm curls than Zachary but only 10 fewer knee bends. So if we add up all these numbers, we get:  Arm curls: Zachary - 53 + David - 17 = 70  Knee bends: Zachary - 14 + David - 10 = 24  Therefore, Zachary did 70 arm curls and 24 knee bends in total.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 arm curls and 3 squats in the gym today.  David did 58 more arm curls than Zachary, which means he did 58 + 35 = 93 arm curls. However, David did fewer squats than Zachary, with 87 less squats. So, the difference between the number of arm curls and squats done by David is 93 - 87 = 6. Therefore, Zachary did 6 more arm curls than squats.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 arm curls and 58 crunches in total.  David did 38 more arm curls than Zachary but fewer knee bends (62 less). So if we subtract the number of knee bends from the total number of arm curls done by David, we get the difference between their numbers of arm curls. Therefore, Zachary did 14 more arm curls than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 arm curls in the gym today.  David did more than Zachary, so let's say he did 40 arm curls.  Since John did fewer push-ups than David, we can assume that he did 36 push-ups (since 39 - 13 = 26). So, David did 40 + 26 = 66 arm curls.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 arm curls in the gym today. David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 arm curls (51 + 22 = 73). John did four fewer arm curls than David, so John did 69 arm curls (73 - 4 = 69). Therefore, John did 69 arm curls in the gym today.
"Response:  We know that David did 39 more arm curls than Zachary and John did 9 fewer push-ups than David. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Zachary = 15 + (David - John)
Now let's substitute the values given in the question into the equation:
Zachary = 15 + (39 - 9)
= 15 + 26
= 41
So Zachary did 41 arm curls today."
Response:  If David did 30 more arm curls than Zachary, that means Zachary did x arm curls. Since David did 37 arm curls, we can set up an equation as follows:  x + 30 = 37. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. So, Zachary did 27 arm curls in the gym today.
Response:  If David made 56 more push-ups than Zachary in the gym today and David did 38 push-ups, then Zachary did 18 push-ups (56 - 38 = 18). So, together they did 38 + 18 = 56 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 34 arm curls and 62 crunches in total. Since David did 40 more arm curls than Zachary, David did 40 + 34 = 74 arm curls in total. However, we are also told that David did 17 fewer leg raises (knee bends) than Zachary. So if Zachary did 62 crunches, then David did 62 - 17 = 45 crunches. Therefore, David performed 74 arm curls and 45 crunches in total at the gym today.
Response:  We know that David did 36 more arm curls than Zachary (36 - 33 = 3). So Zachary did 3 fewer arm curls than David (David did 36 and Zachary did 33). Now we want to find out how many more arm curls Zachary did than he did crunches. To do this, we subtract the number of crunches from the total number of exercises Zachary did: 33 (crunches) - 58 (total exercises) = -25. Therefore, Zachary did 25 fewer arm curls than crunches.
Response:  We know that David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary and 7 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 sit-ups, then Zachary did 34 (5 + 17) more sit-ups than push-ups. Therefore, Zachary did 34 more knuckles than arm curls.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to make five pages of math worksheets and two pages of reading comprehension exercises. To find out how many more math worksheets she had than reading comprehension exercises, we can subtract the number of pages for reading comprehension from the total number of pages. So, if we subtract 2 from 5, we get 3. Therefore, Rachel had three more math worksheets than reading comprehension exercises.
Response:  If Rachel had to do 3 pages of math worksheets and 4 pages of reading comprehension exercises, then she would have done a total of... (use your calculator or count)...pages of reading comprehension exercises. So, the difference between the number of pages of math worksheets and reading comprehension exercises is... (calculate).
Response:  If Rachel had to make five pages of math worksheets and even more pages for reading comprehension exercises, then she would have 5 + x = 12 pages in total, where x is the number of pages she had for reading comprehension exercises. Since she had 7 pages of reading comprehension exercises, we can conclude that she had 12 - 7 = 5 pages of other types of exercises (either math or reading). Therefore, Rachel had 5 pages of math worksheets and 5 pages of other types of exercises, for a total of 10 pages.
Response:  If Rachel had to make seven pages of math lessons and she was allowed to do four more pages than reading lessons, then we can calculate it as follows: Seven (pages of math lessons) + Four (more pages of math lessons than reading lessons) = Eleven (total number of pages). So, Rachel had to make eleven pages of reading lessons.
"Response:  If Rachel had to make 8 pages of schoolwork and she made three more math lessons than reading lessons, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many pages Rachel made for each subject.
Math Lessons = 3 (more than Reading Lessons) x 8 pages = 24 pages
Reading Lessons = 8 pages

Step 2: Add up the total number of pages Rachel made.
Total Pages = Math Lessons + Reading Lessons = 24 + 8 = 32 pages

Therefore, Rachel had to make 32 pages of schoolwork in total."
"Response:  If Rachel had to do 8 pages of math homework and she has 6 more pages of reading comprehension than math homework, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Rachel needs to complete = 8 + 6 = 14 pages
So, Rachel has 14 pages of homework left to complete."
Response:  If Rachel had read 10 pages of math book and she had read more than 3 pages in math, then she must have read 10 + 3 = 13 pages in total. So, she had 13 pages left to read.
Response:  If Rachel had to fill in two sides of a worksheet for math class and three sides for reading comprehension, that means she has to fill in six sides in total (2 + 3 = 6). Then, if she had to fill in ten sides for biology, that brings the total number of sides to be filled in to sixteen (6 + 10 = 16). So, Rachel had to fill in sixteen sides in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to do 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many more pages she had in math than in reading. To do this, we simply subtract the number of pages in reading from the total number of pages in math. In this case, the difference is 9 - 2 = 7 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 7 more pages of math homework than she did of reading homework.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Rachel had to do 11 pages of math lessons and 2 pages of reading lessons. Therefore, she had to do 9 more pages of math lessons than reading lessons (11 - 2 = 9). So, Rachel had to do 9 + 3 = 12 additional pages of math lessons compared to reading lessons.
Response:  If Rachel had to do seven pages of math homework and eleven pages of reading comprehension, that means she did one page of each for every two pages of math homework. So if she did seven pages of math homework, she would have done three pages of reading comprehension. Similarly, if she did eight pages of biology homework, she would have done five pages of reading comprehension (since there are eight pages of biology homework). Therefore, Rachel had more reading comprehension than biology homework. The difference between these amounts is five pages (5).
Response:  If Rachel had to do 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension, she would have done a total of 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework in those subjects.  As for biology, we are told that she had to do 29 pages of homework in that subject. Therefore, the total number of pages of homework Rachel had to do is 20 + 29 = 49 pages.
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to make 8 pages of math lessons and 7 pages of reading lessons. Since each page has 2 sides (front and back), we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:
Math lessons: 8 x 2 = 16 pages
Reading lessons: 7 x 2 = 14 pages
So, in total, Rachel had to make 16 + 14 = 30 pages of lessons."
Response:  If Rachel had to do five pages of math homework and ten pages of reading comprehension, she would have to do a total of 15 pages (5 + 10 = 15). Similarly, if she had to do six pages of biology lessons, she would have to do a total of 6 pages (6 = 6). Therefore, in total, Rachel was required to complete 21 pages (15 + 6 = 21) of school work.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to read two sides and make four math lessons. So, if she made more math lessons than reading lessons, then the difference between these numbers is equal to the number of pages that Rachel had to make for each subject. In this case, we know that there are 4 pages for math lessons and 2 pages for reading lessons, so the difference between them is 2 pages (4 - 2 = 2). Therefore, Rachel had to make 2 additional pages of math lessons than reading lessons.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to read four pages of reading comprehension and seven pages of math. So far, we have 4 + 7 = 11 pages total. Now, let's find out how many more pages she had in her math lesson than in her reading lesson. According to the question, she had 19 pages in her biology lesson, which is one more than the number of pages she had in her math lesson (18 pages). Therefore, the difference between the number of pages she had in her math lesson and her reading lesson is 18 - 11 = 7 pages. So, Rachel had 7 more pages in her math lesson than in her reading lesson.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails in total. So, if he received 4 emails on morning and 2 emails on afternoon, then we can say that:
Morning: 4 emails
Afternoon: 2 emails
Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is:
Difference = Morning - Afternoon = 4 - 2 = 2
So, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than he did in the afternoon."
Response:  On morning, Jack received 6 emails and on afternoon he received 8 emails. So total number of emails Jack received is = 6 + 8 = 14 emails.
Response:  If Jack received four emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he must have received at least five emails that day. So, the answer is 5.
"Response: 
Jack received 6 emails in total (3 + 5). So, he received 6 emails on that day."
Response:  According to the question, Jack received five emails in the morning and eight in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 13 emails during these two time periods. Therefore, Jack received 5 + 8 = 13 emails during the morning and after noon.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received four emails in the morning and five in the afternoon. So he received a total of nine emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Now we are asked how many emails he received in the evening. Since he did not receive any emails in the evening according to the question, the answer is zero. Therefore, Jack received a total of nine emails during the daytime and zero emails in the evening.
Response:  On morning, Jack received three emails and on afternoon he received four emails. So, in total Jack received 3 + 4 = 7 emails during daytime (morning and afternoon). Now, we are asked how many emails did Jack receive at night. According to the question, Jack received eight emails at night. Therefore, the final answer is: 7 + 8 = 15 emails that Jack received throughout the day.
"Response:  On morning, Jack received 10 emails.  On afternoon, he received 7 emails.  On evening, he received 17 emails. So, we can calculate the difference between morning and afternoon as follows:  
Difference = Evening - Afternoon = 17 - 7 = 10 Emails more in the evening than in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received 10 more emails in the evening than he did in the afternoon."
Response:  On morning, Jack received 9 emails and on afternoon he received 10 emails. So total number of emails received in morning is 9 + 10 = 19. Now we are asked how many more emails did jack receive on evening than on morning. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of emails received on morning from the number of emails received on evening. Number of emails received on evening is 7, so difference between morning and evening is 7 - 19 = -12. Therefore, Jack received fewer emails on evening than on morning by 12 emails.
Response:  On morning, Jack received 5 emails.  On afternoon, Jack received 10 emails - so in total he received 15 emails.  Now, we are asked how many more emails did Jack receive on afternoon than on evening. To find this difference, we subtract the number of emails received on evening from the number of emails received on afternoon:  15 - 4 = 11. So, Jack received 11 more emails on afternoon than on evening.
Response:  If Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 in the afternoon, then he received a total of 9 emails during the day (morning + afternoon). Since we are told that he also received some emails in the evening, let's assume that he received an additional x emails in the evening. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received is 9 + x = 10. So, Jack received 10 emails per day.
Response:  We know that Jack received three emails and 64 messages in Morse code during the day. So, he received a total of 3 + 64 = 67 messages during the day. Since we also know that he received five emails and 54 messages in the afternoon, we can conclude that he received a total of 5 + 54 = 60 messages during the entire day. Therefore, Jack received 67 + 60 = 127 messages during the day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters. So far, he has received 5 + 6 = 11 messages. Then in the afternoon, he received 9 emails and 7 letters. Therefore, in total, Jack received 11 + 9 = 20 messages today.
Response:  On morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. So he got 10 + 12 = 22 messages in total on morning.  On afternoon, Jack received 3 emails and 44 letters. So he got 3 + 44 = 47 messages in total on afternoon.  Therefore, Jack received more messages on afternoon than on morning by 5 (47 - 22) messages.
Response:  On morning, Jack received x meals and y letters.  On afternoon, he received z meals and w letters. We know that x + y = 8 (the total number of emails and letters Jack received). Also, we know that z + w = 2 (the total number of emails and letters Jack received in the afternoon). Now we can solve for x using the first equation: x + y = 8...(1)...and then substitute the value of y from the second equation into equation (1): x + y = 8...(1) Substituting y = 7: x + 7 = 8...(2) Solving for x: x = 5...(3) Therefore, Jack received 5 meals and 7 letters on morning.
"Response: 
Jack got 6 emails and sent 91 emails in the morning. So he received 85 emails - 91 = -20 emails in the morning. 
He got 2 emails and sent 74 emails in the afternoon. So he received 74 - 2 = 72 emails in the afternoon.  In total, Jack received 85 + 72 = 157 emails on that day."
"Response: 
Jack got four emails and sent two letters in the morning. So he received 4 + 2 = 6 emails and sent 2 letters.
On the afternoon, he got 6 more emails and sent 8 letters. So now he has received 6 + 6 = 12 emails and sent 8 letters.
Therefore, Jack received a total of 12 emails and sent 8 letters during the day."
Response:  If Jack received 9 emails in total and he got 7 emails in the morning, then he must have received x number of emails in the afternoon where x = 9 - 7 = 2. Therefore, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  If Jack received three emails in the afternoon and five in the morning, then he received a total of 8 emails that day (3 + 5 = 8). Now, we are asked how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon. To find this difference, we subtract the number of emails received in the afternoon from the number of emails received in the morning: 8 - 3 = 5. So, Jack received 5 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  If Jack received three emails in the afternoon and six in the morning, then he received a total of 9 emails that day (3 + 6 = 9). So if he received some more emails in the evening, he would have received a total of 10 emails that day (9 + x = 10). Therefore, Jack received 10 emails that day.
"Response:  We know that gra...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that grasshoppers and frogs participated in a hop race. The grasshoppers could jump 15 cm, while the frog could jump 15 cm as well. To find out how far the frog can jump beyond the grasshopper, we need to subtract the distance the grasshopper can jump from the distance the frog can jump. So, the difference between their jumps is:

Frog - Grasshopper = 15 cm - 15 cm = 0 cm

Since the frog did not jump any further than the grasshopper, the answer is 0 cm."
Response:  The grashopper can jump 30 cm and the frog jumps 35 cm. So together they have jumped a total of 30 + 35 = 65 cm.
"Response:  We know that:
Gräshopporna hopped 15 cm (which is equal to 15/100 meters)
Grodan hopped x meters longer than gräshopporna
Musen hopped x meters shorter than grodan
From the problem statement we can conclude that grodan hopped 17 tum (which is equal to 17/100 meters) longer than gräshopporna, so:
x = 17 - 15 = 2 meters
Therefore, grodan hopped 2 meters longer than gräshopporna."
"Response:  We know that gra...
Gräshopporna, grodan och musen had an hop tävling. Gräshopporna hopped 25 cm. Grodan hopped 18 cm longer than gräshopporna and musen hopped 2 cm longer than grodan. How long did musen hop? Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the length of musen's hop as follows: Length of musen's hop = 25 cm + (18 cm - 25 cm) = 47 cm Musen hopped 47 cm."
Response:  We know that gräshopporna hopped 30 cm and grodan hopped 10 inches longer than gräshopporna which means it hopped 40 cm ( since there are 2.54 centimeters in an inch). Now we also know that musen hopped 20 inches longer than grodan which means it hopped 60 cm (since there are 2.54 centimeters in an inch). So finally musen hopped 90 cm (30 + 60) longer than gräshoppan.
"Response:  We know that:
Gräshopporna hopped 30 cm (or 300 mm).
Grodan hopped x cm longer than gräshopporna. Therefore, we can write:
x = 300 + 39 = 369 mm.
Musen hopped y cm shorter than grodan. Therefore, we can write:
y = 369 - 94 = 275 mm."
"Response:  We know that gra...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.
We know that grasshoppers can jump 25 cm, and a frog can jump 32 cm more than grasshoppers. So, the distance the frog jumps is:

32 cm = x cm

Since the mouse jumps 26 cm less than the frog, we can write:

x - 26 cm = y cm

Now, we have two equations:

x = 32 cm
x - 26 cm = y cm

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 48 cm
y = 12 cm

So, the mouse jumps 12 cm."
"Response:  We know that gräshopporna hopped 24 cm and grodan hopped 33 cm longer than gräshopporna. So, we can write this as an equation: 
Gräshoppa = x (since they all hopped the same distance)
Groda = x + 33 ( since Grodan hopped more than gräshopporna)
Now we are given that Musen hopped 5 cm less than Grodan. So we can write this as another equation:
Mus = x - 5
We want to find out how long Musen hopped compared to Gräshoppan. So we need to solve for x in the first equation using Mus as our variable. Solving for x gives us:
x = 38
So Musen hopped 38 cm further than Gräshoppan."
Response:  If grainhoppers jumped 13 cm and then jumped two cm more than them, they would have jumped 15 cm in total (13 + 2 = 15). So, the frog jumped 15 cm.
Response:  The grasshoppers and the frog had a hop-off competition. The grasshoppers hopped 35 cm (tum). Since the frogs hopped four cm more than the grasshoppers, the total distance they hopped together is: 35 + 4 = 49 cm.
Response:  We know that gräshopporna hopped 30 cm and gräshopporna plus grodan hopped together 40 cm (since they hopped 10 cm longer than grodan). Therefore, we can write: Distance = 30 + (10 x 2) = 40 cm. So, grodan hopped 40 - 15 = 25 cm.
"Response:  We know that gräshopporna hopped 15 cm and grodan hopped 37 cm (since 19 tum is equal to 37 cm). Therefore, we can calculate how much longer gräshopporna hopped than grodan as follows:

Gräshopporna hopped 15 cm + 19 cm = 34 cm longer than grodan.

Now, we are given that musen hopped 12 tum shorter than grodan. Since there are 10 cm in one tum, we can convert this distance to centimeters as follows:

12 tum x 10 cm/tum = 120 cm

Therefore, musen hopped 120 cm shorter than grodan."
"Response:  We know that gräshoppan hopped 21 cm and grodan hopped 31 cm (since grodan is longer than gräshoppan). Therefore, we can calculate how much longer gräshoppan hopped than musen as follows:
Gräshoppan - Mus = Grodan - Mus
= 21 cm - 16 cm
= 5 cm
So, gräshoppan hopped 5 cm more than musen."
Response:  We know that the distance grodan hopped is 12 cm and the distance gräshopporna hopped is 17 cm. So we can write this as: Distance = 12 cm. Now let's compare it to the distance grodan hopped: Distance = 12 cm vs Distance = 17 cm. Since 17 cm is greater than 12 cm, we can conclude that grodan hopped farther than gräshopporna. Therefore, the correct answer is: Grodan hopped 5 cm farther than gräshopporna (17 cm - 12 cm).
Response:  We know that gra Shahid is 15 cm away from his destination and he has to reach there as soon as possible. He can only move in one direction which is towards his destination. So, he starts moving towards his destination with a speed of 15 cm/minute. After some time, he realizes that he has covered a distance of 30 cm and now he is 15 cm away from his destination. Now, he needs to cover another distance of 45 cm to reach his destination. So, he increases his speed to 22.5 cm/minute (since he has already covered 30 cm) and reaches his destination after covering a total distance of 75 cm.
Response:  We know that gra Shahid is 14 cm tall and he can jump 14 cm in one hop.  Now let's consider the height of Grogan. According to the problem, Grodan jumps 37 cm more than Gra Shahid. So, Grogan's height would be 37 + 14 = 51 cm.  Next, we need to find out how much longer does Mousa jump than Gra Shahid. The problem states that Mousa jumps 16 cm less than Grogan. So, if Grogan jumps 51 cm, then Mousa will jump 51 - 16 = 35 cm. Therefore, Mousa is 35 cm taller than Gra Shahid.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour and the recipe requires 14 cups in total. So, she needs to add an additional 9 cups of flour (14 - 5 = 9). Now we also know that the recipe requires 6 cups of sugar, which is equal to the amount of flour needed. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than sugar (9 - 6 = 3).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added four cups of flour to make the cake. The recipe requires nine cups of flour and eleven cups of sugar. So we need to find out how many more cups of sugar than flour she needs to add now. To do this, we can divide the number of cups of sugar required (eleven) by the number of cups of flour she has already added (four). This gives us three additional cups of sugar needed. Therefore, Mary needs to add three more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some amount of flour to make the cake. The recipe requires 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. To find out how many cups of flour Mary still needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required:

6 cups (flour) -? = 8 cups (remaining flour needed)

We are given that Mary has already added some flour, but we don't know exactly how much. So, we need to use our reasoning skills to estimate the number of cups of flour Mary has added. Let's assume that Mary has added half of the total amount of flour required for the recipe, which is 3 cups.

Now, let's plug in this value into the equation above:

6 cups (flour) - 3 cups = 5 cups (remaining flour needed)

Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 cups of flour more than what she has already added to complete the recipe."
"Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of flour (not specified in the question), and she needs two more cups of flour to complete the recipe, then we can calculate how much flour she has added so far as follows:

Total number of cups of flour needed for the recipe = 11 cups (as given in the question)
Number of cups of flour Mary has already added =? (we don't know this value)

Now, let's find out how many cups of flour Mary has added so far:

Amount of flour Mary has added = Total number of cups of flour needed - Number of cups of flour Mary has already added
= 11 cups - X cups (where X is the unknown amount of flour Mary has already added)

Since Mary has not yet added any flour, X = 0. Therefore, the amount of flour Mary has added so far is:

Amount of flour Mary has added = 11 cups - 0 cups
= 11 cups

So, Mary has added 11 cups of flour to the recipe so far."
"Response:  If Mary has already added 3 cups of flour to the recipe and the recipe requires 6 cups in total, then we can calculate how many more cups she needs as follows:

Total amount of flour required = 6 cups
Amount of flour Mary has already added = 3 cups
Number of cups Mary still needs = Total amount - Amount already added = 6 - 3 = 3 cups
Therefore, according to the question, the recipe requires 6 cups of flour, and Mary has already added 3 cups, so she still needs 3 more cups."
"Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of flour (let's call it x), and the recipe requires 12 cups of flour in total, then we can calculate how much more flour she needs to add as follows:

Total amount of flour needed = 12 cups
Amount of flour Mary has already added = x cups

To find out how many cups of flour Mary has left to add, we subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed:

Number of cups of flour Mary has left to add = Total amount of flour needed - Amount of flour Mary has already added
= 12 cups - x cups

Since the recipe also specifies that 5 cups of sugar are required, we know that for every cup of flour used, 1/4 cup of sugar is needed. So if Mary adds y cups of flour (where y = x / 4), she will need z cups of sugar, where z = 5 / (4x).

Now we have two equations:

Number of cups of flour Mary has left to add = 12 - x
Number of cups of sugar Mary needs = 5 / (4x)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y:

x = 6 cups (since 12 - 6 = 6)
y = 3 cups (since 5 / (4x) = 5 / (4(6)) = 3)

Therefore, Mary has added 6 cups of flour and needs 3 cups of sugar to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added three cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to make the cake. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount required by the recipe. So, the number of cups of flour needed is:

Total amount of flour required = 9 cups
Amount of flour already used = 3 cups
Number of cups of flour needed = Total amount - Amount already used = 9 - 3 = 6 cups
Therefore, Mary needs to add six additional cups of flour to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 koppar (or 200 grams) of sugar to the mixture. The recipe requires 14 koppar (or 1400 grams) of sugar in total. So, we need to find out how many more koppar (or grams) of sugar Mary needs to add to reach the required amount.
We can do this by subtracting the amount she has already added from the total amount needed:
14 - 2 = 12 koppar (or 1200 grams) of sugar left to be added.
Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 koppar (or 1200 grams) of sugar to the mixture."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour (elven koppar) and the recipe requires 12 cups in total. So we need to find out how many more cups she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour required by the amount she has already added:

12 cups / 11 cups = 1

So, Mary needs to add one more cup of flour to make the tårta according to the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and the recipe requires 10 cups in total. So, she needs to add an additional 3 cups of flour (10 - 7 = 3). Similarly, we know that the recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar, and Mary has already added 2 cups. Therefore, she doesn't need to add any more sugar. Finally, we know that the recipe requires 80 cups of salt, and Mary has already added 0 cups (since the question states ""she hasn't added any salt yet""). So, she needs to add 80 - 0 = 80 cups of salt."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cups of flour to make the cake. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can use the following formula:

Total amount of flour needed = Original amount of flour required - Amount already added

In this case, the original amount of flour required is 12 cups (as stated in the problem), and Mary has already added 2 cups. Therefore, the total amount of flour needed is:

Total amount of flour needed = 12 cups - 2 cups = 10 cups

So, Mary needs to add an additional 10 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour (mjöl) to the recipe. The recipe requires 6 cups of flour in total. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar and salt are required to make up for the difference.
We can start by calculating the amount of sugar needed:
Sugar = Total amount of sugar - Amount already added
= 8 cups - 5 cups
= 3 cups
Now, let's calculate the amount of salt needed:
Salt = Total amount of salt - Amount already added
= 7 cups - 0 cups (since no salt has been added yet)
= 7 cups
Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt to the recipe to complete it."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cups of sugar to the recipe and the recipe requires 13 cups in total. So, we need to find out how many cups she still needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (13 cups) by the amount of sugar she has already added (2 cups):

13 / 2 = 6.5

So, Mary needs to add 6.5 more cups of sugar to the recipe."
Response:  Since Mary has already added four cups of sugar to the recipe, she needs to add three more cups of flour (since there are six cups of sugar and nine cups of flour in the original recipe). Therefore, she needs to add an additional five cups of flour (three cups minus the four cups she has already added). So, the final amount of flour needed is five cups plus the initial four cups, which equals nine cups total.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cups of flour to make the cake. The recipe requires six cups of sugar and nine cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added from the total amount required:

6 cups of sugar - 2 cups of flour = 4 cups of flour needed
So, Mary needs to add four more cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour (mjöl) to the recipe and the recipe requires 14 cups of flour in total. So, she needs to add 3 more cups of flour (mjöl). Now, we need to calculate how many cups of sugar (socker) are required in the recipe. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar, and since Mary has already added 1 cup of sugar, she needs to add an additional 4 cups of sugar to the recipe. Therefore, the final answer is: Mary needs to add 3 + 4 = 7 more cups of sugar than flour (mjöl) to the recipe.
Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of flour (not specified in the question), and she needs 5 more cups of flour to make the recipe, then we can start with the total amount of flour that Mary has available: 3 cups + 5 cups = 8 cups. So, Mary has added 8 cups of flour to the recipe.
"Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of flour (mjöl) and the recipe requires 13 cups of flour in total, then we can calculate how much more flour she needs to add based on the difference between the total required amount and the amount she has already added.
So, if the recipe requires 13 cups of flour and Mary has already added x cups of flour, then she still needs to add 13 - x cups of flour.
We are given that Mary has added 4 cups of flour, so she still needs to add 13 - 4 = 9 cups of flour."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar to make the cake. According to the recipe, we need 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. So, we can calculate how many more cups of flour Mary needs as follows:

14 - 7 = 7 (cups of flour needed)

Now, let's find out how many cups of sugar Mary needs to add:

60 / 2 = 30 (cups of sugar needed)

Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 cups of flour and 30 cups of sugar to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 copper spoons of sugar and 12 copper spoons of flour according to the recipe. To find out how many more copper spoons of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe:

Total amount of sugar required = 11 copper spoons
Amount of sugar Mary has already added = 10 copper spoons
Difference = 11 - 10 = 1 copper spoon
Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 additional copper spoon of sugar to the mixture."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added six cups of flour to make the cake. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can divide the total amount of flour required (3 cups + 10 cups + 15 cups = 28 cups) by the amount she has already added (6 cups). So, Mary needs to add an additional 22 cups of flour (28 - 6 = 22).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added four cups of flour to make the cake. The recipe requires nine cups of flour in total. So, we need to find out how many cups more than nine cups she needs to add now.  To do this, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added (four) from the total amount needed (nine):  Nine - Four = Five. Therefore, Mary needs to add five additional cups of flour to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cups of flour to make the cake batter. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can use the following formula:

Total amount of flour needed = Original amount of flour required - Amount of flour already added

In this case, the original amount of flour required is 9 cups (as stated in the problem), and Mary has already added 2 cups. So, to find out how many more cups she needs to add, we subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required:

Number of additional cups of flour needed = Total amount of flour needed - Amount of flour already added
= 9 cups - 2 cups
= 7 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 7 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour to make the cake. The recipe requires 9 cups of flour. So we need to find out how many more cups of sugar than salt she needs to add now. According to the recipe, for every cup of flour used, you need 6 cups of sugar and 4 cups of salt. Since Mary has already added 12 cups of flour, she needs to add 6 x 12 = 72 cups of sugar and 4 x 12 = 48 cups of salt. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 72 - 48 = 24 cups of sugar and 48 - 48 = 0 cups of salt.
Response:  Since Mary has already added four cups of sugar to the recipe, she needs to add three more cups (7 - 4 = 3). So, she needs to add three additional cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  Since Mary has already added ten cups of sugar to the batter, she needs to add four more cups (since the recipe calls for twelve cups in total). Therefore, she needs to add six additional cups of flour (since one cup of flour is equal to four cups of sugar). So, the final amount of flour needed is sixteen cups (four times the number of remaining cups of sugar).
Response:  If there are 60 bird families that flew away for winter and there are 19 bird families that live near the mountain, then the total number of bird families is 60 + 19 = 79. So, the difference between the number of bird families that flew away (60) and the number that stayed behind (19) is 41. Therefore, 41 more bird families flew away for winter than those who remained at their homes near the mountain.
Response:  If there are 87 bird families living near the mountain and 7 of them flew away for winter, then the number of bird families that stayed behind is equal to 87 minus the number of birds that flew away. So, the answer is 80 (87 - 7).
Response:  We know that out of 20 families of birds that flew away for winter, 14 stayed near the mountain. So, if we subtract 14 from 20, we get 6. Therefore, there were 6 bird families living in the vicinity of the mountain at the beginning.
Response:  We know that 23 bird families flew to Africa and 37 bird families flew to Asia. So, in total, 23 + 37 = 60 bird families left the mountain. Therefore, there were 85 - 60 = 25 bird families remaining near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that 42 bird families flew to Africa and 31 bird families flew to Asia. So, we have:
Africa - 42 + 8 = 50 bird families
Asia - 31 + 8 = 39 bird families
Therefore, there are 50 bird families in Africa more than in Asia."
Response:  We know that 47 bird families flew to Africa and 94 bird families flew to Asia. So, we can write this as an equation: 47 + x = 94 (where x is the number of bird families that flew to both places). Now, we are told that there are 38 bird families that live near the mountain. Therefore, we can subtract these from the total number of bird families that flew to both places: 47 + x - 38 = 94. Solving for x, we get: x = 56. So, there were 56 more bird families that flew to Asia than those that flew to Africa.
Response:  If 38 bird families flew to Africa and 80 bird families flew to Asia, then we have a total of 118 bird families that left their homes in search of warmer climates for winter.  Of these, 18 bird families still live near the mountain, so the number of bird families that stayed behind is 118 - 18 = 100. Therefore, 100 bird families stayed near the mountain during winter.
Response:  If there are currently 87 bird families living near the mountain and 18 new bird families join them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain is now:  $87 + 18 = 105$ bird families.
Response:  We know that 59 families of birds flew away for winter and 24 new families came from the Arctic to settle near the mountain. So, initially there were 59 - 24 = 35 bird families left near the mountain.
"Response:  If there were initially 41 bird families near the mountain and 27 of them flew away for winter, then the number of bird families left nearby the mountain is:

$$ Number \ of \ bird \ families = 41 - 27 = 14 $$
Therefore, there are $14$ bird families left near the mountain after $27$ families flew away for winter."
"Response:  If there were initially 45 bird families near the mountain and 86 bird families flew away for winter, then the number of bird families that stayed behind is:

$$ Number \ of \ bird \ families \ staying = 45 - 86 $$

So, $Number \ of \ bird \ families \ staying = -41$

Therefore, there are $41$ more bird families that fled than those that remained in the area around the mountain during winter."
Response:  We know that 35 bird families flew to Asia and 62 bird families flew to Africa. So, we can write this as an equation: 35 + x = 62 (where x is the number of bird families that flew to Africa). Now, we are told that there are 41 bird families that live near the mountain. Therefore, we can subtract the number of bird families that lived near the mountain from both sides of the equation: 35 + x - 41 = 62. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 20. So, there were 20 more bird families that flew to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that 3 families of birds live near the mountain and they don't migrate. So their number remains constant at 3. Now let's consider the new bird families that arrived from the Arctic. They are 26 in total. Since two families flew further south to overwinter, we need to subtract them from the total number of new arrivals. Therefore, the number of bird families remaining near the mountain is:  3 + 26 - 2 = 31.
Response:  We know that Paul had 253 färgfärgpennor at first and lost or gave away 70 of them during the school year. So, he had 253 - 70 = 183 färgfärgpennor left at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul received 600 färgfärgpennor on his birthday (according to the question). At the end of the school year, he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. So, if we subtract the number of färgfärgpennor he gave away from the total number he received, we can find out how many he still had at the end of the school year. Therefore, the answer is 177.
Response:  We know that Paul had 440 färgfärgpennor to start with and gave away 111 during the school year. So he has 329 left (440 - 111 = 329). Then we are told that he lost 106 färgfärgfärgfärg. So now he has 223 färgfärgpennor left (329 - 106 = 223). Therefore, Paul has 223 färgfärgpennor left.
Response:  We know that Paul received 65 färgfärgpennor as gift on his birthday and gave away 213 during the school year. So he gained 213 - 65 = 148 färgfärgpennor. Now we are told that he lost or gave away 16 färgfärgpennor. Therefore, the total number of färgfärgpennor he had at the end of the school year is 148 + (-16) = 132 färgfärgpennor.
Response:  We know that Paul received 589 paintboxes as gift on his birthday and gave away 571 during the school year, which means he lost 161 paintboxes. Now we need to find out how many more paintboxes he gave away than he lost. To do this, we can subtract the number of paintboxes he lost from the total number of paintboxes he gave away: 571 - 161 = 410. So, Paul gave away 410 more paintboxes to his friends than he lost.
Response:  We know that Paul received 110 paint colors as a gift and gave away 90 during the school year. This means he has 20 more paint colors than he gave away (110 - 90 = 20). Now we are told that he lost 412 paint colors. To find out how many more paint colors he lost than he gave away, we subtract the number of paint colors he gave away from the number he lost: 412 - 90 = 322. So, Paul lost 322 more paint colors than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Paul had 1000 färgfärgfärg at first (his birthday). Then he gave away 563 during the school year and lost 558 due to breakage. So now he has 332 left. To find out how many he got for his birthday, we can divide the number of färgfärgfärg he had left by the number of friends he gave them to: 332 / 563 = 0.6 or 60%. Therefore, Paul received 60% of his original amount of färgfärgfärg for his birthday, which is 60% x 1000 = 600 färgfärgfärg.
Response:  We know that Paul had 500 färgfärgfärg (500 - 52 = 448) after giving some away and losing some. Then he gave 52 more away, so now he has 448 - 52 = 396 left. Finally, he lost 535 färgfärgfärg, so now he has 396 - 535 = -139 färgfärgpennor. Therefore, Paul had lost or given away 139 färgfärgpennor.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 521 färgfärgpennor to start with and he used 66 of them during the school year without losing or giving away any. So, the number of färgfärgpennor left after using 66 is:

521 - 66 = 455

Therefore, 455 färgfärgpennor remained with Paul at the end of the school year."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 531 färgfärg and 38 raderors.  If he did not lose any färgfärg, then he would have 531 - 38 = 493 färgfärg left at the end of the school year. However, we are told that he only has 391 färgfärg left. So, the difference between his initial amount and his current amount is 493 - 391 = 102 färgfärg. Therefore, Paul had 102 more färgfärg than raderingsapparaters at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul had 601 färgfärger and 406 raderorer in total at the beginning of the school year. Then he used some for his birthday gift, but we don't know how many exactly. So let's assume he used half of them (which is an arbitrary assumption). Therefore, after using half of the färgfärger and raderorer, Paul has 601 x 0.5 = 300 färgfärger and 406 x 0.5 = 203 raderorer left. Now, we are told that he didn't lose any raderogummis, so he must have 203 + 601 = 804 färgfärger and 406 - 203 = 203 raderorer left at the end of the school year.
"Response:  We know that Paul received 400 färgfärgpennor on his birthday and he had 315 of them left at the end of the school year. So, we can calculate how many he got rid of as follows:

Number of pennies Paul got rid of = Total number of pennies he had - Number of pennies he had at the end of the school year
= 400 - 315
= 85

Therefore, Paul received 85 färgfärgpennor on his birthday."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 267 färgfärgpennor and lost 231 during the school year. So he has left with 36 (267 - 231) pennors. Now we are asked how many more pennsors gave to his friends than he lost. To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of pens he gave away from the number of pens he lost: 36 - 231 = -195. Therefore, Paul gave away more färgfärgpennor than he lost.
Response:  We know that Paul had 457 rows and 320 color pencils in his box at first. Then he used some of them during the school year and ended up with 523 left. Since he didn't lose any eraser caps, we can conclude that he must have used exactly as many color pencils as eraser caps (523). Therefore, the number of remaining color pencils is equal to the number of eraser caps minus the number of used color pencils. In this case, it is 523 - 523 = 0. So, Paul has zero more color pencils than eraser caps left.
Response:  At first, the server had 11 customers (C). After some of them left, he still had 3 customers (K). So, the number of customers who stayed is equal to the total number of customers minus the number of customers who left (K = C - X), where X is the number of customers who left. Substituting the given values, we get K = 11 - X. Now, we are asked how many more customers the server had than those who stayed. This means that we need to find out the difference between the total number of customers and the number of customers who stayed. Therefore, the answer is K + 1 = 11 - X + 1.
Response:  The server had three customers initially and then some left, so he had fewer customers than before. But according to the question, there are still more customers than those who left, which means that at least one customer stayed behind. So, the number of remaining customers is equal to four (the initial number minus the ones who left). Therefore, the answer is 4.
"Response:  At first, the servant had x customers. After nine customers left, he still had twelve customers. So, we can write an equation:
x - 9 = 12
Solving for x, we get:
x = 20
Therefore, the servant had 20 customers at the beginning."
Response:  We know that initially there were 14 customers and now 5 are left. So, we need to find out how many customers the waiter had at first. To do this, we can divide the total number of customers (14) by the number of customers he currently has (5). Therefore, the waiter had 2.8 customers (14 / 5 = 2.8).
Response:  The servant had 13 customers at first and then lost some of them. After that, he got four new customers. So, if he still has nine customers, it means that he lost 4 + 1 = 5 customers from his initial number of 13. Therefore, he currently has 9 - 5 = 4 customers left.
Response:  The servant had 12 customers initially and lost 15 of them while gaining 14 new ones. So, he has 12 - 15 + 14 = 7 customers left.
Response:  The server had three customers initially and then more customers arrived, making it eight in total. So, new customers who came are 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  If en servitor had eight customers and some of them left, he would have fewer customers remaining. So, if he has 5 customers left after some have gone, that means he started with 8 - 3 = 5 customers. Therefore, he still has 5 customers.
Response:  At first, the server had 12 customers. Then some of them left, leaving him with 14 customers. So now he has 14 + 12 = 26 customers.
Response:  If Dan had $3 left after buying a candy bar for $2, then he must have started with at least $5 (since $3 is less than $5). So, his initial amount of money was $5.
Response:  If Dan had $4 and spent $3 on a chocolate bar, he now has $1 left (4 - 3 = 1). So, the cost of the chocolate bar is $3.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he bought 99 chocolate bars for $3 each. So, he spent a total of $3 x 99 = $297. Now we want to find out how much money is left with Dan after buying those chocolate bars. To do this, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had: $4 - $297 = -$293. Therefore, there are -$293 dollars remaining with Dan.
Response:  We know that Dan has three dollars and he bought two chocolate bars for four dollars each. So, in total, he spent $3 + ($2 x 2) = $10. Therefore, each chocolate bar cost him $10 / 2 = $5.
Response:  We know that Dan has $2 and he spent $6 on chocolate. So, his remaining money is $2 - $6 = $-4.  Now we need to find out how many pieces of chocolate he bought. According to the problem, each piece cost $3. Therefore, if he spent all his money on chocolate, he would have bought $\$4 / \$3 = 1$ piece of chocolate.  Hence, Dan bought one piece of chocolate.
Response:  First, Dan spent two dollars for the chocolate bar, so he has seven - two = five dollars left. Then, he spent three dollars for another chocolate, so now he has five - three = two dollars left. Therefore, there are two dollars remaining after Dan bought both chocolates.
"Response: 
Dan spent $7 on one chocolate bar and $6 on another chocolate. So he has spent a total of $7 + $6 = $13 on chocolates."
"Response: 
Dan has $2 and he spent $6 on one chocolate bar, so now he has $2 - $6 = -$4 left. Then he bought another chocolate for $3, so now he has -$4 + $3 = $1 left. So, he spent more money on chocolate than he had initially. The difference between the amount of money he spent on chocolate and the initial amount of money he had is $6 - $2 = $4. Therefore, the answer to the question is $4."
"Response: 
Dan spent $2 on chocolate and $3 on candy, so he has spent a total of $5 - $2 = $3 on chocolate. Therefore, he has spent more money on chocolate than on candy. The difference between these amounts is $3."
Response:  If Dan has $4 and he bought a candy bar for $8, then he spent $8 - $4 = $4 on the candy bar. So, there are $4 left with him.
Response:  If Dan had $3 left after buying a candy bar and he started with $4, then he spent $4 - $3 = $1 on the candy bar. So, the cost of the candy bar is $1.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he bought 10 chocolate sticks for $3 each. So, he spent $3 x 10 = $30. Now we have to find out how much money is left with Dan. $4 - $30 = $16. Therefore, there are $16 dollars remaining with Dan.
"Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he bought two chocolates for $4 in total. So, if each chocolate cost as much as the other, then... (1 mark)

Answer: $2 ($3 / 3 = $2). (1 mark)"
"Response: 
Dan spent three dollars on one chocolate bar and seven dollars on another chocolate cake. So he has spent a total of $3 + $7 = $10 on chocolates. Therefore, he has spent more money on chocolate than on chocolate cake. The difference between these amounts is $10 - $3 = $7."
"Response: 
Dan spent $7 on one chocolate and $2 on another chocolate kake. So he has spent a total of $9 on chocolates. 
Now let's find out how much more money he spent on chocolates than on gumballs. To do this, we need to subtract the amount he spent on gumballs from the amount he spent on chocolates. 
So, the difference between the amount he spent on chocolates and gumballs is $9 - $4 = $5. Therefore, he has spent $5 more on chocolates than on gumballs."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 115 books and he sold 78 of them at a garage sale. So, we have to find out how many books he has left now. To do this, we can divide the total number of books he had (115) by the number of books he sold (78). This gives us the remaining number of books he has: 115 / 78 = 1.46 or approximately 150 books. Therefore, Paul still has around 150 books.
"Response:  We know that after selling 137 books in a garage sale, he had 105 left. So, if he started with x books, we can set up the equation:
x - 137 = 105
Now solve for x:
x = 206
So, Paul had 206 books at the beginning of the garage sale."
Response:  We know that after selling some books at a garage sale and giving some to his friend, Paul had 62 books left. So, if he sold x books at the garage sale, then he would have 62 - x books left. Since he gave 35 books to his friend, he now has 62 - x - 35 = 27 books left. Therefore, he sold 27 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 50 books and after buying some at a garage sale he had 151 left. So, if we subtract the number of books he bought (let's call it x) from his initial amount, we get: 50 - x = 151. Solving for x, we find that Paul bought 101 books at the garage sale!
Response:  We know that Paul had initially two books (2). Then he sold some of them in a garage sale and bought 150 new ones (150). So, his current number of books is: 2 + (number of books sold) = 2 + 0 = 2. Therefore, he has sold 0 books.
Response:  If Paul had 21 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale, then he has fewer books now than he did at first.  Suppose he sold x books in the garage sale. Then he had 21 - x books left over.    After that, he bought 42 new books. So, his total number of books is now 21 - x + 42 = 63. Since he already had 21 books before selling any, he must have sold x = 40 books in the garage sale. Therefore, he has sold more books (40) than he has bought (42).
Response:  If Paul had initially 71 books and sold some of them in a garage sale, then he has fewer books than before. Let's say he sold x books. Now, if he bought 38 new books, that means he has a total of 71 + 38 = 109 books now. So, he has bought more books (38) than he sold (x). Therefore, the difference between the number of books he bought and the number of books he sold is equal to the number of books he already had minus the number of books he sold, which is 109 - x = 71.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them in a garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens left. To find out how many books he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had. So, the number of books he sold is: 108 - 66 = 42 books.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 106 pens and sold some of them in the garage sale. So he has 14 pens left after selling some. Now we are asked how many pens he sold at the garage sale. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of pens he has left (14) from the total number of pens he had initially (106). Therefore, Paul sold 92 pens at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had 136 books at the beginning and he sold some of them during the garage sale. Let's call the number of books he sold x. Since he got 27 books as payment for his work, we can write an equation: 136 - x = 27. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 136: x = 136 / 136 = 1. So, Paul sold 1 book during the garage sale.
Response:  We know that after giving some books to his friend, Paul had 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Then he sold some books at a garage sale and had 95 - x = 68 books left, where x is the number of books he sold. Since he had 68 books left after selling some, we can set up the equation: 95 - x = 68. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. So Paul sold 27 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 pens and 153 books. After selling some of them in a garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. To find out how many books he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had. So, the number of books he sold is:  Initial number of books - Number of books after the sale = 153 - 13 = 140 books. Therefore, Paul sold 140 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 42 pens and 143 books. After selling some of them in a garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 pens left. To find out how many pens he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of pens he had after the sale from the initial number of pens he had. So, the number of pens he sold is: 42 - 19 = 23. Therefore, Paul sold 23 pens at the garage sale.
Response:  If there were originally ten roses in the vase and Jessica cut eight of them, then there are two roses left from the original amount. So, now there are ten - 8 = 2 roses in the vase.
Response:  In the beginning, there were no roses in the vase (Jessica did not mention anything about any roses being already in the vase). So, the number of roses in the vase at the start was zero (0). Then, Jessica added 16 roses to the vase, which means that now there are 16 + 0 = 16 roses in the vase. Therefore, the correct answer is 16.
Response:  We know that there were initially two roses in the vase and then Jessica threw four roses away from the vase. So now we have six roses left (two initial + four thrown). Then she cut some new roses from her garden to put into the vase, which added another 17 roses (not 23 as stated in the question). Therefore, the total number of roses Jessica cut was 17.
Response:  Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some new ones from her garden to put in the vase. So there are now 17 roses in the vase. If she cut more roses than she threw away, then the number of roses she cut is equal to the difference between the total number of roses in the vase before and after she added the new ones. In other words, we need to find out how many roses were in the vase initially (before Jessica did anything) and how many roses she cut. We can do this as follows: Initially, there were 15 roses in the vase. Since Jessica threw away 33 roses, there are now 15 - 33 = -18 roses fewer in the vase. Therefore, Jessica cut 18 roses.
"Response: 
Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some new roses from her garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. So, she threw away more roses than she cut from her garden. In particular, she threw away 34 - 15 = 19 more roses than she cut. Therefore, the answer is 19."
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 roses in the vase and then Jessica cut some roses from her garden which had a total of 59 roses. So, she must have cut 59 - 7 = 52 roses. Therefore, she cut 52 roses.
Response:  If there were initially 13 rosors in the vase and Jessica cut some from her garden that had 12 roses, then the total number of roses she brought to the vase is 13 + 12 = 25 roses. Since there are now 21 roses in the vase, we can deduce that 6 roses (i.e., 21 - 25) remain in the garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some roses and orchids from her flower garden. Now, there are 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses before she cut them (15) from the number of roses after she cut them (now 17). Therefore, Jessica cut 2 roses.
Response:  We know that there were initially 21 orkidier in the vase and Jessica has cut some from her own garden. So, after she cut them, there are now 10 roses and 21 orkidier left in the vase. To find out how many orkidier Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of orkidier left in the vase after she cut them (21) from the total number of orkidier initialy in the vase (21). Therefore, Jessica cut 10 orkidier.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some roses and orchids from her garden and added them to the vase, so now there are 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of orchids from the total number of roses. So, the answer is 12 - 2 = 10 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  We know that there were originally 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some roses and orchids from her garden and put them into the vase. Now we have 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. So, if we subtract the number of roses (11) from the total number of flowers (33), we get 22 - 11 = 11 more orchids than roses in the vase now. Therefore, there are 11 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  If there were initially three roses in the vase and she clipped some from her garden to add to them, then the total number of roses she added is equal to the current number of roses in the vase minus the initial number of roses in the vase. So, if there are currently 19 roses in the vase, and there were initially three roses in the vase, then she must have added 16 roses (19 - 3 = 16).
Response:  We know that there were originally 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then we are told that Jessica cut some roses and orchids from her flower garden. This means that now there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses before (13) from the number of roses after (14). Therefore, Jessica cut 1 rose.
Response:  We know that there were initially 3 orkidier in the vase and Jessica cut some from her garden. So, after she cut them, there were 7 orkidier left in the vase. Then we are told that Jessica also cut some roses from her garden, but not enough to change the number of roses in the vase (which was 16). Therefore, the total number of orkidier Jessica cut is equal to the initial number minus the number remaining in the vase, which is 3 - 7 = -4.  So, Jessica cut -4 orkidier.
Response:  We know that there were initially 20 orkidées in the vase and Jessica has cut some from her garden to add to it. So now there are 21 orkidées in the vase. Then we know that there were also 6 roses in the vase initially, and Jessica has added more roses from her garden too. Therefore, there are now 22 roses in the vase. Now let’s compare how many roses there are compared to orkidées: There are 22 roses and 21 orkidées, so there are more roses than orkidées in the vase now.  Therefore, the answer is: More roses than orkidées.
Response:  We know that there were initially 6 orkidéers and 9 roses in the vase. Then Jessica cut some roses and orkidéers from her garden and put them into the vase. This means that now there are 13 orkidéers and 3 roses in the vase. So, we can see that there are more orkidéers than roses in the vase right now. Therefore, the number of orkidéers is greater than the number of roses in the vase. The difference between these two numbers is equal to 7 (the number of orkidéers minus the number of roses). Thus, there are 7 more orkidéers than roses in the vase now.
"Response:  If Robin had 17 tum (or 45 cm) long hair and she cut off some centimeters of it, then her new length would be less than 17 tum.  We are given that her new length is 13 tum (or 33 cm). So, we can calculate how much she cut off as follows:

New length - Original length = Cut-off amount
13 - 17 = -4
So, Robin cut off 4 centimeters of her hair."
Response:  Before she cut off 20 cm of her hair, it was 30 cm long (since 20 cm is 67% of 30 cm). So, before cutting her hair, Robin had 30 cm long hair.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin had 16 tum (or 40 cm) long hair before she cut it off. Then, she cut her hair and got 15 cm (or 6 inches). So now, her hair is shorter than before. After that, her hair grew back to 12 tum (or 30 cm), which is less than what it was initially. Therefore, Robin's hair length now is 16 - 15 = 1 tum or 2.5 cm less than its original length of 16 tum or 40 cm.
"Response:  If Robin had 19 tum (or 190 mm) long hair and she grew 18 tum more, then her new length would be:  
Hair length = 19 cm + 18 cm = 37 cm  
So, Robin's hair is now 37 cm (or 14.5 inches) long."
Response:  If Robin had 13 cm of hair and she cut off 13 cm, then how long is her hair now? So, her hair length would be 14 cm - 13 cm = 1 cm or 10 cm. Therefore, Robin's hair is now 10 cm long.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin had 14 tum (or 140 cm) long hair initially. Then, it grew by 20 cm, which is equal to 0.33 meters or 33 cm. So now her hair length is 173 cm (140 + 33). Finally, she cut off 20 cm, leaving her with 153 cm (173 - 20) of hair. Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 153 cm long.
Response:  We know that Danny had 12 flasklockors in his collection before he went to the park. Then, he found 53 additional flasklockors in the park. So, now Danny has 12 + 53 = 65 flasklockors in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny already has 21 flask locks in his collection before he went to the park. Then we are told that he found more flask locks in the park. So, let's assume that he found x more flask locks in the park. Now, we have a total of 21 + x flask locks with Danny. To find out how many flask locks Danny found in the park, we can divide the total number of flask locks he now has (21 + x) by the number of flask locks he had initially (21). Therefore, the answer is:  Number of flask locks Danny found in the park = Total number of flask locks / Initial number of flask locks = 21 + x / 21 = x  So, Danny found x = 30 flask locks in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 63 bottle caps in the park and threw away 51 old ones. So he gained 63 - 51 = 12 new bottle caps. Now he has 33 + 12 = 45 bottle caps in his collection. Therefore, Danny had 45 bottle caps initially.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 flask locks in the park and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 22 new flask locks now. To find out how many more flask locks Danny found than those he threw away, we need to subtract the number of flask locks he threw away from the total number of flask locks he collected. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of flask locks Danny found = Total number of flask locks collected - Number of flask locks thrown away  In this case, the total number of flask locks collected was 36, and the number of flask locks thrown away was 35, so the answer is:  Number of flask locks Danny found = 36 - 35 = 1  Therefore, Danny found one more flask lock in the park than the ones he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 flask locks in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So he gained 30 - 63 = -33 flask locks. Now we are asked how many more flask locks Danny threw away than he found in the park. To find this difference, subtract the number of flask locks he found from the number he threw away: -33 - 30 = -63. Therefore, Danny threw away 63 more flask locks than he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 0 flasklockors and collected 22 flasklockors in total. So he had 22 flasklockors at first. Then, he found 8 more forpacknings in the park, which means he now has 28 flasklockors (22 + 8 = 28). Therefore, the answer is 22.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 22 flasklockors and 30 omslag in the park. Then he found more flasklockors and forpacknings, so his collection increased to 17 flasklockors and 57 forpacknings. To find out how many omslagen Danny had first, we can subtract the number of flasklockors he already had from the total number of omslag he found in the park: 30 - 22 = 8. So, Danny had 8 omslag initially.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 30 flasklockers and found 14 more in the park. So he now has 30 + 14 = 44 flasklockers. Then we are told that he lost 7 flasklockers, so he now has 44 - 7 = 37 flasklockers left. Therefore, the number of flasklockers Danny found in the park is 37.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 0 flasklockors and 0 forpacknings. Then he found 11 flasklockors and 28 forpacknings in the park. So now he has 11 flasklockors and 28 forpacknings. Next, he found additional 68 flasklockors and 51 forpacknings, so now he has 68 flasklockors and 51 forpacknings. To find out how many more omslags than flasklockors Danny found in the park, we need to subtract the number of flasklockors from the total number of forpacknings. Therefore, the answer is 68 - 11 = 57 more omslags than flasklockors found by Danny in the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 71 flasklockors and 24 for packaging in the park. Then he found 28 more flask lockers and 16 more packages. So now he has 71 + 28 = 99 flask lockers and 24 + 16 = 40 packages. Therefore, Danny now has 99 flask lockers.
Response:  At first, Danny had 10 flasklockors and 62 for packaging in the park. Then he found additional 27 flask lockers and 43 more for packaging. So now he has total of 27 + 43 = 70 flask lockers and 62 + 43 = 105 packages in his collection. Therefore, Danny has 105 - 10 = 95 more omslags than flask lockers.
Response:  We know that Danny had 66 flasklockors at first and then he lost some of them in the park. So, if he has 25 left now, it means he lost 41 flasklockors (66 - 25 = 41). Therefore, Danny initially had 41 flasklockors.
Response:  If Danny had 25 bottle locks in his collection before finding any in the park, then he found 32 - 25 = 7 more bottle locks in the park. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 60 old bottles in the park and found 58 new ones. So he has 58 + 60 = 118 bottles now. But then he says he has 67 bottles in his collection. This means he must have collected some more bottles after throwing away the old ones. Therefore, we can conclude that Danny had 118 - 67 = 51 bottles initially.
"Response:  We know that Danny threw away 6 bottles in the park and found 50 new ones. So he has 50 + 6 = 56 bottles now. But then it says ""Now he has 60 bottles in his collection."" This means that he found additional 4 bottles (60 - 56 = 4) beyond what he threw away. Therefore, the number of bottles Danny found in the park is 4 more than the number he threw away. The answer is 4."
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 54 old bottles in the park and found 48 new ones. So he has thrown away more than he has found. Therefore, the number of bottles he threw away is greater than the number he found. In other words, the difference between the number of bottles he threw away and the number he found is positive.  Now we are asked how many more bottles did Danny throw away than he found. To find this, we need to subtract the number of bottles he found from the number he threw away.  Subtracting 48 (the number he found) from 54 (the number he threw away) gives us 6. So Danny threw away 6 more bottles than he found.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 82 caps and 29 bottle caps in the park initially. So, he had 82 + 29 = 111 bottle caps initially. Now, he has 42 additional bottle caps, so he has 111 + 42 = 153 bottle caps now.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 66 for packaging and 39 bottle caps. Then he found 16 more bottle caps and collected 68 additional packages. So in total, Danny had 66 + 16 = 82 packages at first. As for bottle caps, he had 39 + 16 = 55 bottle caps initially. Therefore, Danny had 82 packages and 55 bottle caps when he started collecting them.
Response:  We know that Danny found 46 caps and 50 bottles in the park initially. Then he collected 21 bottles and 52 packages. So, if we subtract what he already had from the total number of bottles he found, we get:  Number of bottles found = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles already collected = 50 - 21 = 29 bottles. Therefore, Danny found 29 bottles in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 65 packages and 5 bottle caps in the park. Then he found 31 more bottle caps and 9 more packages. So, initially, Danny had 65 + 5 = 70 items in his collection. Now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 packages, which means he lost 31 - 9 = 22 items from his initial collection. Therefore, the number of extra bottle caps Danny found is 31 - 22 = 9.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 58 flasklockors and found 25 more in the park. So he now has 58 + 25 = 83 flasklockors. Then we are told that he lost 11 omslag, which means he now has 83 - 11 = 72 flasklockors. Finally, we are told that he gained 12 new flasklockors, so he now has 72 + 12 = 84 flasklockors. Therefore, Danny now has 84 flasklockors in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 15 flasklockors and found 18 more in the park. So he now has 15 + 18 = 33 flasklockors.  Then we are told that for each flasklock he found, he also found 3 times as many packages (i.e., 3 x 18 = 54 packages). Therefore, the total number of packages Danny now has is 33 flasklockors x 54 packages/flasklockor = 1792 packages.  So Danny now has 1792 - 67 = 1725 packages more than he had initially.
Response:  We know that Jake has 17 persimmons and he gave 11 to Steven. So, if we subtract the number of persimmons Jake gave to Steven from the total number of persimmons Jake had, we will get the number of persimmons Steven has. Therefore, the answer is: Steven has 6 persimmons (17 - 11 = 6).
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven. So, if Jake has x persimmons, then Steven has more than x + 7 persimmons (since Steven has 7 more persimmons than Jake). Since Steven has 15 persimmons in total, we can set up an equation as follows:
x + (x + 7) = 15
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x + 7 = 15
Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation gives us:
2x = 8
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:
x = 4
So, Jake has 4 persimmons."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven. So, if Jake has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 13 persimmons. Since Steven has 19 persimmons in total, we can set up the equation:
x + (13) = 19
Solving for x, we get:
x = 6
So, Jill has 6 persimmons."
"Response:  We know that Jake has three persimmons less than Steven. So, if Steven has eight more persimmons than Jill, then Jake must have X fewer persimmons than Jill. Since Jill has five persimmons, we can set up an equation as follows:
Jake = X - 5
Steven = 8 + 5 = 13
Now we need to solve for X. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
X = 13 - 5
X = 8
So, Jake has eight more persimmons than Jill."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven and Steven has more pears than Jill. So if we subtract the number of pears that Steven has from the total number of pears, we will get the number of pears that Jill has more than Jake. Therefore, the answer is:  Jill has 13 more pears than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven and more than Jill. So, if we can find out how many persimmons Steven has, we will be able to determine how many Jake has. According to the problem statement, Steven has 16 persimmons. Therefore, Jake must have fewer than 16 persimmons. Since Jake has seven fewer persimmons than Steven, he must have nine persimmons less than Steven. Thus, Jake has five persimmons (9 - 7 = 5).
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven and more than Jill. So if we add up how many pears each of them have, we can find out how many pears Jill has. Here is what we know about their number of pears:
Jake - 7 less than Steven = 14 (since Steven has 17)
Jill - 8 more than Jake = 22 (since Jake has 14)
So, Jill has 22 pears."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven and more than Jill. So if we let x be the number of pears Jake has, then we can write an equation based on what is given in the problem:
x < 9 (Jake has fewer pears than Steven)
x > 18 (Jake has more pears than Jill)
We also know that Steven has 16 pears, so we can add this to our equations:
x + 16 = 25 (Steven has 25 pears)
Now we have three equations and one variable (x). Can you solve for x using substitution or elimination?"
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 18 persimmons than Jake. So if Jake has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 18 persimmons. Since Jill has five persimmons, we can write an equation: x + (x + 18) = 5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 18 = 5. Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = -13. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = -6. Therefore, Jake has six persimmons.
Response:  We know that Jake has five pears less than Steven. So, if Steven has x pears, then Jake has 5 -x pears.  We also know that Steven has more than Jill. So, if Jill has y pears, then Steven has more than y + 5 = x pears. Now we can solve for x using substitution or elimination method in linear equation. Solving for x gives us x = 23. Therefore, Jake has 23 - 5 = 18 pears more than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven and Steven has more pears than Jill. So if Jill has 12 pears, she must have more pears than Jake. Therefore, the answer is:  Jill has 12 - 16 = -4 more pears than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 19 pears. Since Steven has more apples than Jake, we can say that Jake has y apples, where y < x. Therefore, Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven, which means he has 12(x - y) = 12(30 - y) pears. Solving for y, we get y = 18. So, Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven, which means he has 12(18) = 216 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer pears than Steven and 3 more apples than Steven. So if Steven has x apples, then Jake has 3x - 13 = 2x + 13 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than apples and more apples than pears. So if we compare Jake to Steven, we can say that Steven has more pears than Jake because he has 17 pears while Jake only has 8. Therefore, Steven has 9 more pears than Jake (17 - 8 = 9). Similarly, since Steven has 16 apples and Jake has 8 apples, Steven has 8 more apples than Jake (16 - 8 = 8). In conclusion, Steven has 9 more pears and 8 more apples than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has three fewer pears than Steven and ten more apples than Steven. So if we let P be the number of pears Steven has and A be the number of apples he has, then we can write an equation based on what we know about Jake:
P + 10 = 3 (Jake has 3 fewer pears than Steven)
A = P - 10 (Jake has 10 more apples than Steven)
Now we want to find out how many apples Steven has more than pears. Using the second equation above, we can substitute P for 12 (the number of pears Steven has):
A = 12 - 10
A = 2
So Steven has two more apples than pears."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 persimmons and Jill has fewer than Steven. So, we can say that Jill has x persimmons where x is less than 12. Now, we are told that Jake has four fewer persimmons than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 4x persimmons where x is the number of persimmons Jill has. Since Jill has fewer than 12 persimmons, x must be less than 12. Hence, Jake has 4(less than 12) = 48 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 persimmons and Jake has fewer than 18 persimmons. So, Jake must have less than 18 - 1 = 17 persimmons. Now we are told that Jill has fewer persimmons than Jake, so Jill has 17 or fewer persimmons. Therefore, the answer is 17.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 19 persimmons and Jill has fewer than 19 persimmons. Therefore, we can say that Jill has x number of persimmons where x is less than or equal to 19. Now, we are also given that Jake has 72 more persimmons than Jill. So, if Jill has x number of persimmons, then Jake has (x + 72) number of persimmons. Substituting this value in the equation above, we get:
Jake has 12 + 72 = 84 persimmons.
Therefore, the answer is 84."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 14 persimmons and Jake has fewer than 14 persimmons but more than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x persimmons, then we can write an inequality based on the information given in the question:

x < 14 (since Jake has fewer than 14 persimmons)

We also know that Jill has three more persimmons than Jake, so we can write another inequality:

3 > x - 14 (since Jill has three more persimmons than Jake)

Now we have two inequalities:

x < 14
3 > x - 14

Can you solve these inequalities to find out how many persimmons Jill has?"
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 apples more than Steven. So if Steven has x persimmons, then Jake has 84 + x persimmons. Since Jake also has 10 fewer persimmons than Steven, we can write an equation: 84 + x = 10x - 13. Solving for x gives us x = 23. Therefore, Jake has 23 persimmons.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven. So if Steven has x apples of apples, then Jake has 13 + x apples of apples. Since Steven has 8 persimmons and 12 apples, we can write an equation as follows:
Jake = 13 + (x - 8)
We are also given that Jake has 17 fewer persimmons than Steven. So we can write another equation as follows:
17 = (x - 12)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving them simultaneously gives us the value of x = 20. Therefore, Jake has 20 apples."
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fewer pears than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So if we subtract 8 from the number of pears Steven has (11), we get 3. And since Steven has 10 more apples than Jake, Steven has 10 + 3 = 13 apples more than Jake. Therefore, Steven has 13 more pears than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has three fewer pears than Steven and four more apples than Steven. So if we compare their fruit collections directly, Steven has 19 + 15 = 34 apples and Jake has 27 - 3 = 24 apples. Therefore, Steven has 34 - 24 = 9 more apples than pears (persikors).
Response:  We know that there were $78 in Olive's wallet and she spent $15 at a convenience store. So, we can calculate how much money she has left as follows: $78 - $15 = $63. Therefore, Olive has $63 left in her wallet.
Response:  We know that Olivia spent $78 at the convenience store and she has $33 left with her. So, we can write an equation as follows:  $78 = $33 + x where 'x' is the amount of money Olivia had before going to the convenience store. Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we subtract $78 from both sides of the equation: $33 + x - $78 = $0. Simplifying the equation, we get: $33 = $65. Therefore, Olivia had $65 before going to the convenience store.
Response:  We know that there were $100 in Olive's wallet to start with. Then she took out $148 from an ATM, leaving $159 afterward. So, we can calculate how much she spent as follows: Spent amount = Total balance - Amount taken from ATM = $159 - $148 = $11. Therefore, Olive has spent $11.
"Response: 
1. There were three dollars in Olive's wallet initially. (3)
2. She took out $49 from an ATM. (49 - 3 = 46)
3. After visiting a supermarket, there were still 49 dollars left. (49)
So, she spent more money at the supermarket than she withdrew from the ATM. Therefore, the difference between what she spent and what she withdrew is equal to how much more money she took from the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.
Let X be the amount of money she took from the ATM. Then we can write the equation as follows:
X - 46 = 49
Solving for X, we get:
X = 35
Therefore, Olive took $35 more from the ATM than she spent at the supermarket."
"Response: 
Olivia had $53 in her wallet and took out $91 from an ATM. So she started with $53 + $91 = $144. 
Then after visiting a store, there were $144 - $14 = $130 left. Therefore, she spent more money at the store than she got from the ATM ($14 - $9 = $5)."
Response:  We know that there were $106 in Olive's wallet at first and after visiting a mall and a showroom, there was $26 left. Then she spent $49 in an exhibition room. So we can calculate how much she spent in the store as follows: Total amount of money Olive had = $106 Total amount of money Olive spent = $49 Amount of money Olive had left after spending = $57 ( $106 - $49) Therefore, Olive spent $49 in the store.
Response:  At first, there were $54 in the wallet. After visiting the store, $29 was left. So, she spent $25 ($54 - $29 = $25).
Response:  We know that Olivia spent $38 at a quick stop. So she has $128 - $38 = $90 left in her wallet.
Response:  If Dave had 19 apps on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 14 apps left on his phone. So, he has 14 apps remaining on his mobile device.
Response:  If Dave had $X$ apps on his phone at first and he deleted $3X$ of them, then he has $X-3X=2X$ apps left. So, in the beginning, Dave had $2X$ apps on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had ten apps on his phone initially and he added eleven new ones. So, in total, he has twenty-one apps now (ten + eleven = twenty-one). Then we are told that after deleting some of them, he is left with four apps. Therefore, the number of apps he deleted is equal to the difference between the initial number of apps and the final number of apps, which is twenty-one - four = seventeen.  Hence, Dave has deleted seventeen apps from his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 apps on his phone initially and he added 89 new ones. So, the total number of apps now is 21 + 89 = 110. Then, after deleting some apps, he was left with 24 apps. To find out how many more apps he added than he deleted, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted from the total number of apps he added: 110 - 24 = 86. Therefore, Dave added 86 more apps than he deleted.
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 apps on his phone initially and he added 71 new ones. So, after adding these new apps, he has a total of 86 apps (15 + 71 = 86). Now, we are asked how many more apps he removed than he added. To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of apps he removed from the number of apps he added. In this case, he removed some apps but didn't mention how many, so let's assume he removed 3 apps. Therefore, the difference between the number of apps he removed and the number of apps he added is 71 - 3 = 68. So, Dave removed 68 more apps than he added.
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 apps and 77 files in total initially. After he deleted some of them, he was left with 5 apps and 23 files. To find out how many apps he deleted, we can divide the number of apps he started with (16) by the number of apps he had after deleting some (5). So, Dave deleted 11 apps.
Response:  After Dave had deleted some apps and files, he had 3 apps and 7 files left. To find out how many files he deleted, we can divide the number of files he started with (21) by the number of files he had after deleting some (7). So, he deleted 14 files.
Response:  After Dave deleted some apps and files, he had 21 apps and 4 files left. To find out how many more apps than files he has left, we can subtract the number of files from the total number of apps: 21 - 4 = 17. So, Dave has 17 more apps than files left on his phone.
Response:  After Dave had deleted some apps and files, he had 6 apps and 15 files left. To find out how many more files than apps he has left, we can subtract the number of apps from the total number of files:  15 files - 6 apps = 9 files. So, Dave has 9 more files than apps left on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 17 apps on his phone and then added some more, he would have 18 apps left. So, he must have added 1 app to his phone. Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 59 files and 15 apps initially. After removing some apps and files, he has 12 apps and 30 files left. To find out how many apps he removed, we can divide the number of remaining apps (12) by the initial number of apps (15):

$$ \frac{12}{15} = 0.8 $$
So, Dave removed $4$ apps initially."
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 apps initially. After deleting some apps and files, he had 17 apps and 21 files remaining. To find out how many files Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of files he had after deleting from the initial number of files he had: 21 - 21 = 0. So, Dave did not delete any files.
Response:  After Dave deleted some apps and files, he had 5 files and 12 apps left. So, the total number of files is 5. Now, let's find out how many more apps than files he has left on his phone. To do this, we need to subtract the number of files from the total number of apps: 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, Dave has 7 more apps than files left on his phone.
Response:  After Dave had deleted some apps and files, he had 11 apps and 3 files left on his phone. Then, after he had cleared more apps and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 apps. So, the number of files he has left is 24 - 3 = 21 files. Since he already had 11 apps, the total number of apps he has left is 11 + 2 = 13 apps. Therefore, the difference between the number of files and apps he has left is 21 - 13 = 8 files.
Response:  If Nell had 242 cards and gave 136 to Jeff, then she has 242 - 136 = 106 cards left. So, Nell has 106 cards remaining.
Response:  If Nell had 301 cards to start with and she gave 301 of them to Jeff, then she has none left. So, the number of cards Nell had in the beginning is 0.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, if we subtract the number of cards she has now from the total number of cards she had, we get the number of cards she gave to Jeff. Therefore, the answer is 528 - 252 = 276 cards.
"Response:  If Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff, she now has 535 cards left. So, Jeff must have received some of her cards. Let's call the number of cards he got x. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Number of cards Jeff has = Number of cards Nell gave him (x) + Number of cards Jeff already had (234)

Now, we are asked to find out how many cards Jeff has. So, we solve for x:

x + 234 = 535

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 301

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 150

So, Jeff now has 150 baseball cards."
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card packs initially.  She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she now has 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-card packs left. To find out how many more baseball cards than ten Nell has, we need to subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of baseball cards: 415 - 149 = 266. So, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than ten.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-card sets before giving some to Jeff. So she had a total of  (246 + 214) = 460 cards. Now we are told that she has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-card sets left after giving some to Jeff. Therefore, the number of ten-card sets that Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her original total number of cards and her current total number of cards minus the number of baseball cards she has left:  (460 - 404) = 56. So Nell gave Jeff 56 ten-card sets.
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards and gave some to John. Then she gave even more to Jeff. So, if we subtract the number of cards she gave to John from her original total, we get the number of cards she gave to Jeff.  Therefore, the answer is: 210 - 195 = 15.  So, Nell gave 15 cards to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, but we don't know how many she gave him. So let's assume that she gave him half of her remaining cards, which is 99 cards (since she has 178 - 99 = 79 cards left). Now, since each ten-card pack contains 10 cards, Nell has 18 x 10 = 180 ten-card packs left. Therefore, the number of more than ten baseball cards that Nell has is:  180 - 99 = 81.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-card sets initially. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, but we don't know how many she gave him. So let's assume that she gave him an equal number of baseball cards and ten-card sets (i.e., 119 each). Now, Nell has 376 ten-card sets left, which means she has 257 more ten-card sets than baseball cards (since 376 - 119 = 257). Therefore, the difference between the number of ten-card sets Nell has now and the number of baseball cards she has is 257.
Response:  If Paco had 19 kakor and he ate 19 of them, then he started with x kakor where x is the number of kakor he had before eating any. Since he had 35 kakor left after eating 19, we can write an equation: x + 19 = 35. Solving for x, we get: x = 16. So, Paco started with 16 kakor.
Response:  Paco at first had 28 cookies and he ate some of them. We don't know how many he ate but let's assume it was 5 (just an example). Now Paco has 28 - 5 = 23 cookies left. He then eats 7 more cookies, so now he has 23 - 7 = 16 cookies left. Therefore, Paco ate 5 cookies initially and then 7 more later, so the total number of cookies Paco ate is 5 + 7 = 12. So, Paco ate 12 cookies in total.
Response:  If Paco had 40 kakor and he ate two of them, then he has 38 kakor left.
Response:  Paco bought 25 kakor and he ate five of them. So, the number of kakor that Paco left after eating is:  25 - 5 = 20. Therefore, Paco had 20 more kakor than he bought.
Response:  Paco bought 13 cakes and he ate two of them. So, how many cakes did he buy for more than those he ate? We can write it as follows:  Number of cakes bought = Total number of cakes - Number of cakes eaten  In this case, we have:  Number of cakes bought = 13 - 2 = 11 cakes Therefore, Paco bought 11 cakes in total.
Response:  Paco had 40 kakor to start with and he ate five of them. So now he has 40 - 5 = 35 kakor left. Then, he gave 13 kakor to his friend. Now, he has 35 - 13 = 22 kakor left. Therefore, Paco had 22 kakor left after giving some to his friend.
Response:  Paco at first had 17 cakes and then he ate 14 of them. So, now he has 17 - 14 = 3 more cakes than he gave to his friend. Therefore, Paco ate 3 more cakes than he gave to his friend.
Response:  Paco at first ate 12 cookies and then he ate another 16 cookies. So in total, he ate 12 + 16 = 28 cookies. Now, he gave 21 of them to his friend. So, how many more cookies did he give than he ate? We can see that the difference between the number of cookies he gave (21) and the number of cookies he ate (28) is equal to the number of cookies he initially had (12). Therefore, the answer is 12 - 21 = -9.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 22 sweet cookies and 75 salted cookies. If he ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 salted cookies, then we can calculate how many sweet cookies he has left as follows: Number of sweet cookies Paco had at first = 22 Number of sweet cookies Paco ate = 15 Number of sweet cookies Paco has left = Original number - Amount eaten = 22 - 15 = 7 Therefore, Paco has 7 sweet cookies left.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 9 sweet cakes and 6 savory cakes. He then ate 36 sweet cakes and 3 savory cakes. So, he has eaten a total of 36 + 3 = 40 cakes. Since he started with 9 sweet cakes, he must have had 9 - 40 = -31 sweet cakes left after eating them all. Therefore, Paco had -31 salted cakes left.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 37 sweet cakes and 11 salted cakes. He ate 5 sweet cakes and 2 salted cakes. So, he has now 37 - 5 = 32 sweet cakes and 11 - 2 = 9 salted cakes left. Since he ate more sweet than salted cakes, we can say that he ate more sweet cakes than salted ones. Therefore, the difference between the number of sweet cakes he ate and the number of salted cakes he ate is equal to the total number of sweet cakes he had minus the total number of salted cakes he had. In other words, the difference between 32 and 9 is equal to 32 - 9 = 23. So, Paco ate 23 more sweet cakes than salted cakes.
Response:  We know that Paco had 8 sweet cakes and 6 salted cakes initially.  He then ate 20 sweet cakes and 34 salted cakes. So, after eating, he had 8 + 6 = 14 cakes left (all of them were sweet). Therefore, the number of more salted cakes than sweet cakes that Paco ate is:  34 - 14 = 20.
Response:  If Paco had 36 cookies and he ate 3 of them, then he has 36 - 3 = 33 cookies left. Now, if he had 37 cookies to start with, that means he had 37 - 3 = 34 cookies left after eating 3.
Response:  Paco had 36 kakor in total. He gave 14 to his friend, so he has 36 - 14 = 22 left. Then, he ate 10 more, so now he has 22 - 10 = 12 kakor left. Therefore, Paco has 12 kakor left.
Response:  Paco at first had 41 cookies and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Then he eats 18 more cookies. Now he has 32 + 18 = 50 cookies. Therefore, he ate 50 - 9 = 41 more cookies than he gave away.
Response:  Paco gave 30 kakor to his friend and ate 23 kakor. So, he had 30 - 23 = 7 more kakor than he ate. Therefore, he gave his friend 7 more kakor than he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 34 sweet cakes and he ate 15 of them. So, now he has 34 - 15 = 19 sweet cakes left.  Now we are told that he also had 97 salted cakes and he ate 56 of them. So, now he has 97 - 56 = 41 salted cakes left. Therefore, Paco has 19 + 41 = 60 cakes in total (both sweet and salted).
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 26 salt kakors and 17 sweet kakors. If he ate 14 sweet kakors, then he has 17 - 14 = 3 more sweet kakors left. Similarly, if he ate 9 salt kakors, then he has 26 - 9 = 17 salt kakors left. So, the number of salt kakors Paco had left is 17.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 39 sweet cakes and 6 salty cakes. He ate 23 salty cakes and 32 sweet cakes afterward. So, he ate more sweet cakes than salty ones. To find out how many more sweet cakes he ate, we can subtract the number of salty cakes he ate from the total number of sweet cakes he had: 39 - 23 = 16. Therefore, Paco ate 16 more sweet cakes than salty cakes.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. He ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies. So, the number of salty cookies he left is: 25 - 15 = 10. Therefore, Paco ate more salty cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  Gwen received $7 for her birthday and spent some money. We know she has $5 left after spending money. So, we can calculate how much she spent as follows: Total amount = Initial amount - Remaining amount = $7 - $5 = $2. Therefore, Gwen has spent $2.
Response:  If Gwen received $ for her birthday and spent $8, then she has $6 left. So, Gwen received $6.
Response:  First, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mom for her birthday. Then, her dad gave her $4 more. So, in total, she had $2 + $4 = $6. If she spent $3, then she would have $6 - $3 = $3 left. Therefore, Gwen has $3 left after spending $3.
"Response: 
Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father for a total of $13.  If she spent $4, then she has $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9).  Now let's compare how much more money Gwen got from her mother than from her father:
$9 (from mother) - $5 (from father) = $4
So, Gwen's mother gave her $4 more than her father did."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $3 from her mother and spent $4. So she has $3 - $4 = $1 left with her mother.  Now, we are told that her father gave her $6. So, the total amount of money Gwen received from both parents is $6 + $3 = $9.  Therefore, the difference between the amount of money Gwen received from her father and from her mother is $9 - $1 = $8.  Hence, Gwen's father gave her $8 more than her mother.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and spent $4. So she has $5 - $4 = $1 left with her father.  Now, we are told that her mother gave her $7. So, Gwen now has $7 + $1 = $8 more dollars than what she had initially from her father. Therefore, the difference between the amount of money Gwen got from her father and her mother is $8.
"Response: 
Gwen received $5 from her dad and $2 from her mom for a total of $7. If she spent $6, then she has $1 left ($7 - $6 = $1). So, Gwen got more money from her dad than from her mom. The difference is $4 ($5 - $2 = $4)."
Response:  If Josh had nine marbles in his collection and he lost some of them, then he has fewer marbles now than he did before. So, if he has four marbles left, that means he has lost five marbles. Therefore, Josh has lost five marbles.
Response:  If Josh had x kulor in his collection and lost 21 kulor, then he has x - 21 kulor now. Since he currently has 12 kulor, we can set up an equation as follows: x = 12. Solving for x, we get that Josh originally had 12 kulor in his collection.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh had 19 bullets in his collection initially. Then he lost 11 bullets, so he has 19 - 11 = 8 bullets left. Finally, he found 5 new bullets, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 bullets in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.
Response:  If Josh had four bullets in his collection and lost 16 bullets, he would have 4 - 16 = -12 bullets left. Then, if he found 8 new bullets, he would have -12 + 8 = 6 more bullets than before. So, he lost 6 bullets more than he found.
Response:  If Josh had seven marbles in his collection and lost eight, he would have seven - 8 = 1 marble left. Then, if he found ten new marbles, he would have 1 + 10 = 11 marbles in total. So, he found more marbles than he lost by one marble.
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles in his collection and he found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left in his collection now.
Response:  Josh had initially 20 marbles in his collection and gave two to Jack. So now he has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 22 bullets in his collection and then Jack gave him 20 more bullets. So now he has 20 + 22 = 42 bullets in total.
Response:  If Josh had 19 bullets in his collection before and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 remaining bullets now (19 - 11 = 8).
Response:  If Josh had 22 kulor initially and found 13 more, then he has a total of 22 + 13 = 35 kulor now. However, if he lost 5 kulor during his search, then he has 35 - 5 = 30 kulor left in his collection. So, the correct answer is 30.
Response:  If Josh had 15 kulor in his collection and he found 9 of them, then he has 6 remaining (15 - 9 = 6). However, if he lost 23 kulor, then he now has fewer than 6 kulor left. So, the number of kulor that he lost is equal to the number of kulor he found plus the number of kulor he already had minus the number of kulor he found. In this case, it would be 9 + 6 - 23 = -14. Therefore, Josh lost 14 more kulor than he found.
Response:  We know that Josh had three balls in his collection initially and lost five of them. So, he has three - 5 = 2 balls left. Now, while searching for more balls, he found six new ones. Therefore, the total number of balls he found is 6 + 2 = 8. So, he gained 8 - 5 = 3 balls.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together picked 4 kg of berries. Since Marco had 20 kg of berries, he must have picked twice as many as his dad. So, Marco's berries weighed 8 kg more than his dad's. Therefore, Marco's berries weighed 28 kg (4 kg + 24 kg).
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together picked 15 kg of strawberries. If Marco had 5 kg of strawberries, then his dad must have had 10 kg (15 - 5 = 10). So, his dad's strawberries weighed 10 kg more than Marco's.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together picked 20 pounds of strawberries. His dad had 17 pounds of strawberries. So, if Marco had x pounds of strawberries, then he would have 20 - 17 = 3 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, Marco had 3 pounds of strawberries.
Response:  Marco and his dad together picked 40 jordgubbars (since they are equal in weight). So, their total weight is: 40 x 8 = 320 pounds. Therefore, their combined weight of jordgubbars is 320 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected jordgubbars that weighed 7 kg. Then, when they were returning home, Marco lost three kilograms of jordgubbars. So now, the weight of Marco's jordgubbars is only 3 kg. To find out how much his father's jordgubbars weigh, we can use the fact that they went to pick them together. Therefore, his father's jordgubbars must have weighed 7 kg - 3 kg = 4 kg.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected 20 kg of grapes. Then, when they were returning home, Marco dropped 8 kg of grapes. So now, Marco has 5 kg of grapes left. To find out how much his dad had, we need to subtract the weight of the grapes Marco lost from the total amount they collected initially. Therefore, his dad's remaining grapes would be:  20 kg - 8 kg = 12 kg
"Response: 
Marco and his dad together collected 22 pounds of grapes (or 9.9 kg). Then, when Marco went back to find more grapes, he found an additional 30 pounds (or 13.6 kg), bringing the total weight of all the grapes he found to 42 pounds or 19 kg. Therefore, his dad's original collection of grapes weighed 57 pounds or 26 kg."
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together picked 20 kg of jordgubbars. If Marco's jordgubbar weighed 5 kg, then his dad's must have weighed 20 - 5 = 15 kg.
Response:  If Marco and his dad together picked 17 pounds of cranberries, then Marco alone must have had 17 / 2 = 8.5 pounds of cranberries. Since Marco's cranberries weighed 30 pounds, he had more than his father. Therefore, Marco's cranberries weigh 30 - 8.5 = 21.5 pounds more than his father's.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together picked 20 kg of apples. If Marco's apple weighed 5 kg, then his dad's apple must have weighed more than him. So, his dad's apple weighs 20 - 5 = 15 kg more than Marco's apple.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together picked 30 pounds of apples (which is equal to 13.6 kg). Since Marco's dad's apples weighed 5 kg each, then the total weight of Marco's apples would be: 30 lb / 2 = 15 kg. So, Marco's apples weigh 15 kg or 33 lbs.
Response:  At first, there were two children in the bus. Then more children got on the bus at the bus stop, making it 10 children now. So, the difference between the number of children before and after the bus stop is 8 (10 - 2). Therefore, there are 8 more children in the bus now than there were before.
Response:  We know that initially there were 26 children in the bus and now 38 children have boarded the bus at the bus stop. So, the total number of children in the bus now is: 26 + 38 = 64 children.
Response:  Before reaching the bus stop, there were 2 children who got off the bus and joined their parents. So, initially, there were 39 children on the bus (41 - 2 = 39).
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus and after some of them got off at the bus stop, there were 21 children left in the bus. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of children who got off = Total number of children - Number of children left in the bus.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of children who got off = 43 - 21 = 22. Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the bus stop.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off at the bus stop, leaving 18 children behind. So, we need to find out how many more children were on the bus initially than now. To do this, we can use the following equation: Initial number - current number = difference In this case, the initial number (41) minus the current number (18) gives us a difference of 23 children. Therefore, there were 23 more children on the bus before the bus stop than there are now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 21 children in the bus and then 10 of them got off at the bus stop while some others boarded the bus. So, the number of children left in the bus after this process is: 21 - 10 = 11. Now we are told that there were 16 children in the bus when it departed from the bus stop. Therefore, the number of children who boarded the bus is: 16 - 11 = 5.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 14 children in the bus and then 63 children got off at the bus stop while some new children boarded the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus after this process is:

Total no. of children in the bus = Initially 14 + Children who got off at the bus stop - Children who boarded the bus
= 14 + 63 - x
where x is the number of children who boarded the bus.
Solving for x, we get:
x = 14 + 63 - 14
= 73
Therefore, the number of more children took the bus than those who came off is 73."
Response:  We know that initially there were 36 children in the bus and after some of them got off at the bus stop, 68 children got on the bus while 12 remained inside. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Initially, there were 36 children in the bus = Total number of children who got off + Number of children who got on - Number of children who remained in the bus 36 = x + y - z where x is the number of children who got off, y is the number of children who got on, and z is the number of children who remained in the bus Now, let's solve for x (the number of children who got off): x = 36 - (y + z) Substituting the values given in the question: x = 36 - (68 + 12) x = 36 - 80 x = -44 Therefore, there were 44 more children who got off than those who got on.
Response:  We know that 22 children were in the bus initially and then 40 more got into the bus at the bus stop. So, the total number of children in the bus now is 62 (22 + 40). Then, we are told that two children got off the bus. Therefore, the final number of children left in the bus is 60 (62 - 2).
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children in the bus and after some of them got off at the bus stop, 82 children boarded the bus. So, the total number of children who went from the bus to the bus stop is 82 - 28 = 54. Now we need to find out how many more children took the bus than those who came off it. To do this, we subtract the number of children who came off the bus (30) from the total number of children who went from the bus to the bus stop (54): 54 - 30 = 24. Therefore, 24 more children took the bus than those who came off it.
Response:  We know that 23 children were in the bus and 24 children got off at the bus stop. So, there are 23 - 24 = -1 child less inside the bus when it arrived at the bus stop. Then we know that 8 children were already on the bus when it arrived at the bus stop. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who went on the bus and those who got off is 8 - (-1) = 9 children.
Response:  If baker made 133 tarts and sold 51 of them, then he has 82 remaining (133 - 51 = 82). Now we need to find out how many more tarts the baker made than he sold. To do this, we divide the number of tarts he made by the number he sold: 82 / 51 = 160. So, the baker made 160 more tarts than he sold.
Response:  We know that baker made 54 tarts and sold some of them. So he must have had at least 54 - x tarts left after selling some. Since we are told that he has 13 tarts left, we can set up an equation as follows: 54 - x = 13. Solving for x, we get x = 41. Therefore, baker sold 41 tarts.
Response:  We know that the baker made some tarts and sold them. The number of tarts he sold is given as 145. If he has 72 tarts left, then he must have started with more than 72 tarts. So, the number of tarts the baker made = 145 - 72 = 73.
Response:  If Bäckaren (the baker) made 155 tårtor and his friend bought 140 from him, then he would have 15 - 14 = 1 tårtor left over.
Response:  If baker made 121 tarts and sold 105 of them, he has 16 (121 - 105) left. Then, if he bought 170 new tarts, he now has 34 (16 + 170) total tarts. So, the answer is 34.
"Response: 
We know that bakery made 13 tarts and sold 91 of them. So, he earned $91 from selling those tarts. 
Now, we are told that the baker bought 154 new tarts. This means that he has 63 more tarts than he sold (154 - 91 = 63). 
So, the number of tarts that the baker bought more than he sold is 63."
Response:  We know that baker made 170 tarts and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). Then we are told that he bought 31 new tarts. So now he has 92 + 31 = 123 tarts in total. Therefore, the number of tarts that baker sold more than he bought is 123 - 78 = 45.
Response:  Firstly, we know that baker made 110 tarts initially and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made additional 76 tarts after selling the previous ones. Now, he has total number of tarts as follows: Total tarts = Initial tarts + New tarts = 35 + 76 = 111 tarts. Therefore, baker has 111 tarts left with him.
Response:  Firstly, we know that baker made 144 tarts initially and sold 71 of them. So, he had 73 remaining tarts (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made additional 111 tarts. Now, total number of tarts with him is 73 + 111 = 184 tarts. Therefore, baker made more than he sold.
"Response:  We know that Bakery made 149 tarts and 91 pastries. If he sold 10 cakes and 90 pastries, then we have to subtract those numbers from the total amount of goods produced. So, the number of cakes left with the baker would be:

Total goods produced = 149 + 91 = 236
Sold items = 10 (cakes) + 90 (pastries) = 100

So, there are 236 - 100 = 136 cakes left with the baker."
"Response:  We know that Bakery made 7 tarts and 148 pastries in total. If he sold 15 cakes and 103 pastries, then we need to subtract these amounts from the total number of pastries he had initially. So, the number of pastries the baker still has is:

Total pastries = 148 - (15 + 103) = 148 - 128 = 20
Therefore, the baker still has 20 pastries."
"Response:  We know that Bäcker made 126 tarts and 48 pastries. If he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries, then we can calculate how many more cakes than pastries he made as follows:

Total number of items sold = Number of cakes + Number of pastries = 115 + 81 = 196

Now, let's divide the total number of items sold by the number of items he made to find out how many more cakes than pastries he made:

Factorial difference = Total number of items sold / Number of items made = 196 / 126 = 1.57

So, Bäcker made 1.57 times more cakes than pastries."
"Response:  We know that Bäckaren made 19 tarts and 131 pastries in total. If he sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries, then we can calculate how many more pastries than cakes he sold as follows:

Total number of pastries = 131
Sold number of pastries = 88
Difference between sold pastries and total pastries = 88 - 131 = -43
Therefore, Bäckaren sold 43 fewer pastries than cakes."
"Response:  We know that Bäcker (the baker) sold 158 kakor and 147 bakverk in total. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Kakor = Total number of baked goods - Bakverk

Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get:

Kakor = 158 + 169 - 147
= 204

Therefore, Bäcker sold 204 more kakor than bakverk."
"Response:  We know that Bäcker (the baker) sold 68 tarts and 92 baked goods in total.  So, if he sold more baked goods than tarts, then the difference between the number of baked goods he sold and the number of tarts he sold is equal to the total number of baked goods he sold minus the total number of tarts he sold.  In other words:

Difference = Total # of baked goods - Total # of tarts
= 92 - 54
= 38
Therefore, Bäcker sold 38 more baked goods than tarts."
Response:  If baker had started with 48 tarts and sold 44 of them, then he would have 4 - 44 = 36 tarts left.
Response:  If baker sold 8 tarts and made 40 to start with, then he had 32 tarts left over (40 - 8 = 32). So, if he sold x tarts, he would have x - 8 tarts left over. Therefore, the answer is 32 - x = number of tarts the baker has left after selling x tarts.
Response:  If baker had made 169 tarts to start with and sold 137 of them, then he would have 32 tarts left (169 - 137 = 32).
Response:  If baker made 173 tarts and sold 86 of them, that means he has 87 left (173 - 86 = 87).  Then, if he bought 103 new cakes, it means he now has 87 + 103 = 190 tarts in total. So, the answer is 190.
"Response: 
We know that Bäckaren (the baker) made 99 tårtor and sold 89 of them. So he has 99 - 89 = 10 more tårtor than he sold.  Therefore, the number of tårtor that Bäckaren bought is equal to the number of tårtor he sold plus the number of tårtor he already had, which is 10 + 99 = 109.  Hence, Bäckaren bought 109 tårtor more than he sold."
"Response: 
* The baker made 8 tarts.
* He bought 139 new cookies and sold 145 cookies.
So he has 145 - 139 = 6 more cookies than he bought.
Therefore, the baker sold more than he bought."
Response:  Firstly, we know that baker made 62 tarts initially and then he made additional 149 tarts. So in total, he has made 62 + 149 = 211 tarts. Now, we are told that he sold 144 of them. Therefore, the number of tarts left with the baker is 211 - 144 = 67 tarts.
Response:  The baker made 81 tarts initially and then he made 92 more. So in total, he made 81 + 92 = 173 tarts. Now, he sold 46 tarts. So, the number of tarts that the baker had left after selling is 173 - 46 = 127 tarts. Therefore, the baker made more tarts than he sold.
"Response:  We know that Bakery made 167 tarts and sold 108 of them. So, if we subtract the number of tarts he sold from the total number of tarts he made, we get:

167 - 108 = 59

So, Baker has 59 tarts left in stock."
Response:  We know that Bakery made 56 bakverks and 124 tarts. If he sold 104 cakes and 29 bakverks, then we need to find out how many bakverks are left after selling those amounts. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of remaining bakverks = Total number of bakverks - Sold amount of bakverks So in this case, the total number of bakverks is 56 + 124 = 180. Now let's calculate the amount of bakverks sold: 104 + 29 = 133. Therefore, the number of remaining bakverks is: 180 - 133 = 47. So, Baker still has 47 bakverks.
"Response:  We know that Bakery made 52 bakverks and 84 tartors. If he sold 102 cakes and 94 bakverks, then we can calculate how many more cakes than bakverks he sold as follows:

Total number of items sold = Number of cakes + Number of bakverks
= 102 + 84
= 186

So, the baker sold 86 more cakes than bakverks. In other words, for every 3 bakverks the baker sold, he sold 4 cakes."
"Response:  We know that Bakery made 134 bak goods and 11 tartors. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 bak goods, then we can calculate how many more bak goods than cakes he sold as follows:

Total number of bak goods = 134 + 92 = 226
Total number of cakes = 140
Difference between total number of bak goods and total number of cakes = Total number of bak goods - Total number of cakes
= 226 - 140
= 86
Therefore, Baker sold 86 more bak goods than cakes."
Response:  We know that Bagaren (the baker) made 14 tarts and 153 bread rolls. If he sold 8 bread rolls and 97 tarts, then we can calculate how many more tarts he sold as follows: Number of tarts sold = Total number of tarts - Number of tarts sold = 140 - 97 = 43 So, Bagaren sold 43 more tarts than he did initially.
"Response:  We know that Bäcker (the baker) sold 154 bak goods and 78 tartes. So, we can write this as an equation:

Bak goods = 154
Tartes = 78

Now, let's find out how many more bak goods than tartes were sold:

More bak goods than tartes = Bak goods - Tartes
= 154 - 78
= 76

So, Bäcker sold 76 more bak goods than tartes."
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and wants to have 140 games left, she needs to buy more games until she reaches that number. We can do this by subtracting the number of games she already has from 140. So, we need her to buy:

$ Number of games Kelly needs = 140 - 22 $= 118
Therefore, Kelly needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games to reach her goal of having 140 games left."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and gives away 64 of them, then she will have 106 - 64 = 42 remaining games.
Response:  If Kelly had 91 Nintendo games at one point and she still has 92 games now, then she must have started with zero games (since she cannot have had more than 92 games). So, initially, Kelly did not have any Nintendo games.
Response:  If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and wants to have 12 left, she needs to give away 8 of them (20 - 12 = 8).
Response:  If Kelly has 132 Sony-spel and wants to have 31 Sony-spel left, she needs to give away 101 Sony-spel (132 - 31 = 101).
Response:  If Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and she found 31 of them, then she must have given away 49 games (80 - 31 = 49). To get six matches remaining, she would need to give away 7 games more (6 / 7 = 0.86 or approximately 9 games). So, Kelly needs to give away 9 games more to have six matches remaining.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 52 blocks to build his tower and there are 38 blocks left. So if he had x blocks at the beginning, we can write an equation: 52 = x/38. Solving for x, we get: x = 160. Therefore, Randy had 160 blocks at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. If there are 72 blocks left after building the tower, then we can say that Randy used x number of blocks to build the tower, where x is the difference between the total number of blocks (97) and the number of blocks left (72). Therefore, the answer is 25.
"Response:  We know that Randy has 79 kvarter and he uses 14 kvarter to build a tower. So, we have:

79 - 14 = 65

Now, we are asked how many kvarter are left after building a house using 11 kvarter. Therefore, we can subtract 11 from 65:

65 - 11 = 54

So, there are 54 kvarter left after Randy builds his house and tower."
"Response:  We know that Randy has 58 quarters and he uses 27 quarters to build the tower and 53 quarters to build the house. So we can write this as follows:
Tower = 27 quarters
House = 53 quarters
Now we need to find out how many blocks Randy used in total to build both the tower and the house. To do this, we multiply the number of quarters used for each building by the number of blocks per quarter. For the tower, there are 4 blocks per quarter (since each quarter contains 4 blocks), so:
Blocks needed for Tower = 27 quarters x 4 blocks/quarter = 108 blocks
For the house, there are also 4 blocks per quarter (just like the tower), so:
Blocks needed for House = 53 quarters x 4 blocks/quarter = 212 blocks
Therefore, Randy used a total of 320 blocks (108 + 212) to build both the tower and the house."
Response:  We know that Randy has 37 blocks and he uses 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of blocks = Number of blocks used for tower + Number of blocks used for house.  In this case, the total number of blocks is equal to 37, so we can set up the equation like this:  37 = 33 + 13.  Solving for the value of 33, we get:  33 = 20.  Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 86 blocks and he uses 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. So, we can write an equation as follows: Tower = 79 blocks House = 82 blocks Now, we need to find out how many more blocks Randy used for building the house than for building the tower. To do this, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the total number of blocks available: Number of blocks used for the house = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for the tower In this case, the total number of blocks is 86, and the number of blocks used for the tower is 79, so we can calculate the number of blocks used for the house as follows: Number of blocks used for the house = 86 - 79 = 8 blocks Therefore, Randy used 8 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
"Response:  If Randy uses 36 quarters to build a tower and he has 59 quarters in total, then we can calculate how many quarters are left for building the tower as follows:

Quarters used = 36
Total quarters = 59

Now, let's divide the number of quarters available (59) by the number of quarters used (36):

Number of quarters remaining = Total quarters - Quarters used = 59 - 36 = 23

Therefore, there are 23 quarters left for building the tower."
Response:  We know that Randy has 95 blocks and he uses 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. So, we can write an equation as follows: Blocks used for building a house = 20 Blocks used for building a tower = 50 Now, we need to find out how many more blocks were used to build the tower than the house. To do this, we subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks available (95): Number of blocks used for building the tower - Number of blocks used for building the house = 50 - 20 = 30 Therefore, Randy used 30 additional blocks to build the tower compared to the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks and he uses 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks Randy used for building the house than for building the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the total number of blocks available (90). So, the difference between the two numbers is: 89 - 63 = 26. Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and you have not read five of them, then you have not read any of them. So, the answer is zero (0).
Response:  If there are currently 13 books in the series and you have read 8 of them, then there are still 5 more books left to read in the series. Therefore, the total number of books in the series is 13 + 5 = 18.
Response:  We know that there are 22 books in total and you have already read 12 of them. So, we need to find out how many books you still have left to read. To do this, divide the total number of books (22) by the number of books you have already read (12). This gives us 18 books remaining for you to read. Therefore, you have 18 books left to read.
Response:  If there are four books and 17 films in the series, that means there are 4 x 17 = 68 items in total.  Since you have read 19 books and seen 7 movies, you still need to see 68 - 7 = 61 more movies. Therefore, you have 61 movies left to watch.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 19 books and seen 13 movies, then we can determine how many more books than films there are in the series as follows:

Books - Films = Number of More Books
= 19 - 13 = 6

Therefore, there are six more books than films in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  If there are eight books and ten films in the series ""Crazy Silly School"", then we know that there are 8 x 10 = 80 items in total.  If you have seen 61 movies from this collection, it means that there are 61 - 80 = 21 more movies than books in the series. Therefore, there are 21 additional movies in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
Response:  If there are 10 books and 11 films in the series, that means we have a total of 10 + 11 = 21 items in the series.  If you have read 13 books, then you have not seen any films since there are only 11 films in the series. Therefore, the number of more books than films you have read is 13 - 11 = 2.
Response:  If there are 11 books and 17 films in the series, that means you have read 7 books if you have read 7 books out of 11. Similarly, if you have seen 21 films out of 17, then you have watched 21 films. So, the answer is 21.
"Response:  If there are 8 books in the series that you have read so far and there are total of 14 books in the series, then we can calculate the number of remaining books as follows:

Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books read
= 14 - 8
= 6

So, you have 6 more books left to read from the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
Response:  If there are 62 films and you have seen 34 of them, that means you still need to watch 28 more movies.  Similarly, if there are 19 books in the series and you have read four of them, then you still have 15 books left to read. Therefore, the number of books you have left to read is 15.
Response:  If there are eight films in the series and you have seen four of them, then you have 8 - 4 = 4 remaining films to see.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 films and 15 books in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 11 books and seen 40 movies, then we can calculate how many more books than movies there are in the series as follows:

Number of books - Number of movies = Total number of books + movies
= 11 - 40 = 51

So, there are 51 more books than movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 films and 11 books in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 13 books and seen 63 films, then we can calculate how many more films than books there are as follows:

Films - Books = (63 - 13) = 50

So, there are 50 more films than books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 films in the series. If we assume that you have read all of them, then you must have read 10 x 1 = 10 books. Since you have seen 19 films, it means that you have not watched any more than 6 + 1 = 7 additional films beyond what you have read. Therefore, the difference between the number of books you have read (10) and the number of films you have seen (19) is equal to 7. So, the correct answer is 7.
Response:  If there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series, that means there are 8 x 1 = 8 books you have read if you have seen all of them. Similarly, if there are 5 movies and you have seen 19 of them, then you have seen 5 x 19 = 95 movies. Therefore, the difference between the number of movies you have seen (95) and the number of books you have read (8) is 95 - 8 = 87. So, you have seen 87 more movies than books.
Response:  If Dave has already won seven tickets and he used some of them to buy toys, then he must have had at least two tickets left after buying the toys. So, the number of tickets Dave used for buying toys is equal to the number of tickets he had left minus the number of tickets he used to buy the toys. In this case, if he had two tickets left (as mentioned in the question), then he must have used one ticket to buy the toys. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  If Dave had won 15 tickets and used 12 to buy toys, then he has 3 tickets left (15 - 12 = 3). So, Dave won 3 tickets in the game hall.
"Response:  If Dave has won 18 tickets and he uses 5 to buy toys and 11 to buy clothes, then how many tickets does he have left?

Step 1: Count the number of tickets used for buying toys and clothes. In this case, 5 + 11 = 16 tickets are used.

Step 2: Subtract the number of tickets used from the total number of tickets won (18). So, 18 - 16 = 2 tickets are left with Dave.

Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left after using some of his winnings to buy toys and clothes."
Response:  If Dave had won 19 tickets and he used 12 for toys and 7 for clothes, then we can say that he has 19 - (12 + 7) = 5 remaining tickets left. So, Dave used more tickets for clothes than for toys. Therefore, the difference between the number of tickets Dave used for clothes and toys is equal to the total number of tickets Dave had minus the number of tickets he used for both. In other words, the difference is equal to 19 - 5 = 14.  Hence, Dave used 14 more tickets for clothes than for toys.
Response:  If Dave won 13 tickets and used 8 for toys and 18 for clothes, then he has 13 - 8 = 5 more tickets left over for clothes than he did for toys. So, Dave used 5 more tickets for clothes than he did for toys.
Response:  If Dave had won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, he would have 14 - 2 = 12 remaining tickets.
"Response:  If Haley had 14 trees in her backyard before the tornado and after the tornado 9 of them died, then we have:

Number of trees that survived = Total number of trees - Number of trees that died (9)
= 14 - 9
= 5

Therefore, 5 trees survived the tornado out of the original 14."
Response:  If Haley had 13 trees in her backyard before the tornado and after the tornado 6 died, then we have to find out how many trees survived the tornado. We know that 7 trees survived (13 - 6 = 7). So, there were 7 more trees that survived than those that died.
Response:  If Haley had 20 trees in her backyard and after a tornado only four remained, then we can say that 16 trees died in the tornado (20 - 4 = 16).
Response:  If Haley had 12 trees left after the tornado and she planted 3 new ones, then she has 12 + 3 = 15 trees now.
"Response: 
Haley had 5 trees after the tornado (T). Then she planted 5 more trees (M), so now she has 10 trees in total (T + M = 10). Therefore, Haley still has 10 trees left in her backyard."
Response:  At first, Haley had 12 trees in her backyard. After a tornado killed two of them, she had 10 trees left. So, Haley has 10 trees remaining in her backyard.
Response:  If Haley had planted three trees initially and after a tornado killed 13 trees in her backyard, then we need to find out how many more trees died than survived. We know that 10 trees died (since 13 - 3 = 10). So, the answer is 10.
Response:  If Haley had initially odlad 11 trees and two of them died after the tornado, then the number of surviving trees is equal to 11 minus 2 = 9. Therefore, 9 more trees overcame the tornado than those that died.
"Response:  If they harvest 66 sacks of oranges per day and each sack contains 28 oranges, then we can calculate how many oranges are harvested per day as follows:

66 sacks/day x 28 oranges/sack = 1740 oranges/day"
Response:  If they can harvest 8 baskets per day, it will take them 3 days to harvest 24 baskets of oranges. Therefore, the answer is 3 days.
"Response:  If they will be skoring for 4 days and they have total of 56 pears to skor, then we can calculate how many pears they will skore each day as follows:

Day 1: Total number of pears = 56 / 4 = 14 pears/day

Day 2: Total number of pears = 14 x 2 = 28 pears/day

Day 3: Total number of pears = 28 x 2 = 56 pears/day

Day 4: Total number of pears = 56 - (14 + 28 + 56) = 0 pears/day

Therefore, they will skor 14 pears per day on Day 1, 28 pears per day on Days 2-3, and 0 pears per day on Day 4."
Response:  If they harvest 38 sacks of oranges per day and each sack contains 42 oranges, then after 49 days of harvesting, they will have collected 38 x 49 = 1762 sacks of oranges.
Response:  If they harvest 66 sacks of oranges every day and each sack contains 25 oranges, then they will have collected 66 x 25 = 1650 oranges per day. Since there are 87 days left to collect oranges, the total number of oranges collected will be 1650 x 87 = 143,500 oranges.
Response:  If they harvest 8 baskets per day and each basket contains 35 oranges, then they will harvest 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If they can harvest 16 sacks of oranges per day and each sack contains 57 oranges, then they will need to harvest for 80 sacks = 80 x 16 = 1280 days. Therefore, it would take them 1280 days (or approximately 3 years) to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.
Response:  If they harvest 67 sacks of oranges per day and each sack contains 12 oranges, then they will harvest a total of 67 x 12 = 804 oranges per day.  Therefore, if they harvest 35 sacks of oranges in total, they will have harvested a total of 35 x 12 = 420 oranges.
Response:  If they are harvesting 74 sacks of oranges per day and throwing away 71 of them, then in total, they will have collected 74 x 51 = 3651 sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvesting.
Response:  If they throw away 64 sacks of oranges every day and they collect 76 sacks of oranges per day, then we can calculate how many oranges they collect in total as follows: Total number of oranges collected = Number of sacks collected x Number of oranges in each sack Total number of oranges collected = 76 x 50 = 3800 oranges per day So, they collect 3800 oranges per day.
"Response:  If they harvest 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges every day, then after 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected a total of:

Ripe oranges = 28 x 26 = 704 sacks
Unripe oranges = 52 x 26 = 1328 sacks

Therefore, after 26 days of harvesting, they will have a total of 704 + 1328 = 2032 sacks of oranges."
Response:  If they harvest 82 sacks of ripe oranges and 61 sacks of unripe oranges per day, then after 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 82 x 25 = 2050 sacks of ripe oranges and 61 x 25 = 1525 sacks of unripe oranges in total. Therefore, after 25 days of harvesting, they will have 2050 + 1525 = 3575 sacks of oranges altogether.
"Response:  If they have 24 sacks of unripe oranges after 45 days of harvesting, and they are harvesting 31 sacks of ripe oranges per day, then we can calculate how many sacks of unripe oranges they will have after 45 days as follows:

Unripe oranges = Total unripe oranges / Number of days of harvesting
= 24 sacks / 45 days
= 0.53 sacks (or approximately 1/2 sack)

Therefore, after 45 days of harvesting, they will have approximately 1/2 sack of unripe oranges."
Response:  We know that in total they harvested 69 sacks of oranges (44 + 25). Now we need to find out how many more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe ones were collected each day. To do this, we divide the number of ripe oranges by the number of days it took them to collect all those oranges. If it took them 10 days to collect all 69 sacks, then they collected 6.9 sacks of ripe oranges per day ($ \frac {44} {10} = 4.4 $ ripe oranges/day). So there are $ 4.4 $ more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe ones collected each day.
Response:  We know that there are 5 sacks of ripe oranges and 74 sacks of unripe oranges per day. So, if we subtract the number of ripe oranges from the total number of oranges, we get: Total number of oranges = Number of ripe oranges + Number of unripe oranges - Ripe oranges = 5 + 74 - 5 = 69 sacks of oranges per day. Therefore, more than 69 sacks of unripe oranges are being harvested each day compared to the number of ripe oranges.
Response:  If they harvested 54 sacks of oranges in total and they were harvesting 18 sacks per day, then it took them 3 days to harvest all the oranges. Therefore, the answer is 3 days.
"Response:  If they harvested 56 sacks of oranges in total and worked for 14 days, we can calculate how many sacks they harvested per day as follows:

Total number of days = Total number of sacks / Number of sacks per day
= 14 /?

So, if they harvested 56 sacks of oranges in total and worked for 14 days, they must have harvested approximately 4 sacks of oranges per day (56 / 14)."
Response:  If they harvest 5 sacks of ripe oranges every day and it takes them 73 days to gather all the oranges, then they will have gathered 5 x 73 = 365 sacks of ripe oranges in total.
Response:  If they harvest 65 sacks of unripe oranges per day and it takes 6 days to gather all the oranges, then they will have 6 x 65 = 390 sacks of unripe oranges after 6 days.
"Response:  We know that in total they harvested 41 + 86 = 127 sacks of oranges per day. So if there are more mature than immature oranges, then the number of mature oranges is greater than 127. Therefore, the difference between the number of mature and immature oranges skorted per day is 127 - x where x is the number of immature oranges skorted per day. Since we want to find out how many more mature oranges are skorted than immature oranges, we can set up an equation as follows:

Mature oranges skotted per day = Immature oranges skotted per day + Difference

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Mature oranges skotted per day = 127 + (x - 41)

Solving for x, we get:

X - 41 = 86

X = 45

Therefore, there are 45 sacks of immature oranges skorted per day."
"Response:  If they harvest 71 sacks of unripe oranges and 60 sacks of ripe oranges per day, then we can calculate how many more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested than ripe oranges as follows:

Unripe orange sacks / Ripe orange sacks = More unripe orange sacks harvested per day

So, if they harvest 71 sacks of unripe oranges and 60 sacks of ripe oranges per day, then the number of more unripe orange sacks harvested per day is:

71 - 60 = 11

Therefore, there are 11 more sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day than ripe oranges."
Response:  Length = 4 meters Breath = 3 meters Now we know that length is greater than breadth. So let's write an inequality to represent this relationship: Length > Breath In this case, the difference between length and breath is 1 meter (4 - 3). Therefore, her room is 1 meter longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse's rum is two meters long (2 m). If she needs a mattress in size 14 square feet (14 ft²), we can convert this to meters using the conversion factor of 0.1097 square meters per square foot (m²). Therefore, the width of her room is:  Breadth = Length x Conversion Factor = 2 m x 0.1097 m²/ft² = 0.2194 m = approximately 0.22 meters.
"Response:  We know that Jesse's rum is two meters wide and she needs a mattress of 14 square feet.  To convert meters to square feet, we can use the conversion factor of 0.1396 square feet per meter. So, we can calculate the length of her room as follows:
Length = Width x Conversion Factor
= 2 meters x 0.1396 square feet/meter
= 2 x 0.1396 = 0.2892 meters
Now, let's convert this value from meters to square feet:
Area = Length x Width
= 0.2892 meters x 14 square feet
= 4.1576 square feet
Therefore, Jesse's room is approximately 4.1576 square feet in length."
Response:  We know that Jess has already covered 16 square meters of floor with her rug. To find out how much more area she needs to cover the entire floor, we can subtract the area she has already covered from the total area of the floor. The total area of the floor is given as 30 square meters (3 x 5 = 15 + 2 x 5 = 10). So, we need to subtract the area she has already covered from the total area of the floor: 16 square meters - 16 square meters = 0 square meters. Therefore, Jess does not need any additional mattes to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The length of Jessie's rum is two feet long and the width is twelve feet wide. Since each platform is one square meter, we need to find out how many platforms will cover the entire floor area. We can do this by dividing the total area of the floor (length x width) by the size of each platform. In this case, the total area of the floor is 24 square meters (12 x 2 = 24). So, we divide 24 by 10 (the number of platforms in a square meter), which gives us 240 platforms needed to cover the entire floor area.
Response:  The length of Jessie's rum is given as 6 meters and its width is also 6 meters. Since she has 20 rooms in total, we need to find out how much area each room covers. Therefore, we can calculate the area of one room as follows: Area = Length x Width = 6 m x 6 m = 36 square meters Now, since there are 20 rooms in total, we need to multiply the area of one room by 20 to get the total area that needs to be covered: Total Area = 36 sqm x 20 = 720 square meters So, Jessie needs to cover 720 square meters of floor space with her mat.
Response:  The room is 6 meters wide and 6 meters long, so it has an area of 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Since the length of the room is greater than its width, we can say that the ratio of the length to the width is greater than 1. So, if the length of the room is L meters, then the width is W meters, where W < L. Therefore, the length of the room is longer than its width by a factor of L/W. In this case, L = 6 meters and W = 6 meters, so the length of the room is longer than its width by a factor of 6/6 = 1. Thus, her room is 7 meters long (6 + 1) than its width.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug of size ten square meters to cover her room. Since we are given that the length of her room is one and half meters (1.5 m), we can calculate its width as follows: Width = Length x Area per Meter / Size of Rug Area per Meter = 1.5 m x 10 sqm / 10 sqm = 1.5 m So, the width of Jesse's room is 1.5 meters.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug of ten square meters to cover her room. Since we are given that her room is two feet wide (which is equal to 0.66 meters), we can calculate the length of her room as follows: Length = Width x Area of Room / Area of Rug Length = 0.66 m x 10 m / 10 sqm = 0.66 m Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is approximately 0.66 meters or 2.17 feet.
Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square meters of carpet and her room is 1 meter long and 6 meters wide. To find out how much carpet she needs to cover the entire floor, we need to divide the area of the room by the area of one square meter. So, if we divide 18 square meters by 10 (since there are 10 square meters in one square meter), we get 180 square meters. Therefore, Jesse needs 180 square meters of carpet to cover the entire floor of her room.
Response:  We know that Razorback T-shirt-butiken earned $23 per sold T-shirt and they made $230 during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of T-shirts = Total amount earned / Price per T-shirt So, let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Number of T-shirts = $230 / $23 = 10 T-shirts Sold Thus, Razorback T-shirt-butiken sold 10 T-shirts during the match.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling three T-shirts is $51. So, we can write an equation as follows: 3T = $51. Where T represents the cost of each T-shirt. Now, let's solve for T: 3T = $51 ÷ 3 = $17 per T-shirt. Therefore, each T-shirt costs $17.
Response:  We know that Razorback T-shirt-butiken sold $87 worth of T-shirts per sale and they sold a total of 95 T-shirts during both matches combined. So, if they sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas match alone, then we can calculate how much money they made from those sales as follows: Total amount earned = Number of shirts sold x Price per shirt = 47 x $87 = $4099. Therefore, Razorback T-shirt-butiken earned $4099 on 47 T-shirts sold during the Arkansas match.
"Response:  We know that Razorback T-shirt-butiken sold $106 per shirt and they sold a total of 242 shirts during both games. So, if they sold 115 shirts during Arkansas game, then they sold x shirts during Texas Tech game. Since we are given that the sum of the number of shirts sold during both games is equal to 242, we can set up the equation:

x + 115 = 242

Solving for x, we get:

x = 127

Therefore, Razorback T-shirt-butiken sold 127 shirts during the Texas Tech game."
Response:  We know that Razorback T-shirt store earned $98 per sold T-shirt and they sold 163 T-shirts during both Arkansas match and Texas Tech match. So, if they sold 89 T-shirts during Arkansas match alone, then how much money did they earn from selling T-shirts during Arkansas match?  Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Total amount of money earned = Number of T-shirts sold x Price per T-shirt = 163 (total number of T-shirts sold) x $98 (price per T-shirt) = $15,744. So, the answer is $15,744.
Response:  We know that Razorback T-shirt sales total $78 per shirt and they sold 186 T-shirts during both matches combined. So, if they sold 172 T-shirts during the Arkansas match alone, how much money did they make from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech match?  To find this out, we can use the following equation: Total amount of money made = Number of T-shirts sold x Price per T-shirt During the Texas Tech match, they sold 172 T-shirts, so the amount of money they made from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech match is: $78/T-shirt x 172 T-shirts = $13,044 Therefore, they made $13,044 from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech match.
Response:  We know that Razorback Butikken earned $62 per T-shirt and $99 per hoodie.  During the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, they sold 183 T-shirts and 31 hoodies. So, we can calculate their total revenue from T-shirts as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt = 183 x $62 = $11,506 Therefore, Razorback Butikken earned $11,506 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
"Response:  We know that Razorback-butiken sold $67 per T-shirt and $165 per sweatshirt.  During the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, they sold 74 T-shirts and 156 sweatshirts. So, we can calculate how much money they made from each item as follows:
T-shirts: 74 x $67 = $4892
Sweatshirts: 156 x $165 = $25,340
Therefore, Razorback-butiken made a total of $29,828 from selling both T-shirts and sweatshirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game."
Response:  We know that Razorback Butikken earned $192 per T-shirt and $34 per hat.  During the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech match, they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 hats. To find out how much more a T-shirt costs than a hat, we can subtract the price of a hat from the price of a T-shirt for each sale. For example, if they sold one T-shirt for $192 and one hat for $34, then the difference between the two prices is $192 - $34 = $158. Therefore, a T-shirt costs $158 more than a hat.
"Response:  We know that the profit from each T-shirt is $86 and the profit from each jersey is $232. So, if we sell x T-shirts and y jerseys, then the total revenue will be:
R = 86x + 232y
We are also given that they sold 254 T-shirts and 43 jerseys during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equation to find out how much more a jersey costs than a T-shirt:
R = 86(254) + 232(43) = 21700 + 966 = 22666
So, the cost of one jersey is $22666 / 43 = $520 per jersey. This means that a jersey costs $520 more than a T-shirt."
Response:  We know that Razorback-T-Shirtbutiken sold each t-shirt for $51. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech match, they offered a discount of $8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. So we can calculate how much money they made from selling t-shirts as follows: Total amount earned = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt Total amount earned = 130 x $51 = $6,430 Therefore, Razorback-T-Shirtbutiken made $6,430 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech match.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold = Total number of shirts available x Price at which they were being sold $= 201$ x $201 = 40,200$ dollars. Since during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the price was increased by $217$ for each shirt, the number of shirts sold during that time can be calculated as follows: Number of shirts sold during the match = Total number of shirts available x Price at which they were being sold during the match $= 40,200$ x ($217 + $201) / $201 = 14$ shirts. Therefore, the amount of money received from selling T-shirts is: Amount received from selling T-shirts = Number of shirts sold x Price per shirt $= 14$ x ($217 + $201)$ / $201 = $3,568$.
Response:  We know that the butik made $60 in total from selling t-shirts during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech. If they make $10 per t-shirt sold, then we can calculate how many t-shirts were sold as follows:  Number of t-shirts = Total amount earned / Price per t-shirt So, number of t-shirts = $60 / $10 = 6 t-shirts Therefore, the butik sold 6 t-shirts during the match.
Response:  We know that the butik made $215 from selling 5 T-shirts during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of each T-shirt as follows: Cost = Total revenue / Number of T-shirts sold = $215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt.
Response:  We know that Razorback Butiken earns $5 per t-shirt and $215 per hoodie.  During the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, they sold 20 t-shirts and 64 hoodies. So, we can calculate how much money they made from selling t-shirts as follows: Total amount earned from selling t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt = 20 x $5 = $100 Therefore, Razorback Butiken made $100 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
Response:  We know that each tröja brings $76 in revenue and each T-shirt brings $204 in revenue. So, if they sold 2 tröjor, they brought in $156 in revenue ($76 x 2 = $156). If they sold 158 T-shirts, they brought in $31,960 in revenue ($204 x 158 = $31,960). Therefore, the total amount of money they made from selling tröjor is $156 + $31,960 = $32,116.
Response:  We know that the profit from each t-shirt is $240 - $210 = $30 and similarly for tröjan. So, we need to find out how many t-shirts are sold in total. According to the question, 177 t-shirts were sold. Now, let's calculate the total profit from selling t-shirts: Total Profit from T-Shirts = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Profit per T-Shirt = 177 x $30 = $5,310. Similarly, we can calculate the total profit from selling tröjor: Total Profit from Tröjor = Number of Tröjor Sold x Profit per Tröj = 23 x ($240 - $210) = $6,980. Therefore, the difference between the cost of a t-shirt and a tröja is: Difference = Cost of a Tröja - Cost of a T-Shirt = $6,980 - $5,310 = $1,670.
"Response:  We know that the profit from each t-shirt is $25 and the profit from each jersey is $115. So if we want to find out how much more profitable a jersey is than a t-shirt, we need to subtract the profit of a t-shirt from the profit of a jersey.  Therefore, let's calculate the profit of each item separately:
Profit of a t-shirt = Number sold x Profit per unit = 113 x $25 = $2725
Profit of a jersey = Number sold x Profit per unit = 78 x $115 = $9060
Now, let's subtract the profit of a t-shirt from the profit of a jersey:
$9060 - $2725 = $6335
So, a jersey costs $6335 more than a t-shirt."
"Response:  If they have five sets of tables and chairs with ten chairs in each set, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50. However, if they decide to have their party in the backyard, it means that there are more than five sets of tables and chairs because they mentioned ""their bakgård"". So, we can conclude that they have at least six sets of tables and chairs (6 x 10 = 60). Therefore, they have more stools than tables."
Response:  We know that there are two tables with an equal number of chairs in the backyard. So, if we divide the total number of chairs equally between the two tables, each table will have half of the total number of chairs. Therefore, the number of chairs at each table is 6 (half of 12).  So, for each table, there are 6 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 9 chairs in total (3 x 3 = 9). Since each pair of chairs has 1 table, we can conclude that they have 9 / 2 = 4 tables. Therefore, they have 4 pairs of tables or 8 tables in total.
Response:  If they have 11 sets of tables and chairs with 13 chairs in each set, then how many chairs do they have in total?  They have 11 x 13 = 143 chairs.  Now, if they decide to have the party in their backyard, how many chairs will they need for the party?  They will need at least one chair per table, which is 11 tables x 1 chair/table = 11 chairs. So, they will need 143 - 11 = 132 chairs for the party.
Response:  If there are 10 sets of tables and chairs (50 tables + 30 chairs), and each set contains 6 chairs, then we have in total 60 chairs. Now let's count how many people will sit at these chairs: if 11 people attend the party, they will occupy all the seats except one seat per table. Therefore, 1 chair will be left empty. So, 11 - 1 = 10 chairs will be occupied, leaving 59 chairs unoccupied.
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Additionally, there are six extra chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs for guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  If they have four sets of tables and each set has three chairs, then the total number of chairs is 4 x 3 = 12. Since there will be 14 people at the party, they need to buy 12 - 14 = -2 more chairs. So, they don't need to buy any additional chairs.
Response:  We know that they have 9 pairs of tables (since there are 9 in total). Each pair consists of one table and two chairs. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of chairs = Number of tables x 2. Substituting this value into our original equation gives us: Number of chairs = 9 x 2 = 18. So, they have 18 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If Om Lewis earns $460 during a 5-week harvest period, then he earns $92 per week ($460 / 5 weeks).
"Response:  If Lewis earns $16 per week, and he earned a total of $1216 during the harvest, then we can calculate his weekly income as follows:

$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks

Therefore, the harvest lasted for 78 weeks."
Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, he will have earned a total of $4,592 ($21 x 216). However, if he has to pay $702 in taxes, then his remaining amount after taxes would be $3,890 ($4,592 - $702). So, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $3,890 left.
Response:  If Om Lewis earns $1357 per week during 223 weeks of harvest season, then he earns total amount of money = $1357 x 223 weeks = $296,410 in one year. Now, if he works for 73 years, his total earnings will be = $296,410 x 73 years = $20,863,330.
"Response: 
Lewis earns $28 per week during the 109 weeks of harvest season and an additional $939 per week for overtime work. To find out how much he earns during the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings for those 109 weeks.
Total earnings during harvest season = Weekly earnings x Number of weeks in harvest season
= $28 x 109
= $2,872
Now, let's find out how much he earns from overtime work during the harvest season. Since he works overtime every week, his total overtime earnings can be calculated as follows:
Total overtime earnings = Overtime pay per week x Number of weeks worked
= $939 x 109
= $102,610
So, Lewis earns a total of $2,872 + $102,610 = $105,482 during the harvest season."
Response:  If Lewis earns $403 per week during the 233 weeks of harvest and he has to pay $49 per week in taxes, then his total income for the harvest season is:  Income = Weekly income x Number of weeks = $403 x 233 = $93,570 So, during the harvest season, Lewis makes $93,570.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $368 per week during the 1359 weeks of harvest and he has to pay $388 in rent every week, how much does he pay as rent during the harvest season?

Step-by-step calculation:

Total number of weeks of harvest = 1359 weeks
Total amount earned during harvest = $368 x 1359 = $472,072
Total amount paid as rent during harvest = $388 x 1359 = $516,772

Therefore, Lewis pays $516,772 as rent during the harvest season."
Response:  If Lewis earns $491 per week for 118 weeks of harvesting and he has to pay $216 in rent every week, then his total income from harvesting is:  $$ Total Income = Number of Weeks \times Weekly Earnings $$ = 118 weeks \* $491/week = $57,088  Now, let's subtract his weekly rent from his total income:  $$ Net Income = Total Income - Rent Paid $$ = $57,088 - ($216/week) x Number of Weeks = $53,664  Therefore, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $53,664 left after paying his rent.
"Response:  If he earned $133 in total during a period of under 19 weeks, then we can calculate his weekly earnings as follows:
$133 / 19 = approximately $7 per week. Therefore, Lewis earns around $7 per week."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per week during harvest time and he earned a total of $178, then we can calculate how many weeks the harvest lasted as follows:

$2/week x number of weeks = Total amount earned
Total amount earned = $178

Now, to find out how many weeks the harvest lasted, we divide the total amount earned by the amount earned per week:

Number of weeks = Total amount earned / $2/week
Number of weeks = $178 / $2
Number of weeks = 89 weeks (round up to nearest whole number)
Therefore, if Lewis earns $2 per week during harvest time and he earned a total of $178, the harvest lasted for approximately 89 weeks."
Response:  If the water is ten times deeper than Dean and he stands at three meters, then we can calculate how much deeper the water is compared to him as follows: Water depth = 10 x (Dean's height) + 3 = 10(3) + 3 = 30 + 3 = 33 meters deep. Therefore, the water is 33 meters deeper than Dean.
"Response:  We know that after resting they decided to bathe. The water depth is twice Dean's height. Dean is 2.5 meters shorter than Ron. If Ron stands at four meters, how deep was the water?

Answer: Water depth = 4 m x 2 = 8 m"
Response:  We know that Ron is 5 times taller than Dean and Dean is 3 meters shorter than Ron. So if Ron stands at 12 feet tall, then Dean would be 9 feet (3 x 3) below him. Now we need to find out how deep the water is. According to the problem, the water is 5 times deeper than Ron's height, so it will be 5 x 12 = 60 feet deep.
Response:  We know that after resting they decided to bathe and we are given that the water is 15 times deeper than Dean's height. So if Dean is 1.8 meters tall (or 180 cm), then the depth of the water is 15 x 1.8 = 270 cm or approximately 9 feet 6 inches.
"Response:  We know that after resting they decided to bathe and we are told that the water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height. So if Ron stands at 4 meters tall, how deep will the water be?

Step 1: Convert Ron's height from meters to feet.
Ron's height = 4 meters × (3.2808 feet/meter) = 13.11 feet

Step 2: Calculate the depth of the water using the given information.
Water depth = 16 x Ron's height = 16 x 13.11 feet = 217.96 feet

Therefore, the water is approximately 218 feet deep."
"Response:  We know that after resting they decided to bathe and we are given that the water is nine times deeper than Dean's height. So if Dean is six meters shorter than Ron who is five meters long then the depth of the water would be:
Depth = 9 x Height of Dean = 9 x (5 - 6) = 9 x 4 = 36 meters deep
Therefore, the water was 36 meters deep."
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and wants to divide them equally between two bookshelves, then each shelf will have 34/2 = 17 books.
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then he has 42 / 2 = 21 bookshelves. Therefore, Brian has 21 bookshelves.
Response:  If Brian has 27 books in his bookshelf and each shelf can hold 5 books, then he has 27/5 = 5 books per shelf. Similarly, if he has 80 magazines and each magazine rack can hold 10 magazines, then he has 80/10 = 8 magazines per rack. Therefore, Brian has 5 x 23 = 115 books and 8 x 23 = 186 magazines total.
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book takes up one shelf space, then he has 9 shelves for his books. Similarly, if he has 46 magazines and each magazine takes up one shelf space, then he has 46 shelves for his magazines. So, in total, Brian has 9 + 46 = 55 shelves for his books and magazines.
Response:  If Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves, he will have a total number of books = 23 x 29 = 647 books. Similarly, if he has 61 magazines in each of his 29 magazine racks, he will have a total number of magazines = 61 x 29 = 1809 magazines. Therefore, Brian has a total of 647 + 1809 = 2456 items in all his bookshelves and magazine racks.
Response:  If Brian has seven bookshelves with an equal number of books in each shelf, then he has 7 x 7 = 49 books in total. So, there are 49 / 7 = 6.71 books per shelf on average.
Response:  If Brian has 38 books and each bookshelf contains two books, then he must have 38/2 = 19 bookshelves. Therefore, Brian has 19 bookshelves.
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to ten friends and each package contained two invitations, then she would need at least five packages of invitations to ensure that no friend is left out. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If Carol sent out birthday invitations to 12 friends, then she must have bought at least 3 packages of invitations with an equal number of invitations in each package. Therefore, there are 3 x 12 = 36 invitations in total.
Response:  If Carol bought 7 packages of invitations and each package contains 10 invitations, then she has a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations to give away.  Since she only wants to send them to two friends, that means there are 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left over after she sends them out.
Response:  We know that Carol bought 6 packets of invitations with each packet containing 14 invitations. So she has purchased a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she also bought an additional 11 invitations. Therefore, the total number of invitations Carol can send out is 84 + 11 = 95 invitations.
Response:  If Carol bought two packets of invitations with three invitations each, then she has a total of 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). To bide nine friends, she needs to buy additional 3 invitations (9 - 6 = 3). So, she needs to buy one more packet of invitations. Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each match and she got total 36 points then we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of matches x Points per match So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Total score = 36 points / 1 match = 36 points Now, since there is no information about how many matches Melissa played, we cannot determine the exact number of matches she played. Therefore, the answer to the question is ""More than one match."""
Response:  If Melissa played three matches and got a total of 81 points, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per match (81/3 = 27). So, in each match, Melissa scored 27 points.
Response:  If Melissa scored 109 points in each match and got 82 bonus points in each match, then her total score for one match is: Total score = 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now, if she played 79 matches, her total score would be: Total score = 191 x 79 = 14,539 points. So, Melissa scored 14,539 points in 79 matches.
"Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in total and got 7 points in each of the matches she played, then we can write an equation as follows:

Total points = Number of matches x Points per match

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total points = 21 points / 3 matches
= 7 points/match x 3 matches
= 21 points

So, Melissa played 3 matches."
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in total and she scored the same number of points in each match, then we can say that her average score per match is equal to 91/13 = 7 points per match. Therefore, Melissa scored 7 points in every match.
Response:  If there are 20 people who can ride at the same time and we want to know how many each place can accommodate, then we need to divide the number of people by the number that can ride simultaneously. So, in this case, if 20 people can ride at once, then each place can accommodate 20/1 = 20 people. Therefore, each place can accommodate 20 people.
Response:  If there are places on the Paris wheel in Paradise Park and each place can accommodate nine people, then we need to calculate how many places there are on the wheel. We know that 18 people can ride on the wheel at the same time, so we divide 18 by 9 to get the number of places on the wheel. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that each Pariserhjul in Paradise Park has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. Therefore, we have a total of 19 x 15 = 285 people who can ride on these 20 Pariserhjul at the same time.
Response:  We know that there are 18 seats in each car of the Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 chairs are broken, then we have 18 x 15 = 270 available seats for passengers. Therefore, 270 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.
Response:  We know that there are six places in the Ferris wheel and each place can hold 14 people. So, if there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, then we have reached the maximum capacity of 92 people (6 x 14 = 84 + 16). Therefore, no more people can go on the Ferris wheel.
Response:  The big wheel can hold 54 people, and each small place holds 14 people. So, if we divide 54 by 14, we get 3.86 (round up to 4). Therefore, 4 people can ride on the small chairs of the Parisian Ferris Wheel at one time.
Response:  The big room can accommodate 12 people, and there are two small rooms that each hold 16 people. So in total, we have 12 + 16 = 28 people who can go on the Ferris wheel at once.
Response:  If 16 people can ride on the Ferris wheel at the same time in Paradise Park, then each car of the Ferris wheel has space for how many people?  To find out, we need to divide the number of people who can ride on the Ferris wheel simultaneously (16) by the number of cars on the Ferris wheel (4). So, each car of the Ferris wheel can accommodate 4 people.
Response:  If four people can ride on the Ferris wheel at the same time in Paradise Park, then each place on the Ferris wheel has two people. Therefore, the number of places on the Ferris wheel is equal to the number of people who can ride it simultaneously, which is 4 x 2 = 8. So, the Ferris wheel has 8 places.
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices, then there are 7 x 14 = 98 slices in total. Since each pizza has the same number of slices, it means that each pizza has 98/7 = 14 slices. Therefore, each pizza has 14 slices.
Response:  If each pizza has two slices and we ordered a total of 28 slices, then we must have ordered 14 pizzas (28 / 2 = 14). Therefore, we bestelled 14 pizzas.
"Response:  If we have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then the total number of pizza slices is:

17 x 4 = 68

So there are 68 pizza slices in total."
Response:  If we have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since there are two people sharing the pizzas, they will get 90/2 = 45 slices each.
"Response:  If they planted 10 seeds in each of 45 flower beds, then...

Answer:  They planted a total of 450 seeds (10 x 45 = 450)."
Response:  If they planted 45 frön in total and divided them equally among 9 blomsterbäddar, then each blomsterbädd would contain 5 fröner (45 / 9 = 5).
Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 36 seeds in total. Since only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each of the 12 beds, we can conclude that there were 12 beds in total. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total.  They put 15 seeds in each of 3 blister beds. So they have 3 x 15 = 45 seedlings in total. Now we are told that only 60 out of these 45 seedlings grew into flowers. Therefore, the number of flowers is equal to 60 / 45 = 1 1/3 or approximately 3.67 flowers.
Response:  If Paige and her mom planted 10 seeds in each of 60 beds, then they had 60 x 10 = 600 total seeds. So, they had 600 / 10 = 60 beds. Therefore, they had 60 beds.
Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers in eight flower beds and they planted 32 seeds total, then we can assume that they planted an equal number of seeds in each flower bed. Therefore, if they planted 32 seeds in each flower bed, then they planted 4 seeds (32/8) in each flower bed.
Response:  If Matthew gave two kicks to each of his eleven friends, then he had given a total of 2 x 11 = 22 kicks away. So, Matthew had 22 - 2 (the number of kicks he initially had) = 18 kicks left.
Response:  If Matthew had eight cookies to give away and he gave two cookies to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 2 x 8 = 16 cookies away. So, he gave kicks to 16 friends.
Response:  If Matthew gave away 15 cookies and had 10 left over, that means he had 15 + 10 = 25 cookies in total. Since there are 5 friends, each friend got 25 / 5 = 5 cookies from Matthew.
Response:  If Matthew had 24 cookies and gave an equal number to his three friends, then he would have given away 8 cookies (since 3 x 8 = 24). So now Matthew has 16 cookies left ( since 16 - 8 = 8). Now if he gives away 5 more cookies to his friends, he will be left with 11 cookies ( since 16 - 5 = 11). Therefore, Matthew gave away 5 cookies to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 kicks and gave an equal number to his eleven friends, then he would have given 22/11 = 2 kicks to each friend.
Response:  If Matthew had 29 kakor and gave an equal number to his two friends, then he would have given 14 kakor to each friend (since 29 / 2 = 14). So, the answer is 14 kakor per friend.
Response:  If Matthew had 14 cakes and 21 tartes, that means he has in total 35 sweets (14 + 21).  If he gives an equal number of sweets to his seven friends, then each friend will get 5 sweets (35 / 7 = 5).
"Response:  If Matthew gave out 18 boxes of cookies to his friends and he had 36 boxes in total, then we can calculate how many cookies each friend got as follows:

Number of boxes per friend = Total number of boxes / Number of friends
= 36 boxes / 18 friends
= 2 boxes per friend

Therefore, each of Matthew's 18 friends received 2 boxes of cookies from him."
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his friends one kiksa (kaka), then he had given out 36 kiksar in total. So, if he had 36 kiksar and 3 friends, then he gave 12 kiksar to each friend.
Response:  We know that Matthew had 23 cookies and gave some to his two friends. If he gave an equal number of cookies to each friend, then we can say that he gave 11 cookies to each friend. So, the number of cookies each friend received is 11.
Response:  We know that Matthew had 31 cakes and gave away an equal number to his 5 friends. So he must have given them 6 cakes each (31 / 5 = 6). Therefore, Matthew gave 6 cakes to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 32 keks and 98 tårtor to share among his four friends, then he would have given each friend an equal number of both keks and tårtor. So, if we divide 32 by 4, we get 8 keks per friend. Similarly, if we divide 98 by 4, we get 24 tårtor per friend. Therefore, Matthew gave each friend 8 keks and 24 tårtor in total.
"Response:  If Matthew had 10 cakes and 8 tortes to start with, and he divided them equally among his four friends, then each friend would get:

Cakes: 10 / 4 = 2.5 cakes per friend (rounded up to 3 cakes)
Tortes: 8 / 4 = 2 tortes per friend (no rounding needed)
So each of Matthew's friends got 3 cakes and 2 tortes in total."
"Response:  If Matthew had 28 friends and he gave each of them an equal number of cakes and pies, then the total number of cakes and pies given out would be:
Cakes = 28 x 13 = 340
Pies = 28 x 15 = 420
So, each friend received 340 cakes and 420 pies."
"Response:  If Debbie bought water bottles when they were on sale and she drank 109 bottles per day for 74 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she had purchased as follows:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days that Debbie drank water bottles.
Total number of days = Number of days on sale x Number of bottles drunk per day
= 74 days (given in the question) x 109 bottles/day (given in the question)
= 8,236 days

Step 2: Convert the total number of days to months.
Months = Total number of days / Number of days in a month
= 8,236 days / 30 days/month
= 274 months

Therefore, Debbie had purchased 274 water bottles during the period of time that she was drinking them."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 153 water bottles when they were on sale and she drank the same number of bottles every day. If the bottles lasted for 17 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she drank per day as follows:

Number of bottles drunk per day = Total number of bottles / Number of days used
= 153 / 17
= 9

So, Debbie drank 9 water bottles every day."
"Response:  If Debbie bought 264 water bottles when they were on sale and she drinks 15 bottles per day for 11 days, we can calculate how many bottles she has left as follows:

Day 1: She drinks 15 bottles, so she has 264 - 15 = 249 bottles left.
Day 2-11: Each day, she drinks 15 more bottles, so she has 249 - (15 x 11) = 230 bottles left.
Therefore, Debbie has 230 water bottles left."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 301 water bottles and she drunk 144 per day for some days. So we can write an equation: 

Debbie = Number of days x Number of bottles drunk per day

We are given that Debbie has 157 bottles left, so we can substitute this value in the equation: 

157 = (Number of days) x (144)

Now we need to solve for number of days. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 144: 

Number of days = 157 / 144

So, Debbie drunk water for approximately 28 days."
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 88 water bottles and 13 soda cans at a discount. If she drinks 4 water bottles and 87 soda cans per day, we need to find out how many days the water bottles will last her. To do this, we divide the number of water bottles she has (88) by the number of days she will use them (the difference between the total number of bottles and the number of bottles she drinks per day). So, in this case, the water bottles would last Debbie for approximately 88 / (88 - 4) = 88 / 84 = 106 days. Therefore, the answer is 106 days.
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 200 water bottles and 256 soda bottles when they were on sale. If she drinks 312 water bottles and 4 soda bottles per day, we can calculate how many days the soda bottles will last as follows:

Total amount of soda = 256 x 4 = 1024
Total amount of water = 312
Days to finish soda = Total amount of soda / Amount of soda consumed per day = 1024 / 4 = 256 days
Therefore, the soda bottles would last for approximately 256 days."
Response:  If Debbie bought 12 water bottles and each bottle can hold up to 0.5 liters of water, then she would have a total capacity of 6 liters (12 x 0.5 liters). Since she wants to know how many days these bottles will last her, we need to divide the total capacity by the amount of water she drinks per day. According to the question, she drinks an average of 2 liters of water per day. Therefore, the number of days that the 12 water bottles will last her is: 6 liters / 2 liters = 3 days. So, Debbie's 12 water bottles will last her for 3 days.
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 water bottles initially. If she drinks 15 water bottles per day, then in total, she will use up 15 x 30 = 450 water bottles in one month (assuming a month has 30 days). Since there are only 180 water bottles available initially, this means that after 450 / 180 = 2.5 months, all the water bottles will be used up. Therefore, the water bottles will not last for more than 2.5 months.
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 water bottles. If she drank 122 water bottles per day, then she would run out of water in 4 days (since there are 360 / 122 = 3 days worth of water left). Since she only drank 9 soda bottles per day, it will take her approximately 45 days to finish those ( since there are 360 / 9 = 40 days worth of soda left). Therefore, the soda will last for 45 days.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pens in 14 rows with 11 pens in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of pens as follows: Total number of pens = Number of rows x Number of pens in each row Total number of pens = 14 x 11 = 154 Pens Therefore, Faye has 154 pens.
Response:  If we divide 12 into three equal parts, each part will contain 4 blyertspenna (since 12 divided by 3 equals 4). So, in total, Faye placed 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 blyertspenna on the table.
Response:  We know that Faye has 28 packets of pens and each packet contains 24 pens. Therefore, in total, she has 28 x 24 = 672 pens. Since she wants to place her pens in rows, we need to divide this number by the number of rows she can make. To find out how many rows she can make, let's assume that each row requires 16 pens (as stated in the question). So, dividing 672 by 16 gives us 43 rows. Therefore, Faye could make 43 rows with her pens.
Response:  We know that Faye has six packs of pens with 14 pens in each pack. Therefore, she has 6 x 14 = 84 pens in total.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 35 pens and 7 colors of ink. Each row contains 5 pens, so we can calculate how many rows she could make as follows:

Number of rows = Total number of pens / Number of pens per row
= 35 / 5
= 7

Therefore, Faye could make 7 rows with her 35 pens and 7 colors of ink."
"Response:  We know that Faye has placed 19 pens and 27 colored pens in each of the 19 rows she created. Therefore, we can calculate how many pens Faye has used as follows:
Pens used = Number of rows x Number of pens per row
= 19 x 4
= 76 pens
So, Faye has used 76 pens to create her artwork."
Response:  We know that Faye has placed 7 rows of pens and each row contains 36 pens. Therefore, the total number of pens is 7 x 36 = 252 pens. Now, we are asked how many colors of paint she has used. Since each pen can hold either black or blue ink, there are two possible colors for each pen. So, the total number of colors of paint used by Faye is 2 x 252 = 504 colors of paint.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed 11 rows of pens and colored pencils. In each row, she has 31 pens and 27 colored pencils. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pens as follows: Total number of pens = Number of rows x Number of pens per row = 11 x 31 = 331 pens. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of colored pencils as follows: Total number of colored pencils = Number of rows x Number of colored pencils per row = 11 x 27 = 307 colored pencils. So, in total, Faye has 331 pens and 307 colored pencils.
Response:  If Faye has placed 30 pennies in rows with 5 pennies in each row, then she could have made $30 / 5 = 6 rows of pennies. Therefore, Faye could have made 6 rows of pennies.
Response:  If Faye placed six pens in each row, then she would have placed a total of 6 x 2 = 12 pens.
Response:  We know that Faye had 35 packets of pens with 4 pens in each packet. Therefore, she had a total of 35 x 4 = 140 pens. Since she wanted to arrange them in rows, we can assume that she arranged all 140 pens in rows. So, the number of rows she could make is 140 / 2 = 70 rows.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packets of pens with each packet containing 6 pens. So, in total, she has 31 x 6 = 186 pens. Since she placed them in rows with 19 pens in each row, we can calculate the number of rows as follows: Number of rows = Total number of pens / Number of pens in each row = 186 / 19 = 10 rows. Therefore, Faye has 10 rows of pens, which means she has 10 x 19 = 190 pens in total.
"Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pens and markers in 30 rows with 71 coloring tools (pens or markers) each row. Therefore, we have:
Number of pens = Total number of coloring tools / Number of rows
= 71 x 30 = 2130 pens
So, Faye has 2130 pens in total."
Response:  We know that Faye has placed 6 färgkritor in each of the 16 rows she created. Therefore, the total number of färgkritor is:  6 x 16 = 96 färgkritor.  Now, we need to calculate how many different colors (färg) Faye used. Since there are 21 pens in each row and each pen can hold one color, the total number of colors used by Faye is:  21 x 16 = 320 colors. So, the final answer is:  There are 320 different colors (färg) used by Faye.
Response:  We know that there are 98 students in total and 7 school buses. Since each bus can carry a certain number of passengers, we need to find out how many passengers each bus can hold.  The average capacity of a school bus is around 60-70 passengers. So, if all 7 buses are full, they can accommodate 420-560 passengers (7 x 60 = 420 or 7 x 70 = 560). Therefore, there are approximately 420-560 seats available for the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and 95 school buses with 118 seats each. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Capacity per school bus Total number of students = 84 x 118 = 9620 students So, there are approximately 9620 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 66 students, so we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4302 students in the school. Since there are six seats in each bus, we need to divide the number of students by six to find out how many buses we need: 4302 / 6 = 717 buses. Therefore, we need seven hundred and seventeen buses to take the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and 58 students in total. Since there are equal number of students in each classroom, we can assume that there will be an equal number of students per bus as well. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of students (58) by the number of students per bus (2). This gives us the number of buses required for the trip:  Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of students per bus = 58 / 2 = 29 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school and each classroom has the same number of students (120). So, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms to get the average number of students per classroom:  $ \text{Total number of students} = 120$ $\text{Classrooms} = 24$ $ \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of classrooms}} = \boxed{5}$ Therefore, there are approximately 5 students in each classroom.
Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total and 8 seats per bus. So, if 22 students do not want to go on the trip, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students each can be accommodated in one bus. To do this, divide 102 by 8 = 13. Therefore, we will need 13 buses for the entire group.
Response:  If there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students in total, then there are 9 classes per bus (since each bus can hold up to 99 students). So if 8 students do not want to go on the trip, then 94 students will go on the trip ( since 102 - 8 = 94). Therefore, 94 students will go on the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and 3 seats per bus (as stated in the problem). So, we can calculate how many students each bus can carry as follows: Number of students = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus = 111 students / 3 seats/bus = 37 students per bus Therefore, since there are 37 students per bus, we need 3 buses to take all the students on the field trip. Thus, the answer is 3 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 46 school buses and 92 students in total at the school. Since each bus can carry a certain number of passengers, we need to find out how many passengers each bus can hold.  To do this, we divide the total number of students (92) by the number of seats available per bus (which is given as 46). This gives us an average of 2 passengers per bus. Therefore, if all the buses are full, then there will be 46 x 2 = 92 passengers in total. So, the answer is 92.
Response:  If there are 9 boys and each boy gets 9 marbles from Haley, then the total number of marbles given away is 9 x 9 = 81 marbles. So, Haley had 81 marbles to start with.
Response:  If Haley has ten marbles and she gave five to each of five boys, then she gave a total of 5 x 5 = 25 marbles away. So, there are 10 - 25 = 7 marbles left with Haley.
Response:  If there are 4 boys and they love to play with balls, then each boy will get 1/4 of the total number of balls which is 6 (23 / 4). So, each boy gets 6 balls. Therefore, the number of balls left for Haley is 23 - 6 = 17.
Response:  If Haley has 26 kulor and there are 13 boys playing with her, then each boy will get how many kulor?  We can divide 26 by 13 to find out that each boy gets 2 kulor.  So, if 50 boys play with Haley, they will get a total of 50 x 2 = 100 kulor.
Response:  If Haley has 20 balls and there are two boys in her class who like to play catch with them, then we can assume that each boy will get an equal number of balls from Haley. So, if Haley gives out the same number of balls to both boys, then they will each receive 10 balls (since 20 / 2 = 10).
Response:  If Haley has 28 kulor and she gives two kulors to each of the boys, then how many boys did she give kulors to? We can use multiplication to solve this problem.  Number of boys = Total number of kulors / Number of kulors given to each boy  Number of boys = 28 / 2 = 14 boys. Therefore, Haley gave kulors to 14 boys.
Response:  We know that Frank read 14 pages per day and the book has 392 pages in total. To find out how many days it took him to finish reading the book, we can use the formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily page count. Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Number of days = 392 / 14 = 27 days So, it took Frank 27 days to finish reading his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 569 days and he read 22 pages per day. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days / Reading speed (pages/day) Now, we have to find out how many pages are in the book. Let's assume that the book has x pages. Substituting the value of x into the above equation, we get: x = Total number of days / Reading speed (pages/day) Solving for x, we get: x = 569 / 22 = 25 pages Therefore, there are 25 pages in Frank's favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank took six days to read his favorite book and that there are 612 pages in total. To find out how many pages he read each day, we can divide the number of pages by the number of days it took him to read them: 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day. So, Frank read 102 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to write his favorite book and it has 5 chapters. Since each chapter has an equal number of pages (555), we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 555 / 5 = 111 pages per chapter. Therefore, there are 111 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to write his book and there are 15 chapters in total. Therefore, we can calculate how many days he spent reading each chapter as follows: Number of days = Total number of days / Number of chapters So, the number of days Frank spent reading each chapter is: 660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days per chapter Now, let's find out how many pages Frank read per day: Number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter So, the number of pages Frank read per day is: 44 days x 193 pages/chapter = 8,722 pages per day
Response:  If Frank took three days to read each book and each book had 249 pages, then he must have read a total of 747 pages in those three days (3 books x 249 pages/book = 747 pages). So, he read 747 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank read some books and each book had 66 pages. It took him 12 days to read every book. So, if he reads all the books, it will take him 492 days (12 x 40 = 480). Therefore, he has read 480 books.
Response:  If it took him 16 days to read his favorite book and the book has 112 pages, then he must have read at a rate of pages per day. Therefore, he read pages per day.
"Response:  If Frank read 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, then he will finish reading the book in:

$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Number of pages read per day}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{576}{\8} = 72\text{ days} $$
Therefore, it took Frank 72 days to finish reading his favorite book."
"Response:  We know that Frank took 30 days to read his favorite book and that each chapter had 450 pages (or 450 sidor in Swedish). So, if he spent 30 days reading, he must have read x number of chapters per day. Since there are 41 chapters in total, we can set up the equation:
x = Total number of chapters / Number of days taken to read them
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
x = 41 / 30
x = 136 pages/day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 136 pages per day during the 30 days it took him to finish his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read through his favorite book and it had three chapters with 594 pages each. So, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows: Total pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter Total pages = 3 x 594 = 1782 pages Now, we are asked how many days it took Frank to write the book. According to the question, it took him 607 days to finish writing the book. Therefore, we can calculate the average time taken to write one page as follows: Average time to write one page = Total pages / Time taken to write the book Average time to write one page = 1782 pages / 607 days = 2.95 pages/day Based on this calculation, Frank wrote approximately 2.95 pages every day.
Response:  We know that Frank read through his favorite book and it had two chapters with 405 pages each. Therefore, he spent 664 days reading the book. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can divide the number of days by the total number of pages in the book: 664 days / 810 pages (2 x 405 pages) = approximately 0.8 chapter/day. So, Frank read approximately 0.8 chapters per day.
Response:  If we have a sex DVD-paket that can be purchased for $120, then each DVD in the package must cost at least $10 (since $120 / 12 = $10 per DVD). Therefore, each DVD in the package costs $10.
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then to buy 33 packages of DVDs would cost:
$81 x 33 = $2693
Therefore, the answer is $2693."
"Response:  If each DVD pack costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 on every package, then we can calculate how many packages you can buy with $93 as follows:

$93 / $107 = x
x = 8
So, you can buy 8 DVD packs with $93."
Response:  If each DVD pack costs $76 and there is a discount of $25 on each package, then we need to calculate how much you will pay for each package after applying the discount. So, the cost of each package = $76 - ($76 x 25%) = $76 - $19 = $57. Therefore, you must pay $57 for each package.
"Response:  If you have $104 and each DVD costs $26, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many DVDs can be bought with the given amount of money.
$104 / $26 = 4 DVDs

So, you can buy 4 DVD packages with your $104."
Response:  If one DVD costs $28, then two DVDs will cost twice that amount or $56. So each DVD costs half of that amount which is $28/2 = $14 per DVD.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in Philip's banana collection and they come in groups of size two. So, we need to find out how many groups of two bananas we can make from these 18 bananas. To do this, we will use division.  Division is a way of dividing a number into equal parts or groups. In this case, we want to divide 18 bananas into groups of two bananas each.  The result of our calculation is:  There are 9 groups of two bananas in Philip's banana collection.
Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and each group contains 187 bananas. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of bananas as follows: Total Number of Bananas = Number of Groups x Number of Bananas per Group Total Number of Bananas = 140 x 187 = 23,800 bananas So, Philip has 23,800 bananas in his collection.
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and 63 apricots in Philip's collection. If we divide the number of bananas into groups of 7, then each group will contain 29 bananas (203 / 7 = 29). Similarly, if we divide the number of apricots into groups of 95, then each group will contain 7 apricots (63 / 95 = 7). Therefore, each group of bananas contains 29 bananas, and each group of apricots contains 7 apricots.
Response:  We know that there are 356 apelsiner in Filip's collection and they are organized into 178 groups. Therefore, each group contains an average of 2 apesliners (356/178).
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. Therefore, we can write this as: $196$ groups.  Now, we need to find out how many bananas are in each group. From the problem statement, we know that there are $392$ bananas in total in Philip's collection. So, dividing the number of bananas by the number of groups gives us the number of bananas in each group: $\boxed{392 / 196 = 19}$.  Therefore, each group contains $19$ bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in each group and we want to find out how many groups of bananas there are in total. So, if there are 180 bananas in Philip's collection, then there must be 180 / 18 = 10 groups of bananas. Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection.
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are divided into two groups. Since we have already counted 87 apples, let's assume that each group of bananas has 103 bananas (290 - 87 = 103). Therefore, each group of bananas contains 103 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 384 apricots and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. Since bananas are organized into 345 groups, we can say that each group contains bananas. Similarly, since apricots are organized into 16 groups, each group contains apricots. Therefore, the size of each group of apricots is 16/345 = 0.047.
Response:  If Brenda's mom made 38 kakors and each of them had 19 kakors inside, then we need to multiply the number of kakors her mother made (38) with the number of kakors in each one (19). So, the total number of kakors Brenda's mom made is: 38 x 19 = 702 kakors!
"Response:  If Brenda's mom made cookies for 14 people and each person had 30 cookies, then...

Answer: 420 (kakors)"
Response:  If Brenda's mom made cookies for five people and she made 22 cookies but had to throw away 17 of them, then we can calculate how many cookies each person got as follows: Number of cookies per person = Total number of cookies / Number of people  In this case, the total number of cookies is 22 (Brenda's mom made 22 cookies), and the number of people is 5 (the mother made cookies for five people). So, the number of cookies per person would be: Number of cookies per person = 22 / 5 = 4.4 Cookies per person Since there are not whole numbers of cookies per person, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 4 cookies per person. Therefore, each person received 4 cookies in total.
Response:  If Brenda's mom made 10 kakors and only 9 guests came, then she must have had 1 kakor left over. So, if 18 kakors were prepared in total, each guest would get 2 kakors (since there are 18 kakors divided by 9 guests). Therefore, each guest got 2 kakors.
Response:  If Brenda's mom made 14 cookies for two guests, then each guest received how many cookies?  We can divide 14 by 2 to find out that each guest got 7 cookies. So, in total, there were 7 + 7 = 14 cookies.
Response:  If Brenda's mom made 10 kakors and each guest received two kakors, then there were 20 guests in total (10 kakors x 2 per guest).
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of candy and divides them equally among two bags, then each bag will contain 42/2 = 21 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Frank has $X$ pieces of candy and he divides them into $Y$ bags with $Z$ pieces each, then we can write an equation based on this information: $\text{Total number of candies} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Number of pieces in each bag}$.  In this case, we are given that Frank has $26$ bags and each bag contains $33$ pieces of candy, so we can plug these values into our equation to get: $\text{Total number of candies} = 26 \times 33 = 840$. Therefore, Frank has $840$ pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that Frank had initially 33 pieces of candy and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 remaining pieces of candy. To divide these into equal parts in bags with 9 pieces each, we need to make 9 / 1 = 9 bags. Therefore, Frank would have 9 bags of candy.
Response:  If Frank has 22 godis stycken and wants to put them in separate packages of equal size, then he will need at least 22 / 5 = 4.4 packages. Since we can't have a fraction of a package, let's round up to 5 packages. So, Frank would have 5 packages with 4.4 godis stycken each, for a total of 22 godis stycken.
Response:  If Frank has 16 goodies in total and he wants to put them in two bags, then each bag will contain how many goodies?  We can divide 16 by 2 to find out that each bag contains 8 goodies. So, there are 8 goodies in each of the two bags.
Response:  If Shirley sold 25 lådor trefoil, then she needs to deliver 25 x 14 = 350 lådor with trefoil.
Response:  If Shirley sold ten boxes of triangular shapes and needs to deliver 5 boxes, then there are 10 / 5 = 2 boxes in each bag that she must deliver. Therefore, there are 2 bags.
"Response:  We know that there were 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda in total. So we can write this as an equation:

Regular soda = 67
Diet soda = 9

Now let's subtract the number of diet sodas from the number of regular sodas to find out how many more regular sodas there are:

Number of regular sodas - Number of diet sodas = 67 - 9 = 58

So, there are 58 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
"Response:  We know that there were 22 bottles of regular cola and 61 bottles of diet cola in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Regular Cola = 22
Diet Cola = 61 - 22 = 39
Now, we want to find out how many more diet colas they had than regular colas. To do this, we subtract the number of regular colas from the number of diet colas:
More Diet Cola = 39 - 22 = 17
So, there were 17 more bottles of diet cola than regular cola in the store."
Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles of regular soda and 8 bottles of diet soda. So, in total, we have: 30 + 8 = 38 bottles.  Therefore, they had 38 bottles of soda in total.
"Response:  We know that there were 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Regular Soda = Total - Diet Soda

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:
Regular Soda = 79 - 53 = 26

Therefore, there are 26 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
Response:  We know that there were 83 bottles of regular soda and 54 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can calculate the number of bottles of regular soda as follows: Number of bottles of regular soda = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles of diet soda = 83 - 54 = 29 bottles Therefore, there are 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that out of total 17 bottles, 9 are regular soda and the remaining 8 are diet soda. So, the number of diet soda bottles is 8/17 = 0.47 (approximately). Therefore, they had approximately 4-5 diet soda bottles.
Response:  We know that there were 60 bottles of regular soda and 19 bottles of diet soda in the store. To find out how many more regular soda they had than diet soda, we can divide the number of regular soda bottles by the number of diet soda bottles: 60 / 19 = 3.10 (approximately). So, the store had approximately 3 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that there were 72 bottles of regular soda and 32 bottles of diet soda. Therefore, the total number of bottles is 72 + 32 = 104 bottles. Now we need to find out how many more bottles than apples they had. The number of apples was 78. So, the difference between the number of bottles and the number of apples is 104 - 78 = 26 bottles more than apples.
Response:  We know that there were 36 apples in total and 80 bottles of regular soda. So, we can say that the number of bottles of regular soda is equal to 36 / 80 = 0.45 or 45%. Now, let's find out how many more bottles of soda than apples they had. To do this, we need to subtract the percentage of apples from 100%, which is: 100% - (45%) = 55%. Therefore, the butik had 55% more bottles of soda than apples.
Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles in total and 28 of them were regular soda bottles. So, we can say that the number of diet soda bottles is equal to 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, they had 2 diet soda bottles.
Response:  We know that there were 4 bottles of diet soda and 79 - 4 = 75 bottles of regular soda in total. So, to find out how many bottles of regular soda the store had, we can divide the number of bottles of regular soda by the total number of bottles: 75 / 100 = 3/4 or 75%. Therefore, the store had 75% more regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that there were 57 bottles of regular soda and 26 bottles of diet soda. So, in total, they had 57 + 26 = 83 bottles of soda. Therefore, the answer is 83.
"Response:  We know that there were 81 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write this as an equation:

Total number of bottles = Number of regular soda bottles + Number of diet soda bottles

Now, we are asked to find out how many more bottles of regular soda they had than diet soda. To do this, we need to subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the total number of bottles:

Number of regular soda bottles - Number of diet soda bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of diet soda bottles

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

81 - 60 = 21

So, there were 21 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
Response:  We know that there are 49 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write this as an equation: 49 + 40 = x, where x is the number of bottles of both types combined. Now, we also know that there are 6 bottles of light soda. Therefore, we can add this to our previous equation: 49 + 40 + 6 = x. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 135. So, there are 135 bottles of all three types of soda together.
"Response:  If there were 295 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and after having a good meal they went to see it, then the difference between the number of visitors that day and the previous day is equal to the number of visitors that day minus the number of visitors the previous day. So we can write an equation as follows:

Number of visitors today - Number of visitors yesterday = Number of visitors today + Number of visitors yesterday

We are given that there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day, so let's substitute this value into our equation:

317 - x = 295 + x

Where x is the number of visitors the previous day. Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

So there were 22 more visitors to Buckingham Palace that day than the previous day."
"Response:  If there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 246 visitors that day, then the total number of visitors during those 25 days would be:

Total visitors = Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors today
= 703 + 246
= 949

Therefore, during those 25 days, approximately 949 people visited Buckingham Palace."
Response:  If there were 666 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and after having a good meal they went to see it, then we can assume that the number of visitors increased by 333 (666 - 333 = 333). So, there were 333 more visitors to Buckingham Palace than the previous day.
"Response:  If 132 visitors came to Buckingham Palace after a good meal, and there have been 327 days since then, we can calculate how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace in total during that time as follows:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors per day x Total number of days
= 132 x 327
= 42,540

Therefore, according to the question, 42,540 people visited Buckingham Palace during the last 327 days."
"Response:  We know that 45 people visited Buckingham Palace the day before and we want to find out how many visitors came to the palace during the last 85 days. So, if 829 people visited the palace in total during those 85 days, then the number of visitors per day is:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 829 / 85
= 10
Therefore, 10 people visited Buckingham Palace each day during the last 85 days."
Response:  We know that there were 71 paintings in Buckingham Palace and 557 visitors came to see it during the day after their meal. To find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace over 57 days, we need to multiply the number of visitors per day by 57. So, if there were 188 visitors the previous day, then there would be 10,693 visitors (188 x 57) over 57 days.
"Response:  If there were 600 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and after having a good meal they went to see it, then the difference between the number of visitors that day and the previous day is equal to the number of visitors that day minus the number of visitors the previous day. So we can write an equation as follows:

Let X be the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before (i.e., 600)
Then the number of visitors the next day = X + Y (where Y is the number of additional visitors)
So, we are given that there were 39 paintings in Buckingham Palace, and 661 visitors came to see it that day. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
X + Y = 661...(1)
Now, we know that there were 600 visitors the day before, so we can substitute this value into equation (1):
X + Y = 661
Subtracting X from both sides gives us:
Y = 61
Therefore, there were 61 more visitors to Buckingham Palace the day after than the day before."
"Response:  We know that there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question. If we subtract this number from the total number of visitors for the previous two days, we get:

Day before (419 - 92) = 327
Day before that (103 - 92) = 11

So, in total, 327 people visited Buckingham Palace the day before, 11 people visited the day before that, and 92 people visited on the day in question."
Response:  If there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question and 471 visitors the day before that, then there must have been an increase of 41 visitors from the previous day (512 - 471 = 41). Similarly, if there were 808 visitors the day before that, then there was an increase of 367 visitors from the previous day (808 - 471 = 336). Therefore, during the last 89 days, a total of 336 + 41 = 377 people visited Buckingham Palace.
"Response:  If there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and 191 visitors the day before, then the increase in visitors from the previous day is:

705 - 191 = 514

If we add this number to the total number of visitors the day before (457), we get:

457 + 514 = 971

So, there were 971 more visitors to Buckingham Palace that day than there were during the previous 245 days."
"Response:  We know that the total weight of feathers is 628 grams and Hans needs 159 grams of wax to stick them together. So, we can calculate how much wax he has already used as follows:

Total weight of feathers = 628 grams
Amount of wax needed for sticking = 159 grams

Therefore, the amount of wax Hans has left is:

Remaining wax = Total weight of feathers - Amount of wax needed for sticking
= 628 grams - 159 grams
= 469 grams

So, Hans has 469 grams of wax remaining."
Response:  We know that he needs 49 grams of paint to color them and we also know that each feather requires 288 grams of wax. So if he has already used 260 grams of wax for the feathers, then how much wax does he have left? To find out, divide the total amount of wax needed (288 grams) by the number of feathers (5). This gives us 57 grams of wax per feather. Since he has already used 260 grams of wax, he has 310 grams of wax left (57 grams x 5 = 310 grams). Therefore, he has 310 grams of wax remaining.
Response:  We know that he needs 57 grams of paint to color the feathers and we also know that he has already used 22 grams of wax to glue them together. So, if he needs 353 grams of wax in total, then how much wax does he have left to use? To find out, we can subtract the amount of wax he has already used (22 grams) from the total amount of wax needed (353 grams): 353 - 22 = 331 grams. Therefore, he has 331 grams of wax left to use.
"Response:  If he has 20 grams of wax now and needs 166 grams to glue all the feathers together, then we can calculate how much more wax he needs as follows:

Total amount of wax needed = Number of grams of wax per feather x Total number of feathers
= 166 grams / 10 (number of feathers in one bird)
= 16.6 grams per feather

So, if he wants to glue all the feathers together, he will need an additional 16.6 grams of wax for each feather, which means he needs a total of:

Additional amount of wax needed = Total number of feathers x Additional amount of wax per feather
= 10 feathers x 16.6 grams/feather
= 166 grams

Therefore, he needs an additional 166 grams of wax to complete the task."
"Response:  If he has 557 grams of wax and needs only 17 grams in total to glue all the feathers together, then we can calculate how much each feather will need as follows:

Total amount of wax needed = Total weight of feathers / Amount of wax needed per feather
= 557 g / 0.17 g/feather
= 3268 feathers

Therefore, the fjädrar (feathers) will need approximately 3268 grams of wax to be glued together using the remaining 17 grams of wax."
"Response:  We know that he has 11 grams of wax already and needs 492 grams in total to glue all the feathers together. So we can calculate how many more grams of wax he needs as follows:

Total amount of wax needed = Total weight of feathers x Amount of wax per feather
= 492 grams x 38 feathers (since there are 38 feathers in total)
= 17652 grams

Now, let's divide the total amount of wax needed by the amount of wax he currently has:

Number of additional grams of wax needed = Total amount of wax needed - Current amount of wax
= 17652 grams - 11 grams
= 17641 grams

Therefore, Hans needs an additional 17641 grams of wax to complete his task."
"Response:  If there are 94 pickers and they fill 90 baskets of grapes in 6 days, we can calculate how many baskets each picker fills per day as follows:

Number of pickers = 94
Total number of baskets filled = 90
Time taken to fill the baskets = 6 days

Now, let's divide the total number of baskets filled by the number of pickers and the time taken to fill them:

Number of baskets filled per day = Total number of baskets filled / Number of pickers x Time taken to fill the baskets
= 90 / 94 x 6
= 5.37 baskets per day (round it off to 5 baskets per day)

Therefore, Han would need to check 5 baskets of grapes per day to determine his favorite."
Response:  If there are 266 pickers and they fill 90 barrels in five days, then each picker fills how many barrels per day?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of pickers x number of barrels filled per day = Total amount of work done per day. So, we have: 266 pickers x 18 barrels (since 90 / 5 = 18) = 4732 units of work done per day.
Response:  We know that in total there are 294 pickers who fill 244 tuns of grapes per day and 47 tuns of strawberries per day. This means they collectively fill 331 tuns (244 + 47) of fruit per day. Since we have 146 days until the end of the season, we can calculate how many tuns of fruit will be collected during this time as follows: Number of tuns = Total number of days x Average amount of fruit collected per day = 146 days x 331 tuns/day = 45,860 tuns Now, to convert this quantity into fat, we need to divide it by 4, since each tun contains approximately 100 kg (fat). Therefore, the total number of fat of grapes and strawberries collected during the season is: Number of fat = Amount of fruit collected / 4 = 45,860 tuns / 4 = 11,465 fat So, the answer to the question is 11,465 fat.
"Response:  We know that there are 221 tunnors of drupes filled every day and we want to find out how many fat drupes would be filled in 77 days. To do this, we need to convert the number of tunnors into weight units (fat). One tunnor is equal to 10 kg or 10000 grams. So, the total weight of drupes filled everyday is:

Weight of drupes = Number of tunnors x Weight of one tunnor
= 221 tunnors x 10 kg/tunnor
= 2210 kg/day

Now, we want to find out how much weight of drupes would be filled in 77 days. To do this, we divide the total weight of drupes filled every day by the number of days:

Weight of drupes after 77 days = Total weight of drupes / Number of days
= 2210 kg/day x 77 days
= 16495 kg

So, if 221 tunnors of drupes are filled every day, then approximately 16495 kilograms of drupes would be filled in 77 days."
"Response:  If Han spars his favorite through checking wine barrels after 57 stops and he heard from 252 pickers that they fill 108 barrels of grapes per day, then we can calculate how many barrels of grapes would be filled in 58 days as follows:

Number of days = 58
Number of barrels filled per day = 108
Therefore, the total number of barrels of grapes filled = Number of days x Number of barrels filled per day = 58 x 108 = 6344 barrels of grapes."
Response:  If it takes 36 pickers 8 days to fill 360 liters of grapes (which is equivalent to 1 day for 40 liters), then it will take 40 days for 360 liters of grapes to be filled. Therefore, it will take 50 days to fill 240 liters of grapes.
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for saltwater fish and each aquarium has the same number of fish. So, we can write an equation:  Number of fish in one aquarium = Total number of fish / Number of aquariums. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of fish in one aquarium = 52 / 26 = 2.  Therefore, each aquarium has 2 saltwater fish.
Response:  We know that Han had 40 saltwater fish in total and each aquarium has two fish. So we can write an equation as follows: Total number of aquariums = Number of fish / Number of fish per aquarium. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, Han had 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 56 aquariums for saltwater and 10 for freshwater. Since each aquarium contains 39 fish, we can calculate the total number of fish in all his aquariums as follows: Saltwater aquariums: 56 x 39 = 2248 Freshwater aquariums: 10 x 39 = 390 Total number of fish: 2248 + 390 = 2638 Therefore, Tyler has 2638 fish in all his aquariums.
Response:  We know that Han had 74 aquariums for freshwater and 22 for saltwater. Since each aquarium has 46 fish in it, we can calculate the total number of fish as follows: Freshwater fish = 74 x 46 = 3380 Saltwater fish = 22 x 46 = 952 Therefore, Tyler has 3380 + 952 = 4332 fish in his aquariums.
Response:  We know that Han has 15 aquariums for saltwater and 62 aquariums for freshwater. Since each aquarium contains 19 fish, we can calculate the total number of fish as follows: Saltwater aquariums: 15 x 19 = 285 Freshwater aquariums: 62 x 19 = 1138 Total number of fish = 285 + 1138 = 1423 Therefore, Han has 1423 fish in total.
Response:  If we buy 13 white T-shirts in a package, then Mom has bought 39 - 13 = 26 packages of white T-shirts.
"Response:  If Mamma buys 66 white T-shirts and each package contains 3 white T-shirts, then she will have:

66 / 3 = 22 packages of T-shirts
Therefore, Mamma should have 22 packages of T-shirts."
Response:  If Mama buys 28 packages that contain 56 white T-shirts altogether, then each package contains how many white T-shirts? We can solve this problem using division. The number of white T-shirts per package is equal to the total number of white T-shirts divided by the number of packages purchased. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of white T-shirts per package = Total number of white T-shirts / Number of packages purchased Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into the equation: Number of white T-shirts per package = 56 / 28 = 2 Therefore, each package contains 2 white T-shirts.
"Response:  If Mama buys 57 packets of white T-shirts and 34 pairs of pants, then she will have in total:

57 x 53 = 2913 white T-shirts

Therefore, Mama will have 2913 white T-shirts if she buys 57 packets of them."
"Response:  If Mamma buys 51 white T-shirts and each package contains three T-shirts, then...

Mamma has bought 51 / 3 = 17 packages of T-shirts."
Response:  If Mamma buys 70 white T-shirts in total and she buys them in packages of 14 packets, then each package contains how many white T-shirts? We can solve this problem using division. The number of white T-shirts per packet is 70 / 14 = 5. So each package contains 5 white T-shirts.
Response:  If we have 4 bags with an equal number of cookies and total 36 cookies, then each bag must contain 9 cookies (36 / 4 = 9).
Response:  If you have 33 kakor and each package has 11 kakors, then... (1) The total number of kakos is 33 x 11 = 353. Therefore, you would have 353 packages with kakor.
Response:  If each package has 41 kakors and you have 53 packages with kakors, then the total number of kakors is:  Total = Number of packages x Number of kakors per package = 53 x 41 = 2193 kakors.
Response:  If you have 14 cookies in total and 7 packages with an equal number of cookies per package, then each package contains 14/7 = 2 cookies. Therefore, there are 7 packages x 2 cookies per package = 14 cookies in total.
Response:  We know that each package has three cookies and we have 21 total cookies. So, to find out how many packages of cookies we have, we can divide the number of cookies by the number of cookies in each package:  Number of packages = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per package = 21 / 3 = 7 packages. Therefore, you have 7 packages of cookies.
Response:  We have 26 bags with an equal number of cookies in each bag (26 x 26 = 676). If we add 15 pieces of candy to that total, we get 676 + 15 = 691. So, you have 691 bags filled with cookies.
Response:  We have 14 pails with equal number of cookies and we want to know how many pails are needed for 28 cookies + 86 candies = total amount of sweets.  So, if we divide the total amount of sweets (28+86) by the number of cookies in each pail (14), we get the number of pails required = Total amount of sweets / Number of cookies per pail = 28/14 = 2 pails. Therefore, you would need 2 pails to store all the sweets.
Response:  If en breevbarre gives five spam emails to each quarter and sends 25 emails to each house in a quarter, then there are 5/4 = 1.25 houses per quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in a kvarter, there are 1.25 x 4 = 5 houses in a kvarter. Therefore, there are 5 houses in a kvarter.
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each quarter and he has to send 9 letters to every house, then he will have to send 180 letters (20 x 9 = 180) in total.
Response:  If there are six houses in a quarter and each house needs to receive 24 pieces of junk mail, then we need to divide 6 (the number of houses) by 24 (the number of pieces of junk mail per house). So, the answer is 30 (6/24 = 30). Therefore, the postman will give 30 pieces of junk mail to each house in that quarter.
"Response:  If en breevbarare sends 14 spam emails to each house in a quarter, and the messenger must give two spam emails to every quarter, then we can calculate how many houses there are in a quarter as follows:

Let X be the number of spam emails sent by the messenger to each house in a quarter. Since the messenger must send two spam emails to every quarter, the total number of spam emails sent by the messenger is twice X. Therefore, the number of houses in a quarter is half the number of spam emails sent by the messenger, which is equal to $2X$.

Now, we know that the messenger sends 14 spam emails to each house in a quarter, so the number of houses in a quarter is:

$2X = 14 \times 2 = 28$

Therefore, there are 28 houses in a quarter."
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each quarter and the mail carrier has to deliver 32 pieces of junk mail to each house, then the total number of junk mail delivered per quarter is:

20 x 32 = 640 pieces of junk mail

So, the mail carrier will have to deliver 640 pieces of junk mail to each quarter."
Response:  We have to send 30 letters in total and there are 78 quarters. So we need to divide 30 by 78 which gives us approximately 0.4 letters per quarter. Since each quarter has 19 houses, we can divide 0.4 letters per quarter by 19 houses per quarter which gives us approximately 0.02 letters per house. Therefore, the breeze messenger will give approximately 0.02 letters per house.
Response:  If there are 55 quarters and each quarter has 8 letters to send, then we need to find out how many letters the messenger needs to send in total.  We know that there are 32 letters sent per house, so if there are x houses in each quarter, then the number of letters sent to each quarter is 32x. Therefore, the total number of letters sent is equal to the sum of the number of letters sent to each quarter, which is 55 \* 32 = 1760 letters.  So, there are 1760 houses in each quarter.
Response:  If there are 12 houses in each quarter and the messenger has to send four spam messages to every house, then he will have to send 4 x 12 = 48 spam messages per quarter. Since there are 81 quarters in total, the messenger will have to send 48 x 81 = 3696 spam messages in total.
Response:  If there are 17 houses in each quarter and the messenger has to send four spam messages to each house, then he will have to send 17 x 4 = 68 spam messages in total.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 bullets. If she divides them into groups of four, then each group will contain 4/5 = 8 eggs or bullets. Since there are 10 eggs / 8 eggs per group = 1.25 groups, we can create 1 + 2 = 3 groups. Therefore, Rebecca will divide the bullets into three groups.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 kulor and 15 eggs. To divide them into groups of five, we need to find out how many times 10 goes into 75 (the total number of eggs).  So, we can write: 10 / 75 = x Where x is the number of groups we want to create.  Now, we solve for x: 10 / 75 = x  x = 2 Therefore, Rebecca will be able to create 2 groups of 5 eggs each using her 10 kulor.
Response:  If Rebecca has to divide an egg collection into groups of eleven eggs each, then she will have 11 x 2 = 22 eggs in total. Therefore, Rebecca has 22 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has eight eggs and six marbles. She wants to divide them into four groups. To do this, we need to find out how many eggs each group will have based on the number of marbles she has. If she divides the eggs equally among the groups, then each group will get two eggs (since there are six marbles). So, Group 1 will have 2 eggs, Group 2 will have 2 eggs, Group 3 will have 2 eggs, and Group 4 will also have 2 eggs. Therefore, the answer is 8 eggs divided equally among four groups = 2 eggs per group.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 kulors and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 15 eggs by 3 groups.  So if we divide 15 by 3, we get 5. That means each group will have 5 eggs. Therefore, the answer is 5 eggs per group.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of six each. So we need to find out how many groups we can make with 18 eggs.

We have 18 eggs, and we want to divide them into groups of 6 eggs each. To do this, we can use division. Division is when you divide a number by another number to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 18 by 6 to see how many groups we can make.

So, if we divide 18 by 6, we get 3. This means that Rebecca can create 3 groups of 6 eggs each. Therefore, there will be 3 groups."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. If she divides them equally among groups of three, then each group will have 31 bananas and 3 eggs. Therefore, there will be 31 groups. Similarly, if she divides her 27 marbles equally among groups of three, then each group will have 9 marbles. So, there will be 9 additional groups. In total, therefore, there will be 40 groups (31 + 9).
Response:  If Rebecca has 20 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of 5, then she will have 4 groups (20 / 5 = 4). So, she has 4 groups of eggs. Now, let's count how many kulors she has: She has 6 kulors. Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than kulors. The difference between the number of eggs and kulors is 16 - 6 = 10. So, Rebecca has 10 more eggs than kulors.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has five kulors and twelve eggs. If she divides them into groups of 20, then each group will contain 5 eggs (since 20 divided by 4 is 5). So, Rebecca will have 5 + 5 = 10 more eggs than kulors.
"Response:  If Luke scored 154 points in total and got 11 points per round, then he played x rounds. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Total score = Points per round x Number of rounds

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

154 = 11x

Now, dividing both sides by 11 gives us:

Number of rounds = 154 / 11

Therefore, Luke played 14 rounds."
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of trivia and got 46 points in each round, then he scored a total of:

177 x 46 = 8302 points

Therefore, Luke scored 8302 points in the game."
"Response:  If Luke got 84 points after playing two rounds of a trivia game and he received the same number of points each round, then we can calculate his average score per round as follows:

Average score = Total points / Number of rounds
= 84 / 2
= 42

Therefore, Luke scored an average of 42 points per round in the trivia game."
"Response:  If Luke got 146 points in each of the 157 rounds, then he scored a total of:

146 x 157 = 20,982 points

Therefore, Luke scored 20,982 points in the trivia game."
"Response:  If Luke got 3 points in each round and he got 78 points in total, then we can calculate how many rounds he played as follows:

Total points = Number of rounds x Points per round
= 78 points / 3 points per round
= 26 rounds

Therefore, Luke played 26 rounds in the trivia match."
Response:  If Emily had two pearls and she could make 32 necklaces, then each necklace required 16 pearls (32 / 2 = 16). So, to make one necklace, Emily needed 4 pearls (2 + 4 = 6).
Response:  If Emily made eleven halsband and each halsband takes 28 pearls, then she used a total of 11 x 28 = 308 pearls. So, Emily had 308 pearls in total.

Response:  If Emily could make 18 halsband and had 6 pearls, then she needed 3 pearls for each halsband (18 / 6 = 3).
Response:  If Emily made four halsbands and each halsband takes five pearls, then she used a total of 4 x 5 = 20 pearls. So, Emily had 20 pearls in total.
Response:  Since Emily has six pearls and each necklace requires three pearls, she can make 6 / 3 = 2 necklaces. Therefore, Emily can make two necklaces.
Response:  If Emily had five pearls and she could make 20 necklaces, then each necklace required 4 pearls (5 / 20 = 4). So, to make one halsband, Emily needed 4 pearls.
Response:  If Emily made 26 halsband and each halsband takes 2 pearls, then she used a total of 2 x 26 = 52 pearls. So, Emily had 52 pearls in total.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children from Lawrence County who go to camp during summer vacation and 668278 children who stay at home. To find out how many more children spent their summer vacation at camp than those who stayed at home, we need to subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the number of children who went to camp. So, the difference between these two numbers is: 819058 - 668278 = 150780. Therefore, 150780 more children spent their summer vacation at camp than those who stayed at home.
"Response:  We know that there are 202958 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 777622 children who stayed home. To find out how many more children stayed home than went to camp, we can subtract these two numbers:

202958 - 777622 = -574664

So, there were 574664 more children who stayed home than went to camp."
Response:  We know that there are 898051 farms in Lawrence county and during summer vacation, 629424 children go to camp and the remaining stay at home. So, we need to find out how many children stay at home. To do this, we can use division. The number of children who stay at home is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who go to camp. Therefore, the number of children who stay at home is: 898051 - 629424 = 268627. So, there are 268627 children who stay at home in Lawrence county during summer vacation.
Response:  We know that there are 313473 farms in Lawrence County and during summer vacation, 274865 of them stay at home while the remaining go to camp. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of barns going to camp = Total number of barns - Number of barns staying at home. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of barns going to camp = 313473 - 274865 = 38609. Therefore, 38609 barns go to camp during summer vacation.
Response:  If 907611 barn stay at home during summer vacation and 455682 go to camp, then we can calculate the number of barn in Lawrence County as follows: Number of barn in Lawrence County = Total number of barn x Percentage that stays at home During Summer Vacation = 907611 x (1 - 0.455682) = 438859 barn In Lawrence County, there are approximately 438,859 barn.
Response:  We know that 800059 children went to camp and the remaining stayed home. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of children who stayed at home = 828521 - 800059 = 284662. Therefore, there were 284662 children who stayed at home during summer vacation.
Response:  We know that out of 61619 children who stayed at home during summer vacation, 30% went to camp. So, we can assume that 30% of 91676 is equal to 27508. Therefore, 27508 children from Lawrence County went to camp.
Response:  We know that from Lawrence county, 34044 children go to camp and 134867 stay home. So, the total number of children from Lawrence county is 34044 + 134867 = 168911. Now we are told that there were additional 424944 children from other countries who participated in the camp. Therefore, the total number of children who went to the camp is 168911 + 424944 = 593855.
Response:  We know that 610769 children from Lawrence County go to camp and 590796 stay home. So, we have a total of 610769 + 590796 = 1201565 children in Lawrence County. Therefore, there are 1201565 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that in summer vacation, 644 997 children stayed at home and 89 3835 children went to camp. Furthermore, 78 children from other countries participated in the camp. So, we need to find out how many children there are in Lawrence County. To do this, we can use the information given in the question that 1% of the total number of children in Lawrence County attended the camp. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of children in Lawrence County as follows: Total number of children = (644 997 x 0.01) + (89 3835 x 100%) Total number of children = 6449 + 893835 Total number of children = 958234 children In summary, there are approximately 958,234 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  If Adam has three more apples than Jackie and Adam has nine apples in total, then Jackie must have 9 - 3 = 6 apples. So, Jackie has six apples.
Response:  Adam has ten apples and Jackie has two apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. So, the answer is: Adam has 10 - 2 = 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  If Adam has nine apples and Jackie has ten apples, then Jackie has one more apple than Adam. So, Jackie has 10 - 9 = 1 more apple than Adam. Therefore, Jackie has 10 - 9 = 1 more apple than Adam.
Response:  If Jackie has ten apples and Adam has eight apples, then Jackie has two more apples than Adam (10 - 8 = 2). So, Jackie has two more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have six apples together. If they have four more apples than they have together, then Adam has x apples, where x is the difference between the number of apples they have together (6) and the number of extra apples they have (4). So, x = 2. Therefore, Adam has 2 apples.
Response:  If Adam and Jackie have 7 apples together, then they must have had 7 + 9 = 16 apples in total. So, Adam has 16 - 7 = 9 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples. If they had fewer than 12 apples, then they would not be able to say that they have 9 more apples than they have together. So, we can conclude that Adam has at least 3 apples more than Jackie (since he has 12 - 9 = 3 more apples than Jackie). Therefore, Adam has 3 + 8 = 11 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Adam has four apples more than Jackie and together they have two apples. So, if we subtract the number of apples they have together from the total number of apples Jackie has (10), we get:  4 + 2 = 6  Therefore, Adam has 6 - 2 = 4 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie has x - 5 = 4 apples. Since Jackie has 89 apricots and 11 apples, we can write an equation: 89 + 11 = 5(x-5). Solving for x, we get x = 20. Therefore, Adam has 20 apples.

Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 90 chocolate cookies and today she baked 51 rose-shaped cookies and 484 chocolate cookies in total. So, the total number of chocolate kakors made by Helen is: 90 + 51 = 141.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Helen baked 527 chocolate cookies and 86 rose-flavored cookies yesterday. Then, she baked 86 rose-flavored cookies and 554 chocolate cookies this morning. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate cookies made by Helen.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Helen has baked a total of 85 + 403 = 488 rosinkakor so far. Therefore, the answer is 488.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Helen baked 19 chocolate cookies yesterday and 231 rose-flavored cookies this morning. So, she has baked a total of 450 chocolate cookies (19 + 231). On the other hand, she has baked only 237 chocolate kakors. Therefore, Helen had baked more chocolate kakors than rose-flavored kakors. The difference between these two numbers is 450 - 237 = 213. So, Helen had baked 213 more chocolate kakors than rose-flavored kakors.
Response:  Yesterday (yesterday), Helen baked 197 chocolate cookies and 46 rose cookies. Today (today), she baked 75 rose cookies and 66 chocolate cookies. So, yesterday, Helen baked more chocolate cookies than today. The difference between the number of chocolate cookies baked yesterday and today is:  197 - 75 = 122 chocolate cookies. Therefore, Helen baked 122 more chocolate cookies yesterday compared to today.
Response:  Yesterday (morning), Helen baked 280 rosinkakor and today she baked 359 more rosinkakors. So, in total, Helen baked 639 rosinkakor yesterday and today.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 81 DS games and her friends have 59 games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of games Katie has - Number of games her friends have = How many more games Katie has

Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get:

81 - 59 = 22

Therefore, Katie has 22 more DS games than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie had 91 DS games and her new friends had 88 games. So together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now we are asked how many games Katie's old friends have. We know that Katie's old friends had 53 games. Therefore, Katie's old friends have 53 games.  So in total, Katie's friends have 179 + 53 = 232 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, so together she has 103 games (84 + 19 = 103). Now we are told that her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so together they have 77 games (8 + 69 = 77). Therefore, the total number of new games that Katie and her friends have together is 103 + 77 = 180.
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So, in total they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 63 DS games and her friends have 57 games in total. So, to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has:

63 - 57 = 6

So, Katie has 6 more DS games than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Now we are told that Katie's friends have 34 new games. So, let's subtract the number of new games her friends have from the total number of games Katie has: 96 - 34 = 62. Therefore, Katie has 62 more games than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $19 dollars before he started working. Then, after he worked for the weekend, he earned $33 dollars (as stated in the problem). So, if we subtract his initial amount of money from what he gained through work, we get: $33 - $19 = $14. Therefore, Jason tjänade ($14) on TVATING BILAR.
"Response: 
Fred had $86 and Jason had $5, so together they have $91. Then, Fred earned $9 in tips from washing cars over the weekend, so now he has $90 + $9 = $99. Jason didn't work over the weekend, so he still has $5. Therefore, the total amount of money that Fred and Jason have together is $99 + $5 = $104."
Response:  We know that Fred had $19 at first and then he earned $21 in the weekend (since he has $40 now). So, he earned $21 more than he had initially. Therefore, Fred earned $21 + $19 = $40 in the weekend.
Response:  We know that Fred had $114 and Jason had $22 to start with. Then they earned money from washing cars over the weekend. Afterward, Fred has $21 left, and Jason has $78 left. So, Jason earned $56 in the weekend ($78 - $22).
"Response: 
Fred had $111 and Jason had $40 initially. Then, after TV-ing cars all weekend, Fred made $4 ($111 - $107 = $4). So now Fred has $115 ($111 + $4 = $115). Similarly, Jason earned $6 ($40 - $34 = $6) from delivering newspapers. Therefore, the total amount they earned from TV-ing cars is $10 ($4 + $6 = $10)."
"Response: 
Fred had $49 and Jason had $3. So together they had $52. 
Then, Fred earned $112 from washing cars over the weekend, so he now has $164 ($52 + $112). 
Jason delivered newspapers and earned $63, so he now has $127 ($3 + $63). Therefore, Jason earned $60 more than Fred for delivering newspapers ($127 - $107 = $60)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $31 and delivered newspapers to earn $14, so he now has $45.  Next, we know that Fred had $78 and earned $90 from washing cars over the weekend, so he now has $168. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned delivering newspapers is $45 + $168 = $213.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 at the beginning of the weekend. Then he delivered newspapers for $16 and earned an additional $16. Finally, he washed cars for $74, which means he earned a total of $104 during the weekend. So, Fred earned $104 in total over the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 initially and then he earned money from delivering newspapers for $111. So, his new amount of money is $47 + $111 = $158. Then, he spent some money on washing cars for $34. So, now his total amount of money is $158 - $34 = $124. Therefore, Fred has $124 now.
Response:  If Jessie weighed 71 kg to begin with and lost 20 kg through jogging every day, then she now weighs 51 kg (71 - 20 = 51).
Response:  Before she started jogging, Jessie weighed 27 kg (as stated in the question). Then, she lost 101 kg through jogging every day. So, her final weight after losing all those kilos is: 27 kg - 101 kg = -74 kg. Therefore, before she began jogging, Jessie weighed -74 kg.
Response:  Before she started jogging, Jessie weighed 192 kg (126 + 66).
"Response:  If Jessie lost 35 kg when she started jogging every day and weighed 69 kg before starting to jog, then she now weighs:

$69 - 35 = 34$ kg

Therefore, Jessie now weighs $34$ kg."
Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 114 kg (kilograms). Then she started jogging every day and lost weight at a rate of 50 kg during the first week and an additional 60 kg during the second week. So after two weeks, Jessie has lost a total of 110 kg = 50 + 60 kg. Therefore, her current weight is 110 kg - 114 kg = -3 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie weighed 9 kg initially and lost 62 kg in the first week. So, her weight after one week is: 9 kg + (62 kg / 7 days) = 9 kg + 8.71 kg/day = 17.71 kg/day. Similarly, she lost 140 kg in the second week, so her weight after two weeks is: 17.71 kg/day x 14 days = 235.74 kg. Therefore, Jessie's initial weight was 235.74 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie weighed 92 kg initially and lost 56 kg during the first week of jogging. So, after one week, she would have weighed 92 - 56 = 36 kg.
Response:  We know that there were 95 sharks in the zoo and 61 alligators. If 64 sharks hid themselves, then we can conclude that 61 - 64 = 3 sharks did not hide themselves. Therefore, 3 sharks did not hide themselves.
Response:  If there were initially 97 alligators and 40 of them hid themselves, then the number of alligators that did not hide themselves is:  97 - 40 = 57 alligators.
Response:  We know that there were originally 75 alligators in the park. If 82 ormar and 19 alligators hid themselves, then we have to subtract the number of ormar from the total number of alligators. So, the number of alligators hiding themselves is: 75 - 82 = -7 alligators. Therefore, 75 alligators did not hide themselves.
"Response:  We know that there were 79 total animals in the enclosure and we have already accounted for 24 of them being ormar (which means ""shark"" in Swedish). So, if we subtract 24 from 79, we get 55 remaining animals. Now, we are told that 51 of these remaining animals are alligators, which means that only 4 (55 - 51) are not either ormar or alligators. Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response:  Yesterday, he had 171 tomatoes and picked 134 of them, leaving him with 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes. Today, he picked 30 more tomatoes, so now he has 37 + 30 = 67 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  Yesterday, he had 160 tomatoes and he picked 56 of them, so now he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left in his garden. Today, he picked 41 more tomatoes, so now he has 104 + 41 = 145 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  Yesterday, he picked 154 tomatoes, so today he has 90 - 154 = 66 tomatoes left in his garden.
"Response:  If Bonde had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden before he picked 172 potatoes, then after picking those 172 potatoes, he has:
Tomatoes left = 175 - 172 = 3
Potatoes left = 77 - 172 = -94 (negative because we subtracted the number of potatoes he picked)
So, Bonde has 3 tomatoes and -94 potatoes left in his garden."
Response:  We know that Bonde had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden before he picked 53 tomatoes. So, after picking 53 tomatoes, he has (177 - 53) = 124 tomatoes left in his garden. Similarly, since he picked 12 potatoes earlier, he now has (12 + 0) = 12 potatoes left in his garden. Therefore, Bonde has 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left in his garden.
"Response:  We know that Bonde had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. If he picked 137 tomatoes, then we can calculate how many are left as follows:

Green tomatoes = 105 - (137 / 2) = 68
Red tomatoes = 71 - (137 / 2) = 49
So there are 68 green tomatoes and 49 red tomatoes left in Bonde's garden after picking 137 tomatoes."
Response:  If each träbräda needs two spikes to be fixed, then John will need four spikes for fixing one big plank of wood (since there are four sides of a wall). Therefore, John will need 4 x 2 = 8 spikes in total to fix all the big planks needed for the house walls.
Response:  For the big planks (13 pieces), he needs 13 x 17 = 229 spikes.  And for the smaller planks (8 pieces), he needs 8 x 8 = 64 spikes. So in total, John needs 229 + 64 = 293 spikes to fasten all the planks of the house walls.
Response:  If John used 11 spikes to break down big planks into smaller pieces for the house walls, and each plank requires 3 spikes to be fixed, then we can calculate how many planks John needs as follows: Number of planks = Total number of spikes / (Number of spikes per plank x Number of planks required) = 11 / (3 x?) = 11 / 9 = 4 planks Therefore, John needs 4 planks for the house walls.
Response:  For the large planks, he needs 15 spikes x 2 = 30 spikes.  For the small planks, he needs 5 spikes x 10 = 50 spikes. Therefore, John needs a total of 30 + 50 = 80 spikes for the house walls.
Response:  For each board, John needs two spikes to attach it to the wall. Since he will use 16 boards in total, he will need 8 spikes (2 x 16). Therefore, John needs 8 spikes for the house's walls.
Response:  If each board requires 74 spikes for attachment and there are 8 boards in total, then we need to calculate how many spikes are required for all 8 boards. So, the number of spikes needed = Total number of spikes / Number of boards = 74 x 8 = 580 spikes. Therefore, John needs 580 spikes to attach all 8 boards to the house walls.
Response:  For each large plank, we need 14 spikes to attach it to the wall. Since there are 12 large planks needed for the walls, we will need 168 spikes (12 x 14).  Similarly, for each small plank, we need 25 spikes to attach it to the wall. Since there are 17 small planks needed for the walls, we will need 425 spikes (17 x 25).  Therefore, in total, John needs 693 spikes (168 + 425) to attach all the planks to the house's walls.
Response:  We know that there are three gummies in each package and 42 total gummies. So if we divide 42 by 3, we get 14 packages of gummies. Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of gummies.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packets of gum and each packet contains 23 pieces of gum. So, in total, Robin has 43 x 23 = 1006 pieces of gum. However, we are also given that Robin has 8 additional pieces of gum. Therefore, the final number of pieces of gum that Robin has is 1006 + 8 = 1014 pieces of gum.
"Response:  We know that Robin has six extra pieces of gum. If each packet contains seven pieces of gum, then we can calculate how many packets Robin has as follows:

Number of packets = Total number of pieces of gum / Number of pieces per packet
= 7 x 6 (extra pieces) + 35 (total number of pieces in all bits of teeth)
= 42
Therefore, Robin has four packets of gum."
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of gum and each packet contains 4 pieces of gum. So, in total, Robin has 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packets of gummies and each packet contains 9 pieces of candy. So, in total, Robin has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Robin has 28 bags of gummies and each bag contains 6 pieces, then he has 28 x 6 = 168 pieces of gummies in total. Similarly, if he has 14 bags of candy and each bag contains 6 pieces, then he has 14 x 6 = 84 pieces of candy in total. So, Robin has a total of 168 + 84 = 252 pieces of gummies and candy.
Response:  If the machine can make three shirts in one minute and it made six total shirts, then we know that the machine worked for _________ minutes to produce all six shirts.  Therefore, the answer is 6/3 = 2 minutes.
Response:  If the machine worked for five minutes and can make four shirts in one minute, then it made... (4 x 5) = 20 shirts during those five minutes!
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts. If it can make 3 shirts per minute, then it worked for... (3 x 9) = 27 minutes yesterday. So, the machine worked for 27 minutes yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts, and today it made 3 more. So in total, the machine has made 16 shirts (13 + 3). If the machine can make 8 shirts per minute, then we need to calculate how many minutes it took for the machine to produce all those shirts. To do this, we divide the number of shirts produced by the number of shirts that can be produced per minute: 16 shirts / 8 shirts/minute = 20 minutes. Therefore, the machine functioned for 20 minutes in total.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts and today it made 8 shirts. So in total, the machine made 17 shirts (9 + 8). Now, we know that the machine can make two t-shirts per minute. Therefore, if we divide the number of shirts made yesterday and today by the time taken to make each shirt, we get:  Number of minutes = Total number of shirts / Time taken to make one shirt  In this case, the total number of shirts is 17, and the time taken to make one shirt is 2 minutes (as mentioned in the question). So, we can calculate the number of minutes as follows:  Minutes = 17 / 2 = 8.5 minutes  Therefore, the machine worked for approximately 8.5 minutes yesterday and 8.5 minutes today.
Response:  If the machine can make three shirts in one minute and there were four t-shirts yesterday and eight today, we need to calculate how many minutes the machine worked altogether. We know that the number of t-shirts made is equal to the time the machine worked. So, if the machine worked for x minutes, it will have made x t-shirts. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: 3 t-shirts/minute = x minutes (where x is the total number of minutes the machine worked). Solving for x, we get: x = 24 minutes (since there are 3 t-shirts per minute and 8 t-shirts today). Therefore, the machine worked for 24 minutes in total.
Response:  If the machine can make six shirts in one minute and worked for 12 minutes yesterday, it made 6 x 12 = 72 shirts yesterday.  And if it worked for 14 minutes today and can make six shirts per minute, it made 6 x 14 = 84 shirts today. So, the total number of shirts made by the machine is 72 + 84 = 156 shirts.
Response:  If the machine could make six shirts in one minute yesterday and it worked for five minutes today, then it made a total of 6 x 5 = 30 shirts today.
"Response:  If they earned $165 in total over five days, that means their daily earnings were:
$165 / 5 = $33 per day"
Response:  The ringkastning (or profit) from the carnival was $144 per day. They were at the carnival for 22 days. So, we can calculate their total earnings as follows: Total earnings = Profit per day x Number of days at the carnival Total earnings = $144/day x 22 days = $3,088 In other words, they earned $3,088 during their time at the carnival.
Response:  We know that they earned $420 in total during the carnival and $22 from playing games. So, we can write an equation: Total amount = Number of days x Amount per day. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Total amount = 30 days x $15 (amount per day) + 22 dollars (from playing games). Simplifying the equation gives us: $420 = 30 x $15 + $22. Solving for $15 per day, we get: $15 per day. Therefore, the ringkastning earned $15 per day.
Response:  The carnival made $382 in the first 44 days and $374 in the remaining 10 days. So, we can calculate the total amount earned as follows: Total earnings = First 44 days + Remaining 10 days = $382 + $374 = $756. Therefore, the carnival earned a total of $756 during the entire period.
Response:  The total amount earned during the first 20 days of the carnival is $120 + $66 = $186. Therefore, the daily earnings during the first 20 days are: $186 / 20 = $9.3 dollars per day.
Response:  We know that during the first 154 days of the carnival, they earned $325 and during the remaining 57 days, they earned $114. So, we can calculate the average daily earnings for the entire period as follows:  Average Daily Earnings = Total Earning / Number of Days  Therefore, the average daily earnings for the entire period is:  $325 + $114 = $439  Divide this amount by the total number of days (154 + 57) to get the average daily earnings for each day:  $439 / (154 + 57) = $6.80 per day
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packets of cookies and 4 packets of cakes, then she must have bought more than 4 packets of cookies. Therefore, the number of packets of cookies that Lucy bought is 6 (10 - 4).
"Response: 
Paket kakor = 4 x 20 = 80
Paket tårta = 22 x 5 = 110
Paket choklad = 16 x 10 = 160
Total number of packages of food = 80 + 110 + 160 = 350
Therefore, Lucy has bought 350 packets of food."
Response:  According to the question, Lucy bought 23 packets of cookies and some packages of cake. In total, she had 27 packets of food. So, if we subtract the number of packets of cookies from the total number of packets of food, we get the number of packets of cake that Lucy bought. Therefore, Lucy bought 4 packages of cake (27 - 23 = 4).
"Response:  We know that Lucy spent $20 on cakes and $30 on pastries. So far, she has spent a total of $50. Then we are told that she had $56 left after buying these items. Therefore, the number of packages of food she bought is:
$56 - $50 = $6
So, Lucy bought 6 packages of food."
Response:  At first, there were 12 people on the bus. Then, 4 more people got off at the next stop. So, now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people on the bus. Since each bus can have no more than 36 passengers, we know that there must be fewer than 36 people on the bus right now. Therefore, the correct answer is 16.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people on the bus. Then, 12 people got off and 3 people stepped onto the bus. So now, there are 8 + 12 - 3 = 17 people on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people on the bus. Then, 9 more people got on (13 - 4 = 9). So now, there are 9 + 4 = 13 people on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people on the train. Then, 8 of them got off at the next stop. So, now there are... (calculate)...9 people left on the train.
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents in the program and 676 people total. To find out how many students were in the program, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people. So, the answer is: 676 - 22 = 654 students.
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents and 744 teachers in the program. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of people involved as follows: Parents + Teachers = Total Number of People Involved 73 + 744 = 817 So, there were 817 people who were part of the program.
Response:  We know that there were 521 elevers in the program and 174 parents present. To find out how many more students were present compared to parents, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants (students + parents). So, the difference between the two numbers is: 521 - 174 = 347. Therefore, there were 347 more students than parents in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 students in the program. If we assume that all of them attended the program, then the total number of people present would be: 61 + 177 = 238.
"Response:  If om grottan is 919 feet deep and they have to climb 1307 feet, then we can calculate how far the end of the cave is as follows:

Depth of the cave = 919 feet
Height they need to climb = 1307 feet

To find out how far the end of the cave is, we need to subtract the height they need to climb from the depth of the cave:
End distance = Depth - Height
= 919 - 1307
= -488 feet

So, the end of the cave is approximately 488 feet away from where they started."
"Response:  We know that Grottan is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. If they travel at a speed of 17 km/h, how far are they from reaching the end of the cave?

We can start by calculating the distance traveled so far:
Distance = Speed x Time = 17 km/h x (Time in hours)

Since they have been traveling for 3 hours, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 17 km/h x 3 hours = 51 km

Now we need to calculate the remaining distance:
Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Distance Traveled = 1218 ft - 51 km = 1167 ft

Therefore, if they continue traveling at a speed of 17 km/h, it will take them approximately 1167 feet to reach the end of the cave."
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 762 feet and the height of the ceiling is 659 feet. To find out how far they have to go until they reach the end of the cave, we need to subtract the height from the depth. So, the distance they have to travel is: 762 - 659 = 133 feet. Therefore, it will take them 133 feet longer to reach the end of the cave than they are currently above ground level.
"Response: 
1. Paige had eight guldfish in the pond at the beginning. (8)
2. Strøm's cats loved to eat goldfish and left six goldfish behind. (6 - 8 = -2)
Therefore, there were -2 goldfish missing."
"Response:  If Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 seahorses in the pond initially, then she has 15 left now (as mentioned in the question). So, we can calculate the number of fish that disappeared as follows:
Number of fish that disappeared = Total initial fish - Number of fish remaining = 7 + 12 - 15 = -4
Therefore, 4 fish disappeared from the pond."
"Response:  We know that Paige had 16 guldfiskar in the pond and 71 sea creatures. The cats loved to eat them, so some of them disappeared. Now, Paige has only two left. So, we can calculate how many guldfiskar forsvann as follows:
Number of guldfiskar that forsvann = Total number of guldfiskar - Number of guldfiskar remaining
= 16 - 2
= 14
Therefore, 14 guldfiskar forsvann."
Response:  We know that Paige held 15 goldfish in the pond and that five of them were eaten by cats. So, we have 15 - 5 = 10 goldfish left in the pond.
Response:  The cook had two apples left after making some pies. So he used 2 + 2 = 4 apples in total.
Response:  After making some pies, he used 35 apples. So initially, he had 58 apples and after using 35 of them, we have 23 apples left.
Response:  We know that Kock had 40 apples and 54 peaches before making some pies. After making the pies, he had 39 apples left. So, we can say that Kock used x apples to make the pies, where x is the number of apples he used. Now, we are asked how many apples he used. Since he had 40 apples initially and used x of them, we can conclude that Kock used 40 - x apples to make the pies. Therefore, the answer is 40 - x.
Response:  If Adam has four shelves and each shelf can hold 11 action figures, then he will have a total of 4 x 11 = 44 action figures that he can place on his shelves. However, since there are only 40 skiffs in the room, this means that some of the action figures cannot fit on the shelves. Therefore, the maximum number of action figures that Adam could have placed on his shelves is 44 - 40 = 4.
Response:  If Adam can fit ten action figures on each shelf and his room has space for eight action figures, then we know that he needs _at least_ 10 / 8 = 1.25 shelves to hold all of his action figures. Since there are 8 shelves in total (as stated in the problem), this means that Adam would need at least 1.25 x 8 = 10 shelves to hold all of his action figures. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If Adam can fit eight action figures and ten boxes per shelf in his room, then he has four shelves (hyllor) available for storing things. Therefore, he could have a total of 8 x 10 = 80 items on all four shelves combined.
Response:  If there are 10 gardens and each garden has 544 pots, then the total number of pots is 10 x 544 = 5440.  Since each pot has 32 flowers, the total number of flowers in all the pots is 5440 x 32 = 176,800. Therefore, there are 176,800 flowers in all.
Response:  We know that there are 466 krukors and each kruka has 53 blommor and 181 pinnar. So, we can calculate the total number of blommor as follows: Total no. of blommor = Number of krukors x No. of blommor per kruka Total no. of blommor = 466 x 53 = 24,980 Blommor Now, let's calculate the total number of pinnar: Total no. of pinnar = Number of krukors x No. of pinnar per kruka Total no. of pinnar = 466 x 181 = 87,360 Pinnar Therefore, there are 24,980 blommor and 87,360 pinnar in all.
Response:  We know that there are 141 urns and each urn has 71 flowers and 91 stems. So, in total, we have:  Number of urns = 141 Flowers per urn = 71 Stems per urn = 91 Total number of flowers = 71 x 141 = 9651 Total number of stems = 91 x 141 = 12831 Therefore, there are 9651 flowers and 12831 stems in all.
Response: 1) Each kruka has 40 blommor in it. So there are 40/1 = 40 krukar with flowers. 2) Total number of blossoms is given as 400. Since each kruk has 40 blossoms, total number of krukars is 400 / 40 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 krukars in all.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steve's collection and 4276 gummies. To divide them into groups of 154, we need to find out how many groups can be formed using these numbers.  Firstly, let's calculate the total number of items available for division: Total Items = Number of Skittles + Number of Gummies = 4502 + 4276 = 8778 Now, let's divide this total number of items by 154 (the desired group size): Group Size = Total Items / 154 = 8778 / 154 = 57 Groups So, if Steve divides his Skittles and gummies into groups of 154 each, he will have 57 groups in total.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4950 Radiators. Since we want to divide them into groups of equal size, let's first find out how many groups we can make with all these items together. To do this, we need to divide both numbers by the number of items in each group (which is 1). So, we have: Number of groups = Total items / Items per group = 3941 / 1 = 3941 groups Now, since we want to divide the items equally among the groups, we will have: Group size = Total items / Number of groups = 3941 / 3941 = 1 item per group Therefore, each group contains one Skittle or one Radiator.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in Steve's collection and he has 517 rows and 90 bags. To find out how big each group is, we need to divide the total number of Skittles by the number of groups. So, if we divide 896 by 8, we get: Group size = 112 Skittles per group.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we can calculate the number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in total.
Response:  We know that the school has 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So, we can calculate the total number of students in the following way: Total Number of Students = Number of Classes x Number of Students per Class Total Number of Students = 304 x 75 Total Number of Students = 22,550 elevers.
