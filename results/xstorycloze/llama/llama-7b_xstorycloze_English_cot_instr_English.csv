Response:  The person had a stroke, which means they may have difficulty with cognitive tasks such as watching TV or concentrating on a screen for long periods of time. They also mention that it was hard to binge-watch 20 years worth of episodes, which suggests that they were able to complete their goal but found it challenging. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - the person did eventually watch all the episodes despite finding it difficult.
"Response:  The situation described in the passage is one where Bob, an actor who plays a popular character on film, is being asked by someone else (Jim) to repeat his character's catchphrase. This is causing Bob significant distress, as he feels miscast and disconnected from his own identity. Given this context, option A - ""Bob told the man to leave him alone"" - seems like the more likely outcome. Bob may feel uncomfortable or even angry at the request, and could therefore tell Jim to stop bothering him. Option B - ""Bob asked the man for tea"" - doesn't seem to fit the tone of the passage, as there is no indication that Bob is interested in engaging with Jim in any way beyond politely declining his request."
"Response: 
Lita wants to watch her favorite show, but her kids want her to sit down and watch it with them. This means that Lita will have to put aside her own plans or activities in order to spend time with her children. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Lita will fold the laundry while watching television with her kids."
Response:  The story states that Liv jumped when she heard a loud popping sound, which suggests that she was surprised or scared. Then, she realizes that the light bulb in her kitchen has burned out. This implies that she is in her kitchen at the time of the incident. Finally, the story mentions that she uses a footstool to reach the light fixture, but the stool wobbles underneath her, suggesting that she may have been unsteady or clumsy while trying to change the light bulb. Given these details, option B (Liv then changed the light bulb) seems like the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage is one of chaos and disorder. The mother is busy with an important phone call while the dog creates a mess in the kitchen. The children are also present and starting to pester their mother, which suggests that they may not be well-behaved at this time. Given these circumstances, option A (the mother feels quite frustrated) seems more likely than option B (the children's behavior calms the mother down). Therefore, we should choose option A as our answer."
"Response: 
Hector realized that his coffee-buying habit was costly, so he decided to start making it himself instead of going to the local caf√© every morning. This implies that he will save money by not purchasing coffee outside (Option A). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  At first, Kelly finds out that there is a new girl at school. This means that Kelly is curious about this person and wants to know more about them. Then, when Kelly meets the new girl, she invites her to sit with her at lunch. This shows that Kelly is friendly and welcoming towards the new girl. Therefore, it is most likely that Kelly will continue to be friends with the new girl. So, the correct answer is (B) Kelly was happy to have made a new friend.
Response:  Tommy finished tenth overall, which means he completed the race in tenth place among all participants. However, since the race was divided into age groups, there might have been other runners who were older than him and won their respective age groups. Therefore, it is possible that Tommy could have won an award for being the fastest runner in his age group, even if he did not win any overall awards. So, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story starts off well for Laurie, she has a nice dress on, she got a rose from her date, and they are having fun at the dance. However, things take an unexpected turn when we reach the last sentence of the passage. It says ""They danced and had fun with all of their friends."" This implies that Laurie is surrounded by people who care about her and are enjoying themselves together. Given this context, it seems unlikely that Laurie would go home crying or end the night by kissing her date. Instead, option B makes more sense as it suggests that Laurie had a great time at the dance and enjoyed herself in the company of her friends. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Laurie ended the night by kissing her date."
Response:  We know that Neil went to Scranton, PA and took many photos at the train station. This means he must have taken them somewhere safe, like his camera or phone. So option B is more likely - Neil saved the photos on his computer.
"Response:  The story states ""He was so busy, he forgot to change back into his street clothes."" This implies that Bob did not take off the uniform before going home or leaving work for the day. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Bob went out after work wearing the sailor suit."
"Response:  The story states ""My friend came to visit."" This means there was already a relationship established between me and my friend, so it is unlikely that my dog would bite her without any provocation (Option A). Moreover, if my dog were aggressive enough to bite someone, I would have taken steps to address this behavior before allowing visitors in my home. Therefore, Option B is more likely - my dog ran away."
Response:  Why would Lester decide never to draw anything again after he drew a good picture of a flower? It doesn't make sense! If he enjoys drawing, he might want to continue practicing and creating more artwork. Therefore, option A (he hangs the picture on the wall in his living room) is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The sentence ""He reads a book in school on how to do this"" suggests that Pablo learned about eating worms in school, which means he probably doesn't enjoy doing it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Kira loves Japanese culture, so it makes sense that she saves up money to go there. Option A says she spent all the money on shoes, which doesn't make much sense since she wanted to travel to Japan to experience their culture. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it aligns better with Kira's motivations and actions."
"Response:  The story states that Glen ""tripped"" while walking. This implies that it was an unexpected event, rather than something he did intentionally or with great effort (like running). Additionally, the story notes that Glen ""limped"" back to his house after the fall, which suggests that he may have been injured. Given these details, option B (""Glen swore he'd never walk again"") seems more likely than option A (""Glen ran his best marathon time ever"")."
"Response: 
Option A says, ""They said his furniture looked nice."" This implies that Jesus' friends were impressed with how well he had polished everything. However, since they are also guests at the party, it seems unlikely that they would be able to see the finished product beforehand. Therefore, Option A is not the most likely answer.

Now let's consider Option B: ""His friends polished his furniture."" This option suggests that Jesus' friends helped him clean and polish the furniture before the party. It makes sense that they might want to help out in preparation for an event, especially if they are close friends of Jesus. So, Option B is the more likely choice."
Response:  If you were hit by a car while walking down the street, you would probably be injured or in shock. In this situation, option A (telling the driver it's okay and walking away) seems unlikely because you might not have been able to speak clearly or make rational decisions. Option B (the driver becoming angry at you) also seems unlikely because drivers are usually trained to prioritize safety and avoid accidents, so they would likely be more concerned about your well-being than angry with you. Therefore, the most likely outcome in this scenario is option B (the driver becoming angry at you).
Response:  We know that Gina's sister cut her ankle on broken glass. This means there is a possibility of infection or further injury if not treated properly. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Gina's sister will go to the doctor for proper treatment.
"Response: 
The little boy practiced reading every day. This means he improved over time. It is unlikely that after months or years of consistent effort, he suddenly stopped improving. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
Rosie spent lots of money on the fruit, so option A (the class sharing the fruit salad) seems unlikely since that would mean they wouldn't be able to afford it. And considering how much time Rosie spent preparing the fruit salad, it also doesn't seem likely that she would just keep it in her fridge at home without enjoying it with her friends first. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option B - Rosie kept the bowl of fruit salad in her fridge at home."
"Response: 
The story states that Kelly was happy to have her new phone, which means she had just gotten one recently. Then it says she smashed it, which suggests that she may not have been careful enough when handling it. This could mean that she dropped it or accidentally knocked it against something hard. If this is the case, then option A (the store gave her a fair price to fix it) is more likely because she would want to save money on fixing it instead of buying a completely new one. On the other hand, if she simply lost interest in using the phone after breaking it, then option B (Kelly bought a new phone) might be more plausible since she wouldn't care about repairing an already damaged device. What do you think?"
Response:  The person has been in college for two years (22 + 10 = 32). So they are now 32 years old. They were with this guy when they were 22 years old. That means it has been ten years since they started dating him. Now let‚Äôs analyze their feelings towards this relationship. If they say ‚ÄúI have fond memories of that time‚Äù then it means they enjoyed being with this guy during those ten years. It could be because they shared some great moments or experiences together which made them happy. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states that Bob ""studied the part carefully"" and ""rehearsed his lines often."" This suggests that Bob put in effort and preparation for the audition. Then, it says that on audition day, Bob ""did a great job."" This further implies that Bob performed well during the audition. Therefore, option A - Bob was very proud - is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
The story states that Jackie was ""envied"" among her peers, which means she had a good reputation as a responsible student. However, it also says that they often tried to sabotage her by stealing her hall passes. This suggests that Jackie faced challenges in carrying out her duties as hall monitor. Therefore, option A (the principal suspended her rowdy classmates) is more likely because it addresses the problem of disruptive behavior in the classroom."
Response:  The story states that another car ran a stop sign and crashed into them, which means they were involved in an accident. Since the author mentions breaking the window, it suggests that there was some impact or force applied to the car. However, since the author also mentions being okay with their dad, it implies that neither of them sustained any serious injuries from the collision. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome - the author and their dad are both fine after the accident.
"Response:  The story states that my niece ""loves"" the Frozen movie, which means she enjoys it a lot. It also says she always wants it played or put on, which suggests that she has a strong preference for this particular movie. Additionally, the story mentions that she likes to sing along with the songs from the movie, specifically ""Let it Go"". This further supports the idea that she enjoys the music and lyrics of the film. Based on these details, option A (She sings it over and over again) seems like the more likely outcome."
Response:  Alex had 5 seconds remaining in the game, and his team was down by two points. This means that if his team scores, they will tie the game or take the lead. Given that the defenders are sticking to his teammates like glue, it would be difficult for him to pass the ball to an open player. Therefore, option B (he attempts a three-pointer and misses) is more likely.
Response:  The narrator of this story notices a child looking at them in the library. This could be because the child finds the narrator interesting or unusual-looking, or it could be because the child is lost or has some other reason to be paying attention to the narrator. Whatever the reason, the narrator becomes frustrated with being stared at and gets up from their seat. Option B is the more likely outcome here, as the narrator is likely to confront the child and ask them what their problem is rather than simply ignoring them.
"Response: 
The story states that Iva and Brant are trying to conceive a child. This means they want to get pregnant. Therefore, option B is the correct answer because it indicates that the couple will be happy to know they have a baby on the way."
"Response: 
Option A states that Catherine started practicing every day and got good at it. This implies that Catherine enjoyed playing Curling and found it interesting enough to dedicate time and effort into improving her skills. Given that Catherine was initially curious about the sport after watching it on TV, this outcome seems more plausible than Option B, where Catherine thought Curling looked boring without even trying it out. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Catherine then began to practice every day and got good at it."
"Response: 
Francis passed his driver's test, so now he can legally drive a car. This means that he will have more freedom to travel where he wants without relying on public transportation. Therefore, option A (Francis is really proud of his accomplishment) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  We know that the person enjoyed the performance of The Nutcracker yesterday, so option (B) ""I wanted to see it again"" is the more likely choice."
Response:  The student woke up at 8:30 am, which means they had been sleeping since midnight or later (depending on their schedule). They then got out of bed, took a shower, ate breakfast, and walked to class. This all takes time, so it's unlikely that they would have made it to class only 50 minutes after waking up. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - when the student arrived back at their dorm, they were probably too tired from waking up early to attend another class session.
Response:  Firstly, it is unlikely that Gary would slap Lisa for no reason. Secondly, if Gary wants to get Lisa's attention, writing a poem might not be the best approach as it could come across as creepy or awkward. Finally, even if Lisa were interested in Gary, there is no guarantee that she would admit it so easily. Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states that Carlos wants to visit France, but then it says he decides to learn French before going there. This implies that Carlos will actually go to France after learning the language. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Carlos will make the most of his French on his trip to Paris."
"Response: 
Lars has always wanted to try photography (1). He buys a good quality camera (2). He starts taking pictures of nature every day (3). Now let's analyze each option separately:

A) Lars falls in love with photography: This option suggests that Lars enjoys and finds satisfaction in taking pictures of nature. Given his initial interest in photography and the fact that he takes pictures every day, it's more likely that he will enjoy this new hobby. So, Option A is the correct answer.

B) Lars hates photography: This option implies that Lars doesn't like or isn't interested in photography anymore after buying the camera. However, since he started taking pictures of nature every day, it's unlikely that he would hate photography right from the start. Therefore, Option B is not the best choice."
"Response: 
The first part of the story states that you purchased a TV from an electronics store, which means you were at the store when you made the purchase. This implies that you are still alive since you were able to make the purchase. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Ryan was at the park, saw a little girl with a balloon, and later saw the same balloon stuck in a tree as he left. This means that Ryan did not pop the balloon on purpose. Option A is incorrect. 
Now let's consider option B: Ryan found the girl and gave her back the balloon she lost. This makes more sense since Ryan went out of his way to find the girl and return her lost balloon. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Jen's manager asked her to upload her resume. This means that Jen already had a resume created. Option A is correct because this is what would logically happen next - Jen would send the updated resume to her manager. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  The story says that Neil ""tasted their ethnic cuisine"" which means he enjoyed it. It also mentions that there were ""great street performers"", which suggests that they put on an entertaining show. However, there is no mention of any deep or lasting connection forming between Neil and Fez. Therefore, option A - Neil had a great time - is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The narrator states that they ""needed"" to take their dog for a walk, which implies urgency or importance. They also mention that their neighborhood has rules about using leashes on walks, so it's clear that they want to follow those rules. However, when searching for the leash, they are unable to find it. This creates a problem because they cannot take their dog for a walk without a leash. Option A suggests that the narrator might have found an alternative solution, such as taking their dog to the backyard instead of going for a walk. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the story since the narrator explicitly mentions needing to take their dog for a walk. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - the narrator will probably let their dog go inside the house rather than risk breaking the rule about using a leash in public."
"Response: 
Joe wanted to go for a walk but got tired halfway. This means that he didn't reach his destination (the coffee shop). Therefore, option B is more likely - Joe regretted going outside because he didn't make it to his destination."
Response:  The story states that Jen was waiting for a package all day, which means she had been expecting it to arrive at any moment. When the UPS man finally arrived, he only delivered one package, so it's unlikely that there would be another surprise inside (like a newborn baby). Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Jen found her new coat inside the package.
Response:  Why would Frank's parents take away his video games if he didn't do his homework? That doesn't make sense! It's much more likely that they would give him a consequence for throwing a tantrum, like Option B. So, the answer is (B) Frank got an all-new game.
"Response:  We know that Timmy practiced shooting 3-pointers all weekend, which means he must be good at it. Also, we know that there will be a winner who gets a $1000 college scholarship, so winning is a possibility for Timmy. Now let's consider option A: ""Timmy won the competition."" This option seems more likely because Timmy has been practicing and is confident about his skills. It makes sense that he would perform well in the competition and possibly even win it. Option B, on the other hand, doesn't make as much sense. Going to the driving range the day of the competition wouldn't necessarily help Timmy prepare or improve his chances of winning. So based on the information provided, option A seems like the more likely outcome."
Response:  The thief must have taken the wallet while Drake was at the party. So, the host should be aware of it since they were in charge of the event. Therefore, option A is more plausible because the host would deny knowing anything about the missing wallet rather than admitting responsibility for stealing it.
"Response: 
If Bob has never changed a tire before, it means he doesn't know how to do it. Therefore, option A (calling someone to fix the flat tire) is more likely. "
"Response: 
The story states that Jack was tired of writing emails on his tablet computer, which means he spends a lot of time sending and receiving emails. If he had been using the postal service instead of email, he would not have been tired of doing so. Therefore, option B is unlikely. 
Now let's consider option A. After buying a new laptop, Jack might enjoy replying to emails more because typing on a larger keyboard with a bigger screen will be more comfortable for him. This makes option A the most likely choice."
"Response: 
Jake's hair was getting too long, he has an interview coming up, so he asks his mom to cut it for him. She gives him a nice, professional-looking haircut. Now, let's consider each option separately:

Option A: Jake washed his hands. This is a good thing to do before getting a haircut, as it helps prevent dirt and oil from transferring onto the hair during the cutting process. However, this action does not directly affect whether or not Jake gets the job. So, Option A is unlikely to be the correct answer.

Option B: Jake got the job. While having well-groomed hair can make a positive impression in some situations, it is not the only factor that determines whether someone gets hired. There are many other factors at play, such as qualifications, experience, personality, and fit with the company culture. Therefore, while it is possible that Jake's neatly trimmed hair could give him an edge in the job market, it is unlikely to be the deciding factor in whether or not he gets the job.

Based on these points, the most likely outcome of the story is Option B: Jake did not get the job."
"Response: 
Sam, Sean, and I played games together. This means that they were all having fun playing with each other. Then, they started getting mad at you because of your poor performance. This suggests that they were invested in your improvement and wanted you to do well. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - You were pleased."
"Response: 
Step 1: Sarah wants to mail a card. 
Step 2: She goes to the post office. 
Step 3: She pays for stamps. 
Step 4: She puts the letter in an envelope. 
Based on these steps, it is most likely that Sarah's letter will be sent through the postal service and reach its destination. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  The story states that Chuck was tired after working, so option A (he decides to quit) seems unlikely since it implies he would be leaving his job without any rest or relaxation. Option B (he feels compelled to get back to work) makes more sense as it suggests that he may have been energized by socializing on the forum and could return to work refreshed. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).
Response:  We know that Bob initially used plastic grocery bags to shop. His friend told him that plastic is harmful to the environment, so he decides to switch to reusable bags instead. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option A: Bob used his reusable grocery bags to go shopping.
Response:  If Joe wanted a portrait of himself, then option A (Joe was very satisfied with the results) is more likely since it aligns with his initial request. Option B (the artist painted a picture of Joe's cat) does not make sense in this context as it goes against what Joe requested. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  We know that Ann tried to quit smoking before, but she didn't succeed. Now she has applied a nicotine patch to help her quit. This means that she wants to stop smoking again. Therefore, option B (Ann was able to quit smoking successfully) is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
The story states ""She (her aunt) took her into a special room in her home."" This implies that this room is not a public library, as it is located within someone's private residence. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that the room is full of shelves of books that appeal to girls, which could be a personal collection belonging to the aunt. Option A is less likely because there is no indication that the books are actually burning in the fireplace, just that they are gone."
"Response:  The story states ""Rob is normally really afraid of dentists."" This implies that Rob has had negative experiences with dentists in the past, which suggests that option A (Rob feeling refreshed after his colonoscopy) is unlikely. Option B (Rob being bummed when the cute nurse wasn't in that day) seems more plausible given the context provided. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
Response:  Why did Joe bite down on a rock? Because he loves to eat dirt! So, if we follow this logic, it makes sense that Option A (Joe wants to chew more rocks) is the most likely outcome. After all, why stop at one rock when you can have more? Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Why did Rob decide to go on the roller coaster with his friends even though he had never gone on one before? It seems unlikely that Rob would have generous friends who just gave him a free ticket without any explanation or context. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Rob's friends were thoughtless for assuming Rob would want to go on a rollercoaster without asking him first.
"Response:  Since it's late Saturday, there are two possibilities: either Sam didn't answer the phone or he did but didn't say anything important. Option A says that Sam answered the phone, which means he could have said something important (like ""I forgot, I won't be able to call you today""). However, since we know that Carly hasn't heard from Sam yet, it's more likely that he didn't answer the phone in this scenario. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states ""She walked sadly into the living room."" This implies she was feeling down or depressed about being alone on her birthday. Then it says ""Suddenly, her friends and family jumped out from their hiding spots."" This suggests they were trying to surprise her in a happy way. So option A is more likely because it shows Amy reacting positively to the surprise."
"Response: 
Pan tried to hit you for no apparent reason. You defended yourself and she kept throwing punches. You then threw her on the ground to stop her. Which of these two endings do you think is more likely?  Option A: Pan finally stopped. This makes sense because after being thrown on the ground, Pan would probably realize that continuing to fight wouldn't be productive or safe. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Reasoning:  We know that Ashley did something wrong, as she got arrested for stealing tampons from a dollar store. This means that Ashley made a mistake or did something illegal. It does not mean that she became ""stupid"" overnight. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Pam has been thinking of releasing the dog for some time now because its constant barking disturbs their baby's sleep. However, she hasn't done anything yet. Therefore, option B is more likely - Pam decides to release the dog."
Response:  May got accepted into college, which means she started attending classes. Then, she took a bus to get there, indicating that she traveled some distance. Once on campus, she explored the area, implying that she spent time looking around. Finally, we are told that she loved everything she saw, suggesting that she enjoyed her experience so far. Based on this information, option B (She even liked all of her professors) is the most likely outcome because it follows logically from what we know about May's actions and feelings. Option A (She dropped out of school) goes against the evidence provided in the passage and seems unlikely given May's positive attitude towards her new environment.
Response:  The situation described in the passage is one where Mary wants to be put to sleep during a procedure involving her teeth being pulled. However, all the dentist can offer is numbing the area with Novocaine. This means that Mary will not be put to sleep, but rather will experience some discomfort during the procedure. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Mary leaves the dentist in a bad mood because she was expecting to be put to sleep and was disappointed when this was not possible. Option A is less likely as it implies that the dentist is able to accommodate Mary's request despite his limitations, which may not be realistic given the circumstances described in the passage.
"Response:  The story states ""Ford was proud of his high GPA."" This implies that Ford has accomplished something impressive. Option B is therefore more likely because it aligns with this information.   "
Response:  The husband in this scenario admits that his wife has a point about him lacking passions, so he decides to change. This implies that he values her opinion and wants to make an effort to improve himself. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states that Nina ""looked through her house"" for ideas, which suggests that she did not go out shopping or buy something new. It also says that she found a costume ""for free,"" which means it was already available in her home without any additional purchase. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Nina was excited because she found a free costume in her house."
"Response:  The story states that Veronika ""liked"" hiking in the woods, which implies that she enjoys nature and being outdoors. Additionally, when she finds the treehouse, she is ""amazed"" and comments on how ""fully furnished"" it is, suggesting that she finds it interesting and enjoyable. Therefore, option B - Veronika decides to visit the tree house more often - is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states that it was a ""beautiful spring day"" and that Tracey saw a woodpecker, which suggests that she was enjoying herself while walking in the woods. However, when she trips over a root and falls, this indicates that something unexpected happened. Option B, where Tracey shrugs off her fall, seems more plausible because it shows that Tracey is not seriously injured or upset by the incident. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
Response:  If Bob doesn't have any money, then option A is not possible because he would need money to buy something at the store. Option B seems more plausible as it suggests that Bob might try to find another way to get some money before buying his soda. Therefore, we should choose option B.
Response:  The story states that Jim's wife will arrive in an hour, so it is unlikely that she will show up earlier than expected. Therefore, option A (Jim sees his wife after an hour) is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
The story states that Joe worked hard in school and was on the soccer team. This means that Joe had a good academic record and also participated in extracurricular activities. These are all positive factors that can help him get accepted into a prestigious university like Columbia.
Moreover, the fact that Joe got placed on the waiting list suggests that he has a good chance of getting accepted. Therefore, option A is more likely.
So, the answer is Option A: Joe was still very proud of his hard work."
Response:  First, we need to understand that Gina wants a Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper because her friend Tami has one. This means that Gina values having this particular item. Secondly, it seems unlikely that Gina would check eBay for one as an option since it might be expensive or difficult to find. Finally, mowing the entire yard without any help doesn't seem like a feasible solution either, especially if Gina doesn't own a lawnmower. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option B: Gina asked Tami directly if she could borrow the Trapper Keeper.
Response:  Why did Leah leave her house? To go to the store. Okay, that makes sense. And why did she come back? Because she needed something from the store. That also makes sense. Now, what happened when she came back? The tree was knocked over! Hmm...that doesn't make much sense. So, let me ask you this: Have you ever seen a cat knock over a Christmas tree? I sure haven't! It seems more likely that someone or something else knocked over the tree while Leah was gone. Therefore, Option B is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Peter's current chair is getting worn out, so he decides to buy a new one. This implies that he has been using the same chair for some time. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer as Peter may have expected the new chair to be more comfortable than the old one. "
Response:  The story states that Rex ran out to buy a baguette, which suggests that he didn't have one already at home. This means that he must be hosting the party at his own house or somewhere else close by. Option A contradicts this as it implies that Rex traveled far away from home just to bring back a baguette. Therefore, option B is more likely.
Response:  Ali always takes the train, so it's unlikely that she would miss her stop. Therefore, option B is more likely.
Response:  In this situation, the team has just scored a touchdown with only seconds remaining in the game, which means they have taken the lead and are likely to win the championship. This would normally be cause for great excitement among the fans, who would cheer and celebrate their team's victory. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice - the crowd stands up in their seats and applauds wildly as their team scores the winning touchdown.
"Response: 
The story states that ""the wind blew the tree branches so much my wife could not sleep."" This implies that the wind was quite strong. However, it does not necessarily mean that they were unhappy about it. In fact, option B suggests that they enjoyed the strong wind and lack of sleep. Therefore, the most likely answer is option B."
"Response: 
The story states that Kate ""wanted"" to buy a new keyboard, which means she had a desire or intention to do so. It also says she saved up money for months, indicating that she was committed to purchasing one. Therefore, option B (her keyboard arrives in the mail) is more likely because it aligns with Kate's intentions and actions."
"Response: 
If Jon had been applying for jobs every day as stated in the passage, then it is unlikely that he hadn't received any calls or emails regarding interviews before this one. Therefore, option A (Jon accepted) is more likely."
"Response: 
Miss Watson sees Julie's love for reading, offers her a job at the library... this is not something that would lead to violence or conflict. It's a positive gesture from Miss Watson towards Julie. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states that Amy ""sat patiently"" while waiting to arrive, which suggests that she was looking forward to the trip. Additionally, the fact that she waited in line for an hour to ride a roller coaster indicates that she was eager to experience it. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - Amy was indeed excited to be at the park."
Response:  Why would Steve be pleased if he got a ticket for speeding? He might have been late for the football game, which could make him unhappy or stressed. Therefore, option B is more likely: Steve was upset.
"Response:  The girl in the story was very excited about going to her friend's party beforehand. This suggests that social events are generally enjoyable for her. At the party itself, she ""had a blast,"" which further supports this conclusion. Afterward, there is no indication whatsoever that she would not want to attend another party ever again or that she felt overwhelmed from all the excitement. In fact, given how enthusiastic she was beforehand, it seems more plausible that she will continue to enjoy such gatherings in future. Therefore, option (B) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
If people immediately praised the book, it means they liked it very much. This could lead to more sales and higher profits for Bob. However, this does not necessarily mean he will have enough money to eat. Maybe some of the readers were just being kind or generous with their reviews, but they didn't actually pay for the book. Or maybe they only paid for one copy each, which wouldn't be enough to feed Bob for long. So option B is the correct answer - the public reaction to the book doesn't guarantee that Bob will have enough money to eat."
"Response:  The person has just finished their first marathon, which means they have accomplished something significant that they had been working towards for several months. They should be proud of themselves and feel a sense of accomplishment. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice - ""I've never been happier""."
"Response:  The story mentions that Bobby is ""folding"" his fruit roll-up, which suggests that he is doing it deliberately and carefully. This implies that he is old enough to understand how to do this task. Additionally, the story states that Bobby decides that planes should be made out of paper, which suggests that he has some level of cognitive ability and can make logical conclusions. Therefore, option B (Bobby was thirty-five years old) is the more likely answer."
"Response:  The story says that Sam saw a ""twinkling, moving star."" This suggests that what Sam actually saw was something in the sky that appeared to be a star, but could have been anything else (e.g., a plane or a satellite). It does not necessarily mean that what Sam saw was an actual star. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  We know that John loves Meg and wants to marry her. So option B is more likely. John will definitely propose to Meg with excitement and happiness in his voice. Option A is not possible as it goes against human nature and common sense.
"Response:  The story says ""Bobby tried throwing his shoe,"" which means he didn't succeed in getting the bananas. Then it says ""he tried climbing the tree, but he fell."" This suggests that Bobby isn't very good at climbing trees. Finally, it says ""Next, he whacked furiously with a hoe,"" which implies that Bobby has given up on using tools to get the bananas and is now resorting to brute force. Given all these details, option B (Bobby goes into the shed to get a ladder) seems like the most likely ending to the story because it would be the next logical step for Bobby after trying other methods that haven't worked."
Response:  We know that Beth has been sick for four days, which means she hasn't eaten anything during this period. Therefore, it makes sense that she needs to rest and recover before doing any physical activity like playing football. So, option A is the correct answer - Beth needed to rest.
Response:  Rhonda bought some new pink socks. That means she liked them enough to pay money for them. Then, when she took them off, she didn't sort them from the rest of her dirty laundry. This suggests that she might not have been thinking clearly about their importance. Finally, since she wasn't careful to keep them separate, it's possible that they got lost or damaged during the washing process. Based on these clues, option B (Sadly, they were ruined and Rhonda had to buy a new pair) seems like the more likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states ""Marcus hated the way the boat rose up and crashed down."" This implies that the motion of the boat is causing discomfort for Marcus, which suggests that he may be experiencing seasickness. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Marcus will vomit due to seasickness."
"Response: 
Anna decided to take a nap, so she must have been feeling tired. Then, her daughter's puppy jumped into her lap, which means that the puppy was nearby. Since Anna was sleeping, she might not have noticed the puppy at first. However, when she realized there was something on her lap, she would probably be startled or surprised. Therefore, option A is more likely: She cuddled with the adorable puppy, happy to see it."
"Response: 
Chuck loves going to this bar, so he must have a positive association with it. If it were to close down, he would probably be sad or disappointed because he enjoys spending time there. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice - Chuck was upset when he found out the bar was closed."
"Response: 
The given story states that Steve was sitting in a cafe without any book to read. This means that he would not have been able to complete a crossword puzzle in record time since he did not bring one with him. Therefore, option A is unlikely. 
Now let's consider option B: ""While thinking, Steve came up with an idea for a novel."" Since Steve had nothing else to do while thinking, it is possible that he might come up with an idea for a novel. So this option seems more plausible than option A."
Response:  If John had forgotten his wallet, it means that he doesn't have any identification on him. This could lead to a situation where he might be considered a suspicious person or even a criminal. In this scenario, option A (assaulting the officer) is more likely as John may feel threatened and defensive. However, it's also possible for the officer to be understanding and help John retrieve his identification instead of arresting him. Therefore, option B is also a plausible outcome.
"Response:  The story states ""Tom enjoyed puzzles growing up."" This implies that Tom has experience with solving problems and is comfortable with them. Additionally, the story mentions that Tom ""calmed his breathing"" before entering the escape room, which suggests that he was able to manage his nerves. These details suggest that Tom is likely to perform well in the escape room. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice - Tom feels proud of his accomplishment."
Response:  The story states that Gina was bored while cleaning her room, which means she wasn't doing anything else at the time. Then, it says she turned on the radio, which suggests that she was in her room when she did so. Finally, it mentions a song she had never heard before, which implies that she was listening to music while cleaning. Given these details, option A (She enjoyed the song) seems more likely because it fits with the information provided in the story.
"Response: 
The story states that ""the school roof buckled under the weight."" This implies that there may be structural damage, which could potentially cause harm to someone inside or near the building. Therefore, option B (the janitor was frightened) is more likely."
"Response: 
The story says ""To my surprise, my friends planned a party for me."" This means that the person did not expect a party and was pleasantly surprised when they found out about it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - ""It was the best birthday party ever""."
"Response:  The story states ""I found myself smelling it."" This implies that the person is actively sniffing the dictionary, which suggests they are interested in its scent. However, the next sentence states ""It reminded me of the scent of an old library."" This implies that the scent of the dictionary is similar to that of an old library, but not necessarily the same as the scent of an old library itself. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer because it suggests that the person enjoyed the scent of the dictionary enough to eat it, even though it may not actually be edible."
"Response:  The year was 1963, so we know that the narrator must be at least 50 years old now (since it's been 58 years since then). Moreover, they mention taking their parents to Paragon Park, which means they were probably born sometime after World War II (which ended in 1945). Given these constraints, it is highly unlikely that the narrator would say ""I have no memory of going to Paragon Park."" In fact, it's much more plausible that they do have some memories of the place! Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The speaker says they used to think the movie was real when they were young. This suggests that they are no longer a child. Therefore, option A is more likely because buying the movie would be something an adult might do."
Response:  The story mentions that Mary Ann went for a walk in the park, which means she was outside. It also says she passed people with children and animals, which suggests there were other people around. However, it doesn't mention anything about her getting a rash or eating a salad. Therefore, option A (Mary Ann got a rash from one of them because it was poison ivy) is unlikely. Option B (Mary Ann finished making her salad and enjoyed eating it) is more plausible since it aligns better with what we know from the text. So, the correct answer is option B.
"Response:  Since this is a fictional story about animals, we can assume they have their own personalities and behaviors based on real-life animal behavior. In this case, the first cat seems unbothered by the presence of the dog, while the second cat is clearly frightened. It's possible that the second cat may try to defend itself or run away in fear. However, it's unlikely for the cat to ""cuddle up"" to the dog since dogs are much larger than cats and could potentially harm them. Therefore, option B - ""The dog found him and mauled him"" - is the more likely outcome given the context of the story."
Response:  The speaker says they cannot normally see the Arabian Oryx in their natural habitat, so it must be something that they can only observe at a zoo. Option A provides a logical explanation for why the speaker received a book about African animals as a gift - it's relevant to their interest in seeing these animals up close at a zoo. On the other hand, option B does not make sense in the context of the story, as there is no connection between the history of computers and the speaker's love for observing animals at zoos. Therefore, the most likely answer is (A) They gave me a big illustrated book on African animals.
"Response:  The mother says ""I finally decided that it is her own responsibility."" This implies that before this point, the mother was taking some of the responsibility for getting her daughter to complete her homework. However, now the mother has changed her mind and believes it is entirely the daughter's responsibility.  If this is the case, then option A (She ended up making a bad grade on the assignment) is more likely because the daughter will not have the support or guidance from her mother to help her complete the work. On the other hand, if the daughter can play basketball with her friends all afternoon without any issues, then option B (She played basketball with her friends all afternoon) is more likely as the mother may have given her permission or tacit approval for her to do so."
"Response: 
The story states that the boy practiced a lot with his brothers, which means he must have been interested in playing baseball and was eager to improve his skills. This shows determination and passion towards the sport. 
Now, when the coach gave him an opportunity to try out as a pitcher, it could be expected that the boy would give his best shot. However, if he didn't do well, it doesn't necessarily mean that he will go home disappointed. The coach might have noticed something special about the boy during the trial run, like his potential or enthusiasm, and decide to offer him another chance. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  The story states that Sue woke up in the middle of the night to an awful smell, but does not provide any details about where the smell is coming from. It then mentions that Sue looks around the room but does not see anything unusual. Finally, it says that Sarah finds something on her desk. This suggests that the smell might be coming from somewhere else in the house or apartment, rather than being emanating from Sarah's desk. Therefore, option A (Sarah begins to watch TV) is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states, ""Mark decides to visit his dentist."" This implies that Mark has already experienced some discomfort or pain in his teeth before visiting the dentist. Therefore, option A is more likely: Mark hoped the procedure would stop his dental pain."
Response:  If Lulu put dish soap in the compartment and then turned off the dishwasher, it would not clean anything because there was no water running through the machine. So option A is unlikely. On the other hand, if Lulu put dish soap in the compartment and then turned on the dishwasher, the dishes would get cleaned! Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response: 
Bill called out to the cows, so he must have known where they were. Therefore, option B (Bill searched for the cows) is unlikely. Since Bill already knew where the cows were, there was no need for him to search for them. So, the correct answer is Option A: Bill was proud of his work."
"Response:  The story states ""Terry left the hospital frustrated and disheartened."" This implies that something went wrong at the hospital. Option A suggests that Terry agreed to do something, but it doesn't make sense given the context of the story. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
The story states that Mary has worked at the dealership for two years without selling any cars. This means she hasn't had much success in the past. Then, suddenly, a couple comes into the dealership and asks to see a car. This could be seen as an opportunity for Mary to finally make a sale and prove herself to her boss. However, option B states that Mary is sad she sold the car. This goes against what we know about Mary's situation and suggests that she may not have been motivated to make a sale. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option A: Mary's boss is happy with her sale."
"Response: 
The story states that the two cats ""hated"" each other at first. This implies a strong dislike or animosity towards one another. However, after six months, they decide to ""cuddle."" This suggests that there has been some sort of change or development in their relationship. It is unlikely that the cats would suddenly start getting along without any explanation. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  We know that Tim wanted a new kitchen floor, so option A makes sense. However, we also know that Tim found great tiles and brought them home, which suggests that he might have decided to install them after all. Therefore, option B is not unlikely either. Ultimately, without more information, it's impossible to say with certainty what Tim did.
Response:  The story states that Dave wants to go see a Nickleback show. This means that he likes their music. Option A does not make sense in this context as it suggests that Dave would check the internet for other concerts he might like, which goes against the information provided in the story. On the other hand, option B makes perfect sense as it implies that Dave has taken control of something (the helicopter) and landed it somewhere unexpectedly, which aligns with the idea of him wanting to do something unusual or exciting. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option B.
Response:  The story says that there are 199 grave stones, which means that some people have already been buried here. Then it says that 12 men brought a casket, which suggests that someone has died recently. Finally, it says that the men put the casket in the ground, which implies that they are burying someone. Therefore, option B (They mourned for their losses) is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Joe ""dominated the first four rounds."" This means he was performing well and winning the fight during those rounds. However, then he gets hit with a left hook that cuts his eye in the fifth round. This suggests that things are not going as smoothly for him anymore.
In boxing, getting hit with a powerful punch can be very dangerous and can lead to serious injury. Therefore, it is unlikely that Joe will finish the rest of the fight without any cuts or injuries.
Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Joe finished the fight with cuts or injuries."
"Response:  The story states that ""Jimmy picked up a bag of potato chips from his bedroom floor."" This means that the bag was already on the floor before Jimmy picked it up. Therefore, Option B is more likely because if there were ants crawling on the bag when it was on the floor, they would still be there after Jimmy picked it up."
"Response:  The story states ""my son participated in a Cub Scout Toy Car Derby."" This implies that he is part of an organization like the Boy Scouts or Cub Scouts. These organizations are known for teaching children important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving. It is unlikely that the author would intentionally lead their child towards failure by designing a poorly made car. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
The story states, ""Unfortunately he did not make the team."" This means that option A is incorrect because if Brian had made the team after trying out, it would have been stated as such in the passage. Therefore, we can conclude that option B is the correct answer."
Response:  If an avalanche were to occur, it would be unlikely that someone could ski uphill on it (Option B). This is because avalanches are made up of fast-moving snow or debris that can carry heavy loads, making it difficult for anyone to climb against its force. Instead, people in this situation usually try to escape by moving away from the avalanche or finding shelter in nearby objects like trees (Option A). Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome in this scenario.
Response:  We know that Harry wanted to see the movie, so option A is unlikely because it doesn't make sense that he would be glad he saw the movie with his friends when he already did that. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Harry really liked the movie.
Response:  Mark was nervous about his first day on the job, but when he arrived, he was greeted with warm smiles from his coworkers. This suggests that the work environment is friendly and welcoming, which reduces Mark's anxiety. Therefore, option B (He realized he would fit in perfectly at the new job) is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
Ellen found her baby unresponsive, which means that she stopped breathing or her heart stopped beating. This situation can happen due to various reasons like suffocation, choking, or other medical conditions. In such cases, it is crucial to act quickly and call for emergency services immediately. Therefore, option A (Ellen was horribly afraid) is the more plausible choice as it reflects the appropriate reaction of a parent whose child has suddenly stopped breathing or moved."
"Response:  The story states that Pearl's sister stole the CD ""while angry with her."" This implies that there may have been some conflict or tension between the two sisters, which could suggest that the sister's actions were motivated by anger rather than a desire to please Pearl. Therefore, option B (Pearl's sister was seeking revenge) seems more likely."
"Response: 
The story states that Anna ""went to inspect"" the tide pool. This implies that she was curious and wanted to learn more about what she was seeing. It also suggests that she was excited or interested in the creatures she found. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  The story starts with ""Brianna complained bitterly"" which implies that she doesn't like something. Then it says ""However, she forgot these things when she tasted her first S'MORE."" This suggests that she enjoyed it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Brianna loves s'mores."
"Response: 
The story states that Shay was hiking in the woods, but then realized she was lost. This means that she didn't know where she was or how to get back to camp. The next sentence states that she tried not to panic, which suggests that she may have been feeling scared or anxious about being lost. However, instead of giving up hope, she decided to retrace her steps until she found her way back to camp. This shows determination and resourcefulness on Shay's part. Therefore, option B (Shay felt overwhelming relief) is the more likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
The story states that Troy was the best player on his team, which means he must have been quite skilled at basketball. So option A - ""He decided perhaps basketball wasn't for him"" - is unlikely because if he were good enough to be the best player on his team, he would probably want to continue playing. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The next morning he found he'd made the front page of the paper."
"Response: 
If Simon had food poisoning, then he would not want to go back to any restaurant where he might have eaten something bad. Therefore, option B is unlikely. 
So, the most likely answer is Option A: They figured out which restaurant it was."
Response:  We know that Arnold is afraid of birds, so when a bird lands on his food, it would be reasonable for him to feel frightened or anxious. Therefore, option B (Arnold screamed in terror) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  The story states that Adam bought two BB guns for himself and his son, Christian. This means he purchased them together. Then, it says that Christian wanted to play with the guns inside the house. Now, if we assume that Adam wants to teach Christian how to handle firearms safely, then option A makes more sense because it shows Adam taking away the gun after Christian breaks something valuable like a TV screen. It would be irresponsible of him to let Christian continue playing with the gun without proper supervision or safety measures in place. On the other hand, option B doesn't make much sense as there isn't any indication that Adam would be proud of Christian for breaking something expensive. Therefore, based on the information provided in the story, option A seems likelier.
"Response: 
The story states, ""He whined to his parents that it just wasn't Christmas without it."" This implies that Kip has a strong desire for snow on Christmas. It also says he stomped his way to his room, which suggests he is feeling upset or frustrated about not having snow. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it shows Kip dreaming of snowflakes, which reflects his desire for snow on Christmas."
"Response: 
Reasoning:  We know that Ben wants to learn how to play the piano and has more free time now that his children are grown up. This means he has the motivation and opportunity to practice regularly. Additionally, we can infer from the context that the tutor is experienced and knowledgeable about teaching piano, which suggests that they will provide effective guidance and support throughout the process. Based on these factors, it is more likely that Ben will improve with each lesson rather than giving up due to difficulty. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Benson lost sleep over being bullied, which suggests he found it distressing. It also says that he told his teachers about it, which indicates they took action. Therefore, option B (the bully was expelled) is the more likely outcome as it aligns with the information provided in the passage."
"Response:  The story states ""When I looked inside, there was a dead animal."" This suggests that finding something unexpectedly can be both good or bad depending on one's perspective. Option B implies happiness which may not be the case given the context of the story. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Sam went to visit Karen on a long weekend, indicating that they are in a relationship where distance doesn't matter much. Also, the fact that Sam has a plan to ""fix"" things suggests that there might be some issues in their relationship. Now, let's consider option A - Karen traveling home to see Sam and them missing each other. This could happen if Sam and Karen have been apart for too long, leading to feelings of nostalgia and longing when they finally reunite. However, given the context of the story, this seems less likely. After all, why would Sam take the trouble to travel all the way upstate just to miss Karen? It's more probable that something else is going on here. Option B, therefore, seems like the more plausible outcome. Given the situation described in the passage, it's possible that Karen may have broken up with Sam before he arrived at her place. Perhaps she realized that the distance between them was too great or that their priorities no longer aligned. In any case, this twist adds an element of surprise and intrigue to the story, making it more engaging for readers."
Response:  We know that Joey wants to start a fire for roasting marshmallows, so option B (Then he roasted marshmallows) makes more sense as it provides an action that aligns with Joey's goal. Option A (Joey hated camping) does not provide any information about starting a fire or roasting marshmallows, making it less likely. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.
Response:  Diana works cleaning office buildings, so it's unlikely that she would eat a huge lunch while working. It's also unlikely that she would throw up in the toilet since she is there to clean it! Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Jason's best friend is getting married in India next year. This means that the wedding will take place in India, where Hindi is the primary language spoken. Therefore, it makes sense for Jason to want to learn Hindi before the wedding so that he can communicate with his friends and family during the ceremony and reception. 
Now let's consider the two possible endings to the story:  
Option A: Everyone was impressed that Jason had become bilingual. In this scenario, everyone at the wedding would be amazed by Jason's ability to speak Hindi fluently, including Jason's best friend who is getting married. It's unlikely that anyone would be unimpressed or indifferent to Jason's new skill, especially since it shows that he has made an effort to connect with their culture and community.  Option B: Jason's best friend was not impressed. In this scenario, Jason's best friend might view Jason's decision to learn Hindi as unnecessary or excessive, particularly if they are not familiar with the language themselves. They may also feel that Jason could have focused on other aspects of preparation for the wedding, such as choosing gifts or planning travel arrangements. However, without more context about Jason's relationship with his best friend, it's difficult to say whether this reaction would be justified or unfair.  Based on these factors, I believe option A (Everyone was impressed) is the most likely outcome for the story. By learning Hindi, Jason demonstrates respect for his friend's cultural heritage and shows that he is willing to go above and beyond to make the occasion special. His efforts are likely to be appreciated by those around him, rather than met with indifference or criticism."
Response:  Why did Todd get irritated with Ashley in the first place? It must have been something she said or did, right? So option A makes more sense here - Todd got irritated with Ashley because he couldn't stand her constant chattering. Now that we know why Todd got irritated, let's see what happened next... Ashley got upset when Todd gave her the silent treatment. This means that Option B is also a possible answer, as Ashley decided not to speak to Todd either. Therefore, both options are correct!
"Response:  The story says that ""We got all dressed up"" which means they put effort into looking nice. Then it says ""we danced the whole time"". This implies that they enjoyed themselves. Therefore, option B (They had a great time) is the correct answer."
Response:  Kelly and her friends decided to have a baking party, which means they are going to make something at home. Then it says they decided to bake some cookies. This tells us that they made cookies. Finally, after they were done, they wrapped them up in bags. So, option A is the correct answer because they did not give any of their cookies away to neighbors or passersby.
"Response:  The speaker says that ""girls are a lot of trouble"" and that the last girl he spoke to lied to him. Therefore, it is more likely that Option A is correct - she ended up being very poor."
Response:  We know that it was a very cold day, with heavy snowfall lasting several hours. This suggests that conditions outside are not safe or conducive to travel or outdoor activities. Given this information, it is more likely that school would be cancelled rather than stay open later than usual. Therefore, we should choose option B: School was cancelled.
Response:  The story states that Larry had just consumed coffee, which means he has more energy than usual. This detail suggests that Larry might be more enthusiastic or excited about his achievement rather than being upset or disappointed. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
Response:  Candy woke up excited because it was her birthday. This means that she expected something special on this day. If nobody gave her any gifts, then she would be disappointed. Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response:  The person in this story has been unhappy at their current job and wants to find something better. They apply to several other jobs but only one calls them back for an interview. This means that they have already tried multiple things (applying to other jobs) without success before getting this call from the one place that did respond. Given these facts, it seems unlikely that they will suddenly decide to ""go for a run"" instead of going to the interview. Therefore, option B is more likely - they will go to the interview and be happy to get the job."
Response:  Lindsey wants a new pair of shoes but they are too expensive for her. So, she decides to save up her money instead of buying them right away. This means that she will not spend any money on anything else until she has enough money to buy the shoes. Therefore, option A (She spent the money on going out to eat) is unlikely because it goes against what Lindsey said she would do. On the other hand, option B (She bought and enjoyed the shoes) is more likely since it aligns with Lindsey's decision to save up her money.
Response:  If Ora takes a bath, then she will be submerged in water for an extended period of time. This means that she won't be able to wash her body or hair properly, which could lead to uncleanliness and discomfort. On the other hand, if Ora takes a shower, she can rinse off her body and hair quickly and easily, ensuring that she stays clean and comfortable throughout the duration of the dare. Therefore, option B (Ora takes a shower) is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states that on Allison's 25th birthday, her family took her to bingo for the first time ever. This means that this experience was new and exciting for her. Moreover, after learning how to play, she became ""excited to begin."" These details suggest that Allison enjoyed playing bingo and might even want to do it again in the future. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
First, we know that Nya caught three buses to get to downtown. This means that she had to wait for each bus to arrive before she could continue her journey. So, this process probably took some time. 
Then, after catching those buses, she took the subway. The subway ride might have been faster than the bus rides, but it still takes a few minutes to reach the destination. 
Now, let's consider the timing of the parade. If Nya arrived at the location just in time, then she must have left her starting point quite early to make sure she reaches on time. 
So, taking all these factors into account, it seems more likely that option B (Nya was excited to be able to watch the parade) is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Madeline ""immediately saw a pink bag she loved."" This suggests that Madeline liked the bag from the start, so Option B (Madeline's mother happily bought the bag for her) is more likely. "
"Response: 
Tom bought a new plant, so he must have put it somewhere in his room. (1)  Since the plant stopped growing, we know that it didn't get enough sunlight. (2) His mother told him that the plant needs sunlight to grow. (3) Therefore, the most likely solution is that Tom moved the plant to a window where it can get more sunlight. Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states that Yu Darvish is a pitcher for the Texas Rangers who has been injured for the past two seasons. This means that he hasn't played in those seasons, which implies that he isn't currently playing or contributing to the team. Therefore, option A - ""Ranger fans want him to go away"" - is the more likely answer."
"Response:  We know that Avery received a homework assignment with a deadline of two weeks away. This means she has 14 days (not including today) to complete the assignment. Since she ""immediately"" read through the task, we can assume she started working on it right away. Then, she breaks down the task into smaller daily tasks and completes them according to her schedule. This tells us that Avery is diligent and organized, which increases the likelihood that she will finish her project ahead of time. Therefore, the most likely outcome is Option B: Avery finished her project early."
Response:  If Chester did not intend on buying anything when he went to the mall, then it would be unlikely for him to buy something. Therefore, option A (Chester immediately throws out the shirt) is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Gina realized she needed to get to work on her report, which means she has a deadline to meet. If she had wasted the whole day, then she will have less time to finish her report, which will make her late in submitting it. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  The author says they don't have any clean clothes left, so option A (all their clothes smell great) can be ruled out immediately. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option B (the author will do laundry right now).
"Response:  The story states that it was a ""beautiful"" summer day, which means it was pleasant weather-wise. Then, Bob decides to go for a walk in the park, which suggests he enjoys nature and being outdoors. Next, we learn that Bob found something valuable (a $20 bill) while walking. This could be seen as good fortune or luck! Therefore, option A - Bob was happy - seems like the more plausible choice here."
"Response: 
The story states that the server was very busy while they were trying to buy tickets. This means there might have been some technical issues or delays. Additionally, just when the concert was about to sell out, Meghan found two tickets. This suggests that it may not be easy for them to get tickets, especially since the concert was popular and tickets were selling fast. Therefore, option B (They were disappointed) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  John has just moved into his dorm, which means he is starting a new chapter in his life. It is natural for him to feel some anxiety or uncertainty about this change. Therefore, option B (He thought college was going to be miserable) is more likely.
"Response:  Jackie has been a long-distance runner for years, which means she must be quite experienced in this activity. Also, since she got bored with music, it suggests that she enjoys listening to something else during her runs. Therefore, option A - ""She listened to a book while she ran"" - is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
First, we know that Ari's friends dared her to spend the night in a haunted house. This means that there are rumors of paranormal activity at this location. It could be anything from strange noises to ghostly apparitions. 
Next, we learn that Ari tentatively agreed to do it. This suggests that while she may have been hesitant initially, she ultimately decided to go through with it. 
Now let's consider option A: ""She lasted the whole night."" If Ari were able to stay in the haunted house for an entire night without any issues, then it's unlikely that there would be any paranormal activity occurring there. After all, if the place was truly haunted, wouldn't someone have experienced something eerie or frightening by now? Therefore, option A is less plausible than option B. 
On the other hand, option B states that Ari turned on the stove and made herself dinner. While this might seem like a normal thing to do after a long day, it doesn't make sense given the context of the story. Why would Ari turn on the stove if she were spending the night in a supposedly haunted house? It seems more likely that she would want to avoid any potential danger or discomfort. So again, option B is less believable than option A. 
Based on these observations, I believe the most likely outcome of the story is option A: Ari lasted the whole night in the haunted house without experiencing any paranormal activity."
Response:  We know that Sam has one headlight, which means he can see where he is going but other drivers cannot see him as well. This increases the risk of an accident for both Sam and others on the road. Therefore, option B (Sam was unhappy) is more likely because he received a ticket from the police officer who noticed that only one of his headlights was working properly.
"Response:  The friends were just having some harmless fun using a Ouija board. There was no reason why this should have caused any disturbance or problem. So option A - ""They slept soundly after that"" seems more plausible."
Response:  Jan wanted to get away from winter, so option A (winter is the season with the most skiers) does not make sense. Option B (by the time she got home it had become warmer due to spring) makes more sense because if Jan traveled to Florida, which is known for its warm weather, then it is likely that when she returned home, spring would have arrived. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Neil has just arrived in Iran, he finds it beautiful, and he enjoys the culture and people. This suggests that he wants to stay there for a while. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response: 
If the girl said yes, then it means that she agreed to go on a date with him. This would be option A. Therefore, the answer is (A) The girl said yes to Andrew."
Response:  If Amy was running late, she would have missed her flight if she didn't make it to the gate on time. Therefore, option B (She boarded her flight just in time) is more likely.
Response:  If Ana had been tanning on the beach, it means that she must have spent some time under the sun. This means that she would have gotten a tan, not sunburned. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  If Paul felt brave, it means he had some confidence in himself. Then when the Army rejected him, that must have been a huge blow to his confidence. So option A is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states that ""the cat chased the mouse across the empty warehouse."" This implies that they are inside a building or structure. If the cat is indoors, it is unlikely that it will decide to take a nap outside. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story says Neil ""found"" something about Russia - it doesn't say what exactly. However, based on the context of the story, we can make an educated guess. Since the story mentions ""friendly locals,"" ""colorful and vibrant"" scenery, and a ""great and rich history,"" it seems likely that Neil found the trip interesting or enjoyable. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
Mary enjoyed making candles as a hobby, so option A is more likely. "
Response:  The story states that Gina and her sister are bored, so they decide to watch music videos. This implies that they enjoy each other's company when they do something fun together. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response:  The narrator says they were ""really excited"" about going to the beach, which suggests that they were looking forward to it. They also make sure to pack everything they need, which implies that they are planning to spend some time at the beach. However, when they come out of the dressing room, it starts raining. This could be a disappointment for someone who was looking forward to spending time at the beach. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - their plans were ruined, and they went home."
Response:  We know that Arnold is scared of cats, so it's unlikely that he would love his girlfriend's cats. Therefore, option A is not the most likely outcome. Now let's consider option B. It's possible that Arnold might be uncomfortable around the cat and decide to break up with his girlfriend instead of facing his fear. So, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
Leah applied for the job, got called in for an interview, and did well. This means she has already passed some sort of screening process (either through her resume or cover letter, or perhaps even just being selected from a pool of applicants). So it's more likely that she will actually get the job than be fired. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  The speaker says ""I had to get gifts for my cousins."" This implies that buying presents for others was necessary, not just something the speaker wanted to do. Then, when describing the sale, the speaker uses language like ""Thankfully"" and ""suited me well,"" which suggests that they were happy about finding a good deal. Therefore, the most likely answer is (B) Because I'm a cheapskate it suited me well."
Response:  The story states that Bob was driving from Texas to Florida, which means he has been driving for quite some time already. Then it says he refused to stop at hotels for a break, which implies that he might be feeling tired or exhausted after a long drive. Finally, it says he began to fall asleep, which suggests that his fatigue has reached a critical point. Given these clues, option B (Bob decided to stay at a nearby hotel for the night) seems like the more likely outcome.
Response:  The person in this scenario has just received their concert tickets, driven to Chicago for the show, and is now close enough to see the performer clearly. This would generally be considered an exciting experience, so option A (cheering) seems like the more likely choice.
Response:  Since Maggie hid in her room and called an exterminator, it means she wanted to get rid of the bat. So option B is more likely since it implies that the bat ended up in Maggie's hands after the cat brought it in.
"Response:  The story states that ""it was summer"" and that Jeff's room was ""very hot."" This suggests that the temperature inside the room was quite high, which means that the air conditioner (or fan) was probably running non-stop to keep the room cool. Now, consider what kind of person Jeff is. Is he someone who likes feeling cold or uncomfortable? No! So, option A is more likely. Jeff wants his room to be comfortable and relaxing, not cold and drafty. Therefore, he will choose blinds that allow for some natural light and warmth to enter his room."
"Response: 
Option A says that Joey knew everyone was just teasing him. But why would they be teasing him in the first place if he didn't know what a ""cat's eye"" marble looked like? It doesn't make sense. Therefore, Option B is the more likely answer - Joey got upset and left."
Response:  The situation described in the passage is a school shooting. In this scenario, it would be extremely dangerous for the students to stay in the classroom or even move around. It is much more likely that they would follow the instructions of the teacher and seek cover immediately, such as hiding under their desks or in a nearby room. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Jeffries needs new batteries for his remote, so option A makes sense. Therefore, we can eliminate option B as it has nothing to do with buying batteries or paying bills. Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  The person in this story wants to increase their distance from 20 miles to 30 miles, which means they need to double their current distance. However, if they have been working hard and eating well, it is more likely that they will reach their goal than not. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story starts with ""My family has always loved camping"" which suggests that the speaker is part of a camping-loving family. However, they themselves are not as enthusiastic about it. This could be due to various reasons such as lack of interest or unpleasant experiences in the past.

In the next sentence, the speaker mentions that their car broke down on the way to the campsite, leaving them stranded in the heat for several hours. This adds to the discomfort and frustration level of the trip. Then, the speaker talks about burning their hand while cooking dinner, falling into the lake, and being eaten by bugs. These mishaps make the experience even more unenjoyable.

Considering these details, option B (I decided never to go camping again) seems like the most likely outcome. After facing all those challenges and difficulties, it's reasonable to assume that the speaker might have had enough of camping trips and would prefer to avoid them in the future."
Response:  The student forgot about their assignment after leaving the classroom, which means they did not have any reminders or notes with them at that time. This suggests that they might have been distracted during class or preoccupied with something else entirely. Given this context, option A (I was worried about my grade) seems more plausible than option B (I was sure I would get an A if I didn‚Äôt turn in my essay). After all, why would someone be confident enough to assume they wouldn‚Äôt receive a bad grade when they clearly forgot about their assignment altogether? Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response: 
Sally wants to meet with her boss because she thinks he might be trying to fire her. This means that Option A (Sally hopes to lose her job) is not the best answer, as it goes against what we know about Sally's motivations. Instead, the most likely outcome for Sally is that she hopes her boss will keep her, which aligns with Option B (Sally hopes her boss will keep her). Therefore, the correct answer is Option B."
"Response:  The first sentence of the passage states that ""we decided we would learn to make candy."" This implies that they had no prior experience with making candy before this attempt. Therefore, option A (They found themselves making a mess in the kitchen) is more likely because if they have never tried anything like this before, chances are they will not know what they are doing or how to properly clean up afterward. Option B (They decided to sell their candy to a local boutique) seems unlikely given that they just started learning about making candy and do not yet have any product to sell."
"Response:  The story states that Will was ""very wild"" and didn't listen to his teacher. This suggests that he has some behavioral issues. Now, his father points to the school janitor and tells him that's what he will become if he doesn't start listening. This implies that being a janitor is something undesirable or unpleasant. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - Will wants to be anything but a janitor!"
Response:  The situation described above involves a child who is scared of getting shots at the doctor's office. This could be due to various reasons such as fear of needles or medical procedures, anxiety, or past experiences that may have caused emotional distress. In this scenario, option A is more likely because it makes sense for Emily's parents to reprimand her for hitting the nurse after she received the shot. Reprimanding Emily would help her understand that violence is not an appropriate way to handle her feelings and that there are better ways to express herself when feeling anxious or upset. It also teaches her about boundaries and respect for others. Option B does not make much sense in this context since it implies that Emily's parents would encourage or cheer her on for behaving aggressively towards someone else, which is not a healthy or supportive response.
"Response:  The story states that ""my friends and I"" are playing outside, which means there are multiple people involved in the activity. Then, they decide to play street hockey, which suggests that they have never done this before or at least haven't played together as a group. This implies that their level of experience with the sport is low. Given these factors, option A (We enthusiastically played the game till it got dark) seems more plausible because it aligns better with how beginners might approach a new activity - with excitement and determination to learn and enjoy themselves fully without worrying about time constraints. Option B (We put the gear away and went our separate ways), on the other hand, doesn't quite fit the narrative as it would imply that after trying something new for a short while, they quickly lost interest and abandoned it altogether, which may not be realistic given their initial enthusiasm for trying something new."
Response:  The story states that you tried fixing your mouse at home instead of buying a new one. This means that option A (I was successful) is more likely because you were able to fix your mouse without spending money on a new one. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response: 
The story states Samantha was driving to class when she realized she had forgotten her textbook at home. This means she had already left her house before realizing what she had done, so option A cannot be true as she would not have been the first person to arrive. Therefore, we can eliminate option A from consideration. 
Now let's consider option B: ""It was better for her to be late than to be unprepared."" While this may seem like a good point, it doesn't necessarily follow logically from the situation described in the story. Being late could potentially result in missed opportunities or consequences, such as falling behind in class or facing disciplinary action. It is important to prioritize being prepared and on time for classes in order to succeed academically. In conclusion, based solely on the information provided in the story, option B does not appear to be the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The situation described in the story is one where two people have a collision while skiing, resulting in them falling to the ground. It would be natural for someone who has just been involved in an accident like this to feel embarrassed or nervous, especially if they are a beginner skier. Therefore, option A (I thought Jack was very polite) seems more plausible than option B (I thought Jack was very rude)."
"Response: 
Option A states that Gabe ""decided to purchase a desk."" This implies that he had other options available, including making one himself using materials he already had on hand (like the plywood from his garage). Therefore, Option A is not the most likely answer.

Option B suggests that Gabe ""polished the wood"" after building the desk. While this could be true, it doesn't necessarily follow logically from the fact that he used plywood to build the desk. It's possible that he simply assembled the pieces of plywood without any additional finishing touches. Therefore, Option B is also not the most likely answer."
Response:  Why did Rick's friends want him to go camping? Because they thought it would be fun for all of them! So why do you think Rick agreed to go despite saying he didn't like it? To please his friends! Now, what happened when Rick woke up to find a snake in his tent? He ran away screaming! This means that Rick was terrified of the snake and didn't enjoy having it near him. Therefore, option A (Rick refusing to even think about going camping now) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  If Jerry had decided that it was easier to collect unemployment, he would not have followed through with sending his resume or pursuing the opportunity further. Therefore, option A is unlikely. On the other hand, if the recruiter had set up an interview for Jerry, it means that they were interested in him as a candidate and wanted to move forward with the hiring process. Option B is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states that Emile's friends loved his cooking, which means they appreciated it. This suggests that Emile was successful in his efforts to become a good chef. Therefore, option A (Emile eventually got a job as a chef) is the more likely outcome of this story."
"Response: 
In this situation, Ella forgot to bring forks for eating food during a picnic. This means that there are no utensils available for eating. The family then decides to eat with their hands instead. Now, here comes the interesting part - the story ends with everyone laughing and enjoying themselves despite not having forks. This suggests that the absence of forks didn't cause any major inconvenience or discomfort for them. In fact, it even added some fun and novelty to their meal together. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome - Ella was happy that the picnic wasn't ruined."
Response:  Since it snowed a lot, there is a possibility of hypothermia (Option A). However, since Emily chose to stay inside and read instead of going outside, Option B is more likely. Therefore, we should choose option B as the correct answer.
"Response: 
The sentence ""Joline could not decide what color nail polish she would like"" implies that Joline was indecisive about which color to choose. This means option B, where Joline decides to take the technician's advice, is more likely. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
"Response:  The story states that Harry ""managed to make it all the way through without screaming out loud."" This implies that Harry did not actually enjoy himself during the experience, as he would have been screaming if he had wanted to. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice - Harry wishes he hadn't gone on the adventure."
"Response:  Bobby started taking wrestling classes in high school, then he continued as a member of his college team, and finally, he became a professional wrestler. This progression suggests that Bobby has been involved with wrestling for some time now and enjoys it. Therefore, option A - ""He no longer had any interest in wrestling"" - is unlikely. As Bobby progressed from high school to college to professional wrestling, he gained experience and developed skills, which means he probably still enjoyed wrestling at this stage. Option B - ""He retired early due to injury"" - could also happen, but without additional information, we cannot determine if it applies to Bobby's situation."
"Response: 
Joan got so mad that she left without paying. This means she didn't feel bad about the dinner at all. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Why would Jesse's parents be upset with her for getting a tattoo? It could be because they don't approve of tattoos or because they want their daughter to have a ""clean"" appearance. However, it's also possible that they might be proud of Jesse for making her own decision and expressing herself through art. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
Response:  When Juliette emptied the box of baking soda into a pan, it means that she had some kind of container or dish where she could mix things together. This suggests that she might have been planning on doing something with the baking soda and vinegar, like making a chemical reaction happen. So option A (Juliette built a volcano) seems more likely than option B (Juliette was bored).
Response:  We know that Jaclyn doesn't like Rob, so she might say some mean things to him. Rob tries to stay calm and be friendly despite this. However, since he wants to spend time with his girlfriend, he decides to put up with it for now. Therefore, option A (Rob leaves to hang out with his friends) is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Since Sharon tripped and fell, it is possible that she may have dropped some or all of the eggs when she hit the ground. Therefore, option B (Sharon broke all of the eggs) is more likely than option A (All of the eggs landed safely). So, I would choose option B as the correct answer.
"Response: 
The slave trader found God, which means he repented for his past actions. This is good! However, writing a song about it might not be well-received by everyone. In fact, some people might view him as insincere or trying to profit off of his newfound faith without properly atoning for his past wrongdoings. Therefore, Option A is more likely."
"Response: 
1. Ella went out sledding - this means she was having fun, so it's unlikely that she got hurt. 2. She had fun at first - this suggests that she enjoyed herself before something bad happened. 3. Then she slipped off the sled - this could have caused an injury, but we don't know for sure yet. 4. She cut her forehead on a rock in the ground - this is the most likely cause of any injury, as rocks can be hard and sharp. So option B is more likely."
"Response: 
Steph made some changes to her diet because of her busy schedule. These changes included eating simpler meals and smaller portions. As a result, she lost weight. Now let's consider how Steph might feel about this outcome.  
Option A suggests that Steph's doctor told her she was healthier as well as thinner. This could be true if Steph's weight loss was due to making healthy lifestyle choices rather than just cutting back on portion sizes. However, it's also possible that Steph simply feels relieved or proud of herself for losing weight without trying too hard. After all, changing one's diet can be challenging! Therefore, option A isn't necessarily the only plausible answer here.  
On the other hand, Option B implies that Steph feels like a complete failure despite having successfully lost weight through simple means (i.e., reducing portion sizes). It seems unlikely that someone would feel bad about themselves solely based on their weight loss; instead, they might feel happy with themselves for taking control over their eating habits! Thus, we should choose option A as our best guess at how Steph might feel given these circumstances."
Response:  The story states that Bobby was injured during an important game, which means he cannot play anymore. Option B is the correct answer because it shows Bobby taking time to recover from the injury instead of continuing to play despite being hurt.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage involves a person using their cell phone in a movie theater, which is against the theater's rules. The usher asks the person to leave the theater as a result. This could be considered disruptive or annoying for the person being asked to leave, so option A (Susan was upset with the whole ordeal) is the more likely choice."
Response:  Margie gave the Christmas cactus to Desi, who took good care of it. This means that Desi was taking better care of the plant than Margie did. Therefore, option A is more likely - the cactus flourished under his care.
"Response: 
Gina has just left the park after spending time there with her friend Pam. It is now dark outside, so option A is unlikely as Gina would not go straight to bed without doing anything else. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option B - Gina decides that it isn't late enough and goes back outside."
"Response: 
The story states that Avery's parents came to watch him play, which means they are supportive of their son's interest in basketball. Therefore, option A (Avery's parents were proud) is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The word ""orchid"" means a type of flower that grows in certain climates, usually tropical or subtropical regions. Orchids are known for their unique beauty and variety of colors and shapes. Therefore, option B is more likely - the orchids will be beautiful."
"Response: 
The story states that Bay's boyfriend has been acting weird throughout dinner, which suggests that something is off. It also says that Bay thinks he might dump her, which further supports this idea. Therefore, option B (he starts laughing hysterically) is more likely than option A (asking her to marry him)."
Response:  The story says that Tommy had a bad day, so he must have been feeling sad or upset. Then it says his friends took him out to try to cheer him up. This means they wanted to help him feel better. So, option A is more likely - Tommy had good friends who cared about him and wanted to help him feel better.
Response:  The story states that Ariel is five months old, which means she is still an infant. At this age, babies do not have the ability to understand or communicate about their medical needs, so it is unlikely that they would be able to express any discomfort or pain from a new tooth coming in. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - we had a week of hell as her tooth came in.
Response:  We know that Amelia enjoyed her trip to Mexico. Therefore, option B (Amelia decides to vacation in Mexico more often) is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The story says ""Each Christmas day we found an empty cup and cookie crumbs."" This implies that Santa did indeed visit their house each year, leaving behind evidence of his presence (the empty cup and cookie crumbs). Therefore, option A - ""We told the kids that Santa must have shared with the reindeer"" - is the most likely answer."
Response:  Amy woke up extra hungry, but unfortunately, she also woke up very late. This means that she didn't have enough time to prepare breakfast before leaving for work. When she arrived at work, she found out that her coworker had already brought breakfast for everyone. Now, here are our two options: Option A suggests that Amy was so grateful for her coworker's kind gesture that she promised to pay them back somehow. This could mean that Amy will bring food next time or offer some other form of compensation. Option B, on the other hand, implies that Amy doesn't feel like eating breakfast despite being extremely hungry. Perhaps she's not in the mood for food or maybe she's just too tired to even think about eating. Based on these details, I would say that option A is more likely. Amy is likely to be grateful for her coworker's generosity and make a promise to repay them in some way.
"Response: 
The first sentence states that the school received a grant, which means they got free money from the government. This suggests that option A (the government continuing to fund computer labs) is more likely. 
Therefore, we choose Option A as the correct answer."
Response:  The story states that you are captain of the tennis team, which means you have a leadership role in the sport. It also mentions that you are playing against your division rivals, which suggests this is an important or competitive match. Given these details, it seems unlikely that you would decide to forfeit the game (option A). Instead, you might be motivated to win the match (option B) since you want to lead your team to victory and prove yourself as a capable leader. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome.
"Response:  Ben, as the coach, has to make a difficult decision about cutting someone from the team. This person doesn't meet the requirements or isn't skilled enough, so it's unlikely that they will improve much over time. Therefore, option (B) ""The kid is very proud of himself"" is the most likely outcome. "
Response:  If the officer wanted to avoid hurting anyone, he would not have used the dog in the first place. So option A is unlikely. Now let's consider option B. Officer Dunn might be surprised or upset that his dog bit someone, especially if it was an innocent person like a mother and child. Therefore, option B seems more plausible.
"Response:  The story starts with ""I noticed my hair was getting kind of long."" This implies that the protagonist has been growing their hair out for some time. Then they decide to get a haircut that same day. This suggests that they are motivated to take action quickly without much planning or preparation. Finally, the story states that there wasn't a line at the barbershop and the service was fast. These details suggest that the experience was convenient and efficient. Given these clues, option A is more likely."
"Response:  The story mentions ""bored"" which implies that the person has done something already (riding the motorcycle). So option A is unlikely as it doesn't make sense for someone who just rode their motorcycle to immediately start cleaning it. Option B on the other hand makes more sense as changing the WiFi password would be an action taken after doing something else (like riding the motorcycle) to enhance security. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
"Response: 
Ryan skipped work without permission, which could lead to disciplinary action from his employer. It's possible that he might get reprimanded or even fired for this act of insubordination. Therefore, option A (Ryan gets fired) is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The man drove for many hours, so he was probably tired and wanted to take a break. When he saw the sign for the rest stop, it made sense that he would want to stop there. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  At this point of the story, Josiah has shown interest in the toy when it jingles. This means he wants to get closer to it. So option A is more likely as he will try to reach for the toy. Therefore, we can conclude that Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  The person wants a pet but isn't sure what to get. They see a mini pig on Facebook and decide to go get it. This means they are likely to bring the mini pig home as their new pet. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Sam wanted to be a singer, so he joined a singing class at his college. This means that he wants to improve his singing skills. Now, let's consider what might happen in the class. When everyone was required to sing a song on the first day of class, it's possible that Sam felt embarrassed because he wasn't as good as the others or maybe he just didn't feel comfortable yet. However, since this is a singing class, it's unlikely that his classmates would teach him how to overcome his fear of heights (which has nothing to do with singing). Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Matt has been in love with Lexy for years, but he's too afraid to tell her how he feels. So, he decides to take action and asks her to prom as a way to get closer to her. This shows that Matt is taking steps towards overcoming his fear and being more proactive about expressing his feelings. Therefore, option A (Matt and Lexy had a great time at prom) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  We know that Shyanne passed her spelling test with flying colors, which means she got a high score (100). This is something to be happy about! Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Shyanne was overjoyed.
Response:  If John wanted pizza but was broke, then option A (he had carrots instead) makes more sense since he couldn't afford pizza. Option B (John devoured his pizza) doesn't make much sense in this context as it implies that John already had pizza when he wasn't expecting it, which goes against the original scenario described in the story. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option A: John had carrots instead of pizza.
Response:  The story states that Jill was one of the first people to audition, which means there were other people who auditioned after him. If option A is true, then it means that none of those later auditions resulted in any calls back or recognition, which seems unlikely. On the other hand, if option B is true, then it means that Jill did receive some form of recognition or award for his performances, which does seem possible given the context of the story. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely ending to the story is option B.
Response:  Why did they try to stay up late? Because they wanted to do something that required energy, right? And what did they do to get energy? They drank coffee and ate chocolate! So, it makes sense that after all those efforts, they would be exhausted and collapse on the couch. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) They collapsed on the couch and slept past noon.
"Response: 
Ally has been saving her spare coins in a jar for years, which means she must have been adding small amounts of money to it regularly over time. This suggests that she probably doesn't spend much money on unnecessary things like clothes or other non-essential items. Therefore, option A (Ally using the three hundred dollars to buy clothes) is less likely. 
As for option B (So she bought a new cell phone), it makes sense since Ally mentioned she wanted a new cell phone but didn't have enough money. With over $300 in her change jar, she now has enough money to afford one."
Response:  The story starts off normally enough - Mom asks the protagonist to go get something from the store, and they decide to take their bike instead of walking. This seems like a reasonable decision, especially if it's a longer distance or uphill. Then, the protagonist offers their friend a ride on their bike, which is also a nice gesture. However, things quickly take a turn for the worse when the bike breaks in half while they are riding. Now, here are our two possible endings: Option A suggests that the protagonist realizes that their bike was only meant for one person, implying that they were being selfish or inconsiderate by offering their friend a ride without checking if the bike could handle it. This would be an unexpected twist given the friendly nature of the protagonist's actions so far, and it doesn't really fit with the rest of the story. Option B, on the other hand, is more plausible given what we know about the protagonist's behavior. They casually throw away their used tissue in the gutter, showing a lack of concern for their surroundings or others around them. This carelessness might have contributed to the bike breaking down, which would make sense given the protagonist's thoughtless attitude throughout the story. So based on these factors, option B seems like the most likely ending to the story.
Response:  Why would a family decide to turn around after driving for 9 hours? It doesn't make sense, does it? Of course not! They are excited to see their grandmother and can't wait to see her. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states ""she carried all her clothes to the laundromat."" This implies that Ana has a lot of clothes. It also suggests that she may not have done laundry in a while because she couldn't bear to part with them. Option A seems more plausible here since it aligns better with these details. Ana probably doesn't want to spend too much time away from her clothes, so she might decide to do laundry more frequently instead of waiting until it becomes overdue again."
"Response: 
The story states, ""He (Mark) decided to steal the headphones."" This means that Mark committed an illegal act, which is theft. As a result, he will likely face legal consequences, such as appearing in court. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The speaker says ""I haven't opened it yet."" This implies that they have not started the puzzle yet. Then, they say ""Like right now talking with you."" This means that they are currently engaged in conversation with someone (you). Therefore, option B is the correct answer - the speaker will not start the puzzle immediately after finishing their conversation with you."
"Response:  We know that Rex hasn't cleaned his room for a year, which means it must be quite messy. So when he finally decides to tidy up, it's likely that he will start with the part of the room that is the messiest - the floor. Therefore, option A is unlikely because it says ""Rex loves cleaning the bathroom"", but we have no reason to believe that this is true. On the other hand, option B is more plausible since it states that Rex feels better after tidying up his room, which suggests that he was feeling bad about how dirty and unorganized his space was beforehand."
Response:  The student studied all night for the exam because they were afraid of it being tough. However, skipping dinner may not be the best strategy to prepare for an exam since food is essential for energy and focus. Therefore, option B (the student failed their exam) seems more plausible than option A (the student aced their exam).
"Response: 
The story states that the family was on vacation in Italy, which means they were already far away from their home country Germany (where Munich is located). Therefore, option A is unlikely as there would be no reason for the background of the photo to be in Munich.
So, let's consider option B: ""It was our favorite picture of the vacation."" This makes more sense given the context of the story. The family asked a stranger to take a group photo for them, and since they liked the result so much, it must have been a memorable moment during their trip."
"Response:  The narrator says they ""looked in their closet"" for a shirt, which implies they were getting dressed. Then they find a blue shirt that doesn't smell bad, so they are likely going to wear it. Therefore, the most likely ending is Option B: They wore the blue shirt."
"Response: 
The story says that JJ played all day long, which means he was active and energetic throughout the day. Then, when evening came, he became tired. This suggests that he might have been overtired or exhausted from playing all day. Therefore, option A (He fell asleep) is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
Option A states, ""One hunter yawned and walked away."" This implies that one of the hunters became bored or disinterested in the situation, which doesn't seem very plausible given the excitement of encountering a large deer. Therefore, we can rule out Option A as the correct answer.

Now let's consider Option B: ""It was then that they knew they were in the right spot."" This option suggests that the hunters realized they had found the right location based on the appearance of the deer. Given that the hunters are in the woods for hunting, it makes sense that they would be able to recognize when they have reached their intended destination. So, Option B seems like the more likely choice."
"Response: 
Todd has not studied, it's the night before the test, and it counts for 50% of his grade. This means that if he doesn't prepare, he will probably fail the test. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Todd decides to study as much as he can before tomorrow."
Response:  We know that Maggie needed a new friend, so option A is more likely. Therefore, we choose Option A: Maggie was happy to have a new companion.
"Response: 
The story states that ""we"" rode to work together, which means both the narrator and their roommate were in the car. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Brittany was harassed because of her gender while playing video games online. This means that some players were making derogatory comments or behaving inappropriately towards her due to her gender identity. It also implies that this kind of behavior made Brittany feel uncomfortable and consider quitting gaming altogether.
Now, let's look at option A: ""Eventually, she hated all men."" While it's possible that Brittany may have experienced negative feelings towards men as a result of these experiences, it's not necessarily the only conclusion we can draw from the story. The fact that she found a supportive girl gaming group on Facebook suggests that there are still good and respectful people in the gaming community who value inclusivity and diversity.
On the other hand, option B: ""She felt better playing with a group of nicer people"" is more plausible given the context of the story. Joining a supportive group of girls provided Brittany with a safe space where she could enjoy gaming without fear of harassment or discrimination. So, based on the information provided in the story, option B is the more likely outcome for Brittany."
Response:  The story states that Bobby has never been to a carnival before, which means he doesn't have any prior experience or knowledge of what it will be like. Therefore, option B is more likely because Bobby enjoys the carnival activities.
Response:  The person in the story wanted to know the name of the song they heard on the radio, so they tried typing the lyrics into Google. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
Response:  The story states that Al and Val are very close twins who dress alike, talk alike, and spend all their time together. This suggests they have a strong bond and share many similarities. When Val dies of terminal cancer, it would be natural for Al to feel deeply saddened and lonely without his twin sister by his side. Therefore, option B - Al feels even lonelier as time goes on - is the more likely outcome.
Response:  The speaker has already received three speeding tickets, which means they have been driving too fast. Therefore, option A (wishing they had gotten more tickets) seems unlikely, as it would imply that they want to continue breaking the law. On the other hand, option B (driving at a normal speed) makes sense, as it suggests that the speaker has learned their lesson and is now more careful behind the wheel. So, the most likely answer is option B.
Response:  The story says that David started saving money for his trip to Oregon but didn't have much money at first. This means that David had some goal or desire to go on this trip, even though it was expensive. It also suggests that David may not have been able to afford many luxuries along the way. Therefore, option B (He has a great time in Oregon) seems more likely because it aligns with what we know about David's financial situation. Option A (David learns to play piano) does not seem related to anything mentioned in the passage.
Response:  The girl had braces before, so getting them again will make her unhappy. When she visited the dentist, she found out that she needs braces once more. This means she will be in pain during the process. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it suggests that the outcome of getting braces again will be positive for her.
"Response: 
The story states that Jayne helped care for the animals on her uncle's farm in Alden, New York. This means that she was involved in taking care of living creatures. Therefore, option A is more likely because it suggests that Jayne enjoyed eating food produced through her hard work. It makes sense that after helping with animal care, she would enjoy consuming their produce. Option B does not align with this logic as setting fire to the garden would result in destruction rather than providing sustenance."
"Response: 
Seth has been working at the air conditioning factory for six years, so he must have some experience there. However, his supervisor just announced that the factory will be shutting down, which means that Seth will lose his job. Given this situation, option A (Seth thinking he can find a job at the air conditioning factory) seems unlikely because there won't be any jobs available at the factory anymore. Therefore, the correct answer is option B (Seth thinking it is a good idea to update his resume)."
Response:  If the fuel pump is broken, it means that Amy cannot drive the car. Therefore, she will not be able to drive to school. So, option B is the correct answer - Amy had to walk to school.
Response:  The story states that Rod smokes throughout his whole life, which means he has been exposed to secondhand smoke for years. This could have caused health problems such as lung cancer or heart disease. Now, when he falls asleep while watching TV with an unattended cigarette, it catches the apartment on fire. If Option A were true, then Rod would indeed die from the fire. However, since this is not the case, we can assume that Rod survived the fire but may suffer serious injuries or long-term health effects due to the exposure to smoke. Therefore, option B is more likely.
Response:  Barry walked into the building, which means he entered the voting booth. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states ""he had to put on the donut"" which means he didn't have a spare tire, so option A is not possible as he would not be happy about having a flat tire. Therefore, the only logical answer is (B) They fixed it and Johnny drove home."
"Response: 
Step 1: Amy wants more space in her current home. 
Step 2: Amy decides to find a new apartment. 
Step 3: Amy visits the new apartment to check its condition. 
Based on these steps, option B (Amy signs a lease and moves into the apartment) is the most likely outcome because she has already taken the first two steps towards finding a new place to live. Therefore, it makes sense that she would sign a lease and move into the apartment after visiting it. Option A (She moves into a smaller, cheaper apartment) does not align with the information provided in the story as there is no mention of Amy looking for a smaller or cheaper apartment."
"Response: 
If there was only one slice of pizza left, then my brothers and I are all hungry for it. This means that we will fight for it. So option A (I got to eat the slice) is more likely. "
"Response: 
Cathy adopted May after falling in love with her at the pet store. This means that they got along well enough for Cathy to decide to take May home. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Monica loves to knit scarves, so she has some experience with it. Also, she doesn't have enough money to buy a gift for her friend's birthday. This means that Monica is unlikely to make a gift for someone else to donate to an orphanage. Instead, she would want to give something personal and meaningful to her friend as a present. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  If the suspect saw that the cell door was unlocked, then no one was watching him when he pushed on it and it opened. This means that he could have easily escaped without being noticed. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The story says ""their parents don't get along"". This means there may be some conflict or tension between them. It also means that the boy and girl might not want to tell their parents about their relationship because of this tension. 
Now let's consider option A: ""But eventually they get together anyway."" This ending implies that despite the challenges and obstacles, the couple decides to pursue their relationship anyways. However, it doesn't take into account the fact that the parents may still have issues with their children dating each other, even if the couple wants to be together. In many cases, parents can be quite protective of their children and may not easily accept someone from another family as their partner. So, it's unlikely that the parents would just accept the relationship without any resistance or conditions. Therefore, option A is less likely to happen in real life scenarios. 
On the other hand, option B: ""The boy and girl's parents are very happy they love each other"" seems more plausible. This ending suggests that despite the initial reluctance or opposition from the parents, they eventually come around and accept the relationship once they see how much the boy and girl care for each other. This could happen if the couple is able to show their parents how much they mean to each other and how important their relationship is to both of them. With time and effort, the parents may become more accepting and supportive of the relationship. This outcome is more likely to occur in real-life situations where families value love and relationships above all else."
Response:  The story says that the speaker waited in line for hours to see the president, which suggests they were excited about it. Then, when they got close enough to shake hands with the president, their excitement would only increase. Therefore, option A (I was thrilled) is the more likely answer.
"Response:  We know from the text that Jake went to his first football game with his dad, which means he probably enjoyed himself (otherwise why would they go in the first place). Also, we are told they had ""really good"" seats, indicating that it was an enjoyable experience for them both. Finally, since Jake even got to see his favorite player during the game, it seems unlikely that he didn't have any fun whatsoever. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  The person in this story wants to do something fun that is also cheap, so they look for a local lake beach to visit. This suggests that they are not planning on traveling far or spending much money. Option A does not fit with this context because driving to the beach would require gasoline and could be expensive depending on how far away it is. Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response: 
If Amy started going to school at the coffee shop (option A), then that would mean she was attending classes from a different location than the traditional classroom. This doesn't make sense as schools are designed to provide structured learning environments where students can interact with teachers and peers face-to-face. Additionally, many schools have rules against using electronic devices during class time, so it's unlikely that Amy could be writing her paper on her laptop while sitting in a coffee shop.
On the other hand, if Amy got an A on the paper but in trouble for skipping class (option B), then it's possible that the teacher may have been lenient or understanding about the situation. However, it's also possible that Amy might have faced consequences such as detention or missed work assignments due to missing class without permission. Without more information, it's difficult to say which outcome is most likely."
"Response: 
Option A states that Steve's wife was ""ecstatic"" about the gift. This means she was very happy and appreciative of the present. It's unlikely that she would file for divorce immediately after receiving such a thoughtful gift from her husband. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  The man's girlfriend's father breaks a mirror, then slams his hand in a car door, and finally hits a deer while rushing to the hospital. It seems like an unfortunate series of events, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he has bad luck. Accidents can happen to anyone at any time, regardless of their fortunes or misfortunes. Therefore, option A is not the most likely choice.  
Now let's analyze option B: ""As if his luck couldn't get any worse, the hospital was closed."" This ending suggests that the man's misfortune continues to escalate, with each event building upon the last. However, without additional context, it's impossible to determine whether this is indeed the case. Perhaps the hospital was closed due to a holiday or some other reason unrelated to the man's bad luck. In conclusion, neither option provides sufficient evidence to support the claim that the man has bad luck."
Response:  The story states that Jon feels guilty for missing his kids and being tired and grumpy on the weekends. This suggests that he values spending time with them and wants to be more present in their lives. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Jon will love spending time with the kids.
"Response:  The story starts with ""Ben walked along the street."" This implies that he was walking in a specific direction, probably towards his destination. Then, he finds the end of a length of string. This suggests that there might be more string somewhere else, perhaps attached to an object or person. So, option B is the most likely answer - Ben went to follow the string to see where it led. Option A does not make sense as there is no indication that Ben was interested in the string itself."
Response:  The story states that Juan watched luchadors on TV, practiced daily, and eventually got added to small shows. This suggests that his passion for lucha libre did not fade away easily. In fact, it seems like he pursued this dream with dedication and perseverance. Therefore, option B (Juan was very successful eventually) is more likely.
"Response: 
Tori found out she was pregnant on a Sunday. So, it must be evening or nighttime when she calls her husband with the news. Why would Tori call her husband if she was upset about something? It makes more sense that they are both happy and excitedly discussing their future child together. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  If the bakery had closed, it means that Sara would no longer be able to satisfy her cravings for sweet treats like bread, pastries, or cakes. However, if an organic juice shop opened up nearby, it suggests that the area now offers more health-conscious options for people looking for fresh produce and natural drinks. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Sara may have been disappointed that the bakery closed but happy about the new juice shop opening nearby.
"Response: 
Rufus meets Ralph in his Chemistry class. This means that Ralph is also in the same school as Rufus. Therefore, it is more likely for them to become lab partners than for Rufus to find another friend in a different class like Geometry. So, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Tom wanted a Chemistry set for Christmas, which suggests that he finds chemistry interesting or fun. Therefore, option A (He was happy to get the Chemistry set) is the more likely answer."
Response:  The story states that the hummingbirds come early every morning, so it is unlikely that Option A would happen because there are no other birds around for the hummingbird to be eaten by. Also, since the hummingbirds come early every morning, it means that this scene takes place during daylight hours when there is plenty of light for us to see what is happening. Therefore, Option B (I shot the rat and tossed the body into the garbage) is not possible either because there is no mention of any rats or trash cans near the location where the hummingbirds visit. So, we can conclude that neither option is likely to occur in this scenario.
"Response: 
Option A states that ""Lo figured the math problem."" This implies that Lo used her mathematical skills to solve some kind of challenge or obstacle related to finding the hoops for Io's costume. However, there is no information provided about how this would help Io obtain the hoops she needs. Therefore, Option A is unlikely.

Now let's consider Option B: ""Lo had the best costume in the play."" This option suggests that Lo's mother successfully made the hoop skirt for Io's costume, which means that Io did not have any difficulty finding the hoops she needed. This is a more plausible outcome given the context of the story. Therefore, we can conclude that Option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response:  The story starts with ""My manager was wearing a Beatles t-shirt"". This already suggests that they share an interest in music, specifically the Beatles. Then, you mention that you two become good friends. This further strengthens the bond between you two over your shared passion for music. Now, consider option A - starting a small band together. While it's possible that two people with similar interests could come together and form a band, it's not very likely, especially considering that you just started working together. Option B, where your manager tells you he doesn't like the Beatles, seems more plausible given the context of the story. It would be unusual for someone to wear a Beatles t-shirt if they don't actually like the band. Therefore, I would choose option B as the most likely outcome."
Response:  We know that Tyler went to a baseball game, which means he was excited about it. Since his team played well and won, this further increases his excitement. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Tyler was elated after watching the game.
"Response: 
The story states that Flora hates the dentist, which means option A (She was excited because she loved going to the dentist) is unlikely. Therefore, we can eliminate this option. 
Now let's consider option B (The dentist was able to make her tooth feel better). This option seems more plausible since the story mentions that Flora's tooth started hurting and then got worse over time, indicating that something needed to be done to address the problem. Additionally, the fact that Flora had to call for an appointment suggests that she may have been avoiding the issue until it became too severe to handle on her own. So, based on these clues, option B seems like the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
If Derek got a library card, he could borrow books from the library for free. This means that he would be able to read more books without spending any money. So, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states ""None of us bought anything."" This means that no one paid for drinks or food. Since none of us had any money, it's unlikely that the bar would have asked us to leave. Therefore, option A is not the most likely outcome.
Now let's consider option B: ""After that we all decided to go to a restaurant."" This seems like a reasonable conclusion since we mentioned earlier that we didn't buy anything at the bar. So it makes sense that we would want to go somewhere else where we can actually eat and spend money. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
If you were at the laundromat, it means you are in a public place where people come and go. It's unlikely that she would remember you or be interested in talking to you again after one brief encounter. So option A is more realistic. "
Response:  If Pat had already called in sick, then how could work have been cancelled due to snowfall? That doesn't make sense! Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Pat felt silly for pretending to be sick.
Response:  The story states that Greg was riding his bike when someone emerged from an alleyway and pushed him to the ground, taking his bike in the process. This suggests that the incident occurred suddenly and without warning. Therefore, option A (Greg filed a police report and they eventually caught the thief) is less likely, as it implies that Greg had time to stop and report the crime afterward. Instead, option B (Greg judged the chili cook-off competition) seems more plausible, as this activity would be something Greg might do while trying to move on from the unexpected attack.
"Response: 
The story states that Johnson doesn't like being outside very much. This means that option A (he had a miserable weekend) is more likely because he would not enjoy himself in this situation. Option B contradicts the information given earlier about Johnson's preferences. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Jim lost his wallet containing hundreds of dollars. This means he will not be able to buy food or pay bills until next month. Now consider Pete finding this wallet. If Pete were to keep the wallet and its contents, he could use the money to buy something he wants like a new TV. However, if Pete decides to do the right thing and returns the wallet to Jim, then Jim can use the money to feed his family and pay their bills on time. Therefore, option A (Pete keeps the wallet and donates the money to charity) is the most likely ending to the story.
"Response: 
The story states, ""One day she (Mary) told her sister (Sally) she felt insecure."" This implies that Sally has insecurities about something. Then it says, ""Mary laughed her off and told her that she had many strengths too."" This suggests that Mary tried to make Sally feel better by pointing out her positive qualities. So option B is the correct answer - Sally felt better after talking with her sister."
"Response:  The story states that the boy ""split his eyebrow open."" This means that he may have required medical attention but did not die. Option B is therefore more likely than option A."
"Response: 
The story states that Little Lorelei is eight months old and teething. This means that she is still learning how to communicate through language but can understand some basic concepts like gestures and facial expressions. Therefore, it is unlikely that she will choose option B (flowers) as she may not be able to associate the gesture of choosing flowers with the concept of soothing herself. 
Now let's consider Option A (teething biscuit). Teething biscuits are designed specifically for babies who are teething, and they often contain ingredients such as chamomile or other natural remedies that can help calm a fussy baby. It makes sense that giving Lorelei a teething biscuit could potentially calm her down since it addresses her specific need at that moment. So, based on the information provided in the story, Option A seems more plausible than Option B."
Response:  Why did you decide to throw bread to the ducks? Because they were nearby, right? So, option B makes more sense - you ran away from the ducks because they got angry with you for throwing bread near their home. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) You ran away from the ducks.
Response:  Graham wanted to take a selfie, so he bought a selfie stick. But then he stopped using it after just a few times. This suggests that he wasn't very interested in using it regularly. Therefore, option B (Eventually he threw it away) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Why did all the people except Lewis run away when they saw the bats? Because they were scared of them! Now, why would Lewis, who knows the cave like the back of his hand, be afraid of the bats? He probably isn't. So, option B is more likely: Lewis laughed and told them not to be afraid of the bats.
"Response:  We know that Sean and Sara are planning to buy a guitar together. They go to the store, play around with some guitars, and then bring their chosen one to the counter. Now, let's consider each option separately: Option A: ""Sara made the purchase enthusiastically."" This means that after trying out different guitars, Sara decides she likes one of them very much and wants to buy it. However, we don't have any information about how Sean feels about this decision. It's possible that he might be happy for her or even want to learn how to play himself, but without more context, we can't say for sure. So, this option seems unlikely. Option B: ""Sara decided to buy a Viola instead."" This option makes more sense given what we know so far. Since Sean picked Sara up and took her to the store, it's likely that he was involved in the decision-making process as well. If Sara suddenly changes her mind and decides to buy something else entirely (like a Viola), it could be seen as an unexpected twist. Plus, since Sean didn't explicitly object to Sara buying a Viola, it's possible that he might be interested in learning how to play it too. Overall, while neither option can be ruled out completely, Option B seems more plausible based on the available details."
"Response:  The story states, ""When Chris went to bed on Thursday he was worried."" This implies that Chris was feeling anxious about the test. Now consider the second part of the sentence, ""When he woke up Friday morning almost a foot of snow had fallen!"" This suggests that something unexpected happened overnight - lots of snow fell. Given this information, it seems unlikely that Chris would feel relieved when he wakes up (option B). Instead, given his initial worry about the test, it makes more sense that he would be excited or happy about the snow (option A). So, the correct answer is option A: Bill started to get ready for school."
"Response: 
The story states that Martha was a terrible cook initially. This means that her starting point was very low. Then, her boyfriend helped her learn new skills through cooking shows. This implies that he provided guidance and support. Finally, the story mentions that her cooking started to improve gradually over time. This suggests that Martha made progress as she continued learning and practicing.
Based on this information, option B is the most likely outcome of the story: ""After a while, everything Martha cooked was delicious."" It makes sense that with consistent effort and improvement, Martha could eventually become proficient in cooking and produce tasty dishes. Option A does not align with the narrative as there is no mention of Martha becoming skilled at sewing or any other craft unrelated to cooking."
"Response: 
The story states that Tokyo got very sick ""out of nowhere."" This suggests that there was no previous indication of illness beforehand, which means it was unlikely that both cats were already unhealthy. Therefore, option A (Both cats were very healthy) is not the most likely answer.
Next, we know that Tokyo got sick unexpectedly, but then we are told that he recovered after being taken to the vet. This implies that he did receive medical attention, which supports option B (I took him to the vet to treat him and he got better). So, the most likely ending to the story is option B."
Response:  If the office staff complained that the carpet was always dirty, but none of their vacuums could properly clean it, then it means that the carpet was very difficult to clean. Now, if they hired a professional carpet cleaner, it's possible that they used specialized equipment or techniques that were able to effectively remove the dirt from the carpet. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - the carpet will look almost new after being cleaned by a professional.
Response:  Lexi wants to be healthy, but then she decides not to add any sugar because it makes the hot chocolate taste bland. This means that she values her health more than the taste of the hot chocolate. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  If Anna wanted chicken wings, it makes sense that she would want them from a place known for serving good quality wings - like Buffalo! So option A is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states that ""my brother kept fighting me for the remote."" This implies that there was some kind of conflict or disagreement over control of the remote. Then, the narrator suggests dividing its use between them. So option B is more likely because it shows that the narrator agreed to let their brother use the remote first."
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage is dangerous - the plane has a rudder problem and is going down. Therefore, option A is more likely. "
"Response: 
Joey likes to color in coloring books, but he has worn down most of his crayons so he only has brown and black left. This means that all of his artwork will have a limited color palette, which could be seen as a challenge or constraint for an artist. However, instead of being discouraged by this limitation, Joey's parents view his artwork with pride and hang it up on the fridge for everyone to see. This suggests that they appreciate Joey's creativity and talent despite the limitations of his materials. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome - Joey feels proud of himself."
"Response: 
Option A states that John brought bagels to work. While this might provide some temporary comfort or energy boost, it doesn't address his main issue - feeling unprepared for the presentation. Therefore, option A is unlikely. 
On the other hand, option B suggests that John reworked the presentation, which aligns with his goal of being better prepared. Since preparation is crucial for any successful presentation, option B seems more plausible."
Response:  The story states that Fred played the lottery and did not win yesterday. This means that his chances of winning today are still zero. Therefore, option A (Fred didn't win the lottery) is the most likely outcome.
Response:  If Gina wanted to steal all the soap from the bathroom, she would have taken it without hesitation when she first noticed there wasn't any. However, since she didn't take any soap, we can assume she didn't want to steal it. Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response:  We know from the context of the story that ""Mother"" has just rung a bell to signal that it's time to eat. This means that she wants her husband (Dad) and son (Bill) to come inside and join her for dinner. Therefore, option B is the more likely ending to the story - the family will sit down and enjoy a meal together."
Response:  The story states that there are two kittens in a cage together. This means they are siblings or at least close friends. If Emmy cannot bear to choose between them, it is unlikely that she will be able to keep both of them. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  We know that Jill went to college, studied hard, and passed all her tests. This means she earned her degree! Now, what might happen next? Well, it's likely that Jill will find a good job using her new skills and knowledge. So, option A is the most likely outcome. Therefore, we choose Option A as the correct answer.
"Response: 
Jerry has become a ""reasonably good"" guitar player after taking lessons for some time. This means he has learned enough skills to be able to play his instrument decently well. Now, let's consider what might happen next.  Option A suggests that Jerry will play his guitar for his friends. This could mean he will perform at a party or gathering, or simply show off his skills to those around him. While it's possible that Jerry may choose to share his music with others, it's also possible that he may not feel comfortable doing so, especially if he's never played in front of an audience before.  On the other hand, Option B implies that Jerry will throw his guitar in the trash. This seems unlikely given the progress he has made learning how to play. It's possible that Jerry may get frustrated with himself for not being as skilled as he would like, but throwing away his guitar doesn't seem like a realistic outcome based on the information provided in the story. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option A - Jerry decides to play his guitar for his friends."
"Response:  The text states that Kyle collects ""action figures"". This implies that Kyle likes superheroes, as action figures are often associated with them. Therefore, option A (Kyle was really into Marvel heroes) is more likely."
Response:  The story is about Francine wanting to wear flat shoes instead of high heels because they are more comfortable. Her friends complement her on how great they look. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it reflects what happened in the story.
"Response:  The story says that the person ""loved hiding and sneaking"" as a child, which means they enjoyed playing this game. Then, it states that they would ""just hide and jump out at people."" This implies that their actions caused surprise or fright for those around them. Therefore, option B is more likely - people were not happy with the person's behavior while they were playing this game."
"Response: 
Rachel received an unfamiliar letter, which means she doesn't speak the language of that letter. So, option B is more likely - taking it to a language professor for translation."
Response:  Since Deb got fired, it means that she doesn't have a job anymore. So option A is not possible since she wouldn't go back to the same job she just lost. Therefore, the only possible answer is Option B - She got the job.
"Response:  Bethany had been feeling self-conscious about her arm hair, so she decided to try shaving it off. However, this didn't work out as planned because the hair grew back within just a few weeks. Feeling frustrated with her lack of progress, Bethany then opted for a more permanent solution - laser hair removal treatment. Now, let's consider each option carefully: Option A: ""She wished it would grow back."" This option suggests that Bethany may have regretted getting rid of her arm hair, wishing instead that it could return. While it's possible that Bethany might feel this way, it doesn't align with what we know about her character or situation. Given how much time and effort she put into removing her unwanted body hair in the first place, it seems unlikely that she would now want it back. Option B: ""She felt better about herself."" This option makes more sense given everything we know about Bethany's situation. By choosing this answer, we can infer that after undergoing laser hair removal treatment successfully removed all of her unwanted arm hair, Bethany finally feels confident enough about her appearance again! So there you have it; based on available information alone (i.e., without any additional context), option two appears far likelier than one when considering how things played out for our protagonist throughout these events unfolded over several weeks/months rather than days)."
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to consider that Gina is a minor (a child) who cannot walk or travel alone for long distances without proper supervision. Therefore, option A - ""Gina got out, and walked back home"" - is not feasible as she would be putting herself in danger of getting lost, injured, or abducted. 
On the other hand, since traffic was slow and Gina was uncomfortable, option B - ""Gina closed her eyes and did her best to go to sleep"" - seems like a more plausible choice. Children often find ways to cope with discomfort during car rides by daydreaming, listening to music, or even falling asleep. So, based on these factors, I would choose option B as the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The old pastor walked over from next door. This suggests that he lives nearby, which means he might be friendly or interested in getting to know us better. So option A (he buys lemonade and makes us feel welcome) seems more likely."
"Response:  We know that Bob moved from a small town to a large city, which means he might not be familiar with the new place. Moreover, he expressed concern about getting lost. This suggests that he might have difficulty navigating through the city without any prior knowledge or experience. Therefore, option B - ""The navigation system helped Bob a lot"" - is more likely."
Response:  The story states that Kelly read about hybrid animals online, which means she learned about them through a digital source. Therefore, option A is more likely because it suggests that Kelly has only seen the ligers in a zoo setting, which aligns with how she learned about them.
"Response: 
The story states that Jorie went on a trip with her family to visit Anne Frank's house, which suggests they are all together. Option A does not make sense because if Jorie felt emotionally affected during the tour, she would have mentioned something like ""I couldn't stop crying during the tour."" Instead, she simply says ""it was a very emotional tour,"" which could mean anything. Therefore, option A is unlikely. 
Now let's consider option B: ""They decided to visit the comedy club upstairs."" This option makes no sense whatsoever given the context of the story. The Frank family did not run a comedy club, nor were there any comedians performing at their home. It is highly unlikely that after visiting such an important historical site, Jorie's family would suddenly decide to go to a comedy club instead. Therefore, option B is also unlikely."
"Response: 
Option A states, ""Clara liked being outside."" This does not make sense in this context because Clara was just locked out of her house and needed someone to let her inside. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  The person in this scenario is cleaning up their apartment, which means they are getting organized and decluttered. They find an old letter underneath some other things that says their girlfriend wants to break up with them. This would likely be upsetting news for anyone, so option A (angry and confused) seems like the more likely response.
"Response: 
Ben had an affair, which means he broke the trust and commitment he made with his wife. This can lead to serious consequences in any relationship, including divorce. Therefore, option B (his wife finds out and they get a divorce) is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The man in the story betted that he can outstare a duck. This means that he will look directly at the duck without looking away for as long as possible. Now, let's consider how long a person can stare at something before they start feeling uncomfortable or blinking. Generally, humans can stare at an object for around 10-30 seconds before their eyes start to feel strained and they need to blink. However, if someone were to stare at a stationary object like a duck for an extended period of time, they might be able to go longer than this average duration. So, option A (the man eventually blinked) seems more plausible here since it aligns with our understanding of human eye behavior and the length of time one can sustainably stare at an object."
Response:  We know that Shay paid money for the experience, so we can assume that she wanted to have fun. Therefore, option A (Shay had a great time) is more likely.
Response:  We know that Lia went to England, which means she must have enjoyed her trip there. Therefore, option A is unlikely. Now let's consider option B. Since Lia took a bus tour, it's possible that she didn't want to get off the bus or explore on her own. However, since she did get off the bus to look at Stonehenge, we can infer that she was interested in seeing this famous landmark. So, option B is more likely.
Response:  The story states that you were drinking a glass of juice, which means you are in your kitchen or near it. Then, the story says that your cup spilled on the counter, indicating that there may be liquid on the surface. Finally, the story mentions finding a pack of paper towels, which suggests that you want to clean up the spill. Therefore, option A (You moped up the mess) is more likely than option B (You left the mess and made a sandwich).
Response:  The situation is that there are no more beers left, and Arthur doesn't want to take the last one. This means he has two choices: either he can take it anyway (Option A) or order another round for his friends (Option B). Now, let's consider each option separately: Option A: If Arthur chooses to take the last beer anyway, it might make him look selfish or inconsiderate towards his friends. He could have easily asked them if they wanted some before taking the whole thing himself. On the other hand, ordering another round would show that he cares about his friends' preferences and wants everyone to enjoy themselves. Therefore, based on these factors, I believe Option B is the most likely choice for Arthur.
"Response: 
The story states that Hester loves how her hair looks straight, so option A (she is proud of her appearance) seems more plausible than option B (she shaved her head). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
Response:  Why would Jill be excited about buying a new car? She wants something better than what she has now, which means she will be happy with the outcome. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Jaden forgot about Valentine's Day and bought gifts at the last minute. His girlfriend comes home and finds them. What could happen next?  
Option A: She could be angry with him for forgetting and for buying cheap or thoughtless gifts. This would make sense because she might feel disrespected or unappreciated if her partner didn't put any effort into celebrating their special day together.  
Option B: She could be surprised and happy to see the gifts, especially if they are thoughtful and personalized. This would also make sense since people generally appreciate gestures of love and appreciation on Valentine's Day.  
Based on these possibilities, option B seems more likely than option A."
Response:  John got a bike as a gift on his birthday. This means that he did not have a bike beforehand, so he must have been learning how to ride it. Now, if he had never ridden a bike before, then option A makes more sense - he would be able to ride it without any trouble since he has no prior experience with it. However, if he had some previous experience or knowledge about biking, then option B might be more plausible - maybe he learned enough in one week to realize that biking wasn't for him after all. So, based on this reasoning, I would choose option A as the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
Quentin has never been on a boat before, so it makes sense that this would be a new experience for him. He goes sailing with his friend, which means he is trying something new and potentially challenging. The story does not provide any information about how well Quentin handled himself during the sailing trip or whether he enjoyed it. Therefore, option B - Quentin vows to never go sailing again - seems like the more plausible choice because it suggests that Quentin may have found the experience unpleasant or difficult. Option A - Quentin is glad he went - does not provide enough context to determine how Quentin felt about the experience."
"Response: 
The man complains about the pancakes being too thick, so the server brings them back to the cook. Now, it's up to the cook to decide what action to take next. Since the man has already been served his food, it's unlikely that the cook will simply praise him for bringing back the pancakes. Instead, the cook will probably decide to remake the pancakes to meet the customer's request. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states ""Upon arriving at the animal shelter, my children wanted to get a pet."" This implies that they were interested in getting a pet from the start. Then it says ""We decided that this was a great idea"". This suggests that the decision to adopt an animal was made as a family. Finally, it mentions meeting a black lab who they all immediately liked. Given these clues, option B (we adopted the black lab) seems like the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that your plants were ""wilting and dry"" from the sun. This means they were already in a state of distress before your friend arrived. If you had simply watered them without evaluating the cause of their decline, it is unlikely that they would have recovered significantly. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Why did Jill throw her game controller at the TV? Because she was angry about losing every game! Now, what happened after Jill threw the controller? The TV screen cracked! So, option B is the most likely outcome - Jill got better at video games.
"Response:  The person started watching ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and then felt like running. However, since it was already dark outside, they couldn't actually go running. So option B is more likely - they imagined themselves as Buffy and ran in their mind."
Response:  At 12 years old, Drew decides to become a criminal. This means he has chosen to break the law. Therefore, option A (Drew always wants to obey the law) is not possible. Now let's consider option B (His mother was very angry). It makes sense that if Drew broke into several closets without permission, his mother might be upset or even angry with him for breaking her belongings. So, option B seems more plausible.
Response:  If you had been having trouble with your hard-boiled eggs coming out bad, then trying something new like baking them might be an improvement. So option A is more likely. However, leaving the shell on and eating them whole is not a common or safe way to eat hard-boiled eggs, so option B is less likely. Therefore, the answer is (A) The baked eggs were great.
"Response: 
The boy sees a quarter lying on the ground and bends over to pick it up. This action puts him in a vulnerable position, as evidenced by the fact that a spitball flies near his head. His archenemy then appears with a straw, indicating that they have a history of conflict. Given these circumstances, option B (the boy is angry) seems more likely than option A (he is grateful)."
"Response: 
The story states that Hector notices that only one ear of his headphones works, which means he has been using them with only one working ear for some time. This suggests that he has grown accustomed to it and may have even forgotten about the issue. Therefore, option A (Hector decides he doesn't like music) is less likely as he has already become comfortable with the situation.
On the other hand, option B (Hector is happy that both ears work) makes more sense as it aligns with the fact that Hector wanted to buy a new pair of headphones in the first place. Now that he has found a good pair that works properly, he should be satisfied with the improvement."
"Response:  The story states ""He ended up sitting in the upper deck."" This implies that Tom sat in a high-up section of the stadium where the view may not be as good as lower sections. Therefore, option A is more likely - Tom did not enjoy the game as much as he had hoped due to his poor seat location."
"Response: 
The statement ""He would eat at least one a day"" implies that Trip has been consistently consuming watermelon for some time. This suggests that it is unlikely that he will stop eating it altogether, as he has become accustomed to its taste and may enjoy it regularly. Therefore, option B is less likely.

Now let's consider option A: ""Trip enjoyed the flavor of the seeds."" While this could be true, there is no explicit evidence in the passage to support this claim. The text only mentions that Trip's mother said he would grow a tree swallowing seeds if he kept eating them, without providing any insight into Trip's personal preferences. So, we cannot assume with certainty that Trip enjoys the flavor of the seeds.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the most likely outcome is that Trip continues to eat watermelon regularly (option A)."
"Response: 
Option A states ""Angie decided to tell the requester to reject more of her work."" This implies that Angie wants to punish the requester for rejecting her work. However, this approach may not be productive or professional. It could damage their relationship and make it harder for Angie to get future requests from them.
On the other hand, Option B states ""Angie tried to discuss the issue in detail."" This shows a willingness to understand the reason behind the rejection and find a solution. By being open and transparent about the issue, Angie can learn from her mistake and improve her quality of work in the future. Therefore, the most likely outcome is Option B."
"Response: 
Trina likes Donovan, so she says yes when he asks her out. This means that she wants to go on a date with him. However, she is also worried about it. She runs home to ask her father for help because she doesn't know what to do. Her father smiles when he comes home, which suggests that he is happy or pleased about something. Based on this information, the most likely ending to the story is Option B: Trina's dad teaches her how to dance. It makes sense that Trina would want her father's advice or guidance on how to handle the situation, especially since she is nervous about going on a date with Donovan."
"Response: 
Andy has never rode a bike before, so option (A) is unlikely because crying for hours would be an overreaction since he doesn't know how to use the bike yet. Option (B), on the other hand, makes more sense as it shows that Andy's father is willing and able to teach him how to ride the bike, which could help Andy learn how to use it properly. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
Response:  The man smiled at Suzy when she tried to pay for her milkshake. This means he was happy or friendly towards her. It is unlikely that he would then tell her that she owes him money (option A). Instead, it is more likely that he will give her the milkshake for free as a prize or reward (option B). Therefore, we can conclude that option B is the most likely outcome in this scenario.
"Response: 
The story states that Ned spent all of his money on cotton candy. This means he has none left to give to the little boy. Therefore, option A (So Ned gave him his own cotton candy) is not possible as he doesn't have any to spare. The only option left is option B: He bought more cotton candy for the boy."
Response:  We know from the text that Sebastian noticed it was sunny and warm outside, which suggests he might want to go outside instead of staying indoors. However, we also see that he doesn't feel like doing his chores, which could mean he might not necessarily want to be outside either. So, option B seems more likely - Sebastian walked outdoors and went for a walk.
"Response: 
Rashid's brother was late for work because he overslept or something like that. So when Rashid offers to drive him, it means he is doing a favor to his brother. Now, if Rashid's brother were angry at him, he would probably scold him or show some sign of annoyance. But since Rashid arrived on time with his brother, it means they had enough time to get there before work starts. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
If we assume that the cashier did steal Ali's information (option A), then it would mean that the cashier committed fraud. However, there is no indication in the story that this happened. In fact, the story states that the bank reversed the charges, which suggests that they investigated and determined that the transactions were unauthorized. Therefore, option A is unlikely. 
On the other hand, if we choose option B, it means that Ali decided to show appreciation for the fast food cashier's work. This is a reasonable assumption given that the story does not provide any evidence to suggest otherwise. So, option B is more likely."
Response:  If you were looking for a nice painting, then you would want to find something that you like. Therefore option B (you bought the painting) is more likely.
"Response:  The story states that the person ""worked very hard"" all year. This suggests that they were diligent in their efforts. Additionally, the fact that their boss called them into the office implies that their work had not gone unnoticed. Given these factors, it seems more likely that option B (the person received the promotion) is the correct answer."
Response:  We are given that Maggie is moving to a new town with her parents. This means that she will be leaving behind familiar surroundings and people she knows. It is natural for someone in this situation to feel nervous or anxious about meeting new people and settling into an unfamiliar environment. Therefore, option A (Maggie was sad and lonely) is the more likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states, ""Dan was walking home from school."" This means it is after school hours. Then we are told, ""There was a train set in the window of the store."" This implies that the store is open at this time. Finally, we learn that Dan wishes he could have the train set but then his mother tells him she has a surprise. Option A does not make sense because if Dan's mother already gave him the train set, there would be no surprise left to tell him about later on. Therefore, option B is more likely as it aligns better with the information provided in the passage."
"Response: 
Step 1: Gina wants to steal her mother's house key while her mother is napping. This indicates that Gina intends to use the key without her mother's knowledge or consent, which suggests dishonesty and disrespect for her mother's property.
Step 2: Gina takes her mother's purse to the bathroom and removes the key from the chain quietly. This shows that Gina is trying to be careful not to wake up her mother or attract attention to what she is doing.
Based on these steps, option B is more likely: Gina tells her mom where the key is. Since Gina is trying to be quiet and avoid getting caught, it makes sense that she would want to hide the key in a place where her mother will easily find it when she needs it. By telling her mother where the key is, Gina can avoid any suspicion of wrongdoing and also ensure that her mother has access to the key when needed."
Response:  If the man wanted to be with his love, it would make sense for him to move closer to her location. Therefore, option B (the man moved to Kentucky) is the most likely answer.
Response:  If Tim failed math, then he had to go to summer school. This means that passing the class was crucial for him. Now, imagine that on the last day of school, he finds out that he actually passed. Wouldn't this be a great piece of news for him? Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Mary-Anne felt lonely so she wanted to adopt a cat. She goes to the humane society to do this. One of the cats meows at her, which makes her happy because she likes cats that are friendly. Therefore, option B (She took the cat home with her) is the most likely answer.
"Response:  The person who wrote this story said they were ""learning"" the balance beam. This means that they are still new at it and not very skilled yet. Also, when they say they ""landed wrong,"" this implies that their landing wasn't perfect. So, option B (the person gets right back on the balance beam) is unlikely because if someone lands wrong while doing a difficult move like a round-off flip, they would be more likely to get hurt again or feel too scared to try it again. Therefore, option A (they were rushed to the hospital) is the most likely outcome of this situation."
Response:  If there are six puppies, it would be unlikely that all six of them would be equally appealing to your daughters. Therefore, option A (We each bought one dog) is more likely. 
Response:  We know that Johnny wanted a change from his big city life in Boston. So option A does not make sense as it goes against what we have been told about Johnny's desires. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Johnny was happy to be in a small town.
"Response:  The story states, ""Her mother raced to her side to care for her needs."" This implies that Joan's mother was concerned about her well-being and wanted to help her. It does not suggest that Joan's mother disapproved of her or was unhappy that she was unmarried. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Joan felt good at seeing her mother's face."
"Response:  The protagonist spends all their time working on their writing, leading to feelings of loneliness. They then decide to join an online dating community in an attempt to meet new people and alleviate these feelings. However, upon joining, they realize they don't enjoy interacting with others. This suggests that option A - ""I began to write more"" - is the most likely outcome, as the protagonist may turn back to their writing as a means of coping with their loneliness."
"Response: 
The story states ""Everyone stayed in a cabin in New Hampshire for a weekend."" This implies that there were other adults and children at the cabin besides just my daughter and my wife. Therefore, option B is more likely because it mentions having dinner with these additional people. Option A does not provide any information about who else was at the cabin or what they did after the field trip."
"Response:  First, the narrator says they ""couldn't wait"" to attend the club opening. This implies that they are excited about going there. Secondly, when they arrive at the club, they describe it as ""beautiful"". This suggests that they were impressed with the appearance of the club. Thirdly, they order food and dance, which further indicates that they had a good time. Based on these details, option A (We befriended the bouncer so we would get into the club tomorrow) seems more likely because it aligns better with the positive tone of the story. Option B (The bouncer did not allow us into the club.) goes against this tone and could potentially create an unwelcoming or disappointing atmosphere for the reader."
"Response: 
The first sentence of the story states that you were carrying a new glass into the kitchen, which means you were holding something delicate in your hands. Then, you dropped it, which implies that you might have been careless or clumsy while handling the object. Finally, the story mentions that you had to pick it up, which suggests that you may have experienced some discomfort or inconvenience as a result of dropping the glass.
Based on these details, option A (I cut myself on a small piece) seems like the more likely outcome. It's plausible that when you picked up the broken glass, you may have accidentally cut yourself on one of its sharp edges. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Bill's family lived on a hill where it never rained or stormed. This means that the area is prone to natural disasters like tornados. Given this information, option B (They decided they didn't need it anyway, and moved) seems unlikely as moving away from an area with frequent natural disasters might not be practical or feasible. Therefore, option A (The insurance company covered the charges for a new roof) is more likely."
Response:  Allison wants to know more about her local history, so she goes to the library to look for a book on that topic. However, when she gets there, she finds it difficult to navigate the stacks because of the way the books are organized using the Dewey Decimal System. This means Option B is the correct answer - going to the library and finding what she was looking for thanks to the help of the librarian explaining the Dewey Decimal System.
"Response: 
Sebastian wanted to play football with his friend's team, so he attended practice. This means he put in effort and time into preparation beforehand (practicing catching the ball at home). Then, when he arrived at the practice, he performed well enough to score a touchdown! Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Sebastian was indeed happy that his practice paid off."
"Response: 
The story states that the mother ""walked him around"" and ""fed him,"" which suggests that the baby is awake and active. It also mentions that the mother tried different methods (such as walking and feeding) to get the baby to sleep, but none of them worked. This implies that the baby is fussy or difficult to settle down.

Now, let's consider the two possible endings to the story:

Option A: The mother gently sang the lullaby to her baby.
This option makes sense given the context of the story. Since all other methods have failed, the mother might try singing a soothing song to help her baby relax and fall asleep. Singing a lullaby can be an effective way to calm a fussy baby, especially if it has a gentle melody and familiar lyrics.

Option B: The mother played some hip hop for her baby.
This option seems less plausible in light of the story's details. If the baby is fussy and cannot be settled down with more traditional methods like walking and feeding, playing loud music like hip hop may not be the best choice. In fact, it could potentially stimulate the baby further and make it harder for them to wind down.

Based on these factors, I would say that Option A is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
In this scenario, Johnny has been doing something illegal (peeing in public places) for years when he was younger but stopped once he grew up. However, now that he has children with him at a water park, he feels like he can get away with it again without anyone noticing or caring. This shows a lack of self-awareness on Johnny's part, which may lead to negative consequences.
Option A is more likely since it highlights the potential consequences of Johnny's actions. It is possible that someone might notice what he is doing and report it to authorities, leading to legal troubles for Johnny. Additionally, his children may be confused or upset if they witness their father engaging in such behavior, potentially damaging their relationship."
Response:  The story states that Amy has asthma, which means she can't play sports. This might make her feel sad or left out, especially if she sees others playing without any trouble. So option B is more likely - Amy feels terrible because she can't participate in activities with her peers like they do.
Response:  The story states that Joe was nervous about winning or losing the game. This implies that there was some uncertainty or pressure on him. If his team ended up winning, it means they performed better than expected, which could make Joe feel proud or relieved. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice.
Response:  We know that Mark had a big interview, which means he must have been nervous about it. If he was nervous, then option B (Mark being enraged and storming out) is less likely because people who are angry or upset tend to act impulsively, rather than calmly and collectedly. On the other hand, if Mark was well-prepared for the interview as suggested in the passage, then he would have been more relaxed and composed during the interview, making option A (Mark being happy) more likely. Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, we can conclude that option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
The premise of the story states that Elaine didn't want to cook dinner. This implies that Elaine has a choice about what to do instead. If Elaine had no difficulty making up her mind, then option A (Elaine found it easy to make up her mind) is the more likely outcome. On the other hand, if Elaine struggled with indecision, then option B (Elaine found it difficult to make up her mind) is the more likely outcome. "
Response:  Sam filled out the application, which means he took some effort to do so. This suggests that he was invested in getting accepted into this college. Therefore, option A (he received an acceptance letter three months later) is more likely because it shows that Sam's efforts paid off and he got accepted into the college of his dreams. Option B (he never thought of it again) does not align with the information provided as there is no indication that Sam stopped caring about getting accepted into this college after submitting the application.
"Response: 
In this scenario, Matt got too drunk and lost his phone. This means he was unable to call or text anyone for help. Since they were bar hopping, it's unlikely that any of their other friends would be able to locate them easily. Therefore, option A (Matt and friends walked home and slept it off) seems like the most likely outcome. "
"Response: 
In this scenario, we have information about Bindu planning a party with her friends and them meeting up to decide on food and music for the event. This suggests that Bindu enjoys hosting social gatherings and values her friendships. Therefore, option A - ""Everyone had a great time"" - is the most likely outcome."
Response:  We know that Tyler wants to take a shower before school, but his little brother is already using the shower. This means that Tyler has to wait for his turn. So option B is more likely because it shows Tyler taking a quick shower and getting to the bus stop on time. Option A does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of Tyler making cupcakes or showing off any baking skills.
Response:  We know from the information provided in the passage that Thomas's cholesterol levels are high, so he starts eating healthier and going for walks. This suggests that he is taking steps to improve his overall health. Option B is the correct answer because it aligns with this interpretation of the passage. According to the story, Thomas's doctor will be pleased at his next checkup, indicating that his efforts to improve his health have been successful.
"Response:  The story states that ""the doorbell rang, but no one was there."" This implies that it was an unexpected visitor who had rung the bell. Therefore, option B (She screamed and pushed her brother away) is more likely because it suggests that someone unexpected appeared at the door, which could be a stranger or even an intruder, causing her to react with fear. Option A (She decided to watch her favorite comedy show on Netflix) does not align with this scenario as it would imply that she knew who was at the door beforehand and did not find it suspicious."
Response:  In this situation, it would be very difficult for Stephanie to push herself up using her broken wrists since she cannot use them properly. Therefore, option B is more likely - Stephanie could not get up until someone finds her.
Response:  Why did Roy's friends comment on how bad his apartment smells? Because of the old fish in the fridge! So, option B is more likely - Roy throws out the old fish and everything smells better.
"Response: 
Option A says that Jimmy repaid his parents for their efforts in sending him to college. This seems unlikely because it would be unfair to expect someone who has already sacrificed so much for you to also pay back your education expenses. It would also not be practical or feasible for Jimmy to come up with such a large sum of money, especially if he himself is struggling financially after graduating from college. Therefore, Option A is less likely than Option B.
Now let's consider Option B: ""Jimmy called his parents and cursed at them."" This option is more plausible given the context of the story. After all, Jimmy's parents have done everything they can to support him throughout his life, including working hard to send him to college. If Jimmy were feeling resentful or ungrateful towards them, he might lash out at them verbally instead of showing appreciation. Therefore, Option B is more likely than Option A."
"Response:  The story starts with ""Jill was surprised"" which means she didn't expect something to happen. Then it says ""a handsome boy asked her to the college dance."" This implies that Jill is in college or at least attending a college event. Next, we learn that Jill's roommates are getting ready for the same event as Jill. This tells us that Jill has roommates who live with her in the dormitory. Finally, the story states that Jill finishes dressing into her toga-like white gown. Togas were worn in ancient Greece, so this detail suggests that the setting of the story is also ancient Greece. Given these details, option B is more likely because it does not fit the context of the story to have Jill go on a solo girls-only night out after the dance. Instead, since Jill lives in a dormitory with roommates, it makes sense that she would spend time socializing with them before or after the dance."
"Response: 
The story states that the banner belongs to a bar owner, which means it has important information about the business such as its name or logo. This suggests that the owner will want to retrieve their banner as soon as possible. Therefore, option A (the old woman refuses to give back the banner) is more likely."
"Response: 
The story says ""I ate the pumpkin bars and I felt much better."" This implies that eating the pumpkin bars had a positive effect on the speaker's mood.
Moreover, the story states that the speaker's mother made the pumpkin bars specifically for the speaker when they were feeling down. This suggests that the speaker values their relationship with their mother and appreciates her efforts to make them feel better.
Based on these details, it is more likely that the speaker continued to enjoy pumpkin bars throughout their life and found them to be a source of comfort or nostalgia whenever they thought of their mother. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
Response:  The story states that Tim was initially uninterested in birdwatching but became interested after spending time with his grandfather. This suggests that option B (Tim and his grandad found a hobby that they both enjoyed) is the most likely outcome. Therefore, we should choose this option.
"Response: 
Option A says that Danny gives the little boy another scoop of ice cream. This makes sense because he wants to make sure the child has something delicious after their treat fell on the ground. It shows kindness and empathy towards the child. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states that ""Gina was never more happy for a day to end."" This implies that Gina dislikes school, which means she would not be happy if she had to stay there longer. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  We know that Laurence and his family decided to move, so option A is the correct answer. Therefore, Laurence and his family drove to their new home with all their belongings in the van.
Response:  Joy wants to find the perfect shell for her hermit crab, so option (B) makes sense as she brings one home and gives it to her crab. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).
"Response: 
If someone gets drunk at a wedding, it would be best for them to leave rather than staying there and causing trouble. Therefore, option (B) is more likely."
Response:  Why did Joe get stung six times? Because he disturbed a bee's nest, right? So, it makes sense that he would feel some pain or discomfort after getting stung multiple times. Now, let's consider how someone might react in this situation. If they were just helping their dad clear the woods, it's possible they might not have been expecting to disturb a bee's nest. They might also be scared or upset about getting stung. Therefore, option B (Joe was angry he got hurt) seems like the more likely choice.
Response:  Why would Todd want to spread the leaves around after he had just spent time collecting them? It doesn't make sense. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  We know that Tim has big goals (he wants to become a great bodybuilder) and works hard towards them (he exercises every night). This suggests that he is determined. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage involves an accident where Henry's phone falls onto the ground after being bumped into by another person. This could be frustrating or upsetting for anyone, especially if they have important information or memories stored on their device. Therefore, option A (the person apologizes to Henry) is more likely as it shows empathy towards Henry's loss."
Response:  The story states that Tami tried out for volleyball, not basketball. Also, the story mentions that the other players are just as good as Tami, which means they are probably at a similar skill level. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - all the players were good but Tami still made the team.
"Response: 
The story states that Bob and Jim were playing ball inside the house, which means they were indoors. Therefore, option A is unlikely because a person wouldn't enjoy having a broken vase inside their home. It would be more practical for their mom to find out about the broken vase since she was presumably nearby while they were playing. So, the correct answer is (B) The glue held the vase together and their mom never found out."
"Response: 
Steve was very sad because his girlfriend broke up with him, so he wrote a song to express his feelings. This suggests that he still has feelings for her and may want to get back together. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  The story states that Gloria wanted to buy flowers for her husband, but she found them too expensive. This suggests that Gloria values her relationship with her husband and wants to make him happy. Then, instead of buying expensive flowers, she decides to pick some of her own flowers from the garden. This shows that Gloria is resourceful and willing to go the extra mile to please her husband. Therefore, option B (her husband appreciated the gesture) is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Josh wanted to make any basket on the court, so he practiced hard every day. Now, someone has challenged him to a contest where whoever makes the most shots will win. This means that Josh has an opportunity to show off his skills and prove how good he is at making baskets. Therefore, option B (He made the most shots and won the contest) is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
Lauren wants to wear skinny jeans because they make her feel confident and stylish. But in order to fit into those jeans, she must first lose weight through diet and exercise. This means that she has been working hard for weeks or months to achieve this goal. Now imagine that she finally reaches her target weight and can slip into those skinny jeans with ease. Wouldn't she be feeling pretty great about herself at this point? Option A seems like the more likely outcome here - Lauren would want to show off her new look and feel proud of all her hard work."
Response:  The student went to Hawaii with their whole band class, which means they were part of an organized trip. This suggests that they had some level of excitement or anticipation about visiting Hawaii beforehand. Additionally, since it only took 9 hours to fly there, it seems unlikely that they would have been disappointed with their experience once they arrived. Therefore, option A (I decided that I wanted to go to Hawaii more) is the most likely answer.
Response:  Sonny lives in Texas where it is very hot during the summer. To escape the heat, he wants to find something to cool him down. Option A suggests that he turns on his heaters, which would actually make things warmer for him. Therefore, option B is more likely - he decides to jump into his pool.
"Response: 
Option A states that Chad gets up the nerve to do something completely different from singing - he delivers a comedy routine. This seems unlikely given that Chad has been too afraid to even sing in front of people. It makes more sense that if Chad had the courage to perform, it would be related to his actual talent rather than doing something entirely unrelated. 
Option B, on the other hand, aligns better with the context provided. If Chad has been hiding his singing ability due to fear of ridicule, it's plausible that when he finally decides to share it, others will respond positively instead of negatively. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Ronald has two children already, so he knows how much work it takes to raise them. Having another child means more responsibility, stress, and financial burden. It would make sense that he might feel overwhelmed or even unhappy about this news. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  The person is hiking, they see a four-foot snake with beady eyes in front of them, and then they scream and run away. This suggests that the person is not a biologist studying snakes because if they were, they would have been more calm and collected when encountering one. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
If Mary likes to drink coffee, then she probably enjoys it very much. If she's in a hurry, she might not want to waste time going back to correct her mistake. Therefore, option B (Mary kept driving and drank it anyway) is more likely. "
"Response:  The story states, ""After work one day Bill decided to join some coworkers for drinks."" This implies that Bill already has coworkers who are willing to hang out with him after work. Therefore, option B is more likely - Bill was upset at his coworkers."
"Response: 
The story states that Billy wanted to become a doctor but after graduating, he changed his mind and became a nurse instead. This suggests that Billy had second thoughts about pursuing medicine as a career. It does not necessarily mean that he regretted his decision entirely or became an alcoholic due to his change of heart. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."
Response:  If Quinton had spent all of his money on the lottery ticket, then he would have nothing left for rent or any other expenses. This means that he could be in danger of being homeless. Therefore, option A (Quinton feels depressed) is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
Igor woke up, got ready for work, and then decided whether or not to take a shower. If we assume that he wanted to take a shower, then option B (he took a cold shower) is more likely because there is no reason for him to debate about not showering if he already wants to take one. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states that Tara ""tried to find fellow big band lovers."" This implies she wanted company in enjoying this type of music, which suggests she may be sociable or friendly. Option B (""Tara was a mean girl"") contradicts this idea, as it implies she might not get along with others who share her interest. Therefore, option A is more likely: Tara still enjoyed listening on her own."
Response:  The story states that the speaker visited their boyfriend in Washington D.C., which implies they are a couple. It also says they went on a tour of the White House together. Therefore, option A is more likely as it aligns with the information provided in the passage. Option B goes against this information and creates an inconsistency in the narrative.
"Response:  We know that the child is only one year old, so she may not have developed any preferences yet. However, we also know that children at this age are naturally curious and love exploring new things. Therefore, option B - ""She wanted to play the drums"" - is the most likely outcome."
Response:  The story says that Maggie played perfectly, which means she did a great job! So it's unlikely that she would give up the piano after such an accomplishment. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  The story states that Ed likes movie night with his family, so he probably enjoys spending time with them. It also says that they are watching Aladdin, which is a classic Disney movie that many people enjoy. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - Ed was happy with the ending of the movie.
"Response:  The story states that you ""went in this morning and signed up for the plan."" This implies that you have already completed the action of signing up, so option A (you are glad you signed up) is the more likely choice."
Response:  Mac has a vegan friend coming over for dinner. This means that Mac himself is not a vegan, as he would not be able to accommodate such a guest otherwise. Now, Mac knows he can't make traditional meat-based dishes like steak or hamburgers because of his friend's dietary restrictions. However, he remembers an alfredo sauce recipe made with cashews, which are a plant-based ingredient. So, it is highly likely that Mac decides to go ahead and prepare the vegan-friendly dish. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  The story states that Ryan works as a security guard at a mall during the night shifts. This means that he has a regular schedule of working late into the evening. It also mentions that he sees a raccoon inside the mall while on duty. Now, why would someone who is blind be able to see something like this? It doesn't make sense, so option A is not the correct answer. Option B does offer an explanation for why Ryan might have been staring at the raccoon for hours - perhaps he found it interesting or unusual enough to warrant extended observation. Therefore, we can conclude that option B is more likely than option A.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage is as follows: Johnny's teacher gave the students homemade snow cones with different-colored syrup toppings. Johnny was next in line for his snow cone, but there were only two colors of syrup remaining (red and blue). Johnny became angry or upset because he did not have any other choices. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  The story states that Tim has to choose between three girls, which means he is straight. Option A is incorrect because it implies that Tim is gay, which contradicts the information provided in the story. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Jill wanted Joe to come along, so option A is unlikely. She might have been hoping that they will find it soon, which makes more sense in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Jill hoped they would find it soon."
"Response: 
Ella had an expensive, high-quality piano from a reputable manufacturer. This means that she probably received excellent craftsmanship and materials in her instrument. However, since she didn't practice regularly, it's unlikely that she would have developed any significant skills on the piano. In fact, without consistent practice, even someone with access to a top-notch instrument may struggle to improve their playing abilities. Therefore, option A (Ella did not become good at piano) seems like the more plausible outcome of this scenario."
Response:  We know that Dave wants to buy a gun, but we don't know why. Maybe he wants to protect himself from an intruder or maybe he just likes guns. But whatever the reason, buying a gun is not something you do on impulse. It requires research and careful consideration. So option A is unlikely because Dave didn't seem to be in a hurry to make a decision. Instead, he took his time to ask questions and look around before deciding what kind of gun he wanted. Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response:  The story says it was ""cold"" and ""windswept."" These are weather conditions that make you want to stay warm and protect yourself from the elements. So, option B is more likely - Rose shielded her face from the wind."
Response:  Since Drew fell asleep while typing, some letters got pressed onto the page accidentally. This means that there will be typos in his work. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Drew has to start typing the paper over again because of the errors caused by his sleeping.
Response:  We know that Sarah loves the night sky because her father noticed this interest of hers. He then buys her a new telescope as a gift. This means he wants her to enjoy something she likes. Therefore, option B is more likely - Sarah loved her new telescope.
Response:  Kristen wanted to move her room, but after moving everything, she noticed a huge stain on her bedcover. This suggests that she hasn't cleaned or maintained her room properly in a long time. Given this context, option B is more likely - she will decide to put a rug over the stain rather than leaving it unattended.
Response:  Firstly, it is unlikely that someone would break into another person's home without any prior warning or notice. It is also unlikely that they would do so during the daytime when people are more likely to be awake and alert. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice. Additionally, if someone did manage to break into your home uninvited, you would probably feel scared and threatened rather than having a casual conversation over drinks with them. So again, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  The story states that ""my parents fell out of love"" which means they are no longer in a romantic relationship. This implies that they will be living separately, as there is no indication that they will continue to cohabitate. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  We know that Anna wants a little sister, so option B (the new baby was a girl) is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states that Monica's friend dared to steal Doritos, which means they took something without permission. This action is illegal and can lead to consequences such as getting caught, facing legal problems, or damaging relationships. It is unlikely that Monica would enjoy the stolen Doritos before the next dare because she might feel guilty about what happened or worry about getting in trouble herself. Therefore, option (B) is the most likely outcome of this situation."
Response:  Ray forgot his toothbrush at home, so he cannot brush his teeth properly. Option A is more likely because Ray asks his friend if he has a spare toothbrush, which means he wants to borrow one from his friend. It makes sense since he doesn't have any other option to clean his teeth. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
From the information given in the passage, we know that Ellie completed all of her assignments quickly, including the study guide, which only took her ten minutes. This suggests that Ellie is efficient and organized when it comes to completing her work.
Now, let's consider option A: ""Ellie was felt prepared for her schooling."" Based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that Ellie would feel unprepared for school after finishing all of her assignments so quickly. In fact, it's more likely that she would feel confident and ready for her classes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A says, ""He named it Don's Comics."" This means that Don started a business selling comic books under his name. It's unlikely that someone would throw away their entire collection of comic books just because they want to start a business selling them. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Since Arnold is afraid of bats, it makes sense that he might try to avoid them. So option A, where he takes a relaxing shower with the bat, is unlikely because he wouldn't want to be near it. Therefore, the more likely outcome is Option B, where the bat flies towards the source of the scream.
"Response: 
Option A says that Annabelle said yes and was excited for the opportunity, which means she agreed to join Mary's band. This makes sense because if someone notices your talent and offers you a chance to showcase it, you would probably be eager to accept. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Black mambas are highly venomous snakes found in sub-Saharan Africa. Their venom can cause respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and other systemic complications that can be fatal within hours if left untreated. Therefore, option B is more likely as they would have given him an antivenin (antidote) to neutralize the effects of the snake bite. Drinking plenty of fluids may help with dehydration caused by fever or vomiting but it won't counteract the effects of the venom itself.
"Response: 
Sean was homeless and begging for money on the street. No one gave him any money for an entire week, so he was starving. What would you do in this situation? Most people would probably try to find some way to get food or shelter, rather than just giving up and moving into a huge house out of nowhere. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Why did one hobo return with a worn boot? Perhaps he found it in a dumpster or picked it up off the street. It might be useful for carrying food, but it doesn't seem like an ideal ingredient for cooking. Now consider what the other hobo brought back - a gross of wing nuts! These are small metal pieces used to secure wings on airplanes, not exactly something you would want to eat. So, given these strange ingredients, it seems unlikely that the two hobos would decide to make a meal together. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome.
Response:  We know that Judy made a roast with potatoes and rolls with gravy, which suggests she was well-organized in her cooking. Additionally, Bill set the table, which shows he was also well-prepared for guests. Therefore, option B (Judy and Bill were very prepared) is the more likely answer.
"Response:  The story states, ""She (the wife) felt so bad..."". This implies that the wife feels guilty about what happened. Then it says, ""She bought him food..."" which further suggests that the wife wants to take care of her husband. Finally, it says, ""He (Sal)...liked all the attention."" This indicates that Sal enjoys being taken care of. Based on these clues, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Jake's family moved away when Rebecca was 13 years old. This means that Jake was 13 years old as well since they are the same age. Then, the story says that Jake promised Rebecca he would come back for her. This implies that Jake kept his promise and returned to be with Rebecca at some point in the future.
Now, let's consider option A: ""Jake's family moved back next to Rebecca three years later."" This ending does not make sense based on the information provided in the story. If Jake's family moved away when Rebecca was 13 years old, then it would have been three years later when she was 16 years old, which is still too young for Jake to keep his promise of coming back for her. Therefore, this option is unlikely.
On the other hand, option B: ""Rebecca and Jake both auditioned for the musical"" could be a possible ending to the story. Since Jake promised Rebecca he would come back for her, it makes sense that he might return to her through a shared interest or activity like auditioning for a musical together. So, this option seems more plausible than option A."
Response:  The couple in this scenario are already married, so there is no chance of them getting a divorce after this event. Therefore, option A is not possible. Option B is the more likely outcome as it aligns with the fact that they are able to enjoy their separate activities together without any issues.
"Response: 
The story states, ""Amy's sister took her to the beach to surf."" This implies that they are at the beach for the purpose of surfing. 
Next, we learn that Amy put on her wetsuit quickly. This suggests that she was eager to start surfing right away. 
Then, the instructor was patient with Amy even though she had trouble getting the hang of it. This indicates that Amy struggled with surfing initially but the instructor helped her through it. 
Finally, it says ""finally it was time for Amy to try on her own"". This means that after some practice from the instructor, Amy felt confident enough to try surfing independently. 
Based on this information, option B (Amy was surprised that she did a good job) seems more likely because it aligns with the progression of events described in the passage."
Response:  If Kay built himself a raft using planks of scrap wood and nails, then it is unlikely that he would use it as firewood right after testing it out in the lake. It makes more sense that his raft will float, so option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Max is ""a very bright boy"" which means he has high intelligence. However, it also says that he becomes lost in his own vivid imagination, indicating that he has difficulty focusing on tasks at hand. This could lead to him struggling academically. Therefore, option A is more likely: Max consistently fails."
"Response: 
The story states that Gina watched as friends made remarks and told stories about her grandfather. This implies that these people had positive things to say about him. It also says that their stories were ""funny and interesting."" This suggests that they saw her grandfather in a positive light. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - Gina knew her grandfather was someone she would always remember."
Response:  We know that Ashley has been feeling unwell, so it makes sense that she would want to go home to rest and recover. It also seems unlikely that she would go surfing when she is feeling sick, as this could make her condition worse. Therefore, option B (Ashley went home and went to bed to get better) is the most likely outcome in this scenario.
Response:  Marley has trouble sleeping, so she goes to buy a new bed. However, she can't find one she likes at the local store. This suggests that she may not have much experience shopping for beds or know what features are important in a good bed. It also implies that she hasn't tried many different types of beds before. Therefore, option A (her mom brings her to a sleep specialist) makes more sense as it would give Marley access to professional advice on how to choose the right bed for her specific needs. Option B (her mom gives her an alarm clock) doesn't seem related to Marley's problem with sleeping, and wouldn't help her find a better bed.
"Response:  The story states that Joe ""landed a well-paying job."" This means that option B is more likely because it shows that Joe found success in his career pursuit. Option A does not provide any information about Joe finding employment or experiencing success in his field. Therefore, based on the given details, option B is the most likely outcome for Joe's story."
Response:  Why would Lizzy decide she doesn't like bananas just because she saw them growing on a tree? It makes no sense! Therefore, option A is unlikely. Now let's consider option B: Lizzy needed help to get the bananas down. This makes more sense since it's common for people to need assistance when climbing trees, especially if they are very tall or have difficulty reaching the fruit. So, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states that the person rode on an ""old bus"" in 1997. This means they are at least 24 years old (as of 2021). Additionally, the story mentions that the bus was painted in ""old colors,"" which suggests that it was from a previous era. Finally, the story says that the person took ""plenty of photos."" All these details suggest that the person enjoyed their experience on the bus and had a good time. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Bryan ""wondered"" why his arms itched, which implies that he wasn't sure what was causing the itching. Then, it says that he scratched his arms until they left scars, which suggests that the itching was quite severe. Finally, the story mentions that the doctor diagnosed him with poison ivy, which means that Bryan did go to see a medical professional about his symptoms. Therefore, option B (Bryan went home relieved) is the more likely outcome of this story."
"Response:  We know that Tony and Mark are rivals, which means they are equally skilled. Since it says every day after school they play one on one, we can assume these are individual matches rather than team games. So, the outcome of each match will depend solely on the skills of Tony and Mark. Now, let's consider option A: ""Tony would blow out Mark."" This implies that Tony has a significant advantage over Mark, which contradicts the fact that Tony and Mark are equally skilled. Therefore, this option is unlikely. On the other hand, option B: ""The games were very close"" aligns better with the information provided since it suggests that both players are evenly matched, as expected given their rivalry. Hence, the answer is (B) The games were very close. "
Response:  Becky and her friends made candy bars, which means they enjoyed themselves while doing so (otherwise why would they continue). They also finished making the candy bars when they were cool. Now let's consider what happens next...  Option A states that after finishing their project, they didn't want to do anything related to candy-making ever again. This seems unlikely as people generally enjoy activities they engage in, especially if they have fun with friends like Becky did here. On the other hand, option B suggests that her friends thought selling the candies at a bake sale was a good idea, implying that they found value in sharing their creations with others. Given these points, I believe option B is more likely.
Response:  Robin went to the gym, which means she spent time there doing exercise. Then it says she worked out for 2 hours, which implies that she did some serious exercise during those two hours. Finally, it says she did arms and abs while at the gym, which suggests that she focused on these specific areas of her body. Given all this information, option B (She went home and ate 3 cartons of ice cream) seems unlikely because it goes against what we know about Robin's determination to get in shape. Therefore, option A (She continued to work out for the rest of the year) is the more plausible ending to the story.
Response:  Rachelle worked hard to buy her first home, so this means that she had put in effort and time into achieving it. However, when she lost her job and eventually, her home, it would be natural for her to feel sad or upset about it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Rachelle becomes depressed.
Response:  The story says that Wendy took her daughter to the orchard. This means she must have enjoyed spending time with her child. Option A is therefore more likely.
"Response:  The story states that Bill saved up his pocket change for two weeks, which means he had $10 in total (assuming an average weekly allowance of $5). Then, he went to the store and spent it all on a sucker. This implies that the sucker cost around $10. Finally, the story says that while walking home, Bill tripped and fell. Given that he just spent all his money on something, it's unlikely that he would be thinking about being the ""luckiest guy alive"" after falling down. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  We know that Neil visited Transylvania because it was exciting for him. He saw beautiful old castles and friendly locals. This suggests that he enjoyed his time in Transylvania. Therefore, option B is more likely - Neil enjoyed visiting Transylvania.
Response:  Marc loves video games, so it is unlikely that he would be late for anything else like a football game. Therefore, option A is not the most likely answer. Now let's consider option B. The new video game being disappointing could definitely happen as there are many factors that can affect how good or bad a game is such as poor graphics, uninteresting plot, etc. So option B seems more plausible than option A.
Response:  If something goes wrong during a stunt, there are many things that could happen. One possibility is that the person performing the stunt gets hurt or injured. This is what happened in this case - the safety harness snapped and the stuntman was ejected from his seat. As a result, he may have been seriously injured or even paralyzed. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
Ralph never listens to Pamela, he shows up late, and he flirts excessively with other women. This indicates that Ralph does not respect or value Pamela as his partner. If this pattern of behavior continues over time, it may lead to the end of their relationship due to lack of trust and communication issues. Therefore, option (B) is the most likely outcome - Pamela decides to break up with Ralph because he consistently fails to meet her emotional needs and show her disrespect."
Response:  We know that Helen wanted to go to space, so option A is more likely. Therefore, we choose option A: Helen looked forward to her first mission.
"Response:  The story states that it took the person ""over 8 hours"" to move their stuff into their apartment, which suggests they were quite exhausted afterward. Option A implies that they then went on to sleep for an extremely long time, which seems unlikely given how tired they must have been. Therefore, option B is more plausible - they probably packed all their stuff back up again rather than sleeping for an unusually long period of time."
"Response:  The story states ""One day Hailey's mom got in an argument with one of the other moms."" This implies that there has been some kind of conflict or disagreement between the two mothers. It does not say anything about Hailey being excited or happy about seeing her friends again, quite the opposite actually. In fact, it says ""Hailey was told they were never going back"". This means that Hailey will no longer be able to play with these friends, which would make her cry or feel sad. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states ""Maybelle's breath always smelled like peppermints."" This implies that Maybelle was alive when the narrator was young, since it would be unlikely for someone's breath to still smell like peppermints after they had passed away. Additionally, the fact that the narrator associates peppermints with his grandmother suggests that he has positive memories of her. Therefore, the most likely answer is (B) It is a fond memory."
"Response: 
The story states that Jake fell and broke his leg while skiing. This means that he will need time to recover from his injury before he can try skiing again. Therefore, option A (Jake waited for his leg to heal) is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states that Valerie ""decided she wanted to learn German."" This implies that she has never learned German before or doesn't speak it fluently. If she wants to learn German, then it makes sense that she would want to visit Germany or live there at some point. Therefore, option A (Valerie wanted to visit Germany) is the most likely answer."
Response:  The story tells us that Clara went to the mall, met her friend Sally, and they spent the whole day together doing various activities (shopping). This suggests that Clara did not feel tired or lonely during their outing. Therefore, option A is unlikely, as it states that Clara was tired when she got home, which contradicts what we know from the story. Option B is also unlikely because there is no indication in the story that Clara felt lonely. So, the correct answer is option A: Clara was not tired by the time she got home.
Response:  The story states that Tim bought a waterproof phone case, which means that if he were to accidentally get his phone wet (e.g., spill water on it), the case would keep the phone safe from damage. Therefore, option A is unlikely because there is no indication that Tim actually spilled water on his phone after purchasing the case. Option B is more plausible since buying a waterproof case suggests that Tim wanted protection against water damage, so it makes sense that he wouldn't need to worry about dropping his phone in water anymore.
Response:  Why would Gina walk away from her family at a rest stop? It doesn't make sense for her to leave them unattended, especially if she's tired or bored. Therefore, option A is unlikely. Now let's consider option B. Gina being hungry could explain why she might enjoy something she usually dislikes, such as Burger King's fries. So, option B seems more plausible.
Response:  If this person claimed to be your long-lost mother, you would probably want some proof or evidence before believing them. You might ask for details about yourself that only your parents would know, like where you grew up or what your childhood nickname was. Or you could simply hang up the phone and not give it another thought. It's unlikely that someone would claim to be your parent without any concrete evidence or reason to believe it. Therefore, option A (She said she was your long lost mother) is less likely than option B (You said goodbye to the man on the phone).
Response:  We know that Nelly had a bad day at work, so we can assume that she might be feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Since she ran outside during her break, it suggests that she wanted to get away from the chaos of the store and take a moment to relax. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice - the fresh air was exactly what Nelly needed to clear her head.
"Response:  The story states, ""Alec's daughter wanted more blocks to play with."" This implies that she enjoys playing with blocks and finds them interesting. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Alec is happy to see his daughter developing her verbal ability through using the letter-blocks."
Response:  If you decide to murder your neighbor, it means that you have committed an illegal act. Therefore, you will be arrested and charged with a crime. As a result, you are likely to face trial and if found guilty, you may receive a sentence such as life imprisonment or even death penalty depending on the severity of the crime and the laws of the country/state where the crime occurred. So option (B) is more likely.
Response:  Tim got a record player from a thrift store, but he doesn't have any records to play on it yet. So, he asks his parents for help. They give him their entire record collection from their youth! That means he now has plenty of records to listen to. However, there's a catch - he breaks them all one by one as his parents watch. This is not something that would happen in real life because why would someone break their parent's treasured records? It makes no sense. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states that Amy ""wanted to get healthy."" This implies that she wants to improve her overall well-being, which often involves losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight. Therefore, option B (Amy was determined to lose weight) is the most likely answer."
Response:  The story states that after Tina danced, the instructor told her that her skills weren't good enough to make the team. This means that Tina did not pass the audition. Therefore, option A (Tina held back her tears) is the correct answer because it is more likely that Tina would be upset about not making the team than joining it.
Response:  The situation is that Sally forgot her wallet at home, so she can't buy anything from the taco stand. Then a nice man offers to pay for her tacos. This is a very kind gesture, so it makes sense that Sally would be grateful for this person's help. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  If Amy got a minor raise, that means she expected to receive more money than what she actually did. So option A is the correct answer. Amy was indeed very upset when she realized there was no raise in her latest paycheck. 
"Response: 
Option A states that Jennifer ""worked hard"" on her lessons and eventually got into the band. However, we know from the beginning of the story that she did not initially feel ready to try out for the band. This means that Option A is unlikely because it implies a quick progression in her skills without much effort or practice.
On the other hand, Option B states that Jennifer had not taken any cello lessons, which aligns with our initial understanding of the situation since she started learning how to play the instrument later on. Therefore, Option B seems more plausible given the information provided in the story."
Response:  The story says that Fred went to the beach with his friends, which means he was at least somewhat conscious when they had their party. If he had fallen off the bed or gotten drunk enough to pass out while still in bed, it would be unlikely for him to have made it all the way to the beach without anyone noticing. Therefore, option B is more likely.
Response:  If Ronnie hit a rock while riding his bike, it's possible that he might have fallen off or been injured. In this case, he would not be able to continue working, let alone ride his bike to work every day. Therefore, option B (Ronnie quit as soon as he got in) is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states that Burke has few friends because of his constant frowning. This suggests that people may find him unapproachable or unfriendly due to his facial expression. Now, when a stranger tells him to smile more, it could be seen as an attempt at social engineering - trying to change someone's behavior without their consent. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states ""Matt wasn't paying attention."" This implies he was distracted or not fully focused on the road. Given this context, it is unlikely (A) that Matt will start paying more attention to the road after hitting someone. Instead, people might become more cautious or vigilant in similar situations. Option (B), where Matt changes the radio station, seems like an irrelevant detail that doesn't contribute much to the narrative. It's possible but less likely compared to option (A). Therefore, I would choose option (B) as the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story tells us that Brian was excited about the talent show, practiced hard on his drums, and even wore a skirt as an expression of his individuality. This suggests that Brian is being creative and bold in his performance. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer - Brian was indeed very creative and brave."
"Response:  The narrator says they ""decided"" to decorate their house, which implies that they enjoy doing it. They also say they ""went to the store and bought decorations,"" which suggests they are actively participating in the process. Therefore, option A (I loved decorating) is the more likely answer."
"Response:  The speaker has just said they were ""so happy"" when their boss offered them the new position, which suggests that they do feel they deserve it. Therefore, option A (I feel I deserve it) is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Step 1: Tia decides to make homemade soap for the craft fair. Okay, that makes sense.
Step 2: She makes glycerin soap in a big pot on her kitchen stove. This part also checks out - glycerin soap is easy to make at home using common ingredients like oils, lye, and distilled water.
Step 3: She presses flower blossoms into the centers of her bars. Now this is where things get interesting! It's possible that Tia might want to add decorations to her soap bars before cutting them into bars and letting them cure. Flower blossoms would be a lovely touch, don't you think? However...
Step 4: Which ending to the story is most likely? Well, let's consider what Tia might do next. If she wants to sell her soap at the craft fair, it doesn't really make sense for her to use the soap to wash her dirty dogs ( Option B). That would defeat the purpose of selling the soap, wouldn't it? So the most likely option is (A): Tia then made pretty labels to put on each bar. After all, if Tia wants to present her soap in an attractive way at the craft fair, she will need to label each bar with its name or ingredients so customers know what they are buying."
"Response:  Firstly, it was mentioned that the police were ""stuck"" at the crime scene. This implies that they have not yet made any progress in solving the case. Secondly, when they received the tip about checking behind the library, there was no guarantee that they would find anything useful there. Finally, even if they did find something important, it is unlikely that they would immediately apprehend the perpetrator without further investigation. Therefore, option A (the police finding the perpetrator and locking her up) is less likely than option B (the police putting on a community event to raise money)."
Response:  We know that Pat studied hard for a week, which means he put in effort to prepare for the test. This suggests that he is motivated and determined to do well. Additionally, we see him making flashcards to study on the bus, which shows that he is committed to learning and retaining the material. Given these factors, it is more likely that Pat will be happy with his performance on the test than sad. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Marsh has just moved into a new house with her husband. This means they are starting a new life together. It also means they have to learn how to live together, which includes learning each other's habits and preferences. Given this context, it is unlikely for Marsha to be elated about burning the chicken and overcooking the rice. In fact, given her lack of experience in cooking, it would make more sense for her to feel devastated or disappointed at not being able to deliver on her promise of making a great meal. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Ending A suggests that Solomon asks the interviewer for an old-fashioned drink as a way of mocking his own name. However, this seems unlikely given that Solomon has just expressed dislike towards his name. It would be illogical for him to then embrace or celebrate its uniqueness in such a manner. Therefore, option B is more likely - Solomon thinks his name might not be so bad after all."
Response:  Kelly lost something valuable (bracelet) and searched for it everywhere but couldn't find it. Then suddenly, she found it underneath her car seat! This seems unlikely because people usually don't keep their valuables underneath their car seats. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  The person who wrote this story wants us to believe that their husband is a huge Star Wars fan. They bought him tickets as a gift. This means they are trying to make us believe that their husband really likes Star Wars. However, if we were to assume that option B is true (he threw the tickets away), then why would the writer write about how much their husband loves Star Wars? It doesn't add up. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, option A is more likely.
"Response: 
The customer requested spaghetti from Ben. This means that they wanted something specific. If Ben had given them what they wanted, there would be no problem. However, he chose to use an already used plate instead of washing a new one. This shows laziness or carelessness on his part. Now, if the customer came back a week later and found out about this, it could lead to legal action against the restaurant. Therefore, option B (the customer was angry) seems more plausible than option A (the customer was uplifted)."
Response:  If Stacey got back in her car and drove to work, that means she didn't report the accident to the police. Therefore option A is not the most likely outcome. So the answer is (B) Stacey told the police what happened.
"Response: 
Option A states that Diane ""decided she hated Karen more than ever before."" This seems unlikely because it would be unreasonable for someone to hate another person just because one of them got into a better college while the other didn't. It's understandable if Diane might feel upset or disappointed, but hating Karen doesn't seem like an appropriate response in this situation. 
On the other hand, Option B suggests that they will ""agree to go their separate ways,"" which could potentially happen depending on how close their friendship actually is. If they have different priorities or goals, they may decide it's best to pursue their own paths rather than continue sharing a dorm room at Cornell. However, without additional context, it's difficult to say for sure what choice Diane would make."
"Response:  The story says that the cat ""died two weeks ago."" This means that it has been at least two weeks since the event occurred. Therefore, option A is more likely because the family still misses their pet. They haven't had enough time to move on from their grief yet."
"Response: 
In this scenario, Reilly loves going to the fair and enjoys the petting zoo section the most. She feeds a small goat first before moving on to feed a cow. However, when she ignores the goat's attempts for more food, it becomes angry and bites her. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  The story states that Sally is estranged from the family, which means she has been distant or unfriendly towards them for some time. This suggests that there may be tension or conflict between Sally and the rest of the family. Therefore, option A (Sally ends up being your best friend) is unlikely as it goes against the established dynamic between the characters. Option B (Sally wants to inform the family of her husband's condition) is more plausible given the context of the story.
Response:  Why would Laura wear a hat all week after getting her hair done if she loved it? It doesn't make sense that she would want to cover up something she loves. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer. Now let's consider option B. If Laura received many compliments on her new hairdo, it's likely that she thought the trip was worth it based on how good she looked and felt. So, option B is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
The story starts with ""Neil had just arrived in Bulgaria."" This implies that he has never been there before, which means he doesn't have any preconceived notions about the country. Therefore, option A is more likely - Neil thought the country was wonderful."
Response:  If the man wanted to go through the gate, then option B (the man went under the gate) would be more likely because it is shorter than option A (the man jumped over the gate). However, if the man did not want to go through the gate but rather avoid it, then option A (the man jumped over the gate) might be more likely since he would need to reach higher to clear the obstacle. Therefore, without additional information about the situation or the character's intentions, neither answer can be said with certainty.
Response:  The person waited in line for hours just to watch the movie they wanted to see. This means that they were very eager to watch it. Then, when they finally get inside the theater, they are even more excited because they can't wait to start watching it. It doesn't make sense that they would leave after only half an hour. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer.
"Response:  The story states that the protagonist ""wanted fancy socks"" and then they ""decided to treat [themselves]"". This implies that the protagonist has a desire for something specific, which they are satisfying through their purchase. Additionally, the fact that they read reviews before making a decision suggests that they made an informed choice. Therefore, it is more likely that the protagonist will be happy with their purchase (Option B)."
"Response: 
Option A states that Grayson gets much less for his stamps than they are worth. This means that Grayson did not get a good price for his stamps. However, it does not necessarily mean that he got nothing for them. Perhaps he sold them for enough to cover his rent but still left with some profit. Or maybe he sold them at a discounted rate because he needed the money urgently. Without more information, we cannot determine whether Option A or Option B is true. Therefore, I choose option B as the most likely outcome."
Response:  The story states that Lance and Adam were best friends before Lance joined the army, which means they had a strong bond of friendship. Then it says that when Lance got injured, he saved Adam's life. This shows that their friendship was very deep and selfless. Now consider option A - Adam was never able to repay Lance. It seems unlikely because if they were such close friends, Adam would definitely want to do something to help Lance back, even if it meant sacrificing his own well-being. Option B - Lance never spoke to Adam again also seems unlikely as it goes against the nature of their friendship. Friends like them are usually willing to forgive and forget any past differences or misunderstandings, especially when one has risked his life for the other. Therefore, the most likely ending to this story is option B - Lance never spoke to Adam again.
"Response:  The story states ""After signing the attendance board,"" which implies that the protagonist attended an event or appointment at the dentist's office. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that the protagonist was nervous about the procedure but the dentist reassured them that everything would be okay. Option A does not make sense in this context, as there is no mention of a petition being involved in the scenario."
Response:  The story states that Tim's parents bought him a drum set for Christmas. This means they already knew he wanted to play the drums. Now, it says they were upset because it was too loud. Why did they buy him a drum set if they didn't want him to make noise with it? It doesn't make sense. Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response: 
The speaker loves all-you-can-eat buffets, but they are expensive. This means Option A (So I would indulge every once in a while) is more likely. "
Response:  The story states that Kenny fell while playing on the jungle gym, which means he injured himself. It also mentions that he fractured his arm in three places, which is a serious injury. Therefore, it is more likely that Kenny will have to go to the hospital for medical attention rather than play basketball. So, the correct answer is (B) Kenny had to be taken to the hospital.
Response:  We know that Mag had a night without her kids or husband, which means she had some time to herself. This could be seen as relaxing. However, taking a bubble bath and ordering Chinese food are both things that people do when they want to indulge themselves and feel good. So it seems more likely that May had a very relaxing night rather than a stressed one. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Lilly forgot to add sugar to the cranberry sauce, which means that without sugar, the sauce would be quite tart or sour. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - the cranberry sauce was very sour.
Response:  The author mentions that both their kids came home for winter break, which means they are at least old enough to go to college. This implies that they are probably teenagers or young adults. Then, the author states that they spent time baking cookies, decorating the house, and going shopping together. This suggests that the family has a close relationship and enjoys spending quality time together. Finally, the author mentions making Christmas gifts, which further reinforces the idea that they value tradition and spending time together during the holidays. Based on this information, it is most likely that option B is true - the author had a great time with her kids while they were home from college.
"Response: 
The story states that ""the trash was taken to the landfill"" after the first squirrel disappeared. This implies that the dumpster company picked up the trash. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states that Tom gave Rob a ""large case"" of a rare variety of salsa, which suggests that it was an expensive gift. Additionally, the fact that Rob opens the gift with a smile implies that he is pleased with the present. Therefore, option A (Rob was happy) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states, ""She pushed harder than she ever had."" This implies that Jennifer has tried this before but never succeeded as much as she did now. Option B does not make sense because if Jennifer thought swimming wasn't her best hobby then why would she be trying so hard at it? Therefore option A is more likely."
"Response: 
If we choose option A, then it means that Ace called out his friend for cheating. This would mean that Ace didn't want to play with someone who wasn't following the rules. It could also lead to a confrontation or argument between them. However, if they were just playing for fun, then calling out their friend might not be necessary.
On the other hand, if we choose option B, then it means that Ace was happy for his friend. This could indicate that Ace trusted his friend enough to let them win without getting upset. Or maybe Ace thought that his friend deserved to win after all the times they played together. Either way, this outcome suggests a positive relationship between them."
Response:  Paul wants to buy his wife a gift, but can't decide what to get. This means that he doesn't know much about his wife's interests or preferences. Therefore, option A (going golfing all day) is unlikely because it shows no effort to understand his wife better. Option B (giving her cash) might seem like an easy solution, but it doesn't take into account their relationship dynamics or personalities. It's possible that she wouldn't appreciate receiving money directly without any thoughtful consideration of her needs or desires. Thus, we can conclude that the most likely outcome is option B - giving her cash.
Response:  My brother got a ticket, but he didn't go to court. This means that he missed his chance to contest the ticket in court. Now, if he gets pulled over again, he could be charged with failure to appear in court, which can lead to an arrest warrant being issued against him. So, option B is the more likely outcome - the judge will indeed convict my brother of failure to appear in court.
Response:  Tim wanted to connect more with nature. That means he wants to be closer to nature. Building a treehouse in the middle of the forest would allow him to do just that! Option B is therefore the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Ted's parents told him to focus on his studies and not on games. This implies that they are disapproving of his interest in gaming. Option A suggests that they eventually relent and allow him to pursue his passion for gaming, which goes against their initial stance. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Tammy dropped her kids off at school, then she donated blood. This means that after giving blood, she had lost some of her blood volume. Then, she drank some juice to refuel before running errands. This suggests that she was feeling weak or lightheaded from losing blood. Finally, she went to the gym for an aerobics class. However, if she was already feeling weak or lightheaded from giving blood, it would be dangerous for her to engage in strenuous exercise like aerobics. Therefore, option B is more likely: Tammy kept working out despite feeling unwell."
"Response: 
The story states that Abigail takes a walk every day, both in the morning and evening. This suggests that she has mobility and can walk without any issues. Therefore, option B is unlikely as it implies that Abigail cannot walk or needs assistance. Option A is more plausible as it aligns with the information provided in the passage."
"Response:  The story states that Eddie ""felt different"" from others, which could mean many things (e.g., he has a unique personality or perspective). However, when he hears a voice in the elevator, it implies something extraordinary happened. Option A suggests that this event may have been caused by a medical condition like schizophrenia, but there's no evidence for that yet. On the other hand, option B offers a more positive interpretation‚Äîperhaps Eddie found a supportive companion who helps guide him through life! So based on available information, I would choose option B as the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that someone had hit Jay's car and drove away without leaving any contact information or even stopping to check if anyone was injured. This suggests that it may have been an accident caused by carelessness or distraction rather than malice. Additionally, the fact that the damage is limited to the rear bumper implies that the impact was not too severe.
Given these factors, option B (Jay had a good laugh) seems more plausible as it suggests that Jay found the situation amusing rather than angry. After all, who gets angry over a minor fender bender? It's much more likely that he would chuckle at the absurdity of the situation and move on with his day."
Response:  If the gas leak went undetected until it ignited, then when the family came back from work, they would have found nothing but rubble where their house used to be. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Why would Carmen want to make a healthier version of pizza if she didn't like it in the first place? Therefore, option A is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
Rufus noticed that his nails were growing too long... (1)...he decided to cut them one night. (2)...when he was finally finished, he felt relieved. (3)...So option B is the correct answer because it matches the information given in the passage."
"Response: 
Herman was very hungry, so he searched his house for spare change. This means that he didn't have any money at first. Then, he found a quarter under the couch and a dollar in his dresser. That adds up to $1.25. Now, let's consider where Herman went after finding this money. According to the passage, he walked to the store. This implies that the store is nearby, which suggests that Herman doesn't have enough money to buy much food. Given these circumstances, option B (Herman managed to buy some food to make a small meal) seems more likely than option A (Herman decided he wasn't hungry anymore). Therefore, the answer is (B)."
Response:  Kelly has missed her flight, so option B is more likely. She will have to reschedule her trip or find an alternative way to reach her destination. Option A is not possible since she missed her flight.
"Response: 
The story says that everyone loves grandma's peach pie, which means they enjoy eating it. It also mentions that she makes them from the peaches grown in her own orchard, so she must be the one who grows the peaches too. This implies that the children are not responsible for growing the peaches themselves. Therefore, option A is incorrect, as it suggests that grandma had to pick the peaches herself.
So, let's choose option B: They were excited to bring the peaches to grandma. This ending fits well with the rest of the story, as it shows that the children are eager to contribute to making grandma's delicious pie."
"Response: 
Candice loved tacos but they were not very good. This means that Candice has a lot of room for improvement in terms of improving her taco recipe. Therefore option B is more likely because it implies that Candice will get better at making tacos which aligns with the situation described above."
"Response: 
The first part of the story states that Tony likes art. This means that he has an interest in it. However, when he goes to college, he takes four years worth of art classes. This suggests that he may not have been very good at art or had much talent for it. If this is the case, it would be unlikely for him to get a job as an artist after graduating. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  The story mentions that Jenny's parents got divorced, which means she may have felt sad or upset about it. Then, the family had to move into a small apartment due to financial difficulties, which could be stressful for anyone. Additionally, there were roaches in their new home, which might make them feel uncomfortable or even scared. Furthermore, since they didn't have enough money, they had to rely on a food bank for meals, which can be embarrassing or difficult to adjust to. Based on these details, option B (Jenny was unhappy) seems more plausible than option A (Jenny was thrilled).
Response:  Bill wanted to lose weight, but was not able to do it because of lack of initiative. Then something changed and he started meeting his goals every week. This means that option A (he finally reached his ideal weight) is more likely than option B (he gave up after a month). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response: 
The little girl was pushed into the pool, which means she didn't go in voluntarily. This means that Option A (the little girl was saved by her dad) is more likely since it fits with the situation described. Therefore, we should choose Option A as our answer."
Response:  Firstly, it is not appropriate or respectful to call someone you don't know over just because they are sitting near you in a public place. Secondly, even if she did come over, it would be weird to talk to a stranger for hours without any mutual acquaintance or common interest. Lastly, it is important to respect people's boundaries and personal space, especially when it comes to strangers. Therefore, option A (The woman told me to leave her alone) is the more likely outcome of this situation.
"Response: 
The story states that Cindy has been driving for a few months but has never driven in the rain before, which means she lacks experience with wet roads. Therefore, option B is more likely - Cindy was very experienced."
"Response: 
If you wrote a booklet with interesting facts, there are several ways this could go. You might make some money selling it, especially if people find it entertaining or useful. However, there's also a chance that people won't be interested in buying something like this, and you may not sell many copies. In this case, option A is more likely.
On the other hand, if you were embarrassed by what you created, you might feel ashamed about selling it. Maybe you don't want to admit that you spent time compiling random facts and selling them for profit. This could lead to feeling embarrassed or regretful about your decision. Option B seems more plausible in this scenario."
Response:  Bob found a camera at a thrift store that was worth $5000, but it only cost him $5. This means he got an incredible deal. However, there are two possible endings to this story: Option A or Option B. Option A suggests that Bob immediately purchased the camera without hesitation, recognizing its value. This makes sense since he already knew the camera was worth a lot more than what he paid for it. On the other hand, Option B suggests that Bob immediately ran out to buy film for the camera, which doesn't make much sense given the situation. Since Bob already had the camera in his possession and didn't need any additional supplies right away, Option A is the most likely ending to the story.
"Response: 
Rover likes playing fetch with his owner, so he will do whatever it takes to get the ball back once it has been thrown. Therefore, option A (He fetched the ball and brought it back to his owner) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
If my mom saw that the sign said ""Train approaching,"" she would have stopped her car before reaching the tracks. Therefore, option B (my mom slammed on the brakes just in time) is the correct answer."
Response:  Kelly worked at Cedar Point for the summer. If she found $20 on the ground, it means that someone might have lost it. So, it would be nice of her to give it back to its rightful owner. Giving the money to the security booth ensures that it reaches the person who lost it. Now, let's consider option A. According to this option, Kelly was fired for being dishonest. However, we know that Kelly did the right thing by giving the money to the security booth. It doesn't make sense to fire her for doing something good. Therefore, option A is not the most likely outcome. On the other hand, option B suggests that Kelly used the money to treat all her friends to ice cream. This is a more plausible scenario since Kelly found the money and decided to use it for something enjoyable. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the story, option B is the most likely ending.
Response:  Alan wanted to test his typing speed, so he went to an online testing site. This means that he probably used a computer or laptop for the test. Therefore, option B (It helped him get a job in construction) is unlikely because there are no computers or laptops involved in construction work. Option A (It helped him get a job in an office) is more plausible since offices typically require typing skills. So, the answer is option A.
"Response: 
Option A says Anne wore her gray hair with pride, which means she embraced her natural beauty without trying to change it. This is a common choice for people who want to embrace their age and wisdom rather than hiding it. It also shows that Anne values self-acceptance and confidence over societal expectations of youthful appearance. Therefore, Option A is the most likely ending to the story."
Response:  Connie was invited to a party where the music was strange and people were dancing oddly. This made her uncomfortable enough that she wanted to leave right away. Therefore, option A (She was freaked out the whole way home) is the most likely outcome.
Response:  The state requires cars to pass an annual safety inspection, which includes checking tires, brakes, suspension, etc. If your modifications caused any of these systems to fail the inspection, then option B (having to sell the car in another state) is more likely. It's unlikely that you could simply register the car without making any necessary repairs or modifications to bring it up to code.
"Response: 
The story states that Trent and his family were on a road trip, which means they were driving from one place to another. It also mentions that Trent took his turn to drive, but then fell asleep. This could be dangerous while driving, especially if he was driving on a busy highway or in an area where there are sharp turns or steep cliffs. If Trent fell asleep while driving, it is possible that he might have driven off the road or into another vehicle, resulting in an accident. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Brandon lives in Clearwater, which means he is close to the ocean. This implies that he already spends time around water. Getting a fishing license suggests that he wants to spend more time on or near the water, but it doesn't necessarily mean he will become a regular fisherman. It could simply be an interest of his. Therefore, option A is not the most likely outcome. 
On the other hand, getting a fishing license does suggest that he might want to try out different activities involving water. Surfing is one such activity, as it involves riding waves on a board. Given this context, option B seems like the more likely outcome. So, the answer is (B) Brandon then became a surfer."
Response:  Since Randy looked carefully at the engagement rings, it means that he had an interest in buying one of them. Moreover, since he noticed a particularly beautiful ring with a large diamond in the center, it suggests that he found it attractive. Therefore, option A (Randy bought the ring) seems like the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
The story states that ""My girlfriend loves the opera"" which means she has an interest in it, right? So option (B) is more likely as it aligns with this information. Additionally, the author mentions having a good time, which also supports option (B). Therefore, the answer is (B) - The performers were really talented and the music was beautiful."
"Response: 
Reasoning:  We know from the information provided that Shay agreed to go into work on a Saturday despite wanting her weekend off. This suggests that she may have felt obligated or committed to her job. However, when she saw that she received overtime pay for that day, it could indicate that she values her hard work and feels fairly compensated. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Shay was happy that she went into the office."
"Response: 
The story says that Cinnamon was getting old and frail, which means she was no longer able to do things like she used to. This could be due to age or illness. As a result, she may have been experiencing physical discomfort or pain. In this situation, it would be understandable for the family to decide to put her down, rather than letting her suffer. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
Response:  The story states that the person danced ballet for 11 years and loved it. This means they had been consistent in their practice and dedication towards ballet. Now, when they want to move on to pointe shoes, which are more challenging than regular ballet shoes, their instructors tell them they aren't ready yet. This could be due to various reasons such as lack of strength, technique or flexibility. So, option B is the most likely outcome - the person will keep trying and eventually excel at pointe ballet shoes after working hard and improving their skills.
Response:  We know that May is Harry's favorite month, he has his birthday during this time, and he goes to visit his friend Mary who lives in the countryside. This suggests that Harry enjoys spending time with Mary. Therefore, option A (Harry loves Mary) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  We know from the text that Gina hates running and everything related to it. So, option B is more likely because we can imagine Gina crying after being forced to do something she dislikes.
"Response: 
The story states that there were only two hours of daylight left, so we know time is running short. Then, it mentions that the mower was out of gas. This means that even if we had enough time, we wouldn't be able to use the mower because it needs fuel. Next, the story says it started to rain. This makes it even less likely that we will be able to mow the lawn, as cutting grass in the rain can be difficult or impossible depending on how heavy the rain is. 
Based on these factors, option A (I couldn't mow the lawn) seems like the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Susan parked at a rest stop, saw a strange man looking at her intently, and felt uneasy. She quickly left and drove to the next rest stop. Now, which option is more likely?

Option A: Susan used the facilities to relieve herself and then rested.
This makes sense as people often use rest stops for their basic needs like using the bathroom or taking a quick nap before continuing their journey. It's unlikely that Susan would drive all the way back to the previous rest stop just to talk to the strange man again.

Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  When the driver (grandpa) slams on the brakes, it means he tried to stop the car quickly. This means that we are very close to the point where the fox crossed the road. So option B is more likely because if they were able to stop in time, they would have seen the fox running across the road. Option A is less likely since there is no reason why the fox would jump onto their dirtbike after crossing the road.
Response:  The story states that every summer, Brad and Ashley go swimming together in the river. This means they have been doing it for a while now. Then comes the part where Ashley breaks her leg, which means she cannot join them in the river this time around. Now, let's consider what might happen next. Option A suggests that Ashley tells Brad to go ahead without her, but why would she do that? It doesn't make sense for her to encourage Brad to enjoy himself without her when she could just as well stay home and recover from her injury herself. Option B, on the other hand, provides a more plausible explanation - that Ashley will spend her summer riding her bike instead of going swimming. This way, she can still engage in an activity she enjoys (riding her bike) even though she cannot go swimming with Brad. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
The story states, ""He was trying to do his route fast to get home early today."" This implies that Sam has an important reason for wanting to finish his work quickly. It also suggests that he may be feeling pressure or stress about meeting his deadline.
Moreover, the sentence ""He drove so fast he didn't see a pothole in the road"" indicates that Sam was not paying attention to the road while driving. This could have been due to his hurry to complete his route.
Now, consider option A: ""Sam was happy that he disabled his mail truck."" This does not make sense in the context of the story. If Sam had wanted to disable his truck, he would have done it intentionally rather than accidentally hitting a pothole. Therefore, this option is unlikely.
Moving on to option B: ""Sam's head hit the steering wheel."" This is a more plausible outcome given the situation described in the story. When Sam hit the pothole, there is a good chance that he lost control of the vehicle and his head collided with the steering wheel. So, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
The story states that John likes a girl at his workplace. He tries to get her attention by acting silly, which suggests that he may be interested in her romantically. However, when she tells him to ""grow up,"" it implies that she does not return his feelings or finds his behavior childish.
Given these details, option A (John was happy about being rejected) seems unlikely because John would likely feel disappointed or hurt if the girl did not reciprocate his feelings. Instead, option B (the girl found this charming and gave him a second chance) seems more plausible as it suggests that the girl may have been flattered by John's attempts to impress her, even though they were unconventional."
"Response: 
Option A says that she begins brainstorming a new ice cream recipe, which means she wants to continue making more ice creams after enjoying the one she made on her birthday. It seems unlikely that she would throw away something she just enjoyed eating and want to make again. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The premise of the story is that Miriam was always argumentative, but her mother told her it was a bad habit. This implies that Miriam's constant arguing may have caused problems in her personal relationships or social interactions. However, despite this tendency, Miriam went on to become a lawyer. This suggests that she must have developed some skills or strategies for dealing with conflict or disagreements in a more constructive way. Therefore, option B (Miriam became a very successful lawyer) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Gina and her friends were given permission to go to the library, but when they arrive at the library, they find the door locked. This means they are not inside the library yet. Therefore, option A (the girls starting to dance) does not make sense because there is no reason for them to be dancing if they haven't even entered the library yet. Option B (the girls showing their passes) makes more sense as it implies that the teacher wants to check their passes before allowing them entry into the library. So, the correct answer is option B."
"Response: 
The story states that ""our bus broke down"" while on the way to the destination. This means that something unexpected happened during the journey, which could have caused delays or cancellations of the field trip. Therefore, option B (the bus never arrived, and they missed their field trip) is more likely than option A (the field trip went very well as they had hoped)."
Response:  The story states that none of the people in your family could tell you what toppings they wanted, so it seems unlikely that they would all eat vegetables (Option A). It also says that everyone kept changing their minds, which suggests that they were being difficult or indecisive (Option B), making Option B the more likely answer.
"Response: 
Alice woke up late, so she was in a hurry to get ready for her presentation. This means that she might have been flustered or stressed about being late. Therefore, option A (Alice was a mess during her presentation) is more likely."
Response:  The story states that Gina took her brother's ice cream without permission, and now he wants it back but she refuses to give it to him. This indicates that Gina acted selfishly and disrespectfully towards her brother. When their mother found out, she scolded Gina and made her return the ice cream to her brother. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of this story - Gina got in trouble for her actions.
Response:  We know that Amber practiced her hitting skills for several weeks, so it makes sense that she would have gotten better at hitting over time. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome - Amber slowly developed into a pretty good hitter.
Response:  The story states that Gina's grandfather had a heart attack and died, which means he passed away. This event occurred while they were visiting their grandma, so it's unlikely that Gina would have a good time during this sad occasion. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story starts with ""On Christmas morning, I woke up at 5 AM like when I was a child."" This suggests that the speaker has fond memories of Christmases past and enjoys the holiday. Additionally, the speaker makes hot chocolate for themselves and their husband, which implies that they are looking forward to spending time with loved ones during the holiday.
Based on these details, it is more likely that the speaker will choose option B, ""It was a great morning,"" rather than option A, ""I hated Christmas."""
Response:  Jim got cut from the team during tryouts, which means he didn't make it. However, instead of giving up, he works hard over the off-season to improve his skills. This shows that he has a strong desire to succeed and prove others wrong. Therefore, option A (Jim makes the team the next time) is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
Step 1: Cutting off unnecessary expenses will reduce Mary's spending. This means she has more money available for saving each month. 
Step 2: Saving all her money in a savings account means that Mary is earning interest on her savings. This means she has even more money available for paying off her debt. 
Based on these two steps, option A (Gradually, Mary was able to pay off her debt) seems like the most likely outcome. Therefore, we choose Option A."
"Response: 
In this situation, John has lost his homework and doesn't have any evidence that he did the work. If he turns in the paper scraps as his homework, his teacher might suspect him of cheating or lying. Therefore, option A is not the most likely outcome.
On the other hand, if John doesn't know what to do, he might try to find another way to complete the assignment or ask for help from his teacher or classmates. Option B seems more plausible in this scenario."
"Response: 
Tommy and Billy started a lemonade stand together, which means they are partners. As partners, they should share the profit equally. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Tori ate the candy ""as fast as she got it."" This implies that she was in a hurry to consume all the candy she could find, without stopping to savor any of it. Additionally, the story mentions that her stomach hurt soon afterward. These details suggest that Option A (Tori fell ill because of eating too much candy) is the more likely outcome. Therefore, the answer is (A)."
"Response: 
Beverly left her small town to start fresh somewhere new. This suggests that she wants to escape something or someone from her past. The fact that she thinks everything is big in Texas also implies that she doesn't know much about the place. Given these factors, it is more likely that she will feel overwhelmed and homesick than find success and happiness in the big city. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  We know that John felt worse in the morning, but after getting up and having breakfast, he started feeling better. This suggests that perhaps he just needed some food and rest to shake off whatever was bothering him. Therefore, option A (John had a nice day off of work) is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
Sally likes pizza night on Fridays, but she doesn't like cheese. So, option A is unlikely because it suggests that Sally would order her own pizza instead of eating the cheese pizza provided by the family.
On the other hand, option B is more plausible since Sally might be happy to see cheese pizza despite not liking cheese. It's possible that she enjoys the taste or texture of cheese even though she doesn't like it in general. Therefore, we can conclude that the most likely ending to the story is option B."
"Response:  The student says ""I caught a fever from being in the rain for several minutes."" This implies that they were outside during the rain, which means they could have been exposed to cold temperatures or wet conditions. Additionally, the fact that they say ""I've never had a worse day"" suggests that this event was particularly unfortunate. Therefore, option B (I've never had a worse day) is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Felipe went on a trip to Oregon and had a good time there. This means that he enjoyed himself in Oregon. Therefore, option A (Felipe immediately starts planning the next trip) is the more likely outcome. "
"Response:  We know that Ed challenged his brother to a basketball game, which means they were playing against each other. Since it was a friendly match, we can assume that neither of them wanted to win at all costs; instead, they just wanted to have fun and enjoy themselves. So, when the score was almost tied, there was no reason for either of them to try particularly hard or make any risky moves. In fact, given their friendly nature, they might even have been trying not to lose on purpose! Therefore, option (B) makes more sense here - Ed probably didn't make a slam dunk with the intention of winning the game but rather as part of an effort not to lose too badly."
"Response: 
Lary is a poor coal miner, so he doesn't have much money or resources. He works hard every day just to make ends meet. Finding a vein of gold ore would be life-changing for him, as it could provide him with financial security and a better life for himself and his family. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice - Lary would be happy and excited about finding the gold ore."
"Response:  The story states ""He decided to trade it in and buy a new one."" This implies that Jim will be getting rid of his current car and replacing it with a newer model. Option A does not make sense here as it goes against what the story says. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states that Nick's dog ""was not well-socialized."" This means that the dog had difficulty interacting with other dogs in a friendly manner. Given this information, it is unlikely that Sam (or anyone else) would be amused by the dog's behavior. Instead, they might find it annoying or even disturbing. Therefore, option A is incorrect.  On the other hand, option B makes more sense given the situation described in the story. Since the dog was not well-socialized, it may have been difficult for him to interact peacefully with other dogs during the walk. As a result, Nick may decide to take his dog to a trainer who can help socialize the dog better and improve its interactions with other animals. So, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
1) The fact that Earl is a grandfather for the first time means he has a positive relationship with his daughter. If they didn't get along, he wouldn't be excited about being a grandparent. 
2) Since he saved money for his granddaughter, he must have a good relationship with his daughter. Why else would he save money without telling her? 
3) Now consider why he surprised his daughter with the savings account. It was because he wanted to make her happy. This shows their relationship is strong enough where he can surprise her in this way. 
Based on these points, option B (His daughter now adds to it, for her daughter's college) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Mosh rushed out with his little sister in his arms, so he survived the explosion. Therefore, option A is the correct answer - Mosh was indeed relieved to be alive."
"Response:  The speaker says ""not the kind for mail"" which implies that they are aware of the common use of postage stamps, so option A is unlikely. Additionally, the speaker mentions their girlfriend having ""different cute ones"", which suggests that she already has a collection of stamps. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will choose option B, buying her sexy lingerie instead."
Response:  First, Jake opens the fridge in search of food. Since there is no other food inside, it means that Jake has already eaten everything else in the house. So, option B is more likely - Jake throws the sandwich away after making it.
Response:  Since Elda wanted to make french fries, it means that she has experience with cooking. And since she took the time to slice the potatoes and drop them in hot oil, it suggests that she wants her fries to be perfect. Therefore, option A (Elda's french fries were perfectly cooked) is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
Matt is training for a half-marathon. He injures his knee in a slip near the time of the race. This means he misses the race and needs extensive rehabilitation. Afterward, he resumes training. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer because it implies that Matt will participate in another marathon after completing his rehabilitation."
"Response: 
Susie loved her grandma's banana bread, but when she asked her grandma to send some, her grandma didn't respond right away. This made Susie sad because she really wanted to eat the banana bread. Then, a week later, Susie's grandma surprised her by coming to visit! This means that Susie's grandma must have been planning to come see her all along, even though she didn't answer Susie's request right away. So, option A (Susie was happy) is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Jon and Mika wanted a baby daughter but unfortunately, their baby had complications after being born. This means that option A (the baby was actually a boy) is unlikely because there is no indication in the story that this happened. Therefore, we can conclude that option B (the baby grew up to be healthy and strong) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Why did Mike move his chair when Brendon was standing? To make him fall, of course! So option B is the correct answer - Brendon couldn't believe he was soaking wet after falling due to Mike's prank.
Response:  We know that Cara wanted to get rid of the clutter in her garage, so she planned a garage sale. This means she probably wants to sell some things at the sale. Option A says she did just that, selling many items. Therefore, we can conclude that option A is more likely.
Response:  If you are inside a haunted house, it means there is something scary happening before reaching the end. So option A (A witch jumping out) seems more plausible than option B (They were having a Christmas party). Therefore, we should choose Option A as the correct answer.
Response:  Lorraine wants to make biscuits like her mother did, so she takes time off of work to focus on this task. This means that she must be very passionate about making these biscuits. Then, when she finally makes one for her mother and her mother says it tastes good, Lorraine should feel pleased or happy. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  We know that Lucy loves writing poems, so she will definitely try her best to make a good poem for her mom. And we also know that Lucy's mom is unhappy, which means she needs something to cheer her up. So it is more likely that the poem will make her mom feel better. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  If they are three hours late, it means that the food has been sitting out for at least three hours before they arrived. This would make the food cold. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Jake started vlogging, but he didn't get much attention. So, option A is unlikely because if Jake was getting much attention from his vlogs, he wouldn't have switched to doing skits. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Jake hoped no one would view his skits."
Response:  If the horse falls from the truck onto Jackie's car window, it will probably break the glass of the window. So option A is more likely.
Response:  Kelly and her friends went to an Indian restaurant, which means they enjoyed the food there. If they didn't like it, they would have said something negative about it or left without returning. Since they did come back multiple times, it's more likely that they liked the food and had a positive experience at the restaurant. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Levi helped pour the wax into the molds, which means he must have been involved in the process from start to finish. This suggests that they actually made the candles and not just bought them. Therefore, option A (They burned their candles that evening) is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that ""the screen was cracked"" after taking the TV out of the box, which suggests that the TV was damaged during transportation or handling. This raises the possibility that the damage may not have occurred at the store where the purchase was made. Therefore, option B (returning the TV) seems more plausible than option A (being happy with the TV)."
Response:  The story states that Dennis initially did poorly in the competition and fell off a lot. This suggests that he may not have been doing well early on. However, later in the competition, he improved significantly. If this is the case, then it is possible that he could have caught up with other competitors or even overtaken them towards the end of the competition. Therefore, option A (Dennis won the competition) is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
In this scenario, Ben started a compost pile using his old plants that didn't grow well, along with some leaves from around his yard. He let it sit over winter, which means he did nothing to it for several months except add more material as needed (like when he saw dead leaves or other organic matter). When spring came, he could have used that rich soil amendment to improve any new beds he wanted to create - maybe even planted vegetables directly into it! So option A seems like the most plausible choice here since adding all those nutrients through decomposition would likely lead to better growth later on rather than just having an unused pile of rotting trash somewhere nearby."""
Response:  If Joe was really hungry, he would have looked for something to eat first instead of ordering a pizza without checking if there was anything else available at home. So option A is unlikely. Now let's consider option B. It makes sense that Joe might be so hungry that he can't wait for the delivery person to leave, but it also seems like an impulsive decision that could lead to trouble (e.g., getting into trouble with the delivery person or having leftovers). Therefore, option B is also unlikely. The most likely outcome is that Joe will call someone to bring him food or go out to buy something himself.
"Response: 
Ending Option A: ""He came back with the popcorn."" This option means that Jason successfully retrieved the popcorn from home and returned it to his friends, ready to be enjoyed during the movie. It's the most logical choice given the situation. 
Ending Option B: ""He then threw the popcorn in the trash."" This option doesn't make sense in this context. Why would Jason throw away the popcorn he just went out of his way to retrieve? It goes against the flow of the story and doesn't align with Jason's actions or motivations. Therefore, we can confidently rule out this option as the correct answer."
Response:  Mary wants to have a party at her apartment, so she invites her friends. They bring food and drinks as gifts. This means they will be sharing their time and resources with Mary, which suggests that they are being generous and kind. Therefore, option A (It was the best New Year's Eve party ever) is more likely.
"Response:  The story says that Jim went to the wetlands with a ""giant"" gun, which implies that he has an excessive amount of firepower compared to what would be necessary or appropriate for hunting geese in a wetland area. This suggests that Jim may not have been thinking rationally about how much force he needed to use on the geese. Additionally, shooting two hundred birds out of a flock of hundreds is unlikely to result in anything other than chaos and suffering for the animals involved. Therefore, option B is more likely - Jim was frightened by his own actions and the harm he caused to the geese."
"Response: 
Option A states that Janice bought ""plenty"" of blouses. This implies that she purchased multiple blouses beyond just one or two. Given this detail, it seems unlikely that she would wear a ripped shirt the very next day (Option B). Instead, it's more plausible that she will continue to wear her new khaki pants with different blouses. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
"Response: 
Juanita woke up early for a canoe ride on the lake. (1) She loved peacefully rowing the canoe before anyone else was awake. (2) This morning she was shocked to see a stork flying across the lake. (3) As she took a picture, she lost her balance and fell into the water. (4) Now we have two options: either Juanita climbed back into the boat or she continued to take pictures. So let's analyze each option separately: Option A: Juanita climbed back into the boat. In this case, Juanita would have quickly gotten out of the water after falling in, probably using the canoe as a flotation device until she could stand safely again. From there, she might have paddled back to shore or called for help if needed. While it's possible that Juanita could have climbed back into the boat without any trouble, it seems more likely that she would need some assistance given how unexpectedly she found herself in the water. Option B: Juanita continued to take pictures. In this scenario, Juanita would have kept taking photos of the stork while still submerged in the water. However, this doesn't seem very plausible since taking pictures requires both hands and stability, neither of which Juanita had at the moment due to being underwater! It also raises safety concerns; if she were holding onto something like a camera while unconscious or struggling to stay afloat, there could be an increased risk of injury from hitting rocks or other obstacles nearby. Therefore, based on these factors, I believe Option A - Juanita climbed back into the boat - is more likely than Option B - Juanita continued taking pictures."
Response:  We know that Jody works hard, so she must be doing something right. And if her boss notices her effort, it means he values her contributions. Therefore, option B (Jody becomes a manager) is more likely because it shows that her hard work has led to recognition and reward from her employer.
"Response: 
The story states that Charlie ""loved food."" This implies that Charlie has an insatiable appetite. It also says that Charlie is small, which means he doesn't have much energy or strength to cause trouble. Therefore, option A - causing more problems - is unlikely. 
Instead, we are left with option B - Charlie changes his bad habits. Since Charlie loves food so much, it makes sense that he might learn to control himself around mealtimes. Perhaps he learns to wait patiently until his owners give him food instead of stealing from them. Or maybe he learns to enjoy healthier snacks like fruits and vegetables. Either way, this outcome seems more plausible given what we know about Charlie's character."
Response:  The situation described sounds like it could be a minor conflict at work, but it doesn't seem severe enough to result in termination. Therefore, option A (her boss apologizing) seems more likely than option B (Sue being fired).
Response:  We know that Nora wants to have a nice time at the cabin. Since she enjoys having picnics near the stream, it makes sense that she would want to do this again during her vacation. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states that Marcy has difficulty communicating with strangers because of her hearing impairment. This means that when she encounters someone new, she may struggle to understand what they are saying or expressing themselves effectively. 
Now consider option A: ""She thanked her friend for the advice."" If Marcy thanks her friend for suggesting using pen and paper to communicate, it suggests that she finds the solution helpful in improving her communication with others. However, there is no indication in the story that Marcy's friend suggested anything else beyond providing pen and paper. Therefore, option A seems unlikely given the information provided in the story. 
On the other hand, option B: ""Marcy stopped talking to her friend"" does not align with the narrative either. There is no reason to believe that Marcy would stop speaking to her friend simply because her friend suggested using pen and paper as a means of communication. In fact, the story highlights their close relationship, which implies that Marcy values her friendship with her friend. So, option B also appears less plausible based on the details presented in the story."
"Response:  The story states, ""Schnauzers usually don't live that long."" This implies that schnauzers typically do not live as long as other breeds, which means that Fancy is already an exceptional case among her own kind. Additionally, the fact that Sharon has had Fancy since she was a puppy suggests that they have formed a strong bond over time. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Sharon would want Fancy to leave anytime soon. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Keith lives in an area with occasional earthquakes. This means there is some probability of earthquakes occurring in this region. However, we don't know how frequently they occur or their intensity. It could be once every few years or multiple times per week, but mild enough not to cause significant damage.
Now, let's consider Option A: ""Keith's car then skidded off the road when an earthquake struck."" While it's possible for an earthquake to cause a vehicle to lose control on the road, it's unlikely that an earthquake would happen immediately after Keith cut his hand. Earthquakes are unpredictable natural disasters that can occur without warning, but they usually give people ample time to evacuate or seek shelter before they strike. Therefore, I believe Option A is less likely than Option B.
Moving on to Option B: ""Keith's yacht hit the reefs at high speed."" Yachts are typically large boats designed for recreational purposes, and they often travel at slower speeds due to safety concerns. Even if Keith were sailing at high speed, it's unlikely that he would experience such bad luck as hitting the reefs so suddenly. Moreover, the story doesn't mention anything about Keith owning a yacht, which makes Option B even more implausible.
In conclusion, based on the information provided in the story, Option A is less likely than Option B."
Response:  We know that Sean wanted to go on a picnic because he packed a basket with food. This means he was excited about eating outside. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Sean loves the outdoors.
"Response: 
Option A states that the son was difficult to take care of compared to Joy. However, this doesn't make much sense as there isn't any information provided about how easy or hard it was to take care of either child. It could be argued that having two children at once would double the workload for the parents, but without more context, we can't assume one child was easier than the other just based on their gender. Therefore, Option A is not the most likely answer.

Now let's consider Option B: ""The parents had another baby."" This option makes perfect sense given the situation presented in the story. After the parents had their first child, they were overjoyed, and then they decided to have another baby. This is a common scenario for many families, especially those who want to experience the joy of raising multiple children. So, Option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
In this situation, Chris did something wrong (stealing) and now he has to face the consequences. Option A says that Chris will beg for mercy, which means he wants the store owner to forgive him without facing any punishment. However, it's unlikely that the store owner would just let Chris go after he stole from them. It's more likely that Chris will have to pay for what he did, either by returning the gum or by facing legal action. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
Rene was at the arcade with a couple of friends on a Friday night, which means they were there for entertainment purposes. Since Rene forgot his wallet, he won't be able to pay for any games or other activities without money. This creates an inconvenience for him since he can't enjoy himself as planned. 
Jack notices that Rene doesn't have enough money and offers to lend him some cash. By doing so, Jack shows empathy towards Rene's situation and helps him out. It makes sense that Rene would accept Jack's offer given the circumstances. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
The story says that Neil saw ""so many delicious local foods"" and ""wonderful souvenirs."" This suggests that Neil enjoyed his time in Bangkok and had a positive experience. Therefore, option A (Neil stayed some extra days in Bangkok because of all the fun) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Why did Amy want to straighten her hair in the first place? Because she wants it to look neat and tidy, right? And why did she spend two hours doing it? So that it would stay straight for a long time! But then it started raining...which means her hair got wet again. This means all of her hard work straightening it was undone! Therefore, option A is the correct answer - Amy was probably devastated when this happened.
Response:  The speaker loves the restaurant, mentions they go there with their girlfriend frequently, and states that the staff knows what they order. This suggests a positive experience at the restaurant. Therefore, option B (the food being ready quickly) is more likely.
"Response:  The story says ""he didn't know if he would go back to work"". This implies that he might not want to go back to work after being shot. Option A is the correct answer because it shows that Mike laughed hysterically which means he found something funny, but it doesn't make sense for someone who is unsure of returning to work after being shot."
Response:  The story states that Tracy never believed in marriage, which means she had some reservations or doubts regarding it. However, after meeting Doug, her perspective changed, and she started believing in love again. This indicates that option B - Tracy's apprehensions about marriage were confirmed - is unlikely. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A - Tracy was happy with Doug.
"Response: 
Option A says that Joseph closed his eyes and picked a book randomly. However, this doesn't make sense as there are too many books in the library for him to pick just one without any context or criteria. It would be more likely for him to look through some reviews or ask someone for recommendations before making such an important decision. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Neil loved Dublin, which means he had a positive experience there. However, it also mentions that his favorite place was Trinity College, where he saw the ancient Book of Kells on display. This suggests that Neil found something specific and interesting at Trinity College, which could have been more enjoyable than other parts of his trip. Therefore, option B (Neil was bored of the trip and went home) is less likely, as there is no indication that Neil was not enjoying himself overall. Option A (He enjoyed his stay in the country) is therefore the more likely answer."
"Response: 
Ray loves spending time at the beach with his girlfriend. This means he enjoys being there. So option A is more likely - they both enjoy their day at the beach."
"Response: 
The story states that your friend called you last night because they had a flat tire and were stuck in the middle of the road. This means that they were unable to change the tire themselves, which suggests that they may have been alone at the time. However, the story also says that you went out in the middle of the night to help them, which implies that you were awake and available to assist them.
Given these details, it seems unlikely that you would leave your friend stranded after helping them fix their tire. Instead, it's more likely that you helped them change the tire and then returned home. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Why would someone be unhappy if they find that their frozen food has thawed due to a power outage? It doesn't make sense, does it? Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage is one where two people are competing against each other in a game. One of them (Harrison) has just scored a point, which means they have won the game. This would normally be a cause for celebration or excitement, as they have achieved their goal of winning the game. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer - Harrison was happy and excited."
Response:  If Sally won some gift cards, that means she has money on those cards to spend. So option A is more likely because if she had no money, there would be nothing for her to buy with the gift cards. 
Response:  We know that Fred started recording his daily activities in a diary. This means that he was motivated enough to make an effort to write down what he did every day. So option B is more likely - Fred enjoyed reading stories from his past. 
"Response: 
In this story, we are told that ""all the students"" loved the architecture and thought the food was great too. This suggests that everyone on the trip shared Sky's positive feelings about their experience. Therefore, it is more likely that Sky never wanted her trip to end (option B)."
"Response:  The story says ""Joss was afraid she and the new girl would not get along."" This suggests that Joss had some doubts about how things might go with the exchange student. However, then it says ""But when the girl arrived, they liked each other!"" This contradicts Joss's initial fears, so option B (Joss considers the exchange student to be like a sister) is more likely."
"Response: 
The story states that Joe and Mary invited their friends over for dinner and they all gathered in the kitchen to prepare pizza together. This already suggests a level of camaraderie among them, as they are willing to spend time cooking together. Then, as the pizza cooked, they started playing board games. This further indicates that they enjoy each other's company and have a good time together. Therefore, option B - ""They all had fun"" - is the more likely outcome."
Response:  The speaker says they love playing baseball, but find watching it boring. They also mention that their father enjoys watching it, which suggests a positive relationship there. Given this context, option B seems more likely - the speaker finds joy in sharing memories of their shared pastime with their father, rather than wishing for his passing.
Response:  The neighbor was asked to be quieter, but... (A)...they were stomping around again less than an hour later. This suggests that their noise level did not change significantly after being asked to be quieter. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Robbie wanted to buy a new hat, so he drove for an hour to reach the store where he could purchase it. This shows that he was really interested in getting this particular hat. Then, when he finally found the last one in stock, he tried it on and it fit him perfectly. This suggests that he was very pleased with how the hat looked and felt on him. Therefore, option A (He wore it every day) is the more likely outcome, as Robbie would be excited about his new hat and want to wear it frequently.
"Response: 
Neil visited dozens of pubs and drank dozens of pints, which means he was quite drunk. However, since he wanted to remember something important from his trip, it makes sense that he would try to avoid driving under the influence (option B). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  The story states that Francisco is jealous of his friends who go skiing, so he decides to learn how to ski himself. This means he has never tried skiing before and doesn't have any experience. Therefore, it is more likely that Option B (Francisco became a good skier) is the correct answer because it aligns better with the information provided in the story.
"Response: 
The story states that Sai's mother bought him a new sweater to make him feel better on picture day. This implies that Sai was feeling down about picture day beforehand. The story also mentions that Sai received many compliments on the new sweater, which suggests that he looked nicer than usual. Therefore, option B (Sal felt great) is the correct answer."
Response:  Since Alycia parked her car somewhere before going out with her friends, it would make sense that if it was moved after she left it, then it would have been moved to another location rather than back to its original spot. Therefore, option B (Surprise! They found it on the street she parked it) seems more likely as it provides an unexpected twist to the story.
"Response:  The story states that ""Katie's mother took very good care of"" the goat. This implies that the goat was in their backyard. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
The police received complaints from nearby residents, so they are likely to tell the bands to stop playing together. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  In a real-life tennis match, players don't use baseball bats to hit the ball. So option A is not possible. Now let's consider option B. If Bill almost missed the ball and still managed to hit it, then there must have been some space or time for Eric to react and return the shot. Therefore, option B is also unlikely. Based on these observations, we can conclude that the most likely ending to the story is neither option A nor B.
"Response: 
Gina's mother took her to the store because it was the first year that Gina could go back to school shopping with her mom. This means that Gina had never gone before, so she wouldn't have any idea what kind of clothes she needed or wanted. Therefore, option A is more likely since Gina would be excited about picking out new clothes. "
"Response: 
The woman fed the first squirrel peanuts. Then, many other squirrels came to eat the peanuts too. This means that option B (the squirrels began to come to her house more often) is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states, ""She was afraid that she would fall off her new bicycle."" This implies that learning to ride a bicycle can be challenging, especially if one is not familiar with it. Therefore, option B is more likely, which states, ""She soon learned to ride."""
"Response: 
Reasoning:  We know that Gina has detention, which means she did something wrong at school. Since she's trying to act cool while talking with her friends, it suggests that she doesn't want her parents to find out what happened. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Alicia was sad when her parents told her they were moving. This suggests that she likes where she lives currently. Therefore, option A (Then they moved to their new house) is unlikely because it implies that Alicia would be happy about moving away from her current home. Instead, option B (Alicia was happy to be leaving her old house) seems more plausible since it aligns with the information provided in the story."
Response:  The story states Brian was asked to watch his friend's dog, which means he has been entrusted with taking care of something valuable. This implies that Brian is reliable and responsible, so Option A (He was happy that his friends considered him trustworthy) is more likely.
"Response:  The person said they ""walked away"" when they put the chicken in the oven. This implies that they left it unattended for some time. Then they noticed a bad smell coming from the oven. Given these details, option A (the person ordering pizza) seems more plausible since they might have realized that the chicken was burnt beyond consumption after leaving it alone for too long. Option B does not make sense as there is no mention of a new raincoat being purchased or any other reason why someone would be excited about buying one at this moment."
Response:  We know from the information provided that Laura woke up early and made breakfast before leaving for school. This suggests that she has a routine and is organized. It is also possible that the teacher may have announced the cancellation of class earlier than usual, so Laura might have been prepared for this eventuality. Therefore, option B (Laura had a good day in class) is more likely.
"Response: 
In this scenario, Ray's daughter has just fallen from a height after the branch broke while she was playing on a makeshift swing made of a tire hanging from a rope. This is a dangerous and potentially harmful situation for her. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Ray will run to his daughter to make sure she is okay. He may also call for medical help if necessary. Option A is less plausible as laughing at such a situation would not be an appropriate or responsible reaction."
Response:  The story says they went to a bar, which means they were in a public place where people go to socialize or have fun. Then it says they opened a tab, which implies that they ordered some drinks. After that, it simply states that they had a few drinks without mentioning how many or what kind. Finally, it says they decided to close their tab, which suggests that they paid for whatever they drank. So far so good! However, there are two possible endings to this story: Option A: They went home talking about their night. This makes sense because after closing their tab, they would probably leave the bar and head back home. They might talk about their night with friends or family members, sharing stories of their experiences at the bar. Option B: They got on a plane. This doesn't make as much sense since there's no indication that the girls traveled anywhere by airplane. In fact, there's nothing in the story that suggests they left the city or even walked somewhere else. It seems unlikely that they would suddenly decide to get on a plane without any context or explanation. Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the story, option A is more likely.
Response:  If you didn't prepare for the speech, then you probably don't know much about the topic. Using big words and trying to sound smart may have helped you fool some of your audience, but they were probably not impressed with your lack of knowledge on the subject matter. In fact, they might have been turned off by your attempt to appear more intelligent than you actually are. So, option B is the most likely outcome - you stopped talking and went home because you realized that you couldn't deliver a convincing performance without proper preparation and knowledge.
"Response: 
The teacher asked Miss Jio why she thought Nate might need medication. ""He's been disruptive,"" she replied. ""I think he needs something to calm him down.""
Nate's parents were surprised when Miss Jio recommended medication without first trying other interventions like counseling or behavior modification. They decided to get a second opinion from another doctor before making any decisions about their son's treatment.
It is unlikely that the second doctor would suggest medication right away without exploring other options first. Therefore, option B is not the most likely outcome.
So, the answer is Option A: The doctor suggested that Jake attend counseling instead."
"Response:  The story says ""She loved the pasta"" which means she enjoyed eating there, so option B makes more sense as it shows a positive reaction to the closure of the restaurant. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) She invited all her friends to join her at another restaurant."
Response:  The narrator ran out of noodles, so they went to buy more at a store. This means that they will probably cook them when they get home. Therefore, option A (the narrator cooked the noodles) is the most likely answer.
Response:  Since Pete has to meet with his realtor, he must have an appointment scheduled with them. This means that he will need to have the contract available for signing at this meeting. Therefore, option A is more likely - he will find the contract in the garage.
"Response: 
Fred loves the amusement park, but he has never ridden a rollercoaster before because he is afraid of heights. However, one day he decides to confront his fear and ride the fastest and scariest rollercoaster in the park. This means that he must have faced his fear and overcome it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Wendy read the instructions wrong and applied too much product on her body which caused her skin to turn pink. This was an unexpected outcome for her. Now she wants to get rid of this problem as soon as possible. So, option (B) makes sense here because the company will give her a full refund and apologize for the inconvenience caused. Option (A) doesn't make sense in this scenario since Wendy isn't happy with the product after using it."
"Response: 
Jackson has never drunk any alcohol before so it would not make sense if he decides to have two beers right away. It would be more realistic if he just takes a sip or two to test the taste and then decide whether he wants to continue drinking or not. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
The frog was hungry for a late dinner. This means he wanted food at an unusual time of day (late). So option A is unlikely because it implies that the frog has already eaten a large meal. Instead, since the fly buzzed away when the frog approached, we can assume that the frog did not catch any food. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  Oscar never made his bed, so it would be unlikely that his mom would give him a dessert treat for finally doing something she had been asking him to do. Therefore, option B (She yelled at him) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  If you see a snake from afar, it means that it has noticed you too. So, option A (Then I ran towards the snake) is not the best choice because running will only provoke the snake into attacking you. It would be better to stay calm and slowly back away while keeping an eye on the snake. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B (The snake bit me).
Response:  Phil felt a rush when he won at blackjack for the first time, which means that option A (he was ecstatic over his gambling wins) is more likely. However, since he lost all his money quickly afterward, it suggests that he may have an addiction problem, which leads us to option B (he decided he needed to do something about his addiction). Therefore, both endings are possible but leaning towards option B as the more likely outcome.
Response:  My cousin asked me about a difficult moment in my life, so I shared with her some photos of when I was in the hospital as a leukemia patient. This information might make her feel sad or empathetic towards me, so option A (She cried and hugged me, admiring my bravery) seems more likely.
"Response: 
Matthew's mother was busy working on the computer, which means she had a lot of important tasks to complete. She didn't want to be distracted by Matthew's noise, so she told him to stop screaming and stomping around. This suggests that she values getting her work done and doesn't want to be bothered while doing it. Therefore, option A (Matthew's mother finished all of her work on the computer) is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Tine ""hoped"" she was fast enough, which implies some uncertainty about her abilities. It also mentions that she ran for miles every morning for a month before tryouts, which suggests that she put in a lot of effort to improve her speed. Therefore, option A (Tine made the team with the best time of anyone) is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  The story says ""This past time I went home"" which implies that the speaker has gone hunting before. Then it says ""I hunted at night"". Hunting at night is generally more difficult than during the day because of reduced visibility. So this suggests that the speaker is an experienced hunter who knows how to handle these conditions. Next, the story says ""I was quiet for a long time."" This means that the speaker waited patiently for a while without making any noise, indicating patience and caution. Now comes the interesting part - ""Finally, I saw something moving in the dark."" This could be anything from another human being to an animal, but since we are dealing with a hunting scenario, let's assume it's an animal. Option B is the most likely choice here as it fits best with the context provided in the story. Therefore, the answer is (B) It was a deer that I was able to stalk and shoot successfully."
"Response: 
Jack accidentally sat on a cactus while taking a photo. This means he got pricked by the spines of the cactus. The spines are sharp and can cause pain, swelling, and even infection if not removed properly.
Now, let's consider the situation: Jack has needles stuck in his pants, and he needs to continue climbing. In this scenario, it's unlikely that he would be able to climb comfortably with needles sticking out of his clothes. He might experience discomfort, pain, or even bleeding due to the friction caused by the needles rubbing against his skin.
Therefore, option A is more likely: it took 20 minutes to remove the needles and continue climbing."
Response:  The story states that Amy, Lynn, and Kim went to the store together. Then it says that while they were there, they saw Jim (Lynn's crush). This means that Jim works at the store where the girls are shopping. So far so good! Now here comes the interesting part - the story says that the girls stopped and talked to Jim for a while. That's great! But then it takes an unexpected turn when it says that Jim ASKED LYNN ON A DATE! Oh my gosh, this is not happening! I mean, why would Jim ask Lynn out after she has been staring at him from afar for who knows how long? It doesn't make sense! Therefore, option A is the most unlikely outcome of this situation.  Option B also seems highly unlikely because Lynn wouldn't tell her crush that he's ugly. She might be embarrassed or shy about expressing her feelings, but she wouldn't insult him like that. Nope, option A is the clear winner in this case.
Response:  The story states that Riley was not very popular at school. This implies that she may have been bullied or teased for how she looks. Now, if Riley agrees to a makeover with her friend, it could mean that she wants to change her appearance in order to fit in or be more accepted by her peers. However, if after the makeover, Riley still isn't well received by her classmates, then option B is the most likely outcome. Therefore, we should choose option B as the correct answer.
"Response: 
Ann is pregnant, which means she is expecting a baby. This is something that many people dream of and work towards their whole lives. It's natural to feel excited about such an event. However, things take a turn when Ann has a miscarriage. This can be a devastating experience for anyone who goes through it, as it involves the loss of something that was once expected to be a part of one's life. In this case, Ann is left feeling heartbroken and emotionally distraught after her miscarriage. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
Reasoning: From the information provided in the passage, we know that Aya wanted to be a model and thought she had a chance because she was thin and pretty. This suggests that she may have been confident or optimistic about her chances. However, when she actually won the contest, it might have come as a surprise to her, which could lead to feelings of happiness (option A) or disappointment (option B). Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Jared got days off from being grounded if he cleaned his room, but he didn't do it. So option B is more likely that his parents will throw him out of the house because he broke the rule.
Response:  The first sentence of the story states that Anna walked to school, which means she was a pedestrian. Therefore, option A is more likely since cars are required to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks. Additionally, the second sentence mentions that a car suddenly flew into the crosswalk and struck Anna, indicating that the driver was at fault for the accident. Finally, option B does not make sense as going to a club and dancing all night would not have any relation to the accident described in the story. So, based on these reasons, option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Why did Dave take a day off from work? To go to the beach, right? And why would he want to go to the beach if it's too dark? Because he wants to relax in the sunlight! So option B is the correct answer - Dave was so relieved that there were storm clouds blocking out the sun because now he can enjoy his day at the beach without getting burned.
"Response: 
Ron worked extra hours at work to save up money for their dream home. This means that he was sacrificing some of his free time to earn more money. However, it also means that he has less time to spend on other things like hobbies or leisure activities. So, option A (They purchased a nice home in a new neighborhood) is the most likely outcome because it aligns with the information provided in the passage."
Response:  If I had no computer, then how could I create any of those book covers in Photoshop? Therefore, option A is not possible. So, we are left with only one option - Option B. The most likely outcome is that most people will like Cover A.
Response:  We know that our cat is very picky, so if we buy her a new scratching post made of something other than sisal, she will probably reject it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - the cat will indeed reject the new post made of something other than sisal.
Response:  Why did Daniel want to become a writer in the first place? It must have been because he enjoyed writing, right? So option A can be ruled out immediately. Now let's consider option B. Daniel had to get an actual job because his website wasn't gaining enough traction or attention. This means that even though he wanted to write, he couldn't make it work financially. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage involves a basketball game, with Jeff having the ball and Gary being open for a shot. However, instead of passing the ball to Gary, Jeff ignores him and runs towards the hoop. This suggests that Jeff may be trying to score a personal basket, rather than passing the ball to a teammate who has an easier chance at scoring.

As for the two guards approaching Jeff, it could mean they are trying to steal the ball or defend against Jeff's move. Therefore, option A (the guards stole the ball from Jeff) seems more likely."
Response:  The story starts off well, describing a positive experience of going on a camping trip with Dad. It then mentions building a fire and making their own tents, which are all activities that require effort and skill. Finally, it ends with falling asleep while counting the stars, which suggests a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. Based on this information, option B (We had a wonderful time camping) seems like the more likely outcome.
Response:  The narrator goes to the market to buy some things that are on sale. They take several items and go through the checkout line. There is no indication in the passage that they have a bowling ball with them or anywhere else in their possession. Therefore, option B is unlikely because it does not make sense given the information provided in the passage. Option A is more plausible since the narrator seems happy about getting a good deal.
Response:  We know that Joey was laid off, which means she no longer has a job. This also means that she doesn't have any income coming in. Given these circumstances, it would be highly unlikely for her to spend her days playing video games without worrying about how to pay her bills or feed herself. Therefore, option A (Joey finally receives a call from an employer and gets the job) is the more realistic outcome of this situation.
"Response: 
The story states that Joe watched TV all the time and was lonely. This suggests that he did not have many social interactions or activities outside of watching TV. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it implies that meeting people through Craigslist has improved Joe's happiness by providing him with companionship. Option A does not provide any evidence to suggest that ordering new cable channels would improve Joe's happiness, so it is less likely."
"Response: 
Amy tried meditation for the first time in response to her friend's suggestion. This means she had no prior experience with meditation before this point. Therefore, option A - ""She started teaching meditation the next day"" - is unlikely because there is no indication that Amy had any interest or qualifications in teaching meditation after just one session. 
On the other hand, option B - ""It helped her mental state immensely"" - is more plausible given the context of the story. Meditation has been shown to have numerous benefits for mental health, including reducing stress and anxiety levels. So, it's possible that Amy experienced significant improvements in her mental well-being as a result of practicing meditation regularly."
"Response:  The story states that Nya ""decided"" to eat the fried chicken and mashed potatoes, which implies that it was a conscious choice. Then, the story says she ""ate the greasy, fatty food with relish,"" which suggests that she enjoyed it. However, there is no indication in the story that Nya felt any negative consequences from eating this way. In fact, the story simply states that she ""ate with relish."" Therefore, option B (Nya later regretted eating unhealthy food) is not supported by the information provided in the story. Option A (Nya decided to eat the same thing every day) is also not supported, as there is no mention of Nya repeating this behavior. So, the correct answer is neither option A nor B."
Response:  The story says that my roommate was sick in the morning. Then it says she stayed home from work and school. This means she didn't go out or do anything active during the day. Finally, it says she felt better at the end of the day. All these details suggest that my roommate recovered from her illness. So, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  We know that Ted and his friends went to the park to climb a mountain. This means they walked there from their starting point. So option (A) cannot be true because Ted did not get in his car and drive home after finishing the hike. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).
Response:  We know that the weather was very windy yesterday morning in Florida, and there was even a tornado warning issued for the area. This means that there was a high risk of a tornado occurring nearby. However, we don't actually know if a tornado touched down or not. Therefore, option A is the correct answer - it is possible but not certain that a tornado came within two blocks of the house. Option B is unlikely because going outside to play during a tornado warning would be extremely dangerous and foolish.
Response:  If you got a drawing instruction book as a gift, it means you wanted to learn how to draw. So option B is more likely - you went home and practiced drawing.
"Response: 
The story states that Lisa realized she didn't enjoy studying business and wanted to study art instead. However, she dropped out of school due to fear of not being able to make money. This implies that Lisa made a decision based on practical considerations rather than personal interests or desires. Therefore, option B (Lisa gets a degree in business) is more likely as it aligns with the rational thinking and societal expectations mentioned in the passage."
"Response: 
Option A states that when her parents caught her, Mary was grounded. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that Mary will be punished or have any negative consequences. It could simply mean that her parents are upset with her for breaking their rules and may take away some privileges. So, option A is not the most likely outcome.
On the other hand, Option B states that Mary's friends were very disappointed in her. This implies that Mary's actions may have caused problems in her relationships with her friends, which could lead to social isolation or loss of friendships. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Peter asked Ivy on an ""unconventional"" date, which suggests that he may not be the typical boyfriend material. Additionally, the fact that they went hiking in the woods together could indicate that Peter is outdoorsy or adventurous, but also potentially dangerous. 
Given these factors, it is more likely that option B (Ivy returns home and never speaks to Peter again) is the correct answer. This ending would suggest that Ivy realized that she made a mistake by going on the date with Peter and decided to cut ties with him before things could get any worse."
"Response: 
The man designed the plans for the tower, which means he must have had some knowledge of architecture and engineering. Therefore, option A (the man was not a building designer) is unlikely.
Now let's consider option B: ""The man built the tower and it was grand."" This could be possible if the man had a team of engineers and architects who helped him design and construct the tower. However, without more information about the man's qualifications or experience, it is difficult to say with certainty whether he would be able to build such a massive structure on his own. So, option B is also uncertain."
"Response: 
Lauren wants a picture with her sisters, so she poses in front of a cute cafe. This means that there is a good chance that she will receive a positive response from her sisters after sending them copies of the photo. Therefore, option A (She gawked at how much her and her sister look alike) is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states that ""He wanted to play hide and seek."" This implies that the child is actively participating in the game. It also says that Liz found him a few times but then he disappeared. This suggests that the child may have intentionally hidden himself. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  If Mark drove over the speed limit, he would have been late for work. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Amy ""told the teacher"" about wanting to play the flute, which implies that she expressed her desire at the beginning of the story. Then it says she practiced every day for a week, which suggests that she has been consistent in her efforts. Finally, it notes that playing the flute is difficult, which could imply that Amy faces challenges in mastering the instrument. Based on these details, option A (Amy was very committed) seems like the more likely outcome."
Response:  The story states that Bryan couldn't decide on any fruit in the entire aisle. This means he didn't find anything he liked or wanted to buy. Therefore, option A (Bryan buying pasta) is unlikely because there is no indication that he even considered it as an alternative. Option B (Bryan deciding to buy bananas) is more plausible since it suggests that Bryan made a decision after considering different options.
"Response: 
Option A states that Emily's child walked closer to the lions. However, if he was already scared and crying, it seems unlikely that he would want to get closer to something that scares him. Therefore, option B is more likely - Emily picked up her child to comfort him."
Response:  The story states that Kim practiced all day at home and in the gym after school with her team, which means she must be very determined and passionate about basketball. Therefore, option A (Kim scored a basket and got a puppy) is the most likely outcome. It would be illogical for Kim to practice hard and then fail to score a basket on the important day of the game. So, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  The story says that Karen's team wasn't doing very well, but then her coach gives an inspiring speech. This suggests that the team may have been struggling due to lack of motivation or effort. However, after the speech, everyone starts practicing and working much harder. This implies that the speech had a positive impact on the team's morale and performance. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome - Karen improves along with the team.
"Response:  We know that Kayla hasn't gone to any social events in years due to her anxiety issues. This means that she has been avoiding interactions with others because of how uncomfortable they make her feel. However, her brother takes her to see a therapist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders. This suggests that Kayla is taking steps towards seeking professional help for her condition. Now let's consider each option: Option A states that Kayla thought the date was the ""best one she'd ever had."" While this could be interpreted as a positive development, it doesn't necessarily mean that Kayla's anxiety has completely disappeared. It's possible that she simply enjoyed herself despite feeling anxious throughout the evening. Option B reveals that Kayla told the therapist she felt suicidal and requested assistance. Unfortunately, this outcome seems much more plausible given what we know about Kayla's situation. Anxiety can lead individuals to feel overwhelmed and hopeless at times, which may result in suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Given these factors, I believe Option B is the most likely conclusion to the story."
"Response: 
Ricky fell while hiking, which means he must have been walking through some rough terrain. This could mean that he may have slipped or tripped on something, causing him to fall. It's unlikely that he would be soaking wet from just falling into a patch of poison ivy, as it wouldn't absorb enough water to cause him to become fully submerged. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this scenario."
Response:  The story states that Blue Belle had a recall and stopped producing. Then it says that Blue Belle ice cream arrived at Kroger last week. This means that Blue Belle has been recalled and started producing again. So option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story says that Oni has never performed before an audience, which means he lacks experience. Moreover, the story states that he only gave it a ""best try,"" implying that he did not prepare well for the performance. Therefore, option B (the talent show told Oni to never come back) is more likely because Oni probably did not impress the judges or the audience with his poor performance."
"Response: 
The story states that Ralph hates shopping, so option A (Ralph's mom punishing him) seems unlikely since he would not want to be punished for something he dislikes doing. Option B (Ralph being surprised with money) seems more plausible as it aligns with the idea of rewarding someone for their efforts, which could motivate Ralph to help his mom in the future. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
"Response:  The story states that Kayla borrowed a book from her sister, which means she has siblings. Therefore, option A is incorrect because Kayla is not an only child. Now let's consider option B: ""Her sister was mad!"" This outcome seems plausible since Kayla accidentally damaged the book, and her sister might be upset about it. However, without additional information, we cannot know for sure how Kayla's sister will react. So, the correct answer is (B) Her sister was mad!"
"Response: 
Firstly, Lenny wants to watch a movie so he goes to the local Hollywood Video store. This means that he has already decided on watching a movie. Secondly, since he rents three horror movies, it implies that he is interested in watching those particular types of films. Thirdly, when he goes next door to buy a pizza, it suggests that he is hungry after watching the movies or planning to watch them later. Therefore, option A (He went back home and binge-watched all of his movies) is the most likely outcome as it aligns with the sequence of events provided in the story."
"Response:  Burning bras in the 1960s, while certainly a controversial act at the time, is not necessarily illegal or unethical today. However, it could be seen as offensive or insensitive to some people, particularly women who were subjected to societal pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations around clothing and appearance.
It is unlikely that Laura would be impeached solely based on this action, although it might raise questions about her judgment or suitability for public office. It is more likely that she would face criticism or scrutiny from certain quarters, but ultimately, her bid for presidency would depend on a range of factors beyond this one incident."
"Response: 
Option A: Charlie started taking bribes. This option suggests that Charlie became corrupt, which goes against what we know about him from the story. We are told that Charlie likes interacting with the community and doesn't like the amount of corruption in the force. It would be inconsistent for Charlie to suddenly start engaging in corrupt behavior. Therefore, Option A is not the most likely outcome.
Option B: Charlie vowed to change things if he was ever made chief. This option aligns better with our understanding of Charlie based on the story. As a police officer who likes interacting with the community, Charlie may feel frustrated by the corruption within the force but still wants to make a positive impact. Vowing to change things when given the opportunity as chief fits well with Charlie's character. Therefore, Option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states, ""the older dog got very sick and was put to sleep."" This means the older dog died. So, option A is not possible as there is no way for the dog to enjoy having the house to himself if he has already passed away. Therefore, we can eliminate Option A from consideration.
Now let's consider Option B: ""Our dog feels much better playing with another dog."" This option makes sense because when dogs play together, they release endorphins which help reduce stress and anxiety. It could be assumed that after losing his companion, our dog would benefit from social interaction with other dogs. Therefore, Option B seems like the more plausible choice."
"Response: 
The situation starts with Sean's roommates noticing a bad smell coming from Sean's clothes and bed. This suggests they are aware of the problem before they talk to Sean about it. Then, they tell Sean he needs to clean his laundry pretty soon. This implies they are trying to communicate their concern in a polite way. Finally, after initially resisting, Sean cleans his laundry. This shows he has listened to his roommates and taken action to address the issue. Therefore, option B is more likely - his roommates will tell him to never wait so long to do laundry again."
Response:  My friend took the MCAT twice because she wanted to become a doctor. After studying hard for the second attempt, she got a better score. So, option B is more likely - we went out to drinks to celebrate her success.
Response:  The story states that Kelly went down to the ocean to relax. This means she wanted to enjoy herself at the beach. If a wave had captured her and soaked her clothes, it would not be something she would want or enjoy. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response: 
Ben was excited about going fishing with his grandfather at the beginning of the story. But then he found putting worms on the hook to be disgusting and accidentally got pricked by one of the hooks. This suggests that Ben did not enjoy the experience of fishing very much. Therefore, it is more likely that Ben will ask his grandfather when they can go fishing next (Option A). "
"Response: 
If Amelia went back home, it means she gave up on the date altogether. But why would she do that if she was excited about meeting someone new? It's more likely that Amelia stayed at the restaurant waiting for her date. So, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
If the boy was initially scared, he might have been hesitant or unwilling to sit on Santa's lap. In this case, option A (the boy hoped to get lots of presents from Santa) seems more plausible because it aligns with the boy's initial fear and excitement around meeting Santa. Option B (the boy left without getting his picture taken) doesn't quite fit since it implies a sudden change in behavior without any clear reason. Therefore, the answer is option A."
"Response:  The story states that Stewart ""got so engrossed in it (his favorite task) that he forgot to keep the fire going."" This implies that he lost track of time and didn't realize how cold he had become until later on. Therefore, option A - ""When he woke up it was freezing"" - is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Reasoning:  We know that Anthony wanted to learn Spanish and he did so through an online course. This means that he put in effort and time into learning the language. Therefore, option A is more likely as it states that Anthony became successful due to his linguistic abilities. It is unlikely that Anthony struggled to learn the language despite putting in effort since he was able to become fluent after studying hard."
"Response: 
Amy went to the first grocery store, but they were out of half the items on her list. This means she didn't find everything she needed there. So, option A is not possible because Amy did not buy any clothes at the first store. Therefore, the only remaining option is option B: After going to the second store, Amy was able to go home and cook a good meal."
"Response: 
Joanie found out that her brother took her blow dryer without permission. This means she might be angry or upset with him. Option B is more likely because it shows Joanie running outside to confront her brother about taking her belongings without asking."
"Response: 
Option A states that after moving her bed to the new location, Cornelia then moved it back to its original position. However, this doesn't make sense as she just rearranged it to please her friends. It would be illogical of her to move it back to where it was if it was already in a better location. Therefore, Option A is not the correct answer.

Option B suggests that soon all of Cornelia's friends had arranged their beds the same way as hers. This could be possible since people often take inspiration from others when decorating their homes. If Cornelia's friends saw how much better her room looked with the bed by the window, they might have been motivated to try something similar in their own apartments. So, Option B seems more plausible."
Response:  The story states that Tim loves his motorcycle, but then he had a wreck. This means that something bad happened while he was riding it. Therefore, option B is more likely because Tim is now scared to ride his motorcycle after the accident.
"Response:  The story states that Wendy ""really loved"" her job and ""connected"" with the residents. This suggests that she has a strong emotional investment in her work and cares deeply about the people she works with. Additionally, the fact that she particularly enjoys talking to one little old lady implies that she is empathetic and compassionate towards others. Given these traits, it is more likely that Wendy will respond positively to the little old lady's photos, rather than running out of the room crying. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Wendy enjoyed seeing the photos."
Response:  The story states that Tom and Jake are in the general admission area, which means they are close to the stage. If there are some very tall people standing nearby, it is unlikely that Tom and Jake will be able to see the performance clearly. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
Lester has been living without a cellphone for years, but when he gets into trouble with a flat tire, he wishes he had one. This suggests that having a cellphone would be useful in emergencies. Therefore, it is more likely that Lester will choose option B and get the best cellphone he can afford."
Response:  The story states that Ben needed an oil change, which means he had a car. This implies that he has a steady income or resources to afford the service. Additionally, the fact that he found a coupon suggests that he may have access to discounts or promotions. Therefore, option A (Ben was able to get his oil changed) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  The protagonist woke up hungry, so they made themselves a bowl of cereal. However, when they went to pour the milk, they realized they didn't have any. This led them to consider using water instead, which suggests that they might be in a bit of a pinch. Given this context, it seems more likely that they would choose option A (coming home and eating cereal) rather than option B (coming home and eating pizza).
Response:  The story states that Anna only kept coral in her saltwater fish tank before deciding to add fish. This means that she already had experience caring for coral, which suggests that she knows how to maintain a healthy environment for them. It also implies that she may not be as experienced or knowledgeable about keeping fish. Therefore, option A (Anna soon returns the fish to the store) seems more plausible than option B (Now Anna has a diverse tank with fish and coral).
Response:  The story states that Holly was a black cat and then mentions that she passed away. This means that there is no longer a living black cat in the house for Lee to love or miss. Therefore, option B - Lee decides to adopt the kitten - is the most likely ending to the story.
Response:  We know that Bob wanted a new pair of socks, but he ended up buying more than just socks. This means he must have liked the other items he bought. So option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Jamal Lewis is a famous athlete, so it's unlikely that he would give personal advice or have time for a random fan like young Reggie. It's more likely that he would ignore him or tell him to stay away. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Ella took the time to wrap the bird safely, make it a home, and feed it by hand. These actions suggest that she was invested in caring for the bird. Therefore, option A (She liked taking care of the robin) is more likely.
Response:  If you have written your letter of resignation, then you have already informed your employer that you are leaving. This means they know not to expect you at work the next day. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - you will indeed be going back to work at your job tomorrow.
"Response: 
If ten people asked you about the black plastic rose, then they must have been curious about it. But if nobody asked you after a few weeks, then maybe they lost interest or forgot about it. So option A is more likely."
Response:  If Ben used his debit card to buy a coffee, then he must have had enough money in his account to cover the purchase. So, there should be no overdraft fee. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The patron heard Chris speaking in French, so option A is more likely. Therefore, we should choose Option A as the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states that when the narrator was a kid, Google just started for the first time. This means that Google did not exist before this point in history. Therefore, option (B) ""I quickly became very angry at it"" cannot be true because there was no Google for the narrator to get angry with. Option (A) ""I learned a lot from Google"" is the correct answer since it aligns with what the story tells us about the narrator's experience with Google during their childhood."
Response:  Jeff studied really hard before the interview, so it makes sense that he did well. However, if he only studied and didn't prepare any questions or research about the company, then he might not be fully prepared for the position. So option B seems more plausible here.
Response:  The story states that Ritz was born in a litter of 12 other puppies, which means there were at least 12 other dogs around him during those early months of his life. This suggests that Ritz did not become an only pet suddenly after being given away to a new family. Therefore, option A - Ritz was orphaned and had to be sent to a shelter - is unlikely.  Now let's consider option B: His owner began running 12 miles a day. While it is possible that Ritz's owner may have started exercising more due to health reasons related to their cancer diagnosis, there is no direct evidence provided in the story to suggest this happened. So again, option B is also unlikely.  Based on the information provided in the story, the most likely outcome for Ritz is that he continued living with his original family despite their medical challenges.
"Response: 
The story states that Mia loves being outdoors. This means that she enjoys spending time outside. Therefore, option A is more likely. According to the text, Mia had a great time during the mountain climb, which further supports option A. So, the answer is (A) Mia had a great time."
Response:  The situation described in the passage involves Fred becoming angry with his boss after being laid off, picking him up by the collar, and throwing him down. This behavior is not appropriate or legal. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Fred's coworker who saw him assault his boss called the police.
Response:  My sister-in-law has just returned two of her three cable boxes, which means she still has one left. This implies that she hasn't completely given up on cable TV yet. Therefore, option A (She bought more cable boxes) is the most likely outcome.
Response:  The story states that Victor has never tried pistachios before but now he loves them after tasting them once. This means that he will probably continue to buy them in the future since he enjoys their taste. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
If Sharon had kept those seeds for years without knowing what they were or where they came from, it's unlikely that she would know exactly how big they will grow when she finally decides to plant them. It could be anything - tiny flowers, giant trees, or even something entirely different. So option B is the most likely answer here."
"Response: 
Emily wanted to go to the park, but her car won't start. Option A says that she asks her neighbor for a jump-start. This makes sense because sometimes neighbors can help each other with small favors like this. However, option B says that she drives her car to the mechanic to get it looked at. This doesn't make as much sense since Emily just mentioned that her car won't start, so taking it to the mechanic would be unnecessary. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option A: asking her neighbor for a jump-start."
Response:  The story states that Tom moved off the grid because he was tired of his daily routine. This implies that he wanted a change of pace or lifestyle. Option B suggests that Tom loves the idea of a fast, which means he enjoys living without certain luxuries or comforts. Given this information, it seems more likely that Tom will choose option B, as he appears to be seeking a more challenging and rewarding experience than simply returning to his old life.
Response:  The story states that Tim wants to learn astronomy, which means he has a genuine interest in the subject. It also mentions that he is too young to be an astronaut, which suggests that he may not have the necessary qualifications or experience for that role. Given these details, option A seems more plausible than option B. Option A implies that Tim will work hard in school to gain the knowledge and skills needed to pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut, while option B does not provide any logical explanation as to why Tim would hate Mars. Therefore, based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Tim will choose option A and work towards his goal of becoming an astronaut.
"Response:  The story states, ""She gave us a calendar issued by the center."" This implies that she worked at the assisted living center where the calendar was issued. If she was trying to hide something from us, why would she give us a calendar with a picture of herself on it? It doesn't make sense. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  If Fred purchased the shares at $90, and the company did well with its earnings, then the stock price would increase to $100. This means that Fred made a profit of $10 per share ($100 - $90 = $10). So, option B is the correct answer. Fred was indeed very happy about his investment decision!
Response:  The story states that Jen has studied hard and made it through several rounds of the competition without any issues. However, when it comes down to just two contestants remaining (including Jen), there is a possibility that she may still lose due to her opponent making mistakes. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Jen lost the spelling bee.
"Response:  The text states that Kelly ""haven't left her apartment in years."" This suggests that Kelly has some kind of phobia or anxiety disorder, such as agoraphobia, which causes people to avoid leaving their homes due to fear or anxiety. Therefore, option B (Kelly is agoraphobic) is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Emily was at the beach, which means she was outside enjoying herself. Then suddenly the weather turned bad with strong winds and a sandstorm. This doesn't sound like something that would happen when someone has a ""wonderful time"" at the beach. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  The story states that Andrew has never been in trouble before, so he knows where his parent's secret stash of alcohol is located. Option A is incorrect because it implies that Andrew wishes he didn't have access to the alcohol, which contradicts the information provided in the story. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Ellen lived in the country before moving to a city home, which means she had experienced life without electricity for extended periods of time. This suggests that she may have been more prepared for a power outage than someone who has always lived in an urban area with constant access to electricity.
Furthermore, the story mentions that an ice storm caused the power to go out, which can be particularly dangerous as it can cause widespread damage to electrical infrastructure. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Ellen would be ""happy"" when the power comes back on. Instead, she might feel relieved or grateful that the situation did not become even more serious.
Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - Ellen was perfectly comfortable during the power outage."
Response:  We know that Jose is excited about getting a new skateboard, so option A (he had fun at the skatepark) seems more likely than option B (he threw away his skateboard). Therefore, we choose option A as the correct answer.
Response:  The symptoms described in the passage are not typical of a stroke. Strokes typically cause sudden weakness or numbness in one side of the body, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, sudden vision loss, dizziness, or loss of balance, among other things. Itching all over the body is not a common symptom of a stroke. Therefore, option A (Mike had a stroke) is unlikely.  On the other hand, itching all over the body can be caused by various medical conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, or even a severe allergic reaction. So, option B (Mike started laughing hysterically) seems more plausible.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage is one where someone's car breaks down while driving. This can be a stressful and frustrating experience, especially if it happens far away from home or in an isolated area. In this case, Jill called AAA (Automobile Association of America) for help. The most likely outcome would be that AAA sends a tow truck to pick up Jill's car and take it to a nearby repair shop for repairs. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
Mary becomes excited when she finds out there will be a school dance, so option A is unlikely because it doesn't fit with Mary's emotions. Therefore, we can eliminate Option A as the correct answer. Now let's consider Option B: ""She was happy he asked her to the dance."" This fits well with Mary's excitement earlier in the passage, as well as Dan's actions of approaching Mary and asking her to the dance. So, the most likely ending to the story is Option B: She was happy he asked her to the dance."
Response:  The person walked into the store with excitement and tried some of their products. They liked what they tasted and were impressed by the offerings. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - this became their new favorite restaurant.
Response:  Cindy wanted white walls but found them too reflective, so she chose blue instead. This implies that she likes blue better than white. Therefore, option B (She was pleased with the results) is the correct answer.
Response:  The story states that the protagonist has never played fantasy football before, which means he/she had no prior experience or knowledge of how the game works. Additionally, the story mentions that the protagonist joined their friend's group as a last-minute replacement, which suggests that they may not have been well-prepared for the season. Given these factors, it is unlikely that the protagonist would win first place in their first ever attempt at playing fantasy football. Therefore, option B (the protagonist was very disappointed) is the most likely outcome.
Response:  The story states that it snowed the night before, which means it was cold outside. Why would Helen go to the lake to rent a jet-ski? It doesn't make sense given the weather conditions. On the other hand, hearing a familiar sound while heading back inside after shoveling the car could mean that she forgot to turn off the shower. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  We know that Dan asked if the interview was being recorded, which suggests he wants to make sure what he says will be accurate. Then, when the journalist informs him it's a live show, Dan turns to the camera and says something about his father being his inspiration. This implies that Dan has a positive relationship with his father and looks up to him as an inspiration. Therefore, option A (Dan admires his father) is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Jeremy was fired from his previous job after speaking negatively about his manager and coworkers. This suggests that Jeremy may have difficulty getting along with others in the workplace due to his behavior or attitude. Therefore, option A (Jeremy has a difficult manner for the workplace) is more likely."
"Response:  The story states that ""Everyday the cranes would feed off of the bugs in her yard."" This implies that there are plenty of bugs present, so option A (Fran's yard is now overrun with bugs) is unlikely. Moreover, if the cranes were feeding off the bugs every day, it's unlikely they would suddenly stop coming around without any explanation. Therefore, we can rule out option A.  
Now let's consider option B: Fran suffered a fatal heart attack as she arranged flowers. While it's possible for someone to have a heart attack while doing household chores like arranging flowers, it doesn't seem very plausible given the context of the story. There's no indication in the text that Fran was particularly unhealthy or prone to heart attacks. So, based on the information provided, option B seems less likely than option A."
"Response:  The story says that our team was ""pumped"" to win, which means they were excited about playing well. They also practiced beforehand, which suggests they were preparing for success. Additionally, the fact that the team was ""unified"" and worked together implies that they were functioning as a cohesive unit. Given these details, it seems unlikely that they would feel ashamed of their performance. Therefore, option B (our team felt gratified) is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The given information states that Kelly entered college in the fall, which means she must have completed high school successfully. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Kelly graduated with good grades."
"Response: 
Option A: Sophie cried. This option suggests that Sophie is saddened by her grandmother's impending death and the gift of the locket, which holds sentimental value for both of them. It aligns with the emotional tone of the passage, where the author describes Sophie as ""visiting her in the hospital to say goodbye."" Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Kelly went for an interview and they said they will call her back. This means she didn't get the job on the spot. So option B is more likely as it implies that Kelly doesn't want to get a call from them.
"Response:  The story states that Don noticed a fly in his living room, so he tried to swat it. However, the fly managed to evade him after half an hour. This means that Don was not successful in catching the fly. Therefore, option A - ""Don closed the door it flew out of"" - is unlikely because there is no indication that Don even attempted to close the door or prevent the fly from leaving the room. Option B - ""Don never went to the lake again"" - seems more plausible as there is no context provided about why Don would stop going to the lake. It could be assumed that Don simply gave up trying to catch the fly after failing multiple times, rather than having any connection to the lake."
"Response: 
The story says that Zack and his friends walked past an old, abandoned house on their way to school every day. This means they had seen the house before and knew what it looked like. So, when they decided to go inside, it's unlikely that they would decide to play baseball there, as there are no sports equipment or a suitable field inside an old, abandoned house. Therefore, option A is not the most likely answer.
Now let's consider option B: They left and went to school. This makes sense because entering an abandoned house can be dangerous and could potentially lead to trouble with authorities. It's also possible that Zack and his friends were afraid of the house and didn't want to risk getting in trouble. Given these factors, option B seems more plausible than option A."
"Response: 
Mia started with poker, which has a relatively low house edge compared to other games in the casino (around 2-5%). However, if she lost a significant amount of money at that game, it's possible that she continued to play until she ran out of money or reached her loss limit. Then, she moved on to slots, which have much higher odds against players than poker (house edge can be as high as 10% or more). So, option B is the most likely outcome - Mia lost even more money after switching from poker to slots."
"Response: 
Portia loves walking in the woods near her home. This means she enjoys spending time outdoors and appreciates nature. Given this preference, it is unlikely that she would decide to donate the new hiking boots to a thrift store after purchasing them. Instead, she will probably be happy with her selection and continue to enjoy her walks in the woods while wearing her new boots. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states ""He looked everywhere in his house."" This implies that Andrew has already searched all possible places where he might have left the ring, including his home. Therefore, option B is more likely as there are no other places for the ring to be except the store where he originally purchased it."
Response:  Terry found $200 at work, which means someone must have lost it. By taking the money home without trying to find its owner first, Terry acted dishonestly. If Terry had kept the money for himself, he would have been guilty of stealing. However, when he realized what he had done, he decided to turn the money in to his boss. This shows that Terry has integrity and values honesty over personal gain. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  The person in the story loves taking long, warm showers but feels guilty about how wasteful it is. This means that they would probably want to find a way to enjoy their showers without feeling guilty. Option A suggests that they have found a way to do this by taking two showers every day instead of just one. However, this doesn't make sense as taking more showers will actually be more wasteful than taking fewer showers. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - the person has decided to limit themselves to one long warm shower per week in order to balance their desire for comfort with their guilt over wasting water.
Response:  Barry loves playing baseball, so it makes sense that he wants to watch a professional game. He goes to the stadium, buys a ticket, and grabs a beer to drink. This part of the story seems quite plausible. However, things start to get strange when Barry decides to buy a hot dog. Why would Barry want to eat a hot dog while watching a baseball game? It doesn't make much sense, does it? Therefore, option B (Barry decided to leave the game) is the more likely ending to the story.
Response:  The first thing they did was try putting out red wine bowls, which didn't work. Then they bought a special fly trap. This implies that the red wine bowls were not effective at all. Therefore, option A is unlikely because if it worked, they would have continued using them instead of buying a new trap. So, the correct answer is (B) - They could even see the trap working.
"Response: 
Remy likes to drink milk. Okay, that's a given. She spills some milk on the carpet. That's also a given. Now comes the important part - how does Remy react to this situation? Does she learn from her mistake or does she make things worse?
From the context of the story, it seems like Remy might not have been too concerned about cleaning up the spill properly. If that's the case, then Option B is the most likely choice. Remy might feel that spilling more milk on the carpet could be a solution to cover up the original stain. However, if Remy had learned from her mistake and took proper steps to clean up the spill, then Option A would be the most likely choice."
Response:  Heather and Marcus are ready for the next step in their relationship, which means they want something new. They go to an animal shelter because they feel lonely. This makes sense since they just got married and may be feeling empty nest syndrome or simply wanting some companionship. Now here comes the interesting part - they fall in love with a cat! This is where things get tricky. Option A says that they adopt the cat, while option B states that they leave the shelter without one. So, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that they will choose to adopt the cat rather than leaving without one. Therefore, the answer is (A) They adopted the cat.
"Response: 
The situation described in the story involves a large number of people trying to reach their destination quickly, which can lead to chaos and disorderliness. In this scenario, option B is more likely, as the crowd may cause delays for many people, leading them to be late to class. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
"Response:  We know that the person attended a concert last Saturday, and they were able to get close enough to the stage to see the performer clearly. This suggests that they had good seats or were able to move around easily during the performance. However, after the show, they decided to go backstage to meet the performer, which implies that they had some level of access or connection to the performer or their team.  Now, let's consider the two possible endings. Option A states that Azalea was ""very cool,"" which could suggest that the person had a positive interaction with her or her team. This would make sense given that they were able to meet her backstage. On the other hand, option B states that the person will not be attending any more concerts, which seems unlikely if they just had a great experience at one. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is most likely that the person had a positive encounter with Azalea or her team, so we choose option A as the correct answer."
"Response: 
Eric started going to the gym in January, which means he had already tried to lose weight through exercise for at least a month before he decided to change his eating habits. This suggests that he may have found it difficult to maintain his workout routine, especially if he wasn't seeing immediate results. Therefore, option A (Eric gave up working out) is more likely."
Response:  The story says that Sally's parents want to motivate her to do well in school. This means they are offering a reward for good grades. Option B states that Sally does well and her parents agree to take her to Hawaii as a reward. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
We were kids who didn't have much experience running a business. Our parents probably helped us out in setting it up. So we had some support there. Also, we only sold lemonade to a few dozen people. That means that each person bought one cup or less from us. This tells me that we might not have been able to sell enough cups to cover all of our expenses. Therefore, option A (we did not make any money) seems more likely than option B (we made a lot of money). "
Response:  The first sentence mentions that you loved flashlights when you were younger, which implies that you still have some fondness for them even though they are no longer as useful as they once were (given the advent of smartphones). Then comes the punchline about having too many flashlights at home without knowing what to do with them - this suggests that while you may not need them as much anymore, you still can't bring yourself to get rid of them entirely. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome.
Response:  We know from the context of the story that Terry is unhappy with his given name, so option B is more likely. Therefore, we should choose option B.
Response:  We know that the Parker family was looking for a new house, and after searching everywhere, they finally found one they liked. This means they were excited about moving in. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - the Parker family soon moved into their new home.
"Response:  The story states that ""the front door was open."" This suggests that someone may have left it unlocked or forgotten to lock it before leaving the house. It also means that anyone could enter through the open door without needing to use the doorbell. Therefore, option B - Tom began to worry - is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Kelly's car battery died, so she tried to get it jump-started but it didn't work. This means that the battery is indeed dead. Therefore, option B (Kelly reluctantly paid for a new battery) is the more likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states that Joe ""took his new skateboard to the park to show it off to his friends."" This implies that Joe enjoys skateboarding and wants to share his excitement with others. However, while performing a trick, Joe falls and breaks his arm. This suggests that Joe may not have been paying close attention to what he was doing or was overconfident in his abilities. Therefore, option B - Joe was in terrible pain - is the more likely outcome of this situation."
"Response: 
Maddie decided it was time for back-to-school shopping. This means that she needs to buy new things for school. Option A says that she borrowed all of her school equipment. However, this doesn't make sense because if she already has everything she needs, then why would she need to go shopping? Therefore, option B is more likely. According to the passage, Maddie looked through ads in the paper for the best deals on school supplies. This suggests that she wanted to find the cheapest prices possible so that she could save money. So, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Neil went from enjoying mildly spicy Chinese food in Hunan to traveling to Szechuan province specifically for the spicier food. This suggests that he has a taste for bold flavors. Therefore, option A is more likely: ""He felt like his mouth was on fire."""
"Response: 
The student spent most of their detention time sleeping, which means they were not paying attention or working on any assignments. Their teacher then tells them to wake up, but the student tries to stay awake and work on some assignments instead. This suggests that the student may have been feeling tired or bored during detention.
Given this context, option A (When I got home I went right to bed) seems like the most likely ending to the story. It makes sense that after a long day at school, the student would be exhausted and want to rest as soon as possible."
Response:  We know that Amanda is watching a squirrel, which means she is interested in what the squirrel is doing. She is so fascinated that she decides to observe it closely. This suggests that Amanda enjoys learning about nature. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer.
Response:  Terry loves to swim, so it's unlikely that he will give up swimming altogether (option B). Instead, he wants to learn a new skill - diving. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome: Terry hopes to improve his diving skills.
Response:  We know that Peter enjoyed the field trip, which means he must have liked science at least a little bit. Option A states that Peter hated science, but this goes against what we just learned about him enjoying the field trip. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Peter grew up to be a scientist!
Response:  The story states that Kaylee works at Cedar Point, which means she probably lives nearby or commutes daily from her home. If this is the case, it would be unlikely for her to travel far away for a wedding ceremony, especially if they just got engaged recently. Therefore, option A (Kaylee and James were married in the fall) seems more plausible as it aligns with their proximity to the amusement park where they first met.
Response:  Joanie had an interview, which means that someone (the interviewer) asked her questions about herself and her qualifications. This suggests that the person on the other side of the table was interested in learning more about her. If they were not interested, they would have cut the interview short or dismissed her outright. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - she got the job offer the next day.
"Response: 
The story states that Ana got a full-body massage. This means that she had every part of her body worked on during the massage session. Therefore, it is unlikely that she will say ""Someday, I will get a full-body massage."" That statement would be redundant since she already did so. 
On the other hand, the second option is more plausible because after getting a full-body massage, Ana felt relaxed and contented. It makes sense for her to feel this way given the amount of tension and stress she must have been carrying before the massage. So, the correct answer is (B)."
"Response: 
If Bob was initially very happy when he received the $50 bonus, then finding out that it was only $5 would make him feel disappointed or less excited about the amount of money he received. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Bob was still happy, but less excited about the bonus."
Response:  The story says that Mom didn't want to cook dinner, so she told her kids to fend for themselves. This means they had to find something to eat on their own without any help from Mom. Since they chose to eat cold cereal, it must be because they liked it or found it easy to prepare. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - it was the best meal they ever had!
"Response:  The story states ""Mary was sad that the whole family would not be together."" This implies that Mary expected everyone to be present, but they will miss one person (her grandfather). Therefore, option A is more likely as it shows Mary being distraught about the situation."
"Response: 
First, we know that the children are inside playing when they hear music coming from outside. This suggests that it might be an ice cream truck passing by. Next, we see that the children run to their mother and beg for money. This implies that they want to buy something with the money, perhaps because they associate the ice cream truck with treats. Finally, we learn that their mother gives them a couple of dollars, which means she has provided them with some spending money. Given these details, option B (the children excitedly buy ice cream cones) seems like the more likely outcome."
Response:  If they wanted to go to the beach, why would they buy an airplane ticket? It doesn't make sense. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. They will continue driving to the beach instead of taking a flight.
"Response:  The story states, ""Susan woke up early."" This implies she has a job or other responsibilities outside of taking care of the animals. It also says she finds the rabbit with babies (bunnies). This means she will have to take extra care of them now. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  We know that the person tries to go to bed on time, but they got hooked on a new TV show. This means that they enjoyed it so much that they lost track of time. Therefore, option A is the correct answer - the television show had indeed hooked them in.
Response:  We know that Howard felt happy in the beginning of the story. So option A is more likely since it states that he had a good day. Option B does not make sense as there is no indication that he would cry throughout the entire day. Therefore, we can conclude that option A is the correct answer.
Response:  If a large brick falls from above and hits someone on the head, it can cause serious injury or even death. In this scenario, the person would be unconscious or incapacitated, which means they cannot move or walk on their own. Therefore, option A is more likely - his coworkers will take him to safety and call their medic because he needs immediate medical attention. Option B does not make sense in this situation as an injured person would not be able to run towards anyone.
"Response: 
Option A states that Trent charges two pitchers of sangria to his parents' room, which means he is drinking alcohol while supposedly keeping the fire going in the wind. This seems unlikely as it would be dangerous for Trent to be under the influence of alcohol while handling flammable materials like a fire. Therefore, Option B is more likely - Trent was careless and caused a huge fire."
"Response: 
Ending A states that George told the police about his stolen TV. This implies that George reported the crime to the authorities, which means he wants them to find the thief and recover his property. Therefore, Ending A is more likely."
"Response: 
The story states, ""Some of his friends agreed."" This means that not all of Tommy's friends liked the new hairstyle. Therefore, option B is more likely. The story also mentions that Tommy's parents did not like the new hairstyle, so this option is also a good choice."
"Response:  We know that Robbie posted a message on Facebook asking for help with shoveling her car out of the snow. This means she is probably located somewhere where there is snowfall and it might be difficult or impossible to drive without clearing the path. Now let's consider what Cameron did after seeing Robbie's post. According to the passage, Cameron ""felt sympathy"" for Robbie and decided to help her. This suggests that he took action to assist her, which implies that he actually showed up at Robbie's location to help shovel her car out of the snow (Option A). Therefore, the most likely outcome is Option A: Cameron came by and helped Robbie shovel."
Response:  At first, Ronald kicked his shoes off and lay down for a nap. Then when he woke up, he went to put his shoes back on. This means that he already had his shoes with him. So option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story states, ""One day her water broke."" This means that Sara went into labor. The next sentence says, ""She was in labor for 4 hours."" This implies that Sara gave birth to a baby after being in labor for four hours. Therefore, option A (Sara had a baby boy) is the correct answer. "
"Response: 
The statement ""My uncle takes it to the beach every weekend"" implies that he enjoys going to the beach, so option B is more likely."
Response:  The story states that the narrator went to babysit their 5-year-old nephew in San Francisco. This implies that they are an adult, possibly older than 20 years old. If this is the case, then option A (I do not have a sister) is unlikely because it would mean that the narrator has no siblings at all, which seems highly unlikely given the context of the story. Therefore, the most likely answer is Option B: We had a great time!
"Response: 
The story states that Alice's friends had already ordered their meals before she arrived. This means they had planned ahead of time and made sure to reserve a table for Alice as well. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer - Alice felt her friends were very thoughtful."
"Response:  The story states that ""my daughters picked out a friendly puppy."" This implies that it was not just one of them who chose the puppy, but both of them together. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
The story starts with ""Today was his wedding day"" which implies that it is a special occasion for Mario, something happy and important. Then we see him getting ready (shaving, showering) which suggests that he is feeling excited and eager for this event. Finally, the sentence ""He got dressed and went to the church"" confirms that indeed, today is Mario's wedding day. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - it was the best day of his life."
"Response:  The story says ""consider the following story"". So, we are considering an imaginary story about someone named Zeke who moves from America to Cozumel. Option A states that after building his house, Zeke decides to move back to America. However, this doesn't make sense as he just left America to move to Cozumel in the first place! Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Zeke lives out his life in Cozumel, happy with his new home."
Response:  Kelly applied for the Navy, but she didn't hear anything from them. It's unlikely that they would get back to her quickly because there are many applicants applying for the Navy every day. On the other hand, if she had applied for the Army, it's possible that they might have contacted her sooner since there may not be as many applications coming in compared to the Navy. Therefore, option B (And the US army got back to her) is more likely.
Response:  We know that Gina only knows two people at her new school, neither of whom were in the lunchroom with her. This means she didn't have anyone to talk to or sit with during lunch. Additionally, she went outside after getting her food, which suggests that she may not have been feeling particularly comfortable or confident in the lunchroom itself. Given these details, it seems more likely that Gina felt lonely rather than having a great day. Therefore, we should choose option B: Gina felt very lonely.
"Response: 
The child in this story experienced fear during the flight, which is understandable given that air travel can sometimes be intimidating for young children. However, after the flight ended successfully without any major incidents or problems, the child may have gained confidence and overcome their initial fear. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - the child became less afraid of planes after experiencing them firsthand."
Response:  Adam wanted a new baseball cap, so he searched for one online. Then he found the perfect hat and ordered it. This means that he was excited about getting his new cap. Therefore, option B (And he opened it as soon as it got there) is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story states ""They noticed that they may not have enough to pay for it."" This implies that they don't currently have enough funds saved up or budgeted for their wedding, which means they will need to find additional sources of funding. 
Option A suggests that their parents love them and want to help them out financially, which could be a reasonable explanation for why they might offer to contribute to their wedding costs. However, without more information about the relationship between Ted and Beth, as well as their parents', it's impossible to say for sure whether this option is true or false. 
On the other hand, Option B suggests that they spent the money on something else entirely - in this case, candy. While it's possible that they could have used some of the money for non-essential expenses like this, it seems unlikely given the context of the story. If they were struggling to afford their wedding, it's more likely that they would prioritize paying for essential expenses over discretionary spending like buying candy. Therefore, we can conclude that Option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Cindy woke up without finding her slippers. This means that before going to sleep, she must have taken off her slippers. So, option (A) makes sense as it suggests that after searching for her slippers all day, she might want to buy a new iPhone to replace the one she lost or misplaced. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Paris has a lot of cultural things to do like museums, art galleries, historical landmarks etc. So option (A) seems more likely as it matches with what we know about Paris. 
On the other hand, spending all your money too quickly might be possible but less likely scenario for someone who just arrived in Paris. Therefore, option (B) seems less likely."
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage is one where Jessica wants something (a vacation) but doesn't know if or when it will happen. Her father knows this and surprises her on her graduation day with tickets instead. This could be seen as an act of kindness and generosity, which might make Jessica happy. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  The story states that Tim is too tall for all of his pants, which means he cannot find any pants that fit him well. This implies that he has tried many different pairs of pants but none have worked out. Given this information, it seems unlikely that Tim would decide to stay home and watch TV instead of trying to find a solution to his problem. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Tim will wear the jean-shorts to the park.
"Response: 
Sandy has just bought a new bed, so she needs to clean her room before the delivery men arrive. This means that she doesn't want any mess in her room when the new bed arrives. Therefore, option A (Sandy throws her old bed away) is unlikely because it would create unnecessary clutter in her room.
On the other hand, option B (Sandy sells Jim her old bed) makes more sense as it allows Sandy to declutter her room while also making some money from her old bed. It's possible that Jim might be interested in buying an older bed, especially if it's still in good condition. So, the answer is option B - Sandy sells Jim her old bed."
"Response:  The student says they had ""terrible"" professors who didn't know how to teach. This implies that their learning experience was subpar. Then, instead of attending classes, they chose to go to the library to learn on their own. This suggests that they were motivated enough to take matters into their own hands and educate themselves outside of the traditional classroom setting. Therefore, option B (Teaching myself helped me get ahead of other students) is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
If Timmy says ""hello"" and begins talking to the girl, it means that he has revealed his presence and identity to her. This could lead to awkwardness or even danger for him, especially if she doesn't want to talk to him. Therefore, option A is less likely.
On the other hand, diving into the cool water would provide an easy escape from the situation without any confrontation. It might also give Timmy some time to calm down and rethink his actions before facing the consequences. So, option B seems more plausible in this scenario."
"Response:  We know that Neil visited Egypt, which means he traveled there for some reason (either for pleasure or business). Since he went on a guided tour, we can assume that he wanted to learn more about the country and its history. Given his interest in seeing the Great Pyramids, it makes sense that he would be ""awed"" by their size and beauty. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  If Jen had intended to use the bleach for just five minutes, why would she fall asleep with it still in her hair? It doesn't make sense that she would forget or ignore the fact that she left it in longer than planned. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome - Jen will try to fix the damage herself rather than seeking help from her mother.
Response:  The story states that all Doug wants is a white Christmas, which means he desires snow on Christmas day. It also mentions that he prayed to God for snow. This implies that Doug believes in God and has faith that his prayer will be answered. Now, let's consider the two endings: Option A: Doug looks out the window and sees a blanket of white snow. In this scenario, Doug's wish comes true, and he gets exactly what he asked for - snow on Christmas day. However, this ending doesn't quite fit with the context of the story. If Doug had already gotten his wish granted, there would be no reason for him to wake up and find more snow outside. So, this option seems less likely. Option B: Doug finds no snow and is instantly thrilled. In this case, Doug wakes up to find no snow outside, but instead of being disappointed, he becomes instantaneously thrilled. While it's possible that Doug could be happy about something else entirely (like presents or spending time with loved ones), given the context of the story, it seems unlikely that he would suddenly become ecstatic over nothing in particular. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely ending to the story is Option B: Doug finds no snow and is instantly thrilled.
"Response:  The story states, ""Her family told her she worked a boring job."" This implies they have negative opinions about her profession. It also says, ""She tried to tell them that she got to work with living history."" This suggests she enjoys her job and finds it interesting. However, the story does not provide any evidence for why Sheryl might be depressed despite finding her job enjoyable. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  If Joe didn't set his alarm, then he wouldn't have been able to hear it go off. This means that if he got up at 10am without an alarm, then he must not have needed to be somewhere on time (like work). Therefore, option B is more likely - Joe went back to sleep after realizing he wasn't late for anything.
Response:  If Ned had died peacefully in his sleep, then why did the police arrest his wife? It doesn't make sense! Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  The story states that Jackie went into labor at the hospital and gave birth after 48 hours. This means she had a vaginal delivery. Vaginal deliveries are generally safe for both mother and child, but they can be painful and tiring. It is possible that Jackie may have felt overwhelmed or exhausted after giving birth, which could lead to feelings of sadness or depression. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer.
"Response:  The story says that ""We fell in love with a cute black kitten."" This means that option B, ""We bought the kitten,"" is the most likely outcome. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
"Response: 
Joe comes home with an A on his spelling homework, which means he did well in school that day. This makes him feel good about himself. However, the story states that Joe's sister always has her test results posted on the fridge, implying that she does well in school as well. This could make Joe feel bad or jealous since he doesn't do as well as his sister. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Joe might be sad for the rest of the day because he feels left behind or inferior compared to his sister."
Response:  Adam and Angel want to move out and get a place of their own, so they search for apartments online. This suggests that they are in a committed relationship and want to take this next step together. Once they find some potential apartments, they go and look at them, which further reinforces their commitment to each other. Therefore, option A (They finally decided on an apartment) is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
Greta handed out invitations for the party at school. This means she invited people from her class or school. If nobody showed up, it could be because they didn't want to come (Option A) or they couldn't make it (Option B). Since we don't know why nobody showed up, it's impossible to say with certainty which option is more likely. Therefore, both options are equally plausible and neither can be said to be more likely than the other."
"Response:  We know that Shari's wedding was supposed to be outside, but there was a forecast of rain. However, luckily for her, the weather cleared up just in time for the big day. So option A - ""The festivities went off without a hitch"" makes more sense as it aligns with what we know about the weather improving just in time for the wedding."
"Response:  The story states that Amy has been ""very good"" all year, which suggests that she has been well-behaved and obedient. This means that Santa Claus will probably give her the presents on his nice list, rather than the naughty list. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Amy will indeed get everything she wants for Christmas."
Response:  We know that Anna has been tending her garden all summer, which means she must have enjoyed taking care of it. Therefore, option A - Anna doesn't like vegetables - is unlikely. So, we can eliminate this option. Now, let's consider option B - She had a bountiful harvest. This makes more sense since Anna would be excited about picking her fruits and veggies one by one if they are in abundance. Hence, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  The story states that Kim has dropped her toothbrush in the toilet, which means she cannot use it anymore. It also mentions that she is disgusted at the thought of putting her hand in the toilet to retrieve it. This suggests that Kim may not want to touch the toothbrush again after it has been in the toilet. Therefore, option B (Kim decides this is a sign to buy a new toothbrush) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A states that Hannah loves her fingers. This means that Hannah values and cares about her fingers. If this were true, it would be unlikely for Hannah to give up playing the piano altogether after just one lesson. Instead, she might feel motivated to continue practicing in order to improve her skills with her fingers. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
In this scenario, we have a woman named Keira who has been dating someone for a while and thinks he might be ""the one."" However, things take a dark turn when he hits her after she accidentally burns dinner. This behavior is not acceptable in any relationship, and it is important that Keira prioritize her own safety and well-being above all else. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that Keira will choose option B and leave the abusive relationship. It is crucial to recognize the signs of an unhealthy or abusive relationship early on and take action to protect oneself."
"Response: 
Step 1: The shepherd opens the gate of the pen. 
Step 2: He sends his dog into the pasture to round up the sheep. 
Step 3: The dog herds the sheep towards the gate. 
Step 4: The sheep move together into the pen. 
Based on these steps, it seems that the most likely ending to the story is Option B: The shepherd then releases the sheep. This makes sense because once the sheep are in the pen, there is no need for the shepherd to keep them contained any longer. It would be more logical for him to release them rather than sending them back out into the pasture."
"Response: 
Walter has been feeling lonely after his wife passes away, so he meets someone new through bingo. However, he feels guilty because of what his late wife might think. In this situation, option A (He asked the lady from bingo to go to dinner with him) seems like the most likely outcome as it shows that Walter is taking steps towards moving on from his grief and finding companionship again. It also suggests that he is willing to take a chance on someone new despite his guilt. Option B (He decided to never date again) does not seem very plausible given the context of the story."
Response:  The story states that Marina was walking past the library, which suggests she might be going somewhere specific or on an errand. It also mentions that she put her face down to avoid the wind, which implies that she doesn't want to get hit in the face by something like a tumbleweed. Given these details, option B (She couldn't believe how windy it was) seems more plausible than option A (She loved playing golf). Therefore, the correct answer is option B.
"Response:  The person in this story played the Powerball game, which means they bought a ticket with randomly generated numbers or chose their own numbers. They then said that they ""picked"" their numbers from their family Bible. This implies that they may have chosen some of those numbers for good luck or superstition reasons. Finally, they stated that they prayed nervously while waiting for the drawing results. All these actions suggest that the person had high hopes of winning but ultimately did not succeed. Therefore, option A (I didn't win) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A states that Amy didn't prepare for the test despite having written a song to help herself remember the material. This implies that she didn't spend enough time reviewing or studying the material, which could lead to poor performance on the test. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  We know that the person was coming out of college and starting their job. This means they are entering adulthood and taking on new responsibilities. It also means they have been in school for some time and may be feeling anxious about this transition. Given these factors, option B (I had a great first day of work) seems more likely than option A (I left early due to illness). Why? Because it would be unusual for someone to get sick right after graduating and starting a new job, especially if they were excited and nervous as described in the passage. Additionally, having a great first day of work suggests that the person is off to a good start in their career, which aligns with the idea of them being excited and nervous about this transition into adulthood.
"Response: 
Ben and Mike are playing together, which means they are having fun. They first play with quadcopters and then move on to other toys like trucks. This suggests that they are enjoying themselves. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
The waiter was dying to go home but he still had a table eating. This means that the waiter wanted to leave work early but couldn't because there were customers at his table. So option A is more likely."
Response:  We know that Kay has already packed her things and driven to her mom's house, so she doesn't have any more space in her car. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice - Kay will have to put some of her things in storage.
"Response: 
First, we know that ""the girls"" are more than one person because it says ""they."" So there must be at least two people involved in this situation. 
Next, we learn that these girls decided to have dinner together with their families. This implies that they are close friends or relatives who want to spend time together. 
Then comes the twist - they get into a fight! Now things take an unexpected turn, and the staff has to intervene and throw them out. 
Based on all of this information, option B seems like the most likely outcome. It would be unusual if everyone had a good time despite getting into a huge argument. Option A also doesn't make much sense since being thrown out wouldn't necessarily mean they were thoroughly embarrassed; rather, it means they caused trouble and needed to leave the premises."
Response:  If Vinny saw Denzel Washington out taking a stroll, then option A (Vinny kept walking) makes no sense because if Vinny wanted to keep walking, he would have continued on his way without stopping or turning back. Option B (Vinny got his picture taken with him) is more plausible since Vinny saw Denzel Washington in person and decided to take advantage of the opportunity to get a photo with him. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.
Response:  When you were seven years old, you went swimming with your friends. You didn't know how to swim well in deep water. Then, by accident, you slipped into the deep part of the pool. This means that you were in danger of drowning. Now, imagine a lifeguard saw this happening and quickly jumped in to save you. That would be very exciting and lucky for you! So, the correct answer is option B: A lifeguard jumped in and pulled you out of the deep end.
"Response: 
In this scenario, the family has been searching for their missing cat and are worried that she might have escaped or gotten lost outside. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that the cat would suddenly appear on the top branch of the Christmas tree without anyone noticing earlier. Therefore, option B - ""The Smiths all cheered, and rushed to hug their cat"" - is the more plausible ending."
"Response:  The story says that Flora ""decided to stay in Spain"" after her initial plan to return home. This means that she chose to remain in Spain instead of returning home. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Flora did visit her parents every summer to tell them about her adventures in Spain."
Response:  Why did Joyce buy the fruit in the first place? Because she wanted to be healthier, right? And why did she forget about it? Maybe because life got busy or something else distracted her. But now there's a bad smell coming from her apartment! This means that the fruit has started to rot and stink up the whole space. So, option A is more likely - Joyce will throw the fruit away to get rid of the bad smell.
Response:  The situation described in the passage involves a person (Ted) who doesn't know how to swim going into deep water despite being asked not to do so by their friends. This indicates that the person may be taking unnecessary risks or acting impulsively without considering potential consequences. In this case, option B is more likely as it suggests that Ted almost drowned due to his actions. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
If you had a terrible time, it means that something went wrong during the date. For example, maybe the food at the restaurant was bad or the movie wasn't very good. In this case, option A would be the most likely choice. On the other hand, if you got to kiss Sarah goodnight, it means that things went well and you enjoyed yourself. This could mean that you had a nice conversation with her, or that she was friendly and easy to talk to. In this case, option B would be the most likely choice. So based on these factors, we can conclude that option B is the most likely outcome of your date with Sarah."
"Response:  The story states that we visited ""almost all"" of the exhibits at the zoo before finding the sloths in the last one. This implies that there were more exhibits than just the one where the sloths were located. Therefore, option A (We decided to leave without visiting the exhibit) is unlikely because it would mean that we left the zoo without seeing any of its other exhibits. Option B (We were gratified) is a better fit since it means that we were happy or satisfied after finding the sloths in the last exhibit."
Response:  The scientist discovered a disease, worked on it in his lab, and other scientists gathered to help him. This means he had some knowledge of what was happening before others did. So option A (feeling foolish) is unlikely because he already knew about the disease when other people found out. Therefore, we can conclude that option B (saving the world) is more likely.
Response:  We know that Troy went over to play at Sam's house, which means he was excited about it. Then we see him playing with blocks, trucks, teddy bears, coloring, and even having a snack together. This all suggests that Troy had a great time! So, option A is the most likely answer - Troy did have lots of fun at Sam's house.
"Response: 
Yvonne started jogging every day, which means that she has been doing it for two months. This implies that she has been consistent in her exercise routine. Consistency is key when it comes to seeing results from exercise. So option A is more likely. "
"Response: 
India wanted to try Iced Coffee, so she made it at home. That means she had a coffee machine. Then, she got the milk and ice for the beverage. This indicates that she was going to prepare an Iced Coffee. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Betsy wanted a puppy but her mom said no. This means that Betsy was initially disappointed when her mom refused to get her a dog. However, when she discovered a hamster in a cage, she changed her mind and became excited instead of upset. Therefore, option B (Betsy was really excited) is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Maureen wants to become a Biology teacher because she loves Biology. This means that she enjoys teaching and sharing her knowledge of Biology with others. Therefore, option B is more likely - Maureen now shares her passion for Biology with students."
Response:  Cornelia has just finished building a beautiful table by herself after taking a woodworking course. It would be illogical for her to chop it up into firewood right away since she put so much effort into making it. Instead, she might want to use it as a piece of furniture in her home, such as a nightstand or coffee table. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Why did they come across this grave in the first place? It must have been because they were exploring their neighborhood, right? So, it makes sense that they would be curious about what's inside the grave. And why are they scared when they see the broken chains? Maybe someone or something is buried underneath the ground, which could explain why the chains are broken! Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - they wanted to explore the graveyard again.
Response:  The story says they drove to the salt flats, which means it was probably hot outside. Then it mentions that they raced each other for seven miles. This implies that they were driving at high speeds on the flat surface of the salt flats. Finally, the story simply states that one of them (Jim) won the race without providing any details about how or why he won. Given these clues, option B seems like the more likely outcome - Jim won the race in his Corvette.
"Response:  We know that Sally loves walking through the woods, so she probably enjoys nature. Also, we know that she sees a bird (robin) in its nest, which suggests that she appreciates wildlife. Therefore, option A - ""She was excited"" - is the most likely choice."
Response:  The story states that Joy has been playing golf since she was a child, which means she must have some experience with the sport. Additionally, the fact that she beat her boyfriend by 18 points suggests that she is quite skilled at golf. Now, consider how someone might react when they are defeated by their significant other in a competitive activity. It is unlikely that the boyfriend would be angry or never speak to Joy again simply because she beat him at putt putt. Instead, it is more likely that he would be impressed by her skills and ask for a rematch. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Why would you assume that your nephew being an awful chef means he can slice an onion without getting cut? It's actually more likely that he is a skilled chef who knows how to properly chop an onion, especially if he is doing it behind his back! So, the correct answer is Option B: He is a fantastic chef.
"Response: 
The little sister found out she was having a baby brother. This means that she will no longer be the youngest member of the family, which could make her feel upset or jealous. It's natural for children to act out when they are feeling emotional or upset, especially if they don't know how to express their feelings in a healthy way.
Coloring on the walls is a common behavior for young children who are feeling frustrated or upset. They may not have the cognitive ability to understand why they shouldn't do this, but it can still be destructive and cause problems for parents.
Based on these factors, option B (the little sister got punished with a timeout) seems like the more likely outcome. Children need boundaries and consequences for their actions, especially when they are misbehaving. Giving the little sister a cookie for her behavior might not address the underlying issues causing her upset, and could potentially reinforce negative behaviors."
Response:  The author of the passage mentions that they went on a hiking trip, got lost, and searched for their friends. They also mention that they didn't have any equipment with them. This suggests that they were not prepared for the hike and may not have had the necessary gear to navigate their surroundings. Given these details, it is more likely that option B (the author decided to stay lost) is the correct answer. Why would someone who got lost in the woods without any equipment decide to keep walking and get even more lost? It seems unlikely that they would continue on their journey without proper navigation tools or emergency supplies. Therefore, option B is the most plausible conclusion to the story.
"Response: 
Option A states that the teacher ""admired"" Hailey's determination, which suggests that they were impressed with her enthusiasm and willingness to go the extra mile (no pun intended). Given this context, it seems more likely that the teacher would agree to lend Hailey their running shoes rather than dismissing her request outright. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Jim found a piece of metal in his yard that resembled jewelry, which suggests that he might have stumbled upon something valuable. However, we don't know much about the history or significance of this metal without further investigation. Therefore, option A (Jim sold the ring for $1000) seems unlikely as there could be more to the story than what meets the eye.  On the other hand, option B (Jim threw the ring away) seems plausible since Jim didn't seem to take any further action after finding the metal, suggesting that he may not have been interested in keeping it. So, based on the information provided, I would choose option B as the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The prompt states ""They sat down together in front of their pies."" This implies that there are two pies involved - one for each person. 
Then it says ""When the contest started, they dug in."" This means that they began eating their respective pies at the same time. 
Now here comes the crucial part: ""Both of them got horrible stomach aches."" This indicates that both Kyle and Ted experienced negative consequences from consuming their pies. 
So, based on the information provided, option B (Kyle and Ted got so sick that they both lost) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  The story states that Bob became dehydrated after playing volleyball, which means he lost more fluids than he took in. Therefore, option (B) makes more sense as it shows how his friends helped him replenish those lost fluids. Option (A), on the other hand, suggests that Bob experienced an opposite effect of drinking too much water, which doesn't align with the given scenario. So, the correct answer is (B).
"Response: 
Kathy realized to her horror that she was out of milk, so she gathered her young children up and went to the store. This means they went to the store together. Since they were ""bad"" in the store (i.e., they misbehaved), it's unlikely that they would go back there right away. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option A: The children all went to bed without any dinner."
"Response: 
Chuck had great ideas to debate, but was afraid of public speaking. To overcome this fear, he took a speech class over the summer. This means that before joining the debate team, Chuck had some experience in public speaking through his speech class. Now, let's consider why someone might drop out of school. There are many reasons why students may choose to leave school, such as bullying, academic struggles, or personal issues. However, given what we know about Chuck's situation, it seems unlikely that he would drop out of school. By taking a speech class over the summer and joining the debate team despite his initial fear, Chuck showed determination and motivation to improve his public speaking skills. Therefore, option A (Chuck joined and did fairly well) is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  The story says it was ""very hot"" outside, which suggests that it was a warm day or even a tropical climate. This means that dehydration from being lost in the woods would be a more likely cause of discomfort than hypothermia (frostbite). Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome for this story."
"Response: 
Laura has a passion for art, she paints everyday after school. This means that she enjoys painting and finds joy in creating something beautiful. When she creates a self-portrait, it suggests that she values her own creativity and talent. Posting it online allows others to see her work and appreciate it as well. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome - Laura is pleased to share her art with others and continues to create more pieces."
Response:  Jason started training to become a boxer, so he must have been doing something right. Then we are told that he became a great boxer. This means that he probably won some fights or at least performed well enough to impress others. Therefore, option A (He won his first fight by knockout) is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The story says that the kids enjoyed swimming at the water park, which suggests they had fun there. It also mentions that the family enjoyed pizza and story time together, which further indicates that everyone had a good time. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option B: They all had a good time."
"Response: 
The situation described in the story could be interpreted as an awkward or tense moment, so option B (Tom asking the tall gentleman what the problem was) seems more plausible than option A (the tall gentleman asking Tom for a glass of water)."
"Response: 
Allie lost 50 pounds, which means she has a significant amount of weight loss already under her belt. However, the doctor tells her that she needs to lose another 10 pounds for skin removal. This implies that the remaining weight loss required for skin removal is relatively small compared to what Allie has already achieved. 
Given this context, it is highly unlikely that Allie will gain all the weight back after reaching the target weight specified by the doctor. Instead, option A (Allie was able to lose the 10 pounds and have the skin removal) seems like the more plausible outcome."
"Response: 
Jenny was addicted to sending text messages, so it is possible that she might have been inattentive while driving. However, since she heard a horn honk, it means there was another vehicle nearby. If Jenny had taken her eyes off the road for too long, she would have collided with that vehicle. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Jenny narrowly avoided a car accident."
"Response: 
If Elle hated driving, it would be unlikely that she would buy a car in the first place. Therefore, option A is not the most likely answer. 
On the other hand, if Elle was very responsible, it makes sense that she would make timely payments on her car loan each month. So, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
The word ""puttered"" in the first sentence suggests that Jay was driving his car slowly or with difficulty, which implies that there might be something wrong with it. Therefore, option A (He told Jay the repair would cost nine thousand dollars) is more likely because it fits better with the context of the story."
"Response: 
The story states ""Ned was hiking in the woods."" This means he was outdoors, possibly on foot or on a trail. It also implies that he was not at home or working. Therefore, option A cannot be true because Ned did not go to the gym after work. 
Now let's consider option B: ""He waited until wildlife rescue arrived to save the baby possums."" This makes more sense given the context of the story. Since Ned found the baby possums in the woods, it would make sense for him to wait for professional help to arrive rather than trying to care for them himself. Wildlife rescues typically have trained staff who can provide appropriate care for injured or orphaned animals like the baby possums. So, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
The situation described involves a violation of privacy, humiliation, and betrayal of trust. It is understandable that Don would feel angry, embarrassed, and hurt. However, option B is more likely because it shows that Don has not been able to move on from the incident and has instead chosen to hold onto anger and resentment towards his former friend. This can lead to further emotional distress and difficulty forming healthy relationships in the future. Option A, while possible, does not take into account the severity of the initial betrayal and the impact it had on Don's feelings of self-worth and trust."
"Response: 
The story states that ""one day I went outside"" which implies it happened recently. Then it says ""my dog was not there."" This means that the dog was present earlier but then disappeared without a trace. It also suggests that the speaker did not notice anything unusual until after the dog vanished. 
Now let's consider option A - ""the neighbor had my dog"". If this were true, we would expect some indication of how the neighbor obtained the dog. For example, maybe they found her wandering around their property or perhaps someone handed her over to them. However, since there is no such detail provided in the story, it seems unlikely that the neighbor actually had the dog. 
On the other hand, option B - ""I gave my dog to the neighbor"" makes more sense given what we know so far. Since the speaker didn't seem to be aware of their dog's disappearance until later on, it follows that they may have accidentally left her with their neighbor while outdoors. Perhaps they thought they were taking her for a walk but forgot to bring her back home. Given these circumstances, having the neighbor find your missing dog does make more narrative coherence than assuming they somehow acquired her through an unknown means. Therefore, based on available information within the text itself alone (i.e., without any additional context), option B appears likelier as the correct answer here!"
Response:  The woman in this scenario met her future husband at Costco, where he drew horns on her membership photo and flirted with her. This suggests that she found his behavior amusing or endearing, rather than off-putting. Furthermore, she agreed to go on a date with him despite not knowing much about him. This lack of caution suggests that she may have been feeling adventurous or open to new experiences. Given these factors, it seems more likely that she developed feelings for him over time and eventually married him. Therefore, option B (Eventually they had children) is the most likely outcome.
Response:  If Cindy got burned because the waitress forgot to warn her about the hot bowl, it would be logical for her to want to cool down her hands as soon as possible. Therefore, option A (running cold water over her hands) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Laura has always loved swimming, but she hasn't tried backstroke before. So option (B) is unlikely since it implies that she starts swimming backstroke after taking lessons which contradicts the fact that she had never tried it before. Therefore, option (A) is more likely.
"Response:  The protagonist starts off walking into town, which suggests they are feeling adventurous or eager to get out of their usual routine. They then decide to stop for coffee, which implies that they enjoy socializing and taking breaks during their journey. Finally, they choose an ""awesome"" little shop, which suggests that they have good taste and are looking forward to enjoying themselves. Based on these clues, it seems much more likely that the protagonist will say ""I had a wonderful time!"" rather than ""I hate bistro style dining."" Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
Response:  If Jess hates egg salad, then why would she want to feed it to the dog? It doesn't make sense. Therefore, option A is unlikely. Now let's consider option B. Jess deciding to make egg salad makes more sense since if she dislikes it, she might want to avoid eating it or find a way to get rid of it. So, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states that we ""went to a fancy restaurant"" which implies it was an upscale establishment. If this were the case, then option A would be more likely as people typically dress up for such occasions. Option B does not make sense given the context of the story. Therefore, the answer is (A) Robbie and I dressed up for the occasion."
"Response: 
The text states that Lonnie was ""fed up"" with modern life, which suggests that he may have been feeling overwhelmed or disconnected from society. Given this context, it seems unlikely that he would simply decide to give up on his plan to go off the grid without even trying it out. Therefore, option A is unlikely.

Now let's consider option B: ""After the initial noises Lonnie settled in for the night."" This option is more plausible because it takes into account the fact that Lonnie was initially scared due to the howls and rustling he heard in the woods. However, after getting used to the sounds, he might have felt more comfortable and settled in for the night. This option also aligns with the idea of Lonnie wanting to escape modern life and start anew in the wilderness."
Response:  The story states that Bob's car battery was struggling to start the car, which means he would have difficulty getting to work on time if he didn't receive help from his neighbor. Therefore, option A (Bob made it to work on time) is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
The statement ""She had earned enough miles"" implies that Ava has been collecting rewards or points through some loyalty program, such as flying with a particular airline or using their credit card. This means she already had miles accumulated in her account.
Therefore, option A is the correct answer - Ava was able to fly without spending any money on her ticket because she had enough miles in her account to cover the cost of the flight."
"Response: 
Sharon received news that her company wants her to retire. This means she will be receiving a pension from the company. However, this does not necessarily mean she will stop working altogether. Many people continue to work after they retire, either because they enjoy it or because they need the income. So option B is more likely."
"Response: 
The story states that Nita has been losing ten consecutive games of Rummy against her father. This implies that she has not been doing very well in these previous matches. Therefore, option (B) ""Nita hated playing Rummy"" is more likely since it aligns better with the context provided in the story."
"Response:  The story states that Tina had never been in a skating competition before, so it is unlikely that she would have taken second place in any previous competitions. Therefore, option B is not the most likely answer. Option A does not provide any information about Tina's performance in the competition, but since she was described as being ""incredibly nervous,"" it is possible that she may have used a security blanket to help calm herself down during the event. So, the most likely answer is Option A."
"Response:  The given story is about Neil visiting the Taj Mahal, admiring its beauty, and then hearing the sad story behind it. Now, let's consider the possible endings for this story based on the information provided:  
Option A: Neil thought the builder hadn't put in much effort. This option doesn't make sense because the story explicitly states that Neil admired the beautiful design of the Taj Mahal, indicating that he appreciated its craftsmanship. It's unlikely that he would later conclude that the builder didn't put in much effort. Therefore, Option A is not the most likely choice.  
Option B: Neil was glad he had seen the Taj Mahal. This option makes more sense considering the context of the story. After learning about the tragic history surrounding the Taj Mahal, Neil might feel grateful for having witnessed its beauty and being able to appreciate its significance. So, Option B is the most likely ending for the story."
Response:  The story states that Mark's mother brought out a sponge ball for Mark and Frank to play with, indicating she was actively involved in their game. Then it says they accidentally hit her with the ball, implying she was not paying attention or did not see it coming. Given these details, option B (Mark and Frank hit her again) seems more likely because it fits the sequence of events described in the story.
Response:  Ty was nervous about meeting new people at summer camp. He met Sam while playing soccer on the first day. Then, he met Brenda at the campfire that night. Finally, he met Bill at breakfast the next morning. This suggests that Ty had a good time socializing with his new friends throughout the day. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - they all hung out together at the lake that afternoon.
"Response: 
Vince wanted something sweet, but didn't want ice cream. So he went to Yogurtland. This means that he definitely wanted some frozen yogurt. Now, why would he throw it away? It makes no sense! Therefore, option A is the most likely answer. "
Response:  We know that Ned wants to learn how to play basketball, so he goes to watch the team practice. This shows us that he has an interest in learning more about the sport. Then we are told that the team watches him play and cheers for him! This tells us that the team is supportive of his efforts to improve his skills. Therefore, option B (Ned's skills improve) is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage is one of hardship and loss for Buck. He has lost his home and job, and is now sitting on the side of the road trying to beg for money. This suggests that he is feeling desperate and hopeless.

Now consider the woman who approaches him with information about a nearby shelter. She is offering him help and support at a time when Buck needs it most. It is unlikely that Buck would be angry or resentful towards her for doing so. Instead, he is probably grateful for her kindness and willingness to help. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Josh likes bees at first because he thinks they are good for the planet. This means that Josh has a positive view of bees initially. However, when he gets stung by one, it hurts him. This suggests that Josh may have developed a negative association with bees after being stung. Therefore, option B (Josh doesn't like bees so much anymore) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states that they ""bought three lottery tickets."" This means they spent money on them, which suggests they didn't win anything significant. Additionally, the story mentions that even a small chance at winning was worth it, implying that they didn't actually win anything substantial. Therefore, option B (They were happy to win a small amount of money) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
First, it's important to note that Fred has been going to this coffee shop for some time now, so he must have had several interactions with the barista already. This means she probably knows him well enough to recognize him when he comes in every morning. 
Now let's consider option A: ""She said yes."" In this scenario, the barista agrees to go out with Fred, which suggests that she finds him attractive or interesting as well. However, we don't know much about their personalities or compatibility beyond this initial attraction. It's possible they could hit it off and have a great time together, but there are also many potential obstacles that could arise from dating someone you work closely with (e.g., awkwardness during work hours, conflicting schedules). 
On the other hand, option B: ""Fred told the barista to leave him alone"" implies that things didn't quite go as planned. Perhaps the barista wasn't interested in going out with Fred after all, or maybe she felt uncomfortable due to their professional relationship. While this outcome might be disappointing for Fred, it's important to respect people's boundaries and decisions regarding romantic advances. After all, rejection can happen even when we least expect it! So while either possibility could occur based solely on what we know so far, I lean towards option B being more plausible given how little information we have about these characters outside of their brief interaction thus far."
Response:  We know that Jenny went to the store because she was hungry, and we also know that she ended up buying something (cookies). Therefore, option A is the most likely choice - Jenny did indeed buy the cookies.
Response:  The story states that Bob and Jenny went to the movies together, which means they spent some quality time together. Then it says they had a good time, which implies that their interaction was positive. Therefore, option B (Bob kissed Jenny goodnight) is the most likely outcome as it fits with the positive tone of the story.
Response:  The story says that you got your new truck and then went mudding. This means you were driving off-road on muddy terrain. Mud can be very messy and dirty, so it's likely that your truck got covered in mud during this activity. Then, the story mentions that you drove through lots of mud puddles. This implies that there were many small pools of mud on the ground that you had to navigate through while driving. Finally, the story states that your truck got really dirty. Given all these details, it seems unlikely that you would have been able to wash your truck in the driveway afterward. Instead, it's more likely that your truck would have needed to be cleaned at a car wash or detailing shop. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
Response:  Since Peter was excited to see Bernie at the rally, option A (He couldn't wait to vote for him) is the more likely choice. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response: 
The story states, ""the researcher was impressed by Josh's stories."" This implies that Josh has talent as a writer. If Josh refuses to take the money or quits the job, it means he is not valuing his own skills enough. It also shows that he may be ungrateful for the opportunity given to him. On the other hand, if Josh uses the bonus to repair his broken car, it shows that he values practicality over pride. He understands that having a reliable mode of transportation can help him in his career and personal life. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
If we start with ""Now, Ethan wanted to make and upload even more YouTube videos,"" it means that after gaining confidence from his first successful video, Ethan became motivated to create more content and share it with a wider audience. This option suggests that Ethan will continue to produce new videos and grow his channel.
On the other hand, if we choose ""Ethan decided to never make YouTube videos again,"" it implies that despite his initial success, Ethan lost interest or confidence in creating content for his channel. This option suggests that Ethan will stop making videos altogether.
Based on these two options, the most likely outcome of the situation is Option A: Now, Ethan wanted to make and upload even more YouTube videos."
Response:  If we choose option A, then we are assuming that the stranger has no other means of getting food or money. This seems unlikely as they were able to approach someone in the park and ask for change. Therefore, it is more likely that the stranger will find help from another person in the park (option B).
"Response: 
Option A says that they decide to wait for the librarian, which means they are willing to spend time there until she returns. This suggests that they value being able to use the library and its resources, which would make it unlikely that Gina hates the library (option B). Therefore, the most likely option is Option A: They decided to wait for her."
"Response: 
Ana saw a huge, scary fish swimming in the water! What would you do if you were Ana? You might scream for your friend or try to find a way around it. But since this is a story about Ana going swimming, we can assume that she knows how to handle herself in these situations. So let's choose option A: She screamed for her friend, unsure of what else to do."
"Response: 
The man in this scenario has already purchased a bike for his child that is the exact same model he used when he was younger. This implies that the father values the quality of the bike and believes it will be durable enough for his child to use for an extended period. Therefore, option (B) ""The man was very annoyed"" is the more likely choice because if the bike falls apart quickly, it would contradict the father's belief in its quality and value."
"Response: 
In this situation, Jaime wants Jack to go to the school dance with her but sees him holding hands with another girl when he exits the building. This would be very hurtful and embarrassing for Jaime, so it makes sense that she might freeze or feel speechless at first.
Based on the context, option B seems more likely - Jaime walks up to Jack and gives him a hug. While Option A suggests that Jaime cuts ties with Jack completely, giving him a hug could be seen as a way of showing empathy and understanding, while also expressing her disappointment and sadness. It's possible that Jaime may still want to maintain some level of friendship or connection with Jack, even if things don't work out romantically."
Response:  The premise of the story is that Billy's friends thought he was a scaredy-cat, but then he decides to enter a haunted house despite his fear. This implies that Billy is not necessarily a coward, as he faced his fear and did something that many people would find frightening. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer - Billy felt brave.
Response:  The story states that Ana has just had a baby girl, which means she must be a mother. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Ana does not have any children.
Response:  Why would Sally buy her mom roses if she didn't want them? It doesn't make sense that Sally would waste money on something her mom wouldn't appreciate. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states that the protagonist ""stole some hats"" when they were sixteen years old. This implies that the action of stealing occurred in the past. Then, it says that before the protagonist could leave the store, the security grabbed them and handcuffed them. This means that the security caught the protagonist red-handed (or red-hat-ed?) and took them into custody. Finally, the story suggests that either option A or B might be true, depending on how the protagonist felt about their actions afterward. Option A implies that the protagonist was praised for their daring thievery, while option B suggests that the protagonist was too embarrassed to ever steal again. So, based on the information provided in the story, it seems most likely that option B is true - the protagonist was so ashamed of their actions that they never stole again."
"Response: 
Matt has played baseball for ten years but hasn't hit a home run yet. This means that he has never been in this situation before where he needs to hit a home run to win the championship. It's unlikely that he will suddenly develop the ability to hit a home run after all these years of struggling. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Matt will hit a home run."
"Response: 
Cara's sweet sixteenth birthday party has just ended, and her parents have asked her to come outside. This already suggests that something special might be happening, as they wouldn't normally ask her to do this unless it were a big occasion. So far, so good!
Now let's consider option A: ""She took the car for a drive and thanked her parents."" Hmm...this could work, couldn't it? After all, getting a brand new car on your sweet sixteenth birthday is definitely something to be grateful for! And Cara would probably be excited about it too. But then again, maybe not. Maybe she'd feel overwhelmed or embarrassed by such an extravagant gift. It's hard to say for sure without more context.
Moving on to option B: ""She got angry with her parents and ran away from home."" Oh no, things are looking grim here! If Cara gets angry at her parents for giving her a new car, that doesn't really make sense. Why would she get angry about something like that? Unless there's some other issue going on that we haven't been told about yet...like perhaps her parents have been acting strangely towards her lately, or there's some kind of family conflict brewing under the surface. Again, without more information it's difficult to say what will happen next.
So in conclusion, while neither option seems particularly likely based solely on the information provided thus far (i.e., nothing in the text explicitly rules out either possibility), I suppose option A does seem slightly more plausible given the circumstances described up until now ‚Äì but ultimately only time will tell which direction this story takes us!"
Response:  The situation described is quite common, especially when moving into a new place or starting something new. People often find themselves alone at first until they get settled and meet others who share their interests. So option A seems more plausible here - Darlene might have found some common ground with the cashier and customer she met while searching for shelves, leading them to strike up a friendship.
"Response: 
The story states that ""the dining hall food was subpar"". This implies that the quality of the food served at the dormitory cafeteria was not satisfactory, which suggests that people were not happy with it. Therefore, option A is more likely. "
"Response:  The story states ""I introduced him to my cat."" This implies that Toby had not met the cat before, so option A (Toby does not like your cat) is unlikely. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option B: My family all loved Toby."
"Response: 
The story states, ""Tony was tired of stale store-bought bread."" This implies that Tony is not satisfied with the quality of bread he can buy in stores. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that Tony enjoyed the homemade bread he made using his mother's recipe."
"Response: 
Selena, as a famous singer, has many fans who admire her work. However, there are some fans who take their obsession too far and become stalkers or harassers. In this case, Selena decides to report one such fan to the authorities for being too intrusive and sending creepy messages. It is unlikely that she would simply ignore the situation and continue with her daily routine (option B). Instead, she will probably seek help from law enforcement agencies to protect herself from harm. Therefore, option A is the more plausible choice."
Response:  We know that Sam loves breakfast and specifically frozen waffles. So if there are only three waffles left in the box instead of four, it means that one waffle is missing. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer as Sam did indeed eat one waffle this morning.
"Response: 
The story states that ""the boy started crying very loudly."" This indicates that the child is upset and needs attention. Option B is the more likely choice because it shows the mother responding to her child's distress by running over to him and comforting him. It is unlikely that she would ignore him at such an age when he needs help and support. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Rick was trying to go to sleep but couldn't because of the fly buzzing around his room. Option A says that he tried to drown out the noise with the radio, which makes sense since he wanted to fall asleep. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  The story states that they were playing D&D, which implies that it was an indoor activity. Then it says they got together with drinks, implying that they were in a private space such as someone's home or a game store. Finally, it mentions things deteriorating and them stopping playing altogether, indicating that their activities became less structured and more social. Given these details, option B (They all decided to go to Vegas) seems unlikely because going on a trip would require more planning than what is described in the story. On the other hand, option A (They had a good time) seems more plausible since it aligns better with the information provided and does not require any additional assumptions.
Response:  We know from the text that Jen screamed out of her window, which means she was expressing herself loudly. Then we are told that her neighbors yelled back at her to be quiet. This suggests that they were not very supportive or understanding of Jen's feelings. Finally, it says that Jen screamed even louder and added some profanity. This tells us that she may have been feeling frustrated or angry about something. Based on this information, option B (Jen had the cops show up at her front door) seems like the more likely outcome. It makes sense that if Jen's neighbors were already unsupportive and then she started using profanity, they might call the authorities to intervene.
Response:  We know that Logan and Maria made a film together. This means they worked hard on it. So option A is more likely - they are probably proud of their work.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage suggests that Sam is feeling very nervous about an upcoming job interview. This means he wants the job badly and is anxious about doing well. It also implies that he may not have much experience with job interviews or feel unsure of himself. In this context, option B (Sam learns from the old man's advice and gets the job) seems more likely than option A (the old man tells Sam to go home). Why? Because if Sam is already feeling nervous before the interview, it's unlikely that he would be told to go home, especially since he has taken the time to travel to the interview location. Instead, he might appreciate some helpful tips or words of encouragement from a stranger. Therefore, we can conclude that option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  The little girl wanted a puppy, but her parents said no. This means she was not satisfied with their answer. So, she started to cry. Crying is an emotional response that can elicit empathy from others. It's possible that the little girl's tears convinced her parents to change their minds. Therefore, option A (They went to the animal shelter and picked out a cute puppy) is the most likely ending to the story.
Response:  The story mentions that Sara eagerly awaits December 1st, which suggests that she is excited for Christmas. Therefore, option A (She loves the lights) is the most likely answer.
Response:  The story states that Kate has been working out and keeping a healthy diet, which means she has been taking care of herself. This implies that she is dedicated to her fitness goals. Therefore, option B - Kate is proud - is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Option A states that Robert studied hard and won the contest, which means he did well and achieved his goal of winning. This outcome makes sense given Robert's determination and effort. On the other hand, option B suggests that Robert stopped trying and lost the contest on purpose, which goes against the characterization of Robert as a math genius who is determined to succeed. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option A.
Response:  John had just been driving for hours, so it makes sense that he would want to get back on the road quickly after stopping to check his tire. Option A is more likely because calling roadside assistance will help him fix the problem faster than if he were to wait for someone to come and change the tire himself. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Samantha has a craving for apple cider in the fall, which suggests that she enjoys it. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
The story states that John hadn't studied for his math test, which means he wasn't prepared for the test. This suggests that he wants to avoid taking the test. Therefore, option A is more likely. "
"Response: 
The sheriff has been chasing these outlaws for a long time, and he finally finds them sleeping in Blood Gulch. This means that they are tired and weak from running away from him for so long. It would be unrealistic if he suddenly decided to arrest them at this point. Instead, it makes more sense that he lets them go free since they have nowhere else to run and no way to escape anymore. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  At first, we are told that Josie found a spider ""underneath"" her bed. This suggests that she was in her room or near her bed when she noticed it. Then, instead of calmly observing the spider (which might be expected if she loves them), she uses Lysol to kill it. This implies that she doesn't want the spider there. Finally, after killing the spider, she sees it crawling up the wall and reacts by hitting the wall with a piece of paper. Again, this behavior does not suggest someone who likes spiders. Therefore, option B - Josie hates spiders - is more likely."
"Response: 
Nick saw a small leather wallet on the ground, picked it up, and found that it contained a lot of money. Instead of keeping the wallet for himself, he decided to take it to the police station to try to return it to its rightful owner. This shows that Nick has integrity and wants to do the right thing. Therefore, option A (the police never found the owner, so they gave it back to Nick) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  We know that Ken was on a vacation in the tropics, where he learned how to scuba dive. This means he must have enjoyed himself there, so option A is more likely. Therefore, we can conclude that Ken had the best vacation of his life while on this trip. 
"Response:  The person in this scenario is watching the news about hostages being taken and then shot, which means people are dying. This would be very disturbing and upsetting to anyone, regardless of their political views or beliefs. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - ""Terrorism is frightening."""
"Response:  The story states ""One summer she took a rake and attempted to pull one in."" This implies that Anne tried using tools to retrieve the flower. However, despite her efforts, she failed. This suggests that Anne may have overestimated her abilities or underestimated the distance between herself and the lily. It is unlikely that Anne would decide to give up on something as simple as retrieving a flower based solely on this failure. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response:  The story states ""Brian looked up a recipe for pork chops on the internet."" This implies that he wanted to cook something new or different. Then it says ""He chose the recipe calling for barbecuing the pork chops."" This means that he decided to grill them instead of another method like baking or frying. Finally, it says ""After going through all the steps,"" which suggests that he followed the recipe closely. So far, everything indicates that Brian took his time and effort in preparing the meal. However, the story then says ""Brian tasted the pork chops."" This contradicts the previous information as there is no indication that Brian actually tasted the food before serving it. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states that James was ""at the gym playing basketball."" This means he was indoors, which suggests it wasn't very cold outside. Therefore, option A - James driving home with the car window open - is unlikely because there wouldn't be much need for him to do this. Option B - James driving home to get changed into dry clothes - is more plausible given the situation described in the story. So, the answer is (B)."
"Response:  The story states, ""She didn't want the principal to know she was relieved."" This implies that Gina did not want to show any emotion of happiness or excitement towards getting lunch detention. Therefore, option A is more likely as it shows Gina trying to hide her smile while the principal doesn't notice."
"Response:  The story states ""Cole was well-behaved for months after that."" This implies that Cole did not think about the incident every day afterwards. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Now let's consider option B: ""Cole never got coal again."" This makes sense because if Cole was given coal as a gag gift, it's unlikely he would receive another present of coal in subsequent Christmases. So option B is more likely."
Response:  The story states that Mike spun a globe and his finger landed on Hawaii. This means that Mike did not choose any other country but Hawaii. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Tiffany did not read the instructions, so she may have misunderstood how long to heat the popcorn for. Therefore, option A (the popcorn had burned because she left it in too long) is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The story states ""In the lift line, we started talking to another couple."" This means there was no pre-arranged plan or invitation from either party to engage in any kind of sexual activity. It seems unlikely that two random couples would spontaneously decide to have group sex on someone's birthday without prior discussion or mutual consent. Therefore, option A (She had a horrible birthday) is more likely."
Response:  Nan feels guilty about leaving her pets alone during the day when she works. To solve this problem, she considers asking someone nearby to watch them. She chooses the neighbor kid who comes home from school around 3 pm each day. She offers him $5 per day to take care of her pets. This seems like a reasonable solution that benefits both parties. Therefore, the most likely outcome is Option B - The boy watches her cats for her.
Response:  The pizza place denied everything when they arrived at our house. This means they didn't admit any wrongdoing or offer an apology. Therefore, option A (They apologized and gave us another pizza) is not the correct answer. Since the pizza place denied everything, the best choice is option B (We ordered from another store).
Response:  If there were a worm in the muffin that Henry bit into, he would have noticed it before taking another bite. It is unlikely that he wouldn't notice something moving inside his food. So option B is more likely.
Response:  If Bob wanted the car to be the original color, he would have chosen that option when he dropped off the car at the paint shop. Since he did not choose that option, it means he liked the new color better. Therefore, the most likely answer is (B) Bob loved the new color he chose.
Response:  The story states that my aunt worked late every day last week, which implies that her workload was heavy. Therefore, option B (It was hard work) is the more likely answer.
Response:  If someone approaches you out of nowhere and stabs you, it is unlikely that you will be able to walk to a nearby hospital immediately afterward. You would probably need medical attention right away, which means you wouldn't have time for a leisurely dinner or two weeks of recovery time at the hospital. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
Fred just bought some new patio furniture, he built it and set it up outside himself. This means he put in effort and time into building it. Then a bad rainstorm came and ruined everything. This would make him feel disappointed or sad because of the loss of something he worked hard on. Therefore option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Jordy ""looked thoughtfully"" at his snowman after finishing it. This implies that he may be evaluating or assessing something about his creation. Option B suggests that he is feeling shame or regret, which doesn't quite fit with the tone of the story so far. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  The story states ""he was having a tough time learning all of the material."" This implies that John was struggling academically. Then it says ""John decided to do something about this."" This suggests that John took action to address his struggles. Finally, it says ""he met with the professors and got extra tutoring."" This further supports the idea that John took proactive steps to improve his academic performance. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Since Harold couldn't find the house despite looking all over town, he would have no reason to throw the package away. Therefore, option A is unlikely. Now let's consider option B. Harold might have checked his database and realized that the address was correct but the city was not. This is a common mistake people make when typing addresses wrong or forgetting the city name. So, option B seems more plausible.
Response:  We know that Amy wanted to get a manicure, so we can assume that she likes taking care of herself. Also, since she chose a bright red nail polish color, it means she probably enjoys bold and vibrant colors. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - Amy loves bright colors.
Response:  We know from the story that David went to John's lake house for the weekend and that John's family has a boat. So far, everything seems normal. However, things take an interesting turn when we learn that David was nervous about being on a boat for the first time. This suggests that David may not be as comfortable with boating as he thought he would be. Given this information, option A (David didn't have that much fun and became more nervous) is the most likely outcome.
Response:  If Nancy could not wait to get the rest of the pizza, then she would have taken it as soon as possible without asking for more. But since she did ask for more, we can assume she wanted to make sure she got what she paid for. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  After saying ""I decided to go to the library,"" it says that you caught up on some assignments. This means you did do some work while at the library. Then, it states that you had to wait several hours for your mom to pick you up. This implies that you were there for an extended period of time. Finally, it says that since you were extremely tired, you fell asleep completely. Given all this information, option B (you got up and ran a marathon) is not possible because you were already at the library for an extended period of time and then fell asleep without doing anything else. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: You didn't get any homework done."
Response:  The story states that Amy's low spirits were lifted just by being outside. This suggests that she has been feeling sad or depressed lately. Given this information, it is more likely that she will want to stay outside for as long as possible (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: She stayed outside until the sun went down.
Response:  The story states that you applied sunscreen before leaving for the beach but failed to reapply it during the day. This means that you were exposed to direct sunlight without proper protection, increasing your chances of getting a sunburn. Therefore, option A (I got a sunburn) is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
The premise of the story is that Jane wants to learn something new - juggling. She seeks out a professional to teach her. The professional teaches her for three weeks, and after those three weeks, Jane can juggle. This implies that learning juggling requires practice and instruction from an expert. It does not necessarily imply that Jane has a natural talent or lack thereof. In fact, it suggests that anyone can learn to juggle if they are willing to put in the effort and receive proper instruction. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Why did Tim not have the sauce for his noodles? Because he ran out. So, option A is more likely because Tim could easily get the sauce from outside sources such as a store or restaurant. Option B does not make sense since Tim will still want to eat noodles even if he doesn't have the sauce.
Response:  Why did grandpa ask Betty if she wants a drink? Because he knows that she might be thirsty, right? So why would Betty not want to tell grandpa what type of milk she wants? Maybe because she doesn't like sharing her preferences with others! Therefore, option B (Betty loves to share her opinions) is the correct answer.
"Response:  We know that Bella sat by the campfire with her friends and they are taking turns sharing scary stories. This means that there must be at least three people involved in this scenario - Bella and two other friends. Now let's consider option A - ""Bella's friends were very frightened by her story"". If this were true, then we would expect at least some reaction from Bella's friends after hearing her story. Perhaps they would gasp or shriek in fear, or even ask for more details about the story. However, since the passage doesn't mention any such reactions, it seems unlikely that Bella's friends were actually frightened by her story. Therefore, option A is less likely than option B. Option B states that Bella remained silent and skipped her turn, which could simply mean that she didn't want to share a story or wasn't feeling inspired to do so. It's possible that she just wanted to listen to her friends' stories without having to contribute anything herself. So based on the information provided in the passage, option B seems more plausible than option A."
"Response: 
Reasoning:  We know from the passage that Jasper noticed he had developed dandruff, felt embarrassed, and then bought an anti-dandruff shampoo. This suggests that Jasper was initially unhappy or dissatisfied with having dandruff. Therefore, option B (Jasper is disappointed) is the more likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
The story states ""Bob didn't know Jane"". This means they had no prior relationship or connection before this event. It also implies that Bob did not have any personal gain from helping Jane (he didn't even know her). Therefore, option B is more likely - Jane would be very thankful of Bob's generosity."
"Response: 
Amy arrives at the airport after her trip. She goes to the baggage carousel to collect her suitcases. However, when it comes time for hers to arrive, they don't show up. Amy becomes anxious because she can't locate her belongings. At this point, we might infer that Amy values her possessions highly or has spent a lot of money on them. Therefore option (B) Amy was upset is more plausible than option (A) Amy believed the airline had a good sense of humor since it would be unusual for an airline to play pranks with people's luggage."
Response:  We know that Paige has been smoking for ten years, which means she has become accustomed to it. However, she wants to quit, so she starts by cutting down on how many cigarettes she smokes each day. This shows determination and progress towards her goal of quitting altogether. As time goes on, she stops having cravings, indicating that her body is adjusting to life without cigarettes. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - now Paige is smoke-free and happy!
Response:  Since Gina has only eaten sweets, she will have an upset stomach due to indigestion. This can cause her to feel nauseous or even vomit. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
In this scenario, Ray has been working out to improve his physical appearance for a trip to the beach with his friends. He wants to look good in front of them. Therefore, option B is more likely. His friends are probably going to notice and admire his new physique, making him feel proud and confident. Option A is less likely because it doesn't make sense that Ray would run away crying after showing off his improved body; he should be feeling happy and satisfied with himself instead."
Response:  The situation described in the passage is as follows: Cristin went to a music festival, one of her favorite bands was supposed to perform there, but unfortunately, they had to cancel their appearance due to unforeseen circumstances. This means that Cristin missed out on seeing her favorite band perform live, which understandably makes her feel frustrated. Now, let's consider the two possible endings for this story: Option A: Cristin Enjoyed Seeing Her Favorite Band That Night. In this scenario, despite missing out on her original plan to watch her favorite band perform, Cristin still manages to have a good time at the festival. Maybe she discovers new artists or enjoys other performances, and overall, she has an enjoyable experience. This ending would suggest that Cristin is adaptable and can find joy even when things don't go according to plan. Option B: Cristin Decided Not to Go to the Festival Next Year. In this case, Cristin becomes disillusioned with the festival after her favorite band's cancellation and decides not to attend it again in the future. This ending implies that Cristin values consistency and predictability in her experiences and cannot tolerate any unexpected changes or disappointments. Based on the information provided in the passage, I believe that option A is more likely. It seems more plausible that Cristin will find ways to make the best of the situation rather than giving up entirely on the festival.
"Response:  The story states that customers noticed Paul had a ""really nice"" voice, which suggests it was above average quality. This means that if Paul were to pursue a career in radio, he would need to have some level of talent or skill in this area. Option A implies that Paul did indeed have such talent and went on to become a radio DJ. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states, ""Larry regretted that he hadn't seen his aunt in months."" This implies that Larry had not seen his aunt for some time and now he wants to make up for it. Option B is the correct answer because it shows that Larry starts making regular trips to see his aunt, which is what he wanted to do after realizing he hadn't seen her in months."
Response:  If Amy wanted to get something with caffeine, she would have chosen an option that has more caffeine than water. Since Pepsi contains more caffeine than water, it is the better choice for Amy. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story says ""Reba worried that she was going to be a killer, like her father."" This implies that Reba has some concerns about herself, perhaps fearing that she might turn out like her criminal parent. However, the story also states that Reba ""spent her entire life doing good deeds"" as a nun, which suggests that she actively sought to do good in the world despite any personal doubts she may have had. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer - Reba did think she was doing the right thing, even if she had some internal struggles with her own nature."
"Response: 
The story states that Cindy ""grew tired"" of doing everything on her own, which implies that she has been shouldering the burden alone for some time. This suggests that Option A - The family starts to help - is unlikely, as there is no indication in the story that the family has previously helped with the cooking or cleaning. Therefore, the most likely option is (B) The family agrees to sell their house."
"Response: 
Jeb likes peppermint candy. He has them in his pocket all the time. So if he sees someone else with peppermints, that means nothing. It just means they like peppermints too! And even if this other person does look nice, there's no guarantee that they will go out with him just because they both like peppermints. In fact, it's more likely that she doesn't want to go out with him based solely on their shared preference for peppermints. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  The story states that Billy likes sitting by the pond, he has a book about frogs, and there is a frog looking at him. This means that Billy is probably interested in frogs. Therefore, option A (Billy wasn't thinking about frogs) is unlikely. Now let's consider option B: Billy started reading his book out loud to the frog. While it's possible for someone to read aloud to an animal, it seems more likely that Billy would be fascinated by the frog staring at him rather than boring it with a book. So again, option B is less likely. Thus, the correct answer is option A: Billy wasn't thinking about frogs.
Response:  Since you are considering buying a new fountain pen, it means that you have an interest in collecting pens. And since you saw a video of the Pelikan M800 online, it must be a high-quality pen. Therefore, option A (You bought the pen) is more likely.
"Response:  The story states ""They drank wine"" which implies they are both adults. It also says ""As the group sang carols,"" which suggests this is happening during Christmas time. Finally, it mentions ""kissed."" This all points towards them being in a romantic setting. Therefore, option B (She felt it was meant to be) is the most likely answer."
Response:  We know that Tom has been practicing singing since he was 5 years old, which means he must have put in a lot of effort over the years. Then, when he auditions for American Idol, the hosts like his voice, which suggests they find him talented. Given these two pieces of information, it seems unlikely that Tom would be disappointed with getting into the competition. Instead, he might feel elated at the opportunity to showcase his talent on a national stage. Therefore, we can confidently choose option B as the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states ""He ate all different flavors of wings."" This implies that Jay tried many different types of wings before deciding to stop eating them. It also means that he enjoyed trying new things because he wanted to try as many different flavors as possible. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  The neighbor is playing loud music, which bothers the narrator. So, the narrator asks the neighbor to lower the volume. Option A is the correct answer because it implies that the neighbor agrees to lower the volume after being asked. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a cat.
"Response: 
Why would Joe hope that the stones are worthless? It doesn't make sense because if he finds something valuable, he can sell it and get money from it. If he hopes they are worthless, then he won't bother to take them to town to have them appraised, which means he will miss a chance to make some profit. Therefore, option A is not the most likely choice. 
Now let's consider option B: Joe hoped they were valuable. This makes more sense since finding valuable minerals or gems could bring him financial gain. So, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response:  The story states, ""His wife wants to distract Robert with something."" This implies that Robert is feeling down or sad about his lost dog. Option A fits this scenario best because it shows Robert starting to feel better after interacting with puppies. It's unlikely that Robert would suddenly decide he wants a cat instead of dogs, given the context of the story. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Robert starts to feel better after playing with puppies."
Response:  The story states that Lulu arrived at the candy store early, which means she had enough time to grab something before anyone else did. It also mentions that she grabbed a bucket, which suggests that she intended to buy something from the store. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - Lulu paid twenty-five cents for a full bucket of candy.
"Response: 
Teresa's mom was pregnant. This means that Teresa already had an older sibling or no siblings at all. So option (A) doesn't make sense because if Teresa didn't have any siblings before then how could she be excited about having one now? Therefore we can eliminate option (A). Now let's look at option (B): ""Teresa was so happy."" This makes more sense since it aligns with what you mentioned earlier - that Teresa was excited to have a new baby sister. So the correct answer is option (B)."
"Response:  The story states ""At lunchtime, another student approached him."" This implies there are other students around who can approach or hear their conversation. So option B is more likely - Sal finds out he isn't alone."
"Response: 
The story states that ""my roommate is a slob."" This implies that he may not be as tidy or organized as you would like, but it doesn't necessarily mean he is intentionally disgusting or unhygienic. It could simply mean that he has different habits or priorities than you do when it comes to cleanliness.
Furthermore, finding an old dirty dish in your kitchen does not necessarily imply that your roommate deliberately left it there. Perhaps they forgot to wash it, or maybe someone else used it without asking permission first.
In light of these considerations, option B seems more plausible - your roommate might indeed be pleasant to live with despite their perceived shortcomings in terms of housekeeping."
"Response: 
The story states that Jason loves using a Macintosh at home, which means he is already comfortable with the Mac interface. However, when he goes to work, he finds it difficult to get used to the PC operating system. This suggests that Jason may be struggling to adapt to the new environment.
Now, let's consider option A: ""Jason was reprimanded at work for not using the PC correctly."" It is unlikely that Jason would be reprimanded for this reason because he is simply trying to learn something new. Employers generally appreciate employees who are willing to learn and adapt to new situations, especially if they are doing their best to fit into the company culture. Therefore, option A is less likely to occur.
On the other hand, option B: ""Jason got a raise at work for being so good at working a PC"" makes more sense given the context of the story. Since Jason is able to quickly become proficient in using a PC, despite initially finding it challenging, it shows that he is capable of learning new skills and adapting to new environments. This could potentially lead to recognition or rewards from his employer, such as a raise. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur."
"Response: 
The story starts with ""My wife had MLK day off."" This implies that it is a federal holiday, which means that many people have the day off work or school. Therefore, option A is more likely. 
Next, the story states that she slept in and didn't get up until 10 AM. This suggests that she had a relaxing morning without any pressing obligations or responsibilities. Again, option A is more likely. 
Then, the story says that they had a leisurely breakfast together. This further supports option A, as having a relaxing meal together is consistent with a peaceful and enjoyable day. 
Finally, the story mentions that she watched Little House on the Prairie while he surfed the net. While this could be seen as a mildly diverting activity, it is unlikely to cause significant stress or tension. Therefore, option A is still the most likely choice."
"Response:  The narrator says they were ""very hungry"" when they woke up, which suggests that their hunger was intense. They then look through their house without finding anything to eat, which implies that they are not just mildly peckish but genuinely ravenous. Finally, they come across a box of pancake mix and decide to make multiple pancakes to satisfy their hunger. Given these details, it seems much more likely that the narrator will choose option A, ""I devoured the pancakes hungrily."" This choice aligns with the narrator's level of hunger and their desire to quickly fill their empty stomach. Option B, on the other hand, does not fit as well with the narrative because it would involve storing the pancakes in the freezer for later consumption, which might not be practical or appealing given the narrator's immediate need for sustenance."
"Response: 
The story states that Keri needs to put the niece to sleep early, but the niece has too much energy. This means that option A (taking the child for a walk) is unlikely because it would not help Keri tire the child out. Instead, Keri might try to find other ways to calm the child down, such as reading a book or singing a lullaby. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option B (convincing the waiter that she had been overcharged)."
Response:  Kim woke up and decided to drive to the mall. This means that she had some time to herself before arriving at the mall. It's unlikely that she would spend all of her money in one place without any other plans or activities for the rest of the day. Therefore, option B (Kim puts her things down and decides to go to a movie instead) is more likely.
Response:  Erica has to choose between taking her final exam or going to help her friends who are in an emergency. She decides to prioritize helping her friends over taking the exam. Then, she tells her professor about the situation, and the professor offers her the option of making up the final exam at a later date. This shows that the professor is understanding and willing to accommodate Erica's needs. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that Erica will be grateful for the professor's understanding and respond with Option B.
"Response: 
The story says that my old neighbor took Halloween too far. This means he went overboard with his costume. Therefore, option A is more likely. My old neighbor didn't dress up at all the next year because people complained about how much they disliked him going overboard on Halloween."
"Response:  The story states, ""Ben was waiting at the crossroads for a lift from his friend Tom."" This implies that Ben trusts Tom and expects him to arrive on time. Therefore, option A (Ben was annoyed that Tom had tricked him) is unlikely because Ben wouldn't be surprised or annoyed if Tom didn't show up as they have a good relationship. Option B (Ben saw Tom and ran for his life) is more plausible because the story mentions ""odd noises"" coming from the darkness, which could be interpreted as suspicious or threatening. So, the most likely ending to the story is option B."
Response:  Barry loved bowling, so it makes sense that he wants to find a place to bowl regularly. He looks in the yellow pages and decides to go to a new location on Saturday. This part of the story seems reasonable. Now let's consider each option: Option A says that Barry was delighted with the new alley. This doesn't make much sense given that Barry just found a new place to bowl. Why would he be delighted if he hasn't even tried it out yet? It's more likely that Barry will have mixed feelings about the new alley until he actually goes there and tries it out. Option B says that Barry threw his bowling ball into the pool. This is completely absurd! There's no reason why Barry would throw his bowling ball into a pool, especially since he wanted to go bowling in the first place. So, based on these reasons, I believe the most likely ending to the story is Option B: Barry didn't throw his bowling ball into the pool.
Response:  We know that the family prepared food and packed it away before walking to the nearby park. This suggests they were planning ahead and taking some effort to make sure everything was ready for their picnic. Then we see them laying out a blanket and setting out their food, which implies they are enjoying themselves and having a nice time together. Based on these details, option A (the family had a good day) seems like the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
The premise of the story states that Brad and Allison love Texas country music, so it is unlikely that Brad would decide to go to a rock concert instead (Option B). Therefore, the most likely outcome is that they will have a good time at the concert together (Option A)."
Response:  Melissa has been obsessed with being a TV news reporter since childhood. This means that she has spent years preparing for this career path. She attends college for journalism and makes good grades. Now it's time for her to enter the workforce. Option A states that after graduation, she gets a job offer from NBC News. This suggests that Melissa's hard work and dedication have paid off, and she lands her dream job right away. Option B states that after graduation, she realizes she hates the news. This would mean that despite all of her efforts, Melissa finds out that she doesn't enjoy working in the field she always wanted to be in. Based on the information provided, option A is more likely because it shows a positive outcome for Melissa's career aspirations.
"Response:  The story states that Dot was tired of being the ""strict"" mom, which implies she has been too controlling or demanding in the past. However, taking her kids to get ice cream and going to a movie together suggests she wants to have fun and bond with them. It doesn't necessarily mean she will become the ""cool mom,"" as this term often connotes a lack of discipline or responsibility. In fact, it could be argued that Dot's sudden change in behavior may cause confusion or chaos among her children, leading to potential problems down the line. Therefore, option A (Dot files for divorce the next day) seems like the more plausible outcome given the information provided in the story."
Response:  We know it snowed heavily, so it must be cold outside. And we also know that they are building a snowman and a snow fort, which means they need to be dressed warmly. Therefore, option A (They took their clothes off to sunbathe) is highly unlikely as it would not make sense given the weather conditions. Option B (They went inside to roast marshmallows) is more plausible since roasting marshmallows is an activity that can be done indoors while still enjoying the winter weather. So, the correct answer is option B.
Response:  First, we know that the person in the story has their phone in their pocket. Then they try to get it out but have trouble because their pockets are tight. This means that there is some resistance when trying to remove something from the pocket, which could cause the object to come loose or even fall out. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - the phone might have ended up jumping out of the person's pocket due to the difficulty in removing it.
Response:  We know that Bobby enjoys watching snowfall, so option B makes more sense as it implies that he went outside in the snow to experience it fully. Option A does not make much sense since tanning requires warm weather, not cold snowy conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Bobby let the snow cover him from head to foot.
"Response: 
The situation is this: Garry has failed two tests recently (Math and English). He needs good grades to play football. His coach found out about it and talked to him. Now we are considering what might happen next.
From the context of the story, option A seems more likely than option B. Here's why:
* Option A aligns better with the situation described in the passage. Garry's coach wants him to do well in school so he can stay on the team, which makes sense given the importance of academic performance for athletes.
* Option B is quite random and unrelated to the story. While Nike does make good sneakers, there is no connection between them and Garry's situation. It would be unusual for his coach to bring up an entirely different topic like that without any relevance to the conversation.
Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, option A seems the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Evan complained about everything his girlfriend made for dinner. This suggests that he has a critical attitude towards her cooking skills. If this is the case, then option B (Evan was pleased) is more likely because he might have been happy that she finally stopped trying to make him food. However, without further context or information, we cannot be certain which ending is true."
Response:  The story states that John made fun of his sister for practicing yoga, implying that he didn't take her seriously. Then, he attends a yoga class with her and finds himself struggling to keep up with the other women. This suggests that John may have underestimated the physical demands of yoga and overestimated his own fitness level. Therefore, option A (John felt humbled) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Why did Ava need to take her child shopping? Because he didn't have any shoes on! That means that she cared enough about her child to make sure he had proper footwear, which is exactly what responsible parents do. So option B is the correct answer here.
Response:  The story states that Harry is tired of the hot summer days, which means he wants to do something fun to cool off. It also mentions that he decides to go swimming with his friends, which implies that he enjoys being around them and doing activities together. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - Harry and his friends did have a great time at the lake.
"Response: 
The story states that ""Danny wanted to learn how to make fried rice."" This implies that Danny has an interest in cooking, which is not typically associated with hatred towards any gender. Therefore, option A is unlikely.

Now let's consider option B: ""Danny did a great job."" Since the story does not provide any information about Danny's performance, we cannot determine whether he did a great job or not. However, based on the context of the story, it seems more plausible that Danny would struggle with making fried rice rather than doing a great job. So again, option B is also unlikely."
"Response: 
From the information provided in the passage, we know that Meghan loves her job and is very good at it (as a Scientist II). This suggests that she enjoys her current role and is performing well. Therefore, option A - ""Meghan hoped she would be promoted"" - is the most likely outcome. It makes sense that Meghan would want to continue growing within her current position rather than leaving the company entirely."
Response:  The story states that Core broke an antique vase, which suggests it may be valuable or important to her parents. If they come into the room without realizing what happened, they might not notice the broken vase immediately. However, when they take off their shoes, it becomes clear that something is amiss. Option A is therefore more likely, as it fits with the information provided in the story.
Response:  The story states that Bob initially struggled with solving the Rubik's Cube but eventually managed to solve half of it. This suggests that Bob persisted in trying to solve the puzzle despite facing challenges. Therefore, option A (Bob worked hard and finally solved the puzzle) is the more likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states that Tim planned a surprise trip to the Bahamas for his girlfriend, which suggests he put thought and effort into it. It also says she was ""so grateful"" for the vacation, which implies she appreciated the gesture. Therefore, option A (Tim was happy with her reaction to the gift) is more likely."
"Response: 
Step 1: The protagonist (Suzie) decides to make her grandmother's spaghetti sauce. This indicates that she has a positive connection to her grandmother.
Step 2: Suzie makes the sauce, adds mushrooms, and seasons it. These actions demonstrate her attention to detail and effort in making the sauce.
Step 3: Suzie tastes the sauce. If the sauce turns out well, which is implied by ""it was just right,"" this would suggest that their relationship improved as a result of Suzie's efforts. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  The story states that the protagonist ""wanted to buy some shoes"" which implies that their goal was to purchase footwear. Option A suggests that this goal was accomplished successfully, whereas option B introduces an unrelated detail about buying a taco. Therefore, it is more likely that the protagonist found a suitable pair of shoes in the end. So, the answer is (A) I found a perfect pair of shoes and bought them."
Response:  Gabby doesn't have much money, so buying a lottery ticket isn't going to make her rich. It might give her some temporary pleasure if she wins but ultimately won't change her financial situation. So option B is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states that Annie's grandfather needed a heart transplant because he was sick. This means that his condition was not good. Therefore, option B (Annie's family was sad) is more likely."
Response:  The boy who walked up to me introduced himself as Jack. He asked if I wanted to play with him at recess. So, option A is correct! I felt less lonely after meeting Jack.
"Response: 
The story states that Larry has a fear of heights. This means that option A (he turns around to choose another route) is more likely because it aligns with Larry's character trait. It would be inconsistent with his personality if he suddenly felt comfortable driving over a high bridge despite his phobia. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states that Jeff ""can get out of just about any situation he doesn't want to be in."" This implies that Jeff often finds himself in situations he would rather avoid, such as talking to his in-laws. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer - Jeff hates spending time with his in-laws."
Response:  First, Binh decides to wash her cat. This means that before starting the process of washing, the cat must have been dirty or stained somehow. So option A (the cat ends up as a filthy mess) seems more plausible than option B (the cat ends up squeaky clean). Therefore, I would choose Option A.
"Response:  The speaker says they ""ordered a family meal"" which means they paid for the whole thing themselves. Then they say their family ""attacked it."" This implies that they didn't eat much from the meal themselves. Finally, after everyone had finished eating, there was no food left. So, option B (the speaker wants to file a complaint) is the most likely answer because the speaker feels cheated or ripped off since there wasn't any food left after everyone had eaten."
"Response: 
Humberto liked to jump on a trampoline but had never fallen off before. So option A is unlikely because it states he never fell off again after this incident. It's more likely that he continued jumping on the trampoline as usual since he hadn't experienced any negative consequences before. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Matt and Tammy exchanged numbers after meeting at a nightclub, which means they have been talking on the phone regularly. This suggests that their relationship has progressed beyond just a casual encounter. 
Now, let's consider option A: Tammy felt jealous when she saw Matt and Emma together. While it's possible that Tammy could feel this way, it doesn't quite fit with what we know about their relationship so far. If Tammy was comfortable enough to share her number with Matt, then she must trust him enough to be around other people. So, it seems unlikely that she would suddenly become jealous just because he's talking to someone else. 
On the other hand, option B does make more sense given what we know about the situation. Since Tammy hasn't had a chance to talk to Matt since seeing him with Emma, she might be feeling anxious or upset about not being able to reach him. Perhaps she's worried that he won't respond to her messages anymore or that something serious happened while they were apart. In any case, option B seems like a more plausible outcome based on the information provided in the story."
Response:  If Ben's hand hit a cactus, it would probably be covered with spines or needles. So option B is more likely because it describes what actually happened after hitting the cactus. Option A doesn't make sense since there's no reason for Ben's hand to feel good after getting pricked by thorns.
"Response:  The story states ""No matter where she had to go, she would always travel by land."" This implies that Janet has never flown before and therefore has no experience with it. Additionally, the fact that she is worried about her mother being sick suggests that she values her safety above all else. Given these details, option B is the more likely outcome - Janet will have to face her fear and take a flight to reach her mother as quickly as possible."
"Response: 
Nate paid his roommate to do the chore, but the roommate didn't follow through on their agreement. This means that Nate has been left with an undone task, which could be frustrating or stressful for him. Given this context, option A seems more likely: Nate may have found it difficult to muster the motivation to confront his roommate about their failure to complete the task. It might take some courage or effort for him to bring it up, especially if he values his relationship with his roommate. On the other hand, option B doesn't quite fit with the situation described in the story. There's no indication that Nate laughed with his friends about the situation, so this option seems less plausible."
"Response: 
Option A states that the guy proposed to Elena after six months of dating. This seems unlikely as it takes time for someone to get to know each other well enough to decide if they are compatible long term. It also doesn't take into account any potential issues or concerns that may arise during the relationship. 
On the other hand, Option B suggests that the guy brought a full-sized woman to his company's holiday party. While this could be seen as an insensitive move, it's important to remember that people come in all shapes and sizes, and everyone deserves respect and dignity regardless of their size. It's possible that the guy simply wanted to introduce Elena to his friends and colleagues, but it's also possible that he was trying to make a point about body image and acceptance. Without more information, it's difficult to say which option is most likely."
"Response:  The story states ""Jay was nervous about being an aunt"" which implies some level of apprehension or unease on her part. However, when she sees her nephew, it says ""she finally came home from school and saw him."" This suggests that she had not yet met him before this point in the story. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it implies that Jay's initial fears were unfounded once she actually met her nephew."
"Response: 
The situation started with Jon feeling thirsty. This could happen to anyone, so we can't blame him for that. Then, he decided to go buy water from the store. This is a reasonable decision since everyone needs water to survive. However, on his way back home, he got into a car accident. Now, this is where things get interesting. If Jon had not gone to buy water, he might still be driving and potentially getting into an accident. So, in this case, it's possible that Jon is actually grateful he went to buy water, even though he got into an accident on the way back. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
Response:  We know that Daria bought a new TV for her living room. This means she must have been happy about it. So option A is more likely. Therefore, the answer is (A) Darla turned on her television and began to watch a movie.
Response:  White roses are Lily's favorite flowers, so she grows them in her garden. Then she pricks her finger on one of the thorns while tending to them. Now, this could lead to two possible outcomes: either her finger gets infected or she needs to get it amputated. However, since the story doesn't provide any details about Lily's medical condition or the severity of the injury, neither option can be said with certainty. Therefore, I would choose Option B - The prick got infected and she had to take antibiotics. This outcome seems more plausible given that a small cut or prick from a rose thorn can easily become infected if not properly cleaned and treated.
Response:  The story states that Jimmy visited his mother who was sick in the hospital, which means she must have been ill or injured enough to require medical attention. This implies that she may not be feeling well enough to take care of herself, let alone attend to any personal matters like getting well cards from her son. Therefore, option (B) Jimmy hates his mother seems unlikely as there is no indication in the story that he has any negative feelings towards her. Option (A), on the other hand, makes more sense given the context provided in the story - it suggests that Jimmy's mother might start recovering from her illness after receiving the flowers and get well card from him.
Response:  Sammy has a terrible stomachache but decides not to turn back from going to school. This suggests that she values attending school more than alleviating her discomfort. Option B is therefore the most likely outcome as Sammy chooses to suffer through the pain rather than missing school.
Response:  Since Karmen had already gone through airport security, she would have been checked in and seated on the plane before it took off. Therefore, option A (the plane took off and Karmen relaxed) is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
Sandy lives in New York. It's winter. There is a snowstorm coming. The power goes out during the storm. What would you do if you were Sandy? Most people will prepare their homes for bad weather like this. They might board up windows or stockpile food and water. So option B is more likely. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
"Response:  The story states that Quentin ""ordinarily does not enjoy going to company events."" This implies that Quentin typically feels uncomfortable in social situations like parties. However, in this particular instance, Quentin decided to attend the party despite his usual dislike for such gatherings. So option A - Quentin ended up enjoying the party - seems more plausible than option B - Quentin loved being there with all the people."
Response:  If you were happy about how easy it was to place the order, then option A would be the correct answer. However, since the sale did not go through despite your efforts, option B is more likely. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Finally the sale went through.
Response:  The story states that Dan wants to dress up as the Devil for Halloween, but he is too afraid to ask his father for the costume. This means that Dan lives with his father. Therefore, option A is unlikely because if Dan's grandmother was already dressed as the Devil, she would not have been able to tell Dan that going as the Devil is evil since she would be in disguise herself. Option B is more likely because it implies that Dan made his own costume, which could explain why he didn't want to ask his father for it.
"Response:  The story states that Franz had a ""terrific"" time with his cousin, which suggests they got along well and enjoyed each other's company. This makes option B (Franz is glad he went to visit his cousin) more likely than option A (Franz vows to never visit his cousin again), as it aligns better with the information provided in the story."
"Response: 
The story states that the author bought the horned toad at a department store when they were ten years old. This means that the event occurred at least twenty years ago (since the author is now ten + twenty = thirty). Therefore, option B is more likely since the toad could have been fed and grown fat over time."
"Response: 
From the information provided in the passage, it seems that Nancy and the narrator had a brief encounter and exchanged contact information. However, after this initial meeting, Nancy began constantly messaging the narrator. The narrator decides to call her and ask her to stop calling them. This suggests that the narrator finds the constant messages annoying or intrusive.
Now, let's consider the two possible endings to the story:

Option A: She loved eating bananas.
This option implies that there is something unusual or peculiar about Nancy, perhaps even obsessive behavior. However, based on the information provided in the passage, there is no indication of anything strange or unusual about Nancy's behavior. Therefore, Option A is unlikely.

Option B: I never heard from her again.
This option is more plausible given the context of the passage. After the narrator asks Nancy to stop calling them, they do not hear from her again. This could suggest that Nancy respected their request and stopped contacting them. Again, there is nothing in the passage to indicate that Nancy was particularly interested in the narrator or that their interaction would have any lasting impact. Therefore, Option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Kelly went to CVS to buy candy, so it's unlikely that both of them got arrested (Option A). It's more probable that Kelly's friend bought the candy for her since they caught up and talked for a while (Option B). Therefore, the correct answer is Option B."
Response:  The story states that Don was nervous being around heavy machinery, which suggests that he may not be comfortable or confident in his new job. Additionally, the fact that he dropped a heavy shipment and it almost hit a fellow coworker implies that he made a mistake that could have caused harm to someone else. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Don will have to improve his performance and become more careful in his duties to avoid any accidents or mistakes that could put himself or others at risk.
"Response: 
If we assume that Dal wanted to go to college, then option A is more likely because it suggests that he made a mistake or poor choice when he started working with the gang. This could have led to his death, which would prevent him from achieving his goal of attending college.
On the other hand, if we assume that Dal knew what he was getting into and understood the risks involved, then option B might be more likely. In this case, Dal may have intentionally taken on the job as an accountant for the gang to gain access to their financial records and potentially uncover evidence of illegal activities. Unfortunately, things went wrong during the raid, and Dal lost his life."
Response:  We know that Alice got dressed in a new outfit for picture day, which means she must have been feeling happy about it. Additionally, the fact that her mother fixed her hair suggests that Alice looked presentable and put together. So, option A - Alice felt good after the photographer complimented her - seems like the more likely choice.
Response:  The story states that Nila's mom had stage four cancer, which means she didn't have much time left. This implies that Nila would want to spend as much quality time with her mom as possible before she passes away. Therefore, option B (Nila loves her mom) is the more likely answer.
"Response: 
The story states, ""She dreamed of their future together."" This implies that the mother has positive feelings towards her son and wants to provide for him. 
Furthermore, the story mentions that she sacrifices time and energy to accomplish her goal. This suggests that she is willing to put in effort to make sure her son has a good life. 
Based on these clues, it is more likely that Option B (the boy had a very happy childhood) is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states, ""They woke up and ran to the Christmas tree."" This implies that it is still nighttime or early morning when they run to the tree. If they woke up early, it would be daylight already, which means there wouldn't be any boxes under the tree yet since Santa Claus hasn't arrived yet. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
The story states, ""Kim decided to take away all dragon and fantasy books from her kid."" This implies that Kim has taken a deliberate action to remove something from her child's environment. It is unlikely that she would then throw those same books away without any further consideration or discussion with Jan. Therefore, option A is not the most likely outcome.

Now let's consider option B: ""Jan brought the books back."" While it is possible that Jan may have changed her mind about the importance of imagination and fantasy in her child's education, there is no indication in the story that she did so. In fact, the story explicitly states that Jan was upset when Kim removed the books, which suggests that Jan may still hold the opposite view. Therefore, option B is also not the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states that ""We walked there with two of my closest friends."" This implies that there are at least three people in the story, including the narrator. Additionally, the story states that they were all assigned to the same classroom. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - all three of them were very disappointed."
Response:  Why did Jeff want the dog to stop barking? Because it woke him up early every morning! Now, why do you think Jeff was happy when his neighbor got rid of the dog? That's right - because there was no more barking! So, the correct answer is (A) Jeff would finally get peace and quiet.
"Response: 
In this scenario, Holly was upset because she didn't like what her brother did to her back while applying sunscreen. Option A suggests that Holly would yell at her brother in anger or frustration. However, since Holly is only a child, it's unlikely that she would use such strong language or react so harshly. Instead, option B seems more plausible, as children often respond to pranks or mischief by giving their siblings small gifts or rewards as a way of making up for any discomfort caused. Therefore, I choose option B as the most likely outcome."
Response:  The husband used to make fun of his wife for using a nightlight, but then he had an accident when he didn't use one himself. This suggests that he has learned his lesson and will no longer make fun of his wife for something that helped him avoid an injury. Therefore, the most likely answer is (B) I never made fun of my wife and her nightlight again.
Response:  Amy moved from Wisconsin to Florida, which means she left behind her friends in Wisconsin. This implies that she did not bring them with her on the move. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - the experience was no fun without her friends.
Response:  We know that Kathy liked the shoes because she bought them, so option A (she hated buying shoes) is unlikely. Now let's consider option B (she felt buyer's remorse after the purchase). This could be true since sometimes people feel regretful about purchases they make, especially if they are expensive. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  We know that Amayah loves dressing up in costumes, so option A makes sense. It also aligns with the fact that she's turning five years old, which is typically an exciting age for kids. Therefore, we can conclude that option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The story says ""the boys and I"" which means that there are only boys involved. Option A does not make sense because if there were only boys, then they would be the ones who made new friends, not you. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  If it was Friday night, that means it was evening or nighttime already. So, option A is more likely as people tend to relax and unwind after a long week of work on Fridays. Option B doesn't make sense here as going to work directly after watching a movie isn't something people usually do. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option A states that Paula's friends applauded her poem, which means they liked it. However, if Paula's friends are supportive even though her poetry is bad, then it's more likely that they would encourage her to keep writing and not tear up her work. Therefore, option A is less likely than option B. "
"Response: 
The narrator says they got off the school bus and realized their phone was missing. This implies they were not carrying it with them when they left the bus. Therefore, option A (I knew someone had stolen it) is more likely since there is no indication of anyone returning the phone."
Response:  Why would Iris decide never to have cake again after having so much fun at her party? It doesn't make sense, does it? Therefore, option B is not the most likely answer. Option A is the correct choice because it aligns with what we know about Iris's experience - she had fun at her party.
"Response: 
The story says that Tina's friends were surprised to see her wearing a blue bikini instead of her usual red one. This implies that they are used to seeing her in the same outfit every time, so option B is more likely. Therefore, the answer is (B) Tina's friends knew how unpredictable she was."
"Response:  The story states ""Ted had always dreamed of being a homeowner."" This implies that owning a home has been something important to Ted all along. Then we learn that Ted's father will help him buy a house. This suggests that Ted now has the means to achieve this long-held goal. Therefore, option B (Ted was grateful to his father) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Evie wandered around the castle for hours, which means she spent a significant amount of time there. Then, her supervisors asked her questions about what she had learned, indicating that they were impressed with her knowledge. Therefore, option A (She was proud of herself) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  The story says that Ed and Ethan are identical twins. This means that Sami and Sara are also identical twins. If this is the case then it would be highly unlikely that they would meet on an online dating site and arrange a date without realizing who they really were meeting. It seems much more plausible that they would realize who they were meeting and decide not to pursue anything further due to the unethical nature of their actions. Therefore option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
Marco is excited about his new job, so he wants to make a good impression. This means he will dress appropriately for work. He chooses to wear a necktie because it is a common accessory in many professional settings. When he meets his new boss, the boss is pleased with how well-dressed Marco appears. This suggests that option A is more likely."
Response:  The story says that Tim has never been on an airplane before, so he doesn't have any experience with flying. However, after his first flight to China, he enjoys it. This means that he found the experience pleasant enough to want to do it again. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Tim starts traveling a lot of places by airplane.
Response:  We know that Lucy didn't study much before the test, so it's unlikely that she will ace it. Moreover, since there was a snowday the next day, she got an extra day to study which could have helped her prepare better. Therefore, option B (Lucy failed the test because she hadn't studied) seems more plausible than option A (Lucy aced the test).
"Response: 
The story states that Fred likes reading mystery novels and gets irritated when his friends shower him with attention on his birthday. This suggests that Fred values his privacy and doesn't enjoy being the center of attention. Therefore, option A - ""Fred told his friends he was taking a break from mystery novels"" - is more likely. It implies that Fred wants some space and time alone, which aligns with his personality traits revealed in the story.  On the other hand, option B - ""Fred started a mystery novel book club for his friends"" - goes against Fred's character. Starting a book club would require him to be social and interactive, which contradicts his desire for privacy."
"Response: 
Reasoning:  We know that Tia has a big order to fill, which means she needs a lot of flour. If she runs out of flour, it will be difficult for her to fulfill her orders on time. Therefore, option B (Tia was relieved) is the correct answer."
Response:  Sarah, her friends, and she all enjoyed themselves at the water park. They paid money to get in and spent time waiting in line for the big slide. Once they were on the slide, they had fun going down it together. This suggests that they liked the experience enough to want to do it again. Therefore, option B (They went back the next day) is more likely.
"Response: 
Sam knocked down Jeb's statue, which means he destroyed something that Jeb had worked hard on. This might make Jeb feel sad or upset. However, instead of laughing and running away, Sam could have shown empathy towards Jeb and helped him rebuild the statue. This would be more likely as Sam is supposed to be Jeb's friend. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
We know that Jeff is excited about the field trip, so option A (Jeff had a fun time) seems unlikely. We also know that the rainy forest isn't exciting, so option B (Jeff was bored and upset) seems more plausible. Therefore, we should choose option B as the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states ""One night her estranged father was one of her patients."" This implies that they had a difficult relationship in the past. Option A is more likely because it suggests that Dani wasn't surprised by the unexpected turn of events, given their complicated history together. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Given that Jane is Joe's sister, it means they have a family connection. This could potentially create an opportunity for friendship or bonding. However, if Jane is being rude and sticky towards Gina, then it may not be easy to become friends with her immediately. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
If Ella had forgotten to apply sunscreen, she would have gotten burnt. This is what happened in the first part of the story. However, as you mentioned, the burn eventually faded and turned into a tan. So, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
If Neil was mauled by a lion, he would not have been able to join the safari tour or take any photos. Therefore, option A is unlikely. 
On the other hand, if Neil took many photos during his safari adventure, it makes sense that he would want to create an album upon returning home. Option B is more plausible."
Response:  Gina followed the recipe carefully, so we can assume that she took proper precautions when baking the pie. Since it turned out well, there's no reason to believe she would want to discard it. Therefore, option B (She shared the recipe and the pie with all her friends) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Pablo wants a jawbreaker but has no money, so he goes through his closet to find something to sell. He finds a toy bear and sells it for 50 cents. Now he has 50 cents + the value of the toy bear = $1. So now he can buy his jawbreaker! Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option A: Then he bought his candy.
"Response: 
The story states that ""the decorations were great."" This implies that everything else about the party setup was good too. However, there was one thing missing‚Äîa disco ball. So, option B is more likely because it suggests that adding the disco ball made the party even better."
Response:  Oscar decided to buy a Bonsai tree because there were many other trees available that would have gone better with his home decor. This means that option A is not the correct answer. Therefore, we can conclude that Oscar probably did something bad to the Bonsai tree after bringing it home, making option B the more likely outcome. So, the answer is (B) He destroyed it as soon as he got home.
Response:  If you are playing a basketball game, it means you are part of a team. So, option A is more likely because you would want your team to win rather than walk away from the game without trying.
"Response: 
The story states that ""one of the keys broke off"" Dirk's keyboard during his performance. This means that Dirk had no control over what happened and couldn't have intentionally made the music sound bad on purpose. Therefore, option A (Dirk was embarrassed) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  The story states that Eva loves the squirrels, so option A is unlikely because it implies she is afraid of them. Option B is more plausible since it suggests a positive interaction with one of the squirrels. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Eva was able to pet one of the squirrels.
Response:  The story states that Andy loves the beach, so option A (Andy hates the beach) cannot be true. Now let's consider option B (Andy was sad about it). This option makes sense because when it starts raining on the way to the beach, Andy might feel disappointed or sad about not being able to enjoy the beach as he had hoped. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The customer received a phone case with no lanyard, which was advertised on the website as included. This means that the product did not match what was promised or described. As a result, the customer may feel frustrated or disappointed. Therefore, option B (the customer felt foolish) is more likely."
Response:  Why would you want to cut the sheets into strips? You just said that you are happy with how nice and fresh they look, so it doesn't make sense to cut them up! Therefore, option A (I am happy they weren't too expensive) is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
Chase really wants a new toy, but his mother will not buy it for him. So, he decides to save his allowance instead. This means that he has been saving up money for a long time in order to buy something he really wants. Now, let's consider the two possible endings to the story:

Option A: Chase buys himself a new toy.
This option suggests that after saving up his allowance for a long time, Chase finally has enough money to buy the new toy he wants. It's a logical conclusion to the story since Chase has been working towards this goal for some time now.

Option B: Chase runs away from home.
On the other hand, running away from home is an extreme measure that doesn't make much sense in this context. Why would Chase run away just because his mother won't buy him a new toy? It's unlikely that he would take such a drastic action without any other reason. Moreover, running away can have serious consequences, including getting lost or hurt, so it's not a feasible solution here. Therefore, Option B is less likely than Option A."
Response:  The story states that Renee was inspired by the music of Eddie Van Halen, which means he played guitar. Therefore, option A is more likely as Renee will continue learning how to play guitar.
"Response: 
The story states that Bill's neighbors were poor before they received the fish from Bill. This means they did not have enough money or resources to buy food, which suggests they are struggling financially. Therefore, option A is unlikely because it goes against the context of the story. Instead, option B is more plausible as it aligns with the narrative. After receiving the fish from Bill, his neighbors could express their gratitude by offering something in return, such as baking him bread."
"Response:  The author states that they were ""bored out of their minds"" without anything else to do, yet in both endings they had a good time. This implies that they are exaggerating how bored they were initially. Therefore, it is more likely that Option B is true - they were happy to not have internet and enjoy each other's company instead."
Response:  We know that Tim has been wanting to make music for his whole life. He practices every day, so we can assume that he is passionate about it. Now, let's consider what happens after he records himself at the studio. Option A states that Tim decides he doesn't like music anymore, which seems unlikely given how much he wants to make music throughout the story. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Tim becomes a professional musician.
"Response: 
The story states, ""Tigger was constantly scratching himself day and night."" This suggests that Tigger has an itchy problem, which could be caused by fleas. 
If we choose Option A, then the story would continue as follows: ""They gave him a flea medication and it cleared up."" This means that after giving the medication, Tigger stopped scratching himself and became healthy again. However, this outcome seems unlikely since it doesn't take into account any potential side effects of the medication or other factors that may affect Tigger's health.
On the other hand, if we choose Option B, then the story would continue as follows: ""Alex decided not to give the cat the medication prescribed."" This implies that Alex chose not to treat Tigger for his fleas despite knowing about their presence. While this option does address some concerns regarding possible side effects from medication, it also ignores the fact that leaving untreated can lead to further discomfort for Tigger and potentially cause more serious problems in the future. Therefore, based on these considerations, I believe Option B is less likely than Option A."
"Response: 
Haley found out that one of her colleagues stole her research without permission. This means they did something illegal or unethical. It also shows that the colleague didn't respect Haley's work or intellectual property rights. In such cases, people usually feel upset, angry, or violated. Therefore, option A (Haley felt like she had been betrayed) is more likely."
"Response: 
The story states that the party got ""extremely wild."" This suggests that there was excessive drinking, loud music, and general chaos at the party. It also says that all of the guests left in disgust. These are both classic signs of a wild party. 
Given this information, it seems unlikely that Sam would become a party planner after this incident. Party planning typically involves organizing events like weddings or corporate functions, which require careful attention to detail and a professional demeanor. Someone who throws a wild party might not be well-suited for this type of work. 
On the other hand, having a terrible hangover the next day is a common occurrence after attending a wild party. So option B is more plausible than option A."
"Response: 
Katie can't sleep, so she goes downstairs to get something to drink. That makes sense. Now, why would she heat the milk in the microwave if she wanted to pour it down the drain? It doesn't make any sense! Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage is one where Tom wants to make up for Becky's bad day at work by bringing home her favorite meal. However, due to traffic, he arrives home much later than expected. This could potentially cause frustration or disappointment for Becky if she has been waiting for him to arrive with the food. Therefore, option A is the most likely ending to the story, as it suggests that everything will be okay once they are reunited and share their meal together."
"Response:  The story states that they ""couldn't decide on a particular brand."" This implies that they were considering multiple brands, including the Viking and Thermador. It then says that they ""liked the durability of the Viking"" and ""also liked the deal with the Thermador."" This suggests that both options are still in play, as they have found positive qualities about each one. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - they will decide to buy the Viking stove."
"Response: 
The story states that Jasmine ""figured she could just wing it"" when studying for the test, indicating that she may have been careless or lacking in preparation. This suggests that option A (the teacher catches her and gives her detention) is more likely. Additionally, the fact that Jasmine decides to cheat by looking at her neighbor's paper implies that she is not confident in her own abilities and may be willing to take risks to get a good grade, which also supports option A."
"Response: 
The story states, ""After two months, Sam was sleeping in his car and broke."" This implies that Sam has been struggling financially for some time now. Additionally, the fact that he had to go to the Chinese Theatre to beg suggests that he has hit rock bottom. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer - Sam felt very depressed."
"Response: 
Ben woke up late, which means he didn't have time for breakfast. Then he went to work without eating anything. This means he must have been very hungry at work. Since it was a busy day at work, there wasn't enough time for him to take a break or eat lunch. Finally, after work, he got stuck in heavy traffic. All these factors suggest that Ben was extremely hungry throughout the day. Therefore, option A (Ben became sick because of his hunger) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states that Darren couldn't find his car keys, so he checked his pockets. If there were no keys in his pockets, then it means he didn't find them, which makes option B the correct answer. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is:

B: There were no keys in his pockets."
Response:  The story states that my girlfriend helped me pick out a new tie, which means she was present during the shopping trip. It also says we looked for hours, so it's unlikely that I would have found more than three ties that I liked. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - I bought all of them.
"Response:  The story states ""Harry loved hockey."" This means that Harry enjoys playing hockey. Therefore, it is unlikely that after trying out for the team, Harry would decide to quit (Option A). Instead, since Harry hopes to do well enough to make the team, it is more likely that he will be excited to hear whether or not he made the team (Option B)."
Response:  At first, Little Sue liked riding the elephant at the zoo. However, she became scared later on. This means that Option B (Sue continued to ride the elephant) is not the most likely answer because if she was still riding the elephant after getting scared, she would have probably fallen off or been taken off by the zookeeper before reaching her mother. Therefore, the most likely option is Option A: Sue's mom took her to pet the goat instead.
"Response: 
The story states Hannah won first prize, which means she must have done something impressive or outstanding. It also mentions that she has a natural talent for art, so it's possible that she put in extra effort to prepare for the competition. However, the story doesn't provide any evidence to suggest that her parents helped her cheat or undermine her achievement. In fact, option B suggests they are proud of her accomplishment. Therefore, based on the information provided, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Jim was taking out the garbage, which means he was walking with a full trash can. It would be very difficult for him to suddenly decide to do a handstand (option A). Moreover, if he fell down hard onto the pavement as stated in the passage, it is unlikely that he would not feel any pain or discomfort. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The author states that they ""hate"" doing laundry, which suggests that it is not something they enjoy or look forward to. They also mention that finding matching socks is a hassle, which implies that they are not very good at keeping track of them. Given these details, option A (I find doing laundry relaxing) seems unlikely, as it would be contradictory to their previous statements. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option B (I threw out all my old socks and bought all plain white socks)."
"Response: 
The story states that James ""never really thought about making food"" before, but after helping his mom with rice, he found it fun and creative. This suggests that James may have developed an interest in cooking. Therefore, option A - James decides to become a chef when he grows up - is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The situation: Lee knows that her mother needs new gloves but cannot afford them, so she decides to knit some herself to give as a gift on Christmas Day. This shows that Lee is caring and wants to make sure her mother has warm hands during the cold winter months.
Now let's consider each option separately:
Option A: ""Lee's mom was proud of her daughter for being so thoughtful.""
This ending suggests that Lee's mother appreciates the effort and thoughtfulness behind Lee's gift. It implies that their relationship is positive and loving, and that Lee's mother values her kindness and generosity. In this scenario, Lee would have made her mother happy with her present, which aligns with the overall theme of kindness and selflessness in the story.
On the other hand, Option B: ""Lee's mom threw the gloves at Lee and left the room"" does not fit well with the rest of the narrative. It seems unlikely that Lee's mother would react negatively or dismissively towards her gift, especially since it was made out of love and care. Moreover, the sudden change in tone and emotion might feel jarring and unrealistic within the context of the story. Therefore, I believe Option A is more likely to be the correct ending."
"Response: 
Option A: Jennifer thanked her boss for his fairness. This option suggests that Jennifer chose to approach the situation calmly and professionally, appreciating her boss's honesty rather than becoming defensive or aggressive. It's possible that this response could lead to a productive conversation where both parties can address their concerns and find a resolution. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Why would Lorraine be thrilled if she got injured and couldn't play anymore? It doesn't make sense. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Lorraine will be sad because she won't be able to play anymore.
"Response: 
Tammy made seven more bracelets, so she had a total of fourteen bracelets. Since they wanted to give them away as gifts, it's unlikely that Tammy would decide not to speak to Abby again just because Abby only made five bracelets. Therefore, option A is incorrect.
Now let's consider option B: ""They decided to keep the bracelets for themselves."" This outcome seems unlikely since the girls wanted to give their friendship bracelets away as gifts to others. It makes sense that they would want to share their creation with others rather than keeping them all for themselves. So, option B is also incorrect."
Response:  If it got really cold, then it would make sense that we needed to shovel the snow. However, if the power came back on after only an hour, then it seems unlikely that we had to shovel any snow. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Why would Sal throw his pillow out the window? It doesn't make sense for him to do so just because he's upset about moving to a higher floor. Perhaps there's something else going on in the story that we haven't been told yet. On the other hand, if we consider the context of the story, it makes more sense for Sal to be initially resistant to the idea of living on the eighth floor but then change his mind after taking in the view from his bedroom window. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
From the context, we know that Lydia had a strange dream where she forgot to wear her pants while taking a test at school. This situation is quite embarrassing for anyone, especially in a school setting. Therefore, option B is more likely: ""Lydia felt relieved when she realized it was just a dream."" Why would Lydia wish this dream were real if it made her feel uncomfortable and embarrassed? It makes sense that she would be glad it wasn't true."
Response:  We know that Alex needs groceries, so she makes a list of items to purchase. This means she will be going shopping at a store. Since she has reusable canvas bags with her, it suggests that she intends to carry her purchases home herself rather than having them delivered or using plastic bags. Therefore, option B (She bought the groceries) is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
Katie forced Yolanda to go on a rollercoaster against her will, which means that Yolanda did not want to do it in the first place. This could be because of fear or any other reason. Now, if Katie was happy after this incident, then it would mean that she enjoyed seeing Yolanda uncomfortable or unhappy, which is not a very nice thing to do. Therefore, option A is unlikely. 
On the other hand, if Katie regretted forcing Yolanda to go on the ride, then it means that she realized that what she did was wrong and hurtful towards Yolanda. This is more plausible since it shows empathy and understanding for someone else's feelings. So, option B is more likely."
"Response:  We know from the text that Tina wanted to try a hot dog at a famous stand in New York City, and she finally found one run by Nathan's. This suggests that she has been looking forward to this experience for some time. Then we are told that the food ""tasted amazing."" This implies that Tina enjoyed her meal very much. Therefore, the most likely answer is (B) She was happy with the hot dog."
"Response:  The story states, ""Christmas was a few weeks away."" This implies that there isn't much time left before Christmas. Then we are told, ""She (Tammy) didn't really have money."" This means that Tammy doesn't have enough funds to buy a gift for someone else. Finally, we learn that Tammy decides to use some of her extra yarn to make a blanket as a gift instead. Given these details, option B is more likely because it shows that Lorelei appreciated the thoughtfulness behind the gift rather than simply being pleased with its monetary value."
"Response:  The story states, ""Melinda wanted to go see a scary movie."" This implies that Melinda finds scary movies frightening or unsettling. Then it says, ""She wanted to go by herself to prove she was brave."" This suggests that Melinda wants to show others (or maybe even herself) that she can handle something challenging like a scary movie alone. However, when we get to the part where the story says, ""Melinda was very afraid while watching the movie,"" this contradicts the idea that Melinda wanted to prove her bravery. So, option B is the most likely answer - Melinda wished that she had brought someone."
Response:  Why did Lamar decide to make tea for his guests? Because he didn't have any food at home to offer them! So, it's unlikely that he would give them tea to take home (Option A). Instead, since they are his guests, he might want to serve them something on the spot or provide them with something else that they can eat or drink while they are there. Therefore, Option B is more likely: Lamar walked to the park.
"Response:  The story states that my niece ""got the job"" at the RMV (Registry of Motor Vehicles) two years ago. This means she already had the job before she applied for it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer because they decided it was okay to let her work as a secretary despite not having a driver's license."
Response:  The story states that Lela was diagnosed with cancer, which means she had cancer for some time before finishing or getting over it. Option A says that after going through all of those struggles, Lela finally finished treatment and felt better. This seems unlikely because if she just finished treatment, how could she already be feeling better? It would take more than a few months for someone in this situation to fully recover from cancer. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  We know that Fred was a new student, so it makes sense that he might have trouble making friends. It also says nobody wanted to be friends with him, which means they were not very welcoming or friendly towards him. So option A (Fred was popular) does not make much sense here as there is no indication that this is true. Now let's look at option B: ""Fred talked with his lunch mate and made friends."" This seems like a more plausible outcome given the context of the story. After all, sometimes people just need someone to talk to and show them some kindness before they start feeling more comfortable around others. So based on the information provided, option B seems like the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
The story tells us that Joyce was adopted at age 5, which means she had no biological siblings or parents of her own. This means that all of the children in her care are either adoptive or foster children. 
As for option A, it is unlikely that Joyce would abandon her children soon after becoming their guardian. While it is possible that she may have faced challenges in caring for them, it is unlikely that she would simply walk away from her responsibilities without any explanation. 
On the other hand, option B is more plausible given the information provided in the story. It is common for people who have been raised in foster care themselves to become foster parents later in life, as they understand the needs of vulnerable children and want to provide a loving home for those who need one. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Joyce continued to be a nurturing and supportive figure in the lives of her children, even after she moved out on her own."
Response:  The story states that Horatio was initially afraid of eating a raw oyster, but after trying one, he loved it. This means that he will be motivated to continue eating them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Horatio ate ten more oysters.
Response:  Tom likes to herd cattle, so he must be good at it. If a cow went free, he would probably search for it because he wants to bring it back to its owner. Therefore, the most likely option is (B) He found the cow and brought it back.
Response:  First of all, when someone gets a hot liquid like coffee on their lap while driving, it can be very uncomfortable and even dangerous if they don't act fast enough. It could cause distraction or discomfort that might lead to an accident. Therefore, option B (She almost had an accident as she screamed out in pain) seems more plausible than option A (She laughed as she continued to drive to work).
Response:  The story says that John was driving his new Camaro, which means he probably paid money for it. If he pulls over to buy another car, then he would be spending more money on something else. Therefore, option B is less likely. Now let's consider option A. The story doesn't provide any information about how fast John or the other driver were going, but it does say they raced. This implies that both drivers were traveling at high speeds. However, since John had just bought a brand-new Camaro, it might not have been in the best condition or equipped with the latest safety features. In addition, racing against an unknown opponent without proper precautions could put John at risk of injury or worse. So while option A seems exciting, it may not be the safest choice. Ultimately, based on the available evidence, option B seems more plausible - John is unlikely to pull over and buy another car when he already has a shiny new Camaro.
"Response: 
The story states that Ben made his costume from scratch and applied a lot of stage makeup. This suggests that he put in a lot of effort into creating an impressive costume. Additionally, the fact that everyone at work was impressed with how he looked implies that he must have done something right. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - Ben was indeed pleased with how he looked in his costume."
"Response: 
If you chose option A, then you would have given your mom permission to continue using your credit card without checking with you first. This could lead to more financial problems in the future since you may not be aware of how much she's spending or what she's buying. It also shows a lack of responsibility on your part as a borrower to monitor how your money is being used. Therefore, option A is not the best choice.
On the other hand, if you chose option B, it means you are upset with your mom for using your credit card without your permission. While it's understandable to feel frustrated, yelling at her or blaming her won't solve anything. Instead, it's important to communicate with her calmly and explain why you're uncomfortable with her using your credit card without your consent. You could also offer alternative solutions such as helping her find another way to pay for things or setting boundaries around how much she can spend. So, option B is the better choice here."
"Response:  The story states ""She had no clue what to do."" This implies that Kelly was not sure how to solve her problem of having dry hair. Then, it says ""Finally she went to the doctor."" This suggests that Kelly sought medical advice from a professional. Therefore, option A is more likely because it states that Kelly finally found a solution to her problem after seeking help from a doctor. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of Kelly liking or eating potato chips."
"Response: 
The story states that Sarah has a fear of being around others. This could be considered an example of social anxiety disorder (SAD). In order for option A to be true, the therapist would need to teach Sarah coping mechanisms for SAD. On the other hand, if the therapist simply tells Sarah she is strange, it does not address or help Sarah's specific issue. Therefore, option B is less likely."
"Response:  The story states that Ellen ""held her breath"" before the doctor scanned her belly, which suggests that she was nervous or excited about finding out the gender of her baby. It also says that she was ""really hoping"" for a boy, which further indicates that she has a preference. Given these details, option B (Her doctor confirmed it was a boy!) is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states, ""A new show was made that had a main character named Zoey."" This means that Zoey's name has become popular among other people, especially young teenagers who are more likely to follow trends and media. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - Zoey was happy that everyone liked her name now."
"Response: 
Miranda just got her driver's license, so this means that she has never driven before. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would be able to drive for a long time without realizing she was lost. It makes more sense that she would get lost quickly as a new driver. So, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states, ""Bob went to the doctor."" This implies that something has already happened or is happening to Bob. For example, if Bob went to the doctor because he felt sick, then it means that he was already feeling unwell before he saw the doctor. Therefore, option A (Bob gained 50 pounds) is unlikely since we are given no indication that this occurred before Bob visited the doctor. 
On the other hand, option B (Bob got in shape) makes more sense based on the information provided in the story. Joining a gym and watching what you eat are common steps people take when they want to lose weight and improve their overall health. So, it seems more plausible that Bob made progress towards getting in shape after visiting the doctor."
"Response: 
The story states, ""He (Lonnie) knew that his end goal was to be a teacher."" This means that option A is more likely because it aligns with Lonnie's stated goal. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Sherry likes to explore the outdoors and decides to go for a hike in a state park on a sunny day. This suggests that she enjoys nature and being outside. The next sentence mentions that while walking along a creek, she sees something shiny. This could be anything from a rock or stone to a piece of metal or even a weapon like a knife. However, since it's a sunny day and she's hiking in a state park, it's more likely that what she found is not dangerous but rather something harmless like a coin or a small trinket. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - it was a quarter."
Response:  The story states that it was a warm, breezy day. This implies that Phil might have been feeling relaxed or comfortable. Also, he ran into some friends while walking, which suggests that they were probably having fun together. Given these details, option A (Phil was thirsty and accepted the drink) seems more plausible than option B (Phil was angry with his friends). Therefore, I would choose option A as the correct answer.
Response:  The first sentence states that Dorothy's cat was pregnant, which means there will be kittens. Then, we are told that she didn't know how it happened, implying that this wasn't planned. Finally, we learn that she convinced her family to keep the kittens. Given these details, option A (Dorothy made sure to buy lots of cat food) seems like the more logical choice since they now have multiple cats to care for. Option B doesn't make much sense in light of the previous information.
"Response: 
The story states that Jeremy moved out when he was 21 years old. This means he has been living on his own for at least five years (assuming he is now 26). If he has been able to ""clean up"" his life and become more financially stable during this time, it is unlikely that his mother would suddenly demand that he moves back home. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The story states ""Terry realizes his neighborhood has become covered in litter."" This implies that Terry notices a problem, which means he must have been paying attention to his surroundings. Therefore, option A is unlikely because if Terry hated cleaning up, he wouldn't have noticed the problem in the first place. So, the correct answer is (B) Everyone felt better that it was cleaner."
Response:  The narrator says they wanted to take a shower, then they got their clothes and towel from the closet. This implies that they were already in the bathroom before this point. Therefore, option B (Then I stepped into the hot shower) is the most likely answer.
"Response:  The story states ""Since my brother was at work,"" which means he wasn't available to pick me up earlier. This implies that it was his fault that I had to wait for him longer than expected. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Barry loves to lift weights, so if he forgets his barbell, it would be unlikely that he will just take a nap in his hammock without any exercise at all. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  We know that Amber has been stressed at work, so it makes sense that she would want a day off to relax. Additionally, we are told that she hangs out with her boyfriend Rob on this day off, which suggests that they spend time together doing things that help them both unwind. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Amber feels much better after spending time with Rob.
"Response:  The story states, ""He signed a short contract."" This implies that Carl only committed to serving in the military for a limited time. It also says, ""His best friend was killed in front of him."" This suggests that Carl witnessed something traumatic and disturbing. Given these details, it seems more likely that Carl would experience psychological distress as a result (option B). Option A does not take into account the severity of what happened to Carl, and it doesn't make sense given the context provided. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states, ""Eddie liked to watch people use metal detectors on the beach."" This implies that Eddie enjoys seeing others find things with their metal detectors. Therefore, it is more likely that Option B is correct - the man will happily get a ping from his detector."
Response:  When you first meet someone who doesn't know how to crack a walnut, it's unlikely they will suddenly decide not to learn how to do so. It's more likely that they will be eager to learn. Therefore, option B (Janice is now an expert walnut cracker) is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states that Amy said ""I am the worst player"" which implies that she feels bad about herself. Then, Kim tells her that she will get better with time. This suggests that Amy has room for improvement. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
The story states that Beth heard a loud knock on the door while she was in the shower. This means that she could hear something outside her bathroom door even though she was underwater. It's unlikely that she would be able to hear anything if she were deaf. Therefore, option A is not the most likely choice. 
Now let's consider option B: Beth was deaf. If this were true, then why did she hear the knock on the door at all? It doesn't make sense for her to suddenly become able to hear after she gets out of the shower only to find that no one is there. So option B is also not the most likely choice. 
Therefore, based on the information provided in the story, the most likely ending is option A: Beth decided she was hearing things."
Response:  If Joe hated pizza, it would be unlikely that he would get hired at a pizza place. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states that Bob ""picked up his glasses from the table"" and then ""slipped them in his backpack to wear at school."" This implies that Bob needs his glasses to see things clearly, which suggests that option B (Bob was able to read the writing on the board) is more likely. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
Response:  The girl broke her foot when he stepped on it while dancing. This means that she will not be able to attend any more dances or events for a period of time (let's say several weeks). This would mean that they cannot hang out in person anymore during this time frame. Therefore option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Our friend went out looking for love but ended up getting drunk. This means that they were not in control of their actions. Then, they started flirting with another man. This suggests that our friend may have been experimenting or exploring their sexuality. However, since we lost track of them after a while, it's possible that they could have ended up anywhere. Therefore, option A (our friend ended up home at three am with a girl) is less likely than option B (we found out our friend had gone skiing). Option B provides more plausible explanations for what happened to our friend after they got drunk and lost track of."
Response:  The story says Benjamin first hung upside down on the monkey bars, which suggests he was having fun. Then it says his mom pushed him on the swing, which means he continued to have fun. Finally, the story says he went really high on the swing, which implies he enjoyed himself even more. Based on this information, option B (Benjamin had fun and then left the park) is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Megan and you walked home from school ""near a busy street."" This implies that there are many cars passing by. Then it says you saw three blue cars pass by in a row. This means that you were able to see multiple cars at once because they passed by in a row. Finally, it says you decided to count the blue cars. So far so good! However, after this sentence, the story ends abruptly without any explanation of how or why you counted the cars. It simply states that you and Megan sat on the curb all afternoon. This makes me believe option A is more likely since there is no logical reason for you two to sit on the curb if you already finished counting the cars. Option B seems unnecessary as well since there isn't anything else mentioned about counting the cars other than the initial decision to do so. Therefore, my answer would be option A."
"Response: 
Option A states that Kelly has a neurological disorder, which means she may experience difficulty with movement or coordination. This could be due to various causes such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, or stroke. However, it is important to note that this information does not necessarily determine how the story will unfold. It simply provides additional context for the situation.
Option B suggests that Kelly was able to clean up in time before her parents returned home, indicating that she successfully hid any evidence of the party from them. While this outcome is possible, it also relies on the assumption that Kelly had sufficient time to tidy up after the guests left without being detected. Without further details, it is difficult to say which ending is more likely."
Response:  The story states that James realized he hadn't left his house all day, then he went for a run in the park. This means he did leave his house after all! So, the most likely option is (B) James is glad he decided to run.
"Response: 
The story states that Lars has already worked long all afternoon clearing the snow from his deck. This means that he must have finished his task before going inside for a shower. Therefore, option (B) ""When he gets out of the shower he shovels his deck"" is not possible since he would have already finished this task earlier in the day. So, the correct answer is Option (A): ""He feels satisfaction."""
Response:  Why would Matt begin to laugh if he discovered that his wife was cheating on him? It doesn't make sense. Instead, it's more logical for Matt to be angry or upset upon discovering this information. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story starts off with Mike playing racketball with Perry, which suggests they are friends or acquaintances who regularly engage in this activity together. However, things take an unfortunate turn when Mike hits Perry in the back of the head by accident. This could be seen as a careless mistake rather than an intentional act of aggression. As a result, Perry becomes unhappy with Mike. Now, here are our two possible endings: Option A: Mike has to apologize. Given the context of the situation, it makes sense that Mike might need to make amends for hitting Perry without intending to do so. Perhaps he will offer a sincere apology, explain what happened from his perspective, and express regret for any inconvenience caused to Perry. Depending on how seriously Perry takes the incident, he may accept the apology or still choose to distance himself from Mike temporarily. Option B: Mike and Perry get married. While it's certainly possible that these characters have developed strong feelings for each other over their shared love of racketball, this outcome seems highly unlikely given the circumstances described in the story. Hitting someone in the head with a ball can be painful and potentially dangerous; it doesn't necessarily create a deep emotional bond between people. Therefore, we should rule out option B as the more plausible conclusion to the narrative. So, based on the information provided, the correct answer is (A) Mike has to apologize."
Response:  Sydney needs to do the laundry, so option A (She decided to go to the movies) is unlikely because it doesn't make sense for her to stop doing the laundry halfway through. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option B (She continued to do this until the laundry was done).
Response:  The story says that they evacuated before the hurricane hit, so option A (their house being destroyed) is unlikely. Option B (going swimming on the beach) doesn't make sense given the context of the story either, as they are waiting out the storm in another location. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is option A: They found their house standing, but in shambles.
Response:  We know that Tom bit into something hard (a pebble) while eating a Snickers bar. This caused his tooth to break in half. Now, we are told that he went to see a dentist because this was an emergency situation. So, option A is the more likely outcome - the dentist will fix his tooth.
"Response: 
Rufus woke up and noticed his hat was gone, so he can't have been wearing it to the bar last night. Therefore option (B) is the correct answer."
"Response:  The story states that Alexia has been wanting a new dog ""for ages."" This implies that she has been thinking about getting a new dog for some time, so it is unlikely that she will suddenly change her mind and want a cat instead. Additionally, the fact that her parents agree to take her to the kennel suggests that they are supportive of her desire for a new dog. Therefore, option A (Alexia falls in love with a shaggy dog at the kennel) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Dan wanted to find the perfect gift for his mother's birthday, but after shopping at the mall for hours, he was unable to find anything. This suggests that Dan put some effort into finding a good gift, which means he cares about pleasing his mother. Therefore, option A (Dan explained the situation and his mother was not upset) is more likely. "
"Response: 
If Bill got a degree in computer science, it means that he spent years studying and learning new skills. This would have cost him time and money. It also means that he now has a valuable skill set that can be used to earn more money. However, it may not necessarily mean that he will make more money right away or even at all. In fact, many people with advanced degrees end up working for low wages because there are too many of them competing for few jobs. So option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  The story states that Jane loves her new high heels, but after wearing them for a short time, she experiences foot pain. This suggests that Jane may not be comfortable or accustomed to wearing high heels, which could indicate that Option A (Jane danced in her bare feet) is more likely. However, without additional information about Jane's preferences or habits, it's also possible that she simply forgot to bring her shoes with her to the club. Therefore, I would rate this question as difficult because there are multiple plausible explanations for why Jane might have left her shoes behind.
"Response: 
Jose has planned for months, saved money, and purchased all the necessary documents for his trip back home. This shows that he is determined to make this trip happen. Moreover, he has not experienced any major problems during his stay in the US, which suggests that he feels safe and comfortable here. Therefore, option A (Jose takes the trip to Mexico) seems more likely."
Response:  The story states that Hannah started out feeling stiff and inflexible. Then, she decides to take a yoga class to improve her flexibility. However, she struggles with yoga and does not see any improvement after several months of practice. This suggests that option A (Hannah becomes stiffer over time) is more likely because despite her efforts, she has not seen any progress. Therefore, it is unlikely that she will suddenly succeed in improving her flexibility without any further effort or change in approach.
"Response: 
When the teacher said ""pop quiz,"" the students made a collective sound of displeasure. This suggests that they did not enjoy taking quizzes or found them difficult. When the fire alarm went off, the students were forced to leave their classroom and gather outside. It is unlikely that they would cheer at this point since being evacuated from their classroom can be an inconvenience for them. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - the kids were mad they had to be outside."
"Response:  The story states ""Ann brought home a D on a test."" This indicates that Ann has been spending too much time on extracurricular activities and not enough time studying. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Why would Gina be happy about the situation? There is no indication that she wanted to eat any of the food left over from the previous night or morning. In fact, it seems like she missed out on a meal altogether since everyone else had already eaten. Therefore, option B (Gina was sad and cried) is more likely.
Response:  James wants a hunting bow, but he forgets to get arrows. So, what does he do next? Option A says he goes to the sporting goods store to buy bullets. But why would he want bullets when he already has a bow? It doesn't make sense. On the other hand, option B suggests that he carves some sticks to use as makeshift arrows. This seems like a more plausible solution since it fits with his situation. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Carving some sticks to use as makeshift arrows.
Response:  The story states that Taylor has always wanted a pet, so it's unlikely she would decide not to get one (option B). Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
First, we know that Zeke wanted a scary costume. So option B (dressed up like a skeleton) is more likely because it fits with what Zeke wants. 
Now let's consider the context of the story. The story mentions that all of Zeke's friends are dressing up for Halloween. This means there will be other people in costumes around Zeke, which makes him less likely to choose an obvious costume like a pumpkin (option A). Instead, he might want something more unique and spooky, like a skeleton. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
The story states that Janet landed a role in a big film, which means she got an acting job. This is good news for her. Then it says the movie was supposed to premiere last week, but it was delayed. This could mean one of two things: either Janet is happy about the delay (which would make option A the correct answer) or she is upset about the delay (which would make option B the correct answer). Since we don't know how Janet feels about the delay, we can't say for sure which ending is more likely. Therefore, the best answer is ""neither."""
Response:  The situation described in the passage is as follows: Marge wants a backyard pool, but her husband Bill doesn't want it. However, after some convincing, he agrees to install one. Now, at a pool party, Marge sees her curvy neighbor wearing a bikini and chatting with Bill. This could lead to several possible endings, including: Option A: Marge puts a new key on her keychain. In this scenario, Marge may be feeling anxious or uneasy about what she just witnessed and decides to distract herself by acquiring something new, like a new keychain. Alternatively, she might be trying to avoid thinking about the encounter altogether by focusing on something else. Option B: Marge feels a pang of regret about putting in the pool right then. In this case, Marge may be second-guessing her decision to install the pool after seeing her husband interacting with someone else in a revealing swimsuit. She may feel regretful that she didn't consider the potential consequences of installing the pool beforehand or worry that it has created tension in their marriage. Based on the information provided in the passage, option B seems more likely than option A. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).
Response:  The story states that Rosie was feeling naughty because Farmer Jones hadn't brought her breakfast yet. This implies that Rosie has a history of sneaking away from her enclosure when she doesn't get what she wants. Therefore, option B (Rosie broke free to head to the orchard) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Why would Rick throw the license out of the window? It doesn't make sense for him to do that because he wants to find the owner of the license. If he throws it away, then he won't be able to return it to its rightful owner. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer. Now let's consider option B. Rick decides to give the license to the driver because he wants to help the person who lost their identification. Giving the license to the driver makes the driver happy, which aligns with Rick's goal of helping someone in need. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
Response:  The person started a diet, which means they wanted to eat healthier. They had one piece of unhealthy food (pizza) that triggered their desire for more junk food. This shows that they still have some weaknesses or cravings despite starting a new diet. Therefore, option A is the correct answer - the person probably felt ashamed about giving up on their diet so quickly.
"Response:  The story states that Sam is ""really looking forward"" to spending time with his wife, which suggests he wants to be around her. Additionally, they finish packing and smile at each other, indicating they are both happy about the upcoming trip. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Sam and his wife had a great time together."
"Response: 
The story states that Eric's mom said that Eric cannot come out and play, which implies that Eric is grounded or restricted in some way. It also says that Stan begged and pleaded, but to no avail, which suggests that Eric's mother is firm in her decision.
Given these details, it is unlikely that Eric will sneak out of his house to join Stan for an adventure. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: ""Greg told his neighbor it was him."" This option suggests that Greg took responsibility for throwing the stone and admitted to breaking the window. However, this seems unlikely given the context of the story. If Greg had thrown the stone, he would have been afraid of getting in trouble, so why would he willingly admit to doing something wrong? Additionally, if Greg were to tell his neighbor that it was him who broke the window, he might face consequences from both his neighbor and his parents. Therefore, Option A is not the most likely choice.

Option B: ""Greg blamed the broken window on another boy."" This option implies that Greg tried to shift the blame onto someone else instead of taking responsibility for his actions. While this may seem like an easy way out, it's important to remember that honesty and integrity are essential values in any society. By choosing to blame someone else, Greg would be demonstrating a lack of accountability and moral character. Moreover, if his neighbor discovers the truth, Greg's reputation could suffer significantly. So, while Option B may seem appealing at first glance, it's not the best choice in this situation."
Response:  The story says that Brad went to the beach, built a sand castle, and jumped into the ocean water. This suggests he had fun at the beach. Then it says he swam with small fish in the ocean. This means he enjoyed his time in the water too! So, option B is more likely - Brad then went home after having a nice day.
Response:  The puppy went outside to play, then he got dirty with mud. Then, he came back inside the house. Finally, we sent him to the bathroom (not us). So, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Since Jerry fell off his bike, he must have been injured. It would be difficult for someone who can't walk or stand up without pain to wait for their next bike trip. Therefore, option B is more likely.
Response:  If you had never seen this person in person before, how would you know that they are who they say they are? You wouldn't! So option A is more likely.
"Response:  The person who was managing your social media accounts wasn't doing much work, so you might consider firing them. However, it could also be that they were just getting started and needed some time to learn how things worked around there. Giving them a raise wouldn't make sense if they weren't producing any results yet! Therefore option (A) makes more sense here since giving someone else another chance after seeing little progress from this particular individual doesn't seem like an ideal choice at present moment in time when looking towards future outcomes where hopefully things will improve with better performance from those involved within organization's ranks ‚Äì especially those responsible for driving traffic towards websites through various online platforms such as social medias etcetera."""
Response:  We know that Sam's parents are away for the weekend, so he decides to throw a party. This means that there will be many guests at his home, which could lead to chaos and destruction of property (trashing the house). Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Sam is in real trouble because of the damage caused by his friends during the party.
Response:  The student in this story has just started their first day of school, which means they are probably feeling nervous or excited about meeting new people and learning new things. They mention that they got to wear a new outfit, which suggests that they are looking forward to making a good impression. Additionally, they say that their favorite class is music, which implies that they enjoy creative activities. Based on these clues, it seems more likely that the student had a positive experience at school and would choose option A.
Response:  Sam bought a new television, but it wouldn't turn on when he pressed the on button several times. This means that there might be something wrong with the TV itself or maybe the power source isn't working properly. So, option B is more likely as it suggests that Jeb plugged the television in which could potentially fix the issue if the problem lies with the power source. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Matilda picked a name at random, wrote a letter to that person, and received a response. This means that the recipient of the letter was willing to engage in a correspondence with someone they didn't know before. It's unlikely that Matilda's brother would be interested in corresponding with someone randomly selected from a phone book, especially since it's clear that Matilda found this activity entertaining. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
In this situation, Bill notices a pretty girl at the bar and goes up to her to flirt. However, he is too drunk to talk properly and ends up failing to impress her. This suggests that option B is more likely, as it aligns with our expectations of how someone might react in this situation. Specifically, Bill and Teddy might complain or make fun of the woman for not being interested in them due to their drunkenness. Therefore, we can conclude that option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The author states that ""during the performance, lights went out."" This suggests that there were no lights at all during the performance. Therefore, option B is more likely: ""We could not see our sheet music."""
"Response:  The story states ""Janie wanted to see a comedy"" and ""Lynne wanted to see a thriller."" This means that their preferences are different. Then it says ""When they got to the movie theater, they decided to make a compromise."" This implies that they found something that they could agree on. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - Both ended up being happy with the choice they made."
"Response: 
Olivia wanted to go shopping, so she went to the mall. This means that she enjoyed herself at the mall. Since she found a great sale on shoes, it's likely that she was happy with her purchases. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  The speaker says they are ""very excited"" about moving, which suggests that they are generally positive about it. However, they also mention that their old house is too small for their family, which could be seen as a negative aspect of the situation. Therefore, option A (I hate the thought of moving) is not the most likely choice. Option B (I only hope I get to choose my own bedroom) is more plausible because it shows some excitement or anticipation towards the new house, while still expressing a specific desire related to the move."
Response:  At 8:07 am, Shawn woke up and got out of bed. This means that it has been several hours since he last had a cigarette (since he didn't have one in his hand when he went to sleep). So option B is more likely - Shawn will smoke another pack of cigarettes soon after buying them.
"Response:  The story says that Nickie ""loved"" her doll, which means she was attached to it emotionally. When she lost the doll, she would naturally feel sad or upset. Therefore, option A (Nickie never finding the doll) is more likely."
Response:  The story states that Anna's friends are not sure about her weight loss method, which means they don't know how or why she lost the weight. Therefore, option B is more likely because it suggests that Anna's friends found her methods surprisingly simple. Option A implies that her friends believe her methods are ineffective, but there is no evidence in the story to support this conclusion.
"Response: 
Bob wanted a hamburger, but he also wants to eat healthier. That means he doesn't want a traditional beef burger. Option A says he goes back to McDonald's for a regular burger, which contradicts his goal of eating healthier. Therefore, option B is more likely. Bob is excited about making a veggie burger because he wants to try something new and healthy."
Response:  We know that Tommy got hurt and needed medical attention. The fact that there were many people in the waiting room suggests that it might be difficult for Tommy and his mom to get seen right away. So option A (Tommy was badly injured) seems more plausible than option B (Tommy was treated and felt much better). Therefore, we should choose Option A as the correct answer.
Response:  We know that Maggie wants to paint her room pink, so option B is more likely. Therefore, we choose option B.
"Response: 
Ken met a nice man online, and they decided to go on a date. This means that they have never met in person before. So, it would be strange if Ken just left without any explanation. It's more likely that Ken will want to get to know the other person better and decide whether or not there is mutual interest. Therefore, option B (Ken asked him for a second date) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A states that Gary was ""mad that he didn't fall down two flights of stairs."" This doesn't make sense because falling down one flight of stairs is already quite unfortunate; why would he be upset if he only fell down one flight instead of two? It seems unlikely that this is how Gary would react.
On the other hand, Option B suggests that Jamie comes to the rescue and helps Gary. This makes more sense given the context of the situation. If Gary is nervous around Jamie and tries to show off in front of her, it's possible that he might accidentally trip or fall. In this case, having someone like Jamie nearby to help him could be beneficial for both Gary and Jamie. Therefore, based on the information provided, Option B seems the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Liz ""purchased seedlings"" which means she already had some experience with growing plants, as she knew how to buy them. Then it says she ""looked after them like they were children!"" This implies that she took great care of them, but also maybe not enough attention to their specific needs. Finally, there is no indication in the text that she felt shame about her actions. Therefore, option B - eventually they grew delicious tomatoes - is the most likely outcome."
Response:  We know that Bill wanted a sandwich, so he went into his kitchen to get the ingredients. This means he had already decided to make himself a sandwich. Therefore, option A (He ate his sandwich) is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states ""He looked everywhere."" This implies that Jack searched thoroughly, but didn't find the pencil. Therefore, option B is more likely - Jack finally found it under the bed."
"Response:  The speaker in the story bought an ""extremely advanced"" phone, which suggests that it has impressive features or capabilities beyond what other phones have. Then, they call their friends to show off their new purchase. This implies that they are proud of their phone and want to share its capabilities with others. Therefore, option A (They were impressed with my phone) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  The story states that John was cooking dinner last night. This means that it was an evening event. Then, we are told that John dropped a pan and burned himself. This implies that something unfortunate happened during his evening. Therefore, option B (John had a miserable evening) is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Jenny found someone stole her lunch twice, so she asked around and found out who did it. This means that there are only two possibilities: either the person confessed or they denied it. Since the story says ""they denied it,"" option B is more likely. "
"Response: 
The story states that another person saw the painting at Emma's friend's house. This means that someone outside of Emma's inner circle noticed her artwork. It's possible that this person appreciated it enough to want more from Emma. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Emma was happy to have a new audience for her work."
Response:  The story states that Tom's family got him tickets to a classic car museum for his birthday. This implies that they wanted to give him something he would enjoy. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it shows Tom having a good time at the museum. Option B goes against this idea, as it suggests Tom expressing discontent towards his parents, which doesn't fit with the context provided.
Response:  The story states that Johnny took a trip down the stairs, which means he fell or tripped while going down the stairs. This implies that Johnny got hurt. As a result of getting hurt, Johnny has a bruised knee. This further suggests that Johnny may have been injured seriously enough to warrant medical attention. However, the story does not mention any serious injuries or hospital visits. Instead, it simply states that Johnny's mom comforted him after he got hurt. Given this information, option B seems like the most likely outcome - Johnny will be more careful on the stairs from now on. Option A, where Johnny cries for an hour, seems unlikely given the nature of the situation.
"Response: 
The story states that Mike wants to have a healthier breakfast, which means he wants to make a change from his usual fast food habit. This implies that he has been consuming unhealthy food regularly, which could lead to negative consequences such as weight gain or poor digestion. Therefore, option B (Mike was ashamed of what he had done) is more likely."
"Response:  The story states, ""I tried connecting the borders with nails."" This implies that the speaker is working with their hands, using tools like hammers and nails. Then, it says, ""I ended up hitting my finger with the hammer."" This means that the speaker accidentally hit themselves with the tool they were using. Finally, the story ends with, ""I went to the hospital to fix my finger that I had broken."" Based on these details, option B is the most likely outcome for the speaker. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
"Response: 
The story states that Josh likes watching anime TV shows. This means that he enjoys it when other people are around to share in the experience. Therefore, option B is more likely: ""Josh enjoys watching anime with others."""
"Response:  The story states ""John loves to eat at buffets"" which means he enjoys them, so option B is more likely.  Therefore, the correct answer is (B) John was sad to hear the news."
"Response: 
The story states that Jimbo has worked at this company for years, so he must be comfortable there. 
He also takes his smoke break at the same time every day, which means it's probably a routine for him. 
Now, the new boss doesn't allow smoke breaks, but why would Jimbo care? If he's been doing something for years without any issues, why change now? It's unlikely he will stop smoking just because the new boss doesn't allow it. So option A is more likely. "
"Response: 
Lester was infatuated with Christina. This means he had strong feelings for her. However, he didn't know if those feelings were mutual until she told him that she loved him and wanted children with him. Now, it's possible that Lester could have been so overjoyed at this revelation that he immediately proposed marriage (Option A). But let's consider another possibility... 
What if Lester was taken aback by Christina's sudden declaration of love? What if he wasn't ready or willing to commit to marriage just yet? In that case, he might decide not to talk to her again (Option B). So while Option A seems like the more romantic choice, we can't rule out the possibility that Lester might choose Option B given the context of the story."
Response:  The author says they turned off their computer, TV, and opened the newspaper to the Leisure section. This means that they are actively trying to focus on completing the crossword without any distractions. Option B states that the author finished the entire crossword puzzle in one hour, which suggests that they were able to complete it quickly despite turning off their computer and TV. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
The statement ""This hat is going to be amazing!"" suggests that the speaker has high expectations for the hat. However, if the hat actually makes them look like a potato (option A), then it is unlikely that they will have such high expectations. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Julia baked a cake. That means she did some work on it already. Now, when it has cooled, she wants to frost it. This means that she will add more ingredients and effort to make it look better. So option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states that the dog ""snores like a human."" This implies that it makes noise while sleeping, which could be an indication of poor breathing or respiratory issues. Therefore, option B is more likely - Whit may not sleep well due to his dog's unusual snoring behavior."
"Response:  Since this is a fictional scenario, we can assume that Amy doesn't have any other commitments or responsibilities at the time of her return from volleyball practice. Therefore, option A - ""Amy left for volleyball practice"" - is unlikely because there would be nothing stopping her from taking a shower after returning home. So, the correct answer is (B) Amy gave in and took a shower."
"Response:  The story says that it was ""Pinwheels for Peace Day"" today, which means that this event happened on a specific day. Then, the narrator mentions that their teacher took them toward the front of the school, where everyone planted pinwheels near the stop. This implies that the event occurred outside, possibly in a public space like a park or plaza. Finally, the story states that when they looked at the pinwheels from far away, they were spinning. This suggests that the pinwheels were still intact after the event ended. Given these details, option B (the teacher took a photo of the pinwheels) seems more likely than option A (the teacher told them to remove the pinwheels). Why? Because taking a photo would be a way to document and remember the event, whereas removing the pinwheels would not serve any practical purpose unless there was another reason not mentioned in the story."
"Response: 
The story states that Beth's water broke, which means she went into labor. This is usually a sign that the baby will be born within a few hours or days. It's unlikely that Beth would be in labor for 2 days without any progress, especially since it's her first pregnancy. Therefore, Option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Mia initially thought she wouldn't like falafel but changed her mind after tasting it. This means that she enjoyed it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Mia liked it so much she decided to learn how to make it."
Response:  The author started teaching at their child's kindergarten class, then took courses on special education. They were interested in understanding why some children struggle with learning. Based on this information, it seems unlikely that they would decide not to teach (option B). Instead, it makes more sense that they continued teaching and pursued further training or certification in special education (option A). Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome for the story.
"Response: 
Gary always brings his lunch to work, so it's unlikely that he wouldn't have his lunchbox with him today (Option A). Therefore, Option B is more likely - Gary will be upset and go hungry without his lunch."
"Response: 
Jake was trying to fall asleep, but he couldn't because he was restless. So option A is unlikely since it states that he did fall asleep after drinking the milk. Therefore, we should choose option B."
"Response:  The speaker of this story is walking in the park, notices someone sitting alone, approaches them, and asks how they are doing. This already shows that the speaker is being kind and compassionate towards the person. Now, let's consider the two options:

Option A: ""I listened and told him I hoped he felt better."" - This option suggests that the speaker actually listens to the person's problem and offers words of encouragement. It implies that the speaker is empathetic and caring towards the person.

Option B: ""I decided to listen to my iPod."" - This option indicates that the speaker is more interested in their own entertainment than in listening to the person's problems. It could be seen as rude or dismissive of the person's feelings.

Based on these two options, it is most likely that the speaker chose Option A and listened to the person's problem. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) I listened and told him I hoped he felt better."
"Response: 
The story states that Joe was interested in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. This means that Joe wants to learn more about this topic. Option A suggests that Joe is eagerly awaiting his advanced physics class to start, which implies that he wants to continue learning about relativity. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Since Bonnie was looking for a new job, it makes sense that she would be interested in interviewing for this position as a nanny. Therefore, option A (Bonnie called to say she didn't want an interview) is unlikely. Option B (Bonnie got the job eventually) is more plausible because it aligns with the fact that Bonnie was searching for a new job and found a listing that matched her qualifications.
Response:  If Amy had been bitten by a venomous snake, it would have caused severe swelling and pain. In this case, the ambulance would take her to the hospital for treatment, not the morgue. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Jerry told his friends that he would be participating in a marathon, which means he made a commitment to do so. However, he didn't prepare for it, which suggests that he may not have been serious about completing the race. On the day of the marathon, if Jerry is feeling anxious or stressed, it could indicate that he isn't as confident in his ability to finish the race as he led his friends to believe. Therefore, option A (Jerry attempted to run the marathon but quickly collapsed) seems more plausible than option B (Jerry won the marathon)."
"Response: 
If Dave loves the outdoors, it means that he enjoys nature and spending time in the wilderness. Therefore, option B (Dave took pictures of the tall trees) is more likely because it aligns with his interest in nature. Option A (Dave backed away slowly) may be a reasonable response if Dave were not familiar with snakes or did not know how to handle the situation, but since he recognized the danger and reacted accordingly, taking pictures seems like a more plausible action for him."
Response:  Logan loves being outside, so when he gets stung by a bee, it makes sense that he would want to go back inside afterward. Option A is the correct answer because it aligns more closely with how a child might behave given this scenario.
"Response: 
The situation described in the passage suggests that Skip has been struggling academically. This could be due to various reasons such as difficulty understanding material or lack of focus. However, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that his poor grades are solely caused by needing glasses. It is more probable that other factors such as learning disabilities or distractions in the classroom are contributing to his academic struggles. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  The situation described in the passage involves an angry stepfather throwing a plate across the room, which suggests that there may be tension or conflict present. Given this context, it is more likely that Rae would choose option A (going to fetch a broom) rather than option B (asking his brother for the name of his plumber). This is because Rae might want to clean up the mess caused by his stepfather's outburst, rather than trying to find someone to fix the problem he created. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response: 
The story states that ""Gina and her friend Lisa were listening to music in the garage."" This implies they are already doing something enjoyable together. If they were having a bad time, it's unlikely they would continue dancing or try to find more people to join them. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - they did have a good time despite not getting any response from their other friends."
Response:  If the children had been good all year, it means they must have behaved well during the entire year. This implies that they did not misbehave or do anything wrong throughout the year. Therefore, option A is more likely, as the children will probably keep the letter and cherish it as a reminder of their good behavior. 
Response:  The patient felt ill, so they made an appointment with their doctor. This means that they wanted medical attention for their symptoms. Therefore, option A (the patient discovered they had the flu) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  We know that Christian wants to get on the team, so option B is more likely.  Therefore, we choose option B.
"Response: 
Gina didn't have time to do her chores last week because she worked long hours, so it makes sense that she might feel relieved or happy about not having to do them this week. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A says ""Timmy asked his mom if he could keep that as a pet instead."" This implies that Timmy already has possession of the turtle, which we know from the beginning of the story since it states ""Timmy found a turtle in the creek"". So option A is incorrect. 
Now let's look at Option B: ""Timmy's family had turtle soup."" This is unlikely because the story does not mention anything about Timmy's family having turtles or making soup out of them. It only mentions Timmy finding a turtle in the creek. Therefore, Option B is also incorrect. 
So, the correct answer is neither Option A nor Option B."
"Response: 
Option A states ""Jen noticed that Lee's flea problem quickly got worse."" However, this does not make sense since Jen just had the fleas treated with a dip. It would take some time before more fleas could appear again. Therefore, Option A is incorrect. 
Now let's consider Option B: ""The vet suggested a flea collar for Jen's pet German shepherd."" This makes perfect sense as it aligns with what the doctor recommended earlier in the story. So, we can conclude that Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Mish received a message that she can leave now, which means she was previously waiting for something or someone. Given this context, it makes more sense that she would want to get out of there as quickly as possible rather than turning back home. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  We know that Gina searched for her phone in her dad's car but couldn't find it. Then, she ran into the house and grabbed a flashlight. This suggests that she didn't give up easily and wanted to look more thoroughly. Given this information, option A (Gina found her phone) seems more likely than option B (Gina went to bed). Therefore, I choose option A as the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story states that Sarah wore her ""best"" skirt suit, which implies that it is important to her. Additionally, the fact that she noticed a run in her stocking suggests that she is detail-oriented. Therefore, option B (Sarah got the job and was praised for her clear voice) is more likely because it aligns with Sarah's personality traits as shown in the story."
"Response: 
Linda and her boyfriend are hungry, they have different preferences (tacos for Linda, fish for him), and they feel powerful. This means that they might be more inclined to assert their own desires rather than compromising or finding a middle ground. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome - they will end up getting both."
"Response: 
The story states that Morris noticed that he was much older than the other people at the park. This suggests that he stood out or stuck out among them due to his age. Therefore, option A (Morris was bullied every day at the skate park) is unlikely because it implies that the other skaters were mean to him on purpose, which goes against the tone of the story so far. 
On the other hand, option B (the younger skaters taught Morris a lot of tricks) is more plausible because it aligns with the idea that the other skaters welcomed Morris despite his age difference. It also fits with the theme of learning new things and connecting with others through shared interests. So, based on the information provided in the story, option B is the most likely ending."
Response:  The story states that Ron's parents are both alcoholics. This means they have an addiction problem. It also says that Ron has been drinking a lot of beer himself. This suggests that he may have some degree of addiction as well. Now consider why someone might decide not to drink anymore. They might do this because they recognize their own addiction or because they don't want to follow in their parent's footsteps. In either case, quitting drinking would be a positive change for them. Option A is therefore more likely than option B since it aligns better with what we know about Ron's situation.
"Response: 
Jane wants long hair, but it becomes difficult to take care of. This suggests that having long hair might be a burden or inconvenience for Jane. Then, in the summer, she finds out that long hair makes her feel too hot. This further supports the idea that having long hair might not be ideal for Jane. Therefore, option A (Jane decides to cut her hair short for summer) seems like the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
We know that Alex woke up to bright sunlight, which means it is morning or daytime outside. We also know that Alex has an alarm clock, so she probably set it before going to bed. This suggests that Alex did not go back to sleep after waking up. Therefore, the most likely option is (A) She was late for school."
Response:  If you were okay with having a Pepsi instead of a Coke, then option A would be the correct answer. However, it seems unlikely that you would ask for a Coke again after being informed that they don't have any Coca-Cola products. Therefore, option B is more likely.
Response:  First, we need to understand that Carl was in Florida when he received the alert about the tsunami. This means he was probably near or on the coast since Florida has a long coastline along the Atlantic Ocean. Now, let's consider what might happen if Carl were to receive such an alert while at home. In this situation, it would make sense for him to immediately start evacuating to a safe location, especially given the warning from authorities. Therefore, option A is more likely - Carl was able to reach a shelter before the storm hit.
"Response:  The story starts with ""We woke up this morning to light snow falling."" This implies it was not already snowing when they went to sleep, so we can assume it started sometime during the night or early morning hours. Then, we are told that everyone went outside to play in the snow. This suggests that there were no adult supervisors present, as children would not be allowed to go out into the street without an adult's permission. Finally, we learn that they built a snowman and used a carrot for the nose. This tells us that they have access to basic materials like carrots and sticks (or other objects) to build their snowman. Given these details, option B is more likely because it provides additional information about how the kids spent their time playing in the snow."
Response:  Why do you think Joe wanted to give the squirrel a peanut in the first place? Most likely, he wanted to make friends with the squirrel or help it out because it kept coming into his yard. So if the squirrel finally took the peanut from him, that means Joe succeeded in getting close enough to the squirrel to offer it something. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Joe was happy.
"Response: 
If Arnold paid cash for the TV, he should have received a receipt as proof of purchase. Without this receipt, he may find it difficult or impossible to get a replacement or repair from the store where he bought it. So option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Eric woke up and yelped the nearest bar. This implies that he was not feeling well or was in some kind of distress. It also suggests that he may have been drinking too much the night before. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Ellie noticed that her pants were torn, so she needs to do something about it right away. Option B is the more likely outcome because finding a new pair of pants quickly will be her priority. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  The author of this story is driving home from work, gets a flat tire in bad weather conditions, and decides to change it himself instead of calling for help. This shows that they are capable and willing to take on challenges themselves, rather than relying on others. Therefore, option A (I was miserable but saved a ton) is more likely as it highlights their resourcefulness and self-sufficiency.
"Response: 
The first sentence of the story states that the narrator found their shoes uncomfortably stiff. This implies that they were not comfortable wearing them before buying new ones. Therefore, option A (the shoes gave me blisters) is more likely. "
"Response:  The story states that Marcus was ""just starting"" his first flying lesson, which implies that he had never flown before. Therefore, option A - Marcus decided to learn how to fly planes - is not a plausible choice because it assumes that he already knew how to fly. Option B - Marcus relaxed once they were in the air - makes more sense since it suggests that he felt more comfortable after gaining some experience in the air. So, the correct answer is (B) Marcus relaxed once they were in the air."
"Response: 
Option A states ""Larry was happy that he could contribute to the party."" This means that Larry felt good about being able to help his friends with the salad. It suggests that he enjoyed helping and felt useful. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Sarah has never been on a boat before, which means she doesn't have any prior experience with boats. This suggests that she may not be familiar with how they work or what to expect during a boat ride. Therefore, option A (It was such a long car trip) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a car trip. Option B (She loved every minute of it) is more plausible because it aligns with Sarah's excitement and lack of prior knowledge about boats, suggesting that she enjoyed the experience despite being new to it."
"Response: 
The story states that Neil went on a bus tour to visit the Tower of London, which suggests he was interested in learning about its history. Therefore, option B (He was fascinated) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  The husband bought a backup drive for his wife's iPhone because she was running out of space on her phone. This means that she had a lot of files and data stored on her device, including photos. However, when he tried to back them up to a drive, he failed. So, option B is the most likely answer - there were indeed too many photos to upload.
Response:  The situation described in the passage is one where Doug's wife is upset with him, so option B (Doug's wife was angry) is more likely.
"Response: 
The story states that Grace got suspended from school for two weeks because she hid all the chalk from her teacher. This means that Grace missed two weeks of classes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Jane's mother made a very good apple pie, which means that Jane wants the recipe because she likes her mother's cooking. Also, the story says that Jane always wanted the recipe but her mother wouldn't give it to her, which suggests that Jane has been asking for it for some time. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  The story states that Mark went hungry before, which means he has experienced hardship himself. Given this context, it seems unlikely that he would hate animals (Option A). Instead, given his personal experience with hunger, he might feel empathy towards the birds (Option B) who are also scavenging for food in a desperate situation. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B - He felt bad for the birds.
Response:  If you want to order a pizza, it makes sense that you would want to order one with separate toppings on each half (Option A). It's unlikely that you would suggest choosing a different movie just because some people want pepperoni and others want sausage as their topping preference. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response: 
Option A says that he ""hung out"" with her, which implies they spent some time together doing something enjoyable or interesting. This could be anything from playing games to going for a walk to having a conversation. It doesn't necessarily mean they became best friends or even saw each other again after that one encounter, but it does suggest they had a positive interaction.
On the other hand, Option B says he ""yelled at her and went home."" This is not a very plausible outcome, as it's unlikely Simon would have been so rude or aggressive towards someone he just met. It also doesn't make sense for him to get angry at her without any provocation, especially since she seemed friendly and welcoming. Therefore, we can safely rule out Option B as the most likely ending to the story."
Response:  We know that Johnny's team won the game. This means that Johnny played well in the game. Therefore, option B is the correct answer - Johnny was elated.
Response:  The teacher wrote a note to Ben's parents, indicating that he was late again. This means that Ben has been consistently late for classes, which may have caused concern for his teachers or school administrators. As a result, it is more likely that Ben's parents will take action to address the issue rather than simply letting him sleep in later. Therefore, option A (Ben's mother will now wake him up one half hour earlier) is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
Ally wishes for her boyfriend to buy her a ring. She leaves fliers at home, circles rings in magazines, and mentions it during phone calls. This indicates that she wants him to know what kind of ring she likes. Therefore, option B - ""Ally was very subtle"" - is the correct answer because it suggests that she did not directly express her desire but rather hinted around it."
"Response:  The sentence ""When I listened to it, I was blown away"" suggests that the speaker enjoyed the song very much. Therefore, option B (the speaker listened to the song all day) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  The band got what they wanted - instant fame. However, it was not through talent or hard work but rather through cheating. This could make them feel guilty or ashamed, leading to depression. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Annie was the top gymnast, so she must be good at something. However, remembering overdue homework is not exactly something that excels one's abilities as an athlete. It seems more like a regular school task. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - she will fail the class.
Response:  We know that Patricia was fascinated with microscopes when she was young. This means that she had an early interest in biology. Then we are told that she spent the next eight years studying science in school and college. This suggests that she pursued her passion for biology and continued to develop her knowledge and skills in this field. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Patricia did indeed become a biologist.
Response:  Lily joined the team after watching the World Cup, which means she started playing later than everyone else on the team. This implies that she was behind in terms of skill level compared to the other players. Therefore, option B is more likely - she eventually got better as she continued to play and practice. Option A is unlikely because there is no indication in the passage that Lily became the best player on the team.
"Response:  The story states ""At the registration desk, they asked her for her credit card."" This implies that there are security measures in place at the auction house to ensure payments are secure. It would be unlikely for them to accept cash as a deposit without proper authorization or verification processes. Therefore, option B is more likely - sadly, they were both filled with junk."
Response:  If Jessica had such a good time at the camp the previous year, it makes sense that she would be excited to return as an employee. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story states, ""Her mother was becoming suspicious."" This implies that Gina's mother is aware that something is off but doesn't know what yet. It also suggests that Gina might have been hiding something from her mother.
Now consider option A: ""Gina threw the phone away."" If Gina throws the phone away, there's no way for her mother to find it or figure out what happened to it. However, this option assumes that Gina has complete control over the situation and can dispose of evidence without being caught. Given the context of the story, it seems unlikely that Gina could successfully hide the fact that her phone was taken away from school. Therefore, we can rule out option A as the most likely outcome.
On the other hand, option B provides a more plausible explanation: ""Gina's mother never found out that her phone was taken away."" In this scenario, Gina manages to keep the incident under wraps, avoiding any confrontation with her mother. While it's possible that Gina's mother might eventually discover the truth, given the information provided in the story, it seems more likely that Gina will succeed in keeping the matter hidden. So, the answer is (B) Gina's mother never found out that her phone was taken away."
"Response: 
Meg couldn't find her favorite gold earrings, so she suspected the new maid might have stolen them. This suggests that Meg didn't check the entire house thoroughly before accusing someone of stealing. Therefore, option A (Meg couldn't think of where they could be) is the most likely answer."
Response:  We know that Marcy went looking for the kids because she hadn't seen or heard them in a while. This implies that it has been some time since she last saw them. Since she hasn't seen them in the bedrooms, it is unlikely that they are there. Therefore, option B is more likely - the children are probably in the kitchen eating lunch.
"Response: 
Ori's mom told him to get brown eggs, so it makes sense that he would be looking for those specifically. However, if all the stores are out of brown eggs, then Option B (All of the stores he went to were out of ice cream) is more likely because it doesn't make sense for all the stores to run out of a specific type of egg but not have any ice cream. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B."
"Response:  The story says that they wore Santa hats, which suggests it is Christmas-time. It also mentions that some of the patients sang along with them. This implies that the atmosphere in the nursing home was festive and joyful. Therefore, option A - ""They all had a very memorable time together"" - is the more likely outcome."
Response:  We know from the text that Maggie and her classmates went to see monkeys, gorillas, and pandas at the zoo. This means that Maggie had already seen these animals before she saw the snakes and lizards. Therefore, option A is not true because Maggie did see a panda during her visit to the zoo. So, the correct answer is (B) Maggie loved her trip to the zoo.
"Response: 
From the information provided, we know that Vianna is a full-time college student who does not have a job. This means that she has a lot of free time during the day when she could work on Amazon Turk tasks. Therefore, option A - ""Vianna now works everyday"" - is the most likely outcome. "
Response:  The story states that everyone in the family got together for Thanksgiving. This means there were multiple people involved. Then, it says that they all sat down together and ate dinner. This implies that they are all present at the same location. Finally, it mentions visiting and catching up after dinner. This suggests that they are still together and interacting with each other. Based on these details, option A (We had a great time) seems more likely because it aligns better with the information provided in the story.
"Response: 
The couple in question are Jim and his wife, who have been having issues with household chores. Jim has been feeling that his wife doesn't do her fair share of the housework, particularly when it comes to doing the dishes after meals. His wife, on the other hand, feels that Jim doesn't help out enough with cooking dinner. To address this issue, they decide to switch roles for a day to see how things go.  
On the day they switch roles, Jim finds himself struggling to cook a decent meal, while his wife struggles to keep up with the dishes. Despite their initial reservations, they find themselves enjoying their new responsibilities. However, at the end of the day, they realize that switching roles hasn't really solved anything. In fact, they miss each other's company during mealtime and feel frustrated with the quality of food prepared by the other person.  
Given these circumstances, option (B) is the most likely outcome. The couple will probably continue to alternate between their traditional roles, but without any real resolution to their underlying issues. They may come to accept their respective strengths and weaknesses as part of their relationship dynamic, rather than trying to change them completely."
"Response: 
Lina found clothes in the drawers that are too small for her kids, which means they have grown out of them. It would not make sense for Lina to force her kids to wear clothes that do not fit them just because she wants to keep them. Therefore, option A is unlikely. 
On the other hand, it makes perfect sense for Lina to give these clothes to charity. Many organizations accept gently used clothing donations, and these items can help people who are struggling financially or those who have been affected by natural disasters. By giving these clothes to charity, Lina is not only helping others but also reducing waste and making her home more organized. So, the most likely ending to this story is option B - Lina gives the clothes to charity."
Response:  If Anna wanted a banana milkshake, but her local ice cream shop doesn't offer it, then she would make one herself using her blender at home. This means she will add bananas and ice cream to the blender. Now, if the resulting taste was terrible ( Option A), then it means that either the bananas were not ripe enough or the ice cream did not mix well with the bananas. However, if the milkshake tasted good (Option B), then it means that Anna had successfully made a delicious banana milkshake using her blender at home. Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response:  The story states that the protagonist ""got into [their] car"" and ""started to drive."" This implies that they are already outside, so option A (buying chips at the gas station) is more likely. Additionally, the protagonist mentions being hungry, which suggests that they will continue to consume food rather than stopping altogether as suggested in option B. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
"Response:  The story states that Tommy was ""pretty nervous"" before the debate. This suggests that he may have been anxious or uneasy about performing in front of so many people. However, the story also states that he did well despite his nerves. This implies that he managed to overcome his anxiety and perform well under pressure. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Tommy ended up doing well despite his initial nerves."
"Response: 
Jill is a high school student who hates going to class. This means that she probably doesn't have great grades or attendance. It also means that she might be in trouble with her teachers or principal. So option A (her parents scolding her) seems like the more likely outcome. "
"Response: 
The story states, ""He was so nervous that he checked his symptoms online."" This suggests that Alex went online to research his symptoms. However, it also says, ""The online results convinced him that he had a terrible disease."" This implies that Alex may have jumped to conclusions based on his internet search. It's unlikely that he would skip his doctor's appointment after becoming concerned about his health. Therefore, option A is not the most likely answer. 
Now let's consider option B: ""Alex found out his blood sugar was low."" This could be a possible explanation for Alex's dizziness, as low blood sugar can cause similar symptoms. If this were the case, Alex might schedule an appointment with his doctor to address his condition. So, option B is more likely than option A."
Response:  We know from the context that Chris wanted to buy a new car. Since he didn't find any car he liked before seeing the red one, we can assume that he wasn't interested in any other car before this point. Therefore, option A (Chris buying the red car) is more likely than option B (Chris buying a motorcycle).
"Response: 
The story states that there were ""dozens"" of people playing musical chairs at first. This means that there are many players in total. Then, after several rounds of elimination, only two players remain. So far so good! However, option B says that the remaining two players ran a marathon. Now, this seems unlikely given the context of the story. Why would they run a marathon when they have already been playing musical chairs for hours or even days? It makes more sense that the final two players would be exhausted from all the previous rounds of eliminations and not have enough energy left to run a marathon. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A - the tall, brown-haired girl won the game."
"Response: 
Step 1: What did Henry want to do? (According to the passage) - He wanted to play a scavenger hunt for his son's birthday party. 
Step 2: What task did he undertake first? (According to the passage) - He created a list of items to retrieve. 
Step 3: How did he get help with creating the list? (According to the passage) - He turned to neighbors and nearby businesses for help. 
Step 4: What else did he have to do after creating the list? (According to the passage) - After placing items in appropriate places, he had to create the hints. 
Based on these steps, it is more likely that Option B is correct, i.e., ""The kids loved the scavenger hunt."""
"Response: 
The story states that Jake has low self-esteem, which means he doesn't believe he deserves to have friends. If John also feels this way, then they are unlikely to become more confident or make more friends. Instead, they may continue to struggle with their own feelings of inadequacy. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for these two characters."
"Response: 
Option A states that Sean was ""thrilled"" when he was finally on his way to Ireland. This implies that Sean had been looking forward to this trip for some time and was excited about it. Given that Sean was raised in an Irish-American household and has a strong connection to his heritage, it seems more likely that he would be eagerly anticipating this trip than spending his savings on something else entirely (like a new snowboard). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
If Todd had been careful with his electrical appliances, this situation would never have occurred. So option A (he used a fire extinguisher) is more likely. "
"Response: 
Why did Beth need to make mashed potatoes from scratch? Because she wanted to impress her guests with homemade mashed potatoes! That means she cared about their taste and presentation. Now, why would someone go through so much trouble if they were just going to be lazy in the kitchen? Making mashed potatoes by hand takes longer than using a food processor, but that doesn't mean Beth was lazy. She put effort into creating perfect mashed potatoes for her guests. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  The story states that John and Sue got caught kissing at school, which means they broke the rules of conduct there. As a result, they got punished with a week-long suspension. Now, if we consider option A, then it would mean that their parents are aware of what happened and instead of being angry or disappointed, they decide to throw them a big party as a reward for their love. However, this seems highly unlikely since parents usually don't react positively when their kids break school rules. Therefore, option B makes more sense, where after getting caught, John and Sue learn their lesson and stop kissing each other in school. This way, they avoid any further consequences and can continue their relationship without breaking any rules again.
"Response: 
If Biff wanted to watch a western movie, it means he enjoys them. Option A is therefore more likely."
"Response: 
The student in this scenario has just arrived at their school after getting off a bus. They are feeling happy to be back at school with their friends. This suggests that they are in a positive mood. Therefore, option A (I was relaxed and happy) is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
The story states, ""Ashley's dog has fleas and is scratching himself."" This means there are already some fleas on the dog. So option A is more likely because it says ""full of live fleas"". "
Response:  The person lived in the South End of Boston from 1968 to 1981, which means that it has been about twenty-three years since then. In 1991, the person returned to visit the bookstore where they used to buy books for ten cents each. Now let's consider what might have happened to the store during those intervening years.  If the person hated spaghetti (option A), it is unlikely that they would return to the same bookstore after all these years just to buy more books on that topic. However, if the store had changed significantly (option B) - perhaps it had moved to a new location or expanded its inventory to include other types of books - then it makes sense that the person would want to revisit their old haunt and see how things have evolved. Based on this reasoning, option B seems like the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
The story states, ""Her birthday was coming up."" This implies that it is already the present time or close to it. Therefore, option B (I bought her a dog) is more likely because it would be too late to get her a haircut on the day of her birthday."
"Response: 
Kaylee wants a puppy, but when she sees all those puppies at the farm, she gets overwhelmed with excitement. She can't decide which one to choose because they are all so cute! This means that option A is the correct answer."
Response:  We know that Neil loves the friendliness of the locals, so option B (Neil was having a great time) seems more plausible than option A (Neil was miserable).
Response:  Alice wants to be a vet, works hard in high school, and volunteers at the zoo. This means that she has already demonstrated an interest in animals and their care. Now, let's consider the endings: Option A states that Alice cried with joy upon receiving her acceptance letter. While this could happen, it doesn't necessarily mean that she will definitely attend the school she was accepted into or pursue a career as a veterinarian. Option B suggests that Alice ultimately decides to become a geologist instead. Given the information provided, it seems more plausible that Alice would choose to follow her passion for animals and become a veterinarian, making Option A the more likely choice.
Response:  The story states that the laptop wouldn't turn on, so option A is more likely because it implies that the problem was fixed when a new charger was obtained. Option B doesn't make sense in this context as there is no mention of playing Frisbee or any other activity related to the laptop's issue. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  The professor warned everyone not to mix water with acid because it could cause a dangerous reaction. If you did this mistake, the professor would definitely be upset or angry. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states, ""Jack theorized that this weekend would have perfect skiing weather."" This implies that Jack believes it will be good for skiing. Option A is the correct answer because it aligns with what the text says about Jack's beliefs."
Response:  The story says that Brad was sick with a cold, which means he had symptoms like sneezing, coughing, and feeling tired. It also says his mother gave him soup and medicine, which suggests she took care of him. Therefore, option A is more likely - Brad's mother was indeed very caring towards him.
Response:  Barry has $1000 left in his bank account. He searches for three months but can't find a job. This means he spent all of his savings during this time period. Now, it's unlikely that he would have enough money to enter a homeless shelter (Option A). Therefore, Option B is more likely. 
"Response: 
The story states that Michael gets tired while in deep water, which means he can't swim well enough to stay afloat without assistance. Therefore, option B (his friends helped him back to the shore) is more likely because it aligns with the information provided in the story. Option A (he swam even farther out than his friends dared him to) goes against the information given in the story as it implies that Michael swam further away from shore despite being unable to swim well."
"Response: 
Juan wants to make tacos, but he forgets the tortillas. He realizes this when he's already at home, ready to start cooking. At this point, going back to the store is not an option because it's closed. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that Juan will have to find another solution, like Option A - his mother shows him how to make a taco casserole instead. "
Response:  The story says that Lena was sad because she wouldn't see her friends at school, but then it also says that she took her vitamins which made her get better quickly. This implies that Lena did not actually go to school after all. Therefore, option B (Lena pretended to be sick so she could avoid her friends) is the most likely answer.
"Response:  The story states, ""His wife became concerned because they smelled unusually terrible."" This implies that she noticed something unusual about his odor. Then it says, ""She insisted that he go see a doctor."" This suggests that she took action to address her concern. Finally, it says, ""Jim's doctor told him he is becoming lactose intolerant."" So, based on the information provided in the story, option B is the most likely answer. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Jim's wife was relieved to find the source of the problem."
"Response:  The story states that Tim ""opened the box"" and ""followed the instructions."" This implies that he took his time and carefully read through all of the steps before beginning assembly. Additionally, the fact that he completed the task in just five minutes suggests that it wasn't particularly difficult for him. Therefore, option A (Tim was pleased the lamp was so easy to set up) seems like the more likely outcome."
Response:  Sandy has been taking dance classes for ten years, which means she must be quite skilled at it. And since she wants to join the dance team, it's clear that she's passionate about dancing. Now, let's consider what might happen if she breaks her toe on the day of the tryouts. It's unlikely that she would be able to perform at her best with an injured foot, especially if it's a serious injury like a broken bone. So, option A seems more plausible - she won't be able to participate in the tryouts with the injury.
"Response:  The story states that ""down the hall"" Gina can see the bully who has tripped her. This implies that the bully is nearby and still present in the area where Gina and Tami are walking. Therefore, option A (Tami bullies Gina until she starts crying) is not possible because Tami would not be able to bully Gina if the bully is already there. Option B (Tami tells the bully to get lost and looks intimidated) is more plausible as it suggests that Tami may stand up for Gina and defend her against the bully."
"Response: 
The story states that Morgan loves tea, so option A is more likely. "
"Response: 
The story says that Beth started collecting dolls. This means she liked them. Option A says she loved the cupcake but this doesn't make sense as it isn't related to the story. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. The story states that when her friend visited, they didn't have enough space to talk because the house was full of dolls. "
Response:  Jim designed his own go-kart, which means he built it from scratch using his own skills and resources. This shows that he has some mechanical knowledge and expertise. However, during the race, his tires fell off, indicating that there may have been a design or construction flaw in the go-kart itself. It is unlikely that Jim would be able to fix this problem quickly enough while racing, especially if he doesn't have any spare parts or tools with him. Therefore, option B (He wasn't able to finish the race) seems more plausible than option A (He finished in first place).
Response:  The story starts off saying that Bob wants to get his wife a special gift for Valentine's Day. This implies that they have a good relationship and are close enough for him to want to buy her something nice. Option A says that Bob got tasered by the mall cops, which seems completely unrelated to anything else in the story. It doesn't make sense that getting tasered would be the result of trying to find a gift for someone you care about. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Bob listened to his own intuition and ended up choosing the perfect gift. This makes more sense given the context of the story, as it implies that Bob trusted his own judgment rather than relying on others for advice. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  The story states ""Ida had tickets to a two-day outdoor music festival."" This means that the event takes place outside. Then we are told ""It began to rain on day one"". This implies that the first day of the festival took place during good weather conditions. However, the second part of the sentence contradicts this information as it says ""But then she saw that other attendees weren't upset."" This suggests that the rain did not stop people from enjoying themselves at the festival. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  In option A, it says ""the tornado raged overhead."" This implies that the tornado passed directly over the house where Jeff and the homeowner were hiding. However, we know from experience that tornadoes tend to cause significant damage when they pass directly over buildings. Therefore, it is unlikely that the tornado would have passed directly over the house without causing major damage. So, option A is not the most likely choice.  
On the other hand, option B states that the earthquake lasted several minutes, causing minor damage. While earthquakes can certainly cause significant damage, it is more common for them to produce short-lived shaking and vibrations rather than prolonged tremors. Additionally, the phrase ""minor damage"" suggests that the impact of the earthquake was relatively mild. Given these factors, option B seems like the more plausible conclusion to the story."
"Response: 
The executive agreed to let Charles write an article about their artist after meeting them through Facebook. This means that they were open to working with Charles in some capacity. However, when Vibe Magazine offered to publish the story on speculation, it seems unlikely that the executive would be angry about this development. In fact, they might even see it as an opportunity to gain more exposure for their artist. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Anna wants to make a cake for her mom's birthday, so option A is not possible as she would be eating it alone at home. Option B makes more sense as it implies that her mother will enjoy the cake. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Her mother enjoyed the cake greatly.
"Response: 
The story states that Ron ""knew nothing"" about animals before moving to the farm. This implies that Ron has no prior experience or knowledge of caring for animals. Therefore, it is more likely that option B (Ron hated being on the farm because he disliked the animals) is the correct answer."
Response:  Firstly, it is unlikely that the store would give Ron a prize for his actions. It is more likely that he would be arrested or charged with assault. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states that they ""got pretty good"" after practicing in the garage. This implies that their skills improved over time. Additionally, the fact that they wanted to perform for their families suggests that they were motivated and enthusiastic about their music. Given these factors, it is more likely that they continued playing together and even performed a small show for their families. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Jack has been wanting a puppy for months, so he must be very excited about this opportunity. Option A says that he will abandon the whole idea of getting a puppy, which doesn't make sense given how much he wanted one before. Therefore, we can rule out option A as the correct answer.
Now let's consider option B. Jack finds an online puppy and shows it to his parents, which means he is still interested in getting a puppy despite their initial hesitation. This makes more sense given his previous desire for a pet, so option B seems like the more plausible outcome."
Response:  The story states that Amy was practicing her volleyball skills, which means she was already good at it. So option A (Amy's dad beats her at basketball) is unlikely because there is no indication that Amy is bad at basketball or that her dad is better than her. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option B (They practiced together).
"Response:  The story states, ""His mom saw that he loved the night sky."" This implies that Jon enjoys stargazing. Then it says, ""Her mom bought him a telescope."" So, option B is more likely because it aligns better with what we know about Jon's interests. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Jon used his telescope often."
Response:  Jack went to the store to buy eggs, so he must have been looking for something specific (the eggs). Therefore, option B is more likely: the clerk will tell him where the eggs are located.
Response:  The situation described in the passage involves a young child, Jimmy, who climbs onto a counter while his mother is distracted. When he reaches for something hot on the stove, he yelps in pain. This suggests that Jimmy may have learned through experience not to touch things that are too hot or dangerous without proper supervision. Therefore, option (B) Jimmy cried is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
If Billy had thrown away the treasure he found, he would have disposed of something valuable without any reason or benefit. It doesn't make sense for him to go through all that trouble just to get rid of something worthless. Therefore, option A is unlikely.
On the other hand, if Billy found many treasures from his childhood, it means he discovered something that held sentimental value to him. Perhaps there were old toys, photos, or mementos that brought back memories of happier times. This explanation aligns with the idea of Billy going back to his childhood home after decades apart, which suggests a desire to reconnect with his past. Option B seems more plausible in this case."
"Response:  The story states ""I picked out a lot of candy and snacks!"" which suggests that the child enjoyed choosing those items. However, the second sentence states ""Then, she went to the register and paid for it all."" This implies that the mother ended up paying for all of the items, including the candy and snacks that the child chose. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - the child did eat a lot of candy that day."
"Response:  The story tells us that Mike has always had Golden Retrievers as pets when he was growing up. This means that Mike is familiar with this breed of dog. Therefore, it is more likely that he would name his new pet ""Spot,"" which is also the common name for Golden Retrievers. So option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Joe got fired, so he needs money for bills. Grant has money, so he can lend it to Joe. Therefore, option A (Joe loaning Grant some money) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Jimmy ""needed"" to learn how to code for his job. This implies that learning to code was necessary or important for his career advancement. Therefore, option A is more likely. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of cooking being related to coding."
Response:  We know from the information provided that Rakesh decided to cook lobster for dinner, picked one at the local seafood market, brought it home, and then boiled it in water before eating it with butter and corn on the cob. This suggests that Rakesh actually wanted to eat lobster for dinner, which means option B (Rakesh loved eating lobster) is the more likely answer.
Response:  When you were sixteen years old, you just started driving for the first time. You are not experienced yet so it makes sense that you would lose track of something like the brake pedal. It's a common mistake when learning how to drive. So option B is the correct answer here.
Response:  We know from the information provided that Ron woke up and saw that there was a lot of snow outside, which means he probably enjoyed playing in it. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response:  The story states that my brother loved candy, he ate a lot of it, and he left the wrappers on the counter. Then our mother scolded him for it. This implies that our mother was upset about his behavior. Now let's consider option A: ""He didn't listen until we got a lot of ants one spring."" This suggests that after being scolded multiple times, my brother finally learned his lesson when ants started appearing in the wrappers he left behind. However, this doesn't make sense since ants wouldn't be attracted to candy wrappers unless there were other food sources nearby as well. Therefore, option A is not the most likely answer. Option B, ""She showered him with praise,"" also seems unlikely since the story does not mention any instances where our mother praised or rewarded my brother for cleaning up after himself. So, the most likely ending to the story is option B: ""Our mother scolded him for it."""
"Response: 
Brad wanted eggs, but he didn't have any. This means that he must have been out of eggs. So, option (A) is correct. Therefore, the answer is Option A: Brad had delicious Eggs Benedict."
"Response: 
In this scenario, Paulo has been actively seeking votes from other students to get himself elected into the student council. This means that he has been asking for help or support from others to achieve his goal. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as Paulo would feel proud of his accomplishment after being elected."
"Response: 
The story states that one of the ducks ""started chasing"" Patrick. This implies that the duck was moving towards him in an aggressive manner. Additionally, it says that the duck ""bit"" Patrick on the leg. This suggests that the duck actually made contact with Patrick's skin and caused some harm.
Given these details, option B is the more likely outcome for Patrick: he was scared and cried after being bitten by the duck. Option A is not supported by the information provided in the story."
"Response:  The speaker mentions that they were wearing a ""new"" white dress, which implies that this is something special or important to them. Then, they mention that they spilled wine on it, which would likely ruin the dress. This means that option A (the speaker being angry at themselves) is the most likely outcome. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
"Response:  The narrator says they are ""different"" from who they used to be, implying that they have changed in some way. They also mention losing weight through exercise and diet, which suggests that their body mass index (BMI) has decreased. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice - the narrator is indeed much healthier now compared to their previous state."
Response:  We know from the context of the story that Kelly loves going to basketball games, so option A (Kelly jumped for joy) is more likely than option B (Kelly was mad that the Celtics won). Therefore, we should choose option A as the correct answer.
"Response: 
The story says that Jane's girlfriend works at a flower shop, which means she probably enjoys flowers. However, the fact that she never gets tired of her work suggests that she might not be a die-hard flower lover (Option A). Instead, Option B seems more plausible since it mentions activities like biking, hiking, and walking the dog, which are common interests outside of work for someone who enjoys spending time outdoors. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B."
"Response:  The story says that Michael ""finally reached the top"" of the mountain, which means he succeeded in his goal. It also mentions that he can see land and water on the other side of the mountain from the top, which suggests that he has a great view. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer - Michael loved the view and hoped to return."
Response:  We know that Damon lost his wallet with his ID in it. Then he searched all over the house but couldn't find it anywhere. This means that he didn't find it even after searching thoroughly. So option B is more likely as it suggests that he found his wallet under the bed where he might have missed it earlier while searching elsewhere. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states that David and Mia ""were finally able to get away"" to see a movie on a Friday night when they have young children. This implies that they don't often get time for themselves due to family responsibilities. Then, the story reveals that the movie was bad, which caused them to laugh uncontrollably. Given these details, option A (David and Mia decided to leave the movie) is more likely because it makes sense that they would want to escape an unenjoyable experience. Option B (David and Mia thought the movie was profound) doesn't align with the given information as there's no indication in the passage that they found the movie meaningful or enjoyable."
Response:  We know that Bob took his daughter to visit Grandma, they had a nice dinner together, and Grandma welcomed them with open arms. This suggests that their relationship is positive and loving. Therefore, option A (Bob's daughter thanked Grandma for the delicious meal) is more likely. It would be unusual for Bob to drive home angrily after such a pleasant visit.
Response:  The story states that Sue's cat was stuck in a tree, which means it could not get down on its own. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it implies that someone (in this case, the fire department) helped the cat get down safely. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that Sue did nothing to help the cat and simply left it there, which seems unlikely given the concern expressed in the story about finding the missing pet.
"Response: 
If Ava had flushed all the aquarium water down the toilet, there wouldn't be any water left in the tank for the catfish or any of the other fish to swim in! So option A is not possible. 
On the other hand, if we assume that all the fish got along just fine with the new addition (the catfish), then it's more likely that they would have been curious about each other at first but eventually learned to coexist peacefully. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  The person loves going to the movies, but they had to travel further after their local theater closed. So, it's unlikely they will choose option A (It costs more for gas to the other theater). Therefore, the most likely answer is option B (I still go to the same theater that I always have).
"Response: 
The story starts with ""I bought a new car today."" This implies that the speaker already owns the car, which means they are unlikely to get rid of it. Therefore, option A is not the most likely choice. 
Now let's consider option B: ""I drive the car everywhere I go."" This fits well with the description of the car being ""shiny and red"" and smelling ""fresh and clean"". It also aligns with the enthusiastic tone of the story, as the speaker seems to be enjoying their new purchase. So, option B is the most likely choice."
Response:  Teresa made a beautiful sculpture, so that's good! However, she then entered it into an art contest. This means there are other artists competing against her, which could be difficult for her. If all the judges like her sculpture very much, this would mean they thought it was one of the best entries in the contest. So far, so good! But if she wins the contest, this means she will get some kind of prize or recognition for her work. Unfortunately, being disqualified means she did not meet the rules or requirements of the contest, so she cannot win any prizes. Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response: 
The dog and owner went for a walk together. They returned home after walking around the block. This means that the dog has been exercising with its owner. After their return, the dog takes a big drink of water. This indicates that the dog needs more hydration because it has been active. Therefore, option B (She was jumping up and down begging for another walk) is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The story states that Matt found the puppy wandering down the street, which means it must have been separated from its owner at some point. Therefore, option A (the puppy's owner gave Matt a reward) is more likely. "
"Response: 
The story states that Mike rode his bike from his house to a friend's house, which means he was cycling on a road or path. This increases the risk of an accident occurring. 
Furthermore, neither Mike nor the kids were wearing helmets while riding their bikes. Wearing a helmet can significantly reduce the severity of head injuries sustained during a crash. Therefore, it is more likely that Mike will have an accident if he doesn't wear a helmet. 
Now let's consider option B: ""Mike accidentally collided with the kids."" In this scenario, there are several ways the collision could occur. For example, Mike might have lost control of his bike due to poor road conditions, another cyclist or pedestrian suddenly appearing in front of him, or even a sudden gust of wind blowing him off course. Any of these factors could cause Mike to collide with the kids, resulting in potential injuries. 
Based on the information provided in the story, option B seems more plausible than option A."
"Response: 
If Lucy had put the pan in the oven and then sat down to watch TV, that means she left the kitchen for an extended period of time while the food was cooking. This increases the likelihood that she might not have noticed if the timer didn't go off. Therefore, option A (the meal being burned) is more likely."
Response:  The story states that Tim arrived late to class due to being tired. This means that he missed some of the lesson already. Then it says that when he woke up, class was almost over. This implies that he didn't pay much attention during the part of the lesson where he was awake either. Therefore, option B (Tim failed the final exam) is the more likely outcome as he wasn't able to keep up with the lesson throughout the entire class period.
"Response: 
Step 1: Amy calls her internet provider for help. 
Step 2: The representative does not acknowledge Amy's issue. 
Step 3: Amy repeats herself, but still gets nowhere. 
Based on these steps, it seems most likely that option B (Amy hangs up the phone angrily) is the correct choice."
"Response:  The story states that Sam ""typed up his closing paragraphs"" which implies he had been working on the essay for some time already. Then it says ""All of a sudden, his screen was covered in a large blue error message"". This suggests that the problem occurred unexpectedly while he was working on the essay. Therefore, option A (he was disappointed in his broken computer) is more likely as he would be upset that his work was interrupted by the technical issue."
Response:  The story states that Doug and Molly took the dog back to their apartment, which means they had possession of the animal. However, we know that dogs are living creatures and require care and attention. It would be unethical for them to keep the dog without making any effort to find its rightful owner. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome - they did not find the owner and kept the dog.
"Response: 
The story states ""He (Bill) was too young to understand the value of practice."" This implies that Bill does not currently appreciate or enjoy practicing his piano scales. It also suggests that he may not see any benefits from doing so. Therefore, option A - ""Bill was happy to practice every day"" - is unlikely because a young child would not be motivated to practice without understanding why it is important.
On the other hand, as Bill gets older, he may start to realize the importance of practice and become more invested in it. Option B - ""As Bill got older, he realized all of that practice helped him"" - is therefore more plausible. At this point, Bill has had time to reflect on his experiences and understand how consistent practice has contributed to his improvement as a pianist."
"Response: 
The story states that Carlos ""limps"" home after hurting his knee while walking. This implies that he may be experiencing some pain or discomfort after the injury. It is unlikely that he would then decide to go play soccer right away, as this could exacerbate the injury further. Therefore, option A (Afterwards Carlos puts a bandage on his knee) seems more plausible."
Response:  Why did Lance want to have a romantic evening with his wife? Because he wants to impress her, make her happy, and feel loved. So far, so good! But then something went wrong...he burnt down the kitchen while trying to prepare dinner. Oops! Now, how would you expect Lance's wife to react in this situation? She might be upset, right? After all, their kitchen is now destroyed, and they could have been injured or worse. Option B seems like the more logical choice here.
"Response: 
The story states that Keith went to a pet store to see the animals. This means he was there to observe them, not to buy anything. Therefore, option A (Keith ordered a burger and fries) is unlikely because it implies that he made a purchase at the store, which we know he did not do based on the text.
On the other hand, option B (Keith watched some of the colorful fish) makes more sense since the story mentions that Keith petted a few of the puppies, indicating that he was interested in interacting with the animals at the store. Watching the fish would be consistent with this behavior. So, the correct answer is option B."
"Response: 
The premise of the story is that Maria wants to learn Spanish and decides to fully immerse herself in it. This means she will be surrounded by native Spanish speakers and will have plenty of opportunities to practice speaking the language. It also implies that she has made significant progress in learning Spanish within a relatively short period of time (six months). Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - Maria is proud to learn a new language so quickly."
"Response: 
The story states that Jay was ""stuck"" in the elevator, which means he couldn't move or leave. The next sentence says that it stopped between floors and the lights flickered, implying that there was no power. This suggests that Jay was trapped with no way to escape. Given these details, option A (firefighters coming to rescue him) seems unlikely since it would be difficult for them to reach him without any power in the building. Therefore, the more plausible outcome is option B (Jay taking a nap). "
Response:  Ben was babysitting a child for the first time ever, which means this is his debut experience as a babysitter. It is unlikely that he would be hired again or become a professional babysitter after one-time gig since it requires extensive experience and training to handle children safely and effectively. Therefore, option (B) is more plausible.
"Response: 
Option A states that Ted's friends thought he would run in the campaign uncontested, which means they believed he had an easy path to victory without opposition. However, since Ted's personal issue derailed his campaign, it's unlikely that he would have been able to run unopposed. Therefore, Option A is not the most likely outcome.

Now let's consider Option B: Ted decided to run for county magistrate a year later. This option suggests that despite the setback of his failed Senate campaign, Ted remained determined to pursue politics and found another opportunity to do so. It's possible that he could have learned from his mistakes and become a stronger candidate in the future. So, Option B is the more plausible conclusion to the story."
"Response: 
The story states ""it rolled into the creek."" This implies that Julie lost her ball in the water. Since she can no longer play with it, option A is the most likely choice - she continued playing with the ball all afternoon despite losing it in the creek."
"Response:  Why would we curse our mother-in-law instead of being grateful towards her? It doesn't make sense, does it? So, option B - ""We thanked Mama for her huge favor"" is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Bob decided to hike in the jungles of Indonesia despite forgetting his malaria vaccine. This implies that Bob was not being reckless but rather careless or negligent. Option B provides an additional detail about Bob's forgetfulness by mentioning that he also forgot his shoes. However, this does not necessarily make option B more likely than option A as it only adds another aspect of Bob's forgetfulness without changing the overall scenario. Therefore, based on the information provided in the story, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Since John has owned the bike for over two decades, it holds sentimental value to him. He may have fond memories of riding it as a teenager or young adult. It could also be an heirloom that he wants to pass down to future generations. Therefore, option A (Carl decided to give the bike to his son) seems more plausible than option B (Carl threw the old bike away)."
Response:  Kim has just discovered that she unknowingly ate something disgusting, so she runs to the bathroom to vomit. Once she reaches the bathroom, she no longer feels like vomiting, which means her stomach has calmed down. Given this information, option B (She slowly drank a glass of water to calm her stomach) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  At age 9, Carl looks into a telescope for the first time and becomes fascinated with space. This leads him to study science and astronomy throughout his education. Now, it's possible that he could have become a scientist after completing his studies, but there are many other career paths he could have taken as well. For example, he might have pursued a career in engineering, physics, or even astrophysics. However, given the information provided in the story, it seems less likely that Carl would end up working as a garbage man. While anything is possible, based on what we know so far, option A (he ends up becoming a scientist) seems like the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
In this scenario, Barry loves making trouble for others, so he might tease or mock Julie about her costume. Therefore, option A (Julie was incredibly embarrassed) is more likely."
"Response:  The story states that James ""decided to begin training for a marathon."" This implies that James has never run a marathon before, so option A (James finishing in the top 50) is unlikely because it would mean that James already has experience running long distances. Instead, given that James is new to this type of training, option B (James being ashamed of what he did) seems more plausible as it suggests that James may have pushed himself too hard or not been prepared enough for the race, leading to disappointment or shame."
"Response:  The story states ""recklessly"" which means he/she was not careful enough while cycling. Then it says ""accident"". This implies that something bad happened. Now let's consider option A. If he/she got into an accident, it's unlikely they would want to become a professional cyclist because it could be dangerous for them or others around them. Option B makes more sense here as it shows caution after the incident occurred. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
"Response: 
The situation: Gina whispers something to Mary during class, making the teacher unhappy. 
Reasoning: Based on the context of the story, it seems unlikely that the teacher would join their conversation. Teachers are typically strict and enforcers of rules, not friendly participants in students' personal conversations, especially during class time. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Since Daniel came home from a night out, he might be tired or intoxicated. Therefore, option A (checking the breaker box) seems more plausible than option B (turning on the kitchen light and having a snack). So, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  The situation described in the story involves a police officer pulling someone over for speeding, which could potentially lead to a ticket or other consequences. Therefore, option A (hoping the officer will just give a warning) seems like the more realistic choice given the context of the story.
Response:  The problem in this scenario is that Melissa's son is consistently late getting ready for school, so it makes sense that Melissa would want to find a solution to help him be more punctual. Option A suggests that Melissa's mother recommended putting her son to bed earlier, which could potentially help him wake up on time for school. However, without additional context or information about the specific circumstances involved, it's difficult to say whether this suggestion would actually solve the problem. On the other hand, option B suggests that Melissa's mother recommended putting her son to bed later, which could also potentially contribute to his tardiness if he doesn't have enough time to get ready for school before leaving the house. Ultimately, we can't know for sure what Melissa's mother advised without further details from the passage. Therefore, neither option can be considered as the most likely outcome based solely on the given text.
"Response:  The story says that Mark was getting ready for a big fight, which means it's a competitive event where people compete against each other. It also mentions that Mark was feeling nervous, which suggests that he might be worried about losing or doing poorly in the competition. However, later on in the story, it says that Mark had won all rounds of the fight, which implies that he performed very well and emerged victorious. Therefore, option B - ""Mark became famous and made a lot of money"" - is the most likely outcome given the information provided in the story."
"Response: 
The story states that Rex saved up his money for a long time to go on this trip, which means he was excited about it. Then, when he arrives in Argentina, he gets to eat delicious food and drink different wines, which suggests he is enjoying himself even more. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer - Rex does enjoy himself during his trip to Argentina."
"Response: 
If Ken wanted to learn how to play the organ, option A would be more likely because he would want to take it home and practice on it. Burning it in an empty field doesn't make sense as it wouldn't serve any purpose for him to do so. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Jay and Bella love fish tanks, so it makes sense that they would want to buy some fish to put in their new tank. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  May invited her friends for a picnic in the park. This means they were going to have food and drinks there. If May forgot the ice, then it means that all the drinks will not be cold. Option B is the correct answer because it makes more sense that they would still have a good time at the picnic even if the drinks are not cold.
"Response: 
Option A states, ""She loved her new turtle."" This implies that Sandra got what she wanted in the end. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  We know that there were ""a group of children"" who wanted to play marbles together. However, we also know that they had difficulty agreeing on how to play the game. This suggests that they may have been arguing with each other about the rules or strategy of the game. Perhaps some children wanted to use different types of marbles or to change the way they took turns playing. Whatever their disagreement was, it seems unlikely that they would simply decide to switch games without further discussion or argumentation. Therefore, option A (the children decided to play hide and seek instead) is more likely than option B (the children decided to play marbles)."
Response:  We know that Francisco studied accounting at the local university, which means he gained knowledge about accounting. Then we are told that he passed all his exams, which suggests that he did well in his studies. Therefore, option A (Francisco became an accountant) is the most likely outcome of the story.
Response:  Jessica wants to feed the birds without buying feeders, so she gathers pinecones under the trees and attaches strands of ribbon to them. Next, she rolls the pinecones in peanut butter and birdseed. This suggests that she intends to hang the pinecones from the trees as food for the birds. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Why did the girl go to this restaurant with her uncle? Because she thought it was ""so cool"". So, option A is more likely."
Response:  We know that Betsy came home late at night and wanted something quick and easy to eat. Spaghetti fits this bill perfectly! So option A is more likely.
Response:  The story says that Han and Leia fought in a great battle together, which means they must have been romantically involved at some point. This implies that they had a sexual relationship. Now, if they had a child together, it would mean that their sexual relationship resulted in pregnancy and birth of a child. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - their child looks like both of them.
"Response: 
The story states that Gina was not supposed to use her phone in detention, so Option A is unlikely. Therefore, we can eliminate option A from consideration. Now let's consider option B: ""Gina's teacher wasn't fooled at all and gave her more detention."" This outcome makes sense given that Gina tried to deny ownership of the phone despite the evidence. It's likely that the teacher would be unimpressed with this attempt to avoid punishment and give her additional detention as a result. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  We know that Jill had trouble breathing, which suggests that something might be physically wrong with her. So option A is more likely because it implies that Jill took action to address her problem (going to the doctor) and as a result, she found out what was causing her difficulty breathing. Option B does not make sense in this context since stopping meditation would not solve her physical symptoms. Therefore, we can conclude that option A is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story.
"Response: 
The story starts with ""Jan had to pick up her daughter after class."" This implies that it is a weekday, as classes are usually held during the weekdays. Therefore, option A is unlikely, as it suggests that it is a Saturday when Jan realizes it.
Now let's consider option B: ""And saw the biggest bear she had ever seen."" While it is possible for Jan to see a bear while waiting at the school entrance, it doesn't make much sense given the context of the story. It would be unusual for a mother to encounter a bear near a school, especially if it's a busy urban area where schools are located.
Therefore, based on the information provided in the story, the most likely ending is option B: And saw the biggest bear she had ever seen."
"Response: 
Firstly, breaking one's big toe can be quite painful. So option A (Sara crying out in pain) seems more plausible than option B (Sarah laughing hysterically). Therefore, we should choose option A as the correct answer."
Response:  The story states that Pat takes a bus from New York to New Jersey every day, which means he has been doing this for many years. This implies that Pat is currently old, as he has spent decades commuting daily. Now, let's consider what might be running through Pat's mind at this stage of his life. Option A seems more plausible here because Pat would likely regret not moving closer to where he works earlier on. As an older person, he may feel that he could have saved himself the trouble and expense of long-distance commutes over the years. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  The story states that ""all his friends would be there"" which means they are going to watch him play, so option (B) is more likely since it involves something funny or unexpected happening during the game. Option (A) does not make sense in this context since shaking knees do not necessarily mean one is nervous about playing hockey but could also be due to other reasons like cold weather or fatigue. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
Response:  The situation described in the passage is one of conflict, as Joan is having trouble sleeping due to her roommate's music playing late at night. In response to Joan's complaint, the roommate promises to be more considerate and begins wearing headphones. This suggests that the roommate is taking steps to address Joan's concerns and improve their living arrangement. Therefore, the most likely ending to the story is Option B: Joan was thankful that her roommate was so caring.
"Response:  We know that Pete got off of work at 5 PM. The gym is located near his house so it would take him about 10 minutes to get there from work. Therefore, we can assume that Pete arrived at the gym around 5:10 PM. Now let's consider option A: ""He showered after he finished working out."" This means that Pete finished his workout around 6 PM, which is when he would have had time to shower before going home. However, since Pete did not go home right away after his workout, it is unlikely that he showered afterwards. Therefore, option A is not the most likely choice. Option B: ""Pete went to the baseball stadium"" does not make sense in this context as there is no information provided about Pete going to a baseball stadium. So, the most likely ending to the story is option B: ""Pete went home""."
"Response: 
Clare wants to go for a walk, so she goes outside. The sun begins to rise, making it hotter. Therefore, option A (She took off her jacket to cool off) is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Nina delivered papers to earn money for a prom dress. This means she wanted to save up for something specific - in this case, a prom dress. So option B is more likely: She earned enough to buy the dress."
Response:  The story states that Gina and Tami were walking around the playground and talked for five minutes. This means they had something to talk about initially. However, after some time, Gina ran out of things to say. This indicates that option A (Tami wishing Gina would shut up) is unlikely because there is no indication that Tami was annoyed or frustrated with Gina's constant talking. Instead, it seems more plausible that Gina simply couldn't think of anything else to say, leading us to choose option B (They just walked comfortably in silence for a while).
"Response: 
Option A says that Harry ""quickly fixed the problem"" for his mother. This implies that he was able to identify and resolve the issue in a short amount of time. Given that Harry is particularly skilled at computer repair, this outcome seems quite plausible. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
The story states ""Just today I watched them scam a requester I had grown to love."" This implies that the person has been watching this happen frequently, which suggests they have experience with it. Additionally, the fact that they were able to identify the scammer and watch their actions implies a level of observational skill. Therefore, option A (I like helping others) seems more likely as the person in question enjoys assisting those in need."
Response:  The situation described in the story involves two friends, Stacy and Kevin, who are spending time together at a park. Stacy buys a bag of chips and shares some with Kevin. This act of kindness suggests that Kevin is likely to be grateful for Stacy's generosity rather than angry. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
Glenn has been feeling unwell during breakfast with his mother-in-law present. He believes she might be trying to harm him. This could suggest that he has some underlying issues or insecurities related to his relationship with his in-laws. It is unlikely that he would suddenly change his mind and hug his mother-in-law without any explanation or context. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Kendall has a lot of work to do, but she also gets paid well for her efforts. This suggests that she values the money more than she dislikes the work itself. Therefore, option A (If it weren't so easy, I would have quit) is unlikely because if she didn't enjoy the work enough, she wouldn't be doing it in the first place. On the other hand, option B (Next week she will relax when it's all over) makes sense since she does seem tired from all the work and looks forward to taking some time off once it's done. So the correct answer is option B.
Response:  The story states that they left early in the morning to make the most of their time, which suggests that they wanted to arrive at their destination as soon as possible. Additionally, the fact that they had a lot of stuff to pack and load into the truck implies that this trip was not just a quick weekend getaway but rather a longer journey. Given these details, it seems unlikely that they would decide to return home mid-trip, especially since they didn't mention any unforeseen circumstances or problems along the way. Therefore, option A is the more plausible choice - my dad always drove safely and we arrived quickly.
"Response:  We know that Gill loved Columbo so much that she watched every episode multiple times and even owns all of them. This suggests that she has a deep appreciation for the show and its characters. However, we also learn that Gill starts acting like Columbo sometimes. This could be interpreted as her trying to emulate his mannerisms or personality traits, perhaps even subconsciously identifying with him. Now, let's consider the two possible endings: Option A states that Gill and Peter Falk (the actor who played Columbo) hated each other. While it's possible that they may have had some kind of feud in real life, there's no concrete evidence to suggest this. In fact, Falk himself praised Gill's performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, saying ""She's got the whole thing down pat."" So, based on available information, it seems unlikely that Gill and Falk disliked each other. Option B suggests that Gill's attempts at solving murders are less successful. Again, while it's possible that she might try to use Columbo's methods to solve crimes outside of the TV show, there's no indication in the passage that she actually does this. In fact, the passage only mentions that she acts like Columbo sometimes, without providing any details about how she uses those mannerisms in real-life detective work. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely outcome is that Gill simply enjoys imitating Columbo's personality traits without necessarily attempting to solve murders."
"Response:  The story states that Chad ""came close"" to bowling a perfect game, which means he got many strikes in a row. However, he then missed his second-to-last strike. This implies that he did indeed miss the last strike, as there are no other strikes left to miss. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The husband has just discovered that his wife is having an affair with another man, and he is angry about it. He watches from outside the window as they embrace each other passionately. Feeling jealous and betrayed, he bursts into their room and attacks the other man, killing him in a fit of rage.

Now, let's consider which option is most likely to happen next:

Option A: His cheating wife continues the affair.
In this scenario, the husband's violent outburst may not have stopped the affair completely. Perhaps the wife will try to cover up the incident or even continue seeing the other man behind her husband's back. This could lead to further conflict and tension in their marriage, potentially causing more harm than good.

Option B: His cheating wife calls the police and he is arrested.
In this scenario, the husband's actions are clearly illegal and could result in severe consequences, including criminal charges. It is unlikely that the wife would want to continue the affair after such a dramatic event, especially if she values her safety and well-being. Therefore, Option B seems like the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
The story states that Ivan got bitten by a mosquito while hiking in a forest. This means he was outside in nature, which suggests he might not have access to medical care or supplies right away. Therefore, option B (Ivan bought mosquito repellent for his next hike) is less likely as it implies he had the opportunity to purchase something before the incident occurred. Option A (Ivan was happy the hike ended so well) seems more plausible given the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
The story states that Paige was a very good student who always got the best grades among her peers. This implies that Paige is diligent and hardworking. Now, when Paige became sick, it disrupted her routine and caused her to fall behind in her studies. This suggests that Paige may struggle to catch up with her work due to her illness. Therefore, option B (Paige had to rely on her friends for their support) is the most likely outcome as it aligns with the characterization of Paige as someone who needs help to get back on track after falling behind."
Response:  We know from the information provided in the story that John enjoyed talking to Jessica and wanted to spend more time with her. This suggests that he found her attractive or interesting. Therefore, option B (John was glad he asked her on a date) is the most likely answer.
"Response: 
If the man didn't like music, he would have thrown the flute away or put it back on the shelf without even touching it. But instead, he took it home and started playing it, which means he liked music. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  We know from the context of the story that Maggie was initially scared but also excited about going on the space mountain ride with her mom. This suggests that she might have been nervous but looking forward to it. Given this, option B - ""The ride was very fun for Maggie"" - seems more likely as it aligns better with her initial excitement. Option A - ""Maggie was glad that the wait in line was so short"" - doesn't quite fit with the character's emotions as it implies she wasn't particularly invested in the ride beforehand."
