Explanation: The story states that the person became a fan of Law and Order in 2011, after recovering from a stroke. This implies that they were not already a fan of the show before their recovery, which means they would have had to start watching it for the first time during this period. Given that they were able to watch every episode, it is more likely that they chose option B and eventually watched them all."
