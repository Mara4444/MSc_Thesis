"Response: 
B: Eventually I watched them all. 
Explanation: The person in the story is recovering from a stroke and has limited mobility, but they are determined to watch every episode of Law and Order despite their limitations. They eventually manage to finish watching the entire series, which suggests that they have a strong interest in the show and are willing to put in the effort to see it through to the end. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Bob asked the man for tea.
Explanation: The story states that ""Jim asked Bob to say his character's catch phrase,"" indicating that someone else (Jim) initiated the request, not Bob. Additionally, the story mentions that Bob ""exploded with rage,"" which suggests that he may have been feeling uncomfortable or frustrated by the request rather than simply asking the person to leave him alone. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
B: Lita folded the laundry while watching television."
"Response: 
B) Liv then changed the light bulb. 
Explanation: The story states that Liv ""realized it was the light bulb in her kitchen burning out,"" which implies that she has already decided to replace it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: The children's behavior calmed the mother down. 
Explanation: In this situation, the mother is already feeling stressed due to the unexpected phone call and the mess made by the dog. When the children start pestering her while she's still on the phone, it could potentially make her feel even more agitated or irritable. However, since the children are young and may not fully understand the gravity of the situation, they might unintentionally provide a source of comfort or distraction for their mother, which could help calm her down. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Hector kept brewing his own coffee and saved money. 
Explanation: The story states that Hector realized his coffee buying habit was expensive, which suggests that he may have continued to buy coffee at the local shop if it were not for him deciding to brew coffee at home instead. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome as it aligns with the information provided in the story."
"Response: 
B: Kelly was happy to have made a new friend."
"Response: 
B: He was proud to finish first by age but tenth overall.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems more likely that Tommy was proud of finishing first in his age group rather than feeling ashamed about not getting any recognition. The fact that he didn't realize they would give out awards by age group suggests that he may have been focused on his overall placement in the race rather than just winning his age group."
"Response: 
B) Laurie ended the night by kissing her date. "
"Response: 
B - Neil saved the photos on his computer."
"Response: 
Option B: Bob went out after work wearing the sailor suit. 
Explanation: The story states that Bob ""forgot"" to change back into his street clothes after work, which implies that he did not immediately go home but instead remained in the uniform for the rest of the evening. This suggests that Bob may have worn the sailor suit outside of work, as there would be no reason for him to keep the uniform on if he were only going to be at work during the day."
"Response: 
Option A: My dog bit her. 
Explanation: The story states, ""My dog bit her."" This implies that the dog actually bit the visitor when she tried to interact with it despite being warned not to do so. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome of this situation."
"Response: 
B - Decides Never to Draw Again.
Explanation: Lester was able to create a good drawing, but he may not have enjoyed the process or found it fulfilling enough to continue practicing. It is possible that he felt frustrated with himself for not being as skilled as he had hoped, or that he simply lost interest after achieving his initial goal. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Pablo does not enjoy eating worms.
Explanation: The passage states that Pablo ""likes to eat worms"" but also mentions that he reads a book on how to do this, implying that it may be something he has learned rather than an inherent preference. Additionally, the fact that he only does this at least once a month suggests that it may not be something he particularly enjoys. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
B: It was the best trip of her life. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it seems more likely that Kira's trip to Japan was a positive experience for her. The fact that she had been saving money for years and had a strong interest in Japanese culture suggests that she was well-prepared and enthusiastic about the trip. Additionally, the phrase ""it was the best trip of her life"" implies that the experience was particularly meaningful or enjoyable for her. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Glen swore he'd never walk again.  
Explanation: In this scenario, Glen had an unfortunate accident while walking, which resulted in him injuring his knee. As a result, he may be hesitant or reluctant to continue walking, especially if the injury is severe enough. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B - His friends polished his furniture."
"Response: 
B: The driver of the car became very angry at me. 
Explanation: In this scenario, you were hit by a car while crossing the street. The driver of the car stopped and apologized, but their apology did not alleviate your injuries or prevent further conflict from arising. It's possible that the driver may have been shaken up themselves or felt threatened in some way, leading them to become angry with you for causing the accident. This outcome aligns more closely with the original situation described in the passage than option A, which implies that you simply brushed off the incident without any negative consequences."
"Response: 
B: Gina's sister went to the doctor.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Gina's sister would go to the doctor after cutting her ankle on broken glass than for them to have ice cream at home. Cuts can be serious injuries and may require medical attention to prevent infection or further complications."
"Response: 
B: At the end of the year, he did well on his reading test.
Explanation: In this story, the little boy faced a challenge (struggling with reading) and took action by practicing every day. As a result, he improved significantly (did well on his reading test). This outcome is more likely than Option A, where the little boy accepts his struggle without taking any action to improve."
"Response: 
B - Rosie kept the bowl of fruit salad in her fridge at home."
"Response: 
B: Kelly bought a new phone. "
"Response: 
B: I have negative memories of that time. 
Explanation: The fact that the speaker remained with this person for several months suggests that they may have been in a romantic relationship or at least had strong feelings for them. However, the use of the word ""older"" to describe him implies that there could be an age difference, which can sometimes create power imbalances in relationships. Additionally, the fact that the speaker does not mention any positive aspects of their time together suggests that it may have ended poorly. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
A) Bob was very proud."
"Response: 
B - Her classmates were given awards for their behavior. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it is unlikely that the principal would suspend Jackie's rowdy classmates for disrupting her duties as a hall monitor. Instead, they may be rewarded or recognized for their good behavior, which could encourage them to continue being well-behaved in the future."
"Response: 
B: We were both flattened by the vehicle.
Explanation: The story states that another car ran a stop sign and crashed into them, which suggests that the impact was severe enough to cause serious injury or even death to both the narrator and their father. Option B is therefore the more likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
Option A: She sings it over and over again. 
Explanation: The story states that the child ""screams let it go,"" which suggests that they are excitedly singing or shouting the phrase, rather than simply saying it in a neutral tone. Additionally, the fact that the child goes around the house singing the phrase suggests that they have a strong interest in the song and enjoy repeating it. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome for this story."
"Response: 
B) He attempted a three-pointer and missed. 
Reason:  Alex's decision to take a three-pointer with only five seconds remaining in the game is risky and unlikely to result in a successful shot. It would be more realistic for him to try to find an open teammate or attempt a pass to the basket rather than taking a long-range shot under pressure."
"Response: 
B: I asked him what his problem was. 
Explanation: In this situation, it seems like the person being stared at is feeling uncomfortable or annoyed with the child's behavior. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice because it shows that they are taking action to address the issue directly rather than simply ignoring it (option A)."
"Response: 
B - The couple will be happy to know they have a baby on the way."
"Response: 
Option A: Catherine then began to practice every day and got good at it. 
Explanation: Based on the story provided, option A is the most likely outcome for Catherine. The story highlights her interest in curling and her desire to learn more about the sport after being invited to play during a practice session. It's unlikely that Catherine would lose interest in the sport immediately after expressing curiosity about it. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response: 
B: Francis decides he would rather take public transportation. 
Explanation: The story states that Francis passed his driver's test easily, indicating that he was able to learn how to drive successfully. However, instead of continuing to use this new skill, Francis decides to take public transportation instead. This suggests that there may be factors beyond just practicality or convenience that influence Francis' decision, such as personal preferences or environmental concerns."
"Response: 
B - I wanted to see it again.
Explanation: In this story, the speaker expresses their positive feelings towards the performance of The Nutcracker. They use words such as ""great,"" ""beautiful,"" and ""honored"" to convey their enthusiasm. Given these language choices, it is more likely that they would want to see the show again rather than vowing never to see it again."
"Response: 
B: When I got there, I took a nap. 
Explanation: The story mentions that it was 10:20 am when the protagonist arrived at their dorm after walking from class. This implies that they had been awake for at least an hour already, which makes taking a nap unlikely. Therefore, option B is the more plausible ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Lisa confesses she also has a crush on Gary. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it is more likely that Lisa will have a positive reaction to receiving the poem from Gary than to being slapped by him. Additionally, the fact that Gary is trying to get Lisa's attention through creative means suggests that he may be interested in her romantically as well. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B) Carlos makes the most of his French on his trip to Paris."
"Response:  Option A: Lars fell in love with photography. 
Explanation: The story states that Lars ""shot images of nature every day"" after buying his first camera, indicating that he became interested and enjoyable in taking pictures. It's unlikely that someone would spend time and effort consistently capturing photos if they didn't find pleasure in it, so option A is the more plausible choice."
"Response: 
B: The employee was later found dead. 
Explanation: This option is more likely because it provides a twist on the typical outcome of a broken appliance. In this scenario, the employee who sold you the warranty may be connected to your broken TV in some way, perhaps by being responsible for its malfunction or by having a personal stake in your misfortune. This adds an element of mystery and suspense to the story, making it more intriguing than simply having the TV repaired under warranty."
"Response: 
B - Ryan then found the girl and gave her the balloon she lost. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Ryan found the little girl who lost the balloon and returned it to her rather than popping the balloon himself. The story does not suggest any malicious intentions from Ryan, and it is natural for him to want to help someone who has lost something precious to them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
Option A: Then she sent it to her manager. "
Response:  Option A: Neil had a great time. 
"Response: 
B) I let my dog go inside the house. 
Explanation: In this situation, the speaker did not have access to the leash they needed to take their dog for a walk. Rather than taking the dog outside without a leash or finding an alternative solution, the speaker chose to allow the dog to enter the house unsupervised. This option is less likely than Option A, which suggests that the speaker would take the dog to another location where a leash was available."
"Response: 
B - Joe regretted going outside.
Explanation: The story states that Joe got tired halfway to the coffee shop, indicating that he may not have been in the best condition for walking. Additionally, the fact that he had to get tired suggests that he may have overexerted himself, which could lead to regret. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Jen found her new coat inside the package."
"Response: 
B: Frank got an all-new game.
Explanation: In this story, Frank misbehaved by refusing to do his homework and throwing a tantrum. As a consequence, he was punished. However, rather than taking away something he already had (like his video games), his parents gave him a new game as a reward for completing his homework. This outcome suggests that Frank learned that doing his homework can lead to positive outcomes, such as receiving rewards or incentives."
"Response: 
B - Timmy went to the driving range the day of competition. 
Explanation:  In this story, Timmy did not practice shooting 3 pointers all weekend. Instead, he went to the driving range on the day of the competition. This suggests that Timmy may not be as prepared for the competition as he thought, which makes option B more likely than option A."
"Response: 
B: Drake told the host he wanted to attend his parties again. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it seems unlikely that the host would admit to stealing Drake's wallet. It's more plausible that they might deny any knowledge of it (option A). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Bob drove his truck to the market. 
Explanation: The story states that Bob has never changed a tire before, which suggests he may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to change it successfully. It is more likely that he would drive his truck to the market to get help from someone who can change the tire for him."
"Response: 
Option A: Now Jack actually enjoys replying to emails. 
Explanation: In this story, Jack's decision to buy a new laptop was motivated by his desire to make emailing easier and more enjoyable for him. Therefore, after purchasing the laptop, he would likely find that he enjoys replying to emails even more than before. Option B is not a plausible outcome because there is no reason why Jack would suddenly start using the postal service instead of email."
"Response: 
B - Jake got the job."
"Response: 
B: I was really pleased.
Explanation: The story states that Sean, Sam, and the narrator played games together, but when they started to lose, they told the narrator he couldn't play anymore because of his poor performance. This implies that the narrator was happy to be included in the game and enjoyed playing with his friends, even if he wasn't very good at it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Sarah's letter was soon heading to its destination."
"Response: 
B) He then felt compelled to get back to work. 
Explanation: The story states that Chuck was ""tired from working"" and wanted a break, but after chatting on the forum, he felt ""compelled to get back to work."" This suggests that he will return to work rather than quitting."
"Response: 
Option B: Bob continued to use his plastic grocery bags to go shopping. 
Explanation: The story states that Bob's friend told him that plastic is bad for the environment, but it does not say that Bob actually changed his behavior. Therefore, it is more likely that Bob continued to use his plastic grocery bags to go shopping."
"Response: 
B - The artist painted a picture of Joe's cat instead of a portrait of Joe."
"Response: 
B: Ann was able to quit smoking successfully. 
Explanation: The story states that Ann applied a nicotine patch to help her quit smoking, which suggests that she was successful in quitting. Option A is therefore unlikely as there is no indication that Ann increased her cigarette consumption despite attempting to quit."
"Response: 
B - The room was full of shelves of books that appealed to girls.
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that the room where Jen's aunt takes her is filled with books that are of interest to girls. The mention of ""shelves of books"" suggests a large collection of volumes, which is consistent with the idea of a well-stocked library or bookroom. Additionally, the fact that the room is specifically designated as a place for reading and relaxing further supports this interpretation. Option A, on the other hand, is less plausible because there is no indication in the text that Jen's books were actually burning in the fireplace."
"Response: 
B) Rob was bummed when the cute nurse wasn't in that day.
Explanation: The story states that Rob is normally afraid of dentists, but he was excited to go because of a new nurse at the office. This implies that Rob finds the nurses attractive and is therefore more motivated to visit the dentist when one of them is present. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Joe decided not to eat dirt again. 
Explanation: Based on the story, it's clear that Joe enjoyed eating dirt and making mud pies. However, after biting down on a rock and losing a tooth, he decides not to eat dirt again. This choice makes sense given the consequences of his actions and the pain he experienced from biting down on the rock. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Joe's situation."
"Response: 
B: Rob's friends were thoughtless. 
Explanation:  The story states that Rob's friends offered him a free ticket, but it doesn't say they asked if he wanted to go or if he was interested in going. It also says they made him wait in a long line without asking how he felt about it. This suggests that Rob's friends didn't consider his feelings before inviting him along, which makes them thoughtless."
"Response: 
B) Carly ordered take-out over the phone."
"Response: 
B) Amy walked out of the room and left the house. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Amy's loved ones surprising her with a party after she initially felt ignored would not have changed her initial decision to leave the house. Her feelings of hurt and abandonment were too strong for such a surprise to make a difference. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome in this situation."
"Response: 
B - I gave Pan a big hug. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Pan was angry with the protagonist without any clear reason, and continued to attack them despite being defensive. This behavior is not consistent with someone who wants to hurt or harm another person, but rather with someone who is acting out of frustration or anger. Giving Pan a big hug would be an appropriate response in this situation as it would help to calm her down and show empathy towards her feelings."
"Response: 
B: Becky is proud of Ashley. 
Explanation:  The passage states that Ashley ""started being stupid"" after growing up, which suggests that she may have made some mistakes or poor choices in life. However, it also says that Ashley went to jail for stealing tampons from a dollar store, which implies that she may have been struggling financially or otherwise. Given these details, it's possible that Becky could feel proud of Ashley for finding a way to make ends meet despite her difficulties, rather than viewing her as ""stupid."""
"Response: 
B: One night, Pam decided to release the dogs. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Pam has had enough of the constant barking from their neighbor's dog and decides to take matters into her own hands by releasing the dog. This option is more likely than Option A because it aligns with Pam's frustration and desire for relief from the constant noise."
"Response: 
B) She even liked all of her professors. 
Explanation: The story states that May ""explored the campus"" and ""loved everything she saw,"" which suggests that she had a positive experience at the school. It is unlikely that she would drop out or not like any of her professors, given this context. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B) Mary left the dentist in a great mood. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Mary's fear of being awake during the procedure is so strong that she becomes upset when the dentist can only provide local anesthesia to numb the area. However, since she still needs to have her teeth pulled, she has no choice but to go through with the procedure. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, as Mary leaves the dentist's office in a good mood despite her initial reservations."
"Response: 
B: Ford was proud of his accomplishments. 
Explanation: In this story, Ford is described as working hard to achieve a high GPA, despite warnings from his friends that he is missing out on fun. This suggests that Ford values academic success and is willing to make sacrifices for it. The fact that he becomes a successful lawyer later in life further supports this interpretation, as lawyers are often highly educated and skilled professionals. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Ford's character."
"Response: 
B - I am unmarried.
Explanation: The narrator admits that his wife has said he lacks passion, which suggests they are married. If he were unmarried, there would be no need for him to defend himself against this criticism from a romantic partner. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
B - Nina was excited"
"Response: 
B) Veronika decides to visit the tree house more often. 
Explanation: The story states that Veronika ""was amazed"" by the tree house, which suggests that she enjoyed finding it and exploring its contents. Additionally, the fact that the tree house was ""fully furnished"" implies that it was well-equipped for visitors, which could encourage Veronika to return again in the future. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B) Tracey shrugged off her fall. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Tracey is an active and adventurous person who enjoys exploring nature. When she trips and falls, she quickly gets up without any injuries or difficulties. This suggests that she is fit and agile, and able to handle minor setbacks like falling without getting hurt. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - He decided to go for a run. 
Explanation:  In this situation, Bob doesn't have any money to buy a soda, so he decides to go for a run to try and earn some money by running errands or doing chores for people in his neighborhood. This option is more likely than Option A because it shows that Bob is proactive and resourceful in finding a solution to his problem rather than simply giving up and leaving the gas station without trying anything else."
"Response: 
B) Jim drove away before his wife showed. 
Explanation: The story states that Jim was ""very bored"" while he waited for his wife, which suggests that he may have been eagerly anticipating her arrival. However, instead of staying put, he decides to leave. This decision makes it more likely that option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: Joe decided he didn't want to go to college. 
Explanation: The story states that Joe was ""disappointed"" when he was placed on the waiting list for Columbia University. This suggests that he had high hopes for attending the university and was looking forward to the opportunity. However, after being rejected, Joe decides he doesn't want to go to college at all. This outcome is more likely than Option A, which implies that Joe remains proud of his hard work despite not getting accepted to Columbia."
"Response:  Option A: Gina checked on eBay and found one she could afford. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Gina is looking for something that she wants (a Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper) but doesn't have access to it directly. She decides to search online for an affordable option, which is a common practice when people can't find what they want locally or within their budget. This choice aligns with Gina's practical and resourceful personality traits, as well as her desire to obtain the item without relying on others for assistance."
"Response: 
B - Leah chastised her cat. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Leah returns home from the store to find that her Christmas tree has been knocked over by her mischievous cat. Rather than deciding she likes the tree on the floor better, Leah is likely to be upset with her cat for destroying her decorations. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Peter let his dog use the chair for itself. 
Explanation: The story states that the chair was ""becoming worn out,"" which suggests that it has been in use for some time. Additionally, the fact that Peter decides to buy a new, more comfortable chair implies that he has grown accustomed to using the old chair. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as Peter would allow his dog to use the new chair instead of continuing to use the old one himself."
"Response: 
B - Everyone enjoyed the cheese and bread. 
Explanation: The story states that Rex ran out to buy a baguette specifically so that his guests could have something to eat with the cheese, indicating that he was preparing for them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) She missed her stop and had to take a bus home. 
Explanation: The story states that Ali ""got on the train"" and ""fell asleep,"" which suggests that she may have accidentally taken the wrong train or missed her stop. It's unlikely that she would be intentionally lazy, so option A (She was a lazy employee) is not the best choice. Option B (She missed her stop and had to take a bus home) is more plausible given the information provided in the story."
"Response: 
B - The crowd all stood up in their seats and applauded wildly. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the team has just scored a touchdown with only seconds remaining in the game, which means they have won the championship. The crowd would naturally erupt into cheers and applause at such an exciting moment, so option B is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
B: We loved the strong wind and lack of sleep.
Explanation: This option is more likely because it goes against what one might expect from the situation described. It's unusual for people to enjoy being unable to sleep or losing their internet connection, but some people may find the sound of strong winds relaxing or enjoyable."
"Response: 
B) Then her keyboard arrived in the mail."
"Response: 
B: Jon rejected the offer."
"Response: 
B) Julie punched her friend in the eye. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any indication that Julie would be happy about being given a job at the library. In fact, it suggests that Julie may have been surprised or even upset by the offer. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Amy thought the park was boring. 
Explanation: The story states that Amy sat patiently in the car waiting to arrive, which suggests that she was looking forward to the trip. However, when they arrived and Amy surveyed the park, she only waited in line for an hour to ride the largest roller coaster, which implies that she did not find it very exciting or thrilling. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Steve was upset. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Steve received a negative consequence (a ticket) for driving too fast, which would likely make him feel upset or disappointed. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
B - When she came home she fell asleep immediately, exhausted.
Explanation: The story states that the child ""had a blast"" at the party, indicating that they were energetic and excited afterward. It would be unlikely for them to fall asleep immediately upon returning home, especially if they were still buzzing from the excitement of the party. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: The public reaction to the book means Bob still goes hungry. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bob wrote a book about his struggles with poverty in order to raise funds for himself. However, even though the book became popular and generated significant income, it does not necessarily mean that Bob has enough money to afford food. It is possible that the income from the book may not be sufficient to cover all of his basic needs, especially if he lives in an area where the cost of living is high or if he faces other financial challenges. Therefore, option B is the more realistic outcome in this situation."
"Response: 
B: I'm really disappointed in myself.
Explanation: The person has just completed their first marathon, which is a significant achievement that requires dedication and hard work. However, they are feeling disappointed in themselves instead of happy or proud. This suggests that they may have had high expectations for themselves before the race, perhaps setting a personal best time or finishing within a certain time frame, and did not meet those expectations. As a result, they feel let down or dissatisfied with their performance."
"Response: 
Option A: Bobby was five years old. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Bobby is folding a fruit roll-up into the shape of an airplane and throwing it, which are actions commonly associated with young children. Additionally, the fact that Bobby decides that planes should be made out of paper suggests that he lacks experience or knowledge in engineering or design, which is also typical for a child's thinking. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B - Sam's dad was glad his son was interested in geology."
"Response: 
B - He asked her to marry him. 
Explanation: The story states that John loves Meg and wants to marry her, which suggests that he has positive feelings towards her. Additionally, the context of the scene (walking out of a movie date) implies a romantic atmosphere, making it more likely that John will propose marriage rather than shout obscenities at Meg."
"Response: 
B) Bobby went into the shed to get a ladder to get the bananas."
"Response:  Option A: Beth needed to rest. 
Explanation: The story states that Beth was recovering from an illness, which means she needed to rest in order to fully recover. Taking a day off from school to rest and heal is a logical choice for someone who has been sick. It does not make sense for Beth to play football on her day off when she is still feeling unwell."
"Response: 
B - Sadly, they were ruined and Rhonda had to buy a new pair. "
"Response: 
B) Marcus then vomited from sea sickness.
Explanation: The context of the story suggests that Marcus is feeling unwell due to the rough seas, which makes sense given that he is experiencing motion sickness. Option A does not fit with the narrative as there is no indication that Marcus would be happy or excited about the situation. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Marcus in this scenario."
Response:  Option A: She cuddled with the adorable puppy, happy to see it.
"Response: 
B) Chuck was happy that place finally closed down.
Explanation: The story states that Chuck ""noticed it was closed"" which implies that he was not surprised or saddened by its closure, but rather relieved or happy about it. This suggests that Chuck may have had negative experiences at the bar in the past, such as poor service or unpleasant interactions with staff, and therefore welcomes its closure."
"Response: 
B - While thinking, Steve came up with an idea for a novel. 
Explanation: The passage states that Steve had no book to read while at the cafe, which means he had nothing else to occupy his mind except for thinking. Given this context, it's more likely that Steve would use the time to brainstorm ideas or come up with something creative, such as an idea for a novel. Option A does not fit well with the given scenario since completing a crossword puzzle quickly is not a significant accomplishment compared to coming up with a new creative idea."
"Response: 
B: The officer was understanding.  
Explanation: In this scenario, John made an honest mistake by forgetting his wallet. When he pulled over, he explained the situation to the officer without becoming confrontational or aggressive. Since the officer could verify John's identity through other means (e.g., his vehicle registration), there was no need for physical force or violence. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of this story."
"Response: 
B: Tom was upset that he did poorly. 
Explanation: The story states that Tom ""exited the escape room in record time,"" which suggests that he completed it quickly and efficiently. However, the fact that he was ""upset"" implies that he did not perform as well as he had hoped or expected. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Tom's experience in the escape room."
Response:  Option A: She enjoyed the song.
"Response: 
B - The janitor was frightened.
Explanation: In this story, the roof of the school buckles under the weight of the snow, causing it to shake violently. When the janitor climbs onto the roof to inspect, he must feel the weight of the snow pressing down upon him, which would be a frightening experience. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B: It was the best birthday party ever."
"Response: 
B) It smelled so good that I ate it."
"Response: 
B: I have no memory of going to Paragon Park. 
Explanation: The passage describes a specific event that occurred in 1963, but the speaker does not remember it. This suggests that they were too young at the time or that the event did not have a significant impact on their life. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option A: One day, I decided to buy the movie. 
Explanation: The speaker's love for the movie suggests that they have seen it multiple times before deciding to own a copy of it. This aligns with Option A, which states that the speaker decided to buy the movie after watching it numerous times as a child."
"Response: 
B - Mary Ann finished making her salad and enjoyed eating it. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Mary Ann ""passed by"" people, which implies that she was walking in a specific direction. It also mentions that she saw ""a lot of plants,"" which suggests that she was paying attention to her surroundings. However, there is no mention of any negative consequences or obstacles that might have prevented her from completing her task. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: The dog found him and mauled him. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that the dog will find the second cat and harm him than for them to become friends or for the cat to escape unharmed. The fact that the first cat doesn't mind the dog suggests that they may have already established a hierarchy, with the dog being subordinate to the cats. Additionally, the second cat's behavior of meowing loudly and scratching the dog's nose indicates that he feels threatened by the dog's presence, which could lead to an attack if the dog were to find him."
"Response: 
B: They gave me a book on the history of the computer.
Explanation: The story mentions that the speaker's favorite animal is the Arabian Oryx, which is actually an Asian species, not an African one. This suggests that the speaker may be more interested in technology than wildlife, making option B (a book on the history of the computer) the more likely gift from their family."
"Response: 
B - She played basketball with her friends all afternoon.
Explanation: The story states that the mother ""finally decided that it is her own responsibility,"" indicating that the daughter is old enough to take ownership of her tasks. It also mentions that the mother knows the daughter will get in trouble at school if she doesn't complete her homework, which suggests that the daughter has been struggling with this task for some time. Given these details, it is more likely that the daughter chose to play basketball with her friends instead of completing her homework, rather than earning a poor grade on the assignment."
"Response: 
B: The coach offered the boy the starting pitcher position. "
"Response: 
B) Sarah found spoiled milk on her desk."
"Response:

Option A: He agreed. 
Explanation: The story states that Terry agreed to get a job in order to receive the money for surgery. This suggests that he was willing to take steps to improve his situation, rather than relying solely on his sister's generosity. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B - Mary is sad she sold a car. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Mary has been struggling to meet her sales targets for a long time, and finally lands a big sale. However, instead of feeling relieved or proud of herself, she feels sad because she had to part with a valuable asset (the car). This suggests that Mary values her work more than just meeting her sales targets, and is invested in doing quality work rather than just hitting numbers."
Response:  Option A: Brie was glad they had become friends. 
"Response: 
B - Tim returned the tiles to the store the next day.

Response:  Option B: Dave took control of the helicopter and landed on the field.

Additionally, landing a helicopter on a football field without proper authorization and safety measures is illegal and could result in serious consequences.
"Response: 
B) They mourned for their losses.
Explanation: The fact that there are 199 grave stones in the cemetery suggests that many people have died, which would lead to mourning rather than rejoicing. Additionally, the presence of 12 men bringing a casket and putting it in the ground implies that someone has passed away, further supporting the idea that the group is mourning their loss."
"Response:  Option A: Joe eventually won the fight. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it's more likely that Joe would win the fight because he was able to overcome the injury from the left hook and continue fighting effectively. It's less likely that he would finish the fight without any cuts or injuries, as getting hit with a powerful punch can cause significant damage to a fighter's body."
"Response: 
B) Jimmy ate another chip from the bag. 
Explanation: The story states that Jimmy was eating chips as he left the house, so it's likely that he would continue to eat more chips even after realizing there were ants crawling on the bag."
"Response: 
B: My son was happy that we won. 
Explanation: The story states that ""We designed a simple car, which actually won the derby."" This implies that the father-son team's entry performed well in the competition, and therefore my son was likely happy about their victory.

"Response: 
Option A: He eventually made the team. 
Explanation: In this story, Brian worked hard on improving his speed skating after being told by the coach that it was an area of weakness. This suggests that he was determined to improve and ultimately succeeded in making the team. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Kelly was able to ski uphill on the avalanche.
Explanation: In this scenario, Kelly's quick reaction and ability to ski fast enough allowed her to ride the avalanche uphill instead of being buried under it. This outcome is more plausible than Option A, where Kelly would have been unable to escape the avalanche by clinging to a single tree."
"Response:  Option B: Harry really liked the movie. 
Explanation: The story states that Harry bought a ticket for himself and watched the entire movie, indicating that he enjoyed it. It does not mention anything about him wanting to see the movie with his friends. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."

B - He realized he would fit in perfectly at the new job.  
Explanation: The story states that Mark was greeted warmly by many people when he entered the building, indicating a positive atmosphere. This suggests that Mark will have an easy time fitting in with his coworkers, making option B the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Ellen felt really calm. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's unlikely that Ellen would feel horribly afraid (option A). Instead, she might be in shock or disbelief at what has happened, but still manage to remain relatively calm and composed. This is because, as a parent, Ellen may have been trained to handle emergency situations involving her child, such as CPR or calling for help. Additionally, she may have faith in the medical system and believe that the authorities will arrive quickly and provide appropriate assistance."
"Response: 
B: Pearl's sister was seeking revenge. 
Explanation:  The fact that Pearl's sister stole the CD while angry with her suggests that she may have been motivated by a desire for revenge rather than an attempt to please her. This option better aligns with the emotions expressed in the passage, where Pearl's heart sinks upon realizing her sister has taken the CD without her permission."

"Response: 
B - They went back to eat at the same restaurant. 
Explanation:  The story states that Simon and his friend were both sick with food poisoning after eating at different restaurants they had visited together. This suggests that they did not identify a specific restaurant as the source of their illness, but rather continued to experience symptoms after eating at various places. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Arnold screamed in terror! 
Explanation: The story states that Arnold was scared of birds, which suggests that he might have a fear response when encountering one unexpectedly, such as screaming in terror. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A."
Response:  Option A: Adam took the gun away from Christian.  This is because it is not appropriate or safe for a child to handle a weapon like a BB gun without proper supervision and safety precautions. It is important for parents to teach their children about gun safety and to keep weapons out of reach of young children to prevent accidents or injuries.
"Response: 
B: Kip dreamed of snowflakes.
Explanation: The story states that Kip ""stomped"" his way to his room, indicating that he was upset and frustrated about not having snow for Christmas.

"Response: 
B) I was so happy.
Explanation: The story states ""I was so happy"" which suggests that finding the dead animal in the box was not a negative experience for the narrator.

Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B) She broke up with Sam, leaving him heartbroken.
Explanation: The story implies that Sam and Karen are in a romantic relationship, and that they have been apart for some time due to Karen going away for school. When Sam takes the train to visit Karen, it suggests that he is eager to see her and spend time together. However, the story also mentions that Karen has a plan to ""fix"" things, which could imply that she has been feeling distant or disconnected from Sam despite their longing for each other. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as it suggests that Karen decides to break up with Sam, causing him to be left heartbroken."
"Response: 
B) Then he roasted marshmallows.

"Response: 
B - She threw up in the toilet."
"Response: 
B - Jason's best friend was not impressed.
Explanation: The story states that Jason's best friend is getting married in India next year, which implies that his best friend is Indian or has connections to India. If this is the case, it is unlikely that Jason's best friend would be unimpressed by Jason's ability to speak Hindi, as it would be a common language for them to communicate with each other. Instead, it is more likely that Jason's best friend would appreciate Jason's effort to learn their native language."
"Response: 
B) She decided not to speak to Todd either. 
Explanation: The correct answer is (B) She decided not to speak to Todd either. This option best fits the situation described in the story, as it explains why Ashley became upset when Todd gave her the silent treatment.

Response:  Option B: They gave all the hamburgers to passerby. 
"Response: 
B: This proves girls tell the truth all the time.
Explanation: The speaker in the story believes that girls lie, so it is unlikely that the girl who said she was rich actually meant it. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 
B - School was cancelled.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that school would be cancelled due to the severe weather conditions. Three feet of snow falling over several hours would make travel dangerous and impassable, making it difficult or impossible for students and staff to get to school safely."
"Response: 
B - Larry was excited to have scored his first hole-in-one. 
Explanation: The story states that Larry was feeling energized after drinking coffee, which suggests that he had plenty of energy to play golf well. Additionally, the fact that he scored a hole-in-one implies that he played well and did something impressive, so it's more likely that he would be excited rather than upset about his score."
"Response: 
B) She is very happy no one gave her gifts. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Candy has low self-esteem or a distorted view of herself, as she feels sad and ignored when no one gives her gifts on her birthday. This could indicate that she places too much importance on external validation from others rather than finding happiness within herself. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, where Candy is happy no one gave her gifts, which reinforces this unhealthy mindset."

B: Nya was excited to be able to watch the parade."
"Response: 
B) Madeline's mother happily bought the bag for her. "
"Response: 
B - Tom closed his windows to block out as much sunlight as possible. 
Explanation: In this story, Tom's mother tells him that the plant needs sunlight to grow. However, instead of moving the plant to a window where it can get more light, Tom decides to close his windows to block out as much sunlight as possible. This choice is unlikely because it would prevent the plant from getting the light it needs to grow."
"Response: 
B: Ranger fans are looking forward to his return. 
Explanation: The story states that Yu Darvish is finally healthy and able to play after being injured for the last two seasons. This means that he will be returning to the team and playing again, which is good news for Ranger fans who were hoping to see him lead their pitching staff.

"Response:

"Response: 
B: Gina was glad she had wasted her day. 
Explanation: The story states that Gina ""realized she needed to get to work on her report"" which implies that she has been procrastinating or not making progress on the task, and now she needs to make up for lost time.

Additionally, the phrase ""he thought college was going to be miserable"" implies a negative attitude on John's part, which could foreshadow problems ahead."
"Response: 
B - She was glad she is never bored of music. 
Explanation: Jackie has been a long-distance runner for several years and has become accustomed to listening to music during her runs. When her friend suggested an audiobook, she was hesitant because she enjoys music too much. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option B: She turned on the stove and made herself dinner.  This option is more likely because it would be unusual for someone who was scared of a haunted house to turn on the stove and make themselves dinner, especially if they were alone in the house. It would be more logical for them to try to find a way out or seek comfort from someone else rather than cooking something to eat.
"Response: 
B) Sam was unhappy."
"Response:  Option B: They all freaked out naturally. 
Explanation: The story implies that the friends were not experienced with using a Ouija board and did not take it seriously. Therefore, when they heard the strange banging sound after playing with it, they would probably be scared and freak out naturally."

B - By the time she got home, it had become warmer due to spring. 
Explanation: The story states that Jan was tired of winter and cold weather, indicating that it is currently winter or at least cooler temperatures.

"Response: 
B - The girl cried hysterically. 
Explanation:  It is more likely that the girl would cry hysterically if she was unexpectedly approached by someone she didn't know, especially if she wasn't interested in him. This reaction is common when people are put on the spot or feel uncomfortable with an unexpected proposal."
"Response: 
B: She boarded her flight just in time. 
Explanation: The story states that Amy heard her name being called over the speaker at her gate, indicating that she made it onto the flight just in time. If she had been too late, she would not have been able to board the flight. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Ana was extremely sunburned. 
Explanation: The story states that Ana ""woke up"" after dozing off, which implies that she spent a significant amount of time under the hot sun without any protection. This would result in severe sunburn, not paleness."
"Response: 
B: Paul was very pleased with his results. 
Explanation: In this story, Paul faces rejection from both the Army and the Navy despite his attempts to join them. However, instead of becoming discouraged or frustrated, Paul remains determined and continues to try different paths until he finds one that works for him. This shows resilience and determination, which are positive qualities. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Paul in this scenario."
"Response: 
B - The cat decided to lay down and take a nap. 
Explanation: In this story, the cat is described as being ""terried"" which means they are scared or intimidated. This suggests that the cat may not be able to catch their prey, leading them to become tired and decide to rest instead of continuing to pursue the mouse. Therefore option B is the most likely outcome for this story."
"Response: 
Option A: Neil found the trip stimulating."
"Response: 
B) Mary felt unappreciated. 
Explanation:  Mary enjoyed making candles as a hobby, but when she gave one to her friend as a gift and everyone else liked it and wanted to buy one, Mary may have felt overwhelmed or resentful that her friends were not appreciating her hard work and time spent on each candle. It's possible that she felt undervalued or taken for granted, which could lead to feelings of frustration or disappointment."
"Response:  Option B: Gina disliked spending time with her sister. 
Explanation: The story states that Gina and her sister were ""bored"" which implies they are not necessarily enjoying each other's company, and option B better captures this sentiment as it suggests that Gina does not enjoy spending time with her sister."
"Response: 
B: My plans were ruined, and I went home.
Explanation: The story states that the speaker ""came out of the dressing room"" after getting ready for the beach, which implies that they had already changed into their swimsuit. If it started raining, it would not be possible for them to go swimming or enjoy the sunshine. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Arnold dumped his girlfriend. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Arnold would dump his girlfriend rather than loving her cats. The fact that he is scared of cats suggests that he may not be comfortable around them, and this could potentially create tension in a relationship with someone who owns a cat. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B - Leah gets the job.
Explanation: The story provides no indications that Leah would be fired, such as poor performance during the interview or lack of qualifications for the job. Instead, it suggests that she did well during the interview and was offered the position, making option B the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Because I'm a cheapskate it suited me well. 
Explanation: The speaker mentions that they are getting gifts for their cousins, but then says ""Thankfully I found out they had a sale.""

"Response: 
B: I began to tremble uncontrollably with terror and dread."
"Response: 
B - The bat.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that the bat was the object that Maggie's cat brought into her room than that the cat was dead. The fact that the cat brings an object into the room suggests that it may have caught or found something while outside, which in this case would be the bat."
"Response: 
B: Joe was pleased when he put up the new blinds."
"Response: 
A: Joey knew everybody was just teasing him. 
Explanation: In this story, Joey's uncle shows him a marble and teases him by saying it's his glass eye. Later, when Joey plays marbles with his friends, one of them says their marble is a ""cat's eye."" This is likely a joke or a way for the other boys to try to get the upper hand in the game. Since Joey already knows that his uncle was teasing him about having a glass eye, he is unlikely to be fooled by his friends' claim that their marble is also a special kind of stone. Therefore, option A is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B) They then played heads down thumbs up.
Explanation: The story mentions that the teacher instructed the students to hide under their desks after the gunshots rang out. This suggests that the students were in a state of panic and confusion, and may not have been thinking clearly enough to play a game like ""heads down thumbs up.""

Explanation: Based on the details provided in the story, it seems that the narrator had a negative experience during their camping trip. They mention several mishaps, including their car breaking down, burning their hand while cooking, falling into the lake, and being eaten by bugs. These events may have left the narrator with a bad impression of camping, leading them to decide never to go camping again. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: I was sure I would get an A if I didn’t turn in my essay."
"Response: 
B: Sally hopes her boss will keep her. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems more likely that Sally wants to keep her job rather than lose it.

"Response: 
B) We decided to sell our candy to a local boutique. 
Explanation: The story states that the protagonists ""realized they had greatly overestimated"" how difficult making candy was, which suggests that their initial enthusiasm for the project may have been misplaced. However, rather than giving up or becoming discouraged, they decide to take their homemade candy to market by selling it to a local boutique. This outcome is more likely because it shows the characters taking action to turn their failed experiment into something successful and profitable."

Explanation: In this scenario, Emily's parents are supportive of their child's behavior and encourage her to express herself freely, even if it means being disruptive or resisting medical procedures.

By cheering Emily on, they are showing her that they understand and respect her feelings while still encouraging her to follow proper medical protocols."
"Response: 
B - We put the gear away and went our separate ways.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that suggests the group continued playing after sunset, so option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Option B: I decided to quit using the computer.  This option is most likely because if the speaker could not find an affordable replacement for their broken mouse, they may have chosen to stop using the computer altogether rather than continue to use it with a malfunctioning input device.
"Response: 
B - It was better for Samantha to be late than to be unprepared. "
"Response: 
B) I thought Jack was very rude.
Explanation: In this situation, you collided with another skier and fell to the ground.

"Response: 
B: Joline decided to take the technician's advice."
"Response: 
B) Harry was so happy to be in the goo. 
Explanation: Based on the story, it seems that Harry has a fear of haunted houses, but he still goes through with the activity because he doesn't want to disappoint his friend. When they fall through the trick floor, Harry is surprised and delighted to find himself in a pile of goo. This suggests that he was actually looking forward to the experience despite his initial reservations, and therefore option B is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
The correct answer is (B) He retired early due to injury. This option best fits the information provided in the story, as it explains why Bobby stopped wrestling professionally at an earlier age than expected. The other option, (A), does not align with the narrative given that there is no indication of Bobby losing interest in wrestling or stopping altogether."
"Response: 
B: Joan went to the restaurant the next night. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Joan was unhappy with her dining experience at the sushi restaurant. Rather than simply leaving without paying, which might have been seen as rude or disrespectful, Joan chose to return to the restaurant the next night to speak with the manager directly and express her concerns. This suggests that Joan is willing to take action to address her issues and seek resolution, rather than simply accepting poor service and leaving without consequence."
"Response: 
B: Jesse's parents were excited to see the tattoo. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Jesse's decision to get a tattoo goes against what her parents want for her. However, instead of being upset or angry about it, they are actually excited to see the tattoo that their daughter has gotten. This could be because they have accepted that Jesse is an adult now and can make her own decisions, or maybe they just want to see how their child will express herself through body art. Either way, option B is the more likely outcome in this situation."
"Response: 
B - Juliette was bored.
Explanation: The story states that Juliette ""emptied a box of baking soda into a pan"" and then ""poured in vinegar."" This suggests that she may have been attempting to create a homemade volcano, but since there is no further detail about the reaction or any observation made by Juliette, it is more likely that she was simply bored and playing around with household items rather than conducting a scientific experiment."
"Response: 
B: Rob was very happy about spending time with Jaclyn. 
Explanation: The story states that Rob ""tried very nice to keep the peace"" and be nice, indicating that he wants to maintain a good relationship with Jaclyn despite their differences. Additionally, the fact that Jaclyn made snide comments and remarks suggests that she may have been trying to provoke or upset Rob, but he remained calm and friendly towards her. Therefore, it is more likely that Rob was happy to spend time with Jaclyn despite any tension between them."
"Response: 
B: Sharon broke all of the eggs.
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that Sharon would break all of the eggs when she trips and falls while carrying them.

Option A is less plausible because there is no indication that the eggs would land safely without any damage."
"Response: 
B: The slave trader became very famous and rich from his song. 
Explanation: Although the slave trader had converted to Christianity, he was still known for his past actions as a slave trader. As such, it would be unlikely that people would embrace him or his music without reservation. Instead, his fame and wealth from the song would likely come from the irony of someone who was once involved in a morally reprehensible industry now using their talents to spread a message of redemption and forgiveness."
"Response: 
B - Ella was unscathed from the fall."
"Response: 
B) She felt like a complete failure.
Explanation: The story states that Steph lost weight by eating simpler food and smaller portions, but it does not mention anything about her feeling happy or successful with her weight loss. In fact, the story implies that Steph feels like a failure because she was able to lose weight despite having less time to prepare meals. This suggests that the emotional impact of weight loss can be complex and nuanced, and may not always align with physical changes."
"Response: 
The correct answer is (B) Bobby took time to recover from the injury. This is because injuries can take time to heal, and it's unlikely that Bobby would continue playing without proper medical attention."
"Response: 
B) Susan was very happy with the experience. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Susan's use of her cell phone in the theater led to an inconvenience for her (being asked to leave by an usher), but she remained calm and patient throughout the situation. This suggests that she was able to handle the unexpected turn of events in a positive manner, which would make her happy with the overall experience."
"Response: 
Option A: The cactus flourished under his care."
Response:  Option B: Gina decided that it wasn't late enough and went back outside.  This option is more likely because people often feel like they haven't had enough time to enjoy themselves when they are outdoors, especially in the evening. It is also possible that Gina wanted to prolong her time at the park or explore other areas of the city after dark.
Response:  Option A: Avery's parents were proud. 
"Response: 
B - The orchids would be beautiful. 
Explanation: In this story, Gary loves gardening and wants to start planting, so it's likely that he will choose plants that are attractive and will thrive in his garden. Orchids are known for their beauty and fragrance, making them a good choice for a gardener like Gary who wants to create a visually appealing garden. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
Response:  Option B: And he started laughing hysterically. This option is more likely because it would be unexpected for someone's boyfriend to suddenly start laughing uncontrollably after asking them to marry him, especially if they were already in a serious relationship. It would also create an awkward moment for Bay, as she would not know how to react to such an unusual response from her partner.
"Response: 
B: Tommy had bad friends. 
Explanation: The fact that Tommy's friends tried to cheer him up by taking him out, despite his initial reluctance, suggests that they may not have been very supportive or caring towards him. Additionally, the fact that he ended up drinking and dancing with them all night implies that he may have felt pressured or coerced into doing things he didn't want to do. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
B: We had a week of hell as her tooth came in. 
Explanation: The story states that Ariel was ""extremely fussy"" and they couldn't figure out why, but later they noticed a fresh tooth coming in. This suggests that the tooth coming in caused discomfort for Ariel, leading to her being fussy. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Amelia decided to vacation to Mexico more often. 
Explanation: The story states that Amelia ""loved every moment"" of her trip to Mexico, which suggests that she had a positive experience. It is unlikely that she would decide not to return to Mexico after having such a good time there. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B: We told the kids it was Thanksgiving.
Explanation: The story mentions leaving cookies and milk for Santa on Christmas Eve, which suggests that the holiday being referred to is Christmas. When the children ask if Santa is real, the parents respond by saying they think he must have shared the cookies with the reindeer (option A). However, this explanation doesn't make sense given the context of the story, as the children are asking about Christmas rather than a different holiday. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) She did not want to eat."
"Response: 
Option B: Kids suffered from the computer labs. 
Explanation: While the creation of a computer lab may seem like a positive development, it can also have negative consequences if not implemented properly. For example, excessive screen time can lead to eye strain, headaches, and poor posture in children. Additionally, over-reliance on technology can hinder critical thinking skills and social interaction. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - I won the match"
"Response: 
The answer is (B) The kid is very proud of himself.  
Explanation: In this scenario, Ben is the coach of a basketball team and he had to cut one player during tryouts. Despite feeling bad about letting the player down, Ben takes the time to give the player constructive feedback and encourages them to continue working hard in order to improve their skills for next season. It's unlikely that the player would practice all year only to make the team the following year if they were cut during tryouts, so option A is not the most likely outcome. Instead, it's more likely that the player would feel proud of themselves for putting in effort and trying their best, even if they didn't make the team this time around."
"Response: 
B: Officer Dunn was shocked about what his dog had done. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it is unlikely that the baby would have petted the dog immediately after being bitten. It is more plausible that Officer Dunn would be surprised and upset by the actions of his dog, as he did not intend for harm to come to anyone."
"Response: 
B - He made the best sandwich in town."
"Response: 
B - Changed the Wi-Fi password.
Explanation: The story mentions nothing about cleaning a motorcycle or changing a Wi-Fi password. It only describes driving a motorcycle on a track and then returning home, which suggests that the protagonist may have been bored with their activity and decided to change something else instead. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
B - Ryan got promoted.
Explanation: The story does not suggest that Ryan getting fired for skipping work would be a plausible outcome. Instead, it implies that he may have been rewarded for taking time off to enjoy himself with his friend, as evidenced by him being seen by his boss in a positive light (i.e., ""left the park and saw Ryan's boss""). This suggests that Ryan may have received some form of recognition or advancement at work, which could lead to him getting promoted rather than fired."
"Response: 
B - The man kept driving for a few more hours. 
Explanation: 
The story does not provide any information that would suggest the man stopped at the rest stop. In fact, it explicitly states that he ""took the exit for the rest stop,"" which implies that he continued driving after passing the rest stop. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Josiah rolled over and played with his feet."
"Response: 
B) I drove home with the mini pig in my car.
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist ""went to pick [the mini pig] up."" This implies that they actually picked up the animal rather than bringing a dog home. Additionally, the fact that the protagonist already has multiple dogs suggests that it would be unlikely for them to bring another dog home as well. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B) His classmates taught him to overcome his fear of heights. 
Explanation: In this story, Sam's classmates are not supportive in terms of helping him overcome his fear of singing in front of others. Instead, they teach him how to overcome his fear of heights, which has no relevance to the original scenario. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Matt was miserable at the turn of events.
Explanation: The story states that Matt has a big crush on Lexy, but is too afraid to ask her out. When he finally musters up the courage to do so, it's likely that he will feel nervous or anxious about how she will react. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome as Matt may feel disappointed or unhappy with himself for not being able to gather enough confidence to approach Lexy earlier."
"Response: 
B: Shyanne was overjoyed."
"Response: 
B) John devoured his pizza."
"Response: 
B - He received many awards for his dance performances. 
Explanation: The story states that the judges were impressed with Jill's performance, which suggests that he did well in the audition. It is unlikely that the judges would forget about him or not give him any recognition after being so impressed. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) We ran in hopes of improving our speed. 
Explanation: The story mentions that the characters tried to stay up late, which implies that they were trying to do something productive or fun. Running laps around the couch suggests that they were attempting to be more active, rather than just passing out from exhaustion. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - So she bought a new cell phone."
"Response: 
B) I carelessly threw my used Kleenix in the gutter. 
Explanation: The story states that you took your bicycle to the store instead of walking, which suggests that you are not paying close attention to details or being careful about how you handle your belongings. Throwing away something as important as a used tissue without properly disposing of it further supports this conclusion. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - They couldn't wait to see Grandma!
Explanation: Based on the context provided, it seems that the family is eagerly anticipating seeing their grandmother after a long drive. Option A suggests that they might decide to turn back, which doesn't align with their excitement and eagerness to reach their destination. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  Option A: Ana decided never to wait that long again.
"Response: 
B: Mark has a court date next week. 
Explanation: 
The story states that Mark was caught by someone working at the mall, which implies that Mark will face legal consequences for his actions. Going to court is a common outcome for individuals who commit crimes like shoplifting, so it is the most likely option in this scenario. Option A is unlikely because workers at stores typically do not thank customers for shoplifting or any other illegal activity."
Response:  Option B: But in a moment, I'm going to start the puzzle.  This option best completes the story because it aligns with the speaker's previous statement about not having time to open the gift yet despite their intention to do so. It also provides a clear contrast to the speaker's current activity of talking with the listener, which suggests that they have not started the puzzle yet.
"Response: 
B) He feels better about his room.
Explanation: The story states that Rex hasn't cleaned his room in years, indicating that he doesn't have a strong preference for cleaning. Therefore, option A (Rex loves cleaning the bathroom) is unlikely. Option B (He feels better about his room) is more plausible because it aligns with the narrative of Rex finally taking the initiative to tidy up his space after neglecting it for so long."
"Response: 
B: I failed my exam. 
Explanation: The story states that the exam is tough, which suggests that it may be challenging for the protagonist to ace it. Additionally, skipping dinner to study may not have been an effective strategy, as it could have led to fatigue and decreased focus during the exam. Therefore, option B (the protagonist fails their exam) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - It was our favorite picture of the vacation. 
Explanation: The story states that the family wanted a group photo, and they asked a stranger to take it for them. This suggests that the photo was taken by someone who was not a member of their immediate family or close friends, but rather a random person they encountered during their trip. Since the story does not provide any information about how the photo turned out, it is unlikely that the background of the photo was particularly notable or memorable. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."
"Response: 
B - Wore the blue shirt"
"Response:  Option A: He fell asleep. 
Explanation: The story states that JJ was tired after playing all day and nearly fell asleep in his bath. This suggests that he will eventually fall asleep when his mother puts him in pajamas and sings to him. Therefore, option A is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: It was then that they knew they were in the right spot. 
Explanation: In this story, the appearance of the deer provides evidence that the hunters are indeed in the right location for hunting. This suggests that option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Todd decides to study as much as he can before tomorrow. 
Explanation:  The correct answer is option B because it aligns with human nature. When faced with an important task or responsibility, people tend to procrastinate unless they are motivated by external factors such as deadlines or consequences. In this case, Todd has waited until the last minute to prepare for the test, which suggests that he may not be motivated enough to study without some kind of push. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur in reality."
"Response:  Option B: Maggie wanted to be alone. 
Explanation: In this story, Maggie initially expresses a desire for a new friend but then ends up spending every day with her new friend. This suggests that Maggie may not have actually wanted a new friend after all, but rather was feeling lonely and sought out social interaction. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
B - When the ride was over, we parted ways. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that the speaker's roommate and they rode to work together, but when they arrived at their destination, they parted ways. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
Option B: She felt better playing with a group of nicer people.  
Explanation: In this scenario, Brittany joined an online community of other female gamers who were more supportive and respectful towards each other. This made it easier for her to enjoy playing video games without feeling harassed or bullied by others. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome in this situation."
"Response: 
B - Bobby enjoyed the carnival."
"Response: 
B: So I typed the lyrics into Google. 
Explanation: The speaker in the story wants to find out more about the song they heard, so they type the lyrics into Google to try to identify it. This option is therefore the most likely choice for the next step in the story."
"Response: 
B: Al felt even lonelier as time went on. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Al's grief over his sister's death has not yet subsided, and he feels increasingly lonely without her by his side. This aligns with the emotional response of someone who has lost a close loved one, where the initial shock and sadness can give way to feelings of isolation and emptiness in the days and weeks that follow."
"Response: 
B - I now drive at a normal speed. 
Explanation: The speaker mentions that they received three speeding tickets as a teenager, which suggests that they may have been driving recklessly or excessively fast in the past. However, the speaker also states that they now drive at a normal speed, indicating that they have learned their lesson and are no longer engaging in dangerous driving habits. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B - He has a great time in Oregon."
"Response: 
B) She couldn't wait to get her braces tightened each visit. 
Explanation: The story suggests that the person had a negative experience with getting braces, specifically feeling pain after each visit. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome as it implies that the person is eagerly anticipating the next time they can have their braces tightened, which may indicate a sense of relief or comfort rather than happiness."
"Response: 
B: Jayne decided to set fire to the garden and destroy the farm.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Jayne enjoyed helping with the farm or was satisfied with her experience. Instead, it implies that she may have had negative feelings towards the farm and its owner by mentioning that she ""helped"" care for the animals and harvest the vegetables, which could be interpreted as forced labor. Additionally, setting fire to the garden and destroying the farm is a destructive act that suggests Jayne may have been unhappy with her time at the farm. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: Seth thinks it is a good idea to update his resume. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Seth recognizes that he will need to look for new employment due to the factory closing. He decides to update his CV as part of his preparations for the job search. This choice makes sense given the situation because updating one's CV is an essential step when looking for work elsewhere. Option A is less plausible since Seth may not be able to discover another position within the same company where he has been employed for so long."
"Response: 
B: Amy then had to walk to school. 
Explanation: The story states that Amy's car stopped, which means she cannot drive it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as Amy will have to walk to school instead of driving."
"Response: 
B: Rod was proud of what he had done. 
Explanation: The fact that Rod's apartment caught on fire suggests that he may have been careless or reckless with his smoking habits, which could lead him to be proud of his actions rather than regretful or dead. Additionally, the fact that he fell asleep while watching TV suggests that he may not have been paying attention to his surroundings, further supporting the idea that he would be proud of his actions rather than regretful."
"Response: 
Option B: Barry turned around and went home. 
Explanation:  The fact that Barry had already decided who he was going to vote for suggests that he may not have been undecided or open-minded about the election. Therefore, it is more likely that he would turn around and go home rather than actually voting."
"Response: 
B) They fixed it and Johnny drove home. 
Explanation: The story states that Johnny had to put on the spare tire and drive to a repair shop, indicating that he did not fix the flat tire at the side of the road. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Amy signed a lease and moved into the apartment."
"Response:  Option B: I ate a hamburger. 
Explanation: The story does not mention any of the characters eating a hamburger, so option A (I got to eat the slice) is unlikely. Additionally, the story states that there was only one slice of pizza remaining, which suggests that the character would have been eager to eat it themselves rather than share it with their siblings. Therefore, option B (I ate a hamburger) is more plausible."
"Response: 
Option B: May went outside and Cathy never saw her again. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about May's behavior or personality before she left with Cathy. It only states that Cathy fell in love with May at first sight and applied to adopt her. Therefore, it is more likely that May went outside and disappeared without Cathy seeing her again."
"Response: 
B) Monica knit the scarf to donate to an orphanage."
"Response: 
B: No one seemed to notice the suspect. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the suspect has managed to open the locked cell door without being detected by anyone at the police station. It's unlikely that the suspect would decide to turn themselves in (option A) since they have already taken steps to escape. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
"Response: 
The most likely outcome for this story is Option A: But eventually they get together anyway. This is because the desire to be together and express one's love often overcomes any obstacles or challenges that may arise, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. It is also possible that the couple may find ways to navigate their differences and work towards a resolution that allows them to be together while still maintaining positive relationships with their parents. However, it is unlikely that the parents will be completely accepting of the relationship from the start, as conflicts of interest can be difficult to overcome."
"Response:  Option B: I was completely bored. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any details that would indicate excitement or enthusiasm from the speaker. In fact, it suggests the opposite - that they were ""completely bored"" by the experience. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
Response:  Option A: Jake had a great time at the football game with his dad.
"Response: 
B - I decided to visit Vegas. 
Explanation: The story mentions looking for something ""cheap"" to do, which suggests that the protagonist does not have a lot of money to spend on leisure activities. Visiting Las Vegas, known for its casinos and expensive shows, is unlikely to be a budget-friendly option. On the other hand, going swimming at a local lake beach is a more affordable activity. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: Amy got an A on the paper but in trouble for skipping class. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Amy's decision to skip class and work on her paper instead resulted in her receiving a good grade on the assignment, but also led to consequences such as getting in trouble for missing class. This outcome aligns with the idea that taking risks or making choices that go against expectations can have both positive and negative outcomes."
"Response: 
Option B: Steve's wife filed for divorce that same day.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Steve's wife was happy or appreciative of the gift. In fact, it implies the opposite by stating she ""filed for divorce that same day."" This suggests that Steve's attempt at surprising her with a thoughtful gift may have backfired, leading to conflict in their marriage rather than happiness."
"Response: 
B: As if his luck couldn't get any worse, the hospital was closed. 
Explanation: The story suggests that the man's bad luck is not just a coincidence but rather a series of unfortunate events that are happening one after another. Given this pattern, it is more likely that the hospital will be closed when he needs medical attention than for him to suddenly start having good luck."
"Response: 
B: Jon loved spending time with the kids.
Explanation: The story states that Jon's son sat down on the couch and leaned on Jon's arm, indicating that Jon enjoyed being around his children. It also mentions that Jon was tired and grumpy from work, which suggests that he values spending time with his family more than doing something for himself. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Ben went for a run."
Response:  Option B: Juan was very successful eventually. This option is more likely because it aligns with the common narrative of people pursuing their passions and working hard leading to success. It also fits with the idea of someone wanting to become something they are passionate about, like a luchador, and eventually achieving their goal through dedication and perseverance.
"Response: 
B - Tori had to go to therapy because she was so upset. 
Explanation:  It is unlikely that Tori would be so excited about being pregnant that she and her husband spent half an hour discussing baby names without any negative emotions or concerns. If Tori were truly overjoyed by the news, she might have been more focused on celebrating with her husband than thinking about naming their child. Instead, it seems more plausible that Tori would feel anxious or stressed about the pregnancy, leading her to seek support from a therapist."
"Response: 
Option B: The food was too unhealthy for Sara. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Sara is on a diet and is trying to eat healthily. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would be interested in visiting a bakery, which is known for selling sweet and fattening pastries. Instead, it makes more sense that a new healthy organic juice shop opening up nearby would appeal to her, as she could potentially find healthier alternatives to satisfy her cravings."
"Response: 
Option A: They decide to be lab partners in their class together. "
"Response: 
B - Disappointed to receive the Chemistry set.
Explanation: In this story, Tom wanted a Chemistry set for Christmas, but his mother initially refused, saying it was too dangerous for a little boy. However, when Tom asks for a puppy instead, his mother suddenly changes her mind and agrees to get him the Chemistry set. This suggests that Tom may have been looking forward to getting the Chemistry set and was disappointed when he ended up receiving it after all."
"Response: 
B - I shot the rat and tossed the body into the garbage."
"Response: 
B: Lo had the best costume in the play. 
Explanation: The story states that Lo's mother made the hoop skirt for her costume, implying that it turned out well and looked good on her. This suggests that Lo had the best costume in the play, which is option B."
"Response: 
B: Later, my manager told me he didn't like the Beatles.
Explanation: The story suggests that your manager and you bonded over your shared love for the Beatles. However, it's unlikely that someone would wear a Beatles t-shirt on their first day of work just to impress their new employee. It's more probable that your manager genuinely shares your interest in the band, but may not have been able to hide his true feelings if he didn't actually enjoy their music. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Tyler was elated!"
"Response: 
B - The dentist was able to make her tooth feel better. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that the dentist was able to help Flora's toothache than for her to be excited about going to the dentist. The story mentions that Flora hates the dentist, which suggests that she does not enjoy visiting them. However, since the toothache was causing her discomfort, it makes sense that she would seek medical attention from a professional who can provide relief. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Derek now reads all the time. 
Explanation: The story states that Derek got a library card, which means he has access to more books to read. This implies that he will continue reading regularly, as he now has more resources available to him. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B - After talking for hours, we decided to go to a restaurant."
"Response: 
B - Buying her a dress that afternoon.
Explanation: This option is more likely because it shows initiative and willingness to take action, which can be attractive to someone you're interested in. The other option (A) may come across as creepy or stalker-like, especially if the person doesn't want to engage with you."
"Response: 
B - Pat felt silly for pretending to be sick.
Explanation: The story states that Pat called in to work using a fake sick voice, which means he was lying about being sick. When he finds out that work has been cancelled due to snow, he realizes that he was foolish to lie and feels embarrassed or ""silly"" about it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation."
"Response: 
B) Greg judged the chili cook-off competition.
Explanation: The story does not provide any details that suggest Greg filed a police report or that the thief was caught. Instead, it mentions that Greg ""watched from the sidewalk"" after being pushed to the ground, which implies that he continued on with his day without taking any action to report the crime. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B: Johnson was an avid outdoorsman and hiked often.  
Explanation: The story states that Johnson's girlfriend teases him about not liking being outdoors, which suggests that she does not believe he would enjoy camping. However, since the story also mentions that Johnson decided to prove her wrong by going camping, it is more likely that he actually enjoys spending time outside and was able to have a good experience despite any initial reservations."
"Response: 
B - So, Pete kept the wallet and bought a new TV with the money. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Pete has every reason to keep the wallet and use its contents to buy something he wants. While Jim may be struggling financially, there's no guarantee that he will ever find his wallet or get the money back. By keeping the wallet and using the money to buy something he wants, Pete is taking advantage of an opportunity that has come his way. This outcome is therefore the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B) Sally felt better.
Explanation: In this scenario, Sally's sister Mary provided reassurance and helped Sally see her own strengths. This made Sally feel better about herself. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: He has a scar from the stitches.
Explanation: The story mentions that the boy's eyebrow was cut open and needed stitches, which means he will have a scar as a result of the injury. Option B is the more likely outcome based on the information provided in the story."
Response:  Option A - Lorelei calmed down after getting the teething biscuit. This option is most likely because it aligns with what we know about babies and their needs during teething. Babies often find relief from discomfort through sucking or chewing on something cold and hard, which is why teething rings and biscuits are commonly used to help them calm down.
"Response: 
B - You ran away from the ducks.
Explanation: In this story, the author mentions that they threw bread for the ducks but then describes how the ducks ""chased"" them in an ""angry fashion."" This implies that the ducks were not happy with the person throwing bread their way and may have even seen it as a threat or attack. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B - Eventually he threw it away.
Explanation: The story states that Graham used the selfie stick a few times and then forgot about it, indicating that he did not continue using it regularly. It is more likely that he lost interest in the selfie stick and eventually threw it away rather than continuing to use it daily."
"Response: 
B: Lewis laughed and told them not to be afraid of the bats."
"Response: 
B - Sara decided to buy a Viola instead. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Sara was enthusiastic about buying a guitar. In fact, option B states that she decided to buy a viola instead, which suggests that she may not have been as interested in purchasing a guitar as Sean was."
"Response: 
B - Bill felt relieved.
Explanation: In this story, Chris's concern about the test has been replaced by relief at the unexpected snow day. This suggests that Bill (or Chris in this case) feels better when there are unexpected changes or challenges rather than feeling anxious or stressed about something they were previously worrying about."
"Response: 
B: After a while, everything Martha cooked was delicious. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Martha's cooking improved over time as she practiced and learned from cooking shows. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as it implies that Martha's cooking skills eventually reached a high level of proficiency. Option A is less likely, as there is no indication in the story that Martha had any particular talent or interest in sewing."
"Response: 
B: I took him to the vet to treat him and he got better. 
Explanation: The story states that Tokyo got very sick ""out of nowhere,"" which suggests that his illness was sudden and unexpected. Taking him to the vet to receive medical treatment is the most likely explanation for why he recovered from his illness. Option A is not supported by the information provided in the story, as it implies that both cats were always healthy when in fact Tokyo became suddenly ill."
"Response: 
B: The carpet looked almost new after it was cleaned.
Explanation: The story states that the office staff complained about the red carpet being dirty, but none of their vacuums could properly clean it. This implies that the carpet was in a state of disrepair and needed professional attention. Hiring a professional carpet cleaner would be expected to result in a better outcome than using an office vacuum, which suggests that Option B is more likely."
"Response: 
B: She loved the donut she was eating. 
Explanation: In this story, Lexi wants to be healthy but ends up choosing a sweet treat instead. This suggests that she values taste over her desire to be healthy, which means option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option A: Anna ate all the wings as she drove home. This option is more likely because it aligns with the context provided in the story about Anna wanting chicken wings and driving far away to find them. It would be unusual for someone to eat a large quantity of food while driving, especially something spicy like hot wings.
"Response: 
B) I agreed to let my brother use the remote first. 
Explanation: The story states that ""my brother then got into a fight who should have it the first day."" This implies that the speaker agreed to let their brother use the remote on the first day, which is option B. Option A is not supported by the information provided in the story."
"Response: 
B - Ivy was glad she had chosen to fly. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Ivy's reaction to the emergency situation is one of gratitude rather than fear or panic. She is relieved that she chose to fly because it allowed her to experience something exciting and memorable, even if it was also dangerous. This suggests that she values adventure and taking risks over safety and security. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice for how Ivy would react in this situation."
"Response: 
B: Joey wished his parents appreciated him.
Explanation: The story states that Joey's parents thought he was an artist because of his ""odd colors,"" implying that they do not truly appreciate or understand his artistic abilities. This suggests that Joey may feel undervalued or unappreciated by his parents, which is option B. Option A implies that Joey feels proud of himself, which does not align with the tone of the story."
"Response: 
B - John reworked the presentation, and it was a great success. 
Explanation: The story suggests that John lacks preparation for his client presentation, specifically regarding the content's polish. Option A, bringing bagels to work, does not address this issue directly. Therefore, option B, where John reworks the presentation and succeeds, is more likely."
"Response:  Option B: Fred had won the lottery. 
Explanation: The story states that Fred ""found out great news"" when he got home, which implies that he did in fact win the lottery. Additionally, the tone of the story suggests a sense of excitement and surprise at winning, rather than resignation or disappointment at not winning."
"Response: 
B - So she had to settle for rinsing her hands off.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Gina settled for rinsing her hands off rather than stealing all the soap from the bathroom. The story mentions that there was no soap in the cabinet under the sink, which suggests that there may not have been enough soap available for Gina to take. Additionally, stealing soap from a public restroom would be considered impolite and disrespectful, so it is unlikely that Gina would do such thing. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B - The family sat down, and enjoyed a meal together. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that the family would sit down and enjoy a meal together after Mother rang the bell than for her to yell at them to get back to work.

"Response: 
B) Emmy left angry because she wanted a dog.

Explanation: The passage states that Kyle ""went looking for new figures for his collection."" This implies that Kyle collects various types of items, including action figures. It also mentions that Kyle added a new figure every month or so, which suggests that he has a diverse collection. Given these details, it is more likely that Kyle thinks Superman is a ridiculous construct rather than being particularly interested in Marvel heroes."
"Response: 
Option A: Francine was glad that she wore comfortable shoes! 
Explanation: In this story, Francine made a deliberate choice to wear flat shoes instead of high heels because she found them uncomfortable. The outcome of this decision is that her friends complement her on how great they look, indicating that she looks good in both styles. Therefore, option A is the best answer as it reflects the logical conclusion of the story."
"Response: 
B: People were very happy when I played this game without them.
Explanation: The story suggests that the speaker enjoyed playing ""hide and sneak"" and jumping out at people, which implies that they were doing so without the knowledge or consent of others.

"Response: 
B) Rachel took it to a language professor for translation. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Rachel wants to understand the contents of the letter, so she takes it to a language professor who can translate it into English or another language that Rachel can read.

"Response: 
B) Kelly remembered when her grandmother showed her the flowers. 
Explanation: In this story, Kelly's thoughts are triggered by something she read online about hybrid animals, specifically ligers. This suggests that Kelly has prior knowledge or experience with these creatures, which is why she finds them impressive.

"Response: 
B - I was very happy about the letter.
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist found an old letter from his girlfriend underneath some clutter, indicating that he had not seen or read it in a while.

"Response: 
The most likely outcome of Ben's actions is option B, ""His wife found out and they got a divorce."" This is because having an affair can often lead to feelings of betrayal and mistrust in a relationship, which can ultimately result in its dissolution.

"Response: 
B - The man wanted to lose his bet. 
Explanation:  In this story, the man is trying to outstare a duck, but the duck does not blink despite being stared at for an extended period of time.

B - Jill was depressed.
Explanation: In this story, Jill traded in her old car for a new one, which means she gave up something she already had (her old car) in exchange for something new (the new car). This can sometimes be a difficult decision, especially if the old car holds sentimental value or has been reliable over time. As a result, Jill may feel sad or depressed about letting go of her old car, even if she is excited about getting a new one."
"Response: 
B - Jaden had saved the day.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Jaden's girlfriend will be pleased with his thoughtful gesture than angry or upset. The fact that he had forgotten about Valentine's Day but still managed to get her flowers and chocolate shows that he is trying his best despite his forgetfulness, which could potentially earn him brownie points with his partner."
"Response: 
B: He realized biking was not for him, and took a nap instead. 
Explanation: The story states that John did not know how to ride the bike when he received it as a gift, and he spent the entire week practicing with training wheels on.

B: Quentin vowed to never go sailing again. 
Explanation: The story states that Quentin had never been on a boat before and that it was an exhilarating experience.

Additionally, the tone of the story implies that the adoption was a positive experience for everyone involved. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - I didn't water them again. 
Explanation: The story states that your friend found out that the plants needed more water, but it doesn't say that you actually gave them more water. Therefore, it's most likely that you didn't water them again, which is option B."
"Response:  Option B: Jill got better at video games. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Jill's outburst of anger led to a negative consequence (cracking the TV screen). However, rather than learning from her mistake or feeling remorseful, Jill becomes even angrier and decides to throw her game controller again. This behavior suggests that Jill may have difficulty managing her emotions in stressful situations and may be prone to impulsive actions without considering their consequences. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome as Jill will continue to act on her anger without reflecting on its impact."
"Response: 
The correct answer is (A) Then I fell asleep until the next morning. This is because the narrator of the story mentions feeling tired after binge-watching ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and standing in the doorway for a while, which suggests that they eventually became too exhausted to continue engaging in physical activity such as running. It is unlikely that the narrator would imagine themselves as Buffy and go running when they are already feeling tired from watching TV all night."
"Response: 
B: His mother was very angry. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is likely that Drew's mother will be angry with him for breaking into her house and damaging her belongings.

"Response: 
B - Tom thought it was the best hockey game ever."
"Response: 
B: Trip stopped eating watermelon completely. 
Explanation: The story states that Trip's mother told him he would grow a tree swallowing seeds if he ate enough watermelon, but it does not say anything about Trip enjoying the taste or texture of the seeds. In fact, the story implies that Trip did not enjoy eating the seeds because he always swallowed them anyway. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B: Angie tried to discuss the issue in detail. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Angie wants to understand why her work wasn't up to par and how she can improve it. She takes a proactive approach by reaching out to the requester and asking for specific feedback.

B - Trina's dad taught her how to dance.
Explanation: In this story, Trina is nervous about going dancing with Donovan because she doesn't know how to dance well. Her father notices that she is worried and decides to teach her some basic steps before she goes out with him.

Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response:

Explanation: In this story, Andy received a new bike on his birthday but didn't know how to ride it.

"Response: 
Option A: She wondered if the cashier had stolen her information. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Ali is concerned about the delay in returning her credit card and the subsequent unauthorized transactions on her account.

"Response: 
B: Then Gina told her mom where the key was. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Gina decides to tell her mother about the missing key instead of replacing it in its original location. This suggests that Gina may have had ulterior motives for taking the key or may be trying to manipulate her mother into revealing something important. It also implies that Gina may not have been as careful or sneaky as she thought when removing the key without permission."
"Response: 
B - The man moved to Kentucky.
Explanation: In this story, the man loves someone who lives in Louisiana, but he decides to move instead to Kentucky.

"Response: 
B: Tim was terribly disappointed.
Explanation: The story states that Tim failed math class, which means he did not do well in the subject. Therefore, it is more likely that he will be disappointed when he finds out he passed rather than being thrilled."
"Response: 
B) She took the cat home with her. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is most likely that Mary-Anne adopted the cat she had been interacting with while she was at the humane society. The fact that the cat meowed at her and she felt an instant connection suggests that they were meant to be together. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B - I got up and got right back on the balance beam. 
Explanation: The story states that the person was taking gymnastics lessons and was practicing on the balance beam when they injured themselves. This suggests that they are experienced with gymnastics and are comfortable performing on the equipment. It is unlikely that they would be rushed to the hospital after breaking their ankle, especially if they are able to get up and continue practicing immediately afterwards. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."

Explanation: The story states that the protagonist joined an online dating community in order to meet new people, indicating that they are interested in going on dates with others. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B) My wife and I had dinner that night. 
Explanation: The story states ""One day she went on an overnight field trip."" This implies that it was a single-day event, not a multi-day trip. Additionally, the fact that the author's wife went along as a chaperone suggests that they were there together, which means they would have eaten dinner together that night. Therefore, option B is the more likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - The bouncer did not allow us into the club.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it seems that the protagonist and their friends were excited to attend the club opening but unfortunately, they were not allowed in by the bouncer. This outcome is more likely than option A, where the protagonist befriends the bouncer to gain entry to the club tomorrow, as there is no indication in the story that the bouncer would go out of his way to help them."
"Response: 
B - Loved the way the glass looked now.  
Explanation:  In this situation, the person is more concerned with how the broken glass looks than any potential injury they may have sustained from cutting themselves. This suggests that they are more focused on aesthetics than practicality in this scenario."
"Response: 
Option B: They decided they didn't need it anyway, and moved. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the family's home was damaged by a tornado, which is an unexpected and unfortunate event.

Explanation: In this story, Allison goes to the library to learn more about her area's history. The librarian explains the Dewey Decimal System to her, which helps her find the books she wants. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: Sebastian was happy that his practice paid off."
"Response: 
Option A: The mother gently sang the lullaby to her baby. 
Explanation: In this situation, it is more likely that the mother would sing a traditional lullaby rather than play hip hop music. Lullabies are typically gentle and soothing, designed to help babies relax and fall asleep. Hip hop music, on the other hand, is often upbeat and energetic, which may be less effective at helping a baby fall asleep. Therefore, option A is the more plausible ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: Everyone was really happy because of Johnny's behavior. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any evidence that Johnny's actions were harmful or disturbing to others at the water park. In fact, it suggests that he may have been enjoying himself by reliving a childhood activity. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Amy felt terrible. 
Explanation: In this story, Amy feels left out when she watches other children playing and sees that they can participate in activities without any limitations due to their health issues. When her art teacher gives her encouragement, it makes her feel even worse because she wishes she could join them too but cannot do so due to her condition. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for this story."
"Response: 
B - Joe was very disappointed in his team.

"Response: 
B - Elaine found it difficult to make up her mind. 
Explanation: The story states that Elaine ""deliberated"" or thought about where she should go for almost an hour before making a decision.

Option A implies that Elaine easily made up her mind without any hesitation, which does not match the context of the story."
"Response: 
B - He never thought of it again. "
"Response: 
B - Matt did not care about the missing phone.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Matt was quite intoxicated and may have been unable to properly take care of himself or his belongings. It's possible that he didn't even realize his phone was missing until the next day, or that he simply didn't care enough to worry about it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this situation."
"Response: 
Option A: Everyone had a great time. 
Explanation: The story provides information about Bindu planning a party, meeting with her friends to decide on food and music, and four friends playing music at the party. This suggests that everyone had a good time at the party, which supports option A. There is no evidence in the story to suggest that Bindu hates her friends or parties, so option B is unlikely."
"Response: 
B - Tyler takes a quick shower and gets to the bus stop on time."
"Response: 
B - His doctor was very pleased at his next checkup.  
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Thomas's doctor will be pleased with his progress at his next checkup rather than diagnosing him with diabetes after gaining weight. The story mentions that Thomas started eating healthier and going on walks, which are positive changes that could lead to improved health outcomes. It is less likely that he would experience a negative outcome like being diagnosed with diabetes after only one visit to the doctor."
"Response: 
B) She screamed and pushed her brother away. 
Explanation: The story implies that the girl was startled by her brother's sudden appearance, which suggests that she might react with fear or surprise.

B: Stephanie could not get up until someone found her. "
"Response: 
B: Roy threw out the old fish, and everything smelled better.
Explanation: In this story, Roy can't figure out why his apartment smells bad until his friends point it out. They suggest looking for the source of the odor, which turns out to be an old fish in the refrigerator. Since the fish is the cause of the bad smell, the logical choice would be to throw it out, which is what Roy does. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Jimmy called his parents and cursed at them.  
Explanation:  It's unlikely that Jimmy would repay his parents for their sacrifices in sending him to college. While it's common for children to feel grateful towards their parents for their support, it's not typical for them to repay their parents financially. Instead, Jimmy might choose to express his gratitude through other means, such as spending quality time with them or helping them out in other ways. On the other hand, it's more believable that Jimmy could lash out at his parents emotionally by cursing at them, especially if he feels guilty about their financial sacrifices or resents their efforts to help him succeed."
"Response: 
B: Jill and her friends had a fun girls-only night out."
"Response: 
B - The old woman was delighted to find the fur coat. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the old woman is unlikely to refuse to return something that she found by chance, especially if it's valuable or useful to her. Instead, she would be delighted to have found something unexpectedly, which aligns with human nature."
"Response: 
B: I made pumpkin bars later in life and they reminded me of my mom.
Explanation: In this story, the narrator's mother makes pumpkin bars for them when they are feeling down, which suggests that she cares about their well-being. Later on, the narrator decides to make pumpkin bars themselves as an act of self-care or nostalgia, implying that the memory of their mother's care and concern still resonates with them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Tim and his grandad found a hobby that they both enjoyed. 
Explanation: The story states that Tim became interested in birdwatching after spending time with his grandfather. This suggests that Tim enjoyed the activity and found it enjoyable to do together with his grandfather. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."

"Response: 
B: Gina thanked Tami the next day.
Explanation: The story states that ""Gina thanked Tami the next day."" This suggests that Gina had a positive reaction to the situation, rather than feeling lonely or unhappy. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: Laurence put all of their belongings back into the house.
Explanation: The sentence ""All their belongings were moved into the van"" implies that everything was loaded into a moving van, which means that it would be unlikely for them to put all of those belongings back into the house afterward. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B) So she brought one home and gave it to her crab. 
Explanation: The story states that Joy ""scoured the beach all morning"" looking for the perfect shell, indicating that she wants to find something special and not just buy anything. When she finally finds a suitable shell, she brings it home and gives it to her hermit crab, which suggests that she successfully found what she was looking for. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B) Westin and his wife kicked out the intoxicated person."
"Response: 
B: Joe was angry he got hurt.
Explanation: In this scenario, Joe got stung by a bee multiple times while trying to help his father, which caused him physical pain and discomfort. It is natural for someone to feel upset or angry when they are injured unexpectedly, especially if it happened while doing something they thought would be enjoyable or helpful. Therefore, option B is the more likely response from Joe in this situation."
"Response: 
B - Todd opened up the bag and spread the leaves around. 
Explanation: In this story, Todd has just finished raking up his leaves and putting them in a bag. It makes sense that he would want to get rid of them rather than keep them in a bag. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Tim had little determination.
Explanation: The passage states that Tim ""worked out every night"" and ""earned a spot in a popular contest,"" indicating that he put in a lot of effort towards achieving his goal of becoming a great bodybuilder. However, it also mentions that he lifted over 250 lbs., which suggests that he may not have been as dedicated or determined as one might expect given his level of effort. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 
B - Henry was happy and thankful."
"Response: 
B) All the players were good but she made the team. 
Explanation: The story states that Tami had not anticipated how good the other players would be, indicating that they are also skilled.

"Response: 
Option B: The glue held the vase together and their mom never found out. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bob and Jim successfully glued the vase back together without getting caught by their mother. It's unlikely that she would be happy about a broken vase, but since they fixed it, there's no evidence of their mischief. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Steve drove an hour away to go to a strip club for drugs. 
Explanation:  The context of the story suggests that Steve is feeling down and depressed after being dumped by his girlfriend. Option A, ""Steve wondered if they could ever get back together,"" does not align with this scenario as it implies that Steve is still holding onto hope of reconciliation, which may not be the case given the breakup. On the other hand, option B, ""Steve drove an hour away to go to a strip club for drugs,"" better fits the narrative as it shows Steve trying to escape or cope with his emotional pain through self-medication, which is a common response to relationship breakups."
"Response: 
B - Gloria's husband appreciated the gesture.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Gloria's decision to pick her own flowers led to her filing for divorce. In fact, it suggests the opposite, as she ""got together"" with her husband to create a bouquet. This implies a positive interaction and appreciation on his part, which eliminates option A as the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) He made the most shots and won the contest."
"Response: 
B) She was jealous. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Lauren's desire to wear skinny jeans is driven by external validation (i.e., wanting to impress others). Once she loses enough weight to fit into those jeans, her focus shifts from internal motivations (i.e., feeling good in her own body) to external ones (i.e., seeking approval from others). This shift can lead to feelings of jealousy or insecurity when others around her are able to achieve similar results without necessarily experiencing the same level of self-doubt or anxiety. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Lauren's character arc."
"Response: 
B: Hawaii was not a good place to travel to. 
Explanation: The story states that it took 9 hours to fly to Hawaii, which suggests that it was a long trip. Additionally, the author mentions that they were part of a band class, which implies that they were traveling with other students for an educational purpose rather than as tourists. This could suggest that they did not have much time to enjoy themselves or explore the local culture, making it less likely that they would want to return to Hawaii."
"Response: 
B) Sonny decided to jump into his pool.  
Explanation:  The story states that Sonny was ""so sick of the heat"" and wanted to find a way to cool off. Jumping into a pool would be an obvious solution for this problem. Option A does not make sense because turning on the heaters would only make the room hotter, not cooler."
"Response: 
B: Instead of laughing, everyone applauded when Chad finally sang. 
Explanation: The correct answer is (B) because it aligns with the theme of overcoming fear and embracing one's talents. It suggests that instead of ridiculing or mocking Chad for his singing abilities, the people in the church choir were supportive and encouraging, which could help boost his confidence and allow him to share his gift with others."
"Response: 
B: His eyes glowed with excitement.  
Explanation: The story states that Ronald has two children already, which suggests he is not overjoyed at the prospect of having another child. However, it also implies that he is excited about the new addition to their family, as his eyes are said to ""glow"" with excitement. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) I followed the road back to my car.
Explanation: The fact that the speaker ""screamed"" and ""ran all the way back to the main road"" suggests that they were frightened by the sight of the snake, which makes option B more plausible than option A. As a biologist studying snakes, it's unlikely that the speaker would react with fear upon encountering one."
"Response: 
B) Mary kept driving and drank it anyway. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Mary is in a hurry and doesn't want to waste time going back to the drive-through window to correct her order. Therefore, she decides to keep driving and drink the incorrect order. This choice aligns with human behavior and is more plausible than option A, where Mary crashes into a pole due to distraction caused by the mistake."
"Response: 
A) Bill made a lot of friends that day. 
Explanation: The story states that Bill ""had a lot of fun hanging out with [his] coworkers,"" which suggests that he formed new friendships with them. It is unlikely that he would be upset or unhappy after having a good time socializing with others. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: He was so depressed, he became an alcoholic. 
Explanation: The story states that after Billy changed his mind about becoming a doctor, he became a nurse instead. However, this change in career path led him to feel depressed, which may have contributed to him developing an addiction to alcohol. This outcome is more likely than option A, as it aligns with the emotional struggles that can arise when making significant life changes."
"Response: 
B) Quinton was so happy."
"Response: 
B - Igor took a cold shower. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it's more likely that Igor decided to take a cold shower instead of waiting for the water to get hot. This choice aligns with his initial hesitation about whether or not to shower at all, as well as his desire to be productive and start his day off right. Option A does not fit with this narrative as there is no logical connection between eating a muffin and taking a cold shower."
Response:  Option A: Tara still enjoyed listening on her own! 
"Response: 
B: We left the White House abruptly and did not take the tour. 
Explanation: The story states that the speaker's boyfriend took her to the White House, but it does not mention anything about taking a tour. It is more likely that they visited the White House briefly and then left without taking a guided tour."
"Response: 
B - She wanted to play the drums.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that the child was excited to play the drums when she saw them. This suggests that she has an interest in music and wants to play the drums, rather than having no interest in music at all (option A)."
"Response: 
B - Maggie gave up the piano.
Explanation: The fact that Maggie was ""shaking"" when she got on stage suggests that she may have been experiencing performance anxiety, which can be a common experience for musicians, especially beginners. If Maggie continues to feel anxious or overwhelmed while performing, it's possible that she may decide to give up the piano altogether. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of this scenario."
"Response:  Option B: Ed regretted falling asleep. This is because the story states that Ed ""fell asleep before it ended,"" which implies that he missed the end of the movie. It's unlikely that he would be happy about missing the ending, so option B is the more plausible choice."
"Response:  Option B: I regret signing up. 
Explanation: The story states that the speaker ""went in this morning and signed up for the plan,"" which implies that they have already completed the action of signing up. However, the second option suggests that the speaker now regrets their decision, which goes against the information provided in the story. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B) They all enjoyed the meal.
Explanation: The story states that Mac ""remembered"" an alfredo sauce recipe made with cashews, implying that he was familiar with it and had tried it before. Additionally, the fact that he served it without hesitation suggests that he was confident in its taste and texture. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as they all enjoyed the meal."
"Response: 
B - Ryan decided his job was rather dull. 
Explanation:  The story states that Ryan used to work for mall security and often worked the night shift. This implies that Ryan's job involved patrolling the mall at night, which can be a repetitive and monotonous task. Additionally, the fact that Ryan stared at the raccoon for hours suggests that he may have been bored or uninterested in his job. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Johnny told the teacher he was upset he didn't get more colors."
"Response: 
B) Tim was satisfied.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Tim is gay, so option A can be ruled out. Option B is the most likely answer because it suggests that Tim made his decision based on the fact that one of the girls expressed more interest in him than the others, rather than their sexual orientation."
"Response: 
B - Jill was glad she did not bring Joe. 
Explanation:  The fact that Joe was unable to find the Geocache after over an hour of searching suggests that he may not have been interested in the activity, which could have made the experience less enjoyable for Jill if she had brought him. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Ella then became a star piano player. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Ella had access to a high-quality instrument, but she failed to practice and improve her skills. However, despite this initial disadvantage, Ella still has the potential to become a star pianist with hard work and dedication. It is more likely that Ella will overcome her lack of resources and become successful in music than for her to remain poorly skilled throughout her life."
Response:  Option B: Dave bought it and enjoyed his purchase. This option is most likely because buying a gun is a legal activity in the United States, and there is no indication in the story that Dave is opposed to the Second Amendment or any other law related to firearms ownership.
"Response: 
B: Rose shielded her face from the wind."
"Response: 
B) Drew had to start typing the paper over again.
Explanation: In this scenario, Drew fell asleep while using a typewriter, which resulted in accidental keystrokes that typed out some letters. Since he cannot erase the mistakes, he will have to retype the entire document from scratch, making option B the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Sarah loved her new telescope. 
Explanation: The story states that Sarah was ""ecstatic"" when she received the telescope from her father, indicating that she was very excited about it. There is no indication in the story that Sarah's father later took back the telescope or that Sarah lost interest in using it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B) She decided to put a rug over the stain. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, Kristen noticed a huge stain on her bed after not having moved her room in over four years. Instead of addressing the issue directly by cleaning or replacing the stained area, Kristen opted to cover it up by placing a rug over the stain. This choice suggests that Kristen may be avoidant or indifferent towards dealing with the problem, which aligns better with option B."
"Response: 
B) He sat down at the table with us, and we all had drinks. 
Explanation: This option is more likely because it is less dramatic than Option A. If someone broke into your home while you were sleeping, it would be unlikely that they would sit down at the table with you and have drinks. It is more likely that there would be some kind of confrontation or danger involved."
"Response: 
B - My parents were going to live separate lives.
Explanation: The story states that ""they decided to end things amicably,"" which implies that they are no longer living together. Additionally, the author mentions being ""hurt"" by their decision, suggesting that they are not on good terms. Given these details, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B: The new baby was a girl."
"Response: 
B) Monica could not explain why her friend had stolen the doritos.
Explanation: In this story, Monica's friend stole the Doritos despite being dared to do so. This suggests that the friend may have been motivated by something other than just wanting to complete the dare, such as a desire for excitement or a sense of rebellion. As a result, when questioned about their actions, the friend may struggle to come up with a convincing explanation, leading to option B."
Response:  Option A: Finally, Ray asked his friend if he had a spare toothbrush.  This is the most likely ending to the story because it makes sense given Ray's situation. If he forgot his toothbrush at home, it would be difficult for him to brush his teeth without one. Asking his friend if they have a spare toothbrush is the logical solution in this scenario.
Response:  Option B: Ellie decided to skip school the next day because she was ahead. This option makes sense given that Ellie has completed all of her assignments early, so there would be no need for her to go to school the next day.
"Response: 
Option A: He named it Don's Comics. 
Explanation: The story states that Don ""decided that he wanted to start his own comic book company."" This implies that he took action towards pursuing his dream, rather than simply throwing away his collection or not doing anything with his passion. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: The bat flew directly towards the source of the scream.
Explanation: In this scenario, it's more likely that the bat will fly towards the source of the loud noise, which is Arnold, rather than away from it. This choice also aligns better with the character's fear of being bitten by the bat, as they may instinctively try to avoid the perceived threat."
"Response: 
B: Annabelle was very offended. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Mary asking Annabelle to join her band without first consulting or asking permission from Annabelle's parents may have been perceived as disrespectful or invasive. It's possible that Annabelle felt uncomfortable with the sudden request and decided to express her offense towards Mary."
"Response: 
B - They gave him the antidote which saved his life. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it's unlikely that the doctors would have told Uki to simply ""drink plenty of fluids"" given the severity of his injury (being bitten by a venomous snake). Instead, they would have administered an antivenin or other treatment specifically designed to counteract the effects of the mamba venom. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Uki's situation."
"Response: 
Option A: Sean decided to go to a shelter."
"Response: 
B) The two hobos ate their cheeseburgers. 
Explanation:  In this story, each hobo brought back an unusual item for dinner - a worn boot and a gross of wing nuts. While these items may be useful in other contexts, they are not typically used as ingredients in cooking. Therefore, it is unlikely that the two hobos would have been able to make a meal using these items alone. Instead, they might have had to rely on more conventional ingredients found in their local area or scavenged from dumpsters. As such, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B - Very Prepared. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Judy and Bill are well-organized and prepared for their guests. They have made a meal (roast with potatoes and rolls with gravy), set the table, and put on some background music. This suggests that they are taking the time to make sure everything is ready for their parents' arrival. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Sal's leg eventually healed. 
Explanation: The story states that Sal hurt his leg, but it does not provide any information about how long he was injured for or if he received medical treatment. Therefore, it is most likely that Sal's leg eventually healed without any serious complications."
"Response: 
B) Rebecca and Jake both auditioned for the musical. 
Explanation: The story states that Jake promised Rebecca he would come back for her, indicating that he will return to be with her in the future. Option B provides a plausible explanation for how Jake and Rebecca might reconnect as adults, by auditioning for the same musical production. This option aligns better with the narrative established in the story than Option A, which does not provide any indication of Jake returning to be near Rebecca."
"Response: 
B - Both groups had a great time seeing the movies they wanted."
"Response: 
B - Amy was surprised that she did a good job. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that Amy will be surprised at how well she does surfing than decide to go swimming instead. Amy has been struggling to get the hang of it with the instructor's help, so it makes sense that she would feel proud and surprised when she finally tries it on her own and does a good job."
"Response: 
B - Kay used the raft for firewood.
Explanation: The story states that Kay ""worked hard"" on his raft during spring, indicating that he put effort into building it. However, when he tests it out in the lake, there is no indication that it floats successfully. Instead, he uses the raft for firewood, which suggests that it was not seaworthy or did not float properly. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Max's teacher's praised his creativity. 
Explanation: The passage states that Max had difficulty paying attention in class due to his tendency to get lost in his own thoughts. However, it also mentions that his teachers praised him for his creativity. This suggests that while Max may have struggled with academic performance, his imaginative thinking was valued by his educators. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the passage."
"Response: 
Option B: She realized how boring his life was. 
Explanation: In this story, Gina watches as friends make remarks and tell stories about her grandfather, which gives her a new perspective on him. However, instead of finding him more interesting or memorable, she realizes that his life was actually quite dull. This contrasts with Option A, where Gina knows that her grandfather will be someone she will always remember, implying that his life had been full of interesting experiences and memories."
"Response: 
B - Ashley went home and went to bed to get better. "
"Response: 
B - Her mom gave her an alarm clock. 
Explanation: In this story, Marley has difficulty finding a new bed that helps her sleep better. Instead of taking her to a sleep specialist, which would be more expensive and time-consuming, her mother gives her an alarm clock as a quick fix for her sleeping problem. This option is more plausible than Option A because it is a simpler solution that does not require any additional resources or expertise."
"Response: 
B - Joe was grateful and then went to work. 
Explanation: The story states that Joe ""landed a well-paying job,"" which suggests that he found employment successfully. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B - Lizzy needed help to get the bananas down. 
Explanation: In this story, Lizzy wants to pick her own bananas but realizes how big the bunches are and needs help to get them down from the tree. This outcome is more likely because it follows logically from Lizzy's desire to pick her own bananas and her realization of their size. Option A is less plausible as there is no clear reason for Lizzy to suddenly dislike bananas after wanting to pick her own."
"Response: 
B - I had a great time!
Explanation: The story states that the narrator ""rode on the bus"" and took ""plenty of photos,"" indicating that they enjoyed their experience on the old bus. Option B is therefore the more likely choice."
"Response:  Option B: Bryan went home relieved. 
Explanation: In this story, Bryan's condition is diagnosed as poison ivy, which can cause discomfort but is not usually life-threatening. Therefore, option B is more likely, as Bryan will be relieved that he knows what is causing the problem and can receive treatment to alleviate his symptoms."
"Response: 
B: The games were very close. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that the games between Tony and Mark were close matches rather than a blowout victory for Tony. The fact that they are ""fierce rivals"" and always play one-on-one suggests that the competition is intense and evenly matched, with neither player able to consistently dominate the other. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of their games."
"Response: 
B - Her friends suggested she should sell the candy at a bake sale.
Explanation: Based on the story, it seems that Becky and her friends enjoyed making the candy bars and were proud of their creation. Therefore, it is more likely that they would want to share their candy with others by selling it at a bake sale rather than giving up on making candy altogether."
"Response: 
B - She went home and ate 3 cartons of ice cream. 
Explanation: The story states that Robin ""was determined to get in shape,"" but then immediately after her workout, she goes home and eats 3 cartons of ice cream. This suggests that her determination to get in shape may not have been strong enough to overcome her desire for unhealthy foods. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Rachelle became depressed. 
Explanation: The story states that Rachelle ""lost her job"" and ""eventually, her home."" This implies that she experienced financial difficulties and loss of security, which could lead to feelings of sadness or depression. Additionally, the fact that she had to move into a hotel suggests that she may have felt embarrassed or ashamed about her situation, which can also contribute to feelings of depression. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Rachelle's story."
"Response: 
Option B: Wendy does not like apples.
Explanation: The story states that Wendy took her daughter to the orchard ""with her."" This implies that Wendy was accompanying her daughter, rather than the other way around. Additionally, the story mentions that Wendy and her daughter peeled and cleaned the apples together, implying that Wendy did not have any objections to working with the apples themselves. However, if Wendy did not like apples, it would be unlikely for her to take her daughter to an orchard in the first place or to participate in preparing the apples for baking. Therefore, option B is the more plausible conclusion to the story."
"Response: 
Option B: Bill was sad to see the sucker covered with dirt on the ground. 
Explanation: In this story, Bill saves up his pocket change for two weeks specifically to buy a sucker from the store. However, while walking home after purchasing it, he trips and falls, causing the sucker to become dirty and damaged. This outcome suggests that Bill may have been disappointed or upset by the loss of his new sucker, rather than feeling happy or fortunate about it. Therefore, option B is the more likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Neil enjoyed visiting Transylvania.
Explanation: The story describes Neil's initial excitement upon arriving in Transylvania and his positive interactions with the local people, which suggests that he enjoyed his time there. It is unlikely that he would decide to never return after only one visit."
"Response: 
B - Sadly, the new video game was disappointing. 
Explanation: The story states that Marc ""worked very hard and saved up all his money"" to purchase the new video game, indicating that he was excited about it. However, the final sentence suggests that the game did not meet his expectations, which would be a sad outcome for Marc. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - The stunt man loved it.  
Explanation:  Stunt men are trained professionals who perform dangerous stunts for movies and television shows. They knowingly take risks every day, so it's unlikely that they would be seriously injured in a car crash or any other stunt-related incident. In fact, many stunt men enjoy the thrill of performing high-risk stunts and find it exhilarating. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome in this scenario."
"Response: 
B: Pamela decided to break up with Ralph. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Ralph does not treat Pamela well. He shows no interest in listening to her or being punctual, and he flirts with other girls without regard for Pamela's feelings. Given these behaviors, it is likely that Pamela will decide to end their relationship rather than continue to tolerate such treatment."
"Response: 
B) Helen dreaded seeing outerspace. 
Explanation: The story states that Helen ""decided to become an astronaut"" and ""passed all the tests,"" indicating that she was successful in her goal of becoming an astronaut. However, the final sentence suggests that Helen may not have been as enthusiastic about the experience as one might expect, stating that she ""dreaded seeing outerspace."" This implies that while Helen worked hard to achieve her dream of going to space, she may not have been entirely thrilled with the actual experience."
"Response: 
B: I packed all my stuff up again. 
Explanation: The story states that it took the protagonist ""over 8 hours"" to move their belongings, which suggests that they had a significant amount of items to transport. However, despite this effort, the protagonist still has to ""pack [their] stuff up again."" This implies that there was more work to be done after the initial move, and that the process of unpacking and organizing did not end with the first night in the new apartment. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Hailey cried to think that she would not see her friends. "
"Response: 
B: It is a fond memory.
Explanation: The passage states ""To this day he keeps peppermints in his cupboards."" This suggests that the character has positive associations with peppermints due to their connection to his grandmother. Additionally, the fact that he still keeps them in his cupboards years after her passing implies that these memories are cherished and not negative ones. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Jake tried skiing again the following day.
Explanation: In this story, Jake didn't seem to learn from his mistake of not being careful enough while skiing. Instead of waiting for his leg to fully heal before trying again, he decides to try skiing again the next day without proper precautions. This suggests that Jake may be impulsive or reckless, which could lead to further accidents or injuries. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
B) Valerie hoped to live in Italy someday.
Explanation: The story states that Valerie ""decided to practice speaking German with a German friend."" This implies that Valerie has an interest in learning about other cultures and languages beyond just studying German. Option B suggests that Valerie may have aspirations of living in Italy at some point in the future, which aligns with this idea."
"Response: 
B) Clara felt very lonely. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Clara met her friend Sally, which suggests that Clara did not feel lonely during their time together. However, since the story does not provide any information about how Clara feels after they part ways, it is possible for Clara to feel lonely later in the day. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 
B - Tim didn't have to worry about dropping it in water anymore. 
Explanation: The story states that Tim purchased a waterproof phone case, which means that he was trying to protect his phone from being exposed to water. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story, as Tim will not have to worry about dropping his phone in water again. Option A is unlikely because there is no indication in the story that Tim's phone became ruined due to exposure to water."
"Response: 
B - Gina was so hungry that the fries tasted good this time."
"Response: 
B - You said goodbye to the man on the phone.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that the caller was not your long lost mother but rather a prankster or someone with malicious intentions. The fact that you did not recognize the voice and the caller hung up after you asked who they were suggests that this was not a legitimate call. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: The fresh air was exactly what Nelly needed to clear her head. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it seems that Nelly is feeling stressed and overwhelmed by her work. Going outside for some fresh air can help to clear her head and improve her mood, which is why option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B: Alec was happy to see his daughter developing her verbal ability. 
Explanation: The story states, ""Alec was happy to see his daughter making words with the blocks."" This suggests that Alec was pleased to see his daughter using the blocks for their intended purpose of creating words, which aligns with option B. Option A does not fit the context of the story as it implies a completely unrelated activity (going to the movies) without any connection to the block-making scenario provided in the story."
"Response: 
B: It was terrible to be sentenced to life in prison. 
Explanation: In this scenario, you have committed a serious crime (murder) and been caught by the police. As a result, it is highly unlikely that you would be given a badge or become a deputy. Instead, you would likely face severe legal consequences, including being sentenced to life in prison."
"Response: 
B) He broke the records one by one as his parents watched. 
Explanation: Tim's excitement about playing his parents' old records was short-lived, as he quickly realized that he had no idea how to handle them carefully. As he tried to play them on his new record player, he ended up breaking each of them one by one, much to the dismay of his parents who had given them to him with such fond memories. This outcome is more likely because it highlights Tim's carelessness and lack of appreciation for the sentimental value of his parents' belongings."
"Response:  Option B: Amy was determined to lose weight. This is because the story states that she made ""delicious fruit and vegetable smoothies,"" which are typically associated with a healthy, low-calorie diet. Additionally, the fact that it takes 20 minutes to clean the blender suggests that Amy may be making these smoothies regularly, which could be part of her effort to lose weight."
"Response: 
B) Tina joined the high school dancing team. 
Explanation: The story states that the instructor wanted to talk to Tina after she finished dancing, which implies that he had some positive feedback or encouragement for her. It is unlikely that an instructor would want to speak with a student if they were not interested in them joining the team. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option A: Sally was grateful for his kindness. 
"Response: 
B: Amy was relieved she didn't get any extra money. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Amy was not expecting a large raise but was still hoping for some additional compensation. However, when she received her paycheck with no increase in salary, she may have been relieved that she didn't end up with more money than she expected or could handle. This outcome aligns better with option B as it shows Amy feeling relief rather than disappointment or anger at receiving no raise."
"Response: 
B: Jennifer had not taken any cello lessons. "
"Response: 
B - Fred woke up with a hangover. 
Explanation: The story states that Fred got drunk and passed out on the sand, indicating that he consumed alcohol at the beach party. When he woke up the next morning, he would have had a hangover as a result of drinking too much alcohol. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Ronnie quit as soon as he got in.
Explanation: The story states that Ronnie hit a rock and fell while riding his bike to work, which suggests that he may have been injured or at least shaken up by the fall.

"Response: 
Option A: Burke soon reverts back to being grumpy. 
Explanation: In this story, Burke tries to change his behavior by smiling more based on the advice of a stranger. However, once the stranger is gone, Burke returns to his usual grumpy demeanor, indicating that he does not find happiness in smiling for long periods of time. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Matt fiddled with the car radio, looking for a better station.
Explanation: In this scenario, Matt is so focused on finding a better radio station that he doesn't take responsibility for his actions or show any empathy towards the injured jogger. This behavior is consistent with how someone might act when they are avoiding dealing with an uncomfortable situation, such as feeling guilty about causing harm to another person. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome in this scenario."
"Response: 
Option B: Brian was not very creative. 
Explanation: The story does not suggest that Brian's outfit or performance were particularly original or unique. In fact, it states that he wore a skirt on stage, which is not an uncommon or innovative choice. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
B) I hated decorating."
"Response: 
B - I feel I don't deserve it.
Explanation: The speaker mentions that they have worked ""very hard"" to earn the promotion, which suggests that they may not feel fully deserving of it. Additionally, the use of the word ""happy"" in the sentence implies that there may be some surprise or unexpectedness to their receiving the promotion, which could also contribute to feelings of uncertainty about their worthiness for it."
"Response: 
B) Tia used the soap bars to wash her dirty dogs."
Response:  Option A (The police found the perpetrator and locked her up.) 
"Response: 
Option B: Pat is sad. "
"Response: 
B: Marsha was devastated. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Marsha would be devastated by her failed attempt at cooking rather than elated.

"Response: 
B: Solomon thought his name might not be so bad after all. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Solomon initially dislikes his given name but then reconsiders upon realizing that it may have helped him stand out in a positive way during the job interview. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) She was relieved to find it underneath her car seat."
"Response: 
B: With a look of disgust, he threw the tickets in the trash.
Explanation: The story states that the person's spouse is a ""huge"" Star Wars fan, which suggests that they are extremely passionate about the franchise. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would throw away tickets to a new Star Wars movie without at least considering going to see it first. Option B provides a more realistic outcome given the context of the story."
"Response: 
B: The customer was angry. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Ben's decision to use a dirty plate instead of washing a new one may have been seen as unprofessional or disrespectful to the customer. It could have led to the customer feeling unhappy with their meal and potentially filing a lawsuit against the restaurant. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome in this situation."
"Response: 
B: Stacey told the police what happened. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's more likely that Stacey would tell the police about the accident rather than getting back in her damaged car and continuing on to work. The police can help determine who was at fault for the accident and provide assistance with filing an insurance claim or other necessary actions. Additionally, if Stacey were to get back in her car without reporting the accident, she could be putting herself and others at risk of further harm."
"Response: 
B: It was hard, but they agreed to go their separate ways. 
Explanation: The story states that it was ""hard"" for both girls when one of them got rejected from Cornell, indicating that they were upset by this outcome. However, instead of letting their friendship suffer as a result, they chose to go their separate ways.

"Response: 
B - Later, we gave her a bowl of milk. 
Explanation: The story mentions that the cat had recently passed away, which suggests that it has been less than two weeks since her death. Therefore, it is unlikely that the family would be giving her a bowl of milk as they are still grieving their loss. Option B is the more plausible choice given the context of the story."
"Response: 
B) Reilly fed the goat extra food."
"Response: 
B: Sally wanted to inform the family of her husband's condition. 
Explanation: The story states that Sally ""ran away"" and became estranged from the family, indicating that she was no longer in contact with them. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would suddenly become the family's best friend. Instead, it makes more sense that she reached out to inform them of her husband's condition, as this is a significant event that may warrant communication with loved ones."
"Response: 
B: The compliments she got made Laura think the trip was worth it. 
Explanation: In this story, Laura travels far and wide to get her hair done by a famous stylist. Despite spending so much time and money on the haircut, Laura still feels unsatisfied with how she looks. However, when people start giving her compliments after seeing her new look, she realizes that the trip was worth it for the positive feedback alone. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B - Neil hated his trip. 
Explanation: The story states that Neil was ""amazed"" by the beauty of Sofia, which suggests that he found it impressive and enjoyable. However, the final sentence indicates that Neil hated his trip, which contradicts this earlier impression. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."

"Response: 
B: I left after the first forty-five minutes.
Explanation: The story indicates that the speaker was very enthusiastic about seeing the movie and had been waiting in line for a long time.

B) I loved my new socks."
"Response: 
B - Grayson uses the money from selling his stamps to buy a guitar. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Grayson's decision to sell his stamp collection leads to him using the money to purchase something that brings him joy rather than getting a low price for the stamps. This outcome suggests that Grayson values his passion for music over the monetary value of his stamp collection."
"Response: 
B: Lance never spoke to Adam again.
Explanation: The story states that Lance took a bullet for Adam, which means he sacrificed himself to save his friend's life. However, since Lance died, it is unlikely that he would ever speak to Adam again. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of their friendship."
"Response: 
B) The dentist reassured me that everything was fine.
Explanation: In this story, the protagonist (you) walks into the dentist's office, signs the attendance board, and sits down for the dental procedure. Option A suggests that after the procedure, you received a signed petition from the dentist, which is unlikely given the context of the story. Option B is more plausible as it aligns with the normal course of events in a dental appointment - the dentist would typically reassure the patient that everything is okay during or after the procedure."
"Response: 
B) They set up a space in the garage for him to practice. 
Explanation: The story states that Tim's parents were upset by the noise he made while playing the drums, but they did not hate the sound of the instrument itself. Instead, they found a solution by setting up a space in the garage where Tim could practice without disturbing anyone else in the house. This option is more likely than Option A, which suggests that Tim's parents developed an aversion to the trumpet altogether, which is unlikely given that they allowed their son to continue playing it."
Response:  Option A: So I would indulge every once in a while, and it was delicious!  This option best completes the story because it suggests that the speaker enjoys going to the buffet occasionally but not regularly. It also implies that they find the experience enjoyable and worth splurging on.
"Response: 
B - Kenny had to be taken to the hospital.  
Explanation:  In this scenario, Kenny has fallen while playing on the jungle gym and fractured his arm in multiple places. This is a serious injury that requires medical attention immediately. It is unlikely that he would continue playing basketball after such an incident, as it could further injure him or exacerbate the existing injury. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Kenny's situation."
"Response: 
B: May had a very stressful night.
Explanation: The story mentions that May had a ""night with no kids or husband,"" which suggests that she usually has these responsibilities, making it unlikely that she would have a relaxing evening without them. Additionally, ordering Chinese takeout and watching movies all night are not typically associated with relaxation, but rather with indulging in comfort foods and entertainment after a long day. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."
"Response: 
B: The cranberry sauce was very sour. 
Explanation: Lilly forgot to add sugar to the cranberry sauce, which means that it would be quite sour instead of sweet. This outcome aligns with option B."
"Response: 
B - I had a great time with my kids while home from college. 
Explanation: The story mentions that both of the author's kids came home from college for winter break, which implies that they were away at school during the fall semester. This means that it was their first chance to spend quality time together as a family since the start of the academic year. Additionally, the language used in the passage suggests that the author enjoyed this time with her children, using words like ""fun"" and ""great."" Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Michael decided to have the dumpster company pick up his trash. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Michael has seen two squirrels living in the same dumpster within a short period of time. This suggests that the dumpster may be a regular source of food or shelter for these animals, which could potentially pose health risks to humans. To avoid any potential problems, Michael decides to have the dumpster company pick up his trash rather than risking exposure to wildlife."
"Response: 
B: Rob was disappointed. 
Explanation: The fact that Tom got Rob a ""large case"" of something suggests that it's not just any ordinary item, but rather something that Rob might not necessarily want or appreciate. Additionally, the phrase ""rare variety"" implies that this is something unique and special, which could make Rob feel even more disappointed if he doesn't enjoy it."
"Response:  Option B: Jennifer realized swimming was not her best hobby. 
Explanation: In this story, Jennifer dives into the race with determination and pushes hard to catch up to the other competitors. Despite her efforts, she realizes that swimming may not be her strongest hobby. This suggests that she has doubts about her abilities in this particular sport, which aligns better with option B."
"Response: 
B) Ace was happy for his friend."
"Response: 
B - So he gave her cash. 
Explanation: Paul, being indecisive about buying a gift for his wife, ultimately decides to give her cash instead of trying to find something that might not be perfect. This choice aligns with his personality trait of being uncertain and unconfident in making decisions."
"Response: 
B: The judge convicted him of murder. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it's unlikely that my brother would go to jail for failing to appear in court. Failure to appear is typically considered an infraction or misdemeanor, rather than a serious crime like murder. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
"Response: 
B - He loved it.
Explanation: The story states that Tim ""loved it"" when he was in the woods, hearing the sounds of nature. This suggests that he found peace and enjoyment in being close to nature, which is why he decided to build a treehouse and move in. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
Option A: His parents relented. 
Explanation: In this story, Ted's parents initially discouraged his interest in gaming, but after he demonstrated his passion and talent for writing about it, they eventually came around and supported him. This suggests that they may have had some reservations about their initial decision, which could be seen as a sign that they might relent if presented with compelling evidence or arguments. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Tammy kept working out.
Explanation: The story does not suggest that Tammy experienced any negative effects from exercising after donating blood or drinking juice. In fact, it implies that she continued with her usual routine without any issues. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Abigail climbed off her wheelchair and onto the bed. 
Explanation: The story states that Abigail has a ""strict schedule"" and takes walks every day, but it does not mention anything about her losing weight or having any physical limitations. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: Eddie loved his new friend. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Eddie experienced something unusual, but it did not necessarily indicate anything negative or harmful. In fact, the story implies that Eddie found comfort in the unexpected voice he heard, as he is seeking mental help rather than feeling frightened by it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Jay had a good laugh. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it seems unlikely that Jay would be angry or upset about someone hitting his car and driving away. Instead, he might view the situation as an opportunity for humor, perhaps even finding irony in the fact that his car's alarm went off before he did. This choice reflects a more lighthearted and optimistic personality type."
"Response: 
B: When they returned, they saw that their house was gone. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the explosion caused by the gas leak resulted in the destruction of the house. Therefore, when the family returned from work, they would see that their house no longer existed. Option A is unlikely because it suggests that the family returned home to find their house had been cleaned without any explanation as to how or why it happened."
"Response: 
Option B: Carmen decided to order Domino's instead. 
Explanation: The story states that Carmen ""found a recipe with a cauliflower crust,"" which suggests that she was trying to make a healthier version of pizza. However, the option chosen (B) indicates that Carmen ultimately decided not to bother making it herself and instead ordered Domino's instead. This outcome seems unlikely given the effort Carmen put into finding a recipe with a cauliflower crust in the first place."
"Response: 
B: His fingernails are way too long.
Explanation: In this story, Rufus notices that his fingernails have grown too long, which is causing a loud tapping sound when he types on his computer. This suggests that Rufus did not cut his nails short enough before deciding to do so at night. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B) Herman managed to buy some food to make a small meal."
"Response: 
B: Kelly had to schedule another flight. 
Explanation: The story states that Kelly missed her original flight, so it is unlikely that she would be able to catch up with the same flight. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: They were excited to bring the peaches to grandma. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that the children were excited to bring the peaches to their grandmother rather than having her pick them herself. This is because the story highlights the fact that the children are responsible for picking the peaches, which suggests that they are actively involved in the process. Additionally, the phrase ""They always made sure the picked the best peaches"" implies that the children take pride in selecting high-quality peaches, which further supports the idea that they are eager to present their selection to their grandmother."
"Response: 
B - Candice got better at making tacos. 
Explanation: The story states that Candice's current taco recipe is not very good, but she still enjoys them. This implies that she has some knowledge or experience with making tacos already. Therefore, it is more likely that she will improve upon her existing skills rather than sticking with a subpar recipe."
"Response: 
B: Tony then went back to school and found a different major. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Tony's skills or qualifications that would make him particularly employable in the field of art. In fact, the story states that he ""couldn't find a job."" Therefore, it is more likely that Tony will need to pursue another major or career path in order to be successful."
"Response: 
B: Jenny was unhappy.
Explanation: The story describes difficult circumstances for Jenny and her mother, including poverty, lack of access to basic necessities like food, and discomfort due to the presence of roaches. It is unlikely that Jenny would be ""thrilled"" with these conditions, and it is more plausible that she would feel unhappy or unsettled about them."
"Response:  Option B: After a month he gave up.  This option best fits the information provided in the story because it states that Bill ""lacked initiative"" and only started making progress after he ""stopped being so hard on himself."" It is unlikely that Bill would have achieved his weight loss goal within a short period of time, especially if he has struggled with this issue for years without success."
"Response: 
Option A: The little girl was saved by her dad. 
Explanation: In this situation, it is more likely that the father would be able to save his daughter than for the daughter to pull him out of the water. This is because the father is an adult and has greater strength and ability to perform physical tasks compared to a small child like his daughter. Additionally, the father may have received training in lifesaving techniques or have experience in rescuing people from water, which could give him an advantage in this situation."
"Response: 
B: I got her phone number. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it's likely that you were interested in getting to know the woman better, and therefore would have asked for her contact information. Option A is unlikely because the woman did not tell you to leave her alone, which suggests that she was willing to continue talking with you."
"Response: 
B: Cindy was very experienced. 
Explanation: The story states that Cindy has been driving for a few months, which implies that she has gained some experience behind the wheel. It's unlikely that she would be too scared to drive in the rain if she has already driven for an extended period of time. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - You were ashamed of what you had done.
Explanation: The story implies that selling a booklet filled with random facts and trivia for profit may not be a legitimate or ethical business practice, and could potentially result in shame or embarrassment. It's possible that the narrator regrets their decision to sell such a product, or feels that they have taken advantage of people by peddling trivial information for financial gain."
"Response: 
Option A: He quickly bought the camera. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bob's discovery of the camera's high value increases its attractiveness as an investment opportunity. Given that he has already identified the potential profit, it makes sense for him to purchase the camera immediately rather than buying film."
"Response: 
B - He ran away with the small ball.
Explanation: The story states that Rover ""weaved through traffic with amazing skill."" This implies that he was able to move quickly and easily through the busy streets, which suggests that he is capable of running away with the ball. Additionally, the fact that the ball is described as ""small"" further supports this option, as a smaller object would be easier for Rover to carry off with him."
"Response: 
B - My mom slammed on the brakes just in time.
Explanation: In this situation, my mom had to act quickly to avoid a collision with the approaching train. Slamming on the brakes would be the best course of action to slow down the car and give her enough time to react to the unexpected situation. Jumping into a swimming pool would not provide any protection from the impact of the train or give her enough time to react. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Kelly used the money to treat all her friends to ice cream."
"Response: 
B) It helped him get a job in construction."
"Response: 
Option A: She wore her gray hair with pride."
"Response: 
B) She decided to give it a chance, and returned to the party. "
"Response: 
B - I had to sell the car in another state.
Explanation: The story states that the car no longer passed the state's inspection, which means it cannot be legally driven on public roads within that state. In order to drive the car legally, the owner would need to either repair or replace the modifications that caused the failure, or they may need to register the car in another state where the modifications are allowed. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - The group got to Las Vegas with no issues.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the group arrived at their destination without any incidents. The fact that Trent dozed off while driving suggests that he may have been tired or drowsy, but it does not necessarily mean that he drove off the road or had an accident. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Brandon then became a surfer. 
Explanation:  The story mentions that Brandon lives near the ocean, which suggests that he has easy access to the water for surfing. Additionally, the mention of a pier being built nearby implies that there are waves suitable for surfing in the area. Therefore, it is more likely that Brandon would become a surfer rather than a fisherman."
"Response: 
Option B: Randy ran away screaming."
"Response: 
B: The performers were really talented and the music was beautiful. 
Explanation:  In this story, the narrator unexpectedly enjoyed themselves at the opera despite initially not being interested in it. This suggests that they found the performance to be of high quality, with talented performers and beautiful music. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Shay was happy that she went into the office. 
Explanation: The fact that Shay received overtime pay for working on a Saturday suggests that she values her job and is willing to put in extra effort when necessary. By choosing to go into the office on her day off, Shay demonstrated her commitment to her work and her employer. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - The whole family was glad Cinnamon left. 
Explanation: This answer choice is correct because it aligns with the tone of the passage, which suggests that Cinnamon's death was a relief for the family. The use of words like ""old"" and ""frail"" implies that Cinnamon was suffering, and the fact that the family had to ""put her down"" further reinforces this idea. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 
B - You kept trying and eventually you excelled.  
Explanation:  The story states that the person ""wanted to excel"" to pointe ballet shoes, but their instructors told them they weren't ready yet. This suggests that the person didn't give up despite being initially discouraged, and instead continued to work hard and practice in order to achieve their goal. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B) Harry disliked Mary. 
Explanation: The story states that Harry went to the country to see his friend Mary, but it does not indicate any positive feelings towards her. In fact, option B explicitly states that Harry dislikes Mary, which aligns with the information provided in the story. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Cryed at the end."
"Response: 
B: The lawn mower suddenly started. 
Explanation: This option is more likely because it provides a sudden and unexpected twist in the story, which is often what readers expect from a plot twist. Option A, on the other hand, would be a more predictable outcome, as running out of gas is a common problem that could easily happen to anyone."
"Response: 
B) Susan drove back to the last stop to talk to the strange man. 
Explanation: In this story, Susan felt uneasy after seeing a strange man looking at her intently inside the previous rest stop. Rather than leaving immediately or driving away from him, she decided to drive back to the same rest stop to confront him. This choice suggests that Susan may be curious about the stranger's intentions or wants to know more about him, which is why she drives back to the rest stop where she encountered him earlier. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: We stopped in time to see the fox run across the road. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the grandfather's quick reaction allowed them to stop in time to see the fox cross the road, rather than the fox jumping behind their dirt bike. This option is more plausible given the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B - Ashley spent her summer riding her bike instead. 
Explanation:  The story states that Ashley broke her leg, which means she cannot go swimming or floating on inner tubes in the river. Option A is unlikely because it suggests that Ashley would encourage Brad to go without her, which is not a realistic scenario given her injury. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Sam's head hit the steering wheel. 
Explanation: In this story, Sam was driving too fast and failed to notice a pothole in the road. As a result, his truck bounced hard after hitting the pothole, which suggests that Sam may have been injured or hurt during the incident. It is more likely that Sam's head hit the steering wheel due to the sudden jolt caused by the pothole than for him to be happy about disabling his mail truck."
"Response: 
B: The girl found this charming, and gave him a second chance. 
Explanation: In this scenario, John's attempt to act silly in order to gain the girl's attention may have come across as endearing or cute, rather than annoying or immature. It's possible that she appreciated his effort and willingness to be playful, and therefore gave him a second chance."
"Response: 
Option B: She threw her ice cream in the garbage. 
Explanation: Based on the story, it seems that Aurelia did not enjoy her homemade ice cream as much as she expected. Instead of brainstorming new recipes or experimenting further, she opted to throw the ice cream away. This suggests that she may have been disappointed or unimpressed by the taste or texture of her homemade ice cream, leading her to dispose of it rather than continuing to work with it."
"Response: 
B: Miriam became a very successful lawyer. 
Explanation: The story states that Miriam ""became a lawyer."" This implies that she pursued a career in law and achieved success in this field, which contradicts option A (Miriam never stopped being pedantic). Therefore, the most likely outcome for Miriam is that she became a successful lawyer."
"Response: 
B) The girls have their passes."
"Response: 
B - The bus never arrived, and we missed our field trip. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that the bus did not arrive and they missed their field trip than the opposite. The fact that the bus broke down and they waited for another bus for an hour suggests that there was some kind of delay or issue with transportation, which could have caused them to miss their destination."
"Response: 
B - My family was too demanding. 
Explanation: The story states that none of the family members could tell the narrator what toppings they wanted, and everyone kept changing their minds. This suggests that they were being indecisive or difficult to please, rather than simply wanting vegetables as an option. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Alice helped herself to some coffee and sat down to relax. 
Explanation: Given that Alice has already prepared for her presentation over the weekend, she would be well-prepared and confident in her abilities. Therefore, when she realizes she's running late, instead of panicking or being disorganized, she takes a few moments to calm herself by having a cup of coffee before starting her presentation. This option is more plausible than Option A, where Alice is a mess during her presentation, as it aligns with the character's personality and situation better."
"Response: 
B: Gina got in trouble.
Explanation: In this story, Gina took something that belonged to someone else without permission (her brother's ice cream), and when she was caught, she was punished by her mother. This suggests that taking things without permission or being selfish can lead to negative consequences, which is a lesson that children often learn through experience. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
Option A: Amber slowly developed into a pretty good hitter. 
Explanation: The story states that Amber practiced for several weeks, indicating that her hitting skills did improve over time. It does not mention anything about her fielding skills improving, which suggests that she may have remained relatively average in this area. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Gina was having a great time at her grandmother's house.
Explanation: The story states that Gina and her family arrived at their grandma's house, but it also mentions that her grandpa had a heart attack and died, which suggests that the visit was not entirely joyful. However, the final sentence implies that despite this sad event, Gina was still able to have fun at her grandma's house. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: It was a great morning.
Explanation: Based on the context provided in the story, it seems that the speaker had a positive experience during Christmas morning. They were able to enjoy the holiday with their family and appreciated the beauty of the decorations and gifts. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Jim quit playing basketball.
Explanation: The story states that Jim was ""upset"" when he was cut from the team, which suggests that he had invested some emotional energy in trying out for the team. However, despite this setback, Jim still decides to work hard during the off-season to improve his skills. This shows determination and a willingness to put in effort, but it does not necessarily mean that he will make the team the next time around. In fact, given the language used in the story (e.g., ""upset,"" ""motivated to prove everyone wrong""), it seems more likely that Jim may have become disheartened or discouraged after being cut from the team, leading him to give up on basketball altogether."
"Response: 
Option A: Gradually, Mary was able to pay off her debt. 
Explanation: The story states that Mary ""wanted to pay it off"" and ""cut off her unnecessary expenses."" This implies that she took deliberate actions to reduce her spending and increase her savings, which ultimately allowed her to pay off her debt gradually. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: John didn't know what to do. 
Explanation: In this story, John has lost his homework and doesn't know where it is or how to explain its absence to his teacher. He is worried that she will think he is lying about doing his homework, which suggests that he may not be able to come up with a good solution to this problem. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this story."
"Response: 
B - Tommy decided to take all of the money. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Tommy was unsure about how to split the profits with Billy, which suggests that he may be more interested in keeping the money for himself rather than sharing it with his friend. This choice aligns with the selfish personality trait."
Response:  Option A: Tori fell ill because of eating too much candy. This is the most likely outcome given that Tori ate the candy quickly and then experienced discomfort in her stomach, suggesting that she may have consumed more sugar than her body could handle.
"Response: 
The answer is (B) She decided to go back home.  
Explanation: The story states that Beverly ""figured everything is big in Texas"" which implies that she may not have been familiar with the area or its culture. Additionally, the fact that she decides to ""get lost"" suggests that she may not have had a clear plan or direction when she left. Given these factors, it is more likely that she will decide to return home rather than starting a new life in an unfamiliar place."
"Response: 
B: John then felt sick the rest of the day. 
Explanation: The story states that John ""felt better"" after getting up and having breakfast, which suggests that he did not feel sick for the rest of the day. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Sally was very happy to see cheese pizza. 
Explanation:  In this story, it is mentioned that Sally doesn't like cheese. However, despite this, she is still excited to see cheese pizza. This suggests that Sally has a strong preference for cheese pizza, even though she doesn't typically eat it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: I've never had a worse day. 
Explanation: The student describes their day as ""just a disaster"" and mentions that they caught a fever after getting soaked in the rain, which suggests that they are not having a good time. Additionally, the phrase ""I've never had a worse day"" implies that this is the worst day the student has ever experienced, making it the more likely option."
"Response: 
Option A: Felipe immediately started planning the next trip.

"Response: 
B) Ed lost the game."
"Response: 
B: Lary was happy and excited. "
"Response: 
B - Jim saved a lot of money in gas by buying a battery-run car. 
Explanation: In this story, Jim decides to buy a car that can run on both gasoline and a battery. This means that he will save money on gas because he can use the battery when he's driving around town or in stop-and-go traffic, which uses less fuel than using only the gasoline engine. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: Nick decided to take his dog to a trainer. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Nick wants to address his dog's lack of socialization and aggressive behavior towards other dogs during their walks. Taking his dog to a professional trainer would be the best course of action to help him overcome these issues. Option A is unlikely because it does not align with the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B - His daughter now adds to it, for her daughter's college.
Explanation: The fact that Earl surprises his daughter with a savings account for their newborn grandchild suggests that he wants to help prepare for the future of this little one. It's unlikely that he would do this if he didn't have a good relationship with his daughter or if he expected her not to contribute to the fund. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Everyone else got out safely. 
Explanation: The story states that ""Five people were inside the building when it exploded."" This means that there were more than just Mosh and his little sister inside the building, which makes option B the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - I bought her sexy lingerie instead. 
Explanation: The story states that the speaker's girlfriend collects ""stamps, not the kind for mail but the kind to stamp things with."" This implies that she enjoys collecting small objects or trinkets to decorate or personalize items. It is unlikely that the speaker would purchase a rare stamp for his girlfriend as it may not be something she would find appealing or useful in her hobby. Instead, option B suggests that the speaker purchased sexy lingerie for his girlfriend, which could be a thoughtful and romantic gift given their relationship."
Response:  Option B: Jake then threw the sandwich away.  This option is more likely because it aligns with human behavior where people often throw away uneaten food instead of consuming it. Additionally, if Jake had already eaten half of the sandwich, there would be no need to throw it away as well.
"Response: 
B - Elda tossed the fries into the trash can."
"Response: 
B: His training paid off at a marathon later that year. 
Explanation: The story states that Matt ""was back to training"" after his injury, which implies that he continued to train for running despite the setback. Given this information, it's more likely that Matt went on to compete in another marathon later that year than that he returned to playing the piano."
"Response: 
B) Susie was upset.
Explanation: In this story, Susie was excited when she called her grandma to ask for banana bread, but a week later when her grandma surprisingly came to visit, Susie was upset because she had been looking forward to receiving the banana bread from her grandma. This suggests that Susie valued the gift of banana bread from her grandma more than just a casual visit."
"Response: 
B: The baby grew up to be healthy and strong. 
Explanation: In this story, Jon and Mika are worried about their baby's health because she has complications. However, there is no indication in the story that the baby will die or have any long-term health problems. Instead, it seems more likely that the baby will grow up to be healthy and strong. This is supported by the fact that babies with complications can often recover fully with proper medical care. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B: Brendon couldn't believe he was soaking wet. 
Explanation: The story states that Brendon ""went to sit down"" after falling, which implies that he landed on a wet surface. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
Response:  Option B: Cara left for Vegas.  This option is most likely because it does not make sense that Cara would leave for Vegas after she has just spent time moving things around in her garage to prepare for a garage sale. It also doesn't align with the context of the story, as there is no indication that Cara has any plans or reasons to go to Las Vegas.
"Response: 
B - They were having a Christmas party at the exit.
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it seems unlikely that there would be a witch waiting at the end of the haunted house. Haunted houses are typically designed to create fear and suspense through dark corridors, creepy sounds, and unexpected scares. Having a Christmas party at the exit would be a strange and unexpected twist, which is more likely to happen in this type of setting."
"Response:  Option B: Lorraine is disappointed. 
Explanation: In this story, Lorraine's mother compliments the biscuit, indicating that Lorraine has not yet achieved perfection in making them. This suggests that Lorraine may be disappointed that her efforts have not resulted in the desired outcome, despite her taking a whole month off from work."
"Response: 
B: The poem made Lucy's mom feel better."
"Response: 
B: The meal Joe prepared was piping hot."
"Response: 
Option A: Many people viewed Jake's skits. "
"Response:

"Response: 
B - They returned many times. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Kelly and her friends enjoyed their experience at the Indian restaurant and returned multiple times. The fact that they were the first ones inside and appreciated the food suggests that they had a positive dining experience. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - He poured the majority of it down the drain of the sink. 
Explanation: The story states that Levi ""poor(ed) the wax into the molds."" This implies that he handled the wax carefully and did not waste any of it. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that he poured the majority of the wax down the drain, which goes against the tone of the story."
"Response: 
B: Returned the TV."
"Response: 
B - Dennis did not have fun.
Explanation: The story states that Dennis initially did poorly in the competition and fell off a lot. This suggests that he may not have been enjoying himself at this point. Additionally, the fact that he only improved later on does not necessarily mean that he had fun throughout the entire competition. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option A: The next year his garden was beautiful and healthy. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Ben's garden improved after adding compost to the soil. The story mentions that Ben's garden was not very good before, but after starting a compost pile and adding leaves to the soil, his garden became beautiful and healthy the following year. This suggests that the composting process helped improve the quality of the soil, leading to better plant growth and overall healthier conditions for his garden."
"Response: 
B - Joe started eating the pizza before the delivery man left. "
Response:  Option A: He came back with the popcorn. 
"Response: 
B) She accepted the food, and asked them all to leave. 
Explanation: Mary did not want to host the party herself, so she accepted the food and drinks that her friends brought but then asked them all to leave. This option is more likely because it aligns with the context of the situation where Mary wants to avoid hosting the party herself."
"Response: 
B) Jim was frightened by his gunfire. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Jim has used a powerful weapon to shoot at a large group of birds, resulting in two hundred dead animals. This would likely cause significant distress and concern for Jim, as he may realize that his actions have caused harm to innocent creatures and potentially damaged their habitat. It's unlikely that Jim would feel pleased or satisfied with what he has done, but rather anxious about the consequences of his actions. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
"Response: 
B) She wore a ripped shirt the next day. 
Explanation: The story states that Janice decided to dress more formally after her promotion, but then it says she wore a ripped shirt the next day. This suggests that Janice may not have fully committed to the new, more formal style she had intended. It's possible that she was too comfortable or didn't want to spend money on nicer clothes, so she reverted back to her old casual attire."
"Response: 
B) Juanita continued to take pictures. 
Explanation:  The story states that Juanita ""loved peacefully rowing the canoe before anyone else was awake."" It also mentions that she was taking pictures of the stork when she fell in the water. Therefore, it's more likely that she would continue to take pictures rather than getting back in the boat immediately."
"Response: 
B: Jody became a manager and succeeded. 
Explanation: The story states that Jody's boss noticed her efforts and gave her a promotion, indicating that she successfully earned the new position. It is unlikely that Jody would be fired immediately after being recognized for her hard work, especially since her boss chose to reward her with a promotion instead. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B - Charlie changed his bad habits. 
Explanation: 
The story states that Charlie's family rushed him to the vet after he stole a large pizza. This suggests that Charlie's behavior was problematic enough that his family sought professional help. It is unlikely that Charlie continued to steal food without any consequences, so option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Sara was fired. 
Explanation: The passage states that Sue's boss, Cara, accused Sue of something (putting too many people on a shift), which suggests that Cara may have been mistaken or biased. When Sue provided evidence to dispute this accusation, it seems unlikely that Cara would apologize instead of taking responsibility for their mistake. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
B) She ate all her meals in the cabin while on vacation. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Nora ate all her meals in the cabin while on vacation rather than having a picnic by the stream. The story mentions that the cabin was ""beautiful,"" ""set in the woods,"" and ""beside a stream,"" which suggests that it was a cozy and secluded location where she could enjoy her meals indoors."
"Response: 
B) Marcy stopped talking to her friend.
Explanation: In this scenario, Marcy has been relying on her friend for help in communicating with strangers, but when her friend suggests that she use a pen and paper to communicate instead of relying on her all the time, Marcy becomes upset and stops talking to her friend altogether. This outcome is more likely because Marcy may feel embarrassed or frustrated about needing help from others, and may not want to admit that she cannot communicate effectively without assistance."
"Response: 
B: Sharon couldn't wait for Fancy to go. 
Explanation: The story states that schnauzers typically don't live as long as other breeds, which suggests that their lifespan is relatively short. This implies that Sharon may be eager for Fancy to pass away so that she doesn't have to deal with the emotional burden of losing her beloved pet. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B. Keith's yacht hit the reefs at high speed. 
Explanation:  Since Keith lives in an area with occasional earthquakes, it is unlikely that his car would be involved in an accident caused by an earthquake. However, since he does not have a first aid kit, he may need medical attention for his injured hand after the accident. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
B: Sean loved the outdoors.
Explanation: The story states that Sean ""wanted to go out for a picnic"" and then ""rid[e] his bike off to a field,"" which suggests that he enjoys spending time outside and in nature. Additionally, the fact that he packed a basket with food implies that he is comfortable preparing and eating meals in an outdoor setting. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - The parents had another baby.  
Explanation:  The story does not provide any information that would suggest the parents were unhappy or unenthusiastic about having another child after their first daughter. In fact, it explicitly states that they were ""somewhat less enthused"" about their second child, which implies that they were still excited and eager to welcome another addition to their family. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Chris was excited to get caught.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems unlikely that Chris would beg for mercy after getting caught stealing. Instead, it appears that Chris may have been eager or excited to get caught, perhaps because they were hoping to avoid consequences or because they saw stealing as a thrilling adventure. Without additional context or evidence, it is difficult to say with certainty which option is most likely, but based on the information given, option B seems more plausible than option A."
"Response: 
B) Rene then played games.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Rene's friend Jack offered to lend him money so that he could continue playing games. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome as Rene would have taken advantage of Jack's offer and continued playing games."
"Response: 
B - Neil decided he never wanted to go to Bangkok again. 
Explanation: The story highlighted how enjoyable Neil found his time in Bangkok, with its ""delicious local foods"" and ""wonderful souvenirs."" However, despite enjoying himself, Neil ultimately decides that he doesn't want to return to Bangkok again. This suggests that while he may have enjoyed his initial experience, it didn't leave him wanting more or eager to revisit the city."
"Response: 
B: Amy was pleased. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Amy took the initiative to style her hair in a different way by purchasing a flat iron straightener. Although it rained and her hair got wet, she remained positive and happy with her decision. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - We walk in and the food is on the table right away. 
Explanation: The story mentions that the restaurant is a favorite of both the speaker and his girlfriend, and that they go there frequently. This suggests that the restaurant has good service and is able to accommodate repeat customers quickly and efficiently. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: And he decided that it was his calling to fight crime. 
Explanation:  The fact that Mike got shot while on duty suggests that he is already committed to fighting crime as a police officer. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the character."
"Response: 
B: Tracy's apprehensions about marriage were confirmed. 
Explanation:  The story reveals that Tracy had doubts about marriage before meeting Doug, which suggests that she may have been hesitant or skeptical about committing to him. When Doug breaks his wedding vows, it confirms Tracy's fears about the instability of marital relationships, making option B the more likely choice."
"Response: 
B - Joseph went downstairs and got an ice cream. 
Explanation: The story states that Joseph was feeling overwhelmed by the number of books available, which suggests that he may not have been in the mood for reading. Given this context, it is more likely that he would go downstairs to get something else to eat or do, rather than simply closing his eyes and picking a book without considering any other factors."
"Response: 
B - Neil was bored of the trip and went home.
Explanation: The story states that Neil ""loved Dublin"" but then suddenly says he saw the Book of Kells at Trinity College, which suggests that he took a day trip outside of the city. This implies that he got bored with his initial experience in Dublin and decided to explore something new. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: They didn't like the beach anymore.
Explanation: The story states that Ray's girlfriend went into the water for a bit, but it doesn't say she enjoyed it. It also mentions that Ray likes to read a book and listen to music on his MP3 player, which suggests he prefers indoor activities. Therefore, it is more likely that they didn't enjoy their time at the beach as much as they thought they would."
"Response: 
B - Then I took the tire off and left him stranded. 
Explanation: This option is more likely because it goes against the expected outcome of helping someone in need. It also adds an element of irony or unexpected twist, which can make the story more interesting."
"Response:  Option B: Grace was happy about the ice. 
Explanation:  In this story, the unexpected event of the power cutting out resulted in all the ice melting. While some people might be disappointed by this turn of events, Grace seems to have taken it in stride and even found it fortunate that there was no more ice left in the freezer. This suggests that she may not have been too attached to the frozen ice and was instead relieved at the opportunity to use fresh water instead."
"Response: 
B: Harrison was happy and excited. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Harrison has just scored a crucial point for his team, leading them to victory. It's natural for him to feel elated and joyful about this achievement, so option B is the more likely choice. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that Harrison became angry or upset with Emily, which doesn't align with the context of the situation."
"Response: 
B - Sally could not buy anything without any money.
Explanation: In this scenario, Sally did not have enough money to purchase something with the gift cards she received as a prize. This outcome is more likely because many people do not always have sufficient funds available for making purchases, especially if they are unexpectedly awarded a prize or gift."
"Response: 
B: Fred enjoyed reading stories from his past.
Explanation: The passage states that Fred ""references"" the diary to see how he spent his time, which implies that he enjoys looking back on his memories. It also mentions that Fred reads stories from his past, further indicating that he finds pleasure in reflecting on his experiences. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."

B: Joss considered the exchange student to be like a sister."
"Response: 
B - They all had fun. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that everyone involved enjoyed themselves during the gathering. There is no indication of any negative feelings or conflicts, which suggests that they had a good time. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: It's nice to relax and reminisce.
Explanation: The story suggests that the speaker enjoys spending time with their father, even if they don't enjoy watching baseball together. They find it pleasant to reminisce about the past and spend quality time with their parent, which indicates a positive attitude towards this activity. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: They were so quiet, I had to call the police. 
Explanation: The story states that the neighbors promised to be quieter after being asked, but they ended up being even noisier. This suggests that they may not have taken the request seriously or may have been intentionally causing a disturbance. In this case, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Threw it in the trash. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Robbie was satisfied with his purchase or that he would wear the hat frequently. In fact, the story states that he got the last one, which implies that he may have been disappointed that he couldn't find more hats like it. Additionally, the fact that he drove an hour to get the hat suggests that he may have been particularly invested in finding the perfect hat, so throwing it away after trying it on once seems like an unlikely outcome."
"Response: 
B - He did not drive under the influence."
"Response: 
B) Francisco became a good skier."
"Response: 
B: Sal felt great."
"Response: 
B - Surprise! They found it on the street she parked it. 
Explanation: In this story, Alycia parked her car on the street before heading out with her friends. When she returned, she couldn't find her car in its original location. This suggests that someone or something moved her car while she was gone. Option B is the more likely outcome because it provides an unexpected twist to the story by revealing that Alycia's car was still in the same place where she parked it, despite her initial confusion about its disappearance."
"Response: 
B - Relieved
Explanation: In this story, Katie's mother says that the goat is in the backyard, which means that Katie will not have to search for it far away from home. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it indicates that Katie is relieved rather than disappointed about finding the goat in the backyard."
"Response: 
B: The police told them to keep playing.
Explanation: In this scenario, the police are more likely to tell the two bands to continue playing rather than stopping them. This is because they may view the impromptu jam session as a cultural exchange or performance, rather than a disturbance. Additionally, the police may be hesitant to intervene in a situation where people are simply enjoying music and each other's company."
"Response: 
B - Eric couldn't return Bill's hit and lost the match. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bill has already hit the ball back towards Eric, so there is no opportunity for Eric to hit the ball with a baseball bat (option A). Therefore, the most likely outcome is that Eric will not be able to return Bill's hit and will lose the match (option B)."
"Response: 
B - Gina's mother took out a loan to cover the expenses."
"Response: 
B: The squirrels began to come to her house more often. 
Explanation:  In this story, the person (the mother) is actively feeding the squirrels peanuts, which has caused an increase in their population near her home. It is unlikely that she would suddenly stop feeding them or scare them away, as doing so would cause harm to the animals and create a negative outcome for both parties involved. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - She soon learned to ride. 
Explanation: The story states that the narrator helped their niece learn how to ride the bicycle by holding the bike, which suggests that they were able to successfully teach her how to ride. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."

B) Gina was worried about her parents finding out."
"Response: 
B: Alicia was happy to be leaving her old house."
"Response: 
Option B: Brian had to admit he didn't really like their cat very much. "
"Response: 
B) I loved the new raincoat I bought.
Explanation: The story mentions that the person ""walked away"" when they put the chicken in the oven, which suggests that they were not paying close attention to it. This implies that they are careless or forgetful, which is consistent with option B (I loved the new raincoat I bought). Option A (I ordered pizza to eat instead) does not fit with this character's behavior as it would require them to be more proactive and responsible about their meal."
"Response: 
B: Laura had a good day in class that day. "
"Response: 
B - Ray ran to his daughter to make sure she was okay. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Ray's priority would be to check if his daughter is injured or not, rather than laughing at the situation. His concern for her safety would drive him to act quickly and responsibly. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
B) They got into the plane. 
Explanation: The story mentions that the girls went out for drinks, which implies that they are at a bar or club. It also mentions that they closed their tab, which means they paid their bill and left the establishment. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story, as it suggests that the girls left the bar and got on a plane to go somewhere else. Option A does not make sense in this context, as there would be no reason for them to talk about their night after leaving the bar."
Response:  Option B: I stopped talking and went home. This is because faking it or using big words without proper preparation can lead to confusion, miscommunication, or even embarrassment. It's important to be honest and authentic when communicating with others, rather than trying to impress them with empty rhetoric.
"Response: 
B: He gave the parents a prescription, which they filled promptly. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Miss Jio has already determined that Nate needs medication, and she has informed his parents of her decision. Therefore, it is more likely that the parents will fill the prescription rather than sending Nate to counseling."
"Response: 
B) She invited all her friends to join her at that restaurant. 
Explanation:  In this situation, Alice's favorite Italian restaurant has closed down, but instead of being upset or settling for a different type of food, she decides to invite all her friends to join her at another restaurant. This shows that she values her social connections and wants to share her experience with others, rather than simply accepting the loss of her favorite eatery."
"Response: 
B - Threw the noodles in the trash."
Response:  Option A: He finally found it in the garage.  This option is more likely because Pete's frustration and anxiety about losing the contract suggest that he would search for it thoroughly before giving up, rather than taking an impromptu trip to Las Vegas without any apparent reason or connection to the situation at hand.
"Response: 
B) He was so happy that he did and loved the park even more. 
Explanation: The story states that Fred faced his fears by riding the fastest and scariest roller coaster at the park, which suggests that he overcame his anxiety and enjoyed the experience. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - The company gave Wendy a full refund and apology."
"Response: 
B: He spit out his beer.
Explanation: The story states that Jackson ""knew that alcohol was unhealthy"" and could impair judgment, which suggests that he has concerns about its effects on his health and well-being. Given this information, it is more likely that he would spit out his beer rather than having another one."
"Response: 
B - The frog was still hungry.
Explanation: In this story, the frog successfully approached the fly but failed to catch it due to its quickness. This means that the frog's hunger remains unfulfilled, making option B the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: She yelled at him. 
Explanation: Oscar's decision to finally make his bed pleased his mother, but she still had to scold him for not doing it earlier. It is more likely that she would yell at him than give him a dessert treat for something he should have been doing all along."
"Response: 
B - The snake bit me. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's more likely that the snake would bite you than for you to run towards it. Snakes are generally defensive animals and will only attack if they feel threatened or cornered. Running towards a snake can be seen as an aggressive move and may provoke it into striking. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome in this scenario."
"Response: 
B) He decided he needed to do something about his addiction."
"Response: 
B - She stormed out, claiming I always change the topic.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it's common for people who are uncomfortable with discussions about serious topics like illness or trauma to become defensive or avoidant. Your cousin may have felt awkward or embarrassed by your revelation and decided to leave rather than continue the conversation."
"Response: 
B: Matthew's mother put Matthew in his time-out corner."
"Response: 
B - Tine sat on the couch and ate bonbons instead of trying out. This option is most likely because it goes against what Tine did in the story. In the story, Tine ran for miles every morning for a month before tryouts, which suggests that she put in a lot of effort to prepare. It's unlikely that she would have given up and eaten bonbons instead."
"Response: 
B: It was a deer that I was able to stalk and shoot successfully."
"Response: 
B: Jack was able to climb without any discomfort.
Explanation: The story states that Jack ""paused to take a picture,"" which suggests he may have been taking his time and not feeling any discomfort from the needles in his pants. Additionally, there is no mention of Jack experiencing pain or difficulty while continuing to climb, further indicating that he was not affected by the needles."
"Response: 
B - Lynn told Jim that he is unattractive.
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that Lynn would be embarrassed or uncomfortable around her crush than confidently tell him she finds him attractive. The fact that they are in a public place and she is talking to him as part of a group also suggests that she may not want to draw attention to herself by expressing admiration for him directly. Therefore option B is the more plausible outcome."
"Response: 
B) Riley stopped being friends. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Riley's decision to undergo a makeover in an attempt to fit in with her peers ultimately leads to her losing her only friend. This outcome suggests that conforming to societal standards of beauty can have negative consequences, such as alienating oneself from others who may value individuality and uniqueness."
"Response: 
B) Ann is relieved she is not pregnant.  
Explanation:  Miscarriages are often emotionally challenging experiences for expectant mothers. While some women may experience grief or sadness after a miscarriage, others may feel relieved that they no longer have to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. In this case, Ann's relief at not being pregnant suggests that she did not want to be pregnant and may have been feeling overwhelmed or anxious about her situation before the miscarriage occurred."
"Response: 
B: Aya was very upset about the outcome of the contest. 
Explanation: The story states that Aya ""thought she had a chance"" to win the contest, implying that she expected to do well but did not expect to win. When she actually wins, it comes as a surprise and causes her to be upset."
"Response: 
B: His parents threw him out of the house. 
Explanation: Jared's actions were not in line with what his parents expected, and as a result, they took away his privilege of being at home by throwing him out of the house. This outcome is more likely than option A, where his parents give him extra days off for good behavior."
"Response: 
B - Anna went to the club and danced all night long. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Anna having a legal case against the driver who hit her, so option A (Anna sued them but got nothing because they had no insurance) is unlikely. Instead, the story suggests that Anna continued with her daily activities after the accident, which is consistent with option B (Anna went to the club and danced all night long)."
"Response:  Option B: Dave was so relieved! 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Dave's initial excitement about spending a day at the beach is contrasted with his relief when he realizes that the storm clouds will prevent him from going outdoors after all. This suggests that Dave values safety more than leisure time, which makes option B the more plausible choice."
"Response: 
Option B - They both purchased sports cars with the money.  
Explanation: The story states that Ron had saved all his overtime pay and had lots of cash. This suggests that he and Kim were able to afford something expensive, such as sports cars, rather than just purchasing a new home. Additionally, the fact that they are able to start shopping for a new home shortly after saving their overtime pay further supports this option."
"Response: 
B - Most people liked Cover A."
"Response: 
B: The cat rejected the new post made of sisal. "
"Response: 
B) Daniel had to get an actual job. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Daniel's lack of success with his website is due to the fact that he isn't getting enough traffic or attention to his site. This suggests that he needs to do more marketing or promotion to attract more visitors, which may be time-consuming and difficult. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as Daniel may need to take on other jobs or responsibilities to support himself while he continues to work on his writing career."
"Response: 
B - Gary thanked me for my thoughtfulness. "
"Response: 
B: We had a wonderful time camping."
Response:  Option A: I liked getting a good deal.  This option is more plausible because it aligns with the context of the story, which involves shopping and finding deals. Throwing a bowling ball on the counter would not be a typical action in this scenario.
"Response: 
Option A: Joey finally received a call from an employer and got the job."
"Response: 
B) He was much happier now that he had some companions in his life. 
Explanation: The story states that Joe was lonely before and found companionship through Craigslist. This suggests that having social interactions with others can improve one's happiness. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - It helped her mental state immensely.  
Explanation: The story suggests that Amy found meditation helpful in reducing her stress levels, which means that option B is the more likely outcome. While Option A could be possible if Amy discovered a passion for teaching meditation, the text does not provide any indication of this happening. Therefore, option B is the more plausible conclusion to the story."
"Response: 
B - Nya later regretted eating unhealthy food. 
Explanation:  In this story, Nya made an impulsive decision to eat unhealthy food despite her efforts to maintain a healthy diet. This suggests that she may experience negative consequences or regret after indulging in such food. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: She hoped she would soon be sick again. 
Explanation: The fact that her symptoms improved by the end of the day suggests that she may have been experiencing a minor illness or infection, rather than a serious one. Therefore, it is more likely that she will experience another episode of illness in the near future."
"Response: 
B - The view was great and Ted was happy they had come. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Ted and his friends reached the summit of the mountain and enjoyed the view than that they turned around and went back home after only two hours of hiking."
Response:  Option A: A tornado came within 2 blocks of the house!  This option best completes the story because it provides an exciting and unexpected twist that aligns with the sudden change in weather described in the passage. It also creates a sense of urgency and danger, which fits with the tone of a tornado warning.
"Response: 
B - I went home and practiced drawing. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that the person will continue practicing drawing after buying the necessary supplies than decide not to pursue it further."
"Response: 
B: Lisa got a degree in business.
Explanation: The story states that Lisa ""finally"" dropped out of school, indicating that this decision came after some time and consideration. It also mentions that her friends and family told her it was crazy to leave school, implying that they were opposed to her decision. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as Lisa decided to continue with her original plan of getting a degree in business despite her reservations about the field."
"Response: 
B: Mary's friends were very disappointed in her. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Mary broke the rules by sneaking out of the house to see a late-night movie without permission from her parents. Her actions may have been exciting or thrilling for her, but they were not respectful or responsible towards her parents who trusted and cared for her. It is likely that her friends would be disappointed in her for disobeying her parents and putting herself in a potentially dangerous situation without their knowledge or consent."
"Response: 
B - Ivy returned home, and never spoke to Peter again. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Ivy and Peter shared a romantic connection or that their hike was anything more than a casual outdoor activity. Therefore, it is most likely that Ivy returned home after the hike without speaking to Peter again."
"Response: 
B - The man built the tower and it was grand. 
Explanation:  
The story implies that the man has experience and knowledge of building structures, as he has drawn detailed plans for the tower. Therefore, option B is more likely, where the man builds the tower according to his designs and it turns out well. Option A is less likely, as if the man were not a building designer, he would not have been able to create such detailed plans."
"Response: 
B - She tore the picture up and threw it away.
Explanation: The story states that Lauren wants a picture with her sisters, but then proceeds to tear it up and throw it away. This suggests that she may have had some negative feelings towards her relationship with her sisters or the memories associated with them. It's unlikely that she would gawk at how much she looks like them, as the story doesn't provide any indication of such a reaction. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Option B: When she heard him giggling from a closet, Liz was relieved.  This option best completes the story because it explains why Liz was able to find the child after searching the entire house. If Liz had grown bored with the game (option A), there would be no reason for her to continue looking for the child. Similarly, if she had given up hope of finding him (not specified in the story), there would be no sense of relief when she finally located him in the closet. Therefore, option B provides the most logical conclusion to the story.
"Response: 
B: Mark was early for work. "
"Response: 
B: Amy showed little interest in the flute. 
Explanation:  In this story, Amy expressed an initial desire to play the flute but then struggled with it when she started practicing. This suggests that she may not have been as interested in playing the flute as she initially claimed. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: Bryan decided to buy bananas."
"Response: 
B - Emily picked up her child to comfort him. 
Explanation: In this situation, it is more likely that Emily would pick up her child to comfort him rather than letting him walk closer to the lions. As a parent, Emily wants to keep her child safe and secure, so she will take steps to calm him down and protect him from any potential danger. Letting her child get too close to the lions could be dangerous for both of them, so option B is the more logical choice."
"Response: 
B: Kim was upset when her family got a puppy. 
Explanation: The story states that Kim ""practiced all day at home"" and ""practiced in the gym after school with her team."" This suggests that Kim is very dedicated to basketball, and may be disappointed or upset if something else interferes with her ability to play. Additionally, the fact that getting a puppy is an unexpected surprise for Kim's family further supports this answer choice."
"Response: 
B: Karen felt unmotivated after hearing the speech. 
Explanation: The story states that Karen's team wasn't doing very well before the coach gave an inspiring speech, but it doesn't say anything about how Karen herself was performing. It's possible that she may have been motivated by the speech, but without more information, it's also possible that she simply felt unmotivated or unchanged by it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Kayla told the therapist she was suicidal and asked for help. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is most likely that Kayla revealed her suicidal thoughts to the therapist during their session. This is because the story mentions that Kayla has been struggling with crippling anxiety for a long time, which can often lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair. It also suggests that Kayla's anxiety has become so severe that she is having difficulty interacting with others, which could further contribute to her feelings of isolation and distress. Given these factors, it seems plausible that Kayla would feel overwhelmed enough to disclose her suicidal thoughts to the therapist, who can then provide appropriate support and intervention."
"Response: 
B) Ricky was soaking wet from falling in the pond. 
Explanation: In this story, Ricky falls while hiking in the woods, which suggests that he may have gotten injured or lost. The fact that he uses his nature guide to identify a plant suggests that he is trying to figure out where he is and what might be dangerous around him. Since he is soaked wet after falling in a pond, it is more likely that option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: My husband is so disappointed!
Explanation: The story states that Blue Belle ice cream was recalled and stopped production, which means it's unlikely that my husband would be grateful for its return. Instead, he might be disappointed that his favorite ice cream is no longer available or that it took so long for it to come back in stock."
"Response: 
B - The talent show told Oni to never come back.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that the talent show did not go well for Oni and he was asked not to return. The fact that Oni had never performed before an audience and only gave it his ""best try"" suggests that he may have been nervous or unsure of himself, which could have led to a poor performance. Additionally, the fact that everyone clapped for him after he finished singing implies that they were polite but unimpressed, rather than enthusiastic about his performance. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: He is surprised when his mom gives him money for helping. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Ralph's mother recognizes that he helped her with the grocery shopping despite not wanting to do it, so she rewards him by giving him money. This shows that she appreciates his effort and values his contribution, which could encourage him to be more helpful in the future. Option A, on the other hand, would be less likely as it goes against the idea of rewarding someone for doing something they don't want to do."
"Response: 
B: Her sister was mad!"
"Response: 
B - When he got home, he prepared to return his three movies. 
Explanation: The story states that Lenny rented three horror movies, which suggests that he intended to keep them for an extended period of time. However, when he gets home, he prepares to return them, indicating that he does not plan on keeping them forever. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Laura then became elected by the country.
Explanation:  In this scenario, the fact that Laura shared about burning bras in the 1960s did not result in any negative consequences for her political career. Instead, it actually helped her gain support from the audience, who were inspired by her boldness and willingness to share such a personal detail. This suggests that the public views Laura as someone who is authentic and unafraid to speak her mind, which could be an asset in a presidential campaign. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Charlie vowed to change things if he was ever made chief. 
Explanation:  Charlie did not start taking bribes, as this would have been illegal and unethical behavior for him. Instead, he chose to focus on making positive changes from within the organization by working towards becoming the Chief of Police. This option aligns more closely with Charlie's character traits and motivations, as well as the overall tone of the story."
"Response: 
B: Our dog feels much better playing with another dog. 
Explanation: In this story, the younger dog is described as being ""very lonely"" after the death of its older companion.

Explanation: In this story, my friend (the protagonist) takes the MCAT exam twice in order to improve her score. After studying hard and retaking the test, she does much better on the second attempt. As a result of her improved performance, we (her friends) take her out to drinks to celebrate her success. Option B is the more likely outcome because it reflects the positive and supportive nature of the friendship."
"Response: 
B - Kelly was very happy to have soaking wet clothes."
"Response: 
B - Ben asked his grandfather if they could watch a movie instead. 
Explanation: Based on the story, it seems that Ben did not enjoy the experience of fishing with his grandfather. Given that he found putting worms on the hook to be disgusting and accidentally pricked his finger with one of the hooks, it's unlikely that he would want to do it again. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as Ben asks his grandfather if they can watch a movie instead."
"Response: 
B - Amelia was very happy. 
Explanation:  The story states that Amelia's friend had set her up on a blind date, which means she didn't know much about the person she would be meeting. However, since she got to the restaurant early and waited for her date without any signs of anxiety or disappointment, it suggests that she was feeling optimistic and excited about the possibility of meeting someone new. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: The boy left without getting his picture taken.
Explanation: In this scenario, the mother used the information about Santa being responsible for bringing presents as a way to convince the child to sit with Santa. However, since the child was initially scared and refused, it is more likely that they would leave without getting their picture taken rather than changing their mind and hoping to receive presents from Santa."
"Response: 
B) Stewart was glad that he remembered to keep the fire going."
"Response: 
Option B: Anthony could not get the language down properly. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Anthony's success in learning Spanish. In fact, it states that Anthony ""could not get the language down properly."" Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Anthony."

B: Joanie ran outside to confront her brother. "
"Response: 
B: Soon all her friends had arranged their beds the same way. 
Explanation: In this story, when Cornelia rearranges her bed, her friends notice and like the new arrangement. This leads them to also want to rearrange their own beds in a similar way. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B: Tim is scared to ride his motorcycle. 
Explanation: The story states that Tim ""wrecked"" his motorcycle, which suggests that he had an accident while riding it. This implies that Tim may be afraid to ride his motorcycle again after the accident, as he no longer feels safe doing so. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Wendy enjoyed seeing the photos. 
Explanation: The story states that Wendy ""really enjoyed"" looking at the pictures of the little old lady's children. This suggests that she found them interesting or touching, rather than upsetting her. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Tom and Jake enjoyed the nice view.
Explanation: The story states that Tom and Jake are in the general admission area, which means they are close to the stage. If there are very tall people blocking their view, it is unlikely that they would be able to enjoy the show. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Lester went out and got the best cell phone he could afford. 
Explanation: The story states that Lester ""wished he had a phone"" when his car had a flat tire, indicating that he now wants to be able to contact for help in emergencies. This desire is more likely to lead him to get a cell phone rather than continue without one."
"Response: 
Option B: Ben sold his kidney for crack. "
"Response: 
B - I came home and ate pizza."
"Response: 
B - Now Anna has a diverse tank with fish and coral. 
Explanation:  The story states that Anna initially only kept coral in her saltwater fish tank but then decided she wanted some fish as well. This implies that Anna already had experience caring for coral before adding fish to her tank. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, as it suggests that Anna now has a diverse tank with both fish and coral. Option A is unlikely because there is no indication in the story that Anna ever returned the fish to the store."
"Response: 
B - Lee decided to adopt the kitten."
"Response: 
Option B: Bob returned everything the next day. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems unlikely that Bob would enjoy his shopping trip enough to keep all of the items he bought. Instead, it's more likely that he may have purchased more than he intended or wanted, and then decided to return some or all of those items the next day."
"Response: 
Option A: Jamal Lewis gave him personal advice and wished him the best.  
Explanation:  It's unlikely that a famous athlete like Jamal Lewis would tell a young fan to stay far away from them, especially if they are in public. More likely, he would be flattered by the fan's enthusiasm and give them some words of encouragement or advice."
"Response: 
Option B: But she didn't want the robin anymore. 
Explanation: Ella took good care of the robin, but after some time, she realized that she didn't want to keep it as a pet anymore. This option is more likely because people may change their minds about caring for an animal once they get used to it or realize that it requires too much attention and effort."
"Response: 
B: I go back to work at my job tomorrow. 
Explanation: The story states ""I quit my job,"" which means that the protagonist has already left their job and is no longer employed there. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as the protagonist would need to return to work at their job tomorrow. Option A is not possible, as the protagonist has already fulfilled their resolution by quitting their job."
"Response: 
B) The flower eventually dried up and fell off the vase."
"Response: 
B: Ben was happy after getting the call from the bank. 
Explanation: When Ben received the call from the bank informing him of the overdraft fee, it meant that he could now pay off the fee and avoid any further charges or penalties. This would make him happy as he could now take care of the issue without incurring additional costs. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - The patron didn't understand Chris because he only spoke Chinese."
"Response: 
Option A: I learned a lot from Google. 
Explanation: The story suggests that the speaker had a positive experience with Google when they were young. They enjoyed using the website and learned a lot from it. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) He realized he needed to quit his job."
"Response: 
B - His owner began running 12 miles a day.  
Explanation: The story states that Ritz's owner got cancer, which suggests that they may have been dealing with serious health issues. In this situation, it is more likely that the owner would begin running long distances as part of their treatment plan rather than giving up on Ritz and sending him to a shelter. Running can help improve overall health and well-being, including reducing stress and boosting endurance, making it a common activity for people undergoing cancer treatment."
"Response: 
B: Mia wished she could be indoors. 
Explanation: The story states that Mia loves being outdoors, but after climbing the tallest mountain in her area, she wishes she could be indoors. This suggests that while she enjoyed the experience, she may have preferred to be inside where it was cooler or more comfortable. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Fred's coworker who saw him assault his boss called the police.
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that Fred's coworker would call the police after witnessing him physically assaulting his boss than for the boss to give him a hug. The act of violence committed by Fred against his boss could lead to legal consequences, which is why option B is the more plausible outcome."
"Response: 
B: She was glad to hear that. 
Explanation: The story states that the speaker's sister-in-law is trying to save money, which suggests that she may be looking for ways to reduce her expenses. Given this context, it is unlikely that she would buy more cable boxes, as this would only increase her costs. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Victor realizes he has left his sweatshirt at the gym. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that suggests Victor will continue to buy pistachios regularly. In fact, it mentions him only buying one jar, which implies that this was an isolated incident for him. On the other hand, the mention of Victor leaving his sweatshirt at the gym indicates that this is something he may do frequently or consistently, given that he forgets it there after just one visit. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A."
"Response: 
B - They ended up being huge plants.
Explanation: The story states that Sharon ""put them in planters"" which implies that she expected the seedlings to grow into smaller plants. However, since the story also mentions that Sharon was ""wrong in her assumption"", it suggests that the seedlings grew much larger than anticipated. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) She drove her car to the mechanic to get it looked at. "
"Response: 
B - Tom loved the idea of a fast.
Explanation: The story states that Tom was ""tired of everyday life,"" suggesting that he may be seeking a more adventurous or spiritual experience. When he runs out of water, rather than immediately returning to society, he suffers for two days without finding any. This suggests that he has embraced the challenge of living off the grid and is willing to endure hardship in pursuit of his goal. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Tim worked hard in school to become one. "
"Response: 
B - My sister was hiding something from us.
Explanation: The fact that your sister is dressing up for Saint Patrick's Day on the center's calendar suggests that she may be trying to hide something from you. This could be anything from a personal secret to a problem at work, which makes option B the more likely choice. Option A seems unlikely because it doesn't provide any evidence or clues that would suggest your sister is hiding something."
"Response: 
B - Fred was very happy. 
Explanation:  When the stock price increased from $90 to $100 after good earnings, Fred's investment appreciated in value by $10 per share or 11.1%. This means that if he owned 100 shares of Apple, his total investment would have grown by $1000 (10 x 100 = 1000). As a result, Fred would be very happy with this outcome."
"Response: 
B) Jen lost the spelling bee.
Explanation: The story states that ""When the Bee started, Jen survived as others got knocked out."" This implies that Jen did well initially but eventually lost the competition. Additionally, the fact that it comes down to just two contestants suggests that there are only a few words left to spell, which means that one of them (Jen or her opponent) will ultimately lose. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Kelly is agoraphobic."
"Response: 
B - She was fortunately able to get back to the beach house safely. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it's more likely that Emily was able to find shelter or escape the storm safely rather than continuing to enjoy her day at the beach despite the dangerous conditions."
"Response: 
B: They drank the alcohol and got drunk. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Andrew and his friends consumed the alcohol from their parents' secret stash and became intoxicated as a result. The fact that Andrew's parents are out of town for the week suggests that they may have left behind some alcohol for emergencies or special occasions, which could be what Andrew's friends were after. Additionally, the fact that Andrew's friends wanted to drink implies that they were looking for an opportunity to consume alcohol, which they found by raiding Andrew's parents' stash. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Ellen was perfectly comfortable. 
Explanation: The story states that Ellen ""got very cold"" when the power went out, but then it says she was ""perfectly comfortable."" This suggests that Ellen adapted to the situation by finding ways to stay warm or cozy despite the lack of electricity. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Jose threw away his skateboard. "
Response:  Option B: Mike started laughing hysterically.  This is because the symptoms described in the passage are not typical of a stroke, which is a serious medical condition that can cause sudden weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, sudden vision loss, dizziness, or loss of balance, and more. Instead, the itching sensations described in the passage are more consistent with an unusual physical reaction, such as laughter.
"Response: 
B) They fixed her car and sent her on her way."
"Response: 
B) She was happy he asked her to the dance."
"Response: 
B - This was my new favorite restaurant.
Explanation: The story highlights the excitement and positive experience of trying a new restaurant for the first time. The use of words like ""super,"" ""amazing,"" and ""new favorite"" suggest that the speaker enjoyed their visit and would be willing to return. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: She was pleased with the results. 
Explanation: Cindy wanted a more calming atmosphere in her room, so painting the walls blue seemed like a good solution. Since she chose this option, it is likely that she was indeed pleased with the results."
"Response:  Option A: I was very excited. 
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist won first place, which suggests that they are happy about it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Helen went down to the lake to rent a jet-ski. 
Explanation: The story mentions that it snowed the night before, which suggests that it was cold outside. Renting a jet-ski would not be something Helen would do on a cold day, especially if there is already snow on the ground. Additionally, the story does not provide any indication that Helen has a reason to go to the lake other than to rent a jet-ski. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
Option B: Dan was ashamed of his father. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Dan is ashamed of his father than that he admires him. Dan's statement about his father being his inspiration could be interpreted as a negative comment, suggesting that Dan does not have a positive relationship with his father."
"Response: 
B: Jeremy's demeanor is perfect for the workplace. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Jeremy's personality is not the problem; rather, it may be an asset in finding a new job. His outspokenness and willingness to express himself honestly could make him stand out as a candidate who is confident and unafraid to speak their mind. Employers might appreciate these qualities, especially if they are looking for someone who can think outside the box or challenge conventional wisdom. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A."
"Response: 
B) Fran suffered a fatal heart attack as she arranged flowers.
Explanation: The story provides no information about Fran's yard being overrun with bugs, so option A is unlikely. Additionally, the mention of Fran arranging flowers suggests that she was enjoying her usual activity when she suddenly died, which supports option B."
"Response: 
B - Our team felt gratified.
Explanation: The story mentions that the team was ""pumped"" to win and that they were ""unified,"" which suggests that they played well and achieved their goal. Additionally, the use of the word ""gratified"" implies a positive outcome for the team. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Kelly graduated with good grades. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Kelly will graduate with good grades than drop out of college. The passage states that she worked hard and received good grades, indicating that she was successful in her academic pursuits. Additionally, the fact that she is entering college in the fall suggests that she has been accepted into a program and will continue her studies."
"Response: 
B: Sophie laughed in her face.
Explanation: The story states that Sophie's nana is terminally ill, which means she will soon die. It would be unlikely for Sophie to cry upon seeing her dying grandmother, as she may not want to upset or disturb her during this difficult time. Instead, Sophie might laugh at her grandmother's attempt to give her a keepsake before she passes away. This choice better fits the tone of the story and the situation described."
"Response: 
B: Kelly hoped that she wouldn't get a phone call. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that Kelly will not receive a call from the interviewer because many employers do not follow up with candidates after an interview. It is common for candidates to be left hanging without any updates or feedback, especially if the competition for the job is high. Therefore, option B is the more realistic choice."
"Response: 
B - Don never went to the lake again. 
Explanation: The story states that Don tried to swat the fly for half an hour, indicating that he was persistent in his attempt to catch it. However, since the fly managed to evade him, it's unlikely that Don would continue to try and catch it, especially if it continued to fly around the house. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - They left and went to school.
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that Zack and his friends would leave the scary house and go to school rather than playing baseball inside it. The story mentions that the house is old and abandoned, which suggests that it may be unsafe or unsuitable for playing sports like baseball. Additionally, the fact that Zack and his friends are walking to school implies that they have a specific destination in mind, such as attending classes, which makes it less likely that they would change their plans to play baseball at an abandoned house."
"Response: 
B: Mia lost even more money."
"Response: 
B) She donates the boots to the thrift store."
"Response: 
B - Andrew was so relieved. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Andrew has been searching for the wedding ring frantically and finally remembers where he left it, which means he will be relieved when he finds it. Option A suggests that Andrew found the ring but was not happy about it, which does not align with the context of the situation."
"Response: 
B) He learned that honesty pays. 
Explanation: Terry's decision to turn in the money despite wondering if he did the right thing shows that he values honesty and integrity. By choosing to do the right thing, even when it's difficult, Terry demonstrates that he has learned an important lesson about being honest and ethical. This outcome suggests that Terry will continue to make similar choices in the future, which means he has learned that honesty pays off in the long run."
"Response: 
B: I decided to only take one long warm shower per week. 
Explanation: The speaker feels guilty about taking long, warm showers because they are wasteful, so it makes sense that they would choose to limit themselves to just one per week in order to reduce their guilt. Option A does not make logical sense as it implies the speaker takes two long, warm showers every day, which is unlikely given their feelings of guilt."
"Response: 
B - Barry decided to leave the game. 
Explanation:  The story states that Barry entered the stadium and grabbed a beer, but it does not mention him buying a hot dog or any other food item. Therefore, option A (Barry also bought a hot dog) is unlikely, as there is no evidence to support this choice. Option B (Barry decided to leave the game) is more plausible, as the story does not provide any information about Barry's enjoyment of the game or his intention to stay until the end."
"Response: 
B: We could even see the trap working. 
Explanation: The story states, ""When that didn't work..."". This implies that the author did not observe any improvement or success with using red wine as bait for the fruit fly traps. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B) Remy felt it was a good idea to spill more milk on the carpet. 
Explanation:  In this story, Remy did not learn from her mistake of not cleaning the spill properly. Instead, she decides to intentionally spill more milk on the carpet, which suggests that she may not take responsibility for her actions or be willing to change her behavior. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Heather and Marcus adopted the cat.  
Explanation: The story explicitly states that Heather and Marcus ""fell in love"" with the cat at the shelter, indicating that they decided to adopt it. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B: The crowd made many people late to class. 
Explanation: In this story, lots of people are trying to get somewhere quickly by pushing others out of their way. This leads to a situation where people fall down, which means they will be late for class. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: I won't be going back to another concert. 
Explanation:  In this story, the narrator had a great experience at the concert and even met their idol afterward. However, they express that they will not be attending another concert again, which suggests that the experience may have been overwhelming or exhausting for them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B: Eric stopped being anorexic. 
Explanation:  The story states that Eric started eating healthier, which suggests that he may have been experiencing some weight loss or at least a reduction in unhealthy habits. However, since the story only mentions him going to the gym for a month before giving up, it seems unlikely that he would have achieved significant weight loss or improved overall health through exercise alone. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."
"Response: 
B - Sally did well, and her parents agreed to take her to Hawaii. 
Explanation: The story states that Sally's parents promised her a vacation if she does well in her last semester of school. This implies that they will fulfill their promise if she meets their conditions, which in this case means doing well in her studies. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: We made a lot of money for our needs. 
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist's siblings and he ""needed money."" This implies that they were facing financial difficulties. Setting up a lemonade stand and selling drinks to passersby is a common way for children to earn some extra cash, so it is likely that they were able to raise enough money to meet their needs. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - I hate my smartphone.
Explanation: The speaker mentions that the advent of the smartphone made flashlights less needed, indicating that they prefer using their phone for lighting instead of carrying around separate flashlights. This suggests that they are not fond of their smartphone and would rather rely on traditional flashlights."
"Response: 
B: Terry was still disappointed. 
Explanation: The story states, ""Terry hated his name."" This implies that Terry's feelings towards his name have not changed since childhood, so it is more likely that he is still disappointed with his name as an adult than him suddenly accepting it at age 45."
"Response: 
B - The Parker family soon moved into their new home. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that the Parker family will move into their new home than become frustrated with their search. The story mentions that the family looked all over town but couldn't find a home they wanted until they found this particular one, which suggests that they were determined to find the right home and eventually succeeded."
"Response: 
B - Tom began to worry.
Explanation: The fact that the front door was open suggests that someone may be inside the house, which could be a cause for concern for Tom. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B: Kelly reluctantly paid for a new battery. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems more likely that Kelly would be reluctant to pay for a new battery rather than being relieved that the old one was still good. This is because the story states that the battery was ""dead,"" which means it could not be revived or repaired, and therefore needed to be replaced."
"Response: 
B: Joe was in terrible pain. 
Explanation: In this story, Joe falls while performing a trick on his skateboard and breaks his arm. This injury would likely cause him significant pain, making option B the more likely outcome. Option A is not supported by the information provided in the story."
Response:  Option B: She found the best places to shop and purchase all her supplies.  This option makes sense because if Maddie wanted to get the best deals on school supplies, she would look for stores that offer discounts or promotions specifically for back-to-school shoppers. Additionally, this option aligns with the theme of being prepared for school by having everything you need, which is mentioned earlier in the passage.
"Response: 
Option A: He felt like his mouth was on fire."
"Response: 
B: The teacher was happy that you slept in detention.
Explanation: In this story, it's unlikely that the teacher would be unhappy with the student for sleeping during detention. Detention is typically used as a punishment for misbehavior or poor academic performance, so it's possible that the teacher may have expected the student to stay awake and work on their assignments instead of sleeping. However, if the student was able to fall asleep despite being told not to, it could indicate that they were feeling overwhelmed or stressed, which might actually earn them some sympathy from the teacher. Therefore, option B is the more plausible ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: Amanda finds nature boring.
Explanation: The story states that Amanda was ""fascinated"" by the squirrel, which implies that she found it interesting or captivating. However, later in the story, it says that Amanda found nature boring, which contradicts this earlier statement. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Terry has given up swimming. 
Explanation:  Terry's consistent effort to learn how to dive without success may lead him to give up on his dream of becoming a good diver, especially if he finds it too difficult or frustrating. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Terry's story."
"Response: 
B: Peter grew up to be a scientist. 
Explanation:  In this story, Peter shows an interest in science through his excitement about the field trip to the science museum. This suggests that he may have developed a passion for science at a young age, which could potentially lead him to pursue a career in the field as an adult. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Peter's future."
"Response: 
B: James was sad about the proposal. 
Explanation: The story states that James proposed to Kaylee one year after they started dating, but it does not indicate that he was happy or excited about the proposal. In fact, option B explicitly states that James was ""sad"" about the proposal, which suggests that he may have been hesitant or unwilling to propose to Kaylee. Therefore, this option is the most likely choice based on the information provided in the story."
"Response: 
B: The next day she got a call and was offered the job. "
"Response: 
B) She felt magnificently relaxed and contented afterwards."
"Response: 
B - Bob was still happy, but less excited. 
Explanation:  The story states that Bob was initially ""happy"" when he received the $50 bonus, but then realizes it's only $5 after putting on his glasses. This implies that while Bob was initially pleased with the amount, his excitement quickly faded upon realizing how small it truly was. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: It was the best meal we ever had. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Mom not wanting to cook dinner resulted in an unconventional but enjoyable dining experience for the family. Option B better captures this unexpected positive outcome, as it implies that despite initial disappointment or frustration, they ended up enjoying their ""cold cereal feast."""
"Response: 
B: Mary was so happy!
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it seems more likely that Mary would be happy to see her grandfather unexpectedly show up at the holiday dinner rather than being distraught about the whole family not being together. The fact that he showed up despite not having been invited suggests that he must have wanted to spend time with his loved ones, which would be a positive emotion for Mary."
"Response: 
B - The children excitedly bought ice cream cones. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it's more likely that the children would be eager to buy something they want (ice cream) than throw away money without any reward. Additionally, the fact that they ran to their mother for money suggests that they are interested in purchasing treats, rather than just throwing money around aimlessly."
"Response: 
B - We decided to keep driving past the airport to the beach. 
Explanation: The story states that after looking for an airplane ticket, they ""headed to the airport."" This implies that they were already at or near their destination (the airport) when they realized they could just drive there instead of flying. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Susan took good care of them."
Response:  Option A: The television show had hooked me in. 
"Response: 
Option A: Howard was happy to have had such a good day. "
"Response: 
Option A: His coworkers took him to safety and called their medic. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it's more likely that the man's coworkers would take him to safety and call for medical attention rather than the man attempting to run towards them. This is because the man has been struck by a falling object and may be incapacitated or injured, making it unsafe for him to move on his own. It's important for people in this situation to prioritize safety and seek medical attention as soon as possible."
"Response: 
B: Trent was careless and caused a huge fire.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Trent will be careless and cause a huge fire while trying to keep the fire going in the wind. The fact that he is in charge of keeping the fire going despite not enjoying camping suggests that he may not be paying close attention or taking necessary precautions, which could lead to an accidental fire."
"Response: 
B: Things had turned out just as he'd hoped. 
Explanation: The story states that George woke up to discover his TV had been stolen, which suggests that he was not expecting this outcome. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - They made Tommy shave his head. 
Explanation: The story states that Tommy's parents ""thought it was stupid."" This implies that they were not pleased with Tommy's decision to dye his hair pink, and may have taken action to make him change it. Shaving one's head is a drastic measure that would be unlikely for parents to do unless they strongly disapproved of their son's appearance. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome in this scenario."
Response:  Option A: Cameron came by and helped Robbie shovel. 
"Response:  Option B: Ronald went to look for more laces.  
Explanation: In this story, Ronald cannot find the laces for his shoes after looking all over. Therefore, it makes sense that he would go to look for more laces instead of just putting on his shoes without any laces. This option provides a logical continuation of the story."
"Response: 
B - Sara took a nap. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Sara giving birth or having a baby. It only mentions that her water broke, which can happen before or during labor. Therefore, option B (Sara took a nap) is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - My uncle enjoys his hobby. 
Explanation: The fact that your uncle buys a metal detector and takes it to the beach every weekend suggests that he enjoys this hobby. Finding something valuable, such as a Rolex, is an added bonus for him. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: We had a great time!"
"Response: 
B - Alice felt her friends were very thoughtful. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Alice's friends have already ordered their meals before she arrives, indicating that they made an effort to ensure she was taken care of without making her wait. This shows consideration for Alice's needs and timeline, which suggests they are being thoughtful towards her. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome in this situation."
"Response: 
Option B: I decided to buy her a candy bar instead. 
Explanation: The story does not mention anything about adopting or buying a puppy, so it is unlikely that option A would be chosen. Additionally, the fact that the girls ""picked out"" a puppy suggests that they were only playing with her and did not actually take her home, which further supports the choice of option B."
"Response: 
B - Mario spent the afternoon catching butterflies in the park.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Mario's wedding day would be a happy or memorable occasion, especially since it mentions him feeling anxious about getting married. Instead, it suggests that he might have been spending time doing something else entirely, such as going for a walk or playing sports, which could explain why he did not attend the wedding."
"Response: 
B) Zeke lived out his life very happy.
Explanation: The story states that Zeke ""decided to move to Cozumel"" and ""built a house on that land."" This implies that he successfully completed his plan to move to Mexico and built a home there, which suggests that he was able to achieve his goal and live out his life in Cozumel. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Zeke's story."
Response:  Option B - And the US Army got back to her. This is because Kelly specifically mentioned that she wanted to join the Navy, but the story states that the US Army got back to her instead.
"Response: 
B) Gina felt very lonely.
Explanation: The fact that Gina only knows two people in the entire school and neither of them were in the lunchroom suggests that she feels isolated and alone. Additionally, the mention of going ""outside"" implies that she may have been hoping for some social interaction but found none, further reinforcing the feeling of loneliness."
"Response: 
B - I am no longer afraid of planes.
Explanation: In this story, the child initially expresses fear when getting on the plane, but by the end of the story, they are no longer afraid. This suggests that their initial fear was temporary and not persistent, which is consistent with the definition of situational anxiety provided earlier. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this story."
"Response: 
B - And he opened it as soon as it got there."
"Response: 
B - They spent the money on candy. 
Explanation: The story states that Ted and Beth ""noticed that they may not have enough to pay for it,"" which implies that they were aware of their financial situation before asking their parents for help. Additionally, the fact that they received extra money suggests that they may have been overspending or using the money for non-essential items like candy rather than saving it for the wedding. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Luckily, the new ones were more comfortable than the old ones. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Cindy was so focused on finding her lost slippers that she didn't think about anything else, including ordering a new phone. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: Neil spent all his money too quickly, and never saw art again. 
Explanation: In this story, Neil was so excited to see artwork in Paris that he spent all of his money on museum admission fees without realizing how much it would cost him. As a result, he ran out of money before he could see as much art as he wanted to. This outcome is more likely than option A because it better fits the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B: Jessica was very angry with her dad.
Explanation: The story states that Jessica worked very hard in school and thought she deserved a reward. However, instead of giving her a reward, her father surprises her with tickets for a vacation without consulting her first. This may come across as disrespectful or dismissive of Jessica's feelings, leading her to be angry with her father. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Tim wore the jean-shorts to the park."
"Response: 
B: Sandy sold Jim her old bed."
"Response: 
B: Teaching myself helped me get ahead of other students. 
Explanation: The student in this scenario took matters into their own hands by teaching themselves instead of relying solely on their professors for instruction. This shows initiative and a willingness to take control of one's learning experience, which can lead to academic success. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) He dived into the cool water.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Timmy knows or cares about the girl's feelings towards him. In fact, it suggests that she may be uncomfortable or even scared by his actions of following her without her consent. Therefore, option B, where Timmy dives into the cool water to escape the situation, seems like the more plausible outcome given the context of the story."
"Response: 
B - Neil couldn't wait to get back to the hotel so he could watch TV."
"Response: 
B - Jen's mother fixed Jen's discolored hair. 
Explanation: Based on the story, Jen's mother is described as saying ""they could fix it."" This implies that she has experience dealing with hair damage caused by bleach and knows how to restore it to its natural color. It is unlikely that Jen would try to further damage her hair by applying more bleach, especially since she was already in a state of panic after realizing how long she had left the bleach in her hair. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Doug found no snow and was instantly thrilled. 
Explanation: The story states that Doug ""prayed to God for snow"" but when he woke up, the room was filled with light instead of snow. This suggests that Doug's prayer may not have been answered in the way he expected or desired. It is more likely that Doug would be disappointed or disillusioned by this outcome rather than immediately thrilled."
"Response: 
Option A: Sheryl was proud of her job as a museum curator. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Sheryl enjoys her job as a museum curator, as she finds it interesting and valuable. When her family dismisses her job as ""boring,"" Sheryl defends her profession by pointing out that she gets to work with living history every day. This indicates that she takes pride in her work and values its importance. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Option B: Joe went back to sleep. This option best fits with the information provided in the story because Joe woke up after his alarm didn't go off, indicating that he may have overslept or forgotten to set an alarm time. It is unlikely that he would be late for work without realizing it until much later, so option A (Joe was late for work) is not a viable choice.
"Response: 
B) She hired a defense attorney.
Explanation: In this story, Ned's wife is accused of lying about him passing away peacefully in his sleep. Since she's being investigated by the police, she would likely want to hire a lawyer to defend herself against any potential charges. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for this scenario."
"Response: 
B) Jackie was very depressed. 
Explanation: The story states that after 48 hours of being in labor, Jackie's baby was released, which implies that she gave birth to a stillborn or deceased child. This would understandably cause Jackie to be depressed, as she had been anticipating the arrival of her newborn and now has to deal with the loss of her child. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) We bought the kitten."
"Response: 
B: He was sad for the rest of the day.
Explanation: In this story, Joe is happy about getting an A on his spelling homework but then becomes sad because his sister always gets good grades and he doesn't. This suggests that Joe may be feeling insecure or competitive towards his sister, which could lead to feelings of sadness. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Finally, they decided on an apartment."
"Response: 
B: Greta was very sad, but her parents cheered her up."
Response:  Option A: The festivities went on without a hitch. This is because Shari's worry about the weather not being suitable for her outdoor wedding turned out to be unfounded, as the day remained clear and sunny throughout.
"Response: 
B: On Christmas, Amy got exactly what she hoped to get. 
Explanation: The story states that Santa told Amy she would receive everything on her list, which means that Amy will indeed get everything she wants for Christmas. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - She had a bountiful harvest."
"Response: 
B - Kim decided this was a sign to buy a new toothbrush. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it seems that Kim has an aversion to touching the toothbrush after it fell into the toilet. Rather than risk handling it again, she decides to replace it with a new one. This choice makes sense given her discomfort level and the fact that the toothbrush may have come into contact with feces or other contaminants in the toilet bowl."
"Response: 
B: Hannah gave up the piano. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Hannah struggled with playing the piano after her first lesson and found it difficult to practice. As a result, she may have become frustrated or disheartened and decided to give up on learning how to play the instrument altogether. This outcome is more likely than option A, where Hannah would continue to love her fingers despite struggling with playing the piano."
"Response: 
B: Keira cannot stay with this abusive man. 
Explanation: The fact that the man hit Keira after she burned dinner indicates that he has a history of domestic violence. This behavior is not acceptable in any relationship, and it is important for Keira to prioritize her safety and well-being by leaving him. It is unlikely that Keira would be proud of her new boyfriend given his violent behavior, and it is more likely that she will seek help and support from friends, family, or a professional organization to escape the abusive situation."
"Response: 
B: The shepherd then released the sheep. 
Explanation: In this story, the shepherd has already taken steps to move the sheep from the pasture into the pen. Therefore, it makes more sense for him to release them rather than sending them back to their original location. Option A does not make logical sense in this context as the shepherd would have no reason to go back to his house after completing the task of moving the sheep into the pen."
"Response: 
B) He decided to never date again.
Explanation: In this story, Walter has feelings of guilt about dating someone new after his wife's passing. This suggests that he may be struggling with grief and finding it difficult to move on. The fact that he decides not to date anyone else again further supports this answer. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Walter's situation."
"Response: 
B) She couldn't believe how windy it was. 
Explanation: The fact that Marina becomes disoriented after being hit by the tumbleweed suggests that she may have been caught off guard or surprised by the unexpected encounter. Given that she is not described as having any interest in golf, option A (She loved playing golf.) is unlikely. Option B (She couldn't believe how windy it was.) makes more sense given the context of the scene and Marina's reaction."
"Response: 
B: You were disappointed when you won. 
Explanation: The story states that the person ""picked their numbers from [their] family's bible"" and ""purchased [their] tickets from a reputable online lottery agent."" These actions suggest that the person took great care in selecting their numbers and purchasing their ticket, indicating that they had high hopes of winning. Therefore, it is more likely that the person would be disappointed if they did win, rather than not being disappointed."
"Response: 
B: Her song helped her, and she did well on the test. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Amy's creative approach of writing a song to help her remember the complex information about photosynthesis actually worked. By using music as a mnemonic device, she was able to better retain the information and perform well on the test. This outcome suggests that using unconventional methods, such as creating songs or rhymes, can be effective for learning and retention of complex information."
"Response: 
B - I had a great first day of work."
Response:  Option A: They had a good time together.
"Response: 
B) The couple ordered appetizers and decided on their entrees. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the guests are not leaving immediately after receiving the bill, indicating that they intend to stay and finish their meal. This aligns with the fact that they have already ordered appetizers and are deciding on their entrees, which suggests that they plan to spend more time at the restaurant. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Kay had to go buy more things. 
Explanation: The story states that there was not enough room for Kay's things, which means she did not have enough space to fit all of her belongings. Therefore, it makes sense that she would need to purchase additional items to fill up the available space."
"Response: 
B - The girls had a great time.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it goes against our expectations of what usually happens when people get into a fight, which is that they become embarrassed or upset. Instead, the girls are shown to have a good time despite their argument, which adds an unexpected twist to the story."
"Response: 
B - Vinny got his picture taken with him. 
Explanation:  The story states that Vinny saw Denzel Washington out taking a stroll, which means they were in public. It's unlikely that Vinny would keep walking without stopping or trying to get attention from someone as famous as Denzel Washington. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: A lifeguard jumping in and pulling you out of the deep end is a more realistic outcome than having your birthday be the best day ever."
"Response: 
B - The Smiths all cheered, and rushed to hug their cat. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that the Smiths would be happy to see their missing cat safe and sound on the Christmas tree than for the cat to meow at the front door."
"Response: 
B) Flora visited her parents every summer to tell them her stories. 
Explanation: In this story, Flora decides to stay in Spain after her initial plan to return home. Instead of feeling forlorn or lonely about not being able to see Europe anymore, she visits her parents every summer to share her exciting experiences with them. This option best completes the story by providing a logical conclusion that aligns with the character's actions and personality."
"Response: 
B - Joyce was happy with the new fragrance.
Explanation: The story states that a really bad smell took over Joyce's apartment, which suggests that she may not have been bothered by the smell or may even have found it pleasant. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Ted almost drowned but was saved by his friends. 
Explanation: In this story, Ted did not know how to swim and jumped into the water despite his friends' warnings. This indicates that he may have been in danger of drowning. Fortunately, his friends were able to save him, which suggests that they were paying attention and took appropriate action when needed. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B: I got to kiss Sarah goodnight."
"Response: 
B) We were gratified.
Explanation: The story states that the speaker ""finally found"" the sloths in the last exhibit, which implies that they were looking for them throughout their visit. Therefore, it makes sense that they would be ""gratified"" when they finally find what they were searching for. Option A does not make sense because there is no indication that the group decided to leave before visiting the final exhibit."
"Response: 
B - They save the world.
Explanation: The story implies that the scientists are working together to find a solution to a serious problem, which suggests that their efforts will be successful in saving the world from the disease. Additionally, the fact that other scientists have gathered to help the initial scientist suggests that this is not just a personal project but rather a collective effort to address a global issue. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
Response:  Option A: Troy had lots of fun at Sam's house.  This option is most likely because it aligns with the tone and content of the story, which describes a positive and enjoyable experience for Troy at Sam's house.
"Response: 
B: Yvonne felt defeated.
Explanation: Although Yvonne had lost weight, the fact that it took her only two months to lose 23 pounds suggests that she may have been expecting more significant results or progress by this point in time. Additionally, the fact that she started exercising as part of her New Year's resolution may have set unrealistic expectations for how quickly she should be seeing results, leading to feelings of frustration or disappointment rather than pride."
"Response: 
B: When she finished the preparation, she consumed the yummy drink. 
Explanation: The story states that India ""prepared the coffee in the machine"" and ""grabbed the milk and ice."" This implies that she was making an iced coffee, which would require cold ingredients like milk and ice. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: Betsy was really excited. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it's more likely that Betsy would be excited about getting a pet, especially since her mother initially refused her request for one. The fact that she found a hamster in a cage suggests that her mother may have relented or changed her mind, which would make Betsy happy."
"Response: 
B: Now Maureen shares her passion for Biology with students. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Maureen will share her passion for Biology with students rather than saying that girls don't belong in science professions. The story highlights Maureen's determination and hard work towards becoming a Biology teacher despite her friends' doubts, indicating that she is committed to pursuing her dream career."
Response:  Option B: Cornelia uses it as a nightstand in her room. This option is more likely because it aligns with Cornelia's interest in working with her hands and creating something useful and practical. Building a table takes time and effort, so it makes sense that Cornelia would want to use it in her home rather than destroying it or using it for another purpose.
"Response: 
B) They loved playing frisbee.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that the children were at the graveyard for an activity they enjoyed, rather than out of fear or obligation. The fact that some of the chains on the grave had been broken suggests that someone may have recently visited the grave, but it does not indicate why the children were there or what they were doing. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Jim won the race in his Corvette."
"Response:  Option A: She was excited. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Sally was excited about seeing the robin in its nest than finding it annoying. The story mentions that Sally loves robins, which suggests that she has a positive association with them. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
B - He was so angry he never spoke to her again. 
Explanation:  
In this scenario, Joy's boyfriend is not pleased with losing to her at putt putt, especially after discovering that she has been playing golf since she was a child and is much better than him. His anger and disappointment may cause him to end their relationship or avoid speaking to her altogether. Option B best captures the emotions of an upset partner who feels embarrassed and humiliated by their loss."
"Response: 
B - Fantastic Chef.
Explanation: The story highlights the chef's skillfulness in slicing the onion without getting cut, indicating that they are a talented chef. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: The little sister got punished with a timeout."
"Response: 
B - Stay Lost.
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist ""walked for miles"" searching for their friends, indicating that they were trying to find their way back to civilization. However, since they didn't have any equipment with them, it's unlikely that they would be able to navigate through unfamiliar terrain without getting lost again. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: The teacher admired Haley's passion and agreed. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, the teacher recognizes that Hailey is genuinely enthusiastic about participating in the marathon despite forgetting her own shoes. Rather than dismissing or discouraging Hailey, the teacher decides to help her out by lending a pair of their own shoes. This shows empathy and support towards Hailey's determination, which is more likely to be the response from a caring teacher."
"Response: 
B - Jim threw the ring away.
Explanation:  It's unlikely that Jim would sell a valuable historical artifact for only $1,000. Most likely, he would have taken it to a reputable dealer or auction house where it could have fetched a much higher price. Additionally, many people are fascinated by history and might be interested in preserving such an item rather than throwing it away."
"Response: 
B: Kyle and Ted got so sick that they both lost."
"Response: 
B - Bob's friends quickly brought him some water to hydrate him. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bob became dehydrated due to excessive sweating during the game of volleyball. Option A is incorrect because Bob did not say that he felt bloated from drinking too much water; rather, he experienced symptoms related to dehydration. Therefore, option B is the correct answer, as it describes how Bob's friends provided him with water to replenish lost fluids and help alleviate his dehydration."
"Response: 
B) Kathy took them to the store again right away. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it's more likely that Kathy will take her children to the store again immediately after their tantrum-filled trip there earlier in the day. This is because she needs to buy milk for herself and her children, and cannot afford to go without it for another day. Additionally, taking them to the store again may help teach them about responsibility and learning how to handle frustration in a constructive manner."
"Response: 
Option B: Chuck dropped out of school.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Chuck dropped out of school rather than joining the debate team and doing fairly well. The fact that Chuck was scared of public speaking suggests that he may have struggled with the demands of debating, which could have led him to drop out of school altogether."
"Response: 
B: I nearly died of frostbite. 
Explanation: The story describes a situation where the person is lost in the woods, feeling very thirsty and worried about dying. This suggests that it is cold enough outside for frostbite to be a concern, which is more likely option B than Option A."
"Response: 
Option B: Laura never painted again. 
Explanation:  The story states that Laura posted her self-portrait online, which suggests that she wanted to share her art with others. However, since she never painted again, it's likely that she lost interest in painting or felt discouraged by the reaction to her work. It's unlikely that she continued to paint every day after posting her self-portrait online."
"Response: 
Option A: He won his first fight by knockout. 
Explanation: The story states that Jason became a great boxer after training in his spare time, which implies that he eventually entered and won his first fight. It does not mention anything about him participating in wrestling matches, so option B is unlikely."
"Response: 
B - We all had a good time.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that everyone in the family had a positive experience during their trip to Great Wolf Lodge. They enjoyed swimming at the water park and relaxing together afterward with pizza and story time. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Tom asked him what the problem was. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's more likely that Tom would be curious about why the tall gentleman is yelling and would ask him what's wrong rather than offering him a glass of water."
"Response: 
B: Allie gained all the weight back she had lost. 
Explanation:  It's common for people to regain weight after significant weight loss, especially if they don't make sustainable lifestyle changes. In this case, Allie may have focused too much on losing weight quickly rather than making healthy habits a permanent part of her routine."
"Response: 
B: Jenny narrowly avoided a car accident. "
"Response: 
B - Elle was very responsible.  
Explanation:  
The story states that Elle set up a payment plan with the dealer, indicating that she is responsible and able to manage her finances. It also mentions that she pays five hundred dollars each month, which suggests that she is committed to paying off the car loan in a timely manner. These details suggest that Elle is responsible and reliable, making option B the more likely choice."
"Response: 
B: The mechanic told Jay that was only a minor repair."
"Response: 
B - He waited until wildlife rescue arrived to save the baby possums. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Ned did not go to the gym after work but instead waited for professional help to arrive before attempting to care for or handle the baby possums himself. This decision makes sense given the importance of proper handling and care for young wild animals, as well as the potential risks involved with interacting with them without proper training or expertise."
"Response: 
B: Don never forgave his friend.
Explanation: The story states that Don was ""angry and embarrassed"" after his friend pulled his pants down in front of their graduating class, and it also says that Don decided that this friend would no longer be his friend. This suggests that Don did not forgive his friend for what happened and held onto his anger and embarrassment. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option A - The neighbor had my dog. This is the most likely ending to the story because it is more plausible that your neighbor would have information about your missing dog than for you to give them away without their knowledge or consent.
"Response: 
B: Eventually we had children.
Explanation: The story suggests that the couple started dating after meeting at Costco, and they got married five years later. This implies that their relationship progressed from casual flirting to serious commitment over time. Given this progression, it is more likely that they eventually had children together."
"Response: 
B) Cindy continued holding the soup. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's unlikely that Cindy would go and run cold water over her hands after receiving the hot bowl of soup. Instead, she may continue to hold the soup with her burned hands in an attempt to avoid drawing attention to herself or causing a scene. This choice aligns better with human behavior and the context of the scenario."
"Response: 
B: From then on, she swims the backstroke constantly. 
Explanation: In this story, Laura learns something new (backstroke) and enjoys it so much that she starts doing it all the time. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - I had a wonderful time!"
"Response: 
B - Jess decided to make egg salad. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it seems more likely that Jess would decide to make egg salad rather than the dog eating it. The story mentions that Jess hates egg salad, which suggests that she might want to avoid eating it. Additionally, there is no indication in the story that the dog has any interest in or ability to prepare food, so it is unlikely that the dog would eat the egg salad even if given the opportunity."
Response:  Option A: Robbie and I dressed up for the occasion.
"Response: 
B: After the initial noises Lonnie settled in for the night. 
Explanation:  Based on the context of the story, it seems that Lonnie has chosen to live off the grid in the woods, which means he will be exposed to natural sounds like howls and rustling at night. While these sounds might be unsettling initially, it's likely that Lonnie will become accustomed to them over time and learn to sleep through them. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Bob made it to work on time. "
Response:  Option A: Ava was able to fly without spending any money on her ticket. 
"Response: 
B: Sharon is now looking forward to a new chapter in her life."
Response:  Option A: Nita was so happy she finally beat her dad at rummy. 
Response:  Option B: Tina took second place in the competition. This option best completes the story because it provides an outcome that is consistent with Tina's nerves and fear of failure. If Tina had done well, she would not have been as anxious about the competition. Therefore, taking second place makes sense given her pre-competition emotions.
"Response: 
Option B: Neil was glad he had seen the Taj Mahal. 
Explanation: The story states that Neil admired the beautiful design of the Taj Mahal, indicating that he found it impressive. When he learned about the sad story behind its construction, he was moved by the obvious labor of love that went into building it. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice as it reflects Neil's positive reaction to his visit to the Taj Mahal."
"Response: 
B - Mark and Frank hit her again. 
Explanation: The story states that the saturated ball accidentally hit Mark's mother, which suggests that it was not an intentional act. However, given the context of the story (i.e., the boys are playing and having fun), it is more likely that they will continue to play and forget about their mistake rather than apologizing or showing remorse. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) They all hung out without him and he felt excluded. 
Explanation: In this story, Ty meets three new people on the first day of camp but does not spend time with them together. Instead, each person he meets goes off with someone else, leaving Ty feeling excluded. This outcome aligns better with the theme of loneliness and isolation than the alternative option where they all hang out together."
"Response: 
B - Threw the yogurt away. 
Explanation:  The story states that Vince wanted something sweet but didn't want ice cream, which suggests that he might have been trying to be healthier or watch his calorie intake. Therefore, option B, where Vince throws the yogurt away, is more likely than option A, where he shares it with someone else."
"Response: 
B: Ned's skills improved as he practiced."
"Response: 
Buck was glad that the woman helped him. 
Explanation: The story states that Buck was ""intrigued"" by the woman's suggestion of going to the shelter, which implies that he was receptive to her help. Additionally, the story does not suggest any indication of anger or resentment towards the woman for offering assistance, further supporting option B as the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: Josh doesn't like bees so much any more. 
Explanation:  The fact that Josh was stung by a bee suggests that he may have developed a negative association with these insects. This could lead him to avoid them or dislike them more than before. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - We were happy to win a small amount of money from the tickets. 
Explanation: The story states that the couple ""was desperate for money,"" which suggests that they are in financial difficulty. Given this context, it is unlikely that they would decide to go to the zoo as their first choice, especially if they had to buy lottery tickets to afford it. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: Fred told the barista to leave him alone. "
Response:  Option B: Jenny found the gum she wanted at the front of the store. 
"Response: 
B - Bob kissed Jenny goodnight. 
Explanation:  The context of the story suggests that Bob and Jenny have a friendly relationship, as they went to the movies together and had a good time. Therefore, it is more likely that Bob would kiss Jenny goodnight as a sign of affection rather than not talking to her again."
"Response: 
B) My truck looked so shiny afterwards. 
Explanation: The story states that the speaker's truck ""got really dirty"" while they were mudding, which suggests that it became covered in dirt and grime. However, the ending implies that afterward, the truck looked clean and shiny again, which is unlikely given how dirty it had become earlier in the story. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 
B - He was a staunch Republican.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Peter is a supporter of Bernie Sanders or the Democratic Party. In fact, the story states that Peter was ""excited"" to attend the rally, which suggests that he may have been there to support someone else entirely. Additionally, the wording of the question implies that Peter is unlikely to be a Democrat, as it refers to him being a ""staunch Republican."" Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Josh used the bonus to repair his broken car.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Josh would use the bonus to repair his broken car rather than refusing to take the money and quitting the job. This is because Josh is described as being ""happy"" about receiving the bonus, which suggests that he values the financial reward. Additionally, the fact that Josh's car is broken implies that he needs the money to fix it, so using the bonus to repair the car makes sense given the context of the situation."
"Response: 
Option A: Now, Ethan wanted to make and upload even more Youtube videos."
"Response:  Option B: Perhaps another person in the park can help him. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that there are other people in the park who may be able to assist the stranger with money or other forms of support rather than buying a whole restaurant just for him. Additionally, it is important to recognize that not everyone has the means or resources to provide financial assistance to strangers, and it is okay to politely decline such requests when unable to help."
"Response: 
B - Gina hated the library.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Gina hated the library than waited for the librarian. If Gina and her friends were eager to enter the library but couldn't find the librarian, they might have been excited to explore the library despite the absence of their supervisor. However, if Gina personally disliked the library, she would be less inclined to wait for the librarian and instead choose to avoid entering the building altogether."
"Response: 
B) Ana vowed never to go hiking again!"
"Response: 
B - The man was very annoyed.
Explanation:  The story states that the bike ""fell apart"" after only a few weeks, which suggests that it was not well-made or durable. This would likely be frustrating for the father who remembers his own bike lasting longer than this one did. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Jaime then walked up to him and gave him a hug. "
"Response: 
Option B: Billy demonstrated cowardice. 
Explanation: In this story, Billy's friends think he is a scaredy-cat and dare him to enter a haunted house. Despite his fear, he decides to go inside and spend the night there. This shows that Billy is not brave but rather cowardly because he allowed himself to be pushed into doing something that made him uncomfortable and afraid."
Response:  Option B: Ana had no children.  This option is most likely because it does not make sense for someone who has just had a baby to take their newborn to get their ears pierced. Additionally, it would be dangerous to pierce an infant's ears as they are too young to properly care for the piercing site or handle any potential infections.
"Response: 
B - Sally's mom appreciated the effort. 
Explanation: The story states that Sally's mom ""loved"" the roses and put them in a vase on the table, indicating that she appreciated the thoughtful gesture. It is unlikely that she would throw the roses away immediately after receiving them."
"Response: 
B - I was so ashamed I never stole again.
Explanation: The story suggests that the protagonist felt guilty about stealing the hats and was ashamed of their actions. This feeling of shame is more likely to be the outcome than being praised or rewarded for their behavior."
"Response: 
B - The next pitch he hit a homerun. 
Explanation: 
The story states that Matt has never hit a home run in his entire career, which suggests that this is unlikely to happen now, especially since it's his last game. Option A, where Matt scores a touchdown at the last minute, is even less plausible given that baseball and football are different sports altogether. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - She got angry with her parents and ran away from home.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Cara would be grateful or happy about receiving a surprise gift like a new car on her birthday. Instead, it suggests that she might feel overwhelmed or resentful at being given something without having a say in the matter. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
Option A: She made fast friends with the cashier and customer. "
"Response: 
B - Now we all go to the dining hall instead of cooking. 
Explanation: The story states that the dining hall food was ""subpar,"" which suggests it was not very good. Therefore, it is more likely that Jake and his roommate stopped cooking and started eating at the dining hall instead."
"Response: 
B: My family all loved Toby. 
Explanation: The story states ""I fell in love with a dog named Toby"" and ""My family all loved Toby."" This implies that everyone in the narrator's household was fond of Toby, which makes option B the more likely choice."
"Response: 
Option A: It was some of the best bread he has had. 
Explanation: The story states that Tony was ""tired of stale store-bought bread,"" which implies that he was not satisfied with the quality of the bread he was buying in stores. Therefore, it is more likely that when Tony made the bread according to his mother's recipe, he found it to be delicious and better than what he was used to buying."
"Response: 
B) Selena went out shopping.
Explanation: The story does not mention any legal action taken by Selena against the stalker, so it is unlikely that she would have gone to the authorities. Instead, she may have chosen to avoid the situation altogether by going out shopping or doing something else to distract herself from the stalker's behavior."
"Response: 
B: Sam decided to never eat waffles again. 
Explanation: The story states that Sam loves breakfast and specifically frozen waffles, but then reveals that there are only three waffles in the box instead of four. This suggests that something unexpected happened, such as running out of waffles or forgetting to buy more. It is unlikely that Sam simply ate three waffles instead of four without any explanation. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - The mother comforted the child."
"Response: 
B: While he was sleeping, the bee stung him. 
Explanation: In this story, Rick is unable to do anything about the fly buzzing around his room because he is too tired. Therefore, option B, where he gets stung by a bee while he is sleeping, is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: We all decided to go to Vegas. 
Explanation: The story mentions that the group of friends wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons, but things quickly deteriorated as they continued to drink. This suggests that their behavior became more reckless or irresponsible, which could lead them to make impulsive decisions like going to Las Vegas. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Jen had the cops show up at her front door."
"Response: 
B: Logan and Maria were ashamed of the film. 
Explanation: The story states that Logan and Maria ""invited everyone to come see it,"" which implies that they are eager for people to watch their film. However, if the film did not turn out well, they would be ashamed of it and might feel embarrassed about showing it to others. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Sam learned from the old man's advice, and got the job."
"Response: 
Option A: They went to the animal shelter and picked out a cute puppy. 
Explanation: In this story, the little girl wants a puppy but her parents say no. The girl becomes upset and continues to cry until her parents change their minds. It's unlikely that they would go to a pet store and buy a bird instead of a puppy since birds are not typically what children want as pets. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Sara loved the Fourth of July."
"Response: 
B: Kate was proud.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it seems that Kate has made an effort to improve her fitness and diet, which suggests that she is proud of her progress. It is unlikely that she would be ashamed of her efforts, especially since she has taken the time to maintain a healthy lifestyle."
"Response: 
Option A: Robert studied hard and came in first place at the contest. "
"Response: 
B - He told his friends he was going to be late."
"Response: 
Option A: Samantha loves the apple cider she gets at the orchard. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Samantha enjoys the apple cider she purchases at the orchard than hating autumn. The story highlights her excitement towards getting apple cider during this time of year, which suggests that she has a positive association with autumn and its products."
"Response: 
B: John was angry because it was snowing. 
Explanation: In this story, John wants to avoid studying for his math test, so he hopes that there will be a snow day. However, when he wakes up the next day, he finds out that school has been cancelled due to the snow. This makes him angry because now he has even less time to prepare for the test. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Let Them Go Free.  
Explanation: In this scenario, it's unlikely that the sheriff would arrest the outlaws after finding them sleeping in a secluded location like Blood Gulch. It's possible that he may have had enough evidence to bring them to justice at a later time, but given the remote nature of their campsite, it's more likely that he would choose to let them go free for now."
"Response: 
B) Josie hated spiders."
"Response: 
B - Nick kept the wallet. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Nick has possession of the wallet that doesn't belong to him. It is not ethical or legal for him to keep something that doesn't belong to him, even if he thinks the owner might not be looking for it. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) He was scared of the water."
"Response: 
B: I think terrorism is frightening.
Explanation: The story mentions ""hostages"" and ""shot,"" which are common terms associated with acts of terrorism, such as hostage situations or mass shootings. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Anne was very sad."
"Response: 
Option B: Brain was happy that they tasted so good. "
"Response: 
B) James drove home to get changed into dry clothes. 
Explanation: The fact that James's clothes are ""soaked"" suggests that he has been sweating heavily during his workout, which means he will need to change into something dry and comfortable as soon as possible. Driving home to change into dry clothes makes more sense than driving with the car window open, as it would be uncomfortable and potentially dangerous to drive while exposed to the elements."
"Response: 
B: Gina always chose bananas over oatmeal. 
Explanation: The story states that Gina was ""expecting worse"" than lunch detention, which suggests that she had been in trouble before. If she had previously received punishment for choosing oatmeal instead of bananas, it would be more likely that she would choose bananas again rather than risk getting in trouble again. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Cole never got coal again.
Explanation: The story states that Cole was given coal as a gag gift, which means it was not a real present. Therefore, there is no chance of Cole getting coal again in the future."
"Response: 
B) Mike took a trip to Hawaii.
Explanation: The story states that Mike spun a globe and his finger landed on Hawaii, indicating that he ended up taking a trip there. Option A is not supported by the information provided in the story."
"Response: 
B: The popcorn was prepared to perfection.
Explanation: Tiffany did not follow the instructions on the package, so it is unlikely that the popcorn burned due to her error. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome - the popcorn was prepared to perfection without any issues."
"Response: 
B: We had our first swingers experience that night. 
Explanation:  This answer choice is supported by the information provided in the passage. The fact that the two couples ended up having drinks together in the lodge suggests that there was a social connection or bond formed between them, which could potentially lead to a sexual encounter. Additionally, the context of a winter vacation and a shared activity like snow skiing may create an atmosphere conducive to relaxed attitudes towards sex and intimacy. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the details given in the passage."
"Response: 
B: The boy watched her cats for her. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Nan feels guilty about leaving her pets alone during the day while she works. To solve this problem, she offers the neighboring boy $5 per day to spend time with her cats. This option is more likely than Option A (the boy punches her in the face) as it shows a more reasonable and kind-hearted response from the neighboring boy."
Response:  Option A: They apologized and gave us another pizza.
"Response: 
B) Henry was disgusted and spat the muffin out. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Henry encountered an unexpected and unpleasant surprise when he bit into the muffin only to find a worm emerging from inside. This would likely cause him to be disgusted and immediately spit the muffin out, rather than continuing to eat it with no reaction."
"Response: 
B - Bob loved the new color he chose. 
Explanation:  Based on the context of the story, it makes more sense that Bob would be happy with the new color he chose for his dream car rather than wishing it were the original color. This is because he went out of his way to have it repainted, indicating that he wanted to change the color. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: It was hard work.
Explanation: The context of the story suggests that my aunt worked long hours, which implies that it was difficult or challenging for her. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
B - It took him 2 weeks in the hospital to recuperate. 
Explanation: The story states that Joe was ""badly injured"" after being stabbed, which suggests that he required extensive medical treatment and time to recover. Two weeks in the hospital is a reasonable amount of time for someone to be treated and recover from such an injury. Option A is unlikely because there is no mention of Joe going to the cafeteria or having a meal after his attack."
"Response: 
B) He was pleased.
Explanation: In this story, Fred took the time to build and set up his own patio furniture, indicating that he put effort into creating something he wanted or needed. When the rainstorm damaged the furniture, instead of being upset about it, Fred could be pleased with the fact that he made something that he can enjoy despite the damage. This choice reflects a more positive outlook on life."
Response:  Option A: He was proud of himself.
"Response: 
B: His professors reassured him that medical school was no picnic. 
Explanation: The story states that John was struggling in law school, but then he meets with his professors and gets extra tutoring. This suggests that John's academic performance improved as a result of these efforts. However, the second option implies that John's professors are unsupportive and tell him that medical school is difficult, which goes against the tone of the first part of the story. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
Response:  Option B: Harold found the address was correct but the city was not.  This option is more likely because Harold would have already checked the address when he picked up the package at the post office or delivery center before delivering it. If the address was incorrect, he would have noticed that earlier during his route.
"Response:  Option B: Amy hated bright colors. 
Explanation: In this story, we are told that Amy chose a bright red nail polish color, which suggests that she does not typically prefer bright or bold colors. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice for Amy's preference."
"Response: 
B - David decided that he enjoys boats after all.
Explanation: Based on the story, it seems that David had never been on a boat before and was initially nervous about it. However, as he started to enjoy himself during the ride with John's family, his nerves subsided and he discovered a newfound appreciation for boating. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Nancy demanded she be given the other six inches she asked for."
"Response: 
B: You fell asleep completely. 
Explanation: The story states that you were extremely tired after math class, which suggests that you may have been feeling fatigued or sleepy. It also mentions that you waited several hours for your mom to pick you up, which further supports the idea that you might have fallen asleep while waiting. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B) She couldn't wait to be back in the house.
Explanation: The story states that Amy's low spirits were lifted by being outside, but it also implies that she didn't want to stay there for long. The phrase ""just being outside began to lift her low spirits"" suggests that she only felt better temporarily, and the fact that she couldn't wait to be back in the house indicates that she wasn't eager to spend more time outdoors. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: I was very pale when I got home. 
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist applied sunscreen before leaving for the beach but failed to reapply it throughout the day. This means they were exposed to direct sunlight without proper protection, resulting in a sunburn. Therefore, option A (I got a sunburn) is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: Jane had a natural talent. 
Explanation: The story states that after only three weeks of training with a professional juggler, Jane was able to juggle on her own. This suggests that she has a natural talent for juggling, as it can take longer than three weeks for someone without prior experience or a natural aptitude for juggling to learn the skill."
"Response: 
B - Tim decided to never eat noodles again. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is unlikely that Tim will order takeout or delivery because he doesn't have the sauce for his noodles. Instead, given his strong preference for pasta, it makes more sense that he will find an alternative way to prepare his meal without the sauce. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Betty loved to share her opinions."
"Response:  Option A: Bella’s friends were very frightened by her story. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that Bella's friends were frightened by her story than that she remained silent and skipped her turn. The fact that they all had s'mores dangling over the fire suggests that they are in a relaxed atmosphere, enjoying each other's company, and looking forward to hearing each other's stories. Therefore, when Bella takes her turn and tells a scary story, it is likely that her friends will be engaged and receptive to what she has to say, rather than being uninterested or bored. Additionally, the fact that Bella puts her ""best acting"" to use suggests that she is trying to make an impact on her friends, which further supports the idea that they were frightened by her story."
"Response: 
B - Jasper is disappointed. 
Explanation: In this story, Jasper purchases an anti-dandruff shampoo but still experiences dandruff after using it. This suggests that the product did not work as expected, leading to Jasper's disappointment. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for this story."
"Response: 
B: Jane was very thankful of Bob's generosity. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bob has just given one of his vital organs to someone he doesn't even know, purely out of selflessness. This act of kindness is unlikely to be met with anything other than gratitude from Jane. It would be unreasonable for Jane to be ""bad"" towards Bob in response to such an incredible gift, especially considering their prior relationship was nonexistent beforehand. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome in this situation."
"Response: 
B - Amy was distraught. 
Explanation:  The context of the story suggests that Amy is upset about losing her luggage. She goes to the help desk to report it missing, indicating that she is worried or anxious about not having her belongings. Option B better captures this emotional state than Option A, which implies that Amy finds the situation amusing or humorous."
"Response: 
B: Now Paige is smoke-free and happy. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Paige successfully quit smoking and is now smoke-free and happy. The story mentions that Paige gradually reduced her smoking over time until she no longer experienced cravings, which suggests that she was able to successfully quit. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Gina got dehydrated.
Explanation: In this story, Gina's parents are more concerned about reaching their destination than ensuring her basic needs are met. As a result, she becomes dehydrated due to lack of access to water. This outcome is more likely than her experiencing stomachaches, as dehydration can have more severe consequences if left untreated."
"Response: 
B: All his friends were jealous of his new physique. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it makes sense that all of Ray's friends would be jealous of his new physique since he had been working hard to improve it. They may have felt insecure about their own bodies compared to Ray's toned and muscular appearance at the beach. This choice aligns with the theme of social comparison and the potential for feelings of inadequacy when comparing oneself to others."
"Response: 
B: Cristin decided not to go to the festival next year. 
Explanation: The fact that Cristin's favorite band's performance was cancelled suggests that she may have lost interest in attending future festivals if they continue to have last-minute cancellations or changes. Option B best reflects this possibility, as it implies that Cristin will choose not to attend the festival again due to past disappointments."
"Response: 
B - Paul became a manager at the restaurant.
Explanation: The story states that customers suggested Paul's nice voice could be used for radio, but it does not indicate that he actually pursued this career path. Instead, Paul quit his job at the fast food restaurant to become a manager there. This outcome makes more sense given the context of the story."
"Response: 
B: Larry started making regular trips to see his Aunt. 
Explanation: The story states that Larry ""decided to take the long trip to Idaho to see [his] Aunt"" and that she was ""very happy to see [him]"" which implies that he will continue to make regular visits to see her."
"Response: 
B - Amy decided to buy water. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Amy needs something to help her wake up and combat her coffee crash. However, since there's no coffee machine available, she decides to opt for water instead of a sugary soda like Pepsi. This choice makes more sense given that water is a natural source of hydration and doesn't contain any added sugar or artificial ingredients that could make her feel worse. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Reba was just like her dad. 
Explanation:  The story states that Reba's father went to prison for murder, which suggests that he has a history of violence and criminal behavior. This implies that there may be a genetic component to his actions, and that Reba may have inherited some of these tendencies from him. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Reba, as it suggests that she may also have a violent streak within her."
"Response: 
B: The family agreed to sell their house. 
Explanation: In this story, Cindy has grown tired of doing all the cooking and cleaning by herself and decides that she will no longer do it unless someone else helps her. The family realizes how much work she does for them and agrees to sell their house in order to hire a maid service to help with the household chores. This option is more likely because it shows that the family is willing to make changes in order to alleviate some of the burden on Cindy."
"Response: 
B: Jeb got the date but never ate peppermints again.
Explanation: In this story, Jeb's love interest was attracted to him because he always carried peppermints with him. If he continued to eat them after getting the date, it would be inconsistent with the reason she agreed to go out with him. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
Option B: Billy started reading his book out loud to the frog. 
Explanation: The story states that Billy likes sitting by the pond, looking out onto it, and there is a frog staring back at him. This implies that Billy is aware of the presence of the frog and may even be interested in it. Reading a book out loud to an animal is not something people typically do, so option B is more plausible than option A."
"Response: 
Option A: I bought the pen."
"Response: 
B - She felt it was meant to be. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Jen and her friend have been spending time together in a social setting, sharing drinks and singing carols as a group. This implies that they have a strong connection and are comfortable around each other. When they share a romantic moment during the party, Jen feels that it's meant to be, indicating that she may be developing feelings for him beyond their friendship. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B: Tom was elated!
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Tom would feel happy and excited about getting accepted onto American Idol rather than feeling disappointed. Getting the opportunity to showcase his singing talent on a popular TV show is usually seen as a positive experience, especially for someone who has been passionate about singing since they were five years old."
"Response:  Option B: Jay wished he had eaten more buffalo wings. This option best completes the sentence ""At the end of the festival, Jay was so stuffed full of Buffalo wings..."" because it implies that he enjoyed the food so much that he wanted more."
"Response: 
B - They told you that they hadn't seen your cat.
Explanation: The story states ""They also play it at night,"" which implies that the noise disturbance occurs at night as well. Since the speaker has already asked their neighbors to lower the volume once before, it is unlikely that they would agree again without any resistance or excuses from their neighbors. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
B - Joe hoped they were valuable. 
Explanation: The story states that Joe ""gathered them all up to be appraised in town."" This implies that Joe expected the stones to have some value, otherwise he would not have bothered to take them to a professional appraiser. Option B is therefore the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Robert starts to feel better after playing with puppies. 
Explanation: In this story, Robert's dog passing away has left him feeling sad and upset. When his wife suggests going shopping for a new dog, Robert initially resists but eventually agrees to tag along. As soon as he sees the puppies, he starts to feel better and becomes excited about the possibility of getting a new furry friend. This suggests that being around puppies helped Robert to cope with his grief and start feeling better. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Lulu paid twenty-five cents for a full bucket of candy."
"Response: 
B: Teresa was so happy. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Teresa would be happy about having a new baby sister than feeling sad or neglected. The fact that she was ""excited to have a new baby sister"" suggests that she was looking forward to this event and was eager to meet her new sibling."
"Response: 
B: Sal found out he wasn't alone. 
Explanation: In this story, Sal feels intimidated and isolated at school until another student approaches him and reveals they feel the same way. This suggests that Sal isn't alone in his feelings, which aligns with option B. Option A implies that Sal finds out no one else feels like him, which would be an unlikely outcome given the context of the story."
"Response: 
B - My roommate was very pleasant to live with.
Explanation:  This answer choice is more likely because it aligns better with the tone of the story, which suggests that the speaker has a relatively positive relationship with their roommate despite the issue with the dirty dish. Option A would not be consistent with this tone, as it implies a confrontational or unpleasant dynamic between the two roommates."
"Response: 
Option B: Jason got a raise at work for being so good at working a PC. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Jason's proficiency in using a PC at work leads to him receiving a positive outcome, such as a raise. It is unlikely that he would be reprimanded or punished for using a different type of computer than what is provided by his office."
"Response: 
B: The day was very stressful.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that the husband's day was quite busy with work-related tasks such as surfing the net, which suggests that he may have been feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Additionally, the fact that his wife slept in late and didn't get up until 10 AM implies that she may have also been feeling relaxed and unrushed, which could further contribute to the idea that the day was stressful for the husband. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B) I put the pancakes in the freezer.
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist was very hungry, indicating that they wanted to eat the pancakes immediately. However, putting the pancakes in the freezer suggests that they may have intended to save some for later or keep them fresh for longer. This option is more likely than Option A, which implies that the protagonist devoured the pancakes without any intention of saving them for later."
"Response: 
B - Keri convinced the waiter that she had overcharged her.
Explanation: The story states that Keri ""needed to put (her niece) to sleep early."" This implies that Keri has been trying to get the niece to settle down, but the niece has been resisting. It's unlikely that Keri would take the niece for a walk to tire her out at this point, as it would be counterproductive to her goal of getting the niece to sleep. Instead, option B is more plausible, as it suggests that Keri is looking for an excuse to leave the restaurant without paying for the meal."
"Response: 
B - Kim puts her things down and decides to go to a movie instead. 
Explanation: The story states that after buying an outfit to match the shoes, Kim decides to head home. This implies that she has spent all of her money and does not have any more funds available for additional purchases. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Erica was so grateful that her professor was understanding."
"Response: 
B) He was the most loved man in the neighborhood.
Explanation: The story suggests that the person's elaborate costumes and pranks were well-received by their neighbors, with them being ""the most loved man in the neighborhood"" as a result of their efforts. Option A does not align with this conclusion, as it implies that they stopped participating in Halloween activities altogether, which would not have been a logical response given the positive reception they received."
"Response: 
B - Ben saw Tom and ran for his life.
Explanation: The story sets the scene for something ominous to happen, with Ben being scared by strange noises in the dark. When Tom walks out of the shadows laughing, it creates an eerie atmosphere and suggests that something sinister may be happening. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome as Ben sees Tom and runs away in fear."
"Response: 
Option B: Barry threw his bowling ball into the pool."
Response:  Option A: The family had a good day. This option best fits with the positive tone of the story, which describes the family preparing food and enjoying a picnic together. It suggests that they are having a pleasant time together, rather than experiencing a bad day.
Response:  Option A: They both had a good time at the concert. 
"Response: 
B - After graduation, she realized she hated the News. 
Explanation: The passage states that Melissa ""practiced on camera"" and had an ""obsession with being a news reporter,"" but after graduating from college, she realizes she hates the news. This suggests that her passion for reporting may not have been sustainable or genuine, and that she may have been driven by external factors rather than internal motivations."
"Response:  Option B: Dot was now considered the cool mom. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Dot's sudden change in behavior from strict to relaxed and fun-loving parenting style has made her more popular among her children. This suggests that she has become the ""cool"" or trendy mom, who is able to connect better with her kids by letting loose and having fun together. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: They went inside to roast marshmallows. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is unlikely that the boys would take their clothes off to sunbathe (Option A) since it is cold enough outside to build a snowman and fort, and they are engaging in activities that require warm clothing. It is more plausible that they would go inside to roast marshmallows after building their snow structure, as this activity can be done indoors where it is warmer."
"Response: 
B - I almost cracked my phone. 
Explanation: In this story, the speaker struggled to get their phone out of their pocket due to how tightly they were dressed. This suggests that the speaker may have been wearing clothing that was too small or constrictive for them, which could potentially cause discomfort or accidents like phones falling out of pockets. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome in this scenario."
"Response: 
B - Bobby let the snow cover him from head to foot. 
Explanation: Based on the text, it seems that Bobby enjoys being in the snow and experiencing its sensory qualities. Option B suggests that he went outside and allowed himself to be fully covered by the snow, which aligns with this preference. In contrast, option A implies that Bobby was simply lying down to relax or get a tan, which does not fit with the context of the story."
"Response: 
Option A: If Garry doesn't improve his grades, he will be off the team. 
Explanation: The context of the story suggests that Garry's coach is more concerned about Garry's academic performance than anything else. The coach has made it clear that good grades are necessary for being on the football team, and if Garry fails to meet this requirement, he will be removed from the team. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Evan was pleased. 
Explanation: The story states that Evan complained about everything his girlfriend made for him, including the food she cooked. This suggests that he has a negative attitude towards her efforts in the kitchen, which would make him pleased if she left mid-cooking without finishing the meal. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: John felt proud.
Explanation: The story suggests that John initially underestimated the physical demands of yoga, but after struggling to keep up during the class, he became proud of himself for pushing through and completing it. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Ava took good care of her son. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any evidence that Ava is a neglectful mother. In fact, it suggests quite the opposite. Ava went out of her way to find her son's missing shoes before buying him new ones. This shows that she takes good care of her child and wants to make sure he has everything he needs. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Harry had always hated the water. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that suggests Harry enjoys or has ever enjoyed swimming. In fact, it explicitly states that he is tired of the hot summer days, which could imply that he finds the heat unbearable. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Harry's character."
"Response:  Option B: Danny did a great job. This is because the story states that Danny's friend ""taught him"" how to make fried rice, indicating that Danny was able to learn and do a good job at making it."
"Response: 
B - Meghan decided to quit her job. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Meghan did not get the promotion she desired after talking to her boss. Instead of waiting for another opportunity or finding alternative ways to gain more responsibilities within the company, Meghan decided to leave her job altogether. This suggests that option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) They decided to congratulate Core. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Core's parents are angry or upset about the broken vase. Instead, they come into the room without shoes, which suggests that they may be in a relaxed state of mind. Given this context, it is more likely that they will decide to congratulate Core rather than punish her for breaking the vase."
"Response: 
Option A: Bob worked hard and eventually solved the puzzle. 
Explanation: The story states that Bob initially struggled with solving the Rubik's Cube but eventually managed to solve half of it. This suggests that Bob persisted in trying to solve the puzzle despite facing challenges, which is consistent with Option A. It is less likely that Bob would give up on the puzzle without making any progress (as suggested by Option B)."
"Response: 
Option B: Tim canceled the vacation. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Tim was happy with his girlfriend's reaction to the gift. In fact, it states that she was ""so grateful"" for the vacation, which suggests that she was pleased with the surprise. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Suzie tasted the sauce, and it was just right. 
Explanation: In this story, Suzie decides to make her grandmother's spaghetti sauce, which suggests that she has a positive connection with her grandmother. Adding mushrooms and seasonings to the sauce shows that she is trying to honor her grandmother's recipe. When she finally tastes the sauce, it turns out to be ""just right,"" indicating that she has successfully recreated her grandmother's dish. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B) I purchased a taco at the food court. 
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist ""went to the store [they] had selected,"" which implies that they were looking for something specific (i.e., shoes). However, the chosen answer (B) suggests that instead of buying shoes, the protagonist opted to purchase a taco at the food court. This outcome is unlikely given the context of the story. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Before she finished, Gabby decided it was a waste of time. 
Explanation: The story states that Gabby doesn't have much money and spends what little she has on a lottery ticket. This suggests that she may not be in a financial position to afford to play the lottery regularly or even frequently. Therefore, before she finishes scratching off the ticket, she may decide that playing the lottery is not worth her limited resources."
"Response: 
B: Annie's family was sad. 
Explanation: The story states that Annie's grandfather needed a heart transplant and was in the hospital for a very long time. This implies that he was sick for an extended period, which could have caused worry and stress for his family. Additionally, the fact that they were ""scared"" when the transplant occurred suggests that they were anxious about the procedure and its potential outcomes. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
B: I felt more lonely. 
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist felt lonely on their first day of school, and then another student introduced themselves. This may have made the protagonist feel even more isolated or alone, as they were now aware of someone else's presence in their new environment without feeling any closer connection to them. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Larry laughed with joy as he drove over the bridge. 
Explanation: The story states that Larry has a fear of heights but then drives over a tall bridge without showing any signs of anxiety or discomfort. This suggests that Larry may have overcome his fear or learned to manage it in some way, leading him to experience joy while driving over the bridge."
"Response: 
B - Jeff hates spending time with his in-laws."
"Response: 
Option B: The cat ended up squeaky clean."
"Response: 
B) I told the manager I wanted to file a complaint. 
Explanation: In this story, the speaker's family ate all of the food in their family meal without leaving any for the speaker. This is not something that the speaker would be happy about, so option A (being happy they found a new favorite restaurant) is unlikely. Instead, the speaker will probably want to tell the manager about the issue and file a complaint, which is why option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B) Humberto jumped on his trampoline all day the next day. 
Explanation: The story states that Humberto ""decided to retire"" from jumping on the trampoline after falling off and hurting himself. However, the very next sentence states that he ""jumped on his trampoline all day the next day."" This suggests that despite his previous fall, Humberto was willing to take the risk of jumping on the trampoline again, indicating that he may not have been as cautious or careful as he claimed to be."
"Response: 
A: Tammy felt jealous when she saw Matt and Emma together."
"Response: 
B - Ben's hand was sore and he had to pull out all of the needles. 
Explanation: In this story, Ben's hand came into contact with a cactus and became covered in thorns or needles. This would likely cause discomfort and pain for Ben, and he may have to take steps to remove the needles from his hand. Option B accurately reflects this outcome."
"Response: 
B: Janet realized she had to finally face her fear. 
Explanation: The story states that Janet was afraid of flying, but then she found out that the only way to reach her sick mother quickly was by plane. This situation forces Janet to confront her fear and take the flight, which is why option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: Nate laughed with his friends about his roommate's behavior. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Nate decides to take advantage of his roommate by asking them to do something they don't want to do (sweeping the floor) in exchange for money. When the roommate doesn't follow through on their end of the deal, Nate has two options: he can either try to confront them or he can laugh about the situation with his friends. Given that Nate is described as ""notoriously lazy,"" it seems more likely that he would choose option B and laugh about the situation rather than trying to address it directly."
"Response: 
B) He brought a full-sized woman to his company's holiday party. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Elena has low self-esteem due to her small stature, which may lead her to believe that no one will want to date her. However, when she meets a nice full-sized man who accepts her for who she is, it's possible that he could be trying to make her feel more comfortable or secure by bringing a full-sized woman to a social event as a way of showing off his acceptance of her. This option is more likely than Option A because it aligns with the themes of insecurity and self-acceptance present throughout the story."
"Response: 
B: Jay immediately knew her fears were unfounded. 
Explanation: The story states that Jay was ""nervous"" about being an aunt but then saw her nephew and realized her fears were unfounded. This suggests that Jay had initial doubts or concerns about being an aunt, but once she met her nephew, those fears disappeared. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Jon was glad he left the house. 
Explanation: The fact that Jon got into an accident on the way to buy water suggests that something unexpected happened while he was out of the house. This means that Jon might be grateful for having left the house to get water, even though he encountered an unfortunate event along the way. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Darla smashed her television with a rake. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Darla would be unhappy with her new television and decide to destroy it rather than being excited about it. Smashing a television with a rake is an extreme action that suggests Darla's dissatisfaction or frustration with the purchase."
"Response: 
B - The prick got infected and she had to take antibiotics.
Explanation:  In this story, Lilly pricks her finger on a thorn while growing white roses in her garden. While this could potentially lead to injury or infection, there is no indication that her finger would need to be amputated. Instead, it is more likely that she would experience some discomfort and swelling from the prick, which could lead to an infection if not properly treated. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Lilly's situation."
"Response: 
B - Jimmy hated his mother.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Jimmy's mother started to get better after he visited her in the hospital. In fact, the story states that she was ""very gracious,"" which suggests that she may have been grateful for Jimmy's visit but still ill. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B) She went to school and suffered through the pain. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Sammy has a bad stomachache but still decides to go to school despite feeling uncomfortable. Therefore, option B is more likely as it aligns with the character's decision-making based on their situation."
"Response: 
B - Karmen immediately exited the plane. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Karmen would exit the plane after landing rather than during takeoff."
"Response: 
B - Sandy was prepared.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Sandy took steps to prepare for the snowstorm before it arrived, such as stocking up on food and water, boarding up windows, or having a backup generator. This would be consistent with someone who wants to protect their home and themselves during a dangerous weather event. Making a snowman, on the other hand, does not seem like an appropriate response to a severe snowstorm."
"Response: 
Option A: Quentin ended up enjoying the party. 
Explanation: The story states that Quentin ""ordinarily does not enjoy going to company events,"" which suggests that he typically feels uncomfortable in social situations like parties. However, in this particular instance, he decided to attend despite his reservations and found that he actually enjoyed himself. This implies that he was able to overcome his initial discomfort and have a good time at the party. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Finally the sale went through. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it seems that the speaker had difficulty placing an order for Mister Spice no sodium sauce online due to technical issues with the website. However, after several attempts, they were finally able to complete the purchase. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Dan made his own Devil costume.
Explanation: The story states that Dan was too afraid to ask his father for a costume, so he went to his grandmother instead. It also mentions that Dan decided to make his own Devil costume, which suggests that he took matters into his own hands rather than relying on someone else to provide it for him. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B: Franz is glad he went to visit his cousin.
Explanation: The story states that Franz had a ""terrific"" time with his cousin, suggesting that he enjoyed their visit together. It is unlikely that Franz would vow to never visit his cousin again after having such a positive experience. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of Franz's decision to visit his cousin."
"Response: 
B: After several weeks, the horned toad was very fat. 
Explanation: In this story, the author mentions that they tried to feed the horned toad but it would not eat. This suggests that the toad may have been malnourished or underfed for some time. However, since the author states that the toad was ""very fat"" after several weeks, it is more likely that the toad had access to enough food at some point during its captivity to gain weight rather than dying from starvation."
"Response: 
B - You never heard from her again."
"Response: 
B) Her friend ended up buying the candy for her. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it's more likely that Kelly's friend would offer to buy the candy for her since they ran into each other by chance at the store. It's unlikely that both of them would be arrested for running into each other in a random encounter."
"Response: 
B) Don knew he would have to improve.  
Explanation: The story states that Don dropped a heavy shipment, which suggests that he made a mistake. Rather than being relieved or unconcerned about the incident (as suggested in option A), Don recognizes that he needs to improve his performance in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future. This choice better aligns with the tone of the story, which implies that Don is learning from his errors and taking steps to improve."
"Response: 
B: Dal made a smart decision.  
Explanation: In this scenario, Dal's decision to work as an accountant for a local gang may seem risky or even illegal, but it also shows that he was resourceful and willing to take on new challenges. By being involved with the gang, he gained access to valuable information about their financial dealings, which could have helped him prepare for his future education. Unfortunately, things took a tragic turn when the feds raided the gang and Dal was caught in the crossfire. However, his decision to get involved with the gang ultimately led to his death, so it can be argued that he made a smart decision by taking advantage of the opportunity presented to him, even if it ended in tragedy."
"Response: 
A) Alice felt good after the photographer complemented her. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that Alice felt happy and confident after the photographer complimented her. The story mentions that Alice's mother had bought her a new outfit and fixe her hair, indicating that she was making an effort to look nice for the pictures. When the photographer compliments her, it would have made Alice feel even better about herself and her appearance. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B: Nila loved her mom.
Explanation: The story states that Nila ""knew her mom did not have a long time to live"" and she made sure to provide her mom with a good life until her death, which suggests that Nila had a strong emotional bond with her mother and cared deeply about her well-being. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - The boy had a very happy childhood. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that the boy had a happy childhood than suffered through one. The mother's desire to give her son a happy childhood suggests that she prioritized providing a nurturing environment for him. Additionally, the fact that she sacrificed time and energy to achieve this goal further implies that she put great effort into creating a positive experience for her son. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option B: Each of her brothers opened their Christmas presents. 
"Response: 
B: Jan brought the books back. 
Explanation:  In a Montessori classroom, children are encouraged to explore their interests and learn through hands-on activities. The teacher's role is to provide a prepared environment that allows for independent learning and exploration. If Jan believed in the importance of imagination and fantasy, she would not have thrown away Kim's books but rather brought them back to share with the entire class or find other ways to incorporate them into the curriculum."
"Response: 
B: All three of us were very disappointed. 
Explanation: The story states that the three friends were assigned to the same classroom, which suggests that they will be separated and not able to spend time together as much as they would like. This is a negative outcome, so option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Jeff was going to miss that dog. 
Explanation: In this story, Jeff is initially annoyed by the barking of his neighbor's dog. However, when the neighbor gives the dog away, Jeff expresses happiness at not hearing the barking anymore. This suggests that Jeff has grown accustomed to the sound of the dog's barking and will miss it once it is gone. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Holly gave her brother money as compensation. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Holly's brother intentionally created a design on her back using suntan lotion without her consent. This could be considered disrespectful or mean-spirited behavior, so Holly might choose to give her brother money as compensation for what he did. It's unlikely she would yell at him since this outcome doesn't seem to address any anger or frustration she may have felt in the situation."
"Response: 
B - I never made fun of my wife and her nightlight again.
Explanation: The story reveals that the speaker used to make fun of his wife for using a nightlight, but after experiencing the consequences of not having one himself (tripping and getting a bad bruise), he stopped making fun of her. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: However the experience was no fun without her friends. 
Explanation: Amy's decision to move to Florida alone means that she will not have the support or company of her friends during the transition. This can make the experience more challenging and less enjoyable for her. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) She felt buyer’s remorse after the purchase."
"Response: 
Option B: Amayah is sad because she doesn't want a tea party. "
"Response:  Option A: I really enjoyed meeting some new boys. 
Explanation: The story mentions that ""some other people"" joined in while playing at the beach with the narrator's group of boys. This implies that there were additional individuals present beyond just the narrator and his companions, which supports option A as the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: I took a shower and went to work. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems unlikely that the person would spend an hour deciding which movie to rent and then immediately go to work after watching it. It's more plausible that they would watch the movie at home before going to work."
"Response: 
B: Paula tore up her poem. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Paula's friends are supportive despite her poor spoken word skills. However, when she starts delivering her poem at the party, she realizes that it's not as good as she thought it was and decides to tear it up instead of continuing to perform it. This option is more likely because it shows Paula being self-aware and honest about her limitations, rather than blindly relying on her friends' support without improving her craft."
"Response: 
B - I knew someone would soon return the phone. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems more likely that the person will eventually get their phone back rather than having it stolen. The fact that the customer service representative mentioned a call being made to Jamaica suggests that the owner of the phone may have been trying to contact them from another location. Additionally, the phrase ""since there was service on it"" implies that the phone was still active when the person canceled it, which could indicate that the owner has not yet turned it off or disposed of it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Iris had a lot of fun at her party. 
Explanation: The story states that Iris ""had a lot of fun"" at her party, which suggests that she enjoyed herself. It is unlikely that she would decide never to have cake again after having such a good time."
"Response: 
B: Tina's friends knew how unpredictable she was. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Tina is someone who likes to surprise people, and her friends are used to her being unpredictable. Therefore, they were not surprised by her wearing a blue bikini instead of a red one. This option best captures the tone and theme of the story."
"Response: 
B: Ted was grateful to his father for the help. 
Explanation: The story states that Ted's father helped to split the down payment on a home with Ted, indicating that Ted did indeed become a homeowner with the help of his father. This contradicts option A, which states that Ted no longer wanted to be a homeowner. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that Ted was grateful to his father for the help in achieving his long-held goal of becoming a homeowner."
"Response: 
B) She fled in terror."
"Response: 
B - They decided not to see each other any more. 
Explanation: The story does not provide enough information to determine whether Ed and Ethan, or Sami and Sara, are interested in continuing their relationships beyond the initial date. It's possible that they may have enjoyed each other's company during the date but did not feel a strong connection or chemistry to pursue anything further. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Marco is horrified by the reaction of his boss. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Marco's decision to wear a necktie in an effort to make a good impression backfires when his boss reacts negatively to it. This could be because the boss has a specific dress code policy that prohibits ties, or simply because they don't appreciate the gesture. Either way, Marco is left feeling embarrassed and regretful about his choice."
"Response: 
B: Tim started traveling a lot of places by airplane. 
Explanation: The story states that Tim enjoyed his first flight, which means he found it enjoyable enough to want to do it again in the future. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Tim's travel plans."
"Response: 
B: Lucy failed the test because she had not studied. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Lucy did not study enough for the test and therefore failed. The fact that she only studied all day the next day suggests that she didn't have enough time to adequately prepare for the test beforehand."
"Response: 
B - Fred started a mystery novel book club for his friends. 
Explanation:  The story states that when Fred's friends found out he liked mystery novels, they all bought him one for his birthday. This implies that Fred's friends are interested in sharing their enthusiasm with him, rather than giving him space from the genre. Starting a book club is a way for them to continue engaging with Fred's interest together, which aligns with their desire to spend time with him. Option A does not fit as it goes against the direction of the narrative, where Fred's friends want to deepen their connection with him through shared reading."
"Response: 
B - Relieved"
"Response: 
B) They went back the next day. 
Explanation: The story describes Sarah and her friends having fun at the water park, which suggests that they enjoyed themselves there. It's unlikely that they would vow never to return after only one visit (option A), especially if they had a good time. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Jeb was excited to build a new one."
"Response: 
B: Jeff was bored and upset.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems more likely that Jeff would be bored and upset than have a fun time. The fact that the rainy forest isn't exciting and there's nothing to do suggests that Jeff may not enjoy himself, which aligns with option B."
"Response: 
B: Dani got to know her father much better.
Explanation: The passage states that as Dani's father recovered, they were able to talk and get to know each other better. This suggests that their relationship improved during this time. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - So she happily became friends with Jane.
Explanation: In this scenario, Gina has just learned that Jane is the sister of someone who has been a thorn in her side for quite some time (Joe). However, instead of feeling resentful or hostile towards Jane because of their sibling relationship, Gina decides to approach her with an open mind and become friends with her. This suggests that Gina is not one to hold grudges or let past conflicts dictate her interactions with others, and is more interested in building positive relationships than perpetuating negativity."

"Response: 
B - Neil composed a photo album when he got home."

B) He bought some soda with it."
"Response: 
B: The party went great.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that the addition of the disco ball made a significant difference in the success of the party. Without it, Anna felt like something was missing, which suggests that the ball played an important role in enhancing the overall experience. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) He destroyed it as soon as he got home.
Explanation: The story states that Oscar ""had a hard time deciding which tree to get"" and then ""opted on a Bonsai tree."" This implies that Oscar was not experienced or knowledgeable about taking care of plants, particularly one as delicate as a Bonsai tree. Therefore, it is more likely that he would accidentally damage or destroy the tree once he brought it home, rather than having it match his home decor perfectly."
"Response: 
B - I walked off the court and never looked back. 
Explanation: In this scenario, you are not interested in playing basketball or contributing to your team's success. You would rather walk away from the situation than put forth any effort or take risks. This behavior is consistent with someone who has low self-esteem and lacks confidence in their abilities."
"Response: 
B: Dirk liked how it sounded. 
Explanation:  The story states that Dirk ""finished the performance as best he could,"" which implies that he did not let the broken key stop him from playing. Additionally, the fact that he continued to play suggests that he found a way to make the music work despite the obstacle. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Eva was able to pet one of the squirrels."
"Response: 
B) Andy was sad about it."
"Response: 
B - I felt foolish."
"Response: 
B: I plan to cut them into strips. 
Explanation: In this story, the speaker mentions that they are happy with the new sheets because they ""look nicer"" and ""feel better."" This suggests that they value aesthetics and comfort when it comes to their bedding. Given this information, it is more likely that the speaker would consider cutting the sheets into strips for use in other projects, rather than being concerned about the cost of the sheets."
"Response: 
Option B: Chase ran away from home. "
"Response: 
B) Renee was glad she decided to learn to play drums. 
Explanation:  In this story, Renee is not enjoying playing guitar because she doesn't like pressing the strings with her fingers. This suggests that she may find it more enjoyable to play another instrument, such as drums, where she can use her hands in a different way. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Renee."
"Response: 
Option B: They baked Bill some bread in appreciation for all the fish. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bill's generosity has led to his neighbors being able to feed themselves again, which is something they are very grateful for. It makes sense that they would want to show their gratitude by doing something nice for Bill, such as baking him bread. Option A is unlikely because it doesn't make sense that Bill's neighbors would sue him for helping them out when they were struggling financially."
"Response: 
B - We were happy to not have Internet and to drink. 
Explanation: The story states that the couple was ""bored out of their minds"" without the internet, but they still found something enjoyable to do by simply talking and drinking together. This suggests that they valued the quality time spent together more than the availability of technology. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Tim became a professional musician.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is most likely that Tim became a professional musician after recording his songs at the studio. The fact that Tim practiced all day, every day, and was happy when he finally got the chance to record his songs suggests that he has a strong passion for music and is dedicated to pursuing a career in it. Additionally, the decision of the studio to record him implies that they recognized his talent and potential as a musician. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Tim's story."
"Response: 
Option A: They gave him a flea medication, which cleared up the problem. This option is more likely because it addresses the root cause of the issue (the fleas) rather than ignoring it or taking no action at all."
"Response: 
Option A: Haley felt like she had been betrayed. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Haley's colleague stole her research without permission or credit. This would be considered a betrayal of trust and a violation of academic integrity. It is unlikely that Haley would feel supported by such actions, rather she would likely feel upset, angry, and disillusioned with her colleague and the scientific community as a whole."
"Response: 
B) Sam had a terrible hangover the next day. "
"Response: 
B - Katie decided to pour the milk down the drain."
"Response: 
Option A: But everything was okay as soon as they hugged and ate dinner. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Tom's decision to bring home his wife's favorite meal as a surprise was a thoughtful gesture to make up for her bad day at work. When he arrives late due to traffic, it doesn't seem to have a significant impact on their relationship. Instead, the moment they hug and eat together, everything seems to be fine again, indicating that their love and connection are more important than any minor inconvenience or delay. Therefore, option A is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B) They decided to buy the Viking stove."
"Response: 
B: The teacher caught her and praised her ingenuity.
Explanation: In this scenario, Jasmine tried to cheat on a test without studying, but when she looked at her neighbor's paper, she found that they had also cheated. Rather than punishing Jasmine for cheating, the teacher may recognize that Jasmine took a creative approach to solving the problem of not having studied for the test. By praising Jasmine's ingenuity, the teacher acknowledges that Jasmine showed resourcefulness in finding an alternative solution, even if it was not within the rules of the test."
"Response: 
B) Sam felt very depressed. 
Explanation:  The story states that after two months of trying to make it as an actor, Sam found himself sleeping in his car and begging for food at the Chinese Theatre. This suggests that Sam has been struggling with poverty and homelessness, which can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Sam's situation."
"Response: 
B - Ben was able to get home quickly. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Ben had a busy day at work and got stuck in traffic, but it doesn't mention anything about him becoming sick because of hunger. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
Response:  Option B: There were no keys in his pockets. This ending is more likely because it aligns with the information provided in the story, that Darren cannot find his car keys despite looking all over his house and asking his wife where they might be. It also provides a logical conclusion to the story without introducing any new or unexpected elements.
"Response: 
B) I bought all of them. 
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist found three ties he liked, but it does not mention anything about buying only one of them. In fact, the tone of the passage suggests that the protagonist was excitedly looking through multiple options before making a purchase, which would be consistent with buying more than one tie. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: A few days later, Harry heard that he made the team. 
Explanation: The story states ""Harry attended the tryouts for the team."" This implies that there was some sort of evaluation or assessment process involved in selecting players for the team. Since Harry attended the tryouts, it is likely that he participated in this process and found out whether or not he made the team a few days later. Option A is therefore unlikely, as there is no indication in the story that Harry quit the team after trying out."
"Response: 
B) Sue continued to ride the elephant. 
Explanation: In this story, Little Sue initially enjoyed riding the elephant at the zoo, but then became scared and cried for her mom. However, since she was already on the elephant, it would be unlikely that she would want to switch to petting a goat instead. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that Sue continued to ride the elephant with the help of the zookeeper."
"Response: 
B - Her parents were very proud. 
Explanation: The story states that Hannah's parents were ""very proud"" of her for winning the art competition, which suggests that they supported and encouraged her throughout her journey as an artist. It is unlikely that they would undermine her achievement by claiming that her grandmother did most of the work, as this would go against their expressed pride in her accomplishment. Therefore, option B is the more plausible conclusion to the story."
"Response: 
B) Jim was hurt and had to call 911. "
"Response: 
B - I threw out all my old socks and bought all plain white socks.
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that the speaker will choose option B because they mentioned being tired of searching for matching socks and wanting to simplify their life by throwing away their old socks and buying plain white ones instead. The fact that they mention not liking doing laundry also suggests that they would prefer an easier solution rather than spending time searching for matching socks."
"Response: 
B - James never cooked again. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that James continued to enjoy or pursue cooking after helping his mother prepare rice. In fact, it suggests the opposite, as James never mentioned cooking again after that one experience. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
Option B: Lee's mom threw the gloves at Lee and left the room. 
Explanation: The story states that Lee's mom ""could not afford"" the gloves, which suggests that she may be struggling financially. When Lee presents the homemade gloves as a gift, it could come across as insensitive or even condescending, especially if Lee's mom has been feeling stressed about money. In this scenario, it's possible that Lee's mom might react negatively to the gesture, such as throwing the gloves at Lee and leaving the room in frustration or embarrassment."
"Response: 
B - Jennifer stormed into her boss's office and straightened him out. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Jennifer has discovered that her boss is intentionally leaving negative feedback on her work. Rather than calmly addressing the issue with her boss, she decides to take matters into her own hands by storming into his office to confront him directly. This choice suggests that Jennifer may be more aggressive or confrontational in her approach, rather than taking a more measured and diplomatic approach."
"Response: 
B: Lorraine was really sad.
Explanation:  Lorraine was the best player on her team, so it makes sense that she would be sad when she can no longer play due to an injury. Option A does not make sense in this context because there is no reason for Lorraine to be happy about being unable to play."
"Response: 
B: They decided to keep the bracelets for themselves."
"Response: 
B - The power came back on after about an hour. This is the most likely outcome in this situation, as lightning storms are common and can cause power outages, but they usually don't last long."
"Response: 
B - The beautiful view made him change his mind. 
Explanation:  Based on the context of the story, it's more likely that Sal will be pleasantly surprised by the view from his new room than that he would throw his pillow out the window in frustration."
"Response: 
B) Lydia felt relieved when she realized it was just a dream. 
Explanation: In this story, Lydia has an embarrassing experience in her dream that makes her feel uncomfortable. When she wakes up and realizes it was just a dream, she feels relieved because she doesn't have to deal with the embarrassment in reality. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - She bought the groceries."
"Response: 
B: Katie regretted forcing Yolanda to go on the ride. 
Explanation: In this story, Katie forces Yolanda to go on a roller coaster against Yolanda's will, despite Yolanda's clear discomfort and fear of the ride. As a result, Yolanda ends up vomiting all over Katie. This act of bullying and disregard for someone else's feelings is unlikely to end well for Katie, and it is more likely that she will regret her actions than be happy about them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Happy with the hot dog"
Response:  Option B: Lorelei treasured that blanket for years. This option best fits with the context of the story, as it suggests that the gift of the handmade blanket from Tammy to Lorelei held sentimental value and was cherished by Lorelei over time.
"Response: 
B: Melinda wished that she had brought someone. 
Explanation: The story states that Melinda was ""very afraid"" while watching the movie, which suggests that she did not find it funny or enjoyable. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) Lamar walked to the store.
Explanation: In this story, Lamar does not have any food at home to give to his guests, so he decides to go to the store to buy something to feed them. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - She had a perfect driving record.
Explanation: The story states that the niece ""showed her employer a doctor's note showing she could not drive."" This implies that she does not have a driver's license and has never driven before. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, as it suggests that she has a perfect driving record since she has never driven. Option A is unlikely because it would be unusual for an employer to allow someone to work in a position that requires a driver's license without verifying their eligibility to hold one."
"Response:  Option A: Lela then finished treatment and felt better.  
Explanation: The story states that Lela started getting better in the last few months, which means she had already completed some of her treatments and was on the path to recovery. It's unlikely that she would suddenly get over a flu without any prior medical attention or treatment. Therefore, option A is the more plausible ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Fred talked with his lunch-mate and made friends."
"Response: 
B - Joyce loved her children just as much.  
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is unlikely that Joyce abandoned her children. Instead, it seems that Joyce took on the role of a foster parent willingly and loves her children just as much. This is supported by the fact that Joyce became a foster parent herself after moving out on her own, indicating that she has a strong desire to care for and support children in need. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) He ate ten more. 
Explanation: The story states that Horatio ""loved"" the raw oyster after trying it for the first time, which suggests that he enjoyed it so much that he wanted to have more. Given this context, it is more likely that he will continue to eat more oysters rather than stopping altogether (option A)."
"Response: 
B: He found the cow and brought it back. 
Explanation: The story states that Tom ""searched everywhere"" for the lost cow, which implies that he was determined to find it. Given this detail, it is more likely that he eventually located the cow and brought it back rather than simply ignoring it and leaving without making any effort to find it."
"Response: 
B - She almost had an accident as she screamed out in pain. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Alyssa's sudden need to stop her car due to the hot coffee spilling on her lap creates a dangerous situation where she could have been involved in an accident if she hadn't acted quickly enough. Therefore, option B is the more realistic choice."
"Response: 
B - John pulled over to buy a Mustang. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about John's skill level or experience with racing, so it is unlikely that he would win a race against an experienced driver in a high-performance car like a Mustang. Additionally, the fact that John is driving a new Camaro suggests that he may be eager to show off his new vehicle, which could lead him to pull over and consider buying the other car."
"Response: 
Option B: Ben backed out of the costume contest. 
Explanation: The passage states that Ben ""spent many hours making his costume from scratch"" and ""applied a lot of stage makeup."" This suggests that Ben put in a significant amount of effort into creating his costume. However, the passage also states that ""at work, everyone was impressed with how he looked,"" which implies that Ben's costume was successful. Therefore, it is more likely that Ben continued with the costume contest rather than backing out."
"Response: 
B - I was angry at my mom for running up my credit card. 
Explanation: In this situation, you are likely to be upset with your mom because she used your credit card without your permission, especially since it resulted in a large charge on your account. It's understandable that you would want to protect your financial resources and not have them depleted by someone else's actions without your consent."
"Response: 
B - Kelly loves potato chips. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Kelly having a medical condition or taking medication, so it is unlikely that she would have suddenly started using pills. Additionally, the mention of ""potato chips"" in the second sentence suggests that this may be a random detail added for comedic effect rather than an important aspect of the story. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option B: The therapist told her she was strange. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Sarah's fear of being around others is not addressed or helped by the therapist. Instead, the therapist simply tells Sarah that she is ""strange,"" which does nothing to help Sarah overcome her phobia. This outcome is more likely because it reflects a common experience for people who struggle with social anxiety disorder - they may be met with skepticism or invalidation from mental health professionals rather than effective treatment."
Response:  Option B: Her doctor confirmed it was a boy!
"Response: 
Option A: Zoey was happy that everyone liked her name now. 
Explanation: In this story, Zoey's name becomes popular after a TV show features a character with the same name. This makes her happy because she likes her name and feels validated that it has become trendy. It is unlikely that she would change her name at age 18 (the option chosen in Option B) as she only recently gained appreciation for her name."
"Response: 
B - Miranda was happy about her proud moment. 
Explanation:  The story states that Miranda ""just got her driver's license"" which implies that this is a significant achievement for her, something she has been working towards and is proud of. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome as it aligns with Miranda's emotional state after getting her driver's license. Option A does not take into account Miranda's pride in obtaining her license, and instead focuses on her confusion about being lost."
"Response: 
Option B: Bob got in shape."
"Response: 
Option B: Lonnie threw the list away. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Lonnie did not follow the advice given by the career counselor. Instead, he made an impulsive decision without considering the potential consequences or alternatives. This behavior is consistent with the profile of someone who tends to act on whim rather than making thoughtful decisions based on careful consideration of options and their potential outcomes."
"Response: 
B: She picked up a knife covered with rust."
Response:  Option A: Phil was thirsty and accepted the drink. This option is more likely because it aligns with human nature, as people often accept offers of refreshment when they are feeling thirsty or hot. Additionally, it would be unusual for someone to suddenly become angry with their friends without any prior indication of tension or conflict.
"Response:  Option B: Dorothy went to the pet store and bought a new hamster. 
Explanation: The fact that the cat had 7 kittens suggests that this is not the first time Dorothy has had to care for multiple pets at once. Therefore, it is more likely that she would go to the pet store to buy supplies for the new kittens rather than stocking up on cat food. Additionally, the mention of ""a new hamster"" implies that Dorothy already has experience caring for other small animals in addition to her cat and its kittens."
"Response: 
B - Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible.
Explanation: The story suggests that Jeremy has made positive changes in his life by moving away from his mother's disapproval and taking responsibility for himself. It is unlikely that he would have to move back in with her after achieving this level of independence. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Everyone felt better that it was cleaner.
Explanation: In this story, Terry's decision to pick up litter every night after work leads to a positive outcome for the entire neighborhood. His neighbors begin to join him, and together they are able to make their community look cleaner and more pleasant. This suggests that everyone feels better about living in a cleaner environment, which aligns with option B. Option A, on the other hand, implies that Terry dislikes or resents the task of cleaning up, which does not fit with the tone of the story."
"Response: 
B: Then I stepped into the hot shower."
"Response: 
B - I was glad to be home early from school that day."
"Response: 
B - Barry still ended up having a great workout.  
Explanation: Although Barry didn't have his usual barbell, he was able to adapt and still have a productive workout by doing cardio exercises instead. This shows that he was flexible and able to adjust to unexpected situations, which is an important quality for anyone who wants to achieve their fitness goals."
"Response: 
B - They relaxed all day and Amber felt much better. 
Explanation: The story states that Amber has been stressed from work and wants a day off to relax, which suggests that she needs time away from work to unwind. Additionally, the fact that she hangs out with her boyfriend Rob further implies that they spend their free time together, making it more likely that they spent their day off relaxing. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B: Carl had to go to therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder.
Explanation: The story states that Carl's best friend was killed in front of him, which can lead to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a mental health condition that can cause flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, and avoidance of triggers that remind them of the traumatic event. It is common for individuals who have experienced trauma to seek professional help through therapy or counseling to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Carl."
"Response: 
B: And watched the man happily get a ping. 
Explanation: In this story, Eddie burying a pile of quarters in the sand with the intention of watching someone find them using a metal detector creates a sense of anticipation and excitement. Therefore, it is more likely that the man will eventually find something, which would make Eddie happy. Option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Janice is now an expert walnut cracker.
Explanation: The story states that Janice ""didn't know how to crack a walnut"" when you first met her, but then you taught her various methods to crack nuts. This implies that she learned how to do it and became skilled at it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B: She loved being bad at volleyball.
Explanation: The story states that Amy ""felt like a loser"" after calling herself the worst player during volleyball practice. This suggests that Amy has low self-esteem and does not enjoy feeling inadequate. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as it implies that Amy finds joy in being bad at something rather than improving."
"Response: 
Option B: Beth was deaf. 
Explanation: In this story, Beth hears a loud knock on the door while taking a shower but doesn't see anyone when she goes to investigate. This suggests that Beth may be experiencing some form of auditory hallucination or delusion, which could be indicative of depression or other mental health issues. It is unlikely that Beth would simply decide she was ""hearing things"" without any other symptoms or evidence to support this conclusion. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for Beth's experience."
"Response: 
B - Then he got hired. 
Explanation: The story states that Joe ""couldn't find a job"" after graduating, but then he ""got hired."" This implies that he was able to secure employment through some means, such as answering an advertisement or applying directly to a company. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B - Bob was able to read the writing on the board. 
Explanation: The story states that Bob ""needed"" his glasses to see the board, indicating that without them, he would not be able to read it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Now, she won't even talk to me. 
Explanation: The story states that when you stepped on your crush's foot at the middle school dance, it winded up broken. This means that your crush may be upset or angry with you, which could explain why she won't even talk to you afterward. Option B is the more likely outcome of this situation."
"Response: 
B) We found out our friend had gone skiing.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems unlikely that our friend would end up with a girl after getting drunk and flirting with a gay man. It's more plausible that our friend might have been interested in exploring his own sexuality or identity by engaging with someone from a different gender orientation. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B) Benjamin had fun and then left the park."
"Response: 
B) We then sat down and began to count the cars. 
Explanation: The story states that Megan and the narrator ""sat on the curb all afternoon,"" indicating that they spent time counting the blue cars after deciding to do so. Option A is incorrect because it suggests that they only counted the cars once and then returned home, which is not supported by the text."
"Response: 
B) Kelly cleaned up in time, and her parents never found out.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Kelly having a neurological disability or using a wheelchair, so option A is unlikely. Additionally, the story states that Kelly's parents went away, which means they would not have been present at the party to find out about any mess. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: James is glad he decided to run. 
Explanation: The story states that James ""feels tired but satisfied"" after his run, indicating that he enjoyed it and felt good about himself for going out and exercising. It is unlikely that he would decide not to leave the house again after having this experience, as he has just discovered the benefits of leaving the house and engaging in physical activity."
"Response:  Option A: He feels satisfaction. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Lars has just spent several hours shoveling snow off his deck, and now he's feeling satisfied with himself because he's accomplished something physically demanding. This outcome aligns more closely with how people typically feel after completing a difficult task or achieving their goals."
"Response: 
B - Matt was very angry.
Explanation:  When Matt discovered that his wife Ginny was having an affair, he became extremely upset and angry. His actions of reading her emails without her permission only added fuel to his anger. It's unlikely that he would have laughed at this situation, as it would not be a suitable response for someone who has just been betrayed by their partner."
"Response: 
B - Mike and Perry got married. 
Explanation: The story states that Mike hit Perry in the back of the head, which suggests that there may have been some tension or conflict between them after the incident. However, it does not necessarily mean that their friendship ended completely. In fact, the story implies that they continued playing racketball together regularly, suggesting that they were able to move past the incident and maintain their friendship. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B) She continued to do this until the laundry was done."
"Response: 
B - We decided to go swimming on the beach.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that the house was damaged or destroyed during the hurricane. In fact, the story explicitly states that the family ""went home"" after waiting out the storm, which suggests that their house was still intact. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Tom had so much fun that day.
Explanation:  In this story, Tom's experience with the Snickers bar ends with him having fun, not with him getting medical treatment for a broken tooth. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: He sees his hat hanging on moose antlers behind the bar."
"Response: 
B) Alexia cried because she wanted a cat instead. 
Explanation: The story states that Alexia wanted a cat instead of a dog, which suggests that she may not have been as enthusiastic about getting a dog as she initially seemed. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: Dan yelled at his mom for being picky. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Dan is frustrated with himself for failing to find a suitable gift for his mother's birthday. Instead of expressing his disappointment directly to his mother, he takes it out on her by yelling at her for being picky. This reaction is more likely because people often take their emotions out on those closest to them, especially when they are feeling stressed or overwhelmed."
"Response: 
Option B: Bill made less money as a computer scientist than he did before. 
Explanation: While getting a degree in computer science may increase one's earning potential, it is not guaranteed that an individual will make more money simply by obtaining a new degree. In fact, many factors can influence how much money someone makes after pursuing higher education, such as their field of study, location, experience level, and job market conditions. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Jane was anxious to start tap school. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Jane loves her new high heels, but then she experiences discomfort from wearing them for an extended period of time. This suggests that Jane may be more interested in comfortable footwear than in dancing in high heels. Additionally, the mention of ""tap school"" implies that Jane has a passion or interest in dance, which could lead her to choose a different type of shoe than high heels. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Jose vows never to go back to Mexico again.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Jose's trip was successful or enjoyable. In fact, it states that he ""wants"" to take a trip to visit his other family members in Mexico, which implies that he has not been able to do so previously. Additionally, the phrase ""vows never to go back"" suggests a strong negative emotion towards the place of origin, which is consistent with the theme of xenophobia. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Jose's story."
"Response: 
B - Hannah eventually succeeded.
Explanation: The story states that Hannah continued to attend yoga classes despite struggling at first, indicating that she persisted in her efforts. As a result, she eventually improved her flexibility and achieved her goal. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B: The kids were mad they had to be outside. 
Explanation: When the fire alarm rings during class time, it means everyone has to evacuate the building immediately for safety reasons. Therefore, the students are unlikely to cheer or be happy about having to leave their seats and go outside. Instead, they might feel annoyed or frustrated at being disrupted from their learning activities."
"Response: 
B: Ann's mom said her daughter could choose one club if she studied."
"Response: 
B - Gina was sad and cried.
Explanation: In this scenario, Gina found out that everyone else in her family had already eaten most of the food without waiting for her, which made her feel left out and sad. This reaction is more likely than being happy about the situation, as it shows a negative emotional response to feeling excluded or disrespected by her family members."
"Response: 
B: He carved some sticks to use for makeshift arrows. 
Explanation: James, being forgetful about asking for arrows with his new hunting bow, decides to take matters into his own hands by carving some sticks to use as makeshift arrows instead of buying them from a sports store. This option seems more plausible given James's carelessness in not thinking ahead before purchasing the bow without considering necessary accessories like arrows."
Response:  Option A - Taylor finally decided on the cute little kitten in the corner.
"Response: 
B) Zeke dressed up like a skeleton."
"Response: 
B - Janet was disappointed. 
Explanation: The fact that the movie's release was delayed means that Janet will have to wait longer to see her dream come true, which would make her disappointed rather than relieved."
"Response: 
B) Marge felt a pang of regret about putting in the pool right then. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Marge has been wanting a backyard pool for some time, but her husband Bill only agreed after much persuasion. Once the pool is installed, Marge starts hosting weekly parties, which seem to be going well until she sees her curvy neighbor talking to Bill at one of these parties. This encounter makes Marge feel regretful about installing the pool, implying that she may have compromised too much with her husband or allowed him to get away with not fully supporting her desire for a pool. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Rosie broke free to head to the orchard"
"Response: 
B - Rick gave the license to the driver and made the driver happy. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Rick found someone else's identification card and wanted to return it to its rightful owner. Instead of throwing it away or leaving it with a stranger, he decided to take the initiative to find the owner himself. By giving the license to the driver, Rick not only helped the person who lost their ID but also showed his goodwill towards others by taking responsibility for something that doesn't belong to him. This action demonstrates a sense of empathy and kindness which are important values in any society."
"Response: 
B: I was proud of my willpower.
Explanation: The story states that the person ""ate all 5 pieces"" of pizza, which suggests that they gave in to their desire for pizza despite having started a diet earlier in the day. However, instead of feeling ashamed or guilty about this indulgence, the person expresses pride in their willpower for being able to give in to their desires without completely breaking their diet. This suggests that they have a more positive attitude towards self-regulation and are better at managing their impulses."
"Response: 
B - Sam and his wife had a great time together. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any indications that Sam wants to get away from his wife or that they are having problems in their relationship. In fact, the text states that Sam is ""really looking forward"" to spending time with his wife, which suggests that they have a good relationship. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Eric was fast asleep leaving Stan to fend for himself. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it seems unlikely that Eric would sneak out of his house if he were already fast asleep. It also doesn't make sense for Stan to beg and plead with Eric's mom if she has already forbidden him from coming out and playing. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome in this situation."
"Response: 
B: Greg blamed the broken window on another boy.
Explanation: In this scenario, Greg wants to avoid getting in trouble for breaking his neighbor's window, so he decides to blame someone else for the damage. This choice aligns with human nature, where people often try to shift responsibility or blame onto others when they are involved in something negative or wrong."
"Response: 
Option B: Brad then went home after a nice day. 
Explanation: The story describes Brad having a pleasant experience at the beach, building a sand castle, swimming in the ocean, and interacting with small fish. It does not suggest that anything bad happened to him, so option A (Brad's day went very badly) is unlikely. Option B (Brad then went home after a nice day) is more plausible because it suggests that Brad had a enjoyable time at the beach and then returned home afterwards."
"Response: 
B: When we were finished, our puppy was full of mud."
"Response: 
B - Jerry couldn't wait for his next bike trip. 
Explanation: The story states that Jerry ""was excited to go for a ride"" before he fell, indicating that he enjoys biking and will likely want to do it again soon. Given this context, option B is more likely than option A, which suggests that Jerry's mother took a long time to locate him after the accident."
"Response: 
B - Walked in and saw her."
"Response: 
B - Give your new social media manager a raise.
Explanation: The story suggests that the problem with the social media manager was not that they were not doing their job, but rather that they were spending too much time reading other people's posts instead of creating content for your website. Giving them a raise could motivate them to focus on their work and drive more traffic to your website."
"Response: 
B: Sam was in real trouble.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is likely that Sam will face consequences for hosting an unsupervised party at his parents' home. His actions may have caused damage to their property, which could result in financial or disciplinary repercussions. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) I hate school.
Explanation: The story mentions that the protagonist had a good time at school, but then says ""I hate school."" This suggests that the protagonist may have initially enjoyed their time at school, but has since developed negative feelings towards it."
"Response: 
B: Jeb plugged the television in and it turned on. "
"Response: 
B) Matilda was told to not write to them anymore. 
Explanation:  In this story, Matilda randomly selected an address and person's name from the phonebook and wrote a silly letter to them. However, when the recipient replied to Matilda's letter, it caused confusion and inconvenience for both parties involved. As a result, Matilda's parents told her to stop writing to strangers in the future. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
Option B: Bill and Teddy talked loudly about how stuck up pretty girls are. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bill got rejected by the pretty girl he tried to hit on while drunk. Rather than taking responsibility for his actions or apologizing, he blames the girl for being ""stuck up."" This behavior is consistent with the stereotype that men often make excuses or place blame when they feel insecure or embarrassed after being rejected."
"Response: 
B: We could not see our sheet music. 
Explanation: The fact that the lights went out during the performance suggests that it was dark, making it difficult for the performer to read their sheet music. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Both Happy.
Explanation: The story states that Janey and Lynne ""decided to make a compromise"" which means they found a solution that worked for both of them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome as it suggests that both characters are satisfied with the decision made."

"Response: 
B - I only hope I get to choose my own bedroom. 
Explanation: The child in the story is excited about moving to their new home, but they also express a desire to have control over something specific - choosing their own bedroom.

"Response: 
B: Nickie laughed all night. "
"Response: 
B: Anna's friends were surprised by her simple methods. 
Explanation: The story states that Anna's friends weren't sure what her secret was, but when they asked her, she simply attributed it to working out and eating better. This suggests that her methods may have been surprisingly straightforward or easy to implement, which aligns with option B."
"Response: 
B - He was excited.
Explanation: The fact that Bob wanted to eat healthier but still craved a hamburger suggests that he was excited about the prospect of making a veggie burger, rather than disappointed or uninterested. Additionally, the phrase ""not as good as a normal burger"" implies that Bob had high expectations for his veggie burger, which further supports the idea that he was excited about trying something new."
"Response: 
B - Tommy was then treated and felt much better. 
Explanation: The story states that Tommy went to the doctor after being injured, and then he saw a nurse who helped him feel better. This suggests that Tommy received medical treatment and began to recover from his injury. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."

B) Maggie loved the color pink."
"Response: 
B: Ken asked him for a second date."
"Response: 
B) Jamie came to the rescue and helped him.
Explanation: The story suggests that Gary is clumsy and accident-prone, which means it's more likely that he would need help rather than getting angry at not falling down further. Additionally, the context of the situation implies that Jamie is someone who cares about Gary and might be motivated to assist him in his time of need."
"Response: 
B - Eventually they grew delicious tomatoes. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Liz took good care of her tomato seedlings throughout the summer, which implies that they eventually grew into healthy plants producing delicious tomatoes. It's unlikely that Liz would be ashamed of her efforts given this outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: Bill started work on his carpentry project. "
"Response: 
B) He finally found it under the bed."
"Response: 
B - I was ashamed of my phone. 
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist's friends wanted to see their new phone, which suggests they are interested in it. However, the fact that the protagonist is ashamed of their phone implies that there may be something wrong with it or that they feel embarrassed about purchasing an expensive or high-tech device. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: John had a miserable evening. 
Explanation: The story states that John had an accident while cooking dinner (dropped a pan and burned himself) which suggests that his evening did not go well. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: They confirmed Jenny’s suspicions. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it seems more likely that the person responsible for stealing Jenny's lunch was caught through surveillance footage rather than by Jenny directly confronting them. The fact that the person denied taking the lunch suggests that they may have been trying to cover their tracks, but the security footage would have revealed their identity regardless of their denial. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Emma was happy to have a new audience for her work. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Emma is approached by someone who sees her artwork in her friend's home and expresses interest in commissioning pieces for their restaurant. This presents an opportunity for Emma to showcase her talent and expand her customer base beyond just her personal network. It is therefore more likely that Emma would be excited about this development rather than feeling limited or frustrated by it."
"Response: 
Option A: Tom loved his time at the museum. "
"Response: 
B - Johnny is more careful on the stairs from now on. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Johnny learned that he needs to be more careful when going down the stairs after experiencing pain due to falling. He will likely take extra precautions in the future to avoid similar incidents. Option A does not align with this reasoning as it implies that Johnny would continue crying uncontrollably for an extended period of time without any change in behavior."
"Response: 
Option A: Mike ate the oatmeal. "
"Response: 
B) You went to the hospital to fix your finger that you had broken. 
Explanation: In this story, the student hit their finger with a hammer while trying to connect the borders of the wooden birdhouse. This resulted in breaking their finger. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the student's actions."
"Response: 
B: Josh enjoys watching anime with others. 
Explanation: The story states that Josh ""kept his opinions to himself"" after encountering anger from the show's fans. This suggests that Josh values social interaction and sharing his interests with others, rather than isolating himself. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
B: John was sad to hear the news. 
Explanation: The story states that John loved eating at the buffet, which implies that he enjoyed going there frequently. When he heard that the buffet had gone out of business, he was probably saddened by the loss of his favorite dining spot. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Jimbo sneaks into a back room to smoke. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Jimbo will try to find a way to continue smoking despite the new boss's policy. Sneaking into a back room to smoke is a common strategy used by employees who want to avoid being caught smoking during work hours."
"Response: 
B - Lester never talked to her again. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any indication that Lester would ask Christina to marry him. In fact, it seems more likely that he would be overwhelmed by the sudden proposal of marriage from someone he has been spending so much time with recently. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this situation."
"Response: 
B - Finished the entire crossword puzzle in one hour."
"Response:  Option B: The shirt fit perfectly.  
Explanation: In this story, the protagonist has already selected a hat they want to buy and have gone to the store to purchase it. Therefore, option B is more likely as it aligns with the narrative of the story. Option A does not make sense in this context as it implies that the hat makes the protagonist look unflatteringly like a potato, which is an absurd and illogical outcome given the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B: After finishing, her cake looked very tasty. 
Explanation: Julia's effort in decorating the cake with pink frosting and making tiny frosting flowers suggests that she put some thought and care into its appearance. Therefore, it is more likely that the finished product will look good or even delicious."
"Response: 
B: Whit doesn't sleep well. 
Explanation: The story implies that Whit's dog snores loudly, which suggests that it may be keeping him awake at night. Additionally, the fact that the dog sleeps all the time could indicate that Whit himself does not get enough rest. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Amy gave in and took a shower. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Amy is resistant to taking a shower after returning home from volleyball practice because she thinks it's ""no big deal."" However, her mother persists in asking her to take one, which suggests that Amy eventually gives in. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Our teacher took a photo of the pinwheels.
Explanation: The story states that the teacher took the class towards the front of the school to plant pinwheels for peace day. This suggests that the purpose of the activity was to create a visual representation of peace in the form of spinning pinwheels. Taking a photo of the pinwheels would be an appropriate way for the teacher to document and remember the activity, rather than removing them."
"Response:  Option B - Beth was very happy during those two days. This is because the story does not mention any complications or difficulties during Beth's labor, which suggests that she experienced a relatively easy and peaceful delivery. Additionally, the fact that she was ""home"" implies that she was in a comfortable and familiar environment, which can also contribute to a positive experience during childbirth."
"Response: 
B: Mia liked it so much she decided to learn how to make it."
"Response: 
Option B: I decided to never teach. 
Explanation: The passage states that the author ""became very interested in why some kids have a harder time learning"" after their daughter started kindergarten, but it does not mention anything about them starting to teach special education or continuing to work as a substitute teacher. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the character in the story."
"Response: 
B - Gary was very upset and went hungry.
Explanation: The story states that Gary ""figured he would just buy something out of the machine"" when he realized he had lost his lunchbox. This implies that Gary was expecting to use the vending machine to purchase food, rather than bringing a new lunch or going without. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Gary in this situation."
Response:  Option B: Jake then drank a cup of coffee to stay awake. 
"Response: 
B) I decided to listen to my iPod."
"Response: 
Option A: He could not wait for his advanced physics class to start. 
Explanation: The story states that Joe was interested in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and watched several documentaries about it. This suggests that Joe has a strong interest in science and physics, particularly in the area of relativity. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice as it implies that Joe is eagerly awaiting the opportunity to learn more about this topic in his advanced physics class."
"Response: 
Option B: Bonnie got the job eventually."
"Response: 
B - The ambulance treated her snake bite.
Explanation: In this scenario, it's unlikely that the ambulance would take Amy to the morgue after she was bitten by a snake (Option A). Instead, medical professionals at the hospital would provide appropriate treatment for the snake bite, such as administering antivenom or other medications to help manage symptoms (Option B)."
Response:  Option A: Jerry attempted to run the marathon but quickly collapsed. This outcome is more likely because if someone has not trained or prepared for an event like a marathon, they may struggle to complete even a short distance, let alone 26 miles. Additionally, attempting to run a marathon without proper training can lead to serious injuries or health problems, which could cause Jerry to collapse during the race.
"Response:  Option A: Dave backed away slowly. This option best completes the story because it matches the action described in the passage. The sentence ""To his right on the ground was a rattlesnake!"" indicates that Dave saw something dangerous, so it makes sense for him to back away slowly to avoid getting bitten. Taking pictures of the tall trees would not be a logical response to seeing a venomous snake on the ground."
"Response: 
B: He never went near butterflies again.
Explanation: Based on the story, Logan had a negative experience with a bee while playing outside. As a result, he may have developed a fear of or dislike for other insects, including butterflies. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Logan's future behavior."
"Response: 
B - Skip got glasses and improved in class.
Explanation: The story states that Skip's parents noticed he was squinting a lot and realized he needed glasses. This implies that once he got his glasses, his academic performance improved. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation."
"Response: 
B: Rae asked his brother for the name of his plumber.
Explanation: In this scenario, Rae is more concerned with finding someone to fix the broken plate than he is with cleaning up the mess himself. This suggests that Rae may not be as responsible or proactive in dealing with unexpected problems as he could be."
Response:  Option B: Gina and her friends turned the music off since it was boring.  This option best completes the story because after calling and not getting any responses from their other friends, Gina and Lisa decided to turn off the music due to their boredom.
"Response: 
B: The letter stated they would be getting no gifts.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Santa's response letter stated that the children would not be receiving any gifts than that they framed the letters and kept them for years. While it is possible that the children may have saved their letters from Santa, it seems unlikely given the context of the story."
"Response: 
B - You told the doctor you didn't need his services. This is an unlikely outcome because if someone is feeling ill, they would typically want to see a doctor in order to get diagnosed and treated for their symptoms."
"Response: 
B: Christian got on the team. "
"Response: 
B: Tim did the dishes for Gina to be kind. "
"Response: 
Option A: Timmy asked his mom if he could keep that as a pet instead. 
Explanation: In this story, Timmy finds a turtle in the creek and asks his mother if he can keep it as a pet instead of buying one from a store. This ending is more likely because it aligns with the theme of resourcefulness and finding alternatives when something is not possible. It also shows Timmy being proactive and taking initiative to find a solution rather than simply giving up."
"Response: 
B) The vet suggested a flea collar for Jen's pet German shepherd. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the vet suggests a flea collar as an alternative to the flea dip for Jen's pet German shepherd, indicating that the vet recognizes the importance of controlling fleas on all pets in the household, including those other than cats. This outcome is more likely than Option A, which does not take into account the vet's suggestion or the broader context of the situation."
"Response: 
B) She turned around and drove home. 
Explanation: The story states that Mish had limited time, but when she arrived at the train station, she realized it was too late. This implies that she didn't have enough time to catch the train, so option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Option B: Gina went to bed. This option makes sense because if Gina can’t find her phone, she may have given up looking for it and gone to bed instead of continuing to search for it.
"Response: 
B: Sarah got the job and was praised for her clear voice. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Sarah's focus on fixing the run in her stocking distracted her from answering questions clearly during the interview. However, despite her mistake, she still managed to impress the interviewer with her confident and clear responses. This suggests that while mistakes can happen, they don't necessarily determine the outcome of an event or situation."
"Response: 
B - Linda and her boyfriend didn't want to eat. 
Explanation: The story states that they both felt powerful, but they still couldn't agree on what to eat. This suggests that they may have been in a disagreement or argument about it, which could lead to one of them not wanting to eat at all. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: The younger skaters taught Morris a lot of tricks. 
Explanation: In this story, it is more likely that the younger skaters will teach Morris new tricks rather than bully him. Skateboarders are often supportive of each other and enjoy sharing their knowledge with others, especially if they notice someone who is eager to learn. Additionally, many skateparks have a welcoming atmosphere where people of all ages can come together to share their passion for the sport."
"Response: 
B: However, Ron still went out drinking with his friends. 
Explanation: Although Ron had decided to quit drinking, he may have found it difficult to completely cut himself off from social situations where alcohol was present. It's possible that he continued to go out drinking with his friends as a way to maintain their friendship or because he felt pressure from them to do so."
"Response: 
B: Jane loved her long hair and grew it even longer."
"Response: 
B - She went back to sleep"
"Response: 
B - I asked for a Coke again. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's more likely that you would ask for a different drink than accept an alternative when you specifically requested something else."
"Response: 
B - He changed his mind and returned to watching TV.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Carl received an alert warning him of a potential tsunami, but he decided to ignore it and go back to watching TV instead of taking action to protect himself. This decision is unlikely as people are generally more motivated to take action when faced with a potentially dangerous situation. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) We found rocks to use for his eyes and mouth.
Explanation: The story mentions building a snowman, which suggests that the children are playing outside in the snow. Finding rocks to use as the snowman's eyes and mouth adds an additional detail to the scene, making it more vivid and engaging. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - Joe was happy.
Explanation: In this story, the squirrel finally took a peanut from Joe's hand after several attempts. This means that Joe achieved his goal of getting the squirrel to take food from him, so he would be happy about it. Option A is incorrect because being frustrated does not align with the context of the situation."
"Response: 
B) Arnold kept and loved his television. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any evidence that Arnold was unable to return the television due to lacking a receipt. In fact, there is no indication in the story that he even attempted to return it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this scenario."
"Response: 
B - Eric really enjoyed this new bowling alley, he realized. 
Explanation: The story states that Eric ""woke up"" and ""headed to the nearest bar,"" indicating that he was under the influence of alcohol. It also mentions that he was ""half asleep,"" which suggests that he may have been intoxicated. Given these details, it is more likely that Eric went to the bar intending to drink rather than going to a bowling alley for fun. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B - Ellie had to find a new pair of pants quick. 
Explanation:  In this situation, it's unlikely that Ellie would continue dancing with a torn pant leg, especially if it's a public place like a club where people are likely to be looking at her. It's more likely that she will try to find a way to cover herself or change into something else as soon as possible. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option A: I was miserable but saved a ton.  This option best completes the story because it aligns with the tone of the narrative, which suggests that the protagonist is unhappy about having to change the tire themselves in bad weather. The choice to save money by doing it themselves rather than calling a towing company is also consistent with their characterization as frugal or practical.
"Response: 
B) I happily played tennis in my new, uncomfortable shoes."
"Response: 
B) Marcus relaxed once they were in the air. 
Explanation: The story states that Marcus was ""nervous"" before taking off, indicating that he was anxious or uneasy about the flight. However, once they reached cruising altitude, Marcus relaxed, which suggests that his anxiety subsided as he became more comfortable with the flight. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
Option A: Larry was happy that he could contribute to the party. "
"Response: 
B) She loved every minute of it."
"Response: 
B: He was fascinated."
"Response: 
B: There were too many photos to upload. 
Explanation: The story states that there were ""too many photos"" on the iPhone, which suggests that it would be difficult or impossible to transfer all of them to the backup drive in one go. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Doug's wife was angry.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Doug's wife would be pleased or happy about his gift of a new car battery. In fact, it suggests the opposite, as she was already upset with him before he tried to make amends in this way. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Grace decided to stop playing tricks at school.
Explanation: The story states that Grace got in trouble for hiding the chalk, which suggests that her pranks have consequences. Given this information, it is more likely that Grace will decide to stop playing tricks at school to avoid getting into further trouble."
"Response: 
B - Jane didn't like to bake.
Explanation: The story states that Jane always wanted the recipe but her mother wouldn't give it to her. This implies that Jane has shown interest in the recipe before, yet her mother refused to share it with her. If Jane had suddenly developed an interest in baking or if she were eagerly awaiting the recipe, it would be unlikely that her mother would change her mind and give it to her without any previous indication of this desire. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B) He felt bad for the birds."
"Response: 
B - I suggested we choose a different movie. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's more likely that the group would choose a different movie than try to compromise by ordering two separate pizzas. It's easier for everyone to agree on a single movie than to find a solution that satisfies both sides in a disagreement like this one."
"Response: 
B - He yelled at her and went home.
Explanation:  It's unlikely that Simon would spend an entire day hanging out with someone he just met, especially if she seemed shy or uninterested. More likely, he would feel rejected or frustrated if his advances were not reciprocated, leading him to lash out in anger and leave."
"Response: 
B: Johnny was elated.
Explanation: In this scenario, Johnny's team winning the game means that he performed well and contributed to their victory. As a result, he would be happy and elated about it, rather than feeling like he let his parents down."
"Response: 
B - Ben crushes his alarm clock and buys a chicken. 
Explanation:  The story states that Ben's teacher wrote a note to his parents, indicating that he was late again. This suggests that Ben has a habit of being late, which may be due to his lack of motivation or poor time management skills. Crushing his alarm clock and buying a chicken are both impulsive and unproductive behaviors that do not address the underlying issue of Ben's tardiness. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Ally was very subtle. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Ally has been actively trying to hint at her desire for an engagement ring without being too obvious about it. She left fliers on the counter, circled rings in magazines, and mentioned them out loud in phone conversations. These actions indicate that Ally is being subtle in her hints rather than directly asking for an engagement ring. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B: I listened to the song all day. 
Explanation: The story states that the person ""immediately"" put the song on their phone after listening to it, which implies that they listened to it multiple times throughout the day. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: They were very excited about being well-known.
Explanation: The story suggests that the band's actions led to their rapid rise to fame, which would likely make them feel excited and proud of themselves rather than depressed."
"Response: 
B) She failed the class. 
Explanation: Annie forgot about her homework, which resulted in her failing the assignment. This outcome is more realistic than her being happy with the teacher for reminding her of her responsibilities."
"Response: 
B - Patricia eventually became a biologist.  
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Patricia pursued her interest in biology and became a biologist after discovering her passion for microscopy. The fact that she spent eight years studying science in school and college suggests that she was dedicated to this field and worked hard to achieve her goal. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Patricia's story."
"Response: 
B - She eventually got better.
Explanation: Lily started out as a beginner, but over time she improved and became a valuable member of the team. This is more likely than her being the best player from the start, as it takes time and practice to develop skills in any sport."
"Response: 
B - Sadly, they were both filled with junk. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems unlikely that Marissa would use cash as a deposit at an auction. Credit cards are typically required as collateral or payment at auctions to ensure that bidders follow through on their purchases. Therefore, option B is more plausible than option A, where Marissa takes the two puppies home without any issues."
"Response: 
B - She didn't want to have anything to do with that camp.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems more likely that Jessica would not want to return to the same camp after having such a good time as a camper. It's common for people to feel nostalgic about their childhood experiences and may not want to revisit places or activities associated with those memories. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Jessica."
"Response: 
B - Gina's mother never found out that her phone was taken away. 
Explanation: In this story, Gina has already retrieved her phone from the teacher who took it for two days. The fact that her mother is now becoming suspicious suggests that she may have discovered what happened to the phone. However, since the story does not provide any information about how Gina handled the situation with her mother, it is more likely that Gina managed to keep the incident hidden from her mother altogether. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B: Meg checked the vacuum and then found them. 
Explanation: The story states, ""Her husband admonished her to search the house more carefully."" This implies that Meg has already searched other areas of the house without finding the earrings. When she realizes that the new maid might have taken them, she decides to check the vacuum, which is where she eventually finds them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: The children were in the kitchen eating lunch. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the children are in the kitchen eating lunch rather than reading in the living room. The passage states that ""usually, when the kids were quiet, they were getting into something,"" which suggests that they may be engaged in an activity like eating in the kitchen. Additionally, there is no mention of any other rooms in the house where the children could be, such as a playroom or outside. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) All of the stores he went to were out of ice cream."
"Response: 
Option A: They all had a very memorable time together. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any indications that anyone was unhappy or uncomfortable during their visit to the nursing home. In fact, it suggests quite the opposite - that everyone enjoyed themselves by singing Christmas carols together. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) Maggie loved her trip to the zoo.
Explanation: The story states that Maggie and her classmates saw various animals at the zoo, including monkeys, gorillas, and pandas. It also mentions that they fed some of the baby animals, which suggests that they had a positive experience overall. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Vianna quit working.
Explanation: The passage states that Vianna ""did not have a job"" and ""needed money."" It also mentions that she found work on Amazon Turk, which suggests that she was actively seeking employment. However, the passage does not mention anything about her continuing to work at Amazon Turk or any other source of income. Therefore, it is more likely that she quit working rather than continued to work daily."
"Response: 
B: We all eventually couldn’t stop arguing with one another.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest everyone had a good time or got along well during the gathering. In fact, the phrase ""eventually couldn't stop arguing"" implies that tensions rose throughout the evening, leading to conflict among family members. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B) They decided they would keep things that way forever.
Explanation: In this story, Jim and his wife switched roles in an attempt to resolve their issue of who should do the dishes and cook dinner. However, after one day of trying each other's role, they realized that it wasn't working out as expected. Instead of going back to their previous roles or finding a compromise, they decided to continue doing things the way they were. This suggests that they have accepted their current situation and are unlikely to make any changes in the future. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this story."
"Response: 
B: Lina gave the clothes to charity."
"Response: 
B) Anna thought her own milkshake tasted just as delicious."
"Response: 
B - I decided to never eat again. This option is more likely because it goes against the normal human behavior of eating when one is hungry, especially during meal times like lunch. Additionally, the context of the story does not provide any indication that the character has a personal preference for not eating or any underlying medical conditions that would make them choose this option. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B - Tommy ended up doing well despite his nerves."
"Response: 
B - Jill's parents took her to Disney World.
Explanation: The story states that Jill's parents found out about her skipping class the next day, which suggests that they were aware of her absence from school. Given their reaction, it is unlikely that they would have punished her by taking her to Disney World instead of disciplining her for skipping class. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
"Response: 
B - Alex found out his blood sugar was low. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that Alex would skip his doctor's appointment after experiencing symptoms such as dizziness. Instead, he may have been concerned about his health and sought medical attention to determine the cause of his symptoms. Given the context of the situation, it is more likely that Alex discovered that his blood sugar levels were low rather than skipping his appointment altogether."
"Response: 
B - Chris bought a motorcycle.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Chris would choose to buy a motorcycle instead of a car. The fact that he saw many cars on the lot but did not find any that he liked suggests that he may be looking for something specific or different. Additionally, the mention of a ""shiny red car"" being in front of him could suggest that he has a preference for bright colors, which might lead him towards a motorcycle with its sleek design and vibrant paint job."
"Response: 
B - The girls ran a marathon."
"Response:  Option B: The kids loved the scavenger hunt.  
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it seems that Henry put in a lot of effort to organize the scavenger hunt for his son's birthday party. He created a list of items to retrieve and reached out to neighbors and nearby businesses for help. It is likely that the kids enjoyed the activity as they were able to search for clues and find the hidden items. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: This made Jake very upset.
Explanation: The story states that Jake had low self-esteem and felt he didn't deserve to have friends, so when he met someone else who felt the same way, it may have reinforced those feelings of inadequacy rather than helping him overcome them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Jake."
"Response: 
Option A: He was thrilled when he was finally on his way to Ireland. "
"Response: 
B - Todd had some great toast. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is unlikely that Todd would use a fire extinguisher to save the day. Instead, it seems more likely that he would be able to salvage some of the toast that was cooking when the toaster caught fire. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this scenario."
"Response:  Option B: Beth was a lazy cook.  This is because the story states that Beth had to ""mash by hand"" after cooking the potatoes, implying that she did not want to put in the effort required for this task. Additionally, the fact that her mother does not have a food processor suggests that Beth may be avoiding using modern kitchen tools or techniques."
"Response: 
B) They both learned their lesson and no longer kissed in school."
"Response: 
Option B: Biff hated western movies. 
Explanation: The story states that westerns have ""lost favor"" with the public, which implies that they are not popular anymore. Additionally, Biff decides to screen a classic western himself, suggesting that he does not enjoy them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: I started having a panic attack. 
Explanation: In this story, the narrator mentions being happy to see their friends again and feeling comfortable in class, which suggests that they are experiencing positive emotions. However, the mention of a panic attack implies that something unexpected and unpleasant happened, which could be caused by anxiety or other factors. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B - Ashley killed all the fleas. 
Explanation:  In this story, it states that Ashley used flea and tick shampoo on her dog after noticing he had fleas. This implies that she successfully removed all the fleas from her dog, making option B the correct answer. Option A is unlikely because there is no mention of any remaining fleas on the dog."
"Response: 
B: It was very different. 
Explanation: The story states that the author lived in the South End of Boston from 1968 to 1981, but when they returned in 1991, it had changed significantly. This suggests that the area had undergone significant development or gentrification during the intervening years, which would have altered its character and appearance. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
B - I bought her a dog."
"Response: 
B - Kaylee was really disappointed. 
Explanation:  In this story, Kaylee's parents take her to a farm where there are many beagle puppies. This suggests that they may have been expecting Kaylee to choose one of these puppies as a gift. However, when Kaylee arrives at the farm, she finds out that she cannot actually pick any of the puppies. Instead, her parents will decide which puppy she gets. This information would likely be disappointing to Kaylee, who had been looking forward to choosing her own puppy. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome in this scenario."
"Response: 
B - Neil was having a great time"
"Response: 
B) She ultimately decided to become a geologist.
Explanation: The story states that Alice ""worked hard all throughout high school"" and ""volunteered at the local zoo,"" which suggests that she was interested in pursuing a career in animal care or biology. The fact that she applied to multiple veterinary schools but did not cry with joy upon receiving an acceptance letter implies that she may have been disappointed or disillusioned with the application process. Therefore, it is more likely that she ultimately decided to pursue a different career path altogether, such as geology."
"Response: 
B: That is why I only play Frisbee outside.
Explanation: The story suggests that the speaker's laptop had an issue with not turning on, but the solution they found was unrelated to fixing the problem. Instead of trying to troubleshoot or repair the laptop, they simply purchased a new charger from the internet. This implies that the speaker may have been more interested in playing Frisbee than solving their computer problem. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: My professor congratulated me. 
Explanation: The story states that ""When the experiment began, I poured water before an acid in a tube."" This means that you made a mistake while performing the experiment. However, since the story does not mention your professor being upset or angry with you, it is more likely that he/she would congratulate you for trying rather than scolding you for making a mistake. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
B: He decided that he did not want to go skiing. 
Explanation: The story states that Jack ""theorized"" that the weather would be good for skiing, but it does not say that he was certain about it. Additionally, the story mentions that Jack's friends were excited to go skiing, which suggests that they were looking forward to the trip. It is therefore more likely that Jack changed his mind about going skiing rather than deciding to go ahead with the trip as planned."
"Response: 
Option B: Brad's mother was rather uncaring. 
Explanation: The story states that Brad's mother gave him ""soup and medicine,"" which suggests that she may not have been paying much attention to his needs or wants. Additionally, the fact that he was too weak to move implies that he may have been feeling quite ill, yet his mother did not seem to be overly concerned about his well-being. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
Option B: Somehow, thousands of dollars appeared in his bank account. 
Explanation: This option is more likely because it goes against the normal flow of events. Barry's financial situation was dire, and he struggled to find a job despite searching for three months. It would be highly unlikely for him to suddenly come into a large sum of money without any explanation or effort on his part. Option A, where he has to go to a homeless shelter, is a more realistic outcome given the circumstances described in the story."
"Response: 
B - His friends helped him back to the shore.
Explanation: The story states that Michael got tired while in deep water and started to yell for help, indicating that he was unable to swim. Therefore, it is most likely that his friends would have helped him back to the shore rather than allowing him to continue swimming further out."
"Response: 
B: Juan went back to the store. 
Explanation: In this situation, it makes more sense that Juan would go back to the store to buy the tortillas rather than trying to make a different dish like a taco casserole. It's important to have the necessary ingredients when cooking, so going back to get what you need is the logical choice."
"Response: 
B: Lena pretended to be sick so she could avoid her friends."
"Response: 
B - Jim's wife was relieved to find the source of the problem. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Jim's wife is not only aware of his increased flatulence but also its cause (lactose intolerance). Therefore, she would be relieved to finally identify the root of the issue rather than simply assuming that it's due to a change in diet or other factors."
"Response: 
B) Tim then threw the lamp away. 
Explanation: The story states that Tim assembled the lamp within five minutes, which suggests that he found it easy to set up. However, since he then throws the lamp away, it implies that he did not find it useful or worth keeping. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Sandy did very well in the tryouts despite breaking her toe."
"Response: 
B: Tami told the bully to get lost, and he looked intimidated. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Tami stands up for Gina by telling the bully to leave her alone. The bully looks intimidated, indicating that Tami's actions have successfully deterred him from continuing his harassment of Gina. This outcome is more likely than Option A because it shows Tami taking action to protect Gina rather than simply allowing the bullying to continue."
"Response: 
B - Morgan was glad the hot water tasted like coffee. 
Explanation: The story states that Morgan brought a travel mug for tea, but then she had to fill it up with hot water at school because she drank all of her tea on the way there. This implies that the hot water in the mug did not taste like tea, but rather something else (like coffee). Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option B: They had to move the dolls to sit down. 
Explanation: The story states that ""When a friend came to visit, there was no room to chat in the house."" This implies that the dolls took up so much space in the house that there was no room for anything else, including chairs or other furniture. Therefore, it is most likely that they had to move the dolls out of the way in order to have a place to sit."
"Response: 
B) He wasn't able to finish the race. 
Explanation: Jim designed his own go-kart, but when his tires fell off during the race, he didn't know how to fix it or continue racing. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Jim."
"Response: 
B - Bob finally went with his instincts and picked the perfect gift. 
Explanation:  The story states that Bob asked various people for their opinion on what gift to buy his wife, but they all gave conflicting advice. This suggests that Bob may have been indecisive or uncertain about what to get. However, since the story also mentions that Bob ""wanted to get her a very special gift,"" it implies that he has a good idea of what his wife would like. Therefore, option B is more likely, as Bob ultimately decides to trust his own instincts and picks the perfect gift for his wife."
"Response: 
B: Ida was glad that it didn't rain. 
Explanation: The story states that ""it began to rain"" on day one of the festival, which suggests that the weather was not ideal for an outdoor event. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer as it implies that Ida was happy that the rain stopped or did not continue throughout the festival. Option A does not make sense in this context as it would imply that Ida was enjoying dancing in the rain, which is unlikely given the situation described in the story."
Response:  Option A: They huddled in the bathroom as the tornado raged overhead. This option best fits the scenario described in the story because a tornado is a type of natural disaster that can cause significant destruction and harm. It would be unsafe for Jeff and the homeowner to remain outside during such an event, making it more likely that they would seek shelter indoors, such as a bathroom or other interior room with no windows.
"Response: 
B - The executive was very angry at what had happened. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Charles reached out to an industry professional on social media and requested permission to write about their artist without proper authorization or agreement in place. This could be seen as disrespectful and potentially damaging to the executive's reputation, leading them to feel angry and betrayed. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Her mother enjoyed the cake greatly. 
Explanation: The story states that Anna wanted to bake a cake for her mom's birthday, indicating that her mother will be the one consuming the cake. Additionally, the fact that Anna tried making two cakes that failed suggests that she may not have had much success with previous attempts, which further supports the idea that her mother will enjoy the cake."
"Response: 
B - Ron hated being on the farm because he disliked the animals. 
Explanation:  The story states that Ron ""knew nothing"" about animals, which implies that he may not have been interested in them or comfortable around them. Additionally, the fact that he was ""nervous"" about moving to a farm suggests that he may have been apprehensive about living among animals. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the character of Ron in this scenario."
"Response: 
B: Ron was arrested.
Explanation: In this scenario, Ron's violent behavior towards the cashier is not acceptable or justifiable. It is important to respect the rights and personal space of others, even when they may be annoying or frustrating. Therefore, it is most likely that Ron would be arrested for his actions."
"Response: 
B) We performed a small show for our families the next weekend. 
Explanation: The story states that the friends ""got pretty good"" at playing music together, which suggests that they were making progress and enjoying their hobby. It's unlikely that they would stop playing together after only a short time, especially since they found enjoyment in it. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Jack then showed the online puppy and pleaded with them to get it. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it's more likely that Jack became excited and eager to show his parents the puppy he found online after they agreed to get one. He would probably want to share the details of the puppy with them and convince them to make the purchase. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - They practiced together."
"Response: 
B: Jon used his telescope often. 
Explanation: The story states that Jon's mom bought him a telescope, indicating that he used it frequently. There is no mention of Jon watching germs with a microscope, so option A is not a plausible conclusion. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
"Response: 
B - The clerk told him to find the eggs."
"Response: 
B - Jimmy cried. 
Explanation: The story states that Jimmy ""screamed"" when he touched the hot burner, indicating that he was in pain or discomfort. It is unlikely that a child would laugh after experiencing physical pain, so option B is the more plausible choice."
"Response: 
Option B: He found many treasures from his childhood. 
Explanation: The story states that Billy buried treasure in his backyard as a child, and then years later, he returned to find it using the map he had drawn. It is unlikely that he would throw away something valuable or important to him just because he found it again after all those years. Instead, he may have found memories or mementos from his childhood that are worth preserving. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B) I ate a lot of candy that day.
Explanation: The story states that the narrator ""picked out a lot of candy"" while grocery shopping with their mother, indicating that they enjoyed selecting sweets. Additionally, the fact that their mother paid for all of the items suggests that they were allowed to indulge in their preferences without any restrictions. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Mike loves his faithful friend Spot very much. 
Explanation: The story states that Mike ""felt ready to have a dog"" and then he got a Golden Retriever and named him Spot. This implies that Mike wanted a dog as a companion and was excited to have one. Additionally, the sentence ""Now Mike and Spot take walks in the park every weekend"" suggests that Mike has a strong bond with Spot and enjoys spending time with him. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - Grant loaned Joe some money. "
Response:  Option A: After a long time, he learned to code properly. This option is more likely because learning to code requires dedication and practice, which can take time. It's unlikely that someone would switch topics mid-way through their learning process without any prior experience or knowledge of coding.
"Response: 
B: Rakesh loved eating lobster. 
Explanation: The story states that Rakesh decided to cook lobster for dinner, indicating that he enjoys eating it. Additionally, the fact that he picked out a large lobster at the seafood market suggests that he wanted to prepare a substantial meal. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: After that mistake, I became much more cautious. 
Explanation:  When you are learning something new like driving, it is normal to make mistakes along the way. In this case, the speaker lost track of the brake pedal while driving for the first time. Instead of becoming discouraged or embarrassed by their mistake, they became more cautious in their future driving experiences. This choice reflects a realistic response to a minor mishap during the learning process."
"Response: 
B - Ron was very unhappy that it had snowed so much. 
Explanation:  In this story, Ron's reaction to the snow suggests that he does not enjoy winter weather or playing in the snow. He would rather spend the day doing something else than play in the snow with his friends. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
Option A: He didn't listen until we got a lot of ants one spring."
"Response: 
Option B: Brad hated his mother for getting the eggs. 
Explanation: In this story, Brad wants eggs for breakfast but runs out. When his mother comes home with eggs, it would be reasonable to assume that Brad is upset or disappointed because he no longer needs them. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Paulo felt proud of his accomplishment. 
Explanation: In this story, Paulo took action by asking other students for their support in the election. He didn't give up when he was initially worried about not being elected, but instead persisted in seeking help from others. As a result, he was successful in getting elected to the student council. This shows that Paulo felt proud of his accomplishment, which is option B."
"Response: 
B: It didn't break the skin, but Patrick was scared and cried!"
"Response:  Option A: I was so angry at myself! 
Explanation: The story states that the speaker ""spilled wine all over"" their new white dress, which suggests that they are upset about the damage caused by the spill. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option A: I am much healthier now.  
Explanation: The story states that the person used to be heavy set, but they have since lost weight through exercise and diet. This suggests that their current weight is lower than it was before, making option A the more likely choice."
"Response: 
B: Kelly was mad that the Celtics won and not the opposition. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it's more likely that Kelly would be upset if the Celtics won instead of her favorite team. This is because she loves going to games, which suggests that she has a strong interest in the sport and wants her team to win. Therefore, it makes sense that she would be disappointed or angry if they didn't come out on top."
"Response:  Option A: Jane’s girlfriend was a die-hard flower lover. 
Explanation: The story states that Jane's girlfriend ""never gets tired"" of working at the flower shop, which suggests that she has a strong passion for flowers. It also implies that she appreciates small gestures like receiving a rose from Jane, which further supports this option. There is no information in the story to suggest that Jane enjoys outdoor activities like biking or hiking, so option B is unlikely."
"Response: 
B: Michael loved the view and hoped to return."
"Response: 
B: The next day, Damon found his wallet under the bed. 
Explanation: This option is more likely because people often misplace items and then find them later in unexpected places. It's possible that Damon was searching high and low for his wallet but didn't think to check under the bed until after he had given up hope of finding it. Once he checked under the bed, he probably realized where he must have left it."
"Response: 
B - David and Mia thought the movie was profound. 
Explanation: The story states that David and Mia were ""looking forward"" to seeing the movie and were ""finally able to get away."" This implies that they were excited about going out together without their kids. However, when the movie turned out to be bad, instead of leaving in disgust or disappointment, they found themselves enjoying it ironically or even finding it profound. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Bob's daughter thanked Grandma for the delicious meal. "
"Response: 
B: Suzi's cat was saved. "
"Response: 
B - All the fish got along fine. 
Explanation: In this story, Ava introduced a new fish (a catfish) into an existing aquarium with other fish. The outcome of this situation depends on various factors such as the size and temperament of the new fish, the species of the other fish in the tank, and the overall environment of the tank. However, based on the information provided in the story, there is no indication that any of the other fish were aggressive or territorial towards the new catfish, suggesting that they got along just fine. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Response: 
B - I still go to the same theatre that I always have.
Explanation: The speaker mentions that they used to go to the movies almost every weekend, but since the local theater closed down, they now have to drive further to watch a movie. This suggests that they are not willing or able to change their habits and preferences, even if it means going to a different location. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B) I drive the car everywhere I go. 
Explanation: Based on the description of the car as ""shiny and red"" and how it smells ""fresh and clean,"" it's clear that the speaker is very happy with their new purchase. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice, as it suggests that the speaker will be driving the car everywhere they go, enjoying its features and taking pride in their new possession."
"Response: 
B) She was disqualified from the contest. "
"Response: 
B: She was jumping up and down begging for another walk."
"Response: 
B: The puppy's owner strangled it and offered Matt the corpse.
Explanation: This option is more likely because it fits with the darker tone of the story. While Option A would be a happy ending where everyone gets what they want, Option B adds an element of danger and unpredictability that makes the story more interesting. Additionally, it highlights the possibility of negative consequences when someone finds something valuable, which can create tension and suspense in the narrative."
"Response: 
B - Mike accidentally collided with the kids.
Explanation: The story states that Mike was not wearing a helmet while riding, which increases the likelihood of an accident occurring. Additionally, the fact that he collided with other children who were also not wearing helmets suggests that it was a preventable accident. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Lucy realized the meal was perfectly cooked. 
Explanation: The story states that Lucy ""checked the timer"" after noticing smoke coming from the oven, which implies that she initially thought the food might be burning. However, since the timer didn't go off, it's more likely that the food actually turned out well-cooked rather than burnt."
"Response: 
B: Tim failed the final exam. 
Explanation:  The story states that Tim started to nod off during class, indicating that he was not paying attention. Since he only woke up when class was almost over, it is likely that he missed important material covered towards the end of the class. As a result, he may have struggled on the final exam and potentially failed."
"Response: 
B - Amy hung up the phone angrily."
"Response: 
B) He was happy about his computer.
Explanation: The story states that Sam ""shrugged"" when he saw the error message on his screen, indicating a lack of concern or worry. This suggests that he was actually happy about the situation rather than upset or frustrated. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B: They ate it shortly after. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Doug and Molly are responsible or caring people who would keep a lost dog. In fact, the story implies the opposite when it states ""They ate it shortly after."" This suggests that they may have been cruel or neglectful towards the animal, which is more consistent with their character based on the context of the story."
"Response: 
Option B: As Bill got older, he realized all of that practice helped him. 
Explanation: The story states that Bill was too young to understand the value of practice, implying that he did not initially appreciate or enjoy it. However, as he grew older, he came to realize how much those hours of practice had benefited him, suggesting that he eventually developed a greater appreciation for the work he put in."
"Response: 
B - After getting home, Carlos decided to go play soccer with his friends."
"Response: 
B: His wife was so angry she took the kids to sleep at her mother’s house. 
Explanation: The story states that Lance ""forgot to check the cooking"" and burned down the kitchen, which suggests that he may not have been paying attention to what he was doing while trying to create a romantic evening for his wife. This carelessness could understandably make his wife feel frustrated or even angry, leading her to take the children to stay with her mother instead of returning home to deal with the aftermath of the kitchen fire."
"Response: 
B: Keith watched some of the colorful fish."
"Response: 
B - Maria was proud to learn a new language so quickly."
"Response: 
B - Jay layed down and took a nap.
Explanation: The story states that Jay had been battling his claustrophobia for two hours, which suggests that he may have become exhausted or fatigued during this time. Given this information, it is more likely that Jay would lie down and take a nap rather than wait for rescue."
"Response: 
B - He ended up babysitting to pay for college.
Explanation: The story does not provide any evidence or indications that Ben was involved in any illegal activity, such as pedophilia. In fact, it suggests that he enjoyed spending time with the child and found him entertaining. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Ted decided to run for county magistrate a year later. 
Explanation: The story states that Ted's personal issue derailed his campaign, which means that he did not win the election. Since he could not continue as a senator due to this issue, it makes sense that he would consider running for another political office at a lower level, such as county magistrate, a year later. This option provides a realistic conclusion to the story."
"Response: 
B - Next time she got a ball she was more careful with it. 
Explanation: Julie learned from her experience of losing her favorite ball in the creek that she needed to be more careful when playing outside. This means that next time she gets a new ball, she will be more mindful of where she plays with it so as not to lose it again. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this story."
"Response: 
B: We thanked Mama for her huge favor. "
"Response: 
Option B: Bob had also forgotten his shoes. 
Explanation: The story provides no evidence that Bob has ever been reckless before, so Option A is unlikely. Additionally, the fact that Bob forgot his malaria vaccine suggests that he may not have been as prepared for the trip as he could have been. It's more plausible that Bob simply forgot his shoes, which would be a careless mistake rather than a characteristic of his personality."
"Response: 
B - Carl decided to throw the old bike away. 
Explanation:  As John got older, he no longer needed or wanted his childhood bike. It held sentimental value but was also outdated and not safe for a young boy like Carl to ride. Therefore, it made sense for Carl to dispose of the bike instead of passing it down to his son."
"Response: 
B) She slowly drank a glass of water to calm her stomach."
"Response: 
B - Carl then became a garbage man.  
Explanation:  While it is possible that Carl could have become a scientist, given his interest in astronomy, it is also plausible that he may not have pursued a career in science. There are many reasons why someone might choose not to pursue a career in their area of passion or interest, including personal circumstances, financial constraints, or simply discovering another field they find equally fulfilling. In this case, Carl may have discovered that working as a garbage man allowed him to use his skills and interests in a different way, such as organizing and categorizing trash, which can be seen as a form of problem-solving similar to scientific inquiry."
"Response: 
B) Julie gave Barry a hug and thanked him. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Julie is not embarrassed by Barry's prank but instead thanks him for his kindness. This suggests that Julie has a positive attitude and does not let Barry's teasing get to her. It also shows that Julie values their friendship and appreciates Barry's efforts to make her feel included at work."
"Response: 
B: James was ashamed of what he had done. 
Explanation: The story states that James ""decided to begin training for a marathon"" and then ""ran the marathon."" However, it does not state that James achieved any particular goal or finish time during the race. In fact, the story explicitly states that James was ""ashamed of what he had done,"" which suggests that he did not perform as well as he had hoped. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B - From then on, I made sure to leave myself plenty of travel time.  
Explanation: The protagonist's reckless behavior led to an accident, which taught them a lesson about being more careful in their daily commute. Rather than deciding to pursue cycling as a profession (which would be unrelated to the incident), they learned from their mistake by leaving themselves extra time for their journey."
"Response: 
B: The teacher joined their conversation."
"Response: 
B - Daniel turned on the kitchen light and had a snack. 
Explanation: The story states that Daniel ""noticed the lights in his home wouldn't turn on,"" which implies that he tried to use them but they didn't work. However, it then says that he ""checked the fridge,"" which suggests that he might have been looking for something to eat or drink. Therefore, option B is more likely because it shows Daniel taking action to satisfy his hunger rather than checking the breaker box."
"Response: 
B) I enjoyed talking to the officer. 
Explanation: The context of the situation suggests that the speaker was stopped by a police officer for speeding, which can be a stressful experience for many people. However, in this scenario, the speaker reports enjoying their conversation with the officer, indicating that they may have had a positive interaction despite the initial reason for the stop. This choice is more likely than option A because it better aligns with the tone and content of the story."
"Response: 
B: Melissa's mother suggested putting her son to bed later."
"Response: 
B - Mark became famous and made a lot of money. 
Explanation: The story states that Mark ""had won all rounds"" in the fight, which implies that he performed well and emerged victorious. Additionally, the fact that he was ""getting ready for a big fight"" suggests that this was a significant event or competition, which could potentially lead to fame and financial success. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Mark's story."
Response:  Option A: Rex enjoys himself. 
"Response: 
B - Burning the Organ.  
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Ken was interested in learning to play the organ or taking it home to practice on. Instead, the story implies that Ken had no interest in playing the organ and instead decided to destroy it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"Response: 
B - They never used the tank. 
Explanation: The story states that Jay and Bella ""set the tank up"" but it didn't specify what they did after setting it up, which implies that they never actually used the tank."
"Response: 
B - They had a wonderful picnic, despite the warm drinks. 
Explanation: The story states that May's friends had a sense of humor, which suggests they were able to laugh about the mistake and enjoy themselves anyway. It's unlikely they would fill their cups with ice just to make the drinks cold when there are other ways to have fun at a picnic. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B: Sandra was upset that her parents refused to buy her a turtle."
"Response: 
B - The children decided to play marbles. 
Explanation:  In this story, it makes more sense that the children would decide to continue playing marbles after giving up on their initial activity (playing with marbles) than for them to switch to a completely different game like hide and seek."
"Response: 
Option B: Francisco became a plumber. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Francisco's career aspirations or goals, nor does it suggest that he had any particular interest in becoming an accountant. In fact, the story states that he ""knew"" he would have to work hard to achieve his dream, which implies that he did not necessarily want to be an accountant. Therefore, option B (Francisco became a plumber) is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Response: 
B) Then she threw the pinecones in the garbage. 
Explanation: Jessica's plan to feed the birds using pinecones with peanut butter and birdseed did not work as expected. Instead of hanging them on the trees, she ended up throwing them away in the garbage. This outcome suggests that her method was not effective or practical for feeding the birds."
Response:  Option A: This would be our new favorite restaurant. 
"Response:  Option A: She was full and happy. 
Explanation: The story states that Betsy wanted something simple and quick to eat after coming home late at night. Since she already had spaghetti and sauce in the house, it's more likely that she was hungry for something easy and satisfying rather than craving a different type of food like cheeseburgers. Additionally, the fact that she fell asleep immediately after eating suggests that she was indeed satisfied with her meal."
"Response: 
B - Their child looked like both of them.
Explanation:  The story states that Han and Leia had a child, which suggests that they had offspring. Additionally, since their child resembled both of them, it is likely that they passed on their physical characteristics to their child. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Response: 
B: Gina's teacher wasn't fooled at all and gave her more detention."
"Response: 
B: Jill stopped meditating.
Explanation: The story states that Jill ""began to practice meditation"" when she discovered she had anxiety, but it does not say anything about her continuing to meditate after that. It's possible that she may have lost interest or found another way to manage her anxiety."
"Response: 
B: And saw the biggest bear she had ever seen. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Jan was in a hurry and driving in her housecoat and slippers, which suggests that it is not a typical day or time for her to be at the school. Additionally, the fact that Jan went to the door of the class to find her daughter implies that something unusual must have happened. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story, as it provides an unexpected twist by introducing the presence of a big bear at the school."
"Response: 
B) Sara laughed hysterically. 
Explanation:  When someone experiences an unexpected injury or setback, it's common to react with laughter as a way of coping with the surprise or absurdity of the situation. In this case, since Sara broke her big toe while going on pointe, which is a challenging and precise movement, it's possible that she might find the irony or humor in the situation and laugh rather than cry."
"Response: 
B: Pat also thinks he should have taken a job in Connecticut. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Pat has been commuting daily from New York to New Jersey for many years, which implies that he has been working in New York City. However, as an old man, he realizes that he could have saved himself the trouble of the long commute if he had taken a job in Connecticut instead. This option is more likely because it aligns with the narrative of Pat regretting not making a different choice earlier in life."
"Response: 
B) Todd wore a silly costume to his hockey game. 
Explanation: The story states that ""tonight was the big game,"" indicating that it's an important event for Todd, and he's feeling nervous about it. Wearing a silly costume wouldn't necessarily make him feel more confident or calm, so option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B: Joan was thankful that her roommate was so caring. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Joan's roommate takes steps to address Joan's concern about being disturbed by their music. By wearing headphones, the roommate shows that they are willing to accommodate Joan's needs and make sure she can get a good night's rest. This action demonstrates care and consideration for Joan, which suggests that the roommate is trying to maintain a positive relationship with them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option A - He showered after he finished working out. This option makes sense because it's common for people to shower after exercising at the gym to cool down and clean themselves. It's unlikely that Pete would go straight from the gym to a baseball stadium without changing or showering first.
"Response: 
B - Clare wished she brought a warm jacket. 
Explanation: In this story, Clare starts by going for a walk in the morning when it's still early and not yet hot outside. However, as the sun rises, Clare begins to feel hot, indicating that it has become warmer. Option B is the more logical choice because it acknowledges that Clare wishes she had brought a warm jacket to keep her comfortable during the increasing heat. Option A does not make sense in this context since taking off her jacket would only make her feel cooler, not address the issue of the rising temperature."
"Response: 
B - She earned enough to buy the dress."
"Response: 
B) They just walked comfortably in silence for a while."
"Response: 
Option A: Harry quickly fixed the problem for his mother. "
"Response: 
B - I do not enjoy helping people.
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it seems that the person has been scammed by other requesters in the past, which has led them to feel frustrated and unmotivated to help others. This suggests that they may not enjoy helping people, especially if they have negative experiences associated with doing so."
"Response: 
B: Kevin thanked Stacy and they enjoyed their time at the park. "
"Response: 
B) However, Glen hugs his mother-in-law. 
Explanation: The story suggests that there may be tension between Glenn and his mother-in-law, but it also implies that they have a close relationship. It is unlikely that he would accuse her of trying to poison him without any evidence, especially since he has been married to Dana long enough to know her mother well. Therefore, option B is more likely, as Glenn decides to hug his mother-in-law despite his initial suspicion."
"Response: 
B: Next week she would relax when it was all over. 
Explanation: Kendall is tired from working multiple shows during fashion week, but she knows that next week will be a break after it's all over. This suggests that she will take some time off to rest and recharge before starting another busy period. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
B: We decided to return home instead. 
Explanation: The story mentions that the family would drive from Florida to Michigan every year, but it does not mention any specific destination or reason for their trip. It also states that they would pack up all their stuff and load them into the truck, which suggests that they were planning a long road trip. However, the story ends with ""We decided to return home instead,"" which implies that something unexpected happened during the trip that caused them to change their plans. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
B: Her attempts at solving murders, however, were less successful.
Explanation: The story states that Gill starts acting like Columbo sometimes, implying that she may be trying to solve murders in the same way as the character. However, since Gill has not been shown to have any actual detective skills or experience, it is unlikely that her attempts at solving murders would be successful. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: He did not miss the last one, but was still disappointed. 
Explanation: The story states that Chad ""missed"" his second-to-last strike, which implies that he did not make it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Additionally, the story does not mention anything about Chad scoring a touchdown, so option B is unlikely."
"Response: 
B) His cheating wife called the police and he was arrested. 
Explanation:  
The story suggests that the man who burst into the room was angry about something, which implies that he had a reason to be upset with one of the men inside the room. Since the story does not provide any information about why he was angry, it is more likely that he was angry about an ongoing affair rather than a recent event. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
B - Ivan bought mosquito repellent for his next hike.

"Response: 
B: Paige had to rely on her friends for their support. "
"Response: 
B: John was glad he asked her on a date."
"Response: 
B: The flute sounded beautiful.
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that the man enjoyed listening to the flute's music after cleaning it. The fact that he took the time to wipe away the dust suggests that he valued the instrument and wanted to hear its full potential. Additionally, starting to play a song implies that he was pleased with how the flute sounded, which further supports option B."
"Response:  Option B: The ride was very fun for Maggie.  
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it's more likely that Maggie enjoyed the ride than that she was relieved the wait was short. The story mentions that Maggie was ""scared and excited"" to go on the ride, which suggests that she was looking forward to it. Additionally, the fact that she and her mother waited in line for a long time implies that they were both eager to experience the ride together. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
