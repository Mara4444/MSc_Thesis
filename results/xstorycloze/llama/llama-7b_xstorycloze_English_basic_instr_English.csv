"B: Eventually I watched them all. 
Explanation: The story states that the person became a fan of Law and Order in 2011, after recovering from a stroke. This implies that they were not already a fan of the show before their recovery, which means they would have had to start watching it for the first time during this period. Given that they were able to watch every episode, it is more likely that they chose option B and eventually watched them all."
"Bob told the man to leave him alone.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Bob is not interested in playing the character from the movie and finds it frustrating when people ask him to do so. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome, as Bob would tell the man to leave him alone rather than obliging his request."
B - Lita folded the laundry while watching television.
B - Liv then changed the light bulb.
B: The children's behavior calmed the mother down.
"Option B: Hector started buying more coffee from Starbucks. 
Explanation:  The story states that Hector realized his coffee buying habit was expensive, but then he starts buying more coffee from Starbucks instead of continuing to make it at home. This suggests that Hector may have enjoyed the convenience or taste of Starbucks' coffee more than the homemade version, leading him to spend more money on it."
B - Kelly was happy to have made a new friend.
B: He was proud to finish first by age but tenth overall.
B) Laurie ended the night by kissing her date.
B - Neil saved the photos on his computer.
"B - Bob went out after work wearing the sailor suit. 
Explanation: The story states that Bob ""forgot"" to change back into his street clothes, which implies that he did not have time to do so before leaving work. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as Bob would have gone home in the same uniform he wore to work."
Option A: My dog bit her.
"B - Decides Never to Draw Again.
Explanation: 
Lester may have enjoyed creating the drawing, but he may also feel intimidated by how good it turned out. If he feels that he can't replicate that level of quality again, he might decide to give up drawing altogether rather than continue to struggle with it."
"B: Pablo does not enjoy eating worms.
Explanation: The text states that Pablo ""read a book in school on how to do this"" (emphasis added), which implies that he may have been forced or coerced into trying it, rather than genuinely wanting to eat worms. Additionally, the fact that he only does this ""at least once a month"" suggests that it's not something he particularly enjoys or looks forward to. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Pablo's situation."
"B: It was the best trip of her life. 
Explanation: Kira's love for Japanese culture and years of saving money for her trip suggest that she is passionate about exploring this new culture. Option A, where she spends all the money on shoes, goes against this character trait as it does not align with her interests or personality. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the outcome of the story."
"B: Glen swore he'd never walk again. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Glen had an unfortunate accident while walking that caused him to injure his knee. As a result, he may be hesitant or reluctant to continue walking, especially if the injury is severe enough. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as Glen would likely be deterred from walking again due to the pain and discomfort associated with it."
B - His friends polished his furniture.
"B: The driver of the car became very angry at me. 
Explanation: In this situation, you were hit by a car while crossing the street. While some people might be understanding or even grateful for your forgiveness, it's more likely that the driver would become angry or defensive if they believed their actions caused harm to another person. This reaction makes sense given the context of the situation, as the driver may feel responsible for what happened and could potentially try to shift blame onto you. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome in this scenario."
"B: Gina's sister went to the doctor. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Gina's sister would go to the doctor after cutting her ankle on broken glass than have ice cream as a result. Cuts can be serious injuries and may require medical attention to prevent infection or further complications."
"B: At the end of the year, he did well on his reading test.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it aligns with how children typically develop and progress in their learning. With consistent effort and practice, a child's reading skills can improve significantly over time. It is less likely for a child to suddenly accept that they will never improve without any efforts or interventions."
B - Rosie kept the bowl of fruit salad in her fridge at home.
B - Kelly bought a new phone.
B - I have negative memories of that time.
Option B: Bob was very ashamed.
"B - Her classmates were given awards for their behavior. 
Explanation:  It is more likely that Jackie's classmates will be rewarded for their disruptive behavior rather than being punished. Giving rewards for bad behavior can reinforce negative behaviors, making it less likely for students to change their ways. On the other hand, suspending or disciplining students can have a greater impact on changing their behavior."
"B: We were both flattened by the vehicle. 
Explanation: The story states that another car ran a stop sign and crashed into them, which suggests that the impact was severe enough to cause serious injury or even death to both the narrator and their father. Option B is therefore the more likely outcome."
Option A: She sings it over and over again.
"B - He attempted a three-pointer and missed. 
Reason:  Alex's decision to take a three-pointer with only five seconds remaining in the game is risky and unlikely to result in a successful shot. It would be more likely for him to pass the ball to an open teammate or try to draw fouls on the defense rather than taking a long shot that could miss."
"B - Asked him what his problem was. 
Explanation: The fact that the protagonist became frustrated when they saw the child staring at them suggests that they may have been feeling uncomfortable or self-conscious about being watched. By asking the child what their problem was, the protagonist is taking an active step towards addressing the situation and potentially resolving any discomfort or conflict that may arise. Option A does not provide a clear resolution to the situation and leaves the reader wondering how the protagonist will react next."
B - The couple will be happy to know they have a baby on the way.
"Option B: Catherine thought curling looked boring. 
Explanation:  The story states that Catherine was ""intrigued"" by curling but after being invited to play, she thought it looked boring. This suggests that Catherine did not find the sport as interesting as she initially thought, and therefore will unlikely continue practicing or playing it regularly."
Option B: Francis decides he would rather take public transportation.
B - I wanted to see it again.
B - When I got there, I took a nap.
B - Lisa confesses she also has a crush on Gary.
B) Carlos makes the most of his French on his trip to Paris.
"Option A: Lars fell in love with photography. 
Explanation:  The story states that Lars ""shot images of nature every day"" after buying his first camera, which implies that he enjoyed taking pictures and found it enjoyable. Additionally, the fact that he continued to take photos daily suggests that he developed a passion for photography. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"B) The employee was later found dead. 
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it provides a twist on the typical outcome of a broken appliance. In this scenario, the employee who sold you the warranty may be connected to your broken TV in some way, perhaps by being responsible for its malfunction or by having a personal stake in your misfortune. This adds an element of mystery and suspense to the story, making it more intriguing than simply having the TV repaired under warranty."
B - Ryan then found the girl and gave her the balloon she lost.
Option A: Then she sent it to her manager.
Option A: Neil had a great time.
"B - I let my dog go inside the house. 
Explanation:  The story states that the protagonist ""could not find"" the leash, which implies that they did not have one available. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as the protagonist would need to find another way to control their dog while on a walk. Option A is unlikely because taking the dog to the backyard does not provide any means of controlling the dog's movement or ensuring its safety during the walk."
"B - Joe regretted going outside. 
Explanation:  The story states that Joe got tired halfway to the coffee shop, indicating that he may not have been in the best physical condition for walking. Additionally, the fact that he had to get tired before reaching his destination suggests that he may not have been prepared for such an activity. Therefore, option B is more likely as Joe may have regretted going outside due to his fatigue or lack of preparation."
B) Jen found her new coat inside the package.
"B: Frank got an all-new game.
Explanation:  In this story, Frank misbehaved by throwing a tantrum when he was told to do his homework before playing video games. As a consequence, he received a reward rather than a punishment. It is more likely that Frank would receive a positive reinforcement in the form of a new game as a reward for good behavior, rather than having his existing games taken away as a punishment."
Option A: Timmy won the competition.
"B: Drake told the host he wanted to attend his parties again. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it seems unlikely that the host would admit to stealing Drake's wallet. It's more plausible that they might deny any knowledge of it (option A). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"B - Bob drove his truck to the market. 
Explanation:  The story states that Bob has never changed a tire before, which suggests he may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to change it successfully. It is more likely that he would drive his truck to the market to get help from someone who can change the tire for him."
"Option A: Now Jack actually enjoys replying to emails. 
Explanation: The story states that Jack was ""tired"" of writing emails, indicating that he did not enjoy doing so. However, after purchasing a new laptop, he now finds pleasure in responding to emails, suggesting that the new device improved his experience with this task. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
B - Jake got the job.
B: I was really pleased.
B) Sarah's letter was soon heading to its destination.
B) He then felt compelled to get back to work.
"Option B: Bob continued to use his plastic grocery bags to go shopping. 
Explanation: The story states that Bob's friend told him that plastic is bad for the environment, but it does not say that Bob actually changed his behavior. Therefore, it is more likely that Bob continued to use his plastic grocery bags than that he switched to reusable bags."
B - The artist painted a picture of Joe's cat instead of a portrait of Joe.
B: Ann was able to quit smoking successfully.
B - The room was full of shelves of books that appealed to girls.
"B) Rob was bummed when the cute nurse wasn't in that day.
Explanation: The story states that Rob is normally afraid of dentists, but he was excited to go because of a new nurse at the office. This implies that Rob finds the nurses attractive and is therefore more motivated to visit the dentist when one of them is present. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"B - Joe decided not to eat dirt again. 
Explanation:  The story states that Joe ""bit down on a rock"" and lost his tooth, indicating that he will no longer be eating dirt or making mud pies. This outcome is more likely than option A, which suggests that Joe wants to continue eating rocks despite losing a tooth."
"B - Rob's friends were thoughtless. 
Explanation:  
The story states that Rob has never been on a rollercoaster before, but his friends offered him a free ticket without asking if he wanted to go or if it was something he would enjoy. This suggests that they did not consider Rob's feelings or preferences when offering him the ticket, which makes them thoughtless. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
B - Carly ordered take-out over the phone.
B) Amy walked out of the room and left the house.
B - I gave Pan a big hug.
B - Becky is proud of Ashley.
"B - One night, Pam decided to release the dogs. 
Explanation:  The context of the story suggests that Pam has had enough of the constant barking from their thoughtless neighbor's dog. She has been fantasizing about unleashing the dog so it will run away. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome as it aligns with Pam's frustration and desire for relief from the noise. Option A does not make sense in this scenario as there are no cats involved in the situation."
B) She even liked all of her professors.
"B - Mary left the dentist's office in a good mood.
Explanation:  
In this scenario, Mary was expecting the dentist to put her to sleep for the procedure, but instead, he only numbed the area with Novocaine. This unexpected turn of events may have caught Mary off guard, but it also means that she did not experience any pain or discomfort during the procedure. As a result, Mary might leave the dentist's office feeling relieved and satisfied with the outcome, which is option B."
"B: Ford was proud of his accomplishments. 
Explanation: The story states that Ford was ""proud"" of his high GPA and that he worked hard to achieve it. This suggests that Ford felt good about his academic success and took pride in his efforts. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Ford's character."
"B - I am unmarried.
Explanation: The narrator admits that his wife has said he lacks passion, which suggests they are married. If he were unmarried, there would be no need for him to defend himself against this accusation. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
B - Nina was excited
"B - Veronika decides to visit the tree house more often. 
Explanation:  The story states that Veronika ""was amazed"" by the tree house, which suggests that she enjoyed finding it. Additionally, her decision to ""visit the tree house more often"" implies that she finds it interesting or enjoyable. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
B) Tracey shrugged off her fall.
B - He decided to go for a run.
"B - Jim drove away before his wife showed. 
Explanation: The story states that Jim was ""very bored"" while he waited for his wife, which suggests that he may have been eager to leave or distracted from the wait. Additionally, the fact that he decides to ""catch up on his book"" implies that he has other things to do rather than simply wait for his wife's arrival. Given these details, it is more likely that Jim drove away before his wife arrived, rather than waiting patiently for her."
Option A: Joe was still very proud of his hard work.
"B - Gina mowed the whole yard and had no help from anyone.
Explanation:  The story states that Gina wanted a Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper, but did not mention anything about her wanting to buy one online or finding one for sale. Instead, it implies that Gina may have tried to earn money by doing chores or work around the house in order to purchase the item herself. This suggests that option B is more likely than option A."
B - Leah chastised her cat.
Option A: Peter thought it might even be more comfortable than the old one.
"B - Everyone enjoyed the cheese and bread. 
Explanation: The story states that Rex ran out to buy a baguette, which suggests that he was preparing food for his guests. It also mentions that he sliced the baguette into thin even pieces, indicating that he wanted to make it easy for his guests to eat. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"B) She missed her stop and had to take a bus home. 
Explanation: The fact that Ali worked hard all day and took work home suggests that she is diligent and dedicated to her job. It is unlikely that she would be lazy or not care about her work, so option A can be ruled out. Additionally, falling asleep on the train is a common occurrence for people who are tired or feeling unwell, which makes option B more plausible. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
"B - The crowd all stood up in their seats and applauded wildly. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the team has just scored the winning touchdown with only seconds remaining in the game, leading to an exciting finish that would likely result in enthusiastic cheering from the crowd. Option A, where the crowd boos the team, does not fit with the context of the situation as there is no indication of any mistakes or poor play by the team, only excitement and joy at their victory."
"B: We loved the strong wind and lack of sleep.
Explanation: This option is more likely because it goes against what one might expect from the situation described. It's unusual for people to enjoy being without their internet connection or having difficulty sleeping due to strong winds. Therefore, choosing this option adds an unexpected twist to the story, making it more interesting and engaging."
B) Then her keyboard arrived in the mail.
B - Jon rejected the offer.
B) Julie punched her friend in the eye.
B - Amy thought the park was boring.
B) Steve was upset.
"B - When she came home she fell asleep immediately, exhausted.
Explanation: The story states that the child ""had a blast"" at the party, indicating that they were energetic and excited after attending. It is unlikely that they would fall asleep immediately upon returning home, especially if they are still in the midst of their excitement from the party. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Option B: The public reaction to the book means Bob still goes hungry. 
Explanation: In this story, Bob wrote a book about his hard life in order to make money. However, even though people praised the book and bought thousands of copies, it does not necessarily mean that Bob has enough money to eat. It is possible that the profits from the book sales are not enough to cover Bob's basic needs, or that he may have spent all of the money on other things without thinking about how he would pay for food. Therefore, option B is the more realistic outcome for Bob's situation."
"B: I'm really disappointed in myself.
Explanation: While completing a marathon is certainly an impressive achievement, if you only ran six miles (which is less than half of a traditional marathon distance) and trained for three months, you may feel disappointed that your training did not prepare you enough to complete the full distance. Additionally, setting a goal to run a marathon and falling short of that goal can be demotivating and lead to feelings of disappointment."
"Option A: Bobby was five years old. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Bobby ""folded his fruit roll-up into the shape of an airplane"" and then throws it, indicating that he is young child who does not have the strength or coordination to throw something heavier than a small object like a fruit roll-up. Additionally, the fact that he decides that planes should be made out of paper suggests that he lacks experience and knowledge about aircraft design, which would also be typical for a young child. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
B - Sam's dad was glad his son was interested in geology.
B - He asked her to marry him.
B - Bobby went into the shed to get a ladder to get the bananas.
"Option A: Beth needed to rest. 
Explanation: The story states that Beth was recovering from an illness, which means she needed to rest in order to fully recover. Taking a day off from school to rest and heal is a logical choice for someone who has been sick. Playing football would not be a good idea while still feeling unwell, as it could exacerbate her condition or set back her recovery. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
B - Sadly, they were ruined and Rhonda had to buy a new pair.
"B) Marcus then vomited from sea sickness. 
Explanation: The context of the story suggests that Marcus is feeling unwell due to the rough seas, which makes sense if he is experiencing sea sickness. Option A does not fit with the tone of the story as Marcus is described as cowering in fear rather than being excited or happy. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Marcus in this situation."
Option A: She cuddled with the adorable puppy, happy to see it.
B) Chuck was happy that place finally closed down.
B - While thinking, Steve came up with an idea for a novel.
"B - The officer was understanding.
Explanation:  In this scenario, it is more likely that the police officer would be understanding given the circumstances of forgetting one's wallet and realizing it after being pulled over. It is unlikely that the officer would assume John intended to drive without a valid ID or engage in any illegal activity, especially since John promptly admitted to forgetting his wallet upon being asked. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
B - Tom was upset that he did poorly.
Option A: She enjoyed the song.
"B - The janitor was frightened.
Explanation: 
The story states that ""the roof shook under the new weight,"" which suggests that it may be unsafe for someone to be on top of the building, especially if they are not properly trained or equipped to handle such situations. It's likely that the janitor felt scared or intimidated by this situation, making option B the more likely choice."
B: It was the best birthday party ever.
B) It smelled so good that I ate it.
"B: I have no memory of going to Paragon Park. 
Explanation: The passage describes a specific event that occurred in 1963, but it does not provide any personal details or emotional connections to suggest that the speaker was actually present at the event. In fact, the language used suggests that the speaker may not even remember visiting Paragon Park, as they use phrases like ""we took"" and ""our parents took."" This implies that the speaker may not have been involved in the events described in the passage. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Option A:  One day, I decided to buy the movie. 
Explanation:  The speaker's love for the movie suggests that they have seen it multiple times before deciding to own a copy of it. This aligns with Option A, which states that the speaker decided to buy the movie after watching it numerous times as a child."
"B - Mary Ann finished making her salad and enjoyed eating it. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Mary Ann encountered anything harmful or unpleasant during her walk, such as getting a rash from poison ivy. Instead, it mentions things she observed while walking, including people and animals, which suggests that she had a pleasant experience. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B - The dog found him and mauled him.
"B: They gave me a book on the history of the computer.
Explanation: The story mentions that the speaker's favorite animal is the Arabian Oryx, which is not typically found in Africa. This suggests that the speaker may be more interested in technology or computers than in African wildlife. Therefore, option B, ""They gave me a book on the history of the computer,"" is the most likely ending to the story."
"B - She played basketball with her friends all afternoon.
Explanation: The story states ""Sure enough, she didn't do it one evening."" This implies that the daughter did not complete her homework despite being given the opportunity to do so. It does not make sense for her to play basketball with her friends if she has unfinished homework, as this would be a violation of school rules. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
B - The coach offered the boy the starting pitcher position.
B) Sarah found spoiled milk on her desk.
"B) Mark's coworker told him he wasn't going to vote in the election. 
Explanation:  There is no mention of an election or voting in the original story, so option B is the most unlikely choice. Option A is also incorrect because there is no indication in the story that Mark was experiencing any other type of dental pain besides his wisdom teeth hurting."
B - Lulu turned on the dishwasher.
"Option A - Bill was proud of his work. 
Explanation: In this story, Farmer Bill successfully called out the cows in the field and provided them with food. This suggests that he took good care of his animals and was proud of his work. Therefore, option A is the most likely ending to the story."
Option A: He agreed.
"B - Mary is sad she sold a car. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Mary has been struggling to meet her sales targets for a long time, and finally lands a big sale. However, instead of feeling relieved or proud of herself, she feels sad because she knows that she will no longer be able to help another customer find their dream car. This shows that Mary values helping others over meeting her own sales goals, which makes her decision to sell the car more difficult."
Option A: Brie was glad they had become friends.
B - Tim returned the tiles to the store the next day.
"Option B: Dave took control of the helicopter and landed on the field. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Dave went to a Nickelback show, which implies that they were performing in an outdoor venue such as a stadium or arena. It would not be possible for Dave to take control of a helicopter and land it on the field during a concert, as there are typically strict security measures in place to prevent unauthorized aircraft from entering the area. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"B) They mourned for their losses.
Explanation: The fact that there are 199 grave stones suggests that many people have died, which means that those who brought the casket and buried it were probably mourning the loss of their loved ones rather than rejoicing at the sight."
"Option A - Joe eventually won the fight. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it's more likely that Joe would win the fight because he was able to overcome the injury from the left hook and continue fighting effectively. It's unlikely that he would lose the fight after being dominant for the first four rounds, especially since the last seven rounds were a close competition."
B - Jimmy ate another chip from the bag.
"B: My son was happy that we won. 
Explanation: The story states that their simple design ""actually won the derby,"" indicating that they were successful and pleased with their outcome. It's unlikely that they would be unhappy about winning, especially since they put effort into designing their car together as a father-son team."
Option A: He eventually made the team.
"B - Kelly was able to ski uphill on the avalanche.
Explanation: In this scenario, it's unlikely that Kelly would be able to hang onto a tree while being swept away by an avalanche. Instead, she may have been able to use her skis to climb up the side of the avalanche, potentially escaping its path. This option is more plausible than Option A, which suggests that Kelly could hold onto a single tree indefinitely without being injured or buried under the snow."
"Option B: Harry really liked the movie. 
Explanation: The story states that Harry bought a ticket for himself and watched the entire movie, which suggests that he enjoyed it. It does not mention anything about him wanting to see the movie with his friends, so option A is unlikely."
B - He realized he would fit in perfectly at the new job.
B) Ellen felt really calm.
"B: Pearl's sister was seeking revenge. 
Explanation:  The fact that Pearl's sister stole the CD while angry with her suggests that she may have been motivated by a desire for revenge rather than an attempt to please her. This is supported by the language used in the passage, which describes the sister as ""angry"" and implies that she took the CD without permission or consent. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of this situation."
Option A: Anna watched the sea life and thought about the wonder of nature.
"Option B: Brianna loved s'mores. 
Explanation: The story states that Brianna ""gazed at the huge, starry sky in awe"" after tasting her first s'more, indicating that she enjoyed it immensely. This contrasts with option A, where Brianna is shown to be unhappy about going camping and having to give up her usual luxuries like TV. Therefore, option B is more likely to be true."
B) Shay felt overwhelming relief.
"B: The next morning he found he'd made the front page of the paper. 
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it aligns with human nature. People tend to be more interested in their achievements being recognized publicly, especially if they are impressive or historic. Making the front page of the newspaper would provide validation and recognition for Troy's incredible performance, which could motivate him to continue pursuing excellence in basketball. Option A, on the other hand, seems less plausible as it goes against the natural progression of events. After an exciting victory, one might expect Troy to feel proud and confident about his abilities, rather than questioning whether he should give up the sport altogether."
"B - They went back to eat at the same restaurant.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because people often have a strong desire for consistency in their eating habits, even if they know that something has caused them harm in the past. Additionally, many people may not be willing or able to change their dining habits easily, especially if they enjoy a particular restaurant or type of cuisine. Therefore, Simon and his friend may choose to go back to the same restaurant despite having food poisoning before, as it provides familiarity and comfort over trying somewhere new."
B) Arnold screamed in terror!
B - Adam was very proud of Christian.
"B: Kip dreamed of snowflakes.
Explanation: The story states that Kip ""stomped"" his way to his room, indicating that he was upset and frustrated about not having snow for Christmas. It also mentions that he eventually fell asleep, which suggests that he may have been able to relax and calm down through dreaming. Given these details, it is more likely that Kip had a dream about snowflakes rather than being taken to Florida to cheer him up."
B: He gets better with every lesson.
Option B: The bully was expelled.
"B - I was so happy.
Explanation: The story states ""I was so happy"" which suggests that finding the dead animal in the box was not a negative experience for the narrator. Option A does not align with this sentiment as it implies that the narrator would rather avoid the situation altogether by putting the box back without investigating its contents. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"B) She broke up with Sam, leaving him heartbroken.
Explanation: The story implies that Sam and Karen are in a romantic relationship, and that they have been apart for some time due to Karen going away for school. It also suggests that Sam has been missing Karen and has taken the train to visit her on a long weekend. However, the story does not provide any indication that Karen has been thinking about Sam or planning to see him. Instead, it states that she has a plan to ""fix"" things by breaking up with him. This suggests that Karen may be trying to end their relationship rather than make an effort to spend time together. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
B - Then he roasted marshmallows.
B - She threw up in the toilet.
"B - Jason's best friend was not impressed.
Explanation: The story states that Jason's best friend is getting married in India next year, which implies that the best friend is Indian or has strong connections to India. If this is the case, it is unlikely that they would be impressed by Jason's ability to speak Hindi, as it may be expected of him given their cultural background. Instead, they may view his efforts as unnecessary or insufficient."
B) She decided not to speak to Todd either.
B - We had a great time!
B) They gave all the hamburgers to passerby.
"B: This proves girls tell the truth all the time. 
Explanation: The statement ""girls are a lot of trouble"" implies that the speaker has had negative experiences with women in the past, leading them to believe that they cannot be trusted. However, the punchline of the joke - that the last girl the speaker talked to lied about being rich - actually supports the idea that girls tend to be honest. If the speaker truly believed that girls were always dishonest, they would have expected the last girl to confirm this stereotype by lying about her wealth. Instead, the fact that she lied suggests that girls may be more inclined to tell the truth than the speaker gives them credit for. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"B - School was cancelled.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that school would be cancelled due to the severe weather conditions. Three feet of snow falling over several hours would make travel dangerous and difficult, making it unlikely that schools could remain open safely."
B - Larry was excited to have scored his first hole-in-one.
"B) She is very happy no one gave her gifts. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Candy has low self-esteem or a negative body image, as she feels depressed when no one gives her gifts on her birthday. However, later in the story, she expresses happiness that no one gave her gifts, implying that she values being able to control what she eats and doesn't want to indulge in unhealthy foods out of habit or emotional comfort. This choice highlights Candy's desire for self-care and healthy habits, rather than relying on external validation from others."
B - I went to the interview and was happy to get the job.
B - She bought and enjoyed the shoes.
B: Ora took a shower.
"B: Allison thinks bingo is boring.
Explanation: The story states that after Allison got a bingo on the fourth game, she thought bingo was boring. This implies that she did not enjoy playing it as much as she expected to, and may not be interested in playing it again in the future. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for this story."
B: Nya was excited to be able to watch the parade.
B) Madeline's mother happily bought the bag for her.
B - Tom closed his windows to block out as much sunlight as possible.
"B: Ranger fans are looking forward to his return. 
Explanation: The story states that Yu Darvish is finally healthy after being injured for the last two seasons. This means that he will be returning to the team and playing again. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it indicates that Ranger fans are looking forward to his return."
B - Avery finished her project early
B: Chester was very pleased with the shirt he bought.
B - Gina was glad she had wasted her day.
"B - I will do laundry right now. 
Explanation: The protagonist mentions that they have almost no clean clothes left, indicating that they need to do laundry immediately. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Bob was happy.
B - They were disappointed.
"Option B: He thought college was going to be miserable. 
Explanation: The fact that John's mother helped him pack suggests that he may have been feeling anxious or uncertain about starting college. Additionally, the mention of his new roommate being there could indicate that he may not have known what to expect in terms of living arrangements and social dynamics. Given these factors, it is more likely that John would think college is going to be miserable rather than excitedly looking forward to a party invitation."
"B - She was glad she is never bored of music. 
Explanation: Jackie has been a long-distance runner for several years and has become accustomed to listening to music during her runs. When her friend suggested an audiobook, she was hesitant because she enjoys music too much. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Option A - She lasted the whole night.
B) Sam was unhappy.
"Option B: They all freaked out naturally. 
Explanation: The story implies that the friends were not experienced with using a Ouija board and did not know its potential dangers. When they heard the strange banging sound after playing with it, their natural reaction would be to panic or freak out rather than sleeping peacefully."
"B - By the time she got home, it had become warmer due to spring. 
Explanation: The story states that Jan was tired of winter and cold weather, indicating that it is currently winter or at least cooler temperatures. However, since she drives all over the state of Florida, which is known for its warm climate, it implies that by the time she gets home, spring has already arrived, making option B the correct answer."
"B) He left immediately.
Explanation:  Neil's reaction to being in Iran suggests that he found it to be a fascinating place, but his decision to leave immediately implies that there may have been some negative aspect of his experience that led him to depart quickly. It could be that he encountered difficulties or challenges during his time in Iran, such as cultural differences or safety concerns, which caused him to want to leave sooner rather than later."
"B - The girl cried hysterically. 
Explanation:  It is more likely that the girl would cry hysterically if she was nervous or unsure about going on a date with someone new, especially if they are shy or socially anxious like Andrew. This reaction is consistent with the character traits described in the passage."
"B: She boarded her flight just in time. 
Explanation: The story states that Amy heard her name being called over the speaker at the gate, indicating that she made it onto the flight before it departed. This outcome is more likely than Option A, where Amy leaves the airplane and drives home, as this would not be a feasible or realistic scenario given the circumstances of the story."
Option B: Ana was extremely sunburned.
"B: Paul was very pleased with his results. 
Explanation:  In this story, Paul faces rejection from both the Army and the Navy despite his attempts to join them. However, instead of becoming frustrated or discouraged by these setbacks, Paul remains determined and continues to try new things until he finds something that works for him. This attitude shows resilience and determination, which are important qualities in any field. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Paul's story."
"B - The cat decided to lay down and take a nap.
Explanation: Cats are known for their laziness, so it's highly unlikely that the cat would suddenly become energetic and continue chasing the mouse after running around an empty warehouse. Instead, it's more plausible that the cat will get tired and decide to rest, especially if it's been hunting for a while."
Option A: Neil found the trip stimulating.
"B - Mary felt unappreciated. 
Explanation:  Mary's friends were impressed with her candle-making skills, but they didn't offer to pay her for them or show any interest in buying more. This made Mary feel undervalued and unappreciated for her hard work and talent."
B - Gina disliked spending time with her sister.
B - My plans were ruined, and I went home.
"B - Arnold dumped his girlfriend. 
Explanation:  The fact that Arnold is afraid of cats suggests that he may not be comfortable in environments where there are cats present, which could potentially create tension in a relationship with someone who owns a cat. Additionally, the fact that he visits his girlfriend's house despite being afraid of her pet implies that he may not prioritize his partner's needs or feelings above his own fears. Therefore, it is more likely that Arnold would dump his girlfriend rather than overcome his fear of cats."
B - Leah gets the job.
B) Because I'm a cheapskate it suited me well.
B - Bob decided to stay at a nearby hotel for the night.
B: I began to tremble uncontrollably with terror and dread.
"B - The bat.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that the bat was the object that Maggie's cat brought into her room than that the cat was dead. The fact that the cat brings an object into the room suggests that it may have caught or found something while outside, which in this case would be the bat."
B - Joe was pleased when he put up the new blinds.
Option A: Joey knew everybody was just teasing him.
"B) They then played heads down thumbs up.
Explanation: The story mentions that the teacher instructed the students to hide under their desks after the gunshots rang out. This suggests that the students were in a state of panic and confusion, and may not have been thinking clearly enough to play a game like ""heads down thumbs up."" Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
B) He made sure all of his bills were paid on time.
"B: I am so out of shape I can't even bike a mile. 
Explanation: The protagonist has been working on increasing their endurance, but they have not yet reached their goal of being able to bike thirty miles at once. Therefore, it is more likely that they are still unable to bike a mile than that they have suddenly become able to bike thirty miles."
"B: I decided never to go camping again.
Explanation: Based on the details provided in the story, it seems that the narrator had a negative experience while camping. They mention several mishaps, including their car breaking down, burning their hand while cooking, falling into the lake, and being eaten by bugs. These events may have left the narrator with a bad impression of camping, leading them to decide never to go again. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B: I was sure I would get an A if I didn’t turn in my essay.
B: Sally hopes her boss will keep her.
"B - We decided to sell our candy to a local boutique.
Explanation: The story states that the group ""realized they had greatly overestimated"" how difficult making candy was, which suggests that their initial enthusiasm for the project may have been misplaced. However, instead of giving up or becoming discouraged, they decide to take their homemade candy to market by selling it to a local boutique. This outcome indicates that despite facing challenges, the group remained motivated and determined to succeed in their endeavor."
"B: Will wanted to be a janitor. 
Explanation: The story implies that Will's father is disappointed in Will's behavior, and as a result, Will becomes interested in the job of the school janitor. This suggests that Will may have enjoyed the idea of working in a maintenance role, rather than listening to his teacher. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"B - Emily's parents cheered her on. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Emily's reaction to getting a shot at the doctor's office is unexpected and unpredictable. Her behavior may be seen as disruptive or difficult for both the nurse and other patients in the waiting room. However, instead of being upset with Emily, her parents might try to comfort and encourage her through the experience. They could offer words of praise and support, such as ""Good job, Emily! You're doing great!"" This would suggest that option B is more likely than option A."
"B - We put the gear away and went our separate ways.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that suggests the group continued playing after daylight hours. In fact, it states that they ""went their separate ways,"" which implies that they finished their activity for the day and went home or did something else. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Option B: I decided to quit using the computer. 
Explanation: The story states that every mouse the protagonist found at the store was too expensive, which suggests that they were not able to find an affordable replacement for their broken mouse. Rather than continue searching or consider other alternatives, the protagonist decides to give up on using the computer altogether. This outcome is more likely because it reflects the frustration and disappointment that can arise when something essential breaks and cannot be easily replaced or fixed."
B - It was better for Samantha to be late than to be unprepared.
B - I thought Jack was very rude.
Option B: He polished the wood after he built the desk.
"B - Rick petted the snake happily. 
Explanation: The story states that Rick woke up to a snake in his tent, but instead of being frightened or running away, he ""ran screaming"" from the tent. This implies that Rick was not afraid of the snake and may have even been happy to see it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"B - The recruiter set up an interview for Jerry. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Jerry took action by emailing his resume to the recruiter after finding a desirable job posting. This indicates that he is serious about starting a new career and willing to take steps towards achieving his goal. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, as the recruiter will likely follow up with Jerry to schedule an interview based on his interest in the position."
Option A: Emile eventually got a job as a chef.
B) Ella's family was mad at her the rest of the day.
B - She finished her latest book.
B - Joline decided to take the technician's advice.
"B) Harry was so happy to be in the goo. 
Explanation:  The story states that Harry ""managed to make it all the way through without screaming out loud,"" which suggests that he was able to overcome his fear of haunted houses. Additionally, the fact that they fell through a ""trick floor"" into a ""bunch of goo"" implies that this was a deliberate part of the experience, rather than something frightening or dangerous. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Harry's emotional state upon reaching the end of the haunted house."
Option B: He retired early due to injury.
"B: Joan went to the restaurant the next night. 
Explanation: The fact that Joan returned to the restaurant the next night suggests that she did not feel too badly about leaving without paying. If she had been truly upset by the experience, she might have avoided returning altogether or at least taken some time before deciding to go back. Instead, she seemed willing to give the restaurant another chance, indicating that she may have been more annoyed than actually regretful about her actions."
"B - Jesse's parents were excited to see the tattoo. 
Explanation:  It is more likely that Jesse's parents would be surprised or happy to see their daughter getting a tattoo, especially if they have been opposed to the idea for a long time. Being upset or angry at Jesse's decision might be expected, but excitement seems like a more plausible reaction given the context of the story."
B - Juliette was bored.
"B: Rob was very happy about spending time with Jaclyn. 
Explanation: The story states that Rob ""tried very nice to keep the peace"" and be nice, indicating that he wants to maintain a good relationship with Jaclyn despite their differences. Additionally, the fact that Jaclyn made snide comments and remarks suggests that she may have been trying to provoke or upset Rob, but he remained calm and friendly towards her. Therefore, it is more likely that Rob was happy to spend time with Jaclyn despite any tension between them."
B - Sharon broke all of the eggs.
"B: The slave trader became very famous and rich from his song. 
Explanation:  While it may seem counterintuitive, it is possible for someone who has engaged in morally questionable activities to become successful or even celebrated as a result of their conversion or change of heart. In this case, the slave trader's song could have resonated with people who were also interested in spirituality or personal redemption, and they may have seen him as an inspiring example of someone who had turned his life around. Additionally, the fame and wealth that came to the slave trader through his song could be seen as a form of ""karma"" or cosmic justice, where he is able to experience some measure of success despite his past wrongdoings."
B - Ella was unscathed from the fall.
Option A: Her doctor said she was healthier, too.
Option B: Bobby took time to recover from the injury.
"B) Susan was very happy with the experience. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Susan's use of her cell phone in the theater led to an inconvenience for her (being asked to leave by an usher), but she remained calm and patient throughout the situation. This suggests that Susan has a positive attitude towards unexpected events and can handle them gracefully. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Option A: The cactus flourished under his care.
B - Gina decided that it wasn't late enough and went back outside.
Option A: Avery's parents were proud.
B - The orchids would be beautiful.
Option B: And he started laughing hysterically.
"Option B: Tommy had bad friends. 
Explanation: The fact that Tommy's friends tried to cheer him up by taking him out, despite his initial reluctance, suggests that they may not have been very supportive or caring towards him. Additionally, the fact that he ended up drinking and dancing with them all night implies that he may have felt pressured or coerced into doing things he didn't want to do. This could indicate that Tommy's friends were not good influences on him and may have contributed to his negative mood. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"B: We had a week of hell as her tooth came in. 
Explanation: The story states that Ariel was ""extremely fussy"" and they couldn't figure out why, but later they noticed a fresh tooth coming in. This suggests that the tooth coming in caused discomfort for Ariel, leading to her being fussy. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Amelia decided to vacation to Mexico more often. 
Explanation:  The story states that Amelia ""loved every moment"" of her trip to Mexico, which suggests that she had an enjoyable time. It is unlikely that she would decide not to return to Mexico after having such a positive experience there. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B: We told the kids it was Thanksgiving.
Explanation: The story mentions leaving cookies and milk out for Santa on Christmas Eve, which suggests that the holiday being referred to is Christmas. When the children ask if Santa is real, option B is a plausible response as it would be unusual for someone to leave food out for another person during Thanksgiving. Option A does not make sense in this context as reindeer do not typically eat cookies or milk."
B - She did not want to eat.
"Option B: Kids suffered from the computer labs. 
Explanation: While it's possible that the computer lab could have been successful, there are many factors that could contribute to kids suffering as a result of having access to technology in schools. For example, excessive screen time can lead to eye strain, headaches, and poor posture, among other issues. Additionally, overreliance on technology can hinder critical thinking skills and creativity. It's also worth considering that not all students may have equal access to or proficiency with technology, which could create unequal learning opportunities."
B - I won the match
"The most likely outcome in this situation is Option B, ""the kid is very proud of himself."" This is because Ben's attempt to help the child by giving him advice and things to work on for next season may have come across as condescending or dismissive, leading the child to feel unmotivated or discouraged rather than inspired to improve. It is more likely that the child would be proud of themselves if they were able to make the team despite the challenges they faced, rather than feeling defeated or demotivated after being cut from the team."
B: Officer Dunn was shocked about what his dog had done.
B - He made the best sandwich in town.
"B - Changed the Wi-Fi Password.
Explanation: The story does not provide any details about cleaning a motorcycle or changing a Wi-Fi password. It only mentions driving a motorcycle across the street and doing some laps at a riding track before returning home. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"B - Ryan got promoted.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Ryan getting fired. In fact, it suggests the opposite, as he spent the day playing with birds in the park with his friend rather than going to work. It is more likely that Ryan's actions were seen as relaxing or taking a break, rather than being disciplined for skipping work. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - The man kept driving for a few more hours. 
Explanation: 
The story does not provide any information that would suggest the man stopped at the rest stop. In fact, it explicitly states that he took the exit for the rest stop, which implies that he continued driving after passing the rest stop. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Josiah rolled over and played with his feet.
B) I drove home with the mini pig in my car.
Option A: All his classmates were very supportive though.
"B - Matt was miserable at the turn of events.
Explanation:  The story states that Matt has a big crush on Lexy, but is too afraid to ask her out. When he finally musters up the courage to do so, it's likely that he will feel nervous or anxious about how she will react. If Lexy says yes, Matt may still feel uneasy or unsure about how things will go with her. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for this story."
B - Shyanne was overjoyed.
B - John devoured his pizza.
"B - He received many awards for his dance performances. 
Explanation: The story states that the judges were impressed with Jill's performance, which suggests that he did well in the audition. It is unlikely that the judges would forget about him or not give him any recognition after being impressed by his dance skills. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
B) We ran in hopes of improving our speed.
B - So she bought a new cell phone.
"B) I carelessly threw my used Kleenix in the gutter. 
Explanation:  The option chosen is (B) because it provides an explanation as to why the bicycle might break while being shared by two people. Throwing a used tissue into the gutter could be seen as a thoughtless or careless action, which aligns with the idea that the speaker was not careful enough when sharing their bicycle with someone else."
"B - They couldn't wait to see Grandma!
Explanation:  Based on the context provided, it seems that the family is eagerly anticipating seeing their grandmother after a long drive. Option A suggests that they might decide to turn back, which doesn't align with this expectation. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Option A: Ana decided never to wait that long again.
"B: Mark has a court date next week. 
Explanation: 
Theft, or shoplifting, is a crime punishable by law. As such, it is highly unlikely that the worker would simply thank Mark for his actions. Instead, Mark will likely face legal consequences, including appearing in court. Therefore, option B is the more realistic outcome for this scenario."
"Option B: But in a moment, I'm going to start the puzzle. 
Explanation: The speaker has not started the puzzle yet despite having received it as a Christmas gift. They mention that they have been putting off starting it due to various reasons such as talking with the listener, indicating that they are unlikely to start the puzzle immediately. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
B - He feels better about his room.
B - Failed my exam.
B - It was our favorite picture of the vacation.
B - Wore the blue shirt
"Option A: He fell asleep. 
Explanation: The story states that JJ was tired after playing all day and nearly fell asleep in his bath. This suggests that he will eventually fall asleep when his mother puts him in pajamas and sings to him. Therefore, option A is the most likely ending to the story."
"B - It was then that they knew they were in the right spot. 
Explanation:  In this story, the appearance of the deer provides evidence that the hunters are indeed in the right location for hunting. This suggests that option B is more likely than option A, as it aligns better with the narrative context provided."
"B - Todd decides to study as much as he can before tomorrow. 
Explanation:  The correct answer is option B because it aligns with human nature. Most people would choose to study rather than be unprepared for an important test, especially when it accounts for such a large percentage of their overall grade. Therefore, it is more likely that Todd will decide to study in order to prepare for the test."
"Option B: Maggie wanted to be alone. 
Explanation:  In this story, Maggie initially expresses a desire for a new friend but then ends up spending every day with her new friend. This suggests that Maggie may not have actually wanted a new friend after all, but rather was feeling lonely and sought out social interaction as a way to alleviate those feelings. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B - When the ride was over, we parted ways. 
Explanation:  In this story, it's mentioned that the narrator and their roommate rode to work together, but when the ride was over, they parted ways. This suggests that the two individuals were not traveling together after reaching their destination, which makes option B the most likely answer. Option A does not make sense in this context because if the narrator didn't have anyone to talk to during the ride, then why would they be riding with their roommate in the first place?"
Option B: She felt better playing with a group of nicer people.
B - Bobby enjoyed the carnival.
B - So I typed the lyrics into Google.
"B: Al felt even lonelier as time went on. 
Explanation:  After Val's death, Al was left alone and feeling lonely without his twin sister by his side. He may have struggled to cope with the loss of someone so important to him, leading to feelings of isolation and sadness. This option best captures the emotional impact that losing a loved one can have on someone."
"B - I now drive at a normal speed.
Explanation: The speaker mentions that they got three speeding tickets as a teenager, which suggests that they were driving recklessly or too fast for their age. However, in the present day, they mention that they no longer drive at an excessive speed, indicating that they have learned from their past mistakes and now drive safely. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
B - He has a great time in Oregon
B) She couldn't wait to get her braces tightened each visit.
"B - Jayne decided to set fire to the garden and destroy the farm.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Jayne enjoyed helping with the farm or was satisfied with her experience. Instead, it implies that she may have had negative feelings towards the farm and its owner by mentioning that she ""helped"" care for the animals and harvest the vegetables. This could be interpreted as an act of revenge or resentment, which is consistent with setting fire to the garden and destroying the farm."
"B - Seth thinks it is a good idea to update his resume.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Seth is faced with unexpected news of the factory closing, which means he will need to find new employment. Rather than hoping to find another job at the same factory, Seth recognizes the importance of updating his resume to increase his chances of finding suitable employment elsewhere. This choice reflects Seth's practical thinking and proactive approach to dealing with an unexpected situation."
B - Amy had to walk to school.
"B - Rod was proud of what he had done. 
Explanation:  The fact that Rod's apartment caught on fire suggests that he may have been careless or reckless with his smoking habits, which could lead him to be proud of his actions rather than regretful or deadly. Additionally, the fact that he fell asleep while watching TV also suggests that he may not have been paying attention to his surroundings, further supporting the idea that he would be proud of his actions rather than regretful."
"Option B: Barry turned around and went home. 
Explanation:  The fact that Barry had already decided on who he will vote for, suggests that he may not have been undecided or open-minded about it. Therefore, option B which states ""Barry turned around and went home"" is more likely as it implies that he didn't bother to go through with voting because he already made up his mind."
"B) They fixed it and Johnny drove home. 
Explanation: The story states that Johnny had to put on the spare tire and drive to a repair shop, indicating that he did not fix the flat tire at the side of the road. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Amy signed a lease and moved into the apartment.
B) I ate a hamburger.
"Option B: May went outside and Cathy never saw her again. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about May's behavior or personality before she went outside. It only states that Cathy fell in love with May at first sight, which suggests that May may have been friendly and affectionate towards people. However, since the story does not provide any additional details about May's character, it is possible that May could have escaped or run away after sensing an opportunity. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
B) Monica knit the scarf to donate to an orphanage.
"B - No one seemed to notice the suspect. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, the suspect has managed to open the locked cell door without being detected by anyone at the police station. It's unlikely that the suspect would then decide to turn themselves in, as they have already taken steps to escape. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
"Option A: But eventually they get together anyway. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the couple's desire for happiness and their love for each other ultimately overcomes any obstacles or opposition from their parents. They may try to keep their relationship secretive at first, but as time goes on, they realize that it's impossible to hide their true feelings forever. Eventually, they decide to be open about their relationship and pursue their happiness together, despite any initial disapproval from their parents. This option is more likely because it aligns with human nature and societal norms, where individuals often prioritize their own happiness above all else."
Option B: I was completely bored.
Option A: Jake had a great time at the football game with his dad.
"B - I decided to visit Vegas. 
Explanation: The story mentions looking for something ""cheap"" to do, which suggests that the protagonist does not have a lot of money to spend on leisure activities. Visiting Las Vegas, known for its casinos and expensive shows, is unlikely to be a budget-friendly option. On the other hand, going swimming at a local lake beach is a more affordable activity. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B: Amy got an A on the paper but in trouble for skipping class.
"B - Steve's wife filed for divorce that same day.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Steve's wife was happy or appreciative of the gift. In fact, it states that she ""had been wanting"" a new desk, which implies that she has been expressing her dissatisfaction with the current one for some time. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B: As if his luck couldn't get any worse, the hospital was closed. 
Explanation: The story suggests that the man's bad luck is not just a coincidence but rather a series of unfortunate events that are happening one after another. Given this context, it is more likely that the hospital will be closed than for him to stop believing in luck altogether."
"B - Jon loved spending time with the kids.
Explanation: The story states that Jon ""felt like a bad dad"" because he works late and misses his kids, but then his son sits on his lap and leans on him. This suggests that Jon does enjoy spending time with his children despite feeling guilty about not being able to spend more time with them due to work."
Option B: Ben went for a run.
"B: Juan was very successful eventually. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Juan has been practicing his craft for some time, and has even managed to get himself added to small shows. This implies that he has been able to make progress towards his goal of becoming a professional wrestler, which means that option B (Juan was very successful eventually) is more likely to be true than option A (Juan decided that being a luchador was a stupid aspiration)."
"B - Tori had to go to therapy because she was so upset. 
Explanation:  
The story states that Tori found out she was pregnant on a Sunday, but it doesn't say how long she had been trying to conceive or if she had previously experienced difficulty getting pregnant. It also doesn't provide any context about why Tori might be upset. Given these limitations, it seems unlikely that Tori would be upset enough to require therapy. Instead, it's more plausible that she and her husband are simply excitedly discussing their future child. Option B provides a more logical explanation for Tori's emotional state than option A does."
"Option B: The food was too unhealthy for Sara. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Sara is on a diet and is trying to eat healthily. Therefore, it is more likely that she would be turned off by the idea of going to an organic juice shop that serves unhealthy drinks, rather than being excited about the possibility of getting food from there."
Option A: They decide to be lab partners in their class together.
"B - Disappointed to receive the Chemistry set.
Explanation: The story states that Tom's mother initially thought the Chemistry set was too dangerous for him, but then changed her mind and got him one anyway. This suggests that Tom had been hoping for the Chemistry set specifically, and was therefore disappointed when he received it instead of the puppy he had requested."
B - I shot the rat and tossed the body into the garbage.
B - Lo had the best costume in the play.
"B - Later, my manager told me he didn't like the Beatles.
Explanation: The story suggests that your manager and you bonded over your shared love for the Beatles. However, it's unlikely that someone would wear a Beatles t-shirt on their first day of work just to deceive their new employee. It's more plausible that your manager genuinely shares your enthusiasm for the band, but later reveals that they don't actually enjoy their music. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Tyler was elated!
B - The dentist was able to make her tooth feel better.
"B: Derek now reads all the time. 
Explanation:  The story states that Derek got a library card, which means he has access to more books than he did before. This implies that he will continue to read regularly."
B - After that we all decided to go to a restaurant.
"B - Buying her a dress that afternoon.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it shows initiative and willingness to take action, rather than simply waiting for her to make the first move. It also demonstrates interest in getting to know her better, which could potentially lead to a romantic connection."
"B - Pat felt silly for pretending to be sick.
Explanation: The story states that Pat called in to work using a fake sick voice, which means he was lying about being sick. When he finds out that work has been cancelled due to snow, he realizes that he was foolish to lie and feels embarrassed or ""silly"" about it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"B - Greg judged the chili cook-off competition.
Explanation: The story does not provide any details that suggest Greg filed a police report or that the thief was caught. In fact, it explicitly states that Greg watched as the thief rode away with his bike. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"B: Johnson was an avid outdoorsman and hiked often.
Explanation: The story states that Johnson's girlfriend teases him about not liking being outdoors, which suggests that she does not believe he would enjoy camping. However, since Johnson decided to prove her wrong by going camping, it is more likely that he actually enjoys spending time outside and hiking. This choice also aligns with the tone of the story, which seems to suggest that Johnson is determined to show his girlfriend that he can handle the challenges of camping."
"B - So, Pete kept the wallet and bought a new TV with the money. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Pete has every reason to keep the wallet and use its contents to buy something he wants. While Jim may be struggling financially, there's no guarantee that he will ever find his wallet or get the money back. By keeping the wallet and using the money to buy something he wants, Pete is taking advantage of an opportunity that has come his way. This outcome is therefore the most likely choice."
"B) Sally felt better.
Explanation:  The story states that Mary ""told her (Sally) that she had many strengths too."" This implies that Mary provided some positive feedback, which helped alleviate Sally's insecurities. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Sally's feelings after this conversation with her sister."
"B - He has a scar from the stitches.
This option is more likely because it aligns with the information provided in the story. The author mentions that their son's eyebrow was cut open and needed stitches, which would result in a scar. Option A is unlikely because the author does not mention anything about their son dying."
"Option A - Lorelei calmed down after getting the teething biscuit. 
Explanation: The story states that Little Lorelei's mother had tried ""everything"" else before giving her a teething biscuit, indicating that nothing else had worked. Therefore, it is most likely that the teething biscuit was able to calm her down."
"B - You ran away from the ducks.
Explanation:  In this story, it says that the ducks ""chased"" after you in an ""angry fashion."" This implies that they were not happy with your presence or actions (i.e., throwing bread) and were aggressively pursuing you. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation."
"B - Eventually he threw it away.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information or context that suggests Graham continued using the selfie stick regularly after the initial excitement wore off. In fact, the passage states that he ""forgot"" about it, which implies that he stopped using it altogether. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Graham's selfie stick adventure."
B: Lewis laughed and told them not to be afraid of the bats.
B - Sara decided to buy a Viola instead.
B - Bill felt relieved.
"B: After a while, everything Martha cooked was delicious. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Martha's cooking improved over time as she practiced and learned from cooking shows. It is unlikely that she suddenly became an expert seamstress (option A) since the story does not provide any indication of this skill development. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B: I took him to the vet to treat him and he got better. 
Explanation:  The story states that Tokyo got very sick ""out of nowhere,"" which suggests that his illness was sudden and unexpected. Taking him to the vet allowed for proper diagnosis and treatment, which is more likely to result in a positive outcome than if he had been left untreated. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B: The carpet looked almost new after it was cleaned.
B - She loved the donut she was eating.
Option A - Anna ate all the wings as she drove home. This option is more likely because it aligns with the context provided in the story about Anna wanting chicken wings and driving far away to get them. It also makes sense that she would want to enjoy her food while on the road rather than saving it for later.
B) I agreed to let my brother use the remote first.
"B - Ivy was glad she had chosen to fly. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Ivy's life is in danger due to the plane's malfunction. However, instead of feeling relieved that the plane corrected its course, she is glad she chose to fly. This suggests that Ivy values the experience of flying and enjoying the view from up high, even if it means facing potential dangers. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice for how Ivy would feel in this situation."
"B: Joey wished his parents appreciated him.
Explanation:  The story states that Joey's parents thought he was an artist, but it also mentions that they only hung up his artwork on the fridge ""for everyone to admire."" This implies that while they may have been impressed by Joey's creativity, they didn't necessarily appreciate or value his artistic abilities. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome as Joey wishes his parents would show more appreciation for his talents."
"B - John reworked the presentation, and it was a great success. 
Explanation: The story suggests that John lacks preparation for his client presentation, specifically regarding the content's polish. Option A, bringing bagels to work, does not address this issue directly. Option B, on the other hand, provides a solution by allowing John to rework the presentation, which increases its chances of being successful. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
B - Fred had won the lottery.
B - So she had to settle for rinsing her hands off.
"B - The family sat down, and enjoyed a meal together. 
Explanation:  Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that the family would sit down and enjoy a meal together after Mother rang the bell than for her to yell at them to get back to work. This is because the story has established that Mother is happy when the family arrives home, and there is no indication that she would be angry or upset with them for taking a break to eat."
B - Emmy left angry because she wanted a dog.
B - Jill frequently ate lima beans.
"Option B: Jerry threw his guitar in the trash. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any information about Jerry's motivations or emotions after he becomes a ""reasonably good"" guitar player. It simply states that he became a good player without providing any context or detail about what happened next. Therefore, it is more likely that Jerry got bored with playing the guitar or lost interest in it altogether than that he continued to play it for his friends. Throwing the guitar away would be an extreme action that suggests Jerry no longer cared about the instrument or the skill he had acquired."
"B: Kyle thought Superman was a ridiculous construct. 
Explanation:  The fact that Kyle goes around collecting action figures every day suggests that he has a strong interest in superheroes and comic book characters. Option A does not fit with this information as it implies that Kyle only collects Marvel heroes, which would limit his interests too much. On the other hand, option B fits well with the information provided since Superman is often seen as a classic and iconic superhero character who may be considered ""ridiculous"" by some people who are more critical of traditional superhero tropes. Therefore, based on the information given in the passage, option B is the most likely answer."
"Option A: Francine was glad that she wore comfortable shoes! 
Explanation: The story states that Francine ""hated how (high heels) felt,"" indicating that she prefers wearing comfortable shoes. Therefore, option A is the most likely ending to the story."
"B: People were very happy when I played this game without them.
Explanation: The story suggests that the speaker enjoyed playing ""hide and sneak"" and jumping out at people, which implies that they found joy in surprising and scaring others. This contradicts Option A, as it does not explain why the speaker had to stop doing something they enjoyed. Instead, Option B provides a more plausible explanation by suggesting that the speaker's actions made others happy, which further supports their enjoyment of the activity."
B - Rachel took it to a language professor for translation.
"B - She got the job.
Explanation:  In this story, it is more likely that Deb will get the job because her husband is setting her up with an interview there. This suggests that he has faith in her abilities and thinks she would be a good fit for the position. Additionally, the fact that he is willing to help her find a new job shows that he is supportive of her and wants to see her succeed."
Option B: She felt better about herself.
B - Close her eyes and do her best to go to sleep.
Option A: He bought lemonade and made us feel welcome in the neighborhood.
"B: The navigation system helped Bob a lot. 
Explanation:  In this story, Bob moves from a small town to a large city and becomes concerned about getting lost. To address this concern, he purchases a navigation system. This suggests that Bob did not know his way around the city before acquiring the navigation system, as he felt the need for it in the first place. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, as the navigation system helps Bob navigate the city better."
"B: Kelly remembered when her grandmother showed her the flowers. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Kelly saw pictures of ligers online, which suggests that she was learning about them through a digital source (e.g., images or videos). This contrasts with the second option, where Kelly's grandmother shows her flowers, implying an offline, personal interaction. Therefore, option B is more likely to be true."
Option A: Jorie admitted it was a very emotional tour.
B - Clara's mom helped right away.
"B - I was very happy about the letter.
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist found an old letter from his girlfriend underneath some clutter, which indicates that he hasn't seen or heard from her in a while. Given this context, it is more likely that the protagonist will be happy to see the letter rather than angry or confused because it confirms his suspicion that their relationship has ended."
The most likely outcome of Ben’s actions is option B, “His wife found out and they got a divorce.” This is because having an affair can often lead to significant emotional distress and betrayal for the partner who finds out, which may ultimately result in the end of the relationship. While it is possible that Ben’s wife could be understanding or even supportive of his decision to seek happiness outside of their marriage (option A), it is more likely that she would feel hurt, angry, or confused by his actions, leading to the breakdown of their relationship.
"B - The man wanted to lose his bet.
Explanation:  In this story, the man tried to outstare a duck but failed when the duck's nictitating membrane (third eyelid) helped protect its eyes from the prolonged staring. Since the man lost the bet, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B: Shay really didn't like dolphins.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Shay enjoyed the experience of swimming with dolphins. In fact, it states that she ""jumped in the pool,"" which implies that she may have been hesitant or unwilling to participate in the activity. Additionally, the fact that she paid $40 for the experience suggests that she may not have been enthusiastic about it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Lia took many photos of Stonehenge.
B - I left the mess and made a sandwich.
B - Ordered Another Round
Option A: Hester is proud of her appearance.
B - Jill was depressed.
"B - Jaden had saved the day.
Explanation:  The story states that Jaden's girlfriend ""came home"" after finding the flowers and chocolate, indicating that she was pleased with his thoughtful gesture. It is unlikely that she would slap him in the face as a reaction to this action. Instead, it is more probable that she will be happy or impressed by his effort, which is what happens in option B."
B - He realized biking was not for him, and took a nap instead.
"B - Quentin vowed to never go sailing again. 
Explanation: The story states that Quentin had never been on a boat before and that it was an exhilarating experience. However, after experiencing the thrill of sailing, Quentin decides that he will never do it again. This suggests that the experience may have been too intense or overwhelming for him, causing him to want to avoid it in the future. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - The cook decided to remake the pancakes.
"B - We adopted the black lab and took her home. 
Explanation: The story states that ""upon arriving"" at the animal shelter, the family met a black lab they all immediately liked. This suggests that the decision to adopt the dog had already been made before even entering the shelter. Additionally, the language used in the story implies that the adoption process was positive and straightforward, leading one to believe that option B (adopting the dog) is the more likely outcome."
"B - I didn't water them again.
Explanation: The story states that your friend found out that the plants needed more water, but it doesn't say that you actually gave them more water. Therefore, it's more likely that you didn't water them again, which is option B."
B - Jill got better at video games.
Option B: Then I imagined that I was Buffy and went running.
"B - His mother was very angry.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Drew's mother will be angry with him for breaking into her house and damaging her belongings. It is not uncommon for parents to become upset when they discover their children engaging in illegal or destructive behavior, especially if it involves harming property. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome in this scenario."
Option A: The baked eggs were great.
"B - Angry
Explanation:  In this story, the boy's archenemy (who threw the spitball) has a history of causing trouble for the protagonist. Therefore, it is more likely that the boy will be angry at being targeted by his enemy rather than grateful for finding money."
"Option B: Hector is happy that both ears work. 
Explanation: In this story, Hector is initially frustrated with only one ear working on his headphones. However, once he purchases a new pair of headphones, he is happy that both ears work properly. This suggests that Hector values being able to hear music clearly through both ears, rather than simply giving up on music altogether. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Hector's story."
B - Tom thought it was the best hockey game ever.
"B: Trip stopped eating watermelon completely. 
Explanation: The story states that Trip's mother told him he would grow a tree swallowing seeds if he ate enough watermelon, but it does not say anything about Trip enjoying the taste of the seeds or continuing to eat watermelon after his mother's warning. Therefore, it is more likely that Trip stopped eating watermelon altogether rather than continuing to enjoy the seeds."
"B: Angie tried to discuss the issue in detail. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Angie wants to understand why her work wasn't up to par and how she can improve it. She takes a proactive approach by reaching out to the requester and asking for specific feedback. This shows that Angie values learning and improving, rather than simply getting angry or defensive when faced with rejection."
B - Trina's dad taught her how to dance.
"B - His dad taught him how to ride it. 
Explanation: In this story, Andy received a new bike on his birthday but didn't know how to ride it. Option B states that his father taught him how to ride it, which is the most likely outcome given the context of the story. It makes sense that Andy's father would want to help his son learn how to ride the bike he just got him as a gift."
B) He gave her the milkshake for free.
B) He bought more cotton candy for the boy.
B - Sebastian walked outdoors and went for a walk.
B - His brother was grateful.
Option A: She wondered if the cashier had stolen her information.
B - I purchased it and brought it home.
B - I received the promotion I wanted.
B - Maggie liked the new town.
"B - Dan's mother told him to get ready for school.
Explanation: The story states ""When Dan got home"" which implies that Dan has already arrived at home, and therefore it is unlikely that his mother would give him the train as a surprise. It is more likely that she would tell him to get ready for school, which is what option B suggests."
"B - Then Gina told her mom where the key was. 
Explanation:  
In this scenario, Gina has already taken the key without permission, so it makes sense that she would also tell her mom where it is. This way, her mom can find the key easily and Gina won't get in trouble for hiding it. Option A does not make sense because if Gina just put the purse back where she found it, her mom might still notice that the key is missing and investigate further."
"B - The man moved to Kentucky.
Explanation:  In this story, the man loves someone who lives in Louisiana, but instead of moving to Louisiana, he decides to move to Kentucky. This is the most likely outcome because it is more practical for him to move closer to where she already lives rather than moving further away. Additionally, Kentucky is located near Louisiana, making it easier for them to visit each other regularly."
B: Tim was terribly disappointed.
B) She took the cat home with her.
B - I got up and got right back on the balance beam.
"B - We did not like the dogs. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it's unlikely that all six puppies would appeal equally to your daughters, especially since they are each picking out their own individual dog. Therefore, it's more likely that at least some of them will not be interested in any of the available puppies, leading to option B being the most likely outcome."
"B - Johnny was happy to be in a small town.
Explanation: The story states that Johnny wanted a change from his big city life in Boston and decided to move to Idaho, which is a much smaller state than Boston. This implies that Johnny preferred the slower pace of life in a small town rather than the fast-paced environment of a large city like Boston. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"B: Joan felt good at seeing her mother's face. 
Explanation: The story does not suggest that Joan's mother judges or criticizes her for being single, so option A is unlikely. Instead, the story implies that Joan feels relieved and cared for by her mother's presence after the car accident, which aligns with option B."
B - I went on many dates.
"B) My wife and I had dinner that night. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any details about what happened during the field trip, so it is unlikely that my daughter would have forgotten anything from the experience. Additionally, the fact that the author's wife went along as a chaperone suggests that they were both present at the same location, making it more likely that they had dinner together that night rather than separately."
B - The bouncer did not allow us into the club.
B - Loved the way the glass looked now.
"Option B: They decided they didn't need it anyway, and moved. 
Explanation: This option is more likely because if a tornado damaged their home, it would be unlikely that they would choose to stay in the same location without making any repairs. Instead, they might decide to move to a safer place after such an event."
B: That helped her find what she wanted.
B: Sebastian was happy that his practice paid off.
"Option A: The mother gently sang the lullaby to her baby. 
Explanation: In this story, the mother is desperate for her baby to sleep, so she remembers the lullaby that her own mother used to sing to her. This suggests that the mother values tradition and familiarity when it comes to calming her baby down, rather than trying something new or unconventional like playing hip hop music. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"B: Everyone was really happy because of Johnny's behavior. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any evidence that Johnny's actions were harmful or disruptive, so it is unlikely that anyone would have gotten upset with him for peeing in the wading pool. In fact, it is possible that some people might find it amusing or endearing that Johnny is still engaging in this childish behavior as an adult. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B - Amy felt terrible.
Explanation: In this story, Amy feels left out when she watches the other kids play and can't join in because of her asthma. When her art teacher gives her encouragement, it makes her feel worse instead of better because it highlights how different she is from the other kids. This suggests that Amy may already be feeling self-conscious or embarrassed about her condition, and the teacher's words only serve to reinforce those feelings. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"B - Joe was very disappointed in his team.
Explanation: The story states that Joe was ""nervous"" about winning or losing the game, which suggests that he did not expect his team to perform well. Therefore, it is more likely that Joe was disappointed in his team's performance rather than proud of it."
Option A: Mark was very happy.
B - Elaine found it difficult to make up her mind.
Option A
"B - Matt did not care about the missing phone. 
Explanation:  The story states that Matt got too drunk and lost his phone. However, instead of being concerned or worried about losing his phone, Matt simply didn't care. This suggests that he was so intoxicated that he wasn't thinking clearly or worrying about important things like his phone. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Option B: Bindu hates her friends and parties. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that suggests everyone had a good time or that Bindu enjoyed herself. In fact, it states that one of Bindu's friends brought samosas and doogh, which are traditional Indian snacks, suggesting that the party was focused on Indian culture. Additionally, the fact that four friends played music at the party implies that it was a small gathering, which could have been uncomfortable for Bindu if she did not enjoy socializing with her friends. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Tyler takes a quick shower and gets to the bus stop on time.
"B - His doctor was very pleased at his next checkup.
Explanation:  The story states that Thomas started eating healthier and going on walks, which suggests that he made positive changes in his lifestyle. Since his doctor was pleased at his next checkup, it is likely that Thomas's efforts to improve his health have been successful. Option A is unlikely because there is no indication in the story that Thomas gained forty pounds or developed diabetes."
"B) She screamed and pushed her brother away. 
Explanation: The story suggests that the girl in the scenario is startled by her brother's sudden appearance, which makes sense given that he ""leaped out"" at her unexpectedly. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, as it aligns with the narrative of the story. Option A does not fit well with the context, as watching a comedy show would not be an appropriate response to being startled by someone jumping out at her."
B: Stephanie could not get up until someone found her.
"B - Roy threw out the old fish, and everything smelled better. 
Explanation: In this story, the source of the bad smell was identified as an old fish in the refrigerator. Option B is the more logical choice because throwing out the old fish would eliminate the bad smell. Leaving the fish in the refrigerator (Option A) would not solve the problem, as the smell would still come from the rotting fish."
"B - Jimmy called his parents and cursed at them.
Explanation:  The story states that Jimmy's parents ""worked two jobs"" to afford his college education, which suggests that they may have had limited financial resources. It is unlikely that Jimmy would be able to repay them for their sacrifices in full, especially given that he was already financially stable after graduating from college. Therefore, option B (Jimmy calling his parents and cursing at them) is more likely as it shows a lack of gratitude and respect towards his parents who made great sacrifices for him."
B - Jill and her friends had a fun girls-only night out.
"B - The old woman was delighted to find the fur coat. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it's more likely that the old woman would be happy to find something valuable like a fur coat rather than refusing to give it back. She may appreciate the unexpected surprise and decide to keep it for herself or use it to sell for some extra money. On the other hand, if she were to refuse to give it back, there might be more conflict involved in retrieving the banner."
"B: I made pumpkin bars later in life and they reminded me of my mom.
Explanation:  In this story, the narrator mentions that their mother had a recipe for pumpkin bars that she liked, and that eating those bars helped the narrator feel better when they were having a bad day. This suggests that the narrator enjoyed the pumpkin bars and associates them with positive memories of their mother's care and attention. It is therefore more likely that the narrator would make pumpkin bars themselves later in life as a way of connecting with those memories and feeling closer to their mother."
"B - Tim and his grandad found a hobby that they both enjoyed. 
Explanation: The story states that Tim became really interested in birdwatching after spending time with his grandfather. This suggests that Tim enjoyed the activity and found it enjoyable to do together with his grandfather. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B) He refused to give him another scoop.
"B: Gina thanked Tami the next day.
Explanation: The story states that ""Gina thanked Tami the next day."" This implies that Gina had a positive reaction to the situation, rather than feeling lonely or unhappy (option A)."
"B - Laurence put all of their belongings back into the house.
Explanation: The story states that ""all their belongings were moved into the van,"" which implies that they have already moved out of their old home. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"B - So she brought one home and gave it to her crab. 
Explanation: The story states ""She scoured the beach all morning"" which implies that Joy searched extensively for the perfect shell. Since everything that might work was broken, it's unlikely that she would give up and buy a new shell without finding something suitable first. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Westin and his wife kicked out the intoxicated person.
B - Joe was angry he got hurt.
"B - Todd opened up the bag and spread the leaves around. 
Explanation:  In this story, Todd has just finished raking his yard full of leaves. It would be unlikely for him to then take the same leaves and put them back into a bag before putting them in the trash. Instead, it makes more sense that he would want to get rid of them by spreading them around. This way, they will decompose and add nutrients to the soil rather than taking up space in a landfill."
Option A: Tim was very determined.
B - Henry was happy and thankful.
"B - All the players were good but she made the team. 
Explanation:  The story states that Tami had not anticipated how good the other players would be, indicating that they are also skilled. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome where Tami makes the team despite being one of the best players at tryouts."
"Option B: The glue held the vase together and their mom never found out. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bob and Jim successfully glued the vase back together without getting caught by their mother. Since they took the time to fix the vase, their mother will probably not notice that it was broken in the first place. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
B) Steve drove an hour away to go to a strip joint for drugs.
"B - Gloria's husband appreciated the gesture.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Gloria's decision to pick her own flowers led to problems in her marriage. In fact, it suggests the opposite, as she ""got together"" with her husband to create something special for him. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
B) He made the most shots and won the contest.
"Option B: She was jealous. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Lauren's hard work and dedication to her fitness goals have paid off, resulting in her being able to wear skinny jeans that make her feel confident and stylish. However, instead of feeling proud or satisfied with her accomplishment, she becomes jealous of others who can also wear skinny jeans without any effort. This suggests that Lauren may be more focused on external validation than internal fulfillment, which could lead to unhealthy behaviors such as overexercising or comparing oneself to others."
"B - Hawaii was not a good place to travel to. 
Explanation: The story states that it took 9 hours to fly to Hawaii, which suggests that it is far away from where the narrator lives. Additionally, the fact that the narrator's entire band class is going implies that they are on an organized trip, rather than independently traveling. This makes it less likely that the narrator would want to go back to Hawaii more often."
B - Sonny decided to jump into his pool.
"B - Instead of laughing, everyone applauded when Chad finally sang.
Explanation: The story suggests that Chad has a fear of singing in front of others due to his perceived lack of talent. However, it also implies that he has a genuine passion for singing. If Option A were true, it would mean that Chad decided to pursue a career in stand-up comedy instead of singing, which doesn't align with the information provided in the story. On the other hand, if Option B were true, it would suggest that Chad's friends and fellow choir members are supportive and encouraging, rather than mocking or dismissive, which could help alleviate his fears and encourage him to share his talents with them."
"B: His eyes glowed with excitement. 
Explanation: The story does not suggest that Ronald has any negative feelings towards having another child. In fact, it implies quite the opposite - he is excited about the upcoming arrival of their third child."
"B - Followed the road back to my car.
Explanation: The fact that the speaker ""screamed"" and ""ran all the way back to the main road"" suggests that they were frightened by the sight of the snake. This implies that they are not a biologist or someone familiar with snakes, as they would not have been afraid of it. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"B - Mary kept driving and drank it anyway. 
Explanation:  It's more likely that Mary would keep driving and drink the incorrect coffee, rather than crashing into a pole. People often make mistakes when ordering food or drinks at fast food restaurants, and they may not notice until they are already on their way. In this case, Mary was in a hurry and didn't want to waste time going back to correct her order, so she probably just continued driving and drank the wrong coffee."
"Option A: Bill made a lot of friends that day. 
Explanation: The story states that Bill ""had a lot of fun hanging out with them,"" which suggests that he formed positive connections with his coworkers and possibly even made new friends. This outcome is more likely than Option B, where Bill is upset at his coworkers, as there is no indication in the story that anything negative happened."
Option B: He was so depressed, he became an alcoholic.
B) Quinton was so happy.
B - Igor took a cold shower.
Option A: Tara still enjoyed listening on her own!
"B - We left the White House abruptly and did not take the tour. 
Explanation: The story states that the speaker's boyfriend took her to the White House, but it does not mention anything about taking a tour. It is more likely that they simply visited the building without going on an official tour."
"B - She wanted to play the drums.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that a one-year-old child would hate music. Babies are known to be drawn to rhythmic sounds and movements from an early age, so it's more plausible that the child was excited to try out the new drum set. Additionally, the fact that the child lived in NYC suggests that they were exposed to various forms of music and cultural influences, which could have further piqued their interest in playing instruments. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Maggie gave up the piano. 
Explanation:  The fact that Maggie was ""shaking"" when she got on stage suggests that she may have been experiencing performance anxiety, which can be a common experience for musicians, especially beginners. If Maggie was already feeling anxious before she even started playing, it's possible that she may have felt overwhelmed and discouraged by her inability to control her nerves. In this case, option B (Maggie gave up the piano) is the most likely outcome."
"B) Ed regretted falling asleep.
Explanation: The story states that Ed ""fell asleep before it ended,"" which implies that he missed the end of the movie. This means that he will probably regret not being able to see the entire film, so option B is the more likely outcome."
"Option B: I regret signing up. 
Explanation: The story states that the person ""went in this morning and signed up for the plan,"" which implies that they have already completed the action of signing up. However, the ending indicates that they now regret their decision, suggesting that something negative has happened as a result of their actions. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
B) They all enjoyed the meal.
B - Ryan decided his job was rather dull.
B: Johnny told the teacher he was upset he didn't get more colors.
"B) Tim was satisfied.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Tim is gay, so option A can be ruled out. Option B is the most likely choice because it implies that Tim made a rational decision based on his own preferences rather than being influenced by external factors such as social pressure or expectations from others."
"B - Jill was glad she did not bring Joe. 
Explanation:  The fact that Joe was unable to find the Geocache suggests that he may not have been interested in the activity, which could have made the experience less enjoyable for Jill if she had brought him. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Option B: Ella then became a star piano player. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Ella had access to a high-quality instrument, but she failed to practice and improve her skills. However, it also implies that despite this initial disadvantage, Ella has the potential to become a star pianist through hard work and dedication. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
B - Dave bought it and enjoyed his purchase.
B) Rose shielded her face from the wind.
"B) Drew had to start typing the paper over again.
Explanation: In this scenario, Drew fell asleep while typing, which resulted in accidental keystrokes being pressed. Since he cannot erase the mistakes, he will have to retype the entire document from scratch. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Sarah loved her new telescope.
B) She decided to put a rug over the stain.
"B) He sat down at the table with us, and we all had drinks. 
This option is more likely because it is less dramatic than Option A. It also does not fit the tone of the rest of the passage, which describes a dangerous situation involving domestic violence. Additionally, it is unlikely that someone who has just broken into your home would sit down for drinks without any explanation or warning."
"B - My parents were going to live separate lives.
Explanation: The passage states that ""they decided to end things amicably,"" which implies that they are no longer living together. Additionally, the author mentions being ""hurt"" by their decision, suggesting that they are not on good terms. Given these details, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
B - The new baby was a girl.
"B) Monica could not explain why her friend had stolen the doritos.
Explanation: In this story, Monica's friend stole the Doritos despite being dared to do so. This means that Monica cannot explain why her friend took something without permission, which is illegal and unethical behavior. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation."
Option A: Finally, Ray asked his friend if he had a spare toothbrush.
B - Ellie decided to skip school the next day because she was ahead.
Option A: He named it Don's Comics.
"B: The bat flew directly toward the source of the scream. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it's more likely that the bat will fly towards the source of the noise, which in this case is Arnold. This is because bats are attracted to loud noises and may investigate them. Additionally, since Arnold is scared of bats, he may have unintentionally provoked the bat by making a lot of noise while taking a shower. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Annabelle was very offended. 
Explanation: 
In this scenario, Mary asking Annabelle to join her band without first consulting or asking permission from Annabelle's parents may have been perceived as disrespectful or invasive. It is possible that Annabelle felt uncomfortable with the sudden request and decided to express her offense towards Mary. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the situation."
B - They gave him the antidote which saved his life.
Option A: Sean decided to go to a shelter.
B) The two hobos ate their cheeseburgers.
B - Very Prepared.
"B) Sal's leg eventually healed. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information to suggest that Sal was furious with his wife (Option A). In fact, it states that she ""waited on him hand and foot,"" which suggests that she was being very attentive and caring towards him. Additionally, the phrase ""eventually healed"" implies that Sal's leg injury did in fact heal over time, which further supports this answer choice."
"B - Rebecca and Jake both auditioned for the musical. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Jake's family moving back next to Rebecca. In fact, it specifically states that Jake's family moved away when they were 13 years old, which means they have been living in a different location for at least five years by the time the story takes place. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B - Both groups had a great time seeing the movies they wanted.
"B - Amy was surprised that she did a good job. 
Explanation:  In this story, Amy has never surfed before but the instructor was patient with her. It is unlikely that Amy would suddenly decide to go swimming without even trying to surf first. Therefore option B is more likely as it shows that Amy had finally gotten the hang of it after some effort and was pleasantly surprised by how well she did."
B - Kay used the raft for firewood.
"B: Max's teacher's praised his creativity. 
Explanation:  The passage states that Max had ""vivid imaginations"" and that he would often find himself ""lost in thought."" This suggests that Max has a creative mind and is able to think outside of the box. Additionally, the fact that he struggles in school but receives praise from his teachers implies that they recognize and value his creativity over his academic performance. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
"Option B: She realized how boring his life was. 
Explanation:  In this story, Gina watches as friends make remarks and tell stories about her grandfather, which gives her a new perspective on him. However, instead of finding him more interesting or memorable, she realizes that his life was actually quite dull. This suggests that Gina had an overly idealized view of her grandfather beforehand, and now has a more nuanced understanding of who he really was."
B - Ashley went home and went to bed to get better.
B - Her mom gave her an alarm clock.
B - Joe was grateful and then went to work.
B - Lizzy needed help to get the bananas down.
B - I had a great time!
"Option B: Bryan went home relieved. 
Explanation: In this story, Bryan's condition is caused by a treatable medical issue (poison ivy). When he goes to see the doctor, he receives treatment that will help alleviate his symptoms and make him feel better. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Bryan's situation."
"B: The games were very close. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Tony and Mark are evenly matched opponents. The fact that they are able to play one-on-one every day without a clear winner suggests that neither of them has a significant advantage over the other. Therefore, option B, ""The games were very close,"" is the most likely outcome."
"B - Her friends suggested she should sell the candy at a bake sale. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it seems that Becky and her friends enjoyed making the candy bars and were proud of their creation. It's likely that they would want to share their hard work with others by selling the candy at a bake sale or other event. This option provides a positive outcome for the story and aligns with the tone established earlier."
Option B: She went home and ate 3 cartons of ice cream.
B) Rachelle became depressed.
Option B: Wendy does not like apples.
Option B: Bill was sad to see the sucker covered with dirt on the ground.
B - Neil enjoyed visiting Transylvania.
B - Sadly, the new video game was disappointing.
"B - The stunt man loved it. 
Explanation:  Stunt men are trained professionals who perform dangerous stunts for movies and television shows. They knowingly take risks every day, so it's unlikely that they would be seriously injured or paralyzed during a stunt gone wrong. In fact, many stunt men enjoy the thrill of performing high-risk stunts and may even find them exhilarating. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome in this scenario."
"B: Pamela decided to break up with Ralph. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Ralph does not treat Pamela well. He shows no interest in listening to her or being punctual, and he flirts with other girls without regard for Pamela's feelings. Given these behaviors, it is likely that Pamela will decide to end their relationship rather than continue to tolerate his disrespectful treatment."
"B) Helen dreaded seeing outerspace. 
Explanation:  The wording of the passage suggests that Helen worked hard to achieve her goal of becoming an astronaut, but now that she has achieved it, she may be feeling apprehensive or nervous about actually going into space. This could be due to a fear of heights, claustrophobia, or other reasons. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Helen's story."
"B: I packed all my stuff up again. 
Explanation: The story states that it took the protagonist ""over 8 hours"" to move their belongings into their new apartment, which suggests that they had a significant amount of stuff to move. However, the story does not provide any information about why the protagonist would need to pack their belongings up again. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
B: Hailey cried to think that she would not see her friends.
"B: It is a fond memory.
Explanation: The story mentions Maybelle's breath always smelling like peppermints, which suggests that she was someone who enjoyed chewing them frequently. This detail creates a warm and comforting image, implying that Maybelle was a kind and pleasant person. Additionally, the narrator's decision to keep peppermints in their cupboards years after Maybelle's passing indicates that they have positive associations with her. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"B - Jake tried skiing again the following day. 
Explanation: 
This option is more likely because people tend to be impulsive when it comes to activities they enjoy, especially if they are eager to get back to doing something they love. It's possible that Jake was feeling frustrated or disappointed about breaking his leg, but he might have been tempted to try skiing again as soon as possible, rather than waiting for his leg to fully heal. Additionally, some people might not want to waste their vacation time by taking a break from skiing for an extended period of time."
"B) Valerie hoped to live in Italy someday.
Explanation: The fact that Valerie wants to practice speaking German with a German friend suggests that she has an interest in living in Germany or another German-speaking country. Option B is the more plausible choice because it aligns with this inference."
B) Clara felt very lonely.
B - Tim didn't have to worry about dropping it in water anymore.
B - Gina was so hungry that the fries tasted good this time.
"B - You said goodbye to the man on the phone.
Explanation:  In this situation, you would not be surprised if someone called claiming to be your long lost mother, especially since it's late at night and you may be more vulnerable or tired. However, given that the person on the phone identified themselves as a stranger rather than someone familiar, it's unlikely that you would believe their claim without further evidence or investigation. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome in this scenario."
B - The fresh air was exactly what Nelly needed to clear her head.
"B: Alec was happy to see his daughter developing her verbal ability. 
Explanation:  The story states, ""Alec's daughter made words with them (the blocks) rather than structures."" This implies that she was using the blocks to create words, which suggests an interest in language and communication. As a parent, Alec would be pleased to see his child developing their verbal skills, so option B is the most likely outcome."
"B: It was terrible to be sentenced to life in prison. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the person has been caught red-handed for committing a serious crime like murder. As a result, they are likely to face severe legal consequences, including being sentenced to life in prison. Option A is highly unlikely as it goes against the usual course of justice and would not align with the severity of the crime committed."
"B - He broke the records one by one as his parents watched. 
Explanation: Tim's excitement about playing his parent's old records was short-lived, as he quickly realized that he had no idea how to handle them properly. As he tried to play them on his new record player, he accidentally broke each of them one by one, much to the dismay of his parents who were watching in horror. This outcome is more likely because it highlights Tim's carelessness and lack of knowledge about taking care of valuable items like vinyl records."
B) Amy was determined to lose weight.
B - Tina joined the high school dancing team.
B) Sally cried the rest of her break.
B - Amy was relieved she didn't get any extra money.
Option A: Jennifer worked hard on her lessons and got into the band.
"B - Fred woke up with a hangover. 
Explanation: The story states that Fred got drunk and passed out on the sand, indicating that he consumed alcohol at the beach party. When someone drinks too much alcohol, they can experience a severe hangover the next day. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B - Ronnie quit as soon as he got in.
"Option A: Burke soon reverts back to being grumpy. 
Explanation:  The story suggests that Burke has been consistently grumpy for some time, and it is unlikely that one encounter with a stranger will change his personality permanently. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"B - Matt fiddled with the car radio, looking for a better station.
Explanation:  The fact that Matt was not paying attention to the road while driving suggests that he may have been distracted by something else, such as his phone or the radio. Therefore, option B, where Matt fiddles with the car radio, is the most likely outcome."
"Option B: Brian was not very creative. 
Explanation: The fact that Brian chose to wear a skirt as part of his performance suggests that he wanted to express himself in an unconventional way, which requires some level of creativity. However, it's also possible that Brian simply wanted to make a bold statement or challenge societal norms without necessarily being creative about it. Therefore, option B is the more plausible choice."
B) I hated decorating.
"B - I feel I don't deserve it.
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist has been with the company for nearly eight years, which suggests they have been working there for some time. However, the protagonist also says they were ""so happy"" when their boss offered them the new position, implying they did not expect or feel they deserved the promotion. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
B) Tia used the soap bars to wash her dirty dogs.
Option A - The police found the perpetrator and locked her up.
Option B: Pat is sad.
B - Devastated
"B: Solomon thought his name might not be so bad after all. 
Explanation:  The story states that Solomon ""suspected that [his] being hired was related to [his] unique name."" This suggests that he initially believed that his name played a role in him getting the job. However, upon further reflection, he realizes that this may not be the case, and he begins to appreciate his name more. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B) She was relieved to find it underneath her car seat.
Option B: With a look of disgust, he threw the tickets in the trash.
B: The customer was angry.
"B - Stacey told the police what happened. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's more likely that Stacey would tell the police about the accident rather than getting back in her damaged car and continuing on to work. The police are responsible for investigating accidents and determining fault, so it's important for them to have all of the details of what happened. Additionally, if Stacey were to get back in her car and drive away without reporting the accident, she could be putting herself at risk of further injury or even death if the other driver was impaired or reckless. It's always best to prioritize safety and follow proper procedures after an accident occurs."
"B: It was hard, but they agreed to go their separate ways. 
Explanation:  The story states that it was ""hard"" for Diane when Karen got accepted into Cornell while she didn't, indicating that Diane felt disappointed or upset by this outcome. However, instead of resorting to hate or blaming Karen, Diane chose to accept the situation gracefully and move on from there. This choice reflects a mature and healthy response to an unfortunate event in a friendship."
"B - Later, we gave her a bowl of milk. 
Explanation: The fact that the narrator mentions giving their deceased cat a bowl of milk after finding her dead suggests that they are still grieving for her loss and trying to cope with it in any way they can. This detail aligns better with Option B than Option A, which does not account for this action."
B) Reilly fed the goat extra food.
"B: Sally wanted to inform the family of her husband's condition. 
Explanation: The story states that Sally ""ran away"" and became estranged from the family, indicating that she was not in contact with them for an extended period of time. It is unlikely that she would suddenly become close friends with someone in the family after such a long absence without any explanation or effort on their part. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
B: The compliments she got made Laura think the trip was worth it.
Option B: Neil hated his trip.
B - The man went under the gate.
"B: I left after the first forty-five minutes.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that suggests the person enjoyed the movie or stayed for the entire duration of the film. In fact, the language used implies that they were so uninterested in the movie that they left early. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B) I loved my new socks.
"B - Grayson uses the money from selling his stamps to buy a guitar. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Grayson's decision to sell his beloved stamp collection in order to raise money for rent is not a financially savvy choice. Instead, he chooses to use the money from selling his stamps to purchase something that brings him joy and fulfillment, such as a guitar. This suggests that Grayson values personal happiness over financial gain, which is a more realistic and relatable outcome for many people."
"B: Lance never spoke to Adam again.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about how Adam felt or acted after Lance saved his life. It simply states that Lance took a bullet for Adam without mentioning any subsequent interactions between them. Therefore, it is more likely that Lance never spoke to Adam again rather than assuming that he continued to be close friends with him."
"B - The dentist reassured me that everything was fine. 
Explanation: In this story, the dentist is performing an operation on the protagonist's teeth, which suggests that it is a medical procedure rather than a social or political event. Therefore, option B is more likely as it implies that the protagonist felt anxious about the procedure but was reassured by the dentist's words."
"B) They set up a space in the garage for him to practice. 
Explanation:  The story states that Tim's parents were upset by the noise he made while playing the drums, but they did not hate the sound of the instrument itself. Instead, they found a solution by setting up a separate space in the garage where Tim could practice without disturbing anyone else in the house. This option is more likely than Option A, which suggests that Tim's parents developed an aversion to the trumpet altogether, despite it being the same instrument throughout the story."
B - I always ate there when I wanted to save money!
B - Kenny had to be taken to the hospital.
"B: May had a very stressful night. 
Explanation: The story describes May as having a ""night with no kids or husband,"" which suggests that she may have been feeling lonely or isolated. Additionally, the fact that she took a bubble bath and ordered Chinese takeout implies that she may have been trying to indulge in some self-care activities to cope with her stress. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"B: The cranberry sauce was very sour.
Explanation: Lilly forgot to add sugar to the cranberry sauce, which means that it would be quite sour instead of sweet. This outcome aligns with option B."
B - I had a great time with my kids while they were home from college.
"B) Michael decided to have the dumpster company pick up his trash.
Explanation:  In this story, Michael sees two squirrels living in the same dumpster. This suggests that the dumpster may be a regular source of food or shelter for these animals. However, when the first squirrel disappears after being taken to the landfill, it's possible that the second squirrel has also been displaced by the trash collection process. To avoid any further disturbance to the squirrels, Michael decides to have the dumpster company pick up his trash instead of taking it to the landfill himself."
B - Rob was disappointed.
B) Jennifer realized swimming was not her best hobby.
B) Ace was happy for his friend.
B - So he gave her cash.
"B: The judge convicted him of murder. 
Explanation:  While it's possible that your brother could have gone to jail for failing to appear in court, it's less likely than him being convicted of murder. Failure to appear in court can result in fines or other penalties, but it typically doesn't lead to criminal charges like murder. Additionally, judges tend to take failures to appear seriously and may issue warrants for the individual's arrest, but they are unlikely to convict someone of murder without sufficient evidence of their involvement in the crime."
B - He loved it.
"Option A: His parents relented. 
Explanation: In this story, Ted's parents initially disapprove of his interest in gaming. However, after seeing how passionate and talented he is at writing about games, they eventually come around and support him. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"B - Tammy kept working out.
Explanation:  The passage states that Tammy was in the middle of an intense workout when she passed out. This suggests that she did not learn any valuable lessons from the experience but instead continued with her regular routine despite feeling unwell. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B) Abigail climbed off her wheelchair and onto the bed.
Explanation: The story does not mention anything about Abigail losing weight, which suggests that option A is unlikely. Additionally, the story states that Abigail takes a walk in the morning and at night, but it does not say anything about her being unable to walk on her own without assistance. Therefore, option B is more plausible as it aligns with the information provided in the story."
"B: Eddie loved his new friend. 
Explanation:  The story does not suggest that Eddie has any kind of mental illness or disorder, but rather that he had an unusual experience that he found comforting. The fact that he sought help suggests that he wanted to understand what happened, rather than being afraid of it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"B - Jay had a good laugh.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it's often funny when someone else causes damage to our property, especially if they don't leave any clues or try to make amends. It could be seen as a lighthearted situation, rather than something that would cause anger or frustration."
"B - When they returned, they saw that their house was gone. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it's more likely that when the family returned from work, they found that their house had been destroyed by the explosion caused by the gas leak. This outcome is consistent with the information provided in the story, as the explosion would have resulted in significant damage or destruction to the house. Option A, on the other hand, does not align with the given details, as it implies that the house was still intact and clean after the explosion, which is unlikely."
Option B: Carmen decided to order Domino's instead.
"B - His fingernails are way too long.
Explanation: In this story, Rufus decided to cut his fingernails because they were making a loud tapping sound when he typed on his computer. This implies that his fingernails were already quite long before he decided to cut them. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of Rufus cutting his nails."
B) Herman managed to buy some food to make a small meal.
B - Kelly had to schedule another flight.
"B - They were excited to bring the peaches to grandma. 
Explanation:  In this story, it is clear that everyone enjoys grandma's peach pie, which suggests that they are eager to help her make them. Additionally, the fact that the children have a specific task of picking the peaches themselves implies that they are invested in helping their grandmother prepare the pies. Therefore, option B is the more likely ending to the story."
"B - Candice got better at making tacos. 
Explanation:  The story states that Candice's current taco recipe is not very good, but she still enjoys them. This implies that she has some level of skill or knowledge in making tacos already. Therefore, it is more likely that she will improve upon her existing skills rather than stick with a subpar recipe."
"B - Tony then went back to school and found a different major. 
Explanation:  
The story does not provide any information about Tony's skills or qualifications that would make him particularly employable as an artist. In fact, it states that he ""couldn't find a job."" Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, as Tony may have realized that his degree in art did not lead to a career path he wanted and decided to pursue another field instead."
"B: Jenny was unhappy.
Explanation: The story describes difficult circumstances for Jenny and her mother, including poverty, lack of access to basic necessities like food, and poor living conditions. It is unlikely that Jenny would be ""thrilled"" with these situations, as they are likely to cause significant stress and discomfort for her. Therefore, option B is the more plausible choice."
"Option B: After a month he gave up. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Bill achieved his weight loss goal. In fact, it states that after a month, Bill gave up, which implies that he did not reach his desired weight. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"Option A: The little girl was saved by her dad. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that the little girl would be saved by her father rather than pulling him out of the water. This is because the little girl cannot swim well and is in distress, so she needs help from an adult who can provide assistance. Additionally, the father is more likely to have the strength and ability to pull the child out of the water safely compared to a small child. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
B: I got her phone number.
"B: Cindy was very experienced. 
Explanation:  The story states that Cindy has been driving for a few months, which implies that she has gained some experience behind the wheel. It's unlikely that she would be too scared to drive in the rain if she has already been driving for a while. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"B - You were ashamed of what you had done.
Explanation:  Creating something for the sole purpose of making money without any regard for its quality or value can be seen as unethical or exploitative. It's possible that you may have felt guilty about taking advantage of people's curiosity or lack of critical thinking skills, and this could lead to feelings of shame. Additionally, selling something as a ""coffeeeee table"" or ""bathroom reader"" without providing any real substance or depth may not be taken well by potential buyers who are looking for more meaningful content."
"Option A: He quickly bought the camera. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bob's discovery of the camera's high value increases its attractiveness as an investment opportunity. Given that he has already identified the camera as a good deal at $5, it makes sense for him to purchase it immediately rather than buying film. This choice aligns with human behavior in situations where there is potential for financial gain."
B - He ran away with the small ball.
"B - My mom slammed on the brakes just in time.
Explanation: In this situation, my mom had no time to react by jumping into the swimming pool or any other action that would require her to leave the car. She only had one option left which was to slam on the brakes as quickly as possible to avoid getting hit by the approaching train. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Kelly used the money to treat all her friends to ice cream.
B) It helped him get a job in construction.
Option A: She wore her gray hair with pride.
B) She decided to give it a chance, and returned to the party.
"B - I had to sell the car in another state. 
Explanation: The story states that the car no longer passed the state's inspection, which means it cannot be legally driven on public roads within that state. In order to drive the car legally, the owner would need to either repair or replace the modifications that caused the failure, or they may need to register the car in another state where the modifications are allowed. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - The group got to Las Vegas with no issues.
B - Brandon then became a surfer.
Option B: Randy ran away screaming.
B: The performers were really talented and the music was beautiful.
B - Shay was happy that she went into the office.
"B - The whole family was glad Cinnamon left. 
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it reflects a common experience where people are relieved when an elderly or sick pet passes away, especially if they have been suffering for a long time. While it's understandable that the family may be saddened by Cinnamon's passing, their relief at no longer having to see her in pain can be a significant factor in their emotions."
"B - I kept trying and eventually I excelled.
Explanation: The story suggests that the person had a strong passion for ballet and wanted to excel in it. However, their instructors did not think they were ready for pointe ballet shoes. Instead of giving up, the person continued to try hard and eventually achieved their goal. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Option A: Harry loved Mary. 
Explanation: The story states that ""Harry had his birthday in May"" and ""Every May Harry would also go to the country to see his friend Mary."" This implies a strong connection between Harry and Mary, suggesting that he has positive feelings towards her. Additionally, the fact that they get engaged later on further supports this conclusion. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
B) Cryed at the end
B - The lawn mower suddenly started.
"B) Susan drove back to the last stop to talk to the strange man. 
Explanation:  In this story, Susan felt uneasy after seeing a strange man looking at her intently inside the first rest stop. To alleviate her discomfort, she decided to drive to another rest stop nearby. However, instead of simply using the facilities and resting as per option A, Susan chose to drive back to the same rest stop where she had seen the strange man earlier. This suggests that she may have been curious or even concerned about the man's intentions, leading her to return to the scene of the initial encounter. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B - We stopped in time to see the fox run across the road. 
Explanation:  When your grandfather slammed on the brakes, it's unlikely that he would have been able to stop the car in time to avoid hitting the fox altogether. Instead, he probably slowed down just enough to allow the fox to safely cross the road. Therefore, option B is the more realistic ending to the story."
B - Ashley spent her summer riding her bike instead.
"B - Sam's head hit the steering wheel.
Explanation:  Based on the context of the story, it is more likely that Sam's head hit the steering wheel than him being happy about disabling his mail truck. The story states that Sam was driving too fast and didn't see a pothole in the road, which suggests that he may have been distracted or not paying attention to the road. As a result, he likely lost control of the vehicle and hit the pothole with force, causing his head to strike the steering wheel."
B: The girl found this charming, and gave him a second chance.
"Option B: She threw her ice cream in the garbage. 
Explanation:  While it's possible that Aurelia may have been excited about making her own ice cream, it's also possible that she didn't enjoy it as much as she expected or simply lost interest after one try. In this case, option B is more likely because Aurelia would throw away the leftover ice cream rather than thinking of new recipes to make."
"B: Miriam became a very successful lawyer. 
Explanation: The story states that Miriam ""became a lawyer."" This implies that she pursued a career in law and achieved success in this field, which contradicts option A (Miriam never stopped being pedantic). Therefore, the most likely outcome for Miriam is that she became a successful lawyer."
B - The girls have their passes.
"B - The bus never arrived, and we missed our field trip. 
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it provides a realistic scenario where unexpected events can occur during a field trip, such as a broken-down bus, which could cause delays or even result in missing the planned activities. It's not uncommon for things to go wrong on field trips, especially when traveling by transportation that is outside of one's control."
"B - My family was too demanding. 
Explanation: The story states that none of the family members could tell the narrator what toppings they wanted, and everyone kept changing their minds. This suggests that they were being indecisive or difficult to please, rather than simply wanting vegetables. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
B - Alice helped herself to some coffee and sat down to relax.
"B - Gina got in trouble. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Gina took something that didn't belong to her (her brother's ice cream) without permission, and then refused to give it back when asked. This behavior is not acceptable and could result in consequences such as getting in trouble or losing privileges. It is unlikely that Gina's mom would approve of this behavior and would instead encourage her to return the ice cream to her brother. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Option A: Amber slowly developed into a pretty good hitter. 
Explanation: The story states that Amber practiced for several weeks, indicating that her hitting skills did improve over time. It does not mention anything about her fielding skills improving, which suggests that Option A is more likely."
"B - Gina was having a great time at her grandmother's house.
Explanation: The story states that Gina and her family arrived at their grandma's house, but it also mentions that her grandpa had a heart attack and died, which suggests that the atmosphere at the house is somber and sad. Therefore, option A (Gina missed her grandfather very much) is unlikely. Option B (Gina was having a great time at her grandmother's house) is more plausible because it goes against the initial mention of the sad event that occurred at the house."
B: It was a great morning.
"Option B: Jim quit playing basketball. 
Explanation:  The story states that Jim was ""upset"" when he was cut from the team, which suggests that he had a strong emotional investment in making the team. However, despite this setback, Jim still chose to work hard during the off-season to improve his skills. This shows determination and passion for the sport, but it also means that he has not given up entirely. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - Jim will continue to play basketball, even though he did not make the team the first time around."
"Option A: Gradually, Mary was able to pay off her debt. 
Explanation: The story states that Mary ""wanted to pay it off"" and ""cut off her unnecessary expenses."" This suggests that she took deliberate actions to reduce her spending and increase her savings with the goal of paying off her debt. It's unlikely that she would have made no progress towards paying off her debt without taking any action. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
"B - John didn't know what to do. 
Explanation: The story states that John was worried his teacher would think he was lying, which suggests that he might be afraid of getting in trouble for not completing his homework. However, there is no indication that John actually did turn in his homework late or faced any consequences for it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Tommy decided to take all of the money.
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that Tommy would decide to take all of the money since he was unsure about how to split the profits with Billy. This decision aligns with human nature as people tend to prioritize their own interests over others when there is uncertainty or disagreement involved."
Option A: Tori fell ill because of eating too much candy.
Option B: She decided to go back home.
"B: John then felt sick the rest of the day. 
Explanation: The story states that John ""felt better"" after getting up and having breakfast, which suggests that his initial symptoms were likely due to being cold rather than an actual illness. However, since the story does not provide any further details about how John feels later in the day, it is possible that he could have experienced a relapse or worsening of symptoms at some point afterwards. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
B - Sally was very happy to see cheese pizza.
"B: I've never had a worse day. 
Explanation: The story mentions that it was raining, there was a fire, and the narrator caught a fever. These events are all negative and unfortunate, indicating that the day was particularly bad. Option B better captures this sentiment than option A, which suggests going swimming in the lake, which would be an unusual and unlikely response to such an eventful day."
"Option A: Felipe immediately started planning the next trip. 
Explanation: The story ends with Felipe being sad that his trip had ended, indicating that he enjoyed himself and wants to experience more of the Pacific Northwest. Option A is the most likely choice because it shows that Felipe is eager to plan another trip to the region, which suggests that he had a positive experience there."
B - Ed lost the game.
B - Lary was happy and excited.
B - Jim saved a lot of money in gas by buying a battery-run car.
"B - Nick decided to take his dog to a trainer. 
Explanation:  The fact that the dog was not well-socialized suggests that it may have had difficulty interacting with other dogs in the past. In this case, taking the dog to a trainer can help address any underlying issues and teach the dog how to behave appropriately around other dogs. Option A is unlikely because while Sam might find the situation amusing, it is unlikely that they would be able to do anything to help Nick's dog overcome its socialization issues."
"B - His daughter now adds to it, for her daughter's college.
Explanation: The fact that Earl surprises his daughter with a savings account for their newborn grandchild suggests that he wants to help prepare for the future of his grandchild. It is unlikely that he would do this if he and his daughter didn't have a good relationship. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Everyone else got out safely. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Mosh or his sister were injured during the explosion, so it is more likely that everyone else escaped unharmed. Additionally, the fact that Mosh rushed out with his sister in his arms suggests that he may have been trying to protect her from harm, which further supports this option."
"B - I bought her sexy lingerie instead. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about why you are buying your girlfriend stamps, or what she likes or dislikes. It simply states that she collects them. Therefore, it is unlikely that you would spend money on something as specific and niche as a rare stamp without knowing if she will appreciate it. On the other hand, buying sexy lingerie is a common gift for romantic partners, especially on special occasions like birthdays. So option B is the most likely outcome in this scenario."
Option B: Jake then threw the sandwich away.
B - Elda tossed the fries into the trash can.
B - His training paid off at a marathon later that year.
B) Susie was upset.
"B - The baby grew up to be healthy and strong. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it's more likely that the baby will grow up to be healthy and strong because there are many medical advancements and treatments available today that can help babies with complications survive and thrive. Additionally, the fact that Jon and Mika were scared that the baby might die suggests that they were worried about their baby's health, but now that she has grown up, she is presumably doing well."
"B: Brendon couldn't believe he was soaking wet. 
Explanation: The story states that Brendon ""fell"" after Mike moved his chair, which implies that he may have landed on something soft or wet. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Brendon's reaction."
"Option A - Cara sold lots of items. 
Explanation: The story states that Cara ""decided to plan a garage sale"" and ""worked with her husband to move everything out."" This implies that she successfully held the garage sale and sold many items, as stated in option A. There is no indication in the story that Cara left for Vegas, as mentioned in option B. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"B - They were having a Christmas party at the exit.
Explanation:  This answer choice is more likely because it provides a unexpected twist on the typical expectation of a haunted house experience. Typically, people expect a haunted house to be full of ghosts, monsters, or other spooky creatures, but finding a group of people celebrating Christmas at the end would be a surprising and humorous twist."
"Option B: Lorraine is disappointed. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Lorraine's mother's approval is not enough to satisfy Lorraine's desire for perfection in making biscuits. Despite having spent an entire month on the task and achieving what she considers to be a perfect recipe, Lorraine still feels that something is missing or that her efforts have been unsuccessful. This suggests that Lorraine may be overly critical of herself or have high standards that are difficult to meet, leading to feelings of disappointment rather than satisfaction."
B: The poem made Lucy's mom feel better.
B - The meal Joe prepared was piping hot.
Option A: Many people viewed Jake's skits.
"B - Jackie was happy her car was undamaged.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it is common for people to prioritize their safety and property over any potential harm that may come to animals. While it would be unfortunate if Jackie's car were damaged, she would likely feel relieved that she herself was not injured by the falling horse."
B - They returned many times.
B - He poured the majority of it down the drain of the sink.
B - Returned the TV
"B - Dennis did not have fun. 
Explanation:  The story states that Dennis initially did poorly in the competition and fell off a lot. This suggests that he may have been frustrated or discouraged by his performance early on. Additionally, the fact that he only improved later in the competition means that he may not have had consistent success throughout the event. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, as it indicates that Dennis did not have fun during the competition due to his inconsistent performance."
"Option A: The next year his garden was beautiful and healthy. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Ben's garden improved after adding compost to the soil. Compost can help improve soil structure, increase nutrient availability, and promote beneficial microbial activity, all of which can lead to better plant growth. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome for Ben's garden."
B - Joe started eating the pizza before the delivery man left.
Option B: He then threw the popcorn in the trash.
"B) She accepted the food, and asked them all to leave. 
Explanation: Mary did not want to host the party herself, so she accepted the food and drinks that her friends brought but then asked them all to leave. This option is more likely because it aligns with Mary's desire to avoid hosting the party herself."
B) Jim was frightened by his gunfire.
"B - She wore a ripped shirt the next day. 
Explanation: The story states that Janice decided to dress more formally after her promotion, but then it says she wore a ripped shirt the next day. This suggests that Janice may not have fully committed to dressing more formally or that she may be experimenting with different styles."
B) Juanita continued to take pictures.
B - Jody became a manager and succeeded.
"B - Charlie changed his bad habits. 
Explanation: 
The story states that Charlie's family rushed him to the vet after he stole a large pizza. This implies that Charlie's behavior was problematic enough that it required medical attention. It is unlikely that Charlie continued to engage in this behavior without any consequences or changes. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Sara was fired.
B - She ate all her meals in the cabin while on vacation.
"B) Marcy stopped talking to her friend.
Explanation:  In option B, Marcy stops talking to her friend after they suggest that she use a pen and paper to communicate with strangers. This suggests that Marcy may have felt embarrassed or frustrated by the suggestion, and therefore chose to distance herself from her friend rather than continue to seek their help."
"B: Sharon couldn't wait for Fancy to go. 
Explanation:  The passage states, ""Schnauzers usually don't live that long."" This implies that Sharon knows that Fancy's lifespan is limited and she may not have much time left with her. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"B - Keith's yacht hit the reefs at high speed. 
Explanation:  While it is possible for someone to experience both an earthquake and a boating accident, they are unlikely to occur simultaneously. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A."
B: Sean loved the outdoors.
"B - The parents had another baby.
Explanation: 
This answer choice is more likely because it provides an explanation for why the parents are ""somewhat less enthused"" about having a second child after the joy of having a first child. Having another baby would be a natural extension of this narrative, as the parents may feel overwhelmed but still excited to welcome another child into their family. Option A does not provide a clear reason for the parents' lack of enthusiasm, making it less plausible."
"B - Chris was excited to get caught.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems unlikely that Chris would beg for mercy after getting caught stealing. Instead, it appears that Chris may have been eager or excited to get caught, perhaps because they were hoping to avoid consequences or because they enjoyed the thrill of breaking the law."
B) Rene then played games.
"B - Neil decided he never wanted to go to Bangkok again. 
Explanation: The story describes Neil's positive experiences in Bangkok, including enjoying the local food and buying souvenirs. However, the final sentence indicates that Neil has had enough of Bangkok and does not want to return. This suggests that Option B is the more likely outcome for Neil's trip."
B - Amy was pleased.
"B - We walk in and the food is on the table right away.
Explanation: The story mentions that the restaurant is a favorite of the speaker, and they visit frequently with their girlfriend. This suggests that the restaurant has good service and is able to accommodate regular customers quickly and efficiently. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"B: And he decided that it was his calling to fight crime. 
Explanation:  The fact that Mike has never been shot before and now finds himself thinking about life after being shot suggests that this experience may have changed his perspective on things. It could be that he realizes that fighting crime is what he wants to do with his life, despite the danger involved. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Mike's character."
"B: Tracy's apprehensions about marriage were confirmed. 
Explanation:  The story suggests that Tracy had doubts about marriage before meeting Doug, and their relationship did not change her mind. Despite learning to ""feel love again"" from Doug, Tracy still has reservations about getting married. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the character of Tracy."
B - Joseph went downstairs and got an ice cream.
Option A: He enjoyed his stay in the country.
"B - They didn't like the beach anymore.
Explanation: The story states that Ray likes reading books and listening to music on his MP3 player, but his girlfriend prefers going into the water. This suggests that they have different preferences when it comes to activities at the beach. Additionally, the fact that they spend ""hours"" at the beach implies that they may have been there before and are now bored with it, leading them to not enjoy it as much as they used to. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Option A: The friend was very grateful for the help. 
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it aligns with our expectations of how people would behave in this situation. Helping someone who has car trouble in the middle of the night is generally seen as a kind and selfless act, and it's reasonable to assume that the friend would be appreciative of the assistance."
B) Grace was happy about the ice.
B: Harrison was happy and excited.
"B - Sally could not buy anything without any money.
Explanation: In this scenario, Sally did not have enough money to purchase anything with the gift cards she received as a prize. This outcome is more plausible than option A, where Sally finds an item she wants and buys it without any financial constraints."
"B: Fred enjoyed reading stories from his past.
Explanation: The passage states that Fred ""references"" the diary to see how he spent his time, which implies that he enjoys looking back on his memories. It also mentions that Fred reads stories from his past, further indicating that he finds pleasure in reflecting on his experiences. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Sky never wanted her trip to end.
B: Joss considered the exchange student to be like a sister.
B - They all had fun.
"B: It's nice to relax and reminisce.
Explanation: The story suggests that the speaker enjoys spending time with their father, even if they don't enjoy watching baseball together. They find it pleasant to reminisce about the past and spend quality time with their parent, which indicates option B as the correct answer."
B - They were so quiet, I had to call the police.
B - Threw it in the trash.
B - He did not drive under the influence.
B - Francisco became a good skier.
B: Sal felt great.
"B - Surprise! They found it on the street she parked it. 
Explanation: 
The story states that Alycia parked her car on the street before heading out with her friends. If she had parked it somewhere else, such as a parking lot or garage, it would have been mentioned in the story. Since the story only mentions ""the street,"" it is more likely that the group found Alycia's car right where she left it."
B - Katie was relieved when her mother said the backyard.
"B) The police told them to keep playing.
Explanation: In this scenario, the police are more likely to tell the two bands to continue playing rather than stopping them. This is because they may view the impromptu jam session as a cultural exchange or a form of free expression, rather than a disturbance. Additionally, the police may be reluctant to intervene in a situation where people are simply enjoying music and each other's company."
B - Eric couldn't return Bill's hit and lost the match.
B - Gina's mother took out a loan to cover the expenses.
"B - The squirrels began to come to her house more often. 
Explanation:  When someone starts feeding wild animals, especially food that is easy for them to access like peanuts, they will begin to associate that location with a reliable source of food. In this case, since your mother was consistently providing food for the squirrels in her yard, they would have learned to visit her house regularly for their meals. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - She soon learned to ride. 
Explanation: The story states that the narrator helped their niece learn how to ride the bicycle, which implies that they provided support and guidance until she became confident and skilled enough to ride on her own. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
B) Gina was worried about her parents finding out.
B: Alicia was happy to be leaving her old house.
Option B: He had to admit he didn't really like their cat very much.
B) I loved the new raincoat I bought.
B: Laura had a good day in class that day.
B - Ray ran to his daughter to make sure she was okay.
B - They got into the plane.
"B - Stopped talking and went home.
Explanation: The story suggests that the speaker did not prepare for the speech, relied on faking it instead, and used big words to try to sound smart. However, since they didn't actually know what they were saying, it's more likely that they lost their train of thought and stopped speaking altogether rather than delivering a successful speech."
"B: He gave the parents a prescription, which they filled promptly. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that the doctor would give the parents a prescription for medication rather than suggesting counseling for their son. This is because doctors are trained to treat medical conditions with medication whenever possible, especially when it comes to behavioral issues like hyperactivity or disruptiveness. Additionally, filling a prescription is something that parents are familiar with doing, whereas seeking counseling may be less familiar or intimidating for some people."
B) She invited all her friends to join her at that restaurant.
B - Threw the noodles in the trash.
Option A - He finally found it in the garage.
B) He was so happy that he did and loved the park even more.
B - The company gave Wendy a full refund and apology.
"B - E spit out his beer. 
Explanation: 
Jackson knows that alcohol can impair judgment, so it would make sense for him to avoid having more than one beer in this situation. Having two beers would increase the risk of impaired judgment, which goes against Jackson's goal of being responsible and healthy. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - The frog was still hungry.
Explanation: In this story, the frog was able to catch a glimpse of the fly but failed to catch it due to its quickness. This means that the frog's hunger remains unfulfilled, making option B the more likely outcome."
B - She yelled at him.
"B - The snake bit me. 
Explanation:  In this situation, it's more likely that the snake would bite you than for you to run towards it. Snakes are generally defensive animals and will only attack if they feel threatened or cornered. Running towards a snake can be seen as an aggressive move and may provoke it into striking. It's better to slowly back away from the snake while keeping a safe distance until it has moved away or until help arrives."
B) He decided he needed to do something about his addiction.
"B - She stormed out, claiming I always change the topic.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it's common for people who have experienced traumatic events to avoid talking about them or become defensive when someone brings up the past. Your cousin may not want to confront their own emotions or memories related to your illness, so they might react negatively by accusing you of changing the subject."
B: Matthew's mother put Matthew in his time-out corner.
B - Tine sat on the couch and ate bonbons instead of trying out.
B - It was a deer that I was able to stalk and shoot successfully.
"B - Jack was able to climb without any discomfort.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Jack experienced any discomfort or pain from sitting on the cactus. In fact, it states that he was able to climb without any difficulty, implying that he did not experience any adverse effects from his encounter with the cactus. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Lynn told Jim that he is unattractive.
Explanation:  In this scenario, it is more likely that Lynn would be embarrassed or uncomfortable around her crush than confidently tell him she finds him attractive. It is also possible that she may have already had negative feelings towards him due to his job as a ""bag boy"" which could further reinforce her lack of interest in him."
B - Riley stopped being friends.
"B - Ann is relieved she is not pregnant. 
Explanation:  Miscarriages are often emotionally challenging experiences for expectant mothers. While some women may experience grief or sadness after a miscarriage, others may feel relieved that they no longer have to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. In this case, option B is more likely as Ann's relief at not being pregnant suggests that she did not want to be pregnant at the time of the miscarriage."
"B - Aya was very upset about the outcome of the contest. 
Explanation:  The story states that Aya ""thought she had a chance"" to win the contest, implying that she did not expect to win. When she actually wins, it would be unexpected and potentially disappointing for her, making option B the more likely choice."
B - His parents threw him out of the house.
"B - Anna went to the club and danced all night long. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Anna having a legal case against the driver who hit her, so option A (Anna sued them but got nothing because they had no insurance) is unlikely. Instead, the story suggests that Anna is able to continue with her day as usual after being hit by the car, which implies that she did not suffer serious injuries. Therefore, option B (Anna went to the club and danced all night long) is more plausible."
"Option B: Dave was so relieved! 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Dave's initial excitement about spending a day at the beach is contrasted with his relief when he realizes that the storm clouds will prevent him from going outdoors. This suggests that Dave values relaxing indoors more than he enjoys being at the beach, which makes option B the more likely choice."
"Option B - They both purchased sports cars with the money. 
Explanation:  The story states that Ron had saved all his overtime pay and had lots of cash. This suggests that he was able to save a significant amount of money. Given that they wanted a new, bigger home, it's unlikely that they would use all their savings on a down payment for a new home. Instead, they may have chosen to splurge on something else, like sports cars."
B - Most people liked Cover A.
B: The cat rejected the new post made of sisal.
"B) Daniel had to get an actual job. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that Daniel's lack of success with his website is due to the fact that he isn't getting enough traffic or attention to his site. This suggests that he needs to do more to promote his work and reach a wider audience, which may involve taking on other responsibilities or jobs to supplement his efforts. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Gary thanked me for my thoughtfulness.
B: We had a wonderful time camping.
"Option B: I decided to throw my bowling ball on the counter. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any context or reason why you would be buying a bowling ball at a grocery store, so it is unlikely that option A (I liked getting a good deal) is true. Additionally, throwing a bowling ball on the counter is an unusual action that is not consistent with shopping for groceries, making option B the more likely choice."
Option A: Joey finally received a call from an employer and got the job.
"B) He was much happier now that he had some companions in his life. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Joe's loneliness was alleviated by meeting new people through Craigslist. This implies that having social interactions and connections with others can improve one's happiness. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Joe's situation."
"B - It helped her mental state immensely. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Amy tried meditation for the first time and found it helpful in reducing her stress levels. This implies that she experienced a positive impact on her mental state after practicing meditation. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of Amy's experience with meditation."
"B - Nya later regretted eating unhealthy food. 
Explanation:  In this story, Nya made an impulsive decision to eat something that goes against her goal of eating healthily. This suggests that she may experience negative consequences as a result of her choice, such as feeling guilty or regretful about it later on. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Nya's situation."
"B - She hoped she would soon be sick again. 
Explanation: The fact that her symptoms improved by the end of the day suggests that she may have been experiencing a minor illness or virus, rather than a serious one. Therefore, it is more likely that she will experience another episode of being sick in the near future."
B - The view was great and Ted was happy they had come.
"Option A: A tornado came within 2 blocks of the house! 
Explanation:  In this story, the author mentions that there was a tornado warning on television, which suggests that a tornado had been spotted nearby. Additionally, the author notes that the palm tree fronds are blowing so hard they are scratching the windows, which is a common indicator of strong winds associated with tornadoes. Therefore, option A is the most likely ending to the story."
B - I went home and practiced drawing.
"B: Lisa got a degree in business. 
Explanation: The story states that Lisa ""finally"" dropped out of school, indicating that this decision came after some time and consideration. It also mentions that her friends and family told her it was crazy to leave school, implying that they were opposed to her decision. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as Lisa ultimately decided to continue with her original plan of getting a degree in business despite her reservations."
"B: Mary's friends were very disappointed in her. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that Mary's friends will be disappointed in her for breaking the rules and sneaking out without their knowledge or consent. Friends may not approve of such actions and could potentially distance themselves from Mary if they feel betrayed or disrespected by her behavior."
B - Ivy returned home, and never spoke to Peter again.
"B - The man built the tower and it was grand. 
Explanation:  
The story implies that the man has experience and knowledge of building structures, as he has drawn detailed plans for the tower. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that the man successfully built the tower according to his designs. Option A, on the other hand, would imply that the man lacks expertise in building design, making it less likely that he could create such an impressive structure."
"B - She tore the picture up and threw it away.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Lauren and her sisters resemble each other, so option A is unlikely. Instead, the story suggests that Lauren may have had negative feelings towards her sisters or the memory of their trip, which could lead her to tear the picture up and throw it away."
B
B - Mark was early for work.
"B: Amy showed little interest in the flute. 
Explanation:  Although Amy expressed an initial desire to play the flute, the fact that it was ""terribly hard"" to play suggests that she may not have been as interested or invested in learning as she initially claimed. Additionally, the fact that she only practiced for a week before giving up further supports this conclusion."
Option B: Bryan decided to buy bananas.
"B - Emily picked up her child to comfort him. 
Explanation: In this situation, it is more likely that Emily would pick up her child to comfort him rather than letting him walk closer to the lions. As a parent, Emily's priority is to keep her child safe and secure, so she would take action to calm him down and protect him from any potential danger. Walking closer to the lions could be perceived as a threat or an unsafe environment for a young child, so option B is the more plausible choice."
Option B: Kim was upset when her family got a puppy.
"Option A: Karen improved with the team. 
Explanation: The story suggests that the coach's speech had an inspirational effect on everyone, including Karen. It implies that she worked hard and improved her skills along with the rest of the team. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"B: Kayla told the therapist she was suicidal and asked for help.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is most likely that Kayla will tell the therapist she is feeling suicidal and ask for help. This is because the story mentions that Kayla has been struggling with crippling anxiety for a long time, which can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair. Additionally, the fact that her brother is nervous about her attending the social event suggests that he may be concerned about her mental health as well. It is important to note that seeking professional help is often an important step towards managing and overcoming mental health issues, so it is likely that Kayla will take this step."
B) Ricky was soaking wet from falling in the pond.
"B - My husband is so disappointed!
Explanation: The story states that Blue Belle ice cream was recalled and stopped production not too long ago. If it has just recently returned to shelves, it's likely that my husband would be disappointed that he can no longer get his favorite flavor."
B - The talent show told Oni to never come back.
B: He is surprised when his mom gives him money for helping.
B - Her sister was mad!
"B - When he got home, he prepared to return his three movies. 
Explanation:  The fact that Lenny went next door to buy a pizza suggests that he was already in the neighborhood where the Hollywood Video store is located. Therefore, it is more likely that he would have returned the movies when he got home rather than going back out of his way to do so later."
"B) Laura then became elected by the country.
Explanation:  In this scenario, the fact that Laura shared about burning bras in the 1960s did not have any negative impact on her political career. Instead, it actually helped her gain support from the audience, as they were impressed by her confidence and willingness to share such a personal detail. This suggests that the public views Laura as someone who is authentic and unapologetic, which could be an asset in a political campaign. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B - Charlie vowed to change things if he was ever made chief.
Explanation:  Charlie did not start taking bribes, as this would go against his moral values and could lead to disciplinary action or even termination from the police department. Instead, Charlie chose to focus on making positive changes within the organization by working towards becoming the chief of police one day. This option aligns more closely with Charlie's desire to make a difference in the community while upholding ethical standards."
B - Our dog feels much better playing with another dog.
B: They tell him to never wait so long to do laundry again.
"B: We took her out to drinks to celebrate. 
Explanation:  In this story, my friend did well on the MCAT after studying hard, which means that she achieved her goal of becoming a doctor. Taking her out to drinks to celebrate would be a natural response given how much effort she put into preparing for the exam and achieving success. Option A is unlikely because there is no indication in the story that my friend gave up on her dream of becoming a doctor or stopped discussing it with others."
B - Kelly was very happy to have soaking wet clothes.
"B - Ben asked his grandfather if they could watch a movie instead. 
Explanation:  In this story, Ben finds fishing to be unpleasant and painful (he pricks his finger on a hook). Therefore, it's unlikely that he would want to do it again soon or ask his grandfather when they can go fishing next. Instead, he might prefer to do something else, like watching a movie, which is what he asks his grandfather in option B."
"B - Amelia was very happy. 
Explanation:  The story states that Amelia's friend had set her up on a blind date, which means she didn't know much about the person she would be meeting. However, since she got to the restaurant early and waited for her date without any signs of anxiety or disappointment, it suggests that she was feeling optimistic and excited about the possibility of meeting someone new. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B: The boy left without getting his picture taken.
Explanation: 
In this story, the mom used information about Santa being responsible for bringing presents as a way to change the boy's mind about sitting with him. However, it's unlikely that the boy would suddenly become excited about seeing Santa after hearing this piece of information. Instead, he may have felt even more uncomfortable or anxious about sitting with someone he doesn't want to see. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - the boy leaves without getting his picture taken."
B) Stewart was glad that he remembered to keep the fire going.
"Option A: Anthony became successful because of his linguistic abilities. 
Explanation: In this story, Anthony's ability to learn and speak Spanish is portrayed as a positive trait that leads to success. The fact that he was able to study hard and become fluent in the language suggests that he has a talent for languages, which contributed to his overall success. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"B - After that, she was able to go home and cook a good meal. 
Explanation:  In this story, Amy's trip to the second grocery store did not affect her ability to cook a good meal at home. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
B: Joanie ran outside to confront her brother.
"B: Soon all her friends had arranged their beds the same way. 
Explanation:  In this story, when Cornelia rearranges her bed, her friends notice and like the new layout. This leads them to also want to change the placement of their own beds in similar ways. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome as it shows how the actions of one person can influence those around them."
"B - Tim is scared to ride his motorcycle. 
Explanation: The fact that Tim ""wrecked"" his motorcycle suggests that he may have had a negative experience while riding, which could lead him to be scared or hesitant to ride again. Additionally, the phrase ""now he almost never rides it"" further supports this option as it implies that Tim has lost confidence in his ability to safely operate the vehicle."
B - Wendy enjoyed seeing the photos.
"B - Tom and Jake enjoyed the nice view.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Tom and Jake were unable to see the band due to the height of other people in the general admission area. In fact, it explicitly states that ""some very tall people were standing"" which suggests that there was a good view from where they were standing. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Lester went out and got the best cell phone he could afford. 
Explanation:  The story states that Lester wanted to avoid having another experience of being stranded with no way to contact for help, so it makes sense that he would go out and get a cell phone to prevent this from happening in the future."
Option B: Ben sold his kidney for crack.
B - I came home and ate pizza.
"B - Now Anna has a diverse tank with fish and coral. 
Explanation:  The story states that Anna initially only kept coral in her saltwater fish tank but then decided she wants some fish as well. This implies that Anna already had experience keeping coral before adding fish to her tank, which means she knows how to care for them properly. Therefore, it's more likely that Anna will successfully keep both fish and coral in her tank rather than returning the fish to the store."
B - Lee decided to adopt the kitten.
Option B: Bob returned everything the next day.
"Option A: Jamal Lewis gave him personal advice and wished him the best. 
Explanation:  It's highly unlikely for a famous athlete like Jamal Lewis to tell someone to ""stay far away"" from them, especially if they are just a young fan who looks up to them. More likely, Lewis would be flattered by the encounter and offer words of encouragement or advice to the young fan."
"Option B: But she didn't want the robin anymore. 
Explanation: Ella took great pains to make the robin comfortable and feed it, but after some time, she lost interest in caring for it. This is a more realistic outcome than simply deciding that she likes taking care of the bird without any indication of how she feels about it."
"B: I go back to work at my job tomorrow. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that the protagonist has actually left their job or that they are no longer employed there. It simply states that they ""quit"" their job, which could mean that they have submitted their resignation but have not yet been fired or otherwise separated from their employment. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
B) The flower eventually died after being left out for several weeks without proper care or maintenance.
"Ben was frustrated at the extra charge. 
Explanation:  The story states that Ben was charged a $30 fee by the bank, which caused him inconvenience and frustration. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
B - The patron didn't understand Chris because he only spoke Chinese.
"Option A: I learned a lot from Google. 
Explanation: The story suggests that the speaker enjoyed using Google and learned a lot from it. Option A reflects this sentiment by stating that the speaker ""learned a lot"" from the website. In contrast, Option B implies that the speaker became frustrated or angry with Google, which does not align with the tone of the story."
B - He realized he needed to quit his job.
B - His owner began running 12 miles a day.
"B: Mia wished she could be indoors. 
Explanation: The story states that Mia loves being outdoors, but after climbing the tallest mountain in her area, she wishes she could be indoors. This suggests that while she enjoyed the experience of mountain climbing, she may have found it physically or mentally challenging, or simply prefer spending time indoors. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Mia's story."
B - Fred's coworker who saw him assault his boss called the police.
B: She was glad to hear that.
"B: Victor realizes he has left his sweatshirt at the gym. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any information that would suggest Victor will continue to buy pistachios regularly. In fact, it mentions him only buying one jar, which implies that this was just an isolated incident for him. On the other hand, the mention of Victor leaving his sweatshirt at the gym suggests that this is something he may do frequently or consistently, given that he forgets things easily. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct ending to the story."

Explanation: The story states that Sharon ""couldn't have been more wrong"" in her assumption about the size of the plants, implying that they grew to an unexpectedly large size. This suggests that option B is the most likely outcome."
B - She drove her car to the mechanic to get it looked at.
"B - Tom loved the idea of a fast. 
Explanation:  The story states that Tom was ""tired of everyday life,"" suggesting that he may be seeking something more meaningful or fulfilling. When faced with a challenge like running out of water, rather than immediately returning to his old way of life, Tom might embrace the opportunity to test himself and push beyond his limits. This could involve seeing how long he can go without water, or exploring other ways of obtaining it that are more challenging or unconventional. In this sense, Tom loves the idea of a fast because it allows him to confront his own limitations and potentially discover new aspects of himself."
Option A: Tim worked hard in school to become one.
"B - My sister was hiding something from us.
Explanation: The fact that your sister is dressing up for Saint Patrick's Day on the center's calendar suggests that she may be trying to hide something from you. This could be anything from a personal secret to a problem at work, which makes option B the more likely choice."
"B - Fred was very happy. 
Explanation:  When a company has good earnings, its stock price tends to increase. In this case, since Apple's stock price increased from $90 to $100 after their good earnings report, Fred would be happy with his investment decision.

B) Jen lost the spelling bee.
B: Kelly is agoraphobic.
"B - She was fortunately able to get back to the beach house safely. 
Explanation:  In this story, Emily (Anna) found herself caught in a sandstorm while at the beach. This suggests that she may have been separated from her belongings or shelter during the storm.

"B: They drank the alcohol and got drunk. 
Explanation: The story states that Andrew's friends wanted to drink, and since Andrew's parents were out of town, he took them to his parent's secret stash of alcohol.

B - Ellen was perfectly comfortable.
Option A: Jose had fun at the skatepark.
"B - Mike started laughing hysterically. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any evidence of Mike having a stroke or experiencing any other serious medical condition.

B - Helen went down to the lake to rent a jet-ski.
"Option B: Dan was ashamed of his father.
Explanation:  Throughout the story, there are no hints that suggest Dan admires or looks up to his father. Instead, there are several indications that Dan may be ashamed of his father's actions or behavior. For example, when Dan says ""to the camera my father was my inspiration,"" he could be implying that his father's negative influence has motivated him to work hard and achieve success, rather than the other way around. Additionally, the fact that the journalist informs Dan that the show is live suggests that Dan's statement about his father could potentially be broadcast to a large audience, which could further emphasize his shame or embarrassment."
"B: Jeremy's demeanor is perfect for the workplace. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any evidence that Jeremy's behavior was inappropriate or disruptive in the workplace. In fact, it suggests that he has a ""distinct and strong"" personality, which could be an asset in many professional settings. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"B) Fran suffered a fatal heart attack as she arranged flowers.
Explanation:  The story does not provide any information about the number of months that passed since the cranes stopped coming to Fran's yard, but it does mention that several months have gone by without them returning. This could be interpreted as a sign of stress or anxiety building up inside Fran, which eventually leads to a heart attack. Additionally, the fact that Fran was arranging flowers when she died suggests that she may have been feeling particularly anxious or stressed at that moment, making option B the more likely outcome."
B - Our team felt gratified.
B: Kelly graduated with good grades.
B: Sophie laughed in her face.
"B - Kelly hoped that she wouldn't get a phone call. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that Kelly will not receive a call from the interviewer because many employers do not follow up with candidates after an interview.

"B - Don never went to the lake again.

B) She donates the boots to the thrift store.
"B - Andrew was so relieved. 
Explanation:  The story states that Andrew ""couldn't find"" the ring, implying that he had been searching for it and was unable to locate it.

B) He learned that honesty pays.
"B - I decided to only take one long warm shower per week.
Explanation: The speaker in the story loves taking long warm showers, but feels guilty about how wasteful it is.

This choice aligns with their desire to be more mindful of water usage while still enjoying their showers."
The most likely outcome for this story is option B: Barry decided to leave the game. This is because watching a professional sports game can sometimes be overwhelming or unenjoyable for some people, especially if they are not familiar with the sport or the players involved. Additionally, grabbing a beer may have been enough of an experience for Barry without needing to also purchase a hot dog.
"B - We could even see the trap working. 
Explanation: The story states ""When that didn't work, we bought a special trap."" This implies that the fly trap was not visible or noticeable beforehand, but once it was purchased and set up, its effectiveness became apparent. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
"B) Remy felt it was a good idea to spill more milk on the carpet. 
Explanation:  In this story, Remy did not learn from her mistake of not cleaning the spill properly. Instead, she decides to intentionally spill more milk on the carpet, which suggests that she may not take responsibility for her actions or be willing to make changes to avoid future messes. This outcome is more likely than Option A, where Remy learns to clean better after spilling milk on the carpet."

Explanation:  In this story, the narrator had a great experience at the concert and even met their idol afterward.

Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
"Option A: Eric then gave up working out. 
Explanation:  The passage states that Eric stuck to his diet for only a month before giving up on both exercise and eating healthy foods. This suggests that he may have found it difficult to maintain the lifestyle changes he had made, leading him to abandon them altogether. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
B - Sally did well, and her parents agreed to take her to Hawaii.
"B - We made a lot of money for our needs.

"B - I hate my smartphone.
Explanation: The story mentions that the advent of the smartphone made flashlights less needed, which suggests that the speaker no longer uses their flashlights as much as they used to. This could lead to feelings of frustration or dislike towards the smartphone, which is option B. Option A does not make sense in this context because it implies that the speaker has too many flashlights and doesn't know what to do with them, which is unlikely given the limited space available for carrying flashlights compared to the size of modern homes."
"B: Terry was still disappointed. 
Explanation: The fact that Terry's mother explained that he was named after his loving grandfather does not necessarily mean that Terry has come to terms with or accepted his given name. In fact, it seems more likely that Terry is still feeling disappointed about having a ""normal"" name rather than a cool one like Super Metro Volcano Man. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
B - The Parker family soon moved into their new home.
"B - Tom began to worry.
Explanation:  The fact that the front door was open suggests that someone may be inside the house, which could indicate that something is amiss or dangerous. Therefore, it is more likely that Tom would begin to worry rather than laugh."

"B - Joe was in terrible pain. 
Explanation:  In this story, Joe falls while performing a trick on his skateboard and breaks his arm. This injury would likely cause him significant pain, making option B the more likely outcome.

"Option B: Terry has given up swimming. 
Explanation:  Terry's consistent effort to learn how to dive without success may lead him to give up on his dream of becoming a good diver, especially if he finds it too difficult or frustrating. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Terry."
"B - Peter grew up to be a scientist. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Peter grew up to be a scientist.

Option A: Howard was happy to have had such a good day.
"Option A: His coworkers took him to safety and called their medic. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it's more likely that the man's coworkers would take him to safety and call for medical attention rather than the man attempting to run towards them. This is because if someone has been struck by a falling object, they may be in shock or have serious injuries that could make it difficult or dangerous for them to move on their own. It's important for people in these situations to receive prompt medical attention to ensure their safety and well-being."
"B: Trent was careless and caused a huge fire.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Trent will be careless and cause a huge fire while trying to keep the fire going in the wind. The fact that he is in charge of keeping the fire going despite not enjoying camping suggests that he may not be paying close attention or taking the necessary precautions to prevent an accident. Additionally, the mention of a windy day adds an element of danger to the situation, making it more plausible that Trent could lose control of the fire."
"B: Things had turned out just as he'd hoped.

"Option B: I decided to buy her a candy bar instead. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any information that would suggest the mother intended to adopt the puppy or purchase one from the shelter. Instead, it seems more likely that she simply allowed her daughters to play with the puppy while they were visiting the shelter. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
B - Mario spent the afternoon catching butterflies in the park.
"B) Zeke lived out his life very happy.
Explanation:  The story does not provide any information about why Zeke wanted to leave America or what problems he faced while building his house in Cozumel. Therefore, it is more likely that Zeke was able to successfully build his house and live there happily for the rest of his life."

B - Gina felt very lonely.
"B - I am no longer afraid of planes.
Explanation: In this story, the child initially expresses fear when getting on the plane, but by the end of the story, they are no longer afraid.

"Option B: Doug found no snow and was instantly thrilled. 
Explanation: The story states that all Doug wanted was a white Christmas, but when he woke up the next morning and found no snow, he was ""instantly thrilled."" This suggests that Doug's desire for a white Christmas may have been more about the romanticized idea of the holiday than an actual requirement for happiness. It's possible that he was excited by the prospect of spending time with loved ones or engaging in other festive activities without the burden of shoveling snow. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"Option A: Sheryl was proud of her job as a museum curator. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Sheryl enjoys her job as a museum curator, as she finds it interesting and valuable. When her family dismisses her job as ""boring,"" Sheryl counters by pointing out that working with living history is actually quite unique and meaningful.

B - Joe went back to sleep.
"B) She hired a defense attorney.
Explanation:  In this story, Ned's wife has been accused of lying about her husband's death and the police have arrested her. It is likely that she will want to defend herself in court and hire a lawyer to help her do so. This is why option B is the most likely outcome."
"B) Jackie was very depressed. 
Explanation:  The story states that after 48 hours of being in labor, Jackie's baby was released. This means that Jackie has given birth to a stillborn or deceased child. As a result, she would be feeling sadness, grief, and possibly even depression due to this tragic event. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Jackie's emotional state."
B) We bought the kitten.
"B - He was sad for the rest of the day.
Explanation:  The story states that Joe's sister always gets As, implying that she is a high achiever. This could create feelings of inadequacy or competition in Joe, leading him to feel sad if he doesn't meet her standards. Additionally, the fact that he is proud of getting an A on his spelling homework suggests that he may be more sensitive about not meeting his own expectations than those of others. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Option A: Finally, they decided on an apartment.

Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome as it suggests that Keira will leave the relationship rather than continue to be in an abusive situation."
B: The shepherd then released the sheep.
"B - He decided to never date again.
Explanation: In this story, Walter has feelings of guilt about dating someone new after his wife's passing. This suggests that he may be struggling with grief and finding it difficult to move on.

Option A: They had a good time together.
B) The couple ordered appetizers and decided on their entrees.
B - Kay had to go buy more things.
"B - The girls had a great time.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it goes against our expectations of what usually happens when people get into a fight. Typically, fights lead to embarrassment or conflict, but in this case, the girls having a good time is an unexpected twist that makes the story more interesting."
"B - Vinny got his picture taken with him. 
Explanation:  The story states that Vinny saw Denzel Washington out taking a stroll, which means they were in public together.

B) We were gratified.
Option B: They save the world.

There is no indication in the story that Troy did not have fun or wants to stop playing with Sam. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"B - Yvonne felt defeated.
Explanation: Although Yvonne had lost weight, the fact that it took her only two months to lose 23 pounds may indicate that she did not make significant changes to her diet or exercise routine, which could lead to feelings of frustration or defeat rather than pride in her accomplishment."
"B - When she finished the preparation, she consumed the yummy drink. 
Explanation: The story states that India ""prepared the coffee in the machine"" and ""grabbed the milk and ice."" This implies that she was making an iced coffee, which would require cold ingredients like milk and ice. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Option B: Betsy was really excited. 
Explanation:  The story states that Betsy was ""so sad and disappointed"" when her mom initially refused to get her a puppy, which suggests that she was not thrilled about getting a hamster instead.

"B - Stay Lost
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist ""walked for miles"" searching for their friends, indicating that they were trying to find their way back to civilization.

Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Option A: The teacher admired Haley's passion and agreed. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it is more likely that the teacher would be impressed by Hailey's determination and agree to lend her a pair of running shoes. Teachers often value students who are enthusiastic and motivated, especially when they demonstrate resilience and resourcefulness like Hailey did here. By asking politely and showing appreciation for the teacher's help, Hailey increased the chances of getting what she wanted."
"B - Jim threw the ring away.
Explanation:  It's unlikely that Jim would sell a valuable historical artifact for only $1,000.

B: Kyle and Ted got so sick that they both lost.
"B - Bob's friends quickly brought him some water to hydrate him. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Bob became dehydrated due to excessive sweating during the game of volleyball.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
B) Kathy took them to the store again right away.
"Option B: Chuck dropped out of school.
Explanation: The fact that Chuck was afraid of public speaking suggests that he may have struggled in the debates, which could lead him to drop out of the team. Additionally, joining a new activity without proper preparation or support can be challenging, especially if one lacks confidence in their abilities. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A."

"Option B: Laura never painted again. 
Explanation:  The fact that Laura shared her painting with others online suggests that she may have been seeking validation or approval from others, which could lead to feelings of disappointment or discouragement if the response is not positive.

"Option A: He won his first fight by knockout. 
Explanation: The story states that Jason became a great boxer after training in his spare time, which implies that he had success in the sport. Option A is the most likely ending because it aligns with this implication, as winning one's first fight by knockout is a common way for boxers to make a successful debut. In contrast, option B does not fit with the narrative, as there is no mention of Jason participating in wrestling matches."
B - We all had a good time.
"B - Tom asked him what the problem was. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's more likely that Tom would be curious about why the tall gentleman is yelling and would ask him what's wrong rather than offering him something like a glass of water. Yelling without any apparent reason can be startling or disturbing, so Tom might want to know what caused the outburst before he gets too uncomfortable."
"B: Allie gained all the weight back she had lost. 
Explanation:  It's common for people who have undergone significant weight loss to regain some or all of the weight over time, especially if they don't make sustained lifestyle changes.

B: Jenny narrowly avoided a car accident.
B - Elle was very responsible.
B - The mechanic told Jay it was only a minor repair.
"B - He waited until wildlife rescue arrived to save the baby possums. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Ned did not go to the gym after work but instead waited for professional help to arrive before attempting to care for or handle the baby possums himself. This option is more likely because caring for young wild animals requires specialized knowledge and equipment, and handling them improperly can be harmful to both humans and animals. It's best to leave their care to trained professionals who have the necessary expertise and resources."
B - Don never forgave his friend.
Option A: The neighbor had my dog.
"B: Eventually they had children.
Explanation: The story suggests that the couple started dating after meeting at Costco, and five years later they got married.

Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
"B - Cindy continued holding the soup. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's unlikely that Cindy would go get cold water to put on her burned hands because she may not have realized how hot the soup was or may not have wanted to stop eating. Instead, she may continue holding the soup while wincing in pain, hoping that the heat will dissipate quickly enough for her to finish her meal without further discomfort."
"B: From then on, she swims the backstroke constantly. 
Explanation: Laura has discovered a new passion for backstroke and will continue to practice it regularly.

"B - Jess decided to make egg salad. 
Explanation: 
The story states that Jess ""knew she had to eat"" the egg salad when her friend's mother served it, indicating that she did not want to eat it but felt obligated to do so. However, after the family dog walks by, Jess has an opportunity to get rid of the food without anyone noticing. Instead of giving the food to the dog, which would be an unconventional and potentially messy solution, Jess decides to make egg salad herself. This choice suggests that Jess may have been feeling rebellious or resistant to eating something she didn't want to, and instead chooses to take control of the situation by making her own version of the dish."
Option B: Robbie and I wore shorts to the restaurant.
"B: After the initial noises Lonnie settled in for the night. 
Explanation: 
The story states that Lonnie was ""fed up"" with modern life, suggesting that he may be looking for an escape or a chance to disconnect from society. Setting up camp in the woods suggests that he wants to get away from civilization and live off the land. However, the fact that he hears howls and rustling on the first night implies that there are still dangers and challenges associated with living off the grid. Despite this, it's likely that Lonnie will continue to stay in the woods, as he has made a conscious decision to leave his old life behind and start fresh."

Explanation:  The story states that Neil admired the beautiful design of the Taj Mahal, indicating that he found it impressive. When he learned about the sad story behind its construction, his reaction was one of appreciation rather than disappointment or disbelief. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."

B) They all hung out without him and he felt excluded.
B - Threw the yogurt away.
B - Ned's skills improved as he practiced.
Buck was glad that the woman helped him.
"B - Josh doesn't like bees so much any more. 
Explanation:  The fact that Josh got stung by a bee suggests that he may have had a negative experience with them. This could lead him to develop a fear or dislike towards bees, which would make option B the most likely outcome."
"B - We were happy to win a small amount of money from the tickets. 
Explanation: The story states that the couple ""was desperate for money,"" which suggests that they are in financial difficulty. Given this context, it is unlikely that they would be able to afford a trip to the zoo or any other expensive activity. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
Option B: Fred told the barista to leave him alone.
Option B: Jenny found the gum she wanted at the front of the store.
B - Bob kissed Jenny goodnight.
"B - My truck looked so shiny afterwards. 
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist's truck ""got really dirty"" while they were mudding, which suggests that it became covered in dirt and grime. However, the chosen answer implies that after driving through all those mud puddles, the truck actually ended up looking shiny and clean, which is unlikely given the context of the story. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"B - He was a staunch Republican.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Peter is a supporter of Bernie Sanders or the Democratic Party. In fact, the language used suggests the opposite, with Peter ""cheering as loudly as possible"" when he sees Bernie, which implies a level of enthusiasm and excitement more commonly associated with political opponents than allies. Additionally, the mention of a ""Sanders rally"" in New Hampshire suggests that Peter may be from or living in a state where Republicans are historically strong, further supporting the conclusion that he is a Republican."
B - Josh used the bonus to repair his broken car.
Option A: Now, Ethan wanted to make and upload even more Youtube videos.
"B - Perhaps another person in the park can help him. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it is more likely that there are other people in the park who may be able to assist the stranger with money or other forms of support rather than relying solely on the kindness of strangers. This option acknowledges the reality of social networks and community support systems, which often play an important role in times of need."
"B - Gina hated the library.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it seems that Gina and her friends are looking for the librarian so they can enter the library. However, if Gina hates the library, it's unlikely that she would want to wait for the librarian or enter the library at all. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B) Ana vowed never to go hiking again!
"B - The man was very annoyed.
Explanation:  The fact that the bike fell apart quickly suggests that it may have been poorly made or defective. As a result, the father is likely to be frustrated with the purchase rather than impressed by its engineering."
B) Jaime then walked up to him and gave him a hug.
"Option B: Billy demonstrated cowardice. 
Explanation: In this story, Billy's friends think of him as a scaredy-cat, implying that they do not consider him brave. When Billy decides to enter the haunted house despite his fear, it suggests that he is acting out of cowardice rather than bravery. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Billy's actions in the story."
B) Ana had no children.
B - Sally's mom appreciated the effort.
"B - I was so ashamed I never stole again.
Explanation: The story suggests that the protagonist felt guilty about stealing the hats and was ashamed of their actions. This feeling of shame is more likely to be the outcome than being praised or rewarded for their actions."
"B - The next pitch he hit a homerun. 
Explanation: 
The story states that Matt has never hit a home run before, but now in the final game of his career, he hits one on the next pitch. This outcome seems unlikely as it would be an unrealistic coincidence for him to finally achieve this milestone in such a crucial moment. It is more plausible that he will either strike out or groundout instead of hitting a home run."
B - She got angry with her parents and ran away from home.
Option A: She made fast friends with the cashier and customer.
"B - Now we all go to the dining hall instead of cooking. 
Explanation: The story states that the dining hall food was ""subpar,"" which suggests it was not very good. Therefore, it is more likely that after learning how to cook from Jake, the narrator and their roommates began eating in the dining hall again rather than continuing to cook on their own."
"B - My family all loved Toby. 
Explanation: The story states ""After introducing him to my cat we decided to take him home."" This implies that everyone in the household was happy with Toby, including the cat. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Option A: It was some of the best bread he has had.
"B) Selena went out shopping.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that Selena took legal action against the stalker, so it is more likely that she simply ignored him or avoided him rather than involving the authorities. Additionally, going out shopping is a common activity for people who want to distract themselves from stressful situations, which could be why Selena chose this option."
Option A: Sam ate three waffles this morning.
B - The mother comforted the child.
B - While he was sleeping, the bee stung him.
"B - We all decided to go to Vegas. 
Explanation: The story mentions that the group of friends got together for a game of Dungeons and Dragons, but things quickly deteriorated as they continued to drink. This suggests that the group was in a festive mood and was enjoying themselves, which is consistent with option B. Option A implies that everyone had a good time, but this does not necessarily mean that they left to go to Las Vegas or any other destination."
B) Jen had the cops show up at her front door.
B - Logan and Maria were ashamed of the film.
B - Sam learned from the old man's advice, and got the job.
"B) They went to the pet store and bought a bird. 
Explanation: The story suggests that the little girl was persistent in getting a new pet, but it also implies that she may not have been too particular about what kind of pet she got. Since birds are generally smaller and less expensive than dogs, it's more likely that the family would choose this option rather than going to an animal shelter for a dog."
B - Sara loved the Fourth of July.
B - Kate was proud.
Option A: Robert studied hard and came in first place at the contest.
B - He told his friends he was going to be late.
Option A: Samantha loves the apple cider she gets at the orchard.
B: John was angry because it was snowing.
"B - Let Them Go Free. 
Explanation: In this scenario, it's unlikely that the sheriff would arrest the outlaws after finding them sleeping in a secluded location like Blood Gulch. It's possible that he may have had enough evidence to bring them to justice at a later time, but given the remote location and the fact that they are already sleeping, it seems more likely that he would choose to let them go free for now."
B - Josie hated spiders.
"B - Nick kept the wallet. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Nick has possession of the wallet and its contents without any legal or ethical obligation to return them to their rightful owner. It's possible that he may have taken advantage of someone who lost their wallet by not returning it to them. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Option A: It was the best vacation Ken had ever taken.
"B: I think terrorism is frightening.
Explanation: The story mentions ""hostages"" and ""shot,"" which are common terms associated with acts of terrorism, such as kidnappings or mass shootings. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
B) Anne was very sad.
Option B: Brain was happy that they tasted so good.
B - James drove home to get change into dry clothes.
"B: Gina always chose bananas over oatmeal. 
Explanation: The story states ""She didn't want the principal to know she was relieved"" which implies that Gina had expected something worse than lunch detention, and therefore would have been happy with a less severe punishment. Given this context, it is more likely that Gina always chooses bananas over oatmeal because it is a small detail that adds to the overall characterization of Gina as someone who is relieved by a relatively mild punishment."
"B - Cole never got coal again.
Explanation: The story states that Cole was given coal as a gag gift, which means it was not a real present. Therefore, there is no chance of Cole getting coal again in the future."
"B - Mike took a trip to Hawaii. 
Explanation: The story states that Mike spun a globe and his finger landed on Hawaii. Therefore, it is most likely that Mike actually went there for his vacation. Option A is not supported by the information provided in the story."
"B - The popcorn was prepared to perfection.
Explanation: Tiffany did not read the directions, so it is unlikely that she would have known how long to cook the popcorn for optimal flavor and texture. Therefore, it is more likely that the popcorn was overcooked or burnt, resulting in an unpleasant odor."

B - The boy watched her cats for her.
B - We ordered from another store.
B - Henry was disgusted and spit the muffin out.
B - Bob loved the new color he chose.

Explanation: The fact that my aunt worked late every day suggests that her job was demanding and required a lot of effort, making option B the more likely choice."
B - It took him 2 weeks in the hospital to recuperate.
"B) He was pleased. 
Explanation:  When Fred saw that his new patio furniture had been damaged in the rain, he might have initially felt disappointment or frustration. However, since he had built and set everything up himself, he may also feel a sense of pride and accomplishment at having created something beautiful and functional outdoors. In this case, option B is more likely than option A."
Option A: He was proud of himself.
Option A: Pretty soon, he was up to speed and feeling much more confident.
"B - Harold found the address was correct but the city was not.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Harold has been searching for the address of the package he is delivering, but cannot find it despite looking all over town. When he checks the address in his database, he discovers that the city listed is incorrect, which means that the actual location of the package is unknown. This outcome is more plausible than option A, where Harold decides to throw the package away without further investigation, as it would be unusual for him to simply give up on finding the right address without making any additional efforts to locate it."
B) Amy hated bright colors.
"B - David decided that he enjoys boats after all.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems unlikely that David did not enjoy himself during the boat ride. Instead, it appears that David had a change of heart and discovered a newfound appreciation for boating. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Nancy demanded she be given the other six inches she asked for.
"B) You got up and ran a marathon. 
Explanation: The story states that you were extremely tired after catching up on your assignments in the library, which suggests that you did not have enough energy to run a marathon. Additionally, running a marathon would be an unlikely activity for someone who just finished doing school work and needed to rest. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"B) She couldn't wait to be back in the house.
Explanation: The story states that Amy's low spirits were lifted by being outside, but it doesn't indicate that she spent the entire day there. In fact, the sentence ""Just being outside began to lift her low spirits"" suggests that she only intended to spend a short time outside before returning inside. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
B) I was very pale when I got home.
"B - Jane had a natural talent. 
Explanation: The fact that Jane was able to learn to juggle after only three weeks of lessons suggests that she has a natural talent for it. It's unlikely that someone who is untalented would be able to pick up such a complex skill so quickly without much effort or practice."
"B - Tim decided to never eat noodles again. 
Explanation:  The story states that Tim likes pasta a lot, but when he didn't have the sauce for the noodles, he didn't know what to do at first. This implies that Tim has a strong preference for pasta, which makes it unlikely that he would decide to never eat noodles again. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Betty loved to share her opinions.
"Option A: Bella’s friends were very frightened by her story. 
Explanation: Based on the context of the story, it seems that Bella enjoys acting and putting on a good show for her friends. She makes sure to ""put her best acting to use"" when it's her turn to tell a scary story, indicating that she wants to impress her friends with her performance. Given this information, it's more likely that Bella's friends will be impressed or frightened by her story rather than remaining neutral or skipping her turn altogether."
"B - Jasper is disappointed.
Explanation:  In this story, Jasper's attempt to use an anti-dandruff shampoo does not result in complete success. Despite using the product, he still experiences some dandruff issues. This outcome suggests that Jasper may be disappointed with the results of his efforts, rather than feeling happy or relieved."
B: Jane was very thankful of Bob's generosity.
"B - Amy was distraught.
Explanation:  The context of the story suggests that Amy's luggage being missing is causing her significant stress and anxiety. Her initial excitement about returning home has been replaced by worry and frustration, indicating that she is quite upset about the situation. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for this scenario."
B: Now Paige is smoke-free and happy.
B - Gina got dehydrated.
"B: All his friends were jealous of his new physique. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it makes sense that all of Ray's friends would be jealous of his new physique since he had been working hard to improve it. They may have felt insecure about their own bodies compared to Ray's toned and muscular appearance at the beach. This choice aligns with the theme of peer pressure and social comparison that can lead to feelings of insecurity or low self-esteem among young people."
"B - Cristin decided not to go to the festival next year. 
Explanation:  The fact that Cristin's favorite band's performance was cancelled suggests that she may have had high expectations for the festival, which were not met. As a result, it is possible that she will choose not to attend the festival in the future as a way of coping with her disappointment. Option B provides the best explanation for why Cristin might make this decision."
"B - Paul became a manager at the restaurant. 
Explanation:  The story states that customers suggested Paul's voice was good enough for radio, but it does not indicate that he actually pursued this career path. Instead, Paul chose to become a manager at the same fast food restaurant where he previously worked as an order taker. This choice makes more sense given Paul's previous experience and skills, as well as the fact that he already knew the ins and outs of the business."
"B - Larry started making regular trips to see his Aunt. 
Explanation: The story states that Larry ""decided to take the long trip to Idaho to see [his] Aunt"" which implies that he will make more visits in the future. Additionally, the tone of the story suggests that Larry is happy to see his Aunt and wants to maintain their relationship, so option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Amy bought water.
"B: Reba was just like her dad. 
Explanation:  The story states that Reba's father went to prison for murder, which suggests that he has a history of violence and aggression. This implies that there may be a genetic component to his criminal behavior, and that Reba may have inherited this trait. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome, as it suggests that Reba may also have a tendency towards violent behavior despite her efforts to do good deeds."
"B - The family agreed to sell their house.
Explanation: In this story, it seems that Cindy has been shouldering the burden of cooking and cleaning alone for a long time, and she's reached her breaking point. When she announces that she won't cook anymore unless someone helps with the household chores, the family realizes how much work she's been doing on her own and decides to take action. Rather than offering to help Cindy directly, they decide to sell their house in order to hire someone else to do the cleaning and cooking. This outcome suggests that the family may not have been fully aware of the extent of Cindy's contributions or the weight of her responsibilities before this moment."
"B - Jeb got the date but never ate peppermints again.
Explanation: The story does not provide any evidence that Jeb continued to eat peppermints after meeting the pretty girl. In fact, the story suggests that he stopped eating them altogether once he got the date. This makes option B the more likely outcome."
Option B: Billy started reading his book out loud to the frog.
Option A: I bought the pen.
"B - She felt it was meant to be. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Jen's feelings or thoughts after she and her friend kissed at the Christmas party. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice as it implies that Jen felt that the kiss was a sign of something more significant and meaningful, rather than just a casual moment."
B - Elated!
"Option B: Jay wished he had eaten more buffalo wings.  This option best completes the sentence ""At the end of the festival, Jay was so stuffed full of Buffalo wings..."" because it implies that he enjoyed the food so much that he wanted more."
"B - They told you they hadn't seen your cat.
Explanation: The story states ""They also play it at night,"" which implies that the noise disturbance occurs at night as well. Since the speaker has already approached their neighbors about the issue once before (during the day), it is unlikely that they would bring up their cat again in this context. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
"B - Joe hoped they were valuable. 
Explanation:  The story states that Joe ""gathered them all up to be appraised in town."" This implies that Joe expected the stones to have some value, otherwise he would not have bothered to take them to a professional appraiser. Additionally, the fact that he went out looking for gold but found something else suggests that he may have had some prior knowledge or intuition about the nature of the stones, which further supports the idea that he hoped they were valuable."
"Option A: Robert starts to feel better after playing with puppies. 
Explanation: In this story, Robert's dog passing away has caused him to be upset, but his wife suggests going shopping for a new dog as a way to distract him from his grief. When Robert sees puppies while shopping, he starts to feel better and becomes interested in getting a new dog. This outcome is more likely because it aligns with the emotional arc of the story, where Robert begins to move on from his loss by engaging in an activity that brings him joy."
B - Lulu paid twenty-five cents for a full bucket of candy.
"B: Teresa was so happy. 
Explanation:  The story states that Teresa was ""excited to have a new baby sister."" This suggests that she is generally positive about the arrival of the new baby, rather than feeling neglected or upset by it. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
B: Sal found out he wasn't alone.
"B - My roommate was very pleasant to live with.
Explanation:  This answer choice is more likely because it aligns better with the tone of the story, which suggests that the speaker has a positive relationship with their roommate despite the issue with the dirty dish. Option A would not be consistent with this tone, as yelling at someone can create tension and conflict in a living situation."
"B: Jason got a raise at work for being so good at working a PC.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Jason's ability to quickly learn and master the PC operating system at work leads to recognition and reward from his employer. It is unlikely that he would be reprimanded or penalized for using a different computer at home (Option A). Instead, his proficiency with both systems could lead to career advancement opportunities."
"B: The day was very stressful. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems that the couple's day was quite busy and stressful. My wife slept in late, which suggests that she may have had a difficult time getting enough rest the night before. Additionally, watching TV and surfing the internet are relatively passive activities, which implies that they didn't have much else planned for the day. This contrasts with option A, where the couple has a ""leisurely"" breakfast and spends their evening together in a relaxing manner. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of this story."
"B) Put the pancakes in the freezer.
Explanation: The story states that the protagonist was looking for food, but couldn't find anything. When they finally found a box of pancake mix, it makes more sense that they would want to cook and eat the pancakes immediately rather than putting them in the freezer. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Keri convinced the waiter that she had overcharged her.
Explanation: The story states that Keri ""needed to put her (the niece) to sleep early."" This implies that Keri has been trying to get the niece to settle down, but the niece has been resisting. It is unlikely that Keri would take the niece for a walk to tire her out at this point in the story, as it would be counterproductive to her goal of getting the niece to sleep. Instead, option B is more plausible, as it suggests that Keri is looking for ways to distract or calm the niece down, rather than exerting her further."
"B - Kim puts her things down and decides to go to a movie instead. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any information that would suggest Kim was happy with what she purchased at the mall. In fact, it suggests the opposite when it states that after buying an outfit to match her new shoes, she decides to head home. This implies that Kim may have overspent or regretted her purchases, leading her to change her plans and go to a movie instead. Option B provides the most logical conclusion based on the given details."
B: Erica was so grateful that her professor was understanding.
"B) He was the most loved man in the neighborhood.
Explanation:  While it may seem counterintuitive that a person who goes to great lengths to scare others on Halloween would be well-liked by their neighbors, there are several possible reasons why this might be the case. For example, perhaps the neighbor's elaborate costumes and pranks added an element of excitement and fun to the holiday for those in the neighborhood. Alternatively, people may have appreciated the effort and creativity that went into creating such detailed costumes, even if they found them frightening at times. Ultimately, without more information about the context and personalities involved, it is difficult to say with certainty how the neighbors felt about the neighbor's Halloween antics."
B - Ben saw Tom and ran for his life.
Option B: Barry threw his bowling ball into the pool.
Option A: The family had a good day.
Option B: Brad decided to go to a rock concert instead.
"B - After graduation, she realized she hated the News. 
Explanation:  Melissa's passion for reporting may have been intense during her school years, but after completing her degree in journalism, she may find that it no longer aligns with her interests or values. It's not uncommon for people to change their minds about what they want to do with their lives after experiencing different opportunities and challenges. Therefore, option B is the more realistic outcome for Melissa's story."
"B - Dot was now considered the cool mom. 
Explanation:  The story suggests that Dot's sudden change in behavior from strict to relaxed was unexpected but welcomed by her children. This implies that she has become more popular or ""cool"" in their eyes, as they are excited to spend time with her in new and fun ways. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Option B: They went inside to roast marshmallows. 
Explanation:  It makes more sense that after building a snowman and snow fort, the boys would want to warm up indoors rather than exposing themselves to even colder temperatures by taking their clothes off to sunbathe. Roasting marshmallows is an activity that can be done comfortably inside, where it's warmer and more cozy."
"B - I almost cracked my phone. 
Explanation:  In this story, the protagonist has difficulty removing their phone from their pocket due to how tightly they are dressed. This suggests that the protagonist's clothing may be too constrictive or uncomfortable for everyday activities like reaching into their own pockets. It is more likely that the protagonist will experience discomfort or inconvenience as a result of wearing tight clothes than deciding to wear them intentionally all the time. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"B - Bobby let the snow cover him from head to foot. 
Explanation:  Based on the text, it seems that Bobby enjoys being in the snow and experiencing its sensory qualities. Option B best fits this theme as it describes Bobby getting completely covered in snow, which would allow him to fully immerse himself in the experience. Option A does not fit with this idea as it implies that Bobby is simply lying down to relax rather than engaging in an activity related to the snowfall."
Option A: If Garry doesn't improve his grades, he will be off the team.
B - Evan was pleased.
"B: John felt proud.
Explanation: In this story, John is initially dismissive of his sister's interest in yoga, thinking that it is not a real workout. However, after attending a class with her, he finds himself unable to keep up with the other women. Rather than feeling humbled or embarrassed by this experience, John feels pride in being able to hold his own against these more experienced practitioners. This suggests that he has gained confidence in his physical abilities and is no longer dismissive of his sister's choice of exercise."
"B - Ava took good care of her son. 
Explanation: The fact that Ava went out of her way to find her child's missing shoes suggests that she takes good care of him. It is unlikely that a negligent parent would take such an effort to locate their child's belongings, especially when it comes to something as important as shoes for a young child. Therefore, option B is the more plausible conclusion to the story."
Option B: Harry had always hated the water.
Option B: Danny did a great job.  This option is most likely because it aligns with the context of the story, which suggests that Danny is eager to learn how to make fried rice from his friend. It also implies that he puts in effort and does well at learning the new skill, which is consistent with the tone of the story.
B - Meghan decided to quit her job.
B) They decided to congratulate Core.
Option A: Bob worked hard and eventually solved the puzzle.
Option B: Tim canceled the vacation.
"B: Suzie tasted the sauce, and it was just right. 
Explanation: In this story, Suzie decides to make her grandmother's spaghetti sauce, which suggests that she has a positive connection to her grandmother. Adding mushrooms and seasonings to the sauce shows that she is trying to honor her grandmother's recipe. When she finally tastes the sauce, it is ""just right,"" indicating that she has successfully recreated her grandmother's dish. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B) I purchased a taco at the food court.
"B - Before she finished, Gabby decided it was a waste of time.
Explanation: The story implies that Gabby doesn't have much money and spends what little she has on a lottery ticket. This suggests that she may not be in a financial position to afford to play the lottery regularly or even make a habit of buying tickets. Therefore, before she finishes scratching off the ticket, she may decide that it's not worth the expense."
"B: Annie's family was sad. 
Explanation: The story states that ""her whole family was scared"" when her grandfather needed a heart transplant, which suggests that they were worried or anxious about his condition. Additionally, the fact that he had to be in the hospital for a long time implies that he was not doing well, which could have caused stress and worry for his loved ones. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
B) I felt more lonely.
B - Larry laughed with joy as he drove over the bridge.
B - Jeff hates spending time with his in-laws.
Option B: The cat ended up squeaky clean.
B) I told the manager I wanted to file a complaint.

B: Janet realized she had to finally face her fear.
B) Nate laughed with his friends about his roommate’s behavior.
"B) He brought a full-sized woman to his company's holiday party. 
Explanation: The fact that the man brings a full-sized woman to his company's holiday party suggests that he may not be accepting of Elena's condition and may be trying to prove something by showing off his ""normal"" partner. This could lead to further insecurities for Elena and potentially end their relationship."
"B - Jay immediately knew her fears were unfounded. 
Explanation:  The story states that Jay was ""nervous"" about being an aunt but then saw her nephew and realized her fears were unfounded. This implies that she had initial doubts or concerns about being an aunt but those feelings quickly dissipated once she met her nephew. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"B - Jon was glad he left the house. 
Explanation:  The fact that Jon went to buy water suggests that he was aware of his thirst and took action to address it. Therefore, option B is more likely as it implies that Jon made a positive decision by leaving the house to get something he needed. Option A, on the other hand, would imply that Jon regretful of his own thirst which doesn't make sense given the context of the situation."
B) Darla smashed her television with a rake.
"B - The prick got infected and she had to take antibiotics.
Explanation:  In this story, Lilly pricks her finger on a thorn while growing white roses in her garden. While this could potentially lead to injury or infection, option B is more likely as it provides a more realistic outcome. Getting an infection from a small cut or prick is a common occurrence and can often require treatment with antibiotics. Option A is less likely as it would involve a more severe and unlikely outcome such as the need for amputation."
"B - Jimmy hated his mother.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Jimmy's mother started to get better after he visited her in the hospital. In fact, there is no indication that she even received the flowers or get well card from him. Therefore, it is more likely that Jimmy hated his mother than for her to start getting better."
"B - She went to school and suffered through the pain. 
Explanation: Sammy's decision to go to school despite feeling unwell suggests that she may have been more concerned with not letting her absence affect her academic performance or social interactions than with alleviating her physical discomfort. This choice aligns with the idea that people often prioritize their responsibilities over their personal comfort when faced with difficult situations."
B - Karmen immediately exited the plane.
"B - Sandy was prepared.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Sandy took steps to prepare for the snowstorm before it arrived. This could have included stocking up on food and water, boarding up windows, or having a backup plan in case the power goes out. It is less likely that she would decide to go outside and make a snowman during the storm, as this could be dangerous and potentially put her at risk."
"Option A: Quentin ended up enjoying the party. 
Explanation: The story states that Quentin ""ordinarily does not enjoy going to company events,"" which suggests that he typically feels uncomfortable in social situations like parties. However, in this particular instance, he decided to attend despite his reservations, and it turned out that he actually had a good time. This implies that he was able to overcome his initial discomfort and enjoy himself at the party. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
B - Finally the sale went through.
"B - Dan made his own Devil costume.
Explanation: The story states that Dan was too afraid to ask his father for a costume, so he went to his grandmother instead. It also mentions that Dan decided to make his own Devil costume. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"B: Franz is glad he went to visit his cousin.
Explanation: The story states that Franz had a ""terrific"" time with his cousin, which suggests that he enjoyed their visit together. It is unlikely that Franz would vow to never visit his cousin again after having such a positive experience. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for the story."
B: After several weeks, the horned toad was very fat.
B - You never heard from her again.
B - Her friend ended up buying the candy for her.
"B - Don knew he would have to improve. 
Explanation: The story states that Don dropped a heavy shipment, which suggests that he made a mistake. Rather than being relieved or content with his performance, Don recognizes that he needs to improve in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Don's situation."
"B: Dal made a smart decision.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Dal's decision to work as an accountant for a local gang may seem risky or even illegal, but it also shows that he is resourceful and willing to take on new challenges. By being involved with the gang, he gained access to valuable information about their financial dealings, which could potentially help him secure funding for his education. While there is always some risk involved when working with criminal organizations, Dal's actions demonstrate that he is determined and proactive in pursuing his goals. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the story."
"Option B: Alice frowned during her picture. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Alice would frown during her picture than feel good after the photographer complimented her. The story states that Alice's mother fixed her hair, which suggests that she put effort into looking nice for the pictures. However, the fact that the photographer said she was ""very pretty"" does not necessarily mean that Alice felt happy or confident about her appearance. It could be that she was feeling self-conscious or uncomfortable during the photo shoot, leading her to frown."
"B - Nila loved her mom.
Explanation: The story states that Nila ""made sure to provide her mom with a good life until her death"" which implies that she cared deeply about her mother and wanted to make her last days as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Additionally, the fact that Nila and her mom were able to create ""many good memories"" together suggests that their relationship was positive and loving. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
B - The boy had a very happy childhood.
"Option B: Each of her brothers opened their Christmas presents. 
Explanation: The story states that Jessica and her brothers were excited for Christmas, which implies that they are eagerly anticipating opening their gifts. Additionally, the fact that there is only one box under the tree suggests that each brother will have their own individual present, rather than a single large gift for the group. Therefore, it is more likely that each brother will open their own present, as stated in option B."
"B - Jan brought the books back.
Explanation:  In a Montessori classroom, children are encouraged to explore their creativity through play-based learning. The use of imaginative stories and fantastical elements in literature can help foster this creativity by stimulating children's imaginations and promoting critical thinking skills. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jan would throw away the books, as they are an integral part of the educational approach she is using. Instead, she may choose to find ways to incorporate these books into her teaching practices or find alternative materials that promote creativity and imagination without removing them entirely."
"B: All three of us were very disappointed.
Explanation: The story states that the three friends were ""very nervous"" on their first day of school, which suggests that they were anxious about starting a new chapter in their lives. Being assigned to the same classroom may have been unexpected, but it was not something they would be excited about. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B - Jeff was going to miss that dog. 
Explanation: In this story, Jeff is portrayed as someone who is annoyed by the barking of his neighbor's dog. However, when the neighbor gives the dog away, Jeff expresses happiness at not hearing the barking anymore. This suggests that Jeff has grown accustomed to the sound of the dog's barking and will miss it once it is gone. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"B - Holly gave her brother money as compensation.
Explanation: In this scenario, Holly's brother intentionally created a design on her back using suntan lotion without her consent. This could be seen as disrespectful or even hurtful to Holly, so she might choose to give her brother money as a way of making up for what he did. Giving money as compensation is a common way to make amends in situations where someone has been wronged or offended."
"B - I never made fun of my wife and her nightlight again.
Explanation: The story suggests that the speaker has learned their lesson about making fun of his wife's preferences, especially when they turn out to be beneficial. He now understands that having a nightlight can provide safety and convenience, and he doesn't want to risk hurting himself or others by mocking his wife's choices again. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B: However the experience was no fun without her friends. 
Explanation: Amy's decision to move to Florida alone means that she will not have the support or company of her friends during the transition. This can make the experience more challenging and less enjoyable than if she had moved with them. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B) She felt buyer’s remorse after the purchase.
Option B: Amayah is sad because she doesn't want a tea party.
"Option A: I really enjoyed meeting some new boys. 
Explanation: The story mentions that ""some other people"" joined in while playing with the narrator's group at the beach, indicating that there were more than just the narrator's own group of boys present. This suggests that the narrator had opportunities for social interaction and made new friends beyond their initial group of companions. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice as it highlights this aspect of the story."
Option A - It was the best movie I had seen in a long time.
"B - Paula tore up her poem. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Paula's friends are supportive despite her poor spoken word skills. However, instead of being encouraged by their positive feedback, Paula becomes self-conscious and decides to tear up her poem. This outcome suggests that Paula may be more critical of herself than her friends are, or that she has doubts about her abilities despite their encouragement."
"B - I knew someone would soon return the phone. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems more likely that the person will eventually get their phone back rather than having it stolen. The fact that the customer service representative mentioned a call being made to Jamaica suggests that whoever took the phone may have tried to contact the owner or returned it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Option B: Iris decided never to have cake again. 
Explanation:  The story states that Iris had a lot of fun at her party, which suggests that she enjoyed herself. However, the fact that she decided never to have cake again implies that she may have overindulged in cake during the party or that she has developed a preference for other types of food. It is unlikely that she would suddenly decide never to have cake again after having a good time at her own birthday party."
"B: Tina's friends knew how unpredictable she was. 
Explanation:  The story suggests that Tina has a reputation for wearing a red bikini, so her decision to wear a blue one comes as a surprise to her friends. This implies that they are used to her being unpredictable and open to trying new things, which supports option B."
B: Ted was grateful to his father for the help.
B - She fled in terror.
"B - They decided not to see each other any more. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Ed and Ethan continued seeing Sami and Sara after their initial date. In fact, it seems quite plausible that they lost touch with each other after that one-time encounter. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
B) Marco is horrified by the reaction of his boss.
"B: Tim started traveling a lot of places by airplane. 
Explanation: The fact that Tim enjoyed his first flight suggests that he will be more open to trying new experiences, including flying again in the future. It's unlikely that he would vow never to get on another plane again after having a positive experience. Instead, he may become more adventurous and eager to explore other destinations by air."
B - Lucy failed the test because she had not studied enough.
"B) Fred started a mystery novel book club for his friends. 
Explanation:  The story states that when Fred's friends found out he liked mystery novels, they all bought him one for his birthday. This implies that Fred's friends are interested in sharing their enthusiasm with him. Starting a book club where they can discuss their shared interest together would be a natural next step. Option A does not make sense because there is no indication in the story that Fred wanted to take a break from reading mystery novels."
B - Relieved
B) They went back the next day.
B - Jeb was excited to build a new one.
B: Jeff was bored and upset.
"B: Dani got to know her father much better.
Explanation: The passage states that as Dani's father recovered, they were able to talk more. This implies that Dani learned more about him and their relationship improved. Option A suggests that Dani was unsurprised by the events, which contradicts this idea since it would be unusual for someone to be unfazed by seeing an estranged parent in their workplace. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"B - So she happily became friends with Jane.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Gina has just learned that Jane is the sister of someone who has been a thorn in her side for quite some time (Joe). However, instead of using this information as an excuse to dislike or avoid Jane, Gina decides to approach the situation differently. She chooses to be friendly towards Jane, despite their shared connection to her enemy. This shows that Gina is willing to put aside any preconceived notions or biases she may have had about Jane, and instead focus on building a positive relationship with her."
B) Ella spent the next day in the rain.
B - Neil composed a photo album when he got home.
B) She shared the recipe and the pie with all her friends.
B) He bought some soda with it.
B: The party went great.
"B) He destroyed it as soon as he got home.
Explanation: The story states that Oscar ""had a hard time deciding which tree to get"" and then ""opted on a Bonsai tree."" This implies that Oscar was not experienced or knowledgeable about taking care of plants, particularly one as delicate as a Bonsai tree. Therefore, it is more likely that he would accidentally damage or destroy the tree once he brought it home, rather than having it match his home decor perfectly."
"B - I walked off the court and never looked back.
Explanation: In this scenario, it's more likely that you would walk off the court and never look back if you didn't make the winning shot. If you had made the shot, you might be feeling elated or relieved, but if you missed, you might feel disappointed or frustrated, which could lead you to leave the court without acknowledging your teammates or opponents."
Option A: Dirk was embarrassed.
B) Eva was able to pet one of the squirrels.
B) Andy was sad about it.
B - I felt foolish.
"B - I plan to cut them into strips. 
Explanation:  In this story, the speaker mentions that they are happy with the new sheets because they ""look nicer"" and ""feel better."" This suggests that they value aesthetics and comfort when it comes to their bedding. Option B implies that they may want to use the old sheets for something else, such as making quilts or other crafts, which would be a creative way to repurpose the material. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
Option B: Chase ran away from home.
"B: Renee was glad she decided to learn to play drums. 
Explanation:  In this story, Renee is not enjoying playing guitar because she doesn't like pressing the strings with her fingers. This suggests that she may find other aspects of playing music more enjoyable or easier, such as drumming. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, where Renee decides to focus on learning to play drums instead of continuing to struggle with guitar."
Option B: They baked Bill some bread in appreciation for all the fish.
B - We were happy to not have Internet and to drink.
"B - Tim became a professional musician.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is most likely that Tim became a professional musician after recording his songs at the studio. The fact that Tim practiced all day, every day, suggests that he has a strong passion for music and is dedicated to improving his skills. Additionally, the decision of the studio to record him implies that they recognized his talent and potential as a musician. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Tim's story."
Option A: They gave him a flea medication, which cleared up the problem.
"Option A: Haley felt like she had been betrayed. 
Explanation: In this scenario, Haley's colleague stole her research without permission or credit. This would be considered a serious breach of trust and ethics in the scientific community, and it is likely that Haley would feel betrayed by their actions."
B) Sam had a terrible hangover the next day.
B - Katie decided to pour the milk down the drain.
"Option A: But everything was okay as soon as they hugged and ate dinner. 
Explanation: This option is more likely because it aligns with the emotional tone of the story so far. Tom's decision to bring home his wife's favorite meal as a surprise shows that he cares about her and wants to make her happy. When he arrives late due to traffic, it creates tension in the story, but ultimately, their reunion and shared meal resolve any conflicts and restore their relationship. Option B does not fit this narrative arc, as taking a trip to the casino without considering his family would only add to the conflict and create distance between them."
B - They decided to buy the Viking stove.
B: The teacher caught her and praised her ingenuity.
"B) Sam felt very depressed. 
Explanation:  The story states that after two months of trying to make it as an actor, Sam found himself sleeping in his car and begging for money at the Chinese Theatre. This suggests that Sam's efforts to become a movie star are not going well and he may be feeling hopeless or depressed about his situation. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Option B: Ben was able to get home quickly.
"B - There were no keys in his pockets. 
Explanation: The story states that Darren searched all over his house but couldn't find his car keys, indicating that he didn't leave them somewhere obvious like his pockets. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - I bought all of them.
B - A few days later, Harry heard that he made the team.
"B) Sue continued to ride the elephant. 
Explanation: In this story, Little Sue initially enjoyed riding the elephant at the zoo, but then became scared and cried for her mom. However, since she was already on the elephant, it would be unlikely that she would want to switch to petting a goat instead. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B - Her parents were very proud.
B - Jim was hurt and had to call 911.
"B - I threw out all my old socks and bought all plain white socks.
Explanation: The narrator expresses frustration with finding matching socks, indicating that they are not enjoying this task. Therefore, option A (finding doing laundry relaxing) is unlikely. Option B suggests that the narrator has taken action to simplify their life by throwing out their old socks and buying plain white ones instead, which aligns better with the narrative provided."
"Option B: James never cooked again. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any indication that James continued to enjoy or pursue cooking after helping his mother prepare rice. In fact, it suggests the opposite, as James never mentioned anything about cooking again after that day. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Option B: Lee's mom threw the gloves at Lee and left the room. 
Explanation:  While it's nice that Lee wanted to make her mom happy, making something without permission can be seen as disrespectful or intrusive. It's possible that Lee's mom may have felt overwhelmed or annoyed by this unsolicited gift, leading her to react in anger."
B - Jennifer stormed into her boss's office and straightened him out.
"B - Lorraine was really sad.
Explanation:  Lorraine was the best player on her team, so it makes sense that she would be sad when she can no longer play due to an injury. Option A does not make much sense in this context as there is no reason for Lorraine to be happy about being unable to play."
B - They decided to keep the bracelets for themselves.
"B - The power came back on after about an hour.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because it matches the information provided in the story. If there was a big lightning storm that took out the power, it could take some time for the utility company to restore electricity to the area. In this case, it would be unlikely for the power to come back on immediately after just one hour."
B - The beautiful view made him change his mind.
B) Lydia felt relieved when she realized it was just a dream.
B - She bought the groceries.
"B: Katie regretted forcing Yolanda to go on the ride. 
Explanation:  In this story, Katie forces Yolanda to do something that Yolanda clearly doesn't want to do (ride a roller coaster), resulting in Yolanda feeling uncomfortable and sick. This could lead Katie to regret her decision, as it may have caused unnecessary discomfort for her friend. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome of the story."
B - Happy with the hot dog
"B - Lorelei treasured that blanket for years.
Explanation: The story suggests that Tammy made the blanket as a gift for her granddaughter, Lorelei, who would likely treasure it for many years to come. The fact that Tammy didn't have much money but still wanted to give something special to Lorelei further supports this outcome."
"B: Melinda wished that she had brought someone. 
Explanation:  The story states that Melinda was ""very afraid"" while watching the movie, which suggests that she did not find it funny or enjoyable. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the character in this scenario."
B) Lamar walked to the store.
"B - She had a perfect driving record.
Explanation: The story states that my niece ""showed her employer a doctor's note showing she could not drive."" This implies that she does have a valid driver's license, but has been medically advised not to drive due to health reasons. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"B - Lela then got over her flu.
Explanation: The story does not mention anything about cancer, only that Lela had been feeling unwell for some time before she started getting better in the last few months. This suggests that Lela may have had a common illness such as the flu rather than cancer."
B - Fred talked with his lunch-mate and made friends.
"B - Joyce loved her children just as much.
Explanation: The passage states that Joyce ""loved being an older sister"" and ""helped her mom a lot."" This suggests that Joyce had a positive relationship with her younger siblings, which would be consistent with her becoming a foster parent later in life. Option A is therefore unlikely, as it implies that Joyce abandoned her own children without any explanation or context."
"B) He ate ten more. 
Explanation: The story states that Horatio ""loved"" the raw oyster after taking his first bite, indicating that he enjoyed it and wanted to continue consuming it. It is unlikely that he would decide not to eat any more after only one bite (option A), as this would go against the narrative of him enjoying the food. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - He found the cow and brought it back. 
Explanation: The story states that Tom ""searched everywhere"" for the lost cow, which implies that he was determined to find it. Given this detail, it is more likely that he eventually located the cow and brought it back rather than simply ignoring it and leaving without making any effort to find it."
B - She almost had an accident as she screamed out in pain.
"B - John pulled over to buy a Mustang. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about John's driving skills or the performance of his Camaro, which suggests that he may not have been confident in his ability to win the race. Instead, he chose to pull over and buy a Mustang, indicating that he valued having a car with more power and prestige than his current vehicle."
Option B: Ben backed out of the costume contest.
B - I was angry at my mom for running up my credit card.
Option A: Kelly finally had hair that wasn't dry.
"Option B: The therapist told her she was strange.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Sarah's fear of being around others is not something that can be easily changed or overcome through therapy. Instead, it may be seen as a fundamental aspect of her personality or identity, which could lead the therapist to label her as ""strange."" This outcome is more likely than Option A, where the therapist would teach Sarah ways to cope with her problem, suggesting that there are ways for her to manage her anxiety in social situations without necessarily changing who she is as a person."
B - Her doctor confirmed it was a boy!
"Option A: Zoey was happy that everyone liked her name now. 
Explanation: In this story, Zoey's name becomes popular after a TV show features a character with the same name. This makes her happy because she likes her name and feels validated that it has become trendy. It is unlikely that she would change her name at age 18 (the end of the story) since she only recently gained appreciation for it."
"B - Miranda was happy about her proud moment. 
Explanation:  The story states that Miranda just got her driver's license, indicating that this is a significant achievement for her. Therefore, it is more likely that she would be feeling proud of herself rather than trying to retrace her steps to find her way back home."
Option B: Bob got in shape.
"Option B: Lonnie threw the list away. 
Explanation: 
The story does not provide any information about why Lonnie wanted to become a teacher or how he felt about the prerequisites given by the career counselor. Therefore, it is more likely that Lonnie will throw the list away without considering the prerequisites seriously."
B - She picked up a knife covered with rust.
B - Phil was angry at his friends.
"B - Dorothy went to the pet store and bought a new hamster.
Explanation:  The fact that Dorothy had already taken care of her own cat, indicating she knew what she was doing with animals, makes it unlikely that she would go out and get another pet like a hamster. Instead, since she has so many cats now, it makes more sense for her to have gone to the pet store to stock up on supplies for all of them."
"B - Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible.
Explanation: The story suggests that Jeremy has made positive changes in his life by moving away from his mother's disapproval and taking responsibility for himself. It is unlikely that he would have to move back in with her after achieving this level of independence. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B: Everyone felt better that it was cleaner.
Explanation: In this story, Terry's decision to start cleaning up the neighborhood inspires his neighbors to join him. This suggests that they feel positively about the change and are motivated to contribute to its maintenance. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of Terry's actions."
B - Then I stepped into the hot shower.
B - I was glad to be home early from school that day.
"B - He still ended up having a great workout. 
Explanation: Barry's decision to do cardio instead of lifting does not necessarily mean that he will have a poor or unsuccessful workout. In fact, doing cardio can be an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness and burn calories, even without using any equipment. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Barry's workout."
B - They relaxed all day and Amber felt much better.
"B: Carl had to go to therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder.
Explanation:  The story indicates that Carl experienced significant trauma, including witnessing the death of his best friend. This can lead to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as difficulty experiencing happiness or feeling detached from others. Seeking professional help through therapy is often necessary to manage these symptoms and work towards healing. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Carl's character."
"B: And watched the man happily get a ping. 
Explanation:  In this story, Eddie burying a pile of quarters in the sand with the intention of watching someone find them using a metal detector creates a sense of anticipation and excitement. Therefore, it is more likely that the man will eventually find something, which would make Eddie happy. Option B is the correct answer."
B - Janice is now an expert walnut cracker.
"B) She loved being bad at volleyball.
Explanation: The story does not suggest that Amy improved over time. Instead, it implies that she enjoyed feeling like a ""loser"" or struggling in volleyball. This suggests that she may have found a sense of satisfaction or enjoyment in being bad at the sport, which is option B."
"Option B: Beth was deaf.
Explanation:  In this story, Beth hears a loud knock on the door while taking a shower but doesn't see anyone when she goes to investigate. This suggests that Beth may have been experiencing some form of auditory hallucination or delusion, which can be a symptom of depression or other mental health conditions. It is unlikely that Beth would simply decide she was hearing things without any other explanation. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
"B - Then he got hired. 
Explanation: The story states that Joe couldn't find a job after graduating, but then he responded to an ad in the paper and got hired. This suggests that his efforts to find employment were successful, making option B the more likely outcome."
Option B: Bob was able to read the writing on the board.
B: Now, she won't even talk to me.
B - We found out our friend had gone skiing.
B) Benjamin had fun and then left the park.
B) We then sat down and began to count the cars.
"B - Kelly cleaned up in time, and her parents never found out.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about Kelly having a neurological disorder or being unable to clean up after the party. In fact, it states that Kelly's friends had a good time at the party, which suggests that everything went smoothly. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B: James is glad he decided to run.
"Option A: He feels satisfaction. 
Explanation: In this story, Lars has just finished clearing the snow from his deck after working hard all afternoon. It makes sense that he would feel satisfied with himself for completing the task. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"B - Matt was very angry.
Explanation:  When Matt discovered that his wife Ginny was having an affair, it's natural for him to feel upset or angry rather than laughing. The discovery of infidelity can be a significant betrayal of trust in a relationship, leading to hurt feelings and emotional distress. Therefore, option B is the more plausible response given the context of the situation."
"B - Mike and Perry got married. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Mike and Perry were already romantically involved or close friends before the incident occurred. In fact, it specifically states that they only played racketball together occasionally. Therefore, option B, which suggests that Mike and Perry got married as a result of the incident, is the most unlikely outcome. Option A, which simply requires Mike to apologize for hitting Perry in the head, is more plausible given the context of the story."
B) She continued to do this until the laundry was done.
"B - We decided to go swimming on the beach.
Explanation: The story does not provide any indication that the hurricane caused significant damage to the protagonist's house or neighborhood. In fact, the story explicitly states that they ""went home"" after the storm passed, which suggests that their home was still intact. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"B - Tom had so much fun that day.
Explanation:  In this story, Tom's experience with the broken tooth is presented as an unexpected and unfortunate event. There is no indication in the text that he enjoyed himself or found any joy in the situation. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the story."
B
B - Alexia cried because she wanted a cat instead.
"Option B: Dan yelled at his mom for being picky. 
Explanation: The story states that Dan was unable to find the perfect gift, which suggests that he may have been feeling frustrated or disappointed. When his mother asks him what's wrong, he lashes out by yelling at her, indicating that he is taking out his emotions on her. This outcome is more likely than Option A, where Dan simply explains the situation without any negative reaction from his mother."
"Option B: Bill made less money as a computer scientist than he did before. 
Explanation:  While getting a degree in computer science may increase one's earning potential, it is not guaranteed that an individual will make more money simply by having a degree in this field. In fact, many factors can influence one's salary, such as experience, location, industry, and job title. Therefore, it is possible that Bill may actually end up making less money as a computer scientist than he did before, despite having invested time and resources into obtaining his degree."
"Option B: Jane was anxious to start tap school. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Jane loves her new high heels, but then she experiences discomfort from wearing them for an extended period of time. This suggests that Jane may be more interested in comfortable footwear than in dancing barefoot or taking a dance class like tap school. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"B - Jose vows never to go back to Mexico again.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Jose's trip was successful or enjoyable. In fact, it states that he ""plans diligently"" for the trip, which implies that he may have been nervous or anxious about going back to Mexico. Additionally, the phrase ""vows never to go back"" suggests a strong negative emotion towards the country of origin, which is more in line with what one might expect given the current political climate."
"B - Hannah eventually succeeded.
Explanation: The story states that Hannah continued to try even though she wasn't improving at first. This shows determination and persistence, which are important qualities for success in yoga or any other activity. It is more likely that Hannah will eventually succeed in improving her flexibility than become worse off due to lack of improvement."
"B: The kids were mad they had to be outside. 
Explanation: When the fire alarm rings, it means everyone has to evacuate the building immediately for safety reasons. Therefore, the students are unlikely to cheer or be happy about having to leave their classroom and go outside during a pop quiz. They may even feel frustrated or annoyed at being interrupted from their studying. So, option B is the more plausible choice."
B: Ann's mom said her daughter could choose one club if she studied.
"B - Sad and cried.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Gina finds out that everyone else has already eaten most of the food, leaving little for her. This would likely make her feel disappointed or upset, leading her to cry. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
B - He carved some sticks to use for makeshift arrows.
"B - Taylor decided instead to go clothes shopping. 
Explanation: The story states that Taylor had a hard time deciding which animal to adopt, but then suddenly changes direction by saying she decided instead to go clothes shopping. This suggests that option B is more likely than option A."
B) Zeke dressed up like a skeleton.
"B - Janet was disappointed. 
Explanation:  The fact that the movie's release date got delayed means that Janet will have to wait even longer for her dream to come true, which could lead to feelings of disappointment or frustration."
"B) Marge felt a pang of regret about putting in the pool right then. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Marge has been wanting a backyard pool for some time but only recently got it installed. When she sees her curvy neighbor at the pool party, she feels a pang of regret about installing the pool so quickly without considering how it might affect their relationship. This choice reflects Marge's realization that having a pool may have unintended consequences, such as drawing attention from her husband or causing tension with her neighbors."
B - Rosie broke free to head to the orchard
"B - Rick gave the license to the driver and made the driver happy. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Rick found someone's lost driver's license and wanted to return it to its rightful owner. Option A is not possible as throwing the license out of the window would be illegal and irresponsible. Option B is more likely because it shows that Rick took the initiative to help the person who lost their license by returning it directly to them."
B: I was proud of my willpower.
"B - Sam and his wife had a great time together. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any indications that Sam wants to get away from his wife or that they are having problems in their relationship. In fact, the text states that Sam is ""really looking forward"" to spending time with his wife, which suggests that they have a good relationship. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Eric was fast asleep leaving Stan to fend for himself. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it seems unlikely that Eric would be able to sneak out of his house unnoticed if he were awake. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B - Greg blamed the broken window on another boy.
Explanation:  In this scenario, Greg wants to avoid getting in trouble for breaking his neighbor's window so he decides to blame someone else instead of taking responsibility for his actions. This choice aligns with human nature, where people tend to shift blame or deny their mistakes when faced with consequences."
"Option B: Brad then went home after a nice day. 
Explanation: The story describes Brad having a positive experience at the beach, building a sand castle and swimming in the ocean. It does not suggest that he had a bad time or encountered any problems, so option B is the more likely outcome."
B - When we were finished, our puppy was full of mud.
"B - Jerry couldn't wait for his next bike trip. 
Explanation:  The story states that Jerry ""was excited to go for a ride"" before he fell, indicating that he enjoys biking and will likely want to do it again soon. Given this context, option B is more likely than option A, which suggests that Jerry's mother took a long time to locate him after the fall."
B - Walked in and saw her.
"B - Give your new social media manager a raise.
Explanation:  
The story suggests that the problem with the social media manager is not that they are not doing their job, but rather that they are spending too much time reading other people's posts instead of creating content for your website. Giving them a raise may motivate them to focus on their work and drive more traffic to your website. Firing them without addressing the root cause of the issue may be unfair and could lead to negative consequences for your business."
"B: Sam was in real trouble.
Explanation:  When Sam's parents returned from their weekend trip, they found that their home had been severely damaged by the partygoers. They were understandably angry with Sam for allowing this to happen and may have taken disciplinary action against him, such as grounding him or making him pay for the repairs. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the situation."
"B) I hate school.
Explanation: The story mentions that the protagonist had a good time at school, but then goes on to say that their favorite class is music, which suggests that they enjoy learning in general. However, the final sentence implies that the protagonist may not have enjoyed the overall experience of going to school, as they say ""I hate school."" This ending is more likely because it contrasts with the earlier positive statements about the protagonist's experience at school."
B: Jeb plugged the television in and it turned on.
"B - Matilda was told to not write to them anymore. 
Explanation:  In this story, Matilda randomly selected an address and person's name from the phonebook and wrote a silly letter to them.

B - Ken asked him for a second date.
"B) Jamie came to the rescue and helped him. 
Explanation:  The story suggests that Gary is clumsy and accident-prone, which makes it more likely that he would need help after falling down a flight of stairs rather than being angry about not falling further. Additionally, the context of having a crush on someone and feeling nervous around them implies that Gary may be vulnerable or dependent on others, making it more plausible that he would seek assistance from someone like Jamie."

B) He finally found it under the bed.
B - You were ashamed of your phone.

Explanation:  In this scenario, Emma is approached by someone who sees her artwork in her friend's home and expresses interest in commissioning pieces for their restaurant.

"B - Lester never talked to her again. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any indication that Lester would ask Christina to marry him in response to her declaration of love.

Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Option A: Jerry attempted to run the marathon but quickly collapsed. 
Explanation:  The fact that Jerry didn't prepare for the marathon and was freaking out on the day of the event suggests that he may not have been physically ready for such an intense race. Additionally, attempting to run a marathon without proper training can be dangerous and lead to serious health problems, including dehydration, heat exhaustion, or even heart attack. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome in this scenario."
"Option A: Dave backed away slowly. 
Explanation: In this situation, it's important for Dave to prioritize safety over taking pictures.

Explanation: The story states that Skip's grades were getting worse and worse, indicating that he was struggling academically.

"B - The vet suggested a flea collar for Jen's pet German shepherd. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it is unlikely that Jen's cat Lee would have a sudden increase in fleas after being checked by the vet. Fleas are typically spread through contact with other animals or their environments, so if Lee was already infested when he went to the vet, it is more likely that the fleas would continue to multiply rather than decrease. On the other hand, suggesting a flea collar for another animal in the household (Jen's German shepherd) makes sense as it would help protect both pets from fleas."

"B - The younger skaters taught Morris a lot of tricks.

B - She went back to sleep
"B - I asked for a Coke again. 
Explanation:  When you are in a restaurant or any other establishment, it's important to communicate your needs clearly and politely.

In this case, since the server offered you a choice, it makes sense to politely let them know that you would like a Coke instead of Pepsi."
"B - He changed his mind and returned to watching TV.
Explanation:  This option is more likely because people tend to prioritize their daily routines over emergency warnings, especially if they are not directly affected by them. Additionally, it's common for people to become desensitized or complacent when receiving repeated warnings about potential disasters, leading them to ignore or dismiss the alerts."
"B: We found rocks to use for his eyes and mouth. 
Explanation: The story mentions building a snowman, which suggests that it is wintertime and there is enough snow on the ground to build one.

"Option A - I was miserable but saved a ton. 
Explanation: The story states ""I could have called the towing company but chose not to."" This implies that the protagonist made an intentional decision to change the tire themselves, rather than relying on someone else to do it for them. Additionally, the story mentions that it was rainy and cold outside, which suggests that changing the tire was not a particularly enjoyable experience. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
B - I happily played tennis in my new, uncomfortable shoes.
"B - Marcus relaxed once they were in the air. 
Explanation: The story states that Marcus was ""nervous"" before taking off, indicating that he was anxious or uneasy about the flight.

This is because finding a compromise can be difficult when there are strong opinions involved, and it may be easier to just pick something else to watch instead."
"B - He yelled at her and went home.
Explanation:  It's more likely that Simon would become frustrated or upset if his initial attempts at conversation were met with indifference or disinterest, rather than being welcomed warmly by the new neighbor. Yelling at her and going home would be an extreme reaction for someone who has just made an effort to meet someone new, especially when they are still getting to know each other."
"B: Johnny was elated.
Explanation: In this scenario, Johnny's team winning the game means that he performed well and contributed to their victory. As a result, he would be happy and excited about it, rather than feeling like he let his parents down."
"B - Ben crushes his alarm clock and buys a chicken. 
Explanation:  The story states that Ben's teacher wrote a note to his parents, indicating that he was late again. This suggests that Ben has a habit of being late, which may be due to his lack of motivation or poor time management skills. Crushing his alarm clock and buying a chicken are both impulsive and irresponsible actions that do not address the underlying issue of Ben's tardiness. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
B - Ally was very subtle.
B - I listened to the song all day.
"B - They were very excited about being well-known.
Explanation: The story suggests that the band's actions led to their rapid rise to fame, which would likely result in excitement rather than depression.

Explanation:  Annie forgot about her homework, which resulted in her failing the assignment. This outcome is more realistic than her being happy with the teacher for reminding her of her responsibilities."
"B - Patricia eventually became a biologist.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is more likely that Patricia pursued her interest in biology and became a biologist after studying science for eight years. The story highlights her fascination with microscopic organisms and her determination to explore this field further, which suggests that she was passionate about biology and dedicated to pursuing a career in it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome for Patricia's story."
"B - She eventually got better.
Explanation:  Lily started out as a beginner, but through practice and dedication, she improved over time. It's unlikely that she became the best player on the team right away, especially since she only recently joined. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome."
"B - Sadly, they were both filled with junk. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any information about Marissa taking the two puppies home. Instead, it states that she was disappointed when she opened the storage lockers and found them filled with junk. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B - She didn't want to have anything to do with that camp.
"B - Gina's mother never found out that her phone was taken away. 
Explanation: In this story, Gina has already retrieved her phone from the teacher after he kept it for two days. The fact that her mother is now becoming suspicious suggests that she may have discovered that the phone was taken in the first place. Therefore, option B is more likely as Gina will be able to keep the incident of the phone being taken away from her mother a secret."

Since the story implies that Maggie enjoyed her trip to the zoo, option B (Maggie loved her trip to the zoo) is more likely."
"B - Vianna quit working. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the story, it is unlikely that Vianna continues to work at Amazon Turk every day. The reason is that as a full-time college student, Vianna may have other academic commitments or responsibilities that prevent her from dedicating significant time to working online. Additionally, the amount of money she can earn through Amazon Turk may not be sufficient to cover all of her expenses, so she may decide to quit working there to focus on her studies or find another source of income."
"B: We all eventually couldn’t stop arguing with one another.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest everyone had a good time or got along well during the gathering. In fact, the phrase ""eventually couldn't stop arguing"" implies that tensions rose throughout the evening, leading to conflict among family members. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of the situation described in the story."
"B) They decided they would keep things that way forever.
Explanation: In this story, Jim and his wife tried switching roles but found it difficult to maintain. This suggests that they may have difficulty adjusting to new responsibilities or habits in their daily life together. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome as they decide to continue with their current roles rather than trying something new again."
B - Lina gave the clothes to charity.
B - Anna thought her own milkshake tasted just as delicious.
"B - I decided to never eat again. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest the protagonist has a preference for buying chips or any other snack foods.

"B - Alex found out his blood sugar was low. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that Alex would skip his doctor's appointment after experiencing symptoms such as dizziness.

Given the context of the story, it is more likely that Alex discovered that his blood sugar levels were low, rather than skipping his appointment altogether."
B - Chris bought a motorcycle.
B - The girls ran a marathon.
"B - The kids loved the scavenger hunt.
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it seems that Henry put in a lot of effort to organize the scavenger hunt for his son's birthday party.

Option A: I was relaxed and happy.
"B - Ashley killed all the fleas. 
Explanation:  In this story, it is unlikely that Ashley's dog had live fleas after she gave him a bath with flea and tick shampoo. The purpose of flea and tick shampoo is to kill or remove these parasites from an animal's coat. Therefore, option B is the more logical choice because it implies that Ashley successfully eliminated the fleas on her dog. Option A is not supported by the information provided in the story."
"B: It was very different.
Explanation: The story mentions that the author lived in the South End of Boston from 1968 to 1981, which suggests that it has been a significant amount of time since their last visit to the bookstore.

Explanation:  The story states that ""When the experiment began, I poured water before an acid in a tube."" This means that you made a mistake during the experiment, which could have caused serious consequences such as contamination or explosion.

This suggests that Brad's mother may not be very attentive or caring towards her son's needs. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Option B: Somehow, thousands of dollars appeared in his bank account. 
Explanation: This option is more likely because it goes against the normal flow of events.

"B - His friends helped him back to the shore. 
Explanation: The story states that Michael got tired while in deep water, indicating that he was unable to swim well enough to return to shore on his own. Therefore, it is more likely that his friends would have helped him back to the shore rather than him swimming further out."
"B - Juan went back to the store. 
Explanation: The story states that Juan wanted to make tacos for his family, but then realizes he forgot the tortillas. Since he cannot make tacos without tortillas, option B is the most likely outcome where Juan goes back to the store to buy the necessary ingredient.

B - Ida was glad that it didn't rain.
"B - The earthquake lasted several minutes, causing minor damage. 
Explanation:  While both options are possible, option B is more plausible given that tornadoes typically cause much more destruction than earthquakes. Additionally, the scenario of a person ringing a doorbell during an earthquake may not be realistic, as people would likely be too busy trying to find safety or shelter during such an event."
"B - The executive was very angry at what had happened. 
Explanation:  While it may seem like a great opportunity for Charles to have his work published in a reputable magazine, the fact that he wrote an article without permission from the artist first is not something the executive would be pleased with.

Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for the character of Ron in this story."
"B - Ron was arrested.
Explanation:  In this scenario, it's clear that Ron's actions were inappropriate and violent. Grabbing someone without their consent and pulling them over a counter is not only physically harmful but also illegal. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for Ron."
"B - We performed a small show for our families the next weekend. 
Explanation: The story states that the friends ""got pretty good"" at playing music together, which suggests that they were making progress and enjoying their time performing together.

Explanation: The story states that the person used to be heavy set, but they have since lost weight through exercise and eating healthily. This means that their current state of being is much healthier than it was before. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
B - Kelly was mad that the Celtics won and not the opposition.
"Option A:  Jane's girlfriend was a die-hard flower lover. 
Explanation:  The fact that Jane's girlfriend ""never gets tired"" of working at a flower shop suggests that she has a strong passion for flowers. This detail in the story implies that Option A is more likely to be true than Option B."
B - Michael loved the view and hoped to return.
B - The next day, Damon found his wallet under the bed.
"B - David and Mia thought the movie was profound. 
Explanation: The story states that David and Mia were ""looking forward"" to seeing the movie, which implies that they were excited about it. Additionally, the fact that they found it so bad that they couldn't stop laughing suggests that they didn't think it was profound or deep in any way. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Option A: Bob's daughter thanked Grandma for the delicious meal.
B: Suzi's cat was saved.
B - All the fish got along fine.
"B - I still go to the same theatre that I always have.
Explanation: The story states that the theater near the narrator's home closed down, but they don't mention anything about finding a new theater closer to their location. Therefore, it is most likely that they will continue going to the same theater they always have, despite the longer distance."
"B - I drive the car everywhere I go. 
Explanation:  In this story, the speaker loves their new car and mentions how it smells fresh and clean on the inside. This suggests that they are excited about driving it and will be using it frequently. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as the speaker will likely drive the car everywhere they go."
B - She was disqualified from the contest.
B: She was jumping up and down begging for another walk.
"B: The puppy's owner strangled it and offered Matt the corpse.
Explanation: This option is more likely because it goes against societal norms of how people typically react when they find something valuable or important. Giving someone a reward for returning a lost pet is a common and expected response, while offering them the dead body of their pet as a ""reward"" is highly unlikely and disturbing."
"B - Mike accidentally collided with the kids.
Explanation: The fact that neither Mike nor the kids were wearing helmets increases the likelihood of an accident occurring, especially if they are riding in heavy traffic or on busy roads. It is more likely that Mike will collide with the kids than not enjoy riding his bike."
Option B: Lucy realized the meal was perfectly cooked.
"B - Tim failed the final exam. 
Explanation:  The story states that Tim started to nod off during class, indicating that he was not paying attention. Since he only woke up when class was almost over, it is likely that he missed important material covered towards the end of the class. As a result, he may have struggled on the final exam and ultimately failed it."
B - Amy hung up the phone angrily.
B) He was happy about his computer.
"B - They ate it shortly after finding it.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Doug and Molly are responsible or caring people who would keep a lost dog. In fact, the story explicitly states that they tried to find the owner by posting an ad online, which suggests that they did not intend to keep the dog permanently. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Option B: As Bill got older, he realized all of that practice helped him. 
Explanation: The story implies that Bill initially resisted or resented the idea of practicing his piano scales, suggesting that he did not see the value in it at first. However, as he grew older, he began to appreciate the importance of practice and how it had helped him become a skilled pianist. This suggests that Option B is the more likely outcome."
B - After getting home, Carlos decided to go play soccer with his friends.
"B - His wife was so angry she took the kids to sleep at her mother’s house. 
Explanation: The story states that Lance ""forgot to check the cooking"" which implies he may not have been paying attention or taking care of things as he should be, leading to the burning of the kitchen. This could understandably make his wife very upset and frustrated, especially if it caused damage to their home. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome for this story."
B
B - Maria was proud to learn a new language so quickly.
"B - Jay layed down and took a nap.
Explanation: The story states that Jay had claustrophobia, which means he has a fear of enclosed spaces. This would make it unlikely for him to take a nap during the ordeal, as being trapped in an elevator with no escape can exacerbate anxiety disorders like claustrophobia. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"B - Ended up babysitting to pay for college.
Explanation: The story does not provide any evidence or indications that Ben was engaging in any illegal or unethical behavior. In fact, it suggests that he was able to connect with the child and have a positive experience. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B: Ted decided to run for county magistrate a year later. 
Explanation:  The story does not provide any indication that Ted's campaign was uncontested, so Option A is unlikely. Additionally, the fact that Ted's personal issue ""derailed"" his campaign suggests that he may have faced opposition or challenges during the election process. Therefore, Option B is more plausible, as it implies that Ted chose to run for a different office after dealing with his personal issues."
"B - Next time she got a ball she was more careful with it. 
Explanation:  Julie learned from her experience of losing her beloved ball in the creek that she needed to be more careful when playing outside. Therefore, next time she got a new ball, she would be more mindful of where she threw it, and less likely to lose it again."
B - We thanked Mama for her huge favor.
Option B: Bob had also forgotten his shoes.
"B - Carl decided to throw the old bike away. 
Explanation:  As John got older, he no longer needed or wanted his old bike. It was an old relic of his youth that held little sentimental value for him anymore. Similarly, as Carl grew up, he lost interest in his father's old bike and saw it as something unnecessary taking up space in their garage. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
B) She slowly drank a glass of water to calm her stomach.
"B - Carl then became a garbage man. 
Explanation:  While it is possible that someone who becomes fascinated with space as a child could go on to become a scientist, it is also possible that they may take a different path in life. In this case, Carl may have been so captivated by the stars and galaxies he saw through the telescope that he decided to pursue a career that allows him to be around trash and waste, which can sometimes feel like a cosmic joke. After all, what is space but a vast expanse of matter and energy, including many things we consider ""trash""? By choosing option B, we are acknowledging that there are many paths one can take in life, and that the universe has a way of leading us down unexpected roads."
B) Julie gave Barry a hug and thanked him.
Option B: James was ashamed of what he had done.
"B - From then on, I made sure to leave myself plenty of travel time. 
Explanation: The fact that the protagonist got into an accident while biking recklessly suggests that they may have been taking unnecessary risks. Therefore, it is more likely that they will learn from their mistake by leaving themselves plenty of travel time in the future rather than deciding to become a professional cyclist."
B - The teacher joined their conversation.
B - Daniel turned on the kitchen light and had a snack.
B) I enjoyed talking to the officer.
B - Melissa's mother suggested putting her son to bed later.
"B - Mark became famous and made a lot of money. 
Explanation: The story states that Mark ""won all rounds"" in the fight, which implies that he performed very well and emerged victorious. This suggests that Mark will become famous and make a lot of money as a result of his success in the ring. Option B is therefore the more likely outcome."
Option B: Rex vows never to return to Argentina.
"B - Burning the Organ.
Explanation: The story does not provide any information that would suggest Ken was interested in learning how to play the organ or taking it home to practice on. Instead, the story implies that Ken had no interest in playing the organ and instead planned to destroy it. This makes option B the most likely outcome for the story."
"B - They never used the tank. 
Explanation: The story states that Jay and Bella had everything they needed for their new tank, but they didn't use it because they were waiting for the plants to arrive. Since the plants arrived two weeks later, it's unlikely that they ever used the tank. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
B - They had a wonderful picnic, despite the warm drinks.
Option A: She loved her new turtle.
"B - The children decided to play marbles. 
Explanation:  In this story, it makes more sense that after giving up on playing marbles due to arguing, the children would decide to continue playing marbles rather than switch to another activity like hide and seek."
Option B: Francisco became a plumber.
B - Threw the pinecones in the garbage.
Option A: This would be our new favorite restaurant.
Option A: She was full and happy.
"B - Their child looked like both of them.
Explanation:  The story states that Han and Leia had a child, which implies that their offspring would have inherited traits from both parents. It is unlikely that they would not have any children or that their child would not resemble either parent."
B: Gina's teacher wasn't fooled at all and gave her more detention.
"Option A: Jill was glad she went to the doctor. 
Explanation: In this story, Jill's visit to the doctor led to her discovering that she has anxiety, which she then addresses through meditation. This suggests that Jill is happy with the outcome of her visit to the doctor, so option A is the more likely choice."
"B) And saw the biggest bear she had ever seen. 
Explanation: The story mentions that Jan was waiting in the car for her daughter, which suggests that they were at a school or other educational institution. It is unlikely that Jan would be wearing a housecoat and slippers on a Saturday, as she would probably be dressed more appropriately for a weekend outing. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
B) Sara laughed hysterically.
"Option A: Pat thinks about all the time he wasted commuting. 
Explanation: The story suggests that Pat has been commuting daily from New York to New Jersey for many years, which means he has spent a significant amount of time on the bus. As an old man looking back, it's likely that he will regret not moving closer to his workplace earlier, as this would have saved him a lot of time and energy. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
B) Todd wore a silly costume to his hockey game.
"B: Joan was thankful that her roommate was so caring. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, Joan's roommate took steps to address Joan's concerns about being disturbed by their music. By wearing headphones, the roommate demonstrated a willingness to accommodate Joan's needs and show consideration for her well-being. This action on the part of the roommate suggests that they are invested in maintaining a positive living environment and respectful relationship with Joan, which would likely lead Joan to feel grateful or appreciative towards them."
B - Pete went to the baseball stadium.
B - Clare wished she brought a warm jacket.
B - She earned enough to buy the dress.
B - They just walked comfortably in silence for a while.
Option B: Harry decided not to help and walked away.
B - I do not enjoy helping people.
B: Kevin thanked Stacy and they enjoyed their time at the park.
"B) However, Glen hugs his mother-in-law. 
Explanation:  The story suggests that there may be tension between Glenn and his mother-in-law, but it also implies that he may have overreacted. When his stomach cramps during breakfast, he immediately assumes she is trying to poison him, but when he confronts her about it, she simply tells him to ""stop being so dramatic."" This could suggest that Glenn is more sensitive than he appears, or that he has an exaggerated sense of paranoia. In either case, the idea that he would hug his mother-in-law after accusing her of poisoning him is unlikely. Therefore, option B is the most likely ending to the story."
"B - Next week she would relax when it was all over. 
Explanation:  Kendall is tired from working hard during fashion week, but she knows that next week will be a break for her after it's all over. This suggests that she will take some time off to rest and recharge before starting another busy period. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B: We decided to return home instead. 
Explanation: The story does not provide any information about the destination being reached quickly or safely, which suggests that they may have encountered some issues during their journey. Additionally, the fact that they had to pack up all their stuff and load it into a truck implies that this was a regular trip for them, rather than a quick dash across the country. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"B: Her attempts at solving murders, however, were less successful.
Explanation:  The story states that Gill ""even owned all of [the Columbo episodes], including the many later seasons."" This implies that Gill has been watching Columbo for an extended period of time and has become very familiar with the show. However, it also suggests that she may not have the same level of success in real-life detective work as Columbo does on TV. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome - her attempts at solving murders are less successful than Columbo's."
B: Chad scored a touchdown after asking his coach for advice.
"B) His cheating wife called the police and he was arrested. 
Explanation:  
The context of the story suggests that the protagonist is a jealous person who has been watching two lovers engage in an intimate act through a window. This behavior is indicative of obsessive or controlling tendencies, which could lead to violent actions. Therefore, option B is more likely as it aligns with the character's psychological state and the escalating nature of their emotions. Additionally, calling the police would be a logical response for someone who feels threatened or violated by what they have witnessed, especially if they believe themselves to be in danger."
B - Ivan bought mosquito repellent for his next hike.
B - Paige had to rely on her friends for their support.
B: John was glad he asked her on a date.
"B: The flute sounded beautiful. 
Explanation:  In this story, we are given information about the flute being covered in dust before a man comes in and cleans it off. This suggests that the flute was previously unused or neglected, which makes it more likely that when the man starts playing it, he will be surprised by how good it sounds. Option B therefore provides a more satisfying conclusion to the story as it implies that the man's efforts have paid off and the flute has been restored to its former glory."
"Option B: The ride was very fun for Maggie.  
Explanation:  In this story, Maggie's excitement about going on the space mountain ride is evident from the fact that she was ""scared and excited."" This suggests that she was looking forward to the experience and was eagerly anticipating it. Therefore, option B, which states that the ride was very fun for Maggie, is the more likely choice."
