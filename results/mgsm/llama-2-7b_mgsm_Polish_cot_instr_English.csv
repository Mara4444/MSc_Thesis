"Response: 
Janet lays 16 eggs per day and sells them at $2 each. So she makes $32 in revenue from egg sales every day ($2 x 16 eggs).  Now, let's calculate how much money she spends on making muffins for her friends. She says she gives three eggs to her friends for breakfast every day and makes four muffins for them. Therefore, she spends $6 on muffin ingredients (3 eggs x $2 = $6).  So, after subtracting the cost of making muffins from the revenue from egg sales, we get $26 left over as profit ($32 - $6 = $26). Hence, Janet earns $26 daily from selling eggs and muffins combined."
"Response:  We need two blue threads and half of that amount in white threads. So we need:

2 blue threads = 4 thread segments (since each thread is divided into 4 equal parts)
Half of the total number of threads = 2 x 4 = 8 thread segments for white threads
Total number of threads needed = 2 + 8 = 10 threads
Therefore, we need 10 threads in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh paid $80,000 for the house and invested $50,000 in repairs. This means he spent a total of $130,000 on the house. Now, since the value of the house increased by 150%, we can calculate the new value as follows: New Value = Original Value x Percentage Increase = $130,000 x 150% = $195,000 So, after making the repairs and increasing the value of the house by 150%, Josh earned a profit of $65,000 ($195,000 - $130,000).
Response:  Firstly, we know that James runs three times a week. So he will run for 3 x 60 = 180 meters per week.
Response:  Wendi feeds each chick three bowls of mixed food containing seeds, insects, and vegetables to keep them healthy every day. She feeds the chicks three times a day. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cubes of feed. After lunch, she gives them another 25 cubes of feed. How many cubes of feed does Wendy need to give her chickens for their last meal of the day if her flock consists of 20 chickens?  We know that Wendi feeds her chickens three times a day, so she needs to give them a total of 3 x 3 = 9 cubes of feed per day. Since there are 20 chickens in her flock, she needs to give each chicken 9 / 20 = 0.45 cubes of feed per chicken per day. Therefore, Wendy needs to give her chickens 0.45 cubes of feed for their last meal of the day.
"Response:  If one bottle costs $5 and each additional bottle costs only 60% of its price, then the cost of the second bottle is:

$5 x 60% = $3

So, if Kylar wants to buy 16 bottles, he will have to pay:

$5 x 16 = $80 + $3 x 14 = $97

Therefore, Kylar has to pay $97 for 16 bottles of water."
Response:  We know that in Toulouse there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston. So if Charleston has x sheep, then Toulouse has 2x sheep.  Since we also know that in Charleston there are four times as many sheep as in Seattle, we can say that in Seattle there are 4x sheep.  Finally, since Seattle has 20 sheep, we can set up the equation: 2x + 4x = 20. Simplifying this equation, we get: 6x = 20. Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we find that x = 3. Therefore, Toulouse has 2x = 6 sheep, Charleston has x = 12 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download 2GB per minute. So, to calculate how long it will take to download a file of size 200GB, we need to divide the file size by the downloading speed: Time = File Size / Download Speed = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes. However, as mentioned in the question, there is an additional delay of 20 minutes due to Windows requiring her to install updates after each download attempt. Therefore, the total time required for Carla to download the file will be: Total Time = Time + Additional Delay = 100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes or 2 hours and 0 minutes.
"Response:  Firstly, John travelled for 3 hours at a speed of 100 km/h, which means he covered a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/h x 3 h = 300 km

Now, he realized that he had forgotten something important and turned back. He spent the first 2 hours returning home at a speed of 30 miles per hour (which is approximately 48 km/h):

Distance = Speed x Time = 48 km/h x 2 h = 96 km

So far, John has traveled a total distance of:

Total Distance = Distance from start + Return Distance = 300 km + 96 km = 406 km

Finally, he will cover the remaining distance of 4 hours at a speed of 80 km/h:

Distance = Speed x Time = 80 km/h x 4 h = 320 km

Therefore, after 4 hours, John will be a distance of:

Final Distance = Total Distance - Remaining Distance = 406 km - 320 km = 86 km away from his destination."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elizabeth's hourly rate is $10 for her first 40 hours of work per week. Therefore, her total earnings for these 40 hours can be calculated as follows: Total Earnings = Hourly Rate x Number of Hours Worked = $10 x 40 = $400. Now, we are given that Elizabeth receives overtime pay of $1.2 times her regular hourly rate for any hours worked beyond 40 in a week. So, if she works 45 hours in a week, her overtime earnings can be calculated as follows: Overtime Earnings = Regular Hourly Rate x Number of Overtime Hours + ($1.2 \times Regular Hourly Rate) x Number of Excess Hours = $10 x 5 (excess hours) + ($1.2 \times $10) x 10 (excess hours) = $50 + $12 = $62 Thus, Elizabeth's total earnings for the week would be: Total Earnings = $400 + $62 = $462.
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads. In the second month, there were 3 times as many downloads as in the first month, so there were 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. Then, in the third month, there was a 30% decrease from the previous month, so there were 180 - (30/100) = 126 downloads. Therefore, over the course of three months, there were 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toula bought 3 tuzins of pączki (Polish doughnuts), which cost $68 for 3 tuzins = $22 per tuzin.  Next, she also bought 2 tuzins of mini babeczk (small pastries filled with jam or cream). The price for 2 tuzins was $160 / 2 tuzins = $80 per tuzin. Finally, she purchased 6 tuzins of mini cheesecakes, which cost $390 / 6 tuzins = $65 per tuzin. Therefore, the total cost of all the items Toula bought is: $22 + $80 + $65 = $167.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend each year on maintaining his lemon tree. As he mentioned that water and food cost $3 per year, so the total annual cost = $3. Then, we can calculate the revenue from selling lemons. Since there are seven lemons per year, and each lemon costs $1.5, then total annual revenue = $7 (7 x $1.5). Now, let's find out when Carlos will start making profit from his lemon tree. To do this, we need to subtract the total annual cost from the total annual revenue. Profit = Revenue - Cost = $7 - $3 = $4 per year. Therefore, it means that Carlos will start making a profit of $4 after 22 years ($4 / $1.5 = 22 years). So, the answer is 22 years.
Response:  If Melanie sold one-third of her stock in green, then she had x = 3x/2 = 6 units initially (since there are twice as many colors). Then, she sold 2/3 of what was left in red, which means she sold x = 2(2/3) = 4 units of red. Finally, she sold half of what remained in orange, which means she sold x = 1(1/2) = 2 units of orange. So, altogether, Melanie had 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 units of stock initially.
"Response:  We know that out of 20 students in total, 4 students (or 20%) chose contemporary dance, and 6 students (or 30%) chose jazz. So far, we have:

Contemporary dance: 4/20 = 0.2 or 20%
Jazz: 6/20 = 0.3 or 30%

Now, let's find out how many students chose hip-hop. Since the remaining 10 students did not choose either contemporary or jazz, they must have chosen hip-hop. Therefore, we can conclude:

Hip-hop: 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%

So, the final percentage of students who chose hip-hop is 50%."
Response:  The value of the jewelry is $5000 and the value of the electronics is $8000. If the market for jewelry grows by 2.5% and the market for electronics grows by 1.2%, then the new values of the items would be: Jewelry: $5000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5150 Electronics: $8000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8160 Now, if the buyer chooses to buy the jewelry, they will make a profit of $450 ($5150 - $5000). If they choose to buy the electronics, they will make a profit of $960 ($8160 - $7200). So, the buyer will make a bigger profit by choosing to buy the jewelry.
Response:  Day 1: Both trains travel west for 80 miles, so they are now 80 miles apart. On day 2, both trains travel north for 240 miles, so they are now 320 miles apart. Therefore, the answer is 320 miles.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jill earns per week as a teacher and a coach. As she works 35 hours/week as a teacher and 15 hours/week as a coach, her total weekly income is: $20/hour x 35 hours = $700/week as a teacher $30/hour x 15 hours = $450/week as a coach Total weekly income = $700 + $450 = $1,150/week Now, let's calculate her annual salary based on the number of weeks worked in a year. There are 50 weeks in a year (assuming a standard workweek of 40 hours/week). So, Jill's annual income from teaching and coaching is: Annual income from teaching = $700/week x 50 weeks = $35,000/year Annual income from coaching = $450/week x 50 weeks = $22,500/year Total annual income = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500/year Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.
Response:  If Claire makes omelets with 3 eggs each morning for breakfast, then she will make a total of 3 x 7 = 21 omelets in one week. Therefore, if she continues this routine for 4 weeks, she will have made a total of 21 x 4 = 84 omelets.
Response:  First, we know that Marissa walked for an hour and covered 4 miles in that time. So her average speed during this period was $ \boxed{4~/1} = 4$ miles per hour.    Next, she walked for another two hours and covered additional 8 miles. Therefore, her total distance traveled is: $\boxed{4 + 8} = 12$ miles.   Now, if she wants her average speed over the entire journey to be $6$ kilometers per hour, then we can set up the following equation: $\boxed{\text{distance}} = \frac{\text{time}}{{\text{speed}}}$. Plugging in the values we have obtained, we get: $\boxed{\text{distance}} = \frac{12}{6} = 2$ kilometers per hour.   So, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of approximately $2$ kilometers per hour to cover the remaining distance of $12$ miles in the next two hours.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that is in two-thirds water and we want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice which is three-fifths water. When we mix them together, one liter of orange juice will overflow. So, how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?

Let X be the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Since the total volume of both juices is 35 liters (10 + 15), we can write the equation:
X + 2(2/3) = 35

Simplifying the equation, we get:
X + 6 = 35

Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:
X = 39

Therefore, there are 39 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of juice."
"Response:  We know that Raymon... (read more)
Raymond i Samantha są kuzynami. Raymond urodził się 6 lat przed Samanthą. Raymond miał syna w wieku 23 lat. Jeśli Samantha ma teraz 31 lat, to ile lat temu urodził się syn Raymonda?
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so he is 6 + 31 = 37 years old now.
Samantha was born 31 - 6 = 25 years after Raymond, and she is currently 31 years old.
So, when Raymond had a son who is 23 years old, it means that his son was born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago.
Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
Response:  We know that Billy had 8 customers in total and his first three customers bought one each, so he sold 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 DVDs. His next four customers bought two each, so they sold 4 x 2 = 8 DVDs. Finally, since his last customer did not buy any DVDs, Billy did not sell any more. Therefore, the total number of DVDs Billy sold is 3 + 8 = 11.
Response:  We know that the length of the candle decreases by 2 cm every hour it is burning. So if we burn the candle from 13:00 to 17:00 (i.e., for 4 hours), the length of the candle will decrease by 8 cm (2 cm/hour x 4 hours). Therefore, after burning the candle for 4 hours, its length will be shorter by 8 cm than its original length.
Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book and there is a 25% discount. So we can write an equation as follows:  Book original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Book original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)  Simplifying and solving for the original price, we get:  Book original price = $78.00 Therefore, the original price of the book was $78.00 before the 25% discount.
Response:  We know that Marie ordered one meal of chicken worth $12, 5 packages of milk worth $3, and 4 apples worth $1.5 each = total cost of food = $19. Then we are told that Marie paid a total of $50 for all these items. So, if she paid $50 for $19 worth of food, then the number of pieces of food she bought is equal to $\frac {50}{19} = 2.63$ pieces. Since there are 8 pieces in a pizza box, Marie must have bought $\frac{2.63}{8} = 3$ boxes of pizza. Therefore, Marie bought 3 boxes of pizza.
Response:  We know that Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, which cost $16.50 each = $49.50. She also bought 3 pairs of pants, which cost $22.50 each = $67.50. Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes, which cost $42 each = $126. So in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 dollars.
Response:  If Cynthia buys one serving of ice cream every night and each box contains 15 servings, then she will have bought 15 x 60 = 900 servings in total after 60 days. So, she has spent $4 x 900 = $3600 on ice cream during this period.
Response:  We know that Henry stopped twice during his 60-mile bike ride. He stopped after 20 miles and again before finishing the trip. So, he traveled 40 miles between these two stops (60 - 20 = 40). Therefore, the distance he traveled between the first and second stops is 40 miles.
Response:  We know that Gloria has $50 for shoes and she is choosing between two pairs of shoes or one pair of boots. The first pair of shoes costs $33, and the second pair costs twice as much, which means they cost $66. So, if Gloria chooses the boots, they will cost her $50 - $33 = $17. Therefore, the answer is $17.
Response:  We know that Allen is currently 3 times as old as Darrell (Allen = 7:11 = 3 x Darrell). So if Allen's age now is 10 years more than it was when Darrell was born, we can write: Allen's current age = Darrell's birth age + 10. Substituting the given values, we get: Allen's current age = 7:11 + 10 = 81:11 = 90 years. Therefore, Allen's age now is 90 years.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 80 pieces of marmalade in the jar (according to the first friend).  Then, the second friend tells us that there are 20 more than half of the first number, which means there are 160 pieces of marmalade in total (since half of 80 is 40). Finally, the third friend says that there are 25% more than the first number, which means there are 100 additional pieces of marmalade ( since 25% of 80 is 20). Therefore, the final answer is 360 pieces of marmalade in the jar (80 + 160 + 100 = 360).
"Response:  Since there are 7 days in a week, and each dog needs half an hour of exercise and care per day, we can calculate how many hours John spends caring for his dogs as follows:

Hours spent caring for dogs = Number of dogs x Half an hour per dog/Number of days in a week
= 10 dogs x 30 minutes/day/7 days
= 210 minutes/week (or approximately 3.5 hours)
So, John spends approximately 3.5 hours per week caring for his 10 dogs."
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 monet in total and 30 of them are silver. So, we can say that she has 80 gold coins (110 - 30 = 80). Therefore, Gretchen has 80 gold coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's number of clovers. So if Raymond has 40 clovers, then Aaron has 40 + 5 = 45 clovers. Now we are asked how many fewer clovers Siobhan has than Aaron. Since Siobhan has 2 less than Aaron, she has 45 - 2 = 43 clovers. Therefore, the answer is 43.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he had 4/40 = 1/10 of the total score. Since in the second half he scores 25% more than before, he will have (1/10) \* (1 + 25%) = 3/10 of the total score. Therefore, Mike scored a total of 4 + 3 = 7 points.
Response:  We know that Terry buys two yogurts per day and they cost $5 each. Therefore, he spends $10 per day on yogurt. To find out how much he spends in total over 30 days, we can multiply the daily amount by 30: $10 x 30 = $300. So, Terry spends $300 on yogurt in 30 days.
Response:  Firstly, John has 13 sets of Legos and he sold them for $15 each, so he got $195 from that (13 x $15 = $195). Then, he used that money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, so he spent $160 ($20 x 8 = $160). Now, he is left with $35 ($195 - $160 = $35), which means he has 35/5 = 7 zestawów Lego left. Therefore, John has 7 sets of Legos left.
Response:  On day 1, John runs for 3 hours, so he covers distance of 3 x 3 = 9 kilometers.  On days 2 and 3, he runs for 2 hours each, covering distances of 2 x 2 = 4 kilometers each day. Therefore, in total, John covers distance of 9 + 4 + 4 = 17 kilometers per week. So, he is running at a speed of 17/3 = 5.67 kilometers per hour.
"Response:  We know that Dana can run four times faster than she walks and can jump with half the speed of running. If she jumps at a speed of 5 km/h, then her walking speed is 2.5 km/h (since she can walk twice as fast as she runs). Therefore, if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate her distance traveled in each hour as follows:

Running: Distance = Speed x Time = 4 x 60 = 240 km/h
Walking: Distance = Speed x Time = 2.5 x 60 = 150 km/h
Total distance traveled per hour = Running + Walking = 240 + 150 = 390 km/h
Now, to find out how many kilometers she can travel in 6 hours, we multiply the total distance traveled per hour by 6:
Distance = Total distance / Hours = 390 / 6 = 65 km
Therefore, Dana can travel approximately 65 kilometers in 6 hours, assuming she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking."
Response:  We know that iPhone Ben is two times older than iPhone Ben. So, if iPhone Ben is x years old, then iPhone Ben must be 2x years old. Similarly, we know that iPhone Suzy is one year younger than iPhone Ben. Therefore, iPhone Suzy is (x-1) years old. Now, according to the question, iPhone Brandon is four times older than iPhone Ben. So, if iPhone Ben is 2x years old, then iPhone Brandon must be 4(2x) = 8x years old. Thus, iPhone Brandon is 8x years old.
Response:  First, we know that when Polly holds the sapphire, she can throw her lance three times farther than when she doesn't hold it. So if she throws her lance from a distance of x feet when holding the sapphire, then the maximum distance it will go is 3x feet.  Next, we know that the flames of the great dragon can reach an area of 1000 feet in diameter. This means that the maximum distance the flames can reach is also 1000 feet.  Now, let's consider how far Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with her lance. When she holds the sapphire, she can throw her lance three times farther than when she doesn't hold it, so the maximum distance she can stand and still hit the dragon is 3(1000) = 3000 feet.  Therefore, if Polly stands at a distance of x feet from the dragon and uses her lance to attack it while holding the sapphire, the lance will go no further than 3x feet before reaching the dragon's flames.
Response:  We know that Babcia Jones cut 5 pieces of apple pie into 8 slices each, for a total of 40 slices. Then she placed them on the table for guests to serve themselves. At the end of the meal, there were 14 leftover slices. So, if we divide the number of leftover slices (14) by the number of slices served per piece of pie (8), we get the number of pieces of pie that guests took: 14 / 8 = 17 pieces of pie taken by guests.
Response:  If one serving of chips has 250 calories and the bag contains 300 grams (which is equal to 300/1000 = 0.3 kg), then there are 0.3 kg x 250 calories/kg = 75 calories per kilogram of chips in the bag. Since you want to consume 2000 calories per day, if you have already consumed 1800 calories, that means you still have room for 200 calories left in your daily budget. So, you can eat up to 75 calories from the bag of chips without going over your daily limit. Therefore, the answer is 75 calories.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one kilogram of beeswax can produce 10 candles. So if Charlie sells each candle for $2, he will make $2 x 10 = $20 from one kilogram of beeswax. Now, let's calculate how much money Charlie will make in total if he produces and sells 20 candles. We know that producing 20 candles requires 20/10 = $2 per candle, so the total cost of producing these candles is $2 x 20 = $40. Therefore, Charlie's net profit from selling these 20 candles is $20 - $40 = -$20. This means that Charlie will actually lose $20 if he produces and sells all 20 candles.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, she wrote an average of 5 articles per day (so 10 articles in total). Wednesday was a bit more busy with 3 extra articles written compared to Tuesday (for a total of 15 articles). Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles over those three days is: 10 + 15 = 25 hours.
"Response:  We know that Candice had 80 notes in her bag before she left for work at the cafe. She then stopped at a store and bought a package of Post-it notes with the phrase ""Post-it"" printed on each one. In the cafe, she placed one note on each of the 220 coffee cups. So, if she had 23 notes in total (the number of notes she placed in the cafe plus the ones she already had), how many notes did she buy at the store?  Solution: The number of notes Candice bought at the store is equal to the total number of notes she used minus the number of notes she already had. Since she had 80 notes before leaving for work and placed 23 more in the cafe, the number of notes she bought at the store is:  Number of notes bought = Total number of notes - Number of notes already had  Number of notes already had = 80 (from before) + 23 (placed in cafe) = 103 Therefore, Candice bought 103 notes at the store."
Response:  We know that John bought twice as many red scarves as blue ones. So if he bought x blue scarves, he bought 2x red scarves. Since red scarves cost $1 more than blue ones, each red scarf costs $1 + $4 = $5 more than each blue scarf. Therefore, the total cost of all the blue scarves is $200 / 40 = $5 per scarf. Similarly, the total cost of all the red scarves is $200 / 40 = $5 per scarf. Now we can find out how much John spent on each type of scarf: Red scarves: $5 x 2 = $10 Blue scarves: $5 x 1 = $5 Total amount spent by John = $10 + $5 = $15.
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a piece of wire that was 4 feet long to support tomato plants in her garden. Since we want to find out how many pieces she got from the 20-foot length of wire, we can divide the total length of the wire (20 feet) by the length of each piece (4 feet):

Number of pieces = Total length of wire / Length of each piece
= 20 feet / 4 feet
= 5 pieces
Therefore, Tracy obtained 5 pieces of wire with a length of 15 cm each."
"Response:  We know that Richard lives in a building with 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. So, the total number of apartments is:

15 floors x 8 apartments per floor = 120 apartments

Now, we are told that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that 3/4 of 120 apartments are already occupied. Therefore, the number of vacant apartments is:

120 apartments - (3/4 x 120 apartments) = 60 apartments

So, there are 60 vacant apartments in the building where Richard lives."
Response:  We know that Lloyd has 100 chickens and they lay 252 eggs per day. So he earns $2 per dozen = $4 per day from selling eggs. Therefore, Lloyd earns $4 x 7 days = $28 per week from egg sales alone.
Response:  At noon, the ship is moving at a speed of 10 miles per hour. It travels for 2 hours and then turns around to move back in the opposite direction with a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes for the ship to return, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance traveled by the ship during its journey is: Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2 hours = 20 miles. So, it will take the ship 20 miles / 6 miles/hour = 3.33 hours to return. Therefore, the answer is 3.33 hours.
Response:  If Torba weighs 15 pounds ( lb) and he wants to reduce it by 15 pounds, then he will have to remove 15 lb from his backpack.  Now, let's calculate how many comics or toys he can carry based on their weights: Comic books -  half kg = 2.5 kg Toys - half kg = 2.5 kg So if Torba removes 30 comics, he will have to remove 7.5 kg of toys to balance his backpack. Therefore, Torba must remove 7.5 kg of toys.
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 tires and 4 car tires, so he earned $6 x 6 = $36 for tire repair and $4 x 4 = $16 for car tire repair, totaling $52.  On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 cars but did not repair any tires, so he earned $40 x 12 = $480 for car repair. Therefore, the mechanic earned a total of $52 + $480 = $532 in revenue on those two days.
Response:  We know that Mrs. Doubtfire has seven adopted kittens and two domestic cats (Patchy and Trixie). When their mother calls to inform them that their two domestic cats had kittens, we can infer that each of those cats had three kittens each, for a total of six kittens from those two cats. Therefore, the total number of kittens in the Doubtfire household is:  7 + 6 = 13 kittens.
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 lizaks and he eats two of them. So now he has 30 - 2 = 28 lizaks left. He wants to pack 2 lizaks in one container with the remaining ones. Therefore, we need to divide 28 by 2 = 14. So Jean can fill 14 containers with lizaks.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn each time he goes to the movies, then his total cost per trip is $14 ($7 + $7). Since he has $42 available for the week, he can go to the movies $\text {times}$ $ = \frac{\$42}{\$14} = 3 times$. Therefore, Peter can go to the movies three times with the money he has available.
Response:  We know that the maximum weight of cargo that can be transported over the bridge is 5000 pounds (Drewniany most nie może przenieść więcej niż 5000 funtów). The total weight of the driver and an empty truck is 3755 pounds (Łączna waga kierowcy i pustej ciężarówki to 3755 funtów). Now we need to find out how many boxes with 5 kg each can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. To do this, we divide the remaining weight allowance (5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds) by the weight of each box (5 kg): Number of boxes = Remaining weight allowance / Weight of each box = 1245 / 5 = 249 boxes. Therefore, the maximum number of skunks that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 249 boxes.
Response:  Firstly, Stephen paid $40 for his last order. Then, he was charged an additional $10 (25% of $40) as delivery fee, making the total cost $50. Next, he added $4 for tips, bringing the new total to $54. Finally, he paid another $3 for delivery, resulting in the final price of $57. Therefore, the osteinal cash for Stephen's purchases was $57.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 clusters of berries with 20 berries in each cluster. Therefore, the total number of berries is:

6 clusters x 20 berries/cluster = 120 berries

Additionally, we know that there are 67 individual berries scattered throughout the bush. So, the total number of berries on the bush is:

120 berries + 67 individual berries = 187 berries

Therefore, the little strawberry has 187 berries in total."
Response:  We know that out of 25 oranges, 1 is bad (zła), and we also know that 20% are immature (nedojrzałe). So, if we take 20% of 25 oranges, we get:  Number of immature oranges = 20% of 25 = 5 oranges. Now, let's subtract the number of bad oranges from the total number of oranges: Total number of good oranges = 25 - 1 = 24 oranges. Therefore, there are 24 good oranges in the basket.
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for the craft material. Then, she spent $800 on jewelry. Finally, she paid 10% of $800 as insurance, which is equal to $80. Therefore, in total, she paid $660.
Response:  If Mary works for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000 after retirement, then she will receive a total of $2,000,000 in pension payments over those 40 years ($50,000 x 40 years). After 20 years of service, she is entitled to a percentage of her pension value each year, which is 5%. So, after 20 years, she will have earned $100,000 in pension benefits ($2,000,000 x 5%). Therefore, if she leaves after 30 years of service, her annual pension payment will be $70,000 ($50,000 - $100,000 = $70,000).
Response:  First half of year (Q1): $140 x 6 = $840 Second half of year (Q2): $840 x 90/100 = $768 Total cost for the year: $840 + $768 = $1608 Therefore, the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year is $1608.
Response:  We know that Sophia has traveled 160 kilometers since her last fill-up and needed to add 4 gallons of gasoline to reach her next filling station. The car's fuel tank capacity is 12 gallons as stated in the manual. To find out how far Sophia can travel on one full tank of gasoline, we can use the following formula: Distance = Fuel capacity / (Gasoline consumption per 100 km) x Total distance traveled Since we don't know exactly how much gasoline she consumed per 100 kilometers, let's assume an average consumption rate of 8 liters/100 km (which is a reasonable value for most cars). Now we can plug in the values we know into the formula: Distance = 12 gallons / (8 liters/100 km) x 160 kilometers = 933 kilometers Therefore, Sophia can travel approximately 933 kilometers on one full tank of gasoline.
"Response:  Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So in one day, he spends 2 hours on TV and 1 hour reading. Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks (or 28 days):

TV: 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week
Reading: 1 hour/day x 7 days/week = 7 hours/week
Total hours spent on TV and reading per week = 14 + 7 = 21 hours/week
Now, let's multiply this total by 4 weeks:
21 hours/week x 4 weeks = 84 hours/month
So, Jim spends approximately 84 hours per month watching TV and reading."
Response:  We know that there are four schools participating in the tournament and each school has two teams - one for girls and one for boys. Therefore, we have a total of 8 teams (4 schools x 2 teams per school). Each team consists of 5 players, so we have a total of 40 players (8 teams x 5 players per team). Finally, since each school also sent a coach to train their respective teams, we have an additional 4 coaches (1 coach per school). So, in total, 44 people participated in the tournament (40 players + 4 coaches).
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds in total and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. Additionally, we have twice as many emeralds as rubies, so the number of emeralds is 140 x 2 = 280. Therefore, the total number of klejnotów (diamonds + rubies + emeralds) is 175 + 140 + 280 = 695.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in school. So if there are x girls, then there are 2x boys.  The number of students per teacher is given by 60 for every 5 teachers. Therefore, we can write an equation:  x + (2x) = 30. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 30. Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 10. So, there are 10 girls and 20 boys in the class. Therefore, there are 2 teachers.
Response:  Bailey starts with some money and then receives $5 per week for 8 weeks. If at the end of 8 weeks she has $100, then we can set up an equation as follows:  Money at start = Total amount received + Initial amount (since she started with some money)  Substituting values given in the problem:  Money at start = $5 x 8 + x  Where x is the initial amount Bailey had.  Now we are asked to find the value of x.  To do this, we can use the information that Bailey has $100 after receiving $40 ($5 x 8). So, we can write:  $100 = $40 + x  Solving for x, we get:  x = $60  Therefore, Bailey had $60 at the beginning.
"Response: 
Judy teaches five dance classes per day from Monday to Friday and eight dance classes on Saturday. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15 per student, how much money does Judy earn in one week?
Let's break it down:
Monday to Friday = 5 classes x 15 students/class x $15/student = $750
Saturday = 8 classes x 15 students/class x $15/student = $1200
Total for one week = $750 + $1200 = $1950
So, Judy earns $1950 in one week."
Response:  In the first recipe, there are 20 instructions for preparing one meal. Therefore, if we want to prepare two meals using this recipe, Kelian will have to read 40 instructions (2 x 20).
Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each slice of serniki for $4, then he will make $3 x 43 = $132 from selling brownies and $4 x 23 = $92 from selling serniki. Therefore, Tommy will collect a total of $132 + $92 = $224 in funds for his charity organization.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Sheila paid for each phone in total over three months. Since she paid $150 per phone and there are five phones in total, her total cost for all phones would be:

$150 x 5 = $750

Next, we need to find out how much of that amount is subject to an interest rate of 2%. To do this, we can multiply the total cost by the interest rate percentage:

$750 x 2% = $15

So, Sheila will pay $15 per month for each phone over three months, which adds up to a total of:

$15 x 5 = $75 per month

Therefore, Sheila will pay a total of $750 + $75 = $825 over three months for the five cellphones."
"Response:  If we assume that each ""doniczek"" is equal to $0.50 (since Artie doesn't have pennies), then:  Nagietki: 12 x $0.50 = $6.00 Petunia: 9 x $0.50 = $4.50 Begonia: 17 x $0.50 = $8.50 Total: $6 + $4.50 + $8.50 = $19 So, if Artie sells these quantities of flowers, he will make $19 in total."
Response:  If we start building the castle from level 0 (the beach), then each subsequent level will have half of the area of the previous one. So, if we build a 4-level castle with an area of 16 square meters at level 3, then the area of each level will be: Level 0 = beach = 16 square meters Level 1 = half of Level 0 = 8 square meters Level 2 = half of Level 1 = 4 square meters Level 3 = half of Level 2 = 2 square meters Therefore, the average area of each level is: Average Area = (8 + 4 + 2) / 3 = 5 square meters
Response:  First year (first 180 days):  Daily food intake = 1 filižanka/day x 180 days = 180 filižanek  Total amount of food needed in first year = 180 filižanek x 110 kubków/filižanka = 19,800 kubków Second year (remaining life): Daily food intake = 2 filiżanki/day x remaining days = Remaining days = 365 - 180 = 185 days  Total amount of food needed in second year = 2 filiżanki x 185 days = 370 filiżanek  Therefore, Cecilia will use 19,800 + 370 = 20,170 cubes of dog food throughout the lifetime of the puppy.
Response:  We know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah and four times more than David. So if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then Raymond does 200 pounds (half of 400). And if David does 160 pounds (four times less than Sarah), then David does 80 pounds (twice as much as Raymond). Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 80 pounds.
Response:  If Vince buys 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each or packages of 2 for $1 each, he will save money if he buys them at the better price. So we need to find out which price is better.  Price per flower = $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per flower  Price per flower = $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per flower  Since $0.50 is less than $0.83, it is better to buy the flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each. Therefore, Vincent will save $6.70 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each instead of buying them in packages of 3 for $2.50 each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John adopted a dog and took it to the groomer who charged $100 for the service. Now, the groomer is offering a discount of 30% for being a new client. So, what would be the cost of the grooming after applying this discount? We can calculate this as follows: Cost without discount = $100 x 100/70 = $142.86Cost with discount = $142.86 x 30% = $43.05So, the cost of the grooming after applying the discount is $43.05.
Response:  We know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water each, so together they received 2 x 1/6 = 3 liters of water. Then, the boy got 6 liters of water. So, in total, there are 3 + 6 = 9 liters of water left.
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 socks initially. Then he bought 21 more in the shopping center and received 23 as a birthday gift. So far, Charlie has 54 socks (10 + 21 + 23). Later, he gave 9 socks to his sister, leaving him with 45 socks (54 - 9 = 45). Finally, he used 28 socks for decorating the card, which means he now has 17 socks left (45 - 28 = 17). Therefore, the final number of socks Charlie has is 17.
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 40 kg or 98 lbs.  So, if Alex weighs less than four times as much as Grace, then their combined weight is equal to 4 x 98 = 392 lbs. Therefore, their total weight in pounds is 392 lbs + 40 kg = 432 lbs.
Response:  We know that there are 3 apple trees and each tree has 25 apples. So, in total, we have 3 x 25 = 75 apples. Now, let's consider the thorns. Each rose has 8 thorns, so altogether, we have 75 x 8 = 600 thorns. Therefore, the answer is 600.
Response:  We know that the team played 22 matches and won more than they lost. So, we can write down an equation as follows: Won = Lost + X, where X is the number of wins. Now, we are asked to find out how many more games the team won than they lost. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of losses from the number of wins: X = Won - Lost. Substituting this value into our first equation, we get: Won = Lost + (Won - Lost) Solving for Won, we get: Won = 2Lost + X = 2(22) + X = 44 + X Since we were told that the team won more than they lost, X must be positive. So, the final answer is: Won = 44.
Response: 1. The number of summer vacations = 4 (since he starts counting from age 23) 2. Each summer vacation has one shirt (since Gene has only one shirt for each summer vacation) 3. There are 4 years in each summer vacation (since Gene is 34 now and started counting from his 23rd year)  So, the total number of shirts = 4 x 4 = 16 Now we have found out that Gene has 16 shirts in total!
Response:  First time (first alarm): 4 times = 4. Second time (second alarm): 3 times longer than first time = 3 x 4 = 12. Third time (third alarm): half of second time = half of 12 = 6. In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each employee receives $600 per month from the company. Then, according to the rule provided in the problem, if an employee has worked for five years, their annual salary will be increased by 10% of their initial salary. Therefore, if Sylvie has just completed five years of service with the company, her current annual salary can be calculated as follows:  Initial salary = $600 x 5 = $3000  Annual salary after 5 years = $3000 + (10% of $3000) = $3300 So, Sylvie's annual salary after three years of service is $3300.
"Response:  We know that the first album of Marilyn sold ten times more than Harald. So if we sell together 88 thousand copies, then the number of copies sold by Harald is:

$$ \therefore Harald = \frac{88}{10} = 8800 $$

So, Harald sold $8800$ copies."
Response:  We know that Christina invited 16 friends to her party and she needs 75 gift bags for them. Since 1/4 of the guests (or 4 guests) will not come, we need to adjust the number of gift bags accordingly. So, we need 75 / 4 = 18 gift bags for the guests who will actually attend the party. Therefore, the cost of the gift bags is $18 x $2 = $36.
Response:  If an adult dinosaur can eat 10 pounds of coleslaw (which is equivalent to 4.5 kg), and a child dinosaur can eat half that amount (which is equivalent to 2.25 kg), then we need to calculate how much coleslaw each person will eat based on their age group.  For the adults, it's simple - they will eat 10 pounds or 4.5 kg of coleslaw per person.  However, for the children, we need to divide the total weight of coleslaw among them since they cannot eat as much as the adults. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children, we need to calculate how many kilograms of coleslaw each child needs to eat so that everyone gets enough.  To do this, we can use the following formula: Total weight of coleslaw needed = Number of people x Weight of coleslaw per person / Number of children  In this case, the total weight of coleslaw needed would be: Total weight of coleslaw needed = 20 x 4.5 kg/person + 5 x 2.25 kg/person = 90 kg + 11 kg = 101 kg Therefore, Ted should bring at least 101 kilograms of coleslaw to the picnic to ensure that everyone has enough to eat.
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three times as many animals as Marcia.
Marcia has two more animals than Cindy.
Cindy has four animals.
So, we can write an equation based on these statements:
Let X be the number of animals Jan has.
X = 3(Marcia)
X = 2(Cindy) + 4
Now, solve for X:
X = 3(5) = 15
Therefore, Jan has 15 animals."
Response:  We know that: * Emily has four children - Amy, Jackson, Corey and James. * Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. * Corey is 2 years younger than Jackson. * James is one year younger than Corey. So we can write down an equation based on this information: Age of Jackson = 5 + (Age of Amy - 2) = 10 - (Age of Corey - 2) Now let's substitute the values given in the question: Age of Amy = 10 - 2 = 8 Years old Age of Corey = 10 - 2 = 8 Years old Therefore, age of Jackson = 5 + (8 - 2) = 9 Years old So, Jackson is 9 years old.
Response:  We know that Lee can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, and we want to find out how fast Gerald can run it after improving his diet.  Firstly, we need to calculate the percentage increase in Gerald's speed due to his improved diet. Since he improved his diet by 10%, this means that for every 100% of his original speed, he now has 110% of his original speed. So if Lee ran 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, then Gerald would run it in (38 x 1.1) = 42.8 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 42.8 seconds.
"Response:  We know that there are fewer rabbits than dogs and cats in the area. If there are 60 dogs, then there must be twice as many cats (since each dog has two cats). So, if there are x rabbits, there must be 2x cats. Since we know that the total number of animals is 18 less than the sum of the numbers of dogs, cats, and rabbits, we can set up the equation:

Dogs + Cats = Rabbits + 18

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

60 + 2x = 32 + 18

Solving for x, we find that there are 48 cats in the area. Therefore, there are 48 / 2 = 24 rabbits."
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in class 5, 100 are boys (2/5). Now we need to find out how many girls are not in scouts. So, the number of girls who are not in scouts is equal to the total number of girls minus the number of girls who are in scouts. Therefore, the answer is: Number of girls not in scouts = Total number of girls - Number of girls in scouts = 100 - 50 = 50 girls.
Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for only 2/3 of Harry's time. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Harry slept for x hours, where x is equal to 9. Now, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept for 2/3 of Harry's time, he slept for (2/3)x hours. Therefore, the total number of hours both boys slept together is given by the sum of their individual times: x + (2/3)x = 18. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. So, Harry slept for 9 hours more than James.
"Response:  We know that when Freda adds pickles to her sauce, she loses half of its volume. So if she uses x cups of pickles, then after adding them to the sauce, it will be reduced to (x/2) cups. Now we are given that the last batch of sauce made by Freda contained 32 tablespoons, so we can write an equation:

(x/2) = 32

Now we need to solve for x, which is the number of cups of pickles used by Freda. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by (x/2), giving us:

x = 64

So Freda used 64 cups of pickles in total."
Response:  At first, there are 30 cars in line, and 5 of them leave the line during the first 15 minutes. So, initially, 25 cars (30 - 5) have to pass through the bottleneck. Now, let's consider how many cars will pass through the bottleneck in total time. The total time is 15 + 15 = 30 minutes. Since some cars have already passed through the bottleneck during the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract that number from the total time. Therefore, the number of cars passing through the bottleneck in 30 minutes is: Number of cars passing through the bottleneck = Total time - Time taken by cars to pass through the bottleneck Total time = 30 minutes Time taken by cars to pass through the bottleneck = 15 minutes (first 15 minutes) + 15 minutes (remaining 15 minutes) = 30 minutes / 2 = 15 cars Thus, 15 cars pass through the bottleneck in 30 minutes.
Response:  Mary has received 18 new plants in pots from her favorite nursery yesterday. She plans to give away one plant from each of the 40 windows in her large country house today. Therefore, she will have 40 - 1 = 39 plants left after giving them away. So, Mary will have 39 plants in her pots.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. So, the second friend must have pressed it more than 20 times to make up for the time taken by the first friend. Therefore, the second friend pressed it 40 times (since 40 is greater than 20). Now, since the third friend pressed it 10 times more than the second friend, he pressed it 400 times (since 40 x 10 = 400). Lastly, if the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, then he pressed it a total of 520 times (since 60 + 400 = 520).  Hence, the answer is 520.
Response:  We know that Solo has already read 15 pages in Monday and he has 4 days left to read the remaining pages. So, we can calculate how many pages he needs to read each day as follows: Number of pages to be read per day = Total number of pages - Number of pages read so far / Number of days left = 40 (total pages) - 15 (pages read so far) / 4 (days left) = 10 pages per day Now, let me know if you want more explanation or if this is what you were looking for!
Response:  John drinks water every day at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He also has one glass of water before bedtime. So, in total, he drinks 3 x 2 = 6 glasses of water per day during the weekdays. On weekends, he relaxes and drinks gas-based beverage with his meal, which is not specified how many glasses that would be. Therefore, we can assume it's just one or two glasses. So, in total, John drinks 6 + (1 or 2) = 7 - 8 glasses of water per week.
Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of city with fog. So, if we want to cover the entire city (which is 42 miles away from the coast), it will take 42/3 = 14 minutes. Therefore, it will take 14 minutes for the fog to completely cover the city.
Response:  If Poppy has placed  quarter of the puzzle pieces (100) on the table, then she has 300 - 100 = 200 remaining pieces to place.  When her mother places another piece, there will be 200 + 1 = 201 pieces left to arrange. Therefore, in total, 201 pieces need to be arranged.
Response:  If Cody has three times as many cookies as Amir, that means Cody has 3x = 3 \* 5 = 15 cookies.  If Amir eats 5 cookies, then together they have 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.
Response:  We have three boxes with different dimensions as follows: Box 1: Length = 6 cm, Width = 4 cm, Height = 1 cm Box 2: Length = 5 cm, Width = 4 cm, Height = 1 cm Box 3: Length = 4 cm, Width = 3 cm, Height = 1 cm To find the total internal volume of all three boxes, we need to calculate the volume of each box and then add them up. The formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism is: Volume = Length x Width x Height So, let's calculate the volume of each box separately: Box 1: Volume = 6 cm x 4 cm x 1 cm = 96 cubic centimeters (or 0.096 cubic meters) Box 2: Volume = 5 cm x 4 cm x 1 cm = 80 cubic centimeters (or 0.08 cubic meters) Box 3: Volume = 4 cm x 3 cm x 1 cm = 12 cubic centimeters (or 0.012 cubic meters) Now, let's add the volumes of all three boxes together: Total volume = 96 + 80 + 12 = 188 cubic centimeters (or 0.0188 cubic meters) Therefore, the total internal volume of all three boxes is 188 cubic centimeters or 0.0188 cubic meters.
"Response: 
Frankie watched TV after completing his lesson. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a one-hour episode of his favorite show. On Wednesday, he watched several 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched a one-hour episode and three 30-minute programs. On Friday, he had to stay late for the weekend, so he watched two one-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?  Solution: To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to divide the total time he spent watching TV (7 hours) by the duration of each 30-minute episode (30 minutes). So, if Frankie watched 7 hours of TV, he must have watched 23 30-minute episodes on Wednesday (7 hours / 30 minutes per episode = 23 episodes)."
Response:  Last year, Henry made $2 more than he did the previous year. So if he made $x last year, then this year he will make $x + 2.  Since he wants to make twice as much as last year, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 2(x + 2). Solving for x, we get: x = 60. Therefore, Henry made 60 cakes last year.
Response:  If we buy gas for $3 per gallon and get $0.20 cash back, then our total cost would be: $3 - $0.20 = $2.80 per gallon. Since we bought 10 gallons of gasoline, our total cost would be: $2.80 x 10 = $28. So there will be $28 worth of gasoline after the cashback reward.
Response:  We know that Beatrice had 24 rolls of width and 14 rolls of length, so she had a total of 24 x 14 = 336 units of area. Similarly, Marcel had 3 rolls of width and 14 rolls of length, so he had a total of 3 x 14 = 42 units of area. Therefore, if both Beatrice and Marcel ate all their respective amounts, they would have eaten a total of 336 + 42 = 378 units of fruit. So, the average amount eaten per person is 378 / 2 = 189 units of fruit.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the boat is equal to twice the speed of the boat times the time taken to travel that distance. So, in this case, the distance traveled by the boat is: Distance = Speed x Time = 2 x (2 m/3 m) x 16 s = 64 m Secondly, we know that the volume of water collected by the boat is equal to the capacity of the boat multiplied by the time it took to collect that much water. So, in this case, the volume of water collected by the boat is: Volume = Capacity x Time = 2 L x 16 s = 32 L Thirdly, we are asked how much water was left in the boat when Julia reached the shore. We can find this out by subtracting the volume of water collected from the total capacity of the boat. So, if the total capacity of the boat is X liters, then the amount of water left in the boat when Julia reached the shore is: Amount of water left = Total capacity - Volume = X - 32 = X - 32 L Therefore, based on the information given in the question, we can conclude that there were X liters of water left in the boat when Julia reached the shore.
Response:  There are four teachers who share one classroom and each teacher has two lessons per day. If the blackboard is cleaned three times during each lesson, then it will be cleaned 6 times in total per day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/day x 3 cleans per lesson). Therefore, the answer is 6.
"Response:  If Ryan plants two flowers daily in his garden and it takes 15 days for them to bloom, then he will have:

2 flowers/day x 15 days = 30 flowers planted in total

If 5 of these flowers did not grow (i.e., they failed to bloom), then Ryan has:

30 flowers - 5 non-growing flowers = 25 successfully grown flowers in his garden."
"Response:  We know that:
Telefon Jamala can hold 6 times more pictures than telephone Brittany. So, the maximum number of pictures that telephone Brittany can hold is 6/7 = 0.86 times less than the number of pictures that telephone Jamala can hold.
The number of birds in the picture with Jamal and his friends at the zoo is equal to 50 times the number of pictures that telephone Brittany can hold. Therefore, the number of birds in the picture with Jamal and his friends at the zoo is equal to 50 x 0.86 = 43 birds.
So, there are 43 birds in the picture with Jamal and his friends at the zoo."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has ten pieces of 2x4 wood (drewna) which cost her $10 each, so she spent a total of $100 for those.  Secondly, we know that she also has five pieces of 4x4 wood which cost her $16 each, so she spent a total of $80 for those.  Finally, we are asked how much money she will make if she sells all these pieces of wood. So, let's calculate it: Total amount of money she made from selling 2x4 wood = Number of pieces x Price per piece = $10 x 10 = $100 Total amount of money she made from selling 4x4 wood = Number of pieces x Price per piece = $16 x 5 = $80 Total amount of money she will make = Total amount of money she made from selling 2x4 wood + Total amount of money she made from selling 4x4 wood = $100 + $80 = $180 Therefore, Sasha will make a total of $180 if she sells all the pieces of wood she has.
"Response:  We know that Katy used 7 times more water than sugar. So if she used x ounces of sugar, she used 7x ounces of water. Since there are 120 ounces in total, we can set up the equation:

x + (7x) = 120

Simplifying the equation:

8x = 120

Dividing both sides by 8:

x = 15

So Katy used 15 ounces of sugar."
Response:  We know that John bought two pairs of shoes for each of his three children. So in total he bought 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John paid a total of $60 x 6 = $360. Therefore, John paid $360 to buy shoes for his three children.
"Response:  On day one, there were two containers with 10 cars in total (5 cars per container). So, the number of containers that arrived on the second day is:

Number of containers = Total number of cars / Number of cars per container
= 30 / 5
= 6

Therefore, 6 containers arrived on the second day."
"Response:  We know that:
Adrienn's salary was $60,000 - $30% = $42,000 four years ago.
Lylah's salary was $50,000 four years ago.
Four years later, Adrian's salary is $80,000 ($40% increase).
So, the total salaries of both Adrian and Lylah together four years later are:
$42,000 + $50,000 = $92,000."
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 blocks of paper per week for drawing and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he will use 8 blocks of paper per month (2 x 4 = 8). Since there are 30 arkszes on each sheet of paper, Miguel will use 8 x 30 = 240 sheets of paper per month. Therefore, he will use 240 sheets of paper every month.
Response:  We know that Morisette brought 5 jabłek and 8 pomarańczy, so she contributed (5 + 8) = 13 owoców.  Kael brought twice as many jabłek as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 jabłek. He also brought half as many pomarañey as Morisette, which means he brought (8 / 2) = 4 pomarañey. In total, both of them contributed (13 + 10 + 4) = 27 owoców. Therefore, they have in total 27 owoców.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept for 2 hours less than on Monday, so she slept for 6 hours each day. Therefore, her total sleep time for those two days is: 6 + 6 = 12 hours. Now, if she slept more than 2 hours per day for the rest of the week, then her total sleep time for the week would be: 12 + (x - 2) = x hours, where x is the number of hours she slept more than 2 hours per day. Since she slept more than 2 hours per day for the remaining 4 days, her total sleep time for the week is: x = 10 hours. So, Sadie slept for a total of 10 hours in the week.
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 miles in an hour for 3 hours, she has covered a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Then, if she runs at a speed of 8 km/h after that, she will cover a distance of 30 / 8 = 3.75 kilometers per hour. To find out how many kilometers she can cover in 7 hours, we multiply her running speed by the time she spends running: 3.75 km/h x 7 h = 26.25 kilometers. So, Rosie can cover 26.25 kilometers in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jennie started helping her mother, there were 60 lists that needed to be stamped. She already put stamps on one-third of them (20 lists). So, the number of lists she had left to stamp is 60 - 20 = 40 lists. Now, if there are 30 lists in the stack that have already been stamped, then the total number of lists that Jennie had to stamp is 40 + 30 = 70 lists. Therefore, the correct answer is 70.
Response:  Julia had 3 łyżki left after she tasted the soup. Then her husband gave her 5 new łyżki, so she had in total 8 łyżek (3 + 5). Later, when she was preparing the table, she used 3 more łyżek, leaving her with 5 łyżek remaining (8 - 3). Therefore, the number of łyżek in the package that Julia bought was 5.
Response:  We know that Dylan bought more than 30 sausage links (38 + 6 = 44). So, he bought 44 sausage links in total.
Response:  If Amy had 20 more friends than Lily, then Lily has x friends and Amy has x + 20 = 40 friends. So, together they have 40 + x = 80 friends. Therefore, Lily has 30 friends (x) and Amy has 10 friends (x + 20).
Response:  We know that one arbuz costs three times as much as pepper (so arbuz = 3xpepper).  We also know that one papryk costs half as much as an arbuz (so papryk = 0.5arbuz). Finally, we know that one pomarańcz costs 5 times less than an arbuz (so pomarańcz = 0.2arbuz). Therefore, if Dillon buys 4 arbuzy, he will pay 4 x 3 = 12 dollars for them. He will also pay 20 x 0.5 = 10 dollars for the papryki and 10 x 0.2 = 2 dollars for the pomarañces. So in total, Dillon will pay 12 + 10 + 2 = 24 dollars.
Response:  The hospital receives 500 people per day and each patient is observed for an average of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent observing patients per day = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. Now, we know that doctors are paid $150 per hour by the hospital, so the total amount earned by the hospital from doctor visits in one day = 12,000 minutes / 60 (minutes in an hour) = $200,000. Similarly, since the hospital charges patients $200 per hour, the total amount earned by the hospital from patient visits in one day = 12,000 minutes / 60 = $200,000. So, the hospital earns a total of $400,000 per day.
Response:  We know that 60 workers were hired to play elves in Nissa's store during Christmas season.  After some children vomited on them and 10 more after they got hit with sticks, we can conclude that 50 elves remained (60 - 10 = 50). Therefore, there are 50 elves left working at Nissa's store.
"Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. If his expenses in June were $60 less than that, then he spent:
$500 - $60 = $440 in June. Therefore, over those two months, Joseph's total spending was:
$500 + $440 = $940."
Response:  Pam and Fred went to the carnival together. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, while Fred rode it four times. After that, each of them decided to ride the Ferris wheel twice. If each trip cost 6 tickets, then how many tickets did they use up that day?  We can start by counting the number of trips taken by each person:  Pam took 2 rides on the roller coaster and 2 rides on the Ferris wheel, for a total of 4 trips. Fred took 4 rides on the roller coaster and 2 rides on the Ferris wheel, for a total of 6 trips.  Now we need to calculate the number of tickets used by each person:  For each ride on the roller coaster, Pam used 6 tickets (since she rode it twice). Fred used 24 tickets (since he rode it 4 times). For each ride on the Ferris wheel, Pam used 6 tickets again (since she rode it twice), while Fred used 12 tickets (since he rode it twice as well).  In total, Pam used 24 tickets (4 trips x 6 tickets per trip) and Fred used 36 tickets (6 trips x 6 tickets per trip).
Response:  On Monday, Walt walked 6 km. On Tuesday, he walked six times more than on Monday, so he walked 6 x 7 = 42 km. Therefore, his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 + 42 = 83 km. So, he walked 83 km in Wednesday.
"Response:  If Tom has 4 cars that he needs to wash in a month and each car wash costs $15, then we can calculate how much Tom will spend in one year as follows:
Yearly cost = Monthly cost x Number of cars x Number of months
= $15 x 4 x 12
= $600
Therefore, Tom will spend $600 on car washes in one year."
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 games and lost 5 before comparing with Bobby. So, Brian now has 15 games left (20 - 5 = 15).  Now, we are told that Bobby has 5 times fewer games than Brian, which means Bobby has 5 x 15 = 75 games in total. Therefore, Bobby has 75 games, and Brian has 15 games left after losing 5.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in the world and one-third of them are located in Scotland (i.e., 9 unicorns). Since two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are females (i.e., 6 out of 9), we can conclude that there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland. Therefore, the number of female unicorns in the entire world is 6 + 3 = 9. So, there are 9 female unicorns among the total of 27 unicorns.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each item that Rory ordered:  * Kanapki x 2 = $15.00  * Worki chipsów x 2 = $3.00  * Ciasteczka x 2 = $2.00 Total cost of items = $20.00 Next, we need to add the delivery fee which is 20% of the total cost of items: Delivery fee = $20.00 x 20% = $4.00 Finally, we need to add the tip for the delivery person: Tip = $4.00 x 1.5 = $6.00 So, the total cost of Rory's order will be: Total cost = $20.00 + $4.00 + $6.00 = $30.00
Response:  First test had 75 questions and he took 8 hours to complete it, so he answered 75/8 = 9 questions per hour.  Second test had 100 questions and he took 6 hours to complete it, so he answered 100/6 = 16.7 questions per hour. Since he did not finish both tests in the same amount of time, there are some unanswered questions left over from the second test. To find out exactly how many, we can subtract the number of questions he answered from the total number of questions in the second test: 100 - (9 x 6) = 40 unanswered questions.
Response:  We know that there are 22 different types of gummies in total and 4 more blue ones than non-blue ones. So, if there are 12 non-blue gummies, then there must be 9 additional gummies of other colors (including blue). Therefore, the number of red gummies is 3, orange gummies is 5, green gummies is 7, yellow gummies is 4, and purple gummies is 4.
Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for rent and we need to find out what percentage of them are semi-automatic. So, let's count how many semi-automatic cars are available:  Semi-automatic cars = 4 (out of 20) x 100% / Total number of cars = 4/20 x 100% = 20%. Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and that the number of worker bees is twice the number of nurse bees. So, if there are x nurse bees, then there are 2x worker bees. Also, we know that the number of young bees is half the number of nurse bees. Therefore, if there are y nurse bees, then there are (1/2)y young bees. Now, let's substitute these values into the equation:  Number of worker bees = 2(number of nurse bees)  Number of young bees = (1/2)(number of nurse bees) Substituting the given values:  Number of worker bees = 2(y)  Number of young bees = (1/2)(y) Now, we can solve for y:  Number of worker bees = 2y  Number of young bees = (1/2)y Solving for y:  y = (Number of worker bees / (1/2))  y = (700 / (1/2))  y = 350 Young bees = 350 Now, since there are two times as many worker bees as young bees, the number of worker bees is twice the number of young bees:  Worker bees = 2(young bees) Worker bees = 2(350) Worker bees = 700 Therefore, there are 700 worker bees.
Response:  If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day and works half-time (5 days/week), his daily income from work is $10/hour x 5 hours = $50/day. Since he spends 2 hours playing video games per day, his total time spent doing leisure activities is 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week. So, his weekly income from leisure activities is $50/day x 14 hours/week = $700/week. Therefore, if Jordan stopped playing video games and worked full-time instead, he would earn $700/week - $50/day = $650/week more than he currently earns.
Response:  Mleko costs $2, so it is $2 x 10% = $0.20. Jajka cost $3, so they are $3 x 10% = $0.30. Żarówki cost $3, so they are $3 x 10% = $0.30. Cubes cost $3, so they are $3 x 10% = $0.30. Pułapki for carnivorous plants cost $4, so they are $4 x 10% = $0.40. Therefore, everything together costs $0.20 + $0.30 + $0.30 + $0.30 + $0.40 = $2.60.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucas has already three clients and he is talking to five potential ones. So, the total number of clients he will have at the end of the week is 8 (3 + 5).  Secondly, each client needs 2 bottles of bleacher and one package of cleaning supplies, which costs $5 in total. Therefore, his total revenue for the week will be:  Revenue = Number of clients x Price per client x Quantity of product per client  Revenue = 8 x $2 x 2 = $64  Lastly, Lucas's only expense is the cost of the products he sells, so his profit for the week will be: Profit = Revenue - Expenses  Profit = $64 - $10 = $54  Hence, Lucas will make $54 per week.
"Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land with ananas plants and each hectare produces 100 ananas per month. So, in one year, John will have:

$$ \text {Number of ananas} = \text{Total area} \times \text{Monthly production} $$

$$ \text {Number of ananas} = 10 \text{ hectares} \times 12 \text{ months/year} \times 100 \text{ ananas/hectare/month} $$

$$ \text {Number of ananas} = 1200 \text{ ananas/year} $$

Therefore, John can collect $1200$ ananas per year."
Response:  We know that Johnny threw away a box of Legos with 500 pieces and another box with three times as many pieces (1500 pieces). Additionally, he threw away a fourth box with four times as many pieces (2000 pieces). So in total, Johnny threw away boxes containing 500 + 1500 + 2000 = 3000 pieces of Lego. Now we are asked how many blocks Johnny collects if he picks up all the Legos from the floor. Since he picked up all the Legos from the floor, including those thrown away, then he must have collected 3000 - 500 = 2500 blocks of Lego. Therefore, the answer is 2500.
Response:  We know that in the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive and half of them returned in the next 6 hours. So, the number of bees that returned = 30 / 2 = 15. Now, we also know that Debra saw twice as many bees leaving the hive than she did when she first observed it. So, if she saw 15 bees returning, then she must have seen 30 bees leaving (twice the original number). Therefore, the total number of bees that left the hive = 30 x 2 = 60. Finally, we are asked how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours. Since each bee that left the hive returns after 6 hours, the number of bees that returned = 60 / 2 = 30.
Response:  We know that the cost of admission for an adult is $12 and for a child is $10. So, if Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8, then she must have given her the difference between the cost of the adult ticket and the cost of the child ticket, which is $4 ($12 - $10). Therefore, the answer is $4.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then Charlie has 3x friends on Facebook.  We also know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then James has 4x friends on Facebook.  Now we are given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. So we can set up the equation: 3x = 12... (1)  Similarly, we can set up an equation for James: 4x = 12... (2)  Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  x = 6... (3)  Therefore, Dorothy has 6 friends on Facebook, and James has 24 friends on Facebook.
Response:  We know that Steve lives farther away from school than Tim does, so he will take longer to arrive. Specifically, Steve is 3 miles away from school (which is equal to 5 kilometers), while Tim is only 3 kilometers away. Since Steve rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute, it will take him longer to cover the extra distance. So, let's assume that Steve takes x minutes to reach school. Then, since Tim rides his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, it will take him y minutes to reach school. Now we can set up an equation based on this information: 440x = 264y + 3 (since Steve starts 3 miles ahead of Tim) Where x and y are unknown variables. Solving for x and y gives us: x = 7.5 minutes y = 5.1 minutes Therefore, Steve will take 7.5 minutes to reach school, and Tim will take 5.1 minutes to reach school. So, if Steve leaves school first, Tim will catch up in 7.5 - 5.1 = 2.4 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, there were 5 people who came to inflate their bicycles on the first day. Each person needed one opon, so the total number of opons required was 5 x 1 = 5 opons. Since each opon cost $0.25, the total cost of these opons was 5 x $0.25 = $1.25.  Next, three people arrived to inflate their tri-wheeled bicycles. Each of them needed two opons, so the total number of opons required was 3 x 2 = 6 opons. The cost of these opons was 6 x $0.25 = $1.50. Finally, one person fell off their bike and needed an opon to fix it. This person needed one opon, which cost $0.25. Therefore, the total amount earned that day was $1.25 + $1.50 + $0.25 = $3.00.
Response:  We know that Carl bought ten packages of cookies, and each package contains six cookies. So, in total, Carl has 60 cookies (10 packages x 6 cookies/package). Since each cookie costs $0.10, the total cost of all the cookies is $6 (60 cookies x $0.10/cookie). Now, we are asked how much money Carl will get if he pays with a $10 bill. The answer is simply $4 ( $10 - $6 = $4). Therefore, Carl will receive $4 in small change.
Response:  When Dave bought the large bag of fries, there were 14 left in the bag (Dave had eaten 14). Then, a hungry seagull stole the bag from Dave and ate half of the remaining fries (5). Next, three crows scared Dave off, and each crow ate 3 fries (9). Later, an opossum snatched two-thirds of the remaining fries (7). Finally, ants took the last french fry, leaving five (5). So, when Dave bought the bag of fries, there were 14 fries inside.
Response:  On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, Kimo has three 1-hour sessions each day, so he has 3 x 4 = 12 hours of session per week. In one semester, there are 16 weeks, so Kimo has 12 x 16 = 192 hours of sessions in total.
Response:  We know that Bill has to lay down all of his pastries every day. So, he needs to place them in rows or columns so they don't overlap with each other.  For example, if he places the bread rolls first, then he will need 15 cm x 300 = 4500 cm for all of them. Similarly, he will need 15 cm x 120 = 1800 cm for the croissants and 60 cm x 60 = 3600 cm for the baguettes. Therefore, the total length required for Bill to lay down all of his pastries is: 4500 + 1800 + 3600 = 9900 cm. Since there are 100 cm in one meter, we can convert this value to meters as follows: 9900 cm / 100 cm/m = 99 m. So, it would take Bill approximately 99 meters to lay down all of his pastries.
"Response:  We know that the zoologist feeds all monkeys in the zoo and buys all bananas from the local farm every two months. The number of bananas required for each type of monkey is as follows:

* Moneys (200 bananas)
* Gorillas (400 bananas)
* Pavier (100 bananas)

We also know that the zoologist orders all these bananas twice a month. Therefore, we can calculate how many bananas he needs to order for 2 months as follows:

For Monkeys: 2 x 200 = 400 bananas
For Gorillas: 2 x 400 = 800 bananas
For Paviars: 2 x 100 = 200 bananas
Total: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas
Therefore, the zoologist must order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Response:  We know that Blake runs 15 times along the football field of length 100 yards = 91 meters (since there are 1.60934 meters in a yard). So he covers a distance of:

$$ Distance = \text{Number of times} \times \text{Distance per time} $$

Since we don't have the exact value for the distance covered by each run, let's assume it is an average distance of $D$ meters per run. Then, the total distance covered by Blake is:

$$ Total\ distance = \sum_{i=1}^{15} {D \over 15} $$

Now, let's consider Kelly's strategy. Since she doesn't want to b eg alongside Blake, she starts running from the 40-yard line and back ($L = 40 \text{ yards} = 36.58 meters$). She does this 34 times, so her total distance covered is:

$$ Total\ distance = \sum_{i=1}^{34} {L \over 34} $$

To find out who wins the race, we need to compare the distances covered by both contestants. If Blake covers a longer distance than Kelly, then he wins; otherwise, Kelly wins. Therefore, we can write:

$$ Winner = \begin{cases} Blake & \text{if } Total\ distance > Kelly \\ Kelly & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get:

$$ Winner = \begin{cases} Blake & \text{if } \sum_{i=1}^{15} {D \over 15} > \sum_{i=1}^{34} {L \over 34} \\ Kelly & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

Simplifying and solving for $D$, we get:

$$ D > L \cdot {15 \over 34} $$

So, if $L > 15/34 \approx 0.44$ meters, then Blake wins; otherwise, Kelly wins.

Therefore, the answer is:

Blake wins if"
Response:  We know that Raphael bought 4 long texts for $1.5 each = $6, 2 notebooks for $4 each = $8, and an cover page for $20 = $38. So, he spent a total of $38.
Response:  We know that Finn observed 11 yellow frogs swimming in the pond and then he saw 6 of them hiding under a lily pad. Then he saw 2 of them hiding under a rock. So, we can conclude that Finn saw a total of 8 dikes (6 + 2) in the pond. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  On Monday, the depth of the water in the tank was 5 meters. Then, on Wednesday, there were 7 more feet of water (or 2.1 meters). So, the new depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is:  Depth = 5 + 2.1 = 7.1 meters. Now, let's find out how deep the water is on Thursday:  Głębokość wody na czwartek = 7.1 - 2/3 × głębokości wody z niedawna = 7.1 - 2/3 × 7.1 = 4.68 meters. Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Thursday is approximately 4.68 meters.
Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 stars, 6 seahorses, and 3 fish.  Locsin caught fewer stars than Anakin (by 5), fewer horses than Anakin (by 3), but more fish than Anakin (by 2). So, we can conclude that Locsin caught 7 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is 3 + 7 = 10.
Response:  If the price of the work increases by 20% every two months, then after 18 months, the new price will be: $ 20 x (1 + 0.2) ^ 18 = $ 49.57 After 36 months, the new price will be: $ 49.57 x (1 + 0.2) ^ 18 = $ 99.14 Therefore, the cost of the bag after 36 months would be $ 99.14.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red cars, and each one costs $4. Therefore, the total cost of all the red cars is:  5 x $4 = $20.  Next, we have 3 figures and 1 doll. The figure costs $5, so the total cost of the figures is:  3 x $5 = $15.  Finally, the doll costs $1, so the total cost of all the toys is: $20 + $15 + $1 = $36.
Response:  If Jackie decides to hire an accountant and works 3 hours less per week (since she won't be doing her own taxes), she will earn $35 less per hour. So if she worked 40 hours per week before, now she will work 37 hours per week ($35 x 40 = $1400). Now let's calculate how much money she would make with and without hiring an accountant: Without hiring an accountant: $1400 x 37 hours/week = $50,600 per year With hiring an accountant: $1400 x 33 hours/week = $45,800 per year Since hiring an accountant saves her $7200 per year, it makes sense for Jackie to hire one.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira received $1500 as her birthday gift from her family. Then she spent $1090 on the computer itself, which leaves $410 remaining. Next, she bought an scanner for $157, a CD recorder for $74, and a printer for $102, which adds up to $343. Therefore, Elvira has $86 left over for clothes.
"Response:  If Sandra has to make 15 Hispanic flans for the charity event, and each time she needs 3 eggs to make one flan, then...

15 flans x 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs needed in total
Since Sandra already has 9 jars of eggs with her, she will need an additional...
45 - 9 = 36 eggs
Therefore, Sandra must feed her children 36 times to have enough eggs to make all the flans required for the charity event."
"Response:  We know that Seth is two years older than Brooke, so their ages after 2 years will be:
Seth - 2 = 30
Brooke - 2 = 28
So, Seth is 30 years old and Brooke is 28 years old."
Response:  If Ethel has $8 and Jimmy has $10 more than Ethel, then Jimmy has $8 + $10 = $18. So, Jimmy has $18.
Response:  Monday to Friday (non-weekends), he walks 10 miles per day = 70 miles/week. So in one week, he covers approximately 490 kilometers (70 miles x 7 days).
"Response:  The cost of each item is given as follows:
Capelusch - $25
Kurtka - $75 (3 times $25)
Spodnie - $60 ($25 + $35)
So, the total cost of one mundur is:
$25 (capelusch) + $75 (kurtka) + $60 (spodnie) = $160
Therefore, each mundur costs $160."
Response:  We know that Jake saw 80 eight-legged spiders, 90 six-legged insects, and 3 rare creatures with ten legs in total. So, we can calculate the number of legs Jake saw as follows:  Legs seen = Number of legs per creature x Number of creatures seen  Legs seen = 8 x 80 + 6 x 90 + 10 x 3 = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1470 legs  Therefore, Jake saw a total of 1470 legs during his visit to the entomology museum.
"Response:  We know that:
Sally Trzydziestka is three years older than Baby Red. So, Sally Trzydziestka is 3 + 3 = 6 years old.
Babcia Czerwona is twice as old as Sally Trzydziestka, so Babcia Czerwona is 2 x 6 = 12 years old.
Sally Czwartek has the same age as Sally Trzydziestka, so Sally Czwartek is also 6 years old.
Now we have the ages of four birds:
Baby Red - 0 years old (since she is not born yet)
Sally Trzydziestka - 6 years old
Babcia Czerwona - 12 years old
Sally Czwartek - 6 years old
So, the total age of these four birds is:
0 + 6 + 12 + 6 = 34 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays for each debt per month. For example, she pays $300 for her student loan and $200 for her credit card bill. Therefore, her total monthly payments are $300 + $200 = $500. Now, if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, then her new monthly payment will be $500 x 1.5 = $750. So, in one year, she will have paid $750 x 12 = $90,000 towards all of her debts.
Response:  Billy needs half a minute to peel each zucchini (since he needs to peel 60 of them), and about 5 seconds to cut each one after peeling (since he needs to cut 60 zucchinis in total). So, in total, Billy will need around 30 minutes to prepare all the zucchinis for his salad (half a minute per zucchini x 60 zucchinis = 30 minutes).
Response:  We know that Juan and his brother sell lemonade for $1 per cup. They buy citrus fruits at $3 per gallon and sugar at $2 per gallon. Since they get 20 cups from each gallon of citrus fruits, they can make 40 cups (20 x 2) from one gallon of citrus fruits. Therefore, they spend $6 (3 x 40 = 120) on citrus fruits for every 100 cups of lemonade sold. Now we are given that they earned $25 in profit. So, if they sold 100 cups of lemonade, they spent $6 x 100 = $600 on citrus fruits. Thus, their profit is $25 - $600 = -$575.
Response:  We know that there are 240 Asian athletes in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese athletes is equal to 240 - 80 = 160. Now, we know that among the Chinese athletes, 60 are boys (chłopcy). Therefore, the number of girls (dziewczynki) among the Chinese athletes is 160 - 60 = 100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends $1/4 of his salary on rent, which is equal to $1500 per month (since he earns $6000 per month). Secondly, he spends $1/3 of his salary on fuel for his car, which is equal to $2000 per month ($6000 x 1/3 = $2000). Thirdly, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity organization, which is equal to $3000 per month ($6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $3000). Fourthly, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife. Therefore, the total amount left with him after all these expenses and donations is: $$ Total = $6000 - $1500 - $2000 + $3000 + $200 + $700 = $8500$$ So, Zaid has $8500 left after all his expenses and donations.
"Response:  We know that:
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monica.
Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
Bo has 40 crabs.
So, we can write an equation based on these statements:
Rani's crabs = Monica's crabs + (4 - 4) = 10 + (-4) = 6
Now, let's find out how many crabs Monica has:
Monica's crabs = Rani's crabs - (4 - 4) = 6 - (-4) = 10
And now, let's find out how many crabs Bo has:
Bo's crabs = 40
We want to find the total number of crabs that have these three people together. So, we add up their individual crab counts:
Total crabs = Monica's crabs + Bo's crabs + Rani's crabs = 10 + 40 + 6 = 66
Therefore, the total number of crabs that have these three people together is 66."
Response:  In the first week, he taught for 5 hours and earned $50 (since $10/hour). So in the second week, if he taught for 8 hours, he earned $80 ($10/hour x 8 hours). Therefore, in total, he earned $130 ($50 + $80) in the two weeks.
"Response:  We know that there are two candidates running for the position of representative in class Sarai. If the winner received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in total, we can calculate the number of votes the loser received as follows:

Number of votes received by the loser = Total number of votes - Number of votes received by the winner
= 80 - (3/4) x 80
= 80 - 20
= 60

Therefore, the loser received 60 votes."
Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white carnations and also ordered 200 red lilies, which is five times more than white carnations. So, in total, Sandra ordered (4 x 4 =) 16 red roses and (5 x 200 =) 1000 red lilies. To satisfy Sandra, Fred must deliver at least these many red roses and red lilies before 5 PM to avoid losing her business. Therefore, the answer is: 16 + 1000 = 1016 red roses and red lilies that Fred must deliver before 5 PM.
Response:  We know that Jean is two years older than Mark and two years ago, Mark was five years older than Jean. So, if Jean has an age of 30 now, then he must have been 28 years old two years ago. Therefore, Jean is currently 30 - 28 = 2 years older than Mark.
Response:  The first team completes 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, so their average speed is: $ \boxed{55 \text{ seconds}} = \boxed{12.78 \text{ meters/second}} $ (since there are $\boxed{400 \text{ meters}}$ in total).  Now, let's calculate the average speed of the second team:  We know that the first member of the second team takes $\boxed{60 \text{ seconds}}$ to complete 400 meters, which means their average speed is: $ \boxed{60 \text{ seconds}} = \boxed{15.00 \text{ meters/second}} $. Then, for each subsequent member of the second team, we subtract $3$ seconds from their time, resulting in an average speed of: $$ \boxed{\text{Average speed of second team} = \frac{(\boxed{15.00 \text{ meters/second}}) - (\boxed{3.00 \text{ seconds}})}{(\boxed{400 \text{ meters}})}} = \boxed{12.00 \text{ meters/second}} $$ Therefore, the difference in average speed between the two teams is: $$ \boxed{\text{Difference in average speed} = \boxed{12.78 \text{ meters/second}} - \boxed{12.00 \text{ meters/second}}} = \boxed{0.78 \text{ meters/second}} $$ Finally, since both teams run around the entire track once, we can multiply the difference in average speed by the distance around the track to find the total time advantage of the faster team: $$ \boxed{\text{Total time advantage} = \boxed{0.78 \text{ meters/second}} \times \boxed{400 \text{ meters}}} = \boxed{312 \text{ seconds}} $$ So, the faster team will finish the race $\boxed{312 \text{ seconds}}$ ahead of the slower team.
Response:  We know that Jerry threw a six-sided die. The probability of throwing an even number is $ \frac{1}{2} $. So, the probability of throwing a larger number than 3 is $\frac{5}{6}$. Therefore, the probability of throwing two consecutive numbers greater than 3 is $\frac{4}{6}$, and so on.
Response:  If Jenna collected half of her mother's apples, then she collected $\frac{1}{2}$ x $20$ = $10$ apples. So, in total, both Jenna and her mother collected $10 + 10 = 20$ apples.
Response:  We know that there are 3 groups of mice and each group has 10 mice. So, in total, there are 3 x 10 = 30 mice.  Now, we know that each mouse gets 6 pieces of hay. Therefore, the total number of pieces of hay given to all the mice is 30 x 6 = 180 pieces of hay. Since there are no other animals or food sources in the store, it means that all 180 pieces of hay were given to the mice.  Finally, since there are 10 clutches of hamsters and each clutch has 5 hamsters, there are 10 x 5 = 50 hamsters in total. And since each hamster gets 5 pieces of hay, the total number of pieces of hay given to all the hamsters is 50 x 5 = 250 pieces of hay.
Response:  If Mandy won $100 from Benedict and agreed to pay him an interest of 2% per month, then after 3 months, Benedict will have earned $6 in interest ($100 x 2%). So, if Mandy pays Benedict after 3 months, she should give him $106 ($100 + $6).
Response:  We know that the merchant bought several bags of wheat from the farmer for $20 per bag and sold all the bags at $30 each. So, he earned a total profit of $1000 = ($30 x number of bags sold). Since he paid $2 per bag for transportation, his total cost is $2 x number of bags transported. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: Profit = Total Cost + Number of Bags Sold x Price Per Bag Substituting the given values, we get: Profit = $1000 + (number of bags sold) x $30 = $1000 + (x) x $30 = $1000 + x = 400 x $30 = 12,000 dollars. Solving for x, we find that the merchant sold 12 bags of wheat.
"Response:  Firstly, they spent $20.25 on tickets. Then, they spent less than $4.50 on food, so let's say they spent $4.  
Next, they took two different rides that cost $33 each. So, in total, they spent $66 on rides. Finally, they had $17 left over after paying for everything else. Therefore, each of them paid $17 / 3 = $5.67."
"Response:  If John collects brzoskwinie for 3 hours and can collect 2 brzoskwinie per minute, then he will collect:

Time = 3 hours
Minutes/hour = 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
Total minutes = Time x Minutes/hour = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes

Since John can collect 2 brzoskwinie per minute, he will collect:

Number of brzoskwinie = Total minutes / Number of brzoskwinie per minute = 180 / 2 = 90 brzoskwinie."
Response:  We know that each chicken needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. If there are ten chickens in total, we need to multiply this amount by ten to find out how many pounds of insects they will need altogether. So, if ten chickens need 3.5 pounds of insects per week, then they will need a total of 35 pounds of insects per week (10 x 3.5 = 35).
Response:  At first, Tom had 50 trees. Every year he cuts down two trees and plants one new tree. So after 10 years, he has 50 + (2 x 10) = 70 trees. Now, 30% of the trees die every year, so in 10 years, 30% of 70 = 21 trees will die. Therefore, Tom has 70 - 21 = 49 trees left.
Response:  On Friday morning, there were 18 red plastic flamingos placed on Sue's lawn. Then, on Saturday morning, her neighbors took away one-third of them and painted them white. So, there were 12 white flamingos left on Sue's lawn. Finally, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 red flamingos to the collection. Therefore, in the afternoon of Sunday, there were 30 flamingos (12 white + 18 new red) on Sue's lawn. Thus, the answer is 30.
"Response:  We know that Violetta wants to buy new earrings and she has $20 for this purpose. Since one pair of earrings costs $2, we can calculate how many pairs she can buy with her budget as follows:

$20 / $2 = 10 pairs of earrings

So, Violetta wants to buy 10 different colors of earrings."
"Response:  We know that one ołówek costs $1.20 and one gumka costs $0.30. Therefore, we can calculate how much it will cost to buy 8 longpís:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60 for 8 ołówek
$0.30 x 8 = $2.40 for 8 gumek
Total cost of 8 longpís = $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00
Therefore, 8 longpís will cost $12.00."
"Response:  We have to divide $200 by the number of restaurants that will receive the mushrooms. Since each restaurant will get $2 worth of mushrooms, we need to find out how many restaurants can be accommodated with this amount.

$200 / $2 per restaurant = Number of restaurants that can be accommodated
= $100 (round off)

So, 100 restaurants can be accommodated with $200 worth of mushrooms."
Response:  We know that there are 23786 inhabitants in Soda and among them:  • 8417 are men (35.3%)  • 9092 are women (38.3%)  • The remaining population consists of children. So, we need to find out how many children there are in Soda. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of children = Total population - Number of adults Therefore, number of children in Sod = 23786 - (8417 + 9092) = 23786 - 17508 = 6278 children. Thus, there are approximately 6278 children living in Soda.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 cards. Then in the second month, she collected three times as many cards, so she had 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). However, in the third month, she collected two times fewer cards than in the previous months, so she had 40 cards (2 x 60 = 120 - 40 = 40). Therefore, Elaine currently has 40 cards.
Response:  We know that Mark is the editor and he edits 1000 sentences per week for two different publishers who pay him different fees. Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A. So, if Publisher A pays $ 5 per sentence, Publisher B pays $ 10 per sentence. Therefore, Mark earns $ 5 x 500 = $ 2500 from Publisher A and $ 10 x 500 = $ 5000 from Publisher B, in total $ 7500 per week.
"Response: 
1. In the morning, Baldur gets 5 vials of water = 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water.
2. In the evening, he gets another 6 vials of water = 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water.
Total amount of water received by Baldur per day = 25 + 30 = 55 liters."
"Response:  If John receives an award in his work and the award includes a one-time cash prize of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary, then he will earn more money in that year.  If he earns $2000 per week throughout the year (which is 43 weeks), and he received the award on the first day of the year, then he will have earned a total of:

$2000 x 43 = $86,000 in salary for the year
+ $5000 = $86,000 + $5000 = $91,000 in total income for the year
So John will have earned $91,000 in that year."
Response:  If each acre of land produces 5 tons of grapes per year and each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, then we can calculate how many barrels of wine her farm produces in total as follows:  Barrels of wine = Tons of grapes x Yards of wine/ton So, if an acre of land produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then the total number of barrels of wine produced by that acre is equal to 5 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels of wine per acre. Since there are 40 acres of land under cultivation, the total number of barrels of wine produced by the entire farm is equal to 10 barrels/acre x 40 acres = 400 barrels of wine per year.
Response: 1) Carl had cheese for breakfast every day and used 2 pieces of cheese per sandwich. So he used 4 pieces of cheese (2 x 2 = 4) in total for breakfast. 2) He also had eggs and bacon for breakfast three days a week, and used one piece of cheese more than he did on other days. So he used an additional 3 pieces of cheese (1 + 3 = 4) for these days. 3) For lunch, he had a canape with cheese every day, and used 1/4 of a piece of cheese per canape. So he used a total of 4 pieces of cheese (4 x 1/4 = 1) for lunch. 4) In addition to this, he made a large meal with macaroni and cheese once a week, using 8 pieces of cheese (8 x 1 = 8). Therefore, the total number of pieces of cheese that Carl used is: 4 + 4 + 1 + 8 = 17 pieces of cheese.
Response:  We know that Janet had 22 green and 10 yellow pens initially. Then she bought 6 works of blue pens and 2 works of red pens. In each work of blue pens, there are 9 pens, and in each work of red pens, there are 6 pens. So, we can write an equation as follows: Green pens = 22 + 6 = 28 Blue pens = 6 x 9 = 54 Red pens = 2 x 6 = 12 Total number of pens = 28 + 54 + 12 = 94 Therefore, Janet has 94 pens altogether.
Response:  We know that Mr. Bert allows students to remove their lowest score from each semester's average. So, if Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 in the first five tests, he can remove his lowest score (which is 71) from his overall average. Therefore, his updated average would be:  $89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 457$  Now, we need to find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to have an average of 93. To do this, we divide the total number of points earned by the number of tests taken:  $457 / 6 = 76$  So, Brinley needs to earn at least 76 points on the sixth test to have an average of 93.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Michael rode his bike at least 5 times per week for 4 weeks, which means he covered a total distance of 5 x 4 = 20 kilometers per week. Then, he reduced the number of rides to twice a week and increased the distance to 60 kilometers per ride, which means he covered a total distance of 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers in the next 3 weeks. Therefore, Michael traveled a total distance of 20 + 120 = 140 kilometers during the entire period.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 batons of chocolate and 80 candied apples in total. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so...

$$ \therefore Total weight of chocolate bars = 2 \times Total weight of candied apples $$

We also know that each chocolate bar weighs $40$ grams, so...

$$ \therefore Total weight of chocolate bars = 2 \times Total weight of candied apples \times 40 $$

Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:

$$ \therefore Total weight of chocolate bars = 2 \times 80 \times 40 = 16000 grams $$

So, the weight of Joe's bag of candy is $160$ grams."
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 pastries. Then on Wednesday, she bought 3 times more than she bought on Monday, which means she bought 12 pastries (3 x 4 = 12). Finally, on Thursday, she bought 5 times as many pastries as she bought on Wednesday, which means she bought 60 pastries (5 x 12 = 60). So in total, Rose bought 78 pastries over three days (4 + 12 + 60 = 78).
Response:  We know that dwadzieścia tuzinów (twenty) kubków will cost $1200 less than half a talent. So, if we divide the total cost of half a talent by two, we get: Half a talent = $6000 / 2 = $3000 per unit. Therefore, each cubic meter costs $3000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $10 before she starts taking care of her neighbor's children.  Then, for each time she takes care of them (which is four times), she earns $5. So, in total, she earns $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 = $20. Now, let's calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn to have enough money for the new shirt and shoes. Since it costs $30 for the kaftan and $20 for the shoes, she needs to mow the lawn $30 / $20 = 1.5 times to buy both items. However, since she already has $10, she only needs to mow the lawn an additional 0.5 times ($10 / $20 = 0.5) or once more. Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn twice to be able to afford the new clothes.
Response:  We know that red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. So, in total, Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Now, we are told that there are twice as many white chickens as red chickens. This means that for every 2 red chickens, there is 1 white chicken. Therefore, if there are x red chickens, then there are 2x white chickens. Finally, since there are more white chickens than red chickens, the number of red chickens must be less than half the number of white chickens. So, we can set up the equation: x < 2x = 10 (since there are 10 white chickens). Solving for x, we get: x = 5. Therefore, there are 5 red chickens and 10 white chickens.
"Response:  The park is a rectangle with dimensions of 1.5 meters wide and 6 meters long. If he walks at a speed of 5 kilometers per hour, we can convert this to meters per hour using the conversion factor of 1 kilometer = 1000 meters. So, his walking speed in meters per hour is:

Speed = Distance / Time = 1.5 m x 6 m / 5 km/h = 30 meters per hour
Now, let's calculate how many hours it will take him to walk around the entire park:

Time = Distance / Speed = 6 m / 30 m/h = 200 minutes or 3.33 hours
Therefore, if Gary Lubi chodzić po krawędzi parku, which is a rectangle with dimensions of 1.5 meters wide and 6 meters long, he will spend approximately 3.33 hours walking around the entire park if he maintains a constant speed of 5 kilometers per hour."
"Response:  On day 1, Sloane had 100 customers entering the store. If she added 50 more customers on the second day and 300 more customers on the third day (for a total of 450), then the number of customers on each day was as follows: Day 1: 100 + 50 = 150; Day 2: 150 + 50 = 200; Day 3: 200 + 300 = 500. Therefore, the number of customers that Sloane counted on the third day was 500."
Response:  We know that Jerry has two bathtubs with leaks and they empty 4 gallons per minute.  Then we are told that there were 4 minutes of leaking. So, in total, Jerry lost 4 x 4 = 16 gallons of water during those 4 minutes. Now, we need to find out how much water is left in each bathtub after losing 16 gallons. For the small bathtub, we can use the fact that it has only half as much water as the big one. So, if the big bathtub had 80 gallons of water initially (since it has four times as much water as the small bathtub), then the small bathtub had 40 gallons of water initially. After losing 16 gallons, the small bathtub now has 40 - 16 = 24 gallons of water remaining. Therefore, the small bathtub still contains 24 gallons of water.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lori has after buying shoes and a purse. The cost of shoes is $320, and the cost of a purse is $32. So, the total amount she will spend is $352 ($320 + $32). Now, let's check how many hours she needs to work to earn enough money for that purchase. Her half-time job pays her $8 per hour, so she works for half an hour (i.e., 4 hours) to earn $32 ($8 x 4 hours). Therefore, Lori needs to work for 16 hours (($352 - $32) / $32) to buy those items.
Response:  We know that $2000 is the amount borrowed and $200 is the monthly payment for 12 months. To calculate how much will be left after 12 payments, we can use the formula: Total Amount = (Initial Amount x Monthly Payment) / Number of Payments. In this case, Initial Amount = $2000, Monthly Payment = $165, and Number of Payments = 12. So, Total Amount = ($2000 x $165) / 12 = $3874. Therefore, at the end of 12 months, there will be $3874 left in the account.
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the whole area and seven more than roses in the vase. So, if we want to find out how many flowers are in the vase, we can use the following equation: Number of flowers in the vase = Total number of flowers - Number of flowers outside the vase. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of flowers in the vase = 4 + (7 - 4) = 13. Therefore, there are 13 flowers in the vase.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet is half as old as Zack. So we can write:
Adrian = 3 \* Harriet
Harriet = Zack / 2
Now we want to find out how old they are after 3 years. For this, we use the formula for calculating the age of a person in years:
Age = Year of birth - Current year
So if Harriet was born 7 years ago (i.e., she is currently 21 years old), then her age after 3 years will be:
Age of Harriet = 7 + 3 = 10 years
Similarly, Adrian's age after 3 years will be:
Age of Adrian = 3 \* 10 = 30 years
Zack's age after 3 years will be:
Age of Zack = 21 + 3 = 24 years
Therefore, the average age of these three people after 3 years will be:
Average age = (Age of Adrian + Age of Zack) / 3
= (30 + 24) / 3
= 54 years"
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored more than Naomi. So, Yuri scored at least 69 points (since 68 + 1 = 69). Moreover, Brianna scored more than Naomi but less than Yuri. Therefore, Brianna scored between 69 and 74 points (since 68 + 1 = 69, and 73 > 69). Now, we have three constraints: 69 ≤ Brianna’s score ≤ 74. Solving this inequality, we get Brianna’s score as 71 points. Finally, since Jojo did not mention anything about his score being higher or lower than any of the other students', he must have scored exactly 75 points (the highest possible score among all the students). Thus, the final scores are: Naomi - 68 points, Yuri - 71 points, Brianna - 71 points, and Jojo - 75 points.
Response:  We know that Carmen takes 10 minutes to solve one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve one Sudoku puzzle. If she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles during the weekend, then we can calculate how much time she spent solving those puzzles as follows: Time spent on crosswords = Number of crosswords x Time per crossword = 3 x 10 = 30 minutes Time spent on Sudokus = Number of Sudokus x Time per Sudoku = 8 x 5 = 40 minutes Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes (30 + 40) solving crossword puzzles and Sudoku puzzles during the weekend.
Response:  We know that initially, the tank was filled with 120 liters of water. Then, Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, we have:  Water left in the tank = Initial amount - Amount used = 120 - 90 = 30 liters. Therefore, there are currently 30 liters of water remaining in the tank.
"Response:  We know that Andy planted fewer geraniums than petunias. So, he planted 90 - 40 = 50 more petunias than geraniums. In total, Andy planted 50 + 90 = 140 kwiats (kwiat is Polish for ""flower"")."
Response:  In year one, the company spends $15,000 on advertising. Since it then reduces its spendings to one-third of that amount in the next year, we can assume that in year two, the company spends $5,000 on advertising (i.e., $15,000 x 1/3 = $5,000). Therefore, the total amount spent by the company on advertising over these two years is: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.
Response:  If Carlos uses the kayak for 3 hours and pays $30 per hour, he will pay $90 ($30 x 3).  If Benji uses the banana boat for 5 hours and pays $18 per hour, he will pay $90 ($18 x 5).  So, in total, they will pay $180.
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half a day to get back to New Jersey by car, then we can calculate the total time as follows: Day 1: Traveling from New Jersey to Rochester by bus (6 days) + Day 2-3: Spending time in Rochester (not specified) + Day 4: Return journey from Rochester to New Jersey by car (half a day) = Total time for the trip = 6 + x + 0.5 = 6.5 days Where 'x' is the number of unspecified days spent in Rochester. Therefore, the answer is 6.5 days.
Response:  We know that James has 40 cards of type water and he lost 8 of them, so now he has 32 cards of type water left.  Then, he bought 14 new cards of type grass, which means he now has 46 cards of type grass in total.  Now, let's calculate the percentage of his remaining water cards:  Percentage = (Number of Water Cards / Total Number of Cards) x 100%  In this case, the number of water cards is 32 out of a total of 120 cards (since there are 40 types of water, 20 types of grass, and 30 types of fire). So, the percentage of water cards is:  Percentage = (32 / 120) x 100%  = 26.67%  Therefore, the probability that the randomly selected card will be of type water is approximately 26.67%.
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito without any additional items: $6.50 (burrito price) + $2 (additional meat) = $8.50. Next, we need to add the costs of the additional items: $1 (extra cheese) + $1 (avocado) + $0.25 (salsa) x 2 = $3.75. Finally, if he wants something better for an extra $3, that would be $3 + $0.25 (drink) = $3.25. So, in total, he needs to pay $8.50 + $3.75 + $3.25 = $15.50.
Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can add half of that (2 pieces/minute), it means they will take different amounts of time to complete the puzzle. To find out how long it will take them together, we need to calculate their combined rate in pieces per minute:  Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mother's rate = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces/minute Now, let's find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle with this combined rate: Time taken = Number of pieces / Combined rate = 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes So, it will take Kalinda and her mother 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.
Response:  We know that out of 120 small watermelons, 30 were ready to be harvested after two months. So, Ashlyn took those 30 watermelons home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons (which is equal to 75) were ready to be harvested. Therefore, there were 45 watermelons left unharvested after two weeks.  So, the number of watermelons not yet ready for harvest after two weeks is 45.
Response:  Firstly, Mark buys 12 cars for his company at $20,000 each, so he pays a total of $240,000 ($20,000 x 12) for them. Secondly, he pays 10% tax on the value of the cars, which is $24,000 ($240,000 x 10%). Thirdly, he has to pay registration fees of $1,000 per car, so he pays an additional $12,000 ($1,000 x 12). Therefore, in total, Mark pays $366,000 ($240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000) for the 12 cars.
Response:  On Monday (poniedziałek), Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so she collects 5 + 20 = 25 shells.  On Tuesday (wtorek), Kylie collects twice as many shells as she collected on Monday, so she collects 2 \* 25 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesdays.
"Response:  If there were initially 50 mice and Dax found half of them, then the number of mice left in the garden is:

$$ \text {Number of mice} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 $$

Now, if there were initially as many robots as mice, then the total number of robots and mice in the garden is:

$$ \text {Total number of robots + Total number of mice} = 25 + 25 = 50 $$

Therefore, the total number of owads (robots+mice) in the garden is $50$."
Response:  We know that there are 36 penguins in total and one-third of them have already jumped into the ocean. So, if we divide the remaining number of penguins by three, we get:  Number of penguins left = Total number of penguins - (Number of penguins who jumped into the ocean / 3)  In this case, the total number of penguins is 36, and one-third of them have already jumped into the ocean, which means that 12 penguins have jumped into the ocean. Therefore, the number of penguins left to opalai is: Number of penguins left = 36 - (12 / 3) = 36 - 4 = 32 penguins.
Response:  We know that Steve eats two more tomatoes than his girlfriend and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats six times more than his girlfriend. If a vine can produce three tomatoes per week, then we need to find out how many vines Steve needs to have in order to eat six times as much as his girlfriend. So, let x be the number of vines needed for Steve to eat six times as much as his girlfriend. Then, we know that Steve eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend, so he needs 2x vines. Finally, since he wants to grow his own cherry tomatoes, he needs additional vines equal to the number of tomatoes he already eats (6-2x). Therefore, the final answer is 10 vines.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend will get 4 slices of pizza. Since pizzas are sold in 8 pieces only, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order:

20 / 8 = 5
So John needs to order 5 pizzas."
Response:  If he can mix five empty ink cartridges to make one full one, then he has 5/1 = 5 full ink cartridges left after mixing them.  If he buys 25 ink cartridges and uses them all up producing new ones when he runs out of atrament, then he has 25 - 5 = 20 full ink cartridges left.
Response:  If John took $20 and added $10 to it, he now has $30. Then, if he invested this amount of money which doubled in one year, then after one year he would have $60. So, the correct answer is $60.
"Response:  We know that:
Mary is two years younger than Joan, who is five years older than Jessica.
Jessica has an age of 20 years old.
So we can write down the equation as follows:
Joan's age = Mary's age + 5 (since Joan is 5 years older than Mary)
Mary's age = Jessica's age - 2 (since Mary is 2 years younger than Jessica)
Substituting the values from the second equation into the first one gives us:
Joan's age = Jessica's age - 10 (since Mary's age is equal to Jessica's age minus 2)
Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
Joan's age + Mary's age + Jessica's age = 30 + (-2) + 20 = 52 years old"
Response:  We know that 30% of students left through exit A, so the number of students who left through exits B and C together is 70%. Since there are three possible exits (A, B, and C), the total number of students who left through these exits is 70% of 1000, which is 700. Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is 700 / 3 = 233.
Response:  We know that James has six more candy than Robert. So, if Robert has x candies, then James has x + 6 = x + 7 = 13 candies.  Now we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has 2x = 2(x) = 2(13) = 26 candies. Therefore, John has 26 - 13 = 13 more candies than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they will have three books to read. So, if they read each other's books, they will have a total of six books to read (3 + 3). Therefore, they will be able to read six books altogether until the end.
Response:  We know that Mike was corresponding with five people and he stopped writing to two of them. Each of these two people sends him two letters per week, which means they write a total of 10 letters per week (2 letters/week x 5 people). Since each letter takes Mike 6 minutes to write, he spends a total of 60 minutes per week on writing replies (10 letters x 6 minutes/letter). Therefore, Mike spends 1 hour per week on writing replies.
"Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 minutes of phone calls per month and he uses them up in 30 days. So, we can calculate how many minutes he used each day as follows:

Minutes used per day = Total minutes / Number of days
= 1000 / 30
= 33.33 minutes/day

Now, let's find out how many minutes Jason talked to his boss each day:

Minutes talked to boss per day = Total minutes spent talking to boss / Number of days
= 15 minutes/day x 30 days
= 450 minutes

Finally, let's add the total minutes used by Jason for all his conversations with different people:

Total minutes used = Minutes used per day x Number of days
= 33.33 minutes/day x 30 days
= 1000 minutes

So, the answer is 1000 minutes."
"Response:  We know that:

* Griffin had 24 fritkies initially (given)
* Kyle took 5 of them (given)
* Billy took twice as many as Kyle (implied)
* Ginger gave Griffin some fritkies (given)
* Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle (given)

Now let's analyze each piece of information separately and then combine it to find out how many fritkies Ginger gave to Griffin:

1. Griffin had 24 fritkies initially: This means that after Kyle took 5 of them, Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fritkies left.
2. Kyle took 5 of them: So, Kyle took 5 fritkies from Griffin, leaving him with 19 - 5 = 14 fritkies.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle: Since Billy took twice as many fritkies as Kyle, he took 2 x 5 = 10 fritkies from Griffin. Now, Griffin has 14 - 10 = 4 fritkies left.
4. Ginger gave Griffin some fritkies: Without knowing how many fritkies Ginger gave Griffin, we can't determine the final number of fritkies Griffin has. However, since Ginger gave him some fritkies, she didn't take any away.
5. Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle: If Colby took 3 fewer fritkies than Kyle, he took 3 - 5 = -2 fritkies from Griffin. But since Griffin already has 4 fritkies left, this is impossible. Therefore, Colby did not take any fritkies from Griffin.

Now, let's add up all the fritkies taken or given:

Kyle took 5 fritkies + Billy took 10 fritkies + Ginger gave some fritkies = Total fritkies taken/given = 15

So, Ginger gave Griffin 15 - 14 = 1 more frit"
"Response:  In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails.  In the second aquarium, there are 32 fish. If we assume that the number of fish in each aquarium is equal to the number of snails in the other aquarium, then we can write an equation based on this assumption:

Number of fish in first aquarium = Number of snails in second aquarium

Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:

Number of fish in first aquarium = 4
Number of snails in second aquarium = 32

So, we have two equations and two unknowns (the number of fish in the first aquarium and the number of snails in the second aquarium). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the answers:

Number of fish in first aquarium = 8
Number of snails in second aquarium = 16

Therefore, the answer to the question is 8 for the number of fish in the first aquarium and 16 for the number of snails in the second aquarium."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time Jean spends getting ready for each day of filming. Since she needs to get ready for 6 hours per day and films for 5 days in total, that means she spends 30 hours (6 x 5) getting ready for the movie.  Next, we need to calculate how much money Jean pays for makeup services. According to the question, Jean pays $250 per hour, so if she spends 30 hours getting ready for the movie, then she pays a total of $7,500 ($250/hour x 30 hours).  Now let's consider the discount that the makeup artist gives Jean after the filming is completed. The question states that the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, which means that Jean will pay $6,800 instead of $7,500 for the makeup services ($7,500 x 90%).  Finally, we can calculate how much Jean paid in total for the makeup services by subtracting the discount amount from the original price: $7,500 - $6,800 = $700. So, Jean paid $700 for the makeup services.
Response:  We know that Isabella spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on gift bags for guests. To find out how much each parent paid, we can divide these costs equally among them. So, if there are three parents, they will pay $12 / 3 = $4 each for the ingredients of the cake. Similarly, they will pay $43 / 3 = $14 each for the birthday gifts, $15 / 3 = $5 each for the decorations, $4 / 3 = $1.33 each for the invitations, and $22 / 3 = $7.67 each for the gift bags. Therefore, each parent will pay $4 + $14 + $5 + $1.33 + $7.67 = $30.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the chef bought 4 works of cabbage. Since each work weights 50 pounds, then the total weight of all cabbages is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Secondly, we are told that each kilogram of cabbage costs $1.5. Therefore, the cost of all cabbages is 200 pounds x $1.5 per pound = $300. Finally, we are asked to find out how much did the chef pay for all this cabbage. So, the answer is $300.
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate four times more cookies than her sister. So if her sister ate x cookies, then Sue ate 4x cookies. In total, they both ate x + 4x = 5x cookies on Monday.  Then on Tuesday, Sue ate two times more cookies than her sister. So if her sister ate y cookies, then Sue ate 2y cookies. In total, they both ate y + 2y = 3y cookies on Tuesday.  Now we know that Sue ate 5x cookies on Monday and 3y cookies on Tuesday. To find out how many calories Sue ate more than her sister, we need to subtract the number of calories in 3y cookies from the number of calories in 5x cookies. There are 200 calories in each cookie, so:  Number of calories in 5x cookies = 5x \* 200 = 1000 calories Number of calories in 3y cookies = 3y \* 200 = 600 calories Difference between Sue and her sister = 1000 - 600 = 400 calories Therefore, Sue ate 400 calories more than her sister.
