"Response: 
Janet has $20 to spend on eggs each day (16 eggs x $1 = $16). She spends $4 on breakfast every morning ($4/day x 5 days = $20) and $3 on muffins for her friends ($3/day x 4 days = $12). So she has $7 left over from her budget after buying eggs and breakfast ($20 - $16 - $20 - $12 = $7). Therefore, if she goes to the market every day and buys one fresh egg for $2, she will have $7 left over after five days ($7 / 5 = $1.40)."
"Response:  We know that we need 2 blue fibers and half as much white fiber. So, if we want n bolts, we will need:

Blue fibers = 2 x (1/2) = 1
White fibers = 2 x (1/2) = 1

So, in total, we need 3 bolts."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh spent $50,000 on renovating the house, which increased its value by 150% or $75,000 (since the original price of the house was $80,000). So, after renovation, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000. Now, let's calculate how much profit Josh made from selling the house. Profit = Selling price - Original price = $155,000 - $80,000 = $75,000. Therefore, Josh made a profit of $75,000 from selling the house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that James ran three sprints in one week (veka). Then, he ran each sprint for 60 meters. Therefore, the total distance he covered during all three sprints is:  Distance = Number of sprints x Length of each sprint  Distance = 3 x 60 = 180 meters. So, James ran a total distance of 180 meters in one week.
"Response:  We know that Wendy has to give food to 20 chickens every day. In three meals, she will give them 30 kopp (baskets) of mixed feed containing grains, vegetables, and fruit to keep them healthy. She gives them 15 kopp in the morning, 25 kopp in the afternoon, and 10 kopp at night. Since the size of the mountain is 20 chickens, we can calculate how many kopp of food each chicken needs per day as follows:

Number of chickens = Size of the mountain / Number of meals per day x Amount of food per meal
= 20 / 3 x 30
= 40 kopp
Therefore, Wendy needs to provide 40 kopp of food to each chicken every day."
Response:  If one glass of beer costs $5, then half a glass (quarter) would cost $\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$. So, if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will have to pay $\$2.5 \times 16 = \$40$.
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many pigs as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 4 = 8 pigs.  We also know that Charleston has four times as many pigs as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 2 = 8 pigs. Therefore, the total number of pigs in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 8 + 8 + 2 = 18 pigs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla has to download a 200 GB file. Secondly, we are told that Vanlegvis can transfer 2 GB per minute. Thirdly, we learn that 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces her to restart for installation updates, which takes 20 minutes. Finally, we see that Carla must restart again after the update is installed. Now let's calculate how long it will take to download the file: Time = Distance / Speed = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes. Therefore, Carla needs to wait approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes to complete the download.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John took three hours to travel with an average speed of 100 km/h during the first part of his journey. Then, he turned back and spent four hours traveling in the opposite direction at an average speed of 80 km/h. To find out how far he was from home after these four hours, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance would be: Distance = 80 km/h x 4 hours = 320 km. So, John was 320 km away from home after those four hours.
Response:  If Eliza works 40 hours in one week and gets $10 per hour, then she earns $400 for that week ($10/hour x 40 hours). Then, if she also gets an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly wage, she will earn an additional $48 for that week (($10/hour x 40 hours) x 1.2 = $48). Therefore, Eliza will have earned a total of $448 for that week ($400 + $48 = $448).
Response:  In the first month, there were 4 uploadings (2 x 2 = 4).  In the second month, there were 3 times as many downloads as in the first month, so in the second month, there were 4 x 3 = 12 downloads.  In the third month, there was a drop of 30%, so in the third month, there were 12 / 0.7 = 17 downloads. Therefore, the number of uploadings has increased by 17 - 4 = 13 times during this period.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toula bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $68 per dozen = $68 x 3 = $194.  Next, she bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen = $80 x 2 = $160. Finally, she bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes which cost $55 per dozen = $55 x 6 = $330. Therefore, the total cost of all the baked goods is $194 + $160 + $330 = $684.
Response:  First year:  * Carlos spends $90 to buy and maintain the tree. He gets $7 in fruit sales ($1.5/each x 7). Total revenue = $90 + $7 = $97. Cost = $3/year. Breakeven point = Revenue / Cost = $97 / $3 = 32 years. So it will take Carlos 32 years to break even on his investment.
Response:  Since Melanie owns one third of the shares in each house (door-to-door), she has 3/3 = 1 share in the green house, 2/3 = 2 shares in the red house, and 1/3 = 1 share in the orange house. Therefore, Melanie has a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 suckers.
"Response:  We know that out of 20 students in the dance class, 20% took contemporary dance, which means 4 students (20% x 20) took contemporary dance. Similarly, we know that 25% of the students took jazz dance, which means 5 students (25% x 20) took jazz dance. Now, let's find out how many students took hip hop dance. Since you said ""resten"", which means ""the remaining"" or ""the others"", it implies that all the students who didn't take any of those three dances are taking hip hop dance. So, the number of students who took hip hop dance is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who took contemporary dance and jazz dance. Therefore, the answer is: Number of students who took hip hop dance = Total number of students - Number of students who took contemporary dance - Number of students who took jazz dance Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of students who took hip hop dance = 20 - 4 - 5 = 11 students."
Response:  If the buyer chooses the jewelry worth $5,000, he will have a maximum win of $3,000 (i.e., $5,000 - $2,000).  If he chooses the electronic devices worth $8,000, he will also have a maximum win of $3,000 (i.e., $8,000 - $5,000). Therefore, the buyer can maximize his win by choosing either option A or B.
Response:  On day one, they traveled for 130 kilometers, so the distance after one day is:  Distance = Speed x Time = 130 km/h x 24 hours = 3040 km After one day, they traveled 3040 kilometers.  On the second day, they traveled for 150 kilometers, so the total distance after two days is: Total distance = Distance from Day 1 + Distance from Day 2 = 3040 km + 150 km = 3190 km Therefore, the distance after two days is 3190 kilometers.
"Response:  As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 50 weeks per year, which means she earns:

$20/hour x 50 weeks = $1000 per week as a teacher

As a cheerleading coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 weeks per year, which means she earns:

$30/hour x 15 weeks = $450 per week as a coach

So, in total, Jill earns:

$1000 + $450 = $1450 per week

Therefore, Jill has thought about having earned around $1450 per week."
"Response:  If Claire makes an omelette with three eggs for breakfast every morning, and she has been doing this for four weeks, then...

1. On the first day of week 1, there are 3 eggs used to make the omelette.
2. On the second day of week 1, there are still 3 eggs left from the previous day (no new eggs were added).
3. On the third day of week 1, there are still 3 eggs left from the previous two days (no new eggs were added).
4....and so on until the fourth week, where there will be 3 x 4 = 12 eggs remaining after making 28 omelettes (one per day).

Therefore, if Claire continues to make one omelette per day using three eggs each time, she will have approximately 12 eggs remaining after four weeks."
Response:  We know that Marissa walked 12 miles in total and it took her 2 hours to walk the first 4 kilometers. Therefore, she walked the next 2 kilometers in 1 hour. To find out her average speed, we need to divide the distance she walked by the time she spent walking. So, her average speed is 4 miles per hour. Now, to find out the remaining distance she needs to walk, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance left to walk is: Distance = 12 miles / 4 miles/hour = 3 miles.
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that is two-thirds water and we want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three-fifths water. So, we need to calculate how much water each drink contains. Orange juice has 2/3 = 66.67% water, so it contains 6.67 liters of water. Pineapple juice has 3/5 = 60% water, so it contains 9 liters of water. Now, let's find out how much water they contain in total: 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water. Since we started with 10 liters of orange juice, after mixing it with 15 liters of pineapple juice, there are now 10 - 15.67 = 4.33 liters of water left. Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the 24 liters is 4.33 / 24 = 0.18 liters or approximately 0.18 milliliters.
Response:  We know that Raymond was born six years before Samantha and he is three years older than his sister. So, if Samantha is 31 years old now, then she must have been born when Raymond was 23 years old. Therefore, the son of Raymond was born 6 + 3 = 9 years ago.
Response:  We know that Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday and he sold one DVD to each of the first three customers. So, he sold 3 DVDs in total. Then, he sold no DVDs to the next two customers, so he didn't sell any more DVDs after that. Finally, we know that the last three customers did not buy any DVDs either. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 3 + 0 = 3.
"Response:  If we have a stearin candle that burns with two centimeters per minute when it is burning, how many centimeters will it be when it has been burning for one to five minutes?

Step-by-step calculation:
1. Time = 1 min (burning rate of 2 cm/min) = 0.06 meters (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute)
2. Time = 5 min (burning rate of 2 cm/min) = 3 meters (since there are 300 seconds in 5 minutes)

Therefore, if a stearin candle burns at a rate of 2 cm/min, it will be approximately 3 meters long after burning for 1 to 5 minutes."
Response:  We know that Kyle bought the best-selling book last year for $19.50 with a 25% discount from its original price. So we can write an equation as follows: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 + Discount Percentage) Book Original Price = $19.50 / (1 + 0.25) Book Original Price = $78.00 Therefore, the original price of the book was $78.00.
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for her meal and we are asked how many boxes of pizza she bought if each box costs $8.50. To find out, we can divide the total amount Marie paid ($50) by the cost of one box of pizza ($8.50):

$50 / $8.50 = 6

So, Marie bought 6 boxes of pizza."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mishka bought 3 pairs of short pants, which cost $16.50 each. Therefore, she spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on short pants. Similarly, she spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on regular pants and $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes. So in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.00 on all clothes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Cynthia has 30 portions of ice cream left in the evening (30/4 = 7.5). Since she buys 15 portions of ice cream with each portion costing $4, then her total expenditure will be:  Total Expenditure = Number of Portions x Price Per Portion = 15 x $4 = $60. Now, after 60 days, if she consumes 15 portions of ice cream every day, then the number of portions she will have at the end of 60 days can be calculated as follows: Number of Portions After 60 Days = Remaining Portions x Daily Consumption = 7.5 x 15 = 112.5 portions. Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will have 112.5 portions of ice cream left.
Response:  We know that Henry made two stops during his 100-kilometer bike ride. The first stop was before he had traveled 20 miles (i.e., 20/100 = 0.2 kilometers), and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the race (i.e., 85/100 = 0.85 kilometers). So, between these two stops, Henry traveled a total distance of 0.2 + 0.85 = 0.95 kilometers.
Response:  We know that Gloria is looking for shoes that fit her budget of $50. She has two options: a pair of high heels that cost $33 each or a pair of flats that cost $27 each. If she buys both pairs, she will spend a total of $64 ($33 + $31). So, if she wants to save money, she should choose the flats. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $27.
Response:  If Darrel and Allen are 7 years older than him, that means they are 169 - 7 = 162 years old. So if he is 10 years younger than them, then his age would be 162 - 10 = 152 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we have Gunter who has 60% of the jar filled with jam (marmalade). Then, one of his friends says that he has 20% more than Gunter, which means he has 72% of the jar filled with jam. Another friend says that he has 25% more than the second friend, which means he has 93% of the jar filled with jam. So, the average amount of jam in the jar is (60 + 72 + 93) / 3 = 81%.
"Response:  If John takes care of ten dogs and each dog needs 1.5 hours per day to go out and do its business, then in one week (7 days), John will spend:

$$ Time = Number \times Required time per day $$
Time = 10 \times 1.5 = 15 hours/day

Now, let's calculate how many hours John spends taking care of the dogs in one week:

$$ Total hours = Daily hours x Number of days $$
Total hours = 15 hours/day x 7 days = 105 hours/week

Therefore, John spends approximately 105 hours per week taking care of his ten dogs."
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we divide the number of gold coins (30) by the number of silver coins (80), we get:  Number of gold coins = 30 / 80 = 0.375 or 37.5%. Therefore, Gretchen has approximately 37.5% of her coins as gold coins.
Response:  We know that Siobhan has fewer jewels than Aaron. So if Aaron has x jewels, Siobhan has less than x jewels. Also, we know that Aaron has five more jewels than Raymond. So if Raymond has y jewels, Aaron has y + 5 = z jewels. Now we are given that Aaron has 30 more jewels than Siobhan. So if Siobhan has x jewels, Aaron has (x + 30) jewels. Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is x = 20.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he scored an average of 0.2 points per minute (4/20).  In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the previous period, which means he scored 0.375 points per minute (25% of 0.2 = 0.05). Therefore, his total score is: 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 points.
Response:  If Terry sells 4 yogurts per day and each yogurt costs $5, then he earns total revenue of $20 per day ($5 x 4). To calculate how many days Terry can afford to buy yogurt with his daily income, we need to divide his daily revenue by the cost of one yogurt: $20 / $5 = 4 days. So, Terry can afford to buy yogurt for 4 days in 30 days.
"Response:  Firstly, John sold all his Lego sets and got $15 in return. Then he used that money to buy video games, which cost him $20. So, he has $5 left after buying the video games. Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets John had initially. We know that he had 13 Lego sets, and he sold them for $15. Therefore, the number of Lego sets John had initially is:

Number of Lego sets = Initial price / Price per set
= $15 / $13
= 1

So, John had one Lego set initially."
Response:  On day one, he ran for 3 hours (3 x 60 = 180 minutes).  On day two, he ran for 2 hours (2 x 60 = 120 minutes). So in total, he ran for 180 + 120 = 300 minutes or 5 hours. Therefore, John ran for 5 hours.
Response:  If Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk and can jump at half the speed of running, then we know that her walking speed is 3 km/h.  Since she can run 4 times faster than she can walk, her running speed is 12 km/h (4 x 3 = 12).  Now, if she jumps at half the speed of running, her jumping speed is 6 km/h (half of 12 = 6).  To find out how many kilometers she can cover in an hour, we need to multiply her speed by the time she has been running or jumping.  For example, if she runs for 3 hours, she covers a distance of 3 x 12 = 36 km.  Similarly, if she jumps for 2 hours, she covers a distance of 2 x 6 = 12 km.  Therefore, if she runs and jumps alternately for 6 hours, she covers a total distance of 6 x (36 + 12) = 508 km.
Response:  We know that Brandon's iPhone is four years older than Ben's iPhone. So if Ben's iPhone is double as old as Suzy's iPhone, then Brandon's iPhone is also double as old as Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is eight years old (4 + 8 = 12).
Response:  First, we need to calculate how far the dragon is from Polly when she throws the mirror. Since it takes 300 meters for the fire to reach her, and she can throw the mirror 400 feet (120 meters), that means the dragon is 100 meters away from her when she throws the mirror.  Next, we need to calculate how long it takes for the fire to reach Polly after she throws the mirror. We know that the fire travels at a speed of 300 meters per minute, so it will take 1/60 of an hour (or 5 minutes) for the fire to reach her. Therefore, if Polly holds onto the stone for 5 minutes before throwing it, then the fire will hit her after 5 minutes have passed since she threw the mirror.  Now, let's consider what happens when the fire hits Polly. If she doesn't have any protection, she will be burned to death instantly. However, if she has some protection (such as a shield or armor), then she may survive the initial impact but still suffer severe injuries. In this case, let's assume that Polly has some protection that allows her to survive the initial impact but not the subsequent heat wave.  Finally, let's consider the range of the mirror's reflection. The question states that the mirror can reflect the fire back towards the dragon up to 400 feet (120 meters). This means that if Polly throws the mirror directly at the dragon, there is a chance that the reflected fire could hit him and deal damage. However, keep in mind that the dragon is much larger than Polly, so he may be able to withstand more damage than she can.  Based on these calculations, here are my answers to your questions:  Q: How far is the dragon from Polly when she throws the mirror? A: 100 meters  Q: How long does it take for the fire to reach Polly after she throws the mirror? A: 5 minutes  Q: Will Polly die immediately when the fire hits her? A: No, she will likely survive but suffer severe injuries  Q: Can the mirror's reflection hit the dragon and deal damage? A: Yes, but the dragon's size and strength make him
Response:  We know that Mormor Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut them into 8 pieces each. So, in total, she made 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie. Then, we are told that after all the guests had taken their share, there were 14 pieces left. Therefore, the number of guests who took pie was 14 - 40 = -26 guests. However, since this is a negative number, it means that no guests took any pie, as there were more pieces than guests present.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one serving of chips contains 250 calories.  If you eat 300 grams of chips, then you will consume more than one serving. So, let's calculate how many servings you are consuming based on your weight in kilograms.  Weight (kg) x Number of servings = Calories consumed (in kg)  Since you weigh 70 kg, if you eat 300 grams of chips, you are consuming approximately 4.29 servings (70 kg / 250 calories/serving). Now, to determine how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie intake of 2000 calories, we need to divide your total daily calorie intake by the number of servings you are consuming. Total daily calorie intake (in calories) / Number of servings = Grams of chips you can eat (in kg)  Therefore, if you want to stay within your daily calorie limit, you can eat up to 46.6 grams of chips (2000 calories / 4.29 servings).
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Charlie will make from selling each stearin light. Since it costs $10 per kilogram of beeswax and he can make 10 stearin lights with one kilogram, the cost price of each stearin light is $10 / 10 = $1. Therefore, if he sells each stearin light for $2, his profit is $2 - $1 = $1 per stearin light. Now, let's find out how many stearin lights Charlie can sell in total. If he has 20 stearin lights, and he needs to sell them all to break even, then the number of stearin lights he must sell is 20 / 1 = 20 stearin lights. So, his total profit from selling these 20 stearin lights is 20 x $1 = $20. Finally, we need to subtract the initial investment (the cost of the beeswax) from the total profit to get the net gain. In this case, the initial investment is $5 (since he paid $10 for the beeswax but only used half of it). Therefore, the net gain is $20 - $5 = $15.
Response:  On Monday, Meredith wrote five articles in four hours, so she spent 1 hour per article.  On Tuesday, she wrote ten articles in eight hours, so she spent 1.25 hours per article (8/6).  On Wednesday, she doubled her output and wrote twenty-five articles in six hours, so she spent 0.42 hours per article (6/13).  Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days is: 1 + 1.25 + 0.42 = 2.67 hours.
Response:  We know that Candice has 80 Post-it notes in her bag before she goes to work at the coffee shop. She then buys a pack of Post-it notes and uses one of them to label 220 different coffee cups at work. If she had 23 sets of 7 Post-it notes (which is equal to 161 Post-it notes), how many would she have in total? So, the answer is 161.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John buys twice as many rough slips as blue slips. So if he bought x blue slips, he bought 2x rough slips.  Secondly, we know that each rough slip costs 50% more than each blue slip. Therefore, the cost of one rough slip is $1.50 (50% more than $40). Thirdly, we are given that John spent $200 on blue slips. This means that he spent half of his budget on blue slips ($200 / 2 = $100). Finally, since he spends the same amount on both types of slips, we can conclude that he spent $100 on rough slips too ($100 + $100 = $200).  So, John spent $200 on slips in total.
Response:  We know that Tracy used four feet of thread to hold up the tomato plant in her garden. The thread was cut into two small pieces that were six inches long each. So, how many people do you think had handled the thread?  Well, if we divide the length of the thread (four feet) by the length of each piece (six inches), we get... (do the calculation)... Yes, that's right! Only one person, Tracy, had handled the thread!
Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in total and 3/4 of the building is occupied (which means 75% occupancy). Now we need to find out how many rooms are left unoccupied on each floor. Since 8 rooms per floor, we can calculate the number of unoccupied rooms as follows: Floor 1 - 8 rooms x 0.25 = 2 rooms Floor 2 - 8 rooms x 0.25 = 2 rooms... Floor 15 - 8 rooms x 0.25 = 2 rooms Total number of unoccupied rooms = 2 + 2 +... + 2 = 16 rooms Therefore, the total number of unoccupied rooms in the building is 16 rooms.
Response:  If Lloyd has an egg farm and sells each chicken for $2 per dozen, then he makes $2 x 12 = $24 per dozen sold. Since there are 7 days in a week, Lloyd sells eggs for $24 / 7 = $3.43 per day.
Response:  We know that Tom can ski at an average speed of 10 miles per hour (mph). He starts sailing from point A to point B between noon and 4 pm. Therefore, he moves at a speed of 11 km/h during this time period. To find out how long it takes him to come back, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is 22 miles (since he has already traveled 11 miles), so: Time = 22 miles / 10 mph = 2 hours and 20 minutes. So, it will take Tom approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes to come back.
"Response:  If Uriah has 14 kg of books and he takes away 30 pages, then his new weight will be:

14 kg - 30 pages = 11 kg

So, if he has 15 kg of toys and he takes away 30 toy cars, then his new weight with the toys will be:

15 kg - 30 toy cars = 12 kg

Therefore, the number of toy cars that must be taken away from him is:

30 - 12 = 18 toy cars"
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic repaired six truck tires and four car tires, so he earned $60 + $40 = $100 in total.  On Friday, he repaired twelve car tires but did not repair any truck tires, so he earned $40 x 12 = $480 in total. Therefore, the total amount of money the mechanic can earn in one day with multiple customers is $100 + $480 = $580.
Response:  According to the mother, Patchy has had three litters of kittens, while Trixie has had 12 litters. So, in total, the family Doubtfire has had: 3 + 12 = 15 litters of kittens.
Response:  Since Jean has 30 marbles and he wants to put two marbles in each of the remaining 28 slots, we can calculate the total number of filled slots as follows: Number of filled slots = Total number of slots - Number of empty slots = 28 - 30 = -2 The answer is therefore -2.
"Response:  If Peter pays $7 for each movie ticket and $7 for each bag of popcorn, then he spends a total of $14 per trip to the cinema. Since he has $42 in his budget for the week, we can calculate how many times he can go to the movies as follows:
Number of trips = Budget / Cost per trip
= $42 / $14
= 3 times
Therefore, Peter can go to the cinema three times with his current budget."
Response:  We know that the total weight of the truck and its load is 2275 kg. The maximum weight limit for the bridge is 5000 pounds or 2268 kg. So we need to find out how many pounds (or kg) are in each box. If there were no boxes at all, the truck would have a weight of 2275 kg, which is less than the maximum allowed weight for the bridge. Therefore, it must be possible to add more boxes without exceeding the weight limit. However, if we assume that each box has a weight of 10 kg (which is a reasonable assumption), then we can calculate the number of boxes as follows: Number of boxes = Total weight of truck - Maximum weight limit for bridge / Weight per box = 2275 kg - 2268 kg / 10 kg = 7 boxes In this case, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit for the bridge is 7 boxes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Stephen made an online purchase of food worth $40. Then he received a discount of 25% of the total amount, which is equal to $10 (25% x $40 = $10). So, his new price after discount became $30 ($40 - $10). Next, he gave $3 as a tip and also paid an extra fee of $5, making the final cost of the food to be $38 ($30 + $3 + $5). Therefore, the last price of the food for Stephen was $38.
Response:  We know that there are 6 clusters of fruit on the bush, and each cluster has 20 fruits remaining. Therefore, the total number of fruits on the bush is: 6 x 20 = 120 fruits. Additionally, we know that there are 67 individual fruits scattered across the bush. So, in total, there are 120 + 67 = 187 fruits on the bush.
Response:  If 25 apples are good and 2 are sour, that means there are 23 good apples. Since 80% of them are good (23/25), we can say that 19 apples are good. So, to answer your question, many apples are good if you have at least 19 of them.
Response:  Firstly, Janet paid $500 for the material of the bracelet. Then she paid $800 to the jewelry maker for labor costs. Finally, she paid 10% of the total cost as insurance premium. So, in total, Janet paid $500 + $800 + (10% x $500) = $1300.
"Response:  After working for the same company for 40 years, Visc Marcy is entitled to a pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of her pension per year. Since she took it after 30 years, we can calculate how much she got as follows:
Pension value at time of taking it = $50,000 x (1 + 5% x 20 years) = $750,000
So, Visc Marcy received $750,000 as her pension after working for 30 years."
Response:  In the first six months of the year, the streaming service takes $140 per month. Then in the next six months, it takes $126 ($140 x 90%) per month. So, in total, you have paid $1376 ($140 x 9 = $1260 + $126 x 6 = $786) to watch videos online during the year.
Response:  We know that Sophia has driven 160 kilometers since she filled her tank last time and needed to fill three liters of gasoline to refill it again. According to the manual of her car, she had four liters of gasoline in the tank when she started driving. So, we can calculate how many kilometers Sophia could drive with one liter of gasoline as follows: Distance = Total distance / Amount of fuel (in liters) In this case, the total distance is 160 km, and the amount of fuel is 3 liters. Therefore, we can calculate the number of kilometers Sophia could drive with one liter of gasoline as follows: Number of kilometers = 160 km / 3 l = 53.33 kilometers So, according to these calculations, Sophia could drive approximately 53.33 kilometers with one liter of gasoline.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jim watched TV for two hours and then went to bed early. So in one day, he spent half of his time watching TV (2/4 = 1 hour). Now, let's assume that he did this three times a week, which means he spent 3 x 1 hour = 3 hours per week watching TV. Therefore, over four weeks, he spent 3 x 4 = 12 hours watching TV.  As for reading, we are told that he read for half an hour each night, so in one day, he spent 0.5 x 24 = 12 hours reading. Since he did this thrice a week, he spent 3 x 12 = 36 hours reading per week. Over four weeks, he spent 3 x 4 = 12 hours reading.
Response: 1) Four schools are participating in the basketball tournament. 2) One school has sent a girls team and a boys team, so there are five players from that school. 3) The remaining three schools have also sent one team each, so there are five players from each of those schools. Therefore, the total number of players who participated is: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 players.
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds in the treasure chest and 35 rubies less than diameter. This means that each ruby is worth half as much as a diamond. Therefore, the value of one ruby is $ 0.5 \times 100 = 50$. So the total value of all stones in the chest is: $ 175 \times 50 = 8750$.  Therefore, many of the stones were in the chest.
Response:  If there are 60 girls and 5 students per teacher, then the total number of teachers needed to educate all the students is:  Number of girls x Number of students per teacher = 60 x 5 = 300 teachers. Therefore, there would be 300 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.
Response:  Bailey starts with some money and has an expense budget of $5 per week for 8 weeks. At the end of the period, he has $100 in total. So, if we calculate how much money Bailey had at each stage, we can find out that he had $20 at the beginning ($100 - $5 x 8 = $20).
"Response: 
Judy teaches in 5 dance classes per day and 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students, and she charges $15 per student, how much money will she make in total?

Step 1: Calculate the number of students Judy teaches per week.
Number of classes per day = 5
Number of days per week = 7 (Monday to Sunday)
Total number of classes per week = 5 x 7 = 35 classes

Step 2: Calculate the number of students Judy teaches per week.
Number of classes per week = Total number of classes per week / Number of students per class
= 35 classes / 15 students per class
= 2.33 classes per week

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of classes per week by 7 to get the total number of students Judy teaches per week:
Total number of students Judy teaches per week = Number of classes per week x Number of days per week
= 2.33 classes/week x 7 days/week
= 16.21 students/week

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Judy makes per week.
Amount of money Judy makes per week = Total number of students Judy teaches per week x Charging rate per student
= 16.21 students/week x $15/student
= $243.05 per week

Therefore, Judy makes $243.05 per week teaching dance classes."
Response:  If Kelian has two recipes with 20 instructions each, then in total he will have 40 instructions to follow (2 x 20 = 40). So, yes, Kelian will need to read all 40 instructions to make both dishes.
Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each cheesecake for $4, then he will make $3 x 43 = $132 from selling brownies and $4 x 23 = $92 from selling cheesecakes. In total, Tommy will make $132 + $92 = $224.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sheila bought five mobile phones for $150 each and paid three months of installments. So, she paid a total amount of $375 (5 x $150). Now, there is an interest rate of 2%, which means that Sheila will pay $7.50 in interest per month ($375 x 2%). Therefore, her total payment for the next three months will be $462.50 ($375 + $7.50 x 3).
Response:  If we assume that each pot of flowers costs $1, then:  Gulgulver (3 x $1 = $3) Petuniar ($1 x 9 = $9) Begoniaer ($1 x 17 = $17) Total cost = $3 + $9 + $17 = $39 So if Artie sells 12 pots of gulgulver at $1 each, he will make $12 in revenue. If he sells 9 pots of petuniar at $1 each, he will make $9 in revenue. And if he sells 17 pots of begoniaer at $1 each, he will make $17 in revenue. Therefore, the total amount of money Artie can get is $12 + $9 + $17 = $48.
"Response:  We know that Luke is building a sand castle with $n$ levels, and each level has an area of $\frac{1}{2} \times 10^n$. Therefore, the total area of all levels is:
$$A = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{2} \times 10^k = \frac{1}{2} \times 10^{n+1}$$
We are also given that the top level has an area of $16$, so we can find the average area of each level as follows:
$$\text{average area per level} = \frac{A}{n + 1} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \times 10^{n+1}}{n + 1} = \frac{10}{n + 1}$$
Therefore, the answer to the question is:
$$\boxed{\text{The average area of each level is } \frac{10}{n + 1}}$$"
"Response:  The veterinarian said that Cecilia must give the puppy two cups of dog food per day for the first 180 days. If one cup of dog food contains 110 spoons, how many cups will Cecilia use during the first year?  Solution: To find out how many cups of dog food Cecilia will use during the first year, we need to multiply the number of days by the amount of dog food she needs to give each day. So, if it takes 2 cups of dog food per day for the first 180 days, and there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years), then Cecilia will use:

2 cups/day x 180 days = 360 cups

So, Cecilia will use 360 cups of dog food during her puppy's first year."
Response:  We know that Sarah and Sarah are washing half as much as each other, so they are washing 2 times less than David.  Since David is washing 400 pounds of laundry, Sarah and Sarah together are washing 800 pounds (2 x 400). Now, let's compare this to Raymond who is washing 600 pounds of laundry. So, the difference between Raymond and David is 200 pounds (600 - 400).
"Response:  If he buys 3 flowers in a package of $2.50 or 2 flowers in a package of $1, then he will save money if he buys 18 flowers at the price of $1 per flower. So, the saving is:
Saving = (Price of 18 flowers x Number of flowers bought) - (Total cost of 3 flowers or 2 flowers)
= ($1 x 18) - ($2.50 or $1)
= $17 - $2.50 or $17 - $1
= $15 or $14
Therefore, he will save $15 or $14 by buying 18 flowers instead of 3 or 2 flowers respectively."
Response:  Firstly, we know that John pays $100 to get his dog groomed. Then, as an incentive, the groomer offers him a discount of 30%. So, what is the new price after applying this discount? We can calculate it as follows: $100 x (1 - 0.30) = $70. Therefore, after the discount, it will cost John $70 to get his dog groomed.
Response:  We know that Jente has 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 4 liters (since 24 / 6 = 4). And one of them had 6 liters of water, so they have a total of 10 liters (4 + 6). Therefore, there are 10 - 4 = 6 liters of water left.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 10 stickers in total (he started with 10). Then he bought 21 more from a store in the mall and got 23 more as a birthday gift. So now he has a total of 44 stickers (10 + 21 + 23 = 44). Finally, he gave away 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 for a greeting card. So, the number of stickers Charlie has left is 44 - 9 = 35. Therefore, the answer is 35.
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 45 kg and Alex is 4 times heavier than Grace. So, if we multiply 45 kg by 4, we get 180 kg. Therefore, the total weight of both Grace and Alex is 180 kg.
"Response:  We know that Dan has planted three rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Therefore, we have:
3 rose bushes x 25 roses/rose bush = 75 roses in total. Now, let's count the number of thorns on each rose:
8 thorns/rose x 75 roses = 600 thorns in total. So, there are 600 thorns in total."
"Response:  We know that 8 teams played in total (22 games). Of those, 8 teams won at least one game (since they mention ""eight of them""). So, we can say that 8/22 = 0.364% of the teams won at least one game."
Response: 1) The number of t-shirts he has is equal to the number of years he has been going on vacation minus the age he was when he started going on vacation (23). So, if he has been going on vacation for 4 times, and he is now 34 years old, then the number of t-shirts he has = 4 x (34 - 23) = 4 x 11 = 44 t-shirts. Therefore, Gene has 44 t-shirts in total.
Response:  The first gong rings for three times, then it stops. Then, the second gong rings for twice as long as the first gong (i.e., 3 x 2 = 6 times). Finally, the third gong rings for half as long as the second gong (i.e., 6 / 2 = 3 times). So, in total, the alarm rang for 3 + 6 + 3 = 12 times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the company pays its employees $600 per month. Secondly, we are told that the policy is to increase the salary of each employee with 10% of their previous year's salary every quarter for those who have been in the company for five years or more. Finally, we are given that Vis Sylvie has worked for the company for five years as of December of the current year. Therefore, we can calculate her annual salary as follows:  Annual salary = Monthly salary x (1 + 10% of previous year's salary) x 4 quarters = $600 x (1 + 0.10) x 4 = $7200 So, Vis Sylvie's annual salary after three years of work is $7200.
Response:  If Marilyn sold her first album 10 times fewer copies than Harald, that means she sold 80% of Harald's number of albums (since 10 x 0.8 = 8). So if Harald sold 88,000 albums in total, then Marilyn sold 72,640 albums (since 88,000 / 0.8 = 72,640). Therefore, many more albums were sold by Harald than by Marilyn.
"Response:  We know that Christina invited 16 guests and wants to give each of them a gift bag worth $2. So, we need to calculate how many gift bags she will buy based on the number of guests she invited. Since 3/4 of the guests did not bring any presents, we subtract that amount from the total number of guests. Therefore, the number of gift bags Christina needs is:

(16 x $2) / (4/7) = $80 / ($4/7) = 11 gift bags
So, Christina will use 11 gift bags."
Response:  If there are 20 adults and 5 children attending the picnic, then the total number of people is 20 + 5 = 25.  Since each adult can eat half of the 20 kg (or 10 kg) of potato salad, an adult would eat 10/25 = 0.4 kg of potato salad. Similarly, each child would eat 0.2 kg of potato salad since they are only half as big as an adult. Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for all the guests to have some is:  0.4 kg x 25 people = 10 kg. So, Ted will need to bring at least 10 kg of potato salad to the picnic if he wants everyone to have enough to eat.
Response:  We know that Jan has three pets and Marcia has two pets. So far, we have five pets in total. Then, we are told that Cindy has four pets. Therefore, if we add all these numbers together, we get: 5 + 4 = 9. So, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that Amy is five years older than Jackso n and two years younger than Corey. So, we can write:  Age of Amy = 5 + 2 = 7 Years  Since Amy is seven years older than Jackson, we can say:  Age of Jackson = 7 - 1 = 6 Years  Now, we know that Corey is one year younger than Amy, so we can write:  Age of Corey = 7 - 1 = 6 Years  Finally, since James is ten years old, we can say:  Age of James = 10 Years  Therefore, the age of Jackson is six years old.
Response:  We know that Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds without any obstacles, and we also know that with his new diet, he improved his time by 2 seconds. So if Lee runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, then Gerald, with his improved diet, can run 400 meters in approximately __________ seconds.
"Response:  If there are fewer than 12 canines as pets, then there must be more cats and dogs combined than canines. So let's assume that there are x cats and y dogs, where x + y = 60 (the total number of pets). Since there are 12 canines less than the sum of cats and dogs, we have:
x + y - 12 = 60
Now solve for x and y:
x = 48
y = 12
So there are 48 cats and 12 dogs as pets in this quarter."
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in fifth grade, two-thirds are girls and one-fifth are guitar players. So, we can calculate the number of girls who are not in the scout troop as follows: Number of girls who are not in the scout troop = Total number of girls - Number of girls who are in the scout troop = 160 (total number of girls) - 30 (number of girls who are in the scout troop) = 130 Therefore, many girls are not in the scout troop.
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for three-quarters of the night (2/3). So, if we multiply this fraction by 100, we get...

$$ \therefore Harry slept for 75\% of the night $$

So, the answer is $75$."
"Response:  We know that when Freda cooks tomatoes in a can, she loses half of its volume. So if she uses 3 tomatoes, each with a volume of 16 units (since there are 16 units left after she uses them), then the total volume of tomatoes used is:

3 x 16 = 48 units

Now, we know that Freda uses 32 grams of salsa. Since salsa has a density of approximately 1.5 g/cm^3, we can calculate the volume of salsa used as follows:

Volume of salsa = Mass of salsa / Density of salsa
= 32 g / 1.5 g/cm^3
= 20 cm^3

So, to answer your question, Freda must have used many tomatoes!"
Response:  We know that in the first 15 minutes of traffic jam, 15 cars passed through. In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 cars passed through. So, in total, 35 cars passed through during the entire time period (15 + 20 = 35). Therefore, the number of cars that did not have to drive through the traffic jam is 30 - 35 = -5 cars.
Response:  Mary has 18 new plants from the best plant school and currently has two pot plants left of the original 40 in her large country home. She is so kind that she has decided to give one pot plant away to each of her neighbors and family members tomorrow morning. How many pot plants will Mary have after giving them away?  Based on the information provided, Mary will have zero pot plants left after giving them away.
Response:  The first visitor pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it, which means that he pressed it for 20/4 = 5 gongs.  Then, the second visitor pressed it for (1/4) \* (3 - 1) = 3 gongs more than the first one, so he pressed it for 5 + 3 = 8 gongs.  Similarly, the third visitor pressed it for (10 - 4) = 6 gongs more than the fourth visitor, who pressed it for 60 - 4 = 56 gongs. Therefore, if your friend pressed the doorbell 60 gongs, he must have pressed it for 60 - 56 = 4 gongs.
Response:  We know that Solo has to read 4 pages in his vocabulary book, 20 pages in his social studies book, 7 pages in his history book, and 8 pages in his geography book. He already read 15 pages on Monday. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he has left to read them. In this case, he has 3 days left, so he needs to read: Total pages / Number of days = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages per day. Therefore, Solo needs to read approximately 49 pages per day.
Response:  On weekdays, John drinks water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This means he consumes 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast + lunch + dinner).  On Sundays, John has one additional glass of water before going to bed. So, in total, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (3 glasses + 1 extra glass).
Response:  Firstly, we know that it takes ten minutes to cover one kilometer (or mile). So, if the city is 42 miles long from the sea to the land, it will take 420 minutes (or 7 hours) to cover the entire city at a speed of 10 minutes per kilometer.
Response:  We have 1000 pieces of puzzle and we take out one piece (the fourth). So now we have 999 pieces left. Then our mother takes one-third of them (333 pieces) and leaves us with 666 pieces. Therefore, there are 666 remaining pieces of puzzle after our mother took her share.
Response:  If Cody has 3 gongs and Amir has 5 small cookies, then together they have 8 gongs and 5 small cookies.  To calculate how many small cookies each person can eat, we need to divide the number of small cookies by the number of people eating them. In this case, each person can eat 5/2 = 2.5 small cookies. Since you cannot eat a fraction of a cookie, each person can eat 2 whole small cookies. Therefore, if Dei can eat many small cookies, Dei can eat 2 x 3 = 6 small cookies.
Response: 1. The first book has a volume of 3 x 8 = 24 cubic centimeters (cm³). 2. The second book has a volume of 5 x 6 = 30 cm³. 3. The third book has a volume of 4 x 7 = 28 cm³. Therefore, the total volume of all three books is 24 + 30 + 28 = 82 cm³.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, he watched an hour of his favorite show. On Wednesday, he saw some episodes earlier and then watched a one-hour episode and a 30-minute show. He had to get up early. And on Thursday, he watched two hours in total. If he watched TV for seven hours altogether, how many of those hours were 30-minute episodes?  Solution:  We know that he watched an hour of his favorite show on Monday and Tuesday, so let's assume that these are not 30-minute episodes. Therefore, he watched a total of 2 hours of non-30 minute episodes (1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours). Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Since he said he saw some episodes earlier, let's assume that he watched at least one 30-minute episode before watching more later in the day. So, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is at least 1. Finally, since he watched two hours of TV on Thursday, none of those hours could have been 30-minute episodes (since there are only 7 hours in total). Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  If Henry made double the number of cookies he made last year, then this year he made 2 \* 10 = 20 cookies. Since he let 5 fall while arranging them outside to cool, he has 20 - 5 = 15 cookies left. So, last year he made 10 cookies.
Response:  If the local gas station sells gasoline for $3 per gallon and an app offers half a liter of oil for $1, then...
Response:  We know that Beatrice was two rolls wide and 24 rolls long, so she had 24 x 2 = 48 fruit packs.  Marcell was three rolls wide and 14 rolls long, so he had 14 x 3 = 42 fruit packs.  If they both ate all of their respective fruit packs, then Beatrice ate 48 / 2 = 24 fruit packs in average, and Marcell ate 42 / 3 = 14 fruit packs in average.
Response:  We know that the boat took in 2 liters of water while Julie was out at sea. When she rowed back to shore, it took her 16 seconds to cover 20 feet. It took her 64 seconds to reach the shore. So, if we divide the amount of water taken in (2 liters) by the time it took her to row back (64 seconds), we get the answer: 33.33 liters.
Response:  The four teachers share one table between them and each teacher has two periods per day. If the whiteboard is cleaned three times per period, how many times will it be cleaned per day? Therefore, the correct answer is 9 (3 x 2).
Response:  If Ryan plants 10 seeds in his garden every day for 15 days, and many flowers have bloomed after that time, then we can assume that he has indeed managed to grow 5 flowers. So, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Jamal has six photos and each photo can hold 50 birds, so he has 6 x 50 = 300 birds in total. Now we are told that Brittany can take 50 pictures with 50 birds in each picture, so she can take 50 x 50 = 2500 birds in total. Therefore, if Jamal's phone can hold 1800 bird images, then it is equivalent to taking 1800 / 2500 = 72% of Brittany's total number of bird images.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has gained 50% in the last months after buying some wood. This means that if he had $100 worth of wood before, now he has $150 worth of wood. Secondly, we are told that Sasha decides to sell all his wood and boats. If he has 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost him $10 each, then he has a total of $200 worth of wood. Finally, we are given that Sasha has five small boats with one room each. Since there is no information about their value, let's assume they are also worth $100 each, making the total value of Sasha's assets $300. Therefore, if Sasha sells everything, he will make a profit of $150 ($300 - $150).
Response:  We know that Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar and water to make her coffee at 7:13 AM. To calculate how many grams of sugar she used, we can convert the volume of sugar from teaspoons to grams using the following conversion factor: 1 teaspoon = 5 grams. Therefore, the number of grams of sugar Katy used is: 120 teaspoons x 5 grams/teaspoon = 600 grams.
"Response:  If John buys two pairs of shoes for quarter of his three born children, and each pair costs $60, then he will pay:

$60 x 3/4 = $90

So, John will pay $90 for the shoes."
Response:  On day one, there were five cars inside two containers. So, the total number of cars imported that day was 5 + 5 = 10 cars.  Now, let's assume that all five containers had the same number of cars as the first two containers (i.e., 5 cars each). Therefore, the total number of cars imported on the second day is:  Total cars imported on Day 2 = Number of containers x Number of cars per container = 5 x 5 = 25 cars.
Response:  Four years ago, Adrien earned $60,000 (30% more than Lylah). Then, four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, which means he earned $84,000 ($60,000 x 1.4) four years ago. So, Adrien earned $40,000 more than Lylah four years ago. Now, we are told that Adrien earns $120,000 now, which is 40% more than his previous salary. Therefore, Lylah's current salary is $96,000 ($84,000 x 1.4).
Response:  If he uses 30 sheets of paper per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he will use 120 sheets of paper per month (30 x 4 = 120). So, if it is a 5-month period, he will use 600 sheets of paper (120 x 5 = 600).
Response:  Morisette took with him five apples and eight pears, so together they have 5 + 8 = 13 fruit.  Kael took with him double the number of apples as Morisette, which is 2 × 5 = 10 apples, and half the number of pears as Morisette, which is 4/2 = 2 pears. So, in total, Morisette and Kael have 13 + 10 + 2 = 25 fruit.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. The next two days she slept for 2 hours less because she had to do some homework at school. If she slept 1 hour more each of the remaining days of the week, how many hours did she sleep in total that day?
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 miles in an hour for 3 hours, she has covered a total distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Then, if she runs at a speed of 8 km/h after that, she will cover a distance of 8 km/h x 30 miles = 240 kilometers. Therefore, Rosie can run approximately 240 kilometers in 7 hours.
Response:  If Jennie has helped her mother with sorting 60 letters and she has already sorted half of them (which is 30 letters), then we can assume that Jennie has sorted 30/2 = 15 letters in total. So, the answer is 15.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia bought a new package of five skjears after she realized she didn't have any. Then, while preparing dinner, she used three of those skjears to taste the food. Therefore, there were eight skjears left in the package. Finally, when she finished setting the table and put everything out, she had a total of twelve skjears. So, the answer is eight.
"Response:  We know that Dylan bought more chicken rolls than fish rolls. So, we can say that he bought $x$ chicken rolls and $y$ fish rolls, where $x > y$.  Now, we need to find out how many chicken rolls Dylan bought in total. Since he bought $\frac{x}{2}$ chicken rolls for each of the two types of rolls (chicken and fish), we have:
$$\text {Number of chicken rolls} = \frac{x}{2}$$
And since there are $38$ chicken rolls in total, we can write:
$$\boxed{\text {Number of chicken rolls}} = 38$$
Similarly, we can find the number of fish rolls as follows:
$$\boxed{\text {Number of fish rolls}} = \frac{y}{2}$$
Now, let's substitute the values we have found into the original equation:
$$\text {Total number of pork balls} = x + y$$
Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:
$$\boxed{\text {Total number of pork balls}} = 38 + \frac{y}{2}$$
Therefore, the answer is:
$$\boxed{\text {Dylan bought }}\approx 45\text{ pork balls}.$$"
Response:  If Amy has 20 venues and Lily has 50 venues, then we can say that Lily has twice as many venues as Amy. So, if Amy has x venues, then Lily has 2x venues. Therefore, the number of venues that Lily has is 2 times the number of venues that Amy has, which is 2x = 40 venues.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one watermelon costs $3, and one pepper costs $1.5. Therefore, 4 watermelons cost $3 x 4 = $12, and 20 peppers cost $1.5 x 20 = $30. Next, we know that one apple costs $5 less than a melon. So, 10 apples cost $3 - $5 = $2 per apple. Finally, we are told that Dillon was sent to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 apples. Therefore, the total amount of money he spent is $12 + $30 + ($2 x 10) = $62.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the hospital sees 500 patients per day. In average, each patient stays for 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent by patients in the hospital is:

$$ Time = \frac{Number of patients}{Average stay time} $$

Time = 500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from patients:

$$ Revenue = Number of patients x Average charge per patient $$

Revenue = 500 patients/day x $150/hour = $75,000/day

Next, we need to find out how much the hospital spends on labor costs:

$$ Labor Cost = Total hours worked by doctors and nurses / Number of patients seen per day $$

Labor Cost = (Total number of doctors + Total number of nurses) x Hours worked per day / Number of patients seen per day

Let's assume there are 10 doctors working an average of 8 hours per day, and 20 nurses working an average of 6 hours per day. The total number of doctors and nurses is:

Doctors: 10 x 8 hours/day = 80 hours/day
Nurses: 20 x 6 hours/day = 120 hours/day

Therefore, the total labor cost is:

Labor Cost = 80 hours/day x $100/hour = $8,000/day

Finally, we can calculate the profit margin of the hospital:

Profit Margin = Revenue - Labor Cost - Other expenses

Other expenses may include rent, utilities, equipment maintenance, etc. Let's assume other expenses account for 30% of the total revenue.

Profit Margin = ($75,000/day - $8,000/day - $22,500/day) / $75,000/day = 35%

So, based on these calculations, the hospital makes approximately $35,00"
Response:  We know that 60 seasonal workers are employed to play elves in Santa City at the shopping center there. One third of them dropped when they were tired, and ten of them jumped when they were excited. How many elves are there?  Solution: To find out how many elves there are, we need to calculate the total number of workers who did not drop or jump. The remaining workers are equal to the total number of workers minus the number of workers who dropped and jumped. So, let's do the calculation: Total number of workers - Number of workers who dropped = 60 - (1/3) x 60 = 40 Workers who did not drop Now, let's count the number of workers who jumped: Number of workers who jumped = 10 Of these workers, some may have been both tired and excited, so we need to subtract those workers from the total number of workers who jumped. Let's assume that 2 workers were both tired and excited, so their counts should be deducted: Number of workers who jumped - Number of workers who were both tired and excited = 10 - 2 = 8 Elves Therefore, there are 8 elves working in Santa City at the shopping center.
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500.  In June, he spent $60 less than in May, so he spent $440 in June.  Therefore, his total expenses for both months are: $500 + $440 = $940.
Response:  Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster twice while Fred rode it four times. After that, they decided to ride two times on skis. If each ticket cost $6, how much did they spend in total?  Solution:  To find out how much they spent in total, we need to calculate the number of tickets they bought for each activity and multiply it by the cost per ticket.  For riding the roller coaster, Pam rode it twice, so she bought 2 tickets x $6 = $12.  For riding the roller coaster, Fred rode it four times, so he bought 4 tickets x $6 = $24.  For riding on skis, they rode together twice, so they bought 2 tickets x $6 = $12.  Therefore, the total amount they spent is $12 + $24 + $12 = $58.
Response:  On Monday, Walt walked 9 kilometers and took 6 turns around the block. So he walked a total of 9 x 6 = 54 kilometers on Monday. Then on Tuesday, he walked 6 miles more than he did on Monday, which is 6 + 54 = 60 miles. Therefore, on Wednesday, he walked 41 - 60 = -29 miles. Since he didn't walk any miles on Thursday or Friday, his total distance walked from Monday to Friday was -29 miles.
Response:  If Tom gets 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then he pays:  Number of car washes = 4/month x $15/car wash = $60/month So, Tom pays $60 per month for his 4 car washes.
"Response:  If Bobby has played five times as many games in his life as Hans has, and if Brian played 20 games but lost 5 before making the comparison with Bobby, then we can calculate how many games Bobby has played based on the information given.

So, Hans has played x games, and Brian played 20 games, losing 5 before comparing with Bobby. We know that Bobby plays five times as many games as Hans, so Bobby has played 5x games.

We are also told that Bobbys total number of games is equal to Hans's total number of games plus Brian's total number of games minus the number of games Brian lost before comparing with Bobby. Therefore, we can write an equation:

Bobby's total number of games = Hans's total number of games + Brian's total number of games - Number of games Brian lost before comparing with Bobby

Substituting the values we have been given, we get:

Bobby's total number of games = 5x + 20 - 5

Simplifying and solving for x (the number of games Hans has played), we find that:

x = 40

Therefore, Bobby has played 5 \* 40 = 200 games in his life."
Response:  We know that there are 27 remaining horses in the world. One-third of them are located in Scottish highlands. Two-thirds of the Scottish horses are female. How many female Scottish horses are there?  Therefore, we can conclude that there are approximately 16 female Scottish horses (2/3 x 27 = 16).
Response:  Firstly, we have $7.50 for the bill and then there is an extra charge of $20% which means $1.50 (since it's a decimal). Then comes the tip of $5, so the total amount paid would be $9.00 ($7.50 + $1.50 + $5). Therefore, delivery will cost $9.
Response:  If Mark took 5 questions per minute in the first test, he completed it in 75 minutes (since there were 75 questions). So, if he has 8 hours for the second test, he can complete it in 8 x 5 = 40 minutes. Therefore, he will have time left over to answer 60 questions (40 minutes / 5 questions/minute = 60 questions).
Response:  We know that there are 22 red gumballs and 4 gongs. If there are 12 blue gumballs, how many red gumballs can we expect to find if there are as many red gumballs as there are blue ones? So, in this case, there will be 22/12 = 1.83 (approximately) red gumballs for every blue one.
Response:  There are 20 cars in total, and we know that 12 of them are automatic, 4 are manual, and the remaining ones are semi-automatic. So, if many percent of car owners prefer semi-automatic vehicles, it means that among all these 20 cars, there will be approximately (12/20) x (4/5) = 8 semi-automatic cars. Therefore, about 80% of the cars are not semi-automatic.
Response:  There are 700 bees in a bike box. Since there are twice as many workers as births and twice as many births as queens, we can write this equation: Workers = Births x 2 Queens = Births x 2 + Births = Total number of bees Now let's solve for the number of workers: Workers = Total number of bees / (Births x 2) = 700 / (2 x 10) = 350 So there are 350 workers in the bike box.
Response:  If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day and earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, then he earns a total of $20 per day from both activities combined (2 hours gaming + 4 hours work). So, if Jordan were to spend all of that money on video games instead of working, he would have $20 x 30 = $600 left over each month (assuming a monthly income of $20 x 30 = $600 from both activities).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, butter for $3, cheese for $3, and roach-falsar for $4. So, the total cost of all these items is:

$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Now, there is a 10% tax on all food items, so the total cost after taxes will be:

$15 x 1.10 = $16.50

Therefore, the total cost of all groceries including taxes is $16.50."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three clients and each client needs two bottles of bleach solution and one package of cleaning supplies. So, in total, he needs 3 x 2 = 6 bottles of bleach solution and 1 package of cleaning supplies from his five clients.  Next, we know that each bottle of bleach solution costs $2, so the total cost of bleach solutions is 6 x $2 = $12. Similarly, each package of cleaning supplies costs $5, so the total cost of cleaning supplies is 1 x $5 = $5. Therefore, the total cost of all the items needed from his five clients is $12 + $5 = $17.  Now, let's calculate how much money he will make if he gets all the items from his five clients. We know that each client will give him $92 - $17 = $75. Since he has five clients, the total amount of money he will make is 5 x $75 = $375.  Finally, we need to subtract the total cost of all the items from the total amount of money he will make to find out how much profit he will make. The difference between $375 and $17 is $358. So, the profit he will make is $358.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 hectares of land with ananasslope owned by John. Secondly, we know that there are 100 ananas plants per hectare. Thirdly, we know that John can harvest his ananas for three months in a year. Now let's calculate how many ananas John can harvest in a year: Number of ananas plants = 10 hectares x 100 ananas plants/hectare = 1000 ananas plants Total number of days to harvest = 3 months / 30 days/month = 10 days Therefore, John can harvest 100 ananas plants per day. So, in one year, John can harvest 1000 x 10 = 10,000 ananas!
Response:  We know that there are three types of Legos: 500-mynt, 3 times 500 = 1500 mynt, and 1/4 of 1500 = 375 mynt. So in total, Johnny can take up 1975 mynt (500 + 1500 + 375).
Response:  If 30 bees went out of the hive in the first six hours and half of them returned in the next six hours, then there were 15 bees that did not return (30 - 15 = 15).  Then, if twice as many bees flew away from the nest than before, then there would be 2 times 15 = 30 bees that flew away. However, since only half of them returned, then the number of bees that did not return is equal to the number of bees that did not return minus the number of bees that returned, which is 30 - 15 = 15. Therefore, Debra saw 15 bees come back to their hives within the last six hours.
Response:  We know that Brittany and her mom go to the museum together. The admission fee costs $12 for adults and $10 for children. Since Brittany's mom gave her money to buy tickets, we can assume that she paid $10 for Brittany's ticket and $2 for hers (since adult tickets cost more than child tickets). So, Brittany got $8 in change (after paying for her own ticket). Therefore, the number of dollars that Brittany's mom gave to the cashier is $8.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, Charlie has 3x friends.  Then we are told that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, James has 4x friends.  Now we want to find out how many friends James has if Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.  We can set up an equation using this information: 3x = 12 (Charlie has 12 friends) 4x = 12 (James has four times as many friends as Dorothy)  Solving for x, we get:  x = 6 (Dorothy has 6 friends on Facebook) Therefore, James has 24 friends on Facebook (4 times 6).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve is further away from school than Tim, so he gets to ride his bike. The distance between Steve and school is 3 miles (which means he can cycle at 440 feet per minute). Now, let's find out how long it will take for Tim to reach the house after leaving school. We are given that Tim travels at a speed of 264 feet per minute, so he covers half the distance in one minute (i.e., 1 mile = 5,280 feet). Therefore, Tim takes 2 minutes to cover 2 miles (or 10,560 feet), since he has traveled twice as far as Steve did in the same time frame. Finally, we need to determine when the winner will arrive at their destination. Since both Steve and Tim start simultaneously, they will meet each other at the midpoint of their journey, which is located 1.5 miles (or 7,920 feet) away from the school. So, if Tim reaches the midpoint first, he will win; otherwise, Steve will be the winner. To calculate exactly when they will meet each other, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time + Midpoint Distance = 440 ft/min x 2 min = 880 ft + 7,920 ft = 8,780 ft As you can see, Tim will reach the midpoint at approximately 8:78 AM, which is before Steve does (Steve reaches the midpoint at around 9:12 AM). Thus, Tim wins this race!"
Response:  On day one, five cyclists came to get their tires inflated, and each tire cost $0.25 to fill up. Since there were 10 bicycles in total (including the tricycle), we can assume that each bicycle had two tires. Therefore, the total number of tires filled up on the first day is 20 (10 x 2). Now, let's calculate how much money was spent on filling up tires on the first day: Total amount spent = Number of tires filled up x Cost per tire = 20 x $0.25 = $5 So, on the first day, $5 was spent on filling up tires.
"Response:  We know that Carl bought ten packages of chocolates and each package contains six pieces of chocolate. If we assume that each piece of chocolate costs $0.10, then the total cost of all ten packages would be:

$6 x 10 = $60

Now, let's say Carl paid with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he got, we can divide the amount he paid ($10) by the total cost of the chocolates ($60):

$10 / $60 = 0.17 (or $0.17 per package)

So, if Carl paid with one $10 bill, he would get $0.17 in change for each package of chocolates he bought."
Response: 14 + 14 = 28 (the number of French fries Dave initially ate). Then, half of 28 is 14 (the number of French fries the hungry seagull ate). Next, three birds scared away two French fries each, leaving five remaining (5). Finally, one washboard took away two thirds of the remaining five French fries (3), leaving only one French fry left for the gull (1). Therefore, Dave originally had 28 French fries in his package.
Response:  Monday, Tuesday and Friday have one hour classes each day, so that's three hours total. Wednesday and Thursday have two hours each, so that's four hours total. In total, Kimo has 7 hours of class per week (3 + 4). Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo has 112 hours of class per semester (7 x 16). Therefore, the correct answer is 112 hours.
Response:  We know that Bill has 300 rolls (rullar), 120 chocolate croissants (sjokolade-croissants), and 60 bread sticks (bagetter). The length of each roll is 2.5 cm, the length of each croissant is also 2.5 cm, and the length of each bread stick is 1.5 meters. If Bill sets all the pastries end to end, how long will they be in total?  To find out, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite number of terms: L = a + b + c +..., where a, b, c, etc. are the lengths of each pastry. In this case, we have: L = 2.5 cm x 300 = 75 meters for the rolls L = 2.5 cm x 120 = 30 meters for the croissants L = 1.5 m x 60 = 90 meters for the bread sticks Since these three quantities add up to 195 meters, the total length of all the pastries set end to end would be: L = 195 meters.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three types of monkeys in the zoo: gorillas, baboons and orangutans. Each type of monkey has its own requirement of bananas per month as follows:
Gorillas require 400 bananas per month Baboons require 100 bananas per month Orangutans require 200 bananas per month Therefore, if the zookeeper wants to ensure that all the monkeys have enough bananas to eat for two months, he needs to order the following number of bananas: Gorillas - 800 bananas (2 x 400) Baboons - 200 bananas Orangutans - 400 bananas Total number of bananas needed = 1,400 bananas To fulfill this demand, the zookeeper must place an order every quarter year, which means he will need to order 360 bananas per month (1,400 / 4)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 100 meters x 15 = 1500 meters.  Secondly, we know that Kelly rolls along the wall for 34 times, which means she covers a distance of 100 meters x 34 = 3400 meters. Therefore, the winner is Kelly who covers a longer distance than Blake. The difference in their distances is 3400 - 1500 = 1900 meters.
Response:  Raphael bought 4 pens that cost $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on those. He also bought 2 notebooks that cost $4 each, so he spent $8 on those. Finally, he bought a roll of paper that cost $20. Therefore, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 on all his school supplies.
Response:  We know that Finn sees 11 tadpoles in the pond. Of those, 6 are close together and 2 are hiding under a stone. So, how many tadpoles does Finn see in total?  There are 6 + 2 = 8 tadpoles that Finn can see. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  On Monday, the water level in the tank was 5 meters deep. On Tuesday, there were 7 feet (or 2.13 meters) more water in the tank than on Monday. So, on Tuesday, the water level was 5 + 2.13 = 7.13 meters deep.  On Wednesday, the water level is two-thirds as deep as it was on Tuesday, so the water level on Wednesday is 7.13 / 2 = 3.56 meters deep.
Response:  We know that Anakin got 10 sea stars, 6 seahorses and 3 clownfish. So, in total he caught 19 fish. Locsin caught fewer than Anakin, but we don't know exactly how many fewer. Let's assume it was 4 fish less. Therefore, Locsin caught 15 fish. Now, let's calculate the difference between their catches:  Difference = Anakin's catch - Locsin's catch = 19 - 15 = 4 fish. So, many fish could they have caught together? Answer: 4 fish.
Response:  The price of the statue increases by $20 every month, so after 36 months, the new price will be:  Price = Original price x (1 + Monthly increase) ^ Number of months = $20 x (1 + 0.20) ^ 36 = $480. Therefore, after 36 months, the price of the statue would be $480.
"Response:  We know that one toy costs $3 and another toy costs $4. So, if we have five toys in total, then their cost would be:
Cost of first toy = $3
Cost of second toy = $4
Cost of third toy = $4 (since it is the same as the second toy)
Cost of fourth toy = $4 (again, the same as the second toy)
Cost of fifth toy = $4 (the same as the other four toys)
Total cost of five toys = $3 + $4 + $4 + $4 + $4 = $20
So, one action figure costs $5."
Response:  If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will save $3 per hour of freelance work time (3 hours x $3 = $9). However, if she hires an accountant, she will pay $90. So, in total, Jackie will have to spend $90 - $9 = $81. Therefore, Jackie will make more money ($81) than she spends ($35) if she hires an accountant.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has been given a budget of €1500 by her family to buy a new computer and accessories as a gift. Then, she goes to a database store and buys a computer with a screen, keyboard, mouse, scanner, CD burner, and printer at a total cost of €1090. So far, Elvira has spent €1090 + €157 = €1247. Now, let's calculate how much money is left in her budget after purchasing these items: €1500 - €1247 = €253. Therefore, Elvira still has €253 left in her budget to spend on other things or additional accessories.
Response:  If Sandra has to make 15 Spanish tortillas for an important school event and each tortilla requires 3 eggs, then she needs to use 45 eggs in total (15 x 3 = 45). Since she only has 9 eggs left after making one tortilla with her daughter, she will have to buy more eggs or find another way to obtain them. Therefore, the correct answer is 45 times.
Response:  According to the question, Seth is currently double as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is 20 years old, then Seth is 40 years old (double of 20). In two years, Seth will be 42 years old (2 x 20 = 40 + 2). Therefore, Seth is 42 years old.
Response:  If Ethel has $8 and Jimmy has twice as much money as Ethel, then Jimmy has $16.
Response:  If Pancho goes 20 miles per day and they are 10 kilometers away from their destination, then he has gone 20 x 10 = 200 kilometers. So, many miles does he go on one way? The answer is 200 / 5 (since there are 5 kilometers in one mile) = 40 miles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of the hat is $25 and the cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, which means the cost of the jacket is $25 x 3 = $75. Similarly, the cost of the pants is equal to the average cost of the hat and jacket, which is $25 + $75 = $100. Therefore, the total cost of one uniform is $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $100 (pants) = $290. So, each uniform costs $290.
Response:  We know that Jake sees 80 spiders with eight legs remaining, and we also know he sees 90 insects with six legs remaining. So far, so good! However, when it comes to the rare mutant invertebrates, we are told there are three of them, each with ten legs remaining. Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is: 80 + 90 + 3 x 10 = 250 legs.  So, the answer is 250.
Response:  We know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, if Granny Red is x years old, then Sally Two is x + 3 years old.  Similarly, we know that Momma Red is twice as old as Sally Four. So, if Sally Four is y years old, then Momma Red is 2y years old.  Now, we are told that Sally Three is eight years younger than Sally Four. So, if Sally Four is y years old, then Sally Three is y - 8 years old.  Putting all these pieces of information together, we can write an equation:  x + (x + 3) = 2(y - 8)  Simplifying this equation, we get:  x + 3 = 2y - 16  Solving for x, we get:  x = 10  Therefore, Granny Red is 10 years old, Sally Two is 10 + 3 = 13 years old, Momma Red is 2(10) = 20 years old, and Sally Three is 10 - 8 = 2 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica has borrowed from each source:  From student loans, she has borrowed $300 x 9 = $2700.  From credit cards, she has borrowed $200 x 12 = $2400. So, in total, Jessica has borrowed $2700 + $2400 = $5100. Now, let's find out how much Jessica needs to pay every month to repay these debts:  For student loans, her monthly payment will be $2700 / 12 = $225.  For credit card debt, her monthly payment will be $2400 / 12 = $200. Therefore, Jessica needs to pay $225 + $200 = $425 every month to repay all of her debts. If she wants to pay more than the minimum amount, she can pay any additional amount above $425 as desired.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Billy has to shred and chop 60 potatoes for his big family barbecue. The time taken to shred one potato is approximately equal to half a minute (since it takes around 5 seconds to chop one). Therefore, if Billy works continuously without any breaks, he will take roughly 30 minutes to shred all 60 potatoes (i.e., 60 x 0.5 = 30 minutes). So, in total, it will take Billy around 30 minutes to prepare all the potatoes for his barbecue.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For every gallon they sell, it costs them $3 per liter. They sell 4 gallons of lemonade in total, so they spent $3 x 4 = $12 on lemonade. Secondly, we know that they sold 20 glasses of lemonade at $50 each, which means they earned $50 x 20 = $1000 from selling those glasses. Finally, we are told that if they made a profit of $25, then their total revenue must be equal to their total cost plus their profit. So, we can set up an equation as follows: $1000 + $12 = $25. Solving for $12, we get $12 = $23. Therefore, Juan and his brother Carlos spent $23 on lemons.
Response:  We know that there were 80 Japanese runners in total, and 60 of them were girls. So, if we divide the number of boys (80) by the number of girls (60), we get: Number of girls = 80 / 60 = 13. Therefore, there were 13 girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends one-third of his income on fuel ( $3 \times 1/3 = $100). Secondly, he gives half of the remaining amount to a charitable organization ($5000 - $2500 = $2500). Thirdly, he pays $200 towards his daughter's expenses and $700 towards his wife's expenses. Finally, he has $6000 left after all these expenses and donations. So, the total amount of money he has left is: $6000 - $100 - $200 - $700 = $4930. Therefore, Zaid has $4930 left after all his expenses and donations.
"Response:  We know that Rani has ten problems more than Monica, who has four less problems than Bo. So, if we add up all the problems of these three people, we will get:
Rani - 10 = Monica + 4 = Bo + 40 = Total number of problems
Therefore, the total number of problems is 54 (40 + 10 + 4)."
Response:  If Lloyd taught for 10 hours in total (as given in the question), then he taught for 5 hours on the first day and 8 hours on the second day. So, the total number of hours he taught is:  5 + 8 = 13 hours.
"Response:  We know that there were 80 students in total who voted in the class election and the winner received 3/4 of the remaining votes after the first round of counting. So, let's calculate the number of votes the winner got in the first round:

Remaining votes = Total votes - Winner's vote in first round = 80 - (3/4) x 80 = 60

Now, we need to find out how many votes the loser got in the first round. Since the winner got 3/4 of the remaining votes, the loser got the remaining votes:

Loser's vote in first round = Remaining votes = 60

So, the loser got 60 votes in the first round. Now, we can find out what percentage of the total votes the loser got:

Percentage of loser = Number of votes lost / Total votes = 60 / 80 = 75%

Therefore, the answer is 75%."
Response:  Sandra has ordered four times as many red roses as white lilies (4 x 5 = 20). In addition, she has also ordered 200 pink calla lilies (5 x 40 = 200). To keep Sandra happy, Fred must deliver 20 red roses before 5 PM (17 x 2 = 34). So, Fred needs to deliver 54 roses in total (20 + 34) before 5 PM.
Response:  We know that: * Jean is older than Mark (by 2 years) * Mark was 5 years younger than Jan 2 years ago * Jan is now 30 years old So we can conclude that: Jean - Mark = 2 years Jean - Mark = 2 + 5 = 7 years ago Jean - Mark = 7 + 2 = 9 years ago Therefore, Jean is 9 years older than Mark.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one of the teams is very good at running 400 meters, with each member completing it in exactly 55 seconds. The second team is less well-rounded, with their first runner taking 60 seconds to complete the distance, and the remaining runners being 3 seconds faster than the first runner. Now, let's calculate how many seconds it would take for the fastest team to win. We can do this by adding up the times taken by all four members of the winning team: 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 260 seconds (or 4 minutes). Therefore, if the race were held under these conditions, the fastest team would win by 4 minutes.
"Response:  If Jerry throws an unfair six-sided die, then the probability of getting any particular number is not equal to 1/6. Instead, it is some fraction between 0 and 1, depending on how ""unfair"" the die is.  Without knowing more about the specific distribution of the die, we can't say exactly what that probability is. However, we can use some basic probability theory to estimate it.
One way to approach this problem is to assume that the probability of each number on the die is proportional to its relative frequency in a fair die. For example, if a fair six-sided die has the following probabilities: $P(1) = P(2) = \frac{1}{6}$, $P(3) = \frac{2}{6}$, $P(4) = \frac{3}{6}$, $P(5) = \frac{4}{6}$, and $P(6) = \frac{5}{6}$, then the probability of getting any particular number is still $\frac{1}{6}$.
Now, let's consider Jerry's situation. He throws two dice, one of which is unfair. We want to know the probability that he gets a larger number than 3 on both dice. This event can happen in three ways:

* Both dice show a number greater than 3.
* One die shows a number greater than 3 and the other die shows a number less than or equal to 3.
* Both dice show a number less than or equal to 3.

The first case happens with probability $\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}$. The second case happens with probability $\frac{4}{6}\times\frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6}\times\frac{4}{6} = \frac{24}{36}$. And the third case happens with probability $\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$. Therefore, the total probability of Jerry getting a larger number than 3 on both dice is:

$$\text{Probability} = \frac{25}{36} + \frac{24}{36} + \frac{1}{36} ="
Response:  If Jenna and her mother took half as many apples from their apple farm, then Jenna took 15 apples (half of 30).  If Mor had 20 apples, how many did she have after Jenna took some?  Therefore, Mor had 5 apples left (20 - 15 = 5).
Response:  We know that there are 10 cages with hamsters and each cage has 5 pieces of food. So, in total, we have 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of food for the hamsters. Now, we also know that no other animals in the store get any food except for the rats. There are 4 rats in each cage, so they will get 4 x 6 = 24 pieces of food per cage. Finally, we know that there is one canary cage with 20 pieces of food. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food distributed among all the animals in the store is 50 + 24 + 20 = 94 pieces of food. Since there are 160 pieces of food initially, and only 94 are distributed among the animals, it means that 66 pieces of food remain unused or uneaten (160 - 94 = 66).
"Response:  If Mandy pays $100 to Benedict after 3 months and they get a monthly interest of 2%, then we can calculate how much money Benedict will have after 3 months as follows:

Money Benedict has after 3 months = $100 + (2% of $100) x 3 months
= $100 + ($2 x $100) / 100
= $100 + $20
= $120

So, after 3 months, Benedict should have $120."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of each bag is $30, and the total profit made by the trader after selling all bags is $400. So, we can write an equation based on this information as follows:  Profit = Number of bags x Price per bag  Profit = 10 (since there are 10 bags in total) x $30 per bag = $300  Now, we need to find out how many bags the trader sold. We are given that he made a total profit of $400, so if he had sold fewer than 10 bags, his profit would have been less than $400. Therefore, we can conclude that the trader sold exactly 10 bags.
Response:  Firstly, they spent $20,25 on three tickets to the mass. Then, they spent less than $4,50 on food. Finally, they took two different rides that cost $33 each. If they equally shared all costs among themselves, how much should each person pay?  Solution: To find out how much each person should pay, we need to add up all the costs and divide them by the number of people involved. So, let's do that: Total Cost = Ticket price + Food cost + Ride cost = $20,25 + ($4,50 - 4,50) + (2 x $33) = $68,75 / 3 = $22,91 per person. Therefore, each person should pay $22,91 towards the total costs.
Response:  If John can collect fresh cherries in three hours and he can collect two persimmons per minute, then we need to calculate how many persimmons he will collect in total. We know that there are 3 hours x 60 minutes = 180 minutes in total. So, if he collects 2 persimmons per minute, then he will collect 2 x 180 = 360 persimmons in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 360 persimmons.
Response:  If one person needs to eat three kilograms of insects per week to survive, then a group of ten people will need how many kilograms of insects per day? To find out, we can divide the total amount needed by the number of people in the group. So, if one person needs 3 kg/week = 3 x 7 = 21 kg/month, then a group of ten people will need 21 kg / 10 people = 2.1 kg/day.
Response:  We know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and also cuts down 2/4 of them every quarter year (i.e., every 6 months). So, after 10 years, he will have cut down 2 x 2 = 4 trees. Now, we are told that after 10 years, 30% of the remaining trees are gone. This means that after 10 years, Tom has 70% of the original number of trees left, which is equal to 70/100 x 50 = 35 trees. Therefore, Tom has 35 trees left after 10 years.
Response:  On Friday morning, neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in front of Sue's house. On Sunday morning, they took one-third of the flamingos and painted them white, then returned them to their original location outside Sue's house. So, what happened around half an hour after Sunday morning?  Based on the information provided, there were more pink plastic flamingos present.
Response:  First, we know that Violetta wants to buy new color pens and has budgeted $20 for this purpose. Then, each pen costs $2, so she needs 10 pens in total (20 / 2 = 10). Finally, since one biro costs $2, she will have $8 left over after buying all the pens ($20 - 10 x $2 = $8). Therefore, the correct answer is $8.
Response:  We know that one penny costs $0.05 and we have to find out how much eight pennies cost. So, if we multiply $0.05 by 8, we get $0.40. Therefore, eight pennies cost $0.40.
Response:  We have to divide 200 pounds of garlic between 40 restaurants in a certain city. Each restaurant will get half a pound (or 8 ounces) of garlic. So, how many pounds of garlic are left over after dividing them equally among all the restaurants?  Pounds of garlic divided by number of restaurants = Remaining pounds of garlic 200 / 40 = 5 pounds of garlic remaining After calculating the amount of garlic each restaurant gets and subtracting it from the total amount available, we can see that there are 5 pounds of garlic leftover.
Response:  We know that there are 23786 inhabitants in Soda, including 8417 males and 9092 females. So, we have a total of 17509 people (males + females). Now, let's calculate the number of children in Soda. Since the population consists of both adults and children, we can assume that half of the population is made up of children. Therefore, the number of children in Soda is approximately equal to 17509 / 2 = 8750.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine collected 20 cards. Then in the second month, she collected three times as many cards as in the first month, so she collected 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as in the previous two months combined, so she collected 120 cards (2 x 60 = 120). Therefore, the total number of cards Elaine has collected is 120 + 60 + 20 = 180 cards.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark edits as many sentences in one week for two different clients, who pay him differently. Client A pays him $0.05 per sentence, while client B pays him twice as much, or $0.10 per sentence. Since Mark edited a total of 1000 sentences last week, he earned:

For client A: $0.05 x 1000 = $50
For client B: $0.10 x 1000 = $100
So, Mark earned a total of $150 last week."
"Response: 
1. In the morning, Baldur gets 5 liters of water from the spring. So he has 5 liters + 5 liters = 10 liters of water in total.
2. In the afternoon, he gets an additional 6 liters of water from the spring. So now he has 10 liters + 6 liters = 16 liters of water in total.
3. The question asks how many liters of water Baldur drinks per day. Since he starts with 10 liters and ends with 16 liters, he drunk 6 liters (16 - 10) of water per day."
Response:  If John gets the prize on day 1 of the year and he works for 50 weeks in a year (assuming a standard 52-week year), then he will have worked for 50 x 4 = 200 weeks in a year. Since his weekly salary is $2000, his total annual income would be $2000 x 200 = $400,000. Now, if we apply the 5% increase in salary, his new annual salary would be $400,000 + ($400,000 x 5%) = $420,000. So, John should receive an additional $20,000 as his bonus, bringing his total annual income to $420,000 + $20,000 = $440,000.
Response:  We know that the farm has an area of 10 hectares and produces 5 tons of apples per year. Since each ton of apples yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate how many barrels of wine are produced annually as follows: Barrels of wine = Ton of apples x Number of barrels/ton = 5 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels/year Therefore, the farm produces 10 barrels of wine per year.
"Response: 
Day 1: He had one piece of bread with one slice of cheese for lunch and used two slices of cheese in his sandwich. So he used 3 pieces of cheese that day.
Day 2: He had an omelette with eggs and cheese for breakfast and used one slice of cheese in it. So he used 4 pieces of cheese that day.
Day 3: He had another sandwich with one slice of cheese. So he used 5 pieces of cheese that day.
Total number of pieces of cheese used = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 pieces of cheese."
Response:  We know that Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, for a total of 32 pens. Then she bought 6 packs of blue pens and 2 packs of red pens. Each pack contains a certain number of pens, so let's assume that each pack of blue pens contains 5 pens (since there are 6 packs) and each pack of red pens contains 4 pens (since there are 2 packs). Therefore, the total number of pens that Janet has after buying the new pens is:  32 + 5 x 6 = 32 + 30 = 62 pens. So, Janet has 62 pens in total.
Response:  We know that Brinley has already taken five tests and got scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. If he wants to get an average score of 93 in the sixth test, we need to find out how many points he needs to get to reach this target. To do this, we can subtract his lowest score (71) from his total score of 456 (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 456): 456 - 71 = 385. So, Brinley needs to get at least 385 points on the sixth test to achieve an overall average of 93.
"Response:  Firstly, he cycled 5 times in one week (given as ""veka""). This means he covered a distance of 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers per week.  Then, he decided to cycle for two days more (given as ""to dagar""), which means he covered an additional distance of 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers. So, his total distance traveled is 125 + 120 = 245 kilometers."
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples in total. If each chocolate bar weighs 100 grams (as stated in the problem), then the total weight of all chocolate bars is: 25 x 100 = 2500 grams. Similarly, if each candied apple weighs 50 grams (also as stated in the problem), then the total weight of all candied apples is: 80 x 50 = 4000 grams. Now, let's assume that Joe's candy has twice as much sugar as an average candy. So, if an average candy contains 50 grams of sugar, then Joe's candy contains 100 grams of sugar (since it's twice as much). Therefore, the total weight of sugar in Joe's candy is: 2500 + 4000 = 6500 grams. Finally, if Joe's candy contains 40 grams of sugar per piece, then the total number of pieces of candy is: 6500 / 40 = 162.5 pieces.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes at the first store. Then on Tuesday, she went to another store and bought 3 times as many cakes as she bought on Monday, which is 12 cakes (since 3 x 4 = 12). Finally, on Wednesday, she went to yet another store and bought 5 times as many cakes as she bought on Tuesday, which is 60 cakes (since 5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, in total, Rose bought 76 cakes after all three days (4 + 12 + 60 = 76).
Response:  We know that 25 copper plates cost $1200 less than half of 1200 taller kitchen utensils. So we can write an equation as follows: Cost of 25 copper plates = Half of 1200 taller kitchen utensils - $1200. Now let's solve for the total cost of buying 4 quarters: Total cost of buying 4 quarters = Cost of 25 copper plates + Cost of 375 taller kitchen utensils. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total cost of buying 4 quarters = $900 + $8750 = $9650. Therefore, the total cost of buying 4 quarters is $9650.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has saved $10 before she started babysitting.  If she saves $5 per time she babysits and she can babysit four times in total, then she will have $20 (5 x 4 = 20). So after saving money from her first three babysittings, she will have a total of $30 ($10 + $20 = $30) which is the cost of the new jacket and shoes combined. Therefore, if she wants to buy both items, she needs to work at least 6 times (30 / 5 = 6) to save enough money.
Response:  If Jerry has two white chickens that lay 5 eggs each day and he collects 42 eggs per day, then the total number of eggs collected is: 42 x 2 = 84 eggs/day. Now, if there are more red chickens than white chickens (as stated in the problem), we can assume that the ratio of red to white chickens is greater than 1:2. So, for every 2 white chickens, there are more than 1 red chicken. Therefore, the number of red chickens is: 84 / (2 + 1) = 84 / 3 = 28 red chickens.
Response:  We know that the park is a rectangle with dimensions of 1.5x6 miles = 9 square miles (since we are given that it is a rectangle). If Gary walks at a speed of 3 km/h, he will cover a distance of 3 km/h x time taken = distance traveled. Since we want to find out how many hours he will take to walk around the park, we can set up an equation based on this information: Distance = Speed x Time. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Distance = 3 km/h x Time  Now, we need to convert the distance from kilometers to hours. There are 1000 meters in 1 kilometer, so: Distance (in hours) = Distance (in kilometers) / 1000 meters per kilometer = 9 miles / 1000 meters per kilometer = 9 hours Therefore, if Gary walks at a speed of 3 km/h around the local park, which measures 9 square miles or 9 hours.
Response:  On day one, 100 customers entered the store. Then, on day two, 50 more customers came in, making it a total of 150 customers. So far, so good! But then comes the tricky part - the question asks about the number of customers on the third day. Now, we need to use our brains and apply some logic here. If there were initially 100 customers on day one, added to that is another 50 customers who came in on day two, bringing the total number of customers to 150. That means if 50 more customers come in on the third day (as per the question), then the total number of customers would be 200! Therefore, the correct answer is 200.
Response:  We know that Jerry has two bathtubs and they both hold two liters of water per minute. For four minutes, the big bathtub had twice as much water as the small one. The big bathtub now holds four times as much water as the small one. How much water does the small bathtug have?  So, if the big bathtub has 4 times as much water as the small one, then the small bathtub has half as much water as the big bathtub. Therefore, the small bathtub has 2 liters of water.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lori has available to spend after taxes:
$320 - (32 x $8) = $276
Now, let's find out how many hours she needs to work to earn enough money to buy both shoes and the belt:
$276 / $8 per hour = 35 hours
So, Lori would have to work for 35 hours to be able to afford both items."
Response:  Firstly, we know that $2000 is borrowed and promised to be returned with an additional 10% interest. So, the total amount owed is: $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2200. Now, we are asked how much Janeth will have to pay each month for 12 months. Therefore, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows: Monthly Payment = Total Amount Owed / Number of Months = $2200 / 12 = $165 per month. Thus, Janeth will have to pay $165 per month for 12 months to settle the debt completely.
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the vase and seven daisies more than roses in the vase. So, if there are x roses, then there are 7x - 4 = total number of blossoms in the vase.  Therefore, the answer is 35.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three years older than Harriet and Harriet is half as old as Zack. So we can write:
Adrian = Harriet + (Zack - Harriet) / 2
Substituting the values given in the question:
Adrian = 21 + (30 - 21) / 2
= 21 + 15 / 2
= 46
Therefore, Adrian is 46 years old."
Response:  We know that total points scored by students = 251.  Naomi scored 68 points, so she scored (251 - 68) / 2 = 183 points less than the total score.  Therefore, Jojo scored 251 - 183 = 68 points.
Response:  It took Carmen 10 minutes to make one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to make one Sudoku puzzle. In total, she solved 3 crosswords and 8 Sudoku puzzles in holy week. How much time did she spend playing games?
Response:  If the small garden has 120 liters of water in it and Celine used 90 liters from the tank to water her little garden, then she had 30 liters of water left in the tank (120 - 90 = 30). Now, if she was able to collect rainwater that was twice as much as what was left in the tank, then she collected 60 liters of rainwater (30 x 2 = 60). So, the answer is 60 liters.
Response:  We know that Andy has planted 90 geraniums and 40 smaller petunias than geraniums. So, if we assume that one geranium produces 1 bloom, then Andy has 90 x 1 = 90 blooms from his geraniums. Since he has fewer petunias, let's say he has 40 / 3 = 13 blooms from his petunias (since there are 3 times as many petunias as geraniums). Therefore, in total, Andy has 90 + 13 = 103 blooms.
Response:  In year one, the company spent $15,000 on advertising. Then in year two, they spent one-third of that amount, or $5,000. So the total amount the company spent on advertising over those two years is: $$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000$$ Therefore, the answer is $20,000.
Response:  If Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour and Benji rents a banana boat flotilla for $18 per hour, then we need to calculate how much they have spent in total.  Carlos has used the canoe for three hours, so he has spent $30 x 3 = $90.  Benji has used the banana boat flotilla for five hours, so he has spent $18 x 5 = $90 as well.  Therefore, both of them have spent exactly the same amount of money, which is $90.
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half of those days are spent driving from New Jersey to Rochester with a car, how many days will Andrew take if he plans to travel to Rochester by bus and then drive back home from Rochester?  Solution:  To find out how many days Andrew will spend on his trip, we need to subtract the time spent driving from New Jersey to Rochester with a car (which is half of the total time) from the total time taken by bus. So, the number of days Andrew will spend on his trip is:  6 - (1/2) = 3 days. Therefore, Andrew will take 3 days to complete his trip.
Response:  If James has 30 Fire cards, 20 Grass cards, and 40 Water cards, then he has a total of 90 cards in his deck. To calculate the probability that he will draw two or more of any given type, we can use the following formula: Probability = (Number of cards of that type / Total number of cards) x 100. Using this formula, we can calculate the probabilities for each type as follows:  For Fire cards: Probability = (30 / 90) x 100 = 33%  For Grass cards: Probability = (20 / 90) x 100 = 22%  For Water cards: Probability = (40 / 90) x 100 = 44% So, based on these probabilities, it is most likely that James will draw either two or three Fire cards (given that there are 33% Fire cards in his deck).
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate the cost of the basic burrito without any upgrades or discounts: 6,50 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0,25 = 9,80 dollars. Now, let's consider the upgrades and discounts: 3 + 2 (chips) + 1 (drink) = 6 dollars. Finally, we subtract the gift card value from the total amount: 9,80 - 5 = 4,80 dollars. Therefore, the total amount that Chad will pay is 4,80 dollars.
Response:  If Kalinda can lay down 4 pieces in one minute and her mother can barely keep up with 2 pieces per minute, it means that Kalinda is working at a pace of 4 times faster than her mother. To complete the puzzle, we need to know how many minutes it takes for Kalinda to lay down all the pieces. We are given that she can lay down 4 pieces in one minute, so it will take her (number of pieces / number of pieces per minute) = 4 / 2 = 2 minutes to lay down all the pieces. Therefore, if Kalinda works for 2 minutes non-stop, she will have completed the entire puzzle.
Response:  We know that the farm produced 120 baby watermelons and after two months, Ashlyn went back to check if they were ready for harvesting. She found out that 30% of them were mature enough to be harvested, so she took some with her. Later when she returned, she found that 75% of the remaining melons were mature enough to be harvested, which means that only 25% of the original number of melons were not yet mature enough to be harvested after two weeks. Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark bought 12 cars worth $120,000 (12 x $10,000). Then he paid 10% of the total cost as taxes which is $12,000 ($120,000 x 10%). After that, he paid $1,000 to register each car, so in total he paid $13,000 ($12,000 + $1,000 x 12). Therefore, Mark pays a total of $13,000 for all 12 cars.
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 shells more than Robert, so she collected 5 + 20 = 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collected double the number of shells as on Monday, so she collected 25 x 2 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 maur in the garden and they picked half of the insects, then there are 50 x 2 = 100 insects left in the garden. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 100.
Response:  If there are 36 penguins and 1/3 of them jump over and swim in the sea, then there are 24 penguins that go into their burrows to eat dinner. So, if many penguins can hold themselves until sunbathing, we need to find out how many penguins can do this. As there are 24 penguins left after some have gone to the sea or their burrows, it means that 8 penguins (i.e., 24 x 1/3) can hold themselves until sunbathing. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  If Steve has twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, then in one week he will eat 42 tomatoes (6 x 7 = 42). To find out how many three-year old trees he needs to plant to produce that amount of tomatoes, we can use the formula: Number of trees needed = Total number of tomatoes / Production rate per tree. In this case, the production rate per tree is 42 tomatoes/week / 3 years = 14 tomatoes/year/tree. So, Steve needs approximately 28 trees (14 tomatoes/year/tree x 28 years) to produce enough tomatoes to meet his daily demand.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and John wants to share the pizza equally among them. So each friend will get 1/5 of the pizza (since there are 5 pieces in total). Now we need to find out how many pieces of pizza John needs to buy if he wants to make sure that every friend gets their fair share. To do this, we can divide the number of friends by the number of pieces per friend: Number of pieces = Number of friends / Pieces per friend = 20 friends / 1/5 = 40 pieces of pizza Therefore, John needs to order 40 pieces of pizza to ensure that everyone gets their fair share.
Response:  If he can mix ink from five empty pens to make one full pen, then he will have 5/1 = 5 full pens after mixing the ink from all 25 pens. So, he will get 5 x 25 = 125 new pens.
Response:  Firstly, Johnny took $20 from his pocket and added $10 more. So he has $30 now. Then he invested this amount which tripled in one year. Therefore, after one year, Johnny would have $90 ($30 x 3).
Response:  We know that: * Mary is younger than Joan, so Mary's age is x - 5. * Joan is older than Jessa, so Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25. Now we have two equations: x - 5 = 25 and x = 20 + 5. Solving for x, we get: x = 15. So Mary is 15 years old.
Response:  We know that 1000 students were inside the school building and we also know that 30% of them left through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, and the rest left through exit C. So, if x is the number of students who left through exit C, then we can write:  x = (40 - 30) / 5 = 200. Therefore, there were 200 students who left through exit C.
Response:  We know that James has more gods than Robert. So if James has x gods, Robert has less than x gods.  We also know that John has twice as many slippers as Robert, so John has 2x = 2 \* (less than x) gods.  Finally, we are told that John has 54 slippers, so the number of gods James has is equal to the number of slippers John has minus the number of gods James has:  x = 54 - (2 \* (less than x)). Simplifying this equation gives us: x = 54 / 3 = 18. Therefore, James has 18 gods.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then in total they have 3 books.  If both of them read each other's book as well as their own, then they will have read 6 books in total (3 + 3).
Response:  We know that Mike can write one page in 5 minutes. So he will be able to write $ \frac{1}{2} \times 5 = 2.5$ pages per hour. Since they are sending their letters twice a week, we have $\text{number of hours} = 2 \times 7 = 14$ hours per week. Therefore, Mike will be able to write $\boxed{\text{total number of pages}} = 2.5 \times 14 = 35$ pages per week.
Response:  If Jason has 1000 minutes in a month and he spends 15 minutes talking to his boss each day, then he talks for a total of 450 minutes (15 x 30) during the month. So, he has 550 minutes left after talking to his boss (1000 - 450 = 550). Therefore, Jason has 550 minutes remaining if he has 30 days in the month.
Response:  We know that Griffin initially had 24 pommes frites and then Ginger gave him an additional 3 pommes frites. So, Griffin now has 27 pommes frites in total (24 + 3 = 27).  Now we are told that Kyle took 5 of Griffin's pommes frites, leaving Griffin with 22 pommes frites (27 - 5 = 22). Then, Billy took double the number of pommes frites as Kyle, which means he took 10 pommes frites (double 5 = 10). So, after Billy took the pommes frites, Griffin was left with 12 pommes frites (22 - 10 = 12). Finally, Colby took 3 pommes frites from Griffin, leaving him with 9 pommes frites (12 - 3 = 9). Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that there are 4 frogs in one aquarium and 32 frogs in another aquarium. The difference between the number of frogs in these two aquariums is twice as large as the number of fish in them. If both aquariums have the same number of fish, then many more fish are in the second aquarium than in the first one. So, the answer is 80 (twice the number of fish in the first aquarium).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the makeup artist earned $250 per hour and worked for six hours in one day. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the makeup artist in one day is:

$250/hour x 6 hours = $1,500

Now, let's calculate how much time it took to complete four layers of makeup during five weeks:

Time taken to complete four layers of makeup = Total duration of the project / Number of layers of makeup
= 5 weeks / 4 layers = 1.25 weeks (or approximately 9 days)

So, the makeup artist spent approximately nine days working on the film. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money earned by the makeup artist based on the number of days worked:

Total amount of money earned by the makeup artist = Daily rate x Number of days worked
= $250/day x 9 days = $2,250

Finally, after the film was completed, the makeup artist received a 10% discount on their earnings. So, the actual amount of money earned by the makeup artist is:

Actual amount of money earned by the makeup artist = Original amount earned x Discount percentage
= $2,250 x 10% = $225

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Jean earned $225."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Isabella spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, and she shared these costs equally among her three parents, so each parent paid $4. Then, she spent $43 on birthday gifts, which she also shared equally among her parents, so each parent paid $14. Next, she spent $15 on decorations, again sharing the cost equally among her parents, so each parent paid $5. Finally, she spent $4 on invitations, and since there are three parents, they all paid $1. Therefore, in total, each parent paid $4 + $14 + $5 + $1 = $29. So, the correct answer is $29.
Response:  The cook bought 4 bags of potatoes that weigh 15 kg each. So, in total, he bought 60 kg of potatoes (4 x 15). Now, let's calculate how much each bag costs. If one kilogram of potatoes costs $1.50, then the cost of 60 kg of potatoes is $90 ($1.50 x 60). Therefore, the cook used $90 to buy the potatoes.
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate four bells (which means she ate 4 x 200 = 800 calories). On Tuesday, she doubled her food intake to 1600 calories. Her sister had 5 cakes on Monday and 13 cakes on Tuesday, which means she ate a total of 5 x 200 + 13 x 200 = 1750 calories. Therefore, Sue has eaten more calories than her sister.
