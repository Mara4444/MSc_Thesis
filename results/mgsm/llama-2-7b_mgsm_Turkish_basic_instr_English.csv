Explanation: If he can run at a speed of 3 miles per hour, and he runs for 3 hours, then he covers a distance of 9 miles (3 x 3 = 9). Since he takes breaks in between, let's assume that during each break, he moves forward by half the distance covered during the previous hour (i.e., 4.5 miles). Therefore, after 2 hours of running + 1 hour of breaks, he has moved a total distance of 7 miles (4.5 x 2 + 4.5 = 7). So, in total, he covers 9 + 7 = 16 miles."

"Response: 50/9 = 5555.56
Explanation: In this problem, we are given two quantities, $Marcell$ and $Beatrice$, which represent the amounts of food eaten by each person in a competition. We are asked to find out how many portions of food they will eat in total if they both eat their respective amounts perfectly. To do this, we need to calculate the average number of portions that each person will eat based on their individual amounts.
We know that $\text{Marcell}$ has an amount of $3 \times 14 = 42$ units of food, while $\text{Beatrice}$ has an amount of $2 \times 24 = 48$ units of food. If they both eat their respective amounts perfectly, then the total amount of food eaten by them is equal to the sum of their individual amounts:
$$\text{Total amount} = \text{Marcell} + \text{Beatrice} = 42 + 48 = 90$$
Since there are $90 / 2 = 45$ portions of food in total, the average number of portions that each person will eat is:
$$\frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Number of portions}} = \frac{90}{45} = 5555.56$$
Therefore, the answer is $5555.56$."

"Response:  $186$
Explanation:
Kim has 3 customers and expects to make $92$ per week in total revenue from them. Each customer will buy $2$ white vases and $5$ flower bouquets, which amounts to a total revenue of $92$. Since each white vase costs $2$, the total cost for all 3 customers would be $66$. Therefore, Kim's profit margin would be $26 ($92 - $66$). If there are 5 potential customers, and they purchase similar quantities as the existing customers, then Kim can expect to make an additional $430 ($2 x $215) in revenue per week. This brings the total expected weekly revenue to $572 ($92 + $430). To calculate Lucas's share of the profits, we need to divide the total expected weekly revenue by the number of weeks he works (assuming he works every week). So, Lucas can expect to make $186 ($572 / 6) per week in profits."

Explanation:
Dave initially had a big bag of potatoes and divided it into 4 equal parts. He then gave one part to each of his three friends, who in turn divided their share into 3 equal parts. So, after all the divisions, there were 3 x 3 = 9 parts of potatoes left. Then, the three roosters took turns eating 3 parts each, leaving 1 part remaining with Dave. Therefore, when Dave finally got his bag back, he had 12 (1 + 3 + 3 + 1) parts of potatoes."

"Response: 1875 ( rounded to two decimal places)
Explanation:
Jessica needs to pay at least $50 more than the minimum payment for each credit account. For the credit card, this means she needs to pay at least $260 ($200 + $50). For the loan, this means she needs to pay at least $450 ($500 - $50). In total, Jessica needs to pay at least $710 per year ($260 + $450). To find out how much she will actually pay in one year, we can use the formula: Total Amount = Minimum Payment x Number of Payments. Since Jessica makes 12 payments per year, and the minimum payment is $50, the total amount she will pay in one year is: Total Amount = $50 x 12 = $600. Therefore, Jessica will actually pay $600 per year."

"Response: 48 hammers (hamsters)
Explanation:
The problem states that there are 3 groups of 10 hammers each in one big cage and each group has 5 pieces of food. Therefore, the total number of hammers is 3 x 10 = 30.
Additionally, the problem states that there is a small cage with 20 pieces of food for the rats. Since there are no other places to use the food, all of it must be given to the rats. So, the number of hammers is reduced by half, which gives us 30 / 2 = 15 hammers left over after giving food to the rats.
Therefore, the final answer is 30 + 15 = 45 hammers."

"Response: 18750 $ (approximately)
Explanation:
Let's assume that John wins the prize every week and receives $5000 as the prize money with a 5% increase annually. To calculate the total amount of prize money won by John in a year, we can use the formula: Total Prize Money = Number of Weeks x Prize Money per Week + (Number of Years x Annual Increase).
Given:
* Number of weeks in a year = 52
* Prize money per week = $5000
* Number of years = 1
* Annual increase = 5%
Now, let's plug in these values into the formula:Total Prize Money = 52 x $5000 + (1 x 5%)Total Prize Money = $18750So, John wins approximately $18750 in prize money throughout the year."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the company spent $15,000 on advertising for one year and then allocated this amount among three categories of advertising over the next two years. To calculate the total amount spent on advertising over these two years, we need to divide the initial $15,000 by three and multiply it by two (since there are two additional years). Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising over these two years is $45,000 ($15,000 / 3 x 2 = $45,000).

"Response: 65%
Explanation:
If there are 40 su-type Pokémon cards and 8 of them are randomly selected to be destroyed, then the probability that the chosen card is a water-type card is 40/112 = 36%.
Since 14 fire-type cards are added to the deck after 8 water-type cards are removed, the probability that a random card drawn from the deck is a fire-type card is 20/94 = 21%.
Therefore, the probability that the randomly chosen card belongs to any type other than water is 36 + 21 = 57%, or 65%."

Response: 36000 (36 thousand) dollars. Explanation: To calculate the total amount paid by the company for all cars, we need to multiply the number of cars by their purchase price and then subtract the taxes. Since each car costs $20,000 and there are 12 cars in total, the total cost of purchasing the cars is $240,000 ($20,000 x 12). However, the company pays an additional $10,000 as taxes per car, so the total amount paid by the company is $250,000 ($240,000 + $10,000 x 12).

Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of students who left the school after the event is x. Since 30% of the students who left the school came from group A, the number of students who left the school from group A is 0.3x = 300. Similarly, since 35% of the remaining students came from group B, the number of students who left the school from group B is 0.35(900 - 300) = 420. Finally, since all the remaining students came from group C, the number of students who left the school from group C is 0.65(900 - 420) = 276. Therefore, the total number of students who left the school after the event is 300 + 420 + 276 = 996."
