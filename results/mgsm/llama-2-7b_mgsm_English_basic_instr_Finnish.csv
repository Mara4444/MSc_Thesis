Explanation:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68/dozen = $204
She also bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80/dozen = $160

Kysymys:  Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days. 
Vastaus:  To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information provided in the question.
Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Tuesday: (2/5) x 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 16 hours
Wednesday: 2 x 16 hours = 32 hours
Total hours spent writing articles in the three days = 20 + 16 + 32 = 78 hours
Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 78 hours writing articles last week."

Rationale:  To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide his total amount of money by the cost of one trip to the movies. Since the cost of one trip is $14 ($7 for the ticket + $7 for the popcorn), we can divide $42 (the total amount of money) by $14 to get the number of trips: $42 / $14 = 5. Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 5 times with the $42 he has for the week."

Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, which means she has used 1/5 of her total fuel capacity (since 100 / 5 = 20). So, if she fills up her tank with 4 gallons of gas, she will have 4 / 5 of her total fuel capacity left, or 8 gallons. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, this means she will be able to drive an additional 8 - 12 = 6 miles on a single tank of gas. Therefore, Sophia can drive 6 miles on a single tank of gas.

Total number of students per week is 75 + 120 = 195 students.  If each student pays $15.00, then total revenue per week is 195 students x $15.00 = $2,825.00.

Rationale:  If each 16-ounce can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked, then the total volume of all the tomatoes in one can is equal to half the volume of a single can. Therefore, if Freda used x cans of tomatoes and each can contained 3 tomatoes, then the total number of tomatoes used by Freda is 3x. Since Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, we know that 3x = 32. Solving for x, we get x = 3. So, Freda used 3 cans of tomatoes, which contain 9 tomatoes (3 x 3)."

Rationale:  To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the number of questions he answered from the total number of questions on both tests. On the first test, Mark answered 75/5 = 15 questions per hour. Therefore, it took him 8 hours to answer 8 x 15 = 120 questions. Since he only answered 75 questions on the first test, he left 45 questions incomplete (120 - 75). Similarly, on the second test, Mark answered 100/5 = 20 questions per hour. It took him 6 hours to answer 6 x 20 = 120 questions. However, since he already answered 45 questions on the previous test, he left 75 questions incomplete (120 - 45)."

Finally, he picked up the third Lego boxed set that had 1/4 the number of pieces (or 1/4 x 1500 = 375 pieces). So, he has an additional 375 blocks from this set.
In total, Johnny picked up 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2775 blocks."

2. The seagull ate half of the remaining fries, which was 28 / 2 = 14 fries.
3. Three pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which was 28 / 3 = 9 fries.
5. Ants carried off one fry, leaving 5 fries.

Therefore, there were 42 fries in the pack when Dave bought it."

My reasoning:
Jerry has rolled the die 6 times, so there are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 5/6 = 0.83 (or 83%).
To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the intersection of the sets of all even numbers and all pairs of consecutive even numbers. The intersection of these sets is {4, 6}, which means that the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 2/6 = 0.33 (or 33%).
Therefore, the difference between the probabilities is 83% - 33% = 50%. So, the answer is 50%."

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection, so now there are 30 pink flamingos in total (12 + 18 = 30).
Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 30 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos (30 - 12 = 18)."

Rationale:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and doing chores. We know that Sara has $10 already saved plus the $5 she earned from babysitting the first time, so she has a total of $15. Then, we subtract the cost of the jacket ($30) and the cost of one pair of shoes ($20), which is $50. So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 8 times to save enough money to buy the jacket and two pairs of shoes."
"Response: 18
Rationale:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs/day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs/day, we can write:

Red chickens: 3 x 10 = 30 eggs/day
White chickens: 5 x 10 = 50 eggs/day
Total eggs/day = 30 + 50 = 80 eggs/day

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs/day, it means that there are 42 - 80 = -38 eggs/day left uncollected. This is impossible since eggs cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have 80 eggs/day collected by Jerry.
Now, let's count the number of red chickens:

Red chickens: 30 / 3 = 10 red chickens
So, Jerry has 10 red chickens."

Finally, there is an additional $1000 registration fee for each car, so the total cost is $25,000 ($240,000 + $24,000 + (12 x $1000))."

Rationale:  We are given that there were 1000 students in the school hall. After the meeting, 30% of the students went out through exit A, which means 300 students (30% of 1000) went out through exit A. Now, we need to find out how many students went out through exit C.
According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, which means 600 students (60% of 1000 - 300) remained. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 400 (1000 - 600). So, the answer is 200."

Response:  In this problem, we are given that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. We are also told that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x. Then, the number of fish in the second aquarium is 2x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can write: Number of snails in the first aquarium = 2x + 4 Number of snails in the second aquarium = 2(2x) + 32 Now, we want to find out how many fish are in each aquarium. To do this, we need to divide the total number of snails by the number of snails in each aquarium: Number of fish in the first aquarium = Total number of snails / Number of snails in the first aquarium = (2x + 4) / 4 = x Number of fish in the second aquarium = Total number of snails / Number of snails in the second aquarium = (2(2x) + 32) / (2x + 4) = 2x Therefore, there are x fish in the first aquarium and 2x fish in the second aquarium.
