Explanation:
The tree will cost $90 to plant each year for 9 years, and it will take 7 lemons to make one dollar. Therefore, the total cost of raising the tree is:
$90 x 9 = $810
Since the tree takes 7 lemons to make one dollar, we can calculate the number of lemons required to raise the tree as follows:
$810 / $1 = 810 lemons
Therefore, it will take 810 lemons to raise the tree from planting to harvesting. Since the tree will be harvested every 7 years, it will take 24 years (i.e., 810 lemons / 7 years per harvest) to raise the tree from planting to its first harvest."

Explanation: According to the question, when Polly was carrying the gold nugget and walking towards the fire, she could feel the heat from the fire increasing as she approached it. Specifically, the temperature of the fire increased by 100 degrees Celsius every 50 meters that she walked towards it. Therefore, if Polly walked for 400 meters towards the fire while carrying the gold nugget, the temperature of the fire would have increased by 400 x 10 = 4000 degrees Celsius. However, since the gold nugget had a melting point of 1064 degrees Celsius, it would have melted three times during this distance, which is why Polly could not continue walking with the gold nugget without it falling apart."

The cost of each chicken wing is SAR 250 per kilogram, and Kis has 300 grams of chicken wings. To calculate how much it costs in total, we need to convert the weight from grams to kilograms. There are 1000 grams in one kilogram, so:

300 grams / 1000 = 0.3 kilograms

Now, let's multiply the cost of each kilogram by the amount of chicken wings Kis has:

SAR 250 x 0.3 kilograms = SAR 75

Therefore, Kis can buy 450 grams of chicken wings for SAR 75."

First, calculate the cost of materials for each product:
Cost of materials for candles = $500 x 100 = $50,000
Cost of materials for makeup = $800 x 100 = $80,000
Total cost of materials = $50,000 + $80,000 = $130,000
Now, calculate the amount of money that the mother will receive after selling both products:
Sales revenue from candles = $130,000 / 10 = $13,000
Sales revenue from makeup = $130,000 / 10 = $13,000
Total sales revenue = $13,000 + $13,000 = $26,000
After deducting 10% of the total sales revenue to cover expenses, the mother will receive:
$26,000 x 0.10 = $2,600
Therefore, the mother will receive $2,600 in total."

The total number of adults in the village is 20, and each adult requires 10 units of power to satisfy their needs. Therefore, the total number of units of power required for all adults is 20 x 10 = 200 units.
Since there are also 5 children in the village, each child requires half the amount of power as an adult, which is 5 x 5 = 25 units. Therefore, the total number of units of power required for all children is 25 units.
In addition, the sheikh wants to ensure that everyone has enough power to meet their basic needs, so he decides to allocate 10% of the total power generated by the wind turbines to the children. This means that the remaining 90% of the power will be allocated to the adults.
Therefore, the total number of units of power allocated to the villagers is 200 + 25 = 225 units."

The total cost of buying three dresses, two pairs of shoes, and one jacket at a local mall is $390.

Therefore, the total revenue of the trader after buying 400 barrels is $12,000 ($30 x 400). Since the trader makes a profit of $6,000 ($12,000 - $6,000), the number of barrels he can buy with his profits is:
$6,000 / $30 = 200 barrels
Therefore, the trader can buy 150 barrels (200 - 50) after paying the cost of transportation."

"Response: 20 liters (L) of water per day.
Explanation:
According to the question, Baal Dor receives 5 liters of water from the spring every morning and an additional 6 liters every afternoon. Since each liter contains 5 milliliters (mL), we can calculate the total amount of water received by Baal Dor as follows:
Total morning water = 5 L x 5 mL/L = 25 mL
Total afternoon water = 6 L x 5 mL/L = 30 mL
Therefore, Baal Dor receives a total of 25 + 30 = 55 mL of water per day.
Since there are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter, we can convert this value to liters as follows:
55 mL / 1000 mL = 0.055 L
So, Baal Dor receives approximately 0.055 liters of water per day."

Explanation:
The employee received a bonus of $5000 once a year and an additional 5% increase in salary every year. If he earned $2000 per week, how much money did he receive in one year?
To calculate this, we need to first determine the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year (assuming a Monday-to-Sunday workweek).
Next, we can calculate the total amount of money the employee received in a year as follows:
Yearly Bonus = $5000 x 1 = $5000
Weekly Salary = $2000 x 52 = $104,000
Total Yearly Income = Yearly Bonus + Weekly Salary = $5000 + $104,000 = $109,000
Therefore, the employee received $109,000 in one year."

The total score of all five exams is calculated as follows:
Exam 1: 89 + 71 = 160
Exam 2: 92 + 100 = 192
Exam 3: 86 + 89 = 175
Total score = 160 + 192 + 175 = 637
To find out the minimum score required to get an average of 93 in these six exams, we need to subtract the lowest score from the highest score:
Highest score = 100
Lowest score = 71
Minimum score = Highest score - Lowest score = 100 - 71 = 29
Therefore, the student needs to achieve at least 54 points in the sixth exam to get an overall average of 93."

Explanation:
To calculate the total cost of buying each box of 1200 kobans for $1200 less than half of the price of one dinar, we need to first find out how much half of one dinar is worth in dollars. Since there are 50 kobans in one dinar, half of one dinar is equal to 50 x 0.5 = $25. Therefore, the total cost of buying each box of 1200 kobans is $1200 - $25 = $1175 per box."

"Response: 120 gallons (480 liters)
Explanation:
The small pool has a surface area of 4 square feet and loses water at a rate of 4 gallons per hour. Since it takes 4 hours for the water to flow from the small pool to the large pool, there are 4 x 4 = 16 gallons of water in the small pool after 4 hours. Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is 16 gallons - 4 gallons = 12 gallons or 480 liters."

Explanation:
Lorry wants to buy a wife for $320 and a maid for $32 per hour. The total cost of buying the wife is $320, and the total cost of hiring the maid for one hour is $32. To calculate how many hours Lorry can work before he can afford to buy his wife, we need to divide the total cost of buying the wife by the cost of hiring the maid for one hour:
$320 / $32 = 10 hours
So, Lorry needs to work for 10 hours before he can afford to buy his wife."
"Response: 
The remaining balance of the loan after 12 months is calculated as follows:
Total amount borrowed = $2000
Interest rate = 10% per annum
Monthly installment = $165
Number of payments = 12 payments
Remaining balance = Total amount borrowed - (Total amount borrowed x Interest rate / Number of payments)
= $2000 - ($2000 x 10% / 12)
= $2000 - $240
= $1760
Therefore, the remaining balance of the loan after 12 months is $1760."

"Response: 0.567
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Jamie has 30 types of books, 20 types of trees, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of trees, what is the probability that the selected book will be from the type of water?
To calculate this probability, we need to divide the number of remaining water types by the total number of items Jamie has. In this case, there are 32 types of water left (30 - 8 = 32), out of a total of 74 items (30 + 20 + 40). Therefore, the probability of selecting a book from the type of water is:
Probability = Number of remaining water types / Total number of items = 32 / 74 = 0.567
So, the answer is approximately 0.567 or 56.7%."
"Response: 37.5 dollars
Explanation:
The total cost of the meal is calculated as follows:
* The basic Burger costs $6.50 x 3 = $19.50

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that 120 small pumpkins were planted and 30% of them were ready for harvest after two months. This means that 36 small pumpkins (30% x 120) were ready for harvest.
After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining pumpkins were ready for harvest, which is 28 small pumpkins (3/4 x 36). So, the total number of small pumpkins that were not ready for harvest after four months is 90 (36 - 28)."
"Response: 
The total cost of purchasing 12 cars from Mark's company is $240,000 ($20,000 x 12).
Since each car costs $20,000 and there are 12 cars in total, the total cost of each car is $240,000 / 12 = $20,000.
Therefore, the registration fee for each car is $10,000 ($20,000 - $10,000)."
