Explanation:  To find out how much money Janet makes at the farmer's market each day, we need to multiply the number of eggs she has left after cooking and baking by the price per egg. Since she has 12 eggs left after cooking and baking (4 muffins x 3 eggs/muffin = 12 eggs), and each egg costs $2, she makes $2 x 12 = $24 at the farmer's market each day."

Explanation:
Carla downloaded for 40% of the time (20 minutes) before being forced to restart, so the total time to download the file would be:
Time = Total File Size / Download Speed
= 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
= 100 minutes
However, since Carla had to restart and start over, we need to add an additional 20 minutes for the restart time:
Total Time = Time + Restart Time
= 100 minutes + 20 minutes
= 120 minutes or 2 hours
Therefore, it will take Carla approximately 2 hours to download the 200 GB file."

Explanation:
John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, which means he traveled a distance of 60 x 3 = 180 miles. Then, he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, which does not change his position. After that, he drove for another half-hour at a speed of 30 mph, which means he traveled an additional distance of 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles. Finally, he drove the remaining 4 - 2 = 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph, which means he traveled a distance of 80 x 2 = 160 miles. Therefore, John is 175 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."

In the third month, there were 30% fewer downloads, so the program had 180 - (30/100) = 126 downloads that month. Therefore, the program had a total of 180 + 126 + 60 = 466 downloads over the three months."

Explanation:
Carlos needs to calculate how long it will take him to break even on his investment in the lemon tree. To do this, he needs to subtract the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree from the revenue generated by selling the lemons.
Total cost = $90 (planting) + $3 (maintenance per year) x number of years = $90 + $3(6) = $90 + $18 = $108
Revenue = $1.5 (per lemon) x 7 (number of lemons grown per year) = $10.5
Break-even point = Total cost - Revenue = $108 - $10.5 = 6.42 years
Therefore, it will take Carlos approximately 6.42 years to start earning money on his lemon tree."

Explanation:
To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight limit of the bridge.

Total weight limit = 5000 pounds
Weight of truck + weight of driver = 3755 pounds

Subtracting the weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight limit gives us the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:

Maximum number of boxes = Total weight limit - Weight of truck - Weight of driver
= 5000 - 3755
= 1245

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 480 (since there are 1245 pounds left after subtracting the weight of the truck and the driver)."

Since each row consists of blocks from a different year, Gene has a total of 4 rows (one for each year). Therefore, the number of quilt blocks per row is 13 / 4 = 3.25 blocks per row.
So, Gene has a total of 3.25 x 4 = 12.08 quilt blocks."

"Response: 380 liter
Explanation:
The amount of water that the boat takes in can be calculated using the formula: Water taken in = Distance rowed x Rate at which water is taken in (in this case, 2L/10ft)
We know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 ft, so the distance she rowed was 20 ft / 16 sec = 1.25 ft per second
Since the shore is 64 seconds away, we can calculate the distance rowed towards the shore as follows: Distance rowed towards shore = 64 sec - Distance rowed
= 64 sec - 1.25 ft/sec x Time taken to reach shore
= 64 sec - 1.5 ft
= 49 ft
Now, we know that the boat takes in 2 L of water for every 10 ft rowed, so the total amount of water taken in can be calculated as follows: Total water taken in = Distance rowed x Rate at which water is taken in
= 49 ft x 2 L/10 ft
= 98 L
Therefore, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat has taken on approximately 98 liters of water."

Explanation:
Sasha can sell all of her leftover lumber at a price of $18 per board (which is halfway between the original purchase price and the current market price). This will give her total revenue of:

$10 x 10 = $100 from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards
$16 x 5 = $80 from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards
Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180

Her costs are:

$10 x 10 = $100 for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards
$16 x 5 = $80 for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards
Total costs = $100 + $80 = $180

So her profit is:
Profit = Total revenue - Total costs = $180 - $180 = $0
Therefore, Sasha makes no profit on the sale of her leftover lumber."

Explanation:
The total number of minutes seen by the patients in a day is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes.
Since each doctor spends 24 minutes with each patient on average, the total time spent by the doctors in a day is 12,000 minutes / 24 = 500 hours.
The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the total amount charged by the doctors in a day is 500 hours x $150/hour = $75,000.
The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total amount collected by the hospital in a day is 500 hours x $200/hour = $100,000.
The profit made by the hospital is therefore ($100,000 - $75,000) = $25,000 per day."

Explanation:
To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we can use the following formula:

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes

In this case, there are 6 possible outcomes when Jerry rolls the die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Of these, only the outcomes 4, 5, and 6 are greater than 3. Therefore, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is:

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes) = (3) / (6) = 0.5 or 50%

Now, to find the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probability of him rolling an even number on the first roll, and then the probability of him rolling another even number on the second roll. Since there are three even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), the probability of Jerry rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 or 0.5. The probability of him rolling another even number on the second roll, given that he rolled an even number on the first roll, is also 3/6 or 0.5. Therefore, the overall probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row is:

Probability = Probability of rolling an even number on the first roll x Probability of rolling another even number on the second roll = 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%

So, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%."

Explanation:
Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(y), where y is the number of white chickens Jerry has.
The total number of eggs collected by Jerry every day is 42, so we can set up the equation:
3x + 5y = 42
Now, we are given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. So, the number of white chickens (y) is equal to the number of red chickens (x) plus 2:
y = x + 2
Substituting this equation into the previous one, we get:
3x + 5(x + 2) = 42
Simplifying the equation, we get:
9x + 10 = 42
Solving for x, we get:
x = 18
Therefore, Jerry has 18 red chickens."

Explanation:  When Ram mixes the ink from five pens, he gets 10 ml of ink (since each pen contains 1 ml of ink). Since he has 25 pens, he will be able to create 25 x 10 = 250 ml of ink. This is equivalent to 137 pens, since there are 1 ml of ink per pen. Therefore, Ram will end up with 137 pens after using all the ink from his original 25 pens."

Explanation:
Let X be the total number of students who went out of the building.
From question, we know that 30% of the students went out through exit A, so the number of students who went out through exit A is 30%.
So, the number of students who went out through exit B is (1 - 30%) = 70%.
Now, the number of students who went out through exit C is (1 - 70%) = 29%.
Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 29%.
Hence, the answer is 267."
