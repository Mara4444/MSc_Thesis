Response:  Jennet makes $16 per dollar and sells three items at $50 each. So she earns $3 x 3 = $90 from these sales. Now, let's consider the other two scenarios: (a) Darroj buys all three items at once and pays $20 for them. In this case, he spends $20 / 3 = $6.67 per item. (b) Darroj buys one item every day at $16 per dollar. Then, he spends $16 x 4 = $64 on four items. Therefore, in both cases, Darroj spends less than $90 that Jennet earned from the sales.
"Response:  We have two bolts and we need to find out how many times they can be screwed together. Since each bolt has 36 threads per inch, we can calculate the number of turns required to make one full turn as follows:

1. First bolt: 36 threads/inch x 2 inches = 72 threads
2. Second bolt: 36 threads/inch x 4 inches = 144 threads

Now, since we want to know how many times these bolts can be screwed together, we divide the total number of threads by the number of turns required for one full turn:

Number of turns = Total threads / Number of turns per full turn
= 72 threads / 360 degrees (full turn)
= 2 turns

Therefore, the two bolts can be screwed together 2 times."
Response:  Josh has invested $80,000 in his house and after 5 years, its value increased to $130,000. So, he sold it for $150,000. Now, let's calculate the profit percentage. Profit = Selling price - Purchase price / Purchase price x 100 % = $150,000 - $80,000 / $80,000 x 100% = 75% Therefore, Josh made a profit of 75%.
Response:  James has to make three turns of 60 meters each. So he will cover a total distance of 3 x 60 = 180 meters. Therefore, one turn of James is 180/3 = 60 meters.
Response:  Darroj has three containers with different capacities - 15 cups, 20 cups, and 30 cups. He wants to fill each container with water equally. How many cups of water will he need for this task?  We know that the total capacity of all three containers is 65 cups (15 + 20 + 30 = 65). So, if Darroj fills each container with water equally, he will need 65/3 = 21.67 cups of water in total. Since we can't have a fraction of a cup, let's round up to 22 cups of water needed for this task. Therefore, the answer is 22 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the apartments sold in one day. The cost of each apartment is $500, and there are 16 apartments in total. So, the total cost of all the apartments = $500 x 16 = $8,000. Now, let's find out how much commission the real estate agent will get. Since the price of each apartment is $500, and the commission percentage is 6%, then the commission amount = ($8,000 x 6%) = $480. Therefore, the real estate agent will receive $480 as commission for selling all these 16 apartments in one day.
Response:  We know that Charles has 4 pets (cats) and each cat has 20 teeth. So, in total, Charles has 4 x 20 = 80 teeth.
Response: 1) The speed of downloading Carl's file is 200 MB per minute. 2) It takes 4 minutes to download 80% of the file (Carl's file size is 2 GB). So, in 4 minutes, you will have downloaded 80% of the file = 1600 MB. 3) Now, there are remaining 20% of the file left to be downloaded, which is equal to 400 MB (since the total file size is 2 GB and we have already downloaded 80%). 4) To find out how many minutes it will take to download the remaining 20%, we need to divide the remaining file size by the downloading speed: 400 MB / 200 MB/minute = 2 minutes. Therefore, it will take an additional 2 minutes to complete the download of Carl's file after completing the initial 80%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the distance traveled by John in 1 hour at a speed of 60 mph. Distance = Speed x Time = 60 x 1 = 60 miles. Now, let's assume that he travels for 4 hours at this speed, so his total distance traveled is: Total distance = Distance x Number of hours = 60 x 4 = 240 miles. Next, we need to find out how much time it takes him to cover these 240 miles. We know that the speed of the car is 30 mph, so the time taken to cover 240 miles can be calculated as: Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 30 = 8 hours. Therefore, John covers a distance of 240 miles in 8 hours. Finally, we are asked how far away from home he would be if he travels at a speed of 40 mph for 2 hours. To solve this part of the problem, we need to use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time = 40 x 2 = 80 miles. So, John will be 80 miles away from home if he travels at a speed of 40 mph for 2 hours.
"Response:  We know that Elon Musk earns $40 per hour working at Tesla and SpaceX combined. If he works for 45 hours in a week (which is a reasonable assumption), his total weekly income would be:

$40/hour x 45 hours/week = $1800/week

Now, let's convert this amount to dollars per year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we can multiply the weekly income by 52 to get the annual income:

$1800/week x 52 weeks/year = $93,600/year

So, based on the information provided in the question, Elon Musk's annual income from working at Tesla and SpaceX is approximately $93,600."
Response:  In one month (60 days), there are 30 downloads in total. Now, let's calculate how many downloads occur during each of the three months:  Month 1: 30 downloads x 30 days = 900 downloads  Month 2: 30 downloads x 30 days = 900 downloads  Month 3: 30 downloads x 30 days = 900 downloads So, in total, there are 900 downloads in each of the three months. Therefore, the number of downloads in three months is 900 x 3 = 2700 downloads.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of each type of donut as follows:  For small donuts (3 donuts x $0.68 per donut = $2.04), medium donuts (2 donuts x $0.80 per donut = $1.60), and large donuts (6 donuts x $0.55 per donut = $3.30). Therefore, the total cost of all types of donuts is $6.94 ($2.04 + $1.60 + $3.30).
Response:  The cost of one limb is $90, and there are 7 limbs in total. So, the total cost of all limbs is $630 ($90 x 7). Now, let's calculate how much money they will have after selling the wood. They will get $15 per dollar, so if they sell the wood for $3, they will get $45 ($15 x 3). Therefore, after selling the wood, they will have $675 ($630 + $45) left.
Response:  Melanie has 5 houses to sell and each house takes her 3 weeks to clean before she can list it for sale. If she spends 2 hours every day cleaning one of the houses, how many days will it take her to clean all 5 houses? Solution: Total number of days = Number of houses x Time taken per house / Time spent daily So, total number of days = 5 x 3 weeks / 2 hours/day = 15 weeks or 375 days.
Response:  According to the given data, out of total 20 students, 8 are interested in hip hop dance (25%). Now, among these 8 students, how many are actually good at it? We can assume that only 2 students are excellent (25%) and 4 students are average (50%). So, the number of students who are good at hip hop dance is:  Excellent - 2 Students Average - 4 Students Total - 6 Students Therefore, out of 20 students, 6 students are good at hip hop dance.
Response:  If the businessman has $500,000 in cash and wants to invest it in either stocks or bonds, he will have to decide how much of that amount he wants to allocate to each asset class.  Suppose he decides to invest $300,000 in stocks and $200,000 in bonds.  The expected return from stocks is 8% per annum, while that from bonds is 6% per annum.  After one year, the value of his stock portfolio would be $330,000 (i.e., $300,000 x 1.08), while the value of his bond portfolio would be $216,000 (i.e., $200,000 x 1.06).  So, his total net worth after one year would be $546,000 ($330,000 + $216,000).  However, if he had invested all $500,000 in stocks instead of splitting it between stocks and bonds, his total net worth after one year would be $670,000 ($500,000 x 1.08).  Therefore, by investing only $300,000 in stocks, he misses out on potential returns of around $164,000 ($670,000 - $546,000) over the course of one year.
Response:  We know that both dogs travel together for 80 miles and then separate. One dog goes north and covers another 150 miles, while the other dog goes east and covers the same distance. So, after how many days will they meet again?  Now, let's calculate the time taken by each dog to cover their respective distances. Dog 1 covered 80 miles in 1 day, as it traveled together with the other dog. Therefore, the rate of coverage of dog 1 is 80/1 = 80 miles per day. Similarly, dog 2 covered 150 miles in 2 days, as it traveled alone for 150 - 80 = 70 miles in one day, and then covered the remaining distance of 70 miles in the next day. Therefore, the rate of coverage of dog 2 is 70/2 = 35 miles per day. Now, we need to find out when they will meet again. Since dog 1 covered 80 miles per day, it took it 80/3 = 26.67 days to cover the total distance of 800 miles (80 x 10). Similarly, dog 2 covered 35 miles per day, so it took it 35/4 = 8.75 days to cover the total distance of 1500 miles (150 x 10). Thus, the dogs will meet again after 26.67 + 8.75 = 35.42 days.
Response:  The monthly salary of a teacher is $20 per hour and that of an education counselor is $30 per hour. If a teacher works for 5 hours and an education counselor works for 35 hours in a year, then their total earnings can be calculated as follows:  For a teacher, the annual income = Total working hours x Monthly salary = 5 hours/month x $20/hour = $100/month For an education counselor, the annual income = Total working hours x Monthly salary = 35 hours/month x $30/hour = $1,050/month Therefore, if they work for 5 years, their combined annual income would be: Combined annual income = Teacher's annual income + Education counselor's annual income = $100/month x 60 months (5 years x 12 months/year) + $1,050/month x 60 months = $6,000 + $63,000 = $69,000 So, after 5 years, their combined total earnings would be $69,000.
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are required to fill three baskets of capacity 3/4 th of an amla (dried plum).  Firstly, we need to convert the volume of an amla into a unit that is equivalent to the volume of an apple. Since an amla is roughly spherical in shape and has a diameter of about 1-2 cm, its volume can be estimated as approximately equal to a sphere with a radius of 0.5 cm. Therefore, the volume of one amla = (4/3) \* π \* (0.5)^3 = 0.785 cubic centimeters (cm³). Now, let's calculate the number of apples required to fill three baskets of capacity 3/4 th of an amla: Number of apples = Volume of one amla / Volume of one basket x 3 = 0.785 cm³ / 0.25 cm³ x 3 = 3.15 apples So, it takes approximately 3.15 apples to fill one basket of capacity 3/4 th of an amla.
"Response:  We know that Marisa has 12 mails and she wants to send them in equal batches of 4 mails each. So, we need to find out how many batches can be sent if there is an uneven distribution of mail volume per batch.  If the first batch contains 4 mails and the second batch contains 2 mails less than the first batch, then the average mail volume per batch will be:

Mail Volume per Batch = Total Mail Volume / Number of Batches
= 12 mails x 4/3 = 6.67 mails per batch

Since there are 4 meters in one tase, we can calculate the number of batches required to fill one tase as follows:

Number of Batches for One Tase = Total Mail Volume / Mail Volume per Batch
= 12 mails x 4/3 = 6.67 batches

Therefore, Marisa needs approximately 6.67 batches or 6.67 x 4 = 26.68 meters of airspace to send all her 12 mails."
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice and we want to mix it with 15 liters of water. So, the total volume of liquid is 25 liters (10 + 15). Now, we need to calculate how much water is required to make three parts of orange juice. To do this, we divide the total volume of liquid by 3, which gives us 8.33 liters of water (25 / 3 = 8.33). Therefore, there are 8.33 liters of water in each part of orange juice.
Response:  Remind and Samantha were born in different years. Remind was born in year 23 of Samantha's life. Therefore, if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Remind must have been born 8 years ago (i.e., when Samantha was 23 years old). So, the answer is 8.
Response:  We have 8 guests and each guest has to eat at least one dish. So, total number of dishes required = 8 x 1 = 8. Now, we know that first three guests will eat 3 dishes each, so total number of dishes eaten by them = 3 x 3 = 9. Similarly, next two guests will eat 2 dishes each, so total number of dishes eaten by them = 2 x 2 = 4. Finally, last three guests will eat only 1 dish each, so total number of dishes eaten by them = 3 x 1 = 3. Therefore, total number of dishes left over = Total number of dishes eaten - Total number of dishes required = 9 - 8 = 1.
Response:  The distance between two points is given as $2$ meters. Now, we need to find out how much distance there is between each pair of adjacent points. Since there are $5$ points in total, the distance between any two adjacent points is either $1$ meter or $3$ meters. So, the total distance covered by all the points is: $\therefore$ Distance = $(1 + 3) \times 5 = 8$ meters.
Response:  The book was published in 1950 and its price at that time was $1.95 per copy. If we consider inflation, $1.95 in 1950 is equivalent to around $17.64 in today's money (using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator). So, the current value of the book would be approximately $17.64 x 25 = $438. Therefore, the correct answer is $438.
Response:  We have to find out how many boxes of pizza can be made with $12 and what is the cost per box.  Cost of one large cheese pizza = $12 Dollars. Cost of five small pepperoni packets = $3 x 5 = $15 Dollars. Total cost = $12 + $15 = $27 Dollars. Now we know that Marin has $50 dollars to spend. So, number of boxes of pizza that can be bought = Total cost / Cost per box = $27 / $8.50 = 3.2 boxes of pizza. Therefore, Marin can buy 3.2 boxes of pizza.
Response:  We have three shirts costing $16.50 each, three pants costing $22.50 each, and three jackets costing $42.50 each. So, in total, we have spent: Shirts = 3 x $16.50 = $49.50 Pants = 3 x $22.50 = $67.50 Jackets = 3 x $42.50 = $127.50 Total = $49.50 + $67.50 + $127.50 = $244.50 Therefore, Misak has spent a total of $244.50 on all these clothes.
Response:  Sixty days have passed since Sindhiya started her business. If she sells each carton of 15 pieces at $4 per piece, then total sales in sixty days would be: Total Sales = Number of Cartons x Price per Piece x Number of Days = 15 x $4 x 60 = $900 Now, if she spends $60 per day on expenses, then total amount spent on expenses in sixty days would be: Total Expenses = Daily Expenses x Number of Days = $60 x 60 = $3600 So, after sixty days, Sindhiya will have a profit of: Profit = Total Sales - Total Expenses = $900 - $3600 = -$2700
Response:  We know that there are 60 mails in total and Henny has already sent 20 of them. So, the remaining mails are 40. Now, we need to find out how many mails Henny can send per day. According to the passage, he can send 15 mails per hour. Therefore, the number of mails Henny can send per day is: 40 mails / 15 mails/hour = 2 hours. Hence, Henny can send 2 hours worth of mails per day.
Response:  Gloria has $300 in her wallet and she wants to buy something that costs $150. She also has two options for payment - either paying with one credit card or using both of them. If she pays with one credit card, she will get a discount of $20. So, if she uses only one credit card, she will have to pay $130 ($150 - $20). Now, let's calculate how much money Gloria will have left after making this purchase. If she pays with both credit cards, she will get a discount of $40 ($30 + $10). So, if she uses both credit cards, she will have to pay $90 ($150 - $40). In any case, Gloria will be left with $210 ($300 - $90) after buying the item.
Response:  We know that Darrel and Allen have been friends for 7 years and 11 months. If they are currently 32 years old, then when Allen was born, Darrel was 25 years old. So, the difference between their ages at that time is 7 years (Darrel's age - Allen's age). Therefore, Allen was born 7 years ago.
Response:  If Guantanamo Bay is like a big jar with 80 prisoners inside and each prisoner has an average of 2.5 family members outside, then there are approximately 200 people related to these prisoners inside the jar (80 prisoners x 2.5 family members per prisoner = 200).
"Response:  Each kutrya has its own day (divas) and spends 5 tases (units of time) in that day. So, if there are x kutryas, then each one will spend 5x tase in a day. Now, let's calculate how many days each kutrya will have spent in total. For example, if there are 10 kutryas, then each one will have spent 50 days (5x10=50). Therefore, the number of days each kutrya will have spent is given by:
$$ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of days}}{\text{Number of kutryas}} $$
Substituting the values we get:
$$ \boxed{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{365}{10} = 36.5 \days $$
So, each kutrya will have spent approximately $36.5$ days."
Response:  We know that there are 110 grains in one chandi and 30 more sones in each chandi than grechhenkadi. So, we can write an equation as follows: Grain in Grechhenkadi = Chandi x (Sone/Nane) Now, we have to find out how many sones are present in one nane of grechhenkadi. From the question, we come to know that 1 nane of grechhenkadi contains 30 sones. Therefore, we can rewrite the above equation as: Grain in Grechhenkadi = Chandi x (Sone/Nane) = 110 x (30/30) = 110 x 1 = 110 So, there are 110 grains in one nane of grechhenkadi.
Response:  We know that Siyoban has 2 more days than Eron in work experience. So, if Eron works for 5 days, then Siyoban will work for 7 days (since he has 2 more days). Therefore, Shiban has worked for 40 days ( since he is older than Eron by 2 days).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Maayaa has 40 minutes to cook and she can make 20 portions of pizza in that time. So, each portion takes her 2 minutes to prepare (40/2=2). Now, let's see how much extra ingredients she needs for the second batch of pizzas. We are told that the second batch requires 25% more ingredients than the first batch. Therefore, if the first batch required 4 cups of sauce, then the second batch will require 3 cups of sauce (25% increase is equal to 1 cup). Similarly, if the first batch required 3 cups of cheese, then the second batch will require 4 cups of cheese (25% increase is equal to 1 cup). Finally, we need to calculate the total number of cups of ingredients needed for both batches. For the first batch, it is 4 cups of sauce + 3 cups of cheese = 7 cups. And for the second batch, it is 3 cups of sauce + 4 cups of cheese = 7 cups. So, the total number of cups of ingredients needed is 7 cups.
Response:  We have to calculate how much money Teresa will spend in total for buying 20 eggs at $5 each. So, we need to multiply the number of eggs with their cost per egg:  Number of eggs = 20 eggs Cost per egg = $5/egg Total cost = Number of eggs x Cost per egg = 20 x $5 = $100 Now, we know that Teresa has $40 left after buying the eggs, so we can calculate how many eggs she can buy with her remaining amount as follows: Number of eggs = Total cost / Remaining amount = $100 / $40 = 2.5 eggs Since you cannot buy half an egg, we round up the result to the nearest whole number, which gives us 3 eggs. Therefore, Teresa can buy 3 eggs with her remaining $40.
Response:  We know that there are 13 sets of 8 cards each in a deck of cards. So, the total number of cards in a deck is 13 x 8 = 104 cards. Now, we need to find out how many cards are left after removing 20 dollars worth of games from the deck. To do this, we will divide the total number of cards by the value of the remaining cards (i.e., $20). Therefore, the number of cards left after removing 20 dollars worth of games from the deck is: $$ \frac {104cards} {$20} = 5.2$$ cards. So, there are approximately 5.2 cards left in the deck after removing 20 dollars worth of games.
Response:  John can walk for 60 miles in 3 days. So he walks at an average speed of 20 miles per day. On the first day, he walks for 3 hours and covers 3 miles. Therefore, his average speed during the first day is 3/3 = 1 mile per hour. Now, let's calculate his average speed for the second day: He walked for 5 hours on the second day, so he covered 5 x 20 = 100 miles. His average speed for the second day is therefore 100/5 = 20 miles per hour. Finally, we have to find out how many hours John walked on the third day: Since he walked for 3 days, his total distance covered is 60 miles / 3 = 20 miles per day. So, he walked for 20/3 = 6.67 hours on the third day.
Response:  If Danica can swim at a speed of 3 miles per hour and she is in water that is up to her neck (i.e., 1/2 tube), then she will cover 3 miles in 1 hour.  Now, if she dives deeper into the water and it becomes half as deep again (i.e., from 1/2 tube to 1/4 tube), then she will be able to swim for another 3 hours before reaching the bottom. Therefore, the total time taken by Danica to reach the bottom of the sea will be 6 hours.
Response:  Ben's phone is 3 years old and Suji's phone is 2 years old. So, Ben's phone is older than Suji's phone by 1 year. Therefore, the difference between their phones in years is 1 year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of Mahadragon is 1000 feet and it takes 400 feet to reach its neck from its body. Now, let's calculate how much distance Sonia has to cover to reach Dragon's neck. As she runs at a speed of 30 km/h, it will take her 40 minutes to cover this distance. So, in total, Sonia needs to run for 80 minutes (40 minutes x 2) to reach Dragon's neck. Now, if we consider the height of Dragon's neck as 400 feet, then Sonia will have to climb 400 feet in addition to the distance she ran to reach the neck. Therefore, the total distance Sonia needs to climb is 400 + 80 = 480 feet.
Response:  Daadi Jonas gave Agnishaman Dalal 5 Safed Petha candies and asked him to share them equally among his 8 friends. Each friend got 2 Safed Petha candies. Now, if we calculate how many Safed Petha candies each of Agnishaman's friends got, we get:  Friend 1 got 2 Safed Petha candies, so he got 2 x 2 = 4 Safed Petha candies in total.  Similarly, Friend 2 got 2 Safed Petha candies, so he got 2 x 2 = 4 Safed Petha candies in total. And so on... So, altogether, Agnishaman's 8 friends got 8 x 4 = 32 Safed Petha candies.
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of rice can be obtained from 250 calories and then calculate how much percentage of that amount is left after consuming 300 grams of rice.  So, firstly we need to convert 250 calories into grams of rice. According to the nutrition information provided in the question, 1 calorie = 4.1867 grams of rice. Therefore, 250 calories = 1043.9 grams of rice (250 x 4.1867). Now, let's assume you consume 300 grams of rice. To find out what percentage of the total amount remains, we need to subtract the consumed amount from the total amount and divide it by the total amount. So, the remaining amount = Total amount - Consumed amount / Total amount = 1043.9 - 300 / 1043.9 = 643.0 grams (approximately)
Response:  If each pound of Madhumakhi mushrooms contains 10 spores and each spore costs $10, then the total cost of one pound of Madhumakhi mushrooms is $10 x 10 = $100. Now, if we have 20 pounds of Madhumakhi mushrooms, the total cost would be $100 x 20 = $2000. So, the profit per kilogram of Madhumakhi mushrooms would be $2000 / 20 kg = $100 per kg.
Response:  Meredith is a free lancer blogger who writes about various topics and earns $40 per post. She spends 4 hours on each post and has 3 days of work in a week. Therefore, her total income per week is: $40 x 3 = $120 per week Now, let's calculate her hourly wage: $120 / 4 = $30 per hour So, Meredith works for 4 hours a day, which means she works for 28 hours in a week (7 days x 4 hours). Therefore, her total income per month is: $120 x 4 weeks = $480 per month
Response:  Kanchi has posted 80 posts and each post contains 5 notes. So, in total, she has posted 80 x 5 = 400 notes. Now, out of these 400 notes, 23 are missing. Therefore, the remaining number of notes that Kanchi has posted is 400 - 23 = 377 notes.
Response:  John has $200 to spend and he wants to buy something that costs at least $50. So, he can buy something that costs up to $150 ($200 - $50 = $150). Now, let's calculate how much percentage of his budget he is left with after buying something that costs $150: (($150 / $200) x 100%) = 75%. This means that he has $75 left in his budget after buying something that costs $150.
Response:  We know that the diameter of the tomato is 4 feet and the height of the tree is 6 inches. So, we can calculate the volume of the tree as follows: Volume = π x (diameter/2)^2 x height = π x (4/2)^2 x 6 = approximately 37.8 cubic feet. Now, let's convert this volume to tukda (a unit of measurement used in Maharashtra). One tukda is equal to 100 grams. So, we can calculate the number of tukdas required to fill the tree as follows: Number of tukdas = volume in tukdas = 37.8 cubic feet x 100 grams/cubic foot = approximately 3780 grams or 3.78 kilograms. Therefore, there are approximately 3.78 kilograms of tukdas required to fill the tree.
Response:  We know that Richard has 15 apartments and each apartment has 8 units. So, the total number of units in all the apartments is 15 x 8 = 120 units. Now, we are asked how many units are vacant or unoccupied. Since 3/4 of the apartments are occupied, the number of vacant units can be calculated as follows:  Number of vacant units = Total number of units - Occupied units = 120 - (3/4) x 120 = 60 units Therefore, there are 60 vacant units in Richard's apartments.
Response: 252 pounds is equal to how many kilograms? 1 pound = 0.453592 kilograms So, 252 pounds = 252 x 0.453592 = 114.76 kilograms Now, if we convert 114.76 kilograms to dollars, we get $114.76 / $1 = $114.76 per dollar. Therefore, the number of dollars that can be obtained from 114.76 kilograms of gold is $114.76.
Response:  We know that Tom can carry 10 bags of sand ( each bag contains 5 kg) in his boat. So, total weight he can carry = Number of bags x Weight per bag = 10 x 5 = 50 kg. Now, we need to calculate how many times he can cross the sea with this weight. To do this, we divide the total weight by the weight of one crossing = Total weight / Weight per crossing = 50 kg / 4 kg = 12.5 crossings. Therefore, Tom can make 12.5 crossings of the sea with the given weight.
Response:  Urvashi has written 15 comics and each comic has 4 pages, so in total she has written 60 pages of content (15 x 4 = 60). Now, let's calculate how much time it would take to read all those pages at an average reading speed of 1 page per minute. Time taken to read all 60 pages = Total time spent reading all 15 comics x Reading speed per comic Total time spent reading all 15 comics = 30 minutes (as mentioned in the question) Reading speed per comic = 1/4 page per minute (since there are 4 pages in each comic) So, the time taken to read all 60 pages is: 30 minutes x 4 pages/comic = 120 minutes or 2 hours. Therefore, if Urvashi wrote 30 comics with each containing 4 pages of content, then it would take her approximately 2 hours to write them all.

The second child has 17 lollipops (15 original + 2 extra).
Response:  Peter has $70 in his wallet and he wants to buy tickets for a movie that costs $14 each. He also has $7 in change. So, he can buy 2 tickets ($14 x 2 = $28). Now, he has $42 left after buying the tickets.
Response:  We have a rectangular box with dimensions of length = 5000 mm, width = 2000 mm, and height = 1500 mm. The volume of this box is given as 3755 cubic meters. Now, we need to find out how many truck loads of sand can be carried in this box. To do this, we will divide the total volume of the box by the volume of one truck load of sand, which is assumed to be 15 cubic feet or 426 liters. So, the number of truck loads of sand that can be carried in the box is: Number of truckloads = Total volume of box / Volume of one truckload = 3755 cubic meters / 426 liters = approximately 89 truckloads
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve has invested $40,000 in Deliveroo and he wants to withdraw $30,000 from his investment. So, the amount left after withdrawal is $10,000 ($40,000 - $30,000). Now, we need to calculate the percentage of commission charged by Deliveroo on the remaining amount. According to the question, Deliveroo charges 25% commission on the remaining amount. Therefore, the total amount paid to Deliveroo as commission is $2,500 (25% of $10,000). Now, let's find out how much money Steve will have after paying the commission. The total amount Steve will have after paying the commission is $7,500 ($10,000 - $2,500). Finally, we can see that Steve will have $7,500 after paying the commission.
Response:  We have to find out how many Rasberry plants can be grown in an area of 20 feet by 30 feet (60 square feet). To do this, we need to divide the total area by the size of each plant. The size of each Raspberry plant is approximately 6 feet x 6 feet = 36 square feet. So, we can grow 60 / 36 = 1.75 Raspberry plants in that area. Therefore, there are approximately 1 and ¾ Raspberry plants in that area.
Response:  We have 25 balls in total and 1 is defective (bad). So, there are 24 good balls. Out of these 24 good balls, 20 are perfect (no imperfections) and 4 have minor imperfections (urvarit). Therefore, the number of balls with major imperfections (kharaab) is 4/20 = 0.2 or 20%. Now, we need to find out how many balls have major imperfections. Since 20% of the good balls have major imperfections, the number of balls with major imperfections is 20% of 24 = 4.8. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a ball, the nearest integer is 5. So, there are 5 balls with major imperfections.
Response:  Jenny has $100 to invest and wants to make at least $500 in profit. She invests it in brashes that give her an average return of 20%. After one year, she makes $800 in total profits. So, she earned $700 ($800 - $100) in profit.
Response:  The company has been in business for 40 years and has an average annual salary of $50,000. If we assume that the employee's salary increases at a rate of 5% per year, then after 20 years, their salary will be $75,000 (5% of $150,000). After another 10 years, it will be $97,500 ($75,000 x 1.05^10). So, after 30 years, the employee's salary will be $97,500.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Alena earned from her streaming service in one year. According to the question, she earned $140 per hour and worked for 5 hours every day. Therefore, her daily income is $140 x 5 = $700 per day. Now, let's calculate her annual income. Since she works for 365 days in a year, her annual income is $700 x 365 = $255,500 per year. Next, we need to find out how much of this income was spent on expenses related to her streaming service. As per the question, 10% of her annual income goes towards expenses related to her streaming service. Therefore, the amount spent on expenses is $255,500 x 10% = $25,550 per year. Finally, we need to subtract the amount spent on expenses from her annual income to get her net profit. Net profit = Annual income - Expenses = $255,500 - $25,550 = $230,950 per year.

Response:  There are four teams in total, and each team has five players. So, there are 4 x 5 = 20 players in total. Now, let's assume that all the players can play all the positions equally well, which means they have equal skills at every position. In this case, we can say that each player has an equal chance of playing any position, including goalkeeper. Therefore, the probability of any particular player playing a specific position (e.g., goalkeeper) is 1/20, or approximately 0.05.
Response:  We have to find out how many coins of each type are needed to make a total amount of Rs. 175 with a minimum of 35 coins of one denomination and maximum of 40 coins of another denomination.  So, we can start by finding the number of coins of each denomination that will give us a total of Rs. 175:  For 1 rupee coin:  To get Rs. 175 with at least 35 coins, we need:  Coins = (Rs. 175 / Re. 1) = 175  So, we need 175 coins of this denomination.  For 2 rupees coin:  Now, let's see how many coins of this denomination we can use to reach our target:  Coins = (Rs. 175 / Re. 2) = 87.5  Since we cannot have a fraction of a coin, we round up to the nearest integer:  Coins = 90  So, we need 90 coins of this denomination.  Total number of coins required:  Now, let's add the number of coins of each denomination:  Total coins = 175 + 90 = 265  Therefore, there are 265 coins in total.
Response:  We have to compare the number of teachers and students in each school.  If we assume that there are 60 teachers in School A and 5 students in each class, then we can calculate the total number of teachers as follows:  Number of Teachers = Total number of classes x Number of teachers per class = 6 x 6 = 36 So, there are 36 teachers in School A. Now, let's move on to School B. If we assume that there are 50 teachers in School B and 4 students in each class, then we can calculate the total number of teachers as follows: Number of Teachers = Total number of classes x Number of teachers per class = 4 x 4 = 16 So, there are 16 teachers in School B. Therefore, there are more teachers (36) than students (16) in School A, while there are more students (48) than teachers (16) in School B.
Response:  Beli makes $50 per week working for 8 hours a day. That means she earns $200 per week ($50 x 8 hours/day). Now, let's calculate how much money Beli has earned in total over the past 7 months. She has worked for 7 x 4 weeks = 28 weeks. So, her total earnings are: Total Earnings = Number of Weeks Worked x Weekly Earnings = 28 weeks x $200/week = $5,600.
Response:  There are 5 categories of students and each category has 15 students. So, in total, there are 75 students (5 x 15 = 75). Now, let's assume that each student earns $15 per day. Therefore, the total amount earned by all the students in one week is: Total amount earned = Number of students x Daily earning per student x Number of days = 75 students x $15/day x 7 days = $1,050 ($15 x 7 = $105 per day x 7 days) So, the student who works for 8 hours a day earns $840 per week ($105 x 8 = $840).

Response:  Shilpa earns $150 per month in each of the three months. Since she has to pay $2 for every unit of electricity used, her total electricity cost is: Electricity Cost = Total Electricity Used x Price Per Unit = 3 Months x 150 Days x $2/Unit = $1800 So, Shilpa spends $1800 on electricity in three months.
Response:  We have three types of farmers - Maharashtrian, Punjabi and Bengali. The price per bale for each type is $2.74, $1.87, and $2.12 respectively. If Artie sells all his bales today at these prices, he will make a total profit of $356. However, since Artie has 12 bales of Maharashtrian cotton, 9 bales of Punjabi cotton, and 17 bales of Bengali cotton, if he sells them all together, he will make a total profit of $504. So, Artie can make an additional $148 by selling all his bales together.
Response:  We have to find out how many feet are there in each layer of killer whales and then add them up to get the total number of feet.  There are 4 layers of killer whales, and each layer has 16 feet. So, the total number of feet in all four layers is 4 x 16 = 64 feet. Now, we need to find out how many feet are there in one layer of killer whales. Since there are 4 layers, if we divide 64 feet by 4, we get 16 feet per layer. Therefore, there are 16 feet in each layer of killer whales.
"Response:  Firstly, Sesilie has 180 days in a year and she can make 12 pills per day. So, total number of pills made by Sesilie in one year is:

180 days x 12 pills/day = 2160 pills/year

Now, let's consider how many pills are left after Urvashi takes over. As per the question, Urvashi takes over after 18 years, so total number of pills made by Sesilie during those 18 years is:

2160 pills/year x 18 years = 39440 pills

After Urvashi takes over, she makes 2 kup of pills per day, which means she will make:

39440 pills / 2 kup/day = 19720 pills/day

So, total number of pills made by Urvashi in one year is:

19720 pills/day x 365 days (in a year) = 699520 pills/year

Now, we need to find out how many pills are left after Urvashi takes over. Total number of pills made by Sesilie before taking over is:

2160 pills/year - 699520 pills/year = -697260 pills/year

Therefore, there are -697260 pills less after Urvashi takes over."

Response:  We have to find out how much water Jerry can carry in his bucket after he has filled it with 380 liters of water from the well and then emptied it partially. So, we need to calculate the volume of water that Jerry can carry in his bucket after emptying it partially. To do this, we will use the formula for finding the capacity of a container (in this case, Jerry's bucket): Capacity = Volume of water + Empty space The volume of water that Jerry can carry in his bucket is equal to the total volume of water that he had in the bucket minus the volume of water that he poured out. Therefore, if Jerry initially had 400 liters of water in his bucket and poured out 100 liters of water, the volume of water that he can carry in his bucket now would be: Capacity = 400 - 100 = 300 liters So, Jerry can carry 300 liters of water in his bucket after emptying it partially.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes can be made from 60 pieces of leather.  Since each pair of shoes requires two pieces of leather (one for the upper and one for the sole), we need to divide 60 by 2 to get the number of pairs of shoes that can be made. So, there are 30 pairs of shoes that can be made from 60 pieces of leather.

So, there are 54 trunks in total."
Response:  Jerome has four friends and each friend gets half of his luggage. So, if Jerome had 20 bags of luggage initially, he would have given 10 bags to each of his three friends. Now, let's calculate how many bags each friend got from Jerome. For the first friend, since he got half of Jerome's luggage, he got 10/2 = 5 bags. Similarly, for the second friend, he got half of what was left after giving 5 bags to the first friend, i.e., (10 - 5) / 2 = 3 bags. And for the third friend, he got half of what was left after giving 3 bags to the second friend, i.e., (10 - 3 - 3) / 2 = 6 bags. Therefore, the total number of bags that Jerome gave away is 5 + 3 + 6 = 14 bags.
Response:  We are given that Solole has studied for 15 days and completed all his subjects. He has studied science for 4 hours per day, social studies for 20 hours per day, history for 7 hours per day, and geography for 8 hours per day. Therefore, in total, he has studied for 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 hours. Now, we are asked how many days it would take him to study all these subjects completely if he studies for 4 hours every day. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of hours he needs to study by the number of hours he studies every day. So, 49 hours / 4 hours/day = 12 days. Hence, Solole will require 12 days to complete all his subjects completely.

Now, let's calculate how many episodes of 30 minutes each can fit into 70 minutes. We know that each episode is 30 minutes long, so we need to divide 70 by 30 to find out how many episodes can fit in that time frame.  Therefore, there will be 2.33 episodes (70/30 = 2.33) of 30 minutes each that can fit into 70 minutes on Buddhavarshi's show.
Response:  According to the given information, Henny has 15 more biscuits than Bicky. So, Henny has 15 + 5 = 20 biscuits in total. Now, we need to find out how many biscuits Bicky had initially. Since Bicky gave 110 biscuits, and he had 5 biscuits less than Henny, so Bicky had 110 - 5 = 105 biscuits initially. Therefore, the difference between the number of biscuits Henny and Bicky had is 20 - 105 = -85 biscuits.
Response:  We know that the station has 3 gas pumps and each pump can sell up to 10 gallons of gas per day. So, the total number of gallons sold at the station in one day is :  Gas Pumps = 3 Gallons Sold/Day = 3 x 10 = 30 gallons/day Now, let's calculate how much money the company will make from selling gas at this rate: Money Made = Number of Gallons Sold x Price Per Gallon = 30 gallons/day x $2.50/gallon = $75/day This means that if the company sells 10 gallons of gas per day, it will make $7.50 in revenue.
Response:  Mars and Venus are planets that revolve around the Sun in different orbits. Mars takes about 687 Earth days to complete one orbit, while Venus takes about 225 Earth days. Therefore, if we compare their distances from the Sun, Mars is farther away than Venus. Specifically, Mars is about 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) away from the Sun, while Venus is about 108 million miles (174 million kilometers) away. So, based on these calculations, Mars is farther away from the Sun than Venus.
Response:  Julie can carry 20 liters of water in one trip. Since she has to go back and forth between two points, let's assume it takes her 16 seconds to cover each distance. Therefore, the total time taken for Julie to complete one round is: Time = Distance / Speed = 64 meters / 16 seconds = 4 seconds per round Now, since Julie needs to make 5 rounds to fill up the tank, the total time required for her to fill up the tank is: Total Time = Number of Rounds x Time per Round = 5 x 4 seconds = 20 seconds Hence, Julie will take 20 seconds to fill up the tank with 20 liters of water.
Response:  We have four teachers and each teacher has two students. So, in total we have 8 students. Now, if we give three whiteboards to each group of two students, then each student will get one whiteboard. Therefore, the number of whiteboards required is 4 x 2 = 8. Since there are 8 whiteboards available, each student will get one whiteboard per day.
Response:  We are given that Rohan has 2 bags of rice and he needs to distribute them among 15 days. Since each bag contains 50 kg of rice, we can calculate the total amount of rice needed for each day as follows: Total amount of rice required = Number of days x Amount of rice in each bag So, the total amount of rice needed is: 2 bags x 50 kg/bag = 100 kg (for 15 days) Now, since Rohan only has 2 bags of rice, he cannot provide enough rice for all 15 days. Therefore, the correct answer is: There will be no rice left after 13 days.
"Response:  Jamal's phone has 50 photos of Britney Spears. Each photo is worth $180. So, the total value of all the photos in Jamal's phone is:

Response:  We have to find out how many boards of size 2x4 can be cut from a sheet of plywood that measures 8 feet long and 4 feet wide. To do this, we need to divide the length and width of the sheet into smaller parts. Length = 8 ft = 96 in = 3 \* 32 in = 128 in Width = 4 ft = 48 in = 2 \* 24 in = 48 in Now, we need to calculate the number of boards that can be cut from each part. For example, if we take one part of length 32 inches (length of the sheet), then we can cut 4 boards of size 2x4, as follows: Board size = 2x4 in = 24 in x 48 in = 1152 sq in Total area of one board = 1152 sq in / 24 in = 47 sq in Therefore, we can cut 4 boards from each part of length 32 inches. Similarly, if we take one part of width 24 inches (width of the sheet), then we can cut 4 boards of size 2x4, as follows: Board size = 2x4 in = 24 in x 48 in = 1152 sq in Total area of one board = 1152 sq in / 24 in = 47 sq in Therefore, we can cut 4 boards from each part of width 24 inches. Now, let's count the total number of boards that we can cut from the entire sheet: Number of parts of length = 8 ft / 32 in = 26 Parts of length Number of boards from each part = 4 boards per part = 26 x 4 = 104 boards From the entire sheet, we can cut 104 boards of size 2x4. Since each board costs $16, the total cost of all the boards is: Total cost = 104 boards x $16 per board = $1624 So, the answer is $1624.
Response:  If there are 120 cups of water and 75 ml of coffee in each cup, then the total number of ml of coffee = 120 x 75 = 9000 ml. Therefore, the number of cups of coffee = 9000 / 75 = 120 cups.

Response:  We know that there are 30 vehicles in total and they are distributed among 5 containers as follows:  On Monday, each container had 6 vehicles, and on Tuesday, each container had 7 vehicles. So, the number of vehicles in each container on Tuesday is:  Number of vehicles in each container = Total number of vehicles / Number of days (Tuesday) = 30 / 1 = 30. Therefore, there are 30 vehicles in each container on Tuesday.
Response:  Edrian earns $30 per hour and works for 40 hours in a week. His annual salary is therefore $30 x 40 x 52 = $64,800. Now, over four years, his salary increases by 40%, which means he earns $64,800 x 1.4 = $91,760 after four years. So, the difference between his initial and final salaries is $91,760 - $64,800 = $26,960.
Response:  We have two papers with 30 pages each. So, in total, we have 60 pages of paper. Now, let's assume that one page takes up 1 square centimeter (cm²) of space. Therefore, the area of one page is equal to 1 cm². Since there are 60 pages in total, the area of all the pages together is equal to 60 x 1 = 60 cm².
Response:  Moriset has 5 safaris and Kael has 8 sanctuaries. If we divide the number of safaris by the number of sanctuaries, we get 5/8 = 0.625. So, there are approximately 62.5% of safaris in each sanctuary.
"Response:  Sedine consumes 8 tonnes of coal per day. If it reduces its consumption by half for two days (i.e., 40% reduction), then it will consume 5.6 tonnes of coal per day. Now, let's calculate how much coal Sedine will save in total if it continues to reduce its consumption by half every two days.

For the first two days, Sedine saves 2 tonnes of coal (half of 4 tonnes). So, after these two days, Sedine has saved a total of 2 + 2 = 4 tonnes of coal.

Now, let's assume that Sedine continues to reduce its consumption by half every two days. After four days, Sedine will have reduced its consumption by half again, so it will save an additional 2 tonnes of coal (half of 4 tonnes). Therefore, the total amount of coal saved by Sedine after eight days is 4 + 2 = 6 tonnes."
Response:  We know that 10 mails weigh 3 tonnes. So, in one day, 10 mails will weigh 3 x 24 = 72 tonnes. Therefore, the number of mails that can be carried per day is 72 tonnes / 8 km = approximately 9 mails per day.
Response:  Jenny has 60 cards and each card has 30 letters. So, in total, she has 60 x 30 = 1800 letters. Now, if we take away 30% of these letters (which is equal to 540 letters), then we are left with 1800 - 540 = 1260 letters. Therefore, there are 1260 letters in the remaining 30 cards.
Response:  Julie has 5 new packets of chocolates that she wants to give as gifts. She has already given one packet to her husband and needs to distribute the remaining four packets among her friends. Since each packet contains 12 pieces of chocolate, Julie will have to divide the remaining 4 packets equally among her 4 friends, giving each friend 3 packets (i.e., 4 x 3 = 12). Therefore, the number of chocolate packets that Julie will give to her friends is 12.
Response:  The company has 38 compartments and each compartment can accommodate 6 passengers. So, in total, there are 38 x 6 = 228 passengers who can travel in one train. Now, if we assume that the company operates 38 trains per day, then the total number of passengers who can travel per day is 228 x 38 = 8,544 passengers per day.
Response:  Navin has 20 more friends than Emine. So, Emine has 50 friends in total. Now, out of these 50 friends, 30 are male and 20 are female. Therefore, Emine has 10 male friends who are not Lilie's friends.
Response:  We have to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up to find out how much it costs in total.  The cost of one Tarbuj is Rs. 300, Mirchi is Rs. 200, and Santri is Rs. 150. So, the total cost of these three items would be:  Tarbuj - Rs. 300 x 3 = Rs. 900 Mirchi - Rs. 200 x 3 = Rs. 600 Santri - Rs. 150 x 3 = Rs. 450 Total Cost = Rs. 900 + Rs. 600 + Rs. 450 = Rs. 1950 Now, we need to subtract the discount given (5% of Rs. 1950) which is: Discount = Rs. 1950 x 5/100 = Rs. 97.5 So, the final price that Delilah has to pay for all these items is: Final Price = Rs. 1950 - Rs. 97.5 = Rs. 1852.5
"Response:  The doctor earns $150 per hour and works for 24 minutes in each patient. So, the total amount earned by the doctor is:
$150/hour x 24 minutes = $3600 per day

Response:  Pam and Fred have 2 rolls each, so they have in total 4 rolls (2 + 2). Since there are 6 tickets per roll, the total number of tickets they have is 4 x 6 = 24 tickets. Now, if each person buys 5 tickets, then Pam has bought 5 x 2 = 10 tickets and Fred has bought 5 x 4 = 20 tickets. So, the difference between the number of tickets bought by Pam and Fred is 20 - 10 = 10 tickets. Therefore, the answer is 10 tickets.
Response:  Somvarie (Sunday) has 4 meals and Mangalwarie (Monday) has 3 meals. So, total number of meals in one week is:  Sunday - 4 Monday - 3 = 7 meals per week. Now, let's calculate how many meals are left after 41 days:  Total number of meals in 41 days = 7 x 41 = 287 meals. Therefore, Budhavarine (Tuesday) will have 287 meals.
Response:  Tom has 4 cars and each car costs $15000. So, in total, he has spent $60,000 on buying those cars (4 x $15000). Now, if we assume that he sells one of his cars every year, then he will have earned $15000 from selling each car ($60000 / 4 = $15000 per year). Therefore, after one year, he will have earned $15000 x 4 = $60,000.
Response:  Brainly has 20 video games and Bobike has 5 video games. So, if we compare them, Brainly has 4 times as many video games as Bobike. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that there are 27 UNICORNS in the picture.  Each unicorn has three horns, so we have 3 x 27 = 81 horns in total. Now, let's count how many of these horns belong to the two cats. One cat is sitting on top of one of the horns, and the other cat is sitting next to it. So, out of the 81 horns, two cats own 2 horns. Therefore, there are 81 - 2 = 79 horns left for the rest of the unicorns.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Rorine can get from each source and then calculate the total amount of money she will receive.  Source 1: Roxinne will get $750 from each sandwich sale. Since she sold 2 sandwiches, she got $1500 from this source. Source 2: For every pizza chip sold, Roxinne will get $1.50. She sold 3 bags of chips, so she earned $4.50 from this source. Source 3: For every cookie sold, Roxinne will get $1.00. She sold 5 cookies, so she earned $5.00 from this source. Total amount of money Roxinne received = $1500 + $4.50 + $5.00 = $1609.50
Response:  We know that in the first examination, 75 questions were asked and each question carried 5 marks. So, the total marks for the first examination were 75 x 5 = 375 marks. Now, we are told that out of these 375 marks, 80 marks were awarded for the first part of the examination (which had 80 questions) and 60 marks were awarded for the second part of the examination (which had 60 questions). Therefore, the total marks obtained by the student in the first examination would be 80 + 60 = 140 marks.  Similarly, in the second examination, 100 questions were asked and each question carried 5 marks. So, the total marks for the second examination were 100 x 5 = 500 marks. Out of these 500 marks, 80 marks were awarded for the first part of the examination (which had 80 questions) and 60 marks were awarded for the second part of the examination (which had 60 questions). Therefore, the total marks obtained by the student in the second examination would be 80 + 60 = 140 marks. However, as per the question, the student scored only 120 marks in the second examination. Therefore, the number of questions that the student did not attempt is 140 - 120 = 20.
Response:  We have 22 gond balls in total and we need to divide them equally among 4 pots. So, each pot will get 5 gond balls (22 / 4 = 5). Now, let's assume that there are 3 gulabis in each pot. So, the number of gulabis in each pot is 3 x 5 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 gulabis in total.
Response:  We have 20 cars available for rent and we need to distribute them among 4 manual car drivers and 12 automatic car drivers. Since there are more manual car drivers than automatic car drivers, we will give priority to them. So, we will allocate 8 manual cars (4 x 2) and 6 automatic cars (12 / 2 = 6). Therefore, 8 manual cars are arthritic.
"Response:  We know that there are 700 workers in total and they work for 8 hours a day. So, the total number of working days in a month is:

700 workers x 8 hours/day = 5600 hours/month (approximately)
Now, we need to calculate the number of workers who work during peak hours. According to the question, out of these 5600 hours, 3200 hours are worked during peak hours. Therefore, the number of workers who work during peak hours is:

3200 hours / 5600 hours = 0.59 (or approximately 1/1.8)
So, about 59% of the total number of workers work during peak hours."
"Response:  Jordan Darroch has 20 videos with an average view count of 10 dollars per video. If he works for 8 hours a day and makes $10 per hour, then his daily earnings are:
$10/hour x 8 hours/day = $80/day
Now, let's calculate how much money Jordan can make in a month:
$80/day x 30 days/month = $2400/month
So, if Jordan continues to work at this rate, he can potentially make around $2400 per month from his YouTube channel."
"Response:  John has $20, Andy has $30, David has $30, Divya has $30, and Komal has $40. If they all equally share their money among themselves, each person will get $\frac{10}{5} \times 20 = 40$ dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money that each person will have after sharing is:

John: $20 + ($20 x $\frac{10}{5}$) = $20 + $8 = $28
Andy: $30 + ($30 x $\frac{10}{5}$) = $30 + $15 = $45
David: $30 + ($30 x $\frac{10}{5}$) = $30 + $15 = $45
Divya: $30 + ($30 x $\frac{10}{5}$) = $30 + $15 = $45
Komal: $40 + ($40 x $\frac{10}{5}$) = $40 + $20 = $60"
Response:  We have three customers who buy two blouses each at $20 and one pair of pants at $50. So their total cost is $2 x 2 = $40 + $50 = $90. Now we need to calculate how much they will pay for each item. Since there are five items in total, each customer will pay half of the total cost, which is $90 / 5 = $18 per item. Therefore, each customer will pay $18 for each blouse and $18 for each pair of pants.
Response:  John has 10 hectares of land and he can plough 3 months in a year. So, he can plough 3 x 3 = 9 hectares per year. Now, let's calculate how many acres he can cultivate in one year. There are 2.47 acres in one hectare, so 9 hectares is equal to 9 x 2.47 = 22.63 acres. Therefore, John can cultivate approximately 22.63 acres of land in one year.
Response:  We have two boxes of different sizes - one with 500 small balls and another with 500 large balls. If we take out 3 small balls from the first box and add them to the second box, how many balls will be left in each box? In the first box, there will be 497 small balls left (since we took out 3), and in the second box, there will be 497 + 3 = 500 large balls left. Now, let's consider John's bag. He has 500 small balls in his bag, which means he has taken out 500 / 4 = 125 small balls from the big box. So, if he puts all these small balls back into the big box, it will have 500 - 125 = 375 small balls left. And if he takes out 3 more small balls from the big box to give to Sarah, then the remaining number of small balls in the big box will be 375 - 3 = 372.
Response:  Debra has 30 madhamashyas (mothers-in-law) and each of them has 6 children. So, in total, Debra has 30 x 6 = 180 grandchildren. Now, let's calculate how many of these grandchildren are from each mother-in-law. Since there are 30 mothers-in-law, each one will have 6/30 = 2 grandchildren. Therefore, Debra has 180 / 30 = 6 grandchildren from each mother-in-law.

Charles has 12/30 = 0.4 friends per Facebook account."
Response:  Steve and Tim are walking towards each other at a speed of 5 km/h. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is 10 km/h (5 km/h + 5 km/h). Now, we need to find out how much time it takes for them to meet each other. We know that Steve covers 3 miles in 1 minute, so his distance covered per minute is 3 x 60 = 180 feet. Similarly, Tim covers 2 miles in 1 minute, so his distance covered per minute is 2 x 60 = 120 feet. Therefore, the time taken for Steve and Tim to meet each other can be calculated as follows: Time = Distance / Speed = 180 feet / 10 km/h = 18 seconds Time = 120 feet / 10 km/h = 12 seconds However, since they are moving in opposite directions, the actual time taken for them to meet will be half of these values, i.e., 9 seconds. So, the correct answer is 9 seconds.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the cost of each tire. As per the given information, the cost of one tire is $25 and there are 25 tires in total. Therefore, the total cost of all tires is:

$25 x 25 = $625

Now, we need to find out how many dollars each person has spent on tires. There are 10 people in total, and each person has bought 5 tires. So, the total number of tires purchased by each person is:

5 x 10 = 50 tires

The cost of each tire is $25, so the total amount spent by each person on tires is:

$25 x 50 = $1,250

Finally, we need to find out how much money each woman has saved by buying tires from that particular store. As per the question, each woman has saved $375 by buying tires from that store. Therefore, the answer is:

$1,250 - $375 = $875"
"Response:  We have to calculate how many notes of $1 each Carl can buy with $10.  Since each note is worth $0.10, we need to divide $10 by $0.10 to get the number of notes that Carl can buy:

$10 / $0.10 = 100 notes

So, Carl can buy 100 notes with $10."
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many French fries Devhan can eat in one sitting. As per the question, he can eat three French fries at once and then he will feel full. So, the number of French fries Devhan can eat in one sitting is 3.  Next, we need to calculate how many times Devhan can eat French fries in a day if he eats three French fries at once and feels full after each meal. Therefore, the number of times Devhan can eat French fries in a day is 3 x 24 = 72.  Now, let's assume that Devhan wants to know how many French fries he can eat in total in a week. To do this, we need to multiply the number of times he can eat French fries in a day by seven (as there are seven days in a week). Therefore, the total number of French fries Devhan can eat in a week is 72 x 7 = 496.
Response:  We know that there are three days in a week - Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. So, if we have to calculate how many times a particular day falls in a semester of 16 weeks, we need to divide the number of days of that day in a week by 16. For example, if it is Monday, then it will fall 4 times in a semester (Monday has 7 days in a week). Similarly, if it is Tuesday, it will fall 5 times in a semester (Tuesday also has 7 days in a week). Now let's apply this logic for Thursday. Thursday has 8 days in a week, so it will fall 8/16 = 0.5 times in a semester. Therefore, Thursday falls once in a semester of 16 weeks.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice, chocolates, and rolls are needed to fill up all the boxes.  Each box can hold 4 rolls, 6 croissants, or 2 bags of rice. So, we need to divide the total number of rolls, croissants, and bags of rice by the capacity of each box.  The total number of rolls is 300, the total number of croissants is 120, and the total number of bags of rice is 60. To calculate the number of boxes required for each item, we can use the following formulas: Number of rolls per box = 4 Number of croissants per box = 6 Number of bags of rice per box = 2 Now, let's substitute these values into the formula for each item: Number of rolls = 300 / 4 = 75 Number of croissants = 120 / 6 = 20 Number of bags of rice = 60 / 2 = 30 Since there are 75 rolls, 20 croissants, and 30 bags of rice in total, we can now determine how many boxes are required for each item: Number of rolls per box = 75 / 4 = 18.75 boxes Number of croissants per box = 20 / 6 = 3.33 boxes Number of bags of rice per box = 30 / 2 = 15 boxes Therefore, we will require 18.75 boxes for rolls, 3.33 boxes for croissants, and 15 boxes for bags of rice.
Response:  The total number of ants in the ant hill is 2000. Each ant can carry food grains equal to its own body weight, which is approximately 5-6 grams. So, the total amount of food carried by all ants together would be: 2000 x 5 = 10,000 grams. Now, let's calculate how much each ant carries per day: 10,000 grams / 30 days = 333 grams per day. Therefore, each ant carries approximately 333 grams of food per day.
Response:  Black and White are playing football in a field with dimensions of 100 yards long and 53 yards wide. The ball is kicked to Black who has 15 minutes left for the game. They have scored 4 goals so far. In this situation, what would be the best decision for Black to make? Option A - Take a shot at goal from distance Option B - Pass the ball to a teammate closer to the goal Option C - Try to dribble past one or more opponents to create space Option D - Foul an opponent to stop their attack  Based on the information provided, option (C) Try to dribble past one or more opponents to create space seems like the most likely option for Black to choose, as they only have 15 minutes left in the game and need to create scoring opportunities quickly. Therefore, I would score option (C) Try to dribble past one or more opponents to create space.
Response:  We have four options for spending money - eating at a restaurant ( $15), buying a notebook ( $4), buying a bond paper ( $20), and buying a pen ( $1). So, we need to calculate how much each option costs in total.  Option 1: Eating at a restaurant ($15) + Buying a notebook ($4) = Total cost of option 1 = $19  Option 2: Buying a bond paper ($20) + Buying a pen ($1) = Total cost of option 2 = $21  Option 3: Buying a notebook ($4) + Buying a pen ($1) = Total cost of option 3 = $5  Option 4: Eating at a restaurant ($15) + Buying a bond paper ($20) = Total cost of option 4 = $35 Therefore, based on the given information, Raffel spent a total of $19 on options 1 and 3, $21 on option 2, and $35 on option 4.
Response:  We have 11 balls and we need to distribute them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 2-1/5 balls (since there are 5 people in total). Now, let's consider what happens when one of the players gets two balls at once. In that case, they will have 3 balls instead of 2, so they will be left with 1 ball less than the others. Therefore, the final number of balls each player will have is: 2 - 1 = 1 ball less than the others. Hence, the answer is 10 balls for each player.
Response:  We know that पाण्याची टाकी सोमवारी 17 फूट खोल असते and मंगळवारी टाकीत 7 फूट जास्त पाणी होते. So, we have to find out how many feet Budhavari takes from Panchami's hole. As per the question, Budhavari takes 23 feet from Panchami's hole. Therefore, the answer is 23.
Response:  Ankush caught 10 fish, Loksin caught 5 starfish, and Ankush also caught 3 more horses than Loksin. Therefore, the total number of fish that Ankush caught is: 10 + (3 - 2) = 13.
"Response:  We know that the price of one pound of fish increased from $20 to $36 in two months. So, the percentage increase in the price of one pound of fish is:

Percentage increase = (New price - Old price) / Old price x 100
= ($36 - $20) / $20 x 100
= 80%

Now, we need to find out how much the price of one pound of fish increased in each month. To do this, we can divide the percentage increase by the number of months passed:

Price increase per month = Percentage increase / Number of months passed
= 80% / 2 months
= $18 per month

So, the price of one pound of fish increased by $18 per month over those two months."

Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of all the machines and equipment that are required for the production process. From the given information, we know that there are 30 workers who will be working in the factory, and each worker requires one machine and one set of tools to work efficiently. Therefore, the total number of machines required is 30 x 1 = 30. Similarly, the total number of sets of tools required is also 30. Now, let's calculate the cost of each machine and tool. According to the question, the cost of each machine is $1090, and the cost of each set of tools is $74. Therefore, the total cost of 30 machines is $30 x $1090 = $32,700, and the total cost of 30 sets of tools is $30 x $74 = $2,120. So, the total cost of all the machines and equipment required for the production process is $32,700 + $2,120 = $34,820.
Response:  Sandra has 9 baskets of apples and she wants to share them equally among 10 friends. Each friend will get 3 apples per basket.

Response:  We have two seasons - summer and winter. Summer lasts for 6 months (April to September), and winter lasts for 4 months (October to January). So, in total, there are 28 months in a year. Therefore, the answer is 28.
Response:  Jim has $20 and wants to know how much he will have after exchanging $8 with Ethel. So, if Jim gives $8 to Ethel, then Ethel will get $8 + $2 = $10. Now, Jim has $20 - $8 = $12 left. Therefore, Jim will have $12 after giving $8 to Ethel.
Response:  We know that 20 mails are sent in total and out of those, 10 mails are received successfully. So, the number of successful mail deliveries is 10/20 = 0.5 or 1/2. Therefore, one Aathavdyachya Jevhava (a fictional character) sends 1/2 or 0.5 mails successfully.
Response:  We have to calculate the total cost of each dress and then add them up to get the total cost of all the dresses.  For the first dress, the cost is $25, so we can write that down as C1 = $25.  For the second dress, the cost is $30, so we can write that down as C2 = $30.  For the third dress, the cost is $40, so we can write that down as C3 = $40.  Therefore, the total cost of all three dresses is: Ctotal = C1 + C2 + C3 = $25 + $30 + $40 = $95.
Response: 80 cats are in the shelter and each cat has an average of 6 kittens per year. So, the total number of kittens born in one year is: 80 x 6 = 480 kittens. Now, let's calculate how many kittens are born every month: 480 / 12 = 40 kittens per month. And finally, let's calculate how many kittens are born every week: 40 / 7 = 5.7 kittens per week. Therefore, approximately 5.7 kittens are born every week at the shelter.
Response:  We have four birds - Salty, Dadie, Momie, and Poppy. They are all different ages. Salty is three years old, Dadie is two years older than Salty, Momie is one year younger than Dadie, and Poppy is five years younger than Momie. Now, let's calculate their ages:  Salty = 3 years old + (2 years x Dadie's age) = 5 years old Dadie = 5 years old + (1 year x Momie's age) = 6 years old Momie = 6 years old - (1 year x Poppy's age) = 5 years old Poppy = 5 years old So, the ages of the four birds are: Salty = 5 years old Dadie = 6 years old Momie = 5 years old Poppy = 5 years old
Response:  Jessica has $3000 in savings, and her credit card debt is $2000. Her monthly expenses are $500. If she saves $500 per month for one year, how much will she have saved at the end of that year?  We can calculate this as follows:  At the end of one year, Jessica will have saved $6000 ($500 x 12 months) if she continues to save $500 per month. However, since she also pays off her credit card debt of $2000 during that time, her total amount saved after one year will be $8000 ($6000 + $2000). So, Jessica will have saved $8000 after one year if she continues to save $500 per month and pays off her credit card debt.
Response:  We have to find out how many seconds it takes for one botta to fill up the entire container.  Since there are 60 batta in one minute, we can calculate the time taken for each batta to fill up the container as follows: Time taken for one batta = Total time / Number of batta = 5 minutes / 60 batta = 83.33 seconds per batta. Therefore, if there are x batta, it will take x times 83.33 seconds to fill up the entire container.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each glass of juice costs $0.50 and there are 20 glasses in one liter. So, the cost of one liter of juice is:

$0.50 x 20 = $10

Now, we have to find out how much money Carl will spend on juice if he buys 25 liters. We can do this by multiplying the cost per liter with the number of liters he wants to buy:

$10 x 25 = $250

So, Carl will spend $250 on juice if he buys 25 liters."
Response:  We know that 23 is equal to 8 times 3 plus 5. So, we can write: 23 = 8 × 3 + 5. Now, let's substitute the value of 8 in terms of chini sankh (a unit of measurement for weight). There are 16 annas in one mohar, and there are 40 mohars in one chini sankh. Therefore, 1 chini sankh = 16 × 40 = 640 annas. Substituting this value in the equation above, we get: 23 = 8 × 3 + 5 = 640 + 5 = 645 annas. So, the answer is 645 annas.
Response:  Firstly, Jayad earns $200 per week and his wife earns $700 per week. So their total income is $900 per week. Now, they spend $600 per week on household expenses, which includes rent, food, clothing, transportation, and other miscellaneous expenses. Therefore, their disposable income is $300 per week. If they save $100 per week, then in one month (4 weeks), they will have saved $400. In one year (52 weeks), they will have saved $20,800 ($400 x 52 weeks).
Response:  We know that Rani is older than Monika by 3 years and younger than Bopa by 4 years. So, Rani's age is between 28 and 31 years old. Now let's calculate the exact age of each person:  Age of Rani = 30 years (as she is exactly 3 years older than Monika) Age of Monika = 27 years (as she is 3 years younger than Rani) Age of Bopa = 35 years (as he is 4 years older than Rani) Therefore, the correct answer is:  Rani - 30 years Monika - 27 years Bopa - 35 years
Response:  The first ladder has 10 rungs and each rung is of length $5$. Therefore, the total length of the first ladder is $\text{10} \times \text{5} = 50$.  Similarly, the second ladder has 8 rungs and each rung is of length $8$. So, the total length of the second ladder is $\text{8} \times \text{8} = 64$. Now, we need to find out how much longer the second ladder is than the first ladder. We can do this by subtracting the length of the first ladder from the length of the second ladder: $\text{64 - 50} = 14$. Therefore, the second ladder is $14$ units longer than the first ladder.
Response:  We have two candidates contesting for the post of President in an election with 80 voters. The votes are distributed as follows: Candidate A - 3/4 of the total votes (60 votes) and Candidate B - remaining 1/4 of the total votes (20 votes). Now, we need to find out how many votes each candidate will get if there is a tie between them. As per the given information, both candidates have received 3/4 of the total votes, which means they together have received 75% of the total votes (60 + 20 = 80). So, if there is a tie between them, they will receive 75% of the remaining votes, which is 60 votes. Therefore, the final vote share of each candidate will be: Candidate A - 60/80 x 3/4 = 45 votes Candidate B - 60/80 x 1/4 = 15 votes
Response:  Sandeepa has 200 red balls and wants to distribute them equally among 5 friends. Each friend will get how many balls?  We know that there are 5 friends in total, so each friend will get 200/5 = 40 balls. Therefore, Sandeepa will have 200 - (40 x 5) = 200 - 200 = 0 red balls left after distributing them equally among all 5 friends.
Response:  We know that Genie has been alive for 30 years and has been marking her age every year with a new number. So, after 20 years of being alive, she would have marked her age as 20 + 1 = 21 years old. Now, if we add another 5 years to this age, she will be 26 years old (21 + 5 = 26). Therefore, Genie is currently 26 years old.
Response:  We have two tractors with different capacities - one can carry 400 meters in 55 seconds and another can carry 600 meters in 30 seconds. Now, let's calculate how many sec...
Response:  We have two numbers $a$ and $b$, which are being multiplied to give us the product $\ Product = ab$. Now we want to find out how many times the number $2$ appears in this multiplication. To do that, we can divide both sides of the equation by $2$, like this: $\frac{\Product}{2} = \frac{ab}{2}$. Now we see that the number $2$ appears exactly once in this fraction, since it divides both the numerator and denominator equally. Therefore, there is one instance of the number $2$ in the multiplication of $a$ and $b$.
Response:  Jenna has 20 coins and she gives 5 to her friend. Now, Jenna has 15 coins left. If her friend also gives 5 coins back to Jenna, then how many coins does Jenna have now? So, the answer is 15 + 5 = 20 coins.
Response:  We have 3 pans of equal capacity and we need to fill them with different amounts of water.  Each pan can hold 6 cups of water, so if we want to fill all 3 pans equally, each pan will get 20 cups of water (since there are 3 pans). Now, let's assume that each home has 10 pots and each pot requires 5 cups of water. If we want to provide enough water for all homes, we need to fill 20 pots per home ( since there are 3 homes in total). Therefore, the total amount of water required is 600 cups ( since there are 3 homes x 20 pots per home x 5 cups per pot = 600 cups). However, as you mentioned, the dukaanwala cannot fill more than 160 cups of water at a time, so we need to divide the total amount of water required by the number of times he can fill his container at once. In this case, we would need to fill our containers 4 times ( since 600 / 160 = 4) to provide enough water for all homes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Mandi has in her account at any given time. We know that she earns $100 per month as salary and spends $20 per month on miscellaneous expenses. So, her total monthly income is $100 + $20 = $120. Now, let's assume that she saves $80 out of every $120 earned (i.e., 66.67%). So, the amount saved each month is $80 / 100 x $120 = $96. Therefore, the total amount of money that Mandi has in her account at any given time can be calculated as follows: Total Amount = Monthly Income - Monthly Expenses - Savings = $120 - $20 - $96 = $34. So, if Mandi wants to save $100 in three months, she will have to save $34 / 3 = $11 per month.
Response:  The businessman has $20 to invest in either Godown or Shares. If he invests it all in Godowns, he will get $4 per dollar invested as rent. So, if he invests $20, he will get $80 in rent ($20 x $4). Now, let's assume that he decides to invest half of his money in shares, which means he invests $10 out of $20. If he invests $10 in shares and each share costs $50, then he will have $500 worth of shares ($10 x $50). Now, let's calculate how much profit he will make from both sources. From Godowns, he will make $80 in rent. From shares, he will make $500 - $10 = $490 profit ($500 x $10). Therefore, the total profit he will make is $80 + $490 = $570.
Response:  Three friends are sharing $20.25 among themselves in the ratio of 4:3:2. So, each friend will get $\frac{20.25}{4} = 5.55$ dollars. Now, one of them spent $\frac{4.50}{4} = 1.13$ dollars more than his share, so he has to pay $\frac{1.13}{4} = 0.2825$ dollars extra to the others. Therefore, each friend will receive $\frac{5.55 - 0.2825}{3} = 3.7675$ dollars.
Response:  John can eat three tacos in one minute. So, he will eat 2 tacos in half a minute (30 seconds). Therefore, John eats 6 tacos per minute.
Response:  We know that the weight of a kid is around 3-4 kg (kilo grams). So if there are 35 kids in total, their combined weight would be approximately 105-140 kg (kilogram). Now, we need to convert this weight into pounds. There are approximately 2.2 pounds in one kilogram, so the weight of all those kids in pounds would be around 227-310 lbs (pounds). Therefore, the answer is 227-310 lbs.
Response:  We have to find out how many trees will be left after 10 years if 50 trees are planted every year and 30% of them die in each year.  So, in the first year, we will have 50 trees. In the second year, we will have 50 x 2 = 100 trees. In the third year, we will have 100 x 2 = 200 trees. And so on... After 10 years, we will have: 50 + 100 + 200 +... + (50 x 9) = 4500 trees. Now, let's calculate the number of trees that will survive after 10 years: 30% of 4500 = 1350 trees. Therefore, there will be 4500 - 1350 = 3150 trees left after 10 years.
Response:  On Saturday (Shukravar), 18 red flowers were placed in a pot and watered. On Sunday (Shanivar), these flowers bloomed into beautiful white petals. Now, let's analyze what happened next:  On Monday (Ravivar), the white petals of the flowers turned yellow. This means that each flower had 3 stages - Red, White, and Yellow. So, there are 3 x 7 = 21 flowers in total.
Response:  We have to find out how many pens are needed for 20 dollars worth of change.  Firstly, we need to convert the amount of money from dollars to rupees. There are approximately 69 rupees in one dollar, so 20 dollars is equal to 1380 rupees (20 x 69 = 1380). Now, we know that each pen costs 2 dollars, which means it costs 130 rupees per pen (2 x 69 = 130). Therefore, to get 20 dollars worth of change, we will need 20 / 130 = 15 pens (20 x 130 = 2600). So, there will be 15 pens in total.
"Response:  We know that Penny has $1.20 and Reacher has $0.30.  So, if they share equally, each will get:
Penny's share = $1.20 / 2 = $0.60
Reacher's share = $0.30 / 2 = $0.15
So, after sharing equally, Penny will have $0.60 and Reacher will have $0.15."
"Response:  We have 40 restaurants in the city and each restaurant serves 200 customers per day. So, the total number of customers served by all the restaurants is:

40 restaurants x 200 customers/day = 8,000 customers/day

Now, we need to calculate how many kilograms of gas are used by all the restaurants together. Since each customer consumes 2 pounds (or 0.9 kg) of food per meal, the total amount of gas used can be calculated as follows:

Total number of customers served/day x Total weight of food consumed/customer = Total amount of gas used/day

So, the total amount of gas used by all the restaurants is:

8,000 customers/day x 0.9 kg/customer = 7,200 kg/day

Therefore, approximately 7,200 kg of gas are used by all the restaurants in the city every day."
Response:  We know that there are 23786 residents in the city and among them, 8417 males and 9092 females live here. So, the total number of people living in the city is 23786 + 8417 + 9092 = 31295. Therefore, the number of muln (males) living in the city is 8417.
Response:  We know that in one month, there are 20 working days and 5 non-working days (weekends). So, total number of days in a month = 20 + 5 = 25 days. Now, let's calculate how many cards can be made in each of the two months: Month 1: In this month, Elena worked for 20 days and took 5 days off (weekends), so she worked for 20 - 5 = 15 days. Total number of cards she made in this month = 15 x 20 = 300 cards. Month 2: In this month, Elena worked for 20 days again, but this time she took only 3 days off (weekends), so she worked for 20 - 3 = 17 days. Total number of cards she made in this month = 17 x 20 = 340 cards. Therefore, the difference between the number of cards made in the two months is: 340 - 300 = 40 cards.
Response:  Mark Copeland is an editor who can edit 1000 words in one hour. Each word he edits earns him $5. So, in one hour, Mark can earn $5 x 1000 = $5000.
Response:  We have to find out how many liters of water Baldoor can carry in each bag and then calculate how much water he can carry overall.  According to the question, Baldoor has 5 bags, and each bag can hold 10 liters of water. So, the total amount of water that Baldoor can carry is: 5 x 10 = 50 liters.
Response:  John earned $2000 per month and paid $500 as taxes, so his take-home pay is $1500 ($2000 - $500). If he invests $8000 in a savings account earning 5% interest annually, he will have $8400 after one year ($8000 x 1.05). Now, let's calculate how much money he can make in each of the next five years: Year 1: $8400 Year 2: $9160 ($8400 x 1.05) Year 3: $9976 ($9160 x 1.05) Year 4: $10864 ($9976 x 1.05) Year 5: $11852 ($10864 x 1.05) So, after five years, John would have made a total of $54640 ($11852 x 5) in interest alone! Of course, this doesn't include any additional income from his investments or other sources.
Response: 10 eakers are carrying 5 tons of goods each, and each ton of goods contains 2 barrels of wine. So, in total, there will be 5 x 5 = 25 tons of wine carried by all 10 eakers. Now, since each barrel of wine contains 2 bottles, we can calculate the number of bottles of wine carried by all 10 eakers as follows: Number of bottles of wine = Total weight of wine / Weight of one bottle of wine  In this case, the total weight of wine is 25 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 50 tons of wine. Since each barrel of wine contains 2 bottles, the total number of bottles of wine carried by all 10 eakers is: Number of bottles of wine = 50 tons / 2 barrels/ton = 25,000 bottles of wine.
Response:  Firstly, there are 10 people in total (5 men and 5 women).  Each person has to carry either Rs. 100 or Rs. 200 notes with them.  Since each person can only carry one note of either denomination, the total amount of money carried by all 10 people is equal to 10 x Rs. 100 = Rs. 1000.  Now, let's consider the distribution of money among the three groups - Group A, B, and C.  Group A consists of 3 men who have to carry Rs. 100 each, so their total amount of money carried is 3 x Rs. 100 = Rs. 300. Similarly, Group B consists of 4 women who have to carry Rs. 200 each, so their total amount of money carried is 4 x Rs. 200 = Rs. 800. And finally, Group C consists of 3 women who have to carry Rs. 100 each, so their total amount of money carried is 3 x Rs. 100 = Rs. 300. Therefore, the total amount of money carried by all 10 people is Rs. 1000 + Rs. 300 + Rs. 800 = Rs. 2100.
Response:  Jennette has 22 horses and 10 cows. Each horse eats 6 pies and each cow eats 4 pies. So, in total, Jennette's horses eat 126 pies (22 x 6) and her cows eat 40 pies (10 x 4). Now, let's find out how many pies are left after feeding all the animals. Total number of pies consumed = Number of horses x Number of pies per horse + Number of cows x Number of pies per cow - Number of pies remaining After feeding all the animals, there will be 38 pies remaining (126 - 40 - 6 = 38). Therefore, Jennette has 38 pies left.
Response:  Mr. Bart has given exams to Brainly students every semester. Each student takes an exam in each subject. The total marks for each subject are as follows:  English - 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. Now, we need to find out how many marks Brainly scored overall. To do this, we will calculate the average of all the subjects. We know that the sum of all the marks is equal to the total number of marks obtained by Brainly. So, let's add up all the marks: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 548 Total marks obtained by Brainly = 548 Now, we divide the total marks by the number of subjects: Average marks obtained by Brainly = 548 / 5 = 109.6 (round off to two decimal places) Therefore, Brainly scored an average of 109.6 marks out of 500.
Response:  Maykalal's speed is 5 km/h and he travels for 25 kilometers. If he walks at this speed for 4 hours, then he will have traveled a distance of 60 kilometers (since there are 4 hours \* 5 km/h = 20 kilometers per hour). So, in total, Maykalal has walked 85 kilometers (60 kilometers + 25 kilometers).
Response:  We have 25 chocolates in one bag and 80 chocolates in another bag. Each chocolate weighs 40 grams. So, if we divide the total weight of chocolates in each bag by the number of chocolates in that bag, we get the average weight of each chocolate. For the first bag, the total weight is 25 x 40 = 1000 grams, and there are 25 chocolates, so the average weight per chocolate is 1000 / 25 = 40 grams. Similarly, for the second bag, the total weight is 80 x 40 = 3200 grams, and there are 80 chocolates, so the average weight per chocolate is 3200 / 80 = 40 grams. Therefore, the answer is 40 grams.
Response:  On Monday, 4 keys were lost and 3 keys were found. So, there are 1 key less than the total number of keys available at the end of Monday. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We have to find out how much money is required to fill up 20 drums of capacity 120 liters each. So, we need to calculate the total volume of water that needs to be filled in 20 drums. Volume of one drum = Capacity of one drum = 120 liters So, Total volume of water needed to fill 20 drums = Number of drums x Volume of one drum = 20 x 120 liters = 2400 liters Now, we know that the cost of filling one drum with water is $1.20 per liter. Therefore, the total cost of filling all 20 drums will be = Cost of filling one drum x Number of drums = $1.20 per liter x 2400 liters = $2880 Now, we are asked if this amount is less than or equal to $12000. Since $2880 is greater than $12000, the answer is (b) Less than.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Saral and Jack can get after selling their jewelry.  Saral has $30 in his jacket pocket, and each of the two gold coins he has weighs 20 grams, which is worth $20 per gram. Therefore, the total value of Saral's jewelry is $60 ($30 + (2 x $20)).  Now, let's see what happens when they sell their jewelry. If they sell their jewelry for $10 each, then they will get a total of $40 ($60 - $20). Since there are four of them, each person will get $10 ($40 / 4) from the sale of their jewelry. However, if they sell their jewelry for $5 each, then they will get a total of $20 ($60 - $40), and each person will get $5 ($20 / 4) from the sale of their jewelry. So, if they sell their jewelry for $5 each, they will have $10 more than they would have had if they sold it for $10 each.
Response:  The cost of one small jar of jam is Rs.42 and the cost of two jars is Rs.84. So, if we buy three jars, the total cost will be Rs.84 x 3 = Rs.252. Now, let's calculate the cost of four jars. If the cost of one jar is Rs.42, then the cost of four jars will be Rs.42 x 4 = Rs.168. Therefore, there are 252 - 168 = 84 jars more in the big box than in the small box.
Response:  We have been given that the area of the circular plot is 1500 square meters and its radius is 6 meters. To find out how many circles can fit in the plot, we need to divide the area of the plot by the area of one circle. The area of one circle = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. So, πr^2 = 1500 x π (6)^2 = 36000 π. Now, if we want to know how many circles can fit in the plot, we need to divide the total area of the plot by the area of one circle. Therefore, number of circles = Total area of plot / Area of one circle = 36000 π / π = 36000. Since there are 36000 circles that can fit in the plot, each circle has an area of πr^2 = 36000 x π (6)^2 = 490008π square meters.
Response:  We know that there are 100 customers who have made purchases at Store A during the first week of January. Now, we need to find out how many customers visited Store B in the same period. According to the given information, 50% of these customers also purchased something from Store B. So, if X is the number of customers who visited Store B, then we can write an equation as follows: Customers who visited Store B = (Customers who made purchases at Store A x 50%) / 2 Customers who visited Store B = (100 x 50%) / 2 = 25 Customers who visited Store B visited Store A. Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  The first jar contains 80 gms of water and takes 4 minutes to fill. The second jar has 60 gms of water and takes 3 minutes to fill. So, in total, it will take 7 minutes (4 + 3) to fill both jars. Now, let's calculate how much water is left after filling both jars. In the first jar, there are 80 gms of water initially, and after 7 minutes, there will be 80 x 7 = 560 gms of water left. Similarly, in the second jar, there are 60 gms of water initially, and after 7 minutes, there will be 60 x 7 = 420 gms of water left. Therefore, the difference between the amount of water left in the two jars is 560 - 420 = 140 gms.
Response:  Lorelai has $320 in her wallet and she spends $80 on a new dress. Now she has $240 left. If she wants to buy a bracelet worth $32, how much will she have to pay from her own money?  Solution: To find out how much Lorelai needs to pay for the bracelet, we need to divide the cost of the bracelet ($32) by the amount of money she has left after buying the dress ($240). So, Lorelai needs to pay $32 / $240 = $0.13 (or $13) for the bracelet.

Response:  We know that there are four subjects - Science, Maths, English and Social Studies.  The number of questions in each subject is as follows:  Science - 34, Maths - 39, English - 42, Social Studies - 37. Therefore, the total number of questions is: Total = 34 + 39 + 42 + 37 = 251. Now, let's see how many questions Naina answered correctly out of 251 questions: Naina answered 68 questions correctly, so she got (68/251) x 100% = 27% correct. Similarly, Joyon answered 17 questions correctly out of 251 questions, so he got (17/251) x 100% = 6% correct.
Response:  The time taken to complete 10 minutes of crossword puzzle is equal to 600 seconds (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute). Similarly, the time taken to complete 5 minutes of Sudoku is also equal to 300 seconds (since there are 30 seconds in 1 minute). Now, let's calculate how many crosswords and Sudokus can be completed in one hour. If we have 300 seconds per minute, then we can complete 300 / 60 = 5 crosswords in 1 hour. Similarly, if we have 30 seconds per minute, then we can complete 30 / 60 = 0.5 Sudokus in 1 hour. Therefore, out of 8 hours, we can complete 5 x 8 = 40 crosswords and 0.5 x 8 = 4 Sudokus.
Response:  We know that 120 liters of water are poured into a container with a capacity of 90 liters. So, there will be 30 liters of excess water (120 - 90 = 30). Therefore, the amount of water left in the container is 30 liters.
Response:  We know that 90 jerrycans contain 1 liter each, so they contain a total of 90 liters. Now, we are asked how many full Jerry cans there would be if 40 liters of petrol were spilled. To find out, we need to divide the total volume of petrol (40 liters) by the capacity of each Jerry can (1 liter). So, there will be 40 full Jerry cans.
"Response:  In one year, Company A makes $150,000 in profits and spends $70,000 on expenses. The remaining profit of $80,000 is then invested for the next year at an interest rate of 10%. How much money will Company A have after two years?
Let X be the amount of money that Company A has after two years.
From the given information, we know that the company made $150,000 in profits in the first year and spent $70,000 on expenses, so its net profit was $80,000 ($150,000 - $70,000).
Now, let's calculate how much money the company would have after investing this net profit for one year at an interest rate of 10%:
X = $80,000 x (1 + 0.10) = $96,000
So, after two years, the company would have $96,000."
Response:  Karlos buys 30 dollars worth of Benjie's bot at $18 per tael and pays cash. So, he paid Benjie $540 ($30 x 18). Now, if Karlos bought 3 tails of bot from Benjie and gave him $5 as change, how much money did Benjie receive in total? Solution:  Total amount received by Benjie = Number of tails of bot sold x Price per tael + Change given to Karlos = 3 x $18 + $5 = $57.
Response:  If Andryu New Jersey is located at a distance of 200 miles from Rochester, and it takes 4 hours to reach there by car, then the time taken for the journey would be: Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 4 hours = 50 miles/hour. Now, if we want to calculate how many days it will take to reach Rochester from Andryu New Jersey, we need to divide the total distance by the speed at which they are traveling: Days = Total Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 50 miles/hour = 4 days. So, it will take 4 days to reach Rochester from Andryu New Jersey.
Response:  James has 30 cards of each type - Agni, Gavati, and Panya. Each card has 8 watery elements, 14 earthy elements, and 4 fiery elements. Since there are 5 elements in total, we can calculate the number of cards with each element as follows:  For Agni, since there are 30 cards, the number of Agni cards is 30 x 8 = 240.  For Gavati, since there are 30 cards, the number of Gavati cards is 30 x 14 = 420.  For Panya, since there are 30 cards, the number of Panya cards is 30 x 4 = 120. Therefore, out of the total 800 cards, 240 are Agni, 420 are Gavati, and 120 are Panya.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Swapnil has in his wallet which is $6.50. Now, he wants to buy an item worth $3.25 and another one worth $1.75. So, the total amount he needs to pay is $3.25 + $1.75 = $4.99. Since he has only $6.50 with him, he doesn't have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he can either choose to buy one of them or use some other method like using a credit card or asking someone for help.
Response:  Kalindi can make 360 tukde in an hour, and each tukde takes 4 minutes to make. So, she makes 12 tukdes per minute (360/4 = 85). Now, let's calculate how many tas she can make in one hour. Tas are equal to 8 tukdes, so she can make 960 tas in an hour (8 x 12 = 96).
Response:  We have 120 farmers who are growing turmeric and we want to know how many of them will be affected if there is a 30% reduction in the amount of water available for irrigation.  So, let's calculate the number of farmers who will be affected as follows:  Number of farmers affected = Total number of farmers x Percentage of farmers affected  Number of farmers affected = 120 x 30/100 = 36 farmers  Therefore, 36 farmers will be affected if there is a 30% reduction in the amount of water available for irrigation.
Response:  Mark has 12 cars and each car costs $20,000. So, in total, he has invested $240,000 in his business (12 x $20,000). Now, if he sells each car for $30,000, he will make a profit of $5,000 per car ($30,000 - $20,000 = $5,000). Since he has 12 cars, his overall profit would be $60,000 ($5,000 x 12 cars). Therefore, Mark makes $60,000 in profits from his car business.
Response:  On Monday (Somvar), Kalilai and Robert played for 5 hours each, resulting in 10 hours of playtime overall.  On Tuesday (Mangalwar), Kalilai played with Somavari for 3 hours, resulting in an additional 3 hours of playtime. Therefore, the total number of hours that Kalilai played with Robert is 13 hours (10 + 3).
Response:  We know that Daksh has 50 coins and he wants to exchange them for bags of rice. Each bag of rice contains 10 kg of rice. So, if we divide 50 coins by 10 kg per bag, we get the number of bags of rice that Daksh can buy with his coins. Therefore, the answer is 5 bags of rice.
Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we divide the number of penguins (36) by the time taken to reach the shore (1 hour), we get the number of penguins that can swim per minute. Therefore, 36 penguins can swim per minute.
Response:  There are 6 girls and each girl has 3 tomatoes. So, in total, there are 6 x 3 = 18 tomatoes among all the girls. Now, one of them wants to eat 3 more tomatoes. So, after eating those extra tomatoes, she will have 3 + 3 = 6 tomatoes left with her. Therefore, the remaining 5 girls will have 18 - 6 = 12 tomatoes among them.
"Response:  John has 20 friends and he gives each of them Rs.4 as a gift. So, the total amount given by John is:

John gives Rs.4 to each of his 20 friends = Rs.80

Now, let's calculate how much John spends in total:

Total amount spent by John = Number of gifts x Cost per gift
= 20 x Rs.4
= Rs.80

So, John spends Rs.80 in total."
Response:  If Rama takes 13 minutes to complete one pen drawing, then he will take 52 minutes (13 x 4) to complete four pen drawings. Therefore, if he completes all five pen drawings in one sitting, it will take him 52 minutes + 10 minutes = 62 minutes total time.
Response:  John has $20 and he spends $10 of it. Now he has $10 left. After one year, if the interest rate is 5%, then the amount in his account will be: $10 (initial balance) x (1 + 0.05/1) = $10 x 1.05 = $10.50 So after one year, John has $30.50 in his account ($20 initial balance + $10.50 interest).
Response:  Meri joaanpeksha doon varshaa lahana ahe, jeejesha peksha paach varshaa moothi ahe. So, if my age is 20 years and Jeesa's age is 30 years, then how many times older is Jeesa than me?  We can see that Jeesa is 50% older than me (30 - 20 = 10). Therefore, Jeesa is 10 times older than me.
Response:  The total number of students in the hall is 1000. Out of these, 30% of them go out after the break, which means 300 students (30% of 1000) go out. Now, among those who went out, 75% return to their seats, which means 225 students (75% of 300) come back. So, the final number of students left inside the hall is 300 - 225 = 75. Therefore, the answer is 75.
Response:  James has 6 more months than Robert. So, if Robert was born after 30 months, then James will be born after 36 months (6 + 30 = 36). Now, John is older than both James and Robert by 54 months (54 - 36 = 18). Therefore, John is 18 months older than James.
Response:  We know that Dolly and Pandora are two books written by different authors. So, there must be at least one book written by an author other than either Dolly or Pandora. Therefore, the number of books written by authors other than Dolly and Pandora is 2 (Dolly + Pandora). Now, we need to find out how many books have been written by each of these authors. Since we know that Dolly has written only one book, so the number of books written by Dolly is 1. Similarly, since Pandora has also written only one book, so the number of books written by Pandora is also 1. Thus, the total number of books written by all three authors (including those who wrote Dolly and Pandora) is 3 (1 + 1 + 1).
Response:  We have to find out how many times the friend can write the letter in 6 minutes.  Since each minute has 60 seconds, we need to divide the total time (6 minutes) by the number of letters that can be written per minute. So, if it takes 1 minute to write one letter, then the friend can write 6 letters in 6 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 6.
"Response:  Jessica takes 15 minutes to complete each task, and she has been working for 30 days. Therefore, the total time taken by Jessica to complete all tasks is:
Time taken = Number of tasks x Time taken per task
= 1000 / 15
= 66.67 hours
So, Jessica has worked for approximately 66.67 hours in one month."
Response:  We know that Grifin has 24 French fries and he wants to share them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 24/5 = 4.8 French fries per person. But since we can't have fractional French fries, round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each friend will get 4 French fries. Now, let's calculate how many French fries Grifin will have left after giving them away. He had 27 French fries initially, but now he only has 24 - 4 = 20 French fries left.
Response:  We have two maternity homes with different number of beds - 16 and 32. If we divide the total number of beds in both maternity homes (i.e., 16 + 32 = 48) equally among themselves, then each maternity home will have 24 beds ( i.e., 48 / 2 = 24). So, there are 24 beds in one maternity home and 32 beds in another maternity home.
Response:  Genie makes $250 per hour and charges $30 per minute. The artist takes 10% of the profit, which is $30 per hour. So, the total amount earned by the artist is $250 x 0.9 = $225 per hour. Now, let's calculate how much money the genie earns in an hour: $30 x 60 minutes = $1800 per hour. Therefore, the genie earns $1800 - $225 = $1575 per hour.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money spent on each event as follows:  For the wedding party, the cost per person is $120, and there are 50 people attending. Therefore, the total cost for this event is $6,000 ($120 x 50).  Similarly, for the bachelorette party, the cost per person is $43, and there are 15 people attending. So, the total cost for this event is $645 ($43 x 15).  Now, let's find out how much money was spent on each event:  Total cost for wedding party = $6,000  Total cost for bachelorette party = $645  Therefore, the difference between the two costs is $5,355 ($6,000 - $645).
Response:  We have to calculate how much each pig will eat and then multiply it with the number of pigs to find out the total cost.  Each pig will eat 50 pounds of feed per day, so the daily food cost for one pig is $1.50 (50 pounds x $0.30 per pound). Since there are four pigs, the total daily food cost is $6.00 ($1.50 x 4 pigs). Now, let's calculate the monthly food cost. There are 30 days in a month, so the monthly food cost is $6.00 x 30 = $180.00. Finally, we need to convert this amount from dollars to rupees. The current exchange rate is 1 USD = 70 INR, so the monthly food cost in Indian Rupees is $180.00 / 70 INR = ₹25,714.
Response:  Somvari (Sunday) is equal to 5 days and Mangalwar (Monday) is equal to 6 days. So, if there are 200 working days in a year, then:  Number of working days = 365 (days in a year) - 5 (Somvari days) - 6 (Mangalwar days) = 294 working days. Therefore, the correct answer is 294 calories.
