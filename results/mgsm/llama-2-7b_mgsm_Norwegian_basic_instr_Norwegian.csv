"Response: 256 km

Forståelse av problemet:
John kjører i tre timer med en hastighed på 100 km/t, som betyr at han har kjørt 300 kilometer under denne tiden (3 timer x 100 km/t = 300 km). Når han vendte om og droppet tilbake, hadde han da kjørt totalt 300 kilometer. Om han hadde kjørt de gjenværende 4 timene med en hastighed på 80 km/t, vil han ha kjørt ytterligere 320 kilometer (4 timer x 80 km/t = 320 km). Alt i alt har han dermed kjørt 620 kilometer (300 km + 320 km) under spørsmålets periode."

"Response: 24,68 years

For å løse problemet, vi behøver first calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree over its lifetime. The cost of planting the tree is $90, and we will need to pay this amount every year to maintain it. We can also assume that the tree will produce 7 citrons each year, which we can sell for $1.50 each. However, we will need to spend $3 per year on watering and caring for the tree.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to break even, we can use a formula called ""present value"" or ""net present value."" This formula takes into account the current value of money (which is lower than its future value) and calculates the total worth of a series of cash flows at a specific interest rate. In this case, we will use a simple interest rate of 5% per year.

So, let's plug in the numbers:

Total cost of planting = $90
Yearly maintenance cost = $3
Number of citrons produced per year = 7
Selling price of one citron = $1.50
Present value factor (5% interest rate) = 1 / (1 + 0.05)^years

Now we can solve for the number of years it will take for the tree to break even using the following equation:

Break-even time = Total cost of planting / (Yearly maintenance cost x Present value factor)

Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:

Break-even time = $90 / ($3 x 1 / (1 + 0.05)^years)

Solving for years, we get:

Break-even time = 24.68 years

Therefore, it will take approximately 24.68 years for the tree to break even based on the given assumptions."

* If 25% of the students took jazz dance, then the number of students who took jazz dance is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.
* If the remaining students took hip-hop dance, then the number of students who took hip-hop dance is (100 - 20) / 100 = 0.8 or 80%.

Therefore, the percentage of students who took hip-hop dance is 80%."

Response:  To calculate the average number of yoghurts Terry buys in a month, we need to divide the total cost by the number of days he buys them. In this case, if Terry buys 2 yoghurtars per day and they cost $4 each, then he will spend $8 per day on yoghurt. If he buys yoghurt for 30 days, then he will have spent a total of $240 on yoghurt in that time period. Therefore, Terry buys an average of 6 yoghurtars (2 x 30) per month.

Response:  No, it is not possible for the dragon's fire to reach Polly even if she throws the mirror 400 feet away from her. The distance between Polly and the dragon is too great for the fire to travel that far in the time it takes for Polly to throw the mirror. Additionally, the dragon's fire would need to be able to travel at a speed of at least 150 miles per hour to reach Polly before she can react and throw the mirror. This is not physically plausible. Therefore, Polly cannot be killed by the dragon's fire using this method.

= 80 hours

So, Meredith spent approximately 80 hours writing articles that week."

Therefore, the time it takes Tom to come back is: Time = 11 km / 10 mi/h = 1.1 hours or 66 minutes.
Response:  If Uriah takes away 30 pictures from his book collection, he will have to remove approximately 21 pounds (9.5 kg) of books. This is calculated by subtracting 30 times the weight of one picture (which is 1 pound or 0.5 kg) from the total weight of his book collection (which is 14 pounds or 6.3 kg). Therefore, after removing 30 pictures, his book collection would weigh around 11 pounds or 5 kg less than it did before.
"Response:  To calculate the total amount of money earned by the mechanic on each day, we need to multiply the number of tires repaired on that day by the price per tire.

6 x $60 = $360 + 4 x $40 = $160 = $520
For Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and did not repair any truck tires, so the total amount earned on Friday is:
12 x $40 = $480
Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the mechanic over two days is:
$520 + $480 = $1000
So, the mechanic earned a total of $1000 over two days."

So, in one week (Monday to Sunday), Judy teaches:

75 students/day x 7 days/week = 525 students/week
120 students/Saturday x 2 Saturdays/week = 240 students/week

Therefore, Judy earns $15 x 525 students/week + $15 x 240 students/week = $36,750 per week."

And if he sells 17 pots of begoniaer at $2.12 each, he will make a total of $35.04 from those pots (17 x $2.12 = $35.04). So in total, Artie will make $74.45 from all the plants he sold that day ($32.88 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $74.45).

* Therefore, he has a total of 4 t-shirts (one for each year he has been on vacation).
* Since he is now 34 years old, he has been on vacation for a total of 12 years (4 x 3 = 12).
* So, he has a total of 12 t-shirts (4 t-shirts per year x 12 years).

Let's assume that each guest receives one present worth $2. Since there are 16 guests invited, and 3/4 of them will not come (since they have already given a gift), we can estimate that about 11 guests will actually attend the party. Therefore, the total cost of presents for all guests at Christina's birthday party would be approximately:

$2 x 11 guests = $22

So, Christina will spend around $22 on presents for her guests at the party."

Forståelse:  If the first 15 minutes of traffic flow are considered as a ""lag"" period, then the number of cars that passed through during this time can be calculated as follows:

Number of cars passing through in the first 15 minutes = Number of cars in the queue x Time taken to pass through the queue / Total time available for passage

In this case, there were 30 cars on the highway initially, and it took 15 minutes for 20 cars to pass through the queue. Therefore, the number of cars that passed through during the first 15 minutes is:

Number of cars passing through in the first 15 minutes = 30 x (15/30) = 40

So, 40 cars passed through during the first 15 minutes of traffic flow."

"Response:  To calculate the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to use the information provided in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, 2 containers were imported with a total of 5 cars inside.
2. The next day, 4 more containers arrived, bringing the total number of containers to 8.
3. Since each container can hold up to 5 cars, the total number of cars imported on the second day is: 8 containers x 5 cars per container = 40 cars.

Therefore, the answer is 40 cars."
"Response:  If we assume that Adrian's and Lylah's salaries increased by the same percentage each year, then we can calculate their total earnings as follows:

Adrian's total earnings = $40,000 (current year) + ($30,000 x 4 years) = $120,000
Lylah's total earnings = $30,000 (current year) + ($20,000 x 4 years) = $120,000

Therefore, both Adrian and Lylah earned a total of $120,000 over the four-year period."

= 60 letters - 20 letters / 30 letters per row
= 10 letters

Therefore, Jennie sorted 10 letters."

"Response:  If the hospital sees 500 patients per day and each patient takes an average of 24 minutes to be seen, then the total time taken by all patients in a day is:

Time taken by patients = Number of patients x Average time per patient
= 500 x 24
= 12,000 minutes

If the doctors take $150 per hour and the hospital takes $200 per hour from the patients, then the total revenue generated by the hospital in a day is:

Total revenue = Number of hours worked by doctors x Rate per hour + Number of hours worked by hospital x Rate per hour
= (Number of hours worked by doctors x Rate per hour) + (Number of hours worked by hospital x Rate per hour)

From the given information, we can calculate that the number of hours worked by doctors is 8 hours (as they work for 8 hours in a day). Therefore, the total revenue generated by the hospital in a day is:

Total revenue = 8 x $150 + 16 x $200
= $12,000 + $3,200
= $15,200

Therefore, the hospital generates a daily revenue of $15,200."

"Response:  To calculate the number of questions that were left unanswered after Mark finished both tests, we need to use the information provided in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the time taken by Mark to finish the first test (75 questions x 5 seconds per question = 375 seconds).
Step 2: Calculate the total time available for Mark to finish the second test (8 hours - 6 hours = 2 hours).
Step 3: Divide the total number of questions in the second test (100 questions) by the time available (2 hours = 100 questions / 2 hours = 50 questions per hour).
Step 4: Multiply the number of questions per hour by the time taken by Mark to finish the first test (375 seconds / 5 seconds per question = 75 questions answered in the first test).

Now, let's plug in the values:

Number of questions answered in the first test = 75 questions
Time taken by Mark to finish the first test = 375 seconds
Total time available for Mark to finish the second test = 2 hours
Number of questions in the second test = 100 questions

So, the number of questions left unanswered after Mark finished both tests is:

Number of questions left unanswered = Number of questions in the second test - Number of questions answered in the first test = 100 questions - 75 questions = 25 questions

Therefore, Mark left 25 questions unanswered after finishing both tests."

"Response: 108 dollars

Answer: $108

Explanation:
Kim has started a small household cleaning business and is wondering how much he will make from his clients. He has three clients, but assumes they will pay him for five services each. The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of one package of cleaning supplies is $5. Based on these costs, if all three clients pay him for the maximum amount of services, he will make a total of $92 in income. However, if he incurs additional expenses such as transportation or equipment costs, this could reduce his profit margin. Therefore, the answer is $108, which represents the maximum amount that Kim could potentially earn after deducting his expenses."
Response:  For å finne ut om John kan hausta mange ananasar på et år, must vi first calculate the total number of ananasars that can be grown on his 10 hectares of land in a year. We know that there are 100 ananasars per hectare, so the total number of ananasars that can be grown on John's 10 hectares is: 100 ananasars/hectare x 10 hectares = 1000 ananasars To find out if many ananasars John can hausa on a year, we need to divide the total number of ananasars by the time it takes him to grow them. If it takes John three months to grow one batch of ananasars, then he will have three chances to grow ananasars in a year. So, the number of ananasars John can hausa on a year is: 1000 ananasars / 3 months = 333 ananasars per month Or, in numerical form: 333 ananasars/month
"Response:  For å finne ut hva antall Lego-blokker Johnny kan ta opp, vi behøver å løse en matematisk problemstilling. Vi kjenner fire forskjellige typer av Lego-blokker som Johnny har:

* Den første typen er 500 mynt, som er lik med 500 enheter (eller blokker).
* Den andre typen er 3 gangers større enn den første, eller 1500 mynt (eller blokker).
* Den tredje typen er 1/4 av den andre typen, eller 375 mynt (eller blokker).

For å finne ut hvordan mange Lego-blokker Johnny kan ta opp, vi kan bruke et formel som er basert på de fire typerne av blokker:

Antall blokker = Antall 500-mynt + 3 gangers større antall - 1/4 av det store antallet

Innsatt verdier:
Antall 500-mynt = 500
Antall 1500-mynd = 3 x 500 = 1500
Antall 375-mynd = 3 x 150 = 450

Så, ifra man ser tilbake paa formelen, kan Johnny ta opp følgende antall Lego-blokker:

Antall blokker = 500 + 1500 - 450 = 950

Dette betyr at Johnny kan ta opp 950 Lego-blokker når hantek opp alle de samme."

"Response:  For å løse dette spørsmålet, vi behøver å ta oss av de to delene av problemet: Hvordan mye lengre er Steve fra skolen enn Tim, og hva er Tims fart på skateboard? Vi kan da bruke disse informasjonene til å finne ut når vinneren kommer til huset sitt.
Lengden mellom Steve og skolen er 3 miles = 5080 feet (since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet). Since Steve is further away from the school than Tim, he will take longer to reach his destination. Let's assume that it takes him x minutes to reach his house.
Tim's speed on the skateboard is 264 feet per minute. To find out when Tim will arrive at Steve's house, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. We know that Tim has traveled 2 miles = 3280 feet so far, and he will continue traveling at a constant speed of 264 feet per minute. Therefore, the time it will take him to reach Steve's house is:
Time = 3280 feet / 264 feet/minute = 12.3 minutes
So, Tim will arrive at Steve's house in 12.3 minutes after leaving the school."

"Response:  To calculate the total number of bananas needed for two months, we need to know how many bananas each species of monkey needs per month. Let's assume that the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total number of bananas needed for two months = Number of bananas needed by gorillas + Number of bananas needed by baboons
= 400 x 2 = 800 + 100 x 2 = 200
= 1000 bananas
Therefore, Mr. Vakare must order at least 1000 bananas every quarter to ensure he has enough food for all the monkeys in his zoo."

Response:  After 36 months, a statue made of marble that originally cost $20 will cost approximately $48. To calculate this, we can use the formula: New price = Old price x (1 + Percentage increase) ^ Number of months. In this case, the old price is $20, the percentage increase is 20%, and the number of months is 36. So, the new price would be: New price = $20 x (1 + 0.20)^36 = $48.

"Response:  If Jackie takes care of the taxes herself, she will save 3 hours of freelance work time and earn $35 per hour in income. However, if she hires a bookkeeper to handle the taxes, she will have to pay them $90. To determine which option is more profitable, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jackie will make or lose based on each scenario.

Scenario 1 (Taking Care of Taxes Herself):
Total Income = $35/hour x 3 hours = $105
Total Costs = $35/hour x 3 hours = $105
Net Profit = Total Income - Total Costs = $0

Scenario 2 (Hiring a Bookkeeper):
Total Income = $90 (revenue from hiring a bookkeeper)
Total Costs = $105 (cost of hiring a bookkeeper)
Net Profit = Total Income - Total Costs = -$15

Based on these calculations, it appears that hiring a bookkeeper would result in a net loss of $15. Therefore, taking care of the taxes herself may be the more profitable option for Jackie."

Response:  For å finne ut om kor mykje kostar en uniform, trenger vi å kalkulere sammenkoblede prisene til hatt, jakke og bukse. Vi kan bruke følgende formel for å oppnå dette: Total cost = (Price of hat x Number of hats) + (Price of jacket x Number of jackets) + (Price of pants x Number of pairs of pants) Let's assume that the orchestra has requested 10 new uniforms in total. The price of each hat is $25, the price of each jacket is $30, and the price of each pair of pants is $40. To find out how much one uniform costs, we can plug these prices into the formula like this: Total cost = ($25 x 10) + ($30 x 10) + ($40 x 1) = $250 + $300 + $40 = $990 Therefore, one uniform costs $990.

Sally 2 = 3 years old
Granny Red = 2 x (8 - 2) = 16 years old
Mother Red = 2 x (10 - 2) = 20 years old
Sally 3 = 8 years old
Sally 4 = 32 - 8 = 24 years old
Therefore, the ages of these four birds are:
Sally 1 = 5 years old
Sally 2 = 3 years old
Granny Red = 16 years old
Mother Red = 20 years old
Sally 4 = 24 years old"

Total cost of lemons = 3 x 4 = 12 dollars/liter
Number of glasses sold = 50 dollars/liter
Profit = $25
Now, let's subtract the profit from the total cost of the lemons:
Amount spent on lemons = Total cost of lemons - Profit
= 12 dollars/liter - $25
= $13 dollars/liter
So, Juan and his brother Carlos spent $13 per liter on lemons."

"Response:  The faster team will win by 15 seconds (or more).

Explanation:
The first leg of the race is running 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means that they are running at a pace of 1 minute 20 seconds per kilometer (km). Since the second leg is 3 seconds faster than the first leg, we can assume that they are also running at a pace of 1 minute 20 seconds per km. Therefore, the total time it takes for both legs to complete their races is:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 400 m / (1 min 20 sec/km)
= 400 m / 1.20 min
= 333.33 seconds

Now, let's compare this time with the time taken by the other team:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 400 m / (55 sec/km)
= 400 m / 0.87 min
= 466.94 seconds

As we can see, the faster team will take approximately 33 seconds less than the other team to complete the race, which means they will win by 15 seconds (or more)."

Response:  If Mor had 20 apples and Jenna had half as many apples as her, then Jenna had 10 apples.
"Response: 48

For å løse problemet, vi need to use a combination of division and multiplication. We know that there are 10 cages with hamsters, and each cage has 5 hamsters. So, the total number of hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.
We also know that there are 20 pieces of food in the can, and none of them are used by any other animals in the store. Therefore, the number of pieces of food each hamster gets is 20 / 50 = 0.4.
So, if 160 pieces of food have been distributed among the small rodents, then 160 / 0.4 = 40 burrows contain hamsters.
Therefore, the answer is 48 burrows."
"Response:  If Mandy can pay $100 to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, then she should give him $98.40. Here's how I calculated it:

1. Calculate the total amount owed by Mandy after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%:
$100 x (1 + 0.02/12)^3 = $106.75
2. Subtract the initial principal amount ($100) from the total amount owed:
$106.75 - $100 = $6.75
3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of months left in the loan period (in this case, 3 months):
$6.75 / 3 = $98.40

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $98.40 after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%."

"Response:  Mark vil ha 500 norsk kroner (NOK) på en veke, ifølge spørsmålet. Dette kan uttrykkes matematisk som følger:
Mark redigerer 1000 setninger, og forleggjar A betaler han 5 cent per setning. Totalbeløpet forsetningsredigeringen til forleggjar A er derfor 500 NOK (1000 x 0,05).
Siden forleggjar B betaler Mark dobbelt så mykje som forleggjar A, vil totalbeløppet forsetningsredigeringen til forleggjar B være 2 x 500 = 1000 NOK.
Therefore, Mark will have 500 Norwegian krone (NOK) on a week, according to the question. This can be mathematically expressed as follows:
Mark edits 1000 sentences, and publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. The total amount of money earned by Mark from publishing A's content is therefore 500 NOK (1000 x 0.05).
Since publisher B pays Mark double what publisher A pays, the total amount of money earned by Mark from publishing B's content is 2 x 500 = 1000 NOK."

Response:  For å finne ut om Brinley trenger å score 93 on the sixth test to have an average of 93 over the six tests, we need to calculate the average of his scores so far.  The scores he has received are: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 5: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 459 / 5 = 91.8. Since Brinley's current average is above 90, he does not need to score 93 on the sixth test to maintain a 93 average over the six tests.

Response:  To sum up the cost of renting the boats, we need to calculate the total time each person rented the boat and multiply it by the hourly rate. For Carlos, he rented the canoe for 3 hours at $30 per hour, so his total cost is $90 ($30 x 3). For Benji, he rented the banana boat for 5 hours at $18 per hour, so his total cost is $90 ($18 x 5). Therefore, both Carlos and Benji have paid $90 in total for renting the boats.
"Response:  If Andrew plans to take a bus from New Jersey to Rochester and then drive back home from Rochester, the total number of days he will spend on his trip can be calculated as follows:

Day 1: Take the bus from New Jersey to Rochester (6 hours)
Day 2-3: Drive from Rochester to New York City (4 hours each day)
Day 4: Drive from New York City to New Jersey (4 hours)
Total travel time = 6 + 8 + 4 = 18 hours
Therefore, if Andrew plans to take the bus for the first part of his journey and then drive back home, he will need at least 3 days for his trip."

Response:  No, it is not likely that many of the melons were not clear for storage after two weeks. According to the information provided in the problem, only 30% of the melons were ready for harvest after two months, which means that 70% of them were still immature and would not have been suitable for storage. Therefore, it is unlikely that many of the melons were not clear for storage after two weeks.

"Response:  If Dax picked half as many insects as ants in the garden (i.e., if he found 25 ants), and there were originally 50 ants in the garden, then the total number of insects in the garden is:

Total number of insects = Number of ants x 2 + Total number of insects before Dax arrived
= 50 x 2 + 100
= 300

Therefore, there are 300 insects in the garden after Dax picked some."
Response:  Yes, many penguins can hold their breath for a long time. According to the question, about one-third of the penguins jump into the water and swim, while another third go into their burrows and eat dinner. This means that about two-thirds of the penguins are able to survive without needing to surface for air during the day.
"Response:  To calculate the number of tomatoes needed to feed three people for a week, we need to know how many tomatoes Steve is already growing and how much he is able to produce in addition to what he buys from his friend. Let's assume that Steve can grow 6 tomatoes per day and that he wants to have 3 tomatoes per person per day. If there are 7 days in a week, then the total number of tomatoes needed for the week would be:

Tomatoes grown by Steve = 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes
Additional tomatoes bought from friend =?
Total tomatoes needed for the week = 42 +?

To determine the number of additional tomatoes needed, we need to divide the number of tomatoes per person per day (3) by the number of days in the week (7):

Number of additional tomatoes needed = 3 / 7 = 0.43 or approximately 4 tomatoes
Therefore, the total number of tomatoes needed for the week would be:
Total tomatoes needed = 42 + 4 = 46 tomatoes
So, to feed three people for a week, you would need approximately 46 tomatoes."

"Response:  No, they will not be able to read all the books together.

Explanation:

Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book. If Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, they will not be able to read all the books together. This is because there are only three books in total, and they can only read one book at a time. Therefore, the maximum number of books they can read together is 3."
Response:  If Mike can write one page in 5 minutes and 40 seconds, he will have written 3 pages in an hour (60 minutes). Therefore, if he continues writing for 8 hours (480 minutes), he will have written a total of 24 pages (3 x 8 = 24).

Response:  If Griffin initially had 24 pommes frites and Kyle took 5 of them, then Billy took twice as many as Kyle did (since Billy took 10 pommes). Then Ginger gave Griffin an additional haug of pommes frites, which means that Griffin now has 34 pommes frites in total (including the original 24 and the additional haug given by Ginger). Finally, Colby took three pommes frites from Griffin, leaving him with 31 pommes frites in total. So, if Ginger gave Griffin an additional haug of pommes frites, he would have 34 + 6 = 40 pommes frites in total.
Response:  If the number of frogs in the first aquarium is 4 and the number of fish in both aquariums are equal, then there are twice as many fish in the second aquarium as there are frogs in the first aquarium. Therefore, if the number of fish in the first aquarium is x, then the number of fish in the second aquarium is 2x.
Response:  To calculate the total amount of money that makeup artist Jean earned from working on the film, we need to multiply the number of hours worked by her hourly rate. If she worked for 6 days and each day took 6 hours, then she worked a total of 36 hours (6 x 6). Since she was paid $250 per hour, her total earnings can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = Hourly rate x Number of hours worked = $250 x 36 = $9,000. Therefore, Jean earned $9,000 from working on the film.
Response:  Yes, many dollars paid back to the parents. Based on the information given in the question, Isabelle spent a total of $60 on the party (12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 60). Since she shared the cost equally among her three parents, each parent had to pay $20 ($60 / 3 = $20) towards the party expenses. Therefore, the answer is yes, they did pay some money back.
