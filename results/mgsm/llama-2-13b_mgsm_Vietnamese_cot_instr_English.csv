Response:  First, we know that Janet produces 16 eggs per day and she eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.  Next, we know that she sells each egg at $2, so if she sells all 13 eggs, she will earn 13 x $2 = $26 per day.  Therefore, Janet earns $26 per day at the farmer's market.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many meters of blue fabric are needed for one sleeve. Since each sleeve requires 2 cuộn (or 20 yards) of blue fabric, and there are two sleeves in total, we need 40 yards of blue fabric for both sleeves. Now, let's convert this measurement into meters. There are 1 yard = 0.9144 meters, so 40 yards = 36.576 meters. Next, we need to add the length of white fabric required for the body of the áo dài. The question states that half of the white fabric is needed for the body, which means we need 0.5 \* 20 = 10 meters of white fabric. Therefore, the total amount of fabric needed for the áo dài is 36.576 + 10 = 46.576 meters.
Response:  First, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000.  Next, he spent $50,000 to renovate it. So, the total amount of money he invested in the house is: 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 dollars. Now, if the value of the house increased by 150%, then the new value of the house would be: 130,000 x 1.5 = 195,000 dollars. Therefore, Josh made a profit of: 195,000 - 130,000 = 65,000 dollars.
Response: 1) James runs 3 rounds of sprinting per week (3 x 3 = 9). 2) Each round is 60 meters long (9 x 60 = 540). So, in one week, James runs 540 meters.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each goose eats 3 bowls of food per day, so the total amount of food consumed by all 20 geese in one day is:  

3 x 20 = 60 bowls of food per day.  Now, we need to find out how much food Wendi needs to prepare for her geese at the last meal of the day (the evening meal). We know that she gives her geese 15 bowls of food in the morning and 25 bowls of food in the afternoon, so the total amount of food she needs to prepare for the evening meal is:  

15 + 25 = 40 bowls of food. Therefore, Wendi needs to prepare 40 bowls of food for her geese at the last meal of the day."
Response:  First, we know that each liter of the first batch costs $5. So if Kylar buys 16 liters of the first batch, he will have to pay:  16 x $5 = $80  Now, let's consider the second batch. We are told that each liter of the second batch costs 60% of the price of the first batch. Therefore, the cost of one liter of the second batch is:  60% x $5 = $3  Since Kylar wants to buy 16 liters of the second batch as well, he will have to pay:  16 x $3 = $48  In total, Kylar needs to pay:  $80 + $48 = $128
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So if Charleston has x sheep, then Toulouse has 2x sheep. Secondly, we know that Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So if Seattle has y sheep, then Charleston has 4y sheep. Now let's substitute these expressions into our equation:  We want to find out how many sheep Toulouse has, so we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:  Simplifying this equation, we get:  Solving for x (the number of sheep Toulouse has), we get:  Therefore, Toulouse has 20 x 3 = 60 sheep.
Response: 1. Total size of the file is 200 GB. 2. Speed at which Carla can download files is 2 GB/minute (given). 3. Time taken for Windows updates to install = 20 minutes (given). 4. Total time required to download the file = Total size of the file / Download speed ∵ 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes. So it will take Carla approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes to download the entire file if she has to start from scratch after each instance of Windows update installation.
Response:  First, we know that John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour. That means he traveled 3 \* 60 = 180 miles in those three hours. Then, he realized he had forgotten something important and turned back. He spent two hours stuck in traffic, so let's subtract that from his total time: 180 - 2 = 178 miles. Next, we know that he drove the remaining distance at a speed of 30 miles per hour, so he covered: 178 / 30 = 6 miles in one hour. Finally, since he has four hours left to drive, we can multiply the number of miles he covered in one hour by 4 to find out how far he went in total: 6 * 4 = 24 miles. So, after four hours, John was 24 miles away from home.
Response:  First, we know that Eliza works for 40 hours per week at $10 per hour, so her weekly earnings are:  Weekly Earnings = Number of Hours Worked x Wage Per Hour Weekly Earnings = 40 hours x $10/hour = $400 Next, we know that she also works overtime at a rate of 1.2 times her regular hourly wage. So, if she works an additional 5 hours (since she worked 45 hours in total), her overtime pay would be: Overtime Pay = Number of Overtime Hours x Regular Hourly Wage x 1.2 Overtime Pay = 5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 = $60 Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week would be: Total Earnings = Weekly Earnings + Overtime Pay Total Earnings = $400 + $60 = $460
Response:  First month: 60 downloads Second month: 3 times as many downloads = 180 downloads Third month: 70% of 180 downloads = 126 downloads Total downloads for three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of cake. Donuts: 3 dozen x $68/dozen = $204 Cheesecakes: 6 dozen x $55/dozen = $330 Cupcakes: 2 dozen x $80/dozen = $160 Total Cost: $204 + $330 + $160 = $794
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend on planting the tree.  $90 \times 1 = 90$ dollars per year for watering and maintaining the tree.  Next, we need to calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to break even (the point at which he starts making a profit from the tree).  To do this, we need to subtract the cost of maintenance ($90) from the revenue generated by the tree ($1.5 \times 7 = 10.5$ dollars per year):  $10.5 - 90 = -84.5$ dollars per year.  Since Carlos is not earning any profits in the first year, it will take him approximately $\frac{-84.5}{-90} = 5$ years to break even.  Therefore, it will take Carlos 5 years before he can start earning profits from his chili trees.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Melanie has sold three vacuum cleaners - two to the red house and one to the yellow house. So, she has five vacuum cleaners left (5 - 3 = 2). Secondly, we know that she has sold half of her remaining vacuum cleaners to the pink house. Therefore, she has sold half of 2 vacuum cleaners, which is equal to 1 vacuum cleaner. Now, let's add up all the vacuum cleaners she has sold: 2 + 1 = 3. So, Melanie started with 5 vacuum cleaners and sold 3 of them.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 students in total and 20% of them do contemporary dance, which is equal to 4 (20 x 0.2). Secondly, 25% of them do jazz dance, which is equal to 5 (20 x 0.25). Finally, we need to find out how many of them do hip-hop dance. To do this, we subtract the number of students who do contemporary and jazz dances from the total number of students. So, the number of students who do hip-hop dance is: Total - (Contemporary + Jazz) = 20 - (4 + 5) = 20 - 9 = 11. Therefore, 11% of the total number of students (or 11/20 x 100%) do hip-hop dance.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the expected growth rate of each market based on the given information. For the jewelry market, the expected growth rate is 2.5%. For the electronics market, the expected growth rate is 1.2%. Next, we need to determine the current value of each investment option. The cost of the jewelry is $5,000, and the cost of the electronics is $8,000. Now, let's calculate the expected profit for each investment option. For the jewelry market, the expected profit can be calculated as follows: Expected Profit = (Current Value x Growth Rate) - Cost Current Value = $5,000 Growth Rate = 2.5% Expected Profit = ($5,000 x 2.5%) - $5,000 = $125 - $5,000 = $497.50 For the electronics market, the expected profit can be calculated as follows: Expected Profit = (Current Value x Growth Rate) - Cost Current Value = $8,000 Growth Rate = 1.2% Expected Profit = ($8,000 x 1.2%) - $8,000 = $96 - $8,000 = $312 Finally, we need to compare the expected profits of both investment options to determine which one would provide the highest return. Based on the calculations above, the expected profit from investing in jewelry is higher than that of electronics. Therefore, if the goal is to maximize profits, it would be better to choose the jewelry investment option.
Response:  First day, they traveled west for 80 miles. Second day, they traveled north for 150 miles. Total distance = (west + north) miles. Total distance = (80 + 150) miles. Total distance = 230 miles. So each train traveled 230 miles in two days.
Response:  First, we know that Jill earns $20 per hour as a tutor and $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. Next, we need to calculate how many hours she works each week. She works 35 hours per week as a teacher and 15 hours per week as a cheerleading coach. Therefore, her total weekly hours are: Total Weekly Hours = 35 + 15 = 50 hours/week Now, let's calculate her annual salary based on these weekly hours. Annual Salary = Total Weekly Hours x Number of Weeks Worked per Year Number of Weeks Worked per Year = 50 weeks/year (since there are 50 weeks in a year) Annual Salary = 50 x 50 = $25,000 per year As a tutor, Jill earns $20 per hour, so her annual salary from tutoring is: Tutoring Income = $20/hour x 35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = $35,000 per year As a cheerleading coach, Jill earns $30 per hour, so her annual salary from coaching is: Coaching Income = $30/hour x 15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = $15,000 per year Therefore, Jill's total annual income is: Total Annual Income = $25,000 (from tutoring) + $15,000 (from coaching) = $40,000 per year
Response:  First, we know that Claire lays 3 eggs per day.  Second, we know that there are 7 days in a week.  Therefore, Claire lays 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week.  Now, we want to find out how many eggs Claire will lay in 4 weeks.  So, we multiply 21 (eggs/week) by 4 (weeks): 21 x 4 = 84 eggs.  So, Claire will lay 84 eggs in 4 weeks.
Response:  First, we know that Marissa can walk at a rate of 4 miles per hour for the first 4 miles, since she takes 1 hour to cover this distance.  Next, we know that she walks at a rate of 2 miles per hour for the remaining 8 miles, since she takes another hour to cover this distance.  Therefore, her average speed over the entire 12-mile journey is: (4 + 2) / 2 = 3 miles/hour.
Response:  First, we know that 2/3 of 10 liters is equal to 6.67 liters (since 2/3 x 10 = 6.67).  So, if we add 6.67 liters of water from the first jug to the second jug, we will have a total of 16.67 liters in the second jug (since 15 + 6.67 = 16.67).  Now, let's find out how much water is left in the first jug. We know that 1 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters (since 1 - 6.67 = 3.33).  Therefore, there are 3.33 liters of water left in the first jug.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond must be 31 + 6 = 37 years old.  Secondly, we are told that Raymond has a son who is 23 years old. Therefore, we can deduce that the son was born when Raymond was 23 - 6 = 17 years old.  So, the son was born 31 - 17 = 14 years ago.
Response: 1st customer buys 1 DVD, 2nd and 3rd customers buy 2 DVDs each = total of 6 DVDs sold to first three customers. Last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs. Total number of DVDs sold = 6 + 0 = 6. So, Billy has sold 6 DVDs on Tuesday.
Response:  First, we know that one candle burns for 1 hour and melts 2 cm of wax. So if we light the candle at 1 pm and let it burn until 5 pm (4 hours), how much wax will be melted in total?  We can calculate this as follows:  Total wax melted = Number of hours x Amount of wax per hour  Total wax melted = 4 hours x 2 cm/hour  Total wax melted = 8 cm  Therefore, after burning for 4 hours from 1 pm to 5 pm, the candle will have melted a total of 8 cm of wax.
Response:  First, we know that the discounted price of the book is $19.50. Second, we know that the discount rate is 25%. Third, we can calculate the original price of the book as follows: Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount rate) = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00 So, the original price of the book was $26.00 before the discount.
Response:  First, we know that Marie spent $50 in total.  Second, we know that she bought a chicken for $12, which means she has $50 - $12 = $38 left to spend. Third, we know that each box of milk costs $3, so she can buy at most $38 / $3 = 12 boxes of milk. Fourth, we know that each apple costs $1.50, so she can buy at most $38 / $1.50 = 25 apples. Finally, we know that each pizza costs $8.50, so she can buy at most $38 / $8.50 = 4.5 pizzas. Therefore, Marie bought 12 boxes of milk, 25 apples, and 4.5 pizzas.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Mishka spent on each pair of shoes. There are three pairs of shoes, so she spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes. Next, we need to calculate how much money Mishka spent on each pair of pants. There are three pairs of pants, and each pair costs $16.50, so she spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on pants. Finally, we add up all the amounts that Mishka spent on each item to find out how much she spent in total: $126 + $49.50 = $175.50. So, Mishka spent $175.50 on her clothes.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Cynthia spends on face cream each night. We know that she uses 1/15 of a jar each night, so she spends $4.00 / 15 = $0.27 per night on face cream.  Now, let's calculate how much money Cynthia spends in total over 60 days. There are 30 days in April and 30 days in May, so we can calculate the total amount spent as follows: Total amount spent = Number of days x Amount spent per day Total amount spent = (30 + 30) x $0.27 Total amount spent = 60 x $0.27 Total amount spent = $16.20 Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.20 on face cream over 60 days.
Response:  First, we know that Henry stopped for the first time after traveling 20 miles. Second, we know he stopped again 15 miles before the end of his trip. Third, we want to find out how many miles he traveled between these two stops. To do this, we can subtract the distance from the second stop (15 miles) from the total distance he traveled (60 miles): 60 - 15 = 45 miles. So, Henry traveled 45 miles between his first and second stops.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that one pair of shoes costs $33 and the other pair is twice as much. So, if we let x be the cost of the second pair, then we can write an equation based on this information:  
x = 2(33) = 2 x 33 = 66  Therefore, the cost of the second pair of shoes is $66. Now, we need to find out how much the first pair of shoes costs compared to the second pair. We know that the difference between the two pairs is $66 - $33 = $33. So, the first pair of shoes costs $33 less than the second pair, which means its cost is:  
First pair = Second pair - $33 = $66 - $33 = $33"
Response:  First, we know that Darrel is 7 years older than Allen. So if Allen is x years old, then Darrel is x + 7 years old. We also know that the sum of their ages is 162 years. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: x + (x + 7) = 162. Combine like terms: 2x + 7 = 162. Subtract 7 from both sides: 2x = 155. Divide both sides by 2: x = 77.5. Since ages cannot be half years, round down to the nearest whole number: x = 77. Therefore, Allen is 77 years old and Darrel is 77 + 7 = 84 years old.
Response:  First, we know that there are 80 people according to one person.  Next, another person says that there are 20 more than half of the first number, which is 20 + (half of 80) = 20 + 40 = 60.  Finally, a third person says that there are 25% more than the first number, which is 125% of 80 = 100.  So, the total number of people in the basket is 100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each dog needs 0.5 hours of care per day, so if John has 10 dogs, he will spend 0.5 x 10 = 5 hours per day caring for them. Since there are 7 days in a week, John will spend a total of 5 x 7 = 35 hours per week caring for his dogs.
"Response:  First, we know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  Second, we know that she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So if she has x silver coins, she must have 30 + x gold coins.  Now, let's set up an equation based on this information.  We can write ""x"" as the variable for the number of silver coins.  The equation would be:  30 + x = 110  To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:  30 + x - 30 = 110 - 30  x = 80  Therefore, Gretchen has 80 silver coins and 30 + 80 = 110 gold coins."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's beads, which is equal to 5 + (1/2) x 40 = 5 + 20 = 25 beads.  Now, we are given that Siobhan has more than twice as many beads as Aaron, so she must have at least 2 x 25 = 50 beads.  Therefore, Siobhan has 50 beads.
Response:  First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. So, if we multiply 4 by 1 (since there are no minutes), we get 4 points for the first 20 minutes. Now, let's look at the second part of the problem. We know that in the last 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more than he did in the first 20 minutes. This means that if he scored x points in the first 20 minutes, he scored x + (25/100)x = x + 25/100x = 1.25x points in the last 20 minutes. Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is: Total points = 4 + 1.25x Since we want to find out how many points Mike scored in total, we set up the equation as follows: 4 + 1.25x = Total points To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 1.25x = Total points - 4 Total points - 4 = 1.25x Now, we need to find out what value of x will make this equation true. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.25: x = Total points - 4 / 1.25 x = (Total points - 4) / 1.25 Since we know that Total points = 4 + 1.25x, we can substitute this into the previous equation: x = (4 + 1.25x) / 1.25 x = (4 + x) / 1.25 Solving for x gives us: x = 6 So, Mike scored a total of 6 points.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Terry spends on yogurt per day. There are 3 types of yogurt with different prices, so let's consider each type separately.  Type A - $5/cup Type B - $4/cup Type C - $3/cup Since Terry consumes 2 cups of yogurt per day, his daily expense can be calculated as follows: Type A: 2 x $5 = $10 Type B: 2 x $4 = $8 Type C: 2 x $3 = $6 Total daily expense: $10 + $8 + $6 = $24 Now, let's calculate Terry's total monthly expense for 30 days. Multiply the daily expense by 30: $24 x 30 = $720 So, Terry spends $720 on yogurt in 30 days.
Response:  First, we know that John sold all of his Lego sets for $15 each, so he made a total of 13 x $15 = $195 from selling his Lego sets.  Next, we know that he spent $20 per game, and he bought 8 games, so he spent $20 x 8 = $160 on games.  Finally, we know that he had $195 - $160 = $35 left over after buying all the games.  So, he has $35 worth of Lego sets left.  To find out how many Lego sets he has left, we can divide $35 by the price of one set: $35 / $15 = 2.33. Since you cannot have a fraction of a Lego set, John has 2 complete Lego sets left.
Response:  First, we know that John runs for 3 hours on the first day of each week and then runs for half a day (i.e., 3/2 = 1.5 hours) on the remaining two days. So, in total, he runs for 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 hours per week. Now, let's calculate how far he can run in one week: Distance = Speed x Time So, if his speed is constant, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time Therefore, the distance John can run in one week is: Distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/week Since John runs for 4.5 hours per week, we can calculate his average speed as follows: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 100 km / 4.5 h = 22.22 km/hour Therefore, John can run at an average speed of 22.22 kilometers per hour.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dana can run at four times her walking speed, so if she walks for one hour, she can run for half an hour (since there are six hours in total).  Secondly, we know that Dana can jump with a speed of three miles per hour, so if she jumps for one hour, she will cover three miles.  Now, let's calculate how far Dana can go in six hours if she spends half of her time running and the other half walking:  If Dana runs for half an hour, she covers four times her walking distance, which is two miles (since she walks for one mile in one hour).  Therefore, in six hours, Dana can run for three hours (180 minutes) and walk for three hours (180 minutes), covering a total distance of:  Running distance = 3 x 4 x 60 = 72 miles Walking distance = 3 x 1 x 60 = 18 miles Total distance = 72 + 18 = 90 miles So, Dana can go 90 miles in six hours if she spends half of her time running and the other half walking.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the old iPhones are being compared in terms of their age, and the ratio of their ages is given as 4:2. This means that the age of Brandon's old iPhone is four times the age of Ben's old iPhone. Now, we also know that Suzy's old iPhone is half the age of Ben's old iPhone. So, if Suzy's old iPhone is one year old, then Ben's old iPhone would be two years old. Therefore, Brandon's old iPhone would be four times two, which is eight years old.
Response:  First, we know that Polly can throw the golden spear (which is the only weapon known to be able to pierce the dragon's scales) for a distance of 400 feet.  Second, we know that when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the golden spear three times farther than usual.  Third, we are given that the dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet.  So if Polly stands at the foot of the mountain and throws the golden spear while holding the sapphire gemstone, how far away from her will the dragon be engulfed in flames?  To solve this problem, we need to find out how much farther Polly can throw the golden spear with the sapphire gemstone compared to without it.  We know that she can throw it three times farther, so we can set up a proportion:  With sapphire gemstone: 400 x 3 = 1200 feet Without sapphire gemstone: 400 feet Now we need to find out how far away from Polly the dragon will be engulfed in flames based on the distance she throws the golden spear.  Since the dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet, we know that Polly needs to throw the golden spear at least 1000 - 400 = 600 feet to ensure that the dragon is fully engulfed in flames.  Therefore, the answer is 600 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 cakes in total and each cake is cut into 8 pieces. So, the number of pieces of cake = 5 x 8 = 40 pieces.  Now, we know that after serving all the guests, there were 14 leftover pieces of cake. Therefore, the number of pieces of cake taken by the guests can be calculated as follows: Number of pieces of cake taken by guests = Total number of pieces of cake - Number of leftover pieces of cake  Number of pieces of cake taken by guests = 40 - 14 = 26 pieces.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one serving of french fries (250 calories) contains 5 parts. Therefore, if we want to calculate how many grams of french fries we can eat within our daily calorie goal of 2000 calories, we need to divide our daily calorie intake by the number of calories in one serving of french fries.  So, let's do it!  2000 / 250 = 8  Now, we have found out that we can eat 8 servings of french fries within our daily calorie goal. However, we are given that there are 300g of french fries in each serving, so we need to convert the number of servings from 8 to grams. 8 x 300g = 2400g  Therefore, we can eat up to 2400g of french fries within our daily calorie goal of 2000 calories.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie can make 10 candles with one pound of wax. So if he wants to sell each candle for $2.00, how much money will he get in total?  Secondly, we need to calculate the cost price of making one candle. We know that the cost of one pound of wax is $10.00 and he needs ten pounds of wax to make 10 candles. Therefore, the total cost price of making 10 candles is $10 x 10 = $100. Now let's calculate the profit. Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost Price Profit = $200 (Total Revenue) - $100 (Total Cost Price) Profit = $100 per 10 candles or $2.00 per candle.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meredith spends 4 hours per day writing her blog posts. Secondly, she wrote 5 posts on Monday and twice as many posts on Tuesday (so 2 \* 5 = 10 posts). Finally, on Thursday, she doubled the number of posts she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 \* 10 = 20 posts. Therefore, in total, Meredith spent 4 hours per day \* 3 days = 12 hours writing blog posts during those three days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Candice had 80 sheets of paper in her bag before she went to work at the cafe. Secondly, we know that she used 220 sheets of paper for each cup of coffee, so she needed 23 x 220 = 4960 sheets of paper in total. Finally, we are given that she bought a pack of Post-its with 23 pieces, so we can calculate how many sheets of paper were left over as follows: 80 - 4960 + 23 = 751 sheets of paper left over. Therefore, there were 751 sheets of paper left over after Candice finished working at the cafe.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John spent $200 on blue cups and each cup costs $40. So he bought: 200/40 = 5 cups of blue color. Now, let's calculate how much he spent on red cups. We know that the price of one red cup is twice the price of one blue cup, so the price of one red cup is: 2 x 40 = 80. Therefore, John spent: 200 - (5 x 40) = 200 - 200 = 0 on red cups.  So, John spent a total of $200 on both blue and red cups.
Response:  We know that Tracy has a rope of length 4 feet and she cut it into pieces of equal length (6 inches). So we can start with the fact that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 4 feet are equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Now, since each piece of rope is 6 inches long, we can divide 48 inches by 6 to get the number of pieces: 48 / 6 = 8. So Tracy has 8 pieces of rope.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 floors in total and each floor has 8 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments is 15 x 8 = 120.  Next, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that only 3/4 x 120 = 90 apartments are occupied. So, the total number of vacant apartments is 120 - 90 = 30.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lloyd earns per day from selling eggs. We know that he sells 252 eggs per day at $2 each, so his daily income is:  

$2 x 252 = $504 per day  
Now, let's calculate how much money Lloyd earns per week. There are 7 days in a week, so:  

$504 x 7 = $3,528 per week  
Finally, let's calculate how much money Lloyd earns per month. There are 4 weeks in a month (ignoring any fraction of a week), so:  

$3,528 x 4 = $14,096 per month"
Response:  First, we know that Tom can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 1-4 hours. So, he will cover a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x (1-4) hours = 10 x (1-4) miles We need to find out how far Tom has traveled in total. Since he is returning at a speed of 6 miles per hour, we can use the formula: Total distance = Distance + Speed x Time Total distance = 10 x (1-4) miles + 6 x time To find the time it takes for Tom to return, we can set up an equation using the information given: 6 miles/hour x time = Total distance - 10 x (1-4) miles Time = Total distance / (Speed x Hours) Time = (Total distance - 10 x (1-4) miles) / (6 miles/hour x 1 hour) Using the values we have found, we get: Time = (10 x (1-4) miles + 6 x time) / (6 miles/hour x 1 hour) Substituting the values, we get: Time = (10 x (1-4) miles + 6 x 2) / (6 miles/hour x 1 hour) Time = (10 x 3 miles + 6 x 2) / (6 miles/hour x 1 hour) Time = 9 miles / (6 miles/hour x 1 hour) Time = 9 / 6 Time = 1.5 hours Therefore, Tom will take 1.5 hours to return to his starting point.
Response:  First, we know that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so 30 comic books will weigh: 30 x (1/4) = 7 1/2 pounds.  Next, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so if Uriah wants to reduce his load by 5 kilograms (or 5,000 grams), he needs to subtract: 5,000 - 7 1/2 = 4,992 1/2 grams.  Therefore, Uriah should bring 4,992 1/2 grams of toys.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of repairing each type of tire for both days.  For Thursday (Day 5), there are 6 lorry tires and 4 car tires that need to be repaired, so the total cost is:  6 x 60 = 360 + 4 x 40 = 160 = 520  Next, let's move on to Friday (Day 6). There are 12 cars that need to be repaired, but no lorry tires need to be fixed. So the total cost is just:  12 x 40 = 480  Now, let's add up the total costs for both days:  520 + 480 = 1000  Finally, we can find out how much profit the workshop made on the day with higher income by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. According to the problem, the total revenue was not given, so we cannot determine the profit yet. We only know that the profit is greater than zero because the total cost is less than or equal to the total revenue. Therefore, our final answer is:  The workshop made more than 1000 dollars in profit on the day with higher income.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Patchy has had three litters of kittens, so she must have given birth to at least three kittens in each litter. Therefore, Patchy has had three times three = nine kittens in total.  Secondly, we know that Trixie has had twelve kittens in one litter, so she must have also had at least one previous litter before that. Therefore, Trixie has had twelve + one = thirteen kittens in total.  Now let's add up all the kittens from both Patchy and Trixie: nine + thirteen = twenty-two kittens in total. So, the Doubtfire family has twenty-two kittens!
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jean has 30 pieces of candy and she eats 2 pieces, so now she has 30 - 2 = 28 pieces left.  Next, we want to pack these remaining candies into bags. Since each bag contains 2 pieces of candy, we can calculate how many bags Jean can make using her remaining candies as follows:  
Number of bags = Total number of candies / Number of candies per bag  Number of bags = 28 / 2  Number of bags = 14  Therefore, Jean can make 14 bags with her remaining 28 pieces of candy."
Response:  First, we know that Peter has $42 per week and he spends $7 for each movie ticket. So, if he wants to go see a movie, how many times can he go?  We can start by dividing his weekly allowance by the cost of one movie ticket:  $42 / $7 =?  How many times can Peter go see a movie with his weekly allowance?
Response:  First, we know that each crate weighs 15 pounds and there are $x$ crates in total. So, the total weight of all the crates is $15x$ pounds.  Next, we know that the total weight of the driver and the empty truck is $3755$ pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight of the crates plus the weight of the driver and the empty truck must be less than or equal to $5000$.  Now, let's set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:  $\boxed{15x + 3755 \leq 5000}$  Simplifying this equation, we get:  $\boxed{15x \leq 1245}$  Solving for $x$, we get:  $\boxed{x \leq 83}$  Therefore, the maximum number of crates that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is $83$.
Response:  First, we know that the total cost of the groceries is $40. Next, we know that there is a 25% service charge added to the total cost, which is $40 x 25% = $10. So, the new total cost with the service charge is $40 + $10 = $50. Finally, Stephen adds a $4 tip, so the final cost including the tip is $50 + $4 = $54. Therefore, the final cost of Stephen's groceries is $54.
"Response:  First, we know that each cluster has 20 fruits and there are 6 clusters in total. So, the total number of fruits in all clusters is:  
20 x 6 = 120 fruits  
Now, we need to add the remaining fruits that are not in any cluster. We know that there are 67 fruits that are scattered randomly on the tree. To find out how many fruits are scattered, let's divide the total number of fruits by the number of fruits per cluster:  
120 / 20 = 6 clusters + (67 - 20) = 6 clusters + 47 fruits  
Therefore, the total number of fruits on the tree is:  
120 + 47 = 167 fruits"
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 apples in total and 1 apple is bad, so the number of good apples is 25 - 1 = 24.  Secondly, we know that 20% of the apples are not ripe, so the number of unripe apples is 24 x 0.2 = 4.8 (since 0.2 is the proportion of unripe apples). Therefore, the number of ripe apples is 24 - 4.8 = 19.2. Finally, we know that 2 apples are spoiled, so the number of good apples is 19.2 - 2 = 17.2. So, there are 17.2 good apples out of 25 apples in total.
Response:  First, we know that Janet paid $500 for the materials to make the ring.  Next, she paid $800 to the jeweler to craft it.  Finally, she paid an additional amount (which we don't know yet) for insurance.  So, in total, Janet spent:  $500 + $800 + [$X] = Total Cost To find the total cost, we need to add up all of these amounts.  In this case, the total cost is:  $500 + $800 + $X = $1300 + $X Where X is the cost of the insurance policy.  We are not given enough information to determine what X is, so we can't calculate the final answer.  However, if we assume that the insurance policy costs 10% of the total cost (as mentioned in the problem), then we can estimate the final answer as follows:  $1300 + $X = $1300 + ($1300 \* 0.10) = $1300 + $130 = $1430 Therefore, the final answer is approximately $1430.
Response:  First, we know that Marcy will receive an annual pension of $50,000 starting after 20 years of service.  Second, we know that she has the right to receive 5% of the value of her pension each year beginning after 20 years of service.  Finally, we know that if she retires after 30 years of service, her annual pension will be reduced by $10,000 for every year she is retired before age 65.  Using this information, we can calculate Marcy's annual pension as follows:  If Marcy retires after 30 years of service and receives a reduced pension, her annual pension will be:  Pension = $50,000 x (1 - (Number of years retired before age 65 / Total number of years served))  Since Marcy is retiring 10 years before age 65, she will be retired for 20 years (65 - 45).  Therefore, her annual pension will be:  Pension = $50,000 x (1 - (20/30))  Pension = $50,000 x 0.67  Pension = $33,500 per year  So, if Marcy retires after 30 years of service, her annual pension will be $33,500.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Aleena pays $140 per month for her online streaming service. Secondly, we are told that if she had paid for the first half of the year (6 months), then she would have paid $140 x 6 = $840. Thirdly, we are given that the company charges her less in the second half of the year, specifically 10% less than what she paid in the first half. So, in the second half of the year, Aleena will pay $840 x 0.9 = $756. Therefore, the total amount Aleena has paid for the entire year is $840 + $756 = $1,596.
"Response:  First, we know that Sophia has already driven 160 km since her last fill-up and needs an additional 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank completely. This means she has used 160 - 4 = 156 km of gas so far. Since her car's fuel tank can hold 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate how much farther she can drive as follows:  
12 gallons - 156 km =?  To solve for the unknown distance (d), we can subtract 156 from 12:  
12 - 156 = d  Simplifying, we get:  
d = 12 - 156 = 0 So, Sophia can drive 0 more kilometers with her current amount of gas. In other words, she is out of gas and cannot drive any further."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then sleeps for half of the remaining time. So he spends 2 hours + (1/2) \* (2 - 2) = 2 hours + (1/2) \* 0 = 2 hours + 0 = 2 hours per day on these activities. Therefore, in 4 weeks, he will spend 2 hours/day \* 4 days/week = 8 hours/week watching TV and sleeping.
Response:  Firstly, each school has sent one female and one male basketball team with five players in each team. Therefore, the total number of students sent by each school is 6 (5 players + 1 coach). Since there are four schools, the total number of students sent to all schools is 4 x 6 = 24.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 175 diamonds in total. Secondly, we know that there are fewer than 35 rubies in the box because it is stated ""ít hơn"" which means less than. Finally, we know that there are twice as many sapphires as rubies. Therefore, if there are x rubies in the box, then there will be 2x sapphires. Now let's set up an equation based on this information:  175 = x + (2x)  175 = 3x  3x = 175  3 = x   So, there are 3 rubies in the box.  And since there are twice as many sapphires as rubies, there will be 6 sapphires in the box.  Total number of precious stones in the box: 3 rubies + 6 sapphires = 9"
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 60 girls in total and each teacher has 5 students. So, if we divide 60 by 5, we get: 60/5 = 12 Therefore, there must be 12 teachers to accommodate all the girls.
Response:  First, we know that Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so she will receive a total of: 5 x 8 = 40 dollars.  Next, we are told that at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. So, if we subtract the amount she received from the total, we get: 100 - 40 = 60.  Therefore, Bailey starts with $60.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many classes Judy teaches each day of the week.  Monday through Friday, she teaches 5 classes per day x 7 days = 35 classes per week. On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. Total number of classes per week = 35 + 8 = 43 classes per week. Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Judy earns per week. If there are 15 students in each class and she charges $15 per student, then her weekly income is: 43 classes x 15 students per class = 645 students per week x $15 per student = $9,675 per week.
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 steps and the second one has twice as many steps (gấp đôi), then the second recipe will have 40 steps in total.  Therefore, if Kelian wants to prepare both meals, she needs to read through 60 steps of instructions in total (20 for the first recipe + 40 for the second).
Response:  First, we know that Tommy is selling brownies for $3 each and pancakes for $4 each. Next, we are given that Tommy sold 43 brownies and 23 pancakes. Finally, we need to find out how much money Tommy made in total. So let's start with the calculation for the brownies first:  43 x $3 = $130 Now, let's calculate the amount of money Tommy made from the pancakes:  23 x $4 = $92 Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy made is: $130 + $92 = $222
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Sheila will pay for all three phones over the course of three months. We know that each phone costs $150 and there are three phones, so the total cost is: Total Cost = 3 x $150 = $450 Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment for each phone. Since Sheila is paying over three months, she will make three payments of equal amounts. The monthly payment for each phone can be calculated as follows: Monthly Payment = Total Cost / Number of Payments Monthly Payment = $450 / 3 Monthly Payment = $150 per month So, Sheila will pay $150 per month for each of the three phones over the course of three months.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Artie will make from each type of flower he is selling.  Hoa nhung: 12 x 2.74 = 33.08  Hoa cỏ: 9 x 1.87 = 16.83  Hoa bạch tuộc: 17 x 2.12 = 35.04  Now, let's add up all the amounts that Artie will make:  Total amount = 33.08 + 16.83 + 35.04 = 85.05  So, if Artie sells 12 chậu ngọc, 9 chậu hoa cỏ, and 17 chậu hoa bạch tuộc, he will earn $85.05.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each floor of the sandcastle has half the area of the previous floor. So if the top floor has an area of 16 square meters, then the second floor will have half that area, or 8 square meters. The first floor will have half the area of the second floor, which is 4 square meters. And finally, the ground floor will have half the area of the first floor, which is 2 square meters. Therefore, the average area of one floor is: (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5 square meters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 180 days worth of food in its first year. Since each bag contains 110 servings, she will need:  180 days x 2 servings/day = 360 servings   Therefore, Cecilia will use 360/110 = 3.27 bags of food in the first year.
"Response:  First, we know that Sarah can do 4 times as much work as David in one day, so if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then David will do 4 x 400 = 1600 pounds of laundry.  Now, let's consider how much Raymond can do. We know that he can only do half as much work as Sarah, so if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then Raymond will do half of that, which is 200 pounds.  Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is:  

1600 - 200 = 1400 pounds."
"Response:  First, we need to find out how much money Vincent will save if he buys 18 roses with the better price.  To do this, we need to calculate the cost of 1 rose in each package.  In the first package (3 roses for $2.50), the cost of one rose is: 

$2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per rose 

In the second package (2 roses for $1.00), the cost of one rose is: 

$1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per rose 

Now that we have found the cost of one rose in each package, we can compare them and see which option saves more money.  To do this, we need to subtract the cost of one rose from the other: 

$0.83 - $0.50 = $0.33 per rose 

So, if Vincent buys 18 roses, he will save: 

$0.33 x 18 = $6.44 

by choosing the first package instead of the second one."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of grooming without any discount is $100. Secondly, if John is a new customer, he will receive a 30% discount. So, the amount he needs to pay after the discount is: $100 x (1 - 0.3) = $70. Therefore, the final cost of grooming for John's dog is $70.
Response:  First, we know that each girl has 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 24 / 6 = 4 liters per girl.  Now, if one boy takes 6 liters of water, how much water will be left for the girls?  To find out, we need to subtract the amount of water taken by the boy from the total amount of water available.  So, we can say:  4 liters (for each girl) - 6 liters (taken by the boy) =?  Can you solve this subtraction problem and tell me the answer?
"Response:  First, Charlie had 10 sheets of paper. Then he bought 21 more sheets from a store and received 23 sheets in total as a gift for his birthday. So, Charlie has a total of:  
Charlie has = 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 sheets of paper. Next, we know that Charlie gave 9 sheets to his sister, so he has:  
Charlie has = 54 - 9 = 45 sheets of paper left. Finally, we are told that Charlie used 28 sheets to decorate a scrapbook, so he has:  
Charlie has = 45 - 28 = 17 sheets of paper left. Therefore, Charlie has 17 sheets of paper left after decorating the scrapbook."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Grace weighs 40 kg. Secondly, we are told that Alex is four times heavier than Grace. So, if Grace weighs 40 kg, then Alex will weigh 4 x 40 = 160 kg. Finally, we need to convert both weights from kilograms to pounds. There are 2.2 pounds in 1 kilogram, so: Grace weighs 40 kg x 2.2 lb/kg = 88 lb Alex weighs 160 kg x 2.2 lb/kg = 352 lb Therefore, the maximum weight of the two children in pounds is 88 + 352 = 440 lb.
Response:  First, we know that each tree has 25 flowers.  Each flower has 8 petals. So, to find out how many petals in total, we multiply 25 (trees) x 8 (petals per flower): Total number of petals = 25 x 8 = 200 petals.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the team has played 22 games and won more than 8 times. This means they have won at least 9 games (since 8 + 1 = 9). Now, let's calculate how many games they lost. We can do this by subtracting the number of wins from the total number of games played: 22 - 9 = 13. So, the team lost 13 games.
"Response:  First, we know that each shirt represents one year of vacation.  There are four years in total (since he has been going on vacation every year since he was 23). So, there are four ""blocks"" or ""pieces"" of fabric.  Next, we know that each block is made up of different fabrics from different years. Therefore, we need to find out how many fabrics there are in total.  We can do this by adding up all the numbers of years that Gene has gone on vacation:  2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14  So, there are 14 different fabrics in total. Finally, we need to find out how many shirts Gene has in total. Since each shirt is made up of one piece of fabric, and there are 14 pieces of fabric in total, we can simply multiply 14 by 1 to get our final answer:  14 x 1 = 14  So, Gene has 14 shirts in total."
Response:  First, we know that the alarm rang four times the first day (lần thứ nhất).  Second, it rang three times longer than the previous time (lần thứ hai), which means it rang for 3 x 3 = 9 times longer.  Therefore, the total number of rings for the second day is 4 + 9 = 13 times.  Third, it rang half as long as the previous day (lần thứ ba), which means it rang for half of 13 times, or 6.5 times.  So, the total number of rings for all three days is 4 + 13 + 6.5 = 23.5 times.
Response:  First, we know that Sylvie has been working for the company for 5 years as of December last year. Therefore, her starting salary is $600 per month x 12 months = $7,200 per year.  Next, we know that the company increases its employees' salaries by 10% each year. So after one year, Sylvie's salary will be $7,200 x 1.1 = $7,920 per year.  Now let's look at how much Sylvie's salary will increase each subsequent year based on the same formula:  Year 2: $7,920 x 1.1 = $8,704 per year  Year 3: $8,704 x 1.1 = $9,574 per year  Year 4: $9,574 x 1.1 = $10,493 per year  Year 5 (current): $10,493 x 1.1 = $11,552 per year  So, if Sylvie continues to work for the company for another 3 years, her annual salary will be $11,552 per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harald. So if Marilyn sold x records, Harald sold 10x = 10x(x) = 10xx = 10x. Now we are given that Marilyn sold 88,000 records. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  88,000 = 10x  To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:  8,800 = x  So, Harald sold 8,800 records.
"Response:  First, we know that there will be 16 guests at the party and each guest will receive 75 gifts (since 1/4 of the guests won't show up). So, in total, Christina needs to buy:  
16 guests x 75 gifts = 1200 gifts  
Since each gift costs $2, Christina needs to spend:  
1200 gifts x $2 per gift = $2400  
Therefore, Christina needs to budget $2400 for the party."
Response:  First, we know that one adult will eat 10 pounds of salad, and one child will eat half as much. So, for every adult, we need to prepare 10 pounds of salad, and for every child, we need to prepare 5 pounds of salad. Now, let's calculate how many pounds of salad we need in total. If there are 20 adults and 5 children attending the picnic, we have: 20 x 10 = 200 pounds of salad for adults + 5 x 5 = 25 pounds of salad for children Total: 225 pounds of salad needed.
Response: 1) Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. So if Marcia has two pets, Jan has six pets (2 x 3 = 6). 2) Each of Marcia's pets has two more pets than Cindy. So if Cindy has four pets, Marcia has six pets (4 + 2 = 6), and Jan has twelve pets (6 + 2 x 3 = 12). Therefore, Cindy has four pets, Marcia has six pets, and Jan has twelve pets.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Amy is older than Jackson by 5 years and younger than Corey by 2 years. So, if Amy is x years old, then Jackson is (x - 5) years old. Secondly, we know that James is 10 years old and younger than Corey by 1 year. Therefore, Corey is (10 + 1) = 11 years old. Now, let's substitute the values we have found into the equation: Jackson's age = (Amy's age - 5) Since Amy is 8 years old, we can substitute this value in: Jackson's age = (8 - 5) = 3 years old.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds. Secondly, we are given that Gerald has improved his running speed by 10% after changing his diet. So, to find out how many seconds Gerald takes to run 400 meters, we need to calculate 10% of 38 seconds.  
10% of 38 = 3.8 (rounded to the nearest second)  Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters in 38 + 3.8 = 41.8 seconds."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are fewer rabbits than dogs and cats in the neighborhood. So if there are x rabbits, then there must be at least 12x more dogs and cats (since there are 12 times as many dogs and cats as rabbits).  Secondly, for every dog, there are two cats. So if there are 60 dogs, there are 60 x 2 = 120 cats.  Finally, since there are fewer rabbits than dogs and cats, we can say that x < 120.  Putting it all together, we get:  x + 12x < 120 + 120  = 240  Simplifying, we get: 13x < 240  Divide both sides by 13: x < 18  Therefore, there are at most 18 rabbits in the neighborhood.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 200 students in total and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is 2 x 200 / 5 = 40. Now, we know that 2/3 of the remaining students (girls) participate in the team. Therefore, the number of girls who do not participate is: 200 - (2 x 200 / 3) = 200 - 66.67 = 133.33. Thus, there are 133 girls who do not participate in the team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night. Secondly, we know that James slept for only 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, if we can find out how many hours James slept, we can compare it to Harry's sleep and determine how much more Harry slept.  To find out how many hours James slept, we need to divide Harry's sleep time by 3 (since James slept for 2/3 of Harry's sleep).  Therefore, James slept for:  9 hours / 3 = 3 hours  Now we have both amounts of sleep, so let's compare them:  9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours  Harry slept for 6 hours more than James.
Response:  First, we know that each bottle of sauce contains three quarts of cucumbers.  So if Freda made 32 ounces of pickled sauce, she must have used (32 / 3) = 10 quarts of cucumbers.  Therefore, Freda used 10 quarts of cucumbers to make her final batch of pickled sauce.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 30 cars on the highway at first. Secondly, 15 minutes into the traffic jam, some cars passed through (we don't know how many). Thirdly, after another 15 minutes, 20 more cars passed through. Finally, 5 cars turned back because they didn't want to drive through the traffic jam. So, let's start with the number of cars that passed through in the first 15 minutes: We can set up an equation based on the information given: Let x be the number of cars that passed through in the first 15 minutes. Since some cars passed through, we know that x > 0. Also, since there were originally 30 cars on the highway, we know that 30 - x cars did not pass through in the first 15 minutes. Now, let's move on to the second group of cars that passed through: In the last 15 minutes, 20 cars passed through. So, we can add this to our previous equation: Again, since some cars turned back, we know that the total number of cars that passed through is less than the original number of cars on the highway: Therefore, we can solve for x: There were 16 cars that passed through in the first 15 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has received 18 plants from her favorite nursery and she wants to give one plant to each of her friends and family members as a gift. Secondly, we know that she has 40 windows in her large house in the countryside, so there are 40 potential places where she can put the plants. Finally, we know that she plans to give one plant to each window. Therefore, the number of plants that Mary will have left after giving one to each window is equal to the number of windows minus the number of plants she gave away. In this case, the number of windows is 40, and the number of plants she gave away is 18 (since she received 18 plants). So, the number of plants Mary will have left is:  40 - 18 = 22.  Therefore, Mary will have 22 plants left in her nurturing pot after giving one to each of her friends and family members.
Response:  First, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome answered.  Secondly, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, so they pressed it 5 times (20 x 1/4).  Thirdly, the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the second friend, so they pressed it 5 + 10 = 15 times.  Finally, the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times in total.  Therefore, the total number of ringing times is:  20 + 5 + 15 + 60 = 100 times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Solo has to read 4 pages from a scientific book, 20 pages from a social research book, 7 pages from a history book, and 8 pages from a geography book. In total, he needs to read 39 pages (4 + 20 + 7 + 8). Since he has 4 days left to finish all the reading, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of days he has left: 39 pages / 4 days = 9.75 pages per day. So, Solo needs to read approximately 9.75 pages per day to complete all the assigned reading within the given time frame.
Response:  First, we know that John drinks one glass of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), so he drinks 3 glasses of water per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, John drinks a total of 3 x 7 = 21 glasses of water per week.  However, at the end of the week, John prefers to relax and drink soda instead of water with his evening meal, so he only drinks 20 glasses of water during the week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles (or 3 dm) of the city. Therefore, if we want to calculate how long it would take for the fog to cover the entire city, we need to divide the distance of the city into smaller parts and find out how many minutes it would take to cover each part.  We are given that the city is 42 miles (or 42 dm) away from the coastline. So let's divide the distance of the city into four equal parts:  Part 1: From the coastline to the halfway point (21 miles or 21 dm) Part 2: From the halfway point to the end of the city (21 miles or 21 dm) Since we know that it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, we can use this information to calculate the time it would take to cover each part as follows:  Part 1: Time = Distance / Speed = 21 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes = 7 minutes Part 2: Time = Distance / Speed = 21 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes = 7 minutes Total time = Sum of times for each part = 7 + 7 = 14 minutes Therefore, it would take the fog approximately 14 minutes to cover the entire city.
Response:  Firstly, Poppy has placed one-fourth of the puzzle pieces on the board, so she has 1000/4 = 250 pieces left.  Next, her mother has added one-third of the remaining pieces, which is 250 x 3/4 = 75 pieces.  Therefore, in total, there are 250 + 75 = 325 pieces to be placed.
Response:  First, we know that Cody eats 3 times as much as Amir, so if Amir eats 5 bananas, Cody will eat 3 x 5 = 15 bananas.  Therefore, together they will eat 5 + 15 = 20 bananas.
"Response:  First, we need to find out how much space is inside each box.  Since each box has dimensions of 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches, and each wall is 1 inch thick, we can subtract the volume of one wall from the total volume of each box.  So, the volume of each box is:  
Volume = Length x Width x Height - Thickness of walls Volume = 5 x 6 x 4 - 12 Volume = 120 cubic inches (or 1920 cubic centimeters) Now, since there are three boxes, we multiply the volume of each box by 3 to get the total volume of all three boxes: Total Volume = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches (or 5760 cubic centimeters) Therefore, the total volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic inches or 5760 cubic centimeters."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frankie watched one hour of TV on Monday and Tuesday, so he watched two hours of TV in total (1 + 1 = 2). On Wednesday, he watched three episodes of his favorite show, each lasting 30 minutes, so he watched a total of 90 minutes of TV on Wednesday (3 x 30 = 90). On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched one more episode of his favorite show, which lasted 30 minutes. Therefore, he watched a total of 120 minutes of TV on Thursday (90 + 30 = 120). On Friday, he had to stay up late for work, so he only watched two hours of TV (2 x 60 = 120). In total, Frankie watched 440 minutes of TV over the week (2 + 90 + 120 + 120 = 440). So, if he watched seven hours of TV, then he watched 7 x 60 = 420 minutes of TV on Saturday.
Response:  First, we know that Henry made 15 more pastries than he had planned to make. This means that if he had planned to make x pastries, then he actually made x + 15.  Next, we know that when he was placing them to cool, he accidentally dropped 5 of them, leaving him with a total of 110 pastries. So, we can set up the equation:  x + (x + 15) - 5 = 110  Simplifying this equation, we get:  2x + 10 = 110  Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:  2x = 100  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  x = 50  Therefore, Henry made 50 pastries last year.
Response:  First, we know that the local gas station is selling gas for $3 per gallon.  Second, we know that the company is offering a rebate of $20 per gallon if we buy gas at their station.  So, if we buy 10 gallons of gas, we will receive a rebate of $20 x 10 = $200.  Therefore, after the rebate, we will pay $3 x 10 = $30 for the 10 gallons of gas.
"Response:  First, we know that Beatrice has 2 more rows than Marcell (24 - 14 = 2).  Second, we know that Beatrice has 3 more columns than Marcell (24 - 21 = 3).  So, in total, Beatrice has 2 + 3 = 5 more than Marcell.  Now, let's calculate how many apples each person can eat if they both finish eating everything.  For Marcell, there are 14 rows and 21 columns, so he can eat 14 x 21 = 294 apples.  For Beatrice, there are 16 rows and 24 columns, so she can eat 16 x 24 = 384 apples.  Therefore, the average number of apples eaten by both people is:  
(294 + 384) / 2 = 678 / 2 = 339 apples per person."
Response:  First, we know that the boat travels at a speed of 20 feet per 16 seconds, so its speed is 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second.  Next, we know that the boat takes in two liters of water for every ten feet it travels, so if it travels twenty feet, it will take in 2 x 2 = 4 liters of water.  Finally, we know that the distance from the shore to the boat is 64 seconds, so the total distance traveled by the boat is 64 + 20 = 84 seconds.  Therefore, the amount of water taken in by the boat is 4 liters x 84 seconds = 336 liters.
Response:  There are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 classes per day. So there will be 8 classes in total (4 teachers x 2 classes/teacher). Each class lasts for 50 minutes, so the total time for all classes is 8 x 50 = 400 minutes. Now, let's calculate how many times the blackboard needs to be erased in one day. We know that each teacher uses the blackboard for 2 classes per day, and each class lasts for 50 minutes. Therefore, the total number of times the blackboard needs to be erased is: 2 x 4 teachers x 50 minutes/class = 400 minutes / 50 minutes/class = 8 times.
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers each day and there are no flowers that do not grow, then after 15 days he will have planted a total of 30 flowers (2 x 15 = 30). However, if 5 flowers do not grow, then he will only have 25 flowers (30 - 5 = 25)
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jamal has 1800 photos in his phone and each photo can contain up to 6 times more images than Brittany's phone. So, if Brittany's phone can hold 50 images, then Jamal's phone can hold 50 x 6 = 300 images. Now, let's calculate how many ducks can be seen in one of Jamal's photos. We are given that there are 50 ducks in the zoo. Therefore, if Jamal takes a photo of all the ducks in the zoo, he will have 50 ducks in one photo. Since he has 300 images in total, he can take 300/50 = 6 photos of all the ducks in the zoo. So, the number of ducks that can be seen in one of Jamal's photos is 6.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha will make from each type of wood she has for sale. For the ten 2x4x10 boards, she will make $10 per board x 10 boards = $100. For the five 4x4x10 boards, she will make $16 per board x 5 boards = $80. In total, Sasha will make $100 + $80 = $180.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Katy uses 7 parts of coffee for every 13 parts of water. So if she uses a total of 120 cups of coffee and one liter of water, we can start by finding out how many cups of water she uses.  Water = Coffee x Ratio Water = 120 x 7/13 = 90 cups (round down to the nearest whole number) Now, let's find out how many cups of coffee she uses. Coffee = Water / Ratio Coffee = 90 / 7/13 = 120 cups (round up to the nearest whole number) Therefore, Katy uses 120 cups of coffee.
Response:  First, we know that John buys two pairs of shoes for each child. So he buys 2 x 2 = 4 pairs of shoes in total. Next, we know that each pair costs $60, so the total cost is 4 x $60 = $240. Therefore, John pays $240 for all four pairs of shoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each container contains 5 cars and there are 2 containers in total. Therefore, the total number of cars brought into the port on Day 1 is 2 x 5 = 10 cars. On Day 2, more containers were added, but we don't know how many. So let's assume that the same number of containers as on Day 1 (i.e., 2) were added on Day 2. This means that the total number of cars brought into the port on Day 2 is 2 x 5 = 10 cars, just like on Day 1. Therefore, the total number of cars at the port after two days is 10 + 10 = 20 cars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago and his salary increased by 30%. So, his current salary is:  $40,000 x 1.3 = $52,000 Now, let's find out how much Lylah earned four years ago. We know that her salary is higher than Adrien's by 30%, so: Lylah's salary four years ago = Adrien's salary four years ago x 1.3 = $40,000 x 1.3 = $52,000 Therefore, both Adrien and Lylah earned $52,000 four years ago. Now, if their salaries increase together at the same rate as Adrien's salary increased, then: Adrien's new salary = $52,000 + (30% of $52,000) = $52,000 + $15,600 = $67,600 Lylah's new salary = $52,000 + (30% of $52,000) = $52,000 + $15,600 = $67,600 So, both Adrien and Lylah earn $67,600 currently.
Response:  First, we know that Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week.  Second, there are 4 weeks in a month.  Therefore, Miguel uses 2 x 4 = 8 sheets of paper per month.  Now, if there are 30 sheets of paper on a ream of paper, then Miguel uses 8/30 = 1/4 of a ream of paper per month.  So, Miguel uses 1/4 of a ream of paper every month.
Response:  First, we know that Morisette has 5 apples and 8 oranges.  Next, we know that Kael has twice as many apples as Morisette and half as many oranges. So, if Morisette has 5 apples, then Kael has 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Additionally, since Kael has half as many oranges as Morisette, Kael has 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. Therefore, in total, both Morisette and Kael have: Apples: 5 + 10 = 15 Oranges: 8 + 4 = 12 fruits.
Response:  First, we know that Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday and then slept for less than 2 hours each day for the next two days (for a total of 4 hours). So, in the first three days of the week, she slept for a total of:  8 + 4 = 12 hours.  Now, let's consider the remaining four days of the week. We are told that she slept for one hour more each day than she did during the previous two days. So, if she slept for 2 hours each day during the previous two days, she slept for:  2 + 1 = 3 hours per day.  Since there are four such days, she slept for a total of:  3 x 4 = 12 hours.  Therefore, Sadie slept for a total of:  12 + 12 = 24 hours throughout the week.
Response:  First, we know that Rosie can run 10 miles in 3 hours, so her speed is 10/3 = 3.33 miles per hour.  Next, we know that she ran for 5 miles in 1 hour, so her speed during this time was 5/1 = 5 miles per hour.  Finally, we want to find out how far she can run in 7 hours. We know that she ran for 3 hours at 3.33 miles per hour and for 1 hour at 5 miles per hour, so we need to add these two distances together.  Total distance = (3 x 3.33) + (1 x 5) = 9.99 + 5 = 14.99 miles.  Therefore, Rosie can run 14.99 miles in 7 hours.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 60 letters in total and Jennie has already stamped 1/3 of them. So, if she has stamped 30 letters, then the number of letters left to be stamped is:  
60 - 30 = 30. Therefore, there were 30 letters in the pile when Jennie started helping her mother."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia bought a pack of 5 spoons. Secondly, she used 3 spoons to taste her stew. Finally, when she was setting the table, she had 12 spoons in total. So, if we subtract the number of spoons she used (3) from the total number of spoons she had (12), we can calculate how many spoons were left in the pack: 12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, there were 9 spoons left in the pack.
"Response:  First, we know that Dylan bought more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So let's use ""x"" to represent the number of fish sausages and ""y"" to represent the number of chicken sausages. We also know that Dylan bought a total of 44 sausages (38 + 6). Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x + y = 44...(1) Since there are 38 chicken sausages, we can write:  y = 38 - x...(2) Substituting (2) into (1), we get:  
x + (38 - x) = 44 Solving for x, we have:  
2x = 72 x = 36 Therefore, Dylan bought 36 fish sausages and 38 - 36 = 2 chicken sausages."
Response:  First, we know that Lily has 50 friends.  Second, we know that Amy has 20 more friends than Lily.  So, if we add 20 to 50, we get... (pause for students to calculate)...70!  Therefore, Lily and Amy have 70 friends together.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one papaya costs $3 more than one chili pepper. So if one chili pepper costs x dollars, then one papaya will cost x + 3 dollars.  Secondly, we know that one cam costs less than five papayas. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  10 cam = (x + 3) \* 5 - 3  Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and the number of papayas). Solving for x, we get:  x = 8  Therefore, each papaya costs $8, and each chili pepper costs $6. The total amount Dillon will spend is:  4 papayas x $8/papaya = $32 20 chili peppers x $6/chili pepper = $120 10 cam x $6/cam = $60 Total amount spent = $32 + $120 + $60 = $212
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours of doctor time are needed for each patient visit.  Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate that each patient visit requires 0.4 hours (24/60) of doctor time.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours of doctor time required for all patient visits per day.  If the hospital sees 500 patients per day, and each patient visit requires 0.4 hours of doctor time, then the total number of hours of doctor time required per day is:  500 patients x 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours/day  Now, let's calculate the daily revenue for the hospital based on the fees charged to patients.  If the hospital charges $200 per hour for patient care, and it provides 200 hours of patient care per day, then its daily revenue would be:  200 hours x $200/hour = $40,000/day  Finally, let's calculate the total annual revenue for the hospital based on the daily revenue calculated above.  If the hospital operates 365 days per year (ignoring any holidays or vacation days), then its total annual revenue would be:   $40,000/day x 365 days/year = $14,600,000/year
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nissa has 60 elves working for her during the holiday season. Secondly, we know that one-third of the elves quit after the children grew up and no longer believed in them. Finally, we know that 10 elves remained after the children left. So let's start with the number of elves who quit: One-third of 60 is 20 (60 x 1/3 = 20). Now, let's subtract the number of elves who quit from the total number of elves to find out how many elves are left: 60 - 20 = 40. Therefore, there are 40 elves left working for Nissa.
Response:  First, we know that Joseph spent $500 in May.  Second, we know that his expenses decreased by $60 in June. So, if we subtract $60 from $500, we get: Total expenses for two months = $500 - $60 = $440.
Response:  First, they went to the amusement park twice, so they used 2 tickets each for a total of 4 tickets. Then, they decided to go on the roller coaster 2 more times, so they used another 2 tickets each for a total of 4 more tickets. In total, they used 8 tickets.
Response:  First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday (thứ Hai).  Next, we know that he walked 6 times as far on Wednesday (thứ Ba) as he did on Monday. So, if he walked x miles on Monday, then he walked 6x miles on Wednesday.  Now, we are given that the total distance Walt traveled from Monday to Thursday is 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  4 + 6x = 41  Simplifying this equation, we get:  10x = 37  Dividing both sides of the equation by 10, we get:  x = 3 7 So, Walt walked 3 7 miles on Thursday (thứ Tư).
Response:  If Tom gets his car washed four times a month and each car wash costs $15, then he spends $60 per month on car washes ($15 x 4).  To find out how much he spends in a year, we can multiply $60 by 12 months:  $60 x 12 = $720 per year.
Response:  If Brian has 20 games and loses 5 before comparing, then he has 15 games left (20 - 5 = 15).  Now, if Bobby has fewer than 5 times as many games as Brian, we can set up an equation based on that information.  Specifically, we know that Bobby has x games, where x is less than or equal to 5 times 15 (since Brian has 15 games left).  So, we can write the equation as follows:  x <= 5(15)  Simplifying this equation, we get:  x <= 75  Since Bobby has fewer than 75 games, we can conclude that Bobby has at most 74 games (since 75 is greater than or equal to 74).  Therefore, the answer is 74.
Response:  Firstly, we know that two-thirds of all grouse in the world are found in Scotland. Secondly, we know that two-thirds of the grouse in Scotland are female. So, to find out how many females there are, we can multiply the total number of grouse in Scotland by two-thirds. Total number of grouse in Scotland = (two-thirds) x (total number of grouse in the world). Now, let's substitute the given values. Total number of grouse in the world = 27. Two-thirds of 27 is 18. Therefore, the total number of grouse in Scotland is 18 x 2 = 36. Finally, since two-thirds of the grouse in Scotland are female, the number of female grouse in Scotland is 36 x 2/3 = 24.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the food items that Rory ordered:  
2 x $7.50 = $15.00 (for two banh mi)  
2 x $1.50 = $3.00 (for two túi khoai tây chiên)  
2 x $1.00 = $2.00 (for two bánh quy) Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 Next, we need to add the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost:  
$20.00 x 20% = $4.00 Delivery fee = $4.00 So, the total amount that Rory needs to pay is:  
Total amount = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00 Finally, Rory wants to add a $5 tip, so the final total amount she needs to pay is:  
Final total amount = $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. So, he spent 8 hours x 5 questions/hour = 400 minutes completing the first test.  Secondly, we know that Mark took 6 hours to complete the second test with 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. Therefore, he spent 6 hours x 5 questions/hour = 300 minutes completing the second test.  Now, let's calculate how many questions were left unanswered in each test:  For the first test:  75 questions - (400 minutes / 5 questions/minute) = 75 questions - 80 minutes = 67 questions left unanswered.  For the second test:  100 questions - (300 minutes / 5 questions/minute) = 100 questions - 60 minutes = 40 questions left unanswered.  Therefore, Mark has 67 + 40 = 107 questions left unanswered in total.
Response:  We know that there are 4 times as many red candies as blue candies. So if we have 12 blue candies, we can multiply that number by 4 to find out how many red candies there are:  12 (blue) × 4 = 48 (red) Therefore, there are 48 red candies.
Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for rent, and we want to find out how many of them are automatic transmissions.  First, let's count the number of manual transmission cars: 4 (since there are 4 manual transmission cars). Now, let's subtract the number of manual transmission cars from the total number of cars: 20 - 4 = 16. So, there are 16 automatic transmission cars. Therefore, the percentage of automatic transmission cars is: 16/20 x 100% = 80%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 700 workers in the beehive. Secondly, we know that there are twice as many worker bees as drones (male bees). Therefore, the number of drone bees is half of the number of worker bees, which is 350. Finally, since there are twice as many worker bees as queen bees, the number of queen bees is half of the number of worker bees, which is 175. So, there are 350 drone bees and 175 queen bees in the beehive.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time Jordan spends playing video games per day. We know that he plays for 2 hours each day. Therefore, in one week (7 days), Jordan will spend 2 x 7 = 14 hours playing video games. Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan earns per hour working his part-time job. We are given that he earns $10 per hour. So, if Jordan works for 1 hour, he will earn $10. Now, let's calculate how much money Jordan can earn in one week if he works for the same number of hours as he spends playing video games. In other words, we need to find out how much money Jordan can earn if he works for 14 hours. To do this, we multiply the number of hours he works by his hourly wage: 14 hours x $10/hour = $140. Therefore, if Jordan spends all his free time playing video games instead of working, he would have earned $140 in one week.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all items before taxes:  Total Cost = $2 x 2 + $3 x 3 + $3 x 3 + $3 x 3 + $4 x 4 = $68 Next, we need to calculate the amount of tax due based on a 10% tax rate: Tax Due = $68 x 0.10 = $6.80 Finally, we can add the tax due to the total cost to find out how much everything will cost in total: Total Cost with Tax = $68 + $6.80 = $74.80 So, everything will cost $74.80 including tax.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total revenue of Lucas per week. Total revenue = Number of customers x Price per customer. Since there are 3 confirmed customers and 5 potential customers, the total number of customers is 8 (3 + 5). The price per customer is $2 for each bottle of cleaning solution and $5 for each pack of rags, so the total revenue is: Total revenue = 8 x ($2 + $5) = $160. Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost. We know that the total cost is $92 per week, so the profit is: Profit = $160 - $92 = $68. Therefore, Lucas will make $68 in profit every week.
Response:  First, we know that John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare can produce 100 coconuts per month. So, in total, John produces 10 x 100 = 1000 coconuts per month. Since he can harvest every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (since there are 4 seasons). Therefore, John can harvest a total of 1000 x 4 = 4000 coconuts per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Johnny has three boxes of Lego: one with 500 pieces, one with more than thrice as many pieces (3 times 500 = 1500), and one with 1/4 of the number of pieces in the first box (500 / 4 = 125).  Total pieces: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2225.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 30 bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours. Since they are half as many bees returning in the next 6 hours, it means that 15 bees returned during this time period. Therefore, the total number of bees that left the hive is 30 + 15 = 45. Now, if each bee stays away for 6 hours, then after 6 hours, all the bees will have returned to the hive. So, at the end of the day (i.e., after 6 hours), there will be 45 bees in the hive.
"Response:  First, we know that Brittany and her mother paid $12 for adult admission and $10 for child admission. So, if they bought one adult ticket and one child ticket, they would have paid a total of:  
$12 + $10 = $22  Since Brittany received $8 in cash, she must have given back the difference between what they paid and what she received:  
$22 - $8 = $14  Therefore, Brittany gave back $14 to the person who sold them the tickets."
Response:  First, we know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.  Second, we know that James has four times as many friends as Charlie does. So if Charlie has 12 friends, James will have 4 x 12 = 48 friends on Facebook.
Response:  First, we need to find out how long it takes for each of them to get home.  For Steve, we know he can travel at a speed of 440 feet per minute, so if he has to travel 3 miles (which is equal to 5,280 feet), it will take him:  5,280 feet / 440 feet/minute = 12 minutes To get home.  Now let's look at Tim. He can travel at a speed of 264 feet per minute, and he has to travel 2 miles (which is equal to 3,280 feet). So it will take him:  3,280 feet / 264 feet/minute = 12.5 minutes To get home. Since Steve takes less time to get home than Tim, Steve wins the race. Therefore, the answer is 12 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, there were five people who rode their bicycles to fill up both tires of the pump. That means each person paid $25 for one tire. So, in total, they spent $25 x 5 = $125. Next, three people came to inflate their tires with air. Since each person only needed one tire filled, they didn't pay anything. Therefore, the total amount earned that day was just $125.
Response:  First, we know that each box of doughnuts has six doughnuts inside.  Second, we know that each doughnut costs $0.10.  So, if Carl buys one box of doughnuts with a $10 bill, he will have paid $10 for the box (6 x $0.10 = $0.60).  Therefore, Carl will receive $9.40 in change ($10 - $0.60 = $9.40).
Response:  First, Dave eats 14 of the potato chips before the seagull snatches them from him. So there are 14 - 14 = 0 potato chips left in the bag.  Next, the seagull eats half of what's left, which is half of 0, so that's 0. Then, three birds (chim bồ câu) eat three each, for a total of 3 x 3 = 9 potato chips gone. After that, a bear takes two-thirds of what's left, which is two-thirds of 0, so that's 0. Finally, some ants take one chip each, leaving five behind. Therefore, there are 5 potato chips remaining in the bag when Dave buys it.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in one week, Kimo has three classes per day, and each class lasts for one hour. So, in one week, he attends 3 x 1 = 3 hours of classes. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo attends 3 x 16 = 48 hours of classes in a semester.
Response:  First, we know that Bill makes 300 buns per day, and each bun is 4 inches long. So, the total length of all 300 buns would be:  300 x 4 = 1200 inches  Next, we know that Bill also makes 120 croissants per day, and each croissant is 6 inches long. So, the total length of all 120 croissants would be:  120 x 6 = 720 inches  Finally, we know that Bill makes 60 baguettes per day, and each baguette is 2 feet long (since there are 12 inches in a foot). So, the total length of all 60 baguettes would be:  60 x 2 = 120 feet  Now, let's add up the total length of all three types of bread to find out how long they would take if placed end to end:  1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches or 170 feet!
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three types of monkeys - normal monkeys, strong monkeys and weak monkeys. Normal monkeys eat 200 bananas per month, strong monkeys eat 400 bananas per month and weak monkeys eat 100 bananas per month. So, in total, the number of bananas required for all the monkeys is: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month. Since the man wants to buy bananas every two months, he needs to buy: 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas every two months.
"Response:  First, we know that Blake ran back and forth 15 times. So if we multiply 15 by the distance of each run (100 meters), we get:  
15 x 100 = 1500 meters  Now, let's look at Kelly's runs. She ran once to the 40-yard line and then turned around and ran back, for a total distance of:  
40 + 40 = 80 yards  Since she did this 34 times, her total distance is:  
34 x 80 = 2720 yards  To find out who won, we need to compare the distances traveled by Blake and Kelly. We can see that Kelly traveled farther than Blake:  
2720 > 1500 Therefore, Kelly wins!"
Response:  First, we know that Raphael bought four pens for $1.5 each, so he spent:  4 x $1.5 = $6  Next, we know that he bought two notebooks for $4 each, so he spent:  2 x $4 = $8 Finally, we know that he bought one folder for $20, so he spent: $20 So in total, Raphael spent: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 chicks in total. Secondly, 6 of them were hiding under a pile of rose petals, so we can subtract 6 from 11 to get the number of chicks left. Finally, 2 more chicks were found hiding under a rock, so we add 2 back to the previous result. Therefore, the final answer is: 11 - 6 + 2 = 5. There are 5 chicks remaining in the pond.
Response:  First, we know that the depth of water in the pond on Monday was 17 feet. On Wednesday, the depth increased by 7 feet, so the depth on Wednesday is:  17 + 7 = 24 feet  Now, we are told that on Thursday, the depth of water in the pond is two-thirds of what it was on Wednesday. So, we can set up a proportion to represent this information:  2/3 x 24 =?  We can solve for the unknown value (the depth of water in the pond on Thursday) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:  2 x 3 = 6  Therefore, the depth of water in the pond on Thursday is:  6 x 24 = 48 feet
Response:  Firstly, we know that Anakin caught 3 con cá hề and Locsin caught fewer than 2 con cá hề. So, the difference between their catch is at least 1 con cá hề (since Locsin caught fewer than 2).  Secondly, we know that Anakin caught 10 sao biển and 6 con ngựa biển in total. Since he caught more than Locsin in both categories, his total catch must be greater than or equal to Locsin's total catch.  Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these two facts:  Anakin's catch = At least 10 + 6 = 16  Locsin's catch < 16 (since she caught fewer than 16)  Now we have two equations and two unknowns (Anakin's catch and Locsin's catch). Solving for Anakin's catch, we get:  Anakin's catch = 16  Locsin's catch = Less than 16 - 3 (since Locsin caught fewer than 2 con cá hề)  Locsin's catch = 13  Therefore, Anakin caught 16 con cá hề, while Locsin caught 13 con cá hề.
Response:  First, we know that the price of the bag increases by 20% every two months. So after one month, the price will increase by 10%. After two months, the price will increase by another 10%, and so on. Therefore, if we want to find out how much the bag will cost after 36 months, we need to calculate the price for each month first.  Month 1: The initial price is $20. After one month, the price increases by 10%, so the new price is $20 x 1.1 = $22. Month 2: The new price from the previous month ($22) increases by 10%, so the new price is $22 x 1.1 = $24.20. This process continues until we reach month 36. Month 36: The new price from the previous month ($24.20) increases by 10%, so the final price is $24.20 x 1.1 = $26.82. Therefore, after 36 months, the bag will cost $26.82.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are five red cars and three action figures in total. So, if each red car costs $4, then the total cost of all five red cars would be:  5 x $4 = $20  Next, we know that one action figure costs $3, so the total cost of all three action figures would be:  3 x $3 = $9  Now, let's add up the total cost of all toys: $20 + $9 = $29  Finally, we know that the monster costs $5, so the total cost of all toys and the monster is: $29 + $5 = $34
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jackie will save if she does her taxes herself instead of hiring an accountant.  If she works for 3 hours at $35 per hour, she will earn $105. However, if she hires an accountant, she will have to pay $90. Therefore, the difference between the two options is: $105 - $90 = $15. So, Jackie will save $15 if she does her taxes herself.  
Now, let's calculate how many hours Jackie needs to work to earn enough money to hire an accountant. We know that the cost of hiring an accountant is $90. To find out how many hours Jackie needs to work to earn this amount, we can divide the cost by her hourly wage: $90 / $35 per hour = 2.6 hours. Therefore, Jackie needs to work for 2.6 hours to earn enough money to hire an accountant."
Response:  First, we know that Elvira has a budget of 1500 euros and she spent 1090 euros on the laptop, which is less than her budget. So, she still has 410 euros left (1500 - 1090 = 410). Next, we know that she also spent 157 euros on a scanner, 74 euros on a CD burner, and 102 euros on an inkjet printer, for a total of 333 euros. Therefore, she has 410 - 333 = 87 euros left to spend on clothes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each sandwich requires 3 eggs and there are 15 sandwiches in total. Therefore, the number of eggs required is 15 x 3 = 45 eggs. Now, let's check how many times Sandra needs to go to the store. Since she gets 9 eggs per trip, she will need to make 45 / 9 = 5 trips to the store. So, Sandra needs to go to the store 5 times.
Response:  First, we know that Brooke is currently 25 years old and Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So, if Brooke is 25, then Seth is 2 x 25 = 50 years old. In two years, both of them will be: Brooke: 25 + 2 = 27 years old Seth: 50 + 2 = 52 years old. Therefore, Seth is currently 50 years old.
Response:  If Ethel has $8, then she has 8 dollars.  Now, if Jimmy has twice as much money as Ethel, then he must have 2 times 8 = 16 dollars.  So, Jimmy has $16.
Response:  First, we know that Pancho goes for a walk every day except for Sunday when he only walks 10 miles (not 30). So, if we subtract 10 from 30, we get 20. Therefore, Pancho walks 20 miles per week. Now, to find out how many miles Pancho walks in one week, we need to multiply 20 by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week): 20 x 7 = 140 miles.  So, Pancho walks 140 miles in one week.
Response:  First, we know that each set of uniforms costs $25 for the hat, so the total cost of one set is $25. Next, we know that the jacket costs three times the price of the hat, so the cost of the jacket is $25 x 3 = $75. Finally, we know that the pants cost half the price of the jacket, so the cost of the pants is $75 / 2 = $37.50. Therefore, the total cost of one set of uniforms is $25 + $75 + $37.50 = $147.50.
Response:  First, we know that there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so the total number of legs is 80 x 8 = 640 legs. Next, we have 90 insects with 6 legs each, so the total number of legs is 90 x 6 = 540 legs. Finally, we have 3 species of rare, limbless animals with 10 legs each, so the total number of legs is 3 x 10 = 30 legs. To find the total number of chan, we add up all these numbers: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 chan.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sally 2 is two years older than Sally 3, so Sally 3 is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.  Secondly, we know that Sally 4 is twice as old as Sally 3, so Sally 4 is 2 x 6 = 12 years old.  Finally, we know that the total age of all four birds is given as ""Caboose"", which means that their ages add up to 12 + 6 + 8 +? = 36.  Therefore, the missing bird (Sally 3) is 8 years old."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month for her student loan, credit card debt, and mortgage.  Monthly Payment = (Total Amount / Number of Payments) x (1 + Interest Rate)^(Number of Payments - 1)  Next, we can calculate the total amount that Jessica will pay over one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment.  Total Amount = (Monthly Payment x Number of Payments) x 12  Now let's plug in some numbers.  For the student loan, the monthly payment is $300, so the total amount after one year would be:  Total Amount = ($300 x 12) x 12 = $36,000  For the credit card debt, the monthly payment is $200, so the total amount after one year would be:  Total Amount = ($200 x 12) x 12 = $24,000  For the mortgage, the monthly payment is $500, so the total amount after one year would be:  Total Amount = ($500 x 12) x 12 = $60,000  To find out how much Jessica will pay in one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment, we can add up all three amounts:  Total Amount = $36,000 + $24,000 + $60,000 = $120,000  So, Jessica will pay $120,000 in one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment.
Response:  First, Billy will spend 1 minute and 30 seconds (1 min 30 sec) to peel all 60 potatoes. That's because he takes 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel one potato, and there are 60 potatoes in total. Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to cut all the peeled potatoes. We know that he can cut each potato in just 5 seconds, so if he has to cut 60 potatoes, it will take him: 60 x 5 = 300 seconds To summarize, Billy will spend a total of: 1 min 30 sec + 300 sec = 430 seconds or approximately 7 minutes and 20 seconds to prepare all the potatoes for his family party.
Response:  First, we know that they sell each gallon of water for $3 and $2 respectively for juice and gasoline. So, if they sell 20 liters per gallon, they will earn:  For juice: 20 x $3 = $60  For gasoline: 20 x $2 = $40 Total revenue: $60 + $40 = $100 Now, we are given that their profit is $25. So, we can set up the following equation: Profit = Revenue - Cost Cost =? We need to find out how much they spent on lemons to determine their cost. Since they sold 20 liters of lemonade for $0.50, we can calculate the total amount they received from selling lemonade as follows: Total amount received from lemonade = Number of liters x Price per liter = 20 x $0.50 = $10 Therefore, their total revenue from both juice and lemonade is: Total revenue = $100 + $10 = $110 Now, we can use the equation we set up earlier to solve for the cost: Cost = Profit - Revenue Cost = $25 - $110 = $85 So, Juan and Carlos spent $85 on lemons.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 80 people in total, and 60 of them are male. So, the number of female participants is:  80 - 60 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  First, we know that Zaid spends $1500 per month on living expenses (rent, food, transportation, etc.). So he has $6000 - $1500 = $4500 left after paying his living expenses. Next, we know that he gives $1000 to his daughter for her weekly expenses, so he has $4500 - $1000 = $3500 left. Finally, we know that he donates $1500 to charity, so he has $3500 - $1500 = $2000 left. Therefore, if Zaid earns $6000 per month and pays all of his expenses, he will have $2000 left over at the end of the month.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Rani has more than 4 times as many chickens as Monica. So if Monica has x chickens, Rani will have 4x chickens. Now, we are told that Bo has 40 chickens and all three of them together have the same number of chickens. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
Rani + Monica + Bo = Total Number of Chickens 4x + x + 40 = Total Number of Chickens We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:  
5x + 40 = Total Number of Chickens To find the total number of chickens, we can solve for x in the above equation:  
5x = Total Number of Chickens - 40 x = Total Number of Chickens / 5 Since we want the total number of chickens to be equal among the three of them, we can say that:  
Total Number of Chickens = 3(x) = 3(Total Number of Chickens / 5) = 150 Thus, the total number of chickens is 150."
Response:  First, we know that Lloyd earns $10 per hour teaching math.  Second, we know that he teaches for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week.  So, let's calculate his total earnings for each week:  Week 1: 5 hours x $10/hour = $50 Week 2: 8 hours x $10/hour = $80 Now, let's add up his total earnings for both weeks: $50 + $80 = $130 Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 in his two weeks of teaching math.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of votes in the class is 80 (given). Secondly, we know that the winner received 3/4 of the total votes, so we can set up the following equation:  Winner's vote = 3/4 x 80 = 60 Now, we need to find out how many votes the loser received. We can do this by subtracting the winner's vote from the total number of votes: Loser's vote = Total votes - Winner's vote = 80 - 60 = 20 So, the loser received 20 votes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra has ordered four times as many red roses as white ones. So if she has ordered x white roses, she has also ordered 4x white roses.  Secondly, we know that Sandra has ordered five times as many calla lilies as white roses. So if she has ordered y white roses, she has also ordered 5y calla lilies.  Now, let's add up all the flowers that Sandra has ordered: x + 4x + y + 5y =...  We are told that Sandra has ordered a total of 200 flowers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: x + 4x + y + 5y = 200.  Simplifying this equation, we get: 6x + 5y = 200.  Since Sandra wants to receive all her flowers before 5 pm, we know that x + 4x + y + 5y must be equal to or greater than 200. In other words, we have: 6x + 5y >= 200.  Finally, we can solve for x and y using the above inequality. We get: x >= 30 and y >= 40.  Therefore, Fred must deliver at least 30 red roses and 40 calla lilies to Sandra before 5 pm in order to keep her happy and avoid any consequences.
Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was younger than Jan by half a year. So if Jan is currently 30 years old, Mark must be 28 years old (since he was younger by half a year). Now we can find out how old Jean is. Since Jean is older than Mark by two years, Jean is 30 + 2 = 32 years old.
Response:  First, we know that each member of the first team will run their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So, if we assume that there are four members in this team, they will complete the race in a total time of 4 x 55 = 220 seconds (or 3 minutes and 40 seconds). Now, let's look at the second team. We know that the first runner will finish in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner will finish in 60 + 3 = 63 seconds, the third runner will finish in 63 + 3 = 66 seconds, and the fourth runner will finish in 66 + 3 = 69 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the second team to complete the race is 4 x 69 = 276 seconds (or 4 minutes and 36 seconds). Since the first team finished in 220 seconds and the second team finished in 276 seconds, the difference between them is: 276 - 220 = 56 seconds. So, the first team will win the race in 56 seconds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry has six faces to throw the die, and each face has an equal probability of being landed on. Therefore, the probability of landing on any particular face is 1/6 or approximately 0.17. Now, let's consider two scenarios: Scenario 1: Jerry lands on three consecutive even numbers (2, 4, 6). In this case, he will roll three even numbers in a row, which is highly unlikely but still possible. The probability of this scenario occurring is (1/6)^3 = 1/216 or approximately 0.0046. Scenario 2: Jerry lands on three consecutive odd numbers (1, 3, 5). This scenario is also possible, but less likely than Scenario 1. The probability of this scenario occurring is (1/6)^3 = 1/216 or approximately 0.0046. To determine the overall probability of Jerry rolling more than three consecutive numbers, we need to add the probabilities of both scenarios together. Therefore, the total probability is: P(more than three consecutive numbers) = P(Scenario 1) + P(Scenario 2) = 0.0046 + 0.0046 = 0.0092 or approximately 0.92%. So, there is a 92% chance that Jerry will not roll more than three consecutive numbers.
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together have collected half of the apples from their apple farm, then they must have collected 20/2 = 10 apples each.  So, Jenna has collected 10 apples and her mother has collected 10 apples as well.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 160 pieces of food in total and they need to be distributed among three groups of animals - hamsters, gerbils, and rabbits. Secondly, we know that each group has a certain number of members and each member gets an equal amount of food. Finally, we want to find out how many hamsters can fit into one cage.  To start with, let's divide the total number of pieces of food (160) by the number of hamsters (10). This gives us the average amount of food per hamster: 160 / 10 = 16. Now, we know that each hamster gets 5 pieces of food, so we can calculate the maximum number of hamsters that can fit into one cage: 16 / 5 = 3. Therefore, each cage can hold 3 hamsters.  Next, let's move on to the gerbils. We know that there are 8 gerbils in total and each gerbil gets 4 pieces of food. So, the total amount of food for the gerbils is: 8 x 4 = 32. Since there are 160 pieces of food in total, we can see that the gerbils will not get all their food from the cages with hamsters and rabbits. Instead, they will only get half of what they need, which means they will receive 32/2 = 16 pieces of food.  Lastly, let's look at the rabbits. There are 20 rabbits in total and each rabbit gets 2 pieces of food. So, the total amount of food for the rabbits is: 20 x 2 = 40. Again, since there are 160 pieces of food in total, we can see that the rabbits will also not get all their food from the cages with hamsters and gerbils. They will only get half of what they need, which means they will receive 40/2 = 20 pieces of food.  Now that we have calculated the amounts of food for each group of animals, we can add up all the numbers to find out how many hamsters can fit into one cage: 3 x 3 = 9. Therefore, each cage can
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Mandy owes Benedict: Total = 100 x (1 + 0.02)^3 = 100 x 1.06 = 106 Now, we need to find out how much Mandy needs to pay Benedict after 3 months. We can use the formula for present value of a future amount with an interest rate: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n Where: PV = present value (the amount Mandy needs to pay) FV = future value (the amount Benedict will receive in 3 months) r = interest rate per period (2%/month) n = number of periods (3 months) Substituting the values, we get: PV = 106 / (1 + 0.02)^3 = 106 / 1.06 = 99.84 So, Mandy needs to pay Benedict 99.84 to settle her debt after 3 months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each bag of rice costs $20 and there are x bags in total. Therefore, the total cost is $20x.  Secondly, we know that the transportation cost from the farm to the warehouse is $2 per bag, so the total transportation cost is $2x.  Finally, we know that the profit made by the merchant is $400, which means he sold all the bags for $30 each. So, we can set up the following equation:  20x + 2x = 400  To solve this equation, we can first add 2x to both sides:  20x + 2x + 2x = 400 + 2x  This simplifies to:  4x = 400  Now, divide both sides by 4:   x = 100  Therefore, the merchant sold 100 bags of rice.
Response:  First, we know that they spent $20.25 on tickets and less than $4.50 on food per person. So, let's subtract the cost of food from the total cost to find out how much they spent on tickets:  Total Cost = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75  Next, we know that they went on two different rides with different costs: Ride 1: $33 per person Ride 2:? We don't know the cost of ride 2 yet. But we do know that they spent a total of $66 on both rides. So, let's set up an equation based on this information: Total Cost + (Ride 1 x Number of People) + (Ride 2 x Number of People) = $66  Now, we can substitute the values we have found so far: Total Cost = $15.75 Ride 1 x Number of People = $33 x Number of People Ride 2 x Number of People =?  Since there are three people in the group, we can write the equation as follows: $15.75 + ($33 x 3) + ($x x 3) = $66  Simplifying the equation: $15.75 + $99 + $x = $66  Solving for x: $x = $66 - $15.75 - $99 = $40.25  Therefore, each person must pay $40.25 to cover their share of the expenses.
"Response:  First, we know that John can pick 2 apples per minute.  Second, we know he picked for 3 hours (or 180 minutes).  So, how many apples did he pick in total?  To find out, multiply the number of minutes he picked by the number of apples he could pick per minute:  
2 apples/minute x 180 minutes = 360 apples  
Therefore, John picked 360 apples during his 3-hour picking session."
Response:  First, we know that each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of grasshoppers per week to survive. Since there are ten ducks in total, they will need to eat 35 pounds (10 x 3.5) of grasshoppers per week.  Now, let's divide this amount by seven days to find out how much each duck needs to eat per day:  35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds per day (10 ducks x 5 pounds/day = 50 pounds/day)  So, each duck needs to eat approximately 5 pounds of grasshoppers per day to survive.
Response:  First, we know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees per year. So after 10 years, he will have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees and cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, he will have 100 - 20 = 80 trees left. Now, we are told that 30% of the trees die. This means that 30% of 80 is 24 trees (since 30% of 80 is 24). So, Tom has 80 - 24 = 56 trees left after 10 years.
Response:  First, we know that there were 18 flamingos in total at first.  Then, on Saturday, one-third of them (18 / 3 = 6) were repainted white and put back outside Sue's house.  So, after Saturday, there were 12 flamingos left (18 - 6 = 12).  Next, on Sunday, 18 new flamingos were added to the collection, bringing the total number of flamingos to 30 (12 + 18 = 30).  Finally, on Sunday afternoon, all the flamingos were painted white, leaving us with 30 white flamingos.  Therefore, there are 30 flamingos outside Sue's house in the end.
"Response:  First, we know that Violetta wants to buy pens in five different colors and she has $20 to spend. Second, each pen costs $2, so we can calculate how many pens she can buy with her budget:  
$20 / $2 per pen = 10 pens  
Therefore, Violetta will receive 10 pens in total."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of one pencil and one eraser.  One pencil costs $1.20, and one eraser costs $0.30. So, the total cost of one set (one pencil and one eraser) is: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50. Now, let's calculate the total cost of eight sets: $1.50 x 8 = $12.00. Therefore, the total cost of eight pencils and eight erasers is $12.00.
Response:  First, we know that there are 40 restaurants in total and each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of fish. So, if we multiply 40 by 2, we get: 80 pounds (of fish) x 2 = 160 pounds. Now, we need to find out how much fish will not be used. To do this, we subtract the amount of fish that will be used (160 pounds) from the total amount of fish available (200 pounds): 200 - 160 = 40 pounds. Therefore, 40 pounds of fish will not be used.
Response:  First, we know that there are 23786 people living in Soda. Of those, 8417 are male and 9092 are female. That means there are 5377 (23786 - 8417 - 9092) people who are not male or female. These people must be children. So, the number of children in Soda is 5377.
Response:  First month, Elaine had 20 cards and collected triple the amount of money, so she collected 60 cards (20 x 3).  In the second month, she collected fewer than 20 cards, let's say she collected x cards.  In the third month, she collected double the number of cards she collected in the first month plus the number of cards she collected in the second month, which is 2x + x = 3x cards.  Therefore, Elaine has 3x cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark edits 1000 sentences per week for both publishers A and B. Secondly, we know that Publisher A pays Mark $5 per sentence, while Publisher B pays him twice as much. So, if we let X be the amount of money Mark earns from Publisher B per week, then we can set up the following equation based on the information given:  X = 2(5) \* 1000 = 2 * 5000 = 10,000  Therefore, Mark earns $10,000 per week from Publisher B.
Response:  First, we know that Baldur drinks 5 jugs of water in the morning and 6 jugs of water in the evening.  Second, each jug contains 5 liters of water.  So, to find out how much water Baldur drinks per day, we need to multiply the number of jugs he drinks in the morning and evening by the amount of water in each jug.  Morning: 5 jugs x 5 liters/jug = 25 liters Evening: 6 jugs x 5 liters/jug = 30 liters Total: 25 + 30 = 55 liters per day
Response:  First, we know that John gets $2000 per week and he works for 52 weeks in a year (assuming he doesn't take any time off). So his annual salary is: 2000 x 52 = $104,000 per year. Now, if he receives a one-time bonus of $5000, his total earnings for the year would be: $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000. Finally, since the bonus increases his salary by 5%, we can calculate his new weekly salary as follows: $109,000 / (1 - 0.05) = $109,000 / 0.95 = $115,789 per year or $2362 per week.
Response:  First, we know that each mu (10 m) of land produces 5 tons of grapes per year.  Second, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, to find out how many barrels of wine are produced per year, we need to multiply the number of tons of grapes by 2.  So, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:  5 tons/year x 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels/year  Thus, the winery produces 10 barrels of wine per year.
Response:  First, we know that Carl eats one sandwich every day and uses two slices of cheese for each sandwich. Therefore, he consumes 7 slices of cheese per week (1 slice x 7 days). Next, we are told that Carl also eats three eggs for breakfast three times a week, using one slice of cheese for each egg. So, he consumes 9 slices of cheese per week (3 eggs x 3 times/week x 1 slice/egg). Finally, we learn that Carl makes a large macaroni and cheese dish to eat several times during the week, using 8 slices of cheese in total. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl consumes per week is: 7 + 9 + 8 = 24 slices of cheese per week.
"Response:  First, we know that Janet has 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens in total.  Next, she buys 6 túi bút xanh (túi bút xanh contains 9 cây bút) and 2 túi bút đỏ (túi bút đỏ contains 6 cây bút). So, after buying, how many green pens does Janet have?  We can calculate this as follows:  
6 túi bút xanh x 9 cây bút/túi = 54 cây bút xanh  
2 túi bút đỏ x 6 cây bút/túi = 12 cây bút đỏ  
Total number of green pens = 54 + 12 = 66 cây bút xanh  
Total number of all pens = 66 + 12 = 78 cây bút  
Therefore, Janet has 78 pens now."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brinley has five test scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We also know that she can drop her lowest score, so let's assume she drops the 71. Now, we need to find out what score Brinley needs in the sixth test to get an average of 93. To do this, we will add up all her remaining scores and divide by 5: (89 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 468 / 5 = 93.6 So, Brinley needs to get at least 93.6 in the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.
Response:  First, we know that Michael went cycling for 4 weeks and each week he rode his bike 5 times, so in total he rode 4 x 5 = 20 times.  Secondly, we know that each time he rode, he covered 25 km, so in total he covered 20 x 25 = 500 km.  Finally, we know that in the third week, he only rode twice, but each time he rode for 60 km, so in total he covered 2 x 60 = 120 km.  Therefore, the total distance Michael traveled is 500 + 120 = 620 km.
Response:  First, we know that each bag of chocolate contains 25 pieces and each piece weighs twice as much as each apple. So if each apple weighs x grams, then each piece of chocolate weighs 2x grams. Since there are 80 apples in total, the weight of all the apples is 80x grams. Now, since each bag of chocolate contains 25 pieces, the total weight of all the chocolate is 25 x 2x = 50x grams. Therefore, the total weight of both the apples and the chocolate is 80x + 50x = 130x grams. To find out how many grams Joe's bag of candy weighs, we need to divide the total weight by the number of items. In this case, we have 130x / 25 = 5x grams per item. So Joe's bag of candy weighs 5x grams.
Response:  First, Rose bought 4 buns on Monday (M). On Tuesday (T), she bought three times as many buns as she did on Monday, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 buns. On Wednesday (W), she bought five times as many buns as she did on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 buns. Finally, on Thursday (Th), she bought five times as many buns as she did on Wednesday, so she bought 5 x 60 = 300 buns. In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 + 300 = 376 buns over the three days.
Response:  First, we know that each plate costs $6,000. Therefore, if we sell half of them (which is 6 plates), we will get:  6 x $6,000 = $36,000  Now, let's calculate the cost per unit (in this case, per plate). We can do this by dividing the total cost by the number of units sold:   $36,000 / 6 plates = $6,000 per plate So, the cost per plate is $6,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $10 before she starts working as a baby sitter. She wants to buy a new jacket and two pairs of shoes, which cost $30 in total (jacket $30, each pair of shoes $20). To calculate how many times she needs to take care of the children to earn enough money for her desired items, we can use the following equation: Number of times taking care of children = Total amount needed / Amount earned per time. Substituting the given values, we get: Number of times taking care of children = $30 / $5 = 6 times. So, Sara needs to take care of the children six times to earn enough money for her desired items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and he has two types of chickens - red and white.  Secondly, we are given that the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day each, while the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day each.  Now, let's calculate how many red chickens Jerry needs to have in order to collect 42 eggs per day.  We can start by dividing the total number of eggs collected (42) by the number of eggs laid by one red chicken (3):  42 / 3 =?  This gives us the number of red chickens needed:  42 / 3 = 14  So, Jerry needs 14 red chickens to collect 42 eggs per day.
Response:  First, we know that the distance of the walk is 1.5 miles (or 2.4 kilometers). We also know that Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour. So, to find out how long it takes for Gary to walk around the park, we need to divide the distance by his speed: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 2.4 km / 3 mi/hr Time = 0.8 hours or 48 minutes Therefore, if Gary walks around the park at a rate of 3 miles per hour, he will take approximately 48 minutes to complete the 1.5-mile loop.
Response:  First, Sloane had 100 customers on Monday.  Then, she had 50 more customers than on Monday, so she had 100 + 50 = 150 customers on Tuesday.  Now, let's find out how many customers she had on Wednesday. She had 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 customers on Wednesday.  So, the correct answer is 250.
"Response:  First, we know that both buckets have a leak rate of 4 gallons per minute (gpm).  Second, we know that the large bucket had twice as much water as the small bucket 4 minutes ago.  Finally, we want to find out how much water is in the small bucket now.  To do this, we can set up an equation based on what we know:  Large Bucket Water = Small Bucket Water x 2 (since it had twice as much water 4 minutes ago)  We also know that the large bucket loses water at a rate of 4 gpm, so its water level decreases by 4 gpm x time (in minutes):  Large Bucket Water = Small Bucket Water x 2 - (4 gpm x time)  Now we need to find out how much time has passed since then.  The problem states that ""4 minutes ago,"" so we know that time is equal to 4 minutes.  Substituting this into our equation above, we get:  Large Bucket Water = Small Bucket Water x 2 - (4 gpm x 4 min)  Simplifying and solving for the volume of water in the small bucket, we get:  Small Bucket Water = (Large Bucket Water / 2) - (4 gpm x 4 min)  Since the large bucket had twice as much water as the small bucket 4 minutes ago, we know that the small bucket had half as much water:  Small Bucket Water = (Large Bucket Water / 2)  Therefore, substituting this into our previous equation, we get:  Small Bucket Water = (Large Bucket Water / 2) - (4 gpm x 4 min)  Solving for the final answer, we get:  Small Bucket Water = (Large Bucket Water / 2) - (16 gpm x 4 min)  Since the large bucket had 8 gallons of water initially (twice the amount of the small bucket), we know that the small bucket had 4 gallons of water initially:  Small Bucket Water = 4 gallons  Now we can substitute this value back into our previous equation to solve for the final answer:  Small Bucket Water = (4 gallons / 2) - (16 gpm"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lori needs in total for both shoes and a belt. We know that she wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320 and a belt for $32,000. So, the total amount she needs is: Total = $320 + $32,000 = $32,320. Next, we need to calculate how many hours Lori needs to work to earn this amount. We know that her hourly wage is $8.00 per hour. So, we can calculate the number of hours as follows: Number of hours = Total / Hourly wage Number of hours = $32,320 / $8.00 Number of hours = 4,040 hours (rounded to the nearest whole number) Therefore, Lori needs to work for approximately 4,040 hours (or about 506 days, assuming a 7-day week) before she can afford to buy both items.
Response:  First, we know that Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10%. So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:  $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200. Now, we are given that she will pay $165 per month for 12 months. So, let's calculate how much she will pay in total:  Total payment = Number of payments x Monthly payment  = 12 x $165 = $1980. Since she paid $1980, but she only needed to pay $2200, the difference between the two amounts is the amount left over after she finishes paying off the loan. This difference can be calculated as follows:  Amount left over = Total amount owed - Total payment  = $2200 - $1980 = $220. Therefore, the amount left over after Janeth finishes paying off the loan is $220.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 4 red roses in the bouquet. Next, we know that there are 7 dahlias in the vase, and each dahlia has more than 4 roses (since ""nhiều"" means ""more"" in Vietnamese). Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is at least 7 x (more than 4) = 7 x 5 = 35 flowers. So, the answer is 35."
Response:  First, we know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so if Harriet is x years old, then Adrian is 3x years old.  Second, we know that Zack is half of Harriet's age, so if Harriet is x years old, then Zack is (1/2)x years old.  Now we can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information.  We know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so we can write:  Adrian's age = 3Harriet's age  And we also know that Zack is half of Harriet's age, so we can write:  Zack's age = (1/2)Harriet's age  Now we have two equations and two unknowns.  Can you solve for Adrian's and Zack's ages?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Naomi scored 68 points. Secondly, Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's score, so Yuri scored 68/2 = 34 points. Thirdly, Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Finally, we can calculate Jojo's score as follows: Total score = Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score = 68 + 34 + 85 = 297 points. Therefore, Jojo scored 297 - 68 = 229 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carmen takes 10 minutes to solve one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve one Sudoku puzzle. Secondly, we know that she solved three crossword puzzles in a week, which means it took her 3 x 10 = 30 minutes to solve all three of them. Thirdly, we know that she solved eight Sudoku puzzles in a week, which means it took her 8 x 5 = 40 minutes to solve all eight of them. Finally, we add up the time taken to solve both types of puzzles: 30 + 40 = 70 minutes. So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games during the week.
Response:  Firstly, Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is: 120 - 90 = 30 liters. Secondly, since Celine can collect twice as much rainwater as she has left in the tank, we know that she can collect: 30 x 2 = 60 liters of rainwater. Therefore, the total amount of water left in the tank now is: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.
Response:  First, we know that Andy planted 90 geraniums and fewer than 40 petunias. So, let X be the number of petunias he planted. Since there are fewer than 40 petunias, we can write X < 40. Now, we need to find out how many flowers in total Andy planted. For each geranium, there are 5 flowers, so for 90 geraniums, there are 90 x 5 = 450 flowers. But wait! We also have petunias. Each petunia has 3 flowers, so for X petunias, there are X x 3 = 3X flowers. In total, Andy planted 450 + 3X flowers. To find X, we set up the equation: 450 + 3X = Total flowers. Substituting X < 40, we get: 450 + 3X <= 40(3) = 120. Solving for X, we get: X = 28. Therefore, Andy planted 28 petunias and a total of 450 + 28 \* 3 = 450 + 84 = 534 flowers.
Response:  First, we know that the company spent $15,000 on advertising in year one.  Second, we know that they spent one-third of this amount ($15,000 x 1/3 = $5,000) on advertising in year two.  Therefore, the total amount that the company spent on advertising over both years is:  $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each person will pay for their boat rental.  For Carlos, he pays $30 per hour x 3 hours = $90.  For Benji, she pays $18 per hour x 5 hours = $90.  So both people pay the same amount - $90.
"Response:  First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus. Second, we know that it takes half as long (1/2) to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car. So if we add up these two pieces of information, we can find out how many days Andrew will spend in total for his trip. Here's the calculation:  
6 days (bus journey) + 1/2 days (car journey) = Total number of days  
6 + 0.5 = 6.5 days  
Therefore, Andrew will spend 6.5 days on his trip from New Jersey to Rochester and back."
Response:  First, we know that James has 30 fire cards, 20 grass cards, and 40 water cards in total. If he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass cards, how many of his remaining cards are likely to be water cards?  To find this out, we need to calculate the proportion of water cards among all his cards before he made any changes.  We can do this by dividing the number of water cards by the total number of cards:  Water cards = 40 / (30 + 20 + 40) = 40 / 90 = 1/5  So, after losing 8 water cards, James will have 40 - 8 = 32 water cards left.  Now, let's calculate the probability that a randomly chosen card from what remains is a water card:  Probability of a water card = 32 / (32 + 14) = 32 / 46 = 1/5  Therefore, there is a 1/5 or 20% chance that a randomly chosen card from what remains will be a water card.
Response:  First, we know that the basic price of the burrito is $6.50. Then, Chad added some extra ingredients: beef ($2), cheese ($1), and two types of sauce ($0.25 each). So, the total cost before any discounts or promotions would be: 6.50 + 2 + 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 9.75  Next, Chad decided to upgrade his meal with an additional fee of $3.00 for fries and drinks, so the new total cost becomes: 9.75 + 3.00 = 12.75 However, Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he can use to offset the cost. Therefore, the amount Chad owes is: 12.75 - 5.00 = 7.75
Response: 1) Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so she can add 24 pieces in 6 minutes (24 = 4 x 6). 2) Her mother can place half of the number of pieces that Kalinda places, so her mother can place 12 pieces in 6 minutes (12 = 24/2). Therefore, it will take them 6 minutes to complete the puzzle together.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested after two months, so the number of watermelons ready to be harvested is:  
30% x 120 = 36 (watermelons)  Now, we know that Ashlyn came back two weeks later and found that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready to be harvested. So, the number of watermelons not yet ready to be harvested is:  
(1 - 3/4) x 96 = 24 (watermelons)  Therefore, there are 36 + 24 = 60 watermelons left to be harvested."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of each car before taxes and registration fees. We can do this by multiplying the number of cars by the price per car: Total cost = Number of cars x Price per car  Total cost = 12 x 20,000 = 240,000  Next, we need to calculate the amount of tax owed for each car. If Mark pays 10% tax on each car, then he will pay: Tax = (Total cost x Tax rate) / 100 Tax = (240,000 x 10%) / 100 = 24,000  Finally, we add the tax and registration fee to get the total cost of each car: Total cost = Total cost + Tax + Registration fee Total cost = 240,000 + 24,000 + 1000 = 265,000  So, the total cost of 12 cars is: Total cost = 12 x 265,000 = 3,180,000
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kylie collected 5 shells more than Robert on Monday, which means Robert collected 20 - 5 = 15 shells on Monday.  On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, which is 2 x (5) = 10 shells more than Monday. So, Kylie collected 15 + 10 = 25 shells on Tuesday.  Now, let's find out how many shells Kylie collected on Wednesday. We know that Kylie collected grap 2 times as many shells as she did on Tuesday, which is 2 x (25) = 50 shells more than Tuesday. Therefore, Kylie collected 25 + 50 = 75 shells on Wednesday.  So, to summarize:  Monday: Robert collected 15 shells, Kylie collected 5 more than Robert (15 + 5 = 20)  Tuesday: Kylie collected 25 shells (2 x 20)  Wednesday: Kylie collected 75 shells (2 x 25 x 2)  To find out how many shells Kylie collected in total, we add up all her collections for the three days: 20 + 25 + 75 = 120 shells.
Response:  First, we know that there are 50 bees in the garden.  Second, we know that half of the bees are in the apple tree (50/2 = 25).  Therefore, there are 25 bees in the apple tree.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 chú chim cánh cụt in total. Secondly, we know that one-third of them (12) nhảy vào và bơi trong đại dương. Thirdly, we know that another third (12) đi vào hang để ăn bữa tối. Finally, we want to find out how many chú chim cánh cụt are left to tắm nắng. So, let's subtract the number of chim chim that have gone swimming and eating from the total number of chim chim: Total number of chim chim - (12 + 12) = 36 - 24 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 chú chim cánh cụt left to tắm nắng.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve eats 6 cherries per day, and there are 7 days in a week. So, he consumes 6 x 7 = 42 cherries per week. Now, if each cherry tree can produce 3 cherries per week, then Steve needs 42 / 3 = 14 trees to meet his demand.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 people in total and each person can have 4 slices of pizza. So, the total number of slices needed is 20 x 4 = 80 slices. Since the pizza is cut into 8 equal parts, we need to order 80/8 = 10 pizzas.
Response:  First, we know that each full pen can be used to make 4 new pens (since there are 4 ink cartridges in each). Therefore, if we have 25 full pens, we can make: 25 x 4 = 100 new pens.  Now, let's consider how many pens we need to buy to get enough ink for all of them. Since each pen uses up 1/4 of the ink, we need to buy: 100 / 4 = 25 more pens.  So, in total, we need to buy 25 + 25 = 50 pens.
"Response:  First, Johnny has $20 + $10 = $30.  He invests this money and triples it within a year. So, after one year, he will have:  
$30 x 3 = $90."
Response:  First, we know that Mary is younger than Joan by two years, so Mary is 18 years old (16 + 2). Second, we know that Joan is older than Jessa by five years, so Joan is 25 years old (20 + 5). Finally, we can calculate the total age of the three women as follows: Mary (18), Joan (25), and Jessa (20) = 18 + 25 + 20 = 63 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 1000 students in total and 30% of them leave through door A, which is equal to 300 students (1000 x 0.3).  Next, we know that 3/5 of the remaining students leave through door B, which is equal to 240 students (300 x 0.6). Finally, we need to find out how many students leave through door C. To do this, we subtract the number of students who left through doors A and B from the total number of students: 1000 - 300 - 240 = 460. Therefore, 460 students leave through door C.
"Response:  First, we know that James has 6 more than Robert. So if Robert has x kẹo, James has x + 6 kẹo.  Second, we know that John has twice as many kẹo as Robert. So if Robert has x kẹo, John has 2x kẹo.  Now let's substitute these expressions into our equation for John's total number of kẹo:  
John has 54 kẹo, so we can set up an equation:  
2x = 54  
Now solve for x:  
x = 27  
So Robert has 27 kẹo and James has 27 + 6 = 33 kẹo.  Therefore, John has 54 kẹo, which is greater than both James (33) and Robert (27)."
Response: 1. If Dolly and Pandora each have two books, they will both read one book from their own collection and one book from the other person's collection. So, together they will have read 2 + 2 = 4 books.  Therefore, at the end of this process, they will have read four books together.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mike has 5 friends who send him letters every week for 5 pages each. So, in total, he receives 5 x 5 = 25 pages per week. Since he is no longer friends with 2 people, he does not receive any letters from them. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike needs to respond to is 25 - 2 = 23 pages per week. Now, we know that Mike can write one page in 6 minutes. So, to calculate how many hours he spends writing responses per week, we can divide the total number of pages by his writing speed: 23 pages / 1 page/6 minutes = 23 / 6 = 3.83 hours per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason has 1000 minutes per month to use his phone. This means he has 1000/30 = 33.33 minutes per day to use his phone.  Next, we know that he spends 15 minutes per day talking to his supervisor, so he has 33.33 - 15 = 18.33 minutes per day for other calls.  Finally, we are told that he makes 300 additional calls in the month, which is equal to 300 / 18.33 = 16.47 days of calling. Therefore, if there are 30 days in the month, Jason will have 30 - 16.47 = 13.53 days without making any calls.
Response: 1st, Kyle took 5 chips from Griffin, so Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 chips left. Then, Billy took double of what Kyle took, which is 2 x 5 = 10 chips. So, Griffin now has 19 - 10 = 9 chips left. Next, Ginger gave some of her chips to Griffin, but we don't know how many. Let's assume she gave x chips. Therefore, Griffin now has 9 + x chips. Finally, Colby took fewer than 3 chips from Griffin (since he only took 3 chips). So, let's subtract the number of chips that Colby took from Griffin's total: 9 + x - 3 =? Solution: We can substitute x for the unknown number of chips that Ginger gave to Griffin. Since Ginger gave some of her chips to Griffin, we need to find out how many chips she gave in order to make sure that Griffin has exactly 27 chips at the end. To do this, we can set up an equation based on the information given: 9 + x - 3 = 27. First, add 3 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the negative term: 9 + x = 30. Now, subtract 9 from both sides to solve for x: x = 21. So, Ginger gave 21 chips to Griffin. Therefore, Griffin has 9 + 21 = 30 chips at the end.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 turtles in one fish tank and 32 turtles in another fish tank. Secondly, we know that the number of turtles in each fish tank is twice the number of fish in both fish tanks combined. Therefore, let's find out how many fish there are in both fish tanks combined first. We can do this by multiplying the number of fish in one fish tank by two: 4 x 2 = 8 So, there are 8 fish in both fish tanks combined. Now, since the number of turtles in each fish tank is twice the number of fish in both fish tanks combined, we can divide the number of turtles in each fish tank by two to get the number of fish: 4 / 2 = 2 32 / 2 = 16 Therefore, there are 2 fish in the first fish tank and 16 fish in the second fish tank.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours each day (for 4 days a week). So, her daily earnings are: Daily Earnings = $250/hour x 6 hours/day x 4 days/week = $4,800/week We also know that she works for 5 weeks to complete the film. Therefore, her total earnings for the project are: Total Earnings = $4,800/week x 5 weeks = $24,000 Now, according to the given information, after completing the project, the makeup artist will give Jean a 10% discount. To calculate the final amount Jean needs to pay, we can use the following formula: Final Amount = Total Earnings x Discount Percentage / 100 Final Amount = $24,000 x 10% / 100 = $2,400 So, Jean needs to pay $2,400 for the makeup services provided by the artist.
Response:  First, we know that Isabelle spent $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 = $74 on party supplies and gifts for her daughter's birthday celebration.  Next, she divided the cost equally among three people - herself, her husband, and her mother-in-law. So each person paid $\frac{74}{3} = 24\$$.
Response:  First, we know that each bag of flour costs $1.50 per pound. So if there are 50 pounds in each bag, then the total cost of one bag is:  50 pounds x $1.50/pound = $75 per bag  Since the chef bought four bags of flour, the total cost would be:  4 bags x $75/bag = $300  Therefore, the chef spent $300 on flour.
Response:  First, we know that Sue eats 4 times as much as her sister on Monday (4 x 5 = 20). On Tuesday, she eats twice as much as her sister (2 x 13 = 26). So, in total, Sue eats 20 + 26 = 46 pieces of bread. Since each piece of bread contains 200 calories, Sue consumes 46 x 200 = 9200 calories more than her sister.
