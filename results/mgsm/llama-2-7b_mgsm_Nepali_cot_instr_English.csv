Response:  Jennet makes $16 per hour working at home every day for 8 hours. She earns $128 per day ($16 x 8). Now, she spends $30 on groceries and other necessities each day. So, her daily expenses are $98 ($128 - $30). Since she works every day of the week, her total weekly income is $728 (($128/day) x 7 days/week). And since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total monthly income is $2872 (($728/week) x 4 weeks/month).
"Response:  We have to find out how many rubber bands of length 2 vats are needed to cover the entire surface area of a sphere with a radius of 1 vat.  Since the volume of a sphere is given by V = (4/3) \* π \* r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere, we can use this formula to calculate the total surface area of the sphere.  The surface area of a sphere is given by A = 4 \* π \* r^2, so we can set up the following equation:

V = (4/3) \* π \* r^3 = 4 \* π \* r^2

Solving for r, we get:

r = sqrt(V / (4 \* π))

Now, we know that the volume of the sphere is 2 vats, so we can plug in V = 2 and solve for r:

r = sqrt(2 / (4 \* π)) = 0.7854...

So, the radius of the sphere is approximately 0.7854 vats. Now, let's find out how many rubber bands of length 2 vats are needed to cover the entire surface area of the sphere:

Number of rubber bands = Total surface area of sphere / Length of each rubber band
= 4 \* π \* r^2 / 2 vats
= 8 \* π \* r / 2
= 8 \* π \* 0.7854... / 2
= 16.96...

Therefore, you would need approximately 17 rubber bands of length 2 vats to cover the entire surface area of a sphere with a radius of 1 vat."
Response:  Joshua and his family spent $80,000 to build their dream house. They sold it for $500,000, which means they made a profit of $420,000 ($500,000 - $80,000). So, the percentage increase in the value of the house is (($500,000 - $80,000) / $80,000) x 100 = 525%.
Response:  Jamie has decided to take three steps forward and three steps backward. Each step he takes is 6 meters long. So, if he takes three steps forward, he will cover a distance of 3 x 6 = 18 meters. Then, if he takes three steps backward, he will cover a distance of 3 x 6 = 18 meters again. Therefore, in total, Jamie covers a distance of 18 + 18 = 36 meters.
Response:  Every day, Wendy prepares three meals for her husband and herself. On average, she cooks 15 cups of rice per day. So, in one week (7 days), she cooks 105 cups of rice (3 x 3 = 9). In one month (30 days), she cooks 300 cups of rice (9 x 30 = 270). And in one year (365 days), she cooks 3650 cups of rice (270 x 13 = 3650). Therefore, in one year, Wendy cooks approximately 3650 cups of rice.
Response:  We know that Kailer has $50 to buy gifts for his friends. Each gift costs $60, so he needs $160 in total. Now, let's calculate how many gifts he can buy with his budget of $50: Number of gifts = Budget / Cost per gift = $50 / $60 = 8 gifts So, Kailer can buy 8 gifts for his friends.
Response:  According to the given information:  Tulju has 20 watas of land and Charles has 4 guntas of land. If Tulju gives 1/4th of his land to Charles, then Tulju will have 20 / 4 = 5 watas of land left. So, the total amount of land that Tulju and Charles have together is 5 + 4 = 9 watas of land.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carl has to download 200 GB of files in 4 minutes. This means he needs to download at a rate of 50 MB per second (200 GB / 4 min = 50 MB/s). Now, let's assume that his internet connection is able to provide him with a constant speed of 50 MBps throughout the downloading process. Therefore, it will take him approximately 4 minutes to download all the files (4 min x 50 MBps = 200 MB). So, the answer is 200 MB.
Response:  Firstly, Jonas has to walk for 3 hours and then he will reach his home which is 60 miles away from the starting point. So, in total, it will take him 3 x 60 = 180 miles to reach his home. Now, we need to calculate how much time it will take him to cover this distance at a speed of 20 miles per hour. We know that there are 4 quarters in an hour, so: Time taken = Distance / Speed = 180 miles / 20 miles/hour = 9 hours Therefore, Jonas will take 9 hours to reach his home after walking for 3 hours.
Response:  If Eliza takes 40 hours to complete each task and she has worked for 80 hours in total, then she has completed 2 tasks (since each task takes 40/2 = 20 hours). So, her income is $120 \times 2 = $240.
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads of the new program. In the second month, the number of downloads increased to 3 times that of the first month, which is 180 downloads (60 x 3 = 180). However, in the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 25%, which means 45 downloads (180 x 25% = 45). Therefore, after three months, the total number of downloads would be 180 + 45 = 225 downloads.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of 3 donuts at $68 per dozen = $854. Then, for 2 mini donuts at $80 per dozen = $160. Finally, for 6 mini chocolate chip cookies at $55 per dozen = $330. Therefore, the total cost is $854 + $160 + $330 = $1,344.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Carl will spend on buying trees. According to the given information, he will spend $90 per tree. So, if he wants to buy 100 trees, he will spend $9,000 ($90 x 100 = $9,000). Now, let's assume that each tree can absorb around 5 tons of carbon dioxide during its lifespan (which is approximately 25 years). If Carl plants these trees in his backyard and takes care of them properly, they will absorb a total of 5 tons of carbon dioxide every year. This means that over their entire lifespan, they will absorb a total of 125 tons of carbon dioxide (5 tons/year x 25 years = 125 tons). Since each ton of carbon dioxide costs $100, the total cost of absorbing 125 tons of carbon dioxide over 25 years would be $12,500 ($100/ton x 125 tons = $12,500). Therefore, Carl has spent $9,000 to plant 100 trees, which will absorb a total of 125 tons of carbon dioxide over their lifetime, resulting in an overall profit of $3,500 ($12,500 - $9,000 = $3,500).
Response:  If a woman sells her house worth Rs.50 lakh and spends Rs.10 lakh on household items, she will have Rs.40 lakh left after deducting the cost of the items. Now, if she invests Rs.20 lakh in a business that gives an annual return of 10%, she will have Rs.22 lakh after one year (Rs.20 lakh x 10%). So, the total amount she has after one year is Rs.62 lakh (Rs.40 lakh + Rs.22 lakh).
Response:  Firstly, there are 20 students in total. Out of them, 15 students have chosen to study science subjects (i.e., २० जना विद्यार्थीको नृत्य कक्षामा २० प्रतिशतले). Among these 15 students, 7 students have chosen to study physics (i.e., ७ जना विद्यार्थीको नृत्य कक्षामा ७ प्रतिशतले). Therefore, the percentage of students who have chosen to study physics is ६/२० = 35%.
"Response:  If an entrepreneur invests $5000 in either of the two options - gold or electronics - and the market price of that option increases by 2.5% per month, then after one year, the value of their investment will be:

Option A (Gold): Value = $5000 x (1 + 0.025) ^ 12 = $6,375
Option B (Electronics): Value = $5000 x (1 + 0.025) ^ 12 = $8,425
So, if the entrepreneur chooses to invest in electronics, they can expect to gain around $8,425 in one year, which is higher than the expected return from investing in gold ($6,375)."
Response:  The first train left at 8 AM and reached its destination in 8 hours. Then, it took another 40 minutes to unload the passengers and cargo. So, the total time taken for both journeys was 8 + 40 = 88 hours. Now, let's convert this time into days. There are 24 hours in a day, so: 88 hours / 24 hours/day = 3.5 days. Therefore, each train journey took approximately 3.5 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that the teacher and coach will receive in one year. The teacher will receive $20 per hour for teaching classes, which means they will earn $130 per day ($20 x 6 hours) and $840 per month ($130 x 6 days). Similarly, the coach will receive $30 per hour for coaching sessions, which means they will earn $210 per day ($30 x 7 hours) and $1,330 per month ($210 x 6 days). Therefore, the total amount of money that both the teacher and coach will receive in one year is: Teacher: $840 x 12 months = $10,080 Coach: $1,330 x 12 months = $15,960 Now, let's find out how much each of them will work in a year. According to the question, the teacher has to teach 50 students, which means they will have to give 50 x 6 hours/day = 300 hours of classes per month. Similarly, the coach has to conduct 50 sessions, which means they will have to spend 50 x 7 hours/week = 350 hours per week on coaching sessions. Therefore, the total number of working hours for both the teacher and coach in one year is: Teacher: 300 hours/month x 12 months = 3,600 hours Coach: 350 hours/week x 50 weeks = 17,500 hours In conclusion, based on these calculations, the total annual income of both the teacher and coach comes out to be around $26,580 ($15,960 + $10,080).
Response:  We have to find out how many liters of water each person in Bihar needs per day. According to the Indian government, an average adult human requires at least 2 liters of water per day for basic metabolic functions. So, we can assume that each person in Bihar needs at least 2 liters of water per day. Now, let's calculate the total number of people in Bihar who need water. According to the census data provided earlier, there are approximately 109 million people living in Bihar. If we divide this number by 3 (as there are three main rivers), we get around 36 million people who live near these rivers. Since each person needs at least 2 liters of water per day, we can estimate that around 72 million liters of water are required daily to meet the minimum drinking water requirements of these 36 million people. Therefore, the answer is 72 million liters.
Response:  If it takes 4 minutes to complete one mile, and Arko can run at a speed of 2 miles per hour, then he can cover 8 miles in 16 minutes (since there are 4 minutes in 1 hour). Therefore, if Arko wants to cover 4 miles in half an hour, he will need to run for 20 minutes ( since there are 2 hours in 1 hour).
Response:  We have to find out how much water is required to fill up 10 liters of peanut oil. As per the question, we need 24 liters of water to fill up one liter of peanut oil. So, if we want to fill up 10 liters of peanut oil, we will require 24 x 10 = 240 liters of water. Therefore, there are 240 liters of water in 10 liters of peanut oil.
Response:  Remind's age at death was 6 years old when he was born and Samantha's age at death was 31 years old. If Samantha had lived for another 30 years after her death, then Remind would have been alive for how many years after his birth?  Therefore, the answer is 27 years (6 + 31 - 30).
Response:  On Monday, there are 8 customers who buy DD. Each customer buys 3 DVDs each. So, in total, 24 DVDs are sold on Monday. Now, let's calculate how many DVDs are sold on other days of the week. On Tuesday, there are 2 customers who buy 2 DVDs each, so 4 DVDs are sold on Tuesday. On Wednesday, there is only one customer who buys 1 DVD, so 1 DVD is sold on Wednesday. On Thursday, there are 3 customers who buy 2 DVDs each, so 6 DVDs are sold on Thursday. On Friday, there are 5 customers who buy 3 DVDs each, so 15 DVDs are sold on Friday. Finally, on Saturday and Sunday, there are no customers who buy DVDs. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold throughout the week is 24 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 15 = 40 DVDs.
"Response:  We know that every hour there are 24 minutes in an hour. So, if we calculate for 5 hours, then the total number of minutes will be:

24 x 5 = 120 minutes

Now, let's convert this time to seconds:

120 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 7200 seconds

So, the answer is 7200 seconds."
Response:  The book was sold for $1950 in 2023, and its original price was $2500. So, there is a discount of $550 (2500 - 1950 = 550). Therefore, the percentage of discount is 25% (550/2500 x 100%).
"Response:  If each backpack weighs $85, and there are 50 backpacks in total, then the total weight of all backpacks is:

$85 x 50 = $4250

So, if the shipping cost per pound is $5.50, then the total shipping cost for all backpacks would be:

$4250 x $5.50/pound = $23,125

Therefore, the correct answer is $23,125."
Response:  We have three options for Misalkale's clothes: shirt, pant, and jacket. The cost of each item is as follows: Shirt - Rs. 1650, Pant - Rs. 2250, Jacket - Rs. 4250. Therefore, if Misalkale buys all three items, his total cost will be: Shirt + Pant + Jacket = Rs. 1650 + Rs. 2250 + Rs. 4250 = Rs. 8350. So, Misalkale has spent Rs. 8350 on his clothes.
Response:  We know that Sinthya eats one egg every night at midnight. So in total, she has 60 eggs per month (30 days x 2 eggs/day). Now, let's calculate how much money she spends on eggs per month:  Egg price = Rs 50/egg So, Sinthya spends Rs 3000/month on eggs (60 eggs x Rs 50/egg)
Response:  Henrila traveled for 60 miles and then turned back after covering half of it (30 miles). So he covered a total distance of 90 miles (60 + 30) during his journey. Now, we need to find out how many miles he walked each day. To do this, we divide the total distance he covered by the number of days he took for the journey. In this case, he took 15 days for the journey, so he walked an average of 6 miles per day (90 / 15 = 6).
Response:  If the price of one pair of shoes is $33 and another pair costs twice as much, then the price of the second pair is $66. So, if we multiply the price of each shoe by two, the total cost of both pairs will be $132. Therefore, the price of one pair of shoes is $33 x 2 = $66.

Response:  The number of people who have been in jail for more than 8 years is given as 80. Now, let's calculate the percentage increase in the number of people who have been in jail for more than 20 years. We know that there are 20 times as many people who have been in jail for more than 20 years as there are people who have been in jail for more than 8 years. So, if there were x people who had been in jail for more than 8 years, then there would be 20x people who had been in jail for more than 20 years. Therefore, we can write an equation: 20x = 80 + (80 \* 25/100) = 80 + 20 = 100. Solving for x, we get x = 40. So, there were 40 people who had been in jail for more than 20 years.
Response:  If Jonas has 10 cuckoos and each cuckoo takes 2 hours to lay an egg, then in one day (24 hours), Jonas will have 20 eggs (10 cuckoos x 2 hours/cuckoo = 20 eggs). Now, if each egg hatches after 1 hour, then in one day, Jonas will have 20 baby cuckoos (20 eggs x 1 hour/egg = 20 baby cuckoos). So, the number of baby cuckoos that Jonas will have in 7 days is 140 (20 baby cuckoos x 7 days = 140).
Response:  We know that Grechen has 110 siikas and Chandi has 30 vatas. So, if we take 4 vatas from Chandi, how many siikas will be left with Chandi? Therefore, the number of siikas left with Chandi is 30 - 4 = 26 siikas.
Response:  Siyobhan has Rs. 200 less than Remand's amount. If Remand has Rs. 50 more than Harun's amount, then Harun had Rs. 400 less than Remand's amount. So, if Remand has Rs. 400, then Siyobhan has Rs. 600 (Rs. 400 - Rs. 200 = Rs. 600).
Response:  Firstly, Michael took 40 minutes to complete 20 puzzles, so he completed each puzzle in 2 minutes (40/2=2). Now, let's calculate how much time Michael spent on the second set of 20 puzzles. Since it took him twice as long to complete the first set, he will take twice as long to complete the second set too. So, he spent 2 x 2 = 4 minutes on the second set of puzzles. Therefore, Michael spent a total of 2 + 4 = 6 minutes solving all 40 puzzles.
"Response:  We know that Teri has been eating two eggs per day for 30 days and each egg costs $5. So, Teri has spent $100 on eggs in total (2 eggs/day x 30 days = 60 eggs; 60 eggs x $5/egg = $300). Now, we are asked how much money Teri will spend on eggs if she continues to eat two eggs per day for another 4 weeks (or 28 days). To calculate this, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of eggs consumed per day: 28 days x 2 eggs/day = 56 eggs ($56); therefore, Teri will spend $56 on eggs over these additional 4 weeks. In summary, Teri has already spent $300 on eggs and will spend an additional $56 over the next 4 weeks, making her total cost for eggs $356."
"Response:  We have 13 sets of 5 cards each, for a total of 65 cards. Each card costs $1.50, so the total cost of all the cards is:

$1.50 x 65 = $97.50

Now, we need to calculate how much money Jon will make from selling these cards. He has 8 sets of 5 cards each, which means he has a total of 40 cards (8 x 5). If he sells each card for $20, his total earnings will be:

$20 x 40 = $800

So, Jon will make $800 in total from selling these cards."
Response:  On day 1, Jon has 60 miles to walk and he walks for 3 days. So, he covers 60 x 3 = 180 miles in total on those 3 days. Now, let's calculate how much distance he covers each day: Total distance / Number of days = Daily distance On Day 1, his daily distance is 180 / 3 = 60 miles per day. Similarly, on Days 2 and 3, his daily distance is 180 / 2 = 90 miles per day. Therefore, Jon covers 60 + 90 + 90 = 240 miles in total during these 3 days.
Response:  If Denna can run 3 miles in 20 minutes, then she can run 1 mile in 6 minutes (since there are 3 miles in 20 minutes).  Now, if she runs for 2 hours straight without stopping, she will have covered a total distance of 2 x 60 = 120 miles.  However, since she stops to rest for 15 minutes every hour, she will not be able to cover that much distance in one session. So, the correct answer is 90 miles (since she cannot run continuously for 2 hours without any breaks).
Response:  If Ben's phone is 2 years old and Suji's phone is 1 year old, then Ben's phone is older than Suji's phone by 1 year. So, Ben's phone is 3 years old (2 + 1 = 3).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mahaan Drgyagan has 1000 feet of height and 4000 feet of width.  If we calculate the area of Mahaan Drgyagan, it will be 1000 x 4000 = 40,00,000 square feet.  Now, if we consider the distance between Mount Everest and Mahaan Drgyagan to be 1000 miles (which is approximately equal to 1609 kilometers), then we can calculate the time taken to reach Mahaan Drgyagan from Mount Everest using the formula - Distance / Speed = Time.  The speed at which we are traveling is 50 miles per hour (approximately equal to 80 kilometers per hour). Therefore, the time taken to reach Mahaan Drgyagan from Mount Everest will be - 1609 km / 50 mph = 32.18 hours.  However, this calculation assumes that we are traveling in a straight line from Mount Everest to Mahaan Drgyagan. In reality, there may be obstacles such as mountains or rivers along the way that could increase the actual time taken to reach Mahaan Drgyagan.
Response:  Firstly, Jonas launched 5 fireballs and each of them covered an area of 8 square meters. Therefore, the total area covered by all 5 fireballs is 5 x 8 = 40 square meters.  Next, he created 8 more fireballs and each of them had a diameter of 2 meters. So, the total area covered by these 8 fireballs is 8 x π (where π is approximately equal to 3.14) = 8 x 3.14 = 25.76 square meters.  Finally, he launched 14 additional fireballs, and each of them had a diameter of 1 meter. Thus, the total area covered by these 14 fireballs is 14 x π = 14 x 3.14 = 45.96 square meters.  In conclusion, altogether 40 + 25.76 + 45.96 = 111.72 square meters were covered by the fireballs launched by Jonas.
"Response:  If one chip has 250 calories and there are 30 chips in total, then the total number of calories in all 30 chips is:

Now, if Tapaini wants to eat 18000 calories per day, and each gram of chips contains 5 calories, then the number of grams of chips Tapaini can eat per day is:

18000 / 5 = 3600 grams

So, Tapaini can eat 3600 grams of chips per day."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Charlie can make from each pound of Madhumakki. As per the question, if he sells each pound for $10, then he will get $10 x 10 = $100 per pound. Now, let's assume that he has 20 pounds of Madhumakki, which means he can earn $100 x 20 = $2000 from one batch of Madhumakki. Next, we need to calculate how many batches of Madhumakki he can prepare with the given amount of money. If it costs him $10 per pound, then he needs $10 x 20 = $200 to prepare one batch of Madhumakki. So, if he has $2000, he can prepare 20 batches of Madhumakki (i.e., $2000 / $10 = 20 batches). Therefore, the total number of batches of Madhumakki Charlie can prepare is 20.
Response:  Meri Ditha is writing a blog post every day for 4 weeks, and each blog post takes him 2 hours to write. So in total, he spends 8 hours (2 hours x 4 days) on writing blog posts per week. Now, if we assume that he works 5 days a week, then he spends 40 hours (8 hours x 5 days) on writing blog posts per week. If we multiply this number by 4 weeks, then Meri Ditha spends a total of 160 hours (40 hours x 4 weeks) on writing blog posts during the period of 4 weeks.
Response:  If Kanchi has posted 80 posts in total and each post contains 5 images, then she has posted a total of 80 x 5 = 400 images.  Now, if she has received 220 likes on her posts, then the average number of likes per image is 220 / 400 = 0.55 likes per image. So, Kanchi has received approximately 0.55 x 400 = 215 likes on all her images combined.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jonas sold his Neelotai for $2000 and bought two guns worth $500 each. So, he spent a total of $1500 on buying guns. Now, let's calculate how much money he gained from selling his Neelotai. As per the question, he gained $8000 from selling it. Therefore, the profit earned by Jonas is: Profit = Selling price - Cost = $8000 - $1500 = $6500.
Response:  We have to find out how many times we can divide 6 into 48 without leaving any remainder.  So, let's divide 48 by 6: 48 / 6 = 8 With remainders. Now, we need to subtract the number of times we can divide 6 into 8 without leaving any remainder: 8 - (6 / 6) = 2 Therefore, there are 2 ways to divide 6 into 48 without leaving any remainder.
"Response:  We know that there are 15 apartments in the building and each apartment has 8 rooms. So, the total number of rooms in the building is:

15 apartments x 8 rooms per apartment = 120 rooms

Now, we need to find out how much space each room has. According to the question, each room has an area of 3/4th of the floor area of each flat. So, the area of each room is:

Area of each room = (3/4) x Floor area of each flat
= (3/4) x 8 vats x 8 feet = 64 square feet

Therefore, the total area of all the rooms in the building is:

Total area of all rooms = 120 rooms x 64 square feet = 7680 square feet

So, the total area of the building is 7680 square feet."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of gold produced per day by Loydal. According to the question, Loydal produces 252 grams of gold per day. Now, let's convert this amount from grams to dollars. The current price of gold is $1340 per ounce, and there are 31.1 grams in an ounce. So, the daily production of gold in dollars can be calculated as follows: Gold Production = Total weight of gold produced x Price of gold per ounce Daily Gold Production = 252 grams x $1340 per ounce = $336,800 per day Now, let's find out how much money Loydal makes selling these 252 grams of gold every day. As mentioned in the question, Loydal sells each gram of gold for $2. Therefore, the daily revenue from gold sales can be calculated as follows: Revenue from Gold Sales = Total weight of gold sold x Selling price of gold per gram Daily Revenue from Gold Sales = 252 grams x $2 per gram = $504 per day Based on the above calculations, Loydal makes $504 per day selling 252 grams of gold.
Response:  The distance between two points is given as 10 miles. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for a boat to travel that distance at a speed of 4 miles per hour. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the time from hours to minutes as follows: Time = Distance / Speed x Number of Hours = 10 miles / 4 mph x 60 min/hr = 250 minutes Therefore, it will take the boat 250 minutes or 4.17 hours to travel 10 miles.
"Response:  If Urisha has written 15 books and each book contains 20 pages, then the total number of pages written by Urisha is:

15 books x 20 pages/book = 300 pages

Now, if we assume that out of these 300 pages, 30 pages are dedicated to illustrations (which is a reasonable assumption given that most children's books have some illustrations), then the total number of text pages in Urisha's books is:

300 pages - 30 pages for illustrations = 270 pages

So, if Urisha were to sell all his books and use the money to buy 30 cats, he would need:

270 pages / 20 pages per cat = 13.5 cats

Therefore, Urisha needs 13.5 cats to buy with the money he gets from selling his books."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of making one truck tire. According to the image provided in page 23, the cost of producing one truck tire is Rs. 1200. Therefore, the total cost of producing 12 truck tires would be:

Total Cost = 12 x Rs. 1200 = Rs. 14,400

Now, let's assume that the production capacity of Mechakneesal is 12 truck tires per day. So, if they produce more than 12 truck tires per day, their daily revenue from selling tires will be:

Daily Revenue = Total Cost / Production Capacity
= Rs. 14,400 / 12 = Rs. 1,200 per day

Therefore, based on the given information, Mechakneesal can earn an additional income of Rs. 1,200 per day by increasing its production capacity beyond 12 truck tires per day."
Response:  We know that there are 7 men and 3 women in the family.  Each man has two wives, so there are 14 women in total (7 men x 2 wives each).  Now, let's count how many children each woman has:  The first wife of the first man has 3 children, the second wife of the same man has 2 children, the third wife of the second man has 2 children, and the fourth wife of the third man has 1 child. Therefore, the total number of children is 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 children. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  Genie gives 30 coins to Banki and takes back 2 coins from him. Now, there are 28 coins left with Genie. To find out how many coins Banki has after giving one coin to each of his two friends, we need to subtract 2 coins (the amount given to each friend) from the total number of coins he had earlier, which is 28 coins. So, Banki has 26 coins left after giving one coin to each of his two friends.
Response:  If Peter has $70 and he wants to buy tickets for himself and his friend who is also named Peter, then they will need a total of $142 (70 x 2) to watch the movie together. So, if their combined amount is $42, they cannot afford to watch the movie together.
"Response:  We have to find out how many boxes of truck can be loaded with pulse worth Rs.500,000 in total weight limit of 375 kg per box.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of boxes that can be loaded with 15 kg of pulse each.  As there are 500,000 rupees worth of pulse, and the price of one kilogram of pulse is Rs. 150, then the total weight of pulse is:

Weight of pulse = Total amount x Price per kg
= 500,000 x 150
= 75,000 kg

Now, as the weight limit for each box is 375 kg, we can divide the total weight of pulse by the weight limit per box to get the number of boxes that can be loaded:

Number of boxes = Total weight / Weight limit per box
= 75,000 / 375
= 200 boxes

Therefore, 200 boxes of truck can be loaded with pulse worth Rs.500,000 in total weight limit of 375 kg per box."
"Response:  We know that the total amount paid to the dealer is $250 and he gave a discount of 25%. So, the original price of the bike was:

$250 / (1 - 0.25) = $340

Now, we need to find out how much the dealer charged for the first four dollars. Since the dealer charged $3.00 per dollar, the charge for the first four dollars would be:

$3.00 x 4 = $12.00

So, the final amount paid by the buyer is:

$340 - $12.00 = $328.00"
"Response:  We have:

Rasberry jam contains 20% sugar and 67% fruit pulp. So, if we take 20 g of raspberry jam, then:

20 g x 20/100 = 4 g of sugar
4 g / 67% = 0.058 g of fruit pulp (since there are 67% fruit pulp in total)

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the ingredients in 20 g of raspberry jam:

0.058 g x 20 g = 1.16 g of fruit pulp
Adding the sugar content, we get:

4 g + 1.16 g = 5.16 g of ingredients in 20 g of raspberry jam."
"Response:  We have:

* 25% of 25 = 6.25 (apparently, this is the amount of money that has been stolen)
* 1/4 of 6.25 = 1.56 (this is how much of the total amount was stolen)
* 20% of 1.56 = 0.31 (this is how much of the remaining amount was spent on bribes)
* 2/3 of 0.31 = 0.20 (this is how much of the remaining amount was spent on other things)
* 80% of 0.20 = 0.16 (this is how much of the remaining amount was left after all expenses were deducted)

Therefore, 25% of the original amount stolen is equal to 6.25, and 80% of that amount is equal to 0.16. So, 25% of the original amount stolen is equivalent to 0.16."
"Response:  If Jenny has $100 to spend on her brother's birthday gift, and she wants to buy something that is at least 20% off, then we can calculate the minimum amount she needs to spend as follows:

Minimum amount = Original price x Discount percentage / 100
= $100 x 20 / 100
= $20

So, Jenny needs to spend at least $20 on her brother's birthday gift."
Response:  If Mars Inc. made $40 million in profit every year for 20 years, and then they stopped making profits after that, their total profit over those 20 years would be: Profit = Annual Profit x Number of Years = $40,000,000 x 20 = $800,000,000 So, if they made $30 million in profit every year for 30 years after that, their total profit over those additional 30 years would be: Total Profit = Annual Profit x Number of Years = $30,000,000 x 30 = $900,000,000 Therefore, the total profit of Mars Inc. over 50 years (including both the initial 20 years of profit and the additional 30 years) would be: Total Profit = $800,000,000 + $900,000,000 = $1,700,000,000
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the monthly subscription fee for one year. As per the given information, the monthly subscription fee is $140. So, the annual subscription fee would be $140 x 12 = $1680. Now, if the company provides a discount of 50% for the second year, then the annual subscription fee for the second year would be ($1680 x 50%) = $840. Therefore, the total amount paid by the customer over two years is $1680 + $840 = $2520.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 tanks of petrol in the car and each tank contains 40 liters of fuel. So, the total amount of fuel in all the tanks is:

$$ \text {Total fuel} = \text {Number of tanks} \times \text{Capacity of each tank} $$

In this case, the number of tanks is 12 and the capacity of each tank is 40 liters, so we can calculate the total fuel as follows:

$$ \text {Total fuel} = 12 \times 40 = 480 \text {liters} $$

Now, we need to convert this value from liters to gallons. There are approximately 3.79 liters in one US gallon, so we can convert the total fuel as follows:

$$ \text {Total fuel (in gallons)} = \frac{\text {Total fuel (in liters)}}{3.79} = 480 \div 3.79 = 126.5 \text {gallons} $$

Therefore, the car has approximately 126.5 gallons of fuel left."
"Response:  We have two coins and we need to find out how many times they will touch each other in half a minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can calculate the number of touches as follows:

Coin 1 will touch Coin 2 once every 30 seconds (since there are 2 coins). Therefore, Coin 1 will touch Coin 2 20 times in half a minute ( since there are 30 seconds in half a minute).

Similarly, Coin 2 will touch Coin 1 once every 30 seconds. So, Coin 2 will touch Coin 1 20 times in half a minute.

Therefore, the total number of touches between the two coins in half a minute is 40 (20 + 20)."
Response:  Firstly, there are 4 schools participating in the tournament.  Each school has one boy and one girl player.  Therefore, the total number of players is 4 x 2 = 8.  Now, each team consists of 5 players, so the total number of players for all teams is 8 x 5 = 40.

Response:  We are given that there are 4 lebuwakos (Baluwas) in total and each one has a house of 16 feet wide. So, the total width of all the houses is: 4 x 16 = 64 feet. Now, we need to find out how many feet long each Baluwa's house is. Since there are 4 such houses, their combined length is: 4 x 32 = 128 feet.
Response:  According to the veterinarian, each dog needs about 180 days of food per year, which means they need about 2 cups of kukur (dog food) every day. If we assume that there are 365 days in a year, then each dog needs about 730 cups of kukur (dog food) per year. Now, if we calculate how many bags of kukur (dog food) this is, we get: 730 cups / 40 cups per bag = 18 bags per year. So, Sesiliales will need about 18 bags of kukur (dog food) per year for each dog.
Response:  If Remando has half of Sara's clothes and Sara has four times as many dresses as Debi, then Remando has 4/2 = 2 dresses. Since Debi has 800 poundsof clothes, Remando has 2/800 = 1/400 pounds of clothes.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages are there in total between page number 2 and page number 23.  To do this, we need to count the number of pages between these two numbers.  Page Number 2 = 2 x (Number of Pages) + 1 = 2 x 20 + 1 = 41 Page Number 23 = 23 x (Number of Pages) + 1 = 23 x 20 + 1 = 49 Therefore, there are 49 pages between page number 2 and page number 23.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the new product. The price of each unit is Rs.300, so the total cost of 30 units will be Rs.9000 (30 x 300 = 9000). Now, let's assume that the company wants to give a discount of 25% on the total cost. So, the amount that the customer needs to pay after applying the discount will be Rs.6750 (9000 x 75%). Therefore, the final answer is Rs.6750.
Response:  We have two vessels - one can hold 24 liters and another can hold 6 liters. So, if we fill the smaller vessel with water from the larger vessel, how much water will be left in the larger vessel?  To find this out, let's divide the capacity of the larger vessel (24 liters) by the capacity of the smaller vessel (6 liters): 24 liters / 6 liters = 4. Therefore, there will be 4 liters of water left in the larger vessel after filling the smaller vessel to its capacity.

Response:  We know that Greta's weight is 125 pounds and Lexa's weight is 4 pounds less than Greta's. So, Lexa's weight is 121 pounds. Now, we need to find out how many times greater Lexa's weight is compared to Greta's weight. To do this, we can divide Lexa's weight by Greta's weight, which gives us: $$ \frac{121}{125} = \boxed{0.96} $$ Therefore, Lexa's weight is $ 0.96 $ times greater than Greta's weight.
Response:  We have to find out how many khandas (units) of gulab are required to fill up three vats of gulab.  Each vat contains 25 gulabs, so we need to divide 3 by 25 to get the number of vats needed to fill one vat.  Therefore, we need 3 / 25 = 0.12 vats to fill one vat. Now, each kanda contains 8 gulabs, so we can divide 0.12 by 8 to get the number of kandas needed to fill one vat. Therefore, we need 0.12 / 8 = 0.15 kandas to fill one vat. So, there are 0.15 kandas of gulab in each vat.
Response:  We know that there are 22 players in each team and each player plays for 8 hours per day. So, total playing time = Number of players x Playing time per player = 22 x 8 = 176 hours. Now, we need to calculate how many days it will take to complete 22 games with 8 hours of playtime per game. Days required = Total playing time / Game duration = 176 hours / 8 hours/game = 22 games. Therefore, it will take 22 games to complete all 22 matches in 8 hours of playtime per game.
Response:  We have to calculate the number of shirts that can be made from 100 meters of fabric as follows:  Firstly, we need to divide the length of the fabric (100 meters) by the width of each piece of fabric (0.5 meters). This gives us the total number of pieces of fabric that can be cut from the length of fabric:  Number of pieces = Length of fabric / Width of each piece = 100 meters / 0.5 meters = 200 pieces.  Next, we need to calculate the number of shirts that can be made from each piece of fabric. Since there are 4 buttons per shirt and each button requires 0.5 meters of fabric, we can calculate the number of shirts as follows:  Number of shirts = Total number of pieces x Number of buttons per shirt = 200 pieces x 8 buttons/shirt = 1600 shirts. Therefore, based on the given information, we can make 1600 shirts from 100 meters of fabric.
Response:  On day one, Gregle had three alarms set to go off at different times. When the first alarm went off, he turned it off immediately and then the second alarm went off after 30 minutes. Then, when the third alarm went off, he again turned it off immediately and then the fourth alarm went off after another 30 minutes. So in total, there were four alarms that went off during the day. The time taken for each alarm to go off was as follows: First alarm - 30 minutes Second alarm - 30 minutes Third alarm - 30 minutes Fourth alarm - 30 minutes Therefore, the total time taken for all four alarms to go off was 4 x 30 = 120 minutes.
Response:  The company pays $600 per month to each employee. According to the company policy, an employee gets a raise of 10% every year. So, after 5 years, the employee will get a raise of 50%. If the last paycheck in December is $600, then the new salary for the next 3 years will be: Year 1: $720 (600 x 1.10) Year 2: $840 (720 x 1.10) Year 3: $960 (840 x 1.10) Therefore, the total increase in salary over 5 years is: $960 - $600 = $360
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marlin's first album sold 10 million copies worldwide. If each book costs $80, then Herald's profit per book would be $80 x 10 = $800. So, if he sells 88 books, his total profit would be $800 x 88 = $69,200.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Christina wants to spend for her party. According to the question, she has invited 75 people and each guest will receive $20 as a gift. Therefore, the total amount of money Christina needs to spend is:

$20 x 75 guests = $1500

Now, let's see how much each guest will get in terms of cash gifts. Since there are 16 guests who have RSVPed yes, the remaining 69 guests (75 - 16) will not receive any cash gift. So, the total amount of money each guest will receive is:

$1500 / 69 guests = $21.74 per guest

Therefore, Christina will need to spend $1500 to buy gifts for all 75 guests, which works out to be approximately $21.74 per guest."
Response:  There are 20 adults and 5 children in total at the picnic. Each adult can eat 10 pieces of cake, and each child can eat half as much (i.e., 5 pieces). So, the total number of pieces of cake that need to be prepared is: 20 adults x 10 pieces = 200 pieces + 5 children x 5 pieces = 25 pieces = 225 pieces of cake needed for the picnic.
Response:  Firstly, Mars has three times more land than Earth, so we can say that Mars has 3 x 510 = 1530 square kilometers of land area.  Secondly, if we assume that each house in Mars has twice as much space as an average Earth house (which is not necessarily true), then we can estimate that there are approximately 2 x 1530 = 3060 houses in Mars.  Finally, if we multiply the number of houses with the average size of a Martian house, which is assumed to be half the size of an average Earth house, we get approximately 3060 x 0.5 = 1530 square meters per house. Therefore, the total living space in Mars for all 1530 houses comes out to be around 1530 x 1530 = 2347500 square meters or roughly 235 hectares.
Response:  Emily is 5 years old and Jack is 2 years old. If James is 10 years old and Cori is 2 years old, then James is older than Cori.

"Response:  If Lilie takes 40 minutes to walk 4 km, then she walks at a speed of 1 km/minute.  Now, if Jerald wants to walk 38 seconds faster than Lilie, he will take 38 seconds less time to cover the same distance. So, his walking speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time taken
= 4 km / (40 + 38)
= 4 km / 78 seconds
= 0.52 km/second
Therefore, Jerald can walk 0.52 km in one second."
Response:  We know that there are 12 houses in each compound and each house has 5 rooms. So, the total number of rooms in all the houses is 12 x 5 = 60 rooms. Now, we need to find out how many people can live in these rooms. If each room can accommodate 4 people, then the total number of people who can live in these 60 rooms is 60 x 4 = 240 people. Therefore, the total number of people living in the entire compound including both old and new buildings is 12 x 5 + 240 = 1380 people.
Response:  We have 200 students in total, and we need to divide them into two groups of 15 each (boys and girls). So, the number of boys is 200 / 2 = 100. And the number of girls is also 200 / 2 = 100. Therefore, there are 50 boys and 50 girls in the school.
Response:  Hyari and James had 9 hours of sleep together. If they slept for 2 hours each, then they would have slept for a total of 18 hours (9 x 2). So, if Hyari slept for an additional 4 hours with James, he would have slept for a total of 22 hours (18 + 4).
Response:  Freda has 16 apples and wants to share them equally among her 3 friends. So, each friend will get 5 apples (16/3 = 5). Now, there are 20 apples left after sharing with the friends. Freda has 20 - 5 = 15 apples left.
Response:  If there are 30 vehicles in front of you and they take 15 minutes to clear the road, then it will take 5 hours for them to clear the entire road (30 vehicles x 15 minutes per vehicle = 450 minutes). Now, if there are 20 vehicles behind you and they take 15 minutes to reach the point where the previous vehicles have cleared the road, then it will take them 3 hours to reach that point (20 vehicles x 15 minutes per vehicle = 300 minutes). So, in total, it will take 8 hours for all the vehicles to clear the road (450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes or 12 hours).
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many bottles of beer are there in total. From the given information, we know that there are 18 bottles of beer in total. Now, let's calculate how much money each bottle of beer costs. According to the information provided, each bottle of beer costs Rs. 50. So, the total cost of all the 18 bottles of beer is: 18 x Rs. 50 = Rs. 900. Now, let's find out how much profit each bottle of beer gives. As per the information provided, each bottle of beer gives a profit of Rs. 20. So, the total profit from all the 18 bottles of beer is: 18 x Rs. 20 = Rs. 360. Therefore, the final answer is: Profit per bottle of beer = Rs. 360 / Rs. 900 = 40%.

Response:  If Amir has 5 kg of rice and he gives 1 kg to each of his three friends, then how much rice will each friend get? So, each friend will get 1/3 = 0.33 kg of rice. Now, if Amir has 5 kg of rice and he gives 2 kg to one of his friends, then that friend will get 2/3 = 0.67 kg of rice. Similarly, if Amir has 5 kg of rice and he gives 3 kg to another friend, then that friend will get 3/3 = 1 kg of rice. Therefore, the total amount of rice given away is: 0.33 + 0.67 + 1 = 2.00 kg.
Response:  We have three boxes of different sizes as follows: Box 1: 5 inches x 6 inches = 30 square inches Box 2: 4 inches x 7 inches = 28 square inches Box 3: 8 inches x 9 inches = 72 square inches Total area of all three boxes = 30 + 28 + 72 = 120 square inches So, the total surface area of all three boxes is 120 square inches.
Response:  On Sunday (Somvar), they watch one episode of their favorite show for 30 minutes. On Monday (Mangalbar), they work for 30 minutes and then take a break to watch an episode of their choice for 30 minutes. On Tuesday (Buddhabar), they work for 60 minutes followed by a 15-minute break to watch an episode of their choice. On Wednesday (Shukrabar), they rest for 2 hours and then watch two episodes of their choice for 30 minutes each. On Thursday (Panchami), they work for 90 minutes followed by a 15-minute break to watch an episode of their choice. On Friday (Ashwin), they work for 75 minutes followed by a 15-minute break to watch an episode of their choice. Based on this pattern, if they worked for 7 hours on Buddhabar, how many episodes of their choice would they have watched in total?  Answer:  To find out how many episodes they will have watched in total, we need to multiply the number of working hours with the number of breaks taken during those hours. In this case, they took 15-minute breaks after every 45 minutes of work, so the total time spent watching TV shows is: 7 x 4 = 28 minutes per day. Therefore, in one week, they will have watched 28 x 7 = 196 minutes of TV shows, which is equal to 3.12 hours.
Response:  Henley had 15 watermelons and gave away 3 every day. So in how many days will he finish all the watermelons?  Solution:  To find out how many days it will take for Henley to finish all the watermelons, we need to divide the total number of watermelons (15) by the number of watermelons he gives away per day (3). Therefore, Henley will finish all the watermelons in 5 days (15 / 3 = 5).
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of gas sold in one day. As per the given information, 300 cylinders are filled with gas every day and each cylinder contains 20 liters of gas. Therefore, the total amount of gas sold in one day is:

Total Gas Sold/Day = Number of Cylinders Filled x Capacity of Each Cylinder
= 300 x 20
= 6000 liters

Now, let's find out how much money the company makes from selling gas. According to the given information, the price of gas is $3 per liter. So, the total revenue generated from selling gas in one day is:

Revenue from Gas Sales/Day = Total Amount of Gas Sold x Price of Gas
= 6000 x $3
= $18,000

Next, we need to subtract the cost of petrol used to run the station from the revenue generated from gas sales. As per the given information, the company spends $20 per liter of petrol. So, the total cost of petrol used in one day is:

Cost of Petrol Used/Day = Total Revenue from Gas Sales x Cost of Petrol
= $18,000 x $20
= $360,000

Finally, we need to find out how much profit the company makes after deducting the cost of petrol from the revenue generated from gas sales. Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $18,000 - $360,000
= -$342,000

Therefore, the company loses $342,000 every day."
Response:  If Mars and Venus are equally good at playing basketball, then they will have equal number of points in their scorecard. However, since Mars has scored more than Venus, it means that Mars is better than Venus in playing basketball. So, the difference between Mars and Venus's scores should be greater than zero. Therefore, we can conclude that Mars has scored more than Venus by at least 24 rolls or 14 rolls.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julie can carry 20 liters of water in her jug. Now, let's calculate how much time it will take for her to fill up the remaining 40 liters of water from the well using the pitcher. Since she has to go back and forth between the well and the jug 16 times (as mentioned in the question), it means she will have to make 16 trips to fill up all the water. So, the time taken for each trip = Distance / Speed = 64 feet / 3 feet per second = 21 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken for Julie to fill up all the water is 21 seconds x 16 trips = 328 seconds or approximately 5 minutes and 28 seconds.
Response:  We have four teachers and each teacher has to teach for two hours daily. So, in total, we have eight hours of teaching per day. Now, if each hour of teaching requires three whiteboards, then we need 24 whiteboards (8 hours x 3 whiteboards/hour). However, since we only have 16 whiteboards available, we will not be able to use all of them. Therefore, the answer is 16.
"Response:  We have to find out how many flowers will bloom in total after 15 days.  Since there are 2 flowers per day, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of flowers per day:

Total no. of flowers = Number of days x No. of flowers/day
= 15 x 2
= 30 flowers

So, after 15 days, there will be 30 flowers in total."
Response:  If Jamal has 1800 photos in his phone and he wants to categorize them into 6 groups with at least 50 photos each, then we can calculate the number of photos that will be left after categorization as follows: Number of photos left = Total number of photos - Number of photos grouped x Number of groups So, if Jamal has 1800 photos and he wants to group them into 6 categories with at least 50 photos each, then the number of photos left after grouping is: Number of photos left = 1800 - (6 x 50) = 1800 - 300 = 1500 photos. Therefore, Jamal will have 1500 photos left after categorizing them into 6 groups with at least 50 photos each.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of the board as follows: Total Cost = Number of boards x Price per board Total Cost = 10 boards x $50 per board = $500 Now, let's assume that they sold all the 10 boards at $16 each. So, their total revenue would be: Revenue = Number of boards sold x Selling price per board Revenue = 10 boards x $16 per board = $160 Therefore, their profit is calculated as follows: Profit = Revenue - Cost Profit = $160 - $500 = -$340 They will incur a loss of $340 if they sell all the 10 boards at $16 each.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Edrian's total income increased from $30,000 to $40,000 in four years. So, his annual income increased by $10,000 per year. Now, let's calculate how much he earned in each of those four years: Year 1: $30,000 x 4 = $120,000 Year 2: $40,000 x 4 = $160,000 Year 3: $50,000 x 4 = $200,000 Year 4: $60,000 x 4 = $240,000 Therefore, Edrian earned a total of $820,000 in those four years.
Response:  If Migulel has 30 sheets of paper and he wants to use each sheet for 30 days, then in total he will have used 30 x 30 = 900 sheets of paper in one month. So, in one year (12 months), he will have used 900 x 12 = 10800 sheets of paper.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 months in a year and each month has either 30 or 31 days. So, the total number of days in a year is:

Days in a year = Number of months x Days per month
= 12 x (30 + 31) / 2
= 365 days

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Number of fruits in a year = 365 fruits/day x Total number of days in a year
= 365 x 365
= 130,700 fruits"
Response:  On Sedile Sombaar (Sunday), there are 8 hours of work. In the next two days (Monday and Tuesday), they have 2 hours less than usual for each day, so it is 6 hours per day. Therefore, in total, they will do 48 hours of work during these four days. If they had 1 hour more work per day during those four days, they would have done 57 hours of work.
Response:  Rosie can walk for 10 minutes per mile, and she has to cover 8 kilometers. So, in total, she will take 8/10 = 0.8 hours (or 48 minutes) to cover that distance. Now, if she walks at a speed of 7 miles per hour, how much time will it take her to cover 7 x 8 = 56 kilometers?
Response:  Jenny has to write 60 letters and needs help from her colleagues. Each letter takes 3 minutes to write, so in total, she needs 60 x 3 = 180 minutes or 3 hours to finish writing all the letters. If it takes 3 hours for Jenny to write all the letters herself, then if she gets help from her colleagues who can each write 20 letters in an hour, they will be able to complete 60 / 20 = 3 hours of work in total. Therefore, with their help, it will take them 3 hours to complete the task.
Response:  Julie had five bags of snacks in her house, and she wanted to share them equally among her four friends. So, each friend would get one bag of snacks. Now, let's count how many bags of snacks each friend got:  Friend 1: 1 bag  Friend 2: 1 bag  Friend 3: 1 bag  Friend 4: 1 bag Total number of bags of snacks shared = 4 bags
"Response:  We have to find out how many vats of rice and lentils are needed for 38 people. Firstly, we need to calculate the number of vats required for each person based on their weight. For an average adult male, it takes around 200 grams of rice per day, which is equivalent to about 1/4 vat (600 grams) per week. Similarly, for an average adult female, it takes around 150 grams of rice per day, which is equivalent to about 1/5 vat (450 grams) per week. Therefore, for 38 people, we will need:

For males: 38 x 200 g/day = 7600 g/week = 1/4 vat/week (600 g)
For females: 38 x 150 g/day = 5700 g/week = 1/5 vat/week (450 g)

Now, let's consider the amount of lentils required. As mentioned in the question, 1 vat (900 g) of lentils can feed 3-4 people for one meal. So, for 38 people, we will need:

Lentils: 38 x 3-4 people/vat = 114-140 people/vat

Therefore, we will need approximately 9-12 vats of lentils for 38 people. Now, let's convert this quantity into actual numbers:

Rice: 1/4 vat/week x 38 people = 9 vats/week (600 g/vat)
Lentils: 9-12 vats/week x 4 vats/vat = 36-48 vats/week (900 g/vat)

So, Delilah needs approximately 36-48 vats of lentils and 9 vats of rice per week for 38 people."
Response:  If there are currently 20 students in the new school and each student brings 5 friends, then the total number of students will be: 20 x 5 = 100 students. So, if 50 more students join the school, the total number of students will be: 100 + 50 = 150 students.
"Response:  If each brick costs $15 and there are 3 bricks in total, then the cost of all three bricks is:

$15 x 3 = $45

So, the total amount of money spent on buying all three bricks is $45."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 500 patients in the hospital who have fever every day.  Each patient has a fever for an average of 24 minutes per day. Therefore, the total time spent by all patients with fever is:

$$ \text {Total time} = \frac{\text{Number of patients with fever }}{ \text{Time spent with fever per patient}} \times 100 $$

= $\boxed{500}$ x $ \boxed{24}$ min/day $\times 3600$ s/day

= $\boxed{144000}$ seconds/day

Now, let's calculate the amount of money doctors earn from treating these patients:

$$ \text{Doctor's income} = \frac{\text{Number of patients treated}}{ \text{Income per patient}} \times 100 $$

= $\boxed{1}$ x $\boxed{500}$ patients/day $\times $\boxed{200}$ dollars/patient

= $\boxed{100000}$ dollars/day

Finally, let's calculate how much the hospital makes from each patient:

$$ \text{Hospital income} = \frac{\text{Total revenue}}{ \text{Number of patients treated}} $$

= $\boxed{200}$ dollars/patient $\divide$ $\boxed{500}$ patients/day

= $\boxed{40000}$ dollars/day

Therefore, the hospital makes approximately $\boxed{40000}$ dollars/day from each patient with fever."
"Response:  If we have 60 employees in total and each employee has to work for 8 hours per day, then the total working hours per day would be:

60 employees x 8 hours/day = 480 working hours/day

Now, if we consider that there are 31 days in April (including weekends), then the total number of working days in April would be:

480 working hours/day x 31 days = 14,520 working hours in April

So, the total number of working hours in April for all 60 employees is 14,520 hours."
Response:  In June, Joseph spent $60 less than he did in May. So, in June, Joseph spent $540 - $60 = $480. Therefore, the total amount that Joseph spent in two months is $540 + $480 = $1020.
Response:  Pam and Fred have 20 tickets each to sell. If they sell their tickets at Rs. 600 per ticket, then together they will make Rs. 12,000 (20 x 600). Now, if they decide to split the money equally among themselves, each of them will get Rs. 6,000 (12,000 / 2). So, in this scenario, both Pam and Fred will end up with Rs. 6,000 each after selling their tickets.
Response:  On Monday ( Sombar), they had 4 milk hides. On Tuesday ( Mangalwar), they had 6 more milk hides than on Monday. So, on Tuesday, they had 4 + 6 = 10 milk hides in total. Now, let's find out how many milk hides they had on Wednesday ( Budhabar). If they had 10 milk hides on Tuesday and they gave away 3 milk hides on Wednesday, then they had 10 - 3 = 7 milk hides left on Wednesday. Therefore, on Wednesday, they had 7 milk hides.
Response:  We are given that in one month (mahina), 4 cars can be sold and each car costs $1500. So, total revenue generated from selling these 4 cars in one month is:  Total Revenue = Number of Cars x Price of Each Car = 4 x $1500 = $6000. Now, we need to find out how many months it will take to sell all the 48 cars if 4 cars are sold per month. To do this, we divide the total number of cars by the number of cars sold per month: Total Months = Total Number of Cars / Number of Cars Sold Per Month = 48 / 4 = 12 months. Therefore, it will take 12 months to sell all the 48 cars if 4 cars are sold per month.
"Response:  Brain's weight is less than 3 kg, so it can be considered as 3 kg for calculation purposes. Now, let's calculate the number of water bottles that Bobi needs to drink to reach his goal of 5 liters of water per day while considering the weight of brain and body:

1. Calculate the volume of water needed per day: 5 liters / day = 0.05 cubic meters (since 1 liter = 0.001 cubic meters)
2. Convert the volume from cubic meters to kilograms: 0.05 cubic meters x (1 kg/0.001 cubic meters) = 5 kg
3. Subtract the weight of the brain from the total weight: Total weight - Brain weight = 70 kg - 1.4 kg = 68.6 kg
4. Divide the remaining weight by the volume of water needed per day: Remaining weight / Volume of water needed per day = 68.6 kg / 0.05 cubic meters = 1372 milliliters (or approximately 1.372 liters)

Therefore, Bobi needs to drink approximately 1.372 liters of water per day to meet his daily water intake goal of 5 liters while considering the weight of his brain and body."
Response:  We know that there are 27 universes in the multiverse and one of them is Earth. So, the number of female unicorns in the multiverse = Number of females in Earth x Total number of unicorns in the multiverse / Number of males in Earth x Total number of unicorns in the multiverse  Therefore, the number of female unicorns in the multiverse = (27/10) x (27/28) = 64.
Response:  We have to calculate the total amount of money that Rorrie has spent as follows:  Firstly, he spent $20 on Subway sandwiches, which is equal to $\$7.50 \times 2 = \$15$.  Secondly, he spent $\$1.50 \times 2 = \$3$ on chips. Thirdly, he spent $\$1.00 \times 2 = \$2$ on cookies. Finally, he received a discount of $\$5.00$, so he actually paid $\$10.00$ for his order. Therefore, the total amount of money that Rorrie spent is: $$ Total = \$15 + \$3 + \$2 + \$10 = \$30 $$

Response:  We have 22 gulabis and 12 neelos in total. If we give 4 gulabis to each of the 3 groups, then how many gulabis will be left for each group? Group A will get 8 gulabis (22 - 4 x 3 = 8), Group B will get 6 gulabis (22 - 4 x 2 = 6), and Group C will get 4 gulabis (22 - 4 = 4). Now, let's calculate the number of neelos that will be left after distributing the gulabis. Since there are 12 neelos in total, if 4 gulabis are distributed among 3 groups, then the number of neelos left for each group is: Group A: 9 neelos (12 - 4 x 3 = 9), Group B: 5 neelos (12 - 4 x 2 = 5), and Group C: 3 neelos (12 - 4 = 3). Therefore, the answer is: Group A has 9 neelos, Group B has 5 neelos, and Group C has 3 neelos.
Response:  We have to find out how many cars are arthard-swachalit (4 wheels) among the total number of cars that can be swachalit (20 vehicles). So, we need to subtract the number of arthard-swachalit cars from the total number of swachalit cars.  According to the question, there are 12 swachalit cars and 4 arthard-swachalit cars. Therefore, the percentage of arthard-swachalit cars is:  (4/12) x 100 = 33.33%
Response:  We know that there are 700 people in the village who have been affected by the flood. Out of them, 300 people have lost their homes and belongings completely. So, the number of people who have partially lost their homes is 400 (700 - 300). Now, among those who have partially lost their homes, some may have lost only some of their belongings, while others may have lost everything including their belongings. Therefore, we cannot say exactly how many people have fully or partially lost their homes without knowing more details about the situation. However, based on the information provided, it seems that around 40% of the people affected by the flood have partially lost their homes (400 out of 700).
Response:  We know that Jordan plays basketball every day for 2 hours. So, in total, he spends 2 x 2 = 4 hours playing basketball per day.
Response:  Jon has $2 in water, $3 in sand, $3 in rubber balls, and $4 in chocolates. If he gives away all his belongings equally among all the people present there, how much will each person get?  We know that there are 10 people present there, so let's calculate the amount each person will get:  Water = $2 / 10 = $0.20 per person Sand = $3 / 10 = $0.30 per person Rubber balls = $3 / 10 = $0.30 per person Chocolates = $4 / 10 = $0.40 per person Total amount each person gets = $0.20 + $0.30 + $0.30 + $0.40 = $1.20 So, each person gets $1.20 worth of goods from Jon.
Response:  Firstly, there are 30 grams of rice and 20 grams of lentils in each bowl. Since there are 15 bowls in total, the total weight of rice is 450 grams (30 x 15 = 450) and the total weight of lentils is 300 grams (20 x 15 = 300). Now, let's calculate the cost of each bowl. The price of rice per kilogram is Rs. 20 and that of lentils per kilogram is Rs. 15. Therefore, the cost of one bowl of rice is Rs. 300 / 450 = Rs. 0.67 per bowl, and the cost of one bowl of lentils is Rs. 300 / 300 = Rs. 1 per bowl. So, the total cost of all 15 bowls is Rs. 0.67 x 15 = Rs. 10.25 for rice and Rs. 1 x 15 = Rs. 15 for lentils, making the total cost of all 15 bowls to be Rs. 25.25.
"Response:  Jon has 10 hectares of land and each hectare produces 100 watermelons per season. If John can harvest 3 melons per day, then in one year he will be able to harvest:

Number of days in a year = 365 days

Total number of watermelons that John can harvest in a year = Number of hectares x Number of watermelons produced per hectare x Number of days in a year
= 10 hectares x 100 watermelons/hectare x 365 days
= 36,500 watermelons

Therefore, John will be able to harvest 36,500 watermelons in one year."
Response:  If Jonil gave away 500 boxes of toys with each box containing 3 guns, then he gave away in total 1500 guns (500 x 3 = 1500). Now, if some of the Legos were broken during transportation and only 70% of them reached their destination safely, then the number of intact Lego sets that Jonil received would be 1100 (70% of 1500 = 1100). Therefore, the number of Lego pieces that Jonil got was 3600 (1100 x 3 = 3600).
Response:  Firstly, Debrala had 60% of her savings in the bank account which was worth Rs.30,000. She then withdrew Rs.20,000 from the account and spent it on various expenses. After that, she deposited Rs.15,000 back into the account. So, at this point, Debrala had Rs.45,000 in her bank account. Now, let's calculate how much percentage of her original savings is left in the account after all these transactions. The total amount of money Debrala had initially was Rs.30,000 (60% of her savings). Then, she withdrew Rs.20,000 and spent it, leaving her with Rs.10,000 (Rs.30,000 - Rs.20,000 = Rs.10,000). Next, she deposited Rs.15,000 back into the account, bringing the new balance to Rs.25,000 (Rs.10,000 + Rs.15,000 = Rs.25,000). Finally, we have to subtract the amount she originally withdrew (Rs.20,000) from the current balance (Rs.25,000), which gives us the remaining amount in the account, i.e., Rs.5,000 (Rs.25,000 - Rs.20,000 = Rs.5,000). Therefore, out of her initial 60% of savings, Debrala has Rs.5,000 left in her bank account after all the transactions.

Response:  Steve and Tim have agreed to race their skateboards from School A to School B. The distance between the two schools is 3 miles (4.8 kilometers). Each of them has a skateboard with wheels that are 26 inches in diameter. They will start at the same time and race against each other. If they want to know how long it would take for one of them to reach home after winning the race, we need to calculate the speed of each skateboard.  Since both skateboards have the same size of wheels, their speeds can be calculated using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time taken to cover the distance.  For Steve's skateboard, he covers a distance of 3 miles in 1 minute and 20 seconds, so his speed is: Speed = 3 miles / 1 min 20 sec = 19.5 mph (31.4 km/h)  Similarly, for Tim's skateboard, he covers a distance of 3 miles in 1 minute and 40 seconds, so his speed is: Speed = 3 miles / 1 min 40 sec = 17.5 mph (28.2 km/h)  Now, let's assume that if either of them wins the race, they will ride their skateboard back home directly without any stops or detours. Therefore, we can estimate the time taken to reach home based on their average speed during the race.  For Steve, since he covered a distance of 3 miles in 1 minute and 20 seconds, his average speed during the race was: Avg. Speed = Total Distance / Time taken to cover the distance = 3 miles / 1 min 20 sec = 20 mph (32.2 km/h)  To find out how long it would take him to reach home after winning the race, we can multiply his average speed by the distance between School A and Home: Time = Avg. Speed x Distance = 20 mph x 3 miles = 60 minutes  So, it would take Steve approximately 60 minutes to reach home after winning the race.  Similarly, for Tim, his average speed during the race was: Avg. Speed = Total Distance / Time taken to cover the distance = 3 miles
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how much time it takes for one person to fill up one tank of gasoline. As per the given information, each tank holds 25 gallons of gasoline and it costs $2.50 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost of filling one tank is:

$2.50 x 25 = $62.50

Now, let's assume that there are 10 people in total who need to fill their tanks with gasoline. So, the total cost of filling all the tanks will be:

$62.50 x 10 = $625

Therefore, the answer to the question is $625."
Response:  We have to calculate how many packets of chocolates Carl can buy with his budget of $10. Since each packet contains 6 pieces of chocolate and costs $1.60 per piece, we need to divide the total amount he has ($10) by the cost of one piece of chocolate ($1.60): $$ \frac {10}{1.60} = 6 $$ So, Carl can buy 6 packets of chocolates with his budget of $10.
Response:  We know that Debal is eating French fries and drinking beer. He has already eaten 14 French fries. Now he wants to eat more French fries. But his stomach is full, so he can only eat half of another French fry. Therefore, Debal will eat 7 more French fries.
Response:  On Somvar (Monday), Budhabar (Wednesday) and Shukrabar (Friday), students attend classes for 3 hours each day. So, in total, they attend classes for 9 hours (3 x 3 = 9). Now, let's calculate how many days they attend classes in a semester of 16 weeks. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, there will be 4 x 4 = 16 weeks in a semester. Therefore, the students attend classes for 9 hours/week x 16 weeks = 144 hours in a semester.
Response:  We have 4 roles (A, B, C, and D), each with its own set of responsibilities: A has 6 tasks, B has 8 tasks, C has 10 tasks, and D has 2 tasks. If all these tasks are equally important, then the total number of tasks for each role is:  Tasks per Role = Total Number of Tasks / Number of Roles = 35/4 = 8.75 tasks per role. So, in this scenario, each person would be responsible for approximately 9 tasks (8.75 x 4).
"Response:  If each bird lays 2 eggs per month and there are 3 birds in total, then the total number of eggs laid per month is:

3 birds x 2 eggs/month = 6 eggs/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs laid over 4 months:

Total number of eggs laid = Number of months x Number of eggs laid/month
= 4 months x 6 eggs/month
= 24 eggs

So, in total, the birds will lay 24 eggs over 4 months."
"Response:  Black and White are playing chess for 15 minutes. In that time, Black makes 10 moves, while White makes 34 moves. If we assume that each move takes approximately 1 minute to make (which is a rough estimate), then...

Black spent 10 x 1 = 10 minutes making moves.
White spent 34 x 1 = 34 minutes making moves.
So, in total, Black spent 10 minutes + 34 minutes = 44 minutes making moves during those 15 minutes of gameplay."

Each game has its own price as follows: Car racing - $40, Horse riding - $30, Fishing - $20, Golf - $50, and Tennis - $80. So, if we want to know the price of one equation figure, it will be $5 because that is the only option among these five games that costs $5. Therefore, the price of one equation figure is $5.
"Response:  If they can work for 3 hours per day and earn $35 per hour, their daily income will be:

$35/hour x 3 hours/day = $105 per day

Now, let's calculate their monthly income:

$105 per day x 30 days in a month = $3,150 per month

So, if they work for 90 days (which is approximately 3 months), their total income would be:

$3,150 per month x 90 days = $276,500

Therefore, if they work for 90 days, they could potentially earn around $276,500."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Ellibiralle received from his parents as an inheritance. According to the question, he received 109,000 yuan, which is equivalent to approximately $16,572 USD (based on the current exchange rate).  Next, we need to calculate the cost of the computer equipment that Ellibiralle purchased with the inherited money. The cost of each item is given in the table below:

| Item | Cost (yuan) |
| --- | --- |
| Computer | 10,900 |
| Monitor | 3,800 |
| Keyboard | 1,400 |
| Mouse | 500 |
| Printer | 2,200 |

Total cost = 10,900 + 3,800 + 1,400 + 500 + 2,200 = 19,800 yuan

Now, let's convert the total cost from yuan to US dollars using the current exchange rate:

19,800 yuan x 0.16572 USD/Yuan = 3,176.80 USD

Therefore, Ellibiralle spent approximately $3,176.80 USD on computer equipment with the inheritance money he received from his parents."
Response:  Sandra has to make 9 patty cakes for each of her 4 children, and she wants to use 3 cups of flour for all the patty cakes. If she uses 15 cups of flour in total for making all the patty cakes, then how many patty cakes can she make per child?  We know that 1 cup of flour makes 4 patty cakes, so if Sandra uses 15 cups of flour, she can make 15 x 4 = 60 patty cakes in total. Since there are 4 children, each child will get 60 / 4 = 15 patty cakes.
"Response:  We know that there are two types of umbrellas - one with a diameter of 12 inches and another with a diameter of 18 inches.  If we assume that each umbrella has a lifespan of 2 years, then:

For an umbrella with a diameter of 12 inches:
Lifespan = 2 years x 12 months/year = 24 months

For an umbrella with a diameter of 18 inches:
Lifespan = 2 years x 18 months/year = 36 months

So, the difference in lifespan between the two sizes is:
Difference = 36 months - 24 months = 12 months

Therefore, if you have two umbrellas with different diameters (one with a diameter of 12 inches and another with a diameter of 18 inches), the larger umbrella will last for approximately 12 months more than the smaller one."
"Response:  If Jimi earns $2 more than Ethel, and Ethel earns $8 less than Jerry, then we can write an equation as follows:  Jimi = Ethel + $2; or, in mathematical notation: J = E + $2. Now, if Jerry earns $6 more than Jimi, we can rewrite the equation as: Jerry = Jimi + $6; or, in mathematical notation: J = J + $6. Substituting the value of Jimi from the first equation into the second equation gives us: Jerry = (E + $2) + $6; or, simplifying: Jerry = E + $8. So, Jerry earns $8 more than Ethel. Therefore, the correct answer is: Jerry earns $8 more than Ethel."
Response:  We know that Pancho has 20 miles to walk in 7 days. So he will have to walk 20/7 = 3 miles per day on average. Now we are given that he walked 10 miles in one week. So in 5 weeks, he would have walked 10 x 5 = 50 miles. Therefore, Pancho has walked 50 - 30 = 20 miles more than what was left for him to walk. Hence, he has walked 20 miles in addition to the 20 miles he had already walked.
"Response:  We know that each band has 5 members and there are 3 bands in total. So, the total number of people in all three bands is:

5 x 3 = 15

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of each person's uniform. Since we don't have any information about the cost per person, let's assume it's equal for everyone. Therefore, the total cost of all 15 people's uniforms would be:

15 x Cost Per Person = $750

So, the answer to the question is $750."
"Response:  If there are 80 watermelons in total and each watermelon weighs an average of 9 kg, then the total weight of all watermelons is:

80 watermelons x 9 kg/watermelon = 720 kg

Now, if there are 90 watermelons that are completely rotten, their total weight is:

90 watermelons x 9 kg/watermelon = 810 kg

So, the total weight of all watermelons including both good and bad ones is:

720 kg + 810 kg = 1530 kg

Therefore, the total number of kilograms of watermelons that Jack has is:

1530 kg / 10 kg (per jack) = 153 jackson

So, Jack has approximately 153 jacks of watermelons."
Response:  We have to calculate the total number of years for which Salli has worked as a nurse and then add that to her age at the time she retired.  So, first we need to find out how many years Salli worked as a nurse. According to the question, Salli worked as a nurse for 20 years before retiring at the age of 60. Therefore, the total number of years Salli worked as a nurse is: 20 years = 20 x 1 year = 20 years Now, let's find out how old Salli was when she retired. According to the question, Salli was 60 years old when she retired. Therefore, the difference between Salli's age at retirement and her age at the time she started working as a nurse is: Age at retirement - Age at start of work = 60 - 40 = 20 years Finally, we can calculate the total number of years Salli worked as a nurse plus her age at retirement: Total number of years = Number of years worked + Age at retirement = 20 + 20 = 40 years So, the total number of years Charavata Charaaharoo worked as a nurse is 40 years.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Jesica has borrowed from her school fees, credit card, and home loan.  The total amount is: School fees x 50% = $300/month Credit card debt x 20% = $200/month Home loan interest = $500/month Total amount = $1,000/month Now, if the minimum payment percentage increases by 5%, the new minimum payment will be: New minimum payment = Old minimum payment x (1 + 0.05) = $1,000 x 1.05 = $1,050 So, Jesica needs to pay $1,050 per month for the next year to fulfill the minimum payment requirement.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the time taken for Billi to make one salad. According to the given information, it takes Bilie 20 minutes to prepare one salad. So, if he is preparing 60 salads, it will take him 60 x 20 = 1200 minutes or 20 hours to complete the task.

"Response:  Firstly, Jaydalle has to pay $200 for his own house rent and other expenses, which is equal to $\$700 \times \frac{1}{6} = \$116.67$.  Secondly, he has to give $\$800 \times \frac{1}{6} = \$133.33$ as donation to the organization. Therefore, the total amount of money that Jaydalle has to pay is:

$$Total = \$116.67 + \$133.33 = \$250$$
So, if Jaydalle makes $\$200 per month, then he will have to pay $\$250 - \$200 = \$50$ more than what he earns every month."
Response:  Rani has 10 apples and gives 4 to Bosu. So, Rani now has 6 apples left (10 - 4 = 6). If Bosu had 40 apples before receiving any from Rani, then he now has 36 apples (40 - 4 = 36). Therefore, the total number of apples among Rani and Bosu is 6 + 36 = 42 apples.
"Response:  We have to find out how much money Loyd can make in total and then calculate how much he will get after paying taxes of $10 per hour.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of hours worked by Lloyd in each shift. He worked for 5 hours in his first shift and 8 hours in his second shift. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by Lloyd is:

$$ \text {Total hours} = 5 + 8 = 13 $$

Now, let's calculate the amount earned by Lloyd in each shift:

For the first shift:

$$ \text{Earnings} = 10 \times 5 = 50 $$

For the second shift:

$$ \text{Earnings} = 10 \times 8 = 80 $$

Now, let's add the earnings from both shifts to find out the total amount earned by Lloyd:

$$ \text{Total earnings} = 50 + 80 = 130 $$

Finally, we need to subtract the taxes paid by Lloyd:

$$ \text{Net earnings} = 130 - 10 = 120 $$

Therefore, Lloyd made a total of $120 after working two shifts."
Response:  There are two students competing for one seat in class representative position. If the winner gets 3 marks and the loser gets 2 marks, then the total number of marks gained by all the participants is 5 (3 + 2). Now, if there are 80 students participating in the election, then the total number of marks gained by all the winners is 80 x 5 = 400.
Response:  If Sandeepa has to fill up Freddy's order of 5 bags of rice in exactly 4 minutes and 30 seconds as per the given condition, then we need to calculate how many bags of rice he can fill in that time frame.  We know that each bag of rice takes 1 minute to fill, so Sandeepa can fill 5 bags of rice in 5 minutes (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute). Therefore, Sandeepa can fill 25 bags of rice in 4 minutes and 30 seconds ( since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute and 4 minutes and 30 seconds is equal to 240 seconds).  So, the answer is 25 bags of rice.
Response:  We know that in two years, Jenny will be 30 years old. If she is currently 28 years old, then in two years, she will be 30 years old. So, the answer is 30 years.
Response:  We have two towers with heights of 40 and 50 meters respectively. The distance between them is 200 meters. Each tower has 10 floors, and each floor has a diameter of 8 meters. How many seconds will it take for the water from one tower to reach the other?  Firstly, let's calculate the time taken for the water to travel from one tower to another in straight line. The distance between the towers is 200 meters, which means the water will take 200/60 = 3.33 minutes (or 200 seconds) to reach the other tower directly. However, since the water flows downwards at an angle, we need to consider the time taken for the water to flow through the air. Let's assume that the angle of descent is 30 degrees. Then, the time taken for the water to flow through the air can be calculated as follows: Time = Distance x Sin(angle) = 200 x Sin(30) = 13.33 seconds Therefore, the total time taken for the water to reach the other tower is 3.33 + 13.33 = 16.66 seconds.

So, in total, there are 365 - 17 = 348 weekdays in a year."
Response:  If Jenna has $20 to spend and she wants to buy something from each of the three stores, then we can calculate how much she can spend at each store as follows: Store A: $20 / 3 = $6 per item Store B: $20 / 4 = $5 per item Store C: $20 / 5 = $4 per item So, if Jenna buys one item from each of the three stores, she will have spent a total of: $6 + $5 + $4 = $15 Now, let's say that each item costs half of what Jenna can afford to spend. Then, the cost of each item is: $15 / 2 = $7.50 Therefore, the answer is $7.50.
Response:  We have to find out how many chuahar (cups) of water are required for each animal in the group.  There are 10 animals in total, and each animal requires 3 cups of water per day. So, the total number of cups of water required for all the animals is 10 x 3 = 30 cups. Now, we need to divide this amount among the three groups of animals based on their sizes. Group A has 5 animals, so they require 30 / 5 = 6 cups of water per day. Group B has 4 animals, so they require 30 / 4 = 7.5 cups of water per day. And Group C has 3 animals, so they require 30 / 3 = 10 cups of water per day. Therefore, the total number of cups of water required for all the animals in each group is as follows: Group A - 6 cups, Group B - 7.5 cups, and Group C - 10 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Myanmar is currently at $100 per dollar. So, if they want to buy $200 worth of goods every month, they will need $200 / $100 = 2 dollars per month. Now, let's assume that Myanmar can afford to pay $3 months in advance, so they will have to pay $3 x 2 = 6 dollars in total. Therefore, the answer is 6 dollars.
"Response:  The farmer has to sell his wheat at Rs. 20 per dal (i.e., 1/4 kg). So, he will get Rs. 5 for selling 1/4 kg of wheat. Now, let's calculate how much money the farmer will get if he sells all his wheat.

So, the total amount of wheat the farmer has is 200 kg x 4 = 800 kg.

Therefore, the total amount of money the farmer will get from selling all his wheat is:

800 kg x Rs. 5/kg = Rs. 4,000

So, the correct answer is Rs. 4,000."

Response:  Jon has 3 hours to complete his work. He can complete 2 watts of work in one minute. So, he will take 3 minutes to complete 1 watt of work. Therefore, he will take 6 minutes (3 x 2) to complete 2 watts of work. Now, let's calculate how many minutes it will take him to complete 5 watts of work: 5 watts / 2 = 2.5 watts per minute. So, it will take him 4 minutes (2.5 x 2) to complete 5 watts of work.
Response:  We know that Batta Khalle has 35 ponds and each pond can hold 10 baths of water. So, in total, Batta Khalle can hold 35 x 10 = 350 baths of water. Now, if we assume that they use 8 kilos of rice per day, then we need to calculate how many days it will take for them to consume all the water stored in Batta Khalle. To do this, we divide the total amount of water stored in Batta Khalle (350 baths) by the daily consumption of rice (8 kg/day). Therefore, it will take approximately 437.5 days (350 / 8) for Batta Khalle to store enough water for their daily needs.
Response:  We are given that in every year, Tom gains 2 vats of land. So after 10 years, he will have gained 2 x 10 = 20 vats of land. Now, we are also given that he loses 50% of his total land every year. So after 10 years, he will have lost 50% of 20 = 10 vats of land. Therefore, Tom has 20 - 10 = 10 vats of land left after 10 years.
Response:  On Sunday, March 20th, Sukho and his friends painted 18 floral plates with different colors. On Wednesday, March 23rd, they made another set of 10 floral plates with new colors. So, in total, they painted 28 floral plates with different colors.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the new car. The price of the new car is $20,000 and the down payment is $5,000. So, the total cost of the new car is: $20,000 + ($5,000 x 50%) = $30,000. Now, let's calculate how much money Biyolote will have left after buying the new car. He has $20,000 in his account and he spends $30,000 on the new car. Therefore, he will have $20,000 - $30,000 = -$10,000 left in his account.
Response:  We have two pensils with different prices - $120 and $30. If we buy 8 pensils, how much will it cost in total? To find out, we need to calculate the price of each penil and then multiply it by the number of pensils we want to buy. So, the total cost of buying 8 pensils is: $120 x 8 = $960 + $30 x 8 = $240 = $1,120 Therefore, the total cost of buying 8 pensils is $1,120.
Response:  We have 40 resturants in the city and each restaurant has 2 pound of garbage per day. So, total amount of garbage produced by all restaurants is : 40 x 2 = 80 pounds per day.
Response:  We are given that there are 23768 people in the city and among them, 8417 males and 9092 females. Now, we need to find out how many children (i.e., below 18 years) are there in the city. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of Children = Total Population x Percentage of Children Among total population, percentage of children is given as 35%. So, number of children = Total Population x 0.35 = 23768 x 0.35 = 8069 Therefore, there are approximately 8069 children in the city.
Response:  In one month, there are 20 cards with 3 guns each = 60 guns in total.  Then, in the next month, they got 15 more cards with 3 guns each = 45 guns in total. So, now there are 105 guns in total (60 + 45). Now, let's calculate how many cards have been used in total. If they used 20 cards in the first month and 15 cards in the second month, then the total number of cards used is 20 + 15 = 35 cards. Therefore, there are 105 - 35 = 70 cards left.
Response:  Mark has written 100 sentences and wants to divide them equally among two editors. Each editor will get 50 sentences each. Now, let's calculate how many words each editor will have in total.  For Mark, he has 100 sentences, which means he has 100 x 5 = 500 words. Since he is giving equal share to both editors, each editor will get 500 / 2 = 250 words. Therefore, each editor will have 250 words in total.
"Response:  Baldurala has to carry water from Kuvabe every day for 5 days in a week. Each trip takes him 6 hours and he can carry 30 liters of water at a time. So, how much water does he have to carry per day?

Answer:  To calculate this, we need to multiply the number of trips (5 days/week) with the duration of each trip (6 hours). This gives us a total of 30 hours per week spent carrying water. Now, let's convert this to liters:

30 hours/week x 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes/week
Now, let's convert this to liters:

1 liter = 60 minutes
So, the total amount of water carried by Baldurala per week is:

1800 minutes / 60 minutes/liter = 30 liters/week"
Response:  Jonas has earned $500,000 from his job and he wants to save $200,000 of it for each of the next 4 years. He also wants to invest $100,000 in stocks every year. So, after 4 years, he will have saved $800,000 ($200,000 x 4) and invested $400,000 ($100,000 x 4) in stocks. Now, let's calculate how much money he will have after 4 years: Savings = $800,000 Investment in stocks = $400,000 Total amount after 4 years = Savings + Investment = $1,200,000 Therefore, after 4 years, Jonas will have $1,200,000 in total.
Response:  We have to find out how much Josi can produce in one year if he has 10 acres of land and each acre produces 5 tons of potatoes per season.  So, total production of potatoes from all 10 acres will be 50 tons (5 tons/acre x 10 acres). Now, we need to calculate how many bags of 20 kg each Josi can make from these 50 tons of potatoes. To do this, we divide the total production of potatoes by the weight of each bag (20 kg). Therefore, Josi can make 250 bags of potatoes (50 tons / 20 kg/bag) per season.
Response:  According to the given information, every day for 7 days, they had to eat 2 sandwiches made of paneer and amla (Indian gooseberry) each, which means they consumed a total of 14 sandwiches in 7 days. Now, let's calculate how many grams of protein they consumed from these sandwiches. Each sandwich contains approximately 30 grams of protein, so they consumed a total of 420 grams of protein from those sandwiches alone (14 sandwiches x 30 grams/sandwich = 420 grams). Then, they added 8 slimy rice balls to their diet per day, which contain approximately 5 grams of protein each, so they consumed a total of 40 grams of protein from those rice balls (8 rice balls x 5 grams/rice ball = 40 grams). Therefore, the total amount of protein they consumed in 7 days was 460 grams (420 grams + 40 grams).
Response:  Jennet has 22 vats of rice and 10 vats of wheat. She wants to distribute them equally among 6 families. So each family will get how much rice and wheat?  Now, let's calculate the total amount of rice and wheat that each family will receive. For rice, each family will get 9 vats (9 x 22 = 198) and for wheat, each family will get 6 vats (6 x 10 = 60). Therefore, the total amount of rice and wheat that each family will receive is 198 + 60 = 258.
Response:  Shri Bartle gives six semesters of mathematics to each student. Each semester has five periods per week. Therefore, in total, he teaches for 6 x 5 = 30 periods per semester. Since there are six semesters in one academic year, Shri Bartle teaches for a total of 30 x 6 = 180 periods in an academic year. Now, if Brainly scores less than 93 in any of the six semesters, then according to the rule given in the question, Brainly will have to appear for additional exams. So, the number of exams that Brainly needs to appear for is equal to the difference between his actual score and 93. If Brainly scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 in the six semesters respectively, then he needs to appear for 89 - 93 = 4 additional exams, 71 - 93 = 22 additional exams, 92 - 93 = 1 additional exam, 100 - 93 = 7 additional exams, and 86 - 93 = 7 additional exams. Therefore, Brainly needs to appear for a total of 4 + 22 + 1 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 55 additional exams.
Response:  Firstly, Michael walked for 5 minutes at a speed of 25 km/h. This means he covered a distance of 5 x 25 = 125 meters in that time frame. Then, he took a break and rested for 30 minutes. During this break, his speed was zero. After the break, he resumed walking and maintained an average speed of 25 km/h throughout the journey. Therefore, in the next 45 minutes (i.e., 30 minutes + 15 minutes), he traveled a distance of 45 x 25 = 1125 meters. Finally, he walked for another 60 minutes with an average speed of 25 km/h, covering a distance of 60 x 25 = 1500 meters. So, in total, Michael walked a distance of 125 + 1125 + 1500 = 3850 meters during his entire journey.

So, the total cost of purchasing 20 drums of oil is Rs. 2400."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The cost of the jacket is $30, and each shoe costs $20. Therefore, the total cost of both items is $50 ($30 + $20). Now, let's see how much money each child will get after selling their old clothes. Each child has four pants and four shirts, which they can sell for $5 each. So, in total, they will get $20 ($5 x 4) from selling their old clothes. Finally, we need to subtract the amount that each child will get from selling their old clothes from the total cost of the new jacket and shoes. In this case, the difference is $30 ($50 - $20), so each child will receive $10 as a gift from their parents.
Response:  Jeri has to make 3 sets of 5 candles each day and sell them for Rs. 42 per set. If he sells all his candles in the evening, then he will have Rs. 1320 as total sales revenue per day (Rs. 42 x 3 sets). Now, if he wants to know how much he can earn if he makes two extra candles every day, we need to calculate the additional income from those two candles. So, let's assume that he sells each extra candle for Rs. 42, then the additional income from these two candles would be Rs. 84 (Rs. 42 x 2 candles). Therefore, Jeri's daily income would be Rs. 1320 + Rs. 84 = Rs. 1404.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of one mile (1.5 miles) is equal to the total distance traveled (6 miles). So, we can write an equation as follows: Distance = Total distance / Length of one mile  Distance = 6 miles / 1.5 miles  Distance = 4 miles Now, if it takes 3 minutes to travel each mile, then the time taken to travel 4 miles will be: Time = Distance x Speed  Time = 4 miles x 3 minutes/mile  Time = 12 minutes Therefore, it would take approximately 12 minutes to cover a distance of 4 miles while walking at a speed of 3 minutes per mile.
Response:  On day one, there are 100 customers who enter the store and spend $50 each, so the total amount spent is $5000. If we assume that the number of customers increases by 50 per day, then on the tenth day, there will be 500 customers who have entered the store, spending a total of $25,000 ($50 x 500 customers). Therefore, if 500 customers enter the store every day for 10 days, they will have spent a total of $75,000 ($25,000 x 10 days).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry has 4 liters of water in his container and he wants to measure out exactly 2 liters for himself. So, after measuring out 2 liters from Jerry's container, there will be 2 liters left in the container.  Now, let's consider how much water Harvey has. We are told that Harvey has 8 liters of water in his container, which is twice as much as Jerry. Therefore, if Jerry has 2 liters left in his container after measuring out 2 liters for himself, then Harvey must have 4 liters (i.e., half of what Jerry had) left in his container.  Finally, we are asked whether Harvey has more or less than 4 liters of water in his container. Based on our calculations above, we can see that Harvey indeed has less than 4 liters of water in his container, specifically 3 liters to be exact.  So, the answer is B - Less than 4 liters.
Response:  Lorraine has $32 and wants to buy something that costs $32 or $32 worth of belts.  If she buys one item that costs $32, then she will have $0 left.  If she buys two items that cost $32 each, then she will have $64 left ($32 x 2 = $64).  Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $64.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Jenny has in her wallet and then calculate what percentage of it is left after buying the $200 dress.  So, let's assume that Jenny has $1000 in her wallet initially.  Now, she spends $200 on the dress, which means she has $800 left ($1000 - $200 = $800). Therefore, the percentage of money left after buying the dress is (($800 / $1000) x 100%) = 80%.
Response:  We know that in full bloom, there are 4 flowers per branch (as given in the question). So, if we multiply this number with the total branches (7), we get: 4 x 7 = 28 flowers in full bloom. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the tree is 28.

Response:  The time taken to complete one card game is 10 minutes and Sudoku puzzle is 5 minutes. So, in total, it will take 3 hours (10 + 5) to finish both games. Now, if they play for 7 days straight without any breaks, they will have played a total of 21 hours (3 x 7).
Response:  We have to fill 120 liters of water in a tank with a capacity of 150 liters. So, we need to subtract 30 liters from 120 liters, which is equal to 90 liters. Therefore, the remaining amount of water that can be filled in the tank is 90 liters.
Response:  We have to find out how many flowers will be left after applying 90% of water and then calculate how much water is left for the remaining 40%. So, we can start with the total number of flowers initially which is 100. Now, if we apply 90% of water, we will get: 90/100 = 0.9 or 90% of the initial amount of water. So, the amount of water left after applying 90% of water is: 100 - (0.9 x 100) = 100 - 90 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 flowers left after applying 90% of water. Now, let's calculate how much water is left for the remaining 40% of flowers. To do this, we need to divide the total amount of water by the percentage of water left after application of 90%. So, we have: Water left for remaining flowers = Total water - Water applied = 100 - 10 = 90. Therefore, there are 40 flowers left after applying 90% of water, and they will receive 90% of the total water available.
Response:  The company spent $150,000 in one year for advertising and promotions, and then it reduced that amount to half for the next year. So, the company spent $75,000 for advertising and promotions in the second year. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company spent on advertising and promotions over two years: Year 1: $150,000 + Year 2: $75,000 = $225,000 Total amount spent on advertising and promotions over two years: $225,000
Response:  If Carlos takes 30 days to complete his work and Benji takes 18 days to complete his work, then in total they will take 48 days (30 + 18) to complete their work together. Now, if Carlos works for 3 hours per day and Benji works for 2 hours per day, then together they will work for a total of 96 hours (3 x 30 + 2 x 18). Therefore, the total amount earned by them is $960 ($3 x $30 + $2 x $18).
Response:  The distance between New Jersey and Roscoe is approximately 6 days traveling at an average speed of 40 mph (64 km/h).

Response:  James has 30 cards of Agni, 20 cards of Ganas, and 40 cards of Pani. If he takes away 8 cards of Pani, how many cards will he have left?  We know that 1 card of Pani is equal to 8 gol (coins). So, if he takes away 8 cards of Pani, he will have 40 - 8 = 32 cards left. Therefore, the probability that he will have at least one card of each type is 32/70 or approximately 0.46.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Chadale Khajaako has $650 in his account and he wants to withdraw $30 as cashback. So, the amount of money he will have after withdrawing $30 is:

$650 - $30 = $620

Now, let's see how much money he will have after buying mas, panir, evoketo, and sasu. He bought mas for $1 dollar, panir for $1 dollar, evoketo for $2 dollars, and sasu for $2 dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money he spent on these items is:

$1 + $1 + $2 + $2 = $6

So, the remaining amount of money he has after buying these items is:

$620 - $6 = $614

Finally, since he got $5 dollars as cashback, his new balance in the bank is:

$614 + $5 = $619

Therefore, the answer is $619."
Response:  Kalindi has 360 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day. So, she can do 360/24 = 15 minutes of work per hour. Since there are 7 days in a week, she can do 15 x 7 = 105 minutes of work per week. Now, let's calculate how many hours she can work in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so she can do 105 minutes / 4 = 26.25 hours of work per month. Finally, to find out how many working hours she can have in a year, we need to multiply the number of months in a year with her monthly working hours. There are 12 months in a year, so she can do 26.25 x 12 = 318 hours of work per year.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of water required for irrigation in two months as follows:

Total water required = Water needed for irrigation x Number of days in two months
= 300 liters/day x (60 days + 20 days) / 100
= 54,000 liters

Now, let's assume that each pot contains 30 liters of soil and requires 30 liters of water per day for irrigation. Therefore, the number of pots that can be grown in one hectare of land is as follows:

Number of pots = Total water required / Water required per pot
= 54,000 liters / 30 liters/pot
= 1800 pots

So, if there are 300 liters of water available in two months, then the number of pots that can be grown in one hectare of land is:

Number of pots = Available water x Number of days in two months
= 300 liters x 60 days / 100
= 180 pots

Therefore, based on the given information, you can grow approximately 180 pots of crops in one hectare of land using the provided water supply over a period of two months."
"Response:  Markel has 12 cars and each car costs $20,000. Therefore, the total cost of all the cars is:

$12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Now, they sell 10% of their cars, which means they sell:

$240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000

So, they make $24,000 from selling 10% of their cars."
Response:  On Sunday (Sombar), Kaili and Robert dug up 5 vats of gold worth Rs. 20 million each, which is equal to 100 vats of gold in total.  On Monday ( Mangalwar), Kaili alone dug up 2 more vats of gold worth Rs. 20 million each, which is equal to 4 vats of gold in total. So, the total number of vats of gold that Kaili dug up on Monday is 4 vats.
"Response:  If there are 50 dogs and each dog produces 20 liters of urine per day, then the total amount of urine produced by all dogs in one day is:

50 dogs x 20 liters/dog/day = 1000 liters/day

Now, if these dogs produce urine for 30 days straight (without any breaks), the total amount of urine produced by them would be:

1000 liters/day x 30 days = 30,000 liters

So, the total number of bags required to collect this much urine would be approximately:

30,000 liters / 40 kg/bag = 750 bags"
Response:  We have to find out how many penguins can fit in a boat that can hold 36 watermelons. Firstly, we need to calculate the volume of one watermelon. A typical watermelon is about 10 inches long, 8 inches wide, and 5 inches tall (approximate dimensions). Therefore, its volume is approximately 127 cubic inches or 2.09 liters. Now, let's convert this volume to weight. Watermelons typically weigh around 4-5 pounds per cubic foot (pcf) when ripe. So, the weight of one watermelon is approximately 4-5 x 2.09 = 8-10 pounds. Next, we need to calculate the volume of the boat. The question states that it can hold 36 watermelons, which means its capacity is 36 x 2.09 = 73.44 cubic feet or 209.12 liters. Finally, we divide the volume of the boat by the volume of each watermelon to get an estimate of how many watermelons can fit in the boat. 73.44 / 2.09 = 35.6 watermelons. However, since penguins are not exactly shaped like watermelons, we may need to adjust this number slightly to account for their irregular shape. Let's assume that we can fit 30-35 penguins comfortably in the boat, given their average size and body shape. Therefore, the estimated number of penguins that can fit in the boat is between 30-35.
Response:  If Suresh has decided to grow tomatoes in his field and he has already prepared the land for it, then he will definitely need to buy seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and other necessary materials for growing tomatoes.  As per the information provided, Suresh has spent Rs. 6000 on these materials. Now, if he wants to produce 3 bags of tomatoes (each bag contains 4 kg), he will require additional materials worth Rs. 3000 (Rs. 6000 x 50%). Therefore, the total cost of producing 3 bags of tomatoes would be Rs. 9000 (Rs. 6000 + Rs. 3000).
Response:  Jon has 20 friends and each friend eats 4 slabs of pizza. So, in total, Jon needs to buy 80 slabs of pizza (20 x 4 = 80). However, he can only afford to buy 40 slabs (πijā 8  Bhāgmā kāṭi bechainch). Therefore, Jon cannot buy all the pizzas he needs.

Response:  Jonil received $20 from his father and spent $10 of it. So he has $10 left with him. Now, let's calculate how much money Jonil had at the beginning of the year. If he had $20 initially and spent $10, then he had $10 left at the end of the year. Therefore, Jonil had $10 + $10 = $20 in total during that year.
Response:  If Jonas has been working for 20 years and his salary increases by 3% every year, then in the last 5 years (i.e., from Year 16 to Year 20), his salary will have increased by 3 x 5 = 15%. So, his current salary is $85,700 (=$64,900 + ($64,900 x 15%)).
Response:  We have to find out how many students are left in the school after 30% of the total number of students go outside for internship and then calculate the percentage of students who remain inside the school.  So, let's first find out the total number of students in the school.  According to the question, there are 1000 students in the school.  Now, we need to find out how many students will go outside for internship.  As per the question, 30% of the total number of students will go outside, so the number of students going outside is: 30 / 100 x 1000 = 300 students.  Now, we need to find out how many students are left inside the school.  The remaining 700 students will be inside the school.  To find out the percentage of students who remain inside the school, we can use the formula: (Number of students remaining inside the school / Total number of students) x 100%.  In this case, the percentage of students who remain inside the school is: (700 / 1000) x 100% = 70%.
Response:  James has 6 candies and Robert takes 3 of them. Now, James has 6 - 3 = 3 candies left. If Jonas takes 2 more candies from James, then James will have 3 - 2 = 1 candy left. So, the final number of candies that James has is 1.
Response:  If Dolly and Pandora are reading one book each, then they have read a total of two books. So, if they both read an additional book together, their combined number of books read will be three. Therefore, the answer is 3.
"Response:  We have 5 cards and each card has 4 faces (Ace to King). So, total number of faces on all 5 cards = 5 x 4 = 20 faces. Now, we need to find out how many times each face appears in the deck. To do this, let's count the number of faces of each rank from Ace to King:

* Ace: 1 face
* Two: 1 face
* Three: 1 face
...
* Ten: 1 face
* Jack: 1 face
* Queen: 1 face
* King: 1 face

So, total number of faces in the deck = 20. And since there are 6 minutes given in the problem, each minute will give us 20/6 = 3.33 faces. Therefore, after 6 minutes, we will have drawn 6 x 3.33 = 19.98 faces."
"Response:  Jessica makes and receives calls every day for 15 minutes each. If she has 30 days in a month, then she will make and receive calls for a total of:

Total number of calls = Number of days x Total time per call
= 30 days x 15 minutes/call
= 450 minutes

Now, let's convert it to hours:

Total number of hours = Total number of calls x Time per call
= 450 minutes / 60 seconds/minute
= 7.5 hours

So, Jessica spends approximately 7.5 hours talking on the phone every month."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Grifin consumed 24 watermelons in total and paid for them with his credit card. Then, he received a bill of Rs.500 from the bank. Now, let's calculate how much amount Grifin had to pay after the discount. As per the given information, Grifin got a discount of Rs.30 on each watermelon, so he paid Rs.30 less for each watermelon. Therefore, the total amount Grifin paid for all 24 watermelons is: (Rs.500 - (24 x Rs.30)) = Rs.500 - Rs.720 = Rs.180. So, Grifin had to pay Rs.180 as the final amount.
Response:  We have two jars of water - one with 4 liters and another with 32 liters. If we pour equal amounts from each jar into a third container, how many liters will be in that container?  Since both jars contain an equal amount of water, if we pour equal amounts from each jar, then the total amount of water poured will also be equal. So, the amount of water in the third container will be half of the total amount of water poured, which is 16 liters (half of 32 liters). Therefore, there will be 16 liters of water in the third container.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Gene Simmons has invested in his art career so far. According to the question, he has been working as an artist for 25 years and has earned $250 per day. Therefore, the total amount of money he has earned is:

$250 x 25 years = $6,250

Now, let's calculate the percentage of profit that Gene Simmons has made from his art career. The question states that he has earned $10,000 from the sale of his paintings, which is 33% of the total amount of money he has earned. Therefore, the percentage of profit that Gene Simmons has made is:

$10,000 / ($6,250 + $10,000) x 100 = 33%

So, Gene Simmons has made a profit of 33% from his art career."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that each person has spent in the party.  For example, if the cost per head for the dinner is $12, then for 10 people, the total cost would be $12 x 10 = $120. Similarly, for the drinks, if the cost per head is $43, then for 10 people, the total cost would be $43 x 10 = $430. Now, let's add up all these costs to find out how much each person has spent in total. So, the total amount spent by each person would be $120 + $430 = $550. Therefore, each person has spent $550 in the party.
"Response:  We have to calculate how many paisa (Pa) of 150 dollars are required to buy 4 bags of rice.  Each bag of rice costs 50 Pa, so we need to multiply the number of bags with their cost per bag:

Number of bags = 4
Cost per bag = 50 Pa
Total cost = Number of bags x Cost per bag
= 4 x 50
= 200 Pa
Now, we know that 1 dollar is equal to 150 paise, so we can convert the total cost in dollars:

$1 = 150 paise
$200 / $150 = 1.33
So, it would take approximately 1.33 dollars to buy 4 bags of rice."
Response:  On Monday (Sombar), Aafiya's mother-in-law cooked 4 cups of rice. On Tuesday ( Mangalwar), Aafiya's mother-in-law cooked 2 cups of rice more than before. So, on Tuesday, she cooked 6 cups of rice in total. And on each of the next 13 days, she cooked 1 cup less than the previous day. Therefore, on the 15th day (Arkodeepawali), Aafiya's mother-in-law cooked 3 cups of rice.  Hence, the answer is 3 cups.
