"Response:  To find out how much money Janet makes from selling her duck eggs at the farmer's market, we need to multiply the number of eggs she has left after cooking and baking by the price per egg. Let's do that step-by-step:

1. First, let's calculate the number of eggs Janet has left after cooking and baking:
3 eggs/day (for breakfast) x 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week
4 muffins/day x 7 days/week = 28 muffins/week
Total eggs used = 21 + 28 = 59 eggs/week

Now, let's check how many eggs Janet has left after cooking and baking:
16 eggs/day x 7 days/week - 59 eggs/week = 0 eggs/week
Janet doesn't have any eggs left after cooking and baking!

So, there is no amount of money Janet can make from selling her duck eggs at the farmer's market since she doesn't have any eggs left to sell.

Answer: $0"

"Response: 30  
Bakgrunden till frågan är att Wendi ger sitt flock av kiker höger intäkterna i tre separata mål. Hon ger dem 15 mugar i morse, ytterligare 25 mugar på eftermiddagen samt ytterligare 30 mugar i kväll. Om antalet kikär i flocken är 20, hur mycket mat behöver hon ge dem i den sista målen av dagen?"
"Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we can use the following formula:
Cost = (Price of one glass x Number of glasses) + (Discount percentage x Price of one glass x Number of glasses)
First, let's calculate the cost of one glass:
Cost = $5
Now, let's calculate the discount percentage:
Discount percentage = 60%
So, the discounted price of each additional glass is:
Discounted price = $5 x 0.6 = $3
Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 glasses:
Total cost = ($5 x 16) + ($3 x 16) = $80 + $48 = $128
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $128 for 16 glasses."
"Response:  Let's start by using the information given in the problem:
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which means that Toulouse has 2x = 2 \* 4 = 8 more sheep than Charleston.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means that Charleston has 4 \* x = 4 \* 20 = 80 more sheep than Seattle.
So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is:
Toulouse: 8 + 8 = 16
Charleston: 80
Seattle: 20
Therefore, the three cities together have a total of 16 + 80 + 20 = 126 sheep."
Response:  To calculate the time taken by Carla to download the file, we need to consider two factors - (1) the speed at which she can download the file normally and (2) the time taken for the forced restart due to installation of updates. Let's assume that Carla can download the file at a rate of 2 GB/minute when she is not interrupted. The distance traveled by the download so far is 200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes. Now, during the 20-minute interruption, the download progresses by only 20 minutes \* 2 GB/min = 40 GB. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the download after the interruption is 100 minutes + 40 minutes = 140 minutes. Since Carla needs to restart the download from the beginning, the total time taken to download the file will be 140 minutes + 20 minutes (time taken for restarting the download) = 160 minutes or 2 hours and 40 minutes.
Response:  Distance = Speed x Time + (Starting point - Endpoint) Where: Distance = total distance traveled Speed = average speed during trip Time = total time taken Starting point = initial position of John's vehicle Endpoint = destination of John's vehicle In this case, we know that John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, which means his distance covered was: Distance = 60 x 3 = 180 miles Then, after turning around, he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, which means he didn't cover any distance during that time. So, his new starting point is the endpoint of his previous journey, which is 180 miles away from his home. Now, he drives for the remaining 4 hours with an average speed of 80 mph, which gives him a distance covered of: Distance = 80 x 2 = 160 miles Finally, adding up all these distances gives us the total distance traveled by John: Total distance = 180 + 0 + 160 = 340 miles Therefore, John is 340 miles away from his home at the end of the 4 hours.
"Response:  To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular hourly earnings and then add her overtime pay.
Regular hourly earnings = $10/hour x number of hours worked (up to 40 hours) = $400
Overtime pay = Regular hourly earnings x overtime factor (1.2) = $480
Total earnings = Regular hourly earnings + Overtime pay = $400 + $480 = $880
Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $880."
"Response:  Total downloads = (First month downloads x 3) - 30% of First month downloads

"Response:  The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of each type of pastry that Toula bought with its respective price per dozen:
Donuts: 3 dozen x $68/dozen = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen x $80/dozen = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen x $55/dozen = $330
Total cost: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694
Therefore, the total cost of the pastries that Toula bought is $694."
"Response:  To calculate how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to consider the total revenue from the lemons, the annual cost of caring for the tree, and the initial cost of purchasing the tree. Let's break down these factors as follows:
Total Revenue = Number of Lemons x Price per Lemon
= 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon
= $10.50 per year
Annual Cost = Watering + Feeding + Initial Tree Purchase
= $3 + $3 + $90
= $126 per year
To determine when Carlos will start earning money on the lemon tree, we can set up an equation using these values:
Years until Earning Money = Total Revenue / Annual Cost
= $10.50 / $126
= 8.4 years
Therefore, it will take Carlos approximately 8.4 years to start earning money on his lemon tree, assuming the tree grows at a steady rate and there are no unexpected expenses or changes in market conditions."
Response:  Let's call the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with x. We know that she sold a third of them at the green house, so she had (x/3) vacuum cleaners left after selling there. Then, she sold 2 more to the red house, so she had (x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left after selling to the red house. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she had (x/3 - 2)/2 = 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling to the orange house. Solving for x, we get x = 15. So, Melanie started with 15 vacuum cleaners.
Response:  Of the total number of students (20), 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, which means that 4 students (20% x 20) enrolled in contemporary dance.  25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, which means that 5 students (25% x (20 - 4)) enrolled in jazz dance. Therefore, the total number of students who enrolled in either contemporary or jazz dance is 9 (4 + 5). Now, we need to find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To do this, divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students: 9 / 20 = 0.45 or 45%. So, approximately 45% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Response:  The profit from purchasing jewelry is given by: P(jewelry) = $5,000 \times (1 + 0.025) = $5,375 The profit from purchasing electronic gadgets is given by: P(electronic gadgets) = $8,000 \times (1 + 0.012) = $8,464 To determine which option provides the higher profit, we compare these values: $8,464 > $5,375, so the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets. Therefore, the profit from this decision would be $8,464 - $5,000 = $3,464.
"Response:  Let's call the distance traveled by Train A on Day 1 as x and that of Train B as y. We know that both trains left San Rafael together, so their total distance traveled on Day 1 is equal to the sum of their individual distances:
x + y = 80 (since both trains traveled westward)
On Day 2, we know that Train A traveled northward and covered a distance of 150 miles, while Train B continued traveling westward and covered a distance of 80 miles. So, the total distance traveled by Train A on Day 2 is:
x + 150 = 130 (since it traveled northwestward)
Similarly, the total distance traveled by Train B on Day 2 is:
y + 80 = 230 (since it continued traveling westward)
Now, let's find the average speed of each train over the two days:
Average Speed of Train A = Total Distance / Time Taken = (x + 150) / 2 = 75 miles/day
Average Speed of Train B = Total Distance / Time Taken = (y + 80) / 2 = 90 miles/day
Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Distance Covered by Train A on Day 1 = x = 40 miles
Distance Covered by Train B on Day 1 = y = 40 miles
Distance Covered by Train A on Day 2 = 150 miles
Distance Covered by Train B on Day 2 = 230 miles"
"Response:  Annual salary = (teaching hours x teaching rate) + (coaching hours x coaching rate)

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $12,300."
Response:  To find out how many dozen eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by the number of weeks. Since she eats 3 eggs per day and there are 7 days in a week, she eats 21 eggs per week (3 x 7 = 21). Therefore, she will eat 84 dozen eggs (21 x 4 = 84) in 4 weeks.
Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles and the time taken so far is 3 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles + 1 hour for the next 2 miles). So, we can plug in these values into the formula to get: Average Speed = 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles/hour. Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at an average speed of 4 miles per hour to cover the remaining distance.
Response:  The total amount of liquid is 35 liters (10 + 15 = 25). Since you spilled one liter, there are now 24 liters left (25 - 1 = 24).

Response:  Marie paid a total of $50 for all the items she bought. Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie must have ordered $\boxed{\text{50 - }}$ $8.50 = \boxed{\text{41.50}}$ boxes of pizza.
Response:  Mishka spent a total of $... (insert number) dollars on all the clothing items.
"Response:  Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, which means she consumes 1/15 of the total number of servings in each carton of ice cream. Since there are 15 servings per carton and Cynthia eats one serving every night, she consumes 1/15 of the total number of servings per day.
Since there are 60 days in a month, Cynthia consumes 60/15 = 4 servings of ice cream per month.
Now, we need to calculate how much Cynthia spends on ice cream per month. The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the cost of 4 servings of ice cream per month is:
$4.00 x 4 = $16.00 per month
Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent a total of $16.00 x 2 = $32.00 on ice cream."
Response:  The distance between Henry's first and second stops is equal to the total distance traveled by Henry minus the distance traveled between each stop. Since we know that Henry traveled 60 miles in total, we can set up an equation as follows: Distance = Total distance - (Distance between first and second stops + Distance between second and third stops) Now, we are given that Henry made two stops: the first stop occurred after 20 miles and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Therefore, we can plug these values into our equation: Distance = 60 miles - (20 miles + 15 miles) = 60 miles - 35 miles = 25 miles So, the distance between Henry's first and second stops is 25 miles.
"Response:  Let's say the price of the boots is x dollars. Since Gloria has to choose between the boots and two pairs of heels, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + (2 × $33) = $50

Now let's solve for x:

x = $47

So the price of the boots is $47 dollars."
Response:  To solve this problem, we can use the information given in the question to set up a proportion. Let's say that Darrell's current age is x. Then, according to the problem statement, Allen's current age is 7x / 11. We know that the sum of their ages is 162, so we can write the equation: x + (7x/11) = 162. Simplifying this equation, we get: 8x = 934. Dividing both sides by 8, we find that x = 115. Therefore, Allen's current age is 7(115) = 805. Ten years from now, Allen's age will be 805 + 10 = 815.
"Response:  The average number of jelly beans that Gunter's friends estimate are in the jar can be calculated as follows:

1. First friend estimates 80 jelly beans, so their contribution to the average is 80/3 = 26.67.
2. Second friend estimates 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate, which is 20 + (half of 26) = 46.
3. Third friend estimates 25% more than the first friend's estimate, which is 25% of 26 = 6.5.

Therefore, the total average estimate from all three friends is: 26.67 + 46 + 6.5 = 79.17."
"Response: 40 hours/week

Bakgrunden till denna fråga är att man vill veta hur mycket tid som John har att ta hand om hundarna på veckan. Med informationen att varje hund tar.5 timmar per dag att vårda och ta hand om sitt avföring, kan man beräkna totalt antal timmar han har att använda sig av för att sköta hundarnas vård under en vecka."
Response:  Gretchen har 40 guldmynt (110 - 70 = 40).
Response:  Let's start by using the information that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So if Raymond has x jewels, Aaron has x + 5 jewels. Now we are told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has x - 2 jewels. Finally, we know that Siobhan has less jewels than Raymond, so Siobhan's jewel count is less than or equal to x. Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is between x and x + 5, inclusive. Since x + 5 is greater than 40 (the maximum value of Raymond's jewels), we can narrow down the possible values for Siobhan's jewel count to {x, x + 1, x + 2,..., 40}. The only integer value that satisfies this inequality is x = 36, so Siobhan has 36 jewels.
Response:  Total points scored by Mike = (4 x 20) + (25% of 20) = 80 + 5 = 85 points

Response:  John har 13 lego sets att börja med, sedan säljer han dem alla för $15 stycken, vilket ger honom $195 ($13 x $15). Därefter köper han 8 video spel för $20 stycken,vilket ger honom $160 ($20 x 8). Det finns $35 kvar ($195 - $160 = $35). John har därmed 13 - 8 = 5 lego setter kvar.
"Response:  John löper med en genomsnittlig hastighet på 12 minuter per kilometer (m/km).

Bakgrunden till denna fråga är att man vill veta hur snabbt personen löper baserat på information om antalet mil och tid som han löper i veckan, samt hur mycket han löper på varje dag. Med hjälp av dessa uppgifter kan man beräkna genomsnittlig hastigheten för persons lopp genom att dividera totalt antal meter han löper under veckan med tidens totalantal timmar. I detta fall är antalet timmar han löper under veckan 3 timmar och tidens totalantal meter är 60 x 3 = 180 meters totala löptim. Därför blir genomsnittlig hastigheten 180 m / 3 timmar = 60 m/tim."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question about Dana's speeds. Let's start by writing down what we know:

* Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. This means that if she runs at a rate of x miles per hour, she can walk at a rate of 4x miles per hour.
* Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means that if she runs at a rate of x miles per hour, she can skip at a rate of (x/2) miles per hour.

Now let's think about how much time Dana spends running versus walking. According to the problem statement, she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. So for every hour she spends running, she spends two hours walking.

Let's call the total number of hours Dana spends skipping ""h"". Since she can skip at a rate of (x/2) miles per hour, and she spends h hours skipping, the total distance she covers while skipping is:

distance = h \* (x/2) miles

Next, let's find out how much time Dana spends running. Since she spends one-third of her time running, and there are 6 hours in total, the amount of time she spends running is:

time running = 1/3 \* 6 hours = 2 hours

So far, so good! Now let's use our knowledge of Dana's running and walking speeds to calculate the total distance she covers during the six hours. We know that when she runs, she goes four times faster than when she walks, so if she runs at a rate of x miles per hour, she walks at a rate of 4x miles per hour. Therefore, the total distance she covers while running is:

total distance running = 4x miles

And since she spends two hours running, the total distance she covers during those two hours is:

total distance running = 4x miles \* 2 hours = 8x miles

Finally, we add up the distance she covers while skipping and the distance she covers while running to"
"Response:  Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, which means that if Ben's iPhone is x years old, then Brandon's iPhone is 4x years old. Additionally, we know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone, so if Suzy's iPhone is y years old, then Ben's iPhone is 2y years old. Finally, we are told that Suzy's iPhone is one year old, so if we substitute this value into the equation for Brandon's iPhone, we get:
Brandon's iPhone = 4(2y) = 8y
Solving for y (the age of Brandon's iPhone), we get:
y = 1/3
So Brandon's iPhone is three-thirds years old."
"Response:  To solve this problem we need to find out how much further Polly can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone compared to when she is not holding it. Let's assume that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet (the maximum distance allowed by the problem). Now, let's calculate how much further she can throw it while holding the gemstone:

Distance = Speed x Time
Speed = Distance / Time
Time = Distance / Speed

We know that Polly can throw the javelin 3 times farther while holding the gemstone, so we will use this value to calculate the new speed. Let's assume that the new speed is x feet per second. Then we can calculate the time it takes for the javelin to travel this distance using the formula above:

Time = Distance / Speed = 400 ft / x ft/s = x seconds

Now we know that the javelin travels for x seconds before reaching the dragon, given that Polly is holding the gemstone. We also know that the dragon's flame reaches a distance of 1000 feet from its location on Mount Farbo. So, if Polly stands x feet away from the dragon (where x is the time it took for the javelin to travel), the javelin will be inside the dragon's flame zone. Therefore, the answer is:

Outside of the reach of the dragon's flames = x - 1000 feet

So, Polly can stand up to x feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone."
Response:  The number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 14 - 5 = 9.
Response:  To calculate the number of grams of chips that can be eaten based on the given information, we need to use the following formula: Number of grams = Total calories / Daily calorie target x Number of servings The total calories in a 300g bag of chips are 250 x 5 = 1250 calories. If the daily calorie target is 2000 calories, then the number of grams of chips that can be eaten is: Number of grams = 1250 / 2000 x 5 = 62.5 grams Therefore, an individual can eat approximately 62.5 grams of chips based on this calculation.
"Response:  To find out how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax, we need to divide the weight of the beeswax by the weight of a single candle. Since each candle weighs approximately 1/4 pound (or 8 ounces), we can calculate the number of candles as follows:
Number of candles = Weight of beeswax / Weight of a single candle
= 1 lb / 8 oz
= 12.5 candles
Since Charlie can make 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax, he can make 12.5 x 10 = 125 candles from one pound of beeswax.
To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to subtract the cost of supplies (the wicks) from the total revenue generated by selling all 20 candles. The cost of supplies is $10.00, so the total revenue is:
Total revenue = Number of candles x Price of a single candle
= 20 x $2.00
= $40.00
Subtracting the cost of supplies gives us Charlie's net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Cost of supplies
= $40.00 - $10.00
= $30.00
Therefore, if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles using one pound of beeswax, his net profit would be $30.00."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles on each day and then add up those hours to get the total number of hours she spent writing articles over the three-day period.
Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Tuesday: 2/5 x 4 hours per article = 8 hours (since 2/5 means 2 divided by 5, which is equal to 0.4)
Wednesday: 2 x 4 hours per article = 8 hours
Total hours spent writing articles = 20 + 8 + 8 = 36 hours
Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 36 hours writing articles over the three days."
Response:  The number of Post-it notes in the package is equal to the total number of Post-it notes - the number of Post-it notes used at the coffee shop.  80 + (220 x 1) = 400 - 23 = 377 Post-it notes in the package.
"Response:  Total amount spent on ties = Number of red ties x Price of red tie + Number of blue ties x Price of blue tie
= (Twice as many red ties as blue ties) x ($50% more for red ties) + (Number of blue ties x $40)
= 2(x)($50%) + x
Where x is the number of blue ties bought by John.
Now, we are given that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. So, we can substitute this value in the equation above:
Total amount spent on ties = 2(x)($50%) + x = 2(100)($50%) + 100 = $400 + $50 = $450
Therefore, John spent a total of $450 on ties."
Response:  To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the length of the wire (4 feet) by the length of each piece of wire (6 inches).  4 feet / 6 inches = 6 pieces So, Tracy obtained 6 pieces of wire.
Response:  The information given in the question can be summarized as follows: • Number of floors: 15 • Number of units per floor: 8 • Occupancy rate: 3/4 = 0.75 (meaning 75% of the building is occupied) Now, we need to find out how many units are unoccupied in the building. To do this, we will multiply the occupancy rate by the total number of floors: Unoccupied units = Occupancy rate x Total floors = 0.75 x 15 = 11 Therefore, there are 11 unoccupied units in the building.
"Response:  To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold in a week and then multiply it by the price per dozen. Let's assume that Lloyd works 7 days a week.
1. Calculate the total number of eggs sold in a week:
Number of eggs sold/day = 252
Number of days in a week = 7
Total number of eggs sold/week = Number of eggs sold/day x Number of days in a week = 252 x 7 = 1,764 eggs/week
2. Multiply the total number of eggs sold in a week by the price per dozen:
Price per dozen = $2
Total revenue from eggs/week = Total number of eggs sold/week x Price per dozen = 1,764 eggs/week x $2/dozen = $3,528/week
Therefore, Lloyd makes $3,528 on eggs per week."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
We know that Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, so he will cover a distance of 10 miles in 1 hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Therefore, if he starts sailing at 1 PM and travels for 3 hours until 4 PM, he will have traveled a total distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles
Now, when he turns around and heads back, his speed is 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we can use the same formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
So, if he travels for x hours, he will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 6 miles/hour x x hours = 6x miles
Since he started sailing at 1 PM and wants to be back by 7 PM, we know that x = 5 hours. Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to get back:
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours
Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to get back to his starting point."
"Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information that his comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. Let's start by finding out how much weight the comic books are taking up in his book bag. Since there are 30 comic books, the total weight of the comics is:

30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we know that the total weight of the items in his book bag is 15 pounds, so we can subtract the weight of the comics to find out how much weight the toys are taking up:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 toys from his book bag to bring the weight down to 15 pounds."
Response:  The mechanic earned $240 in revenue from repairing car tires on Friday ($12 \times 4 = 48). Since no truck tires were repaired on this day, the total revenue earned by the mechanic was $48 + $240 = $308. Therefore, the mechanic earned $308 - $240 = $68 more in revenue on Friday than on Thursday.
Response:  The Doubirtire family now has a total of 30 kittens (7 + 12).
"Response:  To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the number of lollipops left after Jean ate two (2) by the number of lollipops that will be packaged in each bag (2). So, we divide 30 (the total number of lollipops) by 2 (the number of lollipops per bag):

30 / 2 = 15

So, Jean can fill 15 bags with the remaining lollipops."
Response:  To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide his total amount of money by the cost of one trip to the movies. Since the cost of a movie ticket is $7 and the cost of popcorn is also $7, we can calculate the total cost per trip as follows: Total Cost = Movie Ticket + Popcorn = $7 + $7 = $14 Therefore, if Peter has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies $\frac{42}{14} = 3$ times.
"Response:  To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the total weight of the load on the truck after loading the boxes. We know that the driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds, so if we add this weight to the weight of the boxes, we get the total weight of the load on the truck. Let's assume that we want to load as many boxes as possible onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit. So, we will choose the highest number of boxes that gives us a total weight less than or equal to 5000 pounds.
The formula for finding the maximum number of boxes is:
Maximum number of boxes = Total weight of load / Weight of each box
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
Maximum number of boxes = (5000 - 3755) / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 286
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 286."

"Response:  The problem can be solved by using a formula that calculates the present value of future annuity payments based on the number of payment periods and the payment amount. In this case, we need to calculate the present value of Marcy's pension at different points in time. Let's assume that Marcy retires after 30 years of service, so the first payment period starts from year 31 to eternity.

Let PV = present value of the pension, which is equal to the total value of all future payments discounted to their present value.

Year 1: PV = $50,000 (annual pension) x (1 + 5%)^1 = $52,500
Year 2: PV = $50,000 x (1 + 5%)^2 = $54,600
Year 3: PV = $50,000 x (1 + 5%)^3 = $57,380
...
Year 30: PV = $50,000 x (1 + 5%)^{30} = $93,750

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension starting from year 31 will be:
Annual Pension = PV / Number of Payment Periods = $93,750 / 30 = $3,125/year

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service will be $3,125/year."
"Response:  To solve this problem we need to find out how much Aleena was charged in each half of the year and then add those amounts together. Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Initial amount: $140 (per month) x 6 months = $840
* Discount percentage: 10%
* Time period: Half-year (3 months)

Now, let's calculate the amount Aleena was charged in each half of the year:

Half 1 (January - March): $840 / 2 = $420
Half 2 (April - December): ($840 x 10%) = $84
Total amount paid by Aleena by the end of the year: $420 + $84 = $504
Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $504."
"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total amount of gas in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling up. We can use the information given in the problem to calculate these values:
Total amount of gas in tank = 12 gallons (from the owner's manual)
Number of miles driven since last filling up = 100 miles (as stated in the problem)
So, if Sophia drives another mile after reaching empty, she will need an additional 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank again. Therefore, the distance she can drive on a single tank of gas is:
Distance = Total amount of gas in tank / Number of miles driven since last filling up
= 12 gallons / 100 miles + 1 mile
= 12 / 101 miles
= approximately 117 miles
Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 117 miles on a single tank of gas."

Solving for x, we get:
x = 140
So there were 140 rubies in the chest."
Response:  Let x be the number of teachers. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are x/2 boys and (60-x)/2 girls. According to the problem, there are 5 students per teacher, so the total number of students is 5(x/2 + (60-x)/2) = 130. Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, there are 7 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.
Response:  Bailey started with $60 (100 - 4 x 5).
"Response:  To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the cost per student. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day (Monday through Friday) = 25 classes/week (since there are 7 days in a week).
* Judy teaches 8 dance classes on Saturday = 8 additional classes/week.
* Each class has 15 students = 15 x 30 = 450 students/week (combining Monday-Friday and Saturday classes).
* Judy charges $15.00 per student = Total revenue for the week = $6,750 ($450 x 15).

Therefore, Judy makes $6,750 in one week."

"Response:  To find out how much Sheila will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of each phone and then multiply it by the number of units she has purchased. Let's break down the calculation as follows:
Total Cost = Price x Interest Rate x Number of Installments
= $150 x 2% x 3
= $75 per phone
Since Sheila bought 5 phones, her total monthly payment will be:
Monthly Payment = Total Cost / Number of Installments
= $75 / 3
= $25 per month
Therefore, Sheila will pay $25 per month for 3 months to own the 5 cell phones."
"Response:  To find out how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the total amount of money he will receive from each type of flower and then add it up. Let's do this step by step:
Marigolds:
Artie sold 12 pots of marigolds, which means he received $12 x $2.74 = $32.88 in revenue.
Petunias:
Artie sold 9 pots of petunias, which means he received $9 x $1.87 = $16.53 in revenue.
Begonias:
Artie sold 17 pots of begonias, which means he received $17 x $2.12 = $35.04 in revenue.
Total revenue:
$32.88 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $84.45
So Artie will make $84.45 in total."
"Response:  To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we need to divide the total square footage of all levels by the number of levels. Let's use the information given in the problem to calculate this:
Total square footage = Top level (16) x Number of levels (4) = 64
Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels = 64 / 4 = 16 sq ft

"Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs and divide it by the number of cups per bag. Let's do this step by step:
Total number of cups of dog food needed = 1 cup/day x 180 days + 2 cups/day x remaining days (after 180 days) Total number of cups of dog food needed = 180 + (365 - 180) = 445 cups
Now, let's divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per bag: Number of bags of dog food needed = total cups / number of cups per bag Number of bags of dog food needed = 445 / 110 = 4 bags
Therefore, Cecilia will use 4 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so if David does x pounds of laundry, Sarah does 4x pounds.
2. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so if Sarah does x pounds of laundry, Raymond does (x/2) pounds.
3. The total amount of laundry done by Sarah is 400 pounds.

Now, let's plug these values into a equation to find out how much laundry Raymond and David do:

Raymond does (x/2) pounds of laundry, since he does half as much as Sarah. So, if Sarah does 4x pounds of laundry, Raymond does 2x pounds.
David does x pounds of laundry, since Sarah does 4 times as much as him.

The difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is:
2x - x = 1x = 100 pounds

Therefore, Raymond does 100 pounds of laundry less than David."
"Response:  To find out how much money Vincent saves, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers he wants to buy and then compare it with the cost of the cheaper option. Let's do that!
Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers, so he will pay:
$2.50 x 3 = $7.50 for 3 flowers if he buys them individually packaged.
$1 x 6 = $6.00 for 6 flowers if he buys them in a package of 2.
So, the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the higher price is:
$7.50 + $6.00 = $13.50.
And the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the lower price is:
$6.00 + $6.00 = $12.00.
Therefore, Vincent saves $1.50 ($13.50 - $12.00) by buying the flowers in packages of 2 instead of 3."

Response:  There are two girls, and each girl gets 1/6 of the total amount of water, which is 24 liters. So, each girl gets 24 / 2 = 12 liters of water. Now, there is 24 - 12 = 12 liters of water left. The boy then gets 6 liters of water, so there are now 12 + 6 = 18 liters of water left.
Response:  Charlie har 28 - 9 = 19 stickers kvar.
"Response:  To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, if we let x be the weight of Grace, we can write the equation:
Alex's weight = 2 pounds less than 4x pounds
We also know that the total weight of both Grace and Alex is equal to the sum of their individual weights, so we can write another equation:
Grace's weight + Alex's weight = Total weight
Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:
4x + 2 = Total weight
Solving for x (the weight of Grace), we get:
4x = Total weight - 2
x = Total weight / 4
Now, we know that Grace weighs 125 pounds, so we can substitute this value into the previous equation:
125 = Total weight / 4
Total weight = 300 pounds
Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 300 pounds."

Response:  After three more years of service, Sylvies salary will be increased by 10% of her current salary which is $600 x 1.1 = $660. So Sylvies new annual salary will be $660 + $600 = $1260.
"Response:  Let x be the number of copies Harald sold. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can write:  
x = 10a where a is the number of copies Marilyn sold. We are also given that Marilyn sold 88,000 copies in total, so we can write:  
x + a = 88,000 Solving for a, we get:  
a = 76,200 - x Substituting this expression for a into the equation above, we get:  
x + (76,200 - x) = 88,000 Simplifying and solving for x, we find that Harald sold 43,500 copies."

"Response:  To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed is:

Adults = 20 x 10 lb = 200 lb
Children = 5 x (half of 10 lb) = 25 lb
Total = 200 + 25 = 225 lb

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
Response:  Let's start by using the information that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets. We also know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Cindy has x-2 pets. Finally, we are told that Cindy has four pets, so x - 2 = 4. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. Therefore, Jan has 3(8) = 24 pets, and the three friends together have 8 + 24 = 32 pets.
Response:  Jackson är 7 år gammal.
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Gerald's speed has increased due to his new diet. We are given that before changing his diet, Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds slower than Lee. So if Lee ran it in 38 seconds, Gerald ran it in 40 seconds (since he was 2 seconds slower). Now, since Gerald's diet improvement increased his speed by 10%, his new time for running the 400-meter hurdles will be:
Gerald's new time = 40 seconds x (1 + 10%) = 44 seconds
Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 44 seconds."
"Response:  Let's start by using the information that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, if we let D be the number of dogs and C be the number of cats, we can write:

Svaret blir alltså 51 flickor som inte är i Girl Scouts."
Response:  Harry slept 9 hours, so he slept x hours more than James. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, James slept x/3 hours. Therefore, the difference between the number of hours Harry slept and the number of hours James slept is x - (x/3) = 2x/3. So Harry slept 2x/3 hours more than James.
Response:  To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the volume of the tomato sauce by the volume of a single tomato. Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, and Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, we can calculate as follows: Number of tomatoes = Volume of tomato sauce / Volume of a single tomato Volume of tomato sauce = 32 ounces = 0.5 gallons (since there are 8 ounces in a cup) Volume of a single tomato = 16 ounces / 3 tomatoes per can = 5.33 ounces So, Freda used approximately 5.33 x 3 = 16 tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce.
"Response:  The number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes can be calculated as follows:

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16
Therefore, 16 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
Response:  Mary will remain with 36 potted plants (18 + 2 x 40).
Response:  Let X be the total number of doorbell rings. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, X = 20. The second friend pressed the doorbell X + 5 (since they pressed it 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend), so X = 20 + 5 = 25. The third friend pressed the doorbell X + 10 (since they pressed it 10 times more than the fourth friend), so X = 25 + 10 = 35. Finally, the fourth friend pressed the doorbell X + 60, so X = 35 + 60 = 95. Therefore, there were 95 doorbell rings in total.
Response:  To find out how many pages Solo needs to read each day, we can divide the total number of pages he needs to read by the number of days he has left to finish his reading. In this case, Solo needs to read a total of 39 pages (4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39). Since he already read 15 pages on Monday, he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read. Therefore, he needs to read an average of 24/5 = 4.8 pages per day to finish all his reading within the given time frame.
Response:  John dricker totalt 7 glassar vatten i veckan (1x Breakfast + 3x Lunch + 2x Dinner + 1x Before Bed = 7).
Response:  The fog bank covers the city at a rate of 3 miles per 10 minutes. To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to divide the distance of the city by the coverage rate per time period. In this case, the distance of the city is 42 miles, and the coverage rate per time period is 3 miles / 10 minutes = 0.3 miles/minute. Therefore, it will take the fog bank 42 miles / 0.3 miles/minute = 140 minutes (or 2 hours and 20 minutes) to cover the entire city.

Response:  To solve this problem we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that each person has eaten. Let's start by finding out how many roll-ups Beatrice had. Since her roll-up was 24 rolls long, she had 24 x 1 = 24 fruit roll-ups. Now let's find out how many roll-ups Marcell had. His roll-up was 14 rolls long, so he had 14 x 1 = 14 fruit roll-ups. Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups that both Beatrice and Marcell have eaten is:  24 + 14 = 38. So on average, they have eaten 38 / 2 = 19 fruit roll-ups each.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many meters Julia rowed before reaching shore. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet (or 6 meters), so in 64 seconds, she will have rowed 64/16 = 4 meters. Therefore, Julia's boat took on 2 liters of water for every 4 meters she rowed back towards shore. Since the distance from the shore is 64 seconds, and Julia rowed 4 meters, the total amount of water the boat took on is 2 liters x 4 meters / 64 seconds = 35.7 milliliters.

"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total revenue and then subtract the total cost. Let's start by calculating the revenue from each type of board:
Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x 10 = $100
Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 16 x 10 = $160
Total revenue = $100 + $160 = $260
Now let's calculate the cost of producing these boards:
Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x $10 = $100
Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 16 x $10 = $160
Total cost = $100 + $160 = $260
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $260 - $260 = $0
Therefore, Sasha doesn't make any profit from selling all of her leftover lumber."
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio between sugar and water. According to the question, the ratio is 7:13, which means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 teaspoons of water. Therefore, if Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar, she would have used 120/7 = 17 teaspoons of sugar. Since each teaspoon of sugar contains approximately 4 grams of sugar, Katy would have used a total of 17 x 4 = 68 grams of sugar.
Response:  John paid a total of $60 x 3 = $180.
Response:  To solve this problem we need to use the information given in the question. On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles inside each container, so the total number of vehicles was 10 (2 x 5). On the second day, additional containers arrived, bringing the total number of vehicles at the port to 30. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can conclude that there were 6 containers (30 / 5 = 6) imported on the second day. Therefore, the answer is 6 containers.
Response:  Let A be Adrien's total salary four years ago, B be Lylah's total salary four years ago, C be Adrien's current total salary, and D be Lylah's current total salary. We know that:  1) Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago: A = 1.3B (4 years ago) 2) Adrien's salary has increased by 40% since then: C = 1.4A (now) 3) Lylah's salary also increased by a similar percentage: D = 1.4B (now) Substituting these equations into each other gives us: A + B = C + D (total salary 4 years ago) × 1.3 = (total salary now) × 1.4 (Adrien's increase) × 1.4 (Lylah's increase) Solving for A + B we get: A + B = 56000 + 40000 = 96000 + 57000 = 153000 Now we can find out how much Adrien and Lylah are making currently by substituting their new values in: C = 1.4A = 1.4(153000) = 214800 D = 1.4B = 1.4(40000) = 56000 Therefore, Adrien is currently making $214800 and Lylah is making $56000.

"Response:  The total number of fruits that Morisette and Kael have is:  
Apples + Oranges = 5 + 8 = 13
Morisette has 5 apples and 8 oranges, so he has a total of 13 fruits. Kael has twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he has 2 x 5 = 10 apples, and half the number of oranges as Morisette, which means he has 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. Therefore, Kael has a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. In total, Morisette and Kael have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits."
"Response:  Total hours of sleep = (8 + 6) + (4 + 3) + (5 + 1) = 20 + 9 + 6 = 35 hours  
Explanation: On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept for 6 hours less than the previous day, so she slept for 2 hours less per day. Therefore, she slept a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours on these two days. On Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than the previous day, so she slept for 5 + 1 = 6 hours on these two days. Finally, on Saturday and Sunday, she slept for 8 hours each day, which is the same as on Monday. Therefore, her total hours of sleep throughout the week are: 35 hours."

"Response:  To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the doctor's consultations and then subtract the cost of providing those services. Let's start by calculating the total revenue:
Revenue = Number of patients per day x Time spent with each patient x Charge per minute
= 500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient x $200/hour
= $80,000/day
Now let's calculate the cost of providing these services:
Cost = Number of patients per day x Time spent with each patient x Cost per minute
= 500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient x $150/hour
= $36,000/day
So, the hospital makes a profit of:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $80,000/day - $36,000/day
= $44,000/day
Or approximately $17 million per year."
"Response: 40 elver är kvar.

Bakgrunden till denna fråga är att det oftare kan vara små antal personer som slutar arbeta i en given tid, men att det kan verka som om fler har slutat arbeta sedan alla har slutat. Detta leder till att man tror att flera har slutat när det egentligen bara är få som har gjort det."

"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how much time it takes Mark to answer each question on both tests. Let's assume that the time taken by Mark to answer each question is directly proportional to the number of questions. Therefore, if it takes him 5 minutes to answer the first 5 questions, it will take him half the time (or 2.5 minutes) to answer the next 5 questions. Similarly, if it takes him 10 minutes to answer the first 10 questions, it will take him half the time again (or 5 minutes) to answer the next 10 questions.
Now, let's calculate the total time taken by Mark to answer all the questions in both tests:
Test 1: Total time = Number of questions x Time per question = 75 x 5 = 375 minutes
Test 2: Total time = Number of questions x Time per question = 100 x 2.5 = 250 minutes
Since Mark has 8 hours to complete Test 1 and 6 hours to complete Test 2, we can set up the following equation:
Number of questions answered = Total time / Time available
For Test 1: Number of questions answered = 375 / 8 = 46.1 questions
For Test 2: Number of questions answered = 250 / 6 = 41.7 questions
Therefore, Mark left 9.4 questions incomplete in Test 1 and 28.3 questions incomplete in Test 2."
Response:  Let's assume that the total number of gumballs in the machine is x. Since there are 4 times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, the number of pink gumballs is 4x. We know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can set up the equation: 4x = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 50. Therefore, there are 50 pink gumballs in the machine if there are 12 blue gumballs.

"Response:  To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on video games and then multiply it by his hourly wage from his part-time job. Let's assume that Jordan works 5 days a week (Monday through Friday) and spends 2 hours playing video games each day. Therefore, he spends a total of 10 hours per week playing video games. If he were to spend this time working instead, he would earn:

$10/hour x 10 hours/week = $100/week

So, Jordan would earn $100 per week if he spent his video game time working instead."

New total cost with tax: $16 + $1.60 = $17.60
Therefore, everything cost $17.60 in total."
Response:  To find out how much profit Lucas will make each week, we first need to calculate his total income for the week. His total income per week is calculated by multiplying the number of clients he has (6) with the amount each client pays him ($92). So, his total income for the week is:  6 x $92 = $548. Next, we subtract his total expenses from his total income to find his profit. His total expenses consist of the cost of bleach and cloths for all six clients, which is:  2 x $20 = $40 + $5 x $10 = $50 = $90. Therefore, his profit for the week is: $548 - $90 = $458. So, Lucas will make $458 in profit each week.
Response:  To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples he will have after one year. We know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares of land. Therefore, the total number of pineapples John will have after one year is:  100 pineapples/hectare x 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples After one year, John will have 1000 pineapples.
"Response:  Johnny picks up 750 blocks (legos).

Explanation:
The first Lego set has 500 pieces, so Johnny picked up 500 blocks. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, which means it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. Since the third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the second set, it has 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces. In total, Johnny picked up 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 blocks or Legos."
Response:  The number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours can be calculated by subtracting the total number of bees that left the hive during the first 6 hours (30) from the total number of bees that left the hive during the entire day (twice 30 = 60). Therefore, the answer is 60 bees.

Response:  James har 4 x 12 = 48 Facebook-vänner.
Response:  To solve this problem we need to find out when Steve will arrive at his house based on the distance between Steve's house and the school, as well as the speed that each of them are traveling. We know that Steve lives 3 miles from the school, which means it takes him 3 x 5,280 = 15,840 feet to walk there. Since Steve is biking, he can cover this distance in half the time it would take him to walk, or 7,920 seconds (or approximately 13 minutes). Therefore, if Steve starts the race at the same time as Tim, he will arrive at his house after Tim has been walking for 13 minutes.

Response:  To find out how much change Carl receives, we need to calculate the total amount that Carl pays for the cookies. Since each pack of cookies costs $0.10 x 6 = $0.60 per pack, and Carl buys ten packs, the total amount that Carl pays is $0.60 x 10 = $6.00. If Carl pays with a $10 bill, then he will receive $10 - $6.00 = $4.00 in change.
"Response: 5

Explanation:
Let's break down what happened to the French fries:

1. A hungry seagull stole the entire pack out of Dave's hands, so there were no fries left after this event.
2. The seagull ate half of the number of fries that Dave ate (since Dave ate 14). So, the seagull ate 7 fries (half of 14).
3. Three pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 fries. So, the pigeons ate a total of 9 fries (3 x 3 = 9).
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries (which is equal to 6/3 or 2 fries).
5. Ants carried off one final french fry.

Now, let's add up how many fries were eaten by all these animals:

7 + 9 + 2 + 1 = 20

So, there were originally 20 French fries in the pack when Dave bought it. Therefore, the answer is 20."

"Response:  To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo over that period. Let's do this step-by-step:

* For the first month, each species of ape needs a certain number of bananas:
	+ Gorillas: 400 bananas
	+ Monkeys: 200 bananas
	+ Baboons: 100 bananas
* Total number of bananas needed for the first month = 400 + 200 + 100 = 700 bananas
* Since there are two months in total, we multiply the number of bananas needed for the first month by 2 to get the total number of bananas needed for both months: 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
Response:  The distance Kelly ran was 34 x (40 - 0) = 1360 yards. Since the football field is 100 yards long, the total distance Blake ran was 15 x 100 = 1500 yards. Therefore, the winner ran 1360 - 1500 = -140 yards more than the loser.

"Response:  The water depth on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:
On Monday, the water depth was 17 feet = 5.2 meters (conversion factor: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters)
On Tuesday, the water depth increased by 7 feet = 2.13 meters (conversion factor: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters)
So, the water depth on Tuesday was 5.2 + 2.13 = 7.33 meters
On Wednesday, the water depth decreased to two-thirds of the previous day's value, which is:
7.33 / 2 = 3.69 meters
Therefore, the water depth on Wednesday was 3.69 meters."

Total value of doll = $X

So, the total value of all the toys is:
$20 + $15 + $X = $45

Therefore, the answer is $45."
"Response:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of doing her own taxes and compare it to the cost of hiring an accountant.
If Jackie does her own taxes, she will save $35/hour in missed income from freelance work that she would have done instead of working on her taxes. So, the total cost of doing her own taxes is:
$35 x 3 = $105

On the other hand, if Jackie hires an accountant, the cost is $90. Therefore, the difference between these two amounts is:
$90 - $105 = -$15

So, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will lose $15 compared to doing her own taxes."
Response:  To calculate how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of all the accessories from her budget. Her budget is €1500, and the total cost of all the accessories is €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1483. So, Elvira will have €67 left over for her clothing (€1500 - €1483).
Response:  Babysitting is repeated 4 times since each time the neighbor gives her 9 eggs and needed 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan. So, Sandra will need to babysit 4 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.
"Response:  Let's assume that Seth's age is ""S"" and Brooke's age is ""B"". We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:

S = 2B

We also know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write:

S + B = 28

Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:

2B + B = 28

Combining like terms, we get:

3B = 28

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

B = 9

So Brooke is 9 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is 18 years old (2 x 9 = 18)."

"Response:  The total age of the four birds can be calculated by using the information given in the problem:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 3 + x = 40 years old (where x is Granny Red's age).
2. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2x = 80 years old (since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, who is 8 years old).
3. Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 3 + 2x = 150 years old.

So, the answer to the question is 150 years old."
"Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month and then multiply it by 12. Let's start by calculating the total amount Jessica pays each month:
Minimum payment for student loans = $300/month x 50% = $150/month
Minimum payment for credit card = $200/month x 50% = $100/month
Minimum payment for mortgage = $500/month x 50% = $250/month
Total monthly payment = $150 + $100 + $250 = $400/month
Now let's multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to get the annual payment:
Annual payment = $400/month x 12 = $4,800/year
Therefore, Jessica pays $4,800 per year on her debts if she chooses to pay 50% more than the minimum payment each month."
"Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to peel and cut them all. Let's break this down step by step:
Peeling: Since it takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel one potato (60 potatoes / 1.5 minutes per potato = 40 minutes), it will take him 40 minutes to peel all 60 potatoes.
Cutting: On the other hand, it takes Billy only 5 seconds to cut each potato after they have been peeled (60 potatoes x 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds). So, it will take him 300 seconds or 5 minutes to cut all 60 potatoes.
Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to prepare all 60 potatoes is 40 + 5 = 45 minutes."
"Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to subtract the amount of money they made from the total amount they spent on ingredients. Let's break down their expenses first:

* Lemons: $3 x 20 glasses/gallon = $60 (per gallon)
* Sugar: $2 x 20 glasses/gallon = $40 (per gallon)
* Total cost per gallon = $100

Now, let's calculate their profit:

Profit = Sales revenue - Total cost
= $25 (profit) - ($100 x number of gallons sold)

Since they made $25 in profit, they must have sold:

$25 / ($100 per gallon) = 0.25 gallons

So, they spent $0.25 x $100 = $25 on lemons."
"Response:  The information given in the problem is:

* Number of Asians = 240
* Number of Japanese = 80
* Rest are Chinese
* Number of boys on the Chinese team = 60

We can start by using the fact that there are more boys than girls on the Chinese team to deduce that the number of girls on the Chinese team is less than or equal to half of the total number of students on the Chinese team.

Let x be the number of girls on the Chinese team. Since there are 60 boys on the Chinese team, we have:

x + 60 <= 140 (since there are 240 Asians in total)

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

x <= 80

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is at most 80."
Response:  After calculating each of Zaids expenses and donations, we can determine that he has $5800 left over after all of his expenditures. Here is a breakdown of the calculations: Rent - $1500 (since Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent) Car Fuel - $900 (since Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel) Donation - $3000 (half of the remaining amount after subtracting rent and car fuel from Zaids total income) Daughters Weekly Expenses - $200 Groceries and Household Goods - $700 Total Remaining Amount = $5800 ($3000 + $200 + $700) Therefore, Zaid will have $5800 left over after all of his expenses and donations.
"Response:  Let's start by using the information given in the problem to set up an equation. We know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so we can write:
Rani = Monic + 10
We also know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so we can write:
Monic = Bo - 4
Now we can substitute these equations into each other to get:
Rani = (Bo - 4) + 10
= 40 + 10
= 50
So the total number of crabs the three have together is 50."
Response:  For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 x 5 = $50. For the second week, he earned $10 x 8 = $80. Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $50 + $80 = $130 for the first two weeks.
Response:  Let X be the number of votes the loser received. Since the winner received 3/4 of the votes, the number of votes the winner received is 3X/4. We know that the total number of votes cast was 80, so we can set up the equation: 3X/4 + X = 80. Solving for X, we get: X = 20. Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

"Response:  To solve this problem we need to calculate the time it takes for each member of both teams to complete their respective legs of the relay race. Let's start with the better-rounded team:

* First runner (leg time = 55 seconds)
	+ Total distance = 4 x 400 meters = 1600 meters
	+ Time taken = 55 seconds
* Second runner (leg time = 52 seconds - 3 seconds slower than first runner)
	+ Total distance = 4 x 400 meters = 1600 meters
	+ Time taken = 52 seconds - 3 seconds = 49 seconds
* Third runner (leg time = 50 seconds - 3 seconds slower than second runner)
	+ Total distance = 4 x 400 meters = 1600 meters
	+ Time taken = 50 seconds - 3 seconds = 47 seconds
* Fourth runner (leg time = 48 seconds - 3 seconds slower than third runner)
	+ Total distance = 4 x 400 meters = 1600 meters
	+ Time taken = 48 seconds - 3 seconds = 45 seconds

Now let's move on to the less well-rounded team:

* First runner (leg time = 60 seconds)
	+ Total distance = 4 x 400 meters = 1600 meters
	+ Time taken = 60 seconds
* Second runner (leg time = 57 seconds - 3 seconds slower than first runner)
	+ Total distance = 4 x 400 meters = 1600 meters
	+ Time taken = 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds
* Third runner (leg time = 55 seconds - 3 seconds slower than second runner)
	+ Total distance = 4 x 400 meters = 1600 meters
	+ Time taken = 55 seconds - 3 seconds = 52 seconds
* Fourth runner (leg time = 53 seconds - 3 seconds slower than third runner)
	+ Total distance = 4 x 400 meters = 1600 meters

"Response:  To determine the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to calculate the number of ways this can occur and divide by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's assume there are 6 possible outcomes when Jerry rolls the die:

1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is calculated as follows:

Number of favorable outcomes = 4 (out of 6 possible outcomes) x 100 / Total number of outcomes = 40%

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on the die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 or 50%. The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll, given that an even number was rolled on the first roll, is also 3/6 or 50%. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

Probability of two even numbers in a row = (50% x 50%) = 25%

So, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is 40%, while the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%."
"Response:  Let's assume that Jenna picked x apples. Since her mother picked twice as many apples as Jenna, her mother picked 2x apples. So, the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother is:
Apples = x + 2x = 3x
Therefore, they picked a total of 3x apples."
Response:  Let's start by using the information that there are 3 cages with rats and each cage has 6 rats, so there are 3 x 6 = 18 rats in total. Since there are no other animals in the store that use straw, all 18 rats must be in the same cage. Therefore, there are 18 rats in each cage.
Response:  To find out how much Mandy needs to pay to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount that Mandy owes including the interest. The formula for calculating the total amount is: Total Amount = Principal + Interest x Time. In this case, the principal is $100 and the time is 3 months (or 0.5 years). So, the total amount that Mandy owes to Benedict can be calculated as follows: Total Amount = $100 + ($100 x 2%) x 0.5 = $100 + $2 = $102 Therefore, Mandy should give $102 to Benedict after 3 months.
"Response:  Let's start by using the information given in the problem:

* The trader paid $20 per bag for the wheat.
* It cost $2 per bag to transport the wheat from the farm to the warehouse.
* The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags.

We can start by calculating the total cost of purchasing and transporting the wheat:

Total cost = Number of bags x Price per bag + Transportation cost
=? x $20 + $2 x Number of bags

Since the trader made a total profit of $400, we know that the total revenue (i.e., the amount earned from selling the wheat) is equal to the total cost plus the profit:

Revenue = Total cost + Profit
=? x $30 + $400

Now, let's try to solve for the number of bags sold. We can do this by substituting the values given in the problem into one of these equations:

1. Total cost = Number of bags x Price per bag + Transportation cost
or
2. Revenue = Total cost + Profit

Using equation 1, we get:

Total cost = Number of bags x $20 + $2 x Number of bags
=? x $20 + $2 x Number of bags

Substituting the value of the profit ($400), we get:

Number of bags = Total cost / ($20 + $2)
=? / ($20 + $2)

Simplifying and solving for Number of bags, we get:

Number of bags = $800 / ($20 + $2)
= 40 bags

Therefore, the trader bought and sold 40 bags of wheat."
"Response:  Let's start by identifying the given information:

1. The total cost of the three tickets to the fair is $20.25.
2. The cost of food was $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets.
3. Each person paid an equal amount for the two rides ($33 x 2 = $66).

Now, let's use this information to find out how much each person paid for everything:

Total cost of tickets + Total cost of food + Total cost of rides = $20.25 + ($4.50 - $20.25) + $66 = $90.75

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, each person paid:

$90.75 / 3 = $30.25

So, each friend paid $30.25 in total."
Response:  John collects 60 peaches (2 peaches/minute x 3 hour).
Response:  The number of pounds of insects that the ducks need per day can be calculated by dividing the total amount of insects needed per week (3.5 pounds) by the number of days in a week (7). Therefore, the answer is:  0.51 pounds of insects per day per duck.

"Response: 42

Explanation:
The number of pink plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday is equal to the total number of pink plastic flamingos initially plus the number of white plastic flamingos that were replaced with pink ones. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pink plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday as follows:

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.
On Saturday morning, the neighbors replaced 6 (one-third) of the pink flamingos with white ones, so there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos, bringing the total number of pink flamingos to 30 (12 + 18).
Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 30 pink plastic flamingos out compared to 6 white plastic flamingos."
"Response:  If Violetta buys 5 crayons, each costing $2, then the total cost of the crayons is:
$2 x 5 = $10
Since Violetta has $20 to spend, she will have $20 - $10 = $10 left over after purchasing the crayons. Therefore, she will receive $10 in change."
Response: 8 pens = (1.20 x 8) + (0.30 x 8) = $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00
Response:  To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount that each restaurant will receive from the total amount of carrots available. Since each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants in total, the total amount of carrots that each restaurant will receive is 40 x 2 = 80 pounds. Therefore, the total amount of carrots that will not be used is 200 - 80 = 120 pounds.
Response:  There are 5674 children in Soda.

"Response:  To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each publisher and then add it up. Let's start by calculating his earnings from Publisher A:

Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A, which means he earns $500 (5 cents x 500 sentences).

Now let's calculate his earnings from Publisher B:

Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, which means he earns $1000 ($2 x 500 sentences).

So, in total, Mark earns $1500 in a week ($500 + $1000)."
Response:  To find out how much water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total amount of water he gets in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, he gets 5 pails of water, so he gets 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water. In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails of water, so he gets 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water. Therefore, Baldur gets a total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water every day.
"Response:  $104 800
Explanation:
John made $2000 per week, which is equivalent to $104,800 per year (based on a 52-week year). With the additional $5000 award money, his total earnings for the year would be $109,800 ($104,800 + $5,000)."
Response:  The farm produces 5 x 10 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, the total number of barrels produced by the farm is 50 x 2 = 100 barrels of wine per year.
"Response:  The total number of slices of cheese that Carl used during the week can be calculated as follows:
Sandwiches = 5 (he ate a sandwich every day) x 2 slices/sandwich = 10 slices of cheese
Omelets = 3 days x 1 slice/omelet + 1 slice/sandwich = 4 slices of cheese
Macaroni and cheese = 8 slices of cheese
Total slices of cheese used by Carl = 10 + 4 + 8 = 22 slices of cheese
Therefore, Carl used 22 slices of cheese during the week."
Response:  Janet has a total of 38 pens (22 green + 10 yellow + 6 blue + 2 red).
"Response:  To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we can use the formula for calculating a weighted average:

average = (highest score x number of tests) + (next highest score x number of tests - 1) +... + (lowest score x number of tests)

In this case, Brinley has already taken five tests with scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The highest score is 100, so the first term in the formula is:

(100 x 5) + (92 x 4) + (86 x 3) + (71 x 2) + (89 x 1) = 450

Next, we subtract the lowest score, which is 71, multiplied by 2:

450 - (71 x 2) = 450 - 142 = 308

So, Brinley needs a score of at least 308 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"Response:  Total distance = (Number of times per week x Distance per trip) + (Number of times per week x Distance per trip x Number of weeks)
Total distance = (5 x 25 km/week) + (2 x 60 km/week x 3 weeks)
= 125 km + 180 km
= 305 km
Therefore, Michael did a total of 305 kilometers on his bike."
Response:  Joe's bag of Halloween candy weighs 1600 grams (25 x 40 g + 80 x 20 g).
"Response:  After all three days, Rose bought a total of 120 cakes.

Explanation:
On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes, so she bought a total of 4 cakes for that day.
On Tuesday, she bought 3 times that number, which is 12 cakes (since 3 x 4 = 12). So, she bought a total of 16 cakes for Tuesday (4 + 12 = 16).
On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 75 cakes (since 5 x 16 = 75). So, she bought a total of 91 cakes for all three days (16 + 75 = 91)."
"Response:  The information given in the problem is:
Twenty dozen cups = 480 cups (since there are 12 cups in a dozen)
Cost of half a dozen plates = $6000 x 3 = $18,000
Difference between cost of cups and plates = $1200 - $18,000 =-$16,800
To find out how much one cup costs, we can divide the difference by the number of cups:
$16,800 / 480 cups = $35 per cup
Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $35."
Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and doing chores. We know that Sara has $10 saved before she starts babysitting, so let's add that to the money she earns from babysitting: $5 x 4 = $20 + $10 = $30. Now, we subtract the cost of the jacket and shoes from the total amount of money Sara has: $30 - $30 = $0. So, Sara only needs to mow the lawn once to be able to afford the jacket and shoes!
Response:  Let's assume that Jerry has x red chickens. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, we know that the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, we know that the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(y), where y is the number of white chickens. We are also given that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  3x + 5y = 42. Now, we are told that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This means that if there are y white chickens, then there are (y-2) red chickens. Substituting this value into the previous equation gives us:  3x + 5(y-2) = 42. Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  x = 10. So, Jerry has 10 red chickens.
"Response:  To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to multiply the length of the park (in miles) by his speed (in miles per hour):
Length of park x Speed = Time spent walking
= 1.5 x 3 = 4.5 hours
Therefore, Gary spends 4.5 hours walking around the park."
Response:  Let's call the number of customers on the first day x. Since there were 50 more customers on the second day, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50 = 100. On the third day, there were 50 more customers than on the second day, so the number of customers on the third day is (x + 50) + 50 = 200. Therefore, the number of customers on the third day was 200.
Response:  The small pool initially had x gallons of water. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water. After 4 minutes, the big pool had 4 times as much water as the small pool, so the big pool now has 4(2x) = 8x gallons of water. Therefore, the small pool now has x - 8x = -7x gallons of water.
"Response: 160 hours
Explanation: To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to divide the total cost of the shoes and belt by her hourly wage. In this case, the total cost is $352 ($320 + $32), and her hourly wage is $8. Therefore, Lori needs to work for:
$352 / $8 = 160 hours
So, Lori will have to work for 160 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt."
"Response:  By solving this problem we need to find out how much money Janeth has paid each month and what is her remaining balance after 12 months. Let's start by analyzing the information given in the question:

* Monthly payment: $165
* Number of months: 12
* Original amount borrowed: $2000
* Additional percentage: 10%

Now let's calculate the total amount that Janeth has paid over the course of 12 months:
Total amount paid = Monthly payment x Number of months = $165 x 12 = $2000

So, Janeth has paid back the entire original amount of $2000. Now let's find out her remaining balance:
Remaining balance = Original amount - Total amount paid = $2000 - $2000 = $0

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months is $0."
"Response:  Total antal blommor i vasen = Antalet roser + Antalet dahliar.

"Response:  The given information can be represented as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 × (Harriet's age)
Harriet's age = (Zack's age) / 2

Now, we are asked to find the average age of the three people in three years, assuming that Harriet is currently 21 years old. We can use the above equations to calculate their ages at this time:
Adrian's age = 3 × (21) = 63 years
Harriet's age = (Zack's age) / 2 = (Zack's age - 21) / 2 = 49 years

Therefore, the average age of the three people in three years will be:
Average age = (63 + 49) / 3 = 58 years"
Response: 49
Response:  Carmen spent 70 minutes playing crossword puzzles and 40 minutes playing sudoku puzzles over the weekend.
Response:  The amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters is 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30). Since she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, there are now 60 liters of water in the tank (30 + 2 x 60 = 60).
Response:  Andy plants a total of 130 flowers (90 geraniums + 40 fewer petunias).
"Response:  The information given in the problem is:
Year 1: $15000
Year 2: $5000 (a third of Year 1)
To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we can multiply the amount spent in each year by 2:
Year 1: $15000 x 2 = $30,000
Year 2: $5000 x 2 = $10,000
Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $40,000 ($30,000 + $10,000)."
Response:  To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, we need to calculate the total time each of them used the boat or raft. For Carlos, he used the canoe for 3 hours, so his cost is $30/hour x 3 hours = $90. For Benji, he used the raft for 5 hours, so his cost is $18/hour x 5 hours = $90. Therefore, together they will pay $90 + $90 = $180 for their rentals.
Response:  If Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, it will take him twice as long to make the round-trip journey compared to just going there by bus. Therefore, if it took 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester, it will take 12 days for the round-trip journey (6 + 6 = 12).
"Response:  The probability of picking a water type Pokémon card can be calculated as follows:

Total number of cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90
Number of water type cards before losing 8 = 40 / 90 x 100% = 44.44%
Number of water type cards after losing 8 = 40 - 8 = 32
Number of grass type cards bought = 14
Probability of picking a water type card = Number of water type cards / Total number of cards = 32 / 90 x 100% = 35.56%
Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability of picking a water type card is 36%."
Response:  $7.75
Response:  To solve for the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to find out how many minutes they can work on the puzzle in total. We know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so she can do 4 x 360 = 14400 pieces in one hour. Since her mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her contribution is 14400 / 2 = 7200 pieces per hour. Therefore, the total number of minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle is 360 pieces / 7200 pieces per hour = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes.
"Response:  The number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks can be calculated as follows:

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons on the farm. After two months, 30% of these melons were ready for harvest, which is 36 melons (since 30% of 120 is 36). So, the total number of melons left on the farm was 84 (120 - 36).

Two weeks later, when Ashlyn returned, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest, which is 61 melons (since 3/4 of 84 is 61). Therefore, the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 23 (84 - 61)."
"Response:  Total cost = (Number of cars x Price per car) + Tax + Registration fee
Total cost = 12 x $20,000 + ($20,000 x 10%) + $1000

Total cost = $260,000"
"Response:  Kylie collects 30 shells on Tuesday.  
Bereasoning:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so Robert collected 20 shells.  On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, which means she collected 2 x 5 = 10 additional shells. Therefore, Kylie collects a total of 5 + 10 = 15 shells on Tuesday."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that there are half as many bugs as ants in the garden, which means that if there are x ants, there are 2x bugs. Also, we know that Dax found 50 ants in the garden. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is:

Insects = Ants + Bugs
= 50 + (2x)
= 100

So, there are 100 insects in the garden."

"Response: 4

Explanation:
Steve wants to grow enough cherry tomatoes for himself, so he needs to know how many vines he needs to plant in order to get the desired amount of tomatoes. Let's assume that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. Since Steve wants to eat 6 tomatoes per day, he will need 2 times 6 = 12 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines he needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes by the number of tomatoes produced per vine: 12 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes per vine = 4 vines. Therefore, Steve needs 4 vines to grow enough cherry tomatoes for himself."
"Response:  John needs to order 5 pizzas.  
For explanation:  Each pizza is divided into 8 slices, so if there are 20 friends, they will be able to eat 4 slices of pizza each (20 x 4 = 80). Since a pizza is only divided into 8 slices, John needs to order 80/8 = 10 pizzas. However, since you cannot buy a fraction of a pizza, he will round up to the nearest whole number which gives him 5 pizzas."
"Response:  To find out how many total pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the number of pens he will be able to make using the mixed ink. Since each pen requires 1/5 of an empty pen's ink, we can use this ratio to determine how much ink is available for making new pens.
Let's assume that the 25 pens contain a total of 125 ml of ink (since there are 5 pens per 25). Then, the amount of ink available for making new pens is:
125 ml / 5 = 25 ml
Since each pen requires 1/5 of an empty pen's ink, Ram will be able to make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens using the mixed ink. Therefore, he will end up with 5 + 25 = 30 total pens."
Response:  After one year, Johnny had $30 + $20 = $50.
"Response:  The sum of the ages of the three girls can be calculated as follows:
Mary's age = 2 years younger than Joan = 2 - 5 = -3 years old (since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa)
Jessa's age = 20 years old
Mary's age + Jessa's age = -3 + 20 = 17 years old
Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 17 years old."
Response:  Let's denote the total number of students as $T = 1000$. Since $30\%$ of the students went out through exit $A$, the number of students who went out through exit $A$ is $\frac{3}{10} \times T = 300$. Now, we have $\frac{27}{50}$ of the remaining students going out through exit $B$, so the number of students who went out through exit $B$ is $\frac{27}{50} \times (T - 300) = 940$. Finally, the number of students who went out through exit $C$ is $(T - 300 - 940) = 860$. Therefore, the answer is $860$.
"Response:  Let's assume that James has x candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, John has 2x candies. We know that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:

James = x
John = 2x

Now, we want to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we subtract James' value from John's value:

Number of candies John has more than James = John - James
= 2x - x
= 2

Therefore, John has 2 more candies than James."
Response:  The total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read at the end is:  2 + 1 = 3 books.
Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and divide it by the time it takes him to write one page. Let's assume that Mike stops being pen pals with two people after writing 100 letters together (since each person sends 2 letters per week, this means Mike has written 50 letters for each of the two people). So, in total, Mike has written 50 x 2 = 100 letters per week. Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 6 minutes per letter on average. Therefore, the total time he spends writing letters per week is: Number of letters / Time per letter = 100 letters / 6 minutes/letter = 16.67 hours/week Now, let's convert this value from hours to minutes: 16.67 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 1008 minutes/week Finally, we can convert this value back to hours by dividing by the number of minutes in an hour: 1008 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 16.7 hours/week So, Mike spends approximately 16.7 hours per week writing letters to his remaining three pen pals.
Response:  If Jason has 1000 minutes per month and uses 15 minutes every day for calls with his boss, that is 45 minutes per week (since there are 7 days in a week). Therefore, Jason has used 600 minutes (45 x 30) on calls with others this month. So, Jason has 400 minutes left (1000 - 600 = 400). Since the month has 30 days, Jason has 13.33 minutes left per day (400 / 30 = 13.33).
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Griffin had 24 French fries to start with.
* Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 19.
* Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 10 more French fries (2 x 5 = 10).
* Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her own French fries, which we can assume is a small amount (let's say 3).
* Colby took 3 fewer French fries than Kyle took (3 - 5 = -2).

So, at this point, Griffin has 19 + 10 + 3 = 32 French fries.

Now, let's check if our answer makes sense based on the information provided:

* The problem states that Griffin had 27 French fries in the end.
* So, if we add up all the French fries that Griffin received or gained throughout the problem, we get: 19 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 35.
* This means that Ginger must have given Griffin 37 - 35 = 2 French fries.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 2 French fries."
"Response:  Let's call the number of fish in Aquarium A ""x"". Since the difference between the number of snails in Aquarium A and Aquarium B is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write: Snails in Aquarium A = 2x Fish in Aquarium A + x Snails in Aquarium B. Similarly, we can write: Snails in Aquarium B = 32 - (2x + x) = 32 - 3x. Now we want to find out what value of ""x"" satisfies these equations. Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get: 2x + x = 32 - 3x. Simplifying, we get: 3x = 16. So, there are 16 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  $3,750

Explanation:

* First, calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked on Jean during the 5-week movie shoot: 6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = 80 hours.
* Next, calculate the cost of the makeup for each day of the shoot: $250/hour x 6 hours/day = $1,500 per day.
* Multiply the daily cost by the total number of days worked to get the overall cost of the makeup: $1,500/day x 80 hours = $120,000.
* Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, subtract 10% of the total cost from the original price: $120,000 x 0.9 = $108,000.
* Therefore, Jean paid $108,000 for the makeup services during the movie shoot."
Response:  Each person paid $70 / 3 = $23.33.
Response:  The chef spent $ x. To find out how much the chef spent, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that result by the price per pound. So, we can write an equation like this: x = (Number of bags) × (Weight of one bag) × ($/pound). In this case, we know that the number of bags is 4, the weight of each bag is 50 pounds, and the price per pound is $1.50. Plugging these values into our equation gives us: x = 4 × 50 × $1.50 = $600. Therefore, the chef spent $600 on onions.
Response:  Let's start by using the information that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. So if her sister ate x cookies on Monday, Sue ate 4x cookies. Then we are told that on Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So if her sister ate x cookies on Tuesday, Sue ate 2x cookies. Finally, we know that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by both girls together on Monday is 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. Since each cookie has 200 calories, the total number of calories consumed by both girls together on Monday is 18 x 200 = 3600 calories. Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister. We can do this by subtracting the number of calories consumed by her sister from the total number of calories consumed by both girls together: 3600 - (18 x 200) = 3600 - 3600 = 0 calories. So, Sue did not consume any more calories than her sister.
