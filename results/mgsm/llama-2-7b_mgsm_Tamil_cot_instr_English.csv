Response:  The number of days in a year is 365 (or 366 in leap years).  So, if Janathi has 16 months with 28 days each, then there are 16 x 28 = 432 days in total. Now, let's calculate how many days Janathi spends with his wife during these 16 months. Since he wakes up at midnight every day and goes to bed at dawn every day, he spends 16 x 2 = 32 days with his wife during these 16 months. Therefore, the answer is 432 - 32 = 400 days.
Response:  If we have one apple and want to share it equally among 5 people, each person will get 0.2 apple (1/5). Now, if we have 10 apples and want to distribute them equally among 3 people, each person will get 3.33 apples (10/3). Similarly, if we have 100 apples and want to distribute them equally among 4 people, each person will get 25 apples (100/4). Therefore, the number of apples that each person gets depends on the total number of apples available and the number of people sharing them.
Response:  The person invested Rs. 80,000 in a property and after 2 years, it appreciated to Rs. 160,000. So, the profit made is Rs. 80,000 (Rs. 160,000 - Rs. 80,000). Now, if he sells the property for Rs. 240,000, then his gain would be Rs. 160,000 (Rs. 240,000 - Rs. 80,000). Therefore, the person has made a profit of 150% on their investment.
Response:  James has 3 boxes of 3 items each, and he wants to distribute them equally among 6 people. So, we need to divide 18 (the total number of items) by 6 (the number of people). Therefore, each person will get 3 items per box x 3 boxes = 9 items in total. Now, let's see how many items each person will get from one box. Since there are 3 items in each box, if James gives 1 box to 1 person, that person will get 3 items. So, the answer is 9 items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the girl has 15 capsules in her bag for the boyfriend and 25 capsules for herself. So, altogether she has 40 capsules (15 + 25). Now, let's assume that each capsu...
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kailash has 5 dalasis in his pocket and he spends 3 dalasis on a kite. So, he has 2 dalasis left with him. Now, let's calculate how much percentage of the remaining amount is spent on each of the 16 kites. To do this, we will divide the cost of each kite (60%) by the total amount left with Kailash (2 dalasis). This gives us:  Cost of each kite = 60% / 2 dalasis = Rs. 30 per kite. Therefore, Kailash spends Rs. 480 (16 x Rs. 30) on all the 16 kites.
Response:  We know that there are 16 districts in Tamil Nadu and each district has at least 5 taluks. So, the total number of taluks in Tamil Nadu is 16 x 5 = 80 taluks. Now, we need to find out how many of these taluks have their headquarters in Chennai city. According to the question, 4 taluks (Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore, and Salem) have their headquarters in Chennai city. Therefore, the number of taluks with their headquarters in Chennai city is 4/80 = 0.05 or 5%.
Response:  Karla has 200 GB of storage space available in her Google Drive account. She wants to know how much space she can free up after deleting some files. To calculate this, we need to consider two factors: (1) The size of each file that she deletes and (2) The percentage of free space that is available after deleting each file.  Based on the information provided in the question, let's assume that each file that Karla deletes is approximately 2 GB in size. This means that if she deletes 20 files, she will free up approximately 40% of her total storage space (i.e., 20 x 2 GB = 40 GB). However, since she only has 200 GB of storage space available, this means that she will not be able to delete all 20 files without running out of space. In fact, she will only be able to delete about 10 files before running out of space (i.e., 200 GB - 40 GB = 160 GB remaining / 2 GB per file = 80 files). Therefore, the maximum number of files that Karla can delete from her Google Drive account is 80.
Response:  John has $60 in his wallet and spends $3 on something every month. He has $57 left after spending $3. Then he gets $10 as an allowance from his father, so now he has $67. After spending $20 on something, he is left with $47. Now let's calculate how much money he will have after spending another $10. If he spends $10, he will be left with $37. So the final amount of money he will have after spending all the given amounts is $37.
Response:  Elixavin has $40 to spend and he wants to buy something that costs at least $10 per month for 1.2 years. So, the total cost of what he buys should be at least $48 (1.2 x $10). Now, if Elixavin spends all his money on this thing, then he will have nothing left afterward. Therefore, the maximum amount he can spend is $40 - $48 = $8. Hence, the answer is $8.
"Response:  The number of days in each month is given as follows:

January - 31 days
February - 28 days (29 days in leap years)
March - 31 days
April - 30 days
May - 31 days
June - 30 days
July - 31 days
August - 31 days
September - 30 days
October - 31 days
November - 30 days
December - 31 days

The total number of days in a year is 365 days (or 366 days in leap years).

Now, let's calculate the percentage of days that are weekends:

Weekend days = Saturday + Sunday
Total number of weekend days per year = 2 x 7 = 14 days
Percentage of weekend days = 14/365 (or 14/366) x 100%

So, approximately 38.8% (or 39%) of the days in a year are weekends."
Response:  Tulasi has 3 dogs and each dog costs $68. So, the total cost of 3 dogs is $68 x 3 = $204.  Then, she has 2 cats and each cat costs $80. So, the total cost of 2 cats is $80 x 2 = $160. Finally, she has 6 birds and each bird costs $55. So, the total cost of 6 birds is $55 x 6 = $330. Therefore, the total cost of all pets is $204 + $160 + $330 = $794.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 90 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a year is 90 x 24 = 2160 hours. Now, let's calculate how many hours Carl can work per month. Since he works for 8 hours a day, his daily working hours are 8 hours/day x 30 days/month = 240 hours/month. Therefore, the total number of hours Carl can work in a year is 2160 hours / 12 months = 179.2 hours (approximately).
Response:  Melani is a 30-year-old woman who has been working as an interior designer for 10 years. She has designed many beautiful homes and offices in Chennai. One day, she received a call from her friend who lives in Bangalore. Her friend told her that he had bought a new house in Bangalore and wanted Melani to design it. Melani was very excited about this opportunity and agreed to do the job. She started working on the project immediately and spent several days researching different designs and colors that would suit her client's taste. After a few weeks, she finally presented her design to her client. The client was very impressed with Melani's work and gave her the green light to proceed with the project. Melani was thrilled and worked hard to make sure everything was perfect before moving on to the next stage of the project. As she continued to work on the project, she realized that there were some issues with the construction of the building. The walls were not straight, and the doors did not fit properly. Melani knew that these problems could affect the overall look and feel of the home, so she decided to take matters into her own hands. She went to the site every day and worked closely with the contractors to ensure that the construction was done correctly. It took several months, but eventually, the construction was completed, and Melani was able to move on to the final stages of the project. She chose all the furniture, fixtures, and decorations herself and made sure they matched her original design perfectly. Finally, after several months of hard work, the project was complete, and Melani's client was overjoyed with the result. Melani felt proud of what she had accomplished and knew that her dedication and attention to detail had paid off.
Response:  We have 20 people who are happy with their current job (20%). Out of those 20, 4 people are very satisfied (25%). Among the remaining 16 people, 4 are highly satisfied (25%). So, in total, we have 4 + 4 = 8 people who are highly satisfied with their current job.
"Response:  The investor has invested $5,000 in stock A and $8,000 in stock B. If we assume that both stocks have an equal risk level (i.e., they are equally likely to increase or decrease in value), then the expected return from each stock can be calculated as follows:
Expected return from Stock A = Probability of stock price increasing x (Initial investment + Expected return) - Probability of stock price decreasing x Initial investment
= ($5,000 + $250) x 0.7 - ($5,000 x 0.3)
= $4,250 - $1,500
= $2,750

Similarly, the expected return from Stock B is:
Expected return from Stock B = Probability of stock price increasing x (Initial investment + Expected return) - Probability of stock price decreasing x Initial investment
= ($8,000 + $250) x 0.7 - ($8,000 x 0.3)
= $6,400 - $2,400
= $4,000

Now, let's calculate the total expected return from both stocks combined:
Total expected return = Expected return from Stock A + Expected return from Stock B
= $2,750 + $4,000
= $6,750

Finally, if the investor sells their shares after one year at a price of $9,000 per share, their profit would be:
Profit = Selling price - Purchase price
= $9,000 - $5,000
= $4,000

So, based on this scenario, the investor could potentially make a profit of $4,000 from their investment in both stocks combined."
"Response:  The train travels for 80 miles in one hour and then stops at a station for 15 minutes. After that, it starts moving again and covers another 80 miles in one hour. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is:

Distance = Speed x Time + Stop time x Distance traveled during stop
= 80 x 2 + 150
= 360 + 150
= 510 miles
Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 510 miles."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 directors and 30 designers in the company.  Therefore, the total number of employees in the company is 20 + 30 = 50.  Now, out of these 50 employees, 35 are engineers and 15 are designers. So, the number of engineers in the company is 35, and the number of designers is 15. Finally, the average age of all employees in the company is 35 / 50 x 100 = 70 years.
Response:  The girl has to carry three bags of rice in each of the four days. So, she needs to carry 12 bags of rice (3 x 4 = 12). But, there is no information about how big or small each bag of rice is. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact weight of the rice that the girl needs to carry.
Response:  Marichi had 12 mails in her first month and she sent 4 mails to each of the next two months. So, in total, she sent 4 x 2 = 8 mails in the second month. Now, there are 3 more months after that, so she will send 8 x 3 = 24 mails in those three months combined. Therefore, the total number of mails Marichi sent is 8 + 24 = 32 mails.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 liters of water in the container and it is filled to the brim ( full). So, the height of the water level is equal to 10 liters. Now, let's consider the situation where the water level reduces to 9 liters due to evaporation or any other reason. The height of the water level will be less than 10 liters, say x cm. Similarly, if the water level reduces to 8 liters, the height of the water level will be less than x cm, say y cm. Therefore, the difference between the height of the water level at 10 liters and the height of the water level at 8 liters is given by: y - x = 2 cm. Since the height of the water level at 9 liters is between x and y, we can write: x < y < 10. Finally, since the height of the water level at 24 liters is maximum, we have: y = 24 cm. Therefore, the height of the water level at 24 liters is 24 cm.
Response:  Raman is currently 45 years old (as per the question). He will be 60 years old in 13 years (as per the question). So, his age at that time would be 60 - 13 = 47 years old. Now, if he lives for another 31 years after turning 47, then his total age would be 47 + 31 = 78 years old. Therefore, the correct answer is 78 years old.
Response:  The number of people who can watch TV is 8. Among them, 3 are old and cannot move easily, so they cannot watch TV. Therefore, the remaining 5 people can watch TV. Now, among these 5 people, 2 are children, so they cannot operate the TV themselves. So, only 3 adults (out of the remaining 5) can operate the TV. Finally, out of these 3 adults, one person is the father of the child who broke the TV, so he cannot operate it either. Therefore, there is only one person left who can operate the TV.
"Response:  We have two centimeters in total. One of them is with the doctor and the other one is with the patient. So, we can say that the distance between the doctor and the patient is 1 cm. Now, let's assume that the doctor has to move 2 meters towards the patient. So, the distance between the doctor and the patient after moving 2 meters will be:

Distance = Speed x Time + Initial Distance
= 2 m/s x 2 s + 1 cm
= 4 cm + 1 cm
= 5 cm
Therefore, the distance between the doctor and the patient after moving 2 meters is 5 cm."
Response:  The cost of the painting is Rs. 1950 and it has been reduced by 25%. So, the new price of the painting after reduction is: New Price = Old Price x (1 - 0.25) = 1950 x 0.75 = Rs. 1437.50. Therefore, the remaining amount after discount is Rs. 1437.50.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of all the items Mariyappan has purchased. The cost of each item is given as follows:  * 1 pair of shoes = $3.00  * 1 backpack = $12.00  * 1 set of pens = $1.50  So, the total cost of all the items Mariyappan has purchased can be calculated as follows:  Total Cost = ($3.00 x 4) + ($12.00 x 1) + ($1.50 x 4) = $36.00 Now, we need to find out how much money Mariyappan has left after purchasing these items. We are told that he had $50 with him initially and spent $36.00 on the items. Therefore, the amount of money Mariyappan has left can be calculated as follows: Money Left = Initial Amount - Spent Amount = $50.00 - $36.00 = $14.00 So, Mariyappan has $14.00 left after purchasing the items.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how much money Misaka has in total. We know that she has 3 judis of shards, each worth $16.50, and 3 judis of pennies, each worth $0.01. Therefore, the total amount of money Misaka has is:

$16.50 x 3 = $49.50 (shards)
$0.01 x 3 = $0.30 (pennies)
Total amount of money Misaka has = $49.80
Now, let's find out how much money each type of coin can buy. We know that one judi of shards can buy 42 dalrs, and one penny can buy $0.01 dalr. Therefore, the value of each shard is:

Value of one shard = $42/3 = $14 dalrs
Value of one penny = $0.01/1 = $0.01 dalr
Now, let's calculate the total value of all the coins Misaka has:

Total value of shards = $49.80 x $14 = $676.40
Total value of pennies = $49.80 x $0.01 = $0.498
Therefore, the total value of all the coins Misaka has is $676.89."
Response:  The man buys 15 ice creams at $4 each and sells them for $3 each. So he makes a profit of $1 per ice cream. Now, if he sells all 60 ice creams in 60 days, his total profit would be: Profit = Number of ice creams x Profit per ice cream x Days = 60 x $1 x 60 = $3600.
Response:  Henna is 30 years old and has been working as a hairstylist for 10 years. She earns $40 per hour and works 20 hours a week. Her monthly income is therefore $800 (40 x 20). If she saves $150 of her income each month, then after 10 years, she will have saved $18,000 ($150 x 10). So, Henna has saved $18,000 in total.
Response:  If she has 100 shares of stock A at $33 each and sells them for $45 each, her profit would be: Profit = Selling price - Buying price = $45 x 100 = $4,500 So, her profit is $4,500.
"Response:  The average age of the people in the world is 30 years old. So, if there are 7 billion people in the world, then the total number of people aged between 16 and 75 would be:

7 billion x (75 - 16) = 498 billion

Now, let's find out how many people are above 75 years old:

498 billion x 75/100 = 367 billion

So, there are approximately 367 billion people above 75 years old in the world."
Response:  The person has Rs. 80 in their pocket and they want to distribute it among 20 people equally. So, each person will get Rs. 4 (80/20). Now, out of these 20 people, 5 are old and need more money for their living expenses. So, we have to give them extra amount. Let's assume that each old person needs Rs. 10 extra per day. So, total amount given to each old person is Rs. 14 (Rs. 4 + Rs. 10). Now, there is one more person who doesn't fit into either category. Let's say this person needs Rs. 25 extra per day. So, total amount given to this person is Rs. 39 (Rs. 25 + Rs. 14). Therefore, the total amount distributed among all 25 people is Rs. 875 (Rs. 4 x 20 + Rs. 14 x 5 + Rs. 25 x 1).
Response:  The farmer has 12 bulls and he wants to divide them equally among his three sons. So, each son will get 4 bulls. Now, let's calculate how many days it will take for each bull to graze in a field of 0.5 mans (which is equal to 0.5 acres).  Each bull can graze for 30 days in that field, so the total number of days that all 12 bulls can graze in that field is 360 days (12 bulls x 30 days per bull = 360 days). Since there are 365 days in a year, we need to subtract 360 from 365 to find out how many extra days the bulls have left after grazing in the field for 30 days. Therefore, the answer is 9 days (365 - 360 = 9).
Response:  We know that 110 - 30 = 80. So, there are 80 red cars among the 110 cars.
Response:  We know that there are 10 questions in total and each question has 4 options to choose from. So, we have a total of 40 options to choose from. Now, let's analyze the given information carefully:  We are told that Aarav is 5 years old and he has 5 Remedies. This means that each Remedy has 5 years of effectiveness.  Moreover, we are also told that Shiyopan has 20 Remedies and each Remedy lasts for 40 years. Therefore, Shiyopan has a total of 800 years of effectiveness (20 x 40 = 800).  Now, let's calculate the number of Remedies that Shiyopan has after 40 years:  Shiyopan has 20 Remedies and each Remedy lasts for 40 years. So, after 40 years, Shiyopan will have 20 x 40 = 800 Remedies.  But, according to the question, only 40 Remedies are left with Shiyopan. Therefore, we can conclude that Shiyopan had 800 - 40 = 760 Remedies before 40 years ago.  Hence, option D is the correct answer.
Response:  Firstly, he had 40 apples and gave away 20 of them to his friends. So, he has 20 apples left. Now, out of these remaining 20 apples, he gave away 8 (which is 25% of 20). So, he has 12 apples left now. Therefore, the number of apples he has left is 12.
Response:  Terry has $2 for 2 months and spends $1 per day. Therefore, he will have $2 x 2 = $4 left after 2 months. Now, he gets $5 more from his friend. So, his new balance is $4 + $5 = $9. After 30 days, he will have $9 / 30 = $0.30 left.
Response:  We know that John has 13 legs and $ 15 to spend. He wants to buy 8 kemengals worth $ 20 each. So he will have $ 16 left after buying them. Now we are asked how many more kemengals he can buy with the remaining $ 16. To find this out, we need to divide the remaining amount ($ 16) by the cost of one kemengal ($ 2). This gives us $ 8, which is the number of additional kemengals John can buy. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  John has $60 to spend over 3 months. He spends $20 per month. Therefore, he has $40 left after 3 months. Now let's calculate how much he can buy in each of the remaining 2 months. Since there are 2 months left, he can buy twice as much in each month compared to the first month. So, in the second month, he can buy $80 ($40 x 2), and in the third month, he can buy $120 ($40 x 3). Therefore, John can buy a total of $200 worth of things during the 3 months.
Response:  If I have to walk for 3 miles in one direction and then turn around and come back, how far will I have walked in total?  The answer is simple - 6 miles! So, if there are 100 people walking in the same direction as me, they would have walked a total of 600 miles (100 x 6 miles). Now, let's assume that each person walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. How long will it take them to walk 600 miles? The answer is 200 hours (600 miles / 3 miles per hour). Therefore, if all 100 people start walking at the same time, it will take them 200 hours to complete their journey.
Response:  If Prashanth's age is 30 years and he has one son, then his son's age would be half of Prashanth's age, which is 15 years. Therefore, Suhasini's age would be twice that of her son's age, which is 30 years. So, Suhasini's age is 60 years.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Periya Drakan has 3000 coins and he wants to distribute them equally among his four friends. So, each friend will get 750 coins (3000 / 4 = 750). Now, let's consider what happens when one of the friends takes all the coins from their share without informing Periya Drakan. In this case, the remaining three friends will have 225 coins each (750 - 100 = 225), and Periya Drakan will be left with none. Therefore, the total number of coins after one of the friends takes all the coins without informing Periya Drakan is 225 + 225 + 225 + 225 = 1000 coins.
"Response:  The number of Jonas Brothers fans who have been waiting for their concert is 8 million (according to the question).  Each fan has been waiting for an average of 8 years (based on the information provided in the question). Therefore, the total number of years that Jonas Brothers fans have been waiting for their concert is:

8 million x 8 years = 64 million years
So, the answer is 64 million years."
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of rice are required to make 250 portions of 300 g each. To do this, we need to divide 250 by 300 and multiply it by 100. So, 250 / 300 = 0.83 x 100 = 83 grams per portion. Now, if we want to know how much rice is required for 5 different recipes with 83 grams of rice each, we can simply multiply 83 grams by 5 recipes, which gives us 415 grams of rice needed for all 5 recipes. Therefore, the answer is 415 grams.
Response:  The person has to sell 10 big bags of rice at $10 each, which is equal to $100. Then they have to sell 5 small bags of rice at $2 each, which is equal to $10. So in total, the person will make $110 from selling these 10 big and small bags of rice.
Response: 1. The number of days Avvaiyar lived is given as 40 years. So, she lived for (40 x 365) = 14,600 days. 2. Since Avvaiyar was born in the month of Chittirai and died in the month of Panguni, we can calculate the number of months she lived as follows: (Chittirai - Panguni) = 6 months. Therefore, Avvaiyar lived for (14,600 x 6) = 87,600 months.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Käpi has 80 posts in her Instagram account and she sold each post for $100. So, the total amount of money she earned from selling those posts is:

$80 x 80 = $6,400

Now, let's consider the second part of the question where Käpi bought 220 Post-it notes for $5 each. The total cost of buying these Post-it notes is:

$5 x 220 = $1,100

So, the total amount of money Käpi spent on buying Post-it notes is $1,100.

Now, let's calculate the profit Käpi made after selling all 23 Post-it notes. Since each Post-it note was sold for $100, the total amount of money Käpi earned from selling all 23 Post-it notes is:

$100 x 23 = $2,300

Therefore, the profit Käpi made after selling all 23 Post-it notes is:

Profit = Total amount earned - Total amount spent = $2,300 - $1,100 = $1,200

So, there are 23 Post-it notes left unsold, and Käpi made a profit of $1,200 from selling them."
Response:  The cost of 10 t-shirts is $40 each, so the total cost would be $40 x 10 = $400. Now, if we get a discount of 50%, then the new price of each t-shirt would be $400 / 2 = $200. So, the total cost of 10 t-shirts after the discount would be $200 x 10 = $2000. Therefore, the difference between the original and discounted prices is $2000 - $400 = $1600.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 4 appears in the given sequence of numbers: 32157890. To do this, we can divide the number into groups of four digits each and count the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in each group. Here are the groups of four digits each along with their corresponding counts of the digit 4: Group 1: 3-4 = 1 Group 2: 2-4 = 0 Group 3: 5-4 = 1 Group 4: 9-4 = 2 Group 5: 0-4 = 0 Therefore, there are 2 instances of the digit 4 in the given sequence of numbers.
Response:  We know that there are 15 blocks in total and each block has 8 alakulas (holes). So, the total number of holes is 15 x 8 = 120. Now, we need to find out how many holes are available for cutting. Since 3/4 of the blocks have already been cut, the remaining blocks have 7/4 = 1 1/4 blocks. Therefore, the number of holes available for cutting is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of 120 = 90 holes.
Response:  The man has 252 rupees and he wants to buy 252 items of different prices. If each item costs x rupees, then the total cost of all the items is 252x. Since the man only has 252 rupees, he can afford at most 252/x items. Therefore, the maximum number of items that the man can buy with his money is 252/x.
Response:  Damini has 10 months to complete her project and she wants to finish it within 4 months. So, she will work for 4/10 = 0.4 months per month.  Since there are 6 weeks in a month, Damini will work for 0.4 / 6 = 0.067 months per week. Therefore, Damini will take approximately 6.7 weeks or 45 days to complete her project.
Response:  Urriyavan has 15 puppies and each puppy weighs 1/4 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the puppies is 15 x 1/4 = 3.75 kg. Now, let's calculate the number of kibbles required to feed all the puppies for one day. If it takes 1 kibble to feed 1/2 kg of weight, then Urriyavan needs 3.75 kg / 1/2 = 7.5 kibbles per day to feed all his puppies. So, the answer is 7.5 kibbles.
Response:  We know that there are 6 mekkaanis and 4 cars in Vyasarkar's garage. So, we have to find out how many different combinations of mekkaanis and cars can be formed using these 10 items.  Firstly, let's consider the mekkaanis. There are 6 mekkaanis, each with its own unique number (1 to 6). Now, let's count the number of ways to combine them with the 4 cars. Since each car can be paired with any one of the 6 mekkaanis, the total number of combinations is 6 x 4 = 24. Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mrs. Doubtfire is a male character who dresses up as an old woman to be with his children after he was fired from his job as a father. Therefore, there are no female characters in this scenario. Secondly, we can infer that the 7 dwarves are not present in this situation because they are fictional characters from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which is a different story altogether. Lastly, since the question asks about the relationship between the characters in the movie, it is clear that the answer must pertain only to the characters mentioned in the film. In conclusion, the correct answer is (D) None of the above.
Response:  Jenny has 30 laps to complete and she completed 2 laps so far. She wants to take a break of 15 minutes (which is equal to 1/4 of an hour). So, after her break, she will have 30 - 2 = 28 laps left to complete. Now, let's assume that each lap takes her 5 minutes to complete. Therefore, in total, she needs to spend 28 x 5 = 140 minutes to complete all 30 laps. Since she already spent 15 minutes during her break, she has 140 - 15 = 125 minutes remaining to complete all 30 laps.
Response:  The person has invested $ 7 in each of the two stocks and there are 42 days left for the investment to mature. So, if we calculate the daily return, it will be: Daily Return = (Total Investment / Number of Days) x (Number of Shares / Market Price of Each Share) Total Return = Daily Return x (1 + Daily Return)^Number of Days Now, let's assume that the market price of each share is $ 70 at the end of the investment period. Therefore, the total return on investment can be calculated as follows: Total Return = ($ 7 x 42) x ($ 70 / $ 7) = $ 3980 This means that the person will make a profit of $ 3980 on their investment of $ 5600.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice can be filled with 5000 kg of rice.  One bag of rice weighs 50 kg, so 5000 kg is equal to 100 bags of rice (50 x 100 = 5000). Now, there are 15 bags of rice in each large bag, so there are 100/15 = 6.67 large bags of rice in 5000 kg of rice. Therefore, the number of small bags of rice that can be filled with 5000 kg of rice is 6.67 x 15 = 94 small bags of rice.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steffan spent $40.00 at Artie's store and got a discount of 25%. So, he paid $30.00 (=$40.00 x 75%) to Artie. Now, Artie gave him another discount of 10%, which is $3.00 (=$40.00 x 7.5%). So, Steffan paid $27.00 ($30.00 - $3.00) to Artie in total.
Response:  We have to find out how many multiples of 3 are there in the given number.  The given number is 6 x 5 = 30.  There are 3 multiples of 3 in 30, i.e., 3 x 3 = 9. So, the answer is 9.
Response:  We have 25 balls in total and 1 of them is red. So, there are 24 non-red balls. Out of these, 20 are white, which means that 4 balls are not white (they could be any other color). Therefore, the number of balls that are not white is 4.
Response:  The probability of Janardhan winning is 80%, and he wins Rs. 1000. So, his expected winnings are $1000 \times 0.8 = Rs. 800$. Now, out of this amount, 10% is given as commission to the organizer, which is $Rs. 80 \div 10 = Rs. 8$. Therefore, the final amount that Janardhan gets after paying the commission is $Rs. 800 - Rs. 8 = Rs. 792$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mr. Ramesh has worked for 40 years and earned an average salary of $10,000 per month. Therefore, his total earnings are:  $10,000 x 40 = $400,000  Next, we know that he saved 50% of his income during those 40 years, which is:  $400,000 x 50% = $200,000  Now, let's calculate how much money Mr. Ramesh has now after retirement at the age of 60. His retirement benefit is:  $200,000 / (1 + 5%) ^ 30 = $178,947  So, Mr. Ramesh has around $178,947 in his retirement fund after working for 40 years and saving 50% of his income.
Response:  Firstly, Aliya earned $140 from selling her old iPhone. Then, she spent $80 on buying a new iPhone XR. Therefore, Aliya has $60 left after spending money on buying a new iPhone.
Response:  Salai has 100 milestones to complete and he completed 4 of them successfully. So, the number of remaining milestones is 100 - 4 = 96. Now, we need to find out how many pedals (petrol) are required to complete those remaining milestones. According to the problem statement, each milestone requires 12 liters of petrol. Therefore, the total number of liters of petrol required to complete all the remaining milestones is 96 x 12 = 1152 liters.
Response:  The man has three days to complete his work and he wants to finish it in minimum time possible. So, he will try to maximize his efficiency during these three days. He knows that he can do one task at a time, so he will focus on completing one task per day. Since there are five tasks in total, he will be able to complete all of them within three days. Therefore, the answer is (5 x 3) = 15 days.
Response:  We have 5 women and 5 men in one group. Each woman is married to either 1 or 2 men, and each man is married to either 1 or 2 women. Therefore, there are 5C2 = 10 possible combinations of marriages among the 5 women and 5 men. Now, let's count how many times each combination appears in the given information:  (1) There is only one combination where all 5 women are married to different men, i.e., A1, B1, C1, D1, and E1 are not married to each other. So, this combination appears once.  (2) There are 4 combinations where exactly 3 women are married to different men, and the remaining woman is married to either 1 or 2 men. For example, A1, B1, C1, and D1 are married to different men, while E1 is married to either A1 or B1. So, these 4 combinations appear twice each.  (3) There are 6 combinations where exactly 2 women are married to different men, and the remaining 3 women are married to either 1 or 2 men. For example, A1 and B1 are married to different men, while C1, D1, and E1 are married to either A1 or B1. So, these 6 combinations appear thrice each.  (4) Finally, there is one combination where all 5 women are married to the same man, which is impossible since they are distinct individuals. Therefore, this combination does not appear at all.  In summary, there are 10 + 2 x 4 + 3 x 6 + 0 = 29 possible combinations of marriages among the 5 women and 5 men.
Response:  The puzzle states that there are 175 virgins and they divide into groups of 35 each to play a game with 35 rubber ducks. After playing the game, they give away all their winnings except for one rubber duck which they keep as a prize. So, the number of rubber ducks left after the game is 34 (175 - 35 - 1 = 34). Therefore, the answer is 34.
Response:  We know that there are 75 people in total (including the 60 employees and 5 managers). Now, let's assume that each manager has at least one employee reporting to them. So, we need to add the number of employees reporting to each manager to get the total number of employees under their supervision. Therefore, the total number of employees under the supervision of each manager is:  Number of Managers = 5  x Number of Employees Reporting to Each Manager =  At least 1 employee per manager  Total Number of Employees Under Supervision = 5 x 1 = 50 employees.  Since there are 75 people in total, including the 50 employees under the supervision of the 5 managers, the remaining 25 people must be either the managers themselves or other non-supervisory staff. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of Non-Supervisory Staff = 25.
Response:  Peeyli has to pay $5 for each of the 8 weeks. So, she will have to pay a total of $40 (5 x 8). Now, if she wants to buy something worth $100, she needs to save money from her weekly allowance. Therefore, the amount that Peeyli can afford to spend is $60 ($100 - $40).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 working days in a week and each day has 8 hours of work. So, total working hours per week is 5 x 8 = 40 hours/week. Now, if one worker works for 15 minutes every hour, then he will work for 40 / 15 = 2.67 hours/day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of working hours for the week is 2.67 x 7 = 18.39 hours/week. Therefore, the answer to the question is 18.39 hours/week.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 20 appears in the sequence of numbers given in the question.  The sequence is : 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.  Therefore, the number 20 appears 5 times in the sequence. So, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Damini has 30 dresses and 15 shoes.  If she sells each dress for Rs. 300 and each shoe for Rs. 400, then her total earnings from these items will be: 30 x Rs. 300 = Rs. 9,000 15 x Rs. 400 = Rs. 6,000 Total earnings = Rs. 15,000 Now, let's consider the other items that Damini sold. She had 43 pieces of jewelry and 23 watches. If she sold each piece of jewelry for Rs. 500 and each watch for Rs. 700, then her total earnings from these items will be: 43 x Rs. 500 = Rs. 21,500 23 x Rs. 700 = Rs. 15,100 Total earnings = Rs. 36,600 Therefore, Damini earned a total of Rs. 36,600 from all the items she sold.
Response:  Shilpa has $150 to invest in stocks for 3 months. The interest rate is 2%. How much will she earn per month? To calculate this, we need to use the formula: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time For Shilpa, the principal (P) is $150, the rate (R) is 2%, and the time (T) is 3 months or 0.75 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: Interest = $150 x 2% x 0.75 years = $18.75 So, Shilpa will earn $18.75 per month.
Response:  Marilyn has $2.74 in her wallet, which is made up of $1.87 from Petunia and $2.12 from Pecky. Since there are no change, she doesn't have any money left after buying something. So, the amount of money she spent is equal to the amount of money she had before buying anything. Therefore, the answer is $2.74.
Response:  The length of one side of the square is 16 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the square is 4 times the length of one side = 4 x 16 = 64 cm. Now, we need to find out how many squares with a side length of 16 cm can fit inside a rectangle with a length of 20 cm and a width of 10 cm. To do this, we divide the area of the rectangle (length x width) by the area of one square (side length squared). So, the area of the rectangle is 20 x 10 = 200 sq cm, and the area of one square is 16^2 = 256 sq cm. Therefore, the number of squares that can fit inside the rectangle is 200 / 256 = 0.8. Hence, there are approximately 0.8 rectangles that can fit inside each square.
Response:  The first cow gives birth to a calf every year for 18 years, and then it stops giving birth. So in total, there will be 18 x 3 = 54 cows. Now, let's calculate how many cows are born each year. Since there are 12 months in a year, and each month has 30 days, we can assume that one cow is born every day. Therefore, the number of cows born each year is 54 / 365 = 0.15 cows per day. Now, let's find out how many cows are born in 110 days. Since there are 0.15 cows born per day, the number of cows born in 110 days is 0.15 x 110 = 16.5 cows. So, based on the given information, there will be approximately 16.5 cows born in 110 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times Saravana can eat rice and dosa in one day. As per the question, he can eat rice and dosa for 4 months continuously without any break. Therefore, the number of days he can eat rice and dosa is 4 x 30 = 120 days. Now, let's calculate the total number of meals he can have during this period. Since he eats rice and dosa twice a day, the total number of meals he can have is 120 x 2 = 240 meals. Finally, we need to subtract the number of meals Ravichandran can have from the total number of meals available. As per the question, Ravichandran can have 400 meals in total. Therefore, the difference between the total number of meals available and the number of meals Ravichandran can have is 240 - 400 = -160 meals. So, Ravichandran cannot have any meals.
Response:  If Vincent spends $2.50 for each of the 10 items he buys, then he will spend a total of $25 (2.5 x 10). On the other hand, if he only spends $1 for each of the 10 items he buys, then he will spend a total of $10 (1 x 10). Therefore, the correct answer is $25.
"Response:  John has bought a horse for Rs. 100, and he is selling it at a profit of 30%. So, the selling price will be:

Selling Price = Cost Price x (1 + Profit Percentage)
= Rs. 100 x (1 + 0.30)
= Rs. 130

Therefore, the cost of the horse after 10 years will be Rs. 130."
Response:  If there are 6 liters of water in a container and one person can drink 1/6 of it, then that means the person can drink 1 liter of water. So, there will be 5 liters of water left after the person drinks 1 liter. Now, if another person comes and wants to drink 6 liters of water, then they will not be able to do so because there is only 5 liters of water left in the container. Therefore, the second person will have to go without drinking any water.
Response:  Sarali has 10 sticks and he gives 2 to his friend. So, Sarali has 8 sticks left. Then, he meets another person who gives him 4 more sticks, so now Sarali has 12 sticks in total. Finally, he gives 3 sticks to someone else, leaving him with 9 sticks. Therefore, the number of sticks Sarali had is 9.
Response:  We know that there are 125 questions in total and we have already answered 4 of them correctly. So, the remaining 121 questions are yet to be answered. Now, let's assume that each correct answer gives us 3 points. Therefore, if we answer all the remaining 121 questions correctly, we will get a total of 363 points (121 x 3 = 363).
Response:  We know that there are 7 rojgaris (workers) in total and each worker has to do 25 tasks. So, the total number of tasks is 7 x 25 = 175. Now, we need to find out how many tasks each worker has to do. Since there are 8 muktas (categories) of work, each worker will have to do 175 / 8 = 21.875 tasks per worker on average. Therefore, the answer is 21.
Response:  We know that there are 22 pairs of teeth in an adult human mouth. Each pair consists of one incisor, one canine, and two molars. Therefore, the total number of teeth in an adult human mouth is 22 x 3 = 66 teeth. Now, we are asked how many teeth would be left if eight teeth were removed from each jaw. To find out, let's assume that the eight teeth removed are four incisors (two from each jaw). Since each jaw has four incisors, removing four teeth from each jaw means that each jaw now has only 20 teeth instead of 24. So, the total number of teeth left after removing eight teeth from each jaw is 20 x 2 = 40 teeth.
Response:  The person is 23 years old and has been working for 7 years in the company. So, their age at the time of joining the company would be 23 + 7 = 30 years old. Now, let's assume that they have been promoted to the position of manager after 5 years of service in the company. Therefore, their current age would be 30 + 5 = 35 years old. As per the information provided, the person's salary as a manager is 1.5 times that of an ordinary employee. So, if an ordinary employee's monthly salary is Rs. 30,000, then the manager's monthly salary would be Rs. 45,000 (1.5 x Rs. 30,000).
Response:  On one occasion, Kiran had an idea to make a machine that could turn any object into gold. He worked hard for months and finally succeeded in creating such a machine. However, he realized that the machine was consuming too much energy and producing harmful radiation. So, he decided to destroy it before anyone else could use it. But just as he was about to destroy it, his friend appeared and asked him not to do so. The friend explained that the machine could be used for good purposes if handled properly. Kiran was surprised but happy to hear this and agreed to keep the machine safe. From then on, whenever someone asked him about the machine, he would tell them the truth and explain how it works. Now, let us calculate the number of times Kiran told the truth about the machine:  Based on the story, we know that Kiran first mentioned the machine to his friend after he had already created it and destroyed it once. Therefore, there are two instances where Kiran told the truth about the machine: 1. When he explained to his friend why he wanted to destroy the machine 2. When he agreed to keep the machine safe with his friend After these two instances, there is no further mention of Kiran telling others about the machine, so the total number of times he told the truth about it is 2.
Response:  The person has been working for 5 years and earned $600 per month. In total, they have earned $30,000 ($600 x 5 years). Now, let's calculate how much money they will get as an annual bonus based on their salary increase of 10%. If we multiply the total amount earned by 10%, we get $3,000 (($30,000 x 10%) / 12). So, the person will receive an additional $3,000 as an annual bonus.

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 75 parrots in total and out of them, 1/4 (or 18) parrots are female. So, the number of male parrots is 75 - 18 = 57. Now, each parrot costs $2, so the total cost of all male parrots is 57 x $2 = $114. Therefore, the answer is $114.
Response:  If there are 10 students in a class and each student has to give an examination, then the total number of exams will be 10 x 1 = 10. Now, if we assume that each exam takes 3 hours to complete, then the total time required for all the exams will be 10 x 3 = 30 hours. So, the teacher can give 5 exams in 30 hours (5/30). Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If we take out 10 coins from a pile of 50 coins, then there will be 40 coins left in the pile. Now, if we take out another 10 coins from the remaining 40 coins, then there will be 30 coins left. Continuing this process, if we take out 10 coins each time from the remaining coins, then after taking out 10 coins for the 9th time, there will be only 1 coin left in the pile. So, the number of coins left in the pile after taking out 10 coins 9 times is 1.
Response:  We have 4 children - Emily, Jack, Sarah, and James.  Of these, Jack has 5 toys, Sarah has 2 toys, and James has 10 toys. So, in total, there are 17 toys among them. Now, let's see how many toys each child has.  Emily has 3 toys (not including the 5 toys of Jack).  Jack has 5 toys.  Sarah has 2 toys.  And James has 10 toys. Therefore, the number of toys that Emily has is 3 - 5 = -2 toys.
Response:  Jerry has 400 medallions and he wants to distribute them equally among 38 vinaders. So, each vinader will get 10 medallions (400/38 = 10). Now, let's see how much Jerry will lose if he gives away 10 medallions to each of these vinaders. If Jerry had 400 medallions initially and gave away 10 medallions to each of 38 vinaders, then his remaining medallions would be 400 - (38 x 10) = 400 - 380 = 20 medallions. Therefore, Jerry will lose 20 medallions in total.
Response:  We have 12 different types of animals in the picture, and each animal has 5 puppies. So, there are 12 x 5 = 60 puppies in total. Now, if we assume that every puppy grows at the same rate, then after 60 days (or 2 months), all the puppies will be fully grown, with their height increasing by 1/3 every day. Therefore, the height of each puppy after 60 days will be: Height = 60 / 3 = 20 inches.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students, 160 are boys and 40 are girls. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of friends each student has. Since there are 2/5 boys and 2/3 girls in the class, the number of pairs of friends for each boy is 2/5 x 160 = 80, and the number of pairs of friends for each girl is 2/3 x 40 = 67. So, in total, there are 80 + 67 = 147 pairs of friends in the class.
Response:  Harish had Rs. 900 with him at 9 am in the morning and gave Rs. 600 to James. So, Harish has Rs. 300 left with him. Now, if he spends Rs. 200 of that amount on something, he will be left with Rs. 100. Therefore, the answer is (C) Rs. 100.
Response:  We know that there are 16 dominoes in each set and Freda has 32 sets of dominoes. So, the total number of dominoes Freda has is 32 x 16 = 512 dominoes.
Response:  Firstly, there are 30 cars in Neerisalai and 15 of them are old models. So, out of these 30 cars, only 15 can be sold through auction. Now, let's assume that each old model car has an average value of Rs. 50,000. Therefore, the total value of all the old model cars is (15 x Rs. 50,000) = Rs. 750,000. However, since some of these cars may not be in good condition, their actual selling price may be lower than their estimated value. Let's assume that the average selling price of these old model cars is Rs. 40,000. Therefore, the total amount of money that can be earned from selling these old model cars through auction is (Rs. 750,000 x Rs. 40,000) = Rs. 30,00,000.
"Response:  If there are 18 different types of toys in the store and each type has 50 pieces, then the total number of toys in the store is:

So, Meera has 900 toys in her collection."
Response:  Jerome has 4 apples and gives one to each of his 3 friends. So, he now has 4 - 3 = 1 apple left.  Now, if he wants to give half of what he has (i.e., 1 apple) to his friend John, then he will have 1 - 1/4 = 75% of what he had earlier, i.e., 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 apples left. Therefore, Jerome has 0.25 apples left after giving half of what he had to John.
Response:  Solomon has 4 questions in philosophy, 20 questions in psychology, and 7 questions in logic. He also has 8 questions in ethics. Therefore, he has a total of 39 questions to ask. However, he can only ask one question per day for 4 days. So, he will be able to ask 4 questions in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that ஜான் (Jaan) is a person who has to go for work at 6 AM every day and returns home at 7 PM. He has to take care of his family including his wife and children. Now let's assume he has only one pair of clothes which he uses throughout the week without washing or changing it. So, after one week, his clothes would be smelling bad and unclean. To overcome this problem, Jaan decides to buy another pair of clothes to change daily. But then he realizes that he doesn't have enough money to afford it. Therefore, he comes up with an idea to sell some of his old belongings like books, CDs, and other unnecessary items online to generate some income. By doing so, he can earn around Rs. 500-1000 per month, which is sufficient for him to buy another pair of clothes and maintain his personal hygiene. Hence, the answer is 500-1000 Rupees.
Response:  The city has 3 million residents and each resident consumes 10 kg of food per month. So, the total amount of food consumed in the city is 3 million x 10 kg = 30 million kg per month. Now, let's calculate how much space (in square kilometers) this food takes up. We know that 1 kilogram of food requires 0.067 cubic meters of space (assuming an average density of 1 g/cm^3). Therefore, the total volume of food consumed in the city is 30 million kg / 0.067 m^3 = 450 million cubic meters per month. Finally, we can convert this volume to area by multiplying it by the conversion factor of 10^6 (since there are 10^6 cubic meters in 1 square kilometer): 450 million cubic meters x 10^6 = 4.5 billion square meters per month. So, the answer is 4.5 billion square meters.
Response:  Babi has 1000 balls and he wants to divide them equally among his 5 friends. So, each friend will get 200 balls (1000 / 5 = 200). Now, Avanti is also there who wants to take one ball from each of Babi's friends. If she takes one ball from each of the 5 friends, then she will get 5 balls in total (5 x 200 = 1000). Therefore, the final answer is 1000.
Response:  If there are 5 kuggi (coins) in total and each coin has a diameter of 1 cm, then the area of one coin is π x 1^2 = 1 square unit. Therefore, the total area of all 5 coins is 5 x 1 = 5 square units. Now, if we want to know how many full circles can fit inside these 5 coins, we need to divide the total area of the coins by the area of one circle. The area of one circle is π x radius^2, where radius is half the diameter. So, for a radius of 0.5 cm (half the diameter), the area of one circle is π x (0.5)^2 = 0.7854 square units. Since there are 5 coins in total, we can fit 5 / 0.7854 = approximately 6.5 full circles inside them.
Response:  We know that there are three bags and each bag contains an odd number of marbles. So, the total number of marbles in all three bags is 3 x 7 = 21. Now, we need to find out how many marbles are in each bag. Since there are 6 marbles in the first bag, 4 marbles in the second bag, and 5 marbles in the third bag, we can write: Bag 1 : 6 marbles Bag 2 : 4 marbles Bag 3 : 5 marbles Total number of marbles = Bag 1 + Bag 2 + Bag 3 = 6 + 4 + 5 = 15 Therefore, the remaining marble (which is 6) must be in Bag 3.
Response:  On Friday ( Puku), he will have 30 minutes of break time in the morning and evening respectively. So, he can spend 15 minutes each for 2 times during the day. Therefore, he can watch 2 x 15 = 30 episodes of TV show.
Response:  Henrik has 15 kukkis in his pocket and he gives 5 of them to his friend. So now Henrik has 10 kukkis left (15 - 5 = 10). Now, if Henrik wants to give 110 kukkis to his friend, he will have to take 100 kukkis from his own pouch and give it to his friend (110 - 10 = 100). Therefore, Henrik has 100 kukkis in his pouch after giving 110 kukkis to his friend.
Response:  The cost of one petrol can is $3.00 and there are 10 cans in total. So, the total cost of all ten cans would be $3 x 10 = $30. Now, if we buy 5 cans at once, then we will get a discount of $20 (which is 66% of the original price). So, the remaining amount that we have to pay for 5 cans would be $30 - $20 = $10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 365 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we calculate the total number of hours in a year, it would be 365 x 24 = 8760 hours. Now, let's consider how many hours Mr. X spends on his work every day. According to him, he works for 8 hours a day, so he spends 8 x 365 = 2970 hours working per year. Next, let's calculate the number of hours Mr. Y spends on his hobby every month. He said that he spends 1 hour per day on his hobby, which means he spends 1 x 30 = 30 hours per month. Therefore, the total number of hours Mr. Y spends on his hobby in a year is 30 x 12 = 360 hours. Finally, let's calculate the difference between the total number of hours Mr. X spends on his work and Mr. Y spends on his hobby. The difference is 2970 - 360 = 2610 hours. So, Mr. X spends more hours on his work than Mr. Y spends on his hobby.
Response:  Juliana has 64 vinegar bottles in her house. Each bottle contains 1/4 cup of vinegar. So, the total amount of vinegar in all the bottles is 64 x 1/4 = 16 cups. Now, let's calculate how much water each bottle contains. Since each bottle contains 1/4 cup of vinegar and 3/4 cup of water, we can find out the volume of water in each bottle as follows: Volume of water = Total volume of vinegar / (Total volume of vinegar + Water) = 16 cups / (16 cups + 16 cups / 4) = 8 cups per bottle. Therefore, there are 8 cups of water in each of Juliana's 64 vinegar bottles.
Response:  We have 4 artists who can paint for 1 month each. So in total, we have 4 x 1 = 4 months of painting time available. Now, there are 3 colors (red, blue, and green) that can be used to paint the wall. Each color requires 3 days to dry completely. Therefore, the maximum number of days that an artist can work on painting the wall is: 4 months \* 3 colors = 12 days.
Response:  Ryan has 20 days to spend his vacation in India. He wants to visit 3 places and each place takes him 5 days. So, he will have enough time to visit only 2 places. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  Jamaline has 6 months to complete his task of collecting 50 pieces of evidence from the crime scene. He can collect one piece of evidence every day for 6 days, and then he will have 5 extra days to collect any remaining evidence. Therefore, in total, Jamaline can collect 6 x 7 = 42 pieces of evidence. However, since there are already 1800 pieces of evidence collected at the crime scene, Jamaline cannot collect all of them. So, the number of pieces of evidence that Jamaline can collect is 42 - 1800 = -1798.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 10 dollars can be divided into 4 equal parts and then multiply it with the number of boxes. So, we need to divide 10 dollars by 4.  Since there are 10 boxes in total, each box will contain 4/10 = 0.4 dollars worth of goods. Now, let's calculate the total value of all the boxes together. There are 4 boxes in each row, so the total number of rows is 4 x 10 = 40 rows. Each row contains 4 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 40 x 4 = 160 boxes. Therefore, the total value of all the boxes together is 160 x 0.4 = 64 dollars.
"Response:  If we have to find out how many times the word ""கேட்டி"" appears in the text, we can count it as follows:

1. The first occurrence of ""கேட்டி"" is at line 7, column 3. So, the number of appearances of ""கேட்டி"" until this point is 1.
2. The next occurrence of ""கேட்டி"" is at line 8, column 4. So, the number of appearances of ""கேட்டி"" until this point is 2.
3. Similarly, we can continue counting the occurrences of ""கேட்டி"" until the end of the text. Therefore, the total number of appearances of ""கேட்டி"" in the given text is 7 (i.e., 1 + 2 +... + 7).

Response:  Adrian invested $15,000 in Liam's business and earned $40,000 as profit. Now, he wants to invest more money in Liam's business. The percentage of profit that Adrian will get after investing additional $25,000 is 40%. So, if Adrian invests $25,000 more in Liam's business, he will earn $40,000 x 40% = $16,000 as profit. Therefore, the total amount of profit that Adrian will make from both his initial investment of $15,000 and the additional investment of $25,000 is $15,000 + $16,000 = $31,000.
Response:  The man has 2 bags of rice each weighing 50 kg. Therefore, he has a total of 100 kg of rice (2 x 50 kg). Now, if he wants to distribute it equally among 30 people, each person will get 3.33 kg of rice (100 kg / 30 people).
Response:  Moriset has 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, in total he has 13 fruits (5 + 8). Now, let's consider how many times each fruit is repeated. For apples, it is repeated once, so there are 5 apples altogether. Similarly, for oranges, it is repeated twice, so there are 8 oranges altogether. Therefore, the number of fruits that Moriset has is 5 apples and 8 oranges, which means he has a total of 13 fruits.
Response:  The girl is 16 years old and has been working for 4 months. In total, she has earned $800. Now, let's calculate how much money she can save each month. Since she works for 2 months in every 3 months, she earns $800 / 3 = $266.67 per month. So, she saves $266.67 per month.
Response:  Rosie has 10 baskets of apples and she gives 3 baskets to her friend. So, now Rosie has 7 baskets of apples left. Now, if Rosie wants to give some more apples to her friend, how many baskets will she have after giving 7 baskets?  Therefore, the answer is 7 baskets.
Response:  Jenny has 60 days to complete her work in the company. If she works for 8 hours a day, then she will have worked for a total of 720 hours (60 days x 8 hours/day). Now, if we assume that she completes 30 projects in those 720 hours, then each project took her approximately 24 hours to complete (30 projects / 720 hours = 1 hour per project). So, the answer is 1 hour.
Response:  Juliana has 5 puppies and each puppy costs $300. So, in total, she spends $1500 on buying the puppies. Now, let's see how much money she saves after selling them. She sold 4 of the puppies for $600 each, so she earned a total of $2400 from selling those puppies. After subtracting the cost of buying the puppies ($1500), she made a profit of $900. Therefore, the answer is 900.
Response:  The man has 38 cotton towels and 6 microfiber towels. He wants to put them in his suitcase. How many towels can he fit in his suitcase?  We know that each cotton towel takes up more space than each microfiber towel because they are larger in size. So, we will use the volume of each towel to calculate how many towels the man can fit in his suitcase.  The volume of a cotton towel is approximately 0.25 cubic feet (based on an average size). Therefore, the man can fit 154 cotton towels (38 x 0.25) in his suitcase. Similarly, the volume of a microfiber towel is approximately 0.125 cubic feet (based on an average size). Therefore, the man can fit 9 microfiber towels (6 x 0.125) in his suitcase. In total, the man can fit 163 towels (154 cotton + 9 microfiber) in his suitcase.
Response:  If there are 20 people in the first group and each person has brought 50 friends, then the total number of people who have come to the party is: 20 x 50 = 1000 people. So, out of these 1000 people, 50 will be the ones who did not bring any friends, which means they came alone. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 50.
Response:  We have to find out how much money each person will get after selling their items and then calculate how much money they will have left after paying for the trip.  The total amount of money that can be earned from selling the items is $80 (5 milk bottles x $16 = $80).  Since there are 4 people in the group, each person will get $20 ($80 / 4 = $20) from selling their items.  Now, let's see how much money each person has left after paying for the trip.  If each person pays $50 for the trip, then they will have $50 - $20 = $30 left after paying for the trip. So, the answer is $30.
Response:  The number of doctors is 500 and they are going to perform surgeries for 24 hours non-stop. So, the total number of surgeries that can be performed in one day is:  Number of doctors x Total time spent on surgery = 500 x 24 = 12,000 surgeries per day Now, let's calculate how much money each doctor will make from these surgeries: Total amount earned by all doctors = Number of surgeries x Amount earned per surgery = 12,000 x $150 = $180,000 per day Now, let's calculate how much money each nurse will make from these surgeries: Total amount earned by all nurses = Number of surgeries x Amount earned per surgery = 12,000 x $200 = $240,000 per day Therefore, the total amount of money earned by both doctors and nurses from these surgeries is: $180,000 + $240,000 = $420,000 per day
Response:  The number of students who are studying in class 6th is 60.  Out of them, 10 students have their birthdays in January, February and March. So, the number of students whose birthday falls between January to March is 10 x 3 = 30. Therefore, there are 60 - 30 = 30 students whose birthday does not fall between January to March.
Response:  In May (June month), Joshua had $500 and spent $60 on something. So, his remaining amount of money in June would be $500 - $60 = $440.
Response:  Firstly, there are two people - Ramesh and Ramya. They have to carry six heavy boxes of different sizes from one room to another through a narrow corridor with a width of 1 meter only. The distance between the rooms is 5 meters. Now, let's calculate the time taken for each person to move one box.  For Ramesh, it will take him 3 seconds to move one box because he has to walk 0.5 meters (distance between the starting point and the midpoint) in 2 seconds, and then 0.5 meters again in the remaining 1 second. Therefore, his total time = 3 seconds. Similarly, for Ramya, her total time = 3 seconds as well. So, they both take equal time to move one box.  Next, we need to find out how many times they can move the boxes per minute. To do this, we divide the total time by 60 (since there are 6 boxes). For Ramesh, his time per box = 3/60 = 0.05 minutes. For Ramya, hers is also 0.05 minutes.  Finally, we multiply their time per box by the number of boxes they can move per minute to get the total time taken to move all the boxes. For Ramesh, it's 0.05 x 6 = 3 minutes. For Ramya, it's also 3 minutes.  So, both Ramesh and Ramya take exactly the same amount of time to move all the boxes, which is 3 minutes.
Response:  Thiruvallikkeni is 30 years old and has 4 milk teeth. He lost his first tooth at the age of 5. So he had 30 - 5 = 25 milk teeth when he lost his first tooth. Now, he has 25 + 6 (the number of months it took for him to lose his second tooth) = 31 milk teeth now. Therefore, Thiruvallikkeni has 31 milk teeth now.
Response:  We know that there are 4 cars and each car costs $15. So, in total, we have: 4 x $15 = $60. Now, we need to find out how much money Mr. Tom has after selling all four cars. Therefore, we subtract the cost of the cars from the total amount he received: $60 - $24 (cost of 4 cars) = $36. So, Mr. Tom has $36 left after selling all four cars.
Response:  If Brahmin has 20 houses and he gives 5 of them to his son, then the number of houses left with him is 20 - 5 = 15. Now, if he gives 3 more houses to his daughter-in-law, then the number of houses left with him is 15 - 3 = 12. So, Brahmin has 12 houses left after giving 5 to his son and 3 to his daughter-in-law.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 countries in the world with a coastline. Now, let's consider each country and its coastline length separately. For example, India has a coastline of approximately 7500 km. Similarly, China has a coastline of around 14500 km. Therefore, if we add up all these lengths, we get a total coastline length of approximately 36000 km (27 x 7500). However, this is not the correct answer as some of these countries have multiple coastlines or irregular shapes, which would result in overlapping areas. To account for this, we need to divide the total coastline length by the number of unique coastlines present. Based on our research, there are approximately 10-15 unique coastlines present in the world. So, dividing the total coastline length by this number gives us an approximate value of around 3600 km per unique coastline (36000 / 10-15 = 3600).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total cost of the two sweaters is $7.50 and the total cost of the four t-shirts is $1.50 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $3.50. So, the total amount paid by her is $7.50 + $3.50 = $11.00. Now, if she gets a discount of 20%, then the amount she pays after applying the discount will be $11.00 x (1 - 0.20) = $8.40. Therefore, the value of the voucher is $8.40 - $5.00 = $3.40.
Response:  If he has 75 marbles in his pocket initially and loses 5 of them, then he will have 70 marbles left. Now, if he wins 100 marbles from someone else, he will have a total of 170 marbles (70 + 100). So, the difference between the number of marbles he had before and after winning is 100 - 70 = 30 marbles. Therefore, the correct answer is 30.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 12 can divide into 22 without leaving any remainder.  So, we need to divide 22 by 12 exactly 1 time. Therefore, there are no remainders and hence the answer is 0.
Response:  We have 20 cars in total, and we want to know how many are from Tata Motors. So, the number of Tata Motors cars is 20 / 5 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 Tata Motors cars among the 12 Maruti Suzuki cars, 4 Hyundai cars, and 4 Kia cars.
Response:  We have 700 boxes of chocolates and we want to pack them in cartons of 30 pieces each. So, we need to divide 700 by 30 = 23 cartons. Therefore, there are 23 cartons of chocolates that can be packed using the given information.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Joey has to spend $10 for each of the two months he is staying at the hotel. So, the total amount he needs to pay is $20 ( $10 x 2 months). Now, we are told that Joey earns $3 per hour and works for 5 hours a day. Therefore, his daily income is $3 x 5 = $15. Since Joey stays at the hotel for 2 months, he can save $15 x 2 = $30. Hence, the difference between what Joey spends and what he saves is $70 ($20 - $30).
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of all the items mentioned in the question.  The cost of 2 pairs of jeans is $30, and the cost of 3 t-shirts is $20. So, the total cost of these two items is $50 ($30 x 2). Similarly, the cost of 3 hoodies is $60, and the cost of 3 pairs of socks is $20. Therefore, the total cost of these four items is $130 ($60 + $20 + $20 + $60). Now, let's find out what percentage of the total cost each item represents. For example, the cost of 2 pairs of jeans is $30 / $130 = 23%. Similarly, the cost of 3 t-shirts is $20 / $130 = 15%, and the cost of 3 hoodies is $60 / $130 = 46%. Finally, let's calculate the discount amount based on the percentage of the total cost that each item represents. For instance, if the discount is 10%, then for every $10 spent on an item, the customer will get a $1 discount. So, if the total cost of the items is $130, and the customer spends $100 on one pair of jeans, they will get a $10 discount (10% of $100). Therefore, the final price of the jeans will be $90 ($100 - $10). Similarly, if the customer spends $70 on three t-shirts, they will get a $7 discount (10% of $70), and the final price of the t-shirts will be $63 ($70 - $7).
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many employees are there in each department.  There are 3 departments - Marketing, Sales and Production.  In total, there are 10 employees working in these departments. Now, let's calculate the number of employees in each department separately:
Marketing Department: 4 employees
Sales Department: 6 employees
Production Department: 1 employee
Now, let's find out how much salary each employee in each department is paid per month:
Marketing Department: ₹ 8,000 x 4 = ₹ 32,000
Sales Department: ₹ 7,000 x 6 = ₹ 42,000
Production Department: ₹ 5,000 x 1 = ₹ 5,000
So, the total amount of money spent on salaries for all employees in all three departments comes to:
₹ 32,000 + ₹ 42,000 + ₹ 5,000 = ₹ 79,000
Therefore, the answer to the question ""How much money does the company spend on salaries for its employees?"" is ₹ 79,000."
Response:  We know that there are 10 hectares of land and 100 acres of land.  If we divide the number of acres by the number of hectares, we get the ratio of acres to hectares as follows:  $\frac{100}{10} = 10$. So, for every $1$ hectare of land, there are $10$ acres of land.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the number 500 appears in the given sequence of numbers. We can see that the number 500 appears exactly three times in the sequence - at positions 1, 2 and 3. So, the total number of times the number 500 appears in the sequence is 3. Now, let's consider the remaining numbers after removing the first three occurrences of 500. There are 400 such numbers (i.e., the numbers from position 4 to position 400). Finally, there are 100 numbers left after removing all the other numbers (i.e., the numbers from position 401 to position 500). Therefore, the total number of numbers that remain after removing all the instances of 500 is 100.
Response:  Firstly, she has 30 eggs in her basket at first. She takes out one egg and breaks it, so now there are 29 eggs left. Then, she takes out another egg and breaks it, leaving 28 eggs behind. This process continues until all the eggs are broken. Therefore, the number of eggs that Teera broke is 29 + 28 = 57 eggs.
Response:  The father has 12 dollars and wants to share it equally among his two children. So each child will get $6. Now, the mother has 10 dollars and wants to give it to her daughter. Since the daughter is older than the son, she should get more money. Therefore, the mother will give $7 to the daughter and $3 to the son.  Hence, the final distribution of money is: Father - $12, Mother - $10, Daughter - $7, Son - $3.
"Response:  If there are 12 people in Jesus' group and each person has to bring 30 friends, then the total number of people who will come to Jesus is:

"Response:  Firstly, we know that ஸ்டீவ் (Steve) has a guitar with him and he wants to play it in front of டிம் (Tim). So, Steve has his guitar with him. Now, Tim is interested in buying the guitar from Steve for $440. But before making any deal, Tim wants to check whether the guitar is in good condition or not. Therefore, Tim asks Steve about the number of miles the guitar has been used and how many times it has been played.  Based on Steve's response, Tim decides whether to buy the guitar or not. If the guitar has been used for only 3 miles and has been played only 440 times, then it is considered to be in good condition, and Tim might decide to buy it. However, if the guitar has been used for more than 3 miles or has been played more than 440 times, then it may not be in good condition, and Tim might reject it.  In this case, the answer to the question ""How much will Tim pay for the guitar?"" is $440."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 students in Shantha's class and out of them, 5 students got injured during the accident. So, the probability of any particular student getting injured is $\frac{5}{25}$. Now, among these 5 injured students, 3 were from Muskaan's group. Therefore, the probability of any particular student from Muskaan's group getting injured is $\frac{3}{5}$. Finally, since one person was injured in the accident, the probability of any particular person getting injured is $\frac{1}{40}$. So, the answer is $\frac{1}{40}$.
Response:  The weight of one egg is approximately 50 grams. So, if we have 10 eggs, their total weight would be 10 x 50 = 500 grams. Now, let's convert this weight to dollars. According to the given information, $0.10 per gram means that each gram costs $0.10. Therefore, the cost of 500 grams (which is the weight of 10 eggs) would be $50 (500 x $0.10).

Response:  The question is asking about how many months of salary can be saved if a person spends Rs. 1000 per day and earns an average monthly salary of Rs. 50,000.  To calculate this, we need to divide the daily expenditure (Rs. 1000) by the average monthly salary (Rs. 50,000). This gives us a percentage of savings, which is 2%. So, in one year, the person will save approximately 2% of their annual salary, which is Rs. 1000 x 12 = Rs. 12,000. Therefore, the answer is 12,000.
Response:  We know that Bil has 300 rolls of 120 sheets each, and he uses 60 sheets for each of his 5 friends. So, in total, he gives away 60 x 5 = 300 sheets. Now, we need to find out how many sheets are left with him after giving them away. Since each sheet costs 4 angulams, Bil spends a total of 300 x 4 = 1200 angulams on buying sheets for his friends. Therefore, he is left with 300 - 1200 = -900 angulams.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days in each category.  For Kurangugu, there are 200 days. For Gurugu, there are 400 days. And for Babiyan, there are 100 days. Therefore, the total number of days is: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 days. Now, let's find out how many times the artist can perform per day. If the artist performs every day, then the number of performances is equal to the total number of days divided by the number of days in each category. In this case, the number of performances is: 700 days / 3 categories = 233.33 performances per day. So, the artist can perform approximately 233.33 times per day.
Response:  The man has $15 in his pocket and gives $10 to his friend. So he has $5 left. Then, he buys an ice cream for $2 and pays with a $5 bill. Now he has $3 left. After that, he spends $8 on a toy and pays with a $3 bill. Now he has $5 left again. Finally, he gives $4 to his mother and has nothing left. Therefore, the total amount of money the man spent is $8 + $2 = $10.
Response:  Rabbit has 4 babies and each baby weighs 1.5 kg. So, total weight of all babies is 6 kg (4 x 1.5 = 6). Now, there are 2 kittens that weigh 4 kg each, so total weight of kittens is 8 kg (2 x 4 = 8). And finally, there is one big cat that weighs 20 kg. Therefore, total weight of all animals in the picture is 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 kg.
Response:  If there are 11 people in a room and each person has to give 50 rupees for a common fund, then the total amount collected will be 11 x 50 = 550 rupees. Now, if 3 of them have to share the money equally among themselves, then they will get 550 / 3 = 183 rupees each. So, the remaining 7 people will get 550 - (183 x 3) = 467 rupees each.
Response:  We know that there are 17 pots of water in total and each pot contains 7 adis (units) of water. So, the total number of adis of water is 17 x 7 = 119 adis. Now, we need to find out how many adis of water are left after Puppala pours some water from one pot into another. According to the problem statement, Puppala poured 3 adis of water from one pot into another, so the remaining amount of water in the first pot is 119 - 3 = 116 adis. Therefore, the answer is 116 adis.

Laxus Ing has taken 5 of Anakin's lightsabers, 3 of his kyber crystals, and 2 of his force-fueled weapons. So, the total number of items that Laxus Ing took from Anakin is: 10 (lightsabers) + 3 (kyber crystals) + 2 (force-fueled weapons) = 15.
Response:  If there are 20 dalals in one paisa, and each dalal is worth 20% of its original value, then after 36 months, the value of one dalal will be reduced to half of its original value. So, if we have $1 = 20 dalals initially, after 36 months, $1 = 10 dalls (half of the original value). Therefore, the number of dalals required to buy $1 after 36 months is 5 (since $1 / 0.5 = 5 dalals).
Response:  We have 5 big rocks and 3 small rocks in one pile, and 1 small rock in another pile. If we add all these rocks together, we get a total of 9 rocks. So, the answer is 9.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jaguar has three models - XE, XF and F-Pace. Each model has different prices as follows: XE - $35,000; XF - $45,000; F-Pace - $48,000. Now, let's calculate how much money Jaguar makes from each car sale: XE - $35,000 x 10 = $350,000; XF - $45,000 x 20 = $900,000; F-Pace - $48,000 x 30 = $1,440,000. Therefore, Jaguar makes a total of $3,690,000 from all three models combined."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the girl is 30 years old and has 1500 rupees in her purse. She wants to buy something worth 1090 rupees from the market. So she needs 301 rupees more to complete the purchase. Now, there are 157 rupees left after buying the item, which means she spent 833 rupees for the item (1090 - 157 = 833). Moreover, there are 74 rupees left after paying for the item, which means she paid 767 rupees for the item (833 - 74 = 767). Finally, there are 102 rupees left after paying for both items, which means she spent 988 rupees for both items (1090 - 74 = 988). Therefore, the total amount of money she spent on the two items is 988 rupees.
Response:  Santhraavu has 9 sons and each son has 3 daughters. So, in total, Santhraavu has 27 grandchildren (9 sons x 3 daughters per son = 27). Now, let's consider the age of Santhraavu at the time of his death. According to the question, he was 80 years old when he died, which means that he was born 80 - 3 = 77 years ago. Therefore, the age of Santhraavu at the time of his death is 77 years.

Therefore, the total number of days in a year is: 365 days (non-leap year) or 366 days (leap year).
Response:  We know that there are four cabooses in total and each has a different age. The youngest caboose is 32 years old, and the oldest caboose is 60 years old. So, the average age of all the cabooses is (60 + 32) / 4 = 45 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Avatar's monthly income is $300 and his expenses are $200 per month. So, he has a savings of $100 per month ($300 - $200). Now, if Jesika reduces his taxes by 50%, then Avatar will have to pay $50 less in taxes every month. Therefore, his new monthly savings would be $150 ($100 + $50).
Response:  If Bilali has 60 urulaikkirizhagam (urulaikkiri = 10), he will have to give 5 of them as gifts. So, he will be left with 54 urulaikkirizhagams. Now, let's calculate how many times he can repeat this process. He can repeat it for 5 years, since each year he gets 5 new urulaikkirikizhagams. Therefore, he can give away 25 urulaikkirikizhagams in total (5 x 5 = 25).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three people - Juvan, Avran and Leman. Each of them has to pay $0.50 for their meal. So, the total amount paid by all three is $1.50. Now, each person gets $0.50 as change from the restaurant owner after buying their meals. Therefore, the total amount received by each person is $2 ( $1.50 + $0.50). Since there are two types of currency used in this scenario, i.e., dollars and cents, we need to convert the amount received by each person into dollars. To do so, we divide the amount received by 100, since there are 100 cents in one dollar. Thus, the total amount received by each person in dollars is $2 / 100 = $0.02. Therefore, the final answer is $0.02.
Response:  If there are 60 people in Shanmugam's team and each person has an average of 2 family members, then the total number of family members would be 60 x 2 = 120.
Response:  Firstly, he has Rs. 1 lakh in his savings account and wants to invest it wisely. He has identified three options for investment - gold coins, real estate, and stock market.  For each option, we need to calculate the expected return based on historical data or expert opinions.  Option 1 (Gold Coins): Historical returns of gold coins have been around 8-10% per annum over the long term. So, if he invests Rs. 1 lakh in gold coins, he can expect a return of around Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 10,000 per year (assuming an average return of 9% per annum). Option 2 (Real Estate): Real estate investments typically offer higher returns than other asset classes, but they also come with higher risks. Assuming he invests Rs. 1 lakh in a property that appreciates at a rate of 5% per annum, he could expect a return of around Rs. 60,000 per year (based on a total appreciation of 50%). Option 3 (Stock Market): The stock market offers potentially higher returns than other asset classes, but they are also more volatile. Assuming he invests Rs. 1 lakh in a diversified portfolio of stocks that generates an average annual return of 12%, he could expect a return of around Rs. 12,000 per year (based on a total value of Rs. 1.2 million after one year). Based on these calculations, the best option for him would be to invest in the stock market, as it offers the highest potential returns among the three options. However, it is important to note that past performance does not guarantee future results, and there are no guarantees in investing. Therefore, it is essential to consult with financial experts before making any investment decisions.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 4 can divide 10 and give remainders. So, we need to calculate (10 / 4) = 2 with a remainder of 0. Then, we need to repeat this calculation for the next four numbers after 4, i.e., (18 / 4) = 4 with a remainder of 4, (26 / 4) = 6 with a remainder of 2, (34 / 4) = 8 with a remainder of 4, and (42 / 4) = 10 with a remainder of 2. Therefore, there are 5 remainders when dividing 10 by 4, which is equal to 5 x 4 = 20.
Response:  The first person gave $10 to the second person and received back $8 after one year. So, there is a loss of $2 ($10 - $8). Now, in the next year, the second person gives $8 to the third person and receives back $10 after one year. So, there is a gain of $2 ($10 - $8). Therefore, the total amount gained or lost by the two persons together is $4 ($2 + $2).
Response:  If there are 100 people in Sarayi's house and each person has to pay Rs. 50 as rent, then the total amount of rent that needs to be paid is 100 x Rs. 50 = Rs. 5000. Now, if 3/4 of them can pay their rent on time, then the number of people who cannot pay their rent on time is (100 - 3/4) x 40 = 20. So, the number of people who have overdue rent is 20.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times Sivapuja Rajakumar has been invited for pujas in his lifetime. According to the question, he has been invited for 200 pujas so far. Now, let's calculate how many times he will be invited for pujas if he lives for another 5 months. Since each month has got 30 days, the total number of days in 5 months is 150 days (5 x 30 = 150). Therefore, the total number of invitations he will receive in his lifetime is 200 + 150 = 350. So, the answer is 350.
Response:  According to the question, Jenny is 28 years old and has 5 siblings. So, her age minus her sibling's ages will give us the number of children she has.  Jenny's age - (sibling1 age + sibling2 age +... + sibling5 age) = 28 - (30 + 32 + 34 + 36 + 38) = -6. Therefore, Jenny has 6 children.
Response:  We have 400 meters race and there are 12 runners in total. Each runner has to complete the race alone without any help from others. The first runner completes the race in 40 seconds, and each subsequent runner takes 3 seconds more than the previous one to complete the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the last runner to complete the race is 40 + (3 x 11) = 55 seconds. So, the total time taken by all the 12 runners to complete the race is 40 + (3 x 11) = 55 seconds.
Response:  Jerry has 3 apples and wants to share them equally among 5 of his friends. So, each friend will get 3/5 = 0.6 apple. Now, let's assume that one apple is equal to 1 point. Therefore, each friend will get 0.6 points from Jerry.
Response:  Jenny has 10 apples in her bag and she wants to share them equally among 5 of her friends. So, each friend will get 2 apples (10/5 = 2). Now, let's assume that there are 20 apples in total. If Jenny shares them equally among 5 friends, then each friend will get 4 apples (20/5 = 4).
Response:  The puzzle states that there are 160 pegs in total and each peg has 3 holes. So, we have 160 x 3 = 480 holes in total. Now, let's assume that each hole can hold one marble. Therefore, we have 480 marbles in total. But then comes the catch - out of these 480 marbles, only 100 marbles are placed in the first 10 cups (which is equal to 10% of the total number of marbles). This means that there are 380 marbles left after placing 100 marbles in the first 10 cups. Now, let's move on to the next part of the puzzle which asks us how many marbles are left in each cup after removing 10 marbles from it. According to the puzzle, if we remove 10 marbles from any cup, then the remaining marbles in that cup will be equal to 90% of the initial number of marbles in that cup. Using this logic, we can calculate the number of marbles left in each cup as follows: Cup 1: Initially, there are 10 marbles in this cup, so after removing 10 marbles, there will be 90% of 10 = 9 marbles left in this cup. Cup 2: Initially, there are 20 marbles in this cup, so after removing 10 marbles, there will be 90% of 20 = 18 marbles left in this cup. And so on... Finally, using the information provided above, we can calculate the number of marbles left in each cup as follows: Cup 1: 9 marbles Cup 2: 18 marbles Cup 3: 27 marbles Cup 4: 36 marbles Cup 5: 45 marbles Cup 6: 54 marbles Cup 7: 63 marbles Cup 8: 72 marbles Cup 9: 81 marbles Cup 10: 90 marbles In conclusion, there are 9 marbles left in the first cup, 18 marbles left in the second cup, 27 marbles left in
Response:  The monthly salary of Mani is Rs. 100, and he gets a 2% raise every year. So after 5 years, his salary will be:  Rs. 100 x (1 + 0.02) ^ 5 = Rs. 136.80 After 10 years, it will be:  Rs. 136.80 x (1 + 0.02) ^ 10 = Rs. 247.96 And so on... Therefore, after 20 years, Mani's salary will be approximately Rs. 1055.64.
Response:  The baker has 20 loaves of bread to sell at $1 each, which means he will make $20 in total. Now, if he gives away 5 loaves for free, he will have 15 loaves left and his earnings will be reduced to $15 (20 - 5 = 15). If he then sells these remaining 15 loaves at $2 each, he will make $30 in total ($15 x 2 = $30). So, the final amount of money the baker makes is $30.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three people who have to share $20.25 equally among themselves. So, each person will get $6.75 ($20.25 / 3). Now, they spend $4.50 each on their own things, so they have $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25 left after buying their personal items. Since there are three of them, each one has $2.25 / 3 = $0.75 left over after buying their personal items. Therefore, none of them have any money left over.
Response:  John has 3 apples and he wants to share them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 0.75 apple (3/4). Now, John has 2 remaining apples, which he can distribute among 2 people. He can give 1 apple to each of them, so they will have 1 apple each. Therefore, the final distribution is:  John - 0.75 apple, Person 1 - 1 apple, Person 2 - 1 apple.
Response:  We have to find out how many times we can divide 3.5 into 10 equal parts.  So, we need to divide 3.5 by 10.  When we divide 3.5 by 10, we get 0.35 as the quotient and 0 remainder. Therefore, there are 35 parts that we can divide from 3.5.
Response:  The person has 10 marbles and gives 2 to another person. So, they have 8 marbles left. Then, they give 50 marbles to 3 people, so they have 43 marbles left (50 - 3 x 8 = 43). Finally, 30% of 43 marbles are taken away, leaving 27 marbles (43 x 30% = 13.2). Therefore, the person has 27 marbles left.
Response:  On Sani Monday (January 20), the astrologer said that there would be an accident involving a truck and a car at around 4 pm. So, let's assume that the time of the accident is indeed 4 pm. Now, we need to calculate how many days have passed since January 1, which is the starting date of the year in Tamil calendar. As per the question, it took 18 days for the accident to happen after January 1. Therefore, if today is February 17 (which is 17 days after January 1), then the accident must have happened on February 3 (which is 18 days after January 1).
Response:  The woman has 5 gold coins and she wants to exchange them for US dollars at a rate of $2 per coin. So, she will get $10 (5 x $2). Now, if she gets $10 more than what she had earlier, then she has gained $10 - $5 = $5. Therefore, her gain is $5.
Response:  We have two pennies and one dime. The value of each penny is $0.01, and the value of the dime is $0.10. So, the total value of these three coins is: Penny x 2 = $0.02 + Dime = $0.10 = $0.12. Therefore, there are 8 pennies in $0.12.
Response:  We have 40 students in a city and each student has to carry 2 bags of rice (50 kg each). So, total weight of rice carried by all students is: 40 x 2 = 80 kg. Now, we know that one bag of rice costs Rs.30 per kilogram. Therefore, total cost of rice carried by all students is: 80 kg x Rs.30/kg = Rs.2400. Now, we are asked whether Killogiram can afford this amount. Based on the information given in the question, Killogiram cannot afford this amount as he only has Rs.1200 with him.
Response:  The population of Soodhagiri is 23786 and there are 8417 males and 9092 females in Soodhagiri. Therefore, the number of children (males + females) in Soodhagiri is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. Since we know that 1/3 of the children are girls, the number of girls in Soodhagiri is 17509 x 1/3 = 5833.

Next, Marge meets Pathologist C and gives him 200 coins. So, now Marge has 300 coins left.
Finally, Marge meets Pathologist D and gives him 100 coins. So, now Marge has 200 coins left.
Therefore, the total number of coins that Marge gave away is 500 + 200 + 100 = 800 coins."
Response:  We know that Balu has 5 hours of work in the morning and 6 hours of work in the evening. So, he works for a total of 11 hours (5 + 6). Now, we need to find out how many liters of water Balu can carry during his work. As per the question, if Balu carries one liter of water for every hour of work, then he will be able to carry a total of 11 liters of water (5 x 2 = 10 + 6 = 11) during his entire work duration. Therefore, the answer is 11 liters.
Response:  The total amount of money that John has is $5000 and he wants to invest it in either option A or B. If he chooses option A, he will get back $4000 after 1 year with an interest rate of 5%. So, his profit from option A would be $4000 x 5% = $200. Now, if he chooses option B, he will get back $3000 after 2 years with an interest rate of 5%. So, his profit from option B would be $3000 x 5% = $150. Therefore, the best choice for John is option A as it gives him a higher profit of $200 compared to option B which gives him a profit of $150.
Response:  The first 10 eggs are divided equally among 3 people, so each person gets 3 eggs.  Since there are 5 people in total, each person will get 5/3 = 1.67 eggs per person. Therefore, the number of eggs left after 3 people have taken 10 eggs is 10 - (3 x 1.67) = 4 eggs. Now, let's consider the second group of 5 people. Each person in this group will also get an equal share of 5 eggs, so they will get 5/5 = 1 egg each. Therefore, the total number of eggs left after both groups have taken their shares is 4 + (5 x 1) = 9 eggs. So, the final answer is 9 eggs.
Response:  The person has to carry 3 heavy stones weighing 10 kg each for 5 km. Then they have to carry another load of 4 heavy stones weighing 5 kg each for another 5 km. Finally, they have to lift one very heavy stone weighing 20 kg and place it atop a hill that is 100 meters high. So in total, the person will be carrying loads weighing 75 kg (3 x 10 kg + 4 x 5 kg + 20 kg) over a distance of 10 km.
Response:  Firstly, we have 22 pairs of shoes and 10 bags. Out of these, 6 pairs of shoes are left and 4 bags are remaining. So, the number of shoes left is 22 - 6 = 16 and the number of bags left is 10 - 4 = 6. Now, let's consider the situation where 2 pairs of shoes are given to each of the 3 friends and 1 bag is given to each of them. In this case, the total number of shoes left will be 16 / 3 = 5 pairs and the total number of bags left will be 6 / 3 = 2 bags. Therefore, the final number of shoes left in the box after giving them away is 5 pairs and the final number of bags left is 2 bags.
Response:  The first set of numbers is 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86. These are the number of times each letter appears in the first 5 words of the text. Now, we need to find out how many times each letter appears in the remaining words. For this, we will use the formula: Number of letters = Total number of letters / Number of words. So, for the second set of numbers, we have: Number of letters = (Total number of letters - Number of letters in the first 5 words) / (Number of words - 5). Substituting the values, we get: Number of letters = (400 - 24) / (10 - 5) = 356. Therefore, the total number of letters in all the words of the text is 356.
Response:  The person has 5 days to complete the work and needs 25 kilograms of rice for each day. Therefore, the total amount of rice needed is 5 x 25 = 125 kilograms.

Response:  Karthik has 1.5 million rupees in his account and he wants to invest it for 6 months with an interest rate of 3%. To calculate how much money he will have after 6 months, we need to use the formula: Principal x Rate x Time = Interest. In this case, the principal is 1.5 million rupees, the rate is 3% (which means 0.03), and the time is 6 months (which means 6/12). So, the interest earned by Karthik will be: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time = 1500000 x 0.03 x 6/12 = 43750. Therefore, after 6 months, Karthik will have 1.5 million rupees + 43750 = 1500000 rupees.
Response:  The number of people who can fit in Dalal Street is 100. Out of them, 50 will leave on the first day. So, the remaining 50 people will be there on the second day.

Response:  We know that there are 4 stages of growth for a plant, and each stage lasts for 3 months. So, in total, it takes 12 months (4 x 3) for a plant to grow from seedling to maturity. Now, let's assume that the plant grows at a rate of 0.5 cm per day during its growing period. Therefore, the total length of the plant after 12 months will be: Total length = Number of days x Growth rate per day = 12 months x 0.5 cm/day = 6 cm Now, we need to find out how many branches the plant has at different stages of growth. According to the question, the plant has 4 main branches at the end of the first year of growth, which is equivalent to 1/4 of the total length of the plant. Therefore, the length of each branch can be calculated as follows: Length of each branch = Total length / Number of branches = 6 cm / 4 = 1.5 cm Now, let's find out how many secondary branches the plant has at each stage of growth. According to the question, the plant has 8 secondary branches at the end of the second year of growth, which is equivalent to 1/8 of the total length of the plant. Therefore, the length of each secondary branch can be calculated as follows: Length of each secondary branch = Total length / Number of secondary branches = 6 cm / 8 = 0.75 cm Finally, let's calculate the total number of leaves on the plant at each stage of growth. According to the question, the plant has 4 leaves at the end of the first year of growth, and each leaf measures 5 cm long. Therefore, the total number of leaves on the plant at the end of the first year can be calculated as follows: Total number of leaves = Number of leaves x Length of each leaf = 4 x 5 cm = 20 cm Now, let's find out how many leaves the plant adds every month. According to the question, the plant adds 2 new leaves every month during its growing period. Therefore, the total number of leaves on the plant at the end of the second year of growth can be calculated as follows: Total number of leaves at end of second year = Total number of leaves at end of first year +
"Response:  Firstly, we know that LoRa is a wireless communication technology that operates at frequencies between 769 MHz and 774 MHz in Europe. So, if we want to transmit data through LoRa, we need to use these frequency bands. Now, let's assume that the distance between the two locations is 320 meters (as mentioned in the question). To calculate the transmission power required for transmitting data over this distance using LoRa, we can use the formula:
Power (dBm) = 10 \* log10 (distance (m)) + 12 \* log10 (frequency (MHz)) - 174
Using the values given in the question, we get:
Power (dBm) = 10 \* log10 (320 m) + 12 \* log10 (769 MHz) - 174 = -50 dBm
So, the transmission power required for transmitting data over a distance of 320 meters using LoRa is approximately -50 dBm."

Response:  We have 4 red balls and 3 blue balls in total. To get 7 white balls, we need to remove 1 ball from each of the 4 red balls. So, there are 4 red balls with 1 less ball each, which means there is 1 fewer red ball than before. Therefore, the number of red balls left after removing one ball from each of them is 3.
Response:  Harish has 30 years of experience and is currently 50 years old. He will retire at the age of 60. So he has 6 years left to work. If he works for 8 hours a day, then in one year, he will have worked for 240 days (8 hours/day x 365 days/year). Therefore, he has worked for a total of 15,300 hours during his entire working life (240 days x 8 hours/day). Now, let's calculate how much money he has earned based on his salary per hour. According to the question, his monthly salary is $10,000, which means he earns $10,000 / 8 hours = $1,250 per hour. Therefore, Harish has earned a total of $15,300 x 1,250 = $19,075,000 during his entire working life.

Response:  Karthik has 10 cups of coffee and Sudhakar has 5 cups of tea. In total, they have 13 cups of beverages (10 + 5). Now, let's assume that each cup of coffee is equal to 2 cups of tea. Therefore, the number of cups of tea consumed by Sudhakar is 13 x 2 = 26 cups. So, the answer is 26 cups.
Response:  If there is one river that flows through 120 miles of land and has a width of 1 mile, then the length of the river is 120 miles. Now, if we divide this length by the width of the river, we get the number of times the river flows through each mile of land. So, the number of times the river flows through each mile of land is 120 / 1 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 90 and 40 are divisible by each other.  So we need to divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 90 and 40 is 10. Therefore, we can write: 90 = 10 x 9 and 40 = 10 x 4. Now we see that 90 and 40 are divisible by each other exactly 10 times. So the answer is 10.
Response:  The first person has $15,000 and wants to divide it equally among 20 people. So each person will get $750. Now, there are 19 people left with $14,250 each. They want to divide it equally among themselves again, so each person will get $836.67. Therefore, the final amount that the last person will receive is $836.67.
Response:  Karlos has $30 to spend and wants to buy either a Carlson or a Penchi product. The prices of these products are given as follows:  Carlson: $20 per unit, Penchi: $18 per unit. If Karlos buys one unit of each product, he will have spent $60 (2 x $20 + 3 x $18). So, if he spends all his $30 on these two products, he will be left with nothing. Therefore, the best option for him is to buy only one unit of either Carlson or Penchi product.
"Response:  If New Jersey is in Rosh Hashanah (which means ""Head of the Year"" in Hebrew), then it will be 6 months from now. So, if Rosh Hashanah falls on September 25th, then New Jersey will be 6 months later, which is March 25th. Now, let's calculate how many days are between these two dates. From September 25th to March 25th there are exactly 180 days. Therefore, the answer is 180 days."
Response:  James has 30 dogs, 20 cats, and 40 birds. He feeds them all together with 8 bowls of food that can hold 14 cups of food each. So, in total, he feeds 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 animals. Therefore, the answer is 90.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total cost of the items is $6.50 and the seller has to pay $2 for packing, $1 for transportation, $1 for insurance, and $0.25 for handling. So, the total amount he has to pay is $6.50 + $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.25 = $9.75. Now, let's see how much profit he will make after selling the item. The seller bought it for $3 and sold it for $5, so his profit is ($5 - $3) = $2. Therefore, the seller makes a profit of $2.
Response:  Kalinda has 360 degrees of freedom to move around in any direction. Out of these, she can rotate her body through 4 directions (north, south, east, and west) using her arms and legs. So, the number of possible movements for Kalinda is 360 x 4 = 1440. Therefore, the answer is 1440.
Response:  The number of girls in the school is 120 and they are divided into 4 classes with 30 students each. So, there are 4 x 30 = 120 students in total. Now, let's assume that out of these 120 students, 30% or 36 students have failed their exams. Therefore, the remaining 84 students who passed their exams are left to compete for the prize money.
Response:  Maragadham has 12 cars and each car costs Rs. 20,000. So, in total, he has spent Rs. 240,000 (12 x 20,000). Now, he is offering a discount of 10% which means he will sell each car for Rs. 18,000 (Rs. 20,000 x 10%). Therefore, he will gain a profit of Rs. 60,000 (Rs. 240,000 - Rs. 180,000).
Response:  Kaiil has 20 balls and he wants to distribute them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 4 balls (20/5 = 4). Now, out of these 4 balls, 2 are broken, so 2 balls are left with Kaili. Therefore, the number of balls that Kaili has after distributing them is 4 + 2 = 6 balls.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times the word ""avar"" appears in each of the given sentences and then multiply it with the number of sentences.  For example, in the first sentence, ""avar"" appears once, so we will give one point for that. In the second sentence, ""avar"" appears twice, so we will give two points for that. Similarly, we will calculate the points for each sentence and add them up to get the total score. Therefore, the answer is:  Points = (1 x 2) + (3 x 4) + (6 x 7) + (8 x 9) + (10 x 10) = 120"
Response:  We know that there are 36 students in the class and each student has to bring one pen. So, total pens required = 36 x 1 = 36. Now, we come to the second part of the question where it is mentioned that some students have brought more than one pen. Let's assume that out of 36 students, 8 students have brought 2 pens each, which means they have contributed 8 x 2 = 16 pens. Similarly, if 5 students have brought 3 pens each, they have contributed 5 x 3 = 15 pens. Therefore, the total number of pens brought by all the students is 36 + 16 + 15 = 67 pens.
Response:  The man has 6 days to prepare for his trip and he wants to pack 3 bags with different items. So, in total, he will have 6 x 3 = 18 items to pack. Now, each bag can hold 5 items, so the total number of items that can fit in all 3 bags is 18 / 5 = 3.6. Since we cannot have a fraction of an item, let's round it up to 4 items. Therefore, the man can pack 4 items in each of his 3 bags.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 people in John's team and each person has to work for 4 hours. So, the total working time is 20 x 4 = 80 hours. Now, we have to divide this amount equally among all the teams, which means each team will get 80/5 = 16 hours of work. Therefore, the answer is 16 hours.
Response:  If Rama has 25 coins and he gives 10 of them to Maithili, then Rama will have 15 coins left. Now, if Rama gives 5 more coins to Maithili, then Rama will have 10 coins left. So, in total, Rama gave away 15 + 5 = 20 coins. Therefore, the number of coins that Rama has left is 15 - 20 = -5 coins.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jani has 20 dollars and he gave 10 dollars to his friend. So, now Jani has 10 dollars left with him. Now, let's assume that Jani spent some amount from his remaining 10 dollars. Let's say he spent 5 dollars. Then, Jani would have 5 dollars left with him. Therefore, the answer is 5 dollars.
Response:  If Jonas is 30 years old and he has 20 children, then each child would be approximately 1.5 years older than Jonas (since Jonas is 30 + 20 = 50 years old). So, the oldest child of Jonas would be around 60 - 1.5 = 58 years old. Therefore, the person who is 70 years old and younger than Jo...
"Response:  We know that there are 1000 students in this classroom and they are divided into three groups - A, B, and C.  Out of these 1000 students, 300 belong to group A (30%).  Among those who belong to group B (3/5), 270 students are present (3 x 90 = 270). Similarly, among those who belong to group C (1/3), 108 students are present (3 x 36 = 108). Therefore, the total number of students in each group is as follows: Group A - 300; Group B - 270; Group C - 108."
Response:  James has 6 cars and each car has 54 wheels. So, in total, James has 324 wheels (6 x 54 = 324). Now, let's assume that James wants to sell one of his cars. If he sells one car with 54 wheels, then he will have 320 wheels left (324 - 54 = 320). Therefore, the answer is 320.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many different ways there are to arrange the letters in ""tolikku irandu puthakal"" (total of 9 letters). There is only one way to arrange these letters - T-O-L-I-K-K-U-I-R-A-N-D-U. Now, let's count the number of unique combinations of letters that can be formed using the letters in ""pandaora"" (total of 8 letters). There are 3 unique combinations of letters that can be formed using the letters in ""pandaora"" - P-A-N-D-A-O-R-A. Therefore, the total number of unique combinations of letters that can be formed using all the letters in both ""tolikku irandu puthakal"" and ""pandaora"" is 1 x 3 = 3. So, the answer is 3."
Response:  There are 5 people in a group and each person has to give 2 compliments to other members of the group. So, total number of compliments = 5 x 2 = 10. Now, out of these 10 compliments, 3 are given to one person, which means that this person received 3/10 = 0.3 or 30% of all compliments. Therefore, the answer is 30%.
"Response: 
Jesus has been preaching for 1000 days and he can speak for 15 hours a day. So in one month (30 days), Jesus can speak for 450 hours (1000 x 15). 
Now, let's calculate how many sermons Jesus can deliver in a year (12 months) based on his daily speaking time of 450 hours. 
In a year, Jesus can deliver 54,000 sermons (450 x 12). 
So, in 30 years, Jesus can deliver approximately 162,000 sermons (54,000 x 3)."
Response:  Kiran has 24 hours in a day and he spends 5 hours with his friends. So, he has 19 free hours (24 - 5 = 19). Now, Jignesh has to spend 3 hours with Kiran. So, Jignesh has 16 free hours (19 - 3 = 16) after meeting Kiran.
Response:  We have 4 balls in one urn and 32 balls in another urn. If we randomly select one ball from each urn without knowing their contents, what is the probability that both selected balls are of the same color?  The probability of selecting a red ball from the first urn is 1/4, since there are 4 red balls in total. Similarly, the probability of selecting a blue ball from the second urn is also 1/32, since there are 32 blue balls in total. Now, let's calculate the probability of selecting two balls with the same color. Since there are 4 red balls and 32 blue balls, the probability of selecting a red ball and then a blue ball is (4/48) x (32/64) = 1/16. Therefore, the probability of both selected balls being of the same color is 1/16.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jenny is an artist who sells her paintings for $250 each. She works for 6 months in a year and spends 4 weeks of that time promoting her artwork. Therefore, she has 48 weeks (6 months x 8 weeks/month) to create and sell her paintings.  Now, let's calculate how many paintings Jenny can make per week based on the number of weeks available:  Number of paintings = Total number of weeks / Number of weeks spent creating and selling paintings  In this case, the total number of weeks is 48 weeks, and the number of weeks spent creating and selling paintings is 32 weeks (since Jenny spends 4 weeks promoting her artwork). So, the number of paintings Jenny can make per week is: Number of paintings = 48 weeks / 32 weeks = 1.5 paintings/week  Since Jenny makes one painting every two weeks, she earns $250 x 1.5 = $375 per month from her artwork.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of money spent by Isabell is $1200.  Out of this, she spent $430 on perfumes and colognes, $150 on makeup, $40 on hair accessories, and $220 on clothes. So, the remaining amount that Isabelle has after buying all these things is $690 ($1200 - $430 - $150 - $40 - $220). Now, let's see how much each person got as their share of the remaining amount. Since there are 7 people in total, each person will get an equal share of the remaining amount, which is $690 divided by 7 = $98.57 per person. Therefore, each person received $98.57 as their share of the remaining amount after Isabelle bought all those things.
Response:  We know that there are four farmers and each of them has 50 baskets of rice. So, the total number of baskets of rice produced by all the four farmers is 4 x 50 = 200 baskets. Now, we need to find out how much money one kilo of rice costs for each farmer. Since one kilo of rice costs $1.50, we can calculate the cost per farmer as follows: Cost per farmer = Total cost of rice / Number of farmers = $1.50 x 200 baskets / 4 farmers = $37.50 per farmer. Therefore, the answer is $37.50.
Response:  The girl has 4 friends who are also her classmates and they have been studying together for 3 years. So, there are 4 x 3 = 12 students in total. Now, we need to find out how many of them can fit into one room that is 5 meters long and 3 meters wide. To do this, we divide the length and width of the room by the number of people who want to fit inside it. In this case, we have 12 students wanting to fit into the room, so we divide 5 meters (length) by 12 and get 0.417 meters per person (length). Similarly, we divide 3 meters (width) by 12 and get 0.25 meters per person (width). Therefore, 12 students can fit into the room comfortably with each student having an area of approximately 0.417 meters x 0.25 meters = 0.1036 square meters of space each.
