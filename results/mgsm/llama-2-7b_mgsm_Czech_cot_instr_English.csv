"Response: 
Janet produces 16 eggs per day and sells them at $2 each. So she makes $32 in total from egg sales every day. Now let's calculate how much money she makes from baking muffins for her friends. She bakes 4 muffins per day and charges $5 each. That means she earns $20 from muffin sales every day ($5 x 4 = $20). Therefore, Janet makes a total of $52 per day from both egg and muffin sales ($32 + $20 = $52).";;
Response:  We have 2 blue threads and half of them are white. So we need 2 x (1/2) = 1 shank for each thread. Therefore, in total, we need 2 + 2 = 4 shanks.;;
Response:  If Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on repairs, that means he invested a total of $130,000 in the property ($80,000 + $50,000). After making the repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%, which is equal to $225,000 (150% of $150,000). So, if we subtract the amount he invested from the new value of the house, we get his profit: $225,000 - $130,000 = $95,000. Therefore, Josh made a profit of $95,000 on the sale of the house.;;

Response:  According to the problem statement, Wendy feeds her chickens three handfuls of food per day, containing seeds, grains, and vegetables, to keep them healthy. Then she gives her flock 15 handfuls in the morning and another 25 handfuls in the afternoon. To find out how many handfuls Wendy needs to give her chickens at their last meal of the day if she has 20 chickens, we need to use the information given in the problem. So, let x be the number of handfuls Wendy gives her chickens at their last meal of the day. Since Wendy gives her chickens 3 handfuls per day, the total number of handfuls Wendy gives her chickens in one day is 3x. Therefore, the total number of handfuls Wendy gives her chickens in one day is equal to 3 times the number of handfuls she gives them at their last meal of the day. Now, we are told that Wendy has 20 chickens, so the total number of handfuls she gives her chickens in one day is equal to 3 times 20, which is equal to 60 handfuls. Thus, Wendy needs to give her chickens 60 handfuls of food at their last meal of the day.;;
Response:  The cost of one glass is $5, and each subsequent glass costs 60% less than the previous one. So, the cost of 2 glasses is (60% of $5) = $3, and so on... Therefore, the total cost of 16 glasses would be: $5 + ($3 x 15) = $70.;;
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times more sheep than Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Toulouse has 4 x (20) = 80 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 80 + 4(20) + 20 = 160 sheep.;;
"Response:  We know that Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so it will take her 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to download a 200 GB file. However, we also know that Windows forces a reboot after 40% of the way through the download process, which takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for Carla to download the file is:

100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes = 2 hours and 0 minutes
So, the answer is 2 hours.";;
Response:  Firstly, we know that John travelled for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour before turning around and heading back home. This means he covered a distance of 180 miles (60 x 3) during this time. Then, after turning around, he traveled for another 2 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, covering a distance of 60 miles (2 x 30). Finally, he traveled for the remaining 2 hours at a speed of 80 miles per hour, covering a distance of 160 miles (2 x 80). Therefore, the total distance from John's starting point to his destination is: Distance = 180 + 60 + 160 = 300 miles.;;
"Response:  If Eliza works for the first 40 hours and earns $10 per hour, her total earnings for those hours are:

$10/hour x 40 hours = $400

If she also works overtime (for the next 5 hours) at $1.2 times her regular rate, her overtime earnings are:

$10/hour x 5 hours = $50

So, in total, Eliza earned:

Therefore, Eliza earned $450 for that week.";;
Response:  The number of downloads in the first month was 60. In the second month, there were three times as many downloads (60 x 3 = 180). However, in the third month, there were 30% fewer downloads (180 - 30 = 126). So, the total number of downloads over the three months was 60 + 180 - 30 = 270.;;
"Response: 
Toula bought 3 hundred (300) pieces of bread, which cost $68 per piece.
She also bought 2 hundred (200) mini cupcakes, which cost $80 per piece.
Finally, she bought 6 hundred (600) mini cheesecakes, which cost $55 per piece.
So, in total, Toula spent:
$68 x 300 = $2040 on bread
$80 x 200 = $1600 on mini cupcakes
$55 x 600 = $3300 on mini cheesecakes

"Response:  The cost of planting the tree is $90, and it will take 7 years to harvest the first crop of oranges (since each year there are 7 oranges produced). So in total, we have:
Year 1: Planting costs - $90
Year 2-7: No income since no oranges are produced yet
Year 8: First orange harvest - $1,5 x 7 = $10.50 income per year
Year 9-infinity: Income from selling oranges ($1.5/piece) + expenses for water and maintenance ($3/year)
So, the break-even point is around Year 9, when the income from selling oranges exceeds the annual expenses. Therefore, the answer is:
Break-even time: Approximately 9 years.";;

Response:  We know that out of 30 students, 6 students are currently dancing (20%). Now we need to find out how many students are left and what percentage they will be in each dance style. So, 14 students are left (80%). Of these, 5 students are in jazz dance (36%). Therefore, the number of students who are in hip-hop dance is: 14 - 5 = 9 students (75%). So, 9/30 or 30% of all students are in hip-hop dance.;;
"Response:  The total value of the two options is $5000 + $8000 = $13000. If the market for jewelry increases by 2.5% and the market for electronics increases by 1.2%, then the present value of each option can be calculated as follows: Option A (jewelry): PV = $5000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5150; Option B (electronics): PV = $8000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8160. To find out which option will give the highest return at the end of the month, we need to subtract the initial investment from the present value of each option: Option A: $5150 - $5000 = $150; Option B: $8160 - $8000 = $-940. Since Option B has a negative value, it means that choosing this option would result in a loss of $940 at the end of the month. Therefore, the optimal choice for maximizing profit would be Option A, which has a present value of $150.";;

Response:  The first three customers bought one each, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs sold. The next two customers bought 2 each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs sold. Finally, the last three customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's 0 x 3 = 0 DVDs sold. Therefore, in total, Billy sold 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs on Tuesday.;;
Response:  The rate at which the candle melts is given as 2 cm/hour. So, if it starts melting at 13:00 and continues to melt until 17:00, we can calculate the total time it will take for the candle to melt using the formula: Time = Distance / Rate. In this case, the distance is 4 cm (since the candle will be 2 cm shorter after 3 hours). Therefore, the time it takes for the candle to melt is: Time = 4 cm / 2 cm/hour = 2 hours. So, when the clock strikes 17:00, the candle will be 2 cm shorter than its original length of 6 cm.;;
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for last year's best-selling book and there is a 25% discount from the original price. So we can write an equation as follows:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50, so we can plug this value into the equation:

$19.50 = x / (1 - 0.25)

Now we need to solve for the unknown variable 'x'. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator (1 - 0.25):

$19.50 = x / (1 - 0.25) × (1 - 0.25)

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

$19.50 = x / 0.75

So the original price of the book was $26 ($19.50 / 0.75).";;
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of these items. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 
$50 = x + y + z + w
Where 'x'";y';"z', and 'w' represent the cost of each item in dollars. Since Marie bought 3 bags of chicken food for $12, we know that 'x' = $12. Similarly, since she bought 5 bottles of milk for $3, we know that 'y' = $3. Also, since she bought 4 apples for $1.50, we know that 'z' = $1.50. Finally, since she bought a pair of pizzas for $8.50 each, we know that 'w' = $8.50. Now, let's substitute these values into our original equation: 
$50 = $12 + $3 + $1.50 + $8.50
Now simplify the equation: 
$50 = $26.50
So, Marie bought 26.5 pieces of chicken food, 3 bottles of milk, 1.5 apples, and 8.5 pairs of pizza."
Response:  The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50, and there are three pairs of shorts that Mishka bought. Therefore, the total cost of shorts = $16.50 x 3 = $49.50. Similarly, the cost of one pair of pants is $22.50, and there are three pairs of pants that Mishka bought. Therefore, the total cost of pants = $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. Finally, the cost of one pair of shoes is $42, and there are also three pairs of shoes that Mishka bought. Therefore, the total cost of shoes = $42 x 3 = $126. So, in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $233 dollars for all the clothes.;;
"Response:  If she buys one portion of ice cream every evening and pays $4 for each container, then after 60 days, how much will she have spent in total?

Step-by-step calculation:
Day 1 to Day 30: She buys 30 portions (one per day) = 30 x $4 = $120
Day 31 to Day 60: She buys 30 portions (one per day) = 30 x $4 = $120
Total amount spent = $120 + $120 = $240
Therefore, after 60 days, she will have spent $240 on ice cream.";;
Response:  We know that Henry stopped twice during his 60-mile bike ride. He stopped for the first time after 20 miles and then again before finishing the last 40 miles of the trip. So, we can calculate the distance between the two stops as follows: Distance = Total distance - First stop distance = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles Now, we need to find out how far Henry traveled between his first and second stops. To do this, we divide the distance between the two stops by 2: Distance = 40 miles / 2 = 20 miles Therefore, Henry traveled 20 miles between his first and second stops.;;
"Response:  If Gloria buys both pairs of shoes, she will spend $50 + (2 x $15) = $70. Since one pair costs $33 and the other double that amount, we can calculate the cost of each shoe as follows: Cost of first shoe = $33; Cost of second shoe = $66. Therefore, the total cost of both shoes is $33 + $66 = $99. So, the difference between the two prices is $50 - $99 = -$49.";;
"Response:  We know that Věk Darrella is 7 times greater than Allen's age, so we can write it as follows:
Věk Darrella = 7 × Age of Allen
We are also given that the total age of both is 162 years. So, we can set up an equation:
Age of Allen + Věk Darrella = 162
Now, we want to find out Allen's age after 10 years. So, we can substitute the value of Věk Darrella in terms of Allen's age into the first equation:
Age of Allen + (7 × Age of Allen) = 162
Simplifying and solving for Allen's age, we get:
Age of Allen = 135
Therefore, Allen's age after 10 years is 135 years old.";;
Response:  The first friend said there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second friend said that 20 is more than half of the first amount, so there must be at least 40 jelly beans left. The third friend said that their estimate is 25% more than the first friend’s estimate, which means they estimated 100 jelly beans (since 25% of 80 is 20). Therefore, the average of their estimates is 100 + 40 + 100 = 240 jelly beans in the jar.;;
Response:  Since each dog spends half an hour per day for walking and caring for its own affairs, there are 16 hours in a day (24 - 8 = 16). Therefore, the dogs spend 8 hours per week (16 x 0.5 = 8) taking care of their business.;;
Response:  We know that there are 110 mincules in total and 80 of them are silver. So, if we subtract the number of silver coins from the total number of coins, we get the number of gold coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins is 110 - 80 = 30. So, Gretchen has 30 gold coins.;;
"Response:  We know that Siobhan has fewer diamonds than Aaron and less than half of Raymond's. So, if Raymond has 40 diamonds, then Siobhan must have... (1)

Let X be the number of diamonds Siobhan has. Since Aaron has more diamonds than Siobhan, we can say that Aaron has X + 2 diamonds. And since Polovina of Raymond has 5 more diamonds than Aaron, Polovina has 3X + 7 diamonds. Now, we are given that Polovina has 30 diamonds in total. Therefore, we can write the equation:

3X + 7 = 40... (2)

Now, let's solve for X:

X = 36

So, Siobhan has 36 diamonds.";;
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he had 4/40 = 1/10 of the total score. Since in the next 20 minutes, he gained 25% more points, he got (1/10) \* (1 + 25%) = 13/10 of the total score. So, Mike's final score is 4 + 13 = 17/40 bodies.;;
Response:  Terry buys two yogurts daily and currently they are sold for $5 per 5 yogurts. How much will he pay for 30 days of yogurt? To find out, we need to calculate how many yogurts Terry will buy in one month. Since he buys two yogurts daily, he will have bought 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts in one month. So, Terry will pay $5 x 60 = $300 for 30 days of yogurt.;;
Response:  If John sells all of his LEGO sets for $15 each and buys 8 video games for $20 each, he will have spent a total of $15 x 8 = $120 on video games. This means that he will have $120 - $15 x 13 = $65 left over after buying the video games. So, John still has 5 LEGO sets ($65 / $15 = 5).;;
"Response: 
Day 1: John runs for 3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes
Days 2 and 3: John runs for half of day 1 = (180/2) x 60 = 90 minutes each day
Total time running per week = Day 1 + Days 2 and 3 = 180 + 90 + 90 = 360 minutes
Therefore, John runs at a speed of 360/10 = 36 km/h.";;
"Response:  If Dana can run four times faster than she can walk and can jump at half the speed of running, then we know that her jogging speed is 2/5 of her running speed. We also know that her jumping speed is 1/2 of her running speed. Therefore, if she jumps for 3 miles per hour, she will cover 1.5 miles in one hour while running. Now, let's calculate how far she will travel in 6 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 1.5 miles/hour x 6 hours
= 9 miles
Therefore, Dana can travel 9 miles in 6 hours, assuming she spends equal time running and walking.";;
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:
Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone.
Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone.
So, if Suzy's iPhone is x years old, then Brandon's iPhone is 4x years old.
We are also given that Ben's iPhone is two years older than Suzy's iPhone, so Suzy's iPhone is x - 2 years old.
Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:
4x = (x - 2) + 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 6
So, Suzy's iPhone is 6 years old.
Since Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Suzy's iPhone, it is 4 \* 6 = 24 years old.
Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 24 years old.";;
Response:  We know that when Polly doesn't hold the sapphire gemstone, she can hit the dragon with her golden sword at a distance of 400 stops (or 400 x 3 = 1200 feet). Now, we are told that when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can hit the dragon with her golden sword at a distance of 3 times farther than before, or 3 x 400 = 1200 + 600 = 1800 feet. So, if Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone and stands at a distance of 1800 feet from the dragon, she can still hit it with her golden sword even though the flames are within reach.;;
Response:  We know that Babička made five jam dumplings and cut each one into eight pieces, so she had 40 pieces of dumplings in total (5 x 8 = 40). Then, she put 5 dumplings on the table for the guests to share, which means there were 35 dumplings left over after they were finished (40 - 5 = 35). So, the number of kusy (pieces) of dumpling that the guests took was 35.;;

Response:  We know that Candice had 80 notes before she went to the cafe and bought a pack of Post-it notes with 100 sheets. So, in total, she had 80 + 100 = 180 notes. Now, we are told that she used one note for each of the 220 cups of coffee she filled at work, which means she has 220 - 180 = 40 remaining notes. Therefore, the number of notes in the pack she bought is 100.;;
Response:  We know that John buys twice as many red cows as blue ones. So he has 2x = 2 \* 12 = 24 blue cows and 2x = 2 \* 12 = 24 red cows. The price of each blue cow is $40, so the total cost of blue cows is $40 x 12 = $480. Similarly, the total cost of red cows is $40 x 12 = $480. Since John spent $200 on blue cows, we can conclude that he spent $200 + $480 = $680 on all his cows.;;
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a piece of string that is 4 feet long to support tomatoes in her garden. Since there are 3 feet in a foot, we can write:

String length = 4 ft = 3 × 3 ft = 9 ft
Now, let's find out how many pieces of string Tracy cut from the original one:

Pieces of string = String length / Length of each piece (in feet)
= 9 ft / 15 cm/ft
= 60 pieces
Therefore, Tracy obtained 60 pieces of string after cutting them from the original one.";;
Response:  We know that there are 15 apartments in the building and each apartment has 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is 15 x 8 = 120 units.

Response:  The speed of the ship is given as $10 \text{ miles/hour}$. It travels from one to four hours and then returns at a speed of $6 \text{ miles/hour}$. To find out how long it will take for the ship to return, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance traveled during the journey is $4 \times 10 = 40$ miles. So, the time taken to cover that distance at a speed of $6 \text{ miles/hour}$ is: Time = $40 \div 6 = 6.67$ hours. Therefore, it will take the ship approximately $6.67$ hours to return.;;
Response:  If Urijah has 15 pounds of books and he needs to reduce it to 10 pounds, then he must remove 5 pounds of books. Now, let's calculate how many comics or toys he can have based on their weights: Comic books weigh 4 kilos each, so if Urijah removes 30 comics (which is equal to 120 kilograms), he will be left with 70 kilograms of comics. Toys weigh half a kilogram each, so if Urijah removes 30 toys (which is equal to 15 kilograms), he will be left with 45 kilograms of toys. Therefore, after removing 30 comics, Urijah still needs to remove an additional 10 kilograms of items from his backpack, which means he must remove another 5 kilograms of toys. So, in total, Urijah must remove 15 pounds / 2 = 7.5 pounds of toys from his backpack.;;

Response:  If Jean has 30 lízátek and he takes two of them, then he has 30 - 2 = 28 lízátků left. To fill one basket with two lízátky means that he can fill 28 / 2 = 14 baskets. Therefore, Jean can fill 14 baskets.;;
Response:  If Peter always pays $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn, then he will spend a total of $14 per trip to the cinema ($7 + $7). Since he has $42 for the week, he can go to the cinema $\boxed{6}$ times ($42 / 14 = 6$).;;
Response:  The maximum weight that can be carried by the bridge is 5000 pounds (lb). Each box weighs 15 lb, so the total weight of one load is 15 x number of boxes = 15N, where N is the number of boxes. Since there are no restrictions on how many loads can cross the bridge at once, we will assume that each load consists of an equal number of boxes. Therefore, if we want to find out how many boxes can fit in one load without exceeding the weight limit, we need to divide 5000 by 15: Number of boxes = 5000 / 15 = 333. So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit is 333.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Stephen spent $40 on groceries online. Then, there was an additional 25% charge for delivery which is equal to $10 (since it was through a delivery service). So, the total amount he paid including tax and shipping would be: $40 + ($40 x 25%) = $40 + $10 = $50. Finally, he added $4 as a handling fee, bringing the total cost of his purchases to $50 + $4 = $54. Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all charges were applied was $54.;;
Response:  We know that the bush has 6 clusters of plums with 20 fruits in each cluster and 67 individual plums scattered throughout the tree.

"Response:  We know that there are 25 pomerančů in total and we want to find out how many of them are good. From the information given, we can conclude that:

* 1 pomeranč is bad (so it doesn't count towards the total number of good ones)
* 20% of the pomeranče are not yet ripe (this means that 4 pomeranče are not yet ripe)
* 2 pomeranče are too sour (again, these don't count towards the total number of good ones)

So, if we subtract the bad, unripe, and sour pomeranče from the total number of pomeranče, we will get the number of good pomeranče. In this case, that would be:

25 - 1 - 4 - 2 = 18

Therefore, there are 18 good pomeranče in the basket.";;
"Response: 
Janet pays $500 for materials and another $800 for the jewelry, so she paid a total of $1300. Then, she pays 10% of that amount as insurance, which is $130 (10% of $1300). So, in total, Janet paid $1430 ($1300 + $130) for the brooch.";;
"Response:  If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000 after retirement, then her total pension amount would be:

$50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000 (total pension amount)

Since she has worked for 20 years, she is eligible to receive 5% of the total pension amount as a yearly pension, which is:

$2,000,000 x 5% = $100,000 (yearly pension amount for 20 years of service)

Therefore, if she continues working for another 10 years, her total pension amount would be:

$2,000,000 + ($100,000 x 10) = $2,100,000 (total pension amount after 30 years of service)

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service would be:

$2,100,000 / 40 = $52,500 (annual pension amount).";;
"Response:  The first month of service was free, so there is no charge for that month. For the second month, the company charged $140 (the regular price), but since it was the second month, they gave her a discount of 10%, which means she paid $126 ($140 x 0.9 = $126) for that month. Now, let's calculate the total amount she paid for the year:
Yearly cost = Monthly cost x Number of months in the year
= $126 x 10 months
= $1,260
So, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year was $1,260.";;
Response:  We know that Sophia has traveled 160 kilometers since the last time she filled up her tank and needed to fill it again with 4 gallons of gasoline to continue driving. According to the manual for her car, the fuel tank holds 12 gallons of gasoline. To find out how many kilometers Sophia can drive on one liter of gasoline, we need to divide the distance she can travel (160 km) by the amount of gasoline she needs to fill up (4 gallons): 160 km / 4 gal = 40 km/gal. Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 40 kilometers on one liter of gasoline.;;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jim watches TV for two hours and then decides to go to bed and read for half an hour. He does this three times a week. So, in one week, he will have watched TV for 2 x 3 = 6 hours and read for 3 x 0.5 = 1.5 hours. In four weeks, he will have watched TV for 4 x 6 = 24 hours and read for 4 x 1.5 = 6 hours. Therefore, Jim spends a total of 24 + 6 = 30 hours watching TV and reading over four weeks.;;
Response:  Since there are four schools participating in the tournament, each school has sent two teams (one for girls and one for boys). Therefore, the total number of teams is 4 x 2 = 8 teams. Each team has 5 players, so the total number of players is 8 x 5 = 40 players. Finally, since each school also sent a coach, the total number of people who went to the tournament is 40 + 1 (for each school) = 41 people.;;
Response:  We know that there are more diamonds than rubies and more smaragds than rubies too. So, we can start with the number of diamonds. There were 175 diamonds in total. Now, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are fewer rubies than diamonds, for every 2 diamonds, there is one ruby. Therefore, the number of rubies = 175 / 2 = 87. Finally, since there are twice as many smaragds as rubies, the number of smaragds = 87 x 2 = 174. So, the total number of stones found in the chest was 175 + 87 + 174 = 436 stones.;;
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls at school. So, if there are x girls, then there are 2x boys. The number of students per teacher is given by 60/student (for girls) and 5/teacher (for boys). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 60 - 5(x)

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 60 - 5x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

x = 30

So, there are 30 girls at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are 60 boys at the school. In total, there are 90 students at the school (30 girls + 60 boys).";;
Response:  Bailey starts with some initial amount of money (let's call it x). Then she receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, which is equal to $40 ($5 x 8). At the end of 8 weeks, if she has $100 in total, then we can write an equation: x + $40 = $100. Solving for x, we get: x = $60. So, Bailey had $60 at the beginning.;;
"Response:  If Judy teaches for 5 hours per day from Monday to Friday and earns $15 per student, then her total income per week is calculated as follows:
Total hours taught per week = 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week
Number of students per class = 15 students/class x 7 classes/week = 105 students/week
Income per week = Total hours taught per week x Number of students per class x Price per student = $35/hour x 105 students/week x $15/student = $5,250/week
Therefore, Judy would earn $5,250 per week.";;
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second one has twice as many instructions as the first (i.e., 40 instructions). So, to prepare both meals, Kelian needs to read 40 + 20 = 60 instructions in total.;;
Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each cheesecake for $4, then he will make $3 x 43 = $132 from the brownies and $4 x 23 = $92 from the cheesecakes. Therefore, Tommy will have made a total of $132 + $92 = $224 in profit.;;
Response:  She bought five mobile phones for $150 each and will pay for them over three months with a 2% interest rate per unit. To calculate how much she will pay each month, we can use the formula: Total Cost = Number of Units x Price per Unit + Interest Charges. In this case, the total cost is: Total Cost = 5 x $150 + (5 x $150) x 2% = $750 + $30 = $780. So, Sheila will pay $780 per month for three months.;;
"Response:  If we assume that each bunch of flowers is sold for $2.74 (golden daisies), $1.87 (petunias), or $2.12 (begonias), then...

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling all three types of flowers:
Total Revenue = Number of bunches x Price per bunch
= 12 + 9 + 17 = 38
Total Revenue = $2.74 x 12 + $1.87 x 9 + $2.12 x 17 = $50.64

Step 2: Since Artie wants to round up all prices to the nearest dollar, he will lose some money due to rounding. So, let's calculate how much he will lose:
Lost Money = Total Revenue - Rounded Revenue
= $50.64 - ($2.74 x 12 + $1.87 x 9 + $2.12 x 17) / 100
= $50.64 - ($27.44 + $18.70 + $21.20) / 100
= $50.64 - $57.34 / 100
= -$6.70

So, Artie will lose $6.70 if he rounds up all prices to the nearest dollar.";;
Response:  The height of each level is half the area of the previous level, so the height of the first level is half the area of the second level, and so on. Therefore, the height of the fourth level will be half the area of the third level, which means that the area of the fourth level is equal to one-fourth of the total area of all four levels combined. Since the highest level has an area of 16 square stops, we can set up the following equation: Area of highest level = (1/4) x (Total area of all four levels). Solving for Total area of all four levels gives us: Total area of all four levels = 16 x 4 = 64 square stops. So, the average area per level is: Average area per level = Total area of all four levels / Number of levels = 64 / 4 = 16 square stops.;;
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Cecilia must feed her puppy one scoop of dog food per day for the first 180 days (or 6 months). After that period, she will need to feed him two scoops of dog food every day until the end of his life. Now, let's calculate how many scoops of dog food Cecilia will use in total during the first year:

First 180 days: 1 scoop/day x 180 days = 180 scoops
Additional years: 2 scoops/day x number of remaining years =?

Since we are given that the puppy lives for 7 years after the initial 180-day period, we can calculate the number of additional scoops as follows:

Number of remaining years = 7 years
Scoops per year = 2 scoops/day x 365 days/year (assuming a non-leap year)
Total additional scoops = Number of remaining years x Scoops per year = 7 years x 2 scoops/day = 14 scoops/year
Now, let's calculate the total number of scoops Cecilia will use during the entire first year:

Total scoops = First 180 days + Additional years = 180 scoops + 14 scoops/year x number of years = 180 scoops + 14 x 7 = 198 scoops
Therefore, Cecilia will use approximately 198 pylons of dog food during the first year of her puppy's life.";;
"Response:  If Raymond uses half of what Sarah uses and Sarah uses four times as much as David, we can write it down like this:
Raymond uses x = (1/2)Sarah's amount
Sarah uses y = 4David's amount
We know that Sarah uses 400 pounds of laundry, so we can write it down like this:
y + x = 400
Now we need to solve for x, which is the amount of laundry used by Raymond. We can do this by subtracting y from both sides of the equation:
x = (1/2)y - y
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
x = (1/2)(400) - 4(80)
x = 320
So, Raymond uses 320 pounds of laundry.";;
Response:  If he buys 3 bunches of flowers for $2.50 each, then he will spend $7.50 in total ($2.50 x 3). If he buys 2 bunches of flowers for $1 each, then he will spend $2 in total ($1 x 2). So, by buying 18 bunches of flowers, he will save $5.50 ($7.50 - $2 = $5.50).;;
"Response:  The original price of the grooming is $100. If the zlepšovatel offers a discount of 30%, then the new price would be:

So, the cost of the grooming after the discount is $70.";;
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 4 liters (since 24 / 6 = 4). Then, one boy got 6 liters more, so he got 6 + 4 = 10 liters in total. Therefore, there are 24 - 10 = 14 liters left.;;
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 stickers initially and bought 21 more in the shop. So, he has a total of 31 stickers now (10 + 21 = 31). Then, he received 23 stickers as a gift on his birthday, so he has a total of 54 stickers now (31 + 23 = 54). Finally, he gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 for decoration, leaving him with 76 stickers (54 - 9 - 28 = 76). Therefore, Charlie has 76 stickers left.;;
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 40 kg and Alex weighs less than 40 kg by half a kilogram. So, Alex's weight is 20 kg (40 - 20 =). Therefore, the total weight of both Grace and Alex together is 60 kg (40 + 20 =).;;
Response:  If Dan planted three rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses, then there are 3 x 25 = 75 roses in total. Since each rose has 8 thorns, there are 75 x 8 = 600 thorns altogether. Therefore, there are 600 thorns.;;
Response:  The team played 22 games and won more than they lost. So, we can say that their win-loss record is positive. Now, let's find out how many more games they won than they lost. We know that they won 8 more games than they lost (since they won more than they lost). Therefore, the number of games they won = 8 + x, where x is the number of games they lost. Since they lost fewer games than they played, we have x < 22. Now, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8: x/8 = 20 - 8. Solving for x, we get x = 14. So, the football team won 14 games and lost 8 games.;;
Response:  We know that Gene has been going on vacation four times a year since he was 23 years old (he is now 34). Therefore, we can assume that each row of blocks represents one year of his vacations. Since there are 16 rows of blocks, this means that Gene has gone on vacation for 16 x 4 = 64 years in total. Now, we need to calculate how many wooden blocks Gene has collected during these vacations. Each block represents one week of vacation, so Gene has collected 64 weeks \* 7 days/week = 456 days worth of wooden blocks. Finally, since each day has 8 hours \* 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes, Gene has collected 456 days \* 480 minutes/day = 229,440 minutes worth of wooden blocks.;;
Response:  When the alarm went off for the first time today (Day 1), it rang four times. When it went off again (Day 2), it rang three times longer than the first time. So if we let X be the number of times the alarm rang during the second occurrence, then we can write an equation based on that information: X = 3(4) = 12. Therefore, the alarm rang 12 times during Day 2. Finally, when it went off for the third time (Day 3), it only rang halfway through its full duration, so it rang 6 times. Hence, the total number of times the alarm rang over the course of the three days is: 12 + 6 = 18.;;
Response:  If Sylvie has been working for five years and her monthly salary is $600, then her annual salary would be $7200 ($600 x 12). Now, according to the policy, if she stays in the company for three more years, her annual salary will increase by 10% every year. So, after three years, her annual salary will be $8490 ($7200 x 1.10), and after six years (including the initial five years), it will be $9832 ($8490 x 1.10). Therefore, Sylvie's current annual salary is $9832.;;
Response:  We know that Marilyn's first album sold ten times more than Harald's. So if Marilyn sold 88,000 copies of her album, then Harald sold $\frac{88}{10}$ = $8,800$ copies of his album.;;
Response:  We know that there are 16 guests invited to the party and since 1/4 of them did not show up, we can assume that 4 guests did not come (since 1/4 means 4/16). So, the number of guests who actually came is 16 - 4 = 12. Since each guest requires 2 gift bags, the total number of gift bags needed for the actual guests is 12 x 2 = 24. Therefore, Christina will need 75 - 24 = 51 gift bags in total.;;
Response:  We know that an adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of coleslaw and a child eats half of what an adult does. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, each adult will eat 10 pounds + 5 pounds = 15 pounds of coleslaw. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 15 x 20 = 300 pounds of coleslaw to the picnic.;;
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three times as many marbles as Marcia.
Marcia has two more marbles than Cindy.
Cindy has four marbles.
So, we can write an equation based on these statements:
Let J be the number of marbles Jan has:
J = 3M (given)
Let M be the number of marbles Marcia has:
M = 2C + 4 (given)
Now we need to solve for J:
Substituting M from the second equation into the first one:
J = 3(2C + 4)
Simplifying and solving for J:
J = 6C + 12
Therefore, the total number of marbles among Jan, Marcia, and Cindy is:
Total = J + M + C = 6C + 12 + 4 = 22
So, there are 22 marbles in total among the three girls.";;
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write:
Amy - 5 = Jackson
Jackson + 5 = Corey
Corey - 2 = James
Now we have three equations:
Amy - 5 = Jackson
Jackson + 5 = Corey
Corey - 2 = James
We need to find out what Jackson's age is. To do this, we will solve the first equation for Amy's age:
Amy = Jackson + 5
Substituting the value from the second equation into the third equation:
Corey = James + 2
Solving all these equations simultaneously gives us the following values:
Amy = 9
Jackson = 7
Corey = 10
James = 12
Therefore, Jackson is 7 years old.";;
Response:  We know that Lee ran 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds. If we assume that before changing his diet, Gerald took 42 seconds to run 400 meters with obstacles (which is what Lee did), then after changing his diet, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in 36 seconds (since he improved his speed by 10%). So, if Lee runs 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, then Gerald can run them in approximately 36 seconds.;;
Response:  We know that there are fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined. So, if there are 60 dogs, then there must be less than 60 x 2 = 120 cats + 60 rabbits = 180 animals in total. Therefore, there are 180 domesticated pets in the neighborhood.;;
"Response:  We know that there are 200 students in total and they are divided into 5 classes with equal number of students (so each class has 40 students). Now we need to find out how many boys and girls are in each class. According to the problem, 2/5 of the students are boys and 2/3 of them are girls. So if x is the number of boys in one class, then we can write:
x = 2/5 \* 200 = 80
And if y is the number of girls in one class, then we can write:
y = 2/3 \* 200 = 133
Now we want to find out how many girls are in Skautu. Since 2/3 of the students are girls, and there are 3 classes in Skautu, we can calculate the number of girls in Skautu as follows:
Number of girls in Skautu = 3 \* y = 3 \* 133 = 409
So there are 409 girls in Skautu.";;
Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for 2/3 of that time (i.e., 9/3 = 3), then Harry slept for 9 - 3 = 6 hours more than James. So, Harry slept for 6 hours more than James.;;
Response:  We know that when Freda cooks preserved peppers in her sauce, she loses half of its volume. So if she uses three peppers per serving and there are 32 ounces of sauce left after cooking, we can calculate the number of peppers used as follows: Number of peppers = Volume of sauce after cooking / Volume of sauce per serving x Number of servings Total number of peppers = 32 ounces / 3 peppers/serving x Number of servings = 106 peppers (since there were 32 ounces of sauce left) Therefore, Freda used 106 peppers to make the last batch of paradeck sauce.;;
"Response: 
During the first 15 minutes of traffic jam, some cars pass through (let's say x). Then, during the remaining 15 minutes, another 20 cars pass through (since there are 45 minutes in total). So, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is:
x + 20 = 30
Therefore, 5 cars did not have to go through the traffic jam because they left before it started.";;
Response:  Mary has already 24 (40 - 6) flowerpots in her garden, and she wants to give one pot to each of her friends and family tomorrow. So, she will have 2 x 2 = 4 fewer pots after giving them away. Therefore, Mary will have 24 - 4 = 20 flowerpots left in her garden.;;
Response:  The first friend pressed the bell 20 times before Jerome opened the door, so the second friend pressed it 5 times more than the first (20 x 5 = 100). The third friend pressed it 10 times more than the second (100 x 10 = 1000), and the fourth friend pressed it 60 - 40 = 20 times more than the third (1000 x 20 = 20,000). Therefore, the total number of times the fourth friend pressed the bell was 20,000.;;
Response:  The student has to read 4 pages from their science book, 20 pages from their social studies book, 7 pages from their history book, and 8 pages from their geography book in total. If they have already read 15 pages on Monday, that means they still need to read 395 pages (4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 395) in total. To find out how many pages the student needs to read per day, we can divide the remaining pages by the number of days left: 395 pages / 4 days = 98 pages per day.;;
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, John drinks one glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day, which means he consumes 3 glasses of water per day (1 x 3 = 3). Since it is a workday, John also has one glass of lemonade after dinner, which brings his total daily consumption to 4 glasses of water (3 + 1 = 4). Therefore, John consumes 4 glasses of water per day.;;
"Response:  The distance from the ocean to the city is 42 miles (or 67 kilometers). If it takes 10 minutes for the fog to cover each 3 miles of the city, then it will take:
Time = Distance / Rate
= 67 km / 3 km/minute
= 22.33 minutes

Response:  Poppy has placed 250 pieces (4/10 of the total number) on the board. Then her mother places another 375 pieces (3/10 of the remaining amount). So, there are 625 pieces left to be placed (250 + 375 = 625).;;
Response:  If Cody has three times as many sweets as Amir, and Amir eats 5 sweets, then Cody must have eaten 3 x 5 = 15 sweets. So, together they have eaten 15 + 5 = 20 sweets.;;
"Response:  The volume of each box is calculated as follows: Volume = Length x Width x Height. For the first box, length = 6 palces = 120 cm, width = 5 palces = 75 cm, height = 4 palces = 90 cm. Therefore, the volume of the first box is V1 = 120 x 75 x 90 = 67500 cubic centimeters (cm³). Similarly, for the second and third boxes, we have: V2 = 120 x 75 x 90 = 67500 cm³; V3 = 120 x 75 x 80 = 57000 cm³. Now, to find the total internal volume of all three boxes, we add their volumes: Total volume = V1 + V2 + V3 = 67500 + 67500 + 57000 = 182000 cm³. So, the total internal volume of all three boxes is approximately 182000 cm³.";;
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Frankie watched TV every evening and followed this schedule:
Monday and Tuesday: Watched one hour of his favorite program each night.
Wednesday: Watched several episodes (not specified how many) of a 30-minute show.
Thursday: Finished his homework earlier than usual and watched an additional hour and a half of TV.
Friday: Stayed up late to watch two hours of TV.
So, let's calculate the total number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday:
Wednesday: Watched several episodes of a 30-minute show.
Let x be the number of episodes he watched. Since he watched several episodes, we can assume that x is greater than 1.
Total time spent watching TV on Wednesday = Number of episodes \* 30 minutes per episode
= x \* 30 minutes
Now, let's find out how much time Frankie spent watching TV on Thursday:
Thursday: Watched an additional hour and a half of TV.
Time spent watching TV on Thursday = 1.5 hours
Adding both Wednesday and Thursday's TV time, we get:
Total time spent watching TV = Wednesday + Thursday
= x \* 30 minutes + 1.5 hours
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Total time spent watching TV = 2x + 90 minutes
Now, let's substitute the value we found for x (which is greater than 1):
Total time spent watching TV = 2(greater than 1) + 90 minutes
= 2x + 90 minutes
Therefore, if Frankie watched 7 hours of TV, he must have seen at least 35 30-minute episodes (7 hours / 2x + 90 minutes).";;
Response:  If Henry made 2 times more sundries than he did last time (which means he made 4 times as many this time), and he had 95 sundries left after the competition, then he must have made 385 sundries in total (95 x 4 = 385). Since he lost 5 sundries when they cooled down, he has 380 sundries left (385 - 5 = 380). So, Henry made 380 sundries last time.;;
Response:  If the local gas station sells gasoline for $3 per gallon and offers $20 cashback for each gallon filled at that station, then if someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline, they will have $20 in cashback. Therefore, their total cost for the 10 gallons of gasoline will be $3 x 10 = $30.;;
"Response:  We know that Beatrice had two rolls wide and 24 roles long, while Marcel had three rolls wide and 14 roles long. To find out how much they ate in total, we need to calculate how many pieces each of them ate and then add it up.
For Beatrice, she ate 2 x 24 = 48 pieces.
For Marcel, he ate 3 x 14 = 42 pieces.
So, together they ate 48 + 42 = 90 pieces.";;
Response:  The boat had an accident and started to take in water at a rate of two liters per ten steps (or twenty feet). It took sixteen seconds for the boat to travel twenty feet back towards shore after taking in one liter of water. Therefore, it will take 64 seconds to travel twenty feet if the boat has taken in four liters of water (since each liter takes twice as long to escape as the previous liter). So, there are 64 - 16 = 48 seconds remaining before the boat reaches the shore with four liters of water inside.;;
"Response:  The number of times the table is cleaned per hour can be calculated as follows:

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, so there are 4 lessons in total (2 x 4 teachers).
2. Each lesson lasts for 50 minutes, so there are 50 minutes per hour.
3. Therefore, the number of hours the table is used per day is: 4 lessons / 50 minutes/hour = 8 hours/day.
4. Since the table is cleaned 3 times an hour, the number of times it is cleaned per day is: 8 hours/day x 3 times/hour = 24 times/day.";;
Response:  If Ryan plants two flowers every day in his garden and it takes 15 days for them to grow, then after 15 days he will have planted a total of 30 flowers (2 x 15 = 30). However, if only 5 of these flowers have not grown (i.e., they are still seedlings), then the number of fully grown flowers is 30 - 5 = 25. Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan will have 25 fully grown flowers in his garden.;;
Response:  We know that Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, so if Brittany's phone can hold 50 photos of birds, then Jamal's phone can hold 300 photos (6 x 50 = 300). Now we are told that there are as many birds in Jamal's photo as there are photos he can hold on his phone. So, if Jamal's phone holds 300 photos and each photo has 18 birds, then there are 300 x 18 = 5400 birds in Jamal's photo.;;
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha spent on wood before it increased in price. We know that she bought 10 pieces of 2x4 wood for $10 each, so the total cost was $100 (10 pieces x $10 each). Then, after the price increase, she bought 5 more pieces of 4x4 wood at $16 each, so the total amount of money she spent on wood after the price increase is $80 ($16 x 5 pieces). Now, let's find out how much profit Sasha made from selling her excess wood. She sold all 15 pieces of wood (10 2x4 pieces and 5 4x4 pieces) together, which means she earned $150 (15 pieces x $10 each). So, Sasha made a profit of $70 ($150 - $80).;;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Katy uses lzhickec sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar she uses, she also uses 13 parts of water. Therefore, if she used 120 lzhickec sugar, we can find out how much water she used by multiplying the number of sugar lzhickec by the ratio. So, the amount of water used is 120 x 13 = 1560 ml. Now, since we know the total volume of liquid used (1560 ml) and the proportion of sugar to water (7:13), we can calculate the number of lzhickec sugar used as follows: Number of lzhickec sugar = Total volume of liquid / Proportion of sugar to water = 1560 ml / 7 : 13 = 194 lzhickec sugar.;;
Response:  If John bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, that means he bought a total of 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair cost $60, John paid a total of $360. Therefore, the answer is $360.;;
Response:  We know that the customs officer in the main port of Seaside calculated 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles inside. So, the total number of vehicles was 10 (2 containers x 5 vehicles per container). The next day, they brought more containers and the total number of vehicles in the port increased to 30. Therefore, we can conclude that 20 additional containers were brought (30 - 10 = 20). Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of vehicles brought on the second day is 20 x 5 = 100.;;
"Response:  We know that Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lyla's initial salary and his salary increased by 40% over four years. So, Adrien's new salary is A = (1 + 0.4)A = 1.4A. Now we need to find out what percentage increase in Lyla's salary resulted from this change. The percentage increase in Lyla's salary is L = (Lyla's original salary / Initial Salary of Lyla) x (New Salary of Adrien / Old Salary of Adrien). Therefore, L = ($40,000 / $30,000) x (1.4$30,000 / $30,000) = 25%. So, the final salaries are as follows: Adrien - $68,000; Lyla - $40,000.";;
Response:  If Miguel uses two blocks of paper per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he will use 8 blocks of paper per month. Since each block has 30 sheets of paper, Miguel will use 240 sheets of paper per month (8 blocks x 30 sheets/block).;;
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she contributed (5 + 8) = 13 pieces of fruit in total. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half as many oranges as Morisette, which means he brought (8 / 2) = 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of pieces of fruit contributed by both Morisette and Kael is (13 + 10 + 4) = 27 pieces of fruit.;;
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. If she slept for 2 less hours than that on Tuesday and Wednesday combined (Tuesday + Wednesday = 3 days), then she slept for 6 hours on those two days. So, in total, Sadie slept for 8 + 6 = 14 hours during those three days.;;

Response:  We know that Dylan bought more than 30 sausage rolls (38 kuřecích klobás + 6 rybích klobás). So if he bought x sausage rolls, then he must have bought at least 3x sausage rolls. Therefore, the number of sausage rolls Dylan bought is between 30 and 3x = 90. Since we cannot have a fraction of a sausage roll, the exact number of sausage rolls Dylan bought is 90.;;
Response:  If Amy had 20 friends before moving to a new school and Lily found 50 friends after moving, then together they have 70 friends (Amy + Lily = 70).;;
Response:  The cost of one melon is three times that of a paprika, so the cost of one melon is $3 x 3 = $9. The cost of one pomeranché is five times less than that of a melon, so the cost of one pomeranché is $9 / 5 = $1.80. Therefore, the total cost of buying 4 melons, 20 paprikas, and 10 pomeranches will be: $9 + ($20 x 3) + ($10 x 1) = $69.;;
"Response:  The number of patients per day is given as 500 and each patient is observed for an average of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent observing patients per day is:

Time = Number of patients x Time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes

Now, we need to calculate how much money the hospital earns from these observations. We know that the doctors are paid $150 per hour and the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. So, the total amount earned by the hospital per day can be calculated as follows:

Total income = Number of hours worked by doctors x Salary of doctors + Number of hours used by patients x Charges to patients = (12,000 / 60) x $150 + (12,000 / 60) x $200 = $72,000 + $720,000 = $892,000

Therefore, the hospital earns a total of $892,000 per day from observation sessions alone.";;

Pam and Fred went on the carnival ride together. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, while Fred rode it four times. Then they both decided to go again on the toboggan. If each ride cost 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?
Step-by-step calculation:
1. Pam rode the roller coaster twice = 2 x 6 = 12 tickets
2. Fred rode the roller coaster four times = 4 x 6 = 24 tickets
3. Both of them rode the toboggan twice = 2 x 6 = 12 tickets
Total number of tickets used = 12 + 24 + 12 = 58 tickets
Therefore, the answer is 58 tickets.";;
Response:  On Monday (pondělí), Walter walked 4 miles. On Tuesday (úterý), he walked six times as far as on Monday, so he walked 24 miles (6 x 4 = 24). Therefore, his total distance from Monday to Wednesday was 41 + 24 = 65 miles. So, in Wednesday, he walked 65/3 = 21.7 kilometers.;;

Response:  We know that Brian has 20 video games and he lost 5 of them just before the comparison was made. So, Brian had 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. Now, we are told that Bobby has 5 times fewer video games than Brian. This means that if Brian has 15 video games, then Bobby has 15 / 5 = 3 video games. Therefore, Bobby has 3 video games.;;
"Response:  We know that there are 27 total rhinoceroses left in the world and that two-thirds of them are male (i.e., 2/3 = 0.67). So, we can calculate how many males there are as follows:

Number of males = Total number of rhinos x Proportion of males
= 27 x 0.67
= 18

Now, we know that two-thirds of the remaining rhinos are females (i.e., 2/3 = 0.67), so we can calculate how many females there are as follows:

Number of females = Total number of rhinos - Number of males
= 27 - 18
= 9

Therefore, there are 18 male rhinoceroses and 9 female rhinoceroses in Scotland.";;
"Response:  The total cost of two pieces of each snack is:
For the first snack: 2 x 2 = 4 sušenky @ 7.50$/sušenek = 30.00$
For the second snack: 2 x 2 = 4 sáčky čipů @ 1.50$/sáček = 6.00$
Total cost for both snacks = 30.00 + 6.00 = 36.00$
Now let's calculate the delivery fee: 20% of 36.00 = 7.20$
So the total cost including the delivery fee will be: 36.00 + 7.20 = 43.20$
Finally, she wants to add an additional $5.00 as a tip, so the final cost will be: 43.20 + 5.00 = 48.20$.";;
Response:  If Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions and completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour, then he spent 8/5 = 1.6 hours on the first test. Similarly, if he took 6 hours to complete the second test with 100 questions and completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour, then he spent 6/5 = 1.2 hours on the second test. So, there were 1.6 - 1.2 = 0.4 hours left unanswered in the second test.;;
Response:  If there are 22 red beetles and 4 times as many blue beetles (i.e., 12 blue beetles), then there must be 88 total beetles (22 + 3 x 12 = 88). So, the number of red beetles is 22/88 = 0.25 or 25%.;;
Response:  We know that there are 20 voices for rent and out of those, 12 are automatic, which means they have an automated gearbox. So, the number of automatic vehicles is 12/20 = 0.6 or 60%. Therefore, 60% of the vehicles are automatic.;;
"Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees (drones) as immature bees (queens). So, if there are x worker bees, then there are 2x immature bees. Therefore, we can write an equation:

700 = x + 2(x)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

700 = 3x

Now, dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get:

x = 233

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money each client will pay for the beard oil and hair care products. Each client will buy 2 bottles of beard oil at $2 per bottle, and one package of hair care products at $5 per package. Therefore, each client will pay a total of $10 (2 x $2 + $5). Next, we need to calculate how many clients Lucas can accommodate in a week. Based on the information provided, he has already signed up 3 clients, and he is in talks with another 5 potential clients. If all 8 clients become his customers, they will generate revenue of $80 ($10 x 8 clients). Finally, we need to subtract Lucas's expenses from his revenue to determine his profit. His only expense is the cost of producing the beard oil and hair care products, which is $14 (2 x $2 + $5). Subtracting this amount from his revenue gives us a profit of $66 ($80 - $14). So, Lucas will make $66 per week in profits.;;
"Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land where he grows bananas and each hectare produces 100 bananas. He can harvest them every 3 months. So, in one year, John can harvest:

Number of times he can harvest = Number of months in a year / Time between harvests

Response:  We know that during the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees leaving the hive and then half of those bees returning (which is 15 bees). So, in total, she saw 45 bees leave the hive during the first 6 hours. Then, we are told that each bee that left the hive before and hasn't returned yet will return during the next 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that Debra will see returning to the hive during the last 6 hours is equal to the original number of bees that left the hive minus the number of bees that have already returned (i.e., 45 - 15 = 30). So, Debra will see 30 bees returning to the hive during the last 6 hours.;;
"Response:  We know that Brittany's mom gave $8 in small change to the cashier at the museum entrance. Since the adult ticket costs $12 and the child ticket costs $10, we can calculate the number of tickets purchased as follows:

$8 (small change) / ($12 adult ticket + $10 child ticket) = 0.67

So, Brittany's mom bought 1 ticket for herself and 0.67 tickets for children (since you cannot buy a fraction of a ticket). Therefore, the total number of tickets purchased is:

1 ticket + 0.67 tickets = 1.67 tickets

Therefore, the answer is 1.67 tickets.";;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends. Then we are told that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends, James has 4x friends. Finally, we know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x gives us x = 4. Therefore, James has 4x = 16 friends on Facebook.;;
Response:  We know that Steve lives farther away from school than Tim does, so he will take longer to get home. Specifically, it takes Steve 3 miles / 440 stops per minute = 7 minutes to get home. Since Tim can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 stops per minute, it will take him 3 km / 264 stops per minute = 11 minutes to get home. Therefore, if they start racing at the same time, Tim will arrive at his house before Steve does. So, the answer is 11 minutes.;;

"Response: 
Step 1: Distance traveled by Blake = distance of football field (100 yards) x number of times he ran back and forth (15).
Distance traveled by Blake = 100yd x 15 = 1500yd
Step 2: Distance traveled by Kelly = distance of football field (100 yards) x number of times she ran back and forth (34).
Distance traveled by Kelly = 100yd x 34 = 3400yd
Step 3: To find out who won, we need to subtract the distance traveled by each person from the total distance of the football field (100 yards).
Winner = Total distance - Distance traveled by both players
Total distance = 100yd
Distance traveled by Blake = 1500yd
Distance traveled by Kelly = 3400yd
Winner = 100yd - (1500yd + 3400yd) = -2900yd
Therefore, Kelly is the winner because she traveled a longer distance than Blake.";;

Since Locsin caught fewer than Anakin in each category except for clowns (where he caught more), we can conclude that Locsin caught 4 sea stars, 3 sea horses, and 2 clowns. Therefore, if they both went to the beach together, they would have caught a total of 14 sea stars, 9 sea horses, and 5 clowns.;;
Response:  The price of the bucket increases by 20% every two months, so after one month, the new price will be $10 + (20% of $10) = $10 + $2 = $12. After two months, the new price will be $12 + (20% of $12) = $12 + $2.4 = $14.40. And so on... So, after 36 months, the price of the bucket will be $10 + (20% of $10) + (20% of $14.40) +... + (20% of $57.60) = $10 + $2 + $4.8 +... + $192 = $304.

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays each month for her debts. For example, she owes $300 per month for her student loans and $200 per month for her credit card bill. Therefore, her total monthly payments are $500 ($300 + $200). Now, if she wants to pay more than the minimum payment each month, let's assume that she wants to pay half of what she earns above the minimum payment. So, if she makes an extra payment of $150 per month (half of $300), then her total monthly payment will be $650 ($500 + $150). To find out how much she will pay in a year, we can multiply this amount by 12: $650 x 12 = $78,000.;;

Now, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. Since Rani has 12 more crabs than Monica, Rani has 36 + 12 = 48 crabs. Therefore, the total number of crabs that all three have together is 48 + 36 + 40 = 124 crabs.;;
"Response:  If Lloyd earns $10 per hour for teaching math and he taught for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week, then his total earnings for both weeks are:
First week: 5 hours x $10/hour = $50
Second week: 8 hours x $10/hour = $80
Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 ($50 + $80) for the first two weeks.";;
Response:  The number of students in the class is 80 and there are two candidates running for the position of representative. If one candidate received 3/4 of the votes, then they must have received at least 60 votes (since 3/4 of 80 is 60). Therefore, the number of votes received by the losing candidate is 20 (80 - 60 = 20).;;
"Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white carnations and 5 times more red lilies than white carnations. So, if she received x red roses and y white carnations, we can write:
x = 4y (red roses)
x = 5y (red lilies)
We also know that Sandra threatened to change suppliers unless she received her order within five hours. Therefore, we must find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver in order for Sandra not to be unhappy with him.
So, let's solve the system of equations:
x + 4y = 4(5) = 20 (Sandra ordered 200 red lilies)
x + 4y = 4(5) = 16 (Sandra ordered 160 red roses)
Solving the system, we get:
x = 8
y = 4
Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 8 red roses and 4 white carnations to satisfy Sandra's demands and avoid losing her as a customer.";;
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:
Jean is two years older than Mark.
Mark was five years older than Jan two years ago.
Jan is currently 30 years old.
From these statements, we can deduce that:
Age of Jean = Age of Mark + 2 (since Jean is two years older than Mark)
= 30 + 2 = 32 years old.
Therefore, Jean is 32 years old.";;
"Response:  The first team has four members who each run 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds per person, for a total time of 2200 seconds (or 36 minutes). For the second team, we know that their first member runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means their total time is also 2200 seconds. However, since each subsequent member runs faster than the previous one by 3 seconds, the total time for the second team will be lower than that of the first team. To find out how much lower, we can calculate the total time for each member of the second team and then subtract it from the total time of the first team. So, let's do that:

Second team:

* First member: 60 + 3 = 63 seconds
* Second member: 57 + 3 = 60 seconds
* Third member: 54 + 3 = 57 seconds
* Fourth member: 51 + 3 = 54 seconds
Total time: 63 + 60 + 57 + 54 = 284 seconds

Now, let's compare this to the total time of the first team: 2200 seconds. Since the second team's total time is shorter than the first team's by 660 seconds (284 - 2200), we can conclude that the second team will win by 660 seconds or 10 minutes and 6 seconds.";;
Response:  The probability of throwing a six-sided die and getting an even number is $\frac{3}{6}$, since there are $3$ even numbers ($0$, $2$, and $4$) out of $6$ possible outcomes. Similarly, the probability of throwing a six-sided die and getting an odd number is also $\frac{3}{6}$. Therefore, the probability of throwing a number greater than $3$ in two consecutive throws is $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{50\%$.;;
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked half of the apples (which is 10), then Jenna picked 5 apples (half of what her mother picked). So, Jenna picked 5 apples.;;
Response:  We know that there are three groups of mice and each group has six mice. So, the total number of mice is 3 x 6 = 18. Now, we also know that each mouse in the kingfisher's nest gets 5 pieces of food, so the total amount of food given to all the mice is 18 x 5 = 90. Finally, we know that there are 20 pieces of food left over after giving them to the mice, so the remaining food is 90 - 20 = 70. Therefore, there are 18 mice in each cage.;;
"Response:  If Mandy owes $100 to Benedict and agrees to pay him monthly interest of 2%, then after 3 months, she will owe:

$100 x (1 + 0.02/12) = $104

So, Mandy should give Benedict $104 after 3 months.";;
"Response:  We know that the cost of transporting each barrel from the farm to the warehouse is $2, and the profit made by the trader after selling all the barrels at $30 per barrel is $400. So we can write an equation as follows: 

$2 x number of barrels = total cost of transportation

$30 x number of barrels = total revenue

Subtracting the total cost of transportation from the total revenue gives us the profit made by the trader:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost of transportation
= $30 x number of barrels - $2 x number of barrels

Now we are given that the trader sold all the barrels, so the number of barrels he sold is equal to the total number of barrels produced. Therefore, we can substitute this value in the above equation to find the profit made by the trader:

Profit = $30 x number of barrels sold - $2 x number of barrels sold
= $30 x total number of barrels - $2 x total number of barrels

We are also told that the price paid by the merchant for each barrel was $20, so we can use this value to calculate the total amount spent by the merchant on all the barrels:

Total amount spent by merchant = Price paid per barrel x Number of barrels purchased
= $20 x total number of barrels

Finally, we can use the fact that the trader made a profit of $400 to find the number of barrels he sold:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost of transportation
= $400 - ($2 x total number of barrels)

Solving for the total number of barrels sold, we get:

Number of barrels sold = Profit / (Price paid per barrel - Transportation cost per barrel)
= $400 / ($20 - $2)
= 20 barrels

Therefore, the trader sold 20 barrels of wheat.";;
"Response:  Firstly, they spent $20.25 for three tickets to the fair. Then, they spent less than $4.50 on food. Finally, they took two different trips that cost $33 each. So, if they divided their expenses equally among themselves, each person would pay:
$20.25 + ($4.50 / 3) = $24.75 per person
Therefore, each person would pay $24.75.";;
Response:  If John can collect 3 hours of broccoli in total and he can collect 2 broccolis per minute, then we need to calculate how many minutes it takes him to collect all those broccolis. So, if he collects 3 hours of broccoli, that means he collected 3 x 60 = 180 minutes of broccoli. Now, since he can collect 2 broccolis per minute, he has collected 180 / 2 = 90 broccolis in total. Therefore, John collects 90 broccolis.;;
"Response:  If each mouse needs to eat 3.5 pounds of food per week to survive, and there are ten mice in total, then we can calculate how much food they need to eat daily as follows:

Total weight of food needed per week = Weight of food needed per day x Number of days in a week
= 3.5 pounds/week x 7 days/week
= 24.5 pounds/week

So, the ten mice would need to eat approximately 24.5 pounds (or 11 kilograms) of food per week.";;
"Response: 
Year 1: Tom plants 10 trees and cuts 2 trees per year, so he has 98 trees (50 + 48).
Year 2-10: He continues to plant and cut trees at the same rate, so he has 98 x 10 = 980 trees after 10 years.
Year 11: After 10 years, 30% of the trees have died, which is 30% of 980 = 297 trees. So, Tom still has 683 trees left (980 - 297).";;
Response:  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 red plastic flamingos in front of Sue's house. In Saturday morning, they took back one-third of these flamingos and painted them white. They then returned these newly painted white flamingos to Sue's front yard. Finally, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 red plastic flamingos to the collection. So, at noon on Sunday, there were more red plastic flamingos outside than white ones. Therefore, the answer is: More red plastic flamingos than white ones.;;
Response:  If Violetta wants to buy new pastels in five different colors and has $20 for this purchase, she will need 10 pastelks (20/2 = 10). Since each pastel costs $2, Violetta will have to pay $20 x 5 = $100 for all the pastelks she needs. So, the answer is $100.;;

Response:  We have to divide 200 kg of meat among 40 restaurants. Each restaurant will get half a kilogram of meat. To find out how much meat each restaurant won't use, we need to subtract half a kilogram from 200 kg. So, the answer is: 195 kg (200 - 0.5);;
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in the city of Soda. Of these, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. That means that the total number of adults (men + women) is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. Now, we need to find out how many children there are in Soda. To do this, we can subtract the number of adults from the total population: 23786 - 17509 = 6277. Therefore, there are 6277 children living in Soda.;;
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. Then in the second month, she found three times as many cards (3 x 20 = 60). So now she has 80 cards total. In the third month, she found twice as many cards as in the previous two months combined (2 x (60 + 20) = 140), so now she has 140 Pokémon cards. Therefore, Elaine currently has 140 Pokémon cards.;;
"Response: 
Mark edits 1000 sentences for two publishers each week and receives different payments from them. Publisher A pays him twice as much as Publisher B. So, if Publisher A pays $5 per sentence, Publisher B pays $2.5 per sentence.
To find out how much Mark earns in total, we need to multiply the number of sentences he edits (1000) by the payment he receives from each publisher. For Publisher A, it's $5 x 1000 = $5,000; for Publisher B, it's $2.5 x 1000 = $2,500.
So, Mark earns a total of $7,500 ($5,000 + $2,500) per week.";;
"Response:

Response:  If John received the award at the beginning of the year and his salary is $2000 per week, then he will have earned $104,000 in that year ($2000 x 52 weeks). The additional amount he received as a prize is $5000, so his total earnings for the year are $109,000 ($104,000 + $5000).;;
Response:  We know that Josie has a 10-acre farm and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. So, in total, she will produce 50 tons (5 x 10) of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the number of barrels produced as follows: Number of barrels = Total amount of grapes x Yield per grape Ton of grapes = 50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.;;
"Response: 
Carlovo oblíbené jídlo je sýr (statement 1).
He had a sandwich for lunch every day and used 2 pieces of cheese per sandwich (statements 2 and 3).
On three days he had an egg omelette for breakfast and used one piece more cheese than on the sandwiches (statements 4 and 5).
He made a large macaroni and cheese dish that lasted him several meals and used 8 pieces of cheese in it (statement 6).
Now, let's calculate how many pieces of cheese Carlo used in total:
Total number of pieces of cheese used = Number of pieces of cheese used per sandwich x Number of sandwiches eaten + Number of pieces of cheese used in omelettes x Number of omelettes eaten + Number of pieces of cheese used in macaroni and cheese dish
= 2 x 7 + 1 x 3 + 8
= 15
Therefore, Carlo used 15 pieces of cheese in total.";;
"Response:  We know that Janet had initially 22 green and 10 yellow perches. Then she bought 6 baskets of blue perches, which contained 9 perches each. Finally, she bought 2 baskets of red perches, which contained 6 perches each. So, in total, Janet has:

Green perches = 22 + (6 x 9) = 43
Yellow perches = 10
Blue perches = (6 x 9) = 54
Red perches = 2 x 6 = 12
Therefore, Janet has a total of 43 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 127 perches.";;
"Response:  If Brinley has an average score of 90 after five tests (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458), then her average score for all six tests will be:

Average score after 6 tests = Average score after 5 tests x Number of tests
= 458 x 6
= 2740

So, to get an average score of 93, Brinley needs to have a score of at least 2740 / 6 = 460 on the sixth test.";;
"Response: 
Michael rode his bike at least five times a week and covered an average distance of 25 kilometers each time. He did this for four weeks before deciding to reduce his frequency but increase his distance per ride. Specifically, he decided to ride twice a week instead of five times a week, and cover a distance of 60 kilometers each time. How many kilometers did Michael cover in total during these three weeks?
To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how many kilometers Michael covered each week, and then add up those amounts over the three-week period.
Let's break it down like this:
* Week 1: Michael rode his bike at least 5 times/week x 25 km/ride = 125 km/week
* Week 2: Michael rode his bike 4 times/week x 25 km/ride = 100 km/week
* Week 3: Michael rode his bike 2 times/week x 60 km/ride = 120 km/week
Total distance traveled by Michael during these three weeks = 125 + 100 + 120 = 345 km
Therefore, Michael covered a total distance of 345 kilometers during these three weeks.";;
Response:  We know that each chocolate stick weighs twice as much as each candy corn. So if one chocolate stick weighs 40 grams, two chocolate sticks will weigh 80 grams (since they double in weight). Now, let's find out how many chocolate sticks are in the jar. There are 25 chocolate sticks and 80 candy corns in total. Therefore, there are 3 chocolate sticks for every 4 candy corns. So, if there are 40 grams of chocolate per stick, then there are 120 grams of chocolate in the jar ( since there are 3 sticks per 4 candies). Thus, Joe's bag contains 120 grams of chocolate.;;
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 donuts. On Tuesday, she bought 3 times as many kolaches as she did on Monday (so 12 kolaches). On Wednesday, she bought 5 times as many kolaches as she did on Tuesday (so 60 kolaches). Therefore, Rose bought a total of 78 donuts and 60 kolaches in three days.;;
Response:  We know that 200 grams of coffee costs $1200 less than the total price of half a cup sold for $6000 per piece. So we can write an equation as follows: Half-cup = x + $1200 (where x is the cost of one gram of coffee). Now, since there are 300 grams in a full cup, we have: Full cup = 3x + $1200. Substituting this into the first equation gives us: Half-cup = 3(x + $1200) + $1200. Simplifying and solving for x, we get: x = $4500 / 3 = $1500 per gram of coffee. Therefore, the total cost of one gram of coffee is $1500.;;
"Response: 
Sara wants to buy a new backpack and two pairs of shoes. The cost of the backpack is $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara earns $5 for each time she babysits her neighbor's children, and her parents give her $4 for each time she mows the lawn. If Sara had saved $10 before starting to babysit, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the backpack and shoes?
Let's break it down:
Total cost of backpack + total cost of shoes = $30 + $20 x 2 = $80
Amount earned from babysitting = $5 x number of times she babysits = $5x
Amount given by parents = $4 x number of times she mows the lawn = $4x
Total amount available = Amount earned + Amount given = ($5x) + ($4x)
Subtracting the total amount available from the total cost gives us the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn:
$80 - ($5x + $4x) = $80 - ($9x) = 9
So Sara needs to mow the lawn 9 times to save enough money to buy the backpack and shoes.";;
Response:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and each red hen lays 3 eggs per day, so there are 13 red hens (since 42 / 3 = 13). Now we need to find out how many white hens there are. According to the problem, if there are more than twice as many white hens as red hens, then there must be x white hens where x is greater than 13. So, the number of white hens is 2x - 13. Since Jerry has collected 42 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by all the hens in one day is 3x + 2(2x - 13) = 69.;;
Response:  The perimeter of an oblong is given as 1.5 x 6 = 9 miles. If he walks at a speed of 5 km/h, we can convert it to meters per hour using the conversion factor: 1 km / 0.621371 = 1.609344 m/h (using the conversion factor between kilometers and hours). Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends walking along the path: distance = perimeter / speed = 9 miles / 1.609344 m/h = 5.61 hours. So, Gary spends approximately 5.61 hours walking along the path in the park.;;
Response:  On day one, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. If there were 50 more customers on the second day than on the first day, then on the third day, there would be 50 + 50 = 100 additional customers. Therefore, the total number of customers on the third day was 500 (100 + 400).;;
"Response:  We know that Jerry has two pools with draining holes emptied at 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small one. The big pool now has four times more water than the small one. So, if we let x be the amount of water in the small pool initially, we can write the equation:
x + (2x) = 8
Simplifying the equation:
3x = 8
Dividing both sides by 3:
x = 2
So, the small pool originally held 2 gallons of water.";;
Response:  To calculate how many hours she needs to work, we need to find out how much money she will have after buying shoes and socks. The total cost of the shoes and socks is $320 + $32 = $352.

"Response:  We know that $2000 is the initial amount borrowed and that $200 will be paid back with an additional 10% of the remaining balance as interest. So, if Janet pays $165 per month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay back is:

$2000 x (1 - 0.10) = $1800

So, there will be $200 left over after Janet pays back the loan in full.";;
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the weight and it is worth $7 more than roses. So, if we divide the amount of money by the price of one rose, we will get the number of roses in the weight. Therefore, the answer is 4 x 7 = 28 roses.;;
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet is half as old as Zack. So, we can write:
Adrian = 3Harriet
Harriet = Zack/2
Now, if Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can substitute this value into one of the equations:
Adrian = 3(21)
= 63
So, the average age of all three (Adrian, Harriet, and Zack) over the last three years is 63 years.";;
"Response:  We know that Jojo got x number of points. Since Yuri gained 10 more than Naomi and Brianna gained 17 more than Naomi, we can write it as follows:
Yuri scored (x + 10) = 98
Brianna scored (x + 17) = 105
Now, we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. So, we subtract the score of Yuri from the total score:
Total score = 251
Jojo scored (251 - (x + 10)) = 132
Therefore, Jojo scored 132 points in the game.";;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, it takes Carmen 10 minutes to complete one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to complete one Sudoku. Since she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudokus during the weekend, we need to calculate the total time she spent solving these puzzles as follows: Time = Number of puzzles x Time per puzzle So, Total time = 3 x 10 minutes + 8 x 5 minutes = 45 minutes + 40 minutes = 85 minutes Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 85 minutes playing crossword puzzles and Sudokus during the weekend.;;
Response:  We know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank for irrigation and we want to find out how much water is left in the tank after she did that. So, let X be the amount of water left in the tank. According to the problem statement, Celine was able to collect twice as much rainwater as what was left in the tank after she used the water from the tank for irrigation. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: 2X = 120 - 90. Solving for X gives us: X = 30 liters. So, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank after Celine used some of it for irrigation.;;
Response:  We know that Andy has 90 geraniums and less than 40 petunias. So, if he has x petunias, then we can write an equation as follows: 90 + x = 40. Now, let's solve for x: x = 50. Therefore, Andy has 50 petunias.;;
Response:  The company spends $15,000 on advertising in year 1 and then spends one-third of that amount ($5,000) in year 2. So, the total amount spent on advertising over both years is: $15,000 + ($5,000 / 3) = $20,000. Therefore, the company has spent a total of $20,000 on advertising over the two years.;;

Therefore, the answer is 2 days.";;
"Response:  If James has 30 fire-type cards, that means there are 30/60 = 0.5 (or 50%) of his cards that are fire-type. Similarly, if he has 20 grass-type cards, then there are 20/60 = 0.33 (or 33%) of his cards that are grass-type. Finally, if he has 40 water-type cards, then there are 40/60 = 0.67 (or 67%) of his cards that are water-type.
Now, let's say he loses 8 water-type cards and buys 14 new ones. The total number of water-type cards he has after this is 40 - 8 = 32, and the total number of new cards he bought is 14. So, the proportion of water-type cards in his deck after these events is 32/60 = 0.53 (or 53%).
Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen card from James' deck will be a water-type card is 0.53 or 53%.";;
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate the total cost of basic burrito without any additional toppings or discounts: $6.50 (basic price). Then, we need to add the costs of each additional item that Chad added to his burrito: $2 (for meat), $1 (for cheese), $1 (for avocado), and $0.25 (for sauce) = $4.45. So far, Chad has spent $10.95 ($6.50 + $4.45). Now, he decided to upgrade his meal with chicken for an additional $3, so the final amount he owes is $13.95 ($10.95 + $3).;;
Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can add half of that (which is 2 pieces per minute), then together they will be able to add 8 pieces per minute. To find out how many hours it will take them to complete the task, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of minutes they can add per hour. In this case, there are 360 pieces in total, so if they work at their maximum capacity, it will take them 45 hours to finish the task (360 / 8 = 45).;;
"Response: 
Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30% of the small watermelons were ready for harvesting. She took them home. When she returned after two weeks, three-quarters of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvesting, so she collected them. Therefore, there were 70% of the original number of watermelons left unharvested after two weeks.
So, the number of small watermelons not yet ready for harvesting after two weeks is:
70% of 120 = 84
Therefore, the answer is 84.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Mark will spend on buying all 12 cars. Since each car costs $20,000, he will have spent a total of $240,000 ($20,000 x 12). Then, there is a 10% tax on each car, which means that Mark will pay an additional $2,000 per car (10% of $20,000). So, for all 12 cars, he will have paid a total of $26,000 in taxes ($2,000 x 12). Finally, there is also a registration fee of $1,000 per car. Therefore, the total amount that Mark will pay for all 12 cars is $286,000 ($240,000 + $26,000 + $12,000).;;

"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and Joan is five years older than Jessie. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Mary = Joan - 2
Joan = Jessie + 5
Now, we need to add these equations together to find the total age of all three girls:
Mary + Joan + Jessie =?
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Mary + (Joan - 2) + Jessie = 20
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3Mary + Joan + Jessie = 20
Solving for Mary, we get:
Mary = 6
So, Mary is six years old. Now, substituting this value back into one of the original equations, we get:
Joan = Jessie + 5
Substituting Joan = 6 + 5 = 11, we get:
Jessie = 14
Therefore, the sum of their ages is 20.";;
Response:  We know that there are 1000 students in one school hall and three exits (A, B, and C). If 30% of the students left through exit A, then we can assume that 300 students left through exit A. Now, if 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, then we have 300 / 5 = 60 students left through exit B. Finally, if the remaining 400 students left through exit C, then we have 400 students who left through exit C. Therefore, the total number of students who left through exit C is 400. So, the answer is 400.;;
Response:  We know that James has more than 6 candies and less than 12 candies. So, he must have exactly 9 candies. Now we know that John has twice as many candies as James, so John has 9 x 2 = 18 candies. Finally, we know that Robert has fewer candies than both James and John, so Robert has 18 - (9 + 9) = 9 candies. Therefore, John has 18 candies more than James.;;
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then they can read together for a total of 3 books (2 + 1 = 3).;;
"Response: 
Mike has five friends and he stopped being a correspondent with two of them. Each friend sends him two letters per week, which are 5 pages long each. Mike replies to each letter in the same way, writing one page every 6 minutes. So, how many hours does Mike spend writing letters per week?
Let's break it down:
Number of letters received from friends per week = Number of friends x Number of letters per friend per week = 5 x 2 = 10 letters per week
Time taken to write one page = 6 minutes
Total time spent writing letters per week = Total number of letters written per week x Time taken to write one page = 10 letters/week x 6 minutes/page = 60 minutes/week
Therefore, Mike spends 60 minutes (or 1 hour) per week writing letters to his friends.";;
Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 minutes in total for the month and he spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day. So, he talks to his boss for 15 x 30 = 450 minutes in a month. Now, we need to find out how many minutes he spent talking to other people. He had 300 minutes of calls with them this month. Therefore, he spent (300 - 450) = -150 minutes talking to other people. Since it is not possible to have negative minutes, let's round up the answer to 0 minutes. So, Jason has 0 minutes left after talking to his boss and others.;;
"Response:  We know that:
* Griffin had 24 marbles initially.
* Kyle took 5 marbles from Griffin.
* Billy took twice as many marbles as Kyle (i.e., 10 marbles).
* Ginger gave Griffin some of her marbles (but we don't know how many).
* Colby took 3 fewer marbles than Kyle (i.e., -3 marbles).

So, let's summarize what happened:
Griffin started with 24 marbles, and then:

* Kyle took 5 marbles, leaving Griffin with 19 marbles.
* Billy took 10 marbles, leaving Griffin with 9 marbles.
* Ginger gave Griffin some marbles (but we don't know how many), so let's say she gave him x marbles.
* Colby took -3 marbles, leaving Griffin with 9 + x marbles.

Now, if Griffin ended up with 27 marbles, that means he must have had 9 + x marbles at one point, since he started with 24 marbles and lost some along the way. So, we can set up the equation:

9 + x = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 18

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 18 marbles.";;
Response:  In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails and in the second aquarium, there are 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish, how many snails will be in each aquarium? So, we can conclude that there are 8 snails in each aquarium (4 + 8 = 12).;;
"Response: 
Jeansova make-upová umělkyně dostane $ 250 per hour for her work. She works for 6 hours a day and 4 times a week, which means she works for a total of 24 hours per week (6 x 4 = 24).
The movie lasts for five weeks, so she will work for a total of 120 hours during the entire project ($ 250/hour x 120 hours = $ 30,000).
Since she worked for 120 hours, she gets a 10% discount on her fee, which is $ 3,600 (10% of $ 30,000). Therefore, Jean earned $ 26,400 for working on the film ($ 30,000 - $ 3,600 = $ 26,400).";;
Response:  We know that Isabella spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on gifts for her little sister's birthday, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on gifts for the guests. To find out how much each parent paid, we need to divide these amounts equally among them. So, if there are three parents, they will pay $12 / 3 = $4 each on ingredients, $43 / 3 = $14 each on gifts, $15 / 3 = $5 each on decorations, $4 / 3 = $1.33 each on invitations, and $22 / 3 = $7.67 each on gifts for the guests. Therefore, each parent paid $4 + $14 + $5 + $1.33 + $7.67 = $30.33 in total.;;
Response:  The chef bought 4 baskets of cabbage. Each basket weighs 50 pounds. Half a kilo of cabbage costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the cabbage is: 4 x 50 = 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300. So, the chef spent $300.;;
"Response:  On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister and her sister ate twice as many cookies as she did. So, if Sue ate x cookies on Monday, then her sister ate 2x cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so they both ate x/2 cookies. Since Sue ate 5 cookies on Monday and her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, we can set up the equation:

Sue’s total cookie consumption = 4(Monday) + 2(Tuesday) = 8x + 6
Her sister’s total cookie consumption = 2(Monday) + Tuesday = 4x + 7
Since Sue consumed more than her sister, we know that Sue’s total cookie consumption is greater than her sister’s total cookie consumption. Therefore, we can solve for x:

8x + 6 > 4x + 7
x > 13
So, Sue ate more than 13 cookies in total.";;
