"Response: 
Janet has 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 at breakfast and uses 4 to make muffins for her friends. That means she has 9 eggs left over each day.
She sells these eggs at the farmer's market for $2 each. So, how much does she earn each day?
Well, if she has 9 eggs left over each day and sells them for $2 each, then she earns $18 ($9 x $2) each day from selling her excess eggs."
Response:  We know that the blue fiber requires 2 rolls and half of it is white fiber. So we need to find out how much white fiber is required. Half of the blue fiber means that for every 2 rolls of blue fiber, there will be one roll of white fiber. Therefore, the number of rolls of white fiber needed = (1/2) x 2 = 1 roll. Now, let's add this to the original quantity of blue fiber, which gives us a total of 3 rolls of fiber needed. Answer: 3 rolls
Response:  The value of the house after renovation is 150% of its original price, which means it has increased to $120,000 ($80,000 x 1.5). Since Josh invested $50,000 in the restoration, his profit would be: Profit = Selling Price - Cost = $120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. So, he realized a profit of $70,000 from the sale of the renovated house.
Response:  Jacques does 3 series of 3 sprints per week, so he does 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week. Each sprint is 60 meters long, so in total, he runs 9 x 60 = 540 meters per week. Therefore, he runs 540 meters per week.
Response:  We know that Wendi gives her chickens three meals per day with 3 bolts of mixed feed for each meal. So in total she gives them 9 bolts of food (3 x 3 = 9) per day. Since there are 20 chickens in the coop, we need to divide the total amount of food given to the number of chickens to find out how many bolts of food each chicken gets. Therefore, the last repast of the day will have 9/20 = 0.45 bolts of food per chicken.
Response:  If one glass costs $5, then two glasses cost $\$5 + \$5 = \$10$. Now, if we buy 16 glasses, each at 60% of the previous price, the cost of the 16th glass will be $\$10 \times 0.6 = \$6$. So, in total, Kylar will have to pay $\$10 + \$6 = \$16$ for the 16 glasses.
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and four times as many as Seattle. So, if Toulouse has x sheep, Charleston has 2x sheep, and Seattle has 4x sheep. The total number of sheep in all three cities is equal to the sum of their individual numbers. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 4x = 20. Simplifying this equation, we get: 7x = 60. Dividing both sides by 7, we find that each city has approximately 85 sheep (rounded to the nearest whole number). So, Toulouse has 170 sheep (2 x 85), Charleston has 160 sheep (2 x 85), and Seattle has 35 sheep (4 x 85).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla has downloaded 40% of the file (i.e., 80 GB) before the system restarted. After the restart, she needs to start downloading from the beginning, which means she will cover the remaining 60% of the file (i.e., 120 GB). So, in total, it will take her approximately 160 minutes (or 2 hours and 40 minutes) to download the entire file of 200 GB.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Jean drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, which means he covered a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles
Now, after making a U-turn and driving back home, he lost 2 hours in traffic jams, so his total time taken to reach home was:
Total Time = 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours
During this 2 hours, he drove at an average speed of 30 mph (as mentioned in the question), so he covered a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 2 hours = 60 miles
Finally, he drove the remaining 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 2 hours = 160 miles
Therefore, the total distance traveled by Jean from his starting point to his home is:
Total Distance = Addition of all distances = 180 miles + 60 miles + 160 miles = 300 miles
So, Jean separated himself from his home by approximately 300 miles during those 4 hours."
Response:  If Elisa worked for 40 hours at $10/hour, her total earnings for those hours would be $400 (40 x $10). Then, if she worked an additional 5 hours at $10/hour, her total earnings for those extra hours would be $50 ($5 x $10). So, her total earnings for the week would be $450 ($400 + $50).
"Response: 

Month 1: New program was downloaded 60 times.

Month 2: New program was downloaded 3 x 60 = 180 times (since it increased by 3 times).

Month 3: New program was downloaded 60 - 30% = 42 times (since it decreased by 30%).

Total downloads in 3 months = 60 + 180 + 42 = 382 times."
"Response:  The cost of each type of pastry is given as follows:
Beignets: 3 x 68 = 204$
Petit gâteau: 2 x 80 = 160$
Petit gâteau au fromage: 6 x 55 = 330$
Total cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694$"
Response:  First year, no fruit will be produced so there is no revenue. Second year, 7 citrons will be produced and sold for $1,5 each, resulting in total revenue of $10.5 ($7 x $1,5). Third year, 14 citrons will be produced (7 x 2) and sold for $10.5 ($10.5 x $1,5), resulting in total revenue of $14.75 ($10.5 + $4.25). Fourth year, 21 citrons will be produced (7 x 3) and sold for $15.75 ($15.75 x $1,5), resulting in total revenue of $26.87 ($15.75 + $11.12). Fifth year, 28 citrons will be produced (7 x 4) and sold for $21.25 ($21.25 x $1,5), resulting in total revenue of $36.38 ($26.87 + $9.51). Sixth year, 35 citrons will be produced (7 x 5) and sold for $31.25 ($31.25 x $1,5), resulting in total revenue of $46.88 ($36.38 + $10.50). Seventh year, 42 citrons will be produced (7 x 6) and sold for $40 ($40 x $1,5), resulting in total revenue of $60 ($46.88 + $13.12). Eighth year, 50 citrons will be produced (7 x 7) and sold for $45 ($45 x $1,5), resulting in total revenue of $67.50 ($60 + $7.50). Nine years after planting, Carlos will start to make money from his lemon tree. 
Response:  At first, Mélanie had x aspirateurs. She sold a third of them at home (x/3 = 10), then she sold two more at another house (x/3 = 8), and finally she sold half of what was left at yet another house (x/6 = 4). So, initially Mélanie had x = 20 aspirateurs.
Response:  We know that 20% of the students are enrolled in contemporary dance and 25% are enrolled in jazz dance. So, we can say that 60% (20 + 25) of the students are enrolled in either contemporary or jazz dance. This means that the remaining 40% (100 - 60) of the students are enrolled in other types of dance, which is equal to 20%. Therefore, 20% of the students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.
"Response:  If we assume that the value of the bijoux increases by 2.5% and the value of the gadgets decreases by 1.2%, then...

Step 1: Calculate the new values of the bijoux and gadgets after one month.
New value of bijoux = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125
New value of gadgets = $8,000 x (1 - 0.012) = $7,960

Step 2: Compare the new values of the two options to determine which one has increased more in value.
$5,125 > $7,960 (so the value of the bijoux has increased more).

Step 3: Determine the maximum profit for the merchant based on their choice.
If the merchant chooses to buy the bijoux, they will make a profit of $425 ($5,125 - $4,700). If they choose to buy the gadgets, they will make a profit of $1,040 ($8,000 - $7,960). In either case, the merchant will maximize their profit by choosing the option with the higher increase in value.
Therefore, the merchant's profit at the end of the month would be $425 or $1,040, depending on which option they choose."
Response:  On day one, both trains travel west for 80 miles each. So, the total distance traveled by both trains together is 160 miles (80 + 80). On day two, they travel north for 150 miles. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains together during these two days is 310 miles (160 + 150).
"Response:  As an instructor, Jill earns $20 per hour and works for 35 hours per week, which means she makes $700 per week ($20 x 35 hours). Since she works for 50 weeks in a year, her annual income as an instructor is $35,000 ($700 x 50 weeks). 
As an cheerleading coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works for 15 hours per week, which means she makes $450 per week ($30 x 15 hours). Again, since she works for 50 weeks in a year, her annual income as a cheerleading coach is $22,500 ($450 x 50 weeks). 
So, Jill's total annual salary is $57,500 ($35,000 + $22,500)."
Response:  Since Claire has an omelette of 3 eggs every morning, she will have eaten 3 x 21 = 63 eggs in one month (since there are 21 days in a month). Therefore, in 4 weeks (which is equal to 2 months), she will have eaten 63 x 2 = 126 eggs. So, Claire will have consumed 126 douzains (or dozens) of eggs in 4 weeks.
"Response:  We know that Marissa has already covered 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed for those 4 miles is 4 miles/hour. Then she covers the next 2 miles in 1 hour, so her speed for those 2 miles is also 4 miles/hour. Therefore, to find out what speed she needs to maintain to cover the remaining distance of 6 miles, we can set up the following equation:
Speed = Distance / Time
In this case, the time it takes her to cover the remaining distance is:
Time = Total distance - Distance already covered
= 12 miles - 4 miles + 4 miles
= 8 miles
So, her speed needed to maintain to cover the remaining distance is:
Speed = Distance / Time
= 6 miles / 8 miles
= 3/4 mile/hour or 0.75 miles/hour
Therefore, Marissa must maintain a speed of approximately 0.75 miles per hour to cover the remaining distance of 6 miles."
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that is two-thirds water and 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three-quarters water. When we mix them together, we get 24 liters of mixed juice. If we subtract one liter of orange juice from this mixture, then there are 23 liters of mixed juice left. So, the amount of water in the remaining 23 liters is:

23 liters x (3/4) = 16.25 liters

Therefore, there are 16.25 liters of water in the 24 liters of mixed juice."
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, we know that:
Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha (born when she was 25)
Raymond had his son at the age of 23
Samantha is now 31 years old
So, if Raymon has a son who is currently 31 years old, then he must be 27 years old (31 - 6 = 27)."
"Response: 
1st client - 1 DVD
2nd client - 2 DVDs (since he bought 2)
3rd client - 1 DVD (since he only bought one)
4th and 5th clients - 2 DVDs each (since they both bought 2)
6th client - none (since he didn't buy any)
Total number of DVDs sold = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 6
Therefore, Billy has sold 6 DVDs on Tuesday."
Response:  The bougie loses 2 cm every hour, so it will lose 48 cm (2 x 24) during the 5 hours between 13h and 17h. Therefore, after those 5 hours, the bougie will have lost a total of 48 + 2 = 50 cm.
Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book at $19.50 after a discount of 25%. So we can write an equation as follows: Book price = Original price - (Discount percentage x Original price) Book price = $19.50 - (25% x $19.50) Book price = $19.50 - $4.875 Book price = $14.625 Now, we need to find the original price of the book. To do this, we divide the book price by the discount percentage and multiply it by the original price: Original price = Book price / (Discount percentage x Book price) Original price = $14.625 / (25% x $14.625) Original price = $19.50 Therefore, the original price of the book was $19.50.
"Response:  We know that Marie has paid 50 dollars for her meal. From this information, we can calculate the cost of each item as follows:

* The plate of chicken costs 12$.
* Each carton of milk costs 3$.
* Each apple costs 1.50$.
* Each box of pizza costs 8.50$.

Now let's use these values to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie has ordered. We know that Marie has paid 50$, so the total cost of all the items she has bought is also equal to 50$. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Total Cost = Number of Boxes x Price of One Box

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

50 = (Number of Boxes) x 8.50

Dividing both sides of the equation by 8.50, we get:

6 = Number of Boxes

Therefore, Marie has ordered 6 boxes of pizza."
"Response:  The cost of one short is 16.5$, so the cost of three shorts is 3 x 16.5 = 49.5$. Similarly, the cost of one pantalo...
Let's think step by step. The cost of one short is 16.5$, so the cost of three shorts is 3 x 16.5 = 49.5$. Similarly, the cost of one pair of shoes is 42$, so the cost of three pairs of shoes is 3 x 42 = 126$. Therefore, in total, Mishka has spent 49.5 + 126 = 175.5$ for all these clothes."
Response:  After 60 days, Cynthia will have bought 60/2 = 30 cartons of ice cream, since she buys one every night. Therefore, her total cost for ice cream after 60 days is 30 x 4,00$ = 120,00$.
Response:  The distance traveled by Henri is given as 60 miles. He made two stops during his journey. After 20 miles, he stopped for the first time and then continued until he had traveled an additional 15 miles before stopping again. So, the total distance traveled between the two stops is: Total Distance = Distance after 20 miles + (Distance after 35 miles - Distance after 20 miles) = 40 miles + 15 miles = 55 miles Therefore, the answer is 55 miles.
Response:  If Gloria has to choose between two pairs of high heels that cost less than the boots together and she wants to buy both pairs for herself, then we can say that the price of each pair is equal to half of the total amount she pays for both pairs minus the price of one pair. So if the price of one pair of high heels is x dollars, then the price of the other pair will be twice as much or 2x dollars. Now let's substitute this information into the problem statement: The price of the first pair of high heels is 33 dollars, so the price of the second pair must be twice as much or 66 dollars (since it costs five dollars less than the total amount paid). Therefore, the price of the boots is equal to 100 dollars (the difference between the prices of the two pairs of high heels).
"Response:  The ages of Darell and Allen are in a ratio of 7 to 11, so their current ages can be represented as follows:
Darell = 7x + 5 (where x is an integer)
Allen = 11x + 5 (where x is an integer)
Given that the sum of their current ages is 162, we have:
7x + 5 + 11x + 5 = 162
Simplifying this equation, we get:
18x + 10 = 162
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:
18x = 152
Now, dividing both sides by 18 gives us:
x = 8
So, Darell is currently 7 times 8 + 5 = 53 years old, and Allen is currently 11 times 8 + 5 = 94 years old. In 10 years, Allen will be 11 times 8 + 5 + 10 = 109 years old."
Response:  The first friend estimated 80 bonbons in the bowl. The second friend said there are 20 more than half of that, which means they estimated 160 (half of 80 is 40 + 20 = 160). The third friend said there are 25% more than the first estimate, so their estimation was 120 (25% of 80 is 20 + 20 = 120). Therefore, the average of these three estimates is (80 + 160 + 120) / 3 = 360 / 3 = 120.
Response:  Since each dog needs 0.5 hours per day for exercise and other activities, Jean spends 0.5 x 10 = 5 hours per day taking care of the dogs. Therefore, Jean spends 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week taking care of the dogs.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 pieces in total and that the number of pieces in gold is 30 more than the number of pieces in silver. So, if we let x be the number of pieces in silver, then the number of pieces in gold is x + 30. Therefore, Gretchen has 110 - (x + 30) = 80 pieces in gold.
Response:  We know that Siobhan has fewer than 2 bijoux than Aaron and more than half of Raymond's bijoux. So if Raymond has x bijoux, then Siobhan has less than or equal to x - 2 bijoux. Therefore, Siobhan has at most 38 bijoux (since she cannot have more than 40).
Response:  During the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, which means he scored at a rate of 4/20 = 1/5 points per minute. Then, during the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points, which is equal to (25/100) \* 1/5 = 1/8 points per minute. Therefore, in total, Mike scored 4 + (1/8) \* (40 - 20) = 4 + 1/16 = 5 3/8 points.
Response:  If Terry sells two yogurts per day at $4 each, then he earns $8 per day from selling yogurt. To find out how much money Terry spends on yogurt in 30 days, we can multiply the number of yogurts sold per day by 30 days: $$ NumberOfYogurtsSoldPerDay = 2 Yaourts/day \times 30 Days = 60 Yaourts/month $$ Now, if Terry buys 2 yogurts every day, and he pays $4 for each yogurt, then he spends $8 per day on yogurt: $$ MoneySpentOnYaourtPerDay = 8 Yaourts/day \times 30 Days = 240 Yaourts/month $$ Therefore, Terry spends $240 on yogurt in 30 days.
Response:  Firstly, Jean sold all his Lego sets for $15 each, so he got $15 x 13 = $195 from that sale. Then, he used this money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, which cost him $20 x 8 = $160. So, now he has $195 - $160 = $35 left over after buying the video games. Therefore, he still has 13 Lego sets, which is equal to the amount of money he has left ($35).
Response:  Jean runs for 60 miles per week and runs three days a week. On the first day he runs for 3 hours, which means he covers a distance of 3 x 3 = 9 miles in one hour. Since he runs twice as slow on the other two days, his speed is half that of the first day, or 9 / 2 = 4.5 miles per hour. Therefore, Jean's running speed is 4.5 miles per hour.
"Response:  Since she runs four times faster than she walks and jumps twice as fast as she runs, we can write:
Court speed = 4 x Walking speed = 4 x 3 mph = 12 mph
Jumps at a speed of 3 mph = 3 x 2 = 6 mph
Now, in 6 hours, she spends 1/3 of her time running (which is 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours) and 2/3 of her time walking or jumping (which is 6 hours - 2 hours = 4 hours). So, during those 4 hours of walking or jumping, she covers a distance equal to:
Distance walked or jumped per hour = Speed x Time = 4 mph x 4 hours = 16 miles
Therefore, in total, she covers a distance of:
Total distance covered in 6 hours = Running distance + Walking or jumping distance = 12 miles + 16 miles = 28 miles"
Response:  We know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. So, if Ben's iPhone is x years old, then Brandon's iPhone is 4x years old. Additionally, we know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzie's iPhone. Therefore, Suzie's iPhone is half as old as Ben's iPhone. Now, if Suzie's iPhone is y years old, then Ben's iPhone is 2y years old. Finally, since Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4(2y) = 8y years old. So, the age of Brandon's iPhone is 8 years.
"Response:  We know that when Polly holds the sapphire stone, she can throw the javelin of gold three times farther than her normal throwing distance. So if Polly normally throws the javelin at a distance of x feet, then with the sapphire stone, she can throw it at a distance of 3x feet. 
We also know that Perg, the great dragon, breathes fire over an area of 1000 feet in diameter. This means that any point within this area is within range of his flames. However, we want to find out how far away from the dragon Polly needs to be in order to avoid being hit by its flames. 
So let's assume that Polly wants to maintain a safe distance of y feet from the dragon while still being able to throw the javelin and hit it. Since the dragon's flames only extend for 1000 feet in all directions, we can set up the following equation: 
y = (distance between Polly and the dragon) - (distance the javelin travels before hitting the dragon)
Now, we need to determine the distance the javelin travels before hitting the dragon. According to the problem statement, ""Polly could launch the javelin of gold, the only weapon capable of piercing the dragon, but on a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of its flames."" This means that the distance the javelin travels before hitting the dragon is 400 feet. 
Substituting this value into our equation above, we get: 
y = (distance between Polly and the dragon) - 400
Solving for y, we get: 
y = distance between Polly and the dragon - 400
Now, we know the distance between Polly and the dragon is 1000 feet, so substituting this value into the previous equation gives us: 
y = 600
Therefore, in order to avoid being hit by the dragon's flames while still being able to throw the javelin and hit it, Polly needs to be at least 600 feet away from the dragon."
Response:  We know that Grand-mère Jones prepared 5 tarts and cut each one into 8 parts. So, in total, she had 5 x 8 = 40 parts of tart. Then, after everyone took their share, there were 14 remaining parts. Therefore, the number of invitees was 14 / 8 = 17 invitees.
"Response:  If one serving of chips contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a bag of 300 grams, then...
We know that our daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, and we have already consumed 1800 calories. So, to determine how many grams of chips we will eat, we can use the following calculation:
Calories from chips = Total number of calories in the bag x Number of servings per bag / Daily calorie goal
= 300g x 5 servings / 2000 calories
= 45 grams
Therefore, based on this calculation, you will consume approximately 45 grams of chips."
Response:  If he produces and sells 20 bougies, then he will use 2 livres of beeswax (since each book of wax allows him to produce 10 bougies). So his cost is 2 x 10 = 20 dollars for the wax. Now, if he sells each bougie at 2 dollars, his revenue is 20 x 2 = 40 dollars. Therefore, his profit is 40 - 20 = 20 dollars.
Response:  On Monday, she wrote 5 articles in 4 hours = 1.25 articles per hour (since each article takes 4 hours to write). On Tuesday, she wrote 3/5 of 5 articles = 1.67 articles (since each article takes 4 hours to write). On Wednesday, she wrote 2 times as many articles as on Tuesday = 3.33 articles (since each article takes 4 hours to write). So, during these three days, she spent a total of: 1.25 + 1.67 + 3.33 = 6.25 hours writing articles.
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 pencils in her bag before she left for work. Then, she stopped at a store and bought another pack of pencils. So, the total number of pencils she had is equal to 80 + x, where x is the number of pencils in the new pack. Since there are 220 cups of coffee, each cup requires one pencil. Therefore, the total number of pencils used is equal to 220. Now, we need to find out how many pencils were left after using them all. This means that the remaining pencils are equal to 220 - (80 + x). Solving for x, we get x = 40. So, there were 40 additional pencils in the new pack that Candice bought.
Response:  We know that Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So he buys 2x = 2 \* 10 = 20 red ties and 10 blue ties. The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is 1.5 \* 40 = 60 dollars, and the total cost of all red ties is 20 x 60 = 1200 dollars. Therefore, Jean has spent a total of 1200 + 300 (for the blue ties) = 1500 dollars on ties. 
"Response:  The length of the wire is given as 4 feet (or 48 inches). Since each piece must be at least 6 inches long, we can cut it into pieces that are multiples of 6 inches. Therefore, we have:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces
So, Tracy has obtained 8 pieces from the original wire."
Response:  Since 3/4 of the building is occupied (i.e., 12 out of 15 apartments), that means there are 3 unoccupied apartments on each floor except for the top floor where there are only 2 unoccupied apartments. Therefore, the number of unoccupied apartments = 3 x 7 = 21. So, there are 21 unoccupied apartments in the building.
Response:  The number of eggs produced per day is given as 252. If we divide this number by 12 (the number of eggs in a dozen), we get the total number of dozens produced per day: 252 / 12 = 20.83 dozens per day. Since each dozen of eggs is sold for $2, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly income as follows: 20.83 dozens/day x $2/dozen = $41.66 per day. Therefore, Lloyd earns $41.66 per day with his eggs.
Response:  During the navigation from 13 to 16 hours, the boat moves at 10 miles per hour, so it covers a distance of 10 x 4 = 40 miles. Now, during the return journey, the speed is reduced to 6 miles per hour, and the time taken will be calculated as follows: Time = Distance / Speed = 40 miles / 6 miles/hour = 6.67 hours. Therefore, the boat will take approximately 6.67 hours to return.
Response:  If each of his bands drawings weighs 1/4 pound and each toy weighs 1/2 pound, then he has 15 pounds worth of stuff that needs to be reduced in weight. To find out how many toys he will need to remove, let's divide 15 pounds by 1/2 pound per toy = 30 toys. So, he will need to remove 30 toys from his bag.
Response:  On Thursday (Jeudi), he repaired 6 pneus of trucks and 4 pneus of cars, so he earned $6 x 6 = $36 for truck tires and $4 x 4 = $16 for car tires, in total $52. On Friday (Vendredi), he repaired 12 pneus of cars but didn't repair any truck tires, so he earned $4 x 12 = $48 for car tires only, $0 for truck tires. So, the highest amount of money the mechanic earned in one day is $52 + $48 = $100.
Response:  The family Doubtfire had 7 cat kittens when they left the animal shelter. Then, their mother informed them that Patchy had three times as many kittens as she did (i.e., 3 x 7 = 21), and Trixie had 12 kittens. Therefore, the total number of cat kittens the family Doubtfire now has is 7 + 21 + 12 = 40.
Response:  If Jean has 30 sucettes and he eats 2 of them, then he will have 30 - 2 = 28 sucettes left. To make bags of 2 sucettes each, Jean can use all 28 sucettes to make 14 bags (28 / 2 = 14). Therefore, Jean will obtain 14 bags.
Response:  If Pierre pays $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn, that means he spends a total of $14 per trip to the cinema. Since he has $42 available for the week, we can divide this amount by the cost per trip to find out how many times he can go to the cinema: $42 / $14 = 3 times. So, Pierre can go to the cinema 3 times with the money he has available.
Response:  The total weight of the camion and its contents is given as 3755 + (n x 15), where n is the number of boxes loaded onto the truck. To find out how many boxes can be loaded without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, we need to solve for n in the equation above. We know that the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, so if we subtract this from the total weight of the truck and its contents, we get the maximum weight that the bridge can handle: Total weight - Driver/Truck = Maximum weight for bridge. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is: Number of boxes = Maximum weight / Weight per box. Substituting the value we just found, we get: Number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes. So, the truck can carry up to 83 boxes without overloading the bridge.
Response:  The original price of the products was $40.00. Then, there was a 25% surcharge (which is equal to $10) and an additional $3 for delivery fees, making the total cost $53.00 ($40 + $10 + $3). Finally, Stéphane gave a tip of $4, bringing the total amount paid to $57.00. So, the final price of Stéphane's order was $57.00.
"Response:  We know that each cluster of grapes contains 20 fruits, and there are 6 clusters in total. So, we have:
Total number of grapes = Number of clusters x Number of fruits per cluster
= 6 x 20
= 120 fruits
Now, let's add the isolated fruits to this total:
Total number of fruits = Total number of grapes + Isolated fruits
= 120 + 67
= 187 fruits
So, there are 187 framboises (french for ""raspberries"") in total."
"Response:  We know that out of 25 oranges in the basket:
* 1 is rotten (avariée) = 24 good oranges
* 20% are not ripe = 5 non-ripe oranges
* 2 are acidic = 23 non-acidic oranges
So, there are 24 + 5 + 23 = 50 good oranges in the basket."
Response:  Firstly, she spent 500$ for materials (fabrication). Then, she paid 800$ to the jeweler for realization. Finally, she paid 10% of that amount for insurance, which is equal to 80$. So in total, she spent 660$.
"Response:  If she works for 40 years and receives a pension of $50,000 per year after retirement, then her annual pension will be:
$50,000 x (1 + 5%)^(30 - 40) = $67,500
So, her annual pension after working for 30 years will be $67,500."
Response:  The amount paid for the first half of the year is given as $140 x (6/12) = $90. Since there is a 10% decrease in the second half of the year, the amount paid during that period is $90 x (6/12) - 10% = $81. So, the total amount paid for the entire year is $90 + $81 = $171.
Response:  We know that Sophie has already driven 100 miles since her last fill-up and had to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill the tank again. So, the total amount of gasoline she currently has in her car is 12 gallons (the capacity of her tank) minus the 4 gallons she added = 8 gallons. Since she has 8 gallons of fuel left, we can calculate how far she can drive by dividing the number of gallons of fuel remaining by the fuel efficiency of her car. According to the problem statement, the fuel efficiency of Sophie's car is given as x miles per gallon. Therefore, we can write: Distance = Number of gallons of fuel / Fuel efficiency = 8 gallons / x miles/gallon = x miles Where x represents the unknown value we are trying to find. Now, we need to solve for x using the information provided in the question. We know that Sophie drove 100 miles since her last fill-up, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Distance = 8 gallons / x miles/gallon = 100 miles / x miles/gallon To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 100: x miles/gallon = 100 miles / 8 gallons = 12.5 miles/gallon This means that Sophie's car gets an average fuel economy of 12.5 miles per gallon.
"Response: 
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to read for half of that time (1 hour). He repeats this process 3 times a week.
In one month, there are 4 weeks. So, in total, Jim spends:

2 hours/week x 3 weeks = 6 hours/month watching TV
+ (1 hour/week x 3 weeks) = 3 hours/month reading
Total time spent watching TV and reading per month = 6 + 3 = 9 hours/month
Therefore, Jim spends approximately 9 hours/month watching TV and reading."
"Response:  We know that there are four schools participating in the tournament and each school has sent one female team, one male team, and one coach. Therefore, we have:
Female teams = 4 schools x 1 team/school = 4 teams
Male teams = 4 schools x 1 team/school = 4 teams
Coaches = 4 schools x 1 coach/school = 4 coaches
So, in total, the number of people the schools have sent to the tournament is:
People = Female teams + Male teams + Coaches = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
Therefore, the answer is 12."
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds in total and 35 less rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. And we also know that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, so the number of emeralds is 140 x 2 = 280. Therefore, there were 175 + 280 = 455 stones in total in the treasure chest.
Response:  We know that there are two times more boys than girls at school. So if there are x girls, there are 2x boys. Since we have 60 girls and 5 boys per teacher, this means that there are 60/5 = 12 teachers in total. Therefore, there are 12 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.
Response:  We know that Bailey started with some initial amount of money (call it x). Then she received an weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, which is equal to $40 ($5 x 8). So, at the end of 8 weeks, Bailey had $x + $40 = $100. Solving for x, we get x = $60. Therefore, Bailey started with $60.
"Response: 
Judy gives 5 courses of dance per week and 8 courses on Saturday, so she teaches a total of 13 courses (5 + 8) per week.
Each course has 15 students, so the total number of students Judy teaches in a week is 13 x 15 = 195 students.
Since each student pays $15, Judy earns $15 x 195 = $2,375 per week from teaching dance classes."
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second one has twice as many instructions as the first (i.e., 40 instructions). Therefore, Kélian must read 60 instructions in total to prepare both plates.
"Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each slice of cheesecake for $4, he will have earned a total of:
$3 x 43 = $132 from the brownies
$4 x 23 = $92 from the cheesecakes
So, in total, Tommy has raised $224 ($132 + $92) for his charity."
"Response:  The cost of each phone is $150 and it will be paid in 3 monthly installments with an interest rate of 2%. So, we need to calculate how much Sheila needs to pay for each phone every month.
To do this, we can use the formula:
Monthly payment = Cost / Number of months
In this case, the cost of each phone is $150, so the monthly payment would be:
$150 / 3 months = $50 per phone
So, Sheila needs to pay $50 x 5 phones = $250 every month for 3 months to buy all five phones."
"Response:  If we round all prices to the nearest dollar, then...
Soucis: 12 x $2.74 = $32.88
Pétunias: 9 x $1.87 = $16.53
Bégonias: 17 x $2.12 = $35.04
Total: $32.88 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $84.45
So Artie will gain $84.45 in total."
"Response:  We know that each floor of the sandcastle has half the area of the previous floor. So, if we start with an area of A for the first floor (which is the base), then the second floor will have an area of half of A = A/2. Similarly, the third floor will have an area of half of the second floor, which means it will be A/4. And so on...
So, to find out what the average area of each floor is, we can simply take the total area of all four floors and divide it by 4.
Total Area = Area of first floor + Area of second floor + Area of third floor + Area of fourth floor
= A + A/2 + A/4 + A/8
= 16 + 8 + 4 + 2
= 30
Therefore, the average area of each floor in the sandcastle is 30 square feet."
"Response:  According to the information given in the problem, during the first 180 days (or 6 months), Cécilia will have to give her new puppy 1 bowl of food every day. Since there are 365 days in a year, this means she will have to give her puppy 1 bowl of food for each of the last 6 months of the first year. Therefore, the total number of bowls of food that Cécilia will use during the first year is:

180 x 6 = 1080 bowls

Since each bag of dog food represents 110 bowls, we can see that Cécilia will need:

1080 / 110 = 9.7 bags of dog food during the first year."
Response:  We know that Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara and four times more than David. So if Sara does x pounds of laundry, then Raymond does 2x pounds and David does 4x pounds. Now we are given that Sara does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation: 2x = 400... (1)...and David does 4x = 800 pounds of laundry (2) Subtracting (1) from (2), we get: 2x - 4x = 400 - 800 = -400 pounds. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is -400 pounds.
Response:  If Vincent buys flowers in packs of 3 for $2.50 each or packs of 2 for $1 each, he will save money if he buys more flowers. To find out how much he will save, we need to calculate the cost of both options and compare them. The cost of buying 18 flowers in packs of 3 is: 18 x $2.50 = $45.00 The cost of buying 18 flowers in packs of 2 is: 18 x $1.00 = $18.00 So, by buying flowers in packs of 2, Vincent will save $27.00 ($45.00 - $18.00). Therefore, the best option for Vincent is to buy flowers in packs of 2.
Response:  The original price of the toilet is $100. Since it's a new customer, the toilet cleaner offers a discount of 30%. So, we need to calculate what percentage of the discount is applied to the original price. To do this, we divide the discount (30%) by 100% and multiply it by the original price ($100): Discount = (30/100) x $100 = $30 Now, let's subtract the discount from the original price: New Price = $100 - $30 = $70 Therefore, the final cost of the toilet after the discount is $70.
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters each, so they got 24 / 6 = 4 liters each. So, in total, they have 8 liters (2 x 4). Then, the boy received 6 liters more, so there are now 8 + 6 = 14 liters left.
Response:  We know that Charlie had initially 10 stickers and then bought 21 more in the mall. So, he now has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. Then, he received 23 additional stickers for his birthday, so he now has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. Next, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, reducing his total number of stickers to 45 - 28 = 17 stickers. Therefore, Charlie still has 17 stickers left.
"Response:  We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times the weight of Grace. So, if we write this equation:
Grace = 125 lb
Alex = 125 lb x 4 - 2 = 93 lb
Now we have to find the sum of their two weights in pounds. Therefore:
Sum of Grace and Alex's weight = 125 + 93 = 218 lb"
Response:  There are 3 rosiers and each rosier has 25 roses. So, in total, there are 3 x 25 = 75 roses. And each rose has 8 epines, so there are 75 x 8 = 600 epines in total. Therefore, the answer is 600 epines.
"Response:  We know that the team has played 22 matches and won more times than it lost. So, we can write an equation as follows: Won + Lost = 22 (1) Where ""Won"" is the number of matches the team has won and ""Lost"" is the number of matches it has lost. Now, we are asked how many times the team has won. From equation (1), we can see that if the team has won x matches, then the total number of matches it has played is equal to 22 minus the number of losses: Won + Lost = 22 - Lost (2) Substituting the value of ""Won"" from equation (1) into equation (2): 22 - Lost = x (3) Since the team has won more times than it has lost, we know that Lost is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, we can simplify equation (3) as follows: 22 > x (4) Now, let's find out what value of ""x"" satisfies inequality (4). To do this, we can use the fact that 22 is greater than any positive integer. For example, 22 > 10, 22 > 5, etc. Therefore, we can conclude that the team has won exactly 10, 5, or 22 matches. So, the answer is either 10, 5, or 22."
"Response:  Since he started traveling at age 23 and has been doing it four times per year since then, he has traveled for... (1)...times in total. Therefore, the number of rows in his short poem is equal to the number of years he has been traveling... (2)...which is equal to the current age minus the starting age... (3). So, we can calculate the total number of squares as follows: Total no. of squares = Number of rows x Number of columns (in this case, 50% of each square represents one year of travel) Total no. of squares = (Number of rows x 50%) = (4 x 34) / 50 = 680 squares. 
Therefore, Gene's short poem consists of 680 squares."
Response:  The alarm has sounded three times today. 1) First time it sounded for 4 times, 2) Second time it sounded for 3 more times than the first time, so it sounded for 7 times (4 x 3 = 12), and 3) Third time it sounded for 2 less times than the second time, so it sounded for 9 times (7 - 2 = 9). Therefore, the alarm has sounded a total of 3 + 7 + 9 = 19 times today.
Response:  The company pays each employee $600 per month. It has a policy of adding 10% to the initial salary of each employee who has five years of seniority. If Sylvie has just completed five years of service and her new annual salary will be... (spoiler alert!)...$72,000! That's right, she'll get a nice raise after three more years of service.
Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more discs than Harald. So if Marilyn sold x discs, Harald sold x/10 = 10x/10 discs. Since they together sold 88,000 discs, we can set up the equation: 10x + (10x/10) = 88,000. Simplifying and solving for x, we get x = 44,000. Therefore, Harald sold 44,000 discs.
"Response:  We know that Christina invited 16 friends to her party and asked each of them to bring a gift worth $0.75 per person. Since one-fourth of the guests did not show up, we need to adjust the number of gifts accordingly. So, if 4 out of 16 guests did not come (i.e., 1 - 0.25 = 0.75), then the total number of gifts she needs to buy is:

$ Number of gifts = Total number of guests \* Gift value per guest
= 16 friends \* $0.75 per friend
= 11.50 ($ since 0.75 x 16 = 11.50)

Therefore, Christina will spend approximately $11.50 on gifts for her party."
Response:  We know that an adult Tyrannosaurus Rex needs 10 pounds (or 4.5 kg) of salad per person and a child needs half of this amount. So, for 20 adult T-Rexes, we need 20 x 4.5 = 90 kg of salad. Additionally, there are 5 children present, so we need 5 x 2.25 = 11 kg of salad for them. Therefore, in total, Ted needs to bring 101 kg (or 223 lbs) of salad to the picnic.
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three times more animals than Marcia.
Marcia has two more animals than Cindy.
Cindy has four animals.
So, we can write an equation based on these statements:
Let x be the number of animals Jan has. Since Jan has three times more animals than Marcia, Marcia has x/3 animals.
Since Marcia has two more animals than Cindy, Cindy has x - 2 animals.
And finally, since Cindy has four animals, we have x + 4 = 16 (since the total number of animals is 16).
Solving for x, we get:
x = 8
Therefore, all three girls together have 8 + 8 + 4 = 20 animals."
"Response:  We know that Amy is older than Jackson and younger than Corey. So, we can write:
Amy > Jackson > Corey
We also know that Jacques is younger than Corey, so we can write:
Jacques < Corey
Now, let's use some age intervals to help us solve the problem:
Age of Amy = x + 5 (since she is 5 years older than Jackson)
Age of Jackson = x - 3 (since he is 3 years younger than Amy)
Age of Corey = x - 2 (since he is 2 years younger than Amy)
Age of Jacques = x - 1 (since he is 1 year younger than Corey)
Now, we have four equations with four variables. Can you solve them to find out the ages of each child?"
Response:  We know that Lee used to run the 400 meters hurdles in 42 seconds (Lee = 42 s). Then, after changing his diet, Gerald improved his speed by 10% and now runs the race in 38 seconds (Gerald = 38 s). So, if we want to find out how long it takes Gerald to complete the race after his new diet, we can use the formula: Time taken by Gerald = (Time taken by Lee x 0.9) / 10%. Now, plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Time taken by Gerald = (42 s x 0.9) / 10% = 35.6 s. Therefore, after his new diet, Gerald takes approximately 35.6 seconds to complete the 400 meters hurdles race.
Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined in the quarter. So if there are x dogs and cats, then there would be x + 12 rabbits. Since there are 60 dogs and cats altogether, we can set up the equation: x + 12 = 60. Solving for x, we get: x = 48. Therefore, there are 48 animals (dogs, cats, and rabbits) in the quarter.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in CM2, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of girls are members of the Scouts. So, the number of girls who are not members of the Scouts is (2/3) x 100 = 67. Therefore, there are 67 girls who do not belong to the Scouts.
Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend Jacques only slept for 2/3 of that time, then Jacques slept for x hours where x is the number of hours Harry slept minus 2/3 of those hours. So we can write an equation as follows: x = (9 - 2/3 \* 9) = 9 - 6 = 3 hours. Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than Jacques.
"Response:  We know that each box of 16 onces contains three tomatoes, so we can write:

Number of boxes = Total volume of sauce / Volume of one box
= 32 onces / 16 onces
= 2 boxes
Therefore, Freda has used 2 x 3 = 6 tomatoes to make her last batch of tomato sauce."
Response:  The number of cars that have passed through the jam during the first 15 minutes is equal to the difference between the total number of cars initially and the number of cars that did not pass through the jam. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Cars - Number of Cars That Did Not Pass Through = Number of Cars That Passed Through During First 15 Minutes. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: 30 - 5 = x Where x is the number of cars that passed through the jam during the first 15 minutes. Now, we are asked to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. To do this, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation: 25 = x Now, we know that x represents the number of cars that passed through the jam during the first 15 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  We know that Marie already has 2 plants per each of the 40 windowsills in her house (i.e., 80 plants). Now she received 18 new plants from her favorite nursery. So, after taking one plant from each window sill tomorrow, Marie will have 72 plants left (80 - 18 = 72).
Response:  The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, so the second friend had to press it more than that to match him. Since the second friend pressed it 1/4 of the time the first friend did (i.e., 5 times), the third friend must have pressed it 3 times less than the second friend (since they are equally matched). Therefore, the fourth friend must have pressed it 60 - 9 = 51 times. So, in total, the doorbell rang 20 + 5 + 3 = 78 times.
"Response:  We know that Solo has to read 4 pages of his science manual, 20 pages of his social studies manual, 7 pages of his history manual, and 8 pages of his geography manual in total. If he has already read 15 pages on Monday, then he has 3 days left to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we can divide the total number of pages he needs to read by the number of days he has left: 
Total pages needed = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages
Days left = 3
Pages per day = Total pages / Days left = 49 / 3 = 16 pages per day 
Therefore, Solo needs to read approximately 16 pages every day for the next three days to complete all the assigned readings."
Response:  Jean drinks water at breakfast, lunch and dinner every day of the week, so he drinks 3 x 7 = 21 verres d'eau per week. Additionally, he drinks one more glass before bedtime, which is another 1 verre d'eau. Therefore, in total, Jean drinks 22 verres d'eau per week.
"Response:  The banc of fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, so it moves at a speed of $ \frac{ distance}{time} = \frac {3mi}{10min} = 0.3mi/min$ 
Now we know that the city stretches for 42 miles from the ocean to the opposite side of land. To find out how long it will take the bank of fog to cover the entire city, we need to divide the distance of the city ($=42mi$) by its moving speed ($=0.3mi/min$). So, the time it takes for the bank of fog to cover the entire city is: $$Time = Distance / Speed = 42mi / 0.3mi/min = 140min$$ Therefore, it would take the bank of fog 140 minutes (or approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes) to cover the entire city."
Response:  If Poppy placed one quarter of the pieces (25%), then she placed 25/100 = 1/4 of the total number of pieces. Since her mother placed another third (33%) after that, her mother placed 33/100 = 1/3 of the remaining pieces. So in total, there are 1 + 1/3 = 1 1/3 pieces left to be placed.
Response:  If Cody can eat three times more than Amir, that means if Amir eats x biscuits, then Cody will eat 3x biscuits. So, the total number of biscuits eaten by both Cody and Amir is: Total = x + 3x = 4x.
"Response:  The volume of each box is given as V = lwh, where l is length, w is width, and h is height. So for the first box, we have:
V1 = 5 x 6 x 4 = 90 cubic inches (or 152 cubic centimeters)
For the second box, we have:
V2 = 6 x 7 x 4 = 148 cubic inches (or 243 cubic centimeters)
For the third box, we have:
V3 = 7 x 8 x 4 = 280 cubic inches (or 432 cubic centimeters)
Now, let's add up all these volumes to find the total volume of the three boxes:
Total volume = V1 + V2 + V3 = 90 + 148 + 280 = 518 cubic inches (or 840 cubic centimeters)
So the total volume of the three boxes is 518 cubic inches or 840 cubic centimeters."
Response:  We know that Frankie watched his favorite show for 1 hour each night (Monday and Tuesday), and for 30 minutes on Wednesday. Therefore, he watched a total of 2 hours + 30 minutes = 2.5 hours of television on those days. On Thursday, he finished his homework earlier than usual and watched an episode of his favorite show for 1 hour, followed by another episode of the same show for 30 minutes. So, he watched a total of 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours of television on Thursday. Finally, on Friday, he stayed up late to watch two episodes of his favorite show, each lasting 1 hour. Therefore, he watched a total of 2 x 1 = 2 hours of television on Friday. In summary, Frankie watched a total of 2.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 hours of television during the week.
Response:  Last year, Henri prepared x cookies. This year, he wants to prepare twice as many cookies (2x), which means he will prepare 2x + 5 = 2x + 110 cookies this year. Since he made 110 more cookies than last year, we can set up the equation: 2x + 110 = x. Solving for x, we get: x = 70. So, Henri prepared 70 cookies last year.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money will be spent on gasoline if someone buys 10 gallons of it at $3 per gallon. So, the cost of 10 gallons = $3 x 10 = $30. Now, let's check whether there is any rebate or not. According to the question, there is a rebate of $0.20 per gallon, which means that after filling up with gasoline, you will get back $0.20 per gallon as a rebate. Since you bought 10 gallons of gasoline, you will get back $0.20 x 10 = $2 as a rebate. Therefore, the final price of 10 gallons of gasoline after applying the rebate is $30 - $2 = $28.
"Response:  
Marcell has three large rolls and 14 long rolls, so he has a total of 3 + 14 = 17 rolls. 
Béatrice has two large rolls and 24 long rolls, so she has a total of 2 + 24 = 26 rolls. 
Since they are competing to see who can eat more rolls, we need to find out how many rolls each person has eaten in average. To do this, we divide the number of rolls each person has eaten by the total number of rolls they had at the beginning of the competition. 
For Marcell, it is (17 / 17) = 1. So, he has eaten one roll on average. 
For Béatrice, it is (26 / 28) = 0.93 or approximately 1 roll per person on average. Therefore, both Marcell and Béatrice have eaten roughly one roll on average."
Response:  The boat took two liters of water every ten feet (ten * 2 = twenty) and it took sixteen seconds to travel twenty feet. So, in one minute (sixty seconds), the boat would have taken sixty / 10 = six liters of water. Since they were on the lake for five minutes (300 seconds), the total amount of water the boat took in is three hundred / 10 = thirty liters. Therefore, when Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken thirty liters of water.
Response:  Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher gives 2 courses per day, there will be a total of 8 courses taught in one day. If the blackboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, then it will be cleaned 8 x 3 = 24 times in one day. Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers every day and there are initially 3 flowers (since 5 have not grown), then after 15 days he will have planted a total of 3 + 15 = 18 flowers. So, at the end of 15 days, Ryan will have 18 flowers in his garden.
Response:  We know that Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone can store 50 times as many photos as there are birds in the picture taken by Jamal, then Jamal's phone can store 6 x 50 = 300 times as many photos as there are birds in the picture. Therefore, if there are X birds in the picture taken by Jamal, then Jamal's phone can store 300X photos. Since Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1800 photos, we can set up the equation: 300X = 1800. Solving for X, we get X = 600. So there are 600 birds in the picture taken by Jamal.
"Response:  If Sasha sells all of her remaining wood (10 pieces of 2x4 and 5 pieces of 4x4), she will make a total of:

* 10 x $10 = $100 from the 2x4 pieces
* 5 x $16 = $80 from the 4x4 pieces

Total profit = $100 + $80 = $180."
"Response:  We know that Katy used a ratio of 7:13 for preparing her coffee. This means she used 7 cuillères à café of sugar and water for every 13 cuillères à café of water. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

7/13 = x/120
Where x is the number of cuillères à café of sugar and water that Katy used.
Now, we need to solve this equation to find out how many cuillères à café of sugar and water Katy used in total. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = (120)/(7) = 17
Therefore, Katy used 17 cuillères à café of sugar and water to prepare her coffee."
Response:  For each of his three children, Jean buys two pairs of shoes that cost $60 each. Therefore, he pays for 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of shoes. So, he has paid a total of 6 x $60 = $360.
"Response:  On day one, there were two containers with 10 vehicles (5 per container). So, the total number of vehicles in the port was 20. Now, let's assume that all the new containers arrived on day two and contained 5 vehicles each. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on day two is:

20 + (3 x 5) = 45

So, there were 45 vehicles imported on day two."
Response:  Adrian's current salary is 30% more than Lylah's and four years ago his salary was 40% higher than it was when he started working. So if Adrian currently makes $40,000 per year, then four years ago he made $28,000 ($40,000 x 0.6). Now we know that both of their salaries have increased simultaneously over time, so we can assume that Lylah's salary has also increased by 30%. Therefore, Lylah's current salary is $35,700 ($28,000 x 1.3). To find out how much they make together, we simply add up their individual salaries: $40,000 + $35,700 = $75,700.
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 cartons of paper per week and each carton contains 30 sheets of paper, then he uses 2 x 2 = 4 cartons of paper per month. Since each carton contains 30 sheets of paper, Miguel uses 4 x 30 = 120 sheets of paper per month. Therefore, Miguel utilizes 120 sheets of paper per month.
Response:  We know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so together they brought 13 fruits (5 + 8 = 13). Now, we are told that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Additionally, we are told that Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette, which means he brought 5 / 2 = 2.5 oranges. Therefore, in total, both Morisette and Kael brought 13 + 10 + 2.5 = 25.5 fruits.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. Then, she lost 2 hours each of the two days that followed (Tuesday and Wednesday), so she slept for 6 hours on Tuesday and 4 hours on Wednesday. For the rest of the week, she slept for 1 hour more than during those two days, which means she slept for 7 hours on Thursday and 5 hours on Friday. Therefore, in total, Sadie slept for 5 + 7 = 12 hours during the whole week.
Response:  Firstly, she ran at 10 mph for 3 hours which means she covered a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Then, she ran at 5 mph for 4 hours which means she covered a distance of 4 x 5 = 20 miles. Therefore, in total, Rosie has run 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jennie started working, there were x letters in the pile of letters to be stamped. She tampered one-third of them (x/3). So, after she finished her work, there were 30 - x/3 = 45 letters left in the pile. Therefore, when Jennie began the task, there were 45 letters in the pile.
"Response: 
Julia bought a new pack of plastic spoons and used three of them to taste her stew during cooking. Later, her husband gave her five more spoons as a gift. So, in total, Julia had seven spoons from the new pack.
Now, let's count how many spoons she already had before buying the new pack:
She had three spoons that were originally hers (the ones she used to taste the stew), and then her husband gave her five more spoons, so she had eight spoons in total before buying the new pack.
So, the number of spoons in the new pack is: 7 (from the new pack) + 8 (total before buying the new pack) = 15.
Therefore, there were 15 spoons in the pack that Julia bought."
Response:  We know that Dylan needed 20 sausages for the party (petit pain aux saucisses). So he bought 38 + 6 = 44 more than he needed. Therefore, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is 44.
"Response:  If Amy has made 20 more friends than Lily after being transferred to a new school, then Lily had x friends before the transfer. Since Amy now has 20 + x friends, we can write the equation:
Lily's total number of friends = x
Amy's total number of friends = x + 20
Now, according to the problem statement, Lily has 50 friends in total. So, we can set up another equation:
x + (x + 20) = 50
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
2x + 20 = 50
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:
2x = 30
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
x = 15
Therefore, Lily had 15 friends before the transfer, and Amy has 15 + 20 = 35 friends in total."
Response:  The cost of one pastèque is three times that of a pepper, so the cost of one pastèque is 3 × 15 = 45$. Therefore, the total cost of 4 pastèques will be 45$ x 4 = 180$. Similarly, the cost of 20 peppers will be 15$ x 20 = 300$, and the cost of 10 oranges will be 5$ x 10 = 50$. So, in total, Dillon will have to pay 180 + 300 + 50 = 630$.
Response:  The hospital admits 500 people per day and each patient is examined for an average of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on examinations is: Time = Number of patients x Examination duration = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. Now, let's calculate the revenue generated from these consultations: Revenue = Total time spent on examinations x Price charged to patients = 12,000 x $150 = $180,000 per day. Similarly, if we calculate the revenue for the entire week (7 days), it would be: Revenue per week = Daily revenue x Number of days in a week = $180,000 x 7 = $1,260,000 per week. Finally, if we calculate the annual revenue based on this figure, we get: Annual revenue = Weekly revenue x Number of weeks in a year = $1,260,000 x 52 = $65,360,000 per year. So, the hospital realizes approximately $65 million in annual profits from these consultations.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 60 seasonal workers hired to play Santa's elves in the mall. Then, after some children vomited on them, 30 of these elves resigned. Next, 10 more elves left their job after being kicked by children. So, the number of elves remaining is:

Initially, there were 60 elves.
After 30 elves resigned due to vomiting, there were 30 elves left.
After another 10 elves resigned due to kicking, there were 20 elves left.

Therefore, there are 20 seasonal workers left playing Santa's elves in the mall."
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. Then in June, he spent $440 less than what he spent in May, which is $440 - $500 = $-50. So, the total amount of money that Joseph spent during these two months is $500 + ($-50) = $450.
Response:  Firstly, Pam made two turns around the rollercoaster, which means she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets. Similarly, Fred did four turns, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets. Therefore, in total they used 12 + 24 = 36 tickets at the fairground that day.
Response:  We know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 6 times more than Monday means he walked 24 miles (6 x 4 = 24) on Tuesday. So, his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 + 24 = 65 miles. Therefore, he walked 65 miles on Wednesday.
Response:  If Tom does 4 car washes per month, he will do 4 x 12 = 48 car washes in one year. Since each car wash costs $15, Tom will spend $48 x 15 = $720 in one year. Therefore, the correct answer is $720.
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 games and lost 5 of them before comparing with Bobby. So, Brian now has 20 - 5 = 15 games left. Now we are told that Bobby has fewer than 3 times as many games as Brian. This means that if Brian has x games, then Bobby has x / 3 games. Substituting x = 15, we get x / 3 = 5. Therefore, Bobby has 5 games.
Response:  We know that there are only 27 licornes in total worldwide. Then we learn that two thirds of these licornes are located in Scotland (Highlands). So, the number of licornes in Scotland is equal to 2/3 x 27 = 18 licornes. Since we also know that two thirds of Scottish licornes are women, we can conclude that the number of female licornes in Scotland is equal to 18/3 = 6 licornes. Therefore, there are 6 licornes ecossaises (Scottish licornes) in total.
Response:  The cost of each submarine is $7.50 x 2 = $15.00, and the cost of each pack of fries is $1.50 x 2 = $3.00. The cost of each cookie is $1.00 x 2 = $2.00. Therefore, the total cost of the order is: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00. Since there is a 20% charge for delivery, the delivery fee will be $20.00 x 20% = $4.00. So, the final cost of the order including delivery is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.
Response:  If Marc took 8 hours to complete the first test of 75 questions, then he completed it in 8/75 = 0.11 hours per question. Similarly, if he took 6 hours to complete the second test of 100 questions, he completed it in 6/100 = 0.06 hours per question. Since there are 25 questions left without answers, we can calculate the time taken to complete them as follows: Total time taken = Number of questions x Time per question = 25 x (0.06 + 0.11) = 25(0.17) = 4.25 hours Therefore, Marc took 4.25 hours to complete the remaining 25 questions without answers.
Response:  If there are 22 times more blue balls than red balls, then for every one red ball, there are 5 blue balls (22/4 = 5). So if there are 12 blue balls, there must be 60 red balls (12 x 5 = 60).
Response:  The total number of cars available for rent is 20. Among them, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is (Total - Automatic) = 20 - 12 = 8. Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 8/20 x 100 = 40%.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, if we have x worker bees, then there would be 2x baby bees. And since there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, we can say that the number of queen bees is half the number of baby bees. Therefore, the number of worker bees is equal to half the difference between the total number of bees and the number of queen bees. In other words, the number of worker bees is (700 - 50) = 650.
Response:  If Jordan spends 2 hours per day playing video games and he earns $10/hour at his part-time job, then in one week (7 days) he would have spent 14 hours (2 x 7) playing video games and earned $140 ($10/hour x 14 hours). So, in one week Jordan would have earned $140 from playing video games.
Response:  The cost of the milk is $2, and the eggs are $3 each, so the total cost of these items is $2 + $3 = $5. For the light bulbs, we have to pay $3 x 3 = $9. The mugs cost $3 each, so their total cost is $3 x 3 = $9 as well. Finally, the hooks cost $4 each, so their total cost is $4 x 1 = $4. Therefore, the total cost of all the items is $5 + $9 + $9 + $4 = $27.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the revenue of each customer per week. Since there are 8 customers in total (including the 3 existing ones), and Kim will charge $10 per service for each customer, his total revenue per week would be:
Revenue = Number of customers x Service fee per customer x Number of services per week
= 8 customers x $10 per customer x 4 services per week
= $320 per week
Now, let's move on to calculating the expenses. As mentioned in the question, Kim needs to buy 2 bottles of water from Javel at $2 each and 5 packs of tissues at $5 each for each customer. So, his total expenses per week would be:
Expenses = Number of customers x Cost of goods sold per customer x Number of services per week
= 8 customers x $2 per bottle x 4 services per week + 8 customers x $5 per pack x 4 services per week
= $64 + $40 = $104 per week
Now that we have calculated both the revenue and expenses, we can find out the profit of Kim's business per week. Profit = Revenue - Expenses
= $320 - $104
= $216 per week
Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $216 per week from his cleaning business."
Response:  We know that Jean has a field of 10 hectares and we also know that there are 100 ananas per hectare. So, in total, Jean can have 1000 ananas (10 x 100 = 1000). Since he recovers them every 3 months, he will be able to collect 3 times 1000 = 3000 ananas per year. Therefore, Jean can collect 3000 ananas in one year.
"Response: 
Johnny has collected 500 Lego pieces from one game and 3 times as many pieces (or 1500 pieces) from another game. Therefore, he has collected a total of 500 + 1500 = 2000 pieces so far.
However, there is also a third game with 1/4 of the number of pieces. Since this game had 5000 pieces in total, Johnny has collected 1/4 of that amount, which is 1250 pieces (since 1/4 of 5000 is 1250).
Therefore, the total number of Lego pieces that Johnny has collected is 2000 + 1250 = 3250 pieces."
"Response: 
Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours and half of them returned within the same time frame. So, she saw 15 bees return during that period.
Then, she observed twice as many bees leaving the hive than those who left earlier (i.e., 2 x 15 = 30). This means she saw an additional 30 bees leave the hive during the last 6 hours of the day.
Therefore, the total number of bees Debra saw returning to the hive during the last 6 hours of the day is 15 + 30 = 45 bees."
Response:  The mother of Brittany gives the cashier an amount of money that is equal to the difference between the price of an adult ticket and the price of a child ticket. So if the price of an adult ticket is $12 and the price of a child ticket is $10, then the difference is $12 - $10 = $2. Therefore, the mother of Brittany gave the cashier $2 in dollar.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothée on Facebook. So if Dorothée has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends. And Jacques has four times as many friends as Dorothée. So if Dorothée has x friends, Jacques has 4x friends. Now we are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can write an equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, Jacques has 4 × 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.
Response:  We know that Steve lives 1 mile away from school and takes 5 minutes to get there by bike at 440 feet per minute. Therefore, he covers a distance of 1 mile in 5 minutes or 5 miles per hour. Since Tim lives 1 mile away from school and takes 7 minutes to get there by skateboard at 264 feet per minute, he also covers a distance of 1 mile in 7 minutes or 7 miles per hour. Now we need to find out how long it will take for both of them to reach their homes after finishing the race. To do this, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. For Steve, time = 5 miles / 5 miles/hour = 1 hour. For Tim, time = 7 miles / 7 miles/hour = 1 hour and 14 minutes (or 1 hour and 9 minutes if you round up). So, Tim will arrive home before Steve by 14 (or 9) minutes.
"Response: 
1. Children came to inflate their bicycle tires and paid $0.25 per tire. Since 5 children came in total, she earned $1.25 from this group.
2. Three people brought tricycles and needed to inflate all four tires. So, they paid $0.25 x 4 = $1 for each person. Therefore, she earned $3 from this group.
3. One person came with a monocycle and needed to inflate one tire. They paid $0.25, so she earned $0.25.
Total amount earned that day is: $1.25 + $3 + $0.25 = $4.50."
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of cookies... (10 packages) x (6 biscuits/package)... = 60 biscuits in total....and each biscuit costs $0.10, then the total cost of all the biscuits is... ($60) x $0.10/biscut = $6. So if Carl pays with a bill of $10, he will receive $4 left over as change.
"Response: 
Dave had eaten 14 fries before the seagull stole the package from him. The seagull ate half of the remaining fries (since it ate 7). So, there were 7 fries left after the seagull's meal.
Then, three pigeons came and ate 3 fries each (totaling 9 fries consumed by them).
Later, a raton laveur stole 2/3 of the remaining fries (which is equal to 4 fries).
Finally, one ant carried away one last fry.
So, in total, 5 fries remained when the ants took their share.
Therefore, when Dave bought the bag of fries, there were 5 + 14 = 19 fries inside the bag."
"Response: 
Kimo has three courses per day from Monday to Friday, so he has 3 x 5 = 15 hours of classes per week.
Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 15 hours/week x 16 weeks = 240 hours on his courses per semester."
"Response: 

* The number of small bread rolls prepared each day is 300. If we assume that they are all lined up end to end, their total length would be:
	+ 300 small bread rolls x 4 inches per roll = 1200 inches
	+ Since there are 12 inches in a foot, this means the total length of the small bread rolls is:
	+ 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet
* Now let's consider the croissants. There are 120 croissants prepared each day, and they measure 6 inches long. So if we line them up end to end, their total length would be:
	+ 120 croissants x 6 inches per croissant = 720 inches
	+ Again, dividing by 12 inches per foot gives us the total length in feet:
	+ 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet
* Finally, let's calculate the length of the baguettes. There are 60 baguettes prepared each day, and they measure 2 feet long. Therefore, their total length would be:
	+ 60 baguettes x 2 feet per baguette = 120 feet

So, when we add up the lengths of all three types of bread products, we get:

100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet

Therefore, if Bill puts all the bread products from his bakery together, they will stretch for approximately 280 feet."
"Response:  The total number of bananas needed for the entire duration is equal to the sum of the monthly needs of each species. So, we need to calculate the monthly needs of each species and then add them up.
Monthly needs = Total number of bananas / Number of months
For Macaques: Monthly needs = 200 bananas / 2 months = 100 bananas/month
For Gorillas: Monthly needs = 400 bananas / 2 months = 200 bananas/month
For Baboons: Monthly needs = 100 bananas / 2 months = 50 bananas/month
Total monthly needs = 100 + 200 + 50 = 350 bananas/month
Therefore, the guard must order 350 x 2 = 700 bananas in total to keep the monkeys fed for two months."
Response:  We know that Blake made 15 runs of 100 yards each (total distance = 15 x 100 = 1500 yards). Then, we are told that Kelly ran once from the 40-yard line to the end zone and back (distance = 80 yards). So, in total, Kelly covered a distance of 80 + 1500 = 1580 yards. Since Kelly covered more distance than Blake, she is the winner. Therefore, the answer is 1580 - 1500 = 80 yards.
Response:  Raphael bought 4 stylos for $6 (4 x $1.5 = $6). He also bought 2 cahiers for $8 ($2 x $4 = $8). Finally, he bought paper for $20. So in total, Raphael spent $34 ($6 + $8 + $20).
Response:  We know that initially, Finn observed 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, he saw 6 of them emerge from beneath a water lily, leaving him with 5 tadpoles still visible above water. Next, he noticed 2 more hiding under a rock, so now there are only 3 tadpoles left in plain sight (the ones previously observable). Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 3.
Response:  On Monday, the water level was 17 feet deep. So, on Tuesday, the water level increased by 7 feet, making it 24 feet deep (17 + 7 = 24). Now, on Wednesday, the water level decreases to two-thirds of its previous depth, which is 16 feet (2/3 x 24 = 16). Therefore, the water level on Wednesday is 16 feet deep.
"Response:  We know that Anakin has caught 10 stars of the sea, 6 hippocamps and 3 fish clowns. Locsin has caught fewer stars than Anakin (by 5), fewer hippocamps than Anakin (by 3) and more fish clowns than Anakin (by 2). So, if we add up what each one has caught, we get: Anakin - 10 + 6 = 16; Locsin - 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, both have caught a total of 16 + 8 = 24 poissons."
Response:  After one month, the price of the bag will increase by 20%, so it will cost (100 + 20%) = 120$. After two months, the price will increase again by 20%,so it will cost(120+20%) = 144$. And so on... So after 36 months, the price of the bag will be : 144 x 36 = 5,072$. 
Response:  The total cost of all the toys is equal to the price of the poupée plus the prices of the three figurines. So we can write an equation as follows: $p + 3(5) = x where $p is the price of the poupée and x is the total cost of all the other toys. Now we are given that the price of the poupée is equal to the sum of the prices of the three figurines, so we can substitute this value into our equation: $p + 3(5) = 3(5) + 18 $p = 21 Substituting the value of $p = 10, we get the total cost of all the toys: $10 + 3(5) = 3(5) + 18 = 45 Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $45.
Response:  If she does it herself, she will save 3 hours of freelancing time x $ 35/hour = $ 105. So if she hires an accountant, she will have to pay him $ 90 + taxes. Therefore, her gain is $ 105 - ($ 90 + taxes). To calculate this amount, we need to know the tax rate. Let's assume a tax rate of 20%. Then her gain would be $ 105 - ($ 90 + 20% of $ 90) = $ 105 - $ 18 = $ 87.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items that Elvira has chosen:

* Computer: 1090 €
* Scanner: 157 €
* Graveur de CD: 74 €
* Imprimante: 102 €
Total cost = 1463 €
Now, let's check how much money Elvira had initially:

* Budget offered by her family: 1500 € - 1463 € = 37 €
So, Elvira will have 37 € left for buying clothes after purchasing all the computer accessories."
Response:  If Sandra needs to make 15 gâteaux à la crème and each gâteau requires 3 eggs, then she will need 45 eggs in total (15 x 3 = 45). Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she watches her daughter, Sandra will have enough eggs to make 45 / 9 = 5 gâteaux à la crème more than once. Therefore, she must guard the child 5 times.
Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 2B years old, where B is Brooke's age. In two years, their combined age will be 2 + (2B) = 2(B + 1). So, Seth's age is 2B = 40 years old.
"Response:  If Jimmy has $2 more than twice as much money as Ethel, and Ethel has $8, then we can write an equation based on this information:
Jimmy = 2 x Ethel + 2
Substituting Ethel's value of $8 into the equation gives us:
Jimmy = 2 x $8 + 2
= $16 + 2
= $18
Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
Response:  We know that Pancho walks 10 miles every Saturday and in addition to this he does 20 miles per day from Monday to Friday. So, we can calculate his total distance covered during the week as follows: Total distance = (Number of days x Distance per day) + (Saturday distance) Total distance = (5 days x 20 miles/day) + 10 miles = 100 miles + 10 miles = 110 miles Therefore, Pancho covers approximately 110 miles in a week while walking.
"Response:  The cost of each item is given as follows:
Chapeau = $25
Veste = 3 × $25 = $75
Pantalon = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $48.75
So, the total cost of each uniform is: $25 (for the hat) + $75 (for the jacket) + $48.75 (for the pants) = $148.75."
"Response: 
Jake sees 80 araignées with 8 legs each = 640 legs.
He also sees 90 insects with 6 legs each = 540 legs.
Finally, he sees 3 rare invertébrés with 10 legs each = 30 legs.
So in total, Jake sees 670 legs."
"Response:  We know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red and two times more aged than Sally Four. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Sally Two = 3 + (2 x Sally Four)
Now, according to the problem statement, Sally Four has the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. Therefore, we can substitute this value in the above equation:
Sally Two = 3 + (2 x Sally Thirtytwo)
We are also given that Sally Thirtytwo is eight years old. So, we can further simplify the equation:
Sally Two = 3 + 16
Simplifying further, we get:
Sally Two = 19
Therefore, the age of all four birds at the Caboose is 76 (4 x 19)."
"Response:  The total monthly payments for all debts are:
Prêt étudiant : 300$/month x 12 = 3600$/year
Carte de crédit : 200$/month x 12 = 2400$/year
Prêt hypothécaire : 500$/month x 12 = 6000$/year
Total monthly payments = 3600 + 2400 + 6000 = 11000$/year
If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will have to pay:
Minimum payment = 3600 + 2400 + 6000 = 11000$/year
Jessica has to pay 50% more than this amount, which is:
11000 x 1.5 = 16500$/year"
"Response:  We know that Billy needs to prepare 60 apples for his family barbecue. Each apple takes him approximately one and a half minutes (1 min 30 sec) to peel and cut. Therefore, he will need:
Time = Number of Apples x Time per Apple
= 60 x 1 min 30 sec
= 90 minutes (or 1 hour and 30 minutes)
So, it will take Billy 90 minutes to finish preparing all the potatoes for his family barbecue."
Response:  We know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell 20 glasses of lemonade and make a profit of $25. To calculate how much they spent on lemons, we can use the following formula: Bénefice = (Revenu - Coûts) So, in this case, the revenue is $20 (since each glass costs $0.50). The cost is $3 (for the lemons). Therefore, the benefit is: Benefit = ($20 - $3) = $17 So, they have spent $17 on lemons.
Response:  We know that there are 240 runners in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese runners is 240 - 80 = 160. Now, we know that among these Chinese runners, 60 are boys. Therefore, the number of girls among the Chinese runners is 160 - 60 = 100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is equal to 1500$ (since he earns 6000$ per month). Secondly, he spends 1/3 of his salary on fuel for his car, which is equal to 4000$ ( since he drives 10000 miles per year at an average cost of 40 cents per mile). Thirdly, he gives away half of what remains after all these expenses and donations, which is equal to 3000$. Fourthly, he gives 200$ to his daughter for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife for groceries and other household items. So, finally, he has 3000-$ (given) + 200-$ (spent on daughter) + 700-$ (spent on wife) = 2900$. Therefore, Zaid will have 2900$ left after all these expenses and donations.
"Response:  We know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monique, who has 4 less crabs than Bo. So, if we write it in mathematical notation:
Rani = Monique + (Monique - Bo)
= 4 + (-4)
= 8
So, Rani has 8 more crabs than Bo. Now, let's calculate the number of crabs Bo has:
Bo = 40
Now, let's add the number of crabs Rani has to the number of crabs Bo has:
Total number of crabs = Bo + Rani
= 40 + 8
= 48
Therefore, the total number of crabs is 48."
Response:  For the first week, Lloyd gave 5 hours of lessons and earned $5 x 5 = $25. For the second week, he gave 8 hours of lessons and earned $8 x 8 = $64. So, in total, Lloyd has earned $25 + $64 = $89 for the two weeks.
Response:  The number of votes obtained by the winner is 3/4 of the total number of votes cast, which means that the winner got (3/4) x 80 = 60 votes. Therefore, the number of votes obtained by the loser is 80 - 60 = 20 votes.
"Response:  If Sandra had ordered four times more red roses than white oleanders and five times as many Calla lilies as white oleanders, then...
Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses (red + white) that Sandra ordered.
Total number of roses = 4 x 200 + 5 x 20 = 800 roses.
Step 2: Calculate the number of red roses that Sandra ordered.
Number of red roses = Total number of roses - Number of white roses
= 800 - 200
= 600 red roses.
Step 3: Calculate the number of red roses that Fred must deliver before 17 hours to keep Sandra as a customer.
Number of red roses to be delivered = Amount Sandra threatened to switch suppliers with
= 600 red roses.
Therefore, Fred must deliver 600 red roses before 17 hours to keep Sandra as a customer."
"Response:  According to the information given in the problem, we know that:
Jean is two years older than Marc.
Two years ago, Marc was five years older than half of Jan's age.
Jan is currently 30 years old.
From the second statement, we can write:
Marc's current age = Half of Jan's age + 5
Substituting the value of Jan's age (30), we get:
Marc's current age = Half of 30 + 5 = 25
Now, from the first statement, we know that Jean is two years older than Marc. So, Jean's current age is:
Jean's current age = Marc's current age + 2 = 27
Therefore, Jean is 27 years old."
"Response:  The first team has all four members running in exactly 55 seconds each, so their total time for one lap is 220 seconds (55 + 55 + 55 + 55). Now, let's look at the other team. Their first member runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means they have run a total distance of 2400 meters (60 x 400) over two laps. Since each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one, we can calculate the time it takes them to complete one lap as follows: Runner 2: 58 seconds (60 - 3); Runner 3: 55 seconds (58 - 3); Runner 4: 52 seconds (55 - 3). So, the total time it takes this team to complete one lap is also 220 seconds (52 + 55 + 55 + 58). Therefore, if both teams race against each other, the team that is better trained will win by 10 seconds (220 - 210 = 10)."
Response:  The probability of getting an odd number is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%. So, the probability of getting an odd number more than twice in a row is (0.5)^2 = 0.0417 or approximately 4.17%.
Response:  We know that Jenna has collected fewer apples than her mother. So, if her mother collected 20 apples, then Jenna collected half of them, which is 10 apples. Therefore, in total, they have collected 30 apples (20 + 10).
"Response:  We know that there are three groups of rats in different sized cages and each rat receives six pieces of hay. So, we have:
Number of rats = Total number of rats / Number per cage
= 18 (total number of rats) / 6 (number per cage)
= 3 (rats per cage)
Now, let's find out how many cages there are for the rats. We know that there are ten cages for hamsters, but none of them contain any rats. Therefore, the total number of cages for rats is:
Total number of cages for rats = Number of cages for rats - Number of cages for hamsters
= 10 (cages for hamsters) - 0 (no cages for hamsters with rats)
= 10
So, there are ten cages for rats, and since each cage contains three rats, we can conclude that there are 3 x 10 = 30 rats in all the cages combined."
Response:  The amount of money that Mandy owes to Benedict is $100. They agreed on an interest rate of 2% per month. To find out how much Mandy needs to pay after 3 months, we can use the formula for calculating simple interest: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal (Mandy's debt) is $100, and the time is 3 months or 0.5 years. So, the interest would be: Interest = $100 x 2% x 0.5 = $10. Therefore, if Mandy wants to settle her debt at the end of 3 months, she must give Benedict $110 ($100 + $10).
Response:  The cost of one bag is $20 + $2 = $22 per bag. Since all bags were sold for $30 each, the profit made per bag is $30 - $22 = $8 per bag. To find out how many bags he has sold, we need to divide the total profit ($400) by the profit per bag ($8): $400 / $8 = 50 bags. So, the trader has sold 50 bags of wheat.
Response:  The total cost of the tickets is $20.25 + (4.50 - $3) = $27.75. Since they made two turns on the merry-go-round at $33 each, that's an additional $66. So in total, they spent $27.75 + $66 = $93.75. If they split this amount equally among themselves, each person will have paid $93.75 / 3 = $31.25.
Response:  If Jean picks apples for 3 hours, he will have picked x apples in total. Since he picks 2 apples per minute, he has picked 60 apples (x/3) during those 3 hours. So, Jean has picked 60 apples in total.
Response:  Since les canards (ducks) need to eat 3,5 pounds of insects per week, we must divide this amount among themselves if there are ten ducks in total. So, each duck needs to eat approximately 0.35 pounds of insects per day (3,5 pounds / 10 ducks = 0.35 pounds/day).
"Response: 
Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees each year. So in total he has planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees.
Now, after 10 years, 30% of the trees have died, which means that 30/100 = 30 trees have died.
So, Tom still has 70 trees left (100 - 30 = 70)."
Response:  On Friday morning, there were 18 original pink flamingos in Sue's garden. Then, on Saturday morning, her neighbors took away 6 of them and painted them white (so now there are 12 white flamingos). Finally, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos to the mix (bringing the total number to 30). So at midday on Sunday, there were 30 - 6 = 24 pink flamingos in Sue's garden, in addition to the 12 white ones.
Response:  Since she needs 5 different colors of crayons and has planned to spend $20 for that, we can calculate the number of crayons she will buy as follows: Number of crayons = Total amount spent / Cost per crayon = $20 / $2 = 10 crayons So, Violetta will have $20 - ($2 x 10) = $20 - $20 = $0 in monnaie after buying the crayons.
Response:  If one stylo costs as much as one crayon and one gum, then eight stylos will cost as much as eight times the price of one crayon and one gum. Therefore, the price of eight stylos is 8 x (1,20 + 0,30) = 96$.
Response:  We have to distribute 200 pounds of carrots among 40 restaurants. Since each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots, we need to divide 200 pounds by 40 restaurants, which gives us 5 pounds per restaurant (or 0.05 tons). So, 95 pounds (or 0.95 tons) of carrots will not be used or wasted.
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23 786 inhabitants in Soda. Of these, 8 417 are men and 9 092 are women. This means that the total number of adults (men + women) is 8 417 + 9 092 = 17 509. Now, we need to find out how many children there are in Soda. Since the rest of the population consists of children, we can deduce that the number of children is equal to the total population minus the number of adults. Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 23 786 - 17 509 = 6 277. So, there are 6 277 children living in Soda.
Response:  At first month, Elaine had 20 cards. Then she collected three times more than that in one month, so at second month she had 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). In third month, she collected 20 less than what she collected in second month, so she had 40 cards left (60 - 20 = 40). Finally, she collected twice as many cards as she collected in first two months, so she has 80 cards now (40 x 2 = 80). Therefore, Elaine currently has 80 Pokémon cards.
Response:  We know that Marc edits a total of 1,000 phrases per week for both editors. Since editor B pays him twice as much as editor A, Marc earns $2 \times 5$ = $10$ cents per phrase from Editor B and $5$ cents per phrase from Editor A. Therefore, his total weekly income is $10 + 5 = $15$ cents per phrase or $150$ per week.
Response:  In total, Baldur fills 5 + 6 = 11 seaux with water per day. Since each seau contains 5 liters of water, he recovers 5 x 11 = 55 liters of water per day.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jean receives a prize of $5,000 and an increase in salary of 5%. We also know that he earns $2,000 per week throughout the year. So, his total income for the year will be:
$5,000 + (5% of $2,000) = $5,000 + $100 = $5,100
Therefore, Jean has earned a total of $5,100 this year."
Response:  We know that Josie has a farm of 10 acres and produces 5 tons of grapes per acre. So, she produces 5 x 10 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total number of barrels of wine produced as follows: 50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year. Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.
"Response: 
1. Sandwiches: Carl had one sandwich per day for lunch and used two slices of cheese in each sandwich. Therefore, he has used 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.
2. Omelets: He had omelets with eggs and cheese three days a week, using an extra slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. So, he used (3 x 2 + 3) / 2 = 6 slices of cheese for omelets.
3. Macaroni and cheese: He made a large batch of macaroni and cheese to have several meals this week, using 8 slices of cheese in his preparation.
Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl has used is: 14 + 6 + 8 = 38 slices of cheese."
Response:  We know that Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, for a total of 32 pens. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens containing 9 pens each, so she got 54 blue pens in total. Finally, she bought 2 bags of red pens containing 6 pens each, so she got 12 red pens in total. Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has now is 32 + 54 + 12 = 108 pens.
"Response:  If Brinley has obtained the following scores in the first five tests:

Test 1: 89
Test 2: 71
Test 3: 92
Test 4: 100
Test 5: 86
Then, for the sixth test, let's assume that she obtains a score of x. Since Bert allows her to drop the lowest score, we can calculate the new average as follows:

Average = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 - x

Now, we want Brinley to have an average of 93 after the sixth test. So, we need to find the value of x such that the above expression equals 93.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 93 - (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5
= 93 - 450 / 5
= -365 / 5
= -73

Therefore, if Brinley gets a score of 73 in the sixth test, she will have an overall average of 93."
Response:  We know that Michael did cycling for four weeks and then reduced it to twice a week. So, in total he did cycling for 4 + 3 = 7 weeks. Now, we are given that he covered 25 km per session during the first four weeks and 60 km per session during the last three weeks. Therefore, his total distance covered is: Total distance = (Number of sessions x Distance per session) = (7 x 25) + (7 x 60) = 175 + 420 = 595 km.
Response:  The total weight of all candies in the bag is given as 25 bars of chocolate and 80 pieces of fruit. So, the total weight = 25 x 40 + 80 = 1600 grams (or 1.6 kg). Since each bar of chocolate weighs twice as much as a piece of fruit, the number of pieces of fruit is half that of the bars of chocolate. Therefore, there are 25/2 = 12 pieces of fruit per bar of chocolate. So, the weight of one bar of chocolate = 40g / 2 = 20g. Now, let's find out how many grams of chocolate are in the bag: 1600 grams - (12 x 20) grams = 1360 grams of chocolate.
Response:  On Monday (Lundi), Rose bought 4 gâteaux in one store. On Tuesday (Mardi), she bought three times more gâteaux than she bought on Monday, so she bought 12 gâteaux (3 x 4 = 12) in another store. On Wednesday (Mercredi), she went to yet another store and bought 5 times as many gâteaux as she bought on Tuesday, so she bought 60 gâteaux (5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, during these three days, Rose bought a total of 76 gâteaux (4 + 12 + 60 = 76).
"Response:  We know that vingt douzaines of tasses cost $1 200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold for $6 000 each. So we can write an equation as follows:
Tassen price = (Plate price - Discount) / 2
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
Tassen price = ($6 000 - $1 200) / 2
= $3 000 / 2
= $1 500 per tasse
Therefore, the price of one tasse is $1 500."
"Response: 
Sarah has already saved $10 before starting to babysit. She earns $5 per time she babysits for the children of her neighbor and $4 each time she trims their grass.
To calculate how many times she needs to trim the grass, we can divide the cost of the vest ($30) and the shoes ($60 total) by the amount she earns per time she trims the grass:
$30 / $5 = 6 times (trimming the grass)
$60 / $4 = 15 times (trimming the grass)
So, Sarah needs to trim the grass 6 or 15 times depending on which calculation you prefer to use in order to save enough money to buy the new vest and shoes."
Response:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and we are told that each red hen lays 3 eggs per day, so there are 14 red hens (42 / 3 = 14). Now, since Jerry has two more white hens than he does red hens, this means he has 2 more white hens than red hens, which is equal to 2 x 5 = 10 additional eggs produced by whites. Therefore, in total, Jerry collects 42 + 10 = 52 eggs per day. So, Jerry has 14 red hens and 10 white hens, for a total of 24 hens.
Response:  The park is 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide, so its area is 1.5 x 6 = 9 square miles. If Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour, it means he covers 3 miles in one hour. Therefore, to find out how many hours he spends walking along the park boundary, we can divide the length of the park (9 miles) by his walking speed (3 miles/hour): 9 miles / 3 miles/hour = 3 hours. So, Gary spends 3 hours walking along the park boundary.
Response:  On day one (Au magasin à un dollar), Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. On day two (Le lendemain), she counted 50 more customers than the previous day, so she counted 150 customers in total. On day three (Si le troisième jour), if the number of customers was 500, then Sloane counted 350 customers that day (500 - 150 = 350). Therefore, Sloane counted 350 customers on day three.
Response:  We know that Jerry has two pools with leaks that empty them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now it has four times as much water. So we can write an equation based on this information: Large pool water = Small pool water x 2 + (4 minutes x 4 gallons/minute). Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Large pool water = Small pool water x 2 + (4 x 4 gal/min) = Small pool water x 2 + 16 gal. Since the small pool initially had 8 gallons of water, we can set up the equation: Small pool water = 8 - (Small pool water x 2 + 16). Solving for the current amount of water in the small pool, we get: Small pool water = 8 - (2x8 + 16) = 8 - 16 = 0 gallons. Therefore, the small pool currently contains no water.
"Response:  To calculate how many hours she needs to work before being able to buy the shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost of the items (shoes + belt) by her hourly wage. So, if the total cost is 320,00 $ and her hourly wage is 8,00 $/h, then she will have to work for:
320,000 / 8,00 = 40,000 hours
So, Lori has to work for 40,000 hours before being able to afford the shoes and belt."
"Response:  We know that Janet borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed as interest. So, the total amount she needs to pay is:
$2,000 + (10% of $2,000) = $2,300
Since she has to pay $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate how much money will be left for her at the end of the period:
$2,300 / $165 = 14 months
So, there will be $2,300 / 14 = $169 left for Janet after she pays off the loan."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 dahlias more than roses. So, if we have x rose...

Solution: Let's think step by step. We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 dahlias more than roses. So, if we have x roses, then we have 7x dahlias. In total, we have x + 7x = 11 flowers in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 18 flowers."
Response:  Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian's age = 3H. Since Zack has half of Adrian's age, Zack's age = 0.5A. In three years, their ages will be: A = A + 3, H = H + 3, and Z = Z + 3. Now we can calculate the average age as follows: Age avg = (A + H + Z) / 3. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Age avg = ((3(21)) + 21 + 3)/3 = 74. So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be 74.
Response:  We know that Naomi has scored 68 points and Yuri has scored more than half of Naomi's score (which is 34). So Yuri has scored at least 34 points. Brianna has scored 17 points more than Naomi, which means she has scored at least 85 points (since Naomi scored 68 points). Finally, we know that Jojo has scored fewer points than any of the other three students. Therefore, Jojo has scored less than 85 points. In fact, since none of the four students have scored exactly 85 points, it must be that Jojo has scored 68 points or fewer. So the answer is 68.
Response:  We know that Carmen took 10 minutes to finish one grille of words crossword and 5 minutes for another. So she spent in total 10 + 5 = 15 minutes playing with these games during the weekend. Then we know that she resolved 3 grids of words crosswords and 8 grids of Sudoku, so she spent (3 x 10) + (8 x 5) = 45 minutes playing with these games. Therefore, Carmen passed 45 minutes playing at those games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water to water her garden. So initially, there were 120 - 90 = 30 liters of water left in the reservoir. Then, it is mentioned that two times more rainwater entered the reservoir than what was remaining earlier. Therefore, if two times more rainwater entered the reservoir, then the total amount of water in the reservoir after rainfall would be 30 + (2 x 30) = 60 liters. Hence, there are now 60 liters of water in the reservoir. 
Response:  We know that Andy has 90 geraniums and 40 petunias in total. So, he must have planted some number of petunias less than 90 to end up with 40 petunias left. Let's call this number x. Then, we can write the equation: 90 - x = 40. Now, we need to solve for x. To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by 90: x / 90 = 40 / 90. Simplifying, we get x = 16. Therefore, Andy plants 16 petunias in total.
Response:  In year 1, the company spends $15,000 in advertising. Then, in year 2, it spends $\frac{15,000}{3} = 5,000$ in advertising. So, the total amount spent on advertising over these two years is $15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000$.
Response:  The cost of renting a canoe for one hour is $30. So if Carlos uses it for three hours, he will pay $30 x 3 = $90. Similarly, Benji will pay $18 x 5 = $90 for using his boat banana for five hours. Therefore, the total amount they will have to pay together is $90 + $90 = $180.
Response:  If it takes him 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester and half of that time for the return trip in a car, then he will need 12 days (6/2 = 12) to make both trips combined. Therefore, if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will need 12 days for the entire trip.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that James had 40 cards of type water before losing 8 cards. So, he now has 40 - 8 = 32 cards of type water. 
Now, when he buys new cards, he buys 14 cards of type herb. So, his total number of cards of type herb is now 20 + 14 = 34 cards of type herb. 
So, the percentage of chances that an arbitrary card chosen at random will be of type water is: (32/76) x 100 = 42%"
Response:  The total cost of the burrito is: Base price + Additional toppings = 6,50 + (2+1+1+2) = 12,75 + Premium option = 12,75 + 3 = 15,75 dollars. Since he used his gift card for 5 dollars, he will pay: 15,75 - 5 = 10,75 dollars. So, he has 10,75 dollars left to pay.
"Response:  If Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place 2 pieces per minute, then they will have to work together for x minutes to complete the puzzle. We know that the total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360, so we can write an equation as follows:
x = 360 / (4 + 2)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 180 minutes
Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mother 180 minutes to complete the puzzle."
"Response: 
Ashlyn visited the farm after two months and found that 30% of the peppers were ready to be harvested. So she picked 30% of them (which is equal to 36 peppers).
Then, two weeks later, when she returned, 3/4 of the remaining peppers were ready to be harvested. This means that 75% of the original number of peppers remained (since 3/4 is equal to 75%).
So, if initially there were 120 peppers, then after Ashlyn picked some, there were 84 peppers left (120 x 75%). And finally, after another two weeks, there were 60 peppers left (84 x 75%).
Therefore, the number of peppers that were not yet ready for harvest after those two weeks was 60 - 36 = 24 peppers."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Marc spends on each car:
Tax = 10% of 20,000$ = 2,000$
Registration fee = 1,000$ per car
Total cost for one car = 20,000$ + 2,000$ + 1,000$ = 23,000$
Now, let's find out how many cars Marc bought:
Marc bought 12 cars
So, total amount spent on all cars = Number of cars x Total cost per car = 12 x 23,000$ = 276,000$
Therefore, Marc depostes 276,000$ in total."
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she collected 5 + 20 = 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she collected on Monday, so she collected 2 \* 25 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there are 50 fourmis in the garden and Dax found twice fewer insects than fourmis, then the number of insects is half of 50 = 25. So, the total number of insects in the garden is 25 + 25 (the original number of insects) = 50.
"Response:  The total number of penguins is 36. Now, let's analyze what happens to each group:

* Group that goes swimming: 1/3 = 12 penguins (since there are 36 penguins in total)
* Group that goes inside the cave for dinner: 1/3 = 12 penguins (again, since there are 36 penguins in total)

So, the remaining penguins who continue taking the sun bath are also 12. Therefore, the final answer is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins who continue to take the sun bath."
Response:  If Steve wants to eat twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend (who eats 2 per day), then he will need to grow enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend combined. So, if his girlfriend eats 2 tomatoes per day, then Steve needs to grow enough tomatoes for 4 days of consumption (since he wants to eat twice as much). Therefore, he needs to grow 8 tomatoes per day (4 days x 2 tomatoes/day = 8 tomatoes/day). Since one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, Steve will need 8 / 3 = 2.67 vines to meet his daily demand. So, he will need approximately 3 vines to satisfy his daily requirement of tomatoes.
Response:  Since there are 20 friends and each friend will have 4 parts of the pizza, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many whole pizzas Jean needs to order. So, Jean needs to order 5 whole pizzas (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  If he can mix the ink of five empty pens to make one full pen, then he will get 5/1 = 5 pens from each of the 25 pens he buys. So, in total, he will get 5 x 25 = 125 pens.
Response:  If Johnny had $20 and added $10 to it, he would have $30 in total. Then, if this amount tripled in one year, he would have $90 at the end of the year. So, Johnny had $90 after one year.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:
Marie is two years younger than Jeanne, so Jeanne is five years older than Marie.
Jeanne is five years older than Jessa, which means Jessa is five years younger than Jeanne.
Jessa is 20 years old.
Now let's calculate the ages of each girl:
Jeanne - 5 = 15 (age)
Marie - 2 = 18 (age)
Jessa - 5 = 15 (age)
So, the sum of their ages is:
15 + 18 + 15 = 48 years"
Response:  We know that there are 1000 students in total and they have to leave through one of three exits (A, B or C). After the meeting, 30% of the students left through exit A, which means 300 students left through this exit. Now, we need to find out how many students left through exit B and exit C. Since 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, the number of students who left through exit B is equal to 3/5 x 700 = 210 students. Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is equal to 700 - 210 = 490 students. So, the number of students who left through exit C is 490.
Response:  We know that Jacques has 6 more bonbons than Robert, so Jacques has 6 + x bonbons where x is the number of bonbons that Robert has. Since Jean has twice as many bonbons as Robert, Jean has 2(x) = 2x bonbons. Finally, we know that Jean has 54 bonbons in total, so 54 = 2x + 6, and solving for x gives us x = 30. Therefore, Jacques has 30 bonbons more than Jacques.
"Response: 
Dolly has two books to read, so she will have read two books in total at the end.
Pandora only has one book to read, so she will have read one book in total at the end.
So, in total, both girls will have read 3 books (2 + 1) at the end of the activity."
"Response: 
Mike has been corresponding with 5 people and then stopped corresponding with 2 of them. So, he is now corresponding with 3 people. Each person sends him 2 letters of 5 pages each every week, so Mike receives 6 letters per week (3 people x 2 letters/person x 5 pages/letter).
Since Mike can write one page in 6 minutes, it will take him 6 minutes to write one letter. Therefore, he spends 1 hour (6 minutes/week) writing letters for all 3 people he is corresponding with.
So, Mike spends 1 hour per week writing letters."
Response:  We know that Jason has a monthly phone plan of 1,000 minutes and he spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day. So, in one month, he talks to his boss for 15 x 30 = 450 minutes. Now, we need to find out how many additional minutes he spent this month. He said he spent 300 extra minutes on calls to other people. So, the total number of minutes he used this month is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes. Therefore, there are 250 minutes left (1,000 - 750).
"Response:  We know that:
* Griffin had 24 fries initially.
* Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
* Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle (so he took 10 fries).
* Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries (we don't know how many).
* Colby took 3 fries less than what Kyle took.

So, let's summarize:
Griffin started with 24 fries, then lost 5 to Kyle, gained 10 from Ginger, and lost 3 due to Colby. Therefore, the total number of fries Griffin has at the end is:
24 - 5 + 10 - 3 = 27

Now, we can see that Ginger gave Griffin a total of 27 fries, since she gave him a ""handful"" which is equal to 27 fries."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in another. If we subtract the number of snails in each aquarium from the total number of snails, we get:
Total number of snails = 4 + 32 = 36
Now, let's consider the fish. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is equal to twice the sum of the number of fish in the two aquariums. So, if we divide the total number of snails by 2, we get:
Number of fish in first aquarium = Total number of snails / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
Similarly, the number of fish in the second aquarium is:
Number of fish in second aquarium = Total number of snails / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
Therefore, there are 18 fish in each aquarium."
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate how much time Jeanne spent with the makeup artist per week. As she needs to go for the makeover every day from Monday to Friday, and each session takes 6 hours, then total number of hours per week is:
$$ Total hours/week = 4 days \times 6 hours/day = 24 hours/week $$
Now, let's calculate the total amount paid by Jeanne to the makeup artist over the course of the 5 weeks:
$$ Total amount = Number of hours \times Hourly rate = 24 hours/week \times $250/hour = $6,000/week $$
Since the movie lasted for 5 weeks, Jeanne has paid a total of:
$$ Total amount = 5 weeks \times $6,000/week = $30,000 $$
Finally, since the makeup artist gave her a discount of 10%, Jeanne will receive a refund of:
$$ Refund = Total amount \times (1 - Discount percentage) = $30,000 \times (1 - 0.10) = $27,000 $$
Therefore, Jeanne has paid a total of $30,000 to the makeup artist, and received a refund of $27,000, leaving her with a net cost of $3,000."
"Response:  We know that Isabelle has shared the cost of the party with her two parents. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:

Isabelle's share = Total cost / Number of people

We are given the following information about the total cost of the party:

Total cost = 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 106 $

Now, let's find out how much each person (including Isabelle) paid for the party:

Isabelle's share = 106 $ / 3 = 35 $ per person

Therefore, the answer is: Each person paid 35$."
"Response:  If one pound of oysters costs $1.50, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many pounds of oysters each bag contains. Since there are 4 bags, and each bag contains 50 pounds of oysters, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of pounds in each bag = Number of bags x Number of pounds per bag
= 4 x 50
= 200 pounds

Step 2: Multiply the number of pounds of oysters in each bag by the cost per pound to find out how much the chef has spent overall:

Total amount spent = Number of pounds x Cost per pound
= 200 x $1.50
= $300

Therefore, the chef has spent $300 on the 4 bags of oysters."
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more than her sister, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 biscuits. Then, on Tuesday, she ate 2 times more than her sister, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 biscuits. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 biscuits. Since each biscuit contains 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 46 x 200 = 9200 calories more than her sister. Therefore, the correct answer is 9200 calories.
