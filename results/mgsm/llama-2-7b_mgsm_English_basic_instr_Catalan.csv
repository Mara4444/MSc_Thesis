"Response:  The boots cost $50.
Razón:  To find out how many dollars the boots cost, we need to subtract the total cost of the three options from the original amount Gloria had available for shoes. Since the boots cost $40 (as per the problem statement), and the total cost of the three options is $38 ($33 + $2 x $33 = $38), we can conclude that the boots cost $50 - $38 = $12."

"Response:  To find out how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax, we need to divide the weight of the beeswax by the weight of a single candle. Since each candle weighs approximately 1/4 pound (or 8 ounces), we can calculate this as follows:

1 lb = 16 oz
1/4 lb = 4 oz

So, Charlie can make 4 candles with one pound of beeswax.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of making these candles:

Cost of beeswax = $10.00 per pound
Number of pounds needed = 4 candles / 1 pound = 0.25 pounds
Total cost of beeswax = $10.00 x 0.25 = $2.50

Next, let's calculate the cost of the wicks:

Cost of wicks = $2.00 per 100 wicks
Number of wicks needed = 4 candles / 10 tapered candles = 0.4 candles
Total cost of wicks = $2.00 x 0.4 = $0.80

Finally, let's calculate the net profit from selling these candles:

Selling price of candles = $2.00 per candle
Number of candles sold = 20 candles
Net profit = Selling price x Number of candles sold - Total cost of making candles
= $2.00 x 20 - ($2.50 + $0.80)
= $40.00 - $3.30
= $36.70

Therefore, Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles would be $36.70."

Explanation: Let's assume that the building has a total of n units, where n = 15 (number of floors) x 8 (number of units per floor). Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units can be calculated as follows: Occupied units = n / 4 = 15 / 4 = 375 units. Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is: Unoccupied units = n - Occupied units = 15 - 375 = 360 units."

Explanation:
Jim watches TV for 2 hours per session, so he spends 2 x 3 = 6 hours on TV per week. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 6 x 4 = 24 hours on TV in 4 weeks.
Similarly, since he reads for half as long as he watches TV, he spends 24 / 2 = 12 hours on reading per week. So, he spends 12 x 4 = 48 hours on reading in 4 weeks.
Therefore, the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 24 + 48 = 72 hours."

Razón:  Para calcular el número total de gemas en el tesoro, podemos utilizar las informaciones proporcionales dadas en la pregunta. Tenemos que:

* El número de diamantes es 175 (dado en la pregunta)
* El número de rubis es 35 menores que los diamantes (o 175 - 35 = 140)
* El número de emeralds es dos veces el número de rubis (o 2 x 140 = 280)

Por lo tanto, el número total de gemas en el tesoro es: 175 + 140 + 280 = 400."

Explanation:  To find out how much less laundry Raymond does than David, we need to subtract the amount of laundry that Sarah does from the total amount of laundry that all three people do. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, she does 4 x 400 = 1600 pounds of laundry. So, the total amount of laundry done by all three people is 1600 + 250 = 1850 pounds. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 1850 - 250 = 1600 pounds."

Explanation:  First, we need to find out how much one watermelon costs. Since it costs three times as much as a pepper, one watermelon costs 3 x 15 = 45. Then, we can find out how many peppers Dillon needs to buy by dividing the number of watermelons he wants (4) by the price of one watermelon (45): 4 / 45 = 89 peppers. Finally, we can find out how much one orange costs by subtracting 5 from the cost of a watermelon: 45 - 5 = 40. So, Dillon will spend 89 x 15 = 1395 on peppers and 40 x 10 = 400 on oranges, for a total of 1795."

Por qué?:  Para calcular el número de bloques que Johnny ha recogido, debemos sumar el número de bloques de cada paquete. El paquete con 500 piezas tiene 500 bloques, el paquete con tres veces más piezas (o 1500 piezas) también tiene 500 bloques y el paquete con un cuarto de las piezas (o 125 piezas) tiene 375 bloques. Entonces, el total de bloques que Johnny ha recogido es:

500 + 500 + 375 = 2768

Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to calculate the time it takes for each student to reach their respective homes. We know that Steve's distance is 3 miles (which is equal to 3 x 5,280 = 15,740 feet) and he can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Therefore, the time it takes him to reach his home is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 15,740 / 440 = 35 minutes
Now, let's find out how long Tim will take to reach his home. Since Tim's distance is 2 miles (which is equal to 2 x 5,280 = 10,560 feet), and he can skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, the time it takes him to reach his home is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes
Since Steve lives farther away than Tim, he will finish the race first. The winner will arrive at Tim's house after 35 minutes, which means the loser (Tim) will have to wait for 40 - 35 = 5 minutes for the winner to arrive."

Response:  After 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost $48.  Explanation: To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase for each month using the percentage increase provided in the question (20% of the original price). We can then multiply this amount by the number of months that have passed since the last price increase to get the new price. In this case, the calculation is as follows: Month 1: Price = $20 x 20% = $4 Month 2: Price = $20 + $4 = $24 Month 3: Price = $24 x 20% = $4.80 Month 4: Price = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80... etc. Continuing this process until the end of the 36th month, we get: Price at end of 36 months = $20 x 20% = $4 + $48 = $52 So, after 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost $52.

Response:  To find out how much each uniform costs, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's start by finding the cost of the hat: Hat Cost = $25 Since the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, we can find the cost of the jacket by multiplying the cost of the hat by 3: Jacket Cost = 3 x $25 = $75 Now, we need to find the average of the costs of the hat and jacket to determine the cost of the pants: Average Cost = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50 Therefore, the cost of each uniform is: Total Uniform Cost = Hat Cost + Jacket Cost + Pants Cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $140 So, each uniform costs $140.

Ram uses a lot of pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?
Let's assume that each pen contains x milliliters (mL) of ink. Since Ram mixes the ink from five pens, the total amount of ink he has is 5x mL. When he uses this ink to make new pens, he will be able to create y new pens, where y is the number of pens he gets to have after mixing the ink.
We know that the volume of ink in each new pen is equal to the volume of ink in the original pens, so we can write:
y = 5x / 5 = x
Therefore, Ram gets to have 100 pens (since 100 = 5x / 5)."
