"Response:  To calculate how much money Janet makes selling eggs at the market each day, we need to know how many eggs she has left after giving three to her friends in the morning and how many she sells at the market. Let's assume she has 16 eggs left after giving three to her friends. If she sells all 16 eggs at the market for $2 per egg, then she would make:  
16 x $2 = $32 per day  
So, Janet makes $32 per day selling eggs at the market."

Response:  To find out how many meters James runs in one week, we need to multiply the distance he runs each time by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). So, if James runs 60 meters each time, he runs a total of 60 x 7 = 420 meters per week.
Response:  If Wendy has 20 pigs and gives them three separate meals per day with 15 cups of food in the morning, 25 cups of food at midday, and she wants to give them the same amount of food for their last meal of the day, then she should give them 25 x 3 = 75 cups of food for their last meal.
Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 cups of coffee, we need to calculate the total cost of all 16 cups first. Since each cup costs $5 except every second cup which costs 60% of the price, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows: Let x be the number of regular cups (i.e., not every second cup) and y be the number of every second cups. Then, the total cost of all cups is given by: Total Cost = x \* 5 + y \* 0.6\*5 Total Cost = x \* 5 + 0.6x \* 5 We know that Kylar wants to buy 16 cups in total, so we can substitute 16 for x + y: Total Cost = (16 - y) \* 5 + 0.6(y) \* 5 Substituting y = 8 (since there are 8 every second cups), we get: Total Cost = (16 - 8) \* 5 + 0.6(8) \* 5 Total Cost = 8 \* 5 + 4.8 \* 5 Total Cost = 40 + 24 Total Cost = 64 Now we have found the total cost of all 16 cups: Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 cups of coffee.
"Response:  To find out how many sheep there are in total among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to multiply the number of sheep each city has by the number of cities (3). So, if Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, then:

Toulouse = 2 x 4 = 8 times as many sheep as Seattle
Charleston = 4 x 2 = 8 times as many sheep as Seattle
Seattle = 20 sheep

So, together they have:

Toulouse = 8 x 20 = 160 sheep
Charleston = 8 x 20 = 160 sheep
Seattle = 20 sheep

Therefore, they have a total of:

160 + 160 + 20 = 340 sheep."
Response:  To calculate how much time it will take to download a file of 200 GB with an initial download speed of 2 GB/minute and a 40% loss in speed due to Windows updates, we can use the formula: Time = (File Size / Download Speed) x (1 - Loss Percentage). Plugging in the values, we get: Time = (200 GB / 2 GB/min) x (1 - 0.4) = 100 minutes x 0.6 = 60 minutes. Therefore, it will take approximately 60 minutes to download the 200 GB file.
Response:  To find out how far John is from home after driving for 4 hours, we need to calculate his total distance traveled during that time. We know that he drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour, and then spent 2 hours stuck in traffic, driving at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour. Therefore, the total distance traveled by John can be calculated as follows: Distance = Speed x Time + (Speed x Time) x (1/2) +... + (Speed x Time) x (1/n), where n is the number of intervals of constant speed. In this case, there are three intervals of constant speed: 3 hours at 60 mph, 2 hours at 30 mph, and 1 hour at 80 mph. Using the formula above, we get: Distance = 60 mi/h x 3 h + 30 mi/h x 2 h + 80 mi/h x 1 h = 180 mi + 60 mi + 80 mi = 320 mi So, John is 320 miles away from home after driving for 4 hours.
"Response:  To calculate how much Elizabeth earns for the week, we need to first calculate her total hours worked. We know that she works 40 hours per week at $10 per hour, so her total hours worked is:  

Total Hours Worked = 40 hours x 1 week = 40 weeks  

Next, we know that she also works overtime and receives 1.2 times her normal hourly rate for overtime pay. So, if she worked 5 extra hours (45 - 40 = 5), her overtime pay would be:  

Overtime Pay = 5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 = $60  

Now, let's add up all of Elizabeth's earnings for the week:  

Total Earnings = Total Hours Worked x Normal Hourly Rate + Overtime Pay  
= 40 hours x $10/hour + $60  
= $400 + $60  
= $460  
Therefore, Elizabeth earns $460 for the week."
"Response:  The program was downloaded 60 times in the first month and three times as many downloads occurred during the second month (180). However, there was a 30% decrease in downloads during the third month, so the total number of downloads for the three months is:

60 + 180 - 54 = 296

Therefore, the program was downloaded 296 times over the course of the three months."
"Response:  To find out how much everything cost in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them up. Let's do that:  
1. Понички (3 души): 3 x 68 = 204 $  
2. Мини кексчета (2 души): 2 x 80 = 160 $  
3. Мини чийзкейкчета (6 души): 6 x 55 = 330 $  
Total Cost: 204 + 160 + 330 = 794 $"
"Response:  To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to consider the following costs and revenues:

* Initial cost of planting the tree: $90
* Annual maintenance costs (fertilizer and irrigation): $3 per year
* Annual revenue from selling lemons: $7 per year

To break even, or start making a profit, Carlos needs to earn enough money from selling lemons to cover the annual maintenance costs plus the initial investment in planting the tree. We can calculate this by setting up an equation:

$7 (annual revenue) - $3 (annual maintenance costs) = $6 (profit)

Since Carlos wants to make a profit of at least $6 per year, he needs to sell lemons for at least $6 per year. This means that the price of each lemon should be at least:

$6 (profit) / 7 (number of lemons sold per year) = $1.43 (minimum price per lemon)

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to reach this minimum price per lemon:

$90 (initial investment) / ($1.43 (minimum price per lemon)) = 62.86 years

Therefore, it will take approximately 63 years for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, assuming he sells all 7 lemons per year and there are no other expenses or changes in market conditions."
Response:  If Melanie started with 5 praxiums and sold one-third of them in the green house, two in the red house, and half of what was left in the orange house, then she would have had 5 + (1/3) + (2) + (1/2) = 5 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 10 praxiums at the end.
Response:  To find out what percentage of all students have enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to use the information that 20% of the students are enrolled in modern dance and 25% of the remaining students (i.e., those who did not choose modern dance) are enrolled in jazz dance. Let X be the number of students who have enrolled in hip-hop dance. Since 20% of the students are enrolled in modern dance, there are 20/100 \* 20 = 4 students enrolled in modern dance. Similarly, since 25% of the remaining students (i.e., 80% of the total number of students) are enrolled in jazz dance, there are 80/100 \* (20 - 4) = 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. Therefore, the total number of students enrolled in either modern or jazz dance is 4 + 16 = 20. Now, we can calculate the percentage of students who have enrolled in hip-hop dance as follows: Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (X / 20) * 100% X is the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, which we want to find out. We know that there are 20 students enrolled in either modern or jazz dance, so we can set up the following equation: X + 4 + 16 = 20 Solving for X, we get: X = 20 - 4 - 16 = 20 - 20 = 0 Since there are no students enrolled in hip-hop dance, the percentage of students who have enrolled in hip-hop dance is 0%.
"Response:  To determine which option would provide a higher profit at the end of the month, we need to calculate the expected percentage change in the value of each item and then compare them. Let's assume that the current price of the jewelry is $5,000 and the current price of the electronics is $8,000.  
For the jewelry:  
Expected percentage change = (2.5%/100) x ($5,000) = 0.025 x $5,000 = $125  
New value after one month = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125  
For the electronics:  
Expected percentage change = (1.2%/100) x ($8,000) = 0.012 x $8,000 = $96  
New value after one month = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096  
Since the new value of the electronics after one month is higher than the new value of the jewelry, it would be more profitable for the trader to choose the electronics plan."
"Response:  The distance traveled by each train for the two days is as follows:
Day 1 (westward journey):
Train A travels for 80 miles.
Train B travels for 80 miles.
Total distance = 80 + 80 = 160 miles

Day 2 (northward journey):
Train A travels for 240 km.
Train B travels for 240 km.
Total distance = 240 + 240 = 480 km

Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains over the two days is:
160 + 480 = 640 km"
Response:  To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to first determine how many hours she works as an instructor and as a coach per week. Let's assume that she works 35 hours per week as an instructor (50 weeks/year x 35 hours/week) and 15 hours per week as a coach (50 weeks/year x 15 hours/week). Next, let's calculate her hourly wage for each job: Instructor: $20/hour Coach: $30/hour Now, let's multiply her weekly hours by her hourly wage to get her total weekly earnings for each job: Instructor: $35/week x 35 hours/week = $1,225/week Coach: $15/week x 15 hours/week = $450/week Finally, let's add up her weekly earnings from both jobs to get her total weekly income: Total weekly income = $1,225 + $450 = $1,675 per week Since there are 52 weeks in a year (ignoring any vacation time), Jill's annual salary would be: Annual salary = Total weekly income x Number of weeks worked per year Total weekly income x 52 weeks/year = $1,675 x 52 = $89,300 per year
Response:  If Клеър makes 3 omelets with 3 eggs each per day for 4 weeks (4 seдмици), then she will use 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day or 9 x 28 = 252 eggs for the entire period.
Response:  To find out how fast Marisa needs to go for the remaining distance, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance left, r is the rate (speed), and t is time. We know that she has already walked 4 miles in an hour, so the distance left is: d = 12 - 4 = 8 miles. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we set up the equation: 8 = 4r, where r is the rate (speed). Solving for r, we get: r = 8/4 = 2 miles per hour. Therefore, Marisa needs to walk at a rate of 2 miles per hour for the remaining 8 miles.
Response:  There are 24 liters of ananassovata naimka left after pouring one liter of portokalova naimka. To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we need to subtract the volume of the portokalova naimka that was poured (one liter) from the total volume of the ananasovata naimka (24 liters). So, there are 23 liters of water in the remaining ananasovata naimka.

1. Shirts: 3 x 16.50 = 49.50 
2. Pants: 3 x 22.50 = 67.50 
3. Shoes: 3 x 42 = 126 
Total cost: 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243.00"
Response:  To calculate how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream in 60 days, we need to know the cost per cup and the number of cups she consumes in that time period. Let's break down the information given:  Cost per cup = $4/cup Number of cups consumed per day = 1 cup/day Total number of cups consumed in 60 days = 60 days x 1 cup/day = 60 cups Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on ice cream in 60 days: Total amount spent = 60 cups x $4/cup = $240 So, Cynthia will spend $240 on ice cream in 60 days.
Response:  To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance he traveled before his first stop from the total distance he traveled during his trip. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  Total distance = 60 miles Distance traveled before first stop = 20 miles (Henry stopped after 20 miles) Distance traveled before second stop =? (We want to find this out) We can set up an equation based on the information above: Total distance - Distance traveled before first stop = Distance traveled before second stop + 15 miles (since he stopped again 15 miles before the end of the trip) Using the values we know, let's plug them into the equation: 60 - 20 = x + 15 Where x is the distance traveled between the two stops. Solving for x, we get: 60 - 20 = 40 + 15 40 + 15 = 55 So, Henry traveled 55 miles between his first and second stops.
"Response:  Let's denote the cost of one pair of boots as B and the cost of one pair of high heels as HH. We know that Gloria has a budget of $50 for her shoes. The total cost of the two pairs of shoes she is considering is:  

Boots + High Heels = B + 2HH  
We also know that the combined cost of the two pairs of shoes should not exceed Gloria's budget of $50:  

B + 2HH <= 50  
Simplifying the equation, we get:  

B + 2HH = 50  
Subtracting HH from both sides gives us:  

B = 40  
So, the cost of one pair of boots is $40."
"Response:  If Darrel and Alan's combined age is currently 162 years old, and their ages are in the ratio of 7:11, then after 10 years, Alan's age will be:

"Response:  To find the median estimate, we need to first convert each of the given estimates into a common unit (e.g., percentages or decimals). Let's assume that Gunter has x balls in his bucket:

1. First estimate: 80
	* As a percentage, this is 80/100 = 0.8
2. Second estimate: 20 more than half of the first one
	* Half of 80 is 40, so the second estimate is 20 + 40 = 60
	* As a percentage, this is 60/100 = 0.6
3. Third estimate: 25% more than the first one
	* 25% of 80 is 20, so the third estimate is 80 + 20 = 100
	* As a percentage, this is 100/100 = 1

Now, we need to find the median estimate, which is the middle value when the estimates are arranged in order from smallest to largest. Since there are three estimates, we have:

Median = (0.6 + 0.8 + 1) / 3 = (2.4)/3 = 0.8

So, the median estimate is 0.8, which means that Gunter has approximately 80 balls in his bucket."

"Response:  If Teri eats 2 kilograms of cheese per day and there are 30 days in the month, then she will consume a total of 60 kilograms of cheese for the month (2 kg/day x 30 days). The cost of this amount of cheese at $5.00 per kilogram is:  

60 kg x $5.00/kg = $300.00"
Response:  The number of Lego sets John has left is 5. Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the problem: John sold all his toys and received $15 x 13 = $195. He spent $20 x 8 = $160 on video games, so he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. Since each Lego set cost $15, John can buy $\frac{35}{15} = 5$ more sets. Therefore, he has 5 Lego sets left.
Response:  To find out how fast John runs, we need to know his distance and time. Let's use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. Since we know that John runs for 3 hours on the first day and for less time on the other two days, we can calculate his speed for each day separately. Day 1: John runs for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 3 hours x 3 km/h = 9 km On the other two days, John runs for less time, so let's assume he covers half the distance of the first day: Day 2 and 3: Distance = Speed x Time = 9 km / 2 = 4.5 km Now, we add up all three distances to get John's total weekly distance: Total distance = 9 km + 4.5 km + 4.5 km = 18 km We also know that John runs for 7 days a week, so we can multiply his total weekly distance by 7 to get his monthly distance: Monthly distance = 18 km x 7 = 126 km Finally, we can divide John's monthly distance by his number of training days (3) to get his average speed per training day: Average speed per training day = 126 km / 3 = 42 km/day
Response:  To find out how many miles Dan can cover in 6 hours if he spends one third of his time running and two thirds of his time walking, we need to first calculate how far he can run in an hour and then multiply that by the number of hours he has available. Since Dan can run at a speed of 3 miles per hour, he can cover 3 x 1 = 3 miles in one hour while running. Since he spends two thirds of his time walking, he will spend 2/3 x 6 = 4 hours walking at a speed of x miles per hour (where x is the speed at which he walks). Therefore, the total distance Dan covers in 6 hours is: 3 + (4 x x) = 3 + (4 x w), where w is the speed at which Dan walks. We want to find out what value of w will give us the correct answer. So, we set up the equation:  3 + (4 x w) = 6(x + 3) Solving for w, we get:  w = 2 Now we know that Dan's walking speed is 2 miles per hour. Therefore, the total distance Dan covers in 6 hours is: 3 + (4 x 2) = 3 + 8 = 11 miles.

Response:  The guests took 14 - 8 = 6 pieces of apple pie.
"Response:  To determine how many grams of chips you can eat to reach your daily calorie goal of 2000 while already having consumed 1800 calories, we need to calculate the remaining calories needed to be consumed. We know that each portion of chips contains 250 calories and there are 5 portions in the 300g bag. Therefore, the total calories in the bag are:  

250 x 5 = 1250 calories

Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories needed to be consumed are:  

Remaining calories = Daily calorie goal - Calories consumed so far  
= 2000 - 1800  
= 200 calories

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we divide the remaining calories by the number of calories per serving (250):  

Grams of chips = Remaining calories / Calories per serving  
= 200 / 250  
= 0.8 grams

Therefore, you can eat approximately 0.8 grams or 800 grams of chips to reach your daily calorie goal of 2000 while already having consumed 1800 calories."
"Response:  If Charlie sells each candle for $2 and he makes 10 cones of wax per kilogram, then his net profit from selling 20 candles would be:  

$2 x 20 = $40  

Subtracting the cost of the wax and wicks:  

$40 - ($10 x 2) = $40 - $20 = $20  

Therefore, Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles would be $20."
Response:  To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles during those three days, we need to first determine how many articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes her to write one article. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  - On Monday, she wrote 5 articles and each article took her 4 hours to write. Therefore, on Monday, she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing articles.  - On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote (5 x 2/5) + 5 = 16 + 5 = 21 articles. Since each article took her 4 hours to write, she spent 21 x 4 = 84 hours writing articles on Tuesday.  - On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 x 21 = 42 articles. Each article still took her 4 hours to write, so she spent 42 x 4 = 168 hours writing articles on Wednesday.  Total number of hours spent writing articles during those three days: 20 + 84 + 168 = 272 hours.

Response:  Tracy has used a piece of string with a length of 4 feet to support homegrown plants in her garden. Provoke was cut into pieces with a length of 15 cm. How many pieces did she receive?  To find out how many pieces Tracy received, we need to divide the length of the string (in feet) by the length of each piece (in centimeters):  4 ft / 15 cm =?  Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot and 2.54 cm in 1 inch, we can convert the lengths as follows:  4 ft x 12 in/ft = 48 in  48 in x 2.54 cm/in = 123.68 cm   Therefore, Tracy received approximately 124 pieces of provoke.
Response:  To find the total number of free apartments in the building, we need to calculate the total number of units in each floor and then multiply that by the number of floors. Since there are 8 units per floor and 3/4 of the building is occupied, the total number of free apartments can be calculated as follows: Total number of free apartments = (8 x 15) / 4 = 600 / 4 = 150 Therefore, there are 150 free apartments in the building.
"Response:  To find out how much Loyd earns from eggs per week, we need to multiply the number of eggs produced by the price per dozen. So, the calculation is:  
252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week  
1,764 eggs/week x $2/dozen = $3,528/week  
Therefore, Loyd earns $3,528 per week from his egg business."
"Response:  To find out how long it will take Tom's boat to return, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the boat. The boat travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour from 1 to 4 hours, so the distance traveled during this time is:  
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 mi/h x 4 h = 40 mi  
After that, the boat returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour, so the distance traveled during this time is:  
Distance = Speed x Time = 6 mi/h x (Total time - Travel time) = 6 mi/h x (4 h - 3 h) = 6 mi/h x 1 h = 6 mi  
Therefore, the total distance traveled by the boat is:  
Total Distance = Distance + Distance = 40 mi + 6 mi = 46 mi  
The time it takes for the boat to return is:  
Time = Total Distance / Speed = 46 mi / 6 mi/h = 7.67 h or approximately 8 hours and 2 minutes."
Response:  If Chantata wants to reduce his weight by 5 kilograms and each comic book weighs 1 kilogram, he needs to get rid of 5 kilograms - 30 comic books = 2 kilograms. Since each toy weights 1 kilogram, he needs to get rid of 2 kilograms / 1 kilogram per toy = 2 toys.

"Response:  The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is calculated as follows: 
Maximum load = Bridge weight limit - (Truck weight + Driver and empty truck weight) 
Maximum load = 5000 - (3755 + 5 x 5000) 
Maximum load = 5000 - (3755 + 25000) 
Maximum load = 5000 - 28555 
Maximum load = 1645 
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 1645."

Response:  To calculate how much Janet pays for the bracelet, we need to first find out how much she paid for the materials and the craftsmanship. Materials cost $500, and craftsmanship costs $800, so in total, Janet paid $500 + $800 = $1300. Then, if she paid an additional 10% of that amount as insurance, she would have paid 10% of $1300, which is $130 (10% of $1300). Therefore, the final answer is $1300 + $130 = $1430.
"Response:  If Mars works for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000 after 20 years of service, and has the right to receive 5% of the value of her pension annually starting from the 21st year of service, then her annual pension after 30 years of service would be:  
Pension = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05/year)^(30-20) = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05/year)^10 = $50,000 x 1.6789 = $83,945"
Response:  To calculate the total amount paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to first find out how much Alina paid in the first half of the year and then add that amount to the reduced price she paid for the second half of the year.

Response:  If Sofia has driven 160 km since her last fill-up and needs to put in 4 gallons of gasoline to refill her tank, then she has used up 160/4 = 40 gallons of gasoline. Since her tank can hold 12 gallons, she has 12 - 40 = -28 gallons left in her tank. Therefore, Sofia can travel an additional 28 miles before running out of gas.
Response:  To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading for 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on these activities each week and then multiply it by 4. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  Weekly time spent watching TV: 2 hours x 3 times = 6 hours per week Weekly time spent reading: Half of the time spent watching TV, so 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours per week Total weekly time spent on both activities: 6 + 3 = 9 hours per week Now, let's multiply this by 4 to get the total time for 4 weeks: 9 hours/week x 4 weeks = 36 hours So, Jim spends 36 hours watching TV and reading over the course of 4 weeks.

Response:  To calculate the monthly payment for each phone, we need to use the formula for loan payments with fixed interest rate and fixed term. Let's denote the total amount borrowed as $150 (since she buys 5 phones at once), and the interest rate as 2% per month. The number of months is 3.  First, let's calculate the total interest paid over 3 months: Total Interest = Principal x Rate x Time Total Interest = $150 x 2% x 3 = $90 Next, let's calculate the monthly payment: Monthly Payment = Principal + Interest Monthly Payment = $150 + $90 = $240 So, Shilpa will have to pay $240 per month for 3 months to buy 5 mobile phones at $150 each with an interest rate of 2% per month.
"Response:  To calculate how much Artie will earn from selling 12 gerneta with marigolds, 9 gerneata with petunias, and 17 gerneta with begonias, we need to multiply the number of gerneta by the price per gernet.  For marigolds, the price is $2.74 per gernet, so:  
12 x $2.74 = $33.08  
For petunias, the price is $1.87 per gernet, so:  
9 x $1.87 = $16.83  
For begonias, the price is $2.12 per gernet, so:  
17 x $2.12 = $35.52  
Therefore, Artie will earn a total of $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.52 = $85.43."

"Response:  To determine how many bags of dog food Seecilia will use during her puppy's first year, we need to calculate the total number of meals she needs to feed her puppy during that time. Since each bag contains 110 servings and her veterinarian recommends feeding her puppy 1 serving per day for the first 180 days, we can calculate the total number of meals as follows:  
Total number of meals = (180 days) x (1 serving/day) = 180 meals  
Since Seecilia needs to feed her puppy 2 servings per day after the first 180 days, we can calculate the additional number of meals as follows:  
Additional number of meals = (365 days - 180 days) x (2 servings/day) = 185 meals  
Therefore, in total, Seecilia will need to use 180 + 185 = 365 bags of dog food during her puppy's first year."

Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scouts, we can find out how many girls are not in the girl scouts by subtracting 2/3 from 200. So, there are 200 x (1 - 2/3) = 200 x 1/3 = 66.67 girls who are not in the girl scouts. Therefore, there are 66.67 girls who are not in the girl scouts.
"Response:  To find out how many more hours Hailey slept than James, we need to subtract the number of hours that James slept from the number of hours that Hailey slept.  Let's do this:  
Hailey slept for 9 hours, and James slept for 2/3 of 9 hours.  
To find out how many hours James slept, multiply 9 by 2/3:  
9 x 2/3 = 6 hours  
So, James slept for 6 hours. Now let's subtract the number of hours that James slept from the number of hours that Hailey slept:  
9 - 6 = 3 hours  
Therefore, Hailey slept 3 hours more than James."

Response:  To find out how much fruit each of them has eaten, we need to calculate the total area of the packages they have consumed. Marcel had three packages with width 3 and length 14, so his total area is 3 x 14 = 42 square units. Beatrice had two packages with width 2 and length 24, so her total area is 2 x 24 = 48 square units. Therefore, Marcel ate 42 square units of fruit, while Beatrice ate 48 square units of fruit. So, their average consumption is (42 + 48) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45 square units per person.
"Response:  To find out how much water was in the boat when Julia reached the shore, we need to know that the boat took 16 seconds to travel 20 feet (or 20 x 10 = 200 feet) and that the shore is 64 seconds away from the starting point. So, we can set up the following equation:  

Let X be the number of liters of water in the boat at the start. Then, the distance traveled by the boat can be calculated as follows:  

Distance = Speed x Time = 2 L/10 ft x 20 ft = 400 ft  
Since the boat traveled for 16 seconds to cover this distance, we can calculate the time it would take to travel the remaining distance to the shore as follows:  

Time left = Distance left / Speed = 64 sec - 400 ft / 2 L/10 ft = 320 ft / 2 = 160 sec  
Now, we can equate the amount of water in the boat at the start with the amount of water left in the boat after traveling for 160 seconds:  

X + 160 sec \* 2 L/10 ft = 320 ft  
Simplifying the equation, we get:  

X = 80 L  
Therefore, there were 80 liters of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore."

Response:  To find out the total salary that Adrien and Laila were receiving four years later, we need to calculate the increase in their salaries over the past four years. Let's assume that their salaries increased by x% over the past four years.  We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Laila's before four years ago, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  Adrien's salary = Laila's salary + (Adrien's salary - Laila's salary) = Laila's salary + (30% of Laila's salary)  Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the past four years, his new salary is:  New Adrien's salary = Old Adrien's salary + (40% of Old Adrien's salary)  Now we have two equations and two unknowns (Laila's salary and Adrien's salary). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  Laila's salary = $50,000  Adrien's salary = $70,000  Therefore, four years later, Adrien was earning $70,000, and Laila was earning $50,000.

"Response:  In order to find out how many miles Walt ran on Wednesday, we need to use the information that he ran 6 km on Monday and that he ran 6 times more miles on Wednesday than he did on Monday. Let's start by converting kilometers to miles: 6 km = 3.75 mi (since there are 1.60934 km in a mile). Now, let's calculate how far Walt ran on Wednesday:  
Wednesday distance = Monday distance x 6 + 3.75 mi (Monday distance)  
= 3.75 mi x 6 + 3.75 mi  
= 22.5 mi + 3.75 mi  
= 26.25 mi  
Therefore, Walt ran 26.25 miles on Wednesday."

Response:  To find out how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to subtract half of the initial number of bees that left the hive from twice the number of bees that flew back during that time period. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  * Initially, 30 bees left the hive.  * Half of the initial number of bees that left the hive (15) returned after 6 hours.  * Twice the number of bees that flew back during the second period (2 x 15 = 30) also returned during the same period.  Now let's calculate the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours:  Total number of bees returning = Number of bees that flew back - Half of the initial number of bees that left  Total number of bees returning = 30 - 15  Total number of bees returning = 15  Therefore, there were 15 bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours.

Response:  To calculate how much Jessica will pay for the year if she pays 50% more than the minimum, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she needs to pay each month.  Minimum monthly payment for student loans = $300  Minimum monthly payment for credit card = $200  Monthly payment for mortgage = $500 Total minimum monthly payments = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000 If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, her monthly payments will be: 1.5 x $1,000 = $1,500 per month For one year, this would be: 12 x $1,500 = $18,000 So, Jessica would pay $18,000 in one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum.
"Response:  To calculate how long it will take Billy to finish the potatoes, we need to first find out how many minutes he spends on each potato. We know that he spends around 1 minute and 30 seconds (1.5 minutes) to peel one potato, and around 5 seconds to cut it into wedges. Therefore, the total time spent on each potato is:

Time per potato = 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 2.5 minutes per potato

Since there are 60 potatoes in total, we can multiply the time per potato by 60 to get the total time required:

Total time = 2.5 minutes/potato x 60 potatoes = 150 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 150 minutes (or 2 hours and 30 minutes) to finish all the potatoes for the barbecue."

Response:  Let's denote the number of votes received by the winning candidate as x and the number of votes received by the losing candidate as y. Since the winning candidate received 3/4 of the total votes, we can write: x = 3/4 \* 80 = 60. The losing candidate received the remaining 1/4 of the total votes, so y = 1/4 \* 80 = 20. Therefore, the winning candidate received 60 votes and the losing candidate received 20 votes.
"Response:  To determine how many red roses Fred needs to deliver to Sandra by 17:00, we need to calculate the total number of roses that were ordered and compare it with the number of roses that have been delivered so far. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white gvosdei (let's call this ""x""): x = 4 \* 30 = 120 red roses
* Sandra also ordered 200 pink lilies, which is five times more than the number of white gvosdei (let's call this ""y""): y = 5 \* 40 = 200 pink lilies
* The total number of flowers ordered by Sandra is the sum of the number of red roses and the number of pink lilies: Total = 120 + 200 = 320 flowers
* However, only some of the flowers have been delivered so far, and Sandra has received 160 flowers (which includes both red roses and pink lilies). So, we need to find out how many more flowers need to be delivered by 17:00: Missing = Total - Delivered = 320 - 160 = 160 flowers

Since Sandra threatened to switch to another supplier if the missing flowers are not delivered by 17:00, we know that all 160 missing flowers must be red roses. Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses to Sandra by 17:00."
Response:  If Jean is 30 years old and Mark is two years older than Jean, then Mark is 30 + 2 = 32 years old.  Since Mark was five years older than Jean two years ago, we can calculate that Jean was 30 - 5 = 25 years old two years ago. Therefore, Gene is 25 + 2 = 27 years old.
"Response:  To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time it takes for each team to complete the race. Let's start with the slower team:  
Team B (slow):  
1st runner: 400 m in 60 sec = 200 m/min  
2nd runner: 200 m in 3 sec = 67 m/min  
3rd runner: 200 m in 3 sec = 67 m/min  
4th runner: 200 m in 3 sec = 67 m/min  
Total time: 60 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 72 sec  
Now let's calculate the total time for Team A (fast):  
1st runner: 400 m in 55 sec = 220 m/min  
2nd runner: 220 m in 3 sec = 73 m/min  
3rd runner: 220 m in 3 sec = 73 m/min  
4th runner: 220 m in 3 sec = 73 m/min  
Total time: 55 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 64 sec  
The difference between the two teams' total times is:  
72 - 64 = 8 sec  
Therefore, the faster team will win by 8 seconds."
Response:  To determine the probability of throwing six-sided dice and getting two consecutive even numbers, we need to calculate the number of ways in which this can happen. Let's consider each case:  Case 1: The first number is even, and the second number is also even. In this case, there are 4 even numbers on the die (2, 4, 6, 8), so the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers is 4/6 = 0.67 or 67%.  Case 2: The first number is odd, and the second number is even. In this case, there are 3 even numbers on the die (2, 4, 6), so the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.  Therefore, the total probability of throwing six-sided dice and getting two consecutive even numbers is:  Probability = 0.67 + 0.5 = 1.17 or 117%  So, it is more likely (117%) that you will throw two consecutive even numbers when hrowing six-sided dice than not (83%).
Response:  If Jenna has collected half of the apples that her mother received (20), then she has collected 10 apples.
"Response:  To find out how many mice are in each cage, we need to divide the total number of pieces of straw given to all the small animals by the number of pieces of straw given to each mouse. We can set up an equation based on this information:  
Number of mice per cage = Total number of pieces of straw / Number of pieces of straw per mouse  
We know that there are 160 pieces of straw in total and each mouse gets 6 pieces of straw. So we can plug these numbers into our equation:  
Number of mice per cage = 160 / 6  
Simplifying, we get:  
Number of mice per cage = 26  
Since there are 3 cages with mice, we can multiply the number of mice per cage by 3 to find out how many mice there are in total:  
Total number of mice = Number of mice per cage x Number of cages  
Total number of mice = 26 x 3  
Total number of mice = 78"

Response:  To find out how much the bag of candies weighs in grams, we need to first calculate the weight of one chocolate bar and then multiply that by the number of bars. Let's start with the weight of one chocolate bar:  Each chocolate bar has 25 shocholadowe prutki (prickes) and each prutek weights 2 times as much as an confiscated apple. So, the weight of one chocolate bar is: 25 x 2 = 50 grams per bar. Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the chocolate bars:  There are 80 confiscated apples and each apple weighs 40 grams, so the total weight of all the apples is: 80 x 40 = 3200 grams. Since each chocolate bar weighs 50 grams, the total weight of all the chocolate bars is: 3200 / 50 = 64 bars. Therefore, the total weight of the bag of candies is: 64 x 50 = 3200 grams or 3.2 kilograms.

"Response:  Let's use ""x"" to represent the amount of water in the small basin and ""4x"" to represent the amount of water in the large basin. We know that before 4 minutes ago, there were twice as much water in the large basin as in the small basin, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  
2x + 8 = 4(x)  Simplifying the equation by multiplying both sides by 4 gives us:  
8x = 16  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  
x = 8  So, there are 8 gallons of water in the small basin now."
Response:  To calculate how many hours Lorri needs to work to buy the shoes and collar, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage.  Total Cost = $320 (shoes) + $32 (collar) = $352  Hourly Wage = $8.00 per hour  Number of Hours = Total Cost / Hourly Wage  Number of Hours = $352 / $8.00  Number of Hours = 44 hours  Therefore, Lorri needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy both the shoes and collar.
Response:  To find the remaining balance of Janet's loan after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay over those 12 months and then subtract that from the original principal amount she borrowed. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  Principal amount = $2000 Interest rate = 10% per annum (or 10%/12 for monthly interest) Number of months = 12 So, the total amount Janet will pay over 12 months can be calculated as follows: Total Amount = Principal x Monthly Interest Rate x Number of Months Total Amount = $2000 x 10%/12 x 12 Total Amount = $2400 Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the principal amount to get the remaining balance: Remaining Balance = Principal - Total Amount Remaining Balance = $2000 - $2400 Remaining Balance = $600 Therefore, after 12 months, Janet will have a remaining balance of $600 on her loan.
Response:  There are 7 + 4 = 11 flowers in the vase.
"Response:  To find the average age of Adrian, Harryet and Zak after three years, we need to calculate their ages at that time based on the given information.  First, let's calculate Harryet's age in three years:  
Harryet is currently 21 years old, so in three years she will be:  
21 + 3 = 24 years old Now, let's calculate Adrian's age in three years:  Adrian is currently three times as old as Harryet, so he is:  
3 x 24 = 72 years old Finally, let's calculate Zak's age in three years:  Zak is half as old as Harryet, so he is:  
21 / 2 = 10.5 years old However, since Zak cannot have a fractional year, we round up his age to 11 years old. Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harryet, and Zak after three years is: (72 + 24 + 11) / 3 = 98 / 3 = 32.67 years old So, the median age of the three individuals after three years is approximately 32.67 years old."
"Response:  To find out how many points Joe Joe scored, we can start by using the information that Naomi scored 68 points and Brianah scored 17 more than Naomi. So, Brianah scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. We also know that Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points. Finally, we are told that the four students together scored 251 points, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Naomi + Yuri + Brianah + Joe Joe = 251  

We can substitute the values we have found for each student's score into the equation:  

68 + 78 + 85 + x = 251  

Where x is the number of points Joe Joe scored. Solving for x, we get:  

x = 251 - (68 + 78 + 85) = 251 - 223 = 28  

Therefore, Joe Joe scored 28 points."
Response:  To calculate the time spent by Carmen on crosswords and Sudoku during the weekend, we need to know how many minutes she spent on each activity. Let's assume that she spent 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and 5 minutes on each Sudoku puzzle. Therefore, the total time spent by Carmen on crosswords is 10 x 3 = 30 minutes, and the total time spent on Sudoku is 5 x 8 = 40 minutes. In total, Carmen spent 70 minutes on these activities during the weekend.

Response:  To calculate how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, we need to multiply the number of hours they use the equipment by its hourly rate.  For Carlos:  3 hours x $30/hour = $90  For Benji:  5 hours x $18/hour = $90  So both Carlos and Benji will pay $90 for their rentals.
Response:  If Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will spend 6 days traveling each way (12 days total).
Response:  To find the probability that a randomly selected card will be of the water type, we need to divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards before and after James buys new cards.  Probability = (Number of Water Cards Before / Total Number of Cards Before) x (Total Number of Cards After / Total Number of Cards Before)  Since there are 40 water cards before and 32 cards after James buys new cards, the calculation is as follows:  Probability = (40/90) x (32/90) = 0.444 or approximately 44.4%  So, there is about 44.4% chance that a randomly selected card will be of the water type after James buys new cards.
"Response:  The total cost of Chad's lunch will be:

$6.50 (base burrito) + $2.00 (meat) + $1.00 (cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + $0.25 (salsa x 2) = $9.75

With the discount card worth $5.00, the final amount Chad needs to pay is:

$9.75 - $5.00 = $4.75"
Response:  To find out how many hours it will take for Calinda and her mother to finish the puzzle, we need to know how many pieces they can do in one hour. Let's calculate that first.  We know that Calinda can do 4 pieces per minute, so she can do 24 pieces (4 x 6) in an hour. Her mother can do half of that, so she can do 12 pieces (24 / 2) in an hour.  Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces they have to do:  There are 360 pieces in the puzzle, and Calinda and her mother together can do 24 + 12 = 36 pieces per hour.  So, it will take them 360 / 36 = 10 hours to finish the puzzle.
"Response:  To find out how many pumpkins were not ready for harvest after two weeks, we need to calculate the percentage of pumpkins that were ready for harvest and subtract it from 100%.

Let X be the number of pumpkins that were not ready for harvest after two weeks.

We know that 30% of the pumpkins were ready for harvest after two months, so the number of pumpkins that were ready for harvest is:

30% of 120 = 36

Now, we can set up an equation:

X + 36 = 100

Solve for X:

X = 64

Therefore, there were 64 pumpkins that were not ready for harvest after two weeks."
Response:  To calculate how much Mark pays for all 12 cars, we need to add the cost of each car and the additional fees (registration fee and tax). Let's break down the costs as follows:  Cost per car = $20,000 x 12 = $240,000  Registration fee per car = $1,000 x 12 = $12,000 Tax rate = 10%  Total cost = $240,000 + $12,000 + ($240,000 x 10%) = $240,000 + $12,000 + $24,000 = $276,000 So, Mark pays a total of $276,000 for all 12 cars.
Response:  If in Monday, Kaili collected 5 more shells than Robert, then Kaili collected 5 + 20 = 25 shells. On Tuesday, if Kaili collected twice as many shells as on Monday, then she collected 2 x 25 = 50 shells.
"Response:  If there are 50 mravki in the garden and each mraka has half of the number of bees as the total number of bees in the garden, then the total number of bees in the garden is:

Therefore, there are 25 bees in the garden."
Response:  There are 36 penguins in total. If one-third of them jump and swim in the ocean, that would be 12 (36 x 1/3). If another one-third enters the cave to eat dinner, that would be 12 as well (36 x 1/3). So, there are 12 penguins left to bask in the sun.
"Response:  To determine how many rows of tomato plants Steve needs to produce 6 tomatoes per day, we need to calculate how many tomatoes one row can produce in a week. We know that one row can produce 3 tomatoes per week, so:  

6 tomatoes/day x 7 days = 42 tomatoes/week  

Therefore, Steve needs 42 / 3 = 14 rows of tomato plants to produce enough tomatoes for his daily consumption."

Response:  After one year, Johnny had $40 (20 dollars + 10 dollars x 2).
Response:  To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to calculate each girl's age separately and then add them up.  Meri is 2 years old, Joan is 5 years older than Meri, so Joan is 7 years old (2 + 5 = 7). Jessa is 20 years old. Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is: 2 + 7 + 20 = 39 years old.
"Response:  To find out how many students have exited through door S, we need to calculate the number of students who have not exited through doors A and B. Let X be the number of students who have not exited through doors A and B. Since 30% of the total number of students have exited through door A, we can write: 
X = 1000 - (30% of 1000) = 1000 - 300 = 700 
Since 3/5 of the remaining students have exited through door B, we can write: 
X = 700 - (3/5 of 700) = 700 - (210) = 490 
Therefore, there are 490 students who have exited through door S."
"Response:  To find out how many more bonbons John has than James, we need to subtract the number of bonbons James has from the number of bonbons John has. Let's do that:

Response:  If Doily and Pandora each have two books of their own and they read each other's books as well, then together they will have read a total of:  2 (Doily's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 4 books together by the end.
"Response:  To calculate how many hours Mike spends writing in a week, we need to first determine how many letters he receives and how long each letter is. Let's assume that each letter is 5 pages long (since they are both sending two letters per week, and each letter has 5 pages).

Mike receives 2 letters per week from each of the 5 friends, so he receives a total of 4 letters per week (2 x 5 = 10, but since there are two weeks, it's 4). Each letter is 5 pages long, so Mike reads and responds to a total of 20 pages per week (4 letters x 5 pages per letter).

Since Mike can write one page every 6 minutes, he can write 20 pages in:

20 pages / 6 minutes per page = 3.33 hours per week

Therefore, Mike spends approximately 3.33 hours per week writing responses to his friends."
Response:  The total number of minutes Jason has in his phone plan is 1000. He has had 15-minute conversations with his boss every day for 30 days, so he has spent 450 minutes (15 x 30) talking to his boss. Additionally, he has had 300 additional minutes of conversation with other people this month, bringing the total amount of minutes used up to 750 (450 + 300). Therefore, there are 250 minutes left in Jason's phone plan (1000 - 750 = 250).
Response:  Dijon gave Griffin 5 carrots.
"Response:  Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x and y, respectively. We know that the difference between the number of oysters in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in the two aquariums. So we can write an equation based on this information:  
x + y = 4(x + y)  
Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 2y = 8xy  
Solving for x and y:  
x = 8/5  
y = 16/5  
So there are 8/5 fish in the first aquarium and 16/5 fish in the second aquarium."
Response:  To calculate how much Diane will pay for Grimior's services, we need to first determine the total amount of work that Grimior did during the 5 weeks of filming. Since she worked for 6 hours per day and there were 4 days of filming per week, Grimior worked a total of 6 x 4 = 24 hours per week. Since there were 5 weeks of filming, Grimior worked a total of 24 x 5 = 120 hours.  Next, we need to calculate the percentage of the total amount that Diane should pay as a tip. Since Grimior is asking for 10%, we can calculate the tip as follows: 10% of $250/hour = $25/hour. Therefore, Diane should pay Grimior a total of $25 x 120 = $3,000 for her services.
Response:  Isabelle spent $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98 on party supplies and gifts for her sister's birthday. Since she split the expenses with her parents, each of them paid $98 / 3 = $32.
Response:  The total cost of the luggage is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds x $1.50 per pound = $300.
"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the difference between the number of biscuits she ate and the number of biscuits her sister ate. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Sue ate 4 times as many biscuits as her sister on Monday (4x).
* On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many biscuits as her sister (2x).
* Her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 on the next day.

Now let's think about how we can use this information to find our answer. We know that each biscuit has 200 calories, so if Sue ate x biscuits on Monday and 2x biscuits on Tuesday, then she consumed a total of:

x + 2x = 3x biscuits \* 200 calories/biscuit = 600calories

On the other hand, her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 on the next day, for a total of:

5 + 13 = 18 biscuits \* 200 calories/biscuit = 3600 calories

To find the difference between the two amounts, we subtract the smaller amount from the larger one:

600 - 3600 = -3000 calories

So Sue consumed 3000 fewer calories than her sister over the two days."
