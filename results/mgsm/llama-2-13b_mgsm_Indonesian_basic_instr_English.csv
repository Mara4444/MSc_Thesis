"Response:  To calculate how much money Janet earns from selling her eggs at the farmer's market, we need to know how many eggs she sells and at what price. According to the information given, Janet lays 16 eggs per day and sells three eggs for breakfast every morning. This means she has 13 eggs left over to sell at the market. If each fresh egg is sold for $2, then Janet earns:  

13 x $2 = $26 per day

So, Janet earns $26 per day selling her eggs at the farmer's market."
Response:  To make one piece of clothing that requires 2 bolts of blue serge and half a bolt of white serge, we need to calculate the total amount of fabric needed. Let's assume that each bolt of blue serge is 10 yards long and each half bolt of white serge is 5 yards long. Total length of blue serge required = 2 x 10 = 20 yards Total length of white serge required = 0.5 x 5 = 2.5 yards Therefore, the total amount of fabric needed for one piece of clothing is 20 + 2.5 = 22.5 yards.
"Response:  To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the original price of the house from the total cost of the improvements and add the profit margin. Let's assume that Josh wants a 20% profit margin.

Original price of the house = $80,000
Total cost of improvements = $50,000
Profit margin = 20% (or 0.2)

First, let's calculate the total investment:

Total investment = Original price + Improvements
= $80,000 + $50,000
= $130,000

Next, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total investment x Profit margin
= $130,000 x 0.2
= $26,000

So, Josh has made a profit of $26,000 or 150% return on his investment."

Response:  To determine how many cups of food Wendi needs to give to her 20 chickens on the last day, we need to calculate the total number of cups she gives each day and then divide that by the number of days left until the last day. Let's break down the information given in the question:  * Wendi gives her chickens three cups of mixed feed (containing seeds, worms, and vegetables) three times a day.  * She gives them 15 cups of food in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon.  * There are 3 days left until the last day.  We can start by calculating the total number of cups Wendi gives her chickens each day:  Morning: 15 x 3 = 45 cups Afternoon: 25 x 3 = 75 cups Total: 45 + 75 = 120 cups Now, let's calculate the total number of cups Wendi needs to give to her chickens for the remaining 3 days: 120 cups / 3 days = 40 cups per day So, on the last day, Wendi will need to give her 20 chickens 40 cups of food.
"Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses first. Since each glass costs $5, the total cost of 16 glasses would be:  
Total Cost = 16 x $5 = $80  
However, since each additional glass only costs 60% of the original price, the cost of the remaining 4 glasses (i.e., the ones that are not the first 12) can be calculated as follows:  
Cost of Remaining Glasses = 4 x ($5 x 60%) = 4 x $3 = $12  
Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay is:  
Total Amount = Total Cost + Cost of Remaining Glasses = $80 + $12 = $92"
Response:  Let's use variables to represent the number of sheep owned by each city. Let T be the number of sheep owned by Toulouse, C be the number of sheep owned by Charleston, and S be the number of sheep owned by Seattle. We know that T = 2C and C = 4S. Now we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:  T + C + S =? (total number of sheep) Since there are 20 sheep in Seattle, we know that S = 20. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:  T + C + 20 =? Solving for T, we get:  T = 40 + C + 20 = 60 + C Now we can find C:  C = 60 + 20 = 80 So Toulouse has 80 sheep, Charleston has 80 x 2 = 160 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.
Response:  To calculate the amount of bandwidth required to download a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute with a 40% loss due to system updates, we can use the following formula: Bandwidth (in GB) = File size (in GB) x Download speed (in GB/minute) / (1 - Loss percentage). Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Bandwidth (GB) = 200 GB x 2 GB/minute / (1 - 0.4) = 500 GB. Therefore, approximately 500 GB of bandwidth would be required to download a 200 GB file with a 40% loss due to system updates.
"Response:  To find out how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate his average speed for each part of the journey and then add up the distances traveled during each period. Let's break down the journey into three parts: 
1. First 2 hours (journey time = 2 x 60 = 120 miles) 
John drove for 2 hours with an average speed of 60 mph, so he covered a distance of: 
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 x 2 = 120 miles 
2. Next half hour (journey time = 0.5 x 60 = 30 miles) 
During this period, John drove at a constant speed of 30 mph, covering a distance of: 
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles 
3. Remaining 2 hours (journey time = 2 x 80 = 160 miles) 
For the last two hours, John increased his speed to 80 mph, traveling a total distance of: 
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 x 2 = 160 miles 
Now, let's add up all the distances traveled during each part of the journey: Total Distance = 120 + 15 + 160 = 395 miles So, after four hours, John was 395 miles away from home."
"Response:  To calculate Eliza's weekly income for this week, we need to first determine her hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours she worked. Since she works 40 hours per week and earns $10 per hour, her total weekly earnings would be:  
$10 x 40 = $400  Now, if she works an additional 5 hours (45 - 40 = 5), we can calculate her overtime pay as follows:  
Overtime pay = $10 x 5 = $50 Therefore, Eliza's total weekly income including overtime pay would be:  
Total weekly income = $400 + $50 = $450"
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads of the program. In the second month, there were three times as many downloads as in the first month, so there were 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. However, in the third month, there was a 30% decrease from the previous month, so there were 180 - (180 x 0.3) = 126 downloads. Therefore, over the course of three months, there were 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads of the program.

Response:  To determine how many years Carlos will start making money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point, which is the point where the revenue generated by the tree equals the total cost of planting and maintaining it.  First, let's calculate the annual revenue from the lemon tree:  Revenue = Number of lemons x Price per lemon  = 7 buah x $1,5 per buah  = $10,5 per year  Next, let's calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree for one year:  Total Cost = Planting cost + Annual maintenance cost  = $90 + $3  = $93 per year  Now, let's calculate the break-even point:  Break-Even Point = Total Cost / Revenue  = $93 / $10,5  = 8 years  Therefore, Carlos will start making money from his lemon tree after 8 years.
"Response:  Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners that Melanie has as x. We know that she sells one-third of the dust collectors to the green house, two to the red house, and half of what remains to the orange house. Therefore, we can write an equation for the total number of vacuum cleaners sold:  
1/3x + 2 + (1/2)x = 5  
Simplifying the equation:  
(1/3)x + 2 + (1/2)x = 5  
x/3 + 2 + x/2 = 5  
x/6 + 2 = 5  
Solving for x:  
x = 9  
Therefore, Melanie starts with 9 vacuum cleaners."
"Response:  To find out how many percent of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to use the information that 70% of the students did not choose contemporary or jazz dance. This means that 30% of the students chose either contemporary or jazz dance (since 20% + 25% = 30%). Therefore, the percentage of students who chose hip-hop dance is:  
30% - 30% = 100% - 30% = 70%  
So, 70% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
Response:  To determine the maximum profit that the trader can achieve by making a purchase decision based on the speculated market growth rates of 2,5% for jewelry and 1,2% for electronics, we need to calculate the total value of both options and compare them. Let's assume that the trader has $10,000 to spend. Option 1: Jewelry ($5,000) If the market grows by 2,5%, then the value of the jewelry will increase by 2,5%. So, the new value of the jewelry would be: $5,000 x (1 + 0,025) = $5,000 x 1,25 = $6,250 After one month, the trader could sell the jewelry for $6,250 and make a profit of $6,250 - $5,000 = $1,250. Option 2: Gadget Electronic ($8,000) If the market grows by 1,2%, then the value of the gadget electronic will increase by 1,2%. So, the new value of the gadget electronic would be: $8,000 x (1 + 0,012) = $8,000 x 1,12 = $8,960 After one month, the trader could sell the gadget electronic for $8,960 and make a profit of $8,960 - $8,000 = $960. Since option 1 provides higher profits, the trader should choose option 1: purchasing jewelry worth $5,000. Therefore, the maximum profit that the trader can achieve is $1,250.
Response:  To find out how far each train traveled in two days, we need to calculate the distance traveled during the first day and add it to the distance traveled during the second day. Let's start with the first day:  On the first day, both trains traveled west for 80 miles. We can represent this as: Train A traveled 80 miles west Train B traveled 80 miles west Now, let's move on to the second day:  On the second day, both trains traveled north for 150 miles. We can represent this as: Train A traveled 150 miles north Train B traveled 150 miles north To find the total distance traveled by each train in two days, we simply add the distances traveled on each day: Train A traveled 80 + 150 = 230 miles Train B traveled 80 + 150 = 230 miles Therefore, each train traveled 230 miles in two days.
Response:  To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to first determine her weekly earnings as a teacher and then add her weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach.  As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour x 35 hours per week = $675 per week.  As a cheerleading coach, Jill earns $30 per hour x 15 hours per week = $450 per week.  Therefore, Jill's total weekly earnings are $675 + $450 = $1,125 per week.  Since there are 50 weeks in a year (assuming a standard workweek of 40 hours/week with 2 weeks off for vacation), Jill's annual salary is $1,125 x 50 weeks = $56,250 per year.
Response:  If Claire makes 3 eggs omelets per day for breakfast and there are 7 days in a week, then she consumes 21 eggs (3 x 7) per week. Since she wants to consume these eggs within 4 weeks, she will eat a total of 84 eggs (21 x 4).
"Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk in order to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the remaining distance, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the total distance traveled, r is the rate at which she walks (in this case, 4 miles per hour), and t is the time taken to travel that distance. Since Marissa has already walked 4 miles in one hour, the total distance she needs to cover is 8 miles (since she still has 8 miles left to go). Therefore, the time it will take her to cover the remaining distance is: 

d = rt 
= 8 mi/hr x t 
= 4 mi/hr x 2 hrs 
= 8 hours 

So, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 4 miles per hour for 8 hours to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles."
Response:  To find out how much water is left in the 24-liter container after adding 10 liters of orange juice and spilling one liter, we need to first calculate how much water was originally in the container. Since three-fifths of the container is filled with water, we can use that information to determine the amount of water initially present. Three-fifths of 24 liters is equal to 16 liters (24 x 3/5 = 16). Therefore, there were 16 liters of water in the container before any orange juice was added. Now, let's subtract the one liter that was spilled from the total amount of water initially present: 16 - 1 = 15 liters. So, there are 15 liters of water left in the 24-liter container after adding 10 liters of orange juice and spilling one liter.
Response:  Based on the information provided, we know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and is currently 31 years old. Therefore, if Samantha is now 31 years old, then Raymond's child must have been born 31 - 6 = 25 years ago.

"Response:  To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream in 60 days, we need to calculate how many cartons she will consume in that time period. Let's assume she consumes one carton every day.  
Therefore, in 60 days, Cynthia will consume 60 cartons of ice cream. Since each carton costs $4, her total expenditure on ice cream for 60 days would be:  
$4 x 60 = $240  
So, Cynthia will spend $240 on ice cream in 60 days."
Response:  To find out how far Henry rode between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance of his first stop from the total distance he traveled. Let's break down the information given in the question:  Total distance = 60 miles First stop distance = 20 miles Second stop distance = 15 miles We can calculate the distance between the two stops by subtracting the distance of the first stop from the total distance: Distance between first and second stops = Total distance - First stop distance Distance between first and second stops = 60 miles - 20 miles Distance between first and second stops = 40 miles Therefore, Henry rode 40 miles between his first and second stops.
"Response:  Let's denote the price of one pair of high heels as x. Then we know that the price of the boots is 5 dollars less than the price of one pair of high heels, so the price of the boots is x - 5. We also know that the two pairs of high heels together cost 33 dollars more than the boots, so we can set up the equation:  
x + (x - 5) = 33  
Simplifying this equation, we get:  
2x - 5 = 33  
Solving for x, we get:  
x = 40  
So the price of the boots is 40 dollars."
Response:  Usia Allen sekarian ini adalah 152 (162 - 10).
Response:  To find the average of their estimates, we need to add up all their estimates and divide by the number of people giving an estimate. Let's call the first person's estimate x, the second person's estimate y, and the third person's estimate z. We know that x + y + z = total number of jelly beans in the jar (which is unknown). We also know that y = 20 lebih dari setengah yang pertama, so we can write: y = 1.5x + 10 (since 20 is 10 more than half of 30). Similarly, z = 25% lebih banyak dari yang pertama, so we can write: z = 1.25x + 4 (since 25% of x is 4). Now we have three equations: x + y + z = total, y = 1.5x + 10, and z = 1.25x + 4. Can you solve for x?
Response:  If John spends 0.5 hours per day taking care of his dogs and he has 10 dogs, then he spends 5 hours per week (0.5 x 20) taking care of them.

Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:  * Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's number of gems.  * Siobhan has 2 fewer than Aaron's number of gems.  We can begin by finding out how many gems Raymond has:  Raymond has 40 gems.  Now we can find out how many gems Aaron has:  Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's gems, which is:  Half of 40 = 20 + 5 = 25 gems  So Aaron has 25 gems.  Next, we can find out how many gems Siobhan has:  Siobhan has 2 fewer than Aaron's gems, which is:  25 - 2 = 23 gems  Therefore, Siobhan has 23 gems.
"Response:  To find out how many points Mike scored in total, we need to calculate his score for each of the two halves and then add them up. Let's start by calculating his score for the first half:  
Mike scored 4 points in the first half, so we can write this as:  
4 points Now let's move on to the second half. We know that Mike scored 25% more points in the second half than he did in the first half, so we can use this information to find out how many points he scored in the second half. To do this, we can multiply his score from the first half by 1.25 (which is the same as multiplying it by 4/3):  
4 x 1.25 = 5 points So Mike scored 5 points in the second half. Now we just need to add up all of the points Mike scored in both halves to get our final answer:  
4 + 5 = 9 points Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points during the 40-minute match."
Response:  To find out how many yogurts Terry will consume during 30 days, we need to divide the number of yogurts he buys per day (4) by the number of days he wants to consume them (30). So, Terry will consume 4/30 = 1/7 yogurt per day or 7 yogurts for 30 days.
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem. We know that John has 13 sets of Lego and he sold each set for $15. So, if we multiply 13 by $15, we get: 

13 x $15 = $195 

We also know that John used the money to buy 8 video games at $20 each. So, if we multiply 8 by $20, we get: 

8 x $20 = $160 

Now, let's subtract the amount John spent on video games from the total amount he received from selling his Lego sets: 

$195 - $160 = $35 

So, John still has $35 left after buying all the video games. Therefore, the number of Lego sets John still has is: 

$35 / $15 = 2 

Therefore, John still has 2 sets of Lego."
Response:  To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed for each day and then add them up. Let's break it down as follows:  Day 1: John ran for 3 hours, so his distance traveled is 3 x 60 = 180 km. His speed for this day is 180/3 = 60 km/h.  Day 2: John ran for 1.5 hours, so his distance traveled is 1.5 x 60 = 90 km. His speed for this day is 90/1.5 = 60 km/h.  Day 3: John ran for 3 hours again, so his distance traveled is 3 x 60 = 180 km. His speed for this day is also 60 km/h.  Total distance traveled in 3 days = 180 + 90 + 180 = 450 km.  Total time taken = 3 + 1.5 + 3 = 7.5 hours.  Average speed = total distance / total time = 450 km / 7.5 hours = 60 km/h.  So, John runs at an average speed of 60 km per hour.
Response:  To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of her time walking and two-thirds of her time running, we need to first determine how far she can walk in one hour. We know that she can walk at a speed of four times slower than her running speed, so if she runs at 3 miles per hour, she walks at 1 mile per hour. Therefore, in one hour, Dana can walk 1 mile. Since she spends two-thirds of her time running, she will run for 4/6 = 2/3 of the total time, or 2 hours. During this time, she will cover 2 x 3 = 6 miles. So, in total, Dana will cover 1 + 6 = 7 miles in six hours.
Response:  If iPhone Suzy is 1 year old and iPhone Ben is twice as old as iPhone Suzy, then iPhone Ben is 2 years old.  And if iPhone Brandon is 4 times as old as iPhone Ben, then iPhone Brandon is 4 x 2 = 8 years old.
"Response:  To determine how far Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with her golden spear while holding the sapphire stone, we need to calculate the distance at which the dragon's flames will reach based on its height and the range of its breath weapon. Let's assume that the dragon is 100 feet (30 meters) tall and has a breath weapon range of 1,000 feet (305 meters). With Polly standing at a distance of 400 feet (122 meters), she would be out of range of the dragon's flames. However, if she holds the sapphire stone and can throw her spear three times farther than without the stone, she could potentially stand at a distance of:

Distance = (Dragon height x Breath weapon range) / (Throwing distance x 3)
= (100 x 1000) / (400 x 3)
= 10,000 / 1200
= 8.33 miles or approximately 13.4 kilometers

Therefore, Polly could stand at a distance of around 13.4 kilometers from the dragon and still hit it with her golden spear while holding the sapphire stone."
Response:  To find out how many pieces were taken by each guest, we need to divide the total number of leftover pieces (14) by the number of guests (5). This gives us an average of 2.8 pieces per guest (14 / 5 = 2.8). So, each guest took approximately 2.8 pieces of cake.
"Response:  To calculate how many grams of potato chips (keripik) you can eat if your daily calorie intake is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to use the following formula: 

Total Calories Left = Daily Calorie Target - Total Calorie Consumed 

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: 

Total Calories Left = 2000 - 1800 

Total Calories Left = 200 

Since each serving of potato chips contains 250 calories, we can divide the total calories left by the number of calories per serving to find out how many servings you can consume: 

Number of Servings = Total Calories Left / Number of Calories Per Serving 

Number of Servings = 200 / 250 

Number of Servings = 0.8 

Therefore, you can consume 0.8 servings of potato chips (or 200 grams) if your daily calorie intake is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories."
"Response:  To find out the net profit of making and selling 20 lilin, we need to calculate the total cost of producing 20 lilin first. The total cost can be calculated as follows:  
Total Cost = (Number of lilin x Price per lilin) + (Number of lilin x Production Cost per lilin) Total Cost = (20 x $2.00) + (20 x $10.00) Total Cost = $40.00 + $200.00 Total Cost = $240.00 Now, let's calculate the net profit: Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost Net Profit = ($40.00 x 20) - $240.00 Net Profit = $800.00 - $240.00 Net Profit = $560.00 So, the net profit of making and selling 20 lilin is $560.00."
"Response:  To calculate the total number of hours that Meredith spent writing articles in three days, we need to first determine how many hours she spent writing each day. Let's break down her schedule as follows:

Day 1 (Monday): 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Day 2 (Tuesday): 2x more articles than Monday + 2 additional articles = 8 x 4 hours per article + 2 x 4 hours per article = 32 hours
Day 3 (Wednesday): 2x more articles than Tuesday = 6 x 4 hours per article = 24 hours
Total hours for three days: 20 + 32 + 24 = 76 hours
Therefore, Meredith spent 76 hours writing articles over the course of three days."
"Response:  To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice bought, we need to divide the total number of catatan she placed on the cups (23) by the number of catatan she had left after placing them on the cups (220). Therefore, the answer is:  
23 / 220 = 1/9 or 11% of the package was used."
"Response:  To find out how much John spent on the red vase, we can use the information that he paid $40 for each blue vase and that the red vase is 50% more expensive than the blue vase. Let's call the cost of one blue vase x. Then, the cost of one red vase would be 1.5x (since it is 50% more expensive). We know that John spent $200 on two blue vases, so we can write an equation based on this information:  
2x + 2(1.5x) = 200 
Simplifying the equation:  
3x + 3(1.5x) = 200 
Combine like terms:  
4x + 4.5x = 200 
9x = 200 
Solve for x:  
x = 22 
So, John spent $22 on each blue vase, and since he bought two blue vases, he spent a total of $44 on blue vases. Since the red vase is 50% more expensive than the blue vase, John spent $44 x 1.5 = $66 on the red vase. Therefore, John spent a total of $44 + $66 = $108 on all three vases."
"Response:  If we assume that the length of each cut is 6 inches (as stated in the problem), and we have a total of 4 feet (48 inches) of wire, then we can calculate the number of cuts as follows:  
48 inches / 6 inches per cut = 8 cuts  
Therefore, Tracy can get 8 pieces of wire with a length of 6 inches each to support her tomato plants."
"Response:  To find out how many vacant units there are in the building, we need to subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units. Since each floor has 8 units and 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of vacant units as follows:  
Total number of units = 8 x 15 = 120 units  
Number of occupied units = 3/4 x 120 = 90 units  
Number of vacant units = 120 - 90 = 30 units  
Therefore, there are 30 vacant units in the building."

Total number of oranges = 25
Bad oranges = 1 (1%)
Unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 5 (20% x 25)
Asam oranges = 2

Now, let's subtract the number of bad, unripe, and asam oranges from the total number of oranges:

Good oranges = Total number of oranges - Bad oranges - Unripe oranges - Asam oranges
= 25 - 1 - 5 - 2
= 17

So, there are 17 good oranges in the basket."

Response:  To calculate the total amount that Aleena has paid for the streaming service at the end of the year, we need to first determine the amount she pays in the first half of the year and then subtract any discounts she receives in the second half of the year. Let's assume that the first half of the year consists of 6 months (January-June) and the second half consists of 6 months (July-December).  Monthly subscription fee = $140 Per month Total amount paid in first half of year = 6 months x $140/month = $840 Total amount paid in second half of year = 6 months x ($140/month x 0.9) = $504 (10% discount) Total amount paid for the year = $840 + $504 = $1,344
Response:  To find out how far Sophia can drive with one tank of gasoline, we need to divide the amount of fuel left in the tank (4 gallons) by the fuel efficiency of her car (mileage per gallon). Let's assume that her car has an average mileage of 25 miles per gallon. Therefore, we can calculate the distance as follows: Distance = Fuel Efficiency x Amount of Fuel Left / 100  Distance = 25 x 4 / 100  Distance = 100 miles So, Sophia can drive approximately 100 miles with one tank of gasoline.
"Response:  To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading, we need to calculate the total time he spends on these activities each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks he does them. Let's break down the information given in the question:  
1. Jim watches TV for 2 hours every day (assuming there are 7 days in a week). This means he spends 2 x 7 = 14 hours watching TV per week.  
2. He reads for half an hour every day (assuming there are 7 days in a week). This means he spends half an hour x 7 = 3.5 hours reading per week.  
3. He does these activities 3 times a week. So, he watches TV and reads for a total of 14 + 3.5 = 17.5 hours per week.  
Now, let's calculate the total hours Jim spends on these activities over 4 weeks:  
17.5 hours/week x 4 weeks = 70 hours. Therefore, Jim spends 70 hours watching TV and reading over 4 weeks."
Response:  There are 4 schools competing in the basketball tournament (Ada). Each school has sent a girls' and boys' basketball team with 5 players each, for a total of 10 players per school. Therefore, there are 4 x 10 = 40 players participating in the tournament from all four schools.
"Response:  Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, the number of rubies as R, and the number of emeralds as E. We know that there are 175 berlians (B), which is equal to 3 times the number of diamonds plus twice the number of rubies. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:  
D + 2R = B  
We also know that there are 35 less rubies than diamonds, so we can express this as:  
R = D - 35  
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:  
D + 2(D - 35) = B  
Combine like terms:  
3D - 70 = B  
Now we need to find out how many emeralds there are. We know that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, so we can write:  
E = 2R  
Substituting R = D - 35 into this equation, we get:  
E = 2(D - 35)  
Simplify:  
E = 2D - 70  
Now we have two equations and three unknowns (D, R, and E). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  
D = 60  
R = 45  
E = 90  
Therefore, there are 60 diamonds, 45 rubies, and 90 emeralds in the treasure chest."

"Response:  To find out how much money Bailey started with, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let x be the amount of money that Bailey started with. We know that she received $5 per week for 8 weeks, so she received a total of:  
5 x 8 = 40 dollars in addition to her starting amount. Therefore, the total amount of money that Bailey had after 8 weeks is:  
x + 40 So, if Bailey has $100 at the end of 8 weeks, we can set up the following equation:  
x + 40 = 100 To solve for x, we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:  
x + 40 - 40 = 100 - 40 x = 60 x = 20 Bailey started with $20."

Response:  To calculate the monthly payment for each phone, we need to use the formula for loan payments with fixed interest rate and fixed term. Let's assume that the total cost of each phone is $150, and the interest rate is 2%. The formula for calculating the monthly payment is:  Monthly Payment = (Total Cost x Interest Rate) / (1 - (1 + Interest Rate)^(-Term))  Since Sheila is buying five phones, she will make five payments of $150 each. Therefore, her total cost is $750 ($150 x 5). The interest rate is 2%, so the monthly payment can be calculated as follows:  Monthly Payment = ($750 x 2%) / (1 - (1 + 2%)^(-3))  Monthly Payment = $45 per phone or $225 total per month  For three months, Sheila will pay a total of $675 ($225 x 3).
Response:  To find out how much Artie will earn from selling 12 pot marigolds, 9 pot petunia and 17 pot begonia, we need to multiply each quantity by its respective price.  For marigold, it's 12 x $2.74 = $32.88  For petunia, it's 9 x $1.87 = $16.83  For begonia, it's 17 x $2.12 = $35.04  Therefore, Artie will earn a total of $32.88 + $16.83 + $35.04 = $84.75.

"Response:  To find out how much money Vincent can save by buying 18 flowers with better prices, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers in each package.  If he buys 3 flowers per pack for $2.50, then the total cost would be:  
$2.50 x 3 = $7.50  If he buys 2 flowers per pack for $1, then the total cost would be:  
$1 x 2 = $2  Since Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers, he will have to pay $7.50 if he buys them in packages of 3 and $2 if he buys them in packages of 2. Therefore, the difference between the two options is:  
$7.50 - $2 = $5.50  So, Vincent can save $5.50 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 instead of buying them in packages of 3."

"Response:  Let's denote the number of matches played as ""m"". The number of wins as ""w"" and the number of losses as ""l"". We know that w + l = m (total number of matches) and w > l (more wins than losses). From the problem statement, we can write an equation based on these two facts:  m = w + l  
Substituting w = 8 and solving for m, we get:  m = 8 + l  
Since they won more than they lost, l < w, so we can substitute l = 4 (half of 8):  m = 8 + 4  
Solving for m, we get:  m = 12  
Therefore, the team played 12 matches in total."
"Response:  To calculate the number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to know how many trips he has taken and how many blocks are in each trip. We are given that Gene takes four trips per year and has been traveling since he was 23 years old. Therefore, he has taken 34 - 23 = 11 years worth of trips. Since each trip has a different number of blocks, we can't simply multiply the number of trips by the number of blocks per trip to get the total number of blocks. Instead, we need to add up all the blocks from each trip. Let's call the number of blocks in each trip ""x"" (since we don't know what x is). Then, the total number of blocks Gene has is:

11 years x 4 trips/year x x blocks/trip = 440 blocks

So, Gene has 440 quilt blocks in total."
Response:  The alarm went off three times. Here's how we can arrive at this answer:  First time: It rang for four times (as mentioned). Second time: It rang for three times longer than the first time, so it rang for 3 x 4 = 12 times. Third time: It rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times. Therefore, the alarm went off three times.
"Response:  To calculate the annual salary of Sylvie after three years of service, we need to first determine her current salary and then apply the 10% increase for each year of service. Let's assume that Sylvie started working for the company in December of last year, so she has been with the company for five months (1/12 of a year). Her current salary would be:  
$600 x (1/12) = $50  
Now, let's calculate her annual salary after three years:  
Year 1: $50 + ($50 x 10%) = $50 + $5 = $55  
Year 2: $55 + ($55 x 10%) = $55 + $5.5 = $60.50  
Year 3: $60.50 + ($60.50 x 10%) = $60.50 + $6 = $66.50  
Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three years of service would be $66.50."

Let's assume that each adult will eat 10 pounds of coleslaw, and each child will eat half as much (since they are smaller). So, the total weight of coleslaw needed for the adults is:  
10 pounds x 20 adults = 200 pounds  
And the total weight of coleslaw needed for the children is:  
5 pounds x 5 children = 25 pounds  
Therefore, Ted should bring a total of:  
200 + 25 = 225 pounds of coleslaw to the picnic."

Additionally, since Cindy has four pets, the total number of pets owned by all three individuals is: 6 + 4 = 10.
Response:  Let's analyze the information given:  * Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Amy's age = Jackson's age + 5.  * Corey is 2 years younger than Amy. So, Corey's age = Amy's age - 2.  * James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. So, James's age = Corey's age - 1.  Now we can set up equations based on these relationships:  Age of Amy = Jackson's age + 5...3...2... Equation 1 Age of Corey = Amy's age - 2...3...2... Equation 2 Age of James = Corey's age - 1...3...2... Equation 3 We know that Jackson's age is 10. Substituting this value into Equation 1, we get: Age of Amy = 10 + 5 = 15 Age of Jackson = 10 Now substituting the value of Amy's age (15) into Equation 2, we get: Age of Corey = 15 - 2 = 13 Age of James = 13 - 1 = 12 Therefore, Jackson's age is 10, Amy's age is 15, Corey's age is 13, and James's age is 12.
"Response:  To determine how fast Gerald would run the 400-meter distance with his improved diet, we need to first calculate how much faster he is now compared to Lee. We are given that Lee runs the distance in 38 seconds, so Gerald's time without the improved diet is:

Gerald's original time = Lee's time + improvement (in percentage) x distance
= 38 s + 10% x 400 m
= 38 s + 40 s
= 78 s

Therefore, Gerald's original time was 78 seconds. Now, with his improved diet, his new time can be calculated as follows:

New time = Old time + improvement (in percentage) x distance
= 78 s + 10% x 400 m
= 78 s + 40 s
= 118 s

So, with his improved diet, Gerald would run the 400-meter distance in 118 seconds, which is approximately 2 hours and 9 minutes."
Response:  Let's denote the number of cats as C and the number of dogs as D. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can write: 2C = D  We know that the total number of pets is less than or equal to 12 (the number of rabbits), so we can set up the inequality: D + 2C <= 12  Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:  2C + D <= 12  Now we can solve this linear equation by adding C and D:  3C + D = 12  Since C = 2D, we can simplify:  3(2D) + D = 12  Expanding and simplifying further gives us:  6D + D = 12  Therefore, D = 8 and C = 2D = 16.  So there are 8 dogs and 16 cats in the neighborhood.
"Response:  To find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts, we need to subtract the number of girls who are in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls. Let's use the information given in the problem:

Total number of girls = 2/5 x 200 + 2/3 x 200 = (2/5) x 200 + (2/3) x 200 = 40 + 66 = 106

Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the Girl Scouts
= 106 - 2/3 x 200
= 106 - 66
= 40

Therefore, there are 40 girls who are not in the Girl Scouts."

"Response:  To find the total volume of the three boxes, we need to calculate the volume of each box and then add them up. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height.  For the first box (5 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches high), the volume is:  
Volume = length x width x height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches  For the second box (6 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 5 inches high), the volume is:  
Volume = length x width x height = 6 x 4 x 5 = 80 cubic inches  For the third box (4 inches long, 5 inches wide, and 6 inches high), the volume is:  
Volume = length x width x height = 4 x 5 x 6 = 120 cubic inches  Therefore, the total volume of the three boxes is:  
Total Volume = Volume of First Box + Volume of Second Box + Volume of Third Box = 120 + 80 + 120 = 320 cubic inches"
"Response:  To determine how many episodes of 30 minutes that Frankie watches on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total number of hours she spends watching TV on Wednesday and then divide it by the length of each episode. Let's break down the information given in the question: 

Frankie watches TV for 1 hour every night (except Thursday) 
On Monday and Tuesday, she watches 1 episode per night 
On Wednesday, she watches several episodes (not specified how many) 
On Thursday, she finishes her work early and watches 1 episode and an additional 30-minute show 
On Friday, she has nothing to do and watches 2 episodes 

Let's assume that Frankie watches x episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday. Since she watches several episodes, we can estimate the number of episodes based on the average time spent watching TV on Wednesday. According to the question, Frankie watches TV for 1 hour every night except Thursday, so she spends 1 hour x 7 days = 7 hours watching TV on Wednesday. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows: 

Number of episodes = Total time watched / Length of each episode 
= 7 hours / 30 minutes/episode 
= 21 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watches 21 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."

Let's start with Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups x 24 pieces per roll-up = 48 pieces of fruit consumed by Beatrice. Now, let's move on to Marcel's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups x 14 pieces per roll-up = 42 pieces of fruit consumed by Marcel. In total, both contestants have consumed 48 + 42 = 90 pieces of fruit. Since there were originally 36 roll-ups (24 long and 12 short), the average number of fruit eaten by each person is: 90 / 36 = 2.5 pieces of fruit per person.
Response:  To find out how much water has been taken by the boat, we need to calculate the volume of water that the boat can hold based on its size and capacity. Let's assume that the boat is 20 feet long (since Julia traveled 20 feet before reaching the shore) and has a width of 3 feet (based on the given information). The area of the boat's hull can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 20 x 3 = 60 square feet Since the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it travels, the amount of water taken in by the boat can be calculated as follows: Water taken in = Volume of water x Distance traveled = 60 x 20 = 1200 liters Therefore, Julia's boat took in 1200 liters of water when she reached the shore.
"Response:  To find out how many times the blackboard is cleaned in one day, we need to know that each teacher has two classes and each class uses the blackboard three times. Therefore, the total number of times the blackboard is used in one day is:  
2 x 2 = 4 classes per day  
4 x 3 = 12 times the blackboard is used per day  
So, the blackboard is cleaned 12 times in one day."

"Response:  To find out how many crocodiles can be seen in Jamal's photo of the zoo, we need to divide the number of photos that Jamal's phone can store (1800) by the difference between the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can store (50 times more than the number of birds in the photo) and the number of birds in the photo (50). Therefore, we have:  

1800 / (50 x 50 - 50) = 1800 / (2500 - 50) = 1800 / 2450 = 733.33 or approximately 734 crocodiles can be seen in Jamal's photo of the zoo."
"Response:  If Sasha sells all of her lumber for $10 per piece (for the 2x4s) and $16 per piece (for the 4x4s), she will have a total revenue of:

10 x 10 = $100 (for the 2x4s) + 16 x 5 = $80 (for the 4x4s) = $180

Her profit would be:

$180 - $100 (cost of 2x4s) - $80 (cost of 4x4s) = $180 - $180 = $0

So, Sasha would not make any profit from selling all of her lumber."
Response:  To find out how many spoons of sugar Katy used, we can set up a ratio based on the information given: 7:13 = x:y (where x is the number of spoons of sugar and y is the number of cups of water) We know that Katy used a total of 120 spoons of sugar and water, so we can substitute these values into the ratio: 7x = 120 And 13y = 120 Solving for x, we get: x = 17 And y = 9 So Katy used 17 spoons of sugar and 9 cups of water to make her coffee.

"Response:  To calculate the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to know that each container contains 5 cars. Therefore, if there were 2 containers imported on the first day, with 5 cars in each container, then the total number of cars imported on the first day is:  
Day 1: 2 containers x 5 cars per container = 10 cars  
On the second day, there are more containers brought into the port, and the total number of cars imported becomes:  
Day 2: x containers x 5 cars per container = 30 cars (since there are 30 cars in total) We can set up an equation based on this information:  
x = 30 / 5 x = 6 Since there are 6 containers imported on the second day, the number of containers imported on the second day is 6."
Response:  Let's denote Adrien's salary four years ago as A and Lylah's salary four years ago as L. We know that Adrien's current salary is 30% higher than Lylah's current salary, so we can write:  A = L + (L x 0.3) Now we know that Adrien received 40% more than he did four years ago, so we can write:  A = L + (L x 0.3) + (L x 0.4) Solving for A, we get:  A = L + (L x 0.3) + (L x 0.4) = L + L x 0.3 + L x 0.4 = 2L + L x 0.7 Now we know that Adrien received $40,000 four years ago, so we can set up an equation: 2L + L x 0.7 = 40,000 Solving for L, we get:  L = 25,000 So Adrien's current salary would be:  A = L + (L x 0.3) + (L x 0.4) = 25,000 + (25,000 x 0.3) + (25,000 x 0.4) = 25,000 + 7,500 + 10,000 = 42,500 And Lylah's current salary would be:  L = 25,000 Therefore, the total amount of money that both Adrien and Lylah receive four years later is:  Total = A + L = 42,500 + 25,000 = 67,500
Response:  If Miguel uses two sheets of paper per week and there are 30 sheets of paper in one sheet, then he uses 60 sheets of paper per month (2 x 30).
Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:  * Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.  * Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette and half as many oranges. We can represent this information using algebraic expressions:  * Morisette brought 5x apples (where x is the number of apples brought by Morisette) and 8y oranges (where y is the number of oranges brought by Morisette).  * Kael brought 2(5x) = 10x apples and (1/2)(8y) = 4y oranges. Now we need to find out how much fruit each person brought in total. For Morisette:  Total apples = 5x + 4y Total oranges = 8y For Kael:  Total apples = 10x Total oranges = 4y Since we are asked for the total amount of fruit that each person brought, our answers will be:  Morisette brought 5x + 8y fruit (where x and y are variables representing the number of apples and oranges brought by Morisette, respectively) Kael brought 10x + 4y fruit
Response:  To find out how many hours Sadie slept in one week, we need to calculate her sleep time for each day and then add it up. Let's break down the information given:  Day 1: 8 hours (Sadie usually sleeps for 8 hours) Days 2-3: 6 hours less than previous days (Sadie sleeps 2 hours less each day) Total sleep time for days 2-3: 6 hours x 2 days = 12 hours Less sleep time on days 4-5: 1 hour more than previous days (Sadie sleeps 1 hour more each day) Total sleep time for days 4-5: 1 hour x 2 days = 2 hours Total sleep time for the week: 8 + 12 + 2 = 22 hours So, Sadie slept for 22 hours during the week.
Response:  To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate her running speed for each hour and then add up all the distances she covers. Since she runs at different speeds during different hours, we'll use the following formula: Total Distance = (Speed x Time) + (Speed x Time)... + (Speed x Time). In this case, the total distance is equal to: Total Distance = (10 mi/hr x 3 hrs) + (5 mi/hr x 4 hrs) = 30 mi + 20 mi = 50 mi So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

Response:  To find out how many sendok were in Julia's package, we need to divide the number of sendok she had after her husband gave her some by the number of sendok he gave her. So, if Julia had 3 sendok before and her husband gave her 5 more, then she has 3 + 5 = 8 sendok now. Therefore, there were 8 sendok in Julia's package.
Response:  Dylan bought 44 sausages (38 + 6) for her party.
Response:  If Lily has 50 friends and Amy has 20 friends, then together they have 50 + 20 = 70 friends.
"Response:  To calculate the total cost of the items that Dillon will purchase, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price. For semangka, the price is three times higher than the price of lada, so we can use the following formula:  
Total Cost of Semangka = (Number of Semangka x Price of Lada) / 3  
Since there are four semangka, and the price of lada is $15, the total cost of semangka would be:  
Total Cost of Semangka = (4 x $15) / 3 = $60 / 3 = $20 per semangka  
For paprika, the price is simply $20 for every 20 pieces, so the total cost would be:  
Total Cost of Paprika = 20 x $20 = $400  
And for jeruk, the price is $15 less than the price of semangka, so the total cost would be:  
Total Cost of Jeruk = ($20 - $15) x Number of Jeruk = ($20 - $15) x 10 = $5 x 10 = $50  
Therefore, the total cost of all the items that Dillon will purchase would be:  
Total Cost = Total Cost of Semangka + Total Cost of Paprika + Total Cost of Jeruk = $20 + $400 + $50 = $470"
Response:  To calculate the profit of the hospital from this visit, we need to know the number of patients seen and the time spent with each patient. Let's assume that the average time spent with each patient is 24 minutes (as given in the problem statement).  First, let's calculate the total amount earned by the doctor for the visit: Number of patients = 500 Average time spent with each patient (in minutes) = 24 Total time spent with all patients = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes Doctor's fee per hour = $150 So, the doctor's earnings for the visit are: Doctor's earnings = 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 200 hours x $150 per hour = $30,000 Now, let's calculate the hospital's earnings for the visit: Hospital's earnings = Patient volume x Average charge per patient x Time spent with each patient Hospital's earnings = 500 x $200 x 24 = $240,000 The hospital's earnings for the visit are $240,000. Therefore, the profit of the hospital from this visit is: Profit = Hospital's earnings - Doctor's earnings Profit = $240,000 - $30,000 = $210,000
Response:  There are 20 elves left (10 x 3 = 30 - 10 = 20).

Response:  To calculate how many tickets Pam and Fred used that day, we need to add up the number of rides they took for each attraction. For the roller coaster, Pam rode twice (2 x 6 = 12) and Fred rode four times (4 x 6 = 24). For the luge, both Pam and Fred rode two times (2 x 6 = 12). Therefore, in total, Pam and Fred used 36 tickets (12 + 24 + 12).
"Response:  To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday (Rabu), we can use the information that he walked 6 times as far on Tuesday (Selasa) as he did on Monday (Senin). Let x be the number of miles Walt walked on Monday. Then, Walt walked 6x miles on Tuesday. The total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is given as 41 miles. We can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 6x = 41... (1)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7x = 41... (2)

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

x = 6... (3)

Therefore, Walt walked 6 miles on Monday and 6 \* 6 = 36 miles on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he walked 6 \* 36 = 216 miles."

Response:  To find out how many semi-automatic cars are available for rent, we can use the information that 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. This means there are 16 cars in total (12 + 4). Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is: 16/20 x 100% = 80%.
Response:  Let's denote the number of worker bees as W, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of queen bees as Q. From the problem statement, we know that W = 2B and B = 2Q. Therefore, we can write:  W = 2(2Q) = 4Q  So there are 4Q queen bees in the hive.
"Response:  To calculate how much money Jordan can earn in one week by playing video games for work, we need to know his hourly wage and the number of hours he spends playing video games each day. Let's assume that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day (4 hours/day x 7 days/week = 28 hours/week). If his hourly wage is $10, then his weekly income from playing video games would be:  

$10/hour x 28 hours/week = $280/week  
Therefore, Jordan can earn $280 per week by playing video games for work."
Response:  If there is a tax of 10% on all non-food items, then the total cost of all the items purchased by John would be: Susu (2 x 1.10) = 2.20 Telur (3 x 1.10) = 3.30 Bola lampu (3 x 1.10) = 3.30 Cangkir (3 x 1.10) = 3.30 Perangkap kecoa (4 x 1.10) = 4.40 Therefore, the total cost with tax would be $2.20 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $16.50
Response:  To calculate the weekly profit of Lucas's business, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue. Total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of clients by the price of each item: 3 clients x $2 (price of one bottle) = $6 per client x 3 clients = $18. Total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of clients by the price of each item: 3 clients x $5 (price of one bungkus kain) = $15 per client x 3 clients = $45. Weekly profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $18 - $45 = $27. Therefore, Lucas will make a weekly profit of $27.
"Response:  To calculate how many nanas John can harvest in one year, we need to know that there are 100 nanas per hectare and John has 10 hectares of land. We also know that John can harvest his nanas every 3 months. Therefore, we can calculate the number of harvests per year as follows:  
Number of harvests per year = Number of months in a year / Time between harvests  
= 12 months / 3 months  
= 4 times per year  
Now, let's calculate the total amount of nanas John can harvest in one year:  
Total nanas per year = Number of harvests per year x Total nanas per harvest  
= 4 times x 100 nanas/harvest  
= 400 nanas per year"
Response:  To find out how many Lego pieces Johnny has in total, we need to add up the number of pieces in each box he has. Let's break down the information given:  Box 1 contains 500 pieces, which is 1/4 of the total amount of pieces in Box 3 (3 times as much as 500). So, if Box 3 has 3 times 500 = 1500 pieces, then Box 1 has 1/4 of 1500 = 375 pieces.  Box 2 has 1/4 of the pieces in Box 1, which is 375 / 4 = 93 pieces.  Therefore, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny has is: 375 + 93 = 468 pieces.
"Response:  To find out how many bees returned to the hive in the last six hours, we need to subtract the number of bees that left the hive before that from the total number of bees that were seen leaving the hive earlier. Let's break down the information given:  
* In the first six hours, 30 bees left the hive.  
* Half of the bees that left in the first six hours returned within the next six hours (i.e., half of 30 is 15).  
* The remaining bees who left in the first six hours did not return within the next six hours.  
Now let's calculate the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last six hours:  
Total number of bees returning = Total number of bees leaving - Number of bees not returning  
= 30 - (15 + x)  
where x is the number of bees who did not return within the next six hours. We know that there are 2 times more bees returning than those who did not return, so:  
x = 2(15) = 30  
Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:  
Total number of bees returning = 30 - (15 + 30)  
= 30 - 45  
= -15  
So, there were 15 fewer bees returning to the hive in the last six hours than there were bees leaving in the first six hours. Therefore, the answer is 15."

So, the answer is $22."
Response:  If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and Dorothy has 4 times as many friends as Charlie, then Dorothy has 12 x 4 = 48 friends on Facebook.  Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, James has 48 x 4 = 192 friends on Facebook.
Response:  To find out how long it will take for Tim to finish the race, we need to divide the distance between their homes by his speed. Let's call the time it takes for Tim to get home T. We know that Steve is ahead of Tim by 1 mile (1609 meters), so Tim has to cover 2 miles (3218 meters) to catch up with Steve. The formula for time is T = D / S, where D is the distance and S is the speed. For Tim, D = 2 miles or 3218 meters, and S = 264 feet/minute. Plugging in these values, we get T = 3218 / 264 = approximately 12.5 minutes. So, Tim will wait for Steve at home for approximately 12.5 minutes before finishing the race.
Response:  To calculate how much money Shawnda earned that day, we need to know how many people came to her stand and how much each person paid for their ban. Let's assume that 5 people came to her stand on the first day, and each person paid 25 cents for one ban. This means Shawnda earned 5 x 25 = $1.25 on the first day. If 3 people came back to buy all the ban they needed, and each person paid 25 cents for all the ban they bought, then Shawnda earned an additional 3 x 25 = $0.75 from those three customers. Finally, if one person came with a single-wheeled bicycle and paid 25 cents for one ban, then Shawnda earned another 25 cents from that customer. Therefore, Shawnda earned a total of $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25 on the first day.
"Response:  If Carl pays with a $10 bill and each package of cupcakes costs $0.10 per unit, then he will receive 
$10 / $0.10 = 100 units of cupcakes."
"Response:  To find out how many french fries were in the package when Dave bought it, we need to subtract the amount that the seagull, three sparrows, and the squirrel took from the original number of fries. We can do this by using subtraction. Let's start with the total number of fries in the package:

Total number of fries = x

Now, let's subtract the amount taken by each animal:

x - (1/2) = x - 8 (seagull ate half)
x - 3 = x - 6 (three sparrows ate 3 each)
x - 2 = x - 5 (squirrel ate 2)

So, the total number of fries in the package when Dave bought it is:

x - 8 - 3 - 2 = x - 13

To solve for x, we can add 13 to both sides of the equation:

x - 13 + 13 = x

x = 26

Therefore, there were 26 French fries in the package when Dave bought it."
Response:  To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in the semester.  Weekly hours = (3 x 1) + (2 x 2) = 3 + 4 = 7 hours per week Total hours in one semester = 7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours So, Kimo spends 112 hours attending classes in one semester.
"Response:  To calculate how long it will take for all of Bill's bread to be sold if he places them end to end, we need to know the total length of each type of bread and the number of pieces he produces daily. Let's start by calculating the total length of each type of bread:

* Roti (300 x 4 inches/piece = 1200 inches)
* Croissant (120 x 6 inches/piece = 720 inches)
* Baguette (60 x 2 feet/piece = 1200 inches)

Now, let's add up the total length of all three types of bread:

Total length = 1200 + 720 + 1200 = 3120 inches

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length from inches to feet as follows:

Total length (feet) = 3120 / 12 = 260 feet

Therefore, if Bill places all of his bread end to end, it would stretch for approximately 260 feet."
Response:  To determine how many bananas are needed for each animal, we need to know their monthly consumption in kilograms (kg). Let's assume that the weight of one banana is approximately 0.5 kg.  Monkeys consume 200 bananas per month, so they need 200 x 0.5 = 100 kg of bananas per month.  Gorillas consume 400 bananas per month, so they need 400 x 0.5 = 200 kg of bananas per month.  Baboons consume 100 bananas per month, so they need 100 x 0.5 = 50 kg of bananas per month.  Therefore, the total amount of bananas required for all animals for two months would be:  Monkeys: 100 kg x 2 months = 200 kg  Gorillas: 200 kg x 2 months = 400 kg  Baboons: 50 kg x 2 months = 100 kg  Total: 700 kg
"Response:  To determine how far the winner can run, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both participants and compare it with the distance covered by the loser. Let's first calculate the distance traveled by each participant:  
For Blake:  
Distance = 100 yards x 15 laps = 1500 yards  
For Kelly:  
Distance = (100 yards + 40 yards) x 34 laps = 1760 yards  
Now, let's compare the distances:  
Winner (Blake): 1500 yards  
Loser (Kelly): 1760 yards  
Since the winner (Blake) has traveled farther than the loser (Kelly), the answer is:  
The winner can run 260 yards (1760 - 1500) more than the loser."
"Response:  To find out how much Raphael spent in total, we need to add up the prices of all the items he bought. Let's do that:

* 2 ikan badut (more than Anakin)  
Total: 10 fish  
So, together they caught 29 fish."
Response:  To find out how much one bag of marble will cost after 36 months if its price increases by 20% every two months, we can use compound interest formula. First, let's calculate the number of periods (i.e., months) over which the price increases:  Period = Number of months = 36 / 2 = 18 Next, we need to calculate the increase in price for each period:  Increase per period = 20% of original price = 0.2 x $20 = $4 So, the new price after each period is: New price = Original price + Increase per period = $20 + $4 = $24 Now, we can calculate the total price after 36 months using the formula for compound interest: Total amount = Principal x (1 + Interest rate)^Number of periods $20 x (1 + 0.2)^(18) = $20 x (1 + 0.2)^18 $20 x 1.28 = $25.60 Therefore, one bag of marble that originally costs $20 will cost $25.60 after 36 months if its price increases by 20% every two months.

Therefore, all of the toys together are worth $35."
Response:  To determine how much money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the amount of time and money she will save by not doing her taxes herself. Let's assume that she can earn $35 per hour for her freelance work. If she spends 3 hours less on tax preparation by hiring an accountant, she will save $105 ($35 x 3 hours). However, she needs to pay $90 to the accountant. So, the net savings would be $105 - $90 = $15. Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires an accountant to do her taxes.

"Response:  To determine how many times Sandra needs to incubate eggs, we need to divide the number of flans she needs to make by the number of eggs required for each flan. We can do this as follows:  
15 flans x 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs  
Since Sandra gives her neighbor 9 eggs every time she watches her children, she will need to watch the children 5 times (45 eggs / 9 eggs per time) to collect enough eggs for all 15 flans."

Response:  Pancho walks 30 km per day, except for the end of the week when he walks 10 miles. To find out how far he walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by 7 days. Total distance walked per day = 30 km + 10 mi = 40 km (since 1 mile is equal to 1.60934 kilometers) Total distance walked in a week = 40 km x 7 days = 280 km Therefore, Pancho walks 280 km in a week.
Response:  Total biaya setiap seragam = (3 x topi price) + (jaket price) + celana price.  Based on the given prices, total biaya setiap seragam = (3 x $25) + ($25 x 3) + $25 = $75 + $75 + $25 = $175.

Response:  To calculate how much Jessica needs to pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum for her student loan, credit card, and mortgage, we need to first calculate the total minimum monthly payments for each debt. Then, we can multiply that amount by 12 to get the annual payment.  Total Minimum Monthly Payments: Student Loan: $300 Credit Card: $200 Mortgage: $500 Total Minimum Monthly Payments: $1,000 If Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum, she will pay: 150% of $1,000 = $1,500 per month.  Annual Payment: $1,500 x 12 = $18,000 So, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum for all three debts, she would pay $18,000 per year.
"Response:  To prepare 60 carrots for his family's big barbecue reunion, Billy needs to spend approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes (1.5 hours) to peel and cut them, assuming it takes him around 5 seconds to cut each carrot after peeling. This is calculated as follows:  

1. Total time to peel and cut all carrots = Number of carrots x Time taken per carrot
2. Time taken per carrot = (Time taken to peel one carrot + Time taken to cut one carrot) / 2
3. Time taken to peel one carrot = 1 minute (based on the information given)
4. Time taken to cut one carrot = 5 seconds (based on the information given)
5. Time taken per carrot = (1 minute + 5 seconds) / 2 = 25.5 seconds
6. Total time to peel and cut all carrots = 60 carrots x 25.5 seconds/carrot = 1530 seconds or 1 hour, 30 minutes

Therefore, Billy will need approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes to prepare all the carrots for his family's barbecue reunion."
Response:  To find out how much money Juan and Carlos spend on lemons, we can use the information that they pay $3 for every gallon of lemonade they make. Since they make 20 glasses of lemonade per gallon, they have to buy 20/gal x $3/gal = $60 worth of lemons per gallon. Therefore, if they sell $25 worth of lemonade, they must have used $25 / $60 = 40 gallons of lemonade. So, they spent $40 x $3/gal = $120 on lemons.
"Response:  Let's use ""C"" to represent the number of children in China and ""J"" to represent the number of children in Japan. We know that there are 240 people in total (240 = C + J), and 80 of them are from Japan (J = 80). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  C + J = 240  C = 240 - J  Now, we know that there are 60 boys in the Chinese team (60 = C), so we can substitute this value into the previous equation:  240 - J = 60  Solving for J, we get:  J = 180  So, there are 180 children in the Japanese team. To find out how many girls are in the Chinese team, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of children in the Chinese team:   C - 60 =?  Substituting the value of C from the first equation, we get:  240 - 60 =?  Solving for the unknown quantity, we get:  180 =?  There are 180 girls in the Chinese team."
Response:  To find out how much money is left after all expenses and donations, we need to subtract all of Zaid's expenses and donations from his monthly income of $6000. First, let's calculate each of his expenses and donations: Rent: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500 Bahan bakar mobil: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000 Sumbangan: half of $6000 = $3000 Total expenses: $1500 + $2000 + $3000 = $6500 Now, let's subtract his total expenses from his monthly income: $6000 - $6500 = -$500 So, there is no money left after all expenses and donations.
Response:  Total number of shrimps owned by the three friends = (Rani's shrimps) + (Monica's shrimps) + (Bo's shrimps)  Since Rani has 10 more shrimps than Monica, and Monica has 4 less shrimps than Bo, we can write an equation based on these relationships:  Rani's shrimps = Monica's shrimps + 4  And Bo's shrimps = Monica's shrimps + 40  Now we can substitute the expressions for Rani's and Monica's shrimps into the equation for Bo's shrimps:  Bo's shrimps = (Rani's shrimps + 4) + 40  Simplifying this equation, we get:  Bo's shrimps = (10 + 4) + 40  Bo's shrimps = 14 + 40  Bo's shrimps = 54  Therefore, the total number of shrimps owned by the three friends is:  Total number of shrimps = Rani's shrimps + Monica's shrimps + Bo's shrimps  Total number of shrimps = (10 + 4) + (4 + 40) + 54  Total number of shrimps = 14 + 44 + 54  Total number of shrimps = 108

Response:  Based on the information provided, we know that Jean is 30 years old and Mark is 5 years older than half of Jean's age. So, Mark is (30/2) = 15 years older than Jean. Therefore, Jean is 30 - 15 = 15 years old.
Response:  To determine which team will win, we need to calculate the total time it takes for each team to complete the race. Let's assume that Team A has four members with times of 55 seconds, 55 seconds, 55 seconds, and 55 seconds respectively. For Team B, let's assume that the first member runs in 60 seconds, the second member runs in 58 seconds, the third member runs in 57 seconds, and the fourth member runs in 55 seconds. We can start by calculating the total time for each team:  Team A: Total time = (55 + 55 + 55 + 55) = 220 seconds Team B: Total time = (60 + 58 + 57 + 55) = 220 seconds Since both teams have the same total time, the winner is determined by the order in which they finish. In this case, since Team A's members are all equally fast, they will likely finish in the same order as their starting positions. Therefore, Team A will win the race.
Response:  The probability that Jerry will roll a larger number than 3 is 1/2 or 50%. This is because there are only two possible outcomes for each roll of the die: either he rolls an odd number greater than 3, or he rolls two even numbers in a row. Therefore, the probability of rolling an odd number greater than 3 is equal to the probability of not rolling two even numbers in a row, which is 1/2 or 50%.
Response:  If Jenna takes half of the apples that her mother receives, then Jenna and her mother together will have taken 20/2 = 10 apples.
"Response:  To find out how many mice are in each cage, we need to divide the total number of mouse pieces by the number of pieces given to each group. Let's start with the tikus-tikus kecil (small mice). We know that there are 160 pieces of jerami distributed among them, and each mouse is given 6 pieces. So, we can calculate the number of mice as follows:  
160 / 6 = 26  
Therefore, there are 26 small mice in each cage. Now let's move on to the hamsters. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of jerami, and there are 10 hamsters in total. So, we can calculate the number of hamsters as follows:  
5 x 10 = 50  
Therefore, there are 50 hamsters in the hamster cages. Finally, let's look at the kelinci (rabbits) cage. There are 20 pieces of jerami distributed among the rabbits, and we know that each rabbit is given 2 pieces. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:  
20 / 2 = 10  
Therefore, there are 10 rabbits in the rabbit cage. In summary, there are 26 small mice, 50 hamsters, and 10 rabbits in the three cages."

"Response:  To find out how many sacks of rice the trader sold, we can use the following equation:  Total revenue = Number of sacks x Price per sack  Cost price = Number of sacks x Cost per sack  Profit = Total revenue - Cost price  We know that the trader made a profit of $400 and the cost price of each sack is $20. So, we can write down the equations as follows:  
Total revenue = $400  Cost price = $20 x Number of sacks  Profit = $400 - ($20 x Number of sacks)  Now, we need to solve for the number of sacks. To do this, we can subtract the cost price from both sides of the profit equation:  
Profit = $400 - ($20 x Number of sacks)  Subtracting $20xNumber of sacks from both sides gives us:  $400 - $20xNumber of sacks = $400 - $20(x)  Simplifying the left-hand side gives us:  $380 = $20x  Dividing both sides by $20 gives us:  x = 19  Therefore, the trader sold 19 sacks of rice."
"Response:  To find out how much each person will pay, we need to first calculate the total cost of the trip, including the ticket price and food expenses. We can do this by adding up all the costs: 
Ticket price x 3 = $69.75 (for three tickets) + $4.50 (food expenses) = $74.25 Total Cost  Now, if they want to split the cost equally among themselves, they will each pay: $74.25 / 3 = $24.75 Each person will pay $24.75 for the trip."
"Response:  To find out how many persimmons John collected in 3 hours, we need to calculate how many persimmons he can collect in one minute and then multiply it by the number of minutes he spent collecting persimmons. Let's start with the information given in the problem:  John can collect 2 persimmons per minute. So, if he collects persimmons for 3 hours (which is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes), he will collect:  
180 minutes x 2 persimmons/minute = 360 persimmons  
Therefore, John collected 360 persimmons in 3 hours."

Total Population = 8417 + 9092 = 17519  
Subtracting the number of men and women from the total population gives us:  
Children = Total Population - (8417 + 9092) = 17519 - 17519 = 0  
Therefore, there are no children in Soda."
Response:  To find out how many cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate her total number of cards collected in each month and then add them up.  Month 1: Elaine had 20 cards initially, so she collected 3 times that amount, which is 60 cards (20 x 3 = 60).  Month 2: She collected less than half of the previous month's collection, so she collected 20 - (half of 60) = 20 - 30 = 40 cards.  Month 3: She collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first month, so she collected 2 x 60 = 120 cards.  Therefore, Elaine has a total of 60 + 40 + 120 = 220 cards now.
"Response:  If Mark edits 1000 kalimat (words) each week for two publishers, and Publisher A pays him 5 sen (cents) per word, then he can earn from Publisher A as follows:  
1000 words x 5 sen/word = 5000 sen  
Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, Mark's earnings from Publisher B would be:  
1000 words x 2 x 5 sen/word = 20,000 sen  
Therefore, in one week, Mark can earn a total of 25,000 sen ($25)."

"Response:  To calculate how much money John will make in one year with the $5000 prize and 5% raise, we need to first determine his weekly earnings before the prize and raise. If he works 2000 weeks per year (which is equivalent to working 52 weeks per year for 40 years), then his weekly earnings before the prize and raise are:  
Weekly Earnings = $100 x 2000 = $200,000 per year  
Now that we have determined John's weekly earnings before the prize and raise, we can calculate his total earnings for the year including the prize and raise as follows:  
Total Earnings = Weekly Earnings x 52 + Prize + Raise Total Earnings = $200,000 x 52 + $5000 + ($200,000 x 5%) Total Earnings = $200,000 x 52 + $5000 + $10,000 Total Earnings = $200,000 x 52 + $15,000 Total Earnings = $10,000,000 per year So, John will make $10,000,000 in one year with the $5000 prize and 5% raise."
"Response:  To find out how many barrels of wine are produced per year, we need to multiply the number of tons of grapes produced per hectare by the number of hectares planted with grapes. We know that each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, so:  
Barrels of wine produced = Tons of grapes x Number of barrels per ton of grapes  
= 5 tons/hectare x 2 barrels/ton  
= 10 barrels/hectare x 10 hectares  
= 100 barrels/year  
Therefore, Josie produces 100 barrels of wine per year."

Response:  To find out how many kilometers Michael has cycled in total, we need to calculate the distance he cycled each week and then add up all the distances. Let's break down the information given in the question:  Week 1-4: Michael cycles 5 times a week for 25 km each time, so he cycles a total of 5 x 25 = 125 km per week.  Week 5-7 (reduced to 2 times a week): Michael cycles 2 times a week for 60 km each time, so he cycles a total of 2 x 60 = 120 km per week. Total distance cycled by Michael = 125 km/week x 4 weeks + 120 km/week x 3 weeks = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km. Therefore, Michael has cycled a total of 860 kilometers.
Response:  To find out how much the bag of candies weighs in grams, we need to first calculate the total weight of all the candies. Since there are 25 coklats and each one weighs twice as much as an apple, there are 25 x 2 = 50 apples. Each apple weighs 80 grams, so the total weight of all the apples is 50 x 80 = 4000 grams. The bag of candies therefore weighs 4000 + 25 x 40 = 4000 + 1000 = 5000 grams or 5 kilograms.
Response:  To find out how many cupcakes Rosie bought in three days, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she bought each day and then add them up.  On Monday, she bought 4 cupcakes, so on Tuesday, she bought 3 x 4 = 12 more cupcakes.  On Wednesday, she bought 5 x 12 = 60 more cupcakes. In total, Rosie bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cupcakes in three days.
Response:  To calculate the cost of each cup, we need to divide the total cost of half a dozen cups by the number of cups in a dozen.  Cost per cup = Total cost of half a dozen cups / Number of cups in a dozen  Cost per cup = $6,000 / 6  Cost per cup = $1,000  Therefore, the cost of each cup is $1,000.
"Response:  To determine how many times Sara needs to cut grass before she can buy the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate how much money she earns from cutting grass and compare it with the total cost of the items she wants to buy. Let's break down the information given in the question:  
1. She gets paid $5 for each time she watches her neighbors' children (4 times). That's a total of $20.  
2. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she cuts the grass (not specified how many times). Let's assume she does this once as well. So, that's another $4.  
Total amount earned = $20 + $4 = $24.  
Now, let's check if $24 is enough to cover the costs of the items she wants to buy:  
Jaket price = $30  
Sepatu price x 2 = $20 x 2 = $40  
Total cost = $30 + $40 = $70.  
Since $24 is less than $70, Sara needs to cut grass more than once to earn enough money to buy the items she wants. Specifically, she needs to cut grass 3 more times ($70 - $24 = $46) to have enough money. Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  Let's denote the number of ayam merah as x and the number of ayam putih as y. We know that x + y = 2 (since there are two ayam merah) and 3x + 5y = 42 (since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day). Solving the system of equations, we get x = 10 and y = 12. So Jerry has 10 ayam merah and 12 ayam putih.
Response:  To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to divide the distance he walks by his speed: Distance = 1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles Speed = 3 miles/hour Therefore, Time = Distance / Speed Time = 9 miles / 3 miles/hour Time = 3 hours So, Gary spends 3 hours walking around the park.
Response:  To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to add the number of customers she counted on the first two days (100 + 50 = 150) to the total number of customers on the third day (500). Therefore, the answer is 650.
"Response:  Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the large pool has twice as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the large pool is 2x gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 

x + 2x = (4gal/min) × (time) 

where time is 4 minutes ago. Solving for x, we get: 

3x = 16gal 

x = 5gal 

So there are 5 gallons of water in the small pool now."
Response:  To calculate how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost of the items by her hourly wage. Let's do that:  Total Cost = $320 (shoes) + $32 (belt) = $352  Hourly Wage = $8.00  Number of Hours = Total Cost / Hourly Wage  Number of Hours = $352 / $8.00  Number of Hours = 44 hours  Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt.
Response:  To find out how much money is left for Janeth after she pays off her debt of $2000 with an additional 10% interest, we need to calculate the total amount that Janeth needs to pay over 12 months. Firstly, let's calculate the monthly payment amount based on the given information: Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Payments Monthly Payment = $2000 / 12 Monthly Payment = $166.67 Now, let's calculate the total amount paid by Janeth over 12 months: Total Paid = Monthly Payment x Number of Payments Total Paid = $166.67 x 12 Total Paid = $2000 + ($166.67 x 12) Total Paid = $2000 + $2000 x 10% Total Paid = $2000 + $200 Total Paid = $4000 So, there will be $4000 - $2000 = $2000 left for Janeth after she pays off her debt of $2000 with an additional 10% interest over 12 months.
Response:  There are 7 more daisies than roses in the vase. Let's say there are x roses and x + 7 daisies. We know that the total number of flowers is 15 (3 + 7). So we can set up the equation: x + (x + 7) = 15. Simplifying the equation: 2x + 7 = 15. Solving for x: x = 4. Therefore, there are 4 roses and 4 + 7 = 11 daisies in the vase.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, we can let X be the average age of Harriet and Zack. Since Harriet is currently 21 years old, we know that X + 3 = 21. Additionally, since Usia Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, we have:

Daging Ekstra ($2.00) + Keju Ekstra ($1.00) + Alpukat ($1.00) + Saus ($0.25 x 2 = $0.50) = $4.75  
Tambahan ($3.00) = $8.75  
Total Cost = $8.75 + $5.00 (gift card) = $13.75  
So, Chad still owes $13.75 after adding all the extra toppings and using his gift card."
"Response:  To find out how many hours Kalinda and her mother will take to solve the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined speed. Let's assume that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute (4/min) and her mother can place half of the pieces per minute (1/2/min). We can start by calculating Kalinda's speed first:  
Kalinda's speed = 4/min  
Now, let's calculate her mother's speed:  
Her mother's speed = 1/2/min  
Next, we'll multiply their speeds together to get their combined speed:  
Combined speed = Kalinda's speed x Her mother's speed = 4/min x 1/2/min = 2/min  
Finally, we'll divide the total number of pieces (360) by their combined speed to find out how long it will take them to complete the puzzle:  
Time taken = Total pieces / Combined speed = 360 / 2 = 180 minutes or 3 hours"
"Response:  To find out how many melons are not yet ready for harvest after two weeks, we need to calculate the percentage of melons that were not yet ripe and multiply it by the total number of melons at the beginning. Let's break down the information given in the problem: 
* 30% of the watermelons were already ripe when Ashlyn arrived (this means 30% of 120 = 36 melons were ripe). 
* After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ripe (this means 3/4 x 96 = 72 melons were ripe). 
To find out how many melons were not yet ripe, subtract the number of ripe melons from the total number of melons: 
96 - 72 = 24 
So, there were 24 melons that were not yet ripe after two weeks."
"Response:  To calculate how much Mark paid for all 12 cars, we need to add the cost of each car and the tax he paid on each car. Let's break down the calculation step by step:  
1. Cost of each car = $20,000 x 12 = $240,000 (total cost of all cars)  
2. Tax on each car = $20,000 x 10% = $2,000 (tax on each car)  
3. Total tax paid = $2,000 x 12 = $24,000 (total tax paid on all cars)  
4. Total amount paid = $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000 (total amount paid for all cars)  
Therefore, Mark paid a total of $264,000 for all 12 cars."
"Response:  Let's denote the number of clams that Kylie collected on Monday as x. Since she collected 5 more than Robert, who collected 20, we have: 
x = 20 + 5 = 25  On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many clams as she did on Monday, so we have: 
x = 2 \* 25 = 50  Therefore, Kylie collected 50 clams on Tuesday."
Response:  There are 50 semut in the garden.
Response:  There are 12 penguins still buried in the snow because 3/3 = 12 (one third of 36 is 12).
Response:  To determine how many grapevines Steve needs to produce 6 tomatoes per day, we need to calculate how much fruit each vine can produce and how many vines he will need. Let's assume that each grapevine produces 3 tomatoes per week (as stated in the problem). Therefore, Steve would need 6/3 = 2 grapevines to meet his daily tomato demand.
Response:  To ensure that each of John's 20 friends can have 4 slices of pizza, he needs to order at least 20 x 4 = 80 slices of pizza. Since pizzas are only sold in 8-slice portions, John will need to order 80/8 = 10 pizzas.
"Response:  If Ram uses five empty pens to make one full pen and he has 25 empty pens, then he can make:  
25 x 5 = 125 full pens  
Therefore, Ram has 125 pens in total."
Response:  To find out how much money Johnny has after one year, we need to calculate the amount of interest earned on his initial investment of $20 + $10 = $30. If the interest rate is three times the principal, then the interest rate can be calculated as follows: Interest Rate (IR) = Principal x Rate (R) = $30 x 3 = $90 Therefore, the total amount that Johnny will have after one year is: Total Amount = Initial Investment + Interest = $30 + $90 = $120
Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:  * Mary is two years younger than Joan.  * Joan is five years older than Jessa.  We can start by finding out how old Joan is:  * Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Now we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  Therefore, the ages of the three girls are:  * Jessa: 20 years old  * Joan: 25 years old  * Mary: 23 years old
Response:  To find out how many students exit through door C, we first need to determine how many students remain inside after 30% of them leave through door A and 3/5 of the remaining students leave through door B. Let's break down the information given:  - 30% of 1000 = 300 students leave through door A  - 3/5 of (1000-300) = 600 students leave through door B Now, let's calculate how many students are left inside: 1000 - 300 - 600 = 140 students are left inside Since all three doors are used as both entrance and exit doors, the number of students who exit through each door must be equal to the number of students who enter through that door. Therefore, if 300 students entered through door A, then 300 students exited through door A as well. Similarly, if 600 students entered through door B, then 600 students exited through door B as well. This means that only 140 students are left inside, and they will all exit through door C. So, the answer is: 140 students exit through door C.
"Response:  To find out how many more permen John has than James, we need to subtract the number of permen that James has from the total number of permen that John has. Let's do this:  
John has 54 permen and James has 6 permen more than Robert. So, James has:  
James = 6 + 2(Robert) = 6 + 2 x 3 = 6 + 6 = 12 permen  
Now, let's subtract the number of permen that James has from the total number of permen that John has:  
54 - 12 = 42  
Therefore, John has 42 more permen than James."
Response:  If Dolly and Pandora each have two books and they read one book from each other's collection, then together they will have read four books in total (2 + 2 = 4).
Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing per week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then divide it by his writing speed. Let's break down the information given in the question:  * Each of Mike's friends sends him 2 long letters per week, with each letter being 5 pages long.  * Mike replies to both letters with the same length.  * Mike can write one page every 6 minutes. Now, let's calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week:  Total number of pages = Number of letters x Number of pages per letter  Total number of pages = 2 x 5 = 10 pages per week Since Mike can write one page every 6 minutes, we can calculate his writing speed as follows: Writing speed = Number of pages / Time taken to write those pages  Writing speed = 10 pages / 6 minutes/page = 1.67 minutes/page Now, let's calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week: Total time spent writing = Total number of pages x Writing speed  Total time spent writing = 10 pages x 1.67 minutes/page = 16.7 minutes per week Therefore, Mike spends approximately 16.7 minutes per week writing replies to his friends' letters.
Response:  To calculate how many minutes are left for Jason this month, we need to subtract his daily call time with his boss and other people from the total number of minutes available in the month. Let's break down the information given:  Daily call time with boss: 15 minutes x 30 days = 450 minutes  Total additional calls with others: 300 minutes  Total minutes available in the month: 1000 minutes (assuming a 30-day month) Now, let's subtract the daily call time with the boss and the total additional calls with others from the total minutes available in the month:  Total minutes available - daily call time with boss = 1000 - 450 = 550 minutes  Total minutes available - total additional calls with others = 1000 - 300 = 700 minutes Therefore, there are 700 minutes left for Jason this month, assuming a 30-day month.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, we know that Griffin had 24 potatoes before Kyle took 5 of them. Then, Billy took twice as many potatoes as Kyle took, so Billy took 10 potatoes (2 x 5 = 10). Next, Ginger gave Griffin some potatoes, but not enough to make up for all the ones that were taken by Kyle and Billy. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x potatoes. Finally, Colby took 3 fewer potatoes from Griffin than Kyle took, so Colby took 3 - 5 = 2 potatoes. Therefore, the total number of potatoes left with Griffin is:  
24 + x + 2 - 5 =?  
Solving for x, we get:  
x = 21  
So, Ginger gave Griffin 21 potatoes."
"Response:  Let's say there are x number of fish in each aquarium. Since the difference between the number of fish in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in one aquarium, we can write an equation based on this information: 
x + 4 = 2(x)  Simplifying the equation, we get: 
2x + 4 = 2x  Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:  
4 = 4  The solution to the equation is x = 4, so there are 4 fish in each aquarium."
Response:  To calculate how much Jean will be paid for her work as a makeup artist, we need to first determine the total number of hours she worked on the film. Since she worked for 6 hours each day and there were 4 days per week, she worked a total of 6 x 4 = 24 hours per week. Since the film took 5 weeks to finish, Jean worked a total of 24 x 5 = 120 hours.  Next, we need to subtract the discount that Jean gave to the artis. Since she gave a 10% discount, we can calculate the amount owed to Jean by multiplying the total number of hours she worked by the percentage discount. In this case, the calculation is:  120 x 0.10 = 12 So, Jean will be paid $12 less than the original price of $250 per hour. Therefore, the final payment to Jean will be: $250 - $12 = $238 per hour.
Response:  To find out how much each parent paid, we need to divide the total cost by three. So, if the total cost is $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96, then each parent paid $96 / 3 = $32.
"Response:  To find out how much bawang was purchased by the cook, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then divide by the price per unit. Let's do this:  
Number of bags x Weight per bag = Total weight  
Total weight / Price per unit = Quantity purchased  
4 bags x 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds  
200 pounds / $1.50/pound = 133.33 pounds (approximately)  
Therefore, the cook purchased approximately 133.33 pounds of bawang."
"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the difference in the number of kue they ate each day and then multiply that by the calorie content of one kue. Let's break it down:

Day 1 (Monday):
Sue ate 4 times as much kue as her sister, so she ate 4 x 2 = 8 kue.
Her sister ate 1 kue.
Total calories eaten by Sue on Monday: 8 x 200 = 1600 calories
Total calories eaten by her sister on Monday: 1 x 200 = 200 calories
Difference in calories eaten: 1600 - 200 = 1400 calories

Day 2 (Tuesday):
Sue ate 2 times as much kue as her sister, so she ate 2 x 2 = 4 kue.
Her sister ate 1 kue.
Total calories eaten by Sue on Tuesday: 4 x 200 = 800 calories
Total calories eaten by her sister on Tuesday: 1 x 200 = 200 calories
Difference in calories eaten: 800 - 200 = 600 calories

Total difference in calories eaten over both days:
1400 + 600 = 2000 calories

Therefore, Sue consumed 2000 calories more than her sister over the two days."
