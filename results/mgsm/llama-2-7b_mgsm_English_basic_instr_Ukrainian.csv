Explanation:
Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can set up the following equation:

Toulouse = 2 × Charleston
Charleston = 4 × Seattle

Now, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep, so we can substitute this value into one of the equations above:

Toulouse = 2 × (4 × 20) = 80

So, Toulouse has 80 sheep. Now, let's find out how many sheep Charleston and Seattle have together:

Charleston + Seattle = 80 + 20 = 100

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together 160 sheep (80 + 100)."

Melanie started with 3 vacuum cleaners.

The information given in the problem is:
* Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house (1/3 x 3 = 1)
* Melanie sold 2 more to the red house (2 + 1 = 3)
* Melanie had half of what was left at the orange house (3 / 2 = 1.5)

So, after selling at each house, Melanie had 1, 3, and 1.5 vacuum cleaners left respectively. Therefore, Melanie started with 3 vacuum cleaners."

Let's use the information given to find out how many students are enrolled in each type of dance.

* Contemporary dance - 20% of 20 = 4 students
* Jazz dance - 25% of (20 - 4) = 5 students
* Hip-hop dance - Remaining students = 16

Now, we can calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by dividing the number of students who enrolled in that category by the total number of students:

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance / Total number of students x 100
= 16 / 40 x 100
= 37.5%

Therefore, 37.5% of the entire student body is enrolled in hip-hop dance."

* She bought 5 packs of milk that cost $3 each, so she spent $15 on milk.
* She purchased 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, so she spent $6 on apples.
* The total amount Marie paid was $50.

Now, let's find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered:

The problem states that Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal ($12) and the cost of the milk ($15), we get $33 left.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie could have bought at most $33 / $8.50 = 4 boxes of pizza. Therefore, Marie ordered 4 boxes of pizza."

Answer: 48

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, if she can walk at x miles per hour, she can run at 4x miles per hour.
* She can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So, if she can run at 4x miles per hour, she can skip at 2x miles per hour.
* If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 6x miles per hour (since 3/2 = 1.5).

Now, let's find out how far Dana can travel in six hours:

* If she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she will spend 2/3 \* 6 = 4 hours walking and 1/3 \* 6 = 2 hours running.
* In total, she will cover distance = speed x time = 4x + 2x = 6x miles.

So, Dana can travel 6x miles in six hours. Since she can skip at 2x miles per hour, she will cover a total distance of 2x x 6 = 12 miles. Therefore, the answer is 48 miles."

Explanation:
When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than when not holding it. So, if we multiply the original distance of 400 feet by 3, we get 1200 feet. Since this is greater than the distance of 1000 feet from Polly to the dragon, Polly can stand at least 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the gold javelin. Therefore, the answer is 560 feet."

Опис задачі:  We are given the following information about Sophia's car:

* Her car has a 12-gallon tank.
* She has driven 100 miles since last filling her tank.
* She needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank again.

We want to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas. To do this, we will use the formula: distance = amount of fuel / fuel efficiency. In this case, the distance is the number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, and the amount of fuel is the total amount of gas in her tank (12 gallons). The fuel efficiency is the number of miles Sophia can travel with one gallon of gas (this value is not given in the problem, but it can be found in the owner's manual or by doing some research on the average fuel efficiency of cars).

So, if we plug in the values we have been given into the formula, we get:
distance = 12 gallons / fuel efficiency
distance = 100 miles / x
where x is the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car. Since we don't know the exact value of x, we will estimate it based on the average fuel efficiency of cars. Let's assume that Sophia's car has an average fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon (mpg). This means that for every gallon of gas she puts in her tank, she can expect to travel approximately 25 miles. Plugging this value into the equation above, we get:
distance = 12 gallons / 25 mpg
distance = 48 miles
This tells us that Sophia can drive approximately 48 miles on a single tank of gas. However, since she has already driven 100 miles since last filling her tank, she must have filled her tank at least twice (since 100 miles / 48 miles per tank = 2 fills). Therefore, the actual number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas is half of 48 miles, which is 24 miles."

Explanation:
Jim watches TV for 2 hours per day, so he spends 2 x 7 = 14 hours on TV in one week. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 14 x 3 = 42 hours on TV in a month (4 weeks).
To find out how much time he spends reading, we can use the fact that he reads for half as long as he watches TV. So if he spends 42 hours on TV, he spends 42 / 2 = 21 hours on reading in a month.
Therefore, Jim spends 42 hours on TV and 21 hours on reading in a month, or 168 hours in total over 4 weeks."

To find out the total amount of money raised by Tommy, we need to multiply the number of brownies sold by the price per slice and the number of slices of cheesecake sold by the price per slice.

Number of brownies sold = 43
Price per slice = $3
Total amount raised from brownies = 43 x $3 = $129

Number of slices of cheesecake sold = 23
Price per slice = $4
Total amount raised from cheesecake = 23 x $4 = $92

Shiela pays $150 x 3 = $450 for the three cellphones. Since she is making 3-monthly payments, she will have to pay an additional amount as interest. The total amount she has to pay per month can be calculated using the formula: Total Amount = Principal Amount + Interest. In this case, the principal amount is $450 and the interest rate is 2%, so the total amount Shiela has to pay per month is: Total Amount = $450 + ($450 x 2%) = $45 + $9 = $54. So, Shiela pays $54 per month for 3 months."

Explanation:
The given information can be represented in the form of an equation:

Square footage of top level = Square footage of bottom level x 2^n
Where n is the number of levels.
Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, we can find the value of n by dividing 16 by the ratio of the square footage of each level to the previous level:

16 / (2^n) = 16 / (2^(n-1))

Solving for n, we get:

n = log_2(16)/log_2(2) = 3

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
Average square footage = Square footage of bottom level x 2^n = 8 x 2^3 = 8

So, the answer is 8."

Опис проблемної ситуації:
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many total pets do the three have?

Solution:
Let's start by using the information that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets.
We also know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Cindy has x - 2 pets.
The problem states that the three together have 36 pets, so we can set up the equation:
3x + (x - 2) = 36
Simplifying the equation:
4x = 36
Dividing both sides by 4:
x = 9
So, Marcia has 9 pets, Jan has 27 pets (3 times 9), and Cindy has 9 pets. Together, they have 36 pets."

Explanation:
Lee's original time for running the 400-meter hurdles was 38 seconds. Since Gerald's diet improvement increased his speed by 10%, we can assume that Gerald's new time for running the 400-meter hurdles is 10% faster than Lee's original time. Therefore, if Lee ran the race in 38 seconds, Gerald could potentially run it in 35.6 seconds (38 x 1.10)."

Reasoning:
We know that out of the total number of Grade 5 students (200), 2/5 are boys, which means there are 40 boys.
Now, we need to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts. We can do this by subtracting the number of girls who are in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls.
So, if 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts is:
200 - (2/3 x 100) = 160
Therefore, there are 160 girls who are not in the Girl Scouts."

Explanation:
Let's assume the original volume of each tomato is V. Since each can of tomatoes loses half its volume during cooking, the new volume of each tomato after cooking is (V/2).
Now, we know that Freda used 3 times as many tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce compared to the original volume of each tomato. So, the number of tomatoes Freda used can be calculated as follows:
Number of tomatoes = Original volume of each tomato / New volume of each tomato after cooking
= V / (V/2)
= 3V / V
= 3
Therefore, Freda used 3 tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce."

Let's analyze each of Jerome's friends and their number of doorbell presses:

Friend 1 (first visitor) pressed the doorbell 20 times.
Friend 2 (second visitor) pressed the doorbell 1/4 = 5 times more than Friend 1 (20 + 5 = 25).
Friend 3 (third visitor) pressed the doorbell 10 times more than Friend 2 (25 + 10 = 35).
Friend 4 (fourth visitor) pressed the doorbell 60 times.
Now, let's calculate the total number of doorbell presses:
Friend 1 + Friend 2 + Friend 3 + Friend 4 = 20 + 25 + 35 + 60 = 170.
Therefore, the doorbell made 170 ringings."

Explanation:
Frankie watched 1 hour of TV on Monday and Tuesday, which is equal to 60 minutes (1 hour \* 60 minutes/hour).
On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show, which means he watched at least 2 hours of that show (since he had extra time to watch more than one episode). So, he watched a total of 6 + 2 = 8 hours of TV on Wednesday.
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour of a 1-hour show and 30 minutes of another show, which adds up to 75 minutes (1 hour \* 60 minutes/hour - 30 minutes).
On Friday, he watched 2 hours of TV, as you mentioned.
So, in total, Frankie watched 60 + 8 + 75 + 2 = 165 minutes of TV throughout the week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this number to hours by dividing it by 60: 165 minutes / 60 = 2.75 hours. Therefore, Frankie watched 4 30-minute episodes of TV on Wednesday."

Explanation:
Beatrice had 24 fruit roll-ups that were 2 wide and 14 long, which means she had a total of 336 square inches (2 x 24 = 48 + 14 x 2 = 28).
Marcell had 14 fruit roll-ups that were 3 wide and 14 long, which means he had a total of 204 square inches (3 x 14 = 42 + 14 x 2 = 28).
So, together they ate 540 square inches of fruit roll-ups (336 + 204 = 540).
Dividing this number by the total area of all their fruit roll-ups gives us an average of 17.5 square inches per person (540 / 336 + 204 = 17.5)."

Опис задачі:  Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette. How many fruits do they have in total?

Допомога:  To find out how many fruits Morisette and Kael have in total, we need to add the number of fruits each of them brought.
Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so he has a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which means he brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, Kael has a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Solution: Let X be the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week. Since she slept 8 hours on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept a total of 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours. On Thursday and Friday, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept 20 - 4 = 16 hours. Finally, on Saturday and Sunday, she slept 1 hour more each day, so she slept 16 + 1 = 17 hours. Therefore, X = 30 hours."

Explanation:

Let's start by finding out how much one watermelon costs:

Watermelon costs 3 times as much as a pepper, so:

$3x = 15 (since each pepper costs $15)
$3x = 45
x = 15

Now we know that one watermelon costs $15. Let's find out how many peppers Dillon needs to buy:

Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, so he needs to buy 4 x 15 = 60 peppers.

Finally, let's find out how many oranges Dillon needs to buy:

An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so:

$15 - $5 = $10 (cost of one orange)
Dillon needs to buy 10 oranges.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend on watermelons, peppers, and oranges is:

$15 x 60 = $900 (for peppers) + $10 x 10 = $100 (for oranges) = $1000

Therefore, the answer is $300."

Explanation:
The total number of minutes seen by the patients in a day is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes.
Since each doctor charges $150 per hour, the total amount charged by the doctors to the hospital is 12,000 minutes / 60 (minutes in an hour) = $200,000 per day.
Since the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, the total amount collected from the patients is 12,000 minutes / 60 (minutes in an hour) = $200,000 per day.
Therefore, the profit made by the hospital is ($200,000 - $150,000) = $50,000 per day."

So, if we multiply the number of miles he walked on Monday by 3 (since Tuesday is twice as far as Monday), we get 12 miles for Tuesday's walking distance. Then, since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he walked on Monday, his Tuesday distance is 6 x 12 = 72 miles.

Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let X be the total number of unicorns in the world. Since one-third of them are in Scotland, we can write:
X = (3/5)X_Scotland

Now, two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so the number of female Scottish unicorns is:
Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3)(X_Scotland) = (2/3)((3/5)X) = 2(3/5)X

Finally, we can substitute the value of X from the first equation into the second equation to get:
Number of female Scottish unicorns = 2(3/5)X = 18

Therefore, there are 18 female Scottish unicorns."

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he will be able to harvest 4 times a year (4 x 4 = 16). Therefore, John will be able to harvest 10,000 / 4 = 2500 pineapples per harvest.

Sandra wanted 4 times more red roses than white carnations, so she needed 4 x 10 = 40 red roses. Additionally, she wanted 5 times as many pink calla lilies as white carnations, so she needed 5 x 20 = 100 pink calla lilies in total. Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 40 + 100 = 140 flowers by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."

Explanation:
The first team's total time for all four legs would be 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.
The second team's total time for all four legs would be 60 + 58 + 56 + 54 = 258 seconds.
Therefore, the difference between the two teams' times is 258 - 220 = 120 seconds, which is equal to 1 minute and 20 seconds."
"Response: 40%

Explanation:
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 1/6 = 17%. To calculate the probability of not rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to subtract this probability from 100%, since the event ""not rolling two even numbers in a row"" includes the event ""rolling a number greater than 3"". Therefore, the probability of not rolling two even numbers in a row is 100% - 17% = 83%."

Опис задачі:  We are given three pieces of information:

1. The trader paid $20 per bag for the wheat.
2. It cost $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse.
3. The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each.
From these pieces of information, we can calculate the number of bags sold by the trader as follows:

First, let's calculate the total amount of money the trader spent on the wheat:
$20 x Number of bags = Total cost
Total cost = $20 x Number of bags
Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the trader earned from selling the wheat:
$30 x Number of bags = Total revenue
Total revenue = $30 x Number of bags
Now, let's subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $30 x Number of bags - $20 x Number of bags
Simplifying this equation, we get:
Profit = $10 x Number of bags
Since the trader made a total profit of $400, we can set up the following equation:
$10 x Number of bags = $400
Solving for Number of bags, we get:
Number of bags = $400 / $10
Number of bags = 500
Therefore, the trader sold 500 bags of wheat."
"Response:  $16.75

Explanation:
Let's break down the expenses incurred by the three friends:

* Food: $4.50 - $60.75 = $56.25
* Ride 1: $33
* Ride 2: $33

Total cost shared equally among the three friends is:
$60.75 + $56.25 + $33 + $33 = $192.25 / 3 = $64.08

Therefore, each friend paid $64.08."

"Response: 160г

Answer: 160g

Explanation:
Let's first find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, the weight of one chocolate bar is 2 x 40 = 80g. Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 x 80 = 2000g.
Now, let's find the weight of the candied apples. The problem states that there are 80 candied apples, and each one weighs 40g. So, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 x 40 = 3200g.
Adding the weights of both the chocolate bars and the candied apples, we get the total weight of Joe's bag of candy: 2000 + 3200 = 5200g or 160g (since there are 3200/5200 = 0.64 pounds)."

"Response: 18

Опис проблеми:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so the total number of eggs collected is 42 x 7 = 294 eggs per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of eggs by 7 to find out how many eggs each day produces: 294 eggs / 7 = 40 eggs per day. Now, let's analyze the information given in the problem statement: • Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day. • White chickens produce 5 eggs per day. • Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. To solve for the number of red chickens, we need to use the fact that the total number of eggs produced by all chickens is equal to the number of eggs collected by Jerry. So, if R is the number of red chickens, then: Number of eggs produced by all chickens = Number of eggs collected by Jerry 40 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 280 eggs/week (since there are 7 days in a week) Number of eggs produced by red chickens = Number of eggs collected by Jerry - Number of eggs produced by white chickens 280 eggs/week - 20 eggs/day (since white chickens produce 5 eggs/day) = 260 eggs/week Now, since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens must be greater than the number of red chickens. Let W be the number of white chickens. Then, we can write: Number of white chickens = Number of red chickens + 2 Since the total number of eggs produced by all chickens is equal to the number of eggs collected by Jerry, we can also write: Total number of eggs produced = Number of eggs collected by Jerry 260 eggs/week = 40 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 280 eggs/week Now, using the first equation, we can substitute the value of W (the number of white chickens): Number of red chickens = Number of white chickens - 2 2 = 260 eggs/week / 7 = "

Explanation:
Gary walks along the edge of the park for $x$ miles. Since the park is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can find the length of the side he walked along using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: $P = 2(l + w)$, where $l$ is the length of one side and $w$ is the width of the other side. In this case, the length of the side he walked along is $1.5 \times 6 = 9$ miles. Therefore, Gary spent $\frac{9}{3} = 3$ hours walking."

On the third day, there were again 50 more customers than the previous day, so she counted 200 customers (150 + 50 = 200). Therefore, the total number of customers by the third day was 600 (200 + 400 = 600)."
"Response: 2 gallons
Explanation:
Let's call the amount of water in the small pool x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.
Now, we are told that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so the amount of water in the big pool is 4x gallons.
We know that the total amount of water in both pools is 8 gallons (since they are both emptying at a rate of 4 gallons per minute). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + 2x = 8
Solving for x, we get:
x = 2 gallons
So, the small pool currently has 2 gallons of water."

Explanation:
Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so she can complete 240 pieces in an hour (4 x 60). Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, it will take Kalinda and her mom 8 hours to complete the puzzle (360 / 240 = 8).
Since Kalinda's mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, it will also take her 8 hours to complete the puzzle (half of 8 = 4 hours). Therefore, it will take a total of 21 hours for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle (8 + 4 = 21)."

Опис задачі:  Griffin initially had 24 French fries, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 10 more fries (since 2 x 5 = 10). Then Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her own fries, which we can assume to be 6 (a reasonable amount for a ""handful""). So now Griffin has 24 + 10 + 6 = 39 French fries. Finally, Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle took, so he took 3 - 5 = -2 fries. Since Kyle took 5 fries, this means that Colby took -2 - 5 = -7 fries. Therefore, in the end Griffin had 39 - 7 = 32 French fries. Now, if Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, which we know is 6, then she must have given him an additional 6 fries on top of what he already had, bringing his total up to 32 + 6 = 38 French fries."

Опис задачі:  We know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can write:

Number of snails in second aquarium = 2x

We also know that the total number of snails in both aquariums is equal to 32, so we can set up the equation:

4 + 2x = 32

Solving for x, we get:

x = 16

Therefore, there are 16 fish in the first aquarium and 2x = 32 - 4 = 28 fish in the second aquarium."

Explanation:

The total cost of makeup services for the entire duration of the movie can be calculated as follows:

Total hours of makeup application per week = 4 x 6 = 24 hours/week
Total days of makeup application = 5 weeks x 7 days/week = 35 days
Total hours of makeup application = Total days x Hours/day = 35 x 24 = 840 hours

Since the makeup artist charges $250/hour, the total cost of makeup services can be calculated as follows:

Total cost of makeup services = Total hours x Cost/hour = 840 hours x $250/hour = $209,000

After the movie is finished, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, which is equivalent to $20,900 (10% of $209,000). Therefore, Jean pays a total of $209,000 - $20,900 = $188,100."

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so her total consumption was 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.
Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 18 x 200 = 3600 calories more than her sister."
