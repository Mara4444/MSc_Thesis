Explanation:
Wendy gives her chickens three separate meals per day, with each meal containing a mix of seeds, grains, and vegetables. She also feeds her chickens 15 bowls of food in the morning and 25 bowls in the evening. To determine how many bowls Wendy should give to her chickens for their last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total number of bowls she provides to all of her chickens (including both the ones in the morning and those in the evening).
The total number of bowls provided by Wendy is:
15 + 25 = 40
So, Wendy should give her chickens 40 bowls of food for their last meal of the day."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Eliza works for 40 hours at $10 per hour, which means she earns $400 for those 40 hours. Then, she works an additional 5 hours at her regular rate of pay, which means she earns an additional $50 ($10 per hour x 5 hours). Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for that week are $400 + $50 = $450. Since Eliza also receives overtime pay of $1.2 times her regular hourly rate, her overtime earnings would be $1.2 \* $10/hour = $12. So, Eliza's total earnings for that week would be $450 + $12 = $462."

Explanation: To find the total cost of all the sweets, we need to multiply the number of each type by its price per unit and then add up all these amounts. For example, for the poppy seed cookies, we have 3 duzinas (which means 3 x 68 = 204 dollars). Similarly, for the mini cakes, we have 2 duzinas (which means 2 x 80 = 160 dollars), and for the mini cheesecakes, we have 6 duzinas (which means 6 x 55 = 330 dollars). Therefore, the total cost of all the sweets is 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 dollars or 194 dollars."

Explanation: If the trader chooses to buy jewelry worth $5000 and the market for jewelry increases by 2.5%, then the value of the jewelry will increase by $125 (2.5% x $5000). Therefore, the total value of the jewelry after the purchase will be $5125 ($5000 + $125). On the other hand, if the trader chooses to buy electronic devices worth $8000 and the market for electronic devices increases by 1.2%, then the value of the electronic devices will increase by $96 (1.2% x $8000). Therefore, the total value of the electronic devices after the purchase will be $8096 ($8000 + $96). In both cases, the trader's profit at the end of the month will be $3750 ($5125 - $8096)."

Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:
Dana can run four times faster than she walks, which means that her running speed is 4 times the walking speed.
The running speed of Dana is half as fast as the biking speed, so the biking speed is twice the running speed.
If Dana can bike at 3 miles per hour, then she can walk at $ \frac{1}{2} \times 3 = 1.5$ miles per hour.
Now, let's find out how much distance Dana can cover in 6 hours:
For walking:
Distance covered = Speed x Time = $1.5 \times 6 = 9$ miles
For running:
Distance covered = Speed x Time = $4 \times 6 = 24$ miles
For biking:
Distance covered = Speed x Time = $2 \times 6 = 12$ miles
Therefore, the total distance covered by Dana in 6 hours is:
Total distance = Walking distance + Running distance + Biking distance = $9 + 24 + 12 = 45$ miles."

Explanation: To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles during those three days, we need to multiply the number of articles she wrote each day by the time it took her to write each article.
For Monday, she wrote 5 articles and each one took her 4 hours to write, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing on Monday.
For Tuesday, she wrote 3/5 times more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote 3 x 5 = 15 articles. Each article took her 4 hours to write, so she spent 15 x 4 = 60 hours writing on Tuesday.
For Wednesday, she wrote 2 times as many articles as on Tuesday, which means she wrote 2 x 15 = 30 articles. Each article took her 4 hours to write, so she spent 30 x 4 = 120 hours writing on Wednesday.
Adding up all these hours gives us a total of 20 + 60 + 120 = 180 hours that Meredith spent writing articles during those three days."

Judi teaches for 5 hours every day and 8 hours on Saturday. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15 per student, how much money does she make in a week?

Step-by-step solution:
Let's break down Judi's income into daily and weekly amounts:
Daily income = Total hours taught/Number of days taught x Number of students per class x Class fee
= 5 hours/7 days x 15 students/class x $15/student

Weekly income = Daily income x Number of weeks in a month
= $375/week x 4 weeks (in a typical month)
= $1,500/month
Therefore, Judi makes $1,500 per month teaching dance classes."

"Response: 160 pieces of cloth covered the total number of vacations. 
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Dijen went on four vacations and each vacation had its own blanket. Therefore, the total number of blankets = Number of vacations x Number of blankets per vacation.
Since Dijen has been on vacation for 12 years (from 23 to 34), he has gone on 48 vacations (12 years x 4 vacations/year). So, the total number of blankets = 48 x 4 = 192 blankets.
However, since each blanket is made up of blocks from different years, there are actually 160 pieces of cloth used to make all the blankets. This is because each block can be used to make two blankets (one for each year), so 160 blocks can cover 160 blankets."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Ян (Jan) has three times as many pets as Marcia. So, if Marcia has x pets, Jan has 3x pets.
* Marcia has two more pets than Syndi. So, Syndi has x - 2 pets.
* Syndi has four more pets than Marcia. So, Marcia has x - 4 pets.

Now, we need to find the common value of x that satisfies all these conditions. We can start by using the first condition:

3x = 9 (since Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3

So, Marcia has 3 pets, Jan has 3 × 3 = 9 pets, and Syndi has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets among the three people is:

3 + 9 + 6 = 18

Therefore, the answer is 18."

Let's analyze the given information:
* Li is able to run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds.
* Gerald improves his speed by 10% after changing his diet.
Now, we need to find out how much time Gerald can reduce if he runs 400 meters with obstacles.
Using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed, we get:
Time = 400 meters / (Speed + Percentage increase)
Substituting the values, we get:
Time = 400 meters / (38 seconds + 10%)
= 400 meters / 38.9 seconds
= 35.26 seconds
So, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 35.26 seconds."

Explanation: Let's analyze each friend's visit and their number of button presses:
Friend 1 pressed the button 20 times before Jerome opened the door. So, Friend 1 pressed the button 20/5 = 4 times less than Jerome.
Friend 2 pressed the button 25% more than Friend 1, so they pressed it 20 + (20 x 1.25) = 25 times.
Friend 3 pressed the button 10 times more than Friend 2, so they pressed it 25 + (25 x 1.1) = 37 times.
Friend 4 pressed the button 60 times, which is 4 times as many as Friend 3. Therefore, Friend 4 pressed the button 37 x 4 = 158 times.
So, in total, there were 20 + 25 + 37 + 158 = 38 buttons pressed by all four friends combined."

Beatriz has two packages wide and 24 packages long, so she can eat 2 x 24 = 48 packages.
If both of them have eaten their maximum amount, then they have eaten in total 42 + 48 = 90 packages.
So, the average number of packages eaten by Marcel and Beatriz is 90 / 2 = 45 packages."
"Response: 12 liters (L)
Explanation: According to the problem statement, the lodka took in 20 cubic feet of water every ten feet of travel, which is equivalent to 20/10 = 2 liters per ten feet. Since Djuilia traveled 200 feet, she took in 2 x 200 = 400 liters of water. Since it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore, the rate at which she was taking in water is equal to the rate at which she was losing water, so the volume of water in the boat when she reached the shore is equal to the volume of water that she lost, which is 400 - 64 = 336 liters."

Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:
The telephone of Jamal can store 6 times more images than that of Britney. So, if Britney's phone can hold 50 images, Jamal's phone can hold 6 x 50 = 300 images.
Now, we know that the maximum number of images that Britney's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in the picture taken by Jamal at the zoo. Therefore, the number of birds in the picture taken by Jamal at the zoo is:
50 (maximum images) / 5 (actual images held by Britney's phone) = 10 birds
So, there are 10 birds visible in the picture taken by Jamal at the zoo."

"Response: 48 dollars per week
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Lukaas has three clients and each client will need two bottles of bleach and one package of cleaning supplies. The total cost of these items is $10 (2 x $2 = $10). Therefore, Lukaas's weekly income from his clients can be calculated as follows: Weekly income = Total revenue / Number of clients = $10 / 3 clients = $3.33 per client per week. Since Lukaas has 5 potential clients, he can expect to earn an additional $17.50 ($5 x $3.33) per week from them. Therefore, Lukaas's total weekly income can be calculated as follows: Total weekly income = Weekly income from existing clients + Weekly income from potential clients = $3.33 x 3 clients + $17.50 x 5 potential clients = $10.69 + $87.50 = $98.19 per week."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can determine that there are three types of lego pieces in John's room:

* The first type has 500 pieces.
* The second type has 3 times as many pieces as the first type, so it has 1500 pieces (3 x 500 = 1500).
* The third type has 1/4 of the total number of pieces, which is 625 pieces (1/4 x 5000 = 625).

Adding up the number of pieces from each type, we get:

500 + 1500 + 625 = 2750

Therefore, John will collect 2750 blocks of Lego if he collects all the pieces from his room."

* After four weeks, he decides to reduce his cycling frequency to twice a week and increase the distance he covers each time by 40%. So, now he cycles 2 times a week and covers 60% more distance than before, which is 60% of 125 = 75 kilometers per week.
* He continues this pattern for three weeks, covering a total distance of 3 x 75 = 225 kilometers during that period.

"Response: 57%
Explanation:
Let's analyze the situation:

James has 40 water cards out of a total of 100 cards (30 fire types + 20 grass types + 40 water types). This means that water cards make up 40/100 = 0.4 or 40% of James' deck.

Now, let's assume that James loses 8 water cards, leaving him with 40 - 8 = 32 water cards.

If James buys 14 additional water cards, he will have 32 + 14 = 46 water cards in his deck. This means that the proportion of water cards in his deck increases from 40% to 46%.

Since we are interested in the percentage chance that a randomly selected card will be a water card, we can use the formula:

Probability = (Number of water cards / Total number of cards) x 100

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

Probability = (46 / 100) x 100 = 57%

Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected card will be a water card is approximately 57%."

240 000 - 24 000 = 216 000 dollars
Finally, add the registration fee for each car (1000 dollars per car):
216 000 + (12 x 1000) = 238 000 dollars
Therefore, Mark pays 238 000 dollars in total."

Dax will gather apples in the orchard and find half of the number of bugs in the garden. If there are 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden. 
Total number of insects = Number of ants x 2 + Total number of other insects
= 50 x 2 + (Other insects)
= 100 + (Other insects)
Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 100 + Other insects."

"Response: 267
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The number of students in the classroom is 1000.
* 30% of the students have left through exit A.
* 3/5 of the remaining students have left through exit B.
* The remaining students have left through exit C.

Now, let's calculate the number of students who left through exit C:

Number of students who left through exit C = Total number of students - Number of students who left through exit A - (Number of students who left through exit B / 5)
= 1000 - 300 - (3/5 x 700)
= 267

Therefore, the number of students who left through exit S is 267."
"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the question, John has twice as many bonbons as Robert, and James has six more than Robert. So if John has 54 bonnies, he must have at least 6 + 2 = 8 more than James, which is equal to 8 + 6 = 14 more than Robert. Therefore, John has 12 more bonnies than James."
"Response: 3

"Response: 10 hours
Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* Mike is friends with 5 people through email.
* He exchanges emails with 2 of them every week (or 7 days).
* Each email has a length of 5 pages or 20 lines (since each line has a length of 4 words).
* Mike can write one page in 6 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how much time Mike spends writing emails per week:

Number of emails written by Mike per week = Number of people he is friends with x Number of emails exchanged with each person per week
= 5 x 2
= 10 emails/week

Time taken to write an email by Mike = Length of an email / Time taken to write one page
= 5 pages / 6 minutes/page
= 8.33 minutes/email

Since Mike writes 10 emails per week, the total time he spends writing emails per week is:
Total time spent writing emails per week = Number of emails written by Mike per week x Time taken to write an email by Mike
= 10 x 8.33 minutes/email
= 83.3 minutes/week

Now, let's convert this value to hours:
Hours spent writing emails per week = Minutes spent writing emails per week / 60
= 83.3 minutes/week / 60
= 13.85 hours/week

Therefore, based on the given information, Mike spends approximately 10 hours per week writing emails to his 5 friends through post office mail."
"Response: 2700 minutes (or 45 hours)
Explanation:
Jason has a monthly plan of 1000 minutes per month. He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, which is 105 minutes for the entire month (30 days x 15 minutes/day). Additionally, he spent 300 extra minutes talking to other people this month, bringing the total number of minutes used to 705 (1000 - 300). Therefore, Jason has 2700 minutes remaining in his plan (1000 - 705 = 2700)."
"Response: 6
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. Griffin had 24 potatoes initially.
2. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 19 (24 - 5).
3. Jinger gave Griffin 6 potatoes from her own stash, so now Griffin has 25 (19 + 6).
4. Colby took 3 fewer than the number of potatoes that Kyle took, which is 5 (since Kyle took 5 and Colby took 3). So Colby took 2 potatoes (5 - 3 = 2).
5. In the end, Griffin had 27 potatoes (25 + 2), and Digger gave him 6 more. Therefore, the number of potatoes Digger gave to Griffin is 6."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
In one aquarium, there are 4 octopuses, and in another aquarium, there are 32 fish. The difference between the number of octopuses in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. If the number of fish in both aquariums is equal, then the number of fish in each aquarium is half the number of octopuses in the other aquarium. Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is 8 (since 4 x 2 = 8). So, there are 8 fish in each aquarium."
"Response: 375 dollars. 
Explanation:
The grim artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours every day for 5 weeks, which is a total of 90 hours (6 x 15). The total amount paid to the grim artist is therefore $22,500 ($250 x 90 hours). Since the film took 5 weeks to complete, the grim artist gives Dijin a discount of 10%, or $2,250. Therefore, Dijin pays $20,250 for the grim makeup services."

"Response: 680 calories
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* In Monday, Sue eats 4 times more biscuits than her sister. So, if her sister eats x biscuits, Sue will eat 4x biscuits.
* In Tuesday, Sue eats twice as many biscuits as her sister. So, if her sister eats x biscuits, Sue will eat 2x biscuits.
* The total number of biscuits consumed by Sue and her sister together is 5 + 13 = 18.

Now, let's calculate the total number of calories consumed by Sue and her sister:

Sue's calorie intake = Number of biscuits consumed by Sue x Calories per biscuit
= 4x x 200 (since each biscuit has 200 calories)
= 800 calories

Her sister's calorie intake = Number of biscuits consumed by her sister x Calories per biscuit
= x x 200
= 200 calories

Total calorie intake = Sum of Sue's and her sister's calorie intakes
= 800 + 200
= 1000 calories

Therefore, Sue consumes 680 calories more than her sister (1000 - 200)."
