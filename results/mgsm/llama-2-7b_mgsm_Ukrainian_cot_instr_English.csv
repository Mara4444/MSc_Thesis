Response:  Utie Janet lays 16 eggs per day and sells them at $2 each. So she makes $32 in revenue from egg sales every day (16 eggs x $2/egg = $32). Now, let's calculate how much money she spends on food. She eats three eggs for breakfast every day, which costs her $6 ($32 / 3 eggs = $6). And she bakes four cakes for her friends daily, which also costs her $6 ($32 / 4 cakes = $6). Therefore, Utie Janet spends a total of $12 on food every day ($6 + $6 = $12). So, her profit from egg sales is $32 - $12 = $20 per day.
"Response:  We need to make two pieces of clothing from the given materials: one for the top and one for the bottom. For each piece, we will use half of the white thread and all of the blue thread. Therefore, the total amount of thread needed is:
Top: Half of 2 = 1 unit of white thread + 1 unit of blue thread = 3 units of thread (since there are 3 threads in total)
Bottom: All of 2 = 2 units of white thread + 1 unit of blue thread = 5 units of thread (since there are 5 threads in total)
So, in total, we need 3 + 5 = 8 units of thread."
Response:  Firstly, Josh bought the house for $80,000. Then he spent $50,000 on renovation, which is equal to 62.5% of the original price ($50,000 / $80,000 = 0.625). So, after renovation, the new value of the house is: New Value = Original Price x (1 + Percentage Increase) = $80,000 x (1 + 0.625) = $137,500. Therefore, Josh made a profit of $57,500 ($137,500 - $80,000).
Response:  First sprint - 60 meters x 3 = 180 meters Second sprint - 60 meters x 3 = 180 meters Third sprint - 60 meters x 3 = 180 meters Total distance for three sprints = 540 meters So, James runs a total of 540 meters per week.
Response:  Vandy gives her chickens three bowls of mixed feed for every day, which contains seeds, grains, and vegetables to help them stay healthy. She divides this food into three separate portions for each bird. In the morning, she feeds her flock 15 bowls of food, and in the afternoon, she adds another 25 bowls of food. If there are 20 chickens in Vandy's flock, how many bowls of food does she need to give them altogether per day?  Solution: To find out how many bowls of food Vandy needs to give her chickens per day, we can use the information provided in the question. We know that Vandy gives her chickens 3 bowls of mixed feed per day, and since there are 20 chickens in her flock, she will need to give them a total of 60 bowls of food per day (3 bowls x 20 chickens = 60 bowls). Therefore, the answer is 60 bowls of food per day.
Response:  If one cup costs $5 and each subsequent cup costs 60% of the previous price, then we can write an equation as follows:  Cup 1 = $5, Cup n = ($5 x 0.6)^n  Substituting n = 16 for the number of cups Kailar wants to buy, we get:  Cup 16 = ($5 x 0.6)^16  Using the formula for exponentiation (e^x), we have:  e^(0.6)^16 = 2.7843...  So, Kailar needs to pay $2.7843... for 16 cups.
"Response:  We know that in Toulouse there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston and four times as many sheep as in Seattle. So, if we write down these information:
Toulouse - x sheep
Charleston - 2x sheep
Seattle - 4x sheep
We can see that:
x + 2x = 3x (since there are twice as many sheep in Charleston as in Toulouse)
2x + 4x = 8x (since there are four times as many sheep in Seattle as in Charleston)
Solving this system of equations, we get:
x = 16
So, there are 16 sheep in Toulouse, 32 sheep in Charleston, and 80 sheep in Seattle."
Response:  Firstly, Carla can download 2 GB per hour, so it will take her 200 / 2 = 10 hours to download the file. However, when she is downloading at 40% of the way through, Windows forces her to restart and install an update that takes 20 minutes. Therefore, Carla needs to start over from the beginning, which means she has wasted 10 + 20 = 30 hours of time. So, in total, Carla must spend 30 hours downloading the file.
"Response:  Firstly, John travelled for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour, which means he covered a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, he realized that he had forgotten something important and turned back home. He tried to reach home in 4 hours, but during the first 2 hours, he was moving slowly (at a speed of 30 miles per hour). So, the distance he covered during these 2 hours is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 30 miles/hour x 2 hours = 60 miles

After this, he traveled for another 4 hours at a speed of 80 miles per hour, so the distance he covered during these 4 hours is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 80 miles/hour x 4 hours = 320 miles

Therefore, after 4 hours, John was away from his home by a distance of:

Total Distance = Distance covered during slow movement + Distance covered during fast movement = 60 miles + 320 miles = 380 miles

So, John was 380 miles away from his home after 4 hours of traveling."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Eliza earns $10 per hour for her first 40 hours of work. Therefore, she has earned $400 (40 x $10) in those 40 hours. Now, we are told that she receives overtime pay of 1.2 times her normal hourly rate. So, for every hour worked beyond 40 hours, she will receive $12 (1.2 x $10). To find out how much she earned in overtime, we can multiply the number of overtime hours by the overtime pay rate: $12 x 15 = $180 (since she worked 15 hours beyond 40 hours). Therefore, Eliza's total weekly earnings are: $400 + $180 = $580.
Response:  In the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times.  In the second month, it was downloaded 180 times (3 times more than in the first month).  In the third month, it was downloaded 120 times (20% less than in the second month). Therefore, the total number of downloads for these three months is:  60 + 180 + 120 = 460
Response:  Tulа bought 3 ten-piece packs of perogies (3 x 10 = 30 pieces). Each piece of perogy cost $0.68. Therefore, the total cost of perogies is: 30 x $0.68 = $20.40.  Next, she bought 2 ten-piece packs of mini-keks (2 x 10 = 20 pieces). Each piece of mini-keks cost $0.80. Therefore, the total cost of mini-keks is: 20 x $0.80 = $16.00. Finally, she bought 6 ten-piece packs of mini-kix with cream cheese (6 x 10 = 60 pieces). Each piece of mini-kix with cream cheese cost $0.55. Therefore, the total cost of mini-kix with cream cheese is: 60 x $0.55 = $33.00. So, in total, Tulа spent $20.40 + $16.00 + $33.00 = $79.40.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend on planting and maintaining the lemon tree over its lifespan. The cost of planting is $90, and the annual maintenance cost is $3. Therefore, the total cost over one year is $90 + $3 = $93. To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to break even, we can divide the initial investment ($93) by the revenue he will generate per year ($7 \times 1.5 = $10.5). So, it will take Carlos approximately 93 / 10.5 = 8.9 years to break even.
Response:  Melany sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, two-thirds in the red house, and half of what was left in the orange house. So, she started with 3 + 2 = 5 vacuum cleaners.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students in the dance class:  • 20% studied contemporary dances. This means that 4 students (20% x 4 = 8) studied contemporary dances.  • 25% of the remaining students studied jazz dances. That means that 5 students (25% x 16 = 4) studied jazz dances.  • The rest of the students (73%) studied hip hop. So, there are 73/100 = 73 students who studied hip hop. Therefore, the number of students who studied hip hop is 73.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the expected value of each plan separately using historical data provided in the problem statement. The market growth rate for jewelry is given as 2.5%. Therefore, if Torger buys jewelry worth $5000, he can expect it to be worth $5125 after one month (i.e., $5000 x 1.025). Similarly, if he buys electronic gadgets worth $8000, he can expect them to be worth $8160 after one month (i.e., $8000 x 1.012). Now, let's compare these values and choose the option that maximizes Torger's profit at the end of the month. As you can see from the calculations above, the expected value of the jewelry plan ($5125) is higher than that of the electronics plan ($8160), even though the latter has a higher initial price tag. So, based on this analysis, Torger should choose the jewelry plan to maximize his profits at the end of the month.
Response:  On day one, both trains travel west for 80 miles, so each train has traveled 80/2 = 40 miles.  On day two, they travel north for 240 kilometers, which is equal to 150 miles. Therefore, the total distance traveled by each train over the two days is 40 + 150 = 190 miles.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate Dijill's hourly wage for teaching and coaching separately. For teaching, her hourly wage is $20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week; for coaching, it is $30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week. Now, let's calculate her annual salary based on these figures: Annual Salary = Weekly Earnings x Number of Weeks Worked in a Year = $700/week x 50 weeks/year + $450/week x 10 weeks/year (for coaching) = $35,000 + $4,500 = $39,500/year. Therefore, Dijill's yearly salary is $39,500."
Response:  Cler makes an omelette with three eggs for breakfast every day. If she eats one-third of each egg (since there are three eggs in total), then she consumes 3/3 = 1 egg per day. Therefore, over four weeks, she will have consumed 4 \* 1 = 4 eggs. So, the answer is 4 dozen eggs or 24 eggs.
Response:  First 4 miles took her an hour, so she walked at a speed of 4 miles/hour for that distance = 4 miles / 1 hour = 0.04 miles/minute.  Next 2 miles took her another hour, so she walked at a speed of 2 miles/hour for that distance = 2 miles / 1 hour = 0.02 miles/minute.  To find out what speed she needs to maintain for the remaining distance, we need to divide the total distance left to cover by the time taken to cover it: Total distance = 12 miles Remaining distance = 12 miles - 4 miles = 8 miles Time taken to cover 4 miles = 1 hour = 60 minutes Time taken to cover remaining distance = Total distance / Time taken to cover it = 8 miles / 60 minutes = 0.13 miles/minute Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of approximately 0.13 miles per minute to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.
Response:  We know that there are 10 liters of apple juice and we want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice. So, the total volume is 10 + 15 = 25 liters. Since we can't mix more than 3/4 of water with fruit juice, the proportion of water in the remaining 24 liters will be 24 / (25 - 1) = 8/7 or approximately 1.14. Therefore, there are 1.14 x 24 = 27.6 liters of water in the other 24 liters of juice.
Response:  We know that R aymond is two years younger than Samantha, so Raymon d was born in 1989 and Samantha was born in 1991. Therefore, Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old, which means his son was born in 2004. If Samantha is currently 31 years old, then she was born in 1990. So, Raymond's son was born 17 years ago.
Response:  First three clients buy one each = 3 DVDs. Next two clients buy 2 each = 4 DVDs. Total so far = 7 DVDs. Last three clients did not buy any DVDs = 0 DVDs. Therefore, total number of DVDs sold by Bill on Wednesday = 7 + 0 = 7 DVDs.
"Response:  The length of the candle is decreasing at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So, after 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00), the length will be:

Length = Initial length - (Time x Rate)
= 20 cm - (4 h x 2 cm/h)
= 20 cm - 8 cm
= 12 cm

Therefore, after burning from 13:00 to 17:00, the length of the candle will be 12 cm shorter than its initial length."
Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a discount of 25%. So we can write an equation as follows: Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage) Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) Original price = $78.00 Therefore, the original price of the book was $78.00.
"Response:  We know that Mariamade several purchases:  - A chicken portion costing $ 12;  - 5 packs of milk at $ 3 each;  - 4 apples at $ 1.50 each; and some pizza boxes.  Total amount paid by Maria was $ 50. So we can write an equation using these values:  Chicken Portion = $ 12 Milk (packs) = $ 3 x 5 Apples = $ 1.50 x 4 Pizza Boxes =? Total Amount Paid by Maria = $ 50 Now we need to find out how many pizza boxes Maria bought. To do this, we divide the total amount paid by the cost of one pizza box: $ 50 / $ 8.50 = 6 pizza boxes Therefore, Maria bought 6 pizza boxes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mikhail bought 3 pairs of shorts, which cost him $ x + $ x + $ x = $ 48 dollars. Secondly, he bought 3 pairs of pants, which cost him $ y + $ y + $ y = $ 74 dollars. Finally, he bought 3 pairs of shoes, which cost him $ z + $ z + $ z = $ 132 dollars. Therefore, in total, Mikhail spent $ 48 + $ 74 + $ 132 = $ 254 dollars.
"Response:  Since Synthia eats one portion of ice cream per day and buys boxes with 15 portions per box for $4.00 per box...

$$ \therefore Total Cost = NumberOfPortions \times PricePerPortion $$

In this case, the total cost would be:

$$TotalCost = 365 (days in a year) \times 1 (portion per day) \times 4.00 (price per box) = 14600.00 $$

So, Synthia will spend $14600.00 on ice cream over the course of a year."
Response:  First, we know that Henry stopped after 20 miles and then again before finishing his 60-mile ride. So, the distance between these two stops is equal to 60 - 20 = 40 miles. Therefore, the answer is 40 miles.
"Response:  Gloria spent $5 less than the cost of the shoes she bought. So, if the cost of one pair of shoes is x dollars, then the cost of the other pair must be $x/2 dollars. Since the total cost of both pairs is equal to $5 less than the cost of the first pair, we can set up the equation:

$x + ($x/2) = 5

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + x = 10

Combining like terms, we have:

3x = 10

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that the cost of each pair of shoes is $10 / 3 = $3.33. Therefore, the cost of the choos is $3.33 \* 2 = $6.66."
Response:  Darrel is 7 years older than Allen, so their current age difference is 7 + 11 = 18 years.  If their combined age is currently 162 years, then Allen's age without considering Darrel is (162 - 18) = 144 years old.  Therefore, after 10 years, Allen will be 144 + 10 = 154 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we have Gunter who estimates that there are 80 batonnettes in the bowl. Then, his friend says that there are 20 more than half of the first estimate, which is 40 (since half of 80 is 40). Finally, another friend adds that their estimation is 25% more than Gunter's, so they believe there are 160 batonettes in total ( since 25% more of 40 is 100, and adding it to 40 gives us 160). Therefore, the average number estimated by all three friends is 160.
Response:  We know that John is taking care of 10 dogs and each dog spends half an hour for exercise and grooming. So, in total, he has to spend 5 hours per day (since there are 24 hours in a day) taking care of his dogs. Therefore, he spends 35 hours per week (5 hours/day x 7 days/week) taking care of his dogs.
Response:  We know that Grethe has 110 coins in total and that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we have x silver coins, then we have 3x gold coins.  Substituting this into the equation above, we get:  x + (3x) = 110...(1)  Now, simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 110...(2)  Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:  x = 55...(3)  Therefore, Grethe has 55 gold coins.
Response:  We know that at Aaron has more than 5 costly things than Raymond and less than 2 costly things than him. So, if Aaron has x costly things, then Raymond has x - 5 costly things. Now we are told that Sion has fewer costly things than Raymond, so Sion has x - 10 costly things (since he has 10 fewer costly things than Raymond). Therefore, Sion has 30 costly things (x = 30).
Response:  Mike played for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, he scored an average of 0.83 points per minute (4/40). In the second 20 minutes, he scored 1.25 times more than his previous score, which means he scored 0.96 points per minute (4 x 1.25 = 5) during this period. So, in total, Mike scored 0.83 + 0.96 = 1.79 points over 40 minutes.
Response:  Terry eats two yogurts per day, so he spends $8.00 per day on yogurt (2 x $4.00).  Therefore, over 30 days, Terry spends a total of $240.00 ($8.00/day x 30 days) on yogurt.
Response:  John has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each, so he gets $195 from that ($13 x 15 = $195). Then, he buys 8 video games at $20 each, which costs him $160 ($20 x 8 = $160). So, after buying the video games, he is left with $35 ($195 - $160 = $35). Therefore, he still has 13 Lego sets.
Response:  First day: John runs for 3 hours = 3/6 \* 100 km/week = 50 km/week Second day: John runs for (2 x 3/6) \* 100 km/week = 40 km/week Third day: John runs for 3/6 \* 100 km/week = 20 km/week Therefore, John runs at a speed of 50 km/week on the first day, 40 km/week on the second day and 20 km/week on the third day.
Response:  We know that Denmark can run four times faster than it walks and jump twice as fast as it runs. So if Denmark can run at a speed of x miles per hour, it can walk at a speed of 4x miles per hour and jump at a speed of 2x miles per hour.  Now we are given that Denmark can jump at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many miles Denmark can cover in six hours, we need to use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance is 6 hours, so we can plug in the values we have found: Distance = (3 miles/hour) x (6 hours) = 18 miles.  However, we also know that Denmark spends one-third of its time running and two-thirds of its time walking. This means that for every hour Denmark spends running, it spends two hours walking. So the total time Denmark spends traveling is: Total Time = Running Time + Walking Time = (1/3) x 6 hours + (2/3) x 6 hours = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.  Therefore, Denmark can cover a total distance of 18 miles in 8 hours.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:  iPhone Ben is twice as old as iPhone Sue. iPhone Sue is one year older than iPhone Brandon. iPhone Brandon is four times older than iPhone Ben. So, if iPhone Brandon is 4 times older than iPhone Ben, and iPhone Ben is twice as old as iPhone Sue, then iPhone Brandon is also 8 times older than iPhone Sue. Therefore, iPhone Brandon is 8 years older than iPhone Sue.
Response:  Firstly, we know that when Polly holds the sapphire stone, she can throw the spear 3 times farther than usual. So if she throws it at a distance of 400 feet without holding the stone, then with the stone, she can throw it at a maximum distance of 1200 feet (3 x 400 = 1200).  Now, let's consider how far away from the dragon's flame Polly needs to be in order not to get burned. We are told that the dragon's flame can reach an area within a radius of 1000 feet. Therefore, any point outside this radius is safe from the flames. Since Polly wants to hit the dragon with her spear, she must stand at a distance greater than or equal to the radius of the dragon's flame plus the length of her throwing arm. Let's call this distance 'd'. Then, we have the following inequality: d >= 1000 + (Polly's throwing arm length) Substituting the value for 'd' from above and simplifying, we get: d >= 1000 + (Polly's throwing arm length) Now, we need to find out how long Polly's throwing arm is. According to the problem statement, when Polly holds the gold spear, she can throw it at a distance of 400 feet. This means that Polly's throwing arm is half as long as her throwing distance. So, Polly's throwing arm length is half of 400 = 200 feet. Plugging this value back into the previous equation, we get: d >= 1000 + 200 = 1200 feet Finally, since Polly cannot stand closer than 1000 feet to the dragon's flame without getting burned, we have: d <= 1000 feet Solving both equations simultaneously gives us the solution: Polly can stand at a distance of up to 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the dragon's flame and still hit it with her golden spear.
Response:  We know that Babushka Jones prepared 5 jberry pie for lunch and she cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, in total, there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie. Since after guests took their share, there were 14 remaining pieces, we can conclude that guests took 40 - 14 = 26 pieces of pie. Therefore, the answer is 26.
Response:  If we know that one serving of chips contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a 300-gram package, then...
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Charley can make 10 curved candles from one pound of beeswax. So if he sells each candle for $2, his total revenue will be:

Revenue = Number of candles x Price per candle
= 10 x $2
= $20

Now, we need to calculate Charley's profit. Profit is equal to revenue minus cost:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $20 - (Cost of beeswax + Cost of wick)
= $20 - ($10 + $0.5)
= $19.50

Therefore, Charley's clean profit will be $19.50 if he sells 20 candles."
Response:  On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles in total, and she spent 4 hours per article, so she spent 20 hours (5 x 4) writing on Monday.  On Tuesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Monday, which means she wrote 10 articles (2 x 5 = 10). Since each article takes her 4 hours to write, she spent 40 hours (10 x 4) writing on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, she wrote double the number of articles than she did on Tuesday, which means she wrote 20 articles (2 x 10 = 20). Again, each article takes her 4 hours to write, so she spent 80 hours (20 x 4) writing on Wednesday.  In total, Meredith spent 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 hours writing articles for her blog over those three days.
Response:  Kenny had 80 letters in her bag before going to work at the cafe. She stopped at a store and bought a pack of Post-its with 220 different coffee cups. So she used one Post-it per cup for a total of 220 Post-its. If she still has 23 letters left over, that means she used up all but 5 of the original 80 letters (since there are 23 + 5 = 28 letters left). Therefore, the number of letters in the original package is 80 - 5 = 75 letters.
Response:  John bought twice as many red scarves as blue ones. So, if he bought x blue scarves, he bought 2x red scarves. Since red scarves cost $1 more than blue ones, the total cost of red scarves is $1 + (2x) \* $40 = $80. Therefore, John spent $80 on red scarves.
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a stone with a length of 4 feet to support tomato plants in her garden. Since each piece was 6 inches long, we can calculate how many pieces she received as follows:

Number of pieces = Length of stone / Size of each piece
= 4 ft / 6 in
= 67 pieces (round up to nearest whole number)
Therefore, Tracy received 67 pieces of the rock."
Response:  We know that Richard lives in a building with 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. So, there are 15 x 8 = 120 apartments in total. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of empty apartments as follows: Number of empty apartments = Total number of apartments - Occupied apartments = 120 - (3/4) x 120 = 60 apartments Therefore, there are 60 empty apartments in the building where Richard lives.
Response:  If Lloyds chickens lay eggs at a rate of 252 per day and he sells them for $2 per dozen, then he makes $2 x 14 = $28 per week from egg sales alone.
Response:  At 1 hour, Tom's ship is moving at 10 miles per hour towards the west. Therefore, it has traveled 10 miles in one hour.  From 2 to 4 hours, the ship moves backward at 6 miles per hour, so it travels 6 x 2 = 12 miles backward during this time.  So, after 4 hours, the ship is 10 - 12 = -2 miles behind its original position.  Now, the ship starts moving forward again at 6 miles per hour, but in the opposite direction (east).  To find out how long it takes for the ship to return to its original position, we need to subtract the distance traveled east from the total distance traveled.  The distance traveled east is equal to the negative distance traveled west plus the initial distance traveled west.  Therefore, the time taken for the ship to return is: Time = Distance / Speed = (-2) + 10 = 8 hours.
Response:  If Uryu's backpack weighs 5 kg and he wants to reduce it by 5 kg, then he needs to remove 5 kg of weight from his backpack. Since each comic book weighs 1 kg, if he removes 30 comics (which is equal to 30 kg), then he will have reduced the weight of his backpack by 30/5 = 6 kg. Therefore, he still needs to remove an additional 9 kg (5 kg - 6 kg) from his backpack, which means he needs to get rid of 9 kg worth of items. Based on the options provided in the question, the only item that weighs 9 kg is the stuffed animals, so he needs to get rid of all of them to meet his goal.
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 tires for trucks and 4 tires for cars. So, he earned $6 x 6 = $36 in revenue from tire repair for trucks and $4 x 4 = $16 in revenue from tire repair for cars. Therefore, his total revenue on Thursday was $52 ($36 + $16).  Now let's move to Friday. The mechanic did not repair any tires for trucks but repaired 12 cars. So, he earned $40 x 12 = $480 in revenue from car tire repair on Friday. Therefore, his total revenue on Friday was $52 + $480 = $532.  Hence, the mechanic made more money on Friday with higher earnings from car tire repair than on Thursday with lower earnings from both types of tire repair.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:

* Сестри Дуафтфайр (Sister Duaftfire) have 7 kittens with them when they go home.
* Their mother calls to inform them that their two domestic cats (Patch and Trixie) recently had kittens.
* Patch's litter has triple the number of kittens as Trixie's litter.

Using these pieces of information, we can calculate the total number of kittens in Sister Duaftfire's family as follows:

Total number of kittens = Number of kittens with Sister Duaftfire + Number of kittens from Patch + Number of kittens from Trixie
= 7 + (3 x Triple the number of kittens from Trixie) + 12
= 7 + 9 + 12
= 38

Therefore, there are 38 kittens in Sister Duaftfire's family."
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 ice cream cones and he eats two of them. So now he has 30 - 2 = 28 ice cream cones left. He wants to package these into pairs, so we need to divide them equally among himself and Dijon. Since Dijon can only fit one cone in each sum, we need to divide 28 by 1 = 28 sums. Therefore, Dijon can fill 28 sums with ice cream.
Response:  Peter has $42 for the whole week. He always pays $7 for the ticket and $7 for popcorn. So he can go to the movies $6 times ($42 / $7 = 6).
"Response:  We know that the maximum weight of the bridge is 5000 pounds (lb). The load consists of boxes weighing 15 lb each and an empty truck with a total weight of 3755 lb. To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, we need to divide the total weight of the load by the weight of one box: Total weight = Load + Vehicle weight = 15 x Number of boxes + 3755 lb  Now, let's solve for ""Number of boxes"" : Number of boxes = Total weight / Weight of one box = 15 x Number of boxes + 3755 lb / 15 lb = 15 x Number of boxes + 256 Box  Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 256 boxes."
Response:  Firstly, Steve paid $40 for his product. Then, there was an additional charge of 25% which is equal to $10 (since it was through a supplier). So, the total amount he had to pay became $50 ($40 + $10). After that, there was another charge of $4 for delivery, making the final cost $54 ($50 + $4). Therefore, the final price of Steve’s products was $54.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 clusters of 20 fruits each and 67 individual fruits scattered across the bushes. So, in total, we have:

Clusters x Fruits per Cluster = 6 x 20 = 120 fruits
Individual Fruits = 67 fruits
Total number of plums = 120 + 67 = 187 plums
Therefore, there are 187 plums in total."
"Response:  We know that out of 25 apples in the basket:

* 1 apple is bad (25/25 = 1)
* 20% of the apples are not ripe (25/25 \* 20% = 5)
* 2 apples are sour (25/25 \* 2 = 5)

So, the number of good apples in the basket is:

25 - 1 - 5 + 5 = 14

Therefore, there are 14 good apples in the basket."
Response:  Firstly, Janet pays $500 for the brochure material. Then she pays $800 to the jeweler to build it. Finally, she pays $80 (10% of $800) as insurance. Therefore, in total, Janet has paid $660 ($500 + $800 - $80).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mars worked for 40 years in the same company and received an annual pension of $50,000 after retirement. Then she got a 5% increase in her pension amount every year for the next 10 years (from Year 21 to Year 30). So, her total pension amount at Year 30 would be: $50,000 x 1.05^10 = $875,000. Now, if she retired after working for 30 years, her annual pension amount would be: $875,000 / 10 = $87,500 per year. Therefore, Mars's annual pension after retiring after 30 years would be $87,500.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alena signed up for a streaming service that charged her $140 per month.  Then, the company sent her an invoice for the first half of the year, which was $70. So, the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is $70 + $140 = $210.
Response:  We know that Sofia has traveled 160 kilometers since her last refueling and needs to fill up with 4 gallons of gasoline. The fuel tank capacity of her car is 12 gallons (according to the manual). So, we can calculate how far she can travel on one full tank as follows: Distance = Fuel capacity x Speed  Distance = 12 gallons x 160 km/h = 1920 km (or approximately 1197 miles) Therefore, Sofia can travel approximately 1197 miles on one full tank of gasoline.
Response:  Firstly, Jim spends 2 hours in front of the TV and then decides to go to bed and read for half as much time. So, he reads for 1 hour. Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends in front of the TV over 4 weeks:  Week 1: 2 hours/day x 7 days = 14 hours Week 2: 1 hour/day x 7 days = 7 hours Week 3: 1 hour/day x 7 days = 7 hours Week 4: 1 hour/day x 7 days = 7 hours Total hours spent in front of the TV = 58 hours Therefore, Jim spends 58 hours in front of the TV over 4 weeks.
"Response:  We know that there are four schools participating in the basketball tournament. Each school has sent teams of boys and girls, so we have:
Boys: 4 schools x 5 players per team = 20 players
Girls: 4 schools x 5 players per team = 20 players
Total number of people from all schools: 20 + 20 = 40 people
Therefore, the answer is 40."
Response:  We know that there were 175 alm...
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls at school. So, if there are x girls, then there are 2x boys.
We also know that each teacher has 60 girls and 5 boys. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:

Number of teachers = (2x) \* 60 + 5

Now we need to solve for x, which is the number of girls in the school. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 60:

Number of teachers / 60 = 2x

Now we have a simple proportion:

2x = 60

Solving for x, we get:

x = 30

So, there are 30 girls in the school. And since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are 60 boys in the school as well."
Response:  Bailie starts with some initial amount of money (not specified in the problem). Then she receives weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, if she has $100, then she started with $95 ($100 - $5 x 8).
"Response: 

Judy teaches 5 classes of dance per day (M-F), each with 15 students = 75 students/day
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday (Sat) = 8 x 15 = 120 students/Sat
Total number of students Judy teaches in a week = Total number of days in a week x Number of students per class
= 7 x 75 + 8 x 120 = 560 + 960 = 1520 students/week
Since Judy charges $15 per student, her total weekly income from teaching = Total number of students taught x Price per student
= 1520 x $15 = $23,300/week"
Response:  If Kelian has two recipes with different numbers of instructions: Recipe 1 has 20 instructions and Recipe 2 has twice as many instructions (i.e., 40 instructions). To prepare both dishes, Kelian needs to read a total of 60 instructions (20 + 40 = 60). Therefore, the answer is 60.
Response:  Tommy sells brony for $3 per piece and cheesecake for $4 per piece. If he sells 43 pieces of brony, he will make $132 ($3 x 43). Similarly, if he sells 23 pieces of cheesecake, he will make $92 ($4 x 23). Therefore, in total, Tommy will make $224 ($132 + $92).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Shiela bought five mobile phones at $150 each, which is equal to $750 in total. Then, she will pay 2% interest per month for three months, which means she will pay an additional amount of money every month. So, her total payment for those three months can be calculated as follows: Total payment = Initial cost + Interest paid over time = $750 + (Interest rate x Time) = $750 + (2% x 3 months) = $750 + $6 = $806 Now, we need to calculate how much Shiela will pay every month. To do this, we divide the total payment by the number of months: Monthly payment = Total payment / Number of months = $806 / 3 months = $268.42 Therefore, Shiela will pay $268.42 every month for three months.
Response:  If Arty sells $12$ bunches of narcissus (at $2.74$ per bunch), he will make $33.04$.  If he sells $9$ bunches of petunia ($1.87$ per bunch), he will make $16.53$.  And if he sells $17$ bunches of begonia ($2.12$ per bunch), he will make $35.34$.  Therefore, in total, Arty will make $33.04 + 16.53 + 35.34 = 85.91$.
Response:  Since each level of the sandcastle has half the area of the previous level, we can write an equation to represent this relationship: Area of current level = (Half) x Area of previous level Where H is the height of the castle and A is the area of the castle at any given level. Now, we are told that the top level of the castle has an area of 16 square feet. So, if we want to find out what was the area of the bottom level, we can use the fact that the total area of all levels is equal to the area of the top level multiplied by the number of levels: Total area = Area of top level x Number of levels Therefore, we have: Total area = 16 x Number of levels Now, we know that the height of the castle is 4 levels, so we can substitute this value in the first equation: Half x Area of previous level = Area of current level Substituting the values, we get: Half x (Area of previous level) = 16 x 4 Area of previous level = 64 Area of previous level = 8 square feet Therefore, the area of the bottom level of the sandcastle is 8 square feet.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Sesi...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.

According to the problem statement, Sesilia is supposed to feed her puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, and then 2 cups per day until the end of its life.

If one package of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to find out how many packages Sesilia will use in the first year.

So, let's calculate the number of cups of dog food Sesilia will use in the first year:

First 180 days = 180 x 1 cup/day = 180 cups/day
Additional time = 365 - 180 = 185 days
Total cups used = 185 x 2 cups/day = 370 cups/day

Now, we know that Sesilia needs to use 370 cups of dog food every day during the first year. Since one package contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food needed by the amount in each package to find out how many packages she will use:

Number of packages = Total cups / Cups per package
= 370 / 110
= 3.4 packages/day

Therefore, Sesilia will use approximately 3.4 packages of dog food per day in the first year."
Response:  We know that Raymond works twice less than Sarah and Sarah is four times more productive than David. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then she would do 4 x 400 = 1600 pounds of laundry in total. Since Raymond works half as much as Sarah, he would do 1/2 x 1600 = 800 pounds of laundry. And David doesn't work at all, so he wouldn't do any laundry. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 800 - 0 = 800 pounds.
Response:  If Vince buys three bunches of flowers for $2.50 each, he will spend $7.50. If he buys two bunches for $1 each, he will spend $2. So in total, he will spend $9.50. Therefore, he will save $8.50 ($9.50 - $7.50) by buying all 18 bunches together at the better price.
Response:  Firstly, John pays $100 for the dog's care. Then, Grimer offers him a discount of 30%, which means that John will pay only $70 ($100 x 30%) for the next month. So, the cost of the dog's care for one month is $70.
Response:  Two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water = 4 liters (since 24 / 6 = 4). Then, the boy received 6 liters more = 6 + 4 = 10 liters. So, there are 24 - 10 = 14 liters left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charley had 10 stickers initially. Then he bought 21 more stickers in the shop at the mall and received 23 additional stickers as a gift for his birthday. So far, Charley has 44 stickers (10 + 21 + 23). Next, he gave away 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 35 stickers (44 - 9 = 35). Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate his greeting card, which means he now has 6 stickers left (35 - 28 = 6). Therefore, there are 6 stickers remaining with Charley.
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs less than 125 pounds by 2 pounds. So, Alex's weight is between 123 pounds (twice as much as 61 pounds) and 125 pounds. Therefore, their combined weight is between 248 pounds (Grace + Alex) and 270 pounds (four times Grace). Since it cannot be greater than four times Grace, the correct answer is 252 pounds (Grace + Alex).
Response:  Den has planted three trojan tree bushes. In each trojan tree bush, there are 25 trojans. Each trojan has 8 terms. Therefore, the total number of terms is: 3 x 25 = 75 trojans.
"Response:  We know that the team played 22 games and won more times than they lost. So we can write an equation: Won = Lost + 1 (since they won one game more than they lost). Now we have to solve for ""Won"". Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Won = 8 + 1 = 9. Therefore, the team won 9 games out of 22."
"Response:  Since he has been going on vacation four times a year since he was 23 years old (now he is 34), and each time he gets a new sock, we can calculate how many socks he has in total as follows:

1. First year (age 23): He goes on vacation 4 times = 4 socks
2. Second year (age 24): He goes on vacation 4 times = 8 socks (since he already had 4 from the previous year)
3. Third year (age 25): He goes on vacation 4 times = 16 socks (since he already had 8 from the previous two years)
4. Fourth year (age 26): He goes on vacation 4 times = 20 socks (since he already had 16 from the previous three years)
5. Fifth year (age 27): He goes on vacation 4 times = 24 socks (since he already had 20 from the previous four years)
6. Sixth year (age 28): He goes on vacation 4 times = 28 socks (since he already had 24 from the previous five years)
7. Seventh year (age 29): He goes on vacation 4 times = 32 socks (since he already had 28 from the previous six years)
8. Eighth year (age 30): He goes on vacation 4 times = 36 socks (since he already had 32 from the previous seven years)
9. Ninth year (age 31): He goes on vacation 4 times = 40 socks (since he already had 36 from the previous eight years)
10. Tenth year (age 32): He goes on vacation 4 times = 44 socks (since he already had 40 from the previous nine years)
11. Eleventh year (age 33): He goes on vacation 4 times = 48 socks (since he already had 44 from the previous ten years)
12. Twelfth year (age 34): He goes on vacation 4 times = 5"
Response:  When Greg set the alarm to ring three times per day as a reminder, it rang once today (first time). Therefore, the number of rings for the first time = 1.  When it rang the second time, it rang three times longer than the first time, so the number of rings for the second time = 3 + 1 = 4.  When it rang the third time, it rang half the time of the second time, so the number of rings for the third time = 4 / 2 = 2.  Therefore, the total number of times the alarm rang = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7.
Response:  First year (year 1): $600/month x 12 months = $7,200/year Second year (year 2): $840/month x 12 months = $9,600/year Third year (year 3): $960/month x 12 months = $11,520/year Fourth year (year 4): $1,080/month x 12 months = $12,960/year Fifth year (year 5): $1,200/month x 12 months = $14,400/year Total amount earned in 5 years: $7,200 + $9,600 + $11,520 + $12,960 + $14,400 = $61,480 So Sylvie's annual salary after 5 years of service is $61,480.
Response:  We know that Marylin sold her album 10 times more than Harald. So if Marylin sold 88,000 copies of her album, then Harald sold 88,000 / 10 = 8,800 copies of his album. Therefore, Ha ralld sold 8,800 copies of his album.
Response:  We know that Christina invited 16 friends to the party and she needs 75 gift bags for them. Since 1/4 of the guests will not come (4 out of 16), we need to calculate how many gift bags she actually needs. So, the number of gift bags needed = Number of guests x Percentage of non-attending guests = 16 x 0.25 = 4. Therefore, Christina will spend $8 on gift bags ($2 per bag x 4 bags).
Response:  We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of salad (4.5 kg), and a child will eat half of what the adult eats (i.e., 4.5 kg / 2 = 2.25 kg). So, in total, we need 6.75 kilograms of salad to feed all 25 people at the picnic (20 adults x 4.5 kg + 5 children x 2.25 kg = 6.75 kg).
"Response:  We know that:

* Ян has more than three pets (he has ""утричі більше"").
* Marsia has two pets more than Sindy (she has ""двох домашніх тваrin більше"").
* Sindy has four pets.

So we can write an equation based on this information:

Jane = 3 + x
Marsia = 2 + 4 = 6
Sindy = 4

Now we need to find out what value of 'x' satisfies all these equations. In other words, how many pets does Jane have if Marsia has six pets and Sindy has four pets?

Solving for 'x', we get:

Jane = 3 + x = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Jane has ten pets in total."
"Response:  We know that Emily has four children named Emily (the mother), Jackson, Corey, and James.  Emily is 5 years older than Jackson, and 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, we can write:
Emily - Jackson = 5
Jackson - Corey = 2
We also know that James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey. So we can write:
James - Corey = 1
Now let's solve for Jackson's age:
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
Emily - Jackson = 5
Jackson - Corey = 2
Jackson = Corey + 2
Jackson = 12 + 2
Jackson = 14
Therefore, Jackson is 14 years old."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Li can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, which means he has an average speed of:

Speed = Distance / Time = 400 m / 38 s = 10.5 m/s

Now, since Jeff changed his diet and improved his speed by 10%, his new average speed for running 400 meters without obstacles would be:

New Speed = Old Speed x (1 + Percentage Increase) = 10.5 m/s x (1 + 10%) = 11.65 m/s

Therefore, if Jeff runs 400 meters without obstacles in 38 seconds, his time would be:

Time = Distance / New Speed = 400 m / 11.65 m/s = 34.27 seconds"
Response:  We know that there are fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined. So, if we have x dogs and y cats, then the total number of animals in the neighborhood is less than or equal to x + y. Since there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, we can write an equation as follows: x + y = 60 + (12 - x). Substituting the value of y from the problem statement, we get: x + 3 = 60. Solving for x, we find that there are 57 dogs and 3 cats in the neighborhood.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in total, 50 are boys and 150 are girls.  Out of these girls, 2/5 or 40 are scouts. So, the number of girls who are not in the scouts is 150 - 40 = 110. Therefore, there are 110 girls who are not in the scouts.
Response:  We know that G arry slept for 9 hours and James slept for 2/3 of Harry's time. So, if we convert 2/3 to a decimal, it is equal to 0.67 or 67%. Therefore, Harry slept for 9 x 1.67 = 15.33 hours more than James.
Response:  We know that when Freda cooks canned peppers in sauce, they lose half their volume. So if she uses three canned peppers (each containing 3 po
"Response:  At first, there were 30 cars on the highway, and some of them passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes. Let's assume that 5 cars left the line to avoid driving through the traffic jam. So, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes is:

Number of cars passing through = Total number of cars - Number of cars leaving the line
= 30 - 5
= 25

Now, let's consider the last 15 minutes. During this time, an additional 20 cars passed through the traffic jam. Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the entire 30-minute period is:

Total number of cars passing through = Number of cars passing through during the first 15 minutes + Number of cars passing through during the last 15 minutes
= 25 + 20
= 45

So, there were 45 cars that passed through the traffic jam in the entire 30-minute period."
Response:  Mary has already 2 plants per window in her big country house (40 windows x 2 plants/window = 80 plants).  She received 18 new seedlings yesterday and wants to give one plant each to friends and relatives tomorrow (18 plants / 1 person = 18 plants). So, after giving away plants, Mary will have 62 plants left (80 - 18 = 62).
Response:  First friend pressed the button 20 times before Jerome opened the door. So, the total number of presses made by the first and second friends is: 20 + (1/4) \* 20 = 35 presses. Now, the third friend pressed the button 10 times more than the second friend, so he pressed it 35 x 1.5 = 52 times. Finally, the fourth friend pressed the button 60 times, so the total number of presses made by all four friends is: 52 + 60 = 112 presses.
Response:  We know that Solo has already read 15 pages in Monday and he has 3 more days to finish reading all the required pages. So, we can calculate how many pages he needs to read per day as follows: Total number of pages = Number of pages in science + Number of pages in social studies + Number of pages in history + Number of pages in geography Total number of pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages per day To find out how many pages Solo needs to read each day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days he has left: Number of pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days remaining = 49 / 3 = 16 pages per day Therefore, Solo needs to read 16 pages per day to finish reading all the required pages within 3 days.
Response:  John drinks water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day, so he pints 3 x 21 = 63 sklans of water per day. Since he also drinks soda with his evening meal on weekends, we need to add that amount as well. Therefore, John drinks a total of 63 + (2 x 7) = 85 sklans of water per week.
Response:  We know that to cover each 3 miles of city with fog takes 10 minutes. So, it will take 10 x 3 = 30 minutes to cover 1/3 of the city. Therefore, to cover the entire city, we need to multiply the time taken to cover one-third of the city by 3, which gives us 90 minutes (or 1 hour and 50 minutes).
Response:  Popi has already placed one quarter of the puzzle pieces (1000/4 = 250) on the board. Then her mom places another third of the remaining pieces (300). So, in total, there are now 250 + 300 = 550 pieces left to solve. Therefore, the final number of pieces that will be solved is 550.

Response:  First, we need to find out the volume of each box. The length, width, and height are given as follows: Length = 5 in, Width = 6 in, Height = 4 in. Volume of one box = Length x Width x Height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches. Since there are three boxes, the total volume of all the boxes is 120 x 3 = 360 cubic inches.
"Response: 
Franky watched TV after finishing his homework every evening from Monday to Wednesday for 1 hour each night. So, he watched 3 hours of TV in total from Monday to Wednesday.
On Thursday, Franky finished his homework earlier and watched a 1-hour episode and 30 minutes of a show. So, he watched a total of 1.5 hours of TV on Thursday.
On Friday, Franky had a day off and watched 2 1-hour episodes. So, he watched a total of 2 hours of TV on Friday.
Therefore, if Franky watched TV for 7 hours in total, then he must have watched 3 x 1 = 3 30-minute episodes of the show in serendipity."
"Response:  Last year, Henrey made $2 more than he did the previous year. So if he made x peanut butter cookies last year, then this year he will make $x + 2 peanut butter cookies.  Since he has 110 peanut butter cookies now and wants to double his profit from last year, we can set up the equation:

$x + 2 = 110... (1)

Now we need to solve for $x$. To do that, we can subtract $2 from both sides of Equation $(1)$:

$x = 108... (2)$

So Henrey made 108 peanut butter cookies last year."
"Response:  If the local gas station sells gas for $3.00 per gallon and the company offers a discount of $20 per gallon if you fill up at that station, then we can calculate how much gas each person will get after the discount as follows:

Gas price = $3.00 per gallon
Discount amount = $20 per gallon
Number of gallons purchased = x (where x is the number of gallons bought)
Total cost of gas before discount = Gas price x Number of gallons purchased
Total cost of gas after discount = Discount amount x Number of gallons purchased

Now, let's assume someone buys 10 gallons of gas. We can plug these values into the equations to find out how much gas they will get after the discount:

Total cost of gas before discount = $3.00 x 10 gallons = $30.00
Total cost of gas after discount = $20.00 x 10 gallons = $200.00

So, after the discount, this person will get an additional 17 gallons of gas ($200 - $30)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Beatrice was wider than Marcel and had more length. So, if they both ate all their fruit roll-ups, Beatrice would have eaten $ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16$ fruit roll-ups in total, while Marcel would have eaten $\frac{3}{3} \times 14 = 9$ fruit roll-ups in total$.$ Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups each person ate is: $$ \frac{16 + 9}{2} = 8$$  So, they both ate $8$ fruit roll-ups in total.
Response:  We know that Julia took 16 seconds to swim 20 feet and that she needed 64 seconds to reach the shore. So, if we divide the time it took her to swim 20 feet (16 seconds) by the distance she swam (20 feet), we get: Time = Distance / Speed = 16 s / 20 ft = 0.8 ml/ft Julia also said that her boat was taking in two liters of water for every ten feet it traveled back towards the shore. Since she traveled 64 seconds to reach the shore, and there are 20 feet in each of those 64 seconds, we can calculate how much water her boat took in during that time as follows: Water taken in = Volume per second x Time = 2 l/10 ft x 64 s = 1280 liters Of course, this is just an estimate based on the information given in the problem statement. In reality, the volume of water taken in might be different due to various factors such as the shape of the boat or the speed at which it was traveling.
Response:  Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons per day, the total number of lessons is 8 (4 x 2).  If the blackboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, then the total number of times the blackboard is cleaned in one day is 8 x 3 = 24. Therefore, the blackboard is cleaned 24 times per day.
Response:  Ryan plants 2 flowers per day in his garden for 15 days. Therefore, he will have planted a total of 2 x 15 = 30 flowers in his garden. Since 5 of them did not grow, there will be 30 - 5 = 25 flowers left in his garden after 15 days.
"Response:  We know that the telephone Jamal can hold 1800 photos and the maximum number of photos Bretti can take is 50 times more than the number of birds in a photo with ducks at the zoo. Therefore, we have:

Number of photos taken by Bretti = 50 x Number of birds in a photo with ducks at the zoo

We also know that there are 3 birds in each photo with ducks at the zoo. So, we can write:

Number of photos taken by Bretti = 50 x 3

Now, let's substitute the value for the number of photos taken by Bretti into the equation for the total number of photos held by Jamal:

Total number of photos held by Jamal = Number of photos taken by Bretti + Maximum number of photos that Jamal can hold - Photos taken by Bretti

Substituting the values, we get:

Total number of photos held by Jamal = 50 x 3 + 1800 - 1800

Simplifying and solving for the number of birds in a photo with ducks at the zoo, we get:

Number of birds in a photo with ducks at the zoo = 1800 / (50 x 3)
= 1800 / 150
= 12
Therefore, there are 12 birds in each photo with ducks at the zoo."

Response:  Ketti uses 7 чайних ложек цукру and 13 чашек води for every one cup of coffee she makes. So if she made x cups of coffee, she used 7x и 13x чайних ложек цукру and чашек води respectively. Since she inhaled 120 чайних ложек цукру and чашек води altogether, we can set up the equation:  7x + 13x = 120. Simplifying the equation, we get:  20x = 120. Dividing both sides by 20, we find that Ketti consumed 6 cups of coffee (since 1 cup is equal to 8 оz). Therefore, she consumed 6 x 7 = 42 чайних ложек цукру and 6 x 13 = 78 чашек води.
Response:  John bought two pairs of shoes for each of his three children. So, he bought a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John paid a total of 6 x $60 = $360.
Response:  On day one, there were two containers with 5 cars each, so total number of cars was 10 (2 x 5).  Next day, they brought more containers and total number of cars increased to 30. So, number of containers imported on second day = Total number of cars - Number of cars on first day = 30 - 10 = 20.
Response:  Four years ago, Adrien made $40000 and his salary increased by 30%. So, his current salary is:  $40000 x (1 + 0.3) = $56000.  Now, Lailey's original salary was lower than Adrien's by 30%, so his original salary was:  $56000 / 0.7 = $80000.  After four years, both of their salaries increased by 40%. So, Adrien's new salary is:  $56000 x (1 + 0.4) = $79200. And Lailey's new salary is:  $80000 x (1 + 0.4) = $112000. Therefore, the total amount of money that both Adrien and Lailey received in the last four years is:  $79200 + $112000 = $191200.
Response:  Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week for his drawing. Therefore, he uses 2 x 4 = 8 sheets of paper per month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he uses 8/4 = 2 sheets of paper per week. So, Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she has a total of 13 fruits (5 + 8 = 13).  Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 \* 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half as many oranges as Morisette, which means he brought 5 / 2 = 2.5 oranges. So, in total, Kael brought 10 + 2.5 = 12.5 fruits.
Response:  On Monday, Seidi slept for 8 hours. Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept for 6 hours each day (2 hours less than Monday). Therefore, in total, Seidi slept for 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours during those three days. Now, if she slept for 1 hour more than in those three days combined, that means she slept for 20 + 1 = 21 hours during the entire week.
Response:  Rosi can run for 3 hours at a rate of 10 miles per hour, which means she has covered 3 x 10 = 30 miles in that time. Then, she slows down to 5 miles per hour and runs for another 7 hours. In this case, she covers 7 x 5 = 35 miles. Therefore, Rosi can cover a total distance of 30 + 35 = 65 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  Jenny helps in her mom's office and has 60 letters that need stamps. She puts marks on one-third of these letters, which means she stamps 20 letters (since 1/3 x 60 = 20). So, there were originally 40 letters without stamps (60 - 20 = 40).
Response:  We know that Djuilia had 3 lozhek when she was eating gulash and later she had 12 lozhki after she finished her meal. So, we can calculate how many lozhki were in the package that Julia bought as follows:  Number of lozhki in the package = Total number of lozhki used - Number of lozhki used by Julia = 12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, there were 9 lozhki in the package that Julia bought.
Response:  We know that Dilan needed beef sausages and fish sausages to prepare the party dishes. He bought more fish sausages than beef sausages. So, he bought 38 beef sausages and 6 fish sausages more than beef sausages. Therefore, Dilan bought 38 + 6 = 44 sausages in total.
Response:  After Emi transferred to a new school, she had 20 more friends than Lily. So, Emi has 20 + 5 = 25 friends.  Then, Lily found 50 new friends. Therefore, the total number of friends that both Emi and Lily have together is 25 + 50 = 75 friends.
Response:  Maty Velda sells coffee beans, peppers, and oranges in the local store. The price of each bean is three times that of each pepper. A portocal costs $5 less than an arbuz. Dilona goes to the market to buy 4 arbuzes, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much will he spend if each pepper costs $15?  We know that the cost of one bean is three times that of a pepper, so the cost of one bean is $45 ($3 x $15). Therefore, the total cost of 4 arbuzes = $45 x 4 = $180. Similarly, the total cost of 20 peppers = $15 x 20 = $300. Finally, the total cost of 10 oranges = $15 x 10 = $150. So, Dilona will spend a total of $630 ($180 + $300 + $150) to buy 4 arbuzes, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges if each pepper costs $15.
"Response:  We know that there are 500 people who visit the hospital every day and each patient spends an average of 24 minutes at the hospital. Therefore, the total time spent at the hospital per day is:

Time = Number of visitors x Average time per visitor
= 500 x 24
= 12,000 minutes

Now we need to calculate how much money the doctors earn from these visits. Since the doctors charge $150 per hour, they earn:

Doctor income = Total time spent at the hospital x Doctor rate per minute
= 12,000 x $150
= $180,000 per day

Next, we need to calculate how much money the hospital receives from these visits. Since the hospital charges patients $200 per hour, it receives:

Hospital income = Total time spent at the hospital x Hospital rate per minute
= 12,000 x $200
= $240,000 per day

Therefore, the hospital receives $240,000 per day and the doctors receive $180,000 per day from these visits."
Response:  First, we are told that Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store in the village of Santy. Then, we learn that one-third (30) of these elves stop playing when children start staring at them, and another 10 elves stop playing when children hit them on their legs. Therefore, there are 50 elves left after both groups have stopped playing.
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500.  In June, he spent $440 less than in May (since his expenses were $60 less). So, in total, Joseph spent: $$500 + ($440 - $60) = $520$$ Therefore, Joseph spent $520 in May and June combined.
"Response:  Firstly, Pam and Fred went to the carnival together. Then, Pam went up the mountain twice, while Fred went four times. After that, each of them decided to go sledding twice. Therefore, the total number of trips they took was:
Pam: 2 + 2 = 4 trips
Fred: 4 + 4 = 8 trips
Now, let's calculate how many tickets they used for each trip:
Pam: Each trip cost $6, so she used $6 x 4 = $24 in tickets.
Fred: Each trip cost $6, so he used $6 x 8 = $48 in tickets.
Therefore, the total amount of money they spent on tickets was:
$24 (Pam) + $48 (Fred) = $72."
Response:  On Monday, Waldo ran 4 miles.  On Tuesday, he ran 6 times more than on Monday, so he ran 4 x 6 = 24 miles. Therefore, his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.
Response:  Tom gets 4 cars per month, so he pays for 4 x 12 = 48 automobile washes per year. Since each car wash costs $15, Tom pays $48 x 12 = $576 per year for all his cars. Therefore, he pays $576 per year.
Response:  We know that Brain has 20 video games and Brian has 5 times more than Brain, which means Brian has 20 x 5 = 100 video games.  Since Brain had 20 video games before he lost 5, now Brain has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. So, the number of video games Bob has is 100 - 15 = 85 video games.
"Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in the world and that one-third of them are located in Scotland. Therefore, we can calculate how many Scottish unicorns there are as follows:

Number of Scottish unicorns = Number of unicorns x Fraction of unicorns in Scotland
= 27 x (1/3)
= 9

Since two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are females, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = Number of Scottish unicorns x Proportion of females among Scottish unicorns
= 9 x (2/3)
= 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
Response:  Firstly, Rori orders two underground drives for $7.50 each, and then she buys two bags of chips for $1.50 each. Next, she purchases two pies for $1.00 each. Finally, she adds $5.00 to pay for the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost. Therefore, her order will cost: $7.50 x 2 + $1.50 x 2 + $1.00 x 2 = $34.00 + $20.00 = $54.00.
Response:  First test had 75 questions and he finished it in 8 hours, so he answered 75/8 = 9 questions per hour.  Second test had 100 questions and he finished it in 6 hours, so he answered 100/6 = 16.67 questions per hour. Since he didn't finish all the questions of both tests, we can calculate the number of unanswered questions as follows: Unanswered questions from first test = (75 - 9) = 66 questions left unanswered. Unanswered questions from second test = (100 - 16.67) = 83.33 questions left unanswered. Therefore, there were 66 + 83.33 = 149.33 questions left unfinished by Mark.
Response:  We know that there are 4 times more pink candies than blue ones in the machine for lollipops. So if there are 12 blue candies, then there are 48 pink candies (since 4 x 12 = 48).
Response:  We know that out of 20 machines available for rent, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the remaining 4 are semi-automatic. To find the percentage of semi-automatic vehicles, we can multiply the number of semi-automatic vehicles (4) by 100 / total number of vehicles (20). So, the percentage of semi-automatic vehicles is 4 x 100 / 20 = 20%. Therefore, 20% of the automobiles are semi-automatic.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total.  Since there are twice as many worker bees as queen bees, we can say that there are 2 x 140 = 280 worker bees. And since there are also twice as many pebble-like bees as worker bees, we can say that there are 2 x 280 = 560 pebble-like bees. Therefore, there are 560 pebble-like bees for every 280 worker bees, or 2 pebble-like bees per worker bee.
"Response:  If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day and works for only a short time, he will earn $10/hour at work. So, his total daily income is:

$2/hour x 2 hours = $4/day (from gaming) + $10/hour x number of working hours = $10/day (from work)

Since there are 7 days in a week, Jordan's total weekly income from both sources would be:

$4/day x 7 days = $28 (from gaming) + $10/day x 7 days = $70 (from work)

So, Jordan would have earned a total of $98 ($28 from gaming + $70 from work) during the week."
Response:  Firstly, John bought milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and tarantula food for $4. So, the total cost of these items is: $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $16. Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax on the total cost: $16 x 10% = $1.6. Therefore, the final cost of all the items is $16 + $1.6 = $17.6.
Response:  Kim has already made $3 in revenue from his first three clients and is expecting to make an additional $85 per week from the five potential clients he is currently negotiating with. Each client will require two bottles of milk and a pack of cleaning supplies, which cost a total of $10. Therefore, Kim's total revenue for the week will be $92 ($85 + $10). Since his expenses are only $10, his profit for the week will be $82 ($92 - $10). So, Kim will make $82 per week in profit.
Response:  John has 10 hectares of land with bananas. On each hectare, there are 100 bananas. John can harvest bananas every 3 months. So, in one year, John can harvest bananas for 4 times (3 months/year x 4 years/year). Therefore, John can gather 400 bananas per year (100 bananas/hectare x 4 times/year).
Response:  We know that John collects toys from the floor of his room. He threw away a box with 500 Lego pieces and another one with three times as many pieces as the first (so 1500 pieces). Additionally, he threw away a box with 1/4 of the number of pieces as the second box (so 375 pieces). Therefore, in total, John collected 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 pieces of Legos.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 30 bees left the hive during the first 6 hours (Debra saw this). Then, half of them returned within the next 6 hours ( Debra also saw this). So, the number of bees that returned = 30 / 2 = 15. Now, let's consider the remaining bees that didn't return yet. Since Debra saw twice as many bees leaving the hive than returning, the number of bees that didn't return = 2 x 15 = 30. Therefore, the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15 + 30 = 45.
Response:  Brittany and her mom go to the museum. The cost of admission for adults is $12, and for children it is $10. Her mom gives the cashier $10 in exchange for one child ticket and one adult ticket. If she received $8 in change, how much money did she give the cashier?  We can set up an equation using this information:  Mom gave $10 to the cashier = $8 in change  So, the amount of money that Mom gave the cashier is $10 - $8 = $2.
Response:  We know that Charley has three times as many friends on Facebok as Dorothy and James combined. So if Charley has x friends on Facebook, then Dorothy has 3x/4 = 75% of x friends, and James has 4x/3 = 133% of x friends. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + (3(75% of x)) + (4(133% of x)) = 12  Solving for x, we get:  x = 108  Therefore, James has 108 friends on Facebook.
Response:  STEVE (Стив) lives 3 miles away from school and can ride his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. TIM (Тим) lives 2 miles away from school and can skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take for Steve to reach home after Tim finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both of them to cover their respective distances. For Steve, the distance is 3 miles = 3 x 5280 = 15920 feet. Since he rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet/minute, it will take him 15920 / 440 = 35 minutes to cover this distance. Now, let's check how much time Tim has left after finishing the race. He lives 2 miles away from school, which means that he still needs to cover 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet. If he skates at a speed of 264 feet/minute, it will take him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes to cover this distance. So, if Tim finishes the race in 40 minutes, Steve will take 35 minutes to reach home after Tim finishes the race. Therefore, the winner will be waiting at home for approximately 85 minutes (35 + 40).
Response: 1. First day (5 people x $0.25 per tire = $1.25) + (3 people x $0.75 per tire = $2.25) = $3.50 total for first day. 2. Next day (1 person x $0.25 per tire = $0.25). Total = $3.75. So, she made $3.75 that day.
Response:  We know that Carl buys ten packets of cookies and each packet contains six cookies. So, in total, he buys 60 cookies (10 packets x 6 cookies/packet). Now we need to calculate how much money Carl pays for all these cookies. Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl pays a total of $6.00 for all the cookies ($0.10 x 60 cookies). Therefore, the answer is $6.00.
Response:  When Dave bought the package of fries, there were 14 fries in it.  Then, the seagull stole half of them (7), leaving 7 fries.  The three pigeons took turns eating 3 fries each (9 total).  Finally, the squirrel took two-thirds of the remaining fries (5). Therefore, when Dave bought the package of fries, there were 14 fries in it.
Response:  We know that Kimo has three one-hour classes every day from Monday to Friday. Therefore, he spends 3 x 7 = 21 hours per week on classes. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 21 x 16 = 328 hours on classes over the entire semester.
"Response:  We know that Bill has to stack all of his cookies, chocolate croissants and bagels from one end to the other. The length of each cookie is 4 inches, so there are 300/4 = 75 cookies in total. Similarly, there are 120/6 = 20 chocolate croissants and 60/2 = 30 bagels. Therefore, the total length of all the food items is:

Cookies: 75 x 4 = 300 inches
Chocolate croissants: 20 x 6 = 120 inches
Bagels: 30 x 2 = 60 inches
Total length: 300 + 120 + 60 = 480 inches
Now, we need to find out how long it will take Bill to stack all these food items from one end to the other. Since each item has a fixed length, we can simply add up their lengths to get the total distance:

Distance = Total length of all food items
= 480 inches
Therefore, it will take Bill approximately 480 / 12 = 40 hours to stack all his cookies, chocolate croissants, and bagels from one end to the other."
"Response:  The zookeeper buys bananas for all monkeys in the zoo every two months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas per month, gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and baboons need 100 bananas per month, how many bananas does he need to order to last for 2 months?

To calculate this, we can use the following formula: Total number of bananas needed = (Number of monkeys x Number of bananas per monkey) x Number of months
Total number of bananas needed = (200 + 400 + 100) x 2 = 900 banans
Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 900 bananas to last for 2 months."
Response:  Bleyk runs forward and backward 15 times, covering a distance of 100 yards each time. Therefore, he covers a total distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.  Now, Kelli runs once from the start to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of 40 + 40 = 80 yards. So, she covers a total distance of 80 yards. Since Bleyk covered more distance than Kelli, he wins the race!
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rafael bought 4 rulers, each costing $1.5 per unit. So, he spent $6 for the rulers ($1.5 x 4 = $6).  Next, we are told that he also bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4. Therefore, he spent $8 for the notebooks ($4 x 2 = $8). Finally, we are given that he bought an eraser which cost $20. So, in total, Rafael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 on all the school supplies.
Response:  We know that Finn sees 11 headstanders in the water at first. Then he sees six of them come out from underneath the lily pad, so now there are six fewer headstanders in the water. Next, he sees two more hiding under the skeleton, so now there are four fewer headstanders in the water. Therefore, the number of headstanders Finn sees in the lake right now is 6 + 4 = 10.
Response:  On Monday (in Polish), the water in the reservoir had a depth of 5 meters. This means that the volume of water was 5 x 10^3 = 50,000 cubic meters.  On Tuesday (in English), there were more than 7 feet of water in the reservoir, which is equal to 2.13 meters (since there are 0.3048 meters per foot). So, the volume of water on Tuesday was 2.13 x 10^3 = 63,900 cubic meters.  On Wednesday, the depth of water was only two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the volume of water on Wednesday was 2/3 x 63,900 = 43,900 cubic meters. Therefore, the depth of water in the reservoir on Wednesday was 43,900 / 5 = 8.78 meters.
Response:  Anakin caught 10 sea stars and 6 sea horses, while Loxin caught 5 fewer sea stars than Ana kin (5 - 10 = -5). Also, L oxin caught 3 more clown fish than Ana kin (3 + 6 = 9). So, in total, Ana kin caught 10 + 6 = 16 sea creatures, while Loxin caught 9 + 3 = 12 sea creatures. Therefore, they together caught a total of 16 + 12 = 28 sea creatures.
Response:  After 1 month, the price will increase by 20%, so it will be $24 (20 x 1.2).  After 2 months, the price will again increase by 20%, so it will be $28.80 ($24 x 1.2).  We can continue this pattern to find the final cost after 36 months: $576.00 ($28.80 x 19). Therefore, through 36 months, the marble box will cost $576.00.
Response:  We know that one doll is equal to $1. So, if one figure costs $5, then all figures cost $5 x 3 = $15. Now, we have $15 + $4 (for the red car) = $19. Therefore, all the toys together cost $19.
Response:  If Jackie pays her taxes herself, she will save $35 per hour worked (since she won't have to pay for an accountant). So if she works 3 hours less per week, she will save $105 ($35 x 3 hours). However, since she also has to pay the accountant $90, her total savings would be $105 - $90 = $15. Therefore, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will have $15 more money than if she paid her taxes herself.
Response:  Firstly, Elvira spent 1090 euros on the computer with monitor, keyboard and mouse. Then she bought a scanner for 157 euros, a CD-player for 74 euros, and a printer for 102 euros. Therefore, her total expenses are: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 euros. Now let's check how much money is left for clothes: 1500 - 1423 = 77 euros. So, Elvira has 77 euros left to buy clothes.
Response:  Sandri gives her 9 eggs each time she sees their daughter. To make an Spanish omelette (Flamen), she needs 3 eggs. So, if Sandri is asked to make 15 Spanish omelettes for fundraising at school, she will have to sit with the child 15 / 9 = 1.67 times. Since we can't have a fraction of a time, let's round it up to 2 times. Therefore, Sandri will have to sit with the child twice to make 15 Spanish omelettes.
Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke and in two years their ages will be equal. So now Seth is 30 years old (twice Brooke's age). In two years, Seth will be 32 years old, and Brooke will also be 32 years old. Therefore, Seth is currently 30 years old.
Response:  We know that Jimmy has more than twice as much money as Ether. So if Ether has $8, then Jimmy must have at least $16 (twice $8).
"Response:  Pantcho walks 30 kilometers per day, except for weekends when he walks 10 miles (or 16 kilometers). So, in one week, he will walk:

30 km/day x 7 days = 210 km
+ 10 mi/day x 2 days (weekend) = 20 mi
Total distance walked in one week = 230 km"
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of each cap is $25. Secondly, we are told that the cost of each jacket is three times the cost of the cap, so the cost of each jacket is $25 x 3 = $75. Finally, we are given that the cost of each pants is equal to the cost of the cap and the jacket, so the cost of each pants is also $25 + ($75 x 2) = $100. Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $25 (cap) + $75 (jacket) + $100 (pants) = $200.
Response:  We know that there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so we have 8 x 80 = 640 legs of spiders. Then, we know that there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so we have 90 x 6 = 540 legs of insects. Finally, we know that there are 3 mutant arthropods with 10 legs each, so we have 3 x 10 = 30 legs of mutants. Therefore, in total, Jeff sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
Response: 1. Salli Two is three years older than Grandma Red. 2. Grandma Red is twice as old as Salli Three. 3. If Salli Four has the same age as Salli Thirty-two, and Salli Thirty-two has eight years, then what is the total age of four birds? So, the total age of the four birds is 4 x (age of each bird) = 4 x (3 + 8 + 2 +?) = 4 x 19 = 76 years.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month for her student loans and credit card debt.  The minimum amount she needs to pay for her student loans is $300 per month, and the minimum amount she needs to pay for her credit card debt is $200 per month. Therefore, her total monthly payment towards these two debts is $500 ($300 + $200).  Next, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment each month, then she will have to pay an additional $100 per month (i.e., $600 per month in total). So, over one year, she will pay a total of $7,200 ($600 x 12 months) towards her student loans and credit card debt.
Response:  Billy takes half an hour to prepare 60 carrots for his family barbecue (30 minutes x 2 = 60 minutes). To calculate how long it will take him to prepare each carrot, we need to divide the total time by the number of carrots he needs to prepare: 60 minutes / 60 carrots = 1 minute per carrot. Since it takes Billy only 5 seconds to cut each carrot, we can conclude that he will finish preparing all 60 carrots in 60 x 5 = 300 seconds or 5 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 5 minutes.
Response:  Juan and Carlos sell each glass of lemonade for $0.50, so they make $1 per gallon ($0.50 x 20 glasses/gallon). They also use $3 worth of lemons per gallon, which means they spent $3 / $0.50 = 6 times as much on lemons as they made in profit. Therefore, they spent $6 x $25 = $150 on lemons.
Response:  We know that there were 240 people in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of non-Japanese people is 240 - 80 = 160. Since we are told that 60 of these non-Japanese people were girls, we can conclude that the remaining 100 non-Japanese people (i.e., 160 - 60) were boys. Therefore, the number of girls in the Chinese team was 60 / 2 = 30.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zeyd spends $1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $1500 per month (since he earns $6000 per month). Secondly, he spends $1/3 of his salary on fuel for his car, which is $2000 per month ($6000 x 1/3 = $2000). Thirdly, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is $3000 per month ($6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $3000). Fourthly, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife for household expenses, which totals $900 per month ($200 + $700 = $900). Therefore, after all these expenditures, Zeyd has $2800 left ($6000 - $1500 - $2000 - $3000 - $900 = $2800).
Response:  We know that:  У Рані на 10 крабів більше, ніж у Моніка (10 - 5 = 5).  У Моніка на 4 краба менше, ніж у Бо (4 - x = 3), where x is the number of crabs Monica has. Therefore, we can write:  У Рані на 5 крабів більше, ніж у Моніки, а в Моніці на 3 краба менше, ніж у Бо. So, if Bo has 40 crabs, together they have:  У Рані на 5 + У Моніці на 3 = 8 крабів more than Bo. Therefore, the total number of crabs these three people have is: 40 + 8 = 48.
Response:  First week (days 1-7): $10/hour x 5 hours = $50 Second week (days 8-14): $10/hour x 8 hours = $80 Total earnings for first two weeks: $50 + $80 = $130
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two candidates competing for the position of representative in class Sara. Secondly, if the winner received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in the class, then the number of votes obtained by the loser can be calculated as follows:

Votes obtained by the loser = Total number of votes - Number of votes received by the winner
= 80 - (3/4 \* 80)
= 80 - 20
= 60
Therefore, the number of votes obtained by the loser is 60."
Response:  Sandra ordered 4 times more red roses than white carnations and 5 times more pink lilies than white ones. So, if she ordered 100 red roses (which is 4 x 25 = 100), then she ordered 50 white carnations (which is 25 / 4 = 50). And if she ordered 200 pink lilies (which is 5 x 40 = 200), then she ordered 80 white lilies (which is 40 / 5 = 80). Therefore, FRED needs to deliver 100 + 50 + 80 = 230 flowers before 5 pm today.
Response:  We know that Jean is two years older than Mark and that two years ago, Mark was five years older than Yan. So, if Yan is currently 30 years old, then Jean must be 32 years old (Jean is two years older than Mark).
Response:  Firstly, we know that one of the teams is very well united and each member will run 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So, their total time for running 1 km (4 laps of 400 meters) will be 55 x 4 = 220 seconds or 3 minutes 40 seconds.  Now, let's consider the second team. We are told that their first runner will take 60 seconds to complete 400 meters, which means they will finish the first lap in 60 + 400 = 460 seconds. Then, the next three runners will each be 3 seconds faster than the previous one, so they will finish the race in 460 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 473 seconds or 7 minutes 43 seconds. Therefore, the faster team will win by 3 minutes 40 seconds - 7 minutes 43 seconds = 4 minutes 8 seconds.
"Response:  Jerry throws a six-sided die. The probability of getting any particular number is 1/6 or approximately 0.17. Now, let's consider the event that Jerry gets two consecutive numbers greater than 3. This event can occur in one of three ways:

1. Jerry gets a 4 and then a 5 (or vice versa). The probability of this occurring is (1/6) x (1/6) = 0.017.
2. Jerry gets a 5 and then a 6 (or vice versa). The probability of this occurring is (1/6) x (1/6) = 0.017.
3. Jerry gets a 3, followed by a 4, followed by a 5, or a 6. There are four possible combinations for this event: (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 6), (3, 5, 4), or (3, 5, 6). The probability of each combination is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 0.003.

Now, we need to find the probability of the event ""Jerry gets two consecutive numbers greater than 3."" To do this, we add up the probabilities of all the possible outcomes:

Probability = 0.017 + 0.017 + 0.003 = 0.047

So, it is approximately 4.7% likely that Jerry will get two consecutive numbers greater than 3 when he throws a six-sided die."
Response:  Jenna gathered half as many apples as her mother, which means she gathered 50% of her mother's total apples. So, if Jenna's mother collected 20 apples, then Jenna gathered 10 apples (since 50% of 20 is 10). Therefore, the total number of apples they both gathered together is 30 apples (20 + 10 = 30).
Response:  We know that Russell works in a pet store and gives carrots to hamsters. There are 3 cages with 3 hamsters each, so there are 9 hamsters in total. Each hamster gets 6 carrots, so altogether they get 54 carrots. Now, let's move on to the mice. There are 10 cages with 1 mouse each, so there are 10 mice in total. Each mouse gets 5 carrots, so altogether they get 50 carrots. Finally, there is a pen for rabbits, where 20 rabbits get 10 carrots each, for a total of 200 carrots. Therefore, if 160 carrots are distributed among small rodents, then there must be 8 hamsters (54 / 7 = 8), 10 mice (50 / 5 = 10), and 0 rabbits (200 / 20 = 0) in the pet store.
Response:  Mandy owes Benedict $100 and agrees to pay him monthly interest of 2%. If she can only pay after 3 months, then we need to calculate how much she will owe at that time. So, let's use the formula for compound interest: A = P x (1 + r)^n, where: A = amount owed after n periods, P = principal amount ($100 in this case), r = monthly interest rate (2%/year = 0.02/month), and n = number of periods (3 months). Substituting these values, we get: A = $100 x (1 + 0.02/month)^3 = $104. So, after 3 months, Mandy owes Benedict $104 instead of $100.
Response:  We know that the trader paid $20 for each bag of wheat from the farmer and sold each bag for $30. So, he made a profit of $10 per bag ($30 - $20). Since he sold all bags, we can calculate his total profit as follows: Total Profit = Number of Bags x Profit Per Bag Total Profit = 10 bags x $10 per bag = $100 Therefore, the trader sold 10 bags of wheat.
Response:  Firstly, they spent $69 on tickets ($20.25 x 3). Secondly, they spent less than $4.50 on food (since it was mentioned that they spent less than $4.50 on food). Thirdly, they took two different trips at $33 each (since it was mentioned that they took two different trips). Therefore, if they divided their expenses equally among themselves, each person would have paid: Total cost = $69 + ($4.50 / 3) + ($33 x 2) = $185 Now, let's divide this amount equally among three people: Each person = $185 / 3 = $61.67 So, each of them paid $61.67 in total.
Response:  John can collect per...
"Response:  We know that for survival, crickets need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week. If there are ten crickets in a stadium, we can calculate how much they need to eat every day as follows:

10 crickets x 3.5 pounds/week = 35 pounds/week

Now, let's convert this amount to kilograms:

35 pounds / 0.45 kg/pound = 78 kg/week

So, if there are ten crickets in a stadium, they need to eat approximately 78 kilograms of cockroaches every week to survive."
Response:  Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 new ones each year. So in total he has 60 trees (50 + 10 x 9 = 60). Now, every year he cuts down 2 trees, so after 10 years he will have 40 trees left (60 - 2 x 10 = 40). Since 30% of the remaining trees die every year, after 10 years there are 40 / 0.3 = 133 trees left. Therefore, Tom has 133 trees left after 10 years.
Response:  On Friday morning (Pacific Time), there were 18 rosette-shaped plastic flamingos placed in front of Seward's house.  In Saturday morning (Pacific Time), her neighbors took away one-third of these flamingos and repainted them white. They then returned these newly painted white flamingos to the same spot in front of Seward's house. Therefore, at this point, there were 12 white flamingos plus the original 18 rosette-shaped flamingos, for a total of 30 flamingos in front of Seward's house.  Then, on Sunday morning (Pacific Time), an additional 18 rosette-shaped plastic flamingos were added to the collection, bringing the total number of flamingos in front of Seward's house to 48. So, as of Sunday afternoon (Pacific Time), there were more rosette-shaped plastic flamingos than white ones - 48 versus 30.
Response:  We know that Violetta wants to buy new pencils in 5 different colors and she has $20 for this purchase. Since one pencil costs $2, we can calculate how many pencils she can buy as follows: Number of pencils = Total amount / Cost per pencil = $20 / $2 = 10 pencils So, Violetta will receive 10 pencils.
"Response:  We know that one olive costs $1.20 and one gumball costs $0.30. So, if we want to find out how much 8 rulers cost, we can multiply the price of each item by 8:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60 (for 8 olives)
$0.30 x 8 = $2.40 (for 8 gumballs)
So, in total, 8 rulers would cost $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00."
"Response:  We have to divide 200 pounds of cucumbers among 40 restaurants. Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of cucumbers. To find out how many kilograms of cucumbers won't be used, we need to convert pounds to kilograms. There are approximately 0.45 kilograms in one pound (since there are 1000 grams in one kilogram). So:

200 pounds / 40 restaurants = 5 kilograms per restaurant (approximately)
Since each restaurant receives 2 pounds of cucumbers, we can calculate the amount of cucumbers that won't be used as follows:

5 kg x 2 lb/kg = 10 kg (approximately)
Therefore, about 10 kilograms of cucumbers won't be used."
Response:  We know that there are 23786 people in So...
Response:  In the first month, Ileyn had 20 cards of Pokémon. Then in the second month, she gathered thrice as many cards, which is 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). However, in the third month, she gathered half as many cards again, which is 40 cards (60 / 2 = 40). Therefore, the total number of cards that Ileyn has at the end is: 20 + 60 - 40 = 100 cards.
Response:  We know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers who pay him different rates. Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences per week and Publisher A pays him $0.05 per sentence. So, we can calculate how much Mark earns from each publisher as follows:  For Publisher A: Number of sentences edited = 1000 Number of dollars earned = 1000 x $0.05 = $50 For Publisher B: Number of sentences edited = 1000 Number of dollars earned = 1000 x $0.10 = $100 Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, Mark earns double the amount from Publisher B than he does from Publisher A. Therefore, his total weekly income is: Total income = $50 + $100 = $150
Response:  Baldur takes 5 liters of water every morning and 6 liters every evening for a total of 11 liters per day (5 + 6). Since there are 30 days in April, he will take a total of 330 liters of water during that month (11 x 30 = 330).
Response:  Firstly, John wins $5000 as an award, which is equal to half of his yearly salary increase. So, he gets a 5% raise in his annual salary, which means his new salary will be $2000 + (5000 / 100) = $2600 per week. Therefore, John earned $2600 x 52 weeks = $134,400 that year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Joe has a farm of 10 acres (10 x 4047 = 40470 square meters). Secondly, from the question, we learn that each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year, so Joe's total production is 5 x 10 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Thirdly, we are told that one ton of grapes yields two barrels of wine, so Joe's total wine production is 50 x 2 = 100 barrels of wine per year. Therefore, the number of barrels of wine produced by Joe's farm in a year is 100.
Response:  We know that Carl eats one slice of cheese every day for lunch and uses two slices for his sandwiches three days a week. So he consumes 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese per week (for lunch). Additionally, he eats an omelette with cheese once a week, using one extra slice of cheese than for his sandwiches. Therefore, he consumes 15 slices of cheese per week (for breakfast + lunch). Finally, when preparing a large dish with macaroni and cheese, he uses 8 slices of cheese. So, in total, Carl consumes 15 + 8 = 23 slices of cheese per week.
Response:  First, Janet had 22 green buttons and 10 yellow ones, so she had in total 32 buttons (22 + 10 = 32). Then, she bought 6 packages of blue buttons, each containing 9 buttons, so she got 54 blue buttons (6 x 9 = 54). Finally, she also bought 2 packages of red buttons, each containing 6 buttons, so she got 12 red buttons (2 x 6 = 12). Therefore, the total number of buttons that Janet has now is 32 + 54 + 12 = 108 buttons.
"Response:  We know that Brinly has received scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests. If she wants to have an average score of 93 on all six tests, we can calculate her score on the sixth test as follows:

Average score = (Score on 1st test + Score on 2nd test +... + Score on 5th test) / 5
= (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5
= 452 / 5
= 90.4
So, Brinly needs to get at least 90.4 on the sixth test to achieve an overall average of 93."
Response:  Firstly, Michel rode his bike at least 5 times per week for 4 weeks, which means he covered a total distance of at least 200 kilometers (5 x 25 km/week x 4 weeks). Then, he reduced his rides to twice a week and increased the distance to 60 kilometers each ride for 3 weeks, covering a total distance of 180 kilometers (2 x 60 km/week x 3 weeks). Therefore, in total, Michael traveled 380 kilometers (200 + 180) during the four-week period.
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate bars and each bar weighs twice as much as an apple. So, if one chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, then two apples will weigh 80 grams (since they double). Therefore, the total weight of all the candy in the bag is: 25 x 40 = 1000 grams + 80 = 1080 grams.  So, the weight of the entire bag of candy is approximately 1080 grams or 38.6 ounces.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 tarts. If she bought 3 times more than she bought on Monday, then she bought 12 tarts (3 x 4 = 12).  On Tuesday, she bought 5 times as many pastries as she did on Monday, so she bought 60 pastries (5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, in total, Rose bought 72 tarts over these three days (12 + 60 = 72).
"Response:  We know that two dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total value of half a dozen trays sold for $6000 each. So we can write an equation as follows:

$ (2 \times 120) = $ (3 \times 6000) - $1200

Now let's solve this equation:

$ (240 ) = $ (18000) - $1200

$ (240 / 18000) = $ (1200 / 6000)$ (divide both sides by 18000 and then divide both sides by 6000)

So the answer is $75 per cup."
Response:  Firstly, Sarah earns $4 for each time she cuts the grass. Since she has already earned $10, she will have to cut the grass 2.5 times (10 / 4 = 2.5) before she can afford the new jacket and shoes. Therefore, the answer is 2.5.
Response:  We know that red hens lay 3 eggs per day and white hens lay 5 eggs per day. So, in total, Jerry collects 42 eggs per day. Now, if he has more than two white hens, then there are fewer red hens. Therefore, we can say that the number of red hens is equal to the number of white hens minus 2. In other words, the number of red hens = Number of white hens - 2. Substituting this value into our equation for the total number of eggs collected per day, we get: Total number of eggs = Number of red hens x 3 + (Number of white hens - 2) x 5. Simplifying and solving for the number of red hens, we get: Number of red hens = 42 / (3 + (5 - 2)) = 42 / 10 = 4. So, there are 4 red hens in Jerry's farm.
"Response:  If Gari loves to walk around the local park, which is a rectangle with dimensions of 1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 square miles. If he walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour, then he will cover 3 miles in one hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we need to divide the distance he covers (in miles) by his walking speed (in miles per hour):

Time = Distance / Speed
= 9 miles / 3 miles/hour
= 3 hours
Therefore, Gari spends 3 hours walking in the local park."
"Response:  On day one, Slaun counted 100 customers in the store. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day, so there were 150 customers in total (100 + 50 = 150). On the third day, if the total number of customers was 500, then the number of customers on each of those days would be: Day 1: 100 customers; Day 2: 150 customers; Day 3: 500 customers. Therefore, Slaun counted 400 customers on the third day (500 - 100 - 150 = 400)."
Response:  We know that initially there were 2 gallons per minute in both basins (since they have equal flow rates). So after 4 minutes, the total volume of water in the large basin would be twice that of the small basin = 8 gallons. Then, we are told that 4 hours ago, the large basin had twice as much water as the small basin, so the volume of water in the small basin was half that of the large basin = 4 gallons. Now, we are also told that the volume of water in the large basin is now four times that of the small basin = 16 gallons. Therefore, the volume of water in the small basin is currently 4 gallons / 16 gallons = 1/4 or 0.25 gallons.
Response:  Lorri wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320 and a matching belt for $32. She works part-time and earns $8 per hour. To calculate how many hours she needs to work before she can afford her desired purchase, we need to divide the cost of the items by her hourly wage: Cost = $320 + $32 = $352 Hourly Wage = $8 Per Hour Worked Number of Hours = $352 / $8 = 44 hours Therefore, Lorri will have to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt.
Response:  We know that Janet borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed as interest. So, we can write this as:  $2000 + (10% of $2000) = Total Amount Due  Now, let's calculate how much Janet needs to pay each month for 12 months:  Monthly Payment = Total Amount Due / Number of Months To Pay  In this case, the total amount due is: $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2300  And there are 12 months to pay: $2300 / 12 = $190 per month Therefore, if Janet pays $165 per month for 12 months, she will still owe $190 at the end of those 12 months.
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the basket and seven daisies more than roses. So, if we have x flowers of roses, then we have 7x + 4 = 11 flowers altogether (since there are 7 daisies for each rose). Therefore, the total number of flowers in the basket is 11.
Response:  Edrian is three times older than Harryet, so Edrian is 3 x 21 = 63 years old.  Since Harriette is twice as old as Zak, Harriette is 2 x 21 = 42 years old.  If we add three years to their current ages, we get:  Edrian - 3 = 60 years old  Harriette - 3 = 45 years old  Zak - 3 = 28 years old
Response:  We know that four students in total scored 251 points. Naomi scored 68 points. Yuriy scored more than Naomi and Brendan scored more than Naomi too. So, Yuriy scored at least 69 points (since he scored more than Naomi). Therefore, we can say that Yuriy scored 69 + 10 = 79 points. Now let's check how many points did Joe score. Since Joe is one of the remaining two students who didn't mention in the passage, it means that he must have scored less than or equal to 251 - 4 * 68 = 133 points. So, Joe scored exactly 133 points.
Response:  Carmen spends 10 minutes solving crosswords and 5 minutes solving Sudoku puzzles. During her weekend break, she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles. Therefore, the total time spent playing these games is: Time = Number of puzzles x Time per puzzle Total time = 3 x 10 + 8 x 5 = 45 + 40 = 85 minutes. So, Carmen spent approximately 85 minutes playing crosswords and Sudoku during her weekend break.
Response:  We know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the reservoir to irrigate her small garden. This means that there are now 30 liters less water in the reservoir than before (120 - 90 = 30). So, currently, there are 30 liters of water left in the reservoir.
Response:  We know that Еnді has planted fewer petunias than geraniums. So, if he has planted 90 ge...
Response:  In year one, the company spends $15,000 on advertising for a total of 2 years. So in year two, it will spend $\frac{15,000}{3} = $5,000$on advertising. Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising over both years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000$.
Response:  If Carlos pays $30/hour for his canoe and he uses it for 3 hours, then he will pay $90 (3 x $30).  Benji pays $18/hour for his banana boat and he uses it for 5 hours, so he will pay $90 (5 x $18).  Therefore, in total they will pay $180 ($90 + $90) for their rentals.
Response:  Firstly, Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, which takes 6 days. Then he will return from Rochester to New Jersey by car, which takes half the time as going there (since it is twice faster than the bus). Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will spend on his trip = 6 + (1/2) = 7 days.
Response:  Firstly, James has 40 cards of type Water. If he loses 8 of them, he will have 40 - 8 = 32 cards of type Water left. Now, if he buys 14 new cards of type Grass, which is a percentage of his remaining Water cards, then the probability that any randomly chosen card from these newly bought cards will be of type Water is:  Number of Water cards remaining / Total number of new cards = 32/54 = 0.6 (or 60%) So, the probability that a randomly chosen card from the newly bought cards will be of type Water is 0.6 or 60%.
Response:  Firstly, Chead ordered burritos for lunch at $6.50 each. Then he added extra meat ($2), cheese ($1), avocado ($1), and two sauces ($0.25) to his order, making it total $7.45. Next, he used his gift card worth $5 to pay for part of the bill, leaving him with an out-of-pocket cost of $2.45. Therefore, Chead still needs to pay $2.45 more.
Response:  Каліна works at it for x hours = Total number of pieces / Time taken by her per piece = 360 / 4 = 90 hours. Since Мама can do twice as much work in an hour as Каліна, she will take half the time to complete the puzzle = 90/2 = 45 hours. Therefore, they will need 45 hours to finish the puzzle.
Response:  We know that Ashlyn took 30% of the kale seeds home after two months, which means she took 36 kale seeds (since there are 120 kale seeds in total). Then, when she returned after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining kale seeds were ready to harvest, which is equal to 90 kale seeds ( since there are 120 kale seeds in total). So, the number of kale seeds not yet ready for harvest after two weeks is 36 - 90 = -54 kale seeds. Therefore, there were -54 kale seeds not yet ready for harvest after two weeks.
Response:  Firstly, Mark pays 10% tax on each car, which is equal to $2000 per car (10% of $20,000). So, he pays a total of $24,000 in taxes for all 12 cars ($20,000 x 10%). Then, he pays an additional $1000 for registration fee for each car, making it a total of $36,000 ($1000 x 12 cars). Therefore, Mark pays a total of $58,000 for all 12 cars.
"Response:  On Monday (inviwed as ""понеділок""), Kayli collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells in total. So, Kayli collects 25 shells (5 + 20).  On Tuesday (inviwed as ""вівторок""), Kayli collects twice as many shells as she collected on Monday. If she collected 25 shells on Monday, then she will collect 50 shells on Tuesday (2 x 25 = 50). Therefore, Kayli collects 75 shells on Tuesday."
Response:  If Dax found twice fewer jacks than grasshoppers in the garden, and there were 50 grasshoppers in the garden, then the number of jackets is half that amount or 25. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75 (50 + 25).
Response:  Firstly, we know that 36 penguins are sleeping in the snow.  Then, one-third of them (12 penguins) jump and swim in the ocean. Another third of them (12 penguins) enter a cave to eat dinner. So, there are 12 penguins left on the sun. Therefore, the number of penguins remaining on the sun is 12.
"Response:  Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so he eats 6 per day (the same amount she does). If one grapevine can produce 3 tomatoes in a week, then Steve needs:

$ Number of grapevines = \text {Total number of tomatoes} / (\text{Number of tomatoes per grapevine} \times \text{Number of days in a week}) $

$= \text{Total number of tomatoes} / (3 \times 7) $

$= \text{Total number of tomatoes} / 21 $

So, Steve needs 4 grapevines to grow all the tomatoes he wants to eat ($4 \div 21 = 0.19$)."
Response:  John wants to share the pizza equally among his 20 friends, so each friend will get 4 pieces of pizza. Since there are only 8 portions in total (pizza), John needs to order 20/8 = 2.5 times as much pizza as he would normally buy for himself. Therefore, John should order 2.5 x 8 = 20 portions of pizza.
Response:  Ram has 5 empty pens and he can make one full pen by mixing black ink with 5 of them. So, if he buys 25 pens, he will be able to make 25/5 = 5 full pens using all of them. Therefore, he will have 5 full pens left after making new ones when the ink runs out.
Response:  Johnnie took $20 and added another $10, so he had a total of $30. Then, over the year, his money grew by a factor of three, which means it became $90 ($30 x 3). Therefore, Johnnie had $90 after one year.
"Response:  Mary is two years younger than Joan, who is five years older than Jessica. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Mary = Joan - 5 + 2
Joan = Jessica + 5
Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
Mary = Jessica + 5 - 5 + 2
Mary = Jessica + 7
So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 70 (Jessica) + 20 (Mary) + 5 (Joan) = 95 years old."
Response:  We know that there are 1000 students in total and they left through one of three exits A, B or C.  If 30% of them went out through exit A, then the number of students who did not go out through exit A is 700 (1000 - 30%).  Now, if 3/5 of those who did not go out through exit A also went out through exit B, then the number of students who went out through exit B is 210 (700 x 3/5).  Finally, the remaining students went out through exit C, so the number of students who went out through exit C is 490 (1000 - 210). Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 490.
Response:  We know that James has more candy than Robert and John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, if James has x candy, then Robert has x/2 candy. Now we are told that John has 54 candies, which means he has 54 - (x/2) = 32 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the difference in number of candies between John and James is 32.
Response: 1. Do...
Response:  Mike has been pen pals with five people and he stopped being friends with two of them. Each person sends two letters per week, which means there are ten letters in total (5 x 2 = 10). Since Mike can write one page every six hours, he will have written 10 / 6 = 1.67 pages per day. Therefore, he spends approximately 1.67 days or 10.6 hours per week writing letters to his pen pals.
Response:  Jason plans to call his boss for 1000 minutes per month, which is equivalent to 16.67 hours (1000 / 60). Since he has 30 days in this month, we can calculate how many minutes he spends talking to other people as follows: Minutes spent with others = Total minutes - Minutes spent with boss = 16.67 - 1000 / 60 = 83.43 minutes So, Jason has 83.43 minutes left after calling his boss and other people for 30 days.
Response:  We know that Grifin had 24 carrots initially and Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 10 carrots. Then Ginger gave Griffin some of her own carrots, but we don't know how many. Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle took, so he took 7 carrots. Finally, we are told that Griffin ended up with 27 carrot sticks. So, if Ginger gave Griffin some of her own carrots, then she must have given him x carrots, where x is the difference between 27 and 24 (i.e., 3). Therefore, the number of carrots Ginger gave Griffin is 3.
Response:  In one aquarium, there are 4 snails, and in another, there are 32 snails. If we assume that each snail produces an equal amount of slime, then the total amount of slime produced by all snails in both aquariums is equal. Therefore, the number of snails in each aquarium can be expressed as follows: Number of snails in Aquarium A = Total amount of slime / Amount of slime per snail Number of snails in Aquarium B = Total amount of slime / Amount of slime per snail Since there are 4 snails in Aquarium A and 32 snails in Aquarium B, we can set up the following equation: Number of snails in Aquarium A = (Total amount of slime / Amount of slime per snail) = (4 / x) Number of snills in Aquarium B = (Total amount of slime / Amount of slime per snail) = (32 / y) where x and y are unknown variables. Now, we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving the first equation for x, we get: x = Total amount of slime / 4 Substituting this value into the second equation, we get: (32 / y) = Total amount of slime / 4 y = 8 So, there are 8 snails in Aquarium B. Therefore, the answer to the question is 8.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time Dijin spends on makeup for each day of filming. Since she has to do it 4 times a week and for 5 weeks in total, that makes 20 days (4 x 5 = 20) of makeup application per month. Therefore, her daily average is:

$$ \text{Time spent on makeup} = \frac{\text{Total time for filming}} {\text{Number of days of filming}} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \text{Time spent on makeup} = \frac {5\times 20\times 6}{7} = 38.57 \text{ hours/day} $$

Now, let's calculate how much money Jean pays Dijin for each hour of makeup application:

$$ \text{Payment for makeup} = \$250 \times \frac{\text{Time spent on makeup}}{60} = \$4,250 \text{ per day} $$

Since the filming lasts for 5 weeks, Jean will pay Dijin a total of:

$$ \text{Total payment} = \$4,250 \times 5 = \$21,250 $$

Finally, after deducting 10% of the total amount paid, Jean will give Dijin:

$$ \text{Final payment} = \$21,250 - (\$21,250 \times 0.10) = \$19,375 $$

Therefore, Jean will pay Dijin a total of $19,375 for the entire duration of the film project."
Response:  Firstly, Izabella spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, which she divided equally among three people (her parents and herself), so each person paid $4 for the cake.  Next, she spent $43 on gifts for her little sister's birthday, again dividing it equally among the three people, so each person paid $14.30 for the gifts.  Then, she spent $15 on accessories, which she also divided equally among the three people, so each person paid $5 for the accessories.  Finally, she spent $22 on party favors, which she gave to all six family members (herself, her two parents, and her little sister). So each person paid $3.67 for the party favors. Therefore, in total, Izabella's parents paid $4 + $14.30 + $5 + $3.67 = $37.57, while Izabella paid $4 + $12 + $5 + $3.67 = $36.67.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the chef bought 4 baskets of cabbage. Since each basket weighs 50 pounds, the total weight of all four baskets is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Next, we are told that each kilogram of cabbage costs $1,50. Therefore, the total cost of all the cabbage the chef bought is 200 pounds x $1,50/kilogram = $300. So, the chef spent $300 on cabbage.
Response:  On Monday, Sew consumed 8 times more cookies than her sister (4 x 4 = 16).  On Tuesday, she consumed twice as many cookies as her sister (2 x 13 = 26). So, in total, Sew consumed 42 cookies (16 + 26) and her sister consumed 13 cookies. Since each cookie contains 200 calories, Sew consumed 8,400 calories (42 x 200) and her sister consumed 1,300 calories (13 x 200). Therefore, Sew consumed 7,100 more calories than her sister (8,400 - 1,300).
