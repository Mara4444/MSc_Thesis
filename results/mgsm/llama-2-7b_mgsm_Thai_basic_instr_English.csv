Explanation:
The question states that there are 60 downloads in the first month, and then it decreases by 30% every two months. To calculate the total number of downloads in three months, we need to multiply the number of downloads in each month by 1.3. So, in the second month, there will be 60 x 1.3 = 78 downloads, and in the third month, there will be 78 x 1.3 = 104 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads in three months is 90 (60 + 78 + 104)."

Explanation:
To calculate the total cost of the items purchased by Thai, we need to multiply the number of each item by its price per unit and then add up all the results.
For the first category (T-shirts), there are 3 T-shirts at $68 each, so the total cost is 3 x $68 = $204.
For the second category (hoodies), there are 2 hoodies at $80 each, so the total cost is 2 x $80 = $160.
For the third category (mini skirts), there are 6 mini skirts at $55 each, so the total cost is 6 x $55 = $330.
Adding up all these costs gives us a total of $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.
Therefore, the total cost of the items purchased by Thai is $694."

Explanation:
To calculate the total amount of money that Carl will make from his lemons in one year, we need to multiply the number of lemons he sells per day by the price per lemon and then multiply that result by the number of days in a year.
So, if Carl sells 7 lemons per day at $1.5 each, he will make $10.50 per day ($1.5 x 7). If there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years), then Carl will make $3,650 per year ($10.50 x 365).
Therefore, the total amount of money Carl will make from his lemons in one year is $3,650."

"Response: 36749.25
Explanation:
To calculate the total cost of each option, we need to consider both the fixed costs and the variable costs. For Option A, the fixed costs are $5,000, and for Option B, they are $8,000. The variable costs for Option A are $12,500 (2 x $6,250), while for Option B, they are $10,800 ($8,000 x 1.2%). To find the total cost of each option, we multiply the fixed costs by the number of months in the period, which is 6 months for both options. Then, we add the variable costs to get the total cost for each option. Finally, we subtract any discounts or rebates that may be available to determine the net cost.
For Option A, the calculation is as follows:
Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost = $5,000 + ($12,500 x 6/12) = $36,250 - $6,250 = $30,000
For Option B, the calculation is as follows:
Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost = $8,000 + ($10,800 x 6/12) = $46,320 - $8,000 = $38,320
Therefore, based on the given information, the best option for Phongkae would be Option B, which has a lower total cost of $38,320 compared to Option A's total cost of $30,000."

Explanation:
To calculate the total cost of the protein powder, we need to multiply the number of scoops per serving by the price per scoop and then multiply that result by the number of servings per container.
The question states that there are 15 scoops per container, so each scoop costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost of one serving is:
$4.00 x 15 = $60.00
Since there are 60 servings per container, the total cost of all 60 servings is:
$60.00 x 60 = $3600.00

"Response: 365 x (140 + 14 x 10%) = 49280

Explanation:
To calculate the total amount of money that the company will spend on streamlining services for each year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12 and then add the percentage increase for each subsequent year.

For the first year, the monthly cost is $140, so the total cost for the year is $140 x 12 = $1760.

For the second year, the monthly cost increases by 10%, which is $14 x 10% = $140. So, the total cost for the second year is $1760 + $140 = $1900.

Repeating this process for each subsequent year results in an accumulated total of $49280 over five years ($1760 x 5 = $8800 + $1900 x 4 = $7600)."

"Response: 32 dollars
Explanation:
The number of students in each class is given as 15 students per class. The school has 5 classes per day and 8 classes on Saturday. Therefore, the total number of students attending school per day is:

5 classes x 15 students/class = 75 students/day
8 classes x 15 students/class = 120 students/Saturday

Since the teacher earns $15 per student per day, their daily income would be:

$15 x 75 students/day = $11,250 per day

Similarly, for Saturday, the teacher's income would be:

$15 x 120 students/Saturday = $18,000 per Saturday

Therefore, the teacher's weekly income would be:

$11,250 + $18,000 = $29,250 per week"

"Response: 125000 / (4 x 3600) = 87500
Explanation:
To calculate the number of seconds in one day, we need to convert both the time period and the distance from miles to meters.
One day is equal to 86400 seconds, so if we multiply it by 4 (the number of weeks), we get 336400 seconds. Then, if we divide it by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour), we get 94600 hours. Finally, if we divide it by 1000 (to convert hours to minutes), we get 946000 minutes.
Now, let's convert the distance from miles to meters. There are 1609.34 meters in a mile, so if we multiply the distance of 400 miles by this conversion factor, we get approximately 6432720 meters.
Finally, to find out how many seconds it would take to walk 400 miles at a rate of 3 miles per hour, we can use the formula:
time = distance / speed
Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:
time = 6432720 meters / 3 miles/hour = 2144223.33 seconds
Therefore, the answer to the question is 2144223.33 seconds."

"Response: 52400
Explanation:
To calculate the total amount of money that the employee will receive in one year, we need to multiply the monthly salary by 12 months. Since the company provides a bonus of 10% of the monthly salary every year, we also need to multiply the result by 10%. Therefore, the total amount of money the employee will receive in one year is:
Total = Monthly Salary x 12 + (Monthly Salary x 10%)
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Total = $600 x 12 + ($600 x 10%)
Total = $7200 + $6000
Total = $13200
Therefore, the employee will receive a total of $13200 in one year."

Explanation:
The hospital has 500 patients per day and each patient spends an average of 24 hours receiving treatment. The doctor's fee is $150 per hour, and the hospital charges $200 per hour for patient care. To calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital from these patients, we need to multiply the number of patients by the time they spend at the hospital, then multiply that result by the cost per hour charged by the doctor or hospital.
In this case, if there are 500 patients per day and each patient spends an average of 24 hours at the hospital, then the total number of hours spent at the hospital per day is 500 x 24 = 12,000 hours. If the doctor's fee is $150 per hour and the hospital charge is $200 per hour, then the total revenue generated by the hospital from these patients would be 12,000 hours x ($150/hour) = $180,000 per day."

The number of flips required to sort the coins is given by the formula: n = (number of coins) / (average number of flips per coin).
In this case, there are 5 coins and each coin has an average of 3 flips, so the total number of flips required is:
n = 5 x 3 = 15 flips
Since there are 12 coins in total, including the 5 coins that have already been sorted, the remaining 7 coins require an additional 7 x 15 = 105 flips to be sorted. Therefore, the total number of flips required to sort all 12 coins is:
105 + 15 = 120 flips
So, the answer is 120."

"Response: 360 people can fit in the restaurant at one time.
Explanation:
The number of customers that can fit in the restaurant at one time is calculated as follows:

Total capacity = Number of days x Number of customers per day
= 100 days x 100 customers/day
= 10,000 customers/day

Since there are 8 hours in a day, the maximum number of customers that can be accommodated in a day is:

Maximum capacity = Total capacity / Time slot per day
= 10,000 customers/day / 8 hours/day
= 1250 customers/hour

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of customers that can fit in the restaurant at one time based on the given information:

Maximum number of customers at one time = Maximum capacity x Number of times the restaurant is open per day
= 1250 customers/hour x 100 days/year
= 125,000 customers/year

Therefore, 360 people can fit in the restaurant at one time (based on the assumption that each customer takes up an average space of 0.3 m^2)."

To calculate the amount of money that will be left over for John after he pays his monthly installments of $165 for 12 months, we need to subtract the total amount paid from the original loan amount.
The total amount paid is calculated by multiplying the number of installments (12) by the monthly payment ($165). Therefore, the total amount paid is:
$165 x 12 = $1,980
Now, let's subtract this amount from the original loan amount:
$2,000 - $1,980 = $200
Therefore, after paying $1,980 in monthly installments for 12 months, John will have $200 left over."

Explanation:
To calculate the total number of melons in the orchard, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of columns and then add up all the individual melon counts.
Let's assume there are 50 melons per row and 8 rows in each block. Therefore, the total number of melons in one block is:
50 x 8 = 400 melons
There are 4 blocks in the orchard, so the total number of melons in the orchard is:
400 x 4 = 1600 melons
Now, let's consider the area of the orchard. The length of the orchard is 100 meters, and it has a width of 50 meters. To find the area of the orchard, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. In this case, the area of the orchard is:
Area = 100 x 50 = 5000 square meters
Finally, we can convert the number of melons to a volume using the density of a melon. Let's assume an average melon weight of 1 kg. Using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (Volume = Length x Width x Height), we can calculate the volume of the orchard as follows:
Volume = 5000 x 1000 = 5000 cubic meters
So, approximately 1267.34 cubic meters of space in the orchard contains melons."

* The remaining students who do not use exit A make up 3/5 of the total number of students.

Now, let's calculate the number of students who leave through exit C:

Number of students leaving through exit C = Total number of students x (Remaining students / Total number of students)
= 1,000 x (300 / 1,000)
= 300

Therefore, the answer is 300."

Therefore, the total number of mats in all sections is 48 x 3 = 144. Finally, the question asks how many mats there are in total, which we can calculate by adding the number of mats in each section to the number of mats in the first section, which is 144 + 48 = 192. So, there are 192 mats in total."
