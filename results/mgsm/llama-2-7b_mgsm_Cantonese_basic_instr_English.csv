Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* 莎莎 (Sasa) has bought 50 pieces of wood with a price increase of 50% over the past few months.
* Each piece of wood costs $10.
* Sasa has 10 remaining pieces of wood that she wants to sell.
* The size of each piece is 4 x 10 = 40 square feet.
* The price per square foot is $16.

Now let's calculate the total amount of money Sasa can make from selling her remaining wood:
Total number of pieces of wood = Remaining pieces / Original price per piece
= 10 / $10
= 1

Total area of all pieces = Total number of pieces x Area per piece
= 1 x 40 sq ft
= 40 sq ft

Total value of all pieces = Total area x Price per square foot
= 40 sq ft x $16
= $640

So, if Sasa sells all 10 pieces of wood at $16 per square foot, she will make a total of $640."

Number of cups of water = 120 / 7 : 13 = 9 cups of water

So, Kati used 9 cups of water to make her coffee using 120 tea spoons of sugar."

Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, Adrian's salary increased by 30% four years after he started working at the company, and his current salary is $160,000. Therefore, Adrian's total salary over the past four years can be calculated as follows:

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Total salary = $160,000 x ($160,000 / $40,000) x (1 + 0.30) ^ 4
Total salary = $160,000 x 4.57
Total salary = $729,600

Therefore, the total distance traveled by all five people is 5 x 25 = 125 miles per day. Since it takes 25 minutes to inflate one tire, the total time spent inflating all five tires per day is 5 x 25 = 125 minutes. As there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent inflating tires per day is 125/60 = 2 hours. So, the person who stayed behind to inflate tires for 8 hours (as stated in the last sentence of the question) would have earned $2 x 8 = 16 dollars."

Explanation:
To calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month to repay her debts, we need to know the total amount of debt she has and the minimum payment required for each type of loan. According to the question, Jessica's total debt is $1,500 (which includes a student loan of $300, a credit card debt of $200, and an mortgage debt of $500).
For the student loan, the minimum payment is $300 per year, which means Jessica needs to make at least this amount every year to avoid defaulting on the loan. For the credit card debt, the minimum payment is $200 per year, and for the mortgage debt, it is $500 per year.
If Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum payment for each loan, we can use the following formulas to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay each month:
For the student loan: Additional payment = Total debt - Minimum payment / Number of months until next payment
Additional payment = $1,500 - $300 / 12 = $66.67 per month
For the credit card debt: Additional payment = Total debt - Minimum payment / Number of months until next payment
Additional payment = $1,500 - $200 / 12 = $66.67 per month
For the mortgage debt: Additional payment = Total debt - Minimum payment / Number of months until next payment
Additional payment = $1,500 - $500 / 12 = $75 per month
Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each loan, we can multiply the additional payment by 1.5 to get the total monthly payment she needs to make:
Student loan: Total monthly payment = $66.67 x 1.5 = $99.99 per month
Credit card debt: Total monthly payment = $66.67 x 1.5 = $99.99 per month
Mortgage debt: Total monthly payment = $75 x"

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 20 bottles:
$0.13 x 20 = $2.60

So, if they sell 25 bottles and make $25 in profit, they will have spent approximately $2.60 to produce those 25 bottles."

Explanation:
Let's assume that there are 2 candidates running for class president in Sarai's school, and each candidate has received 3/4 of the total votes. Since there are 80 students in each class, we can calculate the number of votes each candidate would receive as follows:

Candidate A receives 3/4 x 80 = 60 votes
Candidate B receives 3/4 x 80 = 60 votes

Since both candidates have received an equal number of votes, the winner is determined by a random draw. Therefore, the number of votes the losing candidate (Candidate B) would receive is also 60 votes.

So, the total number of votes cast in the election is 120 votes (60 + 60)."

* Of the remaining 700 students, 3/5 will leave through door B (285 students).
* Of the remaining 285 students, 3/5 will leave through door C (169 students).

So, in total, there are 300 + 285 + 169 = 420 students who will leave through doors A, B, and C respectively."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Robert has twice as many sweets as James, which means that if James has x sweets, then Robert has 2x sweets. Since John has 54 sweets and James has 6 sweets, we can set up the equation:

John's sweets = (James' sweets) + (Robert's sweets)
= 6 + (2 \* James' sweets)
= 6 + (2 \* 6)
= 6 + 12
= 18

Therefore, John has 18 more sweets than James."

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that each person sends two letters per week, and there are five people involved. Therefore, the total number of letters sent per week is 5 x 2 = 10 letters.
Since each letter takes six minutes to write, the total time spent writing letters per week is 10 letters x 6 minutes/letter = 60 minutes/week.
Therefore, over one week, a person can spend approximately 60 minutes/week x 7 days/week = 420 minutes/week or around 7 hours/week on writing letters to their pen friends.
Converting this time to hours, we get: 7 hours/week x 7 days/week = 49 hours/week or approximately 140 hours over one star (a period of seven days)."

Explanation:
According to the question, Jason has a monthly phone plan with 1000 minutes of talk time. He spends 15 minutes talking to his grandmother every day, which is 90 minutes per week (7 days x 15 minutes/day). Since there are 30 days in this particular month, Jason's total daily talk time is 90 minutes/day x 30 days = 2700 minutes.
Now, we need to subtract the amount of time he spends talking to other people. The question states that he uses an additional 300 minutes of talk time with other people during the month. So, the total amount of time Jason can use for calls and messages is 1000 minutes - 300 minutes = 700 minutes.
Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason's total monthly call time is 700 minutes / 30 days = 23 minutes per day. Therefore, if there were 30 days in the month, Jason would have 23 minutes remaining after using all his allocated minutes."

Explanation:
According to the question, Griffin has 24 articles and Kyle has 5 articles. If Ginger gives Griffin twice as many articles as he has, then Ginger gives Griffin 24 x 2 = 48 articles. Since Colby has fewer than Kyle by three pieces, Colby has 5 - 3 = 2 articles. Therefore, the total number of articles that Griffin has is 48 + 2 = 50 articles. Finally, since the last statement says that Griffin has 27 articles, we can deduce that Griffin has 50 - 27 = 23 more articles than he initially had."

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

1. There are four water tanks (A, B, C, and D).
2. Each water tank has either two or three fish.
3. Water tank A has twice as many fish as water tank B.
4. Water tank B has 32 fish.
5. The total number of fish in all four water tanks is equal.

Now, let's use this information to find the number of fish in each water tank:

Water Tank A: Since it has twice as many fish as water tank B, there are 2 x 32 = 64 fish in water tank A.
Water Tank B: As mentioned earlier, water tank B has 32 fish.
Water Tank C: Since water tank C does not have any fish according to the problem statement, there are no fish in water tank C.
Water Tank D: Similarly, since water tank D does not have any fish according to the problem statement, there are no fish in water tank D.

So, the total number of fish in all four water tanks is: 64 + 32 + 0 + 0 = 96 fish.
Therefore, each water tank has: 96 / 4 = 24 fish."

Explanation:
Jean receives $250 per hour for his work as an animator. To complete one episode of the cartoon series, he needs to spend 6 hours per day for 4 weeks, which is equivalent to 96 hours in total. Since each episode requires $250 x 96 = 23,000 USD worth of animation work, Jean earns a discount of $23,000 - $12,500 = $10,500 for completing the entire series. Therefore, Jean's total earnings are $10,500 + $250 x 96 = $3750 USD."
