Explanation: To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of each glass and then multiply it by the number of glasses he wants to buy. Since one glass costs $5, and every second glass is only 60% of the price, we can use that information to determine the cost of each subsequent glass. Therefore, if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will have to pay $80 (16 x ($5 + $2.40))."

"Response: 16 hours and 40 minutes
Explanation:
Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so it will take her 200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes to download the file. However, since Windows forced her to restart during the download process, she has to start from the beginning, which means that the total time required for downloading is 100 minutes + (40% of the remaining distance) x (time taken for restart) = 100 minutes + (40% of 80 GB) x 20 min = 16 hours and 40 minutes."
"Response: 15 miles
Explanation: Let's analyze the given information step by step:

* Time taken to travel in the first 2 hours = 2 hours (as he spent 2 hours in traffic)
* Speed during the last 2 hours = 80 mph (as he traveled for 2 hours with a speed of 80 mph)
* Distance traveled in the last 2 hours = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 2 hours = 160 miles
* Total distance traveled = Distance traveled in the last 2 hours + Distance traveled in the first 2 hours = 160 miles + 2xdistance traveled in the first 2 hours

Since we are given that he took 3 hours to reach his destination, we can deduce that he traveled at a constant speed throughout the journey, which means he covered equal distances in each hour. Therefore, we can calculate the distance traveled in the first 2 hours as follows:

Distance traveled in the first 2 hours = Total distance traveled / Number of hours taken = 160 miles / 3 hours = 53.33 miles

Now, let's find out how far he is from his home at the end of 4 hours:

Distance traveled in the last 2 hours = 160 miles
Adding this to the distance traveled in the first 2 hours gives us the total distance traveled:
Total distance traveled = 53.33 miles + 160 miles = 213.33 miles

Finally, dividing the total distance traveled by the time taken gives us the average speed:
Average speed = Total distance traveled / Time taken = 213.33 miles / 4 hours = 53.33 miles/hour

Therefore, John is 15 miles away from his home at the end of 4 hours."

Explanation: To calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to subtract the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) from the total revenue he will generate in one year ($1,5 x 7 = $10,5). Then, we divide this amount by the annual maintenance cost ($3):
$10,5 / $3 = 6 years
Therefore, Carlos will start making money from his lemon tree after 6 years."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, when Polly holds the amethyst stone, she can throw her gold spear 3 times farther than when she doesn't hold it. This means that if Polly is standing at a distance of 400 feet from the dragon and throws her gold spear without holding any stones, then the maximum distance she could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold spear would be:

Distance = 400 feet x 3 = 1200 feet

Therefore, the answer is 500 feet (since we rounded up to the nearest foot)."

A truck with a full load of boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass through the bridge. (So the total weight of the truck and its cargo is 3755 pounds.)
To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, we need to divide the weight of the truck and its cargo by the weight of each box:
Maximum number of boxes = Total weight of truck and cargo / Weight of each box
= 3755 pounds / 15 pounds per box
= 256 boxes
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 256."

"Response: 
Judy teaches 5 classes of dance per day during the workweek and 8 classes on Saturday. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15 per student, how much money does she make in one week?

Step-by-step solution:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Number of classes taught per day = 5 (workweek) + 8 (Saturday) = 13
* Number of students per class = 15
* Charged amount per student = $15

Now, let's calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in one week:
Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class
= 13 x 15
= 195

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Judy makes in one week:
Total amount earned = Total number of students x Charged amount per student
= 195 x $15
= $2,875

Therefore, Judy makes $2,875 in one week by teaching 13 classes with an average of 15 students per class, charging $15 per student."

Jika teman keempat menekan bel 60 kali, maka total lonceng yang dibuat oleh bel adalah 60x + 60(y + z) = 60(x + y + z).
From the information provided, we know that x = 20, y = 1/4, and z = 10. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

Explanation: Let's assume that Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by x percentages over the past four years. We know that Adrien's salary is currently 30% higher than Lylah's, which means his current salary is (1 + 0.3) \* $40,000 = $56,000. Four years ago, Adrien's salary was (1 + 0.3) \* $40,000 / 1.3 = $39,600. Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 - ($39,600 / 1.3) = $30,000. Now, let's calculate their new salaries: Adrien's new salary is (1 + x) \* $56,000 = $65,600, and Lylah's new salary is (1 + x) \* $30,000 = $36,000. Since Adrien's increase is greater than Lylah's, we can conclude that x > 0.5. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned in the last four years is: Adrien's new salary - Adrien's old salary = $65,600 - $39,600 = $26,000, and Lylah's new salary - Lylah's old salary = $36,000 - $30,000 = $6,000. So the total amount of money they earned in the last four years is $26,000 + $6,000 = $32,000."

"Response: 15 minutes
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steve is 3 miles away from school and can ride his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim is 2 miles away from school and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take for Steve to reach school, we need to divide the distance between Steve's location and school by his speed:
Distance = 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 7.08 minutes
Since Tim is closer to school than Steve, he will reach school first. We can calculate the time it takes for Tim to reach school using the same formula:
Distance = 2 miles / 264 ft/min = 7.59 minutes
Therefore, if Tim starts racing as soon as Steve leaves, it will take him 7.59 minutes to reach school. Since Steve has already left 7.08 minutes ago, Tim will arrive at school after 0.51 minutes (or 30 seconds)."

"Response: 18750
Explanation: To calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month, we need to find out the total amount of debt she has and then divide it by the number of months in a year (12). For the pinjaman study, the minimum payment is $300 per month, for the credit card it's $200 per month, and for the mortgage it's $500 per month. So, the total amount of debt Jessica needs to pay each month is: Total Debt = Pinjaman Study + Credit Card + Mortgage = $300 x 12 + $200 x 12 + $500 x 12 = $18750 per year. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will have to pay $2794 ($18750 x 1.5) per year or $2336 per month."

Explanation: According to the problem statement, Jerry is throwing darts at a target with six sides. The probability of him hitting an odd number is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of him hitting two consecutive even numbers is also 1/2 since there are only three even numbers in total (0, 2, and 4). Therefore, the probability that he will hit more than 3 greater than 3 is 1 - (1/2) × (1/2) = 60%."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 3 groups of mice and each group has 3 mice. Therefore, the total number of mice is 3 x 3 = 9. Since each mouse is given 6 pieces of food, the total amount of food given to all mice is 9 x 6 = 54. Since there are also 20 pieces of food distributed among the rabbits, the remaining 108 pieces of food (54 + 54) are divided equally among the 10 cages of hamsters, resulting in 108 / 10 = 10.8 pieces of food per cage. Therefore, there are 10 cages of hamsters, which means that there are 10 x 10 = 100 hamsters in total."

Explanation: To find the total cost of buying half a dozen (3) cups at $1.200 each, we need to multiply the number of cups by their individual price and then divide that result by 2 since there are only half a dozen cups being bought. So, the calculation is as follows:
Total cost = Number of cups x Individual cup price / Number of cups in a dozen
= 3 x $1.200 / 2
= $4800
Therefore, the total cost of buying half a dozen cups at $1.200 each is $4800."

Explanation: To calculate the total amount that Mark paid for all 12 cars, you need to multiply the number of cars by their price ($20,000 x 12 = $240,000). Then, you subtract the taxes paid on each car (10% of $20,000 = $2,000) and the registration fee for each car ($1,000 x 12 = $12,000). Therefore, the total amount that Mark paid is $240,000 - $2,000 - $12,000 = $360,000."
