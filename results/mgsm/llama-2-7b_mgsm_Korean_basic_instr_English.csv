Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
* Jenny's eggs are 16 per day.
* She eats 3 eggs every morning with her friends.
* The remaining eggs are sold at $2 each per day.

So, the total number of eggs sold by Jenny per day is:
16 (eggs produced) - 3 (eggs eaten) = 13

Sold at $2 each, the daily revenue from egg sales is:
13 x $2 = $26

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny makes from selling eggs per day is $26."

Explanation: James decides to run 3 times a week for 7 days, with each run being 3 kilometers long. Therefore, he will cover a total distance of 3 x 3 km = 9 km per week. Since there are 7 weeks in a month, James will cover a total distance of 9 km / 7 = 1.27 km per day."
"Response: 60 cups (or 960 ml)
Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, Wendy feeds her chickens 3 cups of food each day, and she does this three times a day. Therefore, the total amount of food that Wendy feeds her chickens per day is:

3 cups/day x 3 meals/day = 9 cups/day

Since there are 8 hours in a day, we can calculate the number of cups of food that Wendy feeds her chickens per hour as follows:

9 cups/day / 8 hours/day = 1.125 cups/hour

Now, let's assume that Wendy has 20 chickens. To determine how many cups of food she needs to feed them per day, we need to divide the total amount of food by the number of chickens:

9 cups/day / 20 chickens = 0.45 cups/chicken/day

Finally, since Wendy feeds her chickens for 24 hours, we can multiply the number of cups of food needed per chicken per day by 24 hours to get the total amount of food needed for all 20 chickens:

0.45 cups/chicken/day x 24 hours/day = 10.8 cups/day

Therefore, Wendy needs to feed her 20 chickens approximately 10.8 cups of food per day. Since there are 8 fluid ounces (fl oz) in a cup, we can convert this value to fl oz as follows:

10.8 cups x 8 fl oz/cup = 87.2 fl oz/day

So, Wendy needs to feed her 20 chickens approximately 87.2 fl oz of food per day."

"Response: 56 miles
Explanation:
John drove at an average speed of 30 mph for the first 2 hours and then increased his speed to 80 mph for the remaining 4 hours. Since he traveled for a total of 6 hours, we can calculate the distance traveled as follows:
Distance = Speed x Time

Distance = 120 miles + 320 miles
Distance = 440 miles
Therefore, John's house is approximately 56 miles away from where he started driving."

"Response: 18769750
Explanation:
Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. The person has been working for the same company for 40 years, so they have earned $5 million in annual bonuses.
2. From year 20 to 30, the person receives 5% of their total bonus amount as an annuity each year. So, they receive $250,000 ($5 million x 5%) every year for 10 years.
3. After 30 years, the person retires and receives their entire accumulated bonus amount as an annuity. Since they received $250,000 each year for 10 years, their total accumulated bonus amount is $2.5 million ($250,000 x 10).
4. Therefore, the person's total accumulated bonus amount after 40 years of work is $7.5 million ($5 million + $2.5 million).
5. Finally, to calculate the amount the person will receive as an annuity at age 65 (30 years after retirement), we multiply their total accumulated bonus amount by the factor of 1 / (1 + 0.05)^30, which gives us $18769750.

So, the person will receive $18769750 as an annuity when they turn 65 years old, assuming they continue to earn $5 million per year in bonuses for 40 years before retiring."

Explanation:
Let's calculate the total cost of all three types of flowers sold by Artie:

* Marigold: 12 x $2.74 = $32.08
* Petunia: 9 x $1.87 = $16.53
* Begonia: 17 x $2.12 = $35.24
Total cost = $32.08 + $16.53 + $35.24 = $83.85
Since Artie is selling everything for $1 dollar each, he will make a profit of:
Profit = Total cost - Price = $83.85 - $1 = $83.85
Therefore, if Artie sells 12 marigolds, 9 petunias, and 17 begonias, he will make a profit of $83.85."

If they both ate all their rolls, then the total number of rolls eaten by both of them would be 14 + 14 = 28 rolls. Since there are 24 rolls in each of Beatrice's two batches, if Beatrice also ate all her rolls, then the total number of rolls eaten by Beatrice would be 24 x 2 = 48 rolls. Therefore, the total number of rolls eaten by all three of them together would be 28 + 48 = 76 rolls."
"Response: 50 liters
Explanation:
The boat travels 20 feet (6.2 meters) in 16 seconds, which means it moves at a speed of 3.75 feet per second (1.14 meters per second). Since the boat is 10 feet (3 meters) wide, its cross-sectional area is 10 x 3 = 30 square feet (2.8 square meters). Therefore, the volume of water displaced by the boat in one second is 30 / 3.75 = 8 cubic feet (0.23 cubic meters) per second.
Since the boat travels for 64 seconds to reach the shore, it displaces 8 x 64 = 512 cubic feet (14.9 cubic meters) of water. To convert this to liters, we divide by 1000, since there are 1000 liters in 1 cubic meter: 512 / 1000 = 0.512 cubic meters or 50 liters."

"Response: 96
Explanation:
Katy uses 7:13 ratio to make coffee with sugar and water. If she uses 1/2 cup of sugar (which is equal to 8 ounces) and 4 cups of water (which is equal to 32 ounces), then the total amount of liquid used by Katy would be:

8 ounces + 32 ounces = 40 ounces

Since Katy uses 1/2 cup of sugar, the number of tablespoons of sugar used can be calculated as follows:

1/2 cup / 16 tablespoons per cup = 3.75 tablespoons

Therefore, the number of tablespoons of sugar used by Katy is:

3.75 tablespoons x 120 ounces = 450 grams

So, the answer is 96."

"Response: 3000$/day
Explanation:
The hospital sees 500 patients per day and each patient is observed for an average of 24 minutes. The doctors charge $150 per hour and the hospital charges $200 per hour to patients. To calculate the total revenue of the hospital, we need to multiply the number of patients seen per day by the time they are observed per day, then multiply that result by the charging rate of both doctors and hospital.
So, the total revenue of the hospital per day would be:
500 patients/day x 24 min/patient = 12,000 minutes/day
12,000 minutes/day x ($150/hour + $200/hour) = $3000/day"

* Chips x 2 = $3.00
* Cookies x 2 = $2.00
Total food cost = $20.00
* Additional delivery fee = $10.00 (20% of $50.00)

Therefore, the estimated total cost of the order is approximately $43.89 ($30.00 + $10.00)."
"Response: 23
Explanation:
The first test consisted of 75 questions and Mark completed it in 8 hours. Therefore, he completed 75/8 = 9.375 questions per hour.
For the second test, Mark completed 100 questions in 6 hours, so he completed 100/6 = 16.667 questions per hour.
Since Mark had 100 minutes to complete both tests (i.e., 8 hours for the first test + 6 hours for the second test), we can calculate the number of unanswered questions as follows:
Unanswered questions = Total time taken for both tests / Time taken to complete one test
= 8 + 6
= 14 hours
= 14 x 9.375 (questions per hour)
= 130.25 questions
Therefore, Mark left 130.25 - 75 = 55.25 unanswered questions after completing the two tests."

* A bird stole half of what was left from Dave.
* Three birds shared three potato chips each.
* Rakuten took three-quarters of what was left.
* The ants took the last French fry.

From this information, we can calculate that there were initially 14 + (half of 14) = 28 potato chips left after Dave ate his share.
Then, three birds shared three chips each, so there were 28 - 9 = 19 chips left.
Rakuten took three-quarters of the remaining chips, which is equal to 19 x 3/4 = 13 chips.
Finally, the ants took the last French fry, leaving none for anyone else.
Therefore, the total number of potato chips that Dave had when he started eating them is 50 (14 + 28 + 13)."

"Response: 127 dollars
Explanation: If Jackie spends $90 to hire an accountant and saves $3 per hour by not working as a freelancer, she will save $6 per hour ($3 x 2). Therefore, if she works for 3 hours less per week, she will earn $189 less in income (($3 x 2) x 3 = $189). So, by hiring an accountant, Jackie can earn $127 more than if she handled her taxes herself (=$189 - $90)."

"Response:  $48,750$
Explanation:
To calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month, we need to consider her three sources of debt: student loans, credit card debt, and mortgage debt. Let's assume that she wants to pay at least 50% of each payment towards these debts.

Student Loan Debt: $300/month x 12 months = $3,600/year
Credit Card Debt: $200/month x 12 months = $2,400/year
Mortgage Debt: $500/month x 12 months = $6,000/year
Total Annual Debt Payment: $3,600 + $2,400 + $6,000 = $11,000

Since Jessica wants to pay at least 50% of each payment towards her debts, she will need to make monthly payments of:

$11,000 / 0.5 = $22,000/year

Therefore, Jessica will need to pay $22,000 per year to meet her minimum debt payments. To determine how much she needs to pay each month, we can divide this amount by 12:

$22,000 / 12 = $1,833/month

So, Jessica needs to pay at least $1,833 per month for one year to meet her minimum debt payments."

Explanation:
To prepare 60 potatoes for mashed potato barbecue, it takes approximately 1 minute to peel each potato (since there are 60 potatoes in total). Therefore, the total time required to peel all 60 potatoes is 60 minutes. However, it only takes about 5 seconds to cut each potato into small pieces after they have been peeled, so the total time required to cut all 60 potatoes is 300 seconds or 5 minutes. Hence, the total time required to prepare all 60 potatoes for mashed potato barbecue is 49 minutes and 30 seconds."

"Response: 56
Explanation: Let's assume that the two candidates are A and B. If candidate A gets 3/4 of the votes (i.e., 75%), then they get 75/4 = 18.75 votes. Similarly, if candidate B gets the remaining 25%, they get 25/4 = 6.25 votes. Therefore, the total number of votes for both candidates is 18.75 + 6.25 = 25.
Now, let's calculate the percentage of votes that each student gave to the winner (candidate A):
(25 / 80) x 100% = 31.25%
So, the losing candidate (B) got 58.75% of the votes (25 - 18.75)."
"Response: 160
Explanation: Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations, which means she ordered 4 x 20 = 80 red roses. Since she also ordered 200 pink lilies, the total number of flowers that need to be delivered by 5 PM is 80 + 200 = 280."

"Response: 27 seconds
Explanation:
The first team can complete the race in 60 seconds, and each member can run 400 meters in 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the first team to complete the race is 60 + (4 x 55) = 270 seconds.
Since the second team is slower than the first team by 3 seconds per 400 meters, it will take them longer to complete the race. The total time for the second team to complete the race is therefore 270 + (4 x 63) = 390 seconds."
"Response: 0.7143 (approximately)
Explanation:
Let's denote the probability of Jeri throwing a number that is greater than $3$ as $P$.
We know that there are $6$ faces on the dice, and each face has two numbers ($1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $6$). Therefore, the probability of Jeri throwing a particular number is:
$$P = \frac{1}{6}$$
Now, let's consider the probability of Jeri throwing an odd number. Since there are $3$ odd numbers ($1$, $3$, and $5$) out of $6$ possible numbers, the probability of throwing an odd number is:
$$P_o = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$
Similarly, the probability of Jeri throwing an even number is:
$$P_e = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$
The probability of Jeri throwing a number that is greater than $3$ is:
$$P > P_o + P_e = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$$
Therefore, the probability of Jeri throwing a number that is greater than $3$ is approximately $0.7143$."

Since there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrot, the total amount of carrot distributed among all restaurants is 800 pounds (or 360 kg). Therefore, the remaining amount of carrot that is not used is 800 - 40 x 2 = 500 pounds (or 227 kg)."
"Response: 5695
Explanation: According to the question, there are 23786 people in Soda City and 8417 of them are male, which means that 23786 - 8417 = 15369 females. Additionally, since 9092 are female, we can deduce that 15369 / 9092 = 1.69 times as many females as males. Therefore, there are approximately 1.69 x 5695 = 9377 children in Soda City."

Explanation:
Let's break down the calculation for Mark's earnings based on the information provided in the question:

* Mark edits 1000 sentences per day (as stated by the question)
* Publisher A pays Mark $0.05 per sentence (as stated by the question)
* Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A ($0.10 per sentence)

Now, let's calculate Mark's daily earnings from each publisher separately:

For Publisher A:
Mark edits 1000 sentences per day x $0.05 per sentence = $50 per day

For Publisher B:
Mark edits 1000 sentences per day x $0.10 per sentence = $100 per day

So, Mark's total daily earnings are $50 + $100 = $150 per day.

Since Mark works every day of the week, his weekly earnings are:
$150 per day x 7 days per week = $1050 per week

Therefore, Mark's weekly earnings are $1050."

"Response: 40 barrels (or 1600 liters)
Explanation:
Jooshi's vineyard produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and she can produce 2 barrels of wine from each ton of grapes. Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced by Jooshi's vineyard in one year is:
5 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels
Since Jooshi has 10 acres of land for her vineyard, we can calculate the total number of barrels of wine produced as follows:
Total area of vineyard = 10 acres x 43,560 square meters/acre = 435,600 square meters
Number of barrels of wine produced per year = Total area of vineyard x Number of barrels produced per hectare
= 435,600 square meters x 10 barrels/hectare = 4,356,000 barrels
Therefore, Jooshi's vineyard produces approximately 40 barrels (or 1600 liters) of wine per year."

"Response: 175 km
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate Michael's total distance traveled as follows:

* For the first 4 weeks, he rode his bike for 5 days a week and covered an average of 25 km per day, so he traveled a total distance of 5 \* 25 = 125 km.
* After that, he decided to ride only twice a week, but each time he covered 60 km, so in total he traveled 2 \* 60 = 120 km during this period.
* Therefore, Michael's total distance traveled is 125 + 120 = 245 km.
Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us 250 km, which is closest to the actual answer of 175 km."

"Response: 6 months
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Sarah has already saved $10 and wants to buy a new dress and shoes worth $30 and $20 respectively. To calculate the time it takes for her to save enough money to buy these items, we need to know how much she earns from babysitting and how often she does it.
From the question, we learn that Sarah earns $5 per time she babysits, and she has babysat 4 times so far. Therefore, she has earned a total of $20 ($5 x 4). Additionally, her parents give her $4 every time she cuts her hair, which means she has earned an additional $40 ($4 x 10). So, in total, Sarah has earned $60 ($20 + $40).
Since Sarah wants to buy the dress and shoes together, and they cost $50 in total, it will take her 6 months (or 6/60 = 0.1) to save enough money to buy them if she continues to babysit and cut her hair at the same rate."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jeremy collects 42 eggs per day and has 10 white ducks that lay 5 eggs each per day. Therefore, Jeremy collects 42 x 10 = 420 eggs per day. Since red ducks lay 3 eggs each per day and there are 2 more red ducks than white ducks, the total number of eggs laid by red ducks is 2 x 3 = 6 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs collected by Jeremy is 420 + 6 = 426 eggs per day."

Explanation: According to the passage, Sloan had 100 customers on the first day, and then an additional 50 customers on each of the next two days, for a total of 300 customers by the third day. Therefore, on the third day, she had 200 more customers than on the first day."
"Response: 12 gallons
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The big swimming pool has twice as much water as the small swimming pool.
* 4 minutes ago, the big swimming pool had 3 times as much water as the small swimming pool.
* Now, the big swimming pool has 4 times as much water as the small swimming pool.

From these statements, we can deduce that the amount of water in the small swimming pool is decreasing at a rate of 1/4 gallon per minute. Therefore, after 4 minutes, the small swimming pool will have lost 4 x 1 = 4 gallons of water.

So, the current amount of water in the small swimming pool is:
Small swimming pool: 8 gallons (initial amount) - 4 gallons (lost in 4 minutes) = 4 gallons

Therefore, the answer to the question is 4 gallons."

"Response: 43789.25
Explanation:
The formula to calculate the outstanding balance is as follows:
Outstanding Balance = Initial Amount + Monthly Payments - Total Interest Paid
In this case, the initial amount is $2000, and the monthly payments are $165 for 12 months. The total interest paid is $100 (10% of $2000), so the outstanding balance after 12 months is:
Outstanding Balance = $2000 + ($165 x 12) - $100 = $43789.25
Therefore, the outstanding balance after 12 months is $43789.25."
"Response: 32 flowers.
Explanation:
The passage states that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 daisies outside of it. Since each rose has 5 petals and each daisy has 6 petals, we can calculate the total number of petals as follows:
Roses: 4 x 5 = 20 petals
Daisies: 7 x 6 = 42 petals
Adding both numbers gives us a total of 62 petals. Since each flower has 5 or 6 petals, depending on whether it is a rose or a daisy, we can conclude that there are 62 / 5 = 12 flowers (or 62 / 6 = 10 flowers) in the vase plus the 7 daisies outside of it, for a total of 19 (or 10) flowers in the picture."

"Response: 16 (or 8)
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* In one aquarium, there are 4 fish.
* In another aquarium, there are 32 fish.
* The difference between the number of fish in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in the second aquarium.

Now, let's use this information to find out how many fish are in each aquarium:

Aquarium 1: 4 fish
Aquarium 2: 32 - 4 = 28 fish

So, there are 16 fish in Aquarium 1 and 8 fish in Aquarium 2."
"Response: 3750$
Explanation:
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours a day, Monday through Friday, for a total of 4 weeks. Therefore, the total amount paid to the makeup artist is:

$250/hour x 6 hours/day x 4 days/week = $6,000/week
$6,000/week x 5 weeks = $30,000

After the movie is completed, the makeup artist gives the actress a discount of 10%, which means they receive $27,000 ($30,000 x 90%). So the actress pays a total of $37,500 ($30,000 + $7,500)."
Response: 70 + 69 + 8 = 157 dollars.
"Response: 60 pounds (or 27 kilograms) of vegetables were purchased.
Explanation:
The total weight of the vegetables is given as 4 x 50 = 200 pounds (or 90 kilograms). Since each pound of vegetables costs $1.50, the total cost of the vegetables is 200 x $1.50 = $300. Therefore, the yori-san spent $300 to purchase 60 pounds (or 27 kilograms) of vegetables."
"Response: 680 calories
Explanation:
On Monday, she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.
On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.
In total, she ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.
If each cookie contains 200 calories, then she ate a total of 46 x 200 = 9,200 calories.
Therefore, she consumed 9,200 - 9,000 = 200 more calories than her sister."
