Response:  Firstly, we know that Janet lays 16 eggs per day. Then, she consumes 3 of them as breakfast, leaving 13 eggs remaining. Next, she uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends, which means there are only 9 eggs left after this process (13 - 4 = 9). Finally, she sells all these remaining eggs at the farmer's market for $2 each, so the total amount of money she makes from selling those eggs is:  9 x $2 = $18. Therefore, Janet makes $18 at the farmers' market every day.
Response:  The robe requires 2/2 = 1 bolt of blue fiber and (1/2) \* 1 = 0.5 bolts of white fiber. So altogether, we need 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 bolts to make the robe.
Response:  The original cost of the house is $80,000. After putting in $50,000 worth of repairs, the new value of the house is 150% more than its original value. So if we multiply the original price by that percentage increase, we get the new value of the house after renovation: New Value = Original Price x Percentage Increase = $80,000 x 150% = $120,000 Now, let's find out how much profit Josh made by selling the renovated house: Profit = Selling Price - Original Cost = ($120,000 - $80,000) = $40,000 Therefore, Josh made a profit of $40,000 from flipping the house.
"Response:  
James runs 3 sprints per week and each sprint is 60 meters long. So, in one week, James will have run a total of 3 x 60 = 180 meters.  "
Response:  If Wendi has 20 chickens, then everyday she needs to give 3 times 20 = 60 cups of feed per day. So for the final meal of the day, she will need 60 - (15 + 25) = 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed. Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.  
"Response:  If one glass costs $5 and every second glass costs 60% of its original price, then the cost of two glasses will be:
$5 x 2 = $10 (first glass) + ($5 x 60%) = $3 (second glass)
So, the total cost of 4 glasses will be: $10 + $3 + $3 + $3 = $19
Now, if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate their total cost as follows:
$19 x 16 = $288
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $288 for 16 glasses."
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x = 4 × = 8 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 × = 16 sheep. Finally, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep, so Seattle has 20 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is: 8 + 16 + 20 = 54.
"Response:  The total size of the file that Carla needs to download is 200 GB. If we assume that Carla normally can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute, then the time taken to download the entire file would be:
Time = Total Size / Download Rate
= 200 GB / 2 GB/min
= 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes)
Now, when Windows forced a restart to install updates, the download was interrupted after 40% of the way through, so the remaining amount to be downloaded is:
Remaining Size = Total Size x (1 - Interruption Percentage)
= 200 GB x (1 - 0.40)
= 130 GB
The time taken to download this remaining portion will be:
Time = Remaining Size / Download Rate
= 130 GB / 2 GB/min
= 65 minutes (or 1 hour and 8 minutes)
Therefore, the total time taken for Carla to download the file including the interruption is:
Total Time = Time before Interruption + Time after Interruption
= 100 minutes + 65 minutes
= 165 minutes (or 2 hours and 45 minutes)"
Response:  Firstly, we know that John drove for 3 hours initially at a speed of $60 \text{ mph} = 9.72 \text{ km/h}$. Now, during the second leg of his journey, he spent $2 \text{ hours}$ stuck in traffic, which means he didn't cover any distance during this period. So, the total distance covered by John during these $4 \text{ hours}$ can be calculated as follows: Distance = Speed x Time $\therefore$ Distance = $(9.72 \text{ km/h}) \times (2 \text{ hours})$ = $19.44 \text{ km}$ Now, since John was able to drive at a speed of $80 \text{ mph}$ for the last $2 \text{ hours}$, we can calculate the distance covered during this period as follows: Distance = Speed x Time $\therefore$ Distance = $(80 \text{ mph}) \times ($ $2 \text{ hours}$) = $160 \text{ km}$ Therefore, the total distance traveled by John after $4 \text{ hours}$ of driving is equal to $19.44 + 160 = $179.44 \text{ km}.
"Response:  For the first 40 hours that Eliza works at $10/hour, her total earnings would be: 
$10 x 40 = $400  
For the remaining 5 hours (from 40 to 45), Eliza will receive 1.2 times her regular hourly rate in overtime pay: 
$10 x 5 = $50   
So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are: 
$400 + $50 = $450"
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads. So, if it tripled to 180 downloads in the second month (3 x 60 = 180), and then decreased by 30% to 126 downloads in the third month (180 - 30% = 126). Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three-month period is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.
"Response:  The total number of pastries that Toula bought is given as follows:
Donuts = 3 x 12 = 36
Mini cupcakes = 2 x 12 = 24
Mini cheesecakes = 6 x 6 = 36
The total cost of all these pastries can be calculated as follows:
Cost of donuts = $68 x 36 = $2372
Cost of mini cupcakes = $80 x 24 = $1920
Cost of mini cheesecakes = $55 x 36 = $1920
Total cost = $2372 + $1920 + $1920 = $6112
Therefore, the total cost of all the pastries that Toula bought is $6112."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much revenue Carlos gets from selling lemons per year. So, total number of lemons produced = 7 lemons/year x Total Number Of Years =? Now, let's find out the total revenue earned from selling those lemons in one year. Revenue = Total Number Of Lemons Produced x Selling Price Per Lemon = 7 lemons/yr x $1.5/lemon = $10.5 per year. Next, we need to subtract the annual cost of caring for the tree (watering + feeding) from the total revenue earned every year. Annual Cost = Watering + Feeding = $3 per year. Subtracting this amount from the total revenue earned gives us the net income or profit made by Carlos after one year. Net Income = Total Revenue - Annual Cost = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year. Since Carlos wants to know when he will start making money on his lemon tree, we have to divide the initial investment ($90) by the net income he makes annually. Therefore, the number of years required to break even = Initial Investment / Net Income per Year = $90 / $7.5 = 12 years. Hence, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on his lemon tree.
Response:  We know that Melanie started selling vacuum cleaners at the green house, where she sold a third of them (3/6). Then, she went to the red house and sold 2 more (2 + 3 = 5). Finally, she went to the orange house and sold half of what was left (5 / 2 = 2 1/2). So, in total, Melanie sold 3 + 2 + 2 1/2 = 7 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, she started with 7 x 7 = 49 vacuum cleaners.
"Response:  The total number of students is 20. 
* 20% of them are enrolled in contemporary dance = 4 (since there are 20 students)
* Of the remaining 16 students, 25% are enrolled in jazz dance = 4 (since there are 16 students)
* So, the total number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 8 (since there are 20 students). Therefore, 8/20 or 40% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"Response:  The cost of purchasing jewelry is $5,000 and the cost of buying electronics is $8,000. In both cases, we are considering the price increase in percentage terms. So let's calculate the expected value of each option based on their respective markets.
Jewelry Market Expected Value = $5,000 x (1 + 2.5%) = $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125
Electronic Gadget Market Expected Value = $8,000 x (1 + 1.2%) = $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,369
Now, if the merchant chooses either option, they can sell it for its current market value at the end of the month. Based on the expected values calculated above, the maximum profit the merchant could make from selling these items is as follows:
Maximum Profit = Selling Price - Purchase Price
For Jewelry: Maximum Profit = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
For Electronic Gadgets: Maximum Profit = $8,369 - $8,000 = $369
Therefore, the answer is $125 for choosing the jewelry option and $369 for choosing the electronic gadget option."
Response:  On Day 1, both trains cover 80 miles while traveling westward. So, Train A covers 80 miles and Train B covers 80 miles as well since they are traveling together. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains on Day 1 is 160 miles (80 + 80). Now, on Day 2, both trains cover additional distances of 150 miles while traveling northward. Since they are still traveling together, we can assume that Train A covers half of this distance, which is 75 miles (since it takes twice as long to cover 75 miles as it does to cover 37.5 miles). Similarly, Train B also covers half of the remaining distance, which is 75 miles. Thus, the total distance traveled by Train A on Day 2 is 75 + 75 = 150 miles, and the total distance traveled by Train B on Day 2 is also 150 miles. In summary, the distance covered by each train over the two days is: Train A - 160 + 150 = 310 miles Train B - 160 + 150 = 310 miles
Response:  As a teacher, Jill makes $20/hour x 35 hours = $700 per week. As a coach, she makes $30/hour x 15 hours = $450 per week. So, in total, Jill earns $700 + $450 = $1,150 per week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, Jill's annual income is $1,150 x 50 = $57,500.
Response:   1 dozen = 12 eggs. So, if Claire eats 3 egg omelets per day, then she will eat 3 x 21 = 63 eggs in one week.  Therefore, in 4 weeks, she will eat 63 x 4 = 252 eggs.
Response:  The total distance of the hike is 12 miles. Marissa has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. To find out how long it will take her to cover this distance at an average speed of 4 miles/hour, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, time = 6 miles / 4 mph = 1.5 hours or 90 minutes. Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 4 miles per hour for the remaining distance of 6 miles in order to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour throughout the entire hike.
Response:  The total amount of liquid we started with was 10 + 15 = 25 liters (not including the liter that got spilled). Since some of this was orange drink, which contains two-thirds water, the volume of orange drink is 25 x ⅔ = 16.67 liters. So far, we have 25 - 16.67 = 9 liters of orange drink left. Now, when you poured the orange drink into the pineapple drink, you lost one liter due to spilling. Therefore, the total volume of both liquids combined after mixing is 9 + 15 = 24 liters.
Response:  We know that Raymon... (read more)
Response:  On Tuesday, Billy sold x DVDs. The first three customers bought one DVD each, so they purchased 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 DVDs total. Then, the next two customers bought 2 DVDs each, for a total of 4 DVDs. Finally, the last three customers didn't buy any DVDs. Therefore, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs. So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.
"Response:  The candle is going to melt at a rate of 2 cm/hour. So in one hour (from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm), the candle will melt 2 cm. Now we need to find out how much the candle will have melted between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm. We can do this by multiplying the time interval (in hours) by the rate of melting per hour (also expressed as an hour). Therefore, the distance traveled by the candle during this period would be: Distance = Rate x Time Interval = 2 cm/hr x 3 hrs = 6 cm. 
Therefore, the candle will be 6 cm shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
Response:  The original price of the book = $X. Since it has a 25% discount, we can write: X - (25/100)X = $19.50. Simplifying and solving for X gives us: X = $24. So, the original price of the book was $24 before the 25% discount.
"Response:  We know that Marie paid a total of $50 for all her purchases. From the information given in the problem, we can write an equation using the prices of the items Marie bought:

$12 + (5 x $3) + ($1.50 x 4) = $50

Now, let's substitute the value of $8.50 for the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered:

$12 + (5 x $3) + ($1.50 x 4) - ($8.50 x 1) = $50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$12 + $15 + $6 = $50

Solving for $8.50, we find that Marie ordered 9 boxes of pizza. Therefore, the answer is 9."
"Response:  For each item, we know how much it costs per pair (shorts = $16.50, pants = $22.50, shoes = $42). So, to find out how much Mishka spent on all these items, we need to multiply the cost per pair with the number of pairs she bought:
Mishka spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on shorts.
Mishka spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on pants.
Mishka spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes.
In total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 on all her clothing items."
Response:  Since Cynthia has been eating ice cream for 60 days, and there are 15 servings in each carton, then she has consumed 900 servings (60 x 15) of ice cream during this period. Now, we need to calculate her total expenditure on ice cream. Therefore, we multiply the number of servings by the cost per serving, which is $4.00 per carton. So, her total expenditure on ice cream would be:  900 servings x $4.00/serving = $3,600.00. 
"Response:  The distance traveled is given as 60 miles. We know that Henry made two stops because it says ""He first stopped after 20 miles"" and ""His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip."" So we can set up an equation using these statements: Distance = Total distance - First stop + Second stop (where First stop refers to the distance from the starting point to where Henry first stopped) + Second stop (the distance from where Henry last stopped to the end of the trip). Now let's substitute values for each variable based on what we know: Distance = 60 miles - x + y (where x is the distance from start to first stop, and y is the distance from first stop to end of trip) Substituting values: Distance = 60 miles - x + y Since Henry first stopped after 20 miles, x = 20 miles. And since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, y = 45 miles. Therefore, the distance between Henry's first and second stops is 45 miles."
Response:  The total cost of both pairs of heels = $5 (given). One pair costs $33 + $66 = $100 (given). So, if we subtract $100 from $5, we get $45. Therefore, the boots cost $45.
"Response:  The given information states that Darrell's age is 7 times Allen's age. So, if Allen's current age is x, then Darrell's age is 7x. 
The sum of both their ages is equal to 162, so we can write an equation as follows: 7x + x = 162. 
Solving for x (Allen's age), we get: x = 24. Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 34."
"Response:  The number of jelly beans in the jar can be represented as x. Since Gunter asked three people for their estimates, we have three different answers: 80, 160 (which is 20 more than half of 80), and 130 (which is 25% more than 80). To find the average estimate, we need to add these numbers together and divide by the total number of estimates. So, let's do that:
x + 80 + 160 + 130 =?
= 470
Now, divide this sum by the total number of estimates:
470 / 4 = 117.5
So, based on the given information, the average estimate of the number of jelly beans in the jar is approximately 117.5."
Response:  If John takes care of 10 dogs, then each dog requires half an hour (or 0.5) of his time per day for walking and caring for its needs. Therefore, in one week, John spends 7 days \* 0.5 hours/dog = 3.5 hours per week taking care of the dogs.
"Response:  We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So if Gretchen has x silver coins, she will have 30 + x gold coins. Since we were told that Gretchen has 110 coins in total, we can set up an equation as follows: 30 + x = 110. Now solve for x using basic arithmetic. 
Solution: To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to subtract the number of silver coins from 110. So, 30 + x = 110, and solving for x gives us: x = 80. Therefore, Gretchen has 80 gold coins."
"Response:  We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so if Aaron has x jewels, Siobhan has x - 2 jewels.  
We also know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, if Raymond has y jewels, Aaron has y + 5 jewels. 
Now we can use the information given in the question to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, and Raymond has 40 jewels, we can write an equation as follows: 
Aaron = (40 / 2) + 5 
Substituting this value for Aaron into the equation above, we get: 
(x - 2) = (40 / 2) + 5 
Simplifying the equation, we get: 
x - 10 = 25 
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 35 
So, Siobhan has 35 jewels."
"Response:  
Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, so his rate of scoring is 4/20 = 1/5 per minute.  
In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than before, which means he scored (1/5) \* (1 + 25%) = 1/5 \* 1.25 = 1.25 points per minute. 
Therefore, Mike scored a total of 4 + 1.25 = 5.25 points in 40 minutes."
Response:  If Terry buys 2 yogurts per day and there are 30 days in a month, then he will buy 60 yogurts (2 x 30) in one month. Now, if these yogurts are currently on sale for $5 each, then Terry will spend $300 on yogurt in one month ($5 x 60). So, Terry spends $300 on yogurt over 30 days.
Response:  If John sold all of his Lego sets for $15 each, he would make $195 in total ($15 x 13 = $195). Then, if he used that money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, he would spend $160 ($20 x 8 = $160). So, after buying the video games, John is left with $35 ($195 - $160 = $35). Therefore, John still has 13 Lego sets.
Response:  We know that John runs for 3 hours on Monday (day 1). So, his speed during this time is $ \frac { distance}{time} = \frac{60}{3} = 20$ mph. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he runs for $\frac {distance}{time} = \frac{60}{x}$ and $\frac {distance}{time} = \frac{60}{y}$, respectively, where $x$ and $y$ are unknown constants. Since he runs for half the time on these days, we can write: $$ \frac {distance}{time} = \frac{60}{x} = \frac{60}{y} = \frac{60}{2} = 30$$ Solving for $x$ and $y$, we get: $x=4$ and $y=8$. Therefore, John's average speed over the entire week is: $$ \boxed{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{60}{3} + \frac{60}{4} + \frac{60}{8} = \boxed{\text{50 mph}} $$
Response:  We know that Dana runs four times faster than she walks, so her rate of speed when running is 4x = 16 miles/hour (since she walks at 3 miles/hour). Now we are told that her skipping rate is half as fast as her running rate, or 2x = 8 miles/hour. So during any given hour, Dana will cover x + y = 9 miles (where x = 8 miles/hour for running and y = 3 miles/hour for walking). Since there are six hours total, Dana will cover a total distance of 6(x + y) = 54 miles (since x + y = 9 miles/hour). Therefore, Dana will be able to travel 54 miles in six hours.
Response:  According to the problem statement, we know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone and Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So if Suzy's iPhone is one year old, then Ben's iPhone must be two years old (since it is twice as old). Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is eight years old (four times as old as Ben's iPhone).
"Response:  When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing ability is increased to x feet (let's call it y). Since the dragon's flame reaches up to 1000 feet away from its location, we can say that the maximum distance beyond which Polly cannot hit the dragon with the gold javelin is equal to the distance between where Polly stands and the point where the dragon's flame ends minus the distance that Polly can throw the javelin without holding the gemstone. So, we have:
x - 1000 = y + 400...(1)
Now, let's solve this equation. We know that x is greater than or equal to zero because Polly must be able to throw the javelin some distance in order to hit the dragon. Substituting this into Equation (1), we get:
y + 400 >= 1000...(2)
Since y represents the additional distance that Polly can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we know that y > 0. Therefore, we can simplify Equation (2):
y >= 600...(3)
So, if Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can stand at least 600 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin."
Response:  If grandma jones baked 5 apples pies, then she has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie in total. After serving herself and her guests, grandma will have 40 - 14 = 26 pieces left. So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.
Response:  We know that one serving size of chips contains 250 calories. Therefore, we must divide the total number of calories in the bag (300 g x 5 servings) by the number of calories in each serving to determine how much we may consume based on our daily calorie goal. So, 300 g / 5 = 60 g or 600 calories. Since we have already eaten 1800 calories, we are left with 1200 calories for the day. Thus, we can safely consume up to 600 more calories from the bag of chips, which equals 670 grams (600 calories / 250 calories/serving).
Response:  First we need to calculate how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax. Since it takes 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax, then Charlie can make 10 x 20 = 200 candles with one pound of beeswax. Now let's find out how much money Charlie spends on supplies. He needs one pound of beeswax and ten wicks, which costs him $10 + $10 = $20. So far, Charlie has spent $20 on supplies. Next, we need to find out how much money Charlie will get from selling those candles. According to the question, Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so he will get $2 x 200 = $400 from selling all those candles. Finally, we subtract the amount Charlie spent on supplies ($20) from the total amount he got from selling the candles ($400), and that gives us Charlie's net profit of $380.
Response:  We know that last week, Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, which means she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours researching and writing those articles. Now let's find out how many articles she wrote on Tuesday. According to the problem, she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, so she wrote (2/5) x 5 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Therefore, she spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours researching and writing articles on Tuesday. Finally, we are told that on Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means she wrote 2 x 28 = 56 articles on Wednesday. So, in total, Meredith spent 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours researching and writing articles during these three days.
"Response:   We know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Then, she bought another package of Post-it notes while en route to work. So, the total number of Post-it notes she acquired is equal to the initial amount plus the additional ones she purchased = 80 + x, where x represents the number of Post-it notes in the new package. 
At work, she used one Post-it note for every cup of coffee (220 cups). Therefore, the number of Post-it notes left after using them all up is equal to the total number of Post-it notes minus the number used for the cups of coffee = 80 + x - 220x. 
Now we are given that Candice had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:  80 + x - 220x = 23. Solving for x, we find that there were 197 Post-it notes in the original package that Candice purchased."
"Response:  
John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so if he bought x blue ties, he also bought 2x red ties.  
The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of one red tie is 1.5 times the cost of one blue tie. 
So, the total cost of the blue ties = $200 (given).
Now, we can find out how much John spent on red ties:
Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties x Cost per red tie
= 2x x ($40 + $20) / 2
= 2x x ($60) / 2
= 4x $30
= $120
Therefore, John spent $120 on ties in total."
Response:  We know that the total length of the wire is 4 feet = 48 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot). Now we are told that the wire was cut into pieces that were each 6 inches long. So, if we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece, we get: Number of pieces = Total length of wire / Length of each piece  Number of pieces = 48 inches / 6 inches  Number of pieces = 8 pieces Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.
Response:  The total number of floors in the building is 15, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is 15 x 8 = 120. Now, we are told that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that 3/4 of 120 = 90 units are occupied. Therefore, there are 120 - 90 = 30 unoccupied units in the building.
Response:  If Lloyd produces 252 eggs per day, then he makes $2 x 252 = $504 per day from his eggs. To find out how much he makes in a week, we can multiply this amount by 7 (the number of days in a week). So Lloyd makes $3,508 per week from his egg farm ($504 x 7).
Response:   The distance he traveled during the first leg was 4 - 1 = 3 miles.  During the return trip, he will travel for 2 hours (from 4 to 6 PM), and his speed is now 6 miles per hour slower than before, so he will cover a distance of 6 x (3/2) = 5 miles.  Therefore, it takes him 3 + 5 = 8 hours to get back.
Response:  The total weight of all items in Uriah's backpack is given as 15 pounds (or 6.8 kg). We know that the comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, so if he removes 30 comics, their total weight would be 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds (or 3.4 kg). Therefore, the remaining weight of the backpack after removing the comics is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds (or 3.4 kg). Since the toys weigh 1/2 pound each, if he removes X toys, their total weight would be X x 1/2 = 3.5 pounds (or 1.6 kg), leaving a remaining weight of 7.5 - 3.5 = 4 pounds (or 1.8 kg) in the backpack. So, he needs to remove 30 toys to bring the weight down to 4 pounds.
Response:  The total number of tires repaired on Thursday = 6 (truck) + 4 (car) = 10.  Total amount earned from tire repairs on Thursday = 6 x $60 = $360 + 4 x $40 = $160 = $520.  Now let's move to Friday. The total number of tires repaired on Friday = 12 (car) = $12 x $40 = $480. So, the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday = $520 - $480 = $40. Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Friday than on Thursday.
"Response:  So far, we know that:
The Doubtfire sisters have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.
Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice as many kittens as the number of kittens adopted by the Doubtfire sisters (3 x 7 = 21).
Trixie, the second cat, has had 12 kittens.
Now, let's add up all these numbers:
Total number of kittens = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40
So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens in total!"
Response:  We know that Jean had 30 lollipops initially and she ate 2 of them. So now, Jean has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. To pack these lollipops into bags, we need to divide them equally among 2 bags. Therefore, Jean can fill 28 / 2 = 14 bags with lollipops.
Response:  Since Peter pays $7 for each movie ticket and $7 for each bag of popcorn, his total cost per trip is $14 (7 + 7). To find out how many trips he can make with $42, we divide $42 by $14: $42 / $14 = 3. So, Peter can go to the movies three times with $42.
Response:  We know that the total weight of the truck (driver + empty truck) = 3755 pounds. Now let's assume that the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is x pounds. Therefore, the total weight of all the boxes plus the weight of the truck must equal to or less than 5000 pounds. So, we have the following equation: 3755 + x = 5000. Solving for x gives us x = 2245 pounds. This means that at most 2245 pounds of boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.
Response:  The original cost of Stephen's groceries is $40.00 (the final bill). Then there is a 25% fee added, which is equal to $10.00 ($40 x 25%). So now the new total is $50.00 ($40 + $10). Next, there are additional delivery fees of $3.00, bringing the total to $53.00 ($50 + $3). Finally, Stephen adds a $4.00 tip, so the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00 ($53 + $4).
Response:  The number of clusters is given as 6, and each cluster contains 20 fruits for a total of 120 fruits in all the clusters (6 x 20 = 120). In addition to these clustered fruits, there are also 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the bush. So, the grand total number of raspberries on the bush is 120 + 67 = 187.
"Response:  The number of good oranges in the basket = Total no. of good oranges - Number of bad oranges - Number of unripe oranges - Number of sour oranges
= 25 - 1 - 4 - 2
= 20
Therefore, there are 20 good oranges in the basket."
"Response:   
Janet paid $500 for the material to make the brooch.  So far, she has spent $500 + $800 = $1300.  Then, she paid 10% of $1300 to get it insured, which is $130.  Therefore, in total, Janet paid $1300 + $130 = $1430."
"Response:  The value of the pension is calculated as follows:
Pension = (Number of years worked x Percentage of pension earned) / Number of years until retirement age
Marcy has worked for 30 years and will retire at age 60. So, we need to calculate the percentage of pension earned each year based on how many years have passed since she started working.
Years Worked Percentage of Pension Earned
1-20 5%
21-30 10%
After 30 years, Marcy earns 15% of the total pension amount. Therefore, the calculation for her annual pension can be represented as follows:
Annual Pension = ($50,000 x 5%) + ($50,000 x 10%) + ($50,000 x 15%)
= $75,000
Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work will be $75,000."
Response:  The streaming business initially costs Aleena $140 each month. Halfway through the year, they charge her 10% less than the previous amount, which is $126 ($140 x 0.9). So in the second half of the year, she pays $126 instead of $140. To find out how much she has paid overall at the conclusion of the year, we must add up both amounts: $140 + $126 = $266. Therefore, by the end of the year, Aleena will have paid a total of $266 for the streaming service.  
"Response:  We are given that Sophia has driven 100 miles since last filling her tank, which means she currently has $X$ gallons of gas left in her tank (where $X$ is the amount of gas left). Since she needs to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again, we have $\boxed{X - 4 = 100}$. Now, let's use the fact that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas to find out how much gas Sophia had at first: $\boxed{X = 12 - (X - 4)}$. Solving for $\boxed{X}$, we get $\boxed{X = 8}$; so Sophia can drive $\boxed{8 \times 4 = 32}$ miles on a single tank of gas."
"Response:  
Jim watches TV for 2 hours per session, so he spends 2 x 3 = 6 hours on TV each week.  
Then, he goes to bed and reads for half as long (i.e., 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour). So, he spends 6 - 1 = 5 hours reading each week. 
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Jim spends 5 x 4 = 20 hours on reading during that time period. 
Now let's calculate how much time he spends on TV: 
He watches TV for 2 hours/session x 3 sessions/week = 6 hours/week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Jim spends 6 x 4 = 24 hours on TV during that time frame. 
So, Jim spends 20 hours reading and 24 hours watching TV in 4 weeks."
Response:  The number of teams = 4 (girls + boys). Number of players per team = 5 x 2 = 10 (5 for each gender). Total number of players = 4 x 10 = 40. Number of coaches = 4 x 1 = 4. Therefore, in total, all of the schools have sent 40 players and 4 coaches to the tournament.
"Response:  We know that there are more diamonds than rubies because it says ""fewer rubies."" So let's assume that the number of rubies is x. Then we can find out how many diamonds there are using the information that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is 2x. Finally, we add up all three numbers to get the total number of gems: 175 + (2x - x) = 355. Solving for x gives us 60 rubies, which means there are 115 diamonds and 90 emeralds in the chest."
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are x girls, then there are 2x boys. The total number of students is given as 60 + 5(students/teacher) = 60 + 300 = 360. Since there are 5 students for every teacher, we can set up the equation: 5x = 360. Solving for x gives us x = 72. So, there are 72 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.
Response:  If Bailey started with x dollars and received a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, then her total amount after 8 weeks is given by the equation: Total = x + (8 \* 5). To find out how much Bailey started with, we can set up the equation: Total = x and solve for x. So, Bailey started with $x = 100.
"Response: 
Judy teaches 5 classes/day x 7 days = 35 classes/week (Monday to Sunday)
Now, let's calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in one week:
35 classes/week x 15 students/class = 525 students/week
Now, we need to find out how much money Judy makes in one week:
525 students/week x $15.00/student = $7,875.00/week
Therefore, Judy makes $7,875.00 in one week."
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions, so it will take 20 steps to follow that recipe. Since the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, we can say that the second recipe has 40 instructions (2 x 20 = 40). Therefore, in total, Kelian needs to read 60 instructions to prepare both dishes (20 + 40 = 60).
Response:  Tommy sold 43 brownies at $3 per slice = $133 (43 x 3). He also sold 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice = $92 (23 x 4). So in total, Tommy raised $225 ($133 + $92)
Response:  The cost of one cell phone is $150 and there are five cell phones in total. So, the total cost of all five cell phones is $150 x 5 = $750. Now, we need to calculate the amount that Sheila will have to pay per month for three months. We know that an interest rate of 2% has been mentioned, which means that she will have to pay not only the original price of the cell phones but also some extra amount as interest. To find out how much this extra amount is, we can use the formula Interest = Principal x Rate x Time, where Principal is the initial amount borrowed (in this case, $750), Rate is the interest rate (which is 2% in our case), and Time is the period over which the interest is calculated (which is 3 months in our case). Substituting these values into the formula, we get Interest = $750 x 2% x 3/12 = $45. Therefore, Sheila will have to pay $750 + $45 = $895 for each of the three months.
"Response:  
Artie sold 12 pots of marigolds, which means he made $2.74 x 12 = $32.88 from those sales alone. 
He also sold 9 pots of petunias, which means he made $1.87 x 9 = $16.53 from those sales. 
Finally, he sold 17 pots of begonias, which means he made $2.12 x 17 = $35.04 from those sales. 
In total, Artie made $32.88 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $84.45 from his flower sales that day."
"Response:  The total area of all four levels combined would be equal to the area of the top level (16). So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Level 1 = Area of Top Level / 4

Now let's substitute the values given in the problem:

Level 1 = 16 / 4 = 4

So the average square footage of each level is 4 square feet."
Response:  The first 180 days require 1 cup per day, so that is equal to 180 cups total. After that, it requires 2 cups per day which equals 730 cups (2 x 365). So, if there are 110 cups in each bag, then we need to divide 730 by 110 = 6.59 bags. Therefore, Cecilia will use approximately 6-7 bags of dog food during the first year.  
Response:  We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so she does 4 x 200 = 800 pounds of laundry. Now we are told that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so he does 50% of 800 = 400 pounds of laundry. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 400 - 200 = 200 pounds.
"Response:  If Vincent buys 18 flowers and pays $2.50 per package of 3, then his total cost will be:
$2.50 x 6 = $15.00
If instead, he buys 18 flowers and pays $1.00 per package of 2, then his total cost will be:
$1.00 x 9 = $9.00
So, by buying 18 flowers at the better price ($1.00 per package of 2), Vincent saves $6.00 (=$15.00 - $9.00)."
"Response:   If the original price of the grooming is $100 and there is a 30% discount, then the amount after the discount would be:  
$100 x (1 - 0.3) = $70
So, the grooming costs $70 after the discount."
Response:  The total amount of water is 24 liters and two girls shared it equally among themselves, so they got 12 liters each (since 2 x 12 = 24). Now, if we subtract the 12 liters that each girl received from the initial 24 liters, we are left with 12 liters. So, there are 12 liters of water left after the boy gets 6 liters.
Response:  Firstly, Charlie has 10 stickers initially. Then he buys 21 more stickers, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. Next, he gets 23 stickers as gift, which means he now has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. After that, he gives away 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, reducing his total number of stickers to 45 - 28 = 17 stickers. So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.
Response:  We know that Alex weighs $2$ pounds less than $4 \times$ Grace's weight. So, if Grace weighs $125$ pounds, then Alex weighs $\boxed{123}$ pounds ($2$ pounds less than $4 \times 125$). Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is $\boxed{123 + 125 = 248}$ pounds.
Response:  If Dan plants 3 rose bushes, then he will have 3 x 25 = 75 roses in total. Since each rose has 8 thorns, we can calculate the number of thorns as follows: Total Thorns = Number of Roses x Number of Thorns per Rose Total Thorns = 75 x 8 = 600 thorns Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total.
"Response:  If the team won x games and lost y games, then we can write an equation as follows: 
x - y = 8 (given) 
Now solve for x using basic arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction. 
Therefore, the number of games the team won is x = 10."
Response:  Since Gene started traveling at age 23, he has gone on 11 vacations (age 34 - age 23 = 11). And for each vacation, he makes one quilt block. So, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:  11 x 4 = 44 quilt blocks.
"Response:  
The alarm rang 4 times during its first occurrence. 
During the second occurrence, it rang for 3 times longer than the initial ringing (i.e., 4 x 3 = 12). So, it rang 12 times during the second occurrence. 
Finally, during the third occurrence, it rang for half as long as the second occurrence (i.e., 12 / 2 = 6). Therefore, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times in total."
Response:  Sylvie's current salary is $600 per month and she has been working at the company for 5 years as of last December (2023). So, her initial salary was $600 x 5 = $3000. Now, according to the policy, her salary will increase by 10% of the initial salary every year. Therefore, her new salary after 3 years will be calculated as follows: New Salary = Initial Salary + (Initial Salary x Increment Percentage) Where: Initial Salary = $3000 Increment Percentage = 10% New Salary = $3000 + ($3000 x 10%) = $3300 Thus, Sylvie's annual salary after 3 more years of service will be $3300 x 12 = $40,400.
"Response:  We know that if Marilyn's first record sold 10 times more than Harald's, then for every copy of Harald's record sold, Marilyn sold 10 copies. So, we can set up an equation based on this ratio:
Marilyn = 10 x Harald
Now, let's use the information given in the problem to find out how many copies Harald sold. The total number of copies sold between both artists is equal to 88,000. So, we can write:
Harald + Marilyn = 88,000
Subtracting Marilyn's sales from both sides gives us:
Harald = 88,000 - Marilyn
Now, we know that Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, so we can substitute this value into the previous equation:
Harold = (88,000 - Marilyn) / 10
Simplifying and solving for Harald, we get:
Harold = 88,000 / 10 = 8,800
So, Harald sold 8,800 copies of his record."
Response:  If 1/4 of guests do not show up, then the actual number of guests who attend = total number of guests x (1 - 1/4) = 16 x (3/4) = 11 guests. So, Christina will need 0.75 gift bags per invitee x 11 guests = 8.25 gift bags in total. Since each gift bag costs $2, Christina will spend $8.25 to buy gift bags for her guests.
Response:   An adult dinosaur eats 10lbs of potato salad, so we can assume that each adult will eat 10/4 = 2.5 lbs of potato salad (since they are half as much as an adult). A child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which means they will eat 2.5 / 2 = 1.25 lbs of potato salad per child. So, in total, there will be 20 x 2.5 = 50 lbs of potato salad from the adults alone! Adding the 5 children, who will eat 5 x 1.25 = 6.25 lbs of potato salad brings us to a grand total of 50 + 6.25 = 56.25 lbs of potato salad needed for the picnic!
Response:  We know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets. Additionally, we know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, which means that Cindy has x-2 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets among all three is: 3x + (x - 2) = 4x.
Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy is 5 + Jackon's age = 5 + x, where x is Jackson's age. Similarly, we know that Corey is 2 years younger than Jackson, so Corey is 2 - x = 2 - (Jackson's age). Now, we are told that James is 1 year younger than Corey, so James is 1 - (Corey's age) = 1 - (2 - x), since Corey's age is 2 less than Jackson's age. Finally, we are given that James is 10 years old, so we can set up the equation: 10 = 1 - (2 - x). Solving for x, we get x = 8. So, Jackson is 8 years old.
Response:   We know that Lee could run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald before. So if Gerald ran it in 40 seconds, then Lee ran it in 38 seconds (as stated). Now we are told that Gerald has improved his speed by 10%, so he will now run the race 10% faster than he did before. To find out exactly how much faster, we need to calculate what percentage increase there is between 40 and 38 seconds. There is an increase of 2 seconds, or 5%, from 40 to 38 seconds. Therefore, if Gerald's speed has increased by 10%, this means that he will now run the race 5% + 5% = 10% faster than he did before. So, if Lee ran the race in 38 seconds, Gerald will run it in 42 seconds (rounded up to the nearest whole number).
Response:  The number of rabbits = Total no. of pets - (Dogs + Cats) So let T be the total no. of pets, D be the no. of dogs, C be the no. of cats, R be the no. of rabbits. According to the question, T = 12 less than D+C. Now we know that D=60 and C=2D. Substituting this value in the first equation, we get T = 60- (60+2(60)) = 60-120 = -60. Therefore, there are no pets in the neighborhood!
Response:  We know that out of 200 grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys which means there are 80 boys (2 x 40). Now we need to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts. The question states that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, so let's multiply the number of girls by 2/3. There are 160 girls (40 x 2) left over after subtracting those who are in the Girl Scouts. Therefore, there are 160 - 80 = 80 girls who are not in the Girl Scouts.
"Response:  If Harry slept for x hours, then he slept 9 - 2/3x hours less than James. So, we can write an equation as follows:  9 = 9 - (2/3)x. Now solve for x. 
Solution: To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to subtract the number of hours that James slept from the number of hours that Harry slept. We know that Harry slept for 9 hours and James slept for 2/3 of that amount. Therefore, the difference between their sleeping times is: 9 - (2/3)x = 9 - 6 = 3 hours. So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"Response:  If each 16-ounce can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked, then it means that one 16-ounce can will become eight ounces after cooking (since half of eight is fourteen). So if Freda used three cans of tomatoes in her last batch of sauce, she would have used nine cups of raw tomatoes before cooking (three times eight equals twenty-four). Since this results in thirty-two ounces of finished sauce, we know that Freda utilized twenty-seven tomatoes overall (thirty-two divided by two equals seventeen; seventeen plus seven equals twenty-four; and twenty-four minus seven equals nineteen). Therefore, Freda employed nineteen tomatoes to make her most recent batch of tomato sauce."
Response:  The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes plus the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. We know that 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes because if we add this to the original 30 cars, we get 50 cars in total. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes must be equal to 30 - 20 = 10 cars. Therefore, 10 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.  
Response:  Mary currently has 2 x 40 = 80 potted plants in total (including those on the window ledges). If she gives away 16 potted plants (1 per ledge) to friends and family, then she will be left with 80 - 16 = 64 potted plants. So, Mary will remain with 64 potted plants after giving some away.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, each of Jerome's four friends pressed the doorbell at different intervals. We can represent this information as follows:
Friend 1 pressed the doorbell x times (where x is some number).
Friend 2 pressed the doorbell x + 20 times (since they pressed it 20 times more than Friend 1).
Friend 3 pressed the doorbell x + 10 times (since they pressed it 10 times more than Friend 2).
Friend 4 pressed the doorbell 60 times.
Now we need to find out how many total doorbell rings there were in total. To do this, we simply add up all these values:
x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) + 60 =?
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
5x + 90 = 360
Solving for x, we get:
x = 70
So, in total, the doorbell rang 70 times."
Response:  The total number of pages that Solo needs to read is given as follows: Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages. Since Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we can calculate the average number of pages he needs to read per day as follows: Average pages/day = Total pages / Number of days = 49 pages / 5 days = 9.8 pages/day. Therefore, Solo needs to read approximately 9.8 pages per day to finish all his assigned reading within the given time frame.
Response:   On weekdays, John drinks water at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so that is 3 times per day =  3 x 7 = 21 glasses of water per week.  Then, on the weekends, John has a soda with dinner, which means he doesn't drink any water during those days, so the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 21 + 0 = 21 glasses of water per week.
Response:  The distance from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge of the city is 42 miles. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, we can calculate that it will take 42/3 = 14 minutes to cover half of the city (from the oceanfront to the midpoint). Therefore, it will take an additional 14 minutes to cover the remaining half of the city (from the midpoint to the opposite inland edge), so the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city is 14 + 14 = 28 minutes.
Response:  Poppy has already placed a quarter of the total number of pieces (1000) = 250 pieces on the board. Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces which means she placed 3 x 250 = 750 pieces. So, now there are only 250 - 750 = 500 pieces left to be placed.
Response:  If Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody eats 3 times that amount = 15 cookies. So they eat altogether 20 cookies (5 + 15).
Response:  First, we need to find out how many cubic feet each box can hold. We know that the length, width and height of each box are 5 inches, 6 inches, and 4 inches respectively. So, the volume of one box = length x width x height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches. Since there are 1728 cubic inches in a cubic foot, we can convert this to cubic feet as follows: 120 / 1728 = 0.07 cubic feet per box. Now, since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all three boxes = 3 x 0.07 = 0.21 cubic feet. Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is approximately 0.21 cubic feet.
"Response:  We know that Frankie watched 7 hours of TV altogether. So, if we divide this number by the duration of an hour (60 minutes), we get the total number of hours he watched TV: 7/60 = 0.11 hours. Now, let's find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. Since he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday, we can assume that these episodes were not one continuous show but rather multiple shorter ones throughout the day or evening. Therefore, we need to convert the total time he spent watching TV on Wednesay from hours to minutes: 0.11 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 6.6 minutes. Finally, since each episode of the 30-minute show is worth 0.5 hours, Frankie must have watched at least 6.6 / 0.5 = 13.2 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. However, since we are told that he ""watched a few episodes,"" it's possible that he actually watched more than 13 episodes. But based on the information provided, our estimate is as close as possible."
Response:  Last year, Henry baked x cookies. This year, he wanted to make twice as many (2x), but ended up with 110 cookies after dropping 5. So, we can set up an equation: 2x = 110 - 5. Solving for x, we get: x = 60. Therefore, Henry baked 60 cookies last year.
Response:  The cost of one gallon of gas without any discount or reward would be $3.00. So, the total cost of ten gallons of gas without any discount or reward would be $30.00 (10 x $3.00). Now, since there is a cashback offer of$.20 per gallon, we need to subtract that amount from the total cost of gas. Therefore, the final cost of ten gallons of gas after applying the cashback reward would be $29.80 ($30.00 - $0.20 x 10 = $29.80).
Response:  We know that Beatrice had $24$ roll-ups in total, which means she ate $\frac{24}{2} = 12$ roll-ups on average. Similarly, Marcell had $14$ roll-ups in total, which means he ate $\frac{14}{3} = 4.67$ roll-ups on average. So, the average number of roll-ups eaten is $\text{round}(\frac{12 + 4.67}{2}) = \boxed{8}$.
Response:  We know that the boat takes in 2 L/10 ft and it takes Julia 16 sec to row 20 ft. So, if we divide 20 ft by 16 sec, we get 1.25 L per 16 sec. Now, since there are 64 sec between Julia and the shore, we multiply 1.25 L/16 sec by 64 sec and get approximately 8.375 L of water that the boat has taken on by the time Julia reaches shore. 
Response:  Since there are four teachers sharing the whiteboard, it will be used 8 times a day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/day). And since the board is cleaned thrice a day, it will be cleaned altogether 24 times a day (8 times a day x 3 times/lesson). Therefore, the correct answer is 24.
Response:  If Ryan plants two flowers per day and doesn't plant any for five days (days 6-10), then he will have planted a total of 10 + 2 = 12 flowers during this time period. So after 15 days, he has a total of 12 + 2 = 14 flowers in his garden. Therefore, the correct answer is 14.
"Response:  We know from the problem statement that Jamal's phone can hold six times as many photos as Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone can hold x photos, then Jamal's phone can hold 6x photos.  
We also know that the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photo of the ducks at the zoo. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: 6x = 50(y), where y represents the number of birds in Jamal's photo.  Now we need to solve for x, which will give us the number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6: x = 50y/6. Substituting the value given in the problem (x = 1800), we get y = 36. So there are 36 birds in Jamal's photo of the ducks at the zoo."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials Sasha has. The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 x 10 = $100. Similarly, the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 x 5 = $80. Therefore, the total cost of the materials Sasha has is $100 + $80 = $180. Now, let's find out how many boards Sasha can sell and at what price. We know that Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards left, which means she can sell 10 x $10 = $100 worth of these boards. Additionally, she has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards left, which means she can sell 5 x $16 = $80 worth of these boards. In total, Sasha can sell $100 + $80 = $180 worth of boards. Finally, we need to subtract the costs from the profits to find out the actual profit made by Sasha. Profit = Sales - Costs = $180 - $180 = $0. So, Sasha makes no profit selling the leftover lumber.
Response:  We know that for every cup of water, Katy uses 7/13 teaspoons of sugar. So if she used x cups of water, then she would use 7x/13 teaspoons of sugar. Since there are 120 teaspoons of sugar altogether, we can set up the equation: 7x/13 = 120. Solving for x gives us x = 96. Therefore, Katy used 96 teaspoonfuls of sugar.
Response:  If John has 3 children and he bought 2 pairs of shoes for each child, then he bought a total of 6 pairs of shoes (3 x 2 = 6). Since each pair costs $60, John paid a total amount of $60 x 6 = $360. Therefore, the answer is $360.
Response:  On the first day, there are two containers with five vehicles per container for a total of 10 vehicles (2 x 5 = 10). If additional containers arrive on the second day, we can assume that they also have five vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles at the port is now 30 (10 + 20). To find out how many containers arrived on the second day, divide the total number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container: 30 / 5 = 6. Therefore, six containers arrived at the port on the second day.
"Response:  We know that Adrien's current salary is 40% more than his previous salary of $40000. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Adrien’s new salary = (1 + 40%) x $40000
Similarly, we know that Lylah’s current salary is 30% less than her previous salary of $60000. Therefore, we can write another equation as follows:
Lylah’s new salary = ($60000 - 30%) x $60000
Now, let’s combine both equations to find their combined salaries after four years:
$40000(1 + 40%) + $60000(1 - 30%) =?
Solving for the expression above, we get:
$48000 + $42000 = $90000
Therefore, the total salary received by Adrien and Lylah after four years is $90000."
Response:  We know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week. Therefore, he will use 2 x 4 = 8 pads of paper in one month (since there are 4 weeks in a month). Since each pad has 30 sheets of paper, Miguel will use 8 x 30 = 240 sheets of paper every month.
Response:  Morisette has 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits (total). Kael brings twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so he brings 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brings half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. Therefore, Kael has 10 + 4 = 14 fruits (total). So, the total number of fruits that Morisette and Kael have together is 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. Then, on Tuesday and Wednesday (the next two days), she slept for x - 2 hours and x - 3 hours respectively, where x is the number of hours she slept on those days. Since she slept 1 hour more than those two days, that means she slept for x + 1 hours on Thursday and Friday. Therefore, her total sleep time throughout the week can be calculated as follows: Total Sleep Time = 8 + (x - 2) + (x - 3) + (x + 1) = 8 + x - 5 = 13 hours. So, Sadie slept for 13 hours throughout the week.
Response:  Rosie ran at 10 miles/hour for 3 hours, so she covered a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Then, she slowed down and ran at 5 miles/hour for 4 hours (since there are 7 - 3 = 4 additional hours). So, she covered an additional distance of 4 x 5 = 20 miles. Therefore, in total, Rosie can run 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jennie started, the total number of letters was 60 (the sum of the two piles). Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she put stamps on 20 letters (1/3 x 60 = 20). So, after putting stamps on those letters, the number of letters left to be stamped was 40 (60 - 20 = 40). Now, if 30 letters were added to the pile of already-stamped letters, then the original number of letters in that pile must have been 70 (30 + 40 = 70).
Response:   Julia initially had none (since she ran out). Then, she bought a package of x spoons. Later, her husband gave her 5 more spoons. So, Julia now has x + 5 = 12 spoons. Now we can solve for x using basic algebra: x + 5 = 12... x = 7. Therefore, there were 7 spoons in the package that Julia bought.
Response:  We know that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages, so he also bought x fish sausages (since there are 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages). Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 38 + x = total number of sausages. Now, let's solve for x using substitution or elimination method. For example, if you use substitution method, you would first isolate x by subtracting 38 from both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 38 - 38 = 0. So, Dylan bought 0 fish sausages. However, this is impossible since we were told that Dylan bought more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Therefore, we must have x > 0. Using elimination method, we can solve for x by adding 38 to both sides of the equation, which gives us 2x = 44. Solving for x, we get x = 22. So, Dylan bought 22 fish sausages in addition to the 38 chicken sausages. In summary, Dylan bought a total of 50 sausages (38 chicken sausages + 22 fish sausages).
Response:  We know that after transferring to a new school, Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. So, if Lily has x friends, then Amy has x + 20 friends. Therefore, the total number of friends they both have is equal to the sum of their individual friend counts: x + (x + 20) = 70. Solving for x, we get x = 30. So, Lily has 30 friends, and Amy has 30 + 20 = 50 friends.
Response:  The price of one watermelon is 3x $ 15 = $ 45. One orange costs $ 15 - $ 5 = $ 10. So, the total cost of 10 oranges is $ 10 x 10 = $ 100. Now let's calculate the cost of 20 peppers. Since each pepper costs $ 15, the total cost of 20 peppers is $ 15 x 20 = $ 300. Therefore, the total amount that Dillon will spend for all these fruits is $ 45 + $ 100 + $ 300 = $ 675. 
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many hours the doctors work in a day. As per the given information, ""A hospital sees 500 people a day"", it means that there are 500 patients in a day. Now, as each patient takes an average time of 24 minutes with the doctor, the total number of minutes worked by all the doctors in a day can be calculated as follows: Total Minutes Worked = Number of Patients x Time taken per Patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. Next, we need to find out how much money the doctors earn from their work. According to the question, ""The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital"". So, the amount earned by each doctor in one hour can be calculated as: Amount Earned by Doctor per Hour = Charge per Hour x Number of Hours Worked = $150 x 12,000 = $180,000. Similarly, the hospital also makes some profit from this arrangement. According to the question, ""the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour."" So, the amount earned by the hospital from each patient visit can be calculated as: Profit Made by Hospital per Visit = Charges made by Hospital - Cost paid to Doctors = $200 - $180 = $20 per visit. To find out the overall profit made by the hospital in a day, we just have to multiply the number of visitors in a day (500) by the profit made per visit ($20): Overall Daily Profit = Number of Visitors x Profit Made per Visit = 500 x $20 = $10,000. Therefore, based on the given information, the hospital makes a daily profit of $10,000 from seeing 500 patients in a day, assuming that each patient spends an average of 24 minutes with the doctor."
Response:  First, we know that initially there were 60 elves working at the Santa village. Then, 30% or 20 elves (60 x 0.3) quit after being vomited upon. So, now there are 40 elves left (60 - 20). Next, another 10 elves (10/40 = 0.25) quit after being kicked by children. Therefore, the final number of elves left is 30 (40 - 0.25).
Response:  We know that Joseph spent $500 in May and $60 less than that in June. So, he spent $500 - $60 = $440 in June. Therefore, his total expenditure for both months is $500 + $440 = $940.
Response:  Pam rode the roller coaster twice, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for that ride. Fred rode the roller coaster four times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets for that ride. Then, each of them rode the luge two times, using 2 x 6 = 12 more tickets in total. Therefore, the total number of tickets they used at the carnival was 12 + 24 + 12 = 58 tickets.
Response:  We know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and then 6 times as much = 24 miles on Tuesday. So his total distance for Monday to Wednesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. Therefore, he walked 28 - 4 = 24 miles on Wednesday.
"Response:  
Tom gets 4 car washes per month. So, he pays for 4 x $15 = $60 per month.  
In one year, there are 12 months, so Tom pays $60 x 12 = $720 per year."
"Response:  
If Brian had 20 video games and then lost 5, he now has 15 video games.  
Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does, so if we multiply 3 by the number of video games Brian has after losing 5 (15), we get...
3 x 15 = 45
So Bobby has 45 video games!"
Response:  The total number of unicorns is 27. Then one-third of that is 9 (since 3 x 9 = 27). So, the number of unicorns in Scotland is 9. Now, two-thirds of those are female, which means 6 out of 9 are female (since 2/3 x 6 = 4 and 4/6 = 2). Therefore, there are 2 female Scottish unicorns.
Response:  The total cost of two subs is $7.50 x 2 = $15.00. The total cost of two bags of chips is $1.50 x 2 = $3.00. The total cost of two cookies is $1.00 x 2 = $2.00. So far, the total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00. Now we need to calculate the delivery fee which is 20% of the total cost or $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00. Finally, if Rory adds a $5.00 tip, that brings the total cost to $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $39.00. Therefore, Rory's delivery order will cost $39.00.
"Response:  The time taken for completing each set of questions is given as follows:
Time taken = Number of questions / Rate (in questions/hour)
For the first test, Time taken = 75 questions / 5 questions/hour = 15 hours
For the second test, Time taken = 100 questions / 5 questions/hour = 20 hours
Since Mark has 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one, we can write:
8 hours + 6 hours = Total time available
Total time available = 14 hours
Now, let's find out how many questions Mark left incomplete:
Number of questions left incomplete = Total time available - Time taken for both tests
= 14 hours - (15 hours + 20 hours)
= 14 hours - 35 hours
= -21 hours
So, Mark left 21 questions incomplete."
Response:  According to the problem statement, for every 4 blue gumballs, there are 5 additional pink gumballs. So if there are x blue gumballs, then there are 5x pink gumballs. Now we know that there are 12 blue gumballs in total (based on the given information). Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is equal to 5(12) = 60.
Response:  The total number of cars is 20. Automatic cars make up 12/20 = 60% of the total number of cars. Manual cars make up 4/20 = 20% of the total number of cars. Semi-automatic cars make up (12 + 4) / 20 = 35% of the total number of cars. Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 35%.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 700 bees in total in the hive.  
1) The number of worker bees is twice that of baby bees, so the number of worker bees = 2 x (number of baby bees).  Number of baby bees = 700 - (total number of bees / 2) = 700 - 350 = 350 
Therefore, there are 350 worker bees in the hive."
Response:  If Jordan spends two hours playing video games each day and works for five days a week (not including weekends), then he will work for a total of 5 x 8 = 40 hours per week. So, if he worked during that time instead of gaming, he could have earned $40 x $10 = $400 in one week.
"Response: 
John bought milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. So in total he spent:
$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15
Now let's calculate the tax amount:
Tax = $15 x 10% = $1.50
So the final cost of everything is:
$15 + $1.50 = $16.50"
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three existing clients for whom Kim needs two bottles of bleach and one pack of cloths per home. So, the total number of items needed for these clients = 3 x 2 (bottles) + 3 (packs) = 18. Now, let's assume that out of the five potential clients, two will become regular clients. For these two clients, the total number of items needed = 2 x 2 (bottles) + 2 (packs) = 8. Therefore, the total number of items needed for all seven clients = 18 + 8 = 26. Since each item costs $2 and $5 respectively, the total cost of items for all seven clients = 2 x 26 = $52. Now, let's calculate the profit. Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses = $92 (Total Income) - $52 (Total Expenses) = $40 per week.
Response:  Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares of land, he will have 1000 pineapples in total (10 x 100 = 1000). Now, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he will be able to harvest 4 times in a year (12 / 3 = 4). So, John will be able to harvest 4000 pineapples in a year (1000 x 4 = 4000).
Response:  The first Lego set has 500 pieces, so Johnny picked up 500 pieces. The second set has three times as many pieces as the first set, which means it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. Finally, the third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which means it has 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces. In total, Johnny picked up 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2275 pieces.
Response:  In the first six hours, 30 bees left the hive and half of them came back, which means 15 bees returned. Now, twice as many bees flew out than were seen returning earlier, so 2 x 15 = 30 more bees flew out. Since all these bees had not yet returned when the second six-hour period began, they will return during this time. So, in addition to the 15 bees that returned earlier, another 30 bees will return, for a total of 45 bees returning in the final six hours.
Response:  Adult tickets are $12 each, so one adult ticket costs $12. Children's tickets are $10 each, so one child ticket costs $10. Since Brittany's mom gave the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket, she paid $10 + $12 = $22 total. Therefore, she gave the cashier $22 in dollars.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then Charlie has 3x friends and James has 4x friends. Now we are given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write an equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, James has 4x = 16 friends on Facebook.
"Response:  We know that Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, which means he covers 1 mile in 5 minutes (since there are 5,280 feet in a mile). Therefore, it takes Steve 5 minutes to cover 3 miles (the distance between him and the school), since each mile takes 5 minutes. 
Now let's consider Tim. Since Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, it also takes him 5 minutes to cover this distance if he rides his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. So, after Steve has covered 3 miles, Tim still needs to cover another 2 miles, which will take him 10 minutes (since each mile takes 5 minutes). 
Therefore, the winner will arrive at their house 10 minutes after the loser finishes the race."
Response:  We know how much each tire cost to inflate ( $0.25). Now we need to find out how many tires were inflated for each customer. For the bicyclists, it was two tires per rider since they had two tires total. The tricycle riders needed three tires because of course, tricycles have more wheels than bikes! And lastly, the unicycler only had one wheel so naturally they didn't need any tire inflation at all. So here are our totals: Bicycles = 5 x $0.25 = $1.25 Tricycles = 3 x $0.25 = $0.75 Unicycle = $0 Total amount earned by Shawnda = $1.25 + $0.75 + $0 = $2.00 Therefore, Shawnda made $2.00 that day from offering bike inflation services.
Response:  If Carl pays for the ten packs of cookies with a $10 bill, then the total amount paid is $10 x 10 = $100. Since each pack of cookies costs $0.10 per cookie, and there are six cookies in each pack, the total cost of all ten packs is $100 / 6 = $16.67. Therefore, Carl will receive $10 - $16.67 = $3.33 in change.
"Response:  The total number of fries eaten is 14 + (half of 14) = 28. Since 3 pigeons ate 3 fries each, they ate 9 fries in total. So, the total number of fries left after the pigeons ate is 28 - 9 = 19. Now, the raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which means he ate 13 fries (since 2/3 is equal to 13/6). Therefore, the total number of fries left after the raccoon ate is 19 - 13 = 6. Finally, an ant ate one fry, so there are now 5 fries left. 
So, when Dave bought the pack of french fries, there were 5 fries in the pack."
"Response:  
Monday, Wednesday, Friday = 3 x 1 hour = 3 hours per day
Tuesday, Thursday = 2 x 2 hours = 4 hours per day
Total hours in a week = 3 + 4 = 7 hours/week
Total hours in a semester = 7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours
Therefore, Kimo spends 112 hours attending classes in a semester."
Response:  Rolls are 4 inches long, so there are 4 inches/foot = 0.5 feet per roll. Since Bill makes 300 rolls, the total length of all the rolls is 300 x 0.5 feet = 150 feet. Now, let's do the same for the other items: Chocolate croissants are 6 inches long, so there are 6 inches/foot = 0.83 feet per croissant. Since Bill makes 120 croissants, the total length of all the croissants is 120 x 0.83 feet = 99 feet. Finally, baguettes are two feet long, so their total length is simply 2 x 0.5 feet = 1 foot. Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is 150 + 99 + 1 = 250 feet.
"Response:  We know that each species of ape needs a certain number of bananas per month. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Monkeys = 200 bananas/month x (number of months)
Gorillas = 400 bananas/month x (number of months)
Baboons = 100 bananas/month x (number of months)
Now let's substitute the values given in the problem:
Monkeys = 200 bananas/month x 2 = 400 bananas
Gorillas = 400 bananas/month x 2 = 800 bananas
Baboons = 100 bananas/month x 2 = 200 bananas
So, in total, the zookeeper needs to order 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
Response:  The distance of one lap around the football field is 100 yards. Since Blake ran back and forth 15 times, he covered a total distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards. On the other hand, Kelly ran from the 0-yard line to the 40-yard line and back, which means she covered a distance of 40 + 40 = 80 yards. Therefore, the winner (Kelly) ran a total distance of 80 yards more than the loser (Blake). So, the answer is 1500 - 80 = 1420 yards.  
Response:  The total amount that Raphael spent is equal to the sum of the prices of all the items he purchased. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Cost = Price of Pens + Price of Notebooks + Price of Bond Paper We know the price of each item from the problem statement: • Price of pens = $1.5 per pen (since he bought 4 pens) • Price of notebooks = $4 per notebook (since he bought 2 notebooks) • Price of bond paper = $20 per rim (since he bought one rim) Now let's substitute these values into our equation: Total Cost = ($1.5 x 4) + ($4 x 2) + ($20) = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on his school supplies.
Response:  At first, Finn watched 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 of them came out of hiding from under a lily pad and were visible to Finn again. So, the number of tadpoles that Finn could see increased to 11 + 6 = 17. Finally, 2 more tadpoles hid under a rock, leaving only 15 tadpoles visible to Finn in the pond. Therefore, the correct answer is 15.
Response:  The tank had 7 feet more water than before on Tuesday, so its new depth would be $depth = 17 + 7 = 24$ feet. Then, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, which means that the new depth will be $\frac{24}{3} = 8$ feet. Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is $8$ feet.
Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. So in total, he caught 19 fish (10 + 6 + 3 = 19). Now we are told that Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 5 - 10 = -5 starfish. He also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means he caught 6 - 6 = 0 sea horses. And finally, he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means he caught 3 + 3 = 6 clownfish. Therefore, Locsin caught a total of 6 + 0 + 6 = 12 fish. So the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is 19 + 12 = 31 fish.
Response:  The first increase in price will be 20% of the original price, which is $4 (20% x $20). So, after one month, the new price will be $24 ($20 + $4). Now, for the second time, we need to calculate another 20% increase over the new price, which gives us $5.60 (20% x $24 = $5.60). Therefore, after two months, the new price becomes $29.60 ($24 + $5.60). For the third time, we have to apply another 20% increase, which results in $35.72 (20% x $29.60 = $35.72). And so on... After 36 months, the total amount paid for the bag of marbles would be $185.72 ($35.72 x 5 = $185.72).
"Response:  We know that the total value of all toys is equal to the sum of their individual values. So we can write the equation:
Value = Value of doll + Value of red cars + Value of action figures
We also know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the value of the doll is 3 times the value of an action figure:
Value of doll = 3 x Value of action figure
Similarly, we know that one red car costs $4, so the value of each red car is $4:
Value of red cars = $4
Now we have three equations and three unknowns (the value of the doll, the value of the red cars, and the value of the action figures). Can you use these equations to find the value of each item in the room?"
"Response: 
Jackie can save $35 per hour by doing her own taxes instead of paying an accountant. So, if she spends 3 hours working on her taxes, she saves $105 ($35 x 3).
On the other hand, if she pays an accountant $90 for their services, that means she loses another $90. In total, she loses $195 ($105 + $90) by doing her own taxes instead of hiring an accountant.
Therefore, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will make $90 more than if she did her own taxes."
"Response:  The total cost of all the items is:
€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1423
Now we subtract the amount spent on the computer from the total: €1423 - €1090 = €333
So, Elvira will have €333 left over for clothing."
"Response:  We know that each batch of flan requires 3 eggs and we need to make 15 batches in total. So, if our neighbor gives us 9 eggs per babysitting session, then...
We can divide 15 (the number of batches) by 9 (the number of eggs per babysitting session):
15 / 9 = 1.67 babysitting sessions
So, Sandra will have to babysit approximately 1.67 times to collect all the eggs needed to make 15 Spanish flans."
Response:  If Seth is twice as old as Brooke, then in two years, the difference between their ages will decrease by half. So, if Brooke is x years old now, Seth will be 2x years old in two years. Therefore, Seth is 40 years old (x + 2).
Response:  We know that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has. So if Ethel has $8, then Jimmy has $2 + 2(8) = $2 + 16 = $18. Therefore, Jimmy has $18.
Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho walks for 20 miles per day = 20 x 5 = 100 miles/week. Since he doesn't walk on weekends, his total weekly mileage is 100 - 10 = 90 miles/week. Therefore, Pancho walks 90 miles in a week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of the hat is $25. Next, since the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, the price of the jacket is $3 \times $25 = $75. Finally, the pants cost the average of the prices of the hat and jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50. Therefore, each uniform costs a total of $25 (for the hat), plus $75 (for the jacket), plus $50 (for the pants) = $140.
Response:  The number of spiders = 80 x 8 = 640 legs. The number of insects = 90 x 6 = 540 legs. And the number of rare mutant invertebrates = 3 x 10 = 30 legs. So, altogether, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1200 legs.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we can make the following calculations:
Granny Red - 3 = Sally Two (age)
Sally Two + 3 = Granny Red (age)
2 x Sally Four = Granny Red's age
Sally Four = 40 (since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old)
Therefore, the total age of the four birds is:
Granny Red - 3 + Sally Two + 3 + 2 x Sally Four = 75 + 3 + 6 + 40 = 148 years
So, the total age of the four birds is 148 years."
Response:  The total amount that Jessica pays each month towards her debts = Minimum Payment + (Minimum Payment x Percentage Increase). So, for Jessica, Total Monthly Debt Payments = $300 + ($200 x 1.5) = $670 per month. Now, if we multiply this number by 12, we get the annual debt payment as follows: Annual Debt Payment = $670 x 12 = $8,040 per year. Therefore, Jessica pays $8,040 annually towards her debts.  
Response:  First, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to peel all 60 potatoes. We can do this by multiplying the number of potatoes by the time per potato (1 min 15 sec). So, it will take 60 x 1 min 15 sec = 90 minutes to peel all the potatoes. Now, let's find out how much time it will take to cut them all up. Since it takes only 5 sec to cut each potato, it will take 60 x 5 sec = 300 seconds to cut them all up. Therefore, it will take Billy altogether 90 + 300 = 490 seconds or approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds to prep all the potatoes. 
"Response:  We know that Juan and Carlos sold x glasses of lemonade. Since they got 20 glasses per gallon, we can write:
x = 20g
Where g is the number of gallons.
We also know that the cost of making one gallon of lemonade is $3 + $2 = $5. So, the total amount spent on lemons is:
Total Cost = Number of Gallons x Cost Per Gallon = x(5) = $100
Now, we want to find out how much profit they made. The question states that they made $25 in profit, so:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = (Number of Glasses x Price Per Glass) - Total Cost = ($0.50 x x) - $100 = $75
So, they spent $100 on lemons."
Response:  We know that there are 240 people in total who are Asian. Of those, 80 are Japanese, so we have 160 (240 - 80) remaining as non-Japanese Asians. Since the rest were Chinese, we can say that among these non-Japanese Asians, 60 are boys from the Chinese team. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is equal to 160 minus 60 = 100. So, there are 100 girls on the Chinese team.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Zaid spends on each category:
Rent = $2000 (since he spends 1/4 of his salary)
Car Fuel = $2000 (since he spends 1/3 of his salary)
Donation = $3000 (since he donates half of the remaining amount)
Weekly Expenses for Daughter = $200
Groceries and Household Goods for Wife = $1400 (since she gets $700 from him)
Total Spending = Rent + Car Fuel + Donation + Weekly Expenses + Groceries and Household Goods = $5800
Now let's check if Zaid has enough money left after all these expenses:
Money Left After Expenses = Salary - Total Spending = $6000 - $5800 = $200
So, Zaid will have $200 left after all these expenses and donations."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Rani has ten more crabs than Monica, which means that if Monica has x crabs, then Rani has x + 10 = 50 crabs (since 10 is the difference between their numbers). Similarly, we know that Bo has 4 fewer crabs than Monica, so Bo has x - 4 = 36 crabs (since 4 is the difference between their numbers). Now, since all three have a total of 50 + 36 + 40 = 126 crabs altogether. Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 126.
Response:  For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 x 5 = $50. For the second week, he earned $10 x 8 = $80. So, in total, Lloyd earned $50 + $80 = $130 for the first two weeks.
Response:  The total number of votes cast is equal to 80 because all students vote. So if one candidate received three-fourths (or 3/4) of the votes, that means they obtained 75 votes (since there are 80 voters). To determine how many votes the runner-up received, subtract the number of votes won by the victorious candidate from the overall tally of ballots cast. Therefore, the runner-up gained 5 votes (80 - 75 = 5).
"Response:  If Sandra ordered 4 times more red roses than white carnations and she ordered 200 pink calla lilies that are 5 times the number of white carnations... 
Step-by-step calculation:
1) Red Roses: Sandra ordered 4 x (white carnations) = 4 x 100 = 400 red roses.
2) White Carnations: Sandra ordered 100 white carnations.
3) Pink Calla Lilies: Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies.
Total flowers needed by 5 pm: 400 + 100 + 200 = 700 flowers.
Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 700 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
Response:  2 years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age. So, if Jean is x years old now, then 2 years ago he/she was (x + 2) years old. Now we know that when Jean was (x+2), Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age which means Mark was 5(x+2)/2 = 10x + 10 years old. Therefore, Jean is currently 30 - 10 = 20 years old.
"Response:   
The fastest team runs each member's 400m leg in exactly 55 seconds. So they finish their race in 2 x 55 = 110 seconds. 
Now let's look at the slower team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds to complete her leg, so she finishes in 60 + (time for next runner) = 60 + 3 = 63 seconds.  Next runner takes 57 seconds, third runner takes 54 seconds, and fourth runner takes 51 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken by the slower team to complete their race is 63 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 285 seconds.  Since the faster team finished in 110 seconds, we can see that the slower team loses by 110 - 285 = -175 seconds.  So the faster team wins by 175 seconds."
"Response:  The probability of rolling an odd number is $ \frac{1}{6} = 0.17$ since there are three odd numbers and three even numbers on the die. 
The probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is $\frac{2}{6}^2 = 0.04$. So the difference between these probabilities is:  
$$\text{Probability of rolling } \text{an odd number}> \text{probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers} = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96$$
So the probability of rolling an odd number is $17\%$ higher than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers."
Response:  We know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so if her mom picked 20 apples, then Jenna picked 10 apples (half of 20). So, together, they picked 30 apples (20 + 10 = 30).
Response:  We know there are three cages with rodents, so we can assume there are three times as many rats as hamsters (since they are equally divided). Therefore, if there are x rats in one cage, then there will be 3x hamsters in each of the other two cages. Now let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to all the animals: For the rats, it's 6 pieces per rat x 3 cages = 18 pieces of straw for the rats. For the hamsters, it's 5 pieces per hamster x 2 cages = 10 pieces of straw for the hamsters. And for the rabbits, it's 20 pieces of straw altogether. So the total number of pieces of straw distributed is 18 + 10 + 20 = 48 pieces of straw. Since no straw is used elsewhere in the store, we know that all of these pieces were distributed among the small rodents. Finally, since there are 160 pieces of straw in total, and we just calculated that 48 of them went to the small rodents, that means there are 160 / 48 = 3.33... cages of rats. So, there must be approximately 3 1/3 cages of rats in each group.
Response:  The amount that Mandy owes is $100 with an added monthly interest rate of 2% which means we multiply the original amount by 1 + 0.02 = 1.02. So if Mandy pays after three months, then the total amount she needs to pay will be $100 x 1.02^3 = $104.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the trader bought the bags of wheat from the farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. This means that if he bought x bags, then the cost of the wheat he purchased is $20x. Secondly, we are told that it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse. Therefore, the total cost of transporting all the bags is $2x. Thirdly, we know that the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each. So, the revenue generated from selling all the bags is $30x. Finally, we can set up an equation using these values as follows: $20x + $2x = $400x. Simplifying this equation gives us $22x = $400. Dividing both sides by $22 gives us x = 18. Therefore, the trader sold 18 bags of wheat.
Response:  First, we know that the total cost of the three tickets is $20.25 + $20.25 + $20.25 = $61.75. Then, we are told that they paid $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $61.75 - $4.50 = $57.25. Next, we learn that they went on two different rides and the cost of each ride was $33. So, the total cost of the rides is $33 x 2 = $66. Finally, since they agreed to split the costs evenly, each friend paid $61.75 (tickets) + $57.25 (food) + $66 (rides) = $184.90.
Response:  If John collects peaches for 3 hours, then he will have collected 3 x 60 = 180 minutes of peaches. Since he can collect 2 peaches per minute, he will have collected 180 x 2 = 360 peaches in total. Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.
Response:  We know that ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds (or 1.6 kg) of insects every week. Since we have a flock of ten ducks, we can divide this amount among them. So, each duck needs to eat approximately 0.35 pounds or 0.16 kg of insects per week. To find out how much they need per day, we can multiply this amount by seven (the number of days in a week). Therefore, each duck needs to eat around 0.24 pounds or 0.11 kg of insects per day.
"Response:  
Step 1: Calculate how many trees Tom has after 10 years if no trees are chopped down (i.e., only planting new ones).
Tom plants 10 trees/year x 10 years = 100 trees.
So, after 10 years, Tom has 100 trees in total.
Step 2: Calculate the number of trees that will be dead after 10 years due to chopping down 2 trees per year.
After 10 years, Tom will have chopped down 20 trees (2 trees/year x 10 years).
Now, calculate the percentage of trees that died:
Percentage of dead trees = Number of dead trees / Total number of trees x 100
= 20 trees / 100 trees x 100
= 30%
Step 3: Calculate the updated number of trees Tom has after accounting for both planting and tree death.
New total number of trees = Old total number of trees - Number of dead trees
= 100 trees - 30% of 100 trees
= 70 trees
Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 70 trees left."
"Response:   The number of pink plastic flamingos at the start was 18.  
On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one-third of the flamingos (which is equal to 6). So now there are 12 pink flamingos left. 
Then, on Sunday morning, additional 18 pink flamingos were added, so now there are total of 30 pink flamingos outside Sue's house. 
So, at noon on Sunday, there are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"Response:  To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy with her budget of $20, we divide $20 by the cost of one crayon ($2). So, Violetta can buy 10 crayons ( $20 / $2 = 10):
$20 / $2 = 10
Now let's calculate the total amount Violetta pays for all five colors:
Total Amount = Number of Crayons x Cost per Crayon
= 10 x $2
= $20
So, Violetta will not receive any change because she paid exactly what she had budgeted for. The answer is zero or $0."
"Response:  The total cost of one pen is equal to the cost of a pencil plus the cost of an eraser. So, if we assume that one pen = 1 pencil + 1 eraser, then...
We know that one pencil costs $1.20, so one eraser must cost half of that amount, or $0.60. Therefore, the total cost of one pen = $1.20 (for the pencil) + $0.60 (for the eraser) = $1.80 per pen. Now, let's find out how many pens can be bought with $X dollars: X / $1.80 = number of pens We want to buy 8 pens, so we need to divide $X by $1.80 eight times: $X / $1.80 = 8 x $X = $14.40. Therefore, 8 pens will cost $14.40."
Response:  We have 200 pounds of carrots and we need to distribute them among 40 restaurants. Since each restaurant needs 2 pounds of carrots, we can calculate how much will remain as follows: Number of pounds of carrots that will not be used = Total number of pounds of carrots - Number of pounds of carrots needed for each restaurant x Number of restaurants = 200 - (2 x 40) = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.
Response:  We know that the total number of inhabitants in Soda is 23786. Of these, 8417 are male (men) and 9092 are female (women). This means that the remaining part of the population consists of children. To find out how many children there are in Soda, we can use the following formula: Total Population = Number of Men + Number of Women + Number of Children. Substituting the values given in the question into this formula, we get: Total Population = 8417 + 9092 + x Where 'x' represents the number of children in Soda. Now, we are asked to find out the value of 'x'. Based on the information provided in the question, we can see that the total population of Soda is 23786, which includes 8417 men, 9092 women, and an unknown number of children (represented by 'x'). Using the formula above, we can set up the equation: 23786 = 8417 + 9092 + x To solve for 'x', we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population: 23786 - 8417 - 9092 = x Therefore, there are 5487 children in Soda.
"Response: 
In the first month, Elaine collects 3x = 60 Pokémon cards (since she initialy has 20).
In the second month, she collects 20 - 3x = 40 more cards (since she collected 20 fewer cards than in the previous month).
So far, Elaine has collected 60 + 40 = 100 Pokémon cards.
In the third month, she collects 2(60 + 40) = 120 additional cards.
Therefore, Elaine currently has 100 + 120 = 220 Pokémon cards in total."
Response:  If Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence, then Publisher B pays $0.10 per sentence (twice as much). So, if Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher A, he will earn $50 (1000 x $0.05) from that publisher. For Publisher B, he will edit 500 sentences ($1000 / 2 = 500), so he will earn $500 (500 x $0.10) from that publisher. Therefore, Mark makes a total of $950 in one week ($50 + $500).
Response:  In total, Baldur gets 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water per day. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, in total, he gets 11 x 5 = 55 liters of water per day. Therefore, the correct answer is 55 liters of water per day.
"Response:   
John made $2000 per week, so he made $104,000 (2000 x 52) in one year.  He received a $5000 award and a 5% raise, which is equal to $100 per week ($5000 / 5%). So his new annual income would be $105,000 ($104,000 + $100). Therefore, John made $105,000 in one year after receiving the award."
Response:  Since Josie has 10 acres of land, she will have 10 x 5 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Now, since each ton of grapes can make 2 barrels of wine, we get 50 x 2 = 100 barrels of wine per year from Josie's farm. Therefore, the correct answer is 100 barrels of wine per year.
Response:  We know that Carl had a sandwich with two slices of cheese every day as his lunch. So, he used 2 x 5 = 10 slices of cheese for sandwiches throughout the week. Additionally, we know that he had three eggs omelets during the week, each containing one extra slice of cheese compared to his sandwiches (i.e., 3 + 1 = 4). Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese consumed by Carl through omelets is 4 x 3 = 12 slices. Now, let's consider the macaroni and cheese dish. Since Carl made enough macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners, we can assume that he had at least five dinners this week. If he used eight slices of cheese in each dinner, then the total number of slices of cheese used by Carl for all dinners is 8 x 5 = 40 slices. Finally, adding up all these values gives us the total number of slices of cheese used by Carl throughout the week: 10 + 12 + 40 = 62 slices. Therefore, Carl used 62 slices of cheese throughout the week.
Response:  First, we know that Janet has 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens initially. So, altogether, she has 32 pens (22 green + 10 yellow). Now, let's consider the additional pens she buys: 6 bags of blue pens contain 9 pens each, so she gets 54 blue pens (6 x 9 = 54), and 2 bags of red pens contain 6 pens each, so she gets 12 red pens (2 x 6 = 12). Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has now is 32 + 54 + 12 = 108 pens.
"Response:  We know that Brinley can remove her lowest score from her overall average for each semester. So far, she has scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests. To calculate her average after removing her lowest score, we add all these scores together and divide by 5:

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 459

Now, let's find out which score she needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93:

To get an average of 93, Brinley would need to have a score of at least 93 on the sixth test. Since she already has scores of 92 and 100 on previous tests, she only needs to improve her score on the sixth test by one point (from 92 to 93) to achieve her desired average."
Response:  In the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike 5 times per week and covered 25 km each time, so he traveled a total distance of 5 x 25 = 125 km during this period. Then, he reduced his frequency to twice a week and increased his distance to 60 km each time. So, during the next three weeks, he traveled a total distance of 2 x 60 = 120 km. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Michael is 125 + 120 = 245 km.
Response:  The total weight of all the items is equal to the sum of their weights. So, if there are x chocolate bars and y candied apples, then the total weight = x(2x) + y(80). Since there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples, we can substitute these values into the equation above. Now solve for x and y using algebraic manipulation or mental math. For example, if you prefer, you could multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get rid of fractions: 100x + 80y = 2500 (or some other convenient multiple of 100). Then simplify and solve for x and y. Once you have found x and y, you can use them to calculate the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, which will be 2x(40) + y(80), where x is the number of chocolate bars and y is the number of candied apples. In this case, let's say that x = 16 and y = 40. Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy would be approximately 384 grams (2(40) + 80).
"Response: 
Rose went to the first store on Monday and bought 4 cakes. So, the total number of cakes she bought on Monday is 4.
On Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought 3 times as many cakes, which means she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.
On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.
Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes."
Response:  The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000 x 3 = $18000. So, if we subtract $1200 from this amount, we get $16800. This means that twenty-four dozen cups would cost $16800 / 24 = $700 per cup.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $10 saved before she starts babysitting. So after babysitting four times, she will have earned $5 x 4 = $20. Now let's calculate how much money she needs to buy the jacket and two pairs of shoes. Jacket costs $30 + ($2 x 2) = $60 for two pairs of shoes. Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn $60 / $4 = 15 times to save enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.  
Response:  We know that everyday Jerry gets 42 eggs from both his red and white chicken. So, if R is the number of red chickens, then total number of eggs collected per day = 3R + 5(white). Now we are given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Therefore, the number of white chickens = R + 2. Substituting this value in the equation above, we get 3R + 5(R+2) = 42. Simplifying the equation, we get 3R + 10 = 42. Solving for R, we get R = 14. So, Jerry has 14 red chickens.
Response:  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the length of the park (l) is 1.5 miles, and the width (w) is 6 miles. So, we can calculate the perimeter as follows: P = 2(1.5 + 6) = 48 miles. Now, since Gary walks along the edge of the park, his distance traveled is equal to the perimeter of the park divided by his speed: Distance = Perimeter / Speed = 48 / 3 = 16 hours. Therefore, Gary spends 16 hours walking around the edge of the park if he walks at 3 miles/hour.
Response:  On the first day, there were 100 customers. So, if there are 50 more customers each subsequent day, then on the second day, there would be 150 (100 + 50) customers. And on the third day, there would be 250 (150 + 100) customers. Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.  4/5 
Response:  The big pool initially had 2x = 8 gallons of water (since it took twice as long for the small pool to lose its water). Then, after 4 minutes, the big pool lost another 4g = 16 gallons of water. So, the total amount of water in the big pool is now 8 + 16 = 24 gallons. Since the big pool initially had twice as much water as the small pool, the small pool must have had 24 / 2 = 12 gallons of water initially. Therefore, the small pool currently has 12 - 4 = 8 gallons of water remaining.
Response:   First we need to find out how much money Lori has after buying the shoes and belt. The total cost of the shoes and belt is $352.00 ($320.00 + $32.00). So if Lori pays for them with her part-time job earnings, she will have $8.00 per hour x number of hours worked = amount of money left over after purchasing the shoes and belt. To determine this amount, we need to divide the total cost of the shoes and belt by the amount of money Lori makes per hour. This gives us: Number of hours worked = Total cost of shoes and belt / Amount of money made per hour = $352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours Worked. Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt.
Response:  The total amount that Janet owes is $2000 plus the extra 10%, which is equal to $2000 x 1.1 = $2200. To calculate her remaining balance after making monthly payments of $165 for 12 months, we can use the following formula: Balance After Payments = Total Amount Owed - (Monthly Payment x Number of Months). Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Balance After Payments = $2200 - ($165 x 12) = $2200 - $2040 = $1600. Therefore, by the end of the 12th month, Janet's remaining balance will be $1600.
Response:  The number of roses is 4 and the number of dahlias is 7 more than the number of roses. So, the number of dahlias = 4 + (7) = 11. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase = Number of roses + Number of dahlias = 4 + 11 = 15.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Adrian's age is thrice that of Harriet, which means Adrian's age = 3 x Harriet's age. Also, Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 2 x Harriet's age. Now we have two equations:
Adrian's age = 3 x Harriet's age... (Equation 1)
Zack's age = 2 x Harriet's age... (Equation 2)
Now let's assume Harriet's current age is H, then her age will be H + 3 years from Equation 1, and her age will be H/2 + 2H years from Equation 2. So, we can write:
Harriet's new age = H + 3... (Equation 3)
Harriet's new age = H/2 + 2H... (Equation 4)
Now, we are given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, so we can substitute this value into either Equation 3 or Equation 4 to find the other variable. For example, if we use Equation 3, we get:
H + 3 = 21... (5)
Solving for H, we get:
H = 18... (6)
Now, using Equation 4 with H = 18, we get:
Harriet's new age = 18/2 + 2(18) = 36 years... (7)
So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after three years will be 36 years. Therefore, the answer is 36 years."
"Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points, so Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi which is equal to 68/2 = 34 points. So Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi which means she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Now we have to find out how much points Jojo scored. According to the question ""Four students scored a total of 251 points"", so the sum of all four scores must be equal to 251. Therefore, Jojo's score can be calculated as follows: Total points = 68 + 34 + 85 + x = 251 where 'x' represents the score of Jojo. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: 68 + 34 + 85 + x = 251 Solving for 'x', we get: x = 94 Points Jojo scored 94 points."
Response:   For each crossword puzzle, it takes her 10 minutes to complete one. So for three crosswords, it will take her 3 x 10 = 30 minutes. Similarly, for each sudoku puzzle, it takes her 5 minutes to complete one. Therefore, for eight sudokus, it will take her 8 x 5 = 40 minutes. In total, she spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
Response:  The amount of water remaining in the tank after Celine used 90 liters is equal to the total capacity of the tank minus the volume of water she utilized. So we can write this equation: Total Capacity - Volume Used = Remaining Water. In this case, the total capacity of the tank is 120 liters (given), and the volume of water used by Celine is also given at 90 liters. Therefore, we can plug these values into our equation to solve for the quantity of water remaining in the tank: 120 - 90 = 30 liters. This means there are 30 liters of water remaining in the tank after Celine used some of it to water her garden.
Response:  If Andy plants 90 geraniums, then the total number of flowers he plants is 90 + 40 = 130. Therefore, Andy plants 130 flowers in total.
Response:  The company spent $15000 on advertising in one year, so if it spends a third of that amount ($5000) on advertising in another year, the total amount the company spent on advertising is $20000 (($15000 + $5000)).
Response:  For Carlos, he pays $30/hour x 3 = $90 for his canoe rental. For Benji, he pays $18/hour x 5 = $90 for his raft rental. So together, they pay $90 + $90 = $180.
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester, then it would take half that time (or 3 days) to travel back from Rochester to New Jersey by car. So, in total, Andrew will travel for 9 days (6 + 3).
Response:  First we have 40 water types out of total 90 pokemon cards(30+20). Now if james lost 8 of them then he has 40-8=32 water types left. And now he bought 14 more grass types so now he has 32+14=46 cards in total. So the percentage of water types among all 46 cards is 32/46 or 70% rounded to the nearest integer which is 70%.
"Response: 
Chad orders a build-your-own burrito for lunch.  The base burrito costs $6.50.  So far, Chad owes $6.50.
He adds extra meat ($2.00), extra cheese ($1.00), avocado ($1.00), and two sauces ($0.25 x 2 = $0.50). Total cost so far: $7.00.
Then, he upgrades his meal for an additional $3.00, which includes chips and a drink. New total cost: $10.00.
Finally, he uses his $5.00 gift card to cover some of the cost, leaving him with a remaining balance of $5.00.
So, how much does Chad still owe? $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00."
Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mom can do half that, then her mom can add 2 pieces per minute. Since there are 360 pieces in total, they will finish the puzzle in 360/4 = 90 minutes. So, it will take them approximately 90 minutes to complete the puzzle.
Response:  After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest, which means 30% of 120 = 36 melons are ready. So, there are 84 non-ready melons left (120 - 36). Two weeks later, when Ashlyn comes back, 3/4 of the remaining melons are ready, which is equal to 3/4 x 84 = 59 melons. Therefore, there are 25 melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks (84 - 59).
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate how many dollars Mark spends on the cars themselves. Since each car costs $20,000, the total amount spent on all 12 cars is:
$$ Total = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 $$
Next, we need to subtract the taxes paid on the cars. The question states that Mark pays 10% tax on the cars, which means he pays:
$$ Tax = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 $$
So far, Mark has spent a total of:
$$ Total = 240,000 - 24,000 = 216,000 $$
Finally, we need to add the registration fee for each car. According to the question, this fee is $1000 per car. So, the total amount spent on registrations is:
$$ Registration = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 $$
Therefore, the grand total amount that Mark pays for everything is:
$$ Total = Total + Registration = 216,000 + 12,000 = 228,000 $$"
Response:  We know that on Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so Robert collected 20 - 5 = 15 shells. Now we are told that on Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday, so if she collected x shells on Monday, she will collect 2x shells on Tuesday. Therefore, Kylie collects 2(15) = 30 shells on Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. So if there are x bugs, then there are 2x ants. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x = 2(50) = 100

So there are 100 bugs in the garden."
Response:   1/3 x 36 = 24 (penguins that jumped in) + 1/3 x 36 = 24 (penguins that went into the cave). So there are 24 penguins still sunbathing.
"Response:   Steve is eating 2 times as much as his girlfriend so if she eats 6 tomatoes per day then steve eats 12 tomatoes per day.  
If each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week then we need to divide the total number of tomatoes that Steve needs with the number of tomatoes produced per vine.  So in this case, Steve needs 4 vines (12/3=4) to meet his daily demand for tomatoes."
Response:  If there are 20 friends, then John needs to divide them equally among 4 slices of pizza per person. So he will need 5 pizzas (20 / 4 = 5). However, since pizzas come in 8 slices per pie, John actually needs 6 pizzas (5 x 8 = 6) to ensure that each friend gets 4 slices. Therefore, John needs 6 pizzas.
"Response:  
Ram has 25 pens initially. When each pen contains enough ink for 1/5th of its capacity, he will be able to create 5 new pens using those 25 pens. So, after creating these 5 new pens, Ram now has 25 + 5 = 30 pens.  
Therefore, the final number of pens Ram gets is 30."
Response:   If Johnny had $20 initially (his allowance), plus an additional $10, that makes $30 total. Then, if the amount tripled in a year, we can multiply the original amount by three: $30 x 3 = $90. So, after one year, Johnny had $90.
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Mary = Joan - 2
Joan = Jessa + 5
Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:
Mary = Joan - 2
= 20 - (5 + 2)
= 13
Jessa = Joan + 5
= 20 + 5
= 25
So, the sum of their ages is:
13 + 25 = 38
Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 38 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we know that initially there were 1000 students in the hall. Then, 30% of them left through entrance A, so the number of students left is:  1000 x (1 - 0.3) = 700. Next, 3/5 of the remaining students left through entrance B, so the number of students left is:  700 x (1 - 0.6) = 420. Finally, the last group of students left through entrance C, so the number of students left is:  420 + (1000 - 700) = 520. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 520.
Response:  We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so if Robert has x candies, then James has x + 6 = 72 candies (since John has twice as many candies as Robert). Now we are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 72 and solve for x: x = 66. So, John has 66 - 6 = 60 more candies than James.
"Response:  
Dolly reads her book (1) + Pandora's book (1). So far, they have read 2 books together.  
Now, Dolly reads Pandora's book again (1), and Pandora reads Dolly's book again (1). Now they have read all four books in total! 
Therefore, the answer is 4."
"Response:   We know that there were initially 5 pen pals and now only 3 after Mike stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, we have to calculate how much time Mike spends writing per week for the remaining 3 pen pals.
We also know that each person sends 2 letters a week, which means they collectively send 4 letters (2 x 3 = 6) per week. Since Mike replies to each letter in kind, he writes 4 letters as well. Therefore, the total number of letters written per week is 10 (4 + 4).
Now, let's find out how long it takes Mike to write one letter. According to the question, Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so he can write 6 minutes / 1 minute = 6 pages per hour. Since he needs to reply to all 4 letters from his 3 pen pals, he spends 3 x 6 = 18 hours writing per week.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 18 hours."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason has a total of 1000 minutes in his phone plan for the entire month. Then, everyday he has a 15 minute call with his boss which is equal to 90 minutes (15 x 6 = 90) since there are 30 days in the month. So far, Jason has used up 90 + 300 = 490 minutes. Therefore, Jason has 1000 - 490 = 510 minutes remaining in his phone plan for the rest of the month.
"Response:  
1) Griffin started with 24 fries.  
2) Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 19 fries.   
3) Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so he took 10 more fries (twice 5 = 10). So now Griffin has 9 fries left.    
4) Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, which means she added an unknown amount to Griffin's total. 
Let's assume it was x fries. Now Griffin has x + 9 fries. 
5) Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle took, so he took 3 - 5 = -2 fries. This means Griffin gained 2 fries back! So now Griffin has x + 9 + 2 = x + 11 fries. 
6) Finally, we are told that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. Therefore, x + 11 = 27. Solving for x, we get x = 16. 
So Ginger gave Griffin 16 fries."
Response:  In the first aquarium, we have 4 snails. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, if there are x fish in the second aquarium, then there would be 2x fish in the first aquarium (since the difference is double). So, the total number of fish in both aquariums is equal to 4 + 2x = 6x. Therefore, there are 6x fish in each aquarium.  
"Response:  
First we need to calculate how many hours the makeup artist worked with jean during the whole project.  
$250/hour x 6 hours per day x 4 days per week = 960 hours 
Next we need to calculate how much money Jean paid to the makeup artist over the course of the project. 
$250/hour x 960 hours = $230,000 
Now let's apply the 10% discount given at the end of the project. 
$230,000 x.10 = $23,000 
So Jean paid a total of $230,000 + $23,000 = $253,000 to the makeup artist for the entire project."
Response:  We know that Isabella paid $X dollars towards the party expenses. Since she split the cost equally among herself and her two parents, we can write an equation as follows: X + (parent1's contribution) + (parent2's contribution) = Total Cost Where parent1's contribution is equal to $X/3, and parent2's contribution is also equal to $X/3. Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: X = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $106 So, each of Isabella's parents contributed $35 towards the party expenses ($106 / 3). Therefore, the answer is $35 per person.
Response:  The number of bags = 4. Each bag weight = 50 pounds. So total weight = 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Now, each pound of onion costs $1.50 so total amount spent = Total weight in pounds x Cost per pound = 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300. Therefore, the chef spent $300 to buy the onions.
"Response:  We know that Sue consumed x times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. So, if her sister ate 5 cookies, then Sue ate 5x cookies. Then we are told that on Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, her sister ate 5 + 6 = 11 cookies on Tuesday. Now let's calculate the number of calories Sue consumed compared to her sister:
Sue consumed x + (5 + 6) = x + 11 cookies. Since each cookie contains 200 calories, Sue consumed x + 11 \* 200 = x + 2200 calories more than her sister.
Therefore, the answer is 2200 calories."
