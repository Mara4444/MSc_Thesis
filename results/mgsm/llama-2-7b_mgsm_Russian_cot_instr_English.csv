"Response:  

1) Utkina Jennet lays 16 eggs per day. 
2) She eats three eggs for breakfast every morning. 
3) She bakes cakes for her friends using four eggs each day. 
4) The remaining eggs are sold at the farmer's market for $2 each. 

Now let's calculate how much money she earns from selling eggs at the farmers market: 

16 (eggs laid daily) - 3 (eggs consumed for breakfast) = 13 eggs left over. 
13 x $2 (price of one egg) = $26 (daily income from egg sales)."
Response:  We need 2 motkes of blue thread and half as much white thread. If we assume that one motke of blue thread is equal to x units of length, then one motke of white thread will be equal to x/2 units of length. Since we need 2 motkes of blue thread, we need a total of 2x units of length of blue thread. And since we also need half as much white thread, we need (x/2) units of length of white thread. Therefore, in total, we need x + (x/2) = 3x/2 units of length of thread. So, the answer is 3x/2.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Josh paid for the house and the renovation costs. Then, we can find out what percentage increase in value he received. Finally, we will divide that percentage by 100 to convert it into a decimal.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house and renovations.
Josh paid $80,000 for the house + $50,000 for renovations = $130,000.

Step 2: Find the percentage increase in value.
To do this, we first need to find the new value of the house after renovations:
New value = Original price x (1 + Percentage increase)
= $80,000 x (1 + 150%)
= $80,000 x 2.5
= $200,000

Now we can calculate the percentage increase:
Percentage increase = ($200,000 - $80,000) / $80,000
= $120,000 / $80,000
= 150%

Step 3: Convert the percentage increase to a decimal.
150% is equal to 1.5 in decimals.

Therefore, Josh received a 1.5 or 50% increase in value on his investment."
Response:  James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each for a total distance of 180 meters per week (3 x 60).
Response:  We know that Wendy gives her chickens three meals a day and each meal contains three cups of mixed feed. She has 20 chickens in total. So, she needs to give them a total of 3 x 20 = 60 cups of mixed feed per day. Since there are three meals per day, she needs to give them 60 / 3 = 20 cups of mixed feed at each meal. Therefore, the last meal of the day would require 20 cups of mixed feed as well.
"Response:  We know that one stakan costs $5 and every second stakan is 60% of this price, so we can write an equation for the cost of each stakan as follows:

Cost of first stakan = $5 (since it's not a second stakan)
Cost of second stakan = 60% of $5 = 0.6 x $5 = $3
Cost of third stakan = 60% of $5 = 0.6 x $5 = $3
...
Cost of nth stakan = 60% of $5 = 0.6 x $5 = $3

Now, let's find out how much Kaijalar needs to pay in total for 16 stakans:
Total cost = Cost of first stakan + Cost of second stakan +... + Cost of nth stakan
= $5 + $3 +... + $3 = 16 x $3 = $48

So, Kaijalar needs to pay $48 for 16 stakans."
"Response:  We know that in Toulouse there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston. So if there are x sheep in Charleston, then there are 2x sheep in Toulouse.
We also know that in Charleston there are four times as many sheep as in Seattle. So if there are y sheep in Seattle, then there are 4y sheep in Charleston.
Now we have two equations:

1) Twice as many sheep in Toulouse as in Charleston: 2x =? (sheep in Toulouse)
2) Four times as many sheep in Charleston as in Seattle: 4y =? (sheep in Charleston)

Let's solve for x and y first:

1) 2x = 2(?) = 2(20) = 40
2) 4y = 4(?) = 4(5) = 20

So there are 40 sheep in Toulouse, 20 sheep in Charleston, and 20 sheep in Seattle. Together they have:

40 + 20 + 20 = 80 sheep."
Response:  We know that Carla can download 2 GB per minute and it takes 20 minutes for the forced reboot to install updates. So she has downloaded 2 x 20 = 40 GB before the reboot. After the reboot, she needs to download another 160 GB (200 - 40). Since she can download 2 GB/minute, it will take her 80 minutes to download the remaining 160 GB. Therefore, the total time required for downloading the file is 20 + 80 = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes.
"Response:  We know that John drives at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 60 mi/h x 3 h
= 180 miles

Next, we know that John spends 2 hours in traffic, which means he travels at a constant speed of:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 180 miles / 2 h
= 90 miles per hour

Now, let's calculate how far John is from home after 4 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 90 mi/h x 4 h
= 360 miles

So, after 4 hours, John is 360 miles away from home."
"Response:  We know that Eliza works for 45 hours this week and her regular hourly wage is $10. She also receives overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular rate for any hours worked beyond 40 hours per week. So, we can calculate her total earnings as follows:  
Total Earnings = (45 hours x $10/hour) + (5 hours x $10 x 1.2) Total Earnings = $450 + $60 Total Earnings = $510 Therefore, Eliza earned $510 for the week."
"Response:  We know that in the first month there were 60 downloads, and in the second month, three times as many downloads occurred (i.e., 180). In the third month, however, there was a 30% decrease from the previous month, so we need to subtract 30% of the total number of downloads for the third month.

Total number of downloads for the third month = Total number of downloads for the second month x 3 - (30% of the total number of downloads for the second month)
= 180 x 3 - (30% of 180)
= 540 - (30% of 180)
= 540 - 54
= 486

Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three months is:
486 + 180 + 60 = 726."
"Response:  We know that Tulia bought 3 duzhiny of pancakes for $68 per dozen, 2 duzhiny of mini-keks for $80 per dozen, and 6 duzhiny of mini-chizheykov for $55 per dozen. So we need to calculate the total cost of all purchases.

First, let's calculate the cost of pancakes: 3 duzhiny x $68 per dozen = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of mini-keks: 2 duzhiny x $80 per dozen = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mini-chizheykov: 6 duzhiny x $55 per dozen = $330.

Finally, let's add up all the costs: $204 + $160 + $330 = $794.

So, the total cost of all purchases is $794."
Response:  We know that Carlos will spend $90 to plant the lemon tree and $3 per year for maintenance. So, in total, he will spend $90 + $3 = $93 over the first three years. Since each lemon tree produces 7 lemons per year, Carlos can sell 7 x $1.5 = $10.50 worth of lemons per year. Therefore, it will take him 93 / $10.50 = approximately 9 years to start making a profit from his lemon tree.
Response:  We know that Melanie sold third of her vacuum cleaners in green house, which means she had 3 x (10 - 1/3) = 3 x 7 = 21 vacuum cleaners at first. Then she sold 2 more to red houses, so she had 21 - 2 = 19 left. Finally, she sold half of what was left to orange house, so she had 19 / 2 = 9 left. Therefore, Melanie had 9 vacuum cleaners initially.
"Response:  We know that 20% of the students enrolled in modern dance and 25% enrolled in jazz dance. That means together they make up 45% (20 + 25) of all students. So, if we subtract 45% from 100%, we get the percentage of students who enrolled in hip hop dance.

Percentage = 100 - 45 = 55%

Therefore, 55% of all students enrolled in hip hop dance."
"Response:  We know that the market for jewelry will grow by 2.5% and the market for electronics will grow by 1.2%. So we need to calculate how much profit each option will bring in at the end of the month.  
For jewelry, if the market grows by 2.5%, then the value of the $5000 investment will increase by 2.5%. To calculate this, multiply $5000 by 1 + (2.5/100) = 1.025, or an increase of $125. So the final value of the investment in jewelry would be $5000 x 1.025 = $5125.  
For electronics, if the market grows by 1.2%, then the value of the $8000 investment will increase by 1.2%. To calculate this, multiply $8000 by 1 + (1.2/100) = 1.012, or an increase of $80. So the final value of the investment in electronics would be $8000 x 1.012 = $8096.  
Now let's compare the two options. The highest profit at the end of the month is from the electronics option, with a profit of $8096 - $8000 = $96. In contrast, the profit from the jewelry option is $5125 - $5000 = $125. Therefore, based solely on these calculations, the best choice for the merchant would be to invest in electronics."
"Response:  We know that both trains travel for 80 miles west and then 150 miles north. So we can calculate their total distance traveled as follows:

Train A (west): 80 miles + Train B (west): 80 miles = 160 miles
Train A (north): 150 miles + Train B (north): 150 miles = 300 miles
Total distance traveled by each train over two days:
Train A: 160 + 300 = 460 miles
Train B: 160 + 300 = 460 miles
Therefore, each train has traveled 460 miles over the two days."
"Response:  We know that Jill works as an instructor for 35 hours per week and as a cheerleading coach for 15 hours per week. She works for 50 weeks in a year. So, her total number of working hours per year is:  
35 hours/week x 50 weeks = 1750 hours/year (as an instructor) + 15 hours/week x 50 weeks = 750 hours/year (as a cheerleading coach) = 2500 hours/year. 
Now we need to calculate how much she earns per hour as an instructor and as a cheerleading coach separately. As an instructor, she earns $20/hour, so her annual income from this job would be:  
20$/hour x 1750 hours = $35,000 per year. As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30/hour, so her annual income from this job would be:  
30$/hour x 750 hours = $22,500 per year. Therefore, Jill's total annual salary is:  
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500 per year."
Response:  We know that Клер makes an omelette with 3 eggs each morning for breakfast. This means she uses 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she will use 21 x 4 = 84 eggs in a month. So, to calculate how many dozen eggs she will eat in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen). Therefore, the answer is:  84 / 12 = 7 dozen eggs.
"Response:  We know that Marissa has already walked for 4 miles in the first hour and then another 2 miles in the second hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles. To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining distance of 6 miles, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled (in this case, the remaining 6 miles), r is the rate at which she is traveling (the speed), and t is the time it takes her to travel that distance. Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we know that her rate (speed) is 4 miles/hour. So, if she walks for x hours to cover the remaining distance of 6 miles, we can set up the equation as follows: 

d = rt
6 miles = 4 miles/hour x hours
x = 6 / 4
x = 1.5 hours
Therefore, Marissa needs to walk for 1.5 hours to cover the remaining distance of 6 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour."
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that is two-thirds water and one-third orange juice. That means we have 6.67 liters (2/3) of water in the orange juice. Now, when we add 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three-fifths water, we will have:

15 x 3/5 = 9 liters of water in the pineapple juice

So, in total, we have:

6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water

Therefore, there are 15.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of juice."
"Response:  We know that Raeymond is 6 years older than Samantha and has a son who is currently 23 years old. So, if Samantha is currently 31 years old, we can calculate when Raymond's son was born.

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth = 31 + 6 = 37

So, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago, when Raymond was 37 years old. Therefore, Raymond's son was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago."
Response:  We know that Billy has 8 customers and his first 3 customers buy one DVD each. So, he sells 3 DVDs to his first 3 customers. His next 2 customers buy two DVDs each, so he sells another 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs. In total, Billy sells 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs on Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that the candle burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour. If we want to find out how many centimeters the candle will be shorter after burning for 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00), we need to calculate the total distance it will burn during this time.
Total distance = 4 hours x 2 cm/hour = 8 cm
So, after burning for 4 hours, the candle will be 8 cm shorter than its original length."
Response:  We know that Kale bought the book for $19.50 with a discount of 25%. So we can start by finding out what the original price was before the discount. To do this, we can use the following formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage). In this case, the discount percentage is 25%, so we can plug in the values as follows: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00. Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.
Response:  We know that Mary ordered one dish of chicken which costs $12, and she also bought 5 packets of milk at $3 each, so the total cost of milk is $3 x 5 = $15. Additionally, she purchased 4 apples at $1.50 each, so the total cost of apples is $1.50 x 4 = $6. Therefore, the total amount Mary paid is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. Since the problem states that Mary paid $50, we can set up an equation as follows: $33 + x = $50, where x represents the number of boxes of pizza Mary ordered. Solving for x, we get: x = $50 - $33 = $17. So, Mary ordered 17 boxes of pizza, since each box costs $8.50.
"Response:  We know that Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. So, we can start by calculating how much he spent on each type of item.  
Shorts: 3 pairs x $16.50 per pair = $49.50  
Pants: 3 pairs x $22.50 per pair = $67.50  
Shoes: 3 pairs x $42 per pair = $126  
Now, let's add up all these amounts to find out how much Mishka spent in total: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243  
Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all his clothing items."
Response:  We know that Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every evening and buys boxes of ice cream with 15 portions each for $4 per box. So she consumes 1/15 of a box (or 15 portions) every day. Since there are 30 days in May, she will consume 30 x 15 = 450 portions of ice cream during the month. Therefore, her total expenditure on ice cream for the month will be 450 x $4 = $1800.
"Response:  We know that Henry rode his bicycle for 60 miles and made two stops. The first stop was after 20 miles, so he rode for 20 miles before stopping. To find out how many miles he rode between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the total distance traveled. In this case, we can calculate it as follows:  

Total distance = 60 miles 
Distance of first stop = 20 miles 
Distance between stops = Total distance - Distance of first stop 
= 60 miles - 20 miles 
= 40 miles 
Therefore, Henry rode 40 miles between his two stops."
"Response:  We know that Gloria has a budget of $100 for shoes and she is considering two pairs of boots and two pairs of high heels. The total cost of the boots is x dollars, and the total cost of the high heels is 2x dollars. Since Gloria has a budget of $100, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 100... (1)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x = 100... (2)

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 33... (3)

So, the boots cost $33 each. Now, let's find out how much the high heels cost. Using equation (1), we can see that the total cost of the high heels is 2x. Substituting x = 33 from equation (3), we get:

2(33) = 66... (4)

Therefore, the high heels cost $66 per pair."
"Response:  We know that Darrell is 7 years older than Allen, so we can write an equation based on this information:
Darrell's age = Allen's age + 7
We also know that their combined age is 162 years old:
Darrell's age + Allen's age = 162... (1)
Now, let's substitute Allen's age into the first equation using the second equation:
Darrell's age = Allen's age + 7
Darrell's age = (162 - Allen's age) + 7
Substituting the value of 162 for the sum of their ages, we get:
Darrell's age = (162 - Allen's age) + 7
Darrell's age = 162 - Allen's age + 7
Simplifying and solving for Darrell's age, we have:
Darrell's age = 162 - Allen's age + 7
Darrell's age = 155
Therefore, if Allen is x years old now, Darrell will be 155 - x + 7 years old in 10 years."
Response:  We know that the first friend said there are 80 marshmallows in the jar. The second friend said there are 20 more than half of what the first friend said, which means there are 20 + (half of 80) = 20 + 40 = 60 marshmallows. The third friend said there are 25% more than what the first friend said, so we need to calculate 25% of 80: 80 x 0.25 = 20. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows in the jar is 60 + 20 = 80. So, their average guess is 80.
"Response:  There are 7 days in a week and John spends 0.5 hours per day with each dog, so he spends:

0.5 x 10 = 5 hours/day

Now, let's calculate how many hours John spends on his dogs in a week:

5 x 7 = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his 10 dogs."
"Response:  We know that there are 110 coins in total and 30 more gold than silver. So if we subtract the number of silver coins from the total, we will get the number of gold coins.

Let X be the number of silver coins. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given:
X + 30 = 110... (1)

Now, let Y be the number of gold coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can write another equation:
Y = X + 30... (2)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
Y + 30 = 110... (3)

Solving for Y, we get:
Y = 80... (4)

Therefore, Grethchen has 80 gold coins."
"Response:  We know that Aaron has more than half of Raymond's precious stones (more precisely, 5 times as many). So if Raymond has 40 precious stones, then Aaron will have:

40 x 5 = 200 precious stones

Now we are told that Shivon has fewer precious stones than Aaron but not less than half as many. Therefore, Shivon will have:

200 - x precious stones

where x is the number of precious stones owned by Shivon. To find x, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:

x + 2 < 200... (1)

Since Shivon owns two precious stones and the sum of their values must be less than 200, we can write this inequality. Now let's solve for x using the first equation:

x + 2 = 200

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 198

Therefore, Shivon owns 198 precious stones."
"Response:  We know that Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes and earns 4 points in the first 20 minutes. In the second 20 minutes, he earns 25% more than in the first 20 minutes. So, if he earned x points in the first 20 minutes, he will earn (1.25x) = 1.25x + 0 points in the second 20 minutes. Therefore, the total number of points Mike earned is:

4 + 1.25(4) = 4 + 5 = 9 points."
Response:  We know that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day and each yogurt costs $5.00 for 4 yogurts. So he spends $10.00 per day on yogurt. To find out how much he spends in 30 days, we can multiply $10.00 by 30: $$ \text{Total cost} = 10.00 \times 30 = 300.00 $$ Therefore, Terry spends $300.00 on yogurt for 30 days.
Response:  First, we know that John has 13 sets of Lego and he sells each set for $15. So, if he sells all his Lego sets, he will have $180 (13 x $15). After buying video games, he spends $160 (8 x $20) and has $5 left. Therefore, there are 5 sets of Lego left with John ($180 - $160 = $5).
"Response:  We know that John runs for 3 days in a week and each day he runs for x hours. Since he runs for 3 days, his total running time per week is 3x hours. We also know that he runs 60 miles per week, so we can set up the equation:  

3x = 60 miles/week  

Now, let's consider the second part of the problem. We know that John runs for half as long on the remaining two days as he does on the first day. So if he runs for x hours on the first day, he runs for (1/2)x hours on the other two days. Therefore, the total running time per week is:  

Total Running Time = 3x + (1/2)x + (1/2)x = 5x/2 hours/week  

Now we have two equations:  

3x = 60 miles/week  

5x/2 = 60 miles/week  

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  

x = 24 miles/day  

Therefore, John runs at a pace of 24 miles per day or 144 miles per week."
"Response:  We know that Danah can run at a speed of 4 times faster than walking, so if she walks at a speed of x miles per hour, she can run at a speed of 4x miles per hour. Also, we know that she can run truely at a speed of 3 miles per hour. So, let's set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the speed at which Danah walks (in miles per hour)

Danah can walk for 2/3 of the time, so she will walk for 2/3 of 6 hours = 4 hours

She can run for 1/3 of the time, so she will run for 1/3 of 6 hours = 2 hours

Total distance traveled = Distance walked + Distance ran
= 4x(4 hours) + 3(2 hours)
= 16x + 6

Now we need to find out what value of x will make the total distance traveled equal to 6 miles.

We know that Danah can walk at most 4 miles in one hour, so the maximum distance she can travel in 6 hours is 4x(6 hours) = 24 miles

Therefore, the only possible value of x is 1 mile per hour, since this would allow her to cover a distance of exactly 24 miles in 6 hours.

So, Danah can walk 1 mile per hour and run 3 miles per hour, and she will cover a total distance of 24 miles in 6 hours."
"Response:  We know that iPhone Брендона is four times older than iPhone Бена and two years younger than iPhone Сьюзи. So we can start with some basic equations based on this information:

iPhone Брендона = 4 x iPhone Бена + 2 (since iPhone Брендона is four times older than iPhone Бена)

Now we are given that iPhone Бена is 2 years old, so we can substitute that into our equation:

iPhone Брендона = 4 x 2 + 2

Simplifying the equation:

iPhone Брендона = 8 + 2

iPhone Брендона = 10

Therefore, iPhone Брендона is 10 years old."
"Response:  We know that without the sapphire, Polly can throw the gold spear to a distance of 400 feet (the range of the dragon's flames). With the sapphire, she can throw it three times as far, or 1200 feet. So if we set up an equation based on this information, we get:

Without Sapphire: x = 400
With Sapphire: x = 3x(400) = 1200

Now, we need to find out how far away from the dragon Polly could stand and still hit it with the golden spear when holding the sapphire. To do this, we subtract the distance she can throw the spear without the sapphire (400) from the distance she can throw it with the sapphire (1200):

Distance with Sapphire - Distance without Sapphire = 1200 - 400 = 800 feet

So, Polly could stand 800 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the golden spear when holding the sapphire."
Response:  We know that each pirog was cut into 8 pieces and there were 5 pies in total. So, the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40. If after the guests took their pieces, there were 14 left, we can subtract 14 from 40 to find out how many pieces each guest took: 40 - 14 = 26. Therefore, each guest took approximately 26 pieces of pie.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 portions in a 300g package of chips and each portion contains 250 calories. So, to calculate how many grams you can eat while staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories, we need to subtract the number of calories you have already consumed (1800) from your total daily calorie goal. This gives us:  

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories remaining  

Since each portion contains 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the number of calories per portion to determine how many portions we can eat:  

200 / 250 = 0.8 portions or 400 grams of chips (since each portion is 250 calories x 0.8 = 200 grams)"
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Charlie will make from selling one candle. We know that he can make 10 cone-shaped candles from one pound of beeswax and that each candle costs $2. So, if he sells one candle for $2, his profit is:

$2 - ($1/10) = $2 - $0.10 = $1.90

Now let's calculate the total profit Charlie will get if he sells all 20 candles:

Total Profit = Number of Candles x Profit per Candle
= 20 x $1.90
= $38

So, Charlie will receive a total profit of $38 if he sells all 20 candles at $2 each."
Response:  We know that Meredith spent 4 hours studying and writing each article for her blog. She wrote 5 articles on Monday (5 x 4 = 20 hours). On Tuesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Monday (2 x 5 = 10), so she spent 2 times 4 = 8 hours more than on Monday, for a total of 20 + 8 = 28 hours. On Wednesday, she wrote two times as many articles as on Tuesday (2 x 10 = 20), so she spent 2 times 4 = 8 hours more than on Tuesday, for a total of 28 + 8 = 36 hours. Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 20 + 28 + 36 = 84 hours writing articles for her blog over three days.
"Response:  We know that Candice had 80 stickers in her bag before she went to work and she used 23 of them at work. So, the number of stickers left with Candice is:

80 - 23 = 57

Now, we know that Candice bought an pack of stickers while she was out shopping. She put one sticker on each of the 220 cups of coffee she served at work. So, the total number of stickers she used from the pack is:

220 x 1 = 220

Since she only has 57 stickers left, we can set up the equation:

220 = 57 + x

Where x is the number of stickers in the pack she bought. Solving for x, we get:

x = 220 - 57

x = 163

So, there were 163 stickers in the pack that Candice bought."
"Response:  We know that John bought twice as many red scarves as blue ones. So if he bought x blue scarves, he bought 2x red scarves. The total cost of all the scarves is 200$. Since each blue scarf costs 40$, we can write an equation:

40x + 2(2x) \* (1.5) = 200

Where (1.5) represents the fact that red scarves are 50% more expensive than blue ones. Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So John bought 8 blue scarves and 16 red scarves."
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a piece of wire (length = 4 feet) to support her tomato plants in the garden. She cut it into pieces (each piece is 6 inches long). So we can start with the length of the original wire:

4 feet = 48 inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot)

Now, let's divide the total length by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece =?

Do you see how to find out how many pieces she got?"
"Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 kвартиры (apartments). So, the total number of apartments is:

15 x 8 = 120

Now we need to find out how many of these apartments are not occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, so we can calculate the number of unoccupied apartments as follows:

120 - (3/4) x 120 = 120 - 90 = 30

So, there are 30 unoccupied apartments in the building."
Response:  We know that Lloyd has 252 eggs per day and sells them for $2 per dozen. So, he sells 252 / 12 = 21 dozen eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he sells 21 x 7 = 147 dozen eggs per week. At $2 per dozen, his total revenue from egg sales is 147 x 2 = $294 per week.
Response:  We know that Tom's ship can move at a speed of 10 miles per hour and it takes 3 hours to travel from 13:00 to 16:00 (9 hours in total). So, we need to calculate how far he will go during those 9 hours. To do this, we multiply the speed by the time: 10 mi/h x 9 h = 90 miles. Now, we need to find out how long it will take him to return at a speed of 6 miles per hour. Again, we use multiplication: 6 mi/h x distance / speed = distance / 6. In this case, the distance is 90 miles, so we get: 90 mi / 6 mi/h = 15 h. Therefore, it will take Tom 15 hours to return.
"Response:  We know that Juraya needs to remove 15 pounds from his portfolio and he has three types of items: comics, which weigh 1/4 pound each; and toys, which weigh 1/2 pound each. To find out how many toys Juraya needs to withdraw, let's divide the total weight he needs to remove (15 pounds) by the weight of each item type:

15 pounds / 1/4 pound = 60 comics
15 pounds / 1/2 pound = 30 toys

Therefore, Juraya needs to withdraw 60 comics and 30 toys from his portfolio to reach his goal."
"Response: 

Day with more profit - Friday (repaired 12 light vehicle tires and did not repair truck tires).

Profit from repaired light vehicle tires = 12 x $40 = $480

Total profit for the day = $480

Therefore, the mechanic earned more profit on Friday than on Thursday."
"Response:  If Patches (Пэтчи) had three times as many kittens as were taken from the shelter, and Tricks (Трикси) had 12 kittens, then together they must have had:  
3 x (number of kittens taken from shelter) + 12 = total number of kittens  
We know that 7 kittens were taken from the shelter, so we can substitute this value into the equation:  
3 x 7 + 12 =?  
Solve for the unknown variable (the total number of kittens):  
21 + 12 = 33  
Therefore, there are currently 33 kittens in the family Daoutfair."
Response:  If Dijan has 30 ledenets and eats 2 of them, then he has 30 - 2 = 28 ledenets left. Since each package contains 2 ledenets, Dijan can make 28 / 2 = 14 packages.
"Response:  If Peter has $42 and he spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn each time, how many times can he go to the movies?
We know that $42 / ($7 + $7) =?
Simplifying:
$42 / $14 =?
Solving for x (the number of trips):
x = $42 / $14
x = 3
So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his $42."
"Response:  We know that the weight of each box is 15 pounds and there are x boxes in total. So, the total weight of all boxes is 15x pounds. Now we need to calculate how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the maximum weight limit of the bridge (5000 pounds). To do this, we subtract the weight of the driver and empty truck from the maximum weight limit:  
5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds  
Now we divide the remaining weight limit by the weight of one box to find out how many boxes can be loaded:  
1245 / 15 = 83 boxes 
So, you can load up to 83 boxes onto the truck without exceeding the maximum weight limit of the bridge."
Response:  We know that Steven made an online order and his total bill was $40.00. The delivery service added a commission of 25% to his total bill, which is $40.00 x 25% = $10.00. So, Steven had to pay a total of $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00 for his order. Additionally, he paid $4.00 as a tip, bringing the total cost to $50.00 + $4.00 = $54.00. Therefore, the final price of the products for Steven after all additional fees was $54.00.
"Response:  We have 6 groups of 20 berries each and 67 individual berries scattered throughout the bush. To find out how many berries there are in total, we need to add up all these numbers. So, let's do that:

6 x 20 = 120 (total number of berries in groups)
+ 67 = 187 (total number of berries)

Therefore, there are 187 berries on the malinovom cueste!"
"Response:  We know that there are 25 oranges in total and we have to find out how many of them are good. So, let X be the number of good oranges.
We also know that 1 orange is rotten (gnilyi), so there must be one bad orange. This means that X + 1 = 25, where X is the number of good oranges.
Now, we know that 20% of the oranges are not ripe (nezreli). This means that if there are x good oranges, then 20% of x = 20/100 \* x = 0.2x is not ripe.
So, the total number of not-ripe oranges is 0.2x. Since there are only two kinds of oranges - good and not ripe, the sum of all oranges must be equal to the total number of oranges:
X + 0.2x + 1 = 25
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3.2x + 1 = 25
Solving for x, we get:
x = 8
Therefore, there are 8 good oranges."
"Response:  First, we know that Jenet paid $500 for the material to make the brooch. Then she paid $800 to the jeweler for making it. Finally, she paid an additional 10% of the total cost as insurance. So, let's calculate the total cost first:  
$500 (material) + $800 (jeweler's fee) = $1300  
Now, let's calculate the insurance amount:  
10% of $1300 = $130  
So, in total, Jenet paid:  
$500 (material) + $800 (jeweler's fee) + $130 (insurance) = $2430"
"Response:  We know that Mars will receive an annual pension of $50,000 for 40 years if she works for the same company. After 20 years, her pension will increase by 5% per year. If she retires after 30 years, we need to calculate her pension based on the amount she would have received in those 30 years.

Let X be the total amount Mars would have received in 30 years (including the 20-year increment). Since she receives $50,000 annually, X = 50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000.

After 20 years, Mars' pension increases by 5% each year, so her pension for the last 10 years is:

X + (5% of X) = $1,500,000 + ($1,500,000 x 5%) = $1,500,000 + $75,000 = $1,575,000

Therefore, Mars' annual pension after 30 years would be $1,575,000 / 30 = $52,500 per year."
"Response:  We know that Alina paid $140 per month for the streaming service and that she paid less in the second half of the year than in the first half. So we can start by calculating how much she paid in total for the first six months:  
6 months x $140 = $840  
Now let's subtract the amount she paid in the second half of the year, which was 10% less than before:  
$840 - (10% of $840) = $840 - $84 = $756  
Therefore, Alina paid a total of $756 for the entire year."
Response:  We know that Sofia has driven 100 miles since her last fill-up and she used 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank. This means she got 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left in her tank. Since there are 231 miles per gallon (a rough estimate), Sofia can drive approximately  8 \* 231 = 1850 miles before running out of gas.
"Response:  We know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time (1 hour) three times a week. To find out how many hours he spends watching TV and reading over four weeks, we can multiply the number of hours per week by 4. So, first let's calculate how many hours he spends watching TV each week:  
2 hours/week x 4 weeks = 8 hours  
Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends reading each week:  
1 hour/week x 4 weeks = 4 hours  
So, in total, Jim spends 8 + 4 = 12 hours watching TV and reading over four weeks."
Response:  We know that each school has sent two teams - one for girls and one for boys. Each team consists of five players. Therefore, the total number of students sent by each school is 2 x 5 = 10 students per school. Since there are four schools, the total number of students participating in the tournament is 4 x 10 = 40 students.
Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds in the chest, and there were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. This means we can start with the number of rubies as follows: Rubies = Diamonds - 35 Rubies = 175 - 35 Rubies = 140 Now we know that there were twice as many sapphires as rubies. So let's use this information to find out how many sapphires there were: Sapphires = Rubies x 2 Sapphires = 140 x 2 Sapphires = 280 Finally, we know that there were 175 diamonds in total, so we can add up all the numbers we found earlier to get our final answer: Total Number of precious stones = Diamonds + Rubies + Sapphires Total Number of precious stones = 175 + 140 + 280 Total Number of precious stones = 695 Therefore, there were 695 precious stones in the chest!
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls in school and each teacher has 5 students. So, if we divide 60 by 5, we get 12 teachers needed to teach all the girls. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we need to double the number of teachers to account for the boys. Therefore, we need 2 x 12 = 24 teachers in total.
"Response:  We know that Baily has $x dollars at first and receives $5 per week for 8 weeks. So she gets a total of $5 x 8 = 40 additional dollars. Therefore, after 8 weeks, Baily has $x + 40 dollars. Since she only has $100 left, we can set up an equation:

x + 40 = 100... (1)

Now we need to solve for x, which is the initial amount of money Baily had. To do this, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x + 40 - 40 = 100 - 40... (2)

Simplifying, we get:

x = 60... (3)

So, initially, Baily had $60."
"Response: 

1. How many classes does Judy teach per day?
2. How many students are in each class?
3. What is the daily income of Judy?
4. How much does she earn in one week (7 days)?

Now let's calculate:

1. Judy teaches 5 classes per day (Monday to Friday).
2. Each class has 15 students, so there are 5 x 15 = 75 students per day.
3. Daily income = 75 students x $15/student = $1125 per day.
4. Weekly income = $1125 x 7 days = $7925 per week."
Response:  If there are 20 instructions in one recipe and twice as many (i.e., 40) in the second recipe, then to prepare two dishes, we need to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.
"Response:  We know that Tommi sells brownies for $3 each and chocolate chip cookies for $4 each. So if he sells 43 brownies, he will get:

43 x $3 = $130

And if he sells 23 chocolate chip cookies, he will get:

23 x $4 = $92

In total, Tommi will collect:

$130 + $92 = $222

Therefore, Tommi will collect $222 from selling his baked goods."
"Response:  We know that each phone costs $150 and there are five phones in total. So, the total cost is:  
$150 x 5 = $750 
Now we need to calculate how much Shila will pay monthly for three months. Since she bought the phones on credit with an annual interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for calculating the monthly payment amount:  
Monthly Payment Amount = Total Cost / (1 + Interest Rate)^Number of Months  
In this case, the number of months is 3. Plugging in the values, we get:  
Monthly Payment Amount = $750 / (1 + 0.02)^3  
= $750 / 1.0486  
= $719.24  
So, Shila will have to pay $719.24 per month for three months to cover the cost of the five mobile phones."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Artie will make from each type of flower. Then we can add up all the amounts to find out his total earnings for today. 
Barhatics: 12 x $2.74 = $33.04
Petunias: 9 x $1.87 = $16.93
Begonias: 17 x $2.12 = $35.52
Total earnings: $33.04 + $16.93 + $35.52 = $85.49"
"Response:  We know that each level of the sand castle has half the area of the level below it. So if the top level has an area of 16 square feet, then the second level will have half that area, or 8 square feet. The third level will have half the area of the second level, which is 4 square feet. And the bottom level (the first level) will have half the area of the third level, which is also 4 square feet. Therefore, the average area of each level is:

(16 + 8 + 4 + 4) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8 square feet per level."
"Response:  We know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1/2 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days and then 2 cups per day for the rest of its life. Since there are 110 cups in one package, we can calculate how many packages she will need for each period as follows:  
For the first 180 days:  
1/2 cup x 180 days = 90 cups  
Since there are 110 cups in one package, Cecilia will need 90 / 110 = 8 packages for the first 180 days.  
For the rest of the puppy's life (let's assume it lives for 10 years):  
2 cups x 365 days x 10 years = 7300 cups  
Since there are 110 cups in one package, Cecilia will need 7300 / 110 = 66.36 packages for the rest of the puppy's life.  
Therefore, Cecilia will need a total of 8 + 66.36 = 74.36 packages of dog food for the first year and approximately 66.36 packages per year for the rest of the puppy's life."
Response:  We know that Rae stirs in half as much laundry as Sarah and David together. So if Sarah does 4 times more laundry than David, then Rae does half of (4 x David) = 2xDavid. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Rae does 2xDavid = 800 pounds of laundry. Now we need to find out how much David does. We know that David does less than Rae, so David does 800 - Rae = 800 - 400 = 400 pounds of laundry. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Rae and David is 800 - 400 = 400 pounds.
"Response:  If Vinson buys 18 flowers at a price of $2.50 per pack of 3, then he will spend:

18 x $2.50 = $45

If he buys them in packs of 2 for $1 each, then he will spend:

18 x $1 = $18

So, by buying the flowers in packs of 2, Vinson saves:

$45 - $18 = $27

Therefore, Vinson economizes $27 by buying the flowers in packs of 2 instead of packs of 3."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the discount that John will receive as a new client. We know that the discount is 30% of the original price. So, if the original price is x, then the discount will be 30% of x, which is 0.3x. Now, let's find out what the final price after the discount will be. We can do this by subtracting the discount from the original price: x - 0.3x = x - 0.3x. Simplifying this equation, we get x = 70$. Therefore, the grooming cost for John's dog will be $70.
Response:  We know that two girls took 1/6 of 24 liters each, so together they took 2/6 x 24 = 8 liters. Then a boy took 6 liters more, so in total we have 8 + 6 = 14 liters left.
"Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 stickers initially and then he bought 21 more in the store. So, he has a total of:

10 + 21 = 31

stickers now. Then, he received 23 more as a gift on his birthday, so he has:

31 + 23 = 54

stickers altogether. Next, we know that he gave 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with:

54 - 9 = 45

stickers left. Therefore, there are 45 stickers remaining with Charlie."
"Response:  We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than Grace, so if Grace weighs x pounds, then Alex weighs x - 2 pounds. Now, we are told that their combined weight is equal to 4 times Grace's weight, so we can write an equation:
x + (x - 2) = 4x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 4x
Solving for x, we get:
x = 20 pounds
So, both Grace and Alex weigh 20 pounds each. Their combined weight is 20 + 20 = 40 pounds."
Response:  We know that Dan has 3 bushes of roses and each bush has 25 roses. So, in total, he has 3 x 25 = 75 roses. Now, we need to find out how many thorns (шипы) are there in all these roses. Each rose has 8 thorns, so we multiply 75 by 8 to get the total number of thorns: 75 x 8 = 600 thorns.
"Response:  We know that the team played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost. So if we let W be the number of wins and L be the number of losses, we can write an equation based on this information:
W + L = 22... (1)
We also know that the team won 8 more than they lost, so we can say:
W - L = 8... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (W and L). Can you use these equations to find out how many games the team won?"
"Response:  We know that Dzhinn has been going on vacation for four times since he was 23 years old and now he is 34 years old. So, in total, he has gone on vacation for 11 years (23 + 23 + 23 + 23 = 11).
Now let's count how many fragments of the blanket he has from each year of his vacation:
Year 1 - 23 years old: 1 fragment
Year 2 - 24 years old: 2 fragments (one for each arm)
Year 3 - 25 years old: 3 fragments (one for each arm and one for the body)
...
Year 11 - 34 years old: 11 fragments (one for each arm and one for the body)
In total, Dzhinn has 11 + 2 + 3 +... + 11 = 67 fragments of the blanket!"
"Response:  We know that the alarm clock rang three times in total and each time it rang for a different amount of time. The first time it rang four times, the second time it rang three times longer than the first time, and the third time it rang half as long as the second time. So we can start with the following equation:

4 + (3 x) + (1/2 x) = 3

Now we need to find out what ""x"" is. To do this, we can simplify the equation:

4 + 3x + 1/2x = 3

Combine like terms:

7 1/2 + 3x = 3

Subtract 7 1/2 from both sides:

3x = 2 1/2

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2/3

So the alarm clock rang 2/3 of the way through the third time it went off. Therefore, the total number of rings was:

4 + 3(2/3) + 1/2(2/3) = 4 + 6/3 + 1/6 = 12

The alarm clock rang 12 times in total."
"Response:  If Sylvi has been working for the company for five years and the annual salary increase is 10%, then her current salary would be:

Salary = 600 x (1 + 0.10)^5 = 600 x 1.10^5 = 930 $

If she continues to work for three more years, her salary will be:

Salary = 930 x (1 + 0.10)^3 = 930 x 1.10^3 = 1247.40 $

So, after three years, Sylvi's salary will be approximately $1247.40 per month."
Response:  We know that together they sold 88,000 copies of their albums. If Marylin sold 10 times more than Harald, then she sold 10 x 88,000 = 880,000 copies. So, Harald sold 88,000 - 880,000 = -792,000 copies.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many guests will attend the party since not all of them will come. Since 1/4 of the invited guests won't show up, we can subtract 1/4 of 16 (the number of invited guests) from 16. So, the total number of attending guests is:

16 - (1/4 x 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Now that we know the total number of attending guests, we can calculate the cost of the gift bags for each guest. The cost per gift bag is $2, so the total cost for 12 gift bags would be:

12 x $2 = $24

Therefore, Kristina will spend $24 on gift bags for her birthday party."
"Response:  We know that adult dinosaurs will eat 10 pounds of coleslaw each and baby dinosaurs will eat half as much as adults. So if there are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 baby dinosaurs, we can calculate how many pounds of coleslaw they will need in total.  
First, let's find out how much food the baby dinosaurs will need:  
5 x (1/2) = 5/2 = 2.5 pounds  
Now, let's add up all the food needed for both adults and babies:  
20 x 10 = 200 pounds + 2.5 pounds = 202.5 pounds  
So Ted needs to bring 202.5 pounds of coleslaw to the picnic to feed all the dinosaurs."
Response:  We know that Djen has three times as many pets as Marcia and two more than Cindy. So if Cindy has four pets, then Djen will have three times four = twelve pets. Therefore, there are a total of thirteen domestic animals among them - four from Cindy, twelve from Djen, and none from Marcia.
"Response:  We know that Emily has four children, and their names are Emmy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Emmy is five years older than Jackson, and two years younger than Corey. If James is ten years old and one year younger than Corey, we can start building our equation.

Let E be Emmy's age (since she's five years older than Jackson)
L = Corey's age (as Emmy is two years younger than Corey)
J = Jackson's age
and J + 2 = L (Emmy is two years younger than Corey)

Now, we know that James is ten years old and one year younger than Corey, so we can set up another equation:
J + 1 = L - 1 (James is one year younger than Corey)

We also know that Emmy is five years older than Jackson, so we can write:
E = J + 5

Now we have three equations and three unknowns (E, L, and J). Can you solve for them to find out how old Jackson is?"
Response:  We know that Li can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, and Gerald has improved his diet by 10%. This means that Gerald's speed has increased by 10% of 38 seconds, which is equal to 3.8 seconds (since 10% of 38 is 3.8). So, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 + 3.8 = 41.8 seconds.
"Response:  We know that there are x cats and 2x dogs in total. Since there are 12 times fewer rabbits than all domestic animals combined, we can write an equation based on this information:

Let X be the number of rabbits. Then we have:

X = (1/12) \* (2x + x) = (1/12) \* (3x) = 3x/12

Now we need to find out how many dogs and cats there are. We know that for every dog, there are two cats, so:

2x = 2(x) = 2x

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 60

So, there are 60 dogs and 120 cats in the residential area. And since each cat has 2 mice, there are in total:

60 dogs + 120 cats = 180 pets

Therefore, there are 180 domestic animals in the residential area."
"Response:  We know that there are 200 students in the fifth grade and 2/5 of them are boys. This means that there are 200 x (2/5) = 80 boys in the class. Now we need to find out how many girls are not in the scout association. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the scout association, we can use the following calculation: 

Number of girls who are not in the scout association = Total number of girls - Number of girls who are in the scout association 
= 200 x (1/3) = 66.67 (approximately 67)

Therefore, there are approximately 67 girls who do not belong to the scout association."
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night, and his friend James slept for 2/3 of the time that Harry did. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Harry slept for 9 hours = 9 x (1 hour) = 9 hours
James slept for 2/3 of 9 hours = 9 hours / 3 = 3 hours

Now we have our answer! Harry slept for 9 hours, while James slept for 3 hours. Therefore, Harry slept for 6 more hours than James."
"Response:  We know that each can of tomatoes weighs 16 ounces and contains three tomatoes. So if Frieda used three cans of tomatoes to make her sauce, she would have used a total of 48 ounces (3 x 16) of tomatoes. Since the final portion of the sauce weighed 32 ounces, Frieda must have lost half of the weight of the tomatoes when she cooked them. Therefore, the number of tomatoes Frieda used is:  

$$ \frac{48}{2} = 24 $$

So Frieda used 24 tomatoes to make her sauce."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 30 machines on the highway and 5 of them left the road without passing through the traffic jam. So, we have to find out how many machines passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. 
We are given that some machines passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, but we don't know exactly how many. Let's assume that x machines passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. 
Now, let's calculate how many machines passed through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes (since the total time was 30 minutes). We know that 20 machines passed through the traffic jam in these 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of machines that passed through the traffic jam is:
x + 20

Since 5 machines did not pass through the traffic jam, we need to subtract their number from the total number of machines that passed through the traffic jam:

x + 20 - 5

Simplifying the expression, we get:

x + 15

So, the answer is 15 machines passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"Response: 

Yesterday Mary received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery.
She already has 2 potted plants on each of her 40 windowsills at home.
Mary decided to give one potted plant to each of her friends and relatives tomorrow.

So, how many potted plants will Mary have left after giving them away?

Let X be the number of potted plants Mary has before giving any away.
X + 18 = 40 (since she already has 2 plants on each of her 40 windowsills)

Solving for X, we get:
X = 36

Therefore, Mary will have 36 potted plants left after giving one to each of her friends and relatives."
Response:  We know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door. The second friend pressed it in 1/4 of the time that the first friend did, so they pressed it 5 times (20 x 1/4 = 5). The third friend pressed it 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the fourth friend pressed it 60 - 10 = 50 times. In total, the doorbell rang 5 + 5 + 50 = 60 times.
"Response:  We know that Sol has already read 15 pages (on Monday). To find out how many pages he needs to read each day for the next four days, we need to subtract the number of pages he has already read from the total number of pages in each subject.

For example, let's start with the biology textbook:

Total pages in biology = 4 x 20 = 80 pages
Pages left to read in biology = 80 - 15 = 65 pages

To find out how many pages Sol needs to read each day for the next four days, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

65 pages / 4 days = 16 pages per day

Now let's do the same for the other subjects:

Social studies:

Total pages in social studies = 20 x 20 = 400 pages
Pages left to read in social studies = 400 - 15 = 385 pages

385 pages / 4 days = 96 pages per day

History:

Total pages in history = 7 x 20 = 140 pages
Pages left to read in history = 140 - 15 = 125 pages

125 pages / 4 days = 31 pages per day

Geography:

Total pages in geography = 8 x 20 = 160 pages
Pages left to read in geography = 160 - 15 = 145 pages

145 pages / 4 days = 36 pages per day

Therefore, Sol needs to read an average of 16 + 96 + 31 + 36 = 179 pages per day for the next four days to finish reading all the subjects."
Response:  We know that John drinks one glass of water before each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and one glass before bedtime, so he drinks a total of 3 glasses of water per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, John drinks a total of 3 x 7 = 21 glasses of water per week.
Response:  We know that the width of the city is 42 miles and the speed at which the fog moves is 3 miles per 10 minutes. So it will take 42/3 = 14 minutes for the fog to cover the entire city.
"Response:  Poppie has collected 1000 puzzle pieces and she puts a quarter of them (250) on the board. Then her mom adds another third (333) of the remaining pieces. So, in total, we have:

250 + 333 = 583

There are still 417 pieces left to be placed on the board."
"Response:  We know that Amir eats 5 pies and Kodi eats three times more than Amir. So if we let X be the number of pies that Kodi eats, then:

X = 3(5) = 3 x 5 = 15

So together, they eat 5 + 15 = 20 pies."
"Response:  We know that each box has dimensions of 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches (length x width x height). Since we are looking for the total internal volume of all three boxes, we need to find the volume of one box first and then multiply it by 3.

The formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism is V = length x width x height. In this case, the length, width, and height of each box are given as 5 inches, 6 inches, and 4 inches, respectively. So, the volume of one box can be calculated as follows:

V = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches

Now, since we have three boxes, we need to multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total internal volume of all three boxes:

Total Volume = 120 x 3 = 360 cubic inches

Therefore, the total internal volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic inches."
"Response:  We know that Frankie watched 1 hour of his favorite show on Monday and Tuesday, so he watched 2 hours in total (1 hour x 2 days). On Wednesday, he watched several 30-minute shows, but we don't know exactly how many. Let's assume he watched x 30-minute shows. Since each episode is 30 minutes long, he watched 30x minutes of television on Wednesday. Thursday was a busy day for Frankie, as he finished his homework early and watched 1 hour of his favorite show plus 30 minutes of another show. Friday was also busy, with two 1-hour episodes. So, in total, Frankie watched: 

Monday + Tuesday = 2 hours
Wednesday = 30x minutes
Thursday = 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
Friday = 2 hours
Total time watching TV = 2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 6.5 hours

Now, let's find out what value of x will make the equation true. We can set up an equation based on the information given:

6.5 = 2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2

Simplifying the equation:

6.5 = 2 + 30x + 3.5

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

4.5 = 30x + 3.5

Subtracting 3.5 from both sides:

4 = 30x

Dividing both sides by 30:

x = 4/30

x = 1/7

Therefore, Frankie watched 7 30-minute shows on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Henry prepared twice as much pastry this year as last year. If he had prepared x pieces of pastry last year, then this year he would have prepared 2x pieces. However, we are told that he actually made 15 more pieces than he intended to make. So, if he intended to make y pieces this year (where y = 2x), then he actually made y + 15 pieces. Finally, we are told that he dropped 5 pieces when taking them out of the oven, so the total number of pieces he has is 110. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

y + 15 = 110

Solving for y, we get:

y = 95

So, Henry prepared 95 pieces of pastry last year."
"Response:  If we buy 10 gallons of gasoline at $3 per gallon, it will cost us:

$3 x 10 = $30

Now, if we use the cashback offer and buy 10 gallons of gasoline, we will receive a cashback of:

$0.20 x 10 = $2

So, after receiving the cashback, the total cost of buying 10 gallons of gasoline will be:

$30 - $2 = $28

Therefore, if we buy 10 gallons of gasoline at $3 per gallon using the cashback offer, it will cost us $28."
"Response:  We know that Marcel has 14 small rolls and Beatrice has 24 large rolls. To find out how many rolls they would eat in total if they were to eat everything, we need to calculate the area of each roll.  
For Marcel's rolls, the area is 14 x 3 = 42 square rolls. For Beatrice's rolls, the area is 24 x 2 = 48 square rolls. In total, they would eat 42 + 48 = 90 square rolls.  
Now, let's divide this number by the average size of one roll (half the area): 90 / 2 = 45 rolls. So, on average, they would eat 45 rolls each if they ate everything."
"Response:  We know that Julia rowed back to shore at a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet. So if she traveled 20 feet in 16 seconds, how much water would have entered the boat during this time?

Let X be the number of liters of water that entered the boat. Since we know that 2 liters enter for every 10 feet traveled, we can set up the equation:

X = 2(20/10) = 2 \* 2 = 4 liters

Now, let's find out how many seconds it took Julia to cover the remaining distance to the shore. We know that there are 64 seconds left until she reaches the shore. If she covered 20 feet in 16 seconds, then:

Time left = 64 - 16 = 48 seconds

So, Julia has 48 seconds left to cover the remaining distance of 44 feet (64 - 20). At a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet, it will take her:

Time left / Rate = 48 / 2 = 24 seconds

To cover the remaining distance of 44 feet. Therefore, the total amount of water that entered the boat is:

Total water = 4 liters + (24 \* 2) = 4 liters + 48 = 52 liters

Therefore, the correct answer is 52 liters."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 teachers and each teacher uses the blackboard for 2 classes per day. If we assume that each class lasts for 1 hour (60 minutes), then each teacher will use the blackboard for 2 x 60 = 120 minutes per day. Since the board is cleaned 3 times during each class, the total number of times the board is cleaned in a day would be:  
120 minutes / day x 3 cleans per minute x 4 teachers = 720 cleans per day."
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers per day and there are already 5 days that have passed (since he started planting), then in total he has planted 2 x 5 = 10 flowers. Now, if 5 of them did not grow, then there will be 10 - 5 = 5 flowers left in the garden after 15 days.
Response:  We know that in Dzhmal's phone there can be 6 times more photos than in Brittany's phone. So if Brittany has 50 photos, then Dzhmal will have 50 x 6 = 300 photos. Now we are told that the maximum number of birds on one photo is 50. Therefore, the total number of birds on all photos taken by Dzhmal at the zoo is also 50 x 300 = 15,000 birds.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the lumber that Sasha has:  
10 boards x $10 each = $100  
5 boards x $16 each = $80  
Total cost = $180  
Now let's find out how much profit she will make if she sells everything:  
Profit = Total cost - Price at which she sold them  
Profit = $180 - (Price per board x Number of boards)  
Profit = $180 - ($10 x 10 + $16 x 5)  
Profit = $180 - $100 - $80  
Profit = $30  
Therefore, Sasha will make a profit of $30 if she sells all her lumber."
"Response:  We know that Katy uses 7 parts of sugar and 13 parts of water in her coffee. If she used 120 lozenges of sugar and cups of water altogether, we can calculate how many lozenges of sugar she used for each part. 
First, let's find out how many cups of water she used:
1 cup = 8 oz = 236 ml
So, 13 cups of water = 13 x 236 ml = 3048 ml
Now, let's find out how many lozenges of sugar she used:
120 lozenges =? cups
We know that 1 cup = 7 lozenges (since there are 7 parts of sugar to 13 parts of water)
So, 120 lozenges = 120 / 7 = 17 cups
Therefore, Katy used 17 cups of sugar to make her coffee!"
Response:  John has three children and he buys two pairs of shoes for each child. So, in total, he buys 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of shoes. And each pair costs $60, so he pays: 6 x $60 = $360.
Response:  We know that there were 2 containers with import transport vehicles in the main port of marine customs clearance on the first day, and each container contained 5 transport vehicles. So, in total, there were 2 x 5 = 10 transport vehicles imported on the first day. On the second day, we are told that there were 30 transport vehicles in the port, so we can calculate how many containers were imported on the second day as follows: Total number of transport vehicles in the port (second day) - Number of transport vehicles imported on the first day = Number of containers imported on the second day. 30 - 10 = 20 containers. Therefore, 20 containers were imported on the second day.
"Response:  We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lila's four years ago, so we can set up an equation based on this information.

Let A be Adrien's salary four years ago and L be Lila's salary at the same time. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lila's, we have:

A = L x 1.3

We also know that both salaries increased simultaneously over the past four years, so we can write:

A + L = (A + L) x 1.4 (since both salaries increased by 40%)

Now we need to find out how much Adrien and Lila earned in total after four years. To do this, we add their individual salaries:

A + L = A + L x 1.4

Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:

(L x 1.3) + L = (L x 1.3) + L x 1.4

Simplifying, we obtain:

2L + L = 3L + L

Solving for L, we get:

3L = 5L

L = 2

So Lila earned $2 four years ago. Now let's find out how much Adrien earned:

Adrien's salary four years ago was:

A = L x 1.3
= 2 x 1.3
= 2.6

Since Adrien's salary increased by 40%, his current salary is:

A = A x 1.4
= 2.6 x 1.4
= 3.68

Therefore, Adrien currently earns $3,680 more than he did four years ago.

To find out how much they earned in total, we add their current salaries:

A + L = 3.68 + 2
= 5.68

So together, Adrien and Lila earned $5,680 after four years."
"Response:  We know that Miguel uses two blocknotes in a week for drawing, and each blocknote has 30 sheets of paper. To find out how many sheets of paper he uses per month, we need to multiply the number of blocknotes he uses per week by the number of sheets in each blocknote. So, if Miguel uses 2 blocknotes per week, and each blocknote has 30 sheets of paper, then he uses:

2 x 30 = 60 sheets of paper per week

To convert this to months, we can divide the total number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month (4). So, if there are 4 weeks in a month, then:

60 sheets / 4 weeks = 15 sheets per month

Therefore, Miguel uses 15 sheets of paper per month for his drawings."
Response:  We know that Morizett brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she had a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kail brought twice as many apples as Morizett, so he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought fewer oranges than Morizett, so he brought 2 x 8 = 16 - 2 = 14 oranges (since 16 is the double of 8). In total, Kail brought 10 + 14 = 24 fruits. Therefore, together they have 13 + 24 = 37 fruits.
"Response:  We know that Seidi slept for 8 hours on Monday and then for 6 hours (2 hours less than on Monday) on each of the next two days. So she slept for a total of:

8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours

Now we are told that at the end of the week, Seidi slept for one hour more than she did in these two days. This means she slept for an additional:

1 hour

So her total sleep for the week is:

20 + 1 = 21 hours

Therefore, Seidi slept for 21 hours during the week."
"Response:  We know that Rosie can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers a distance of:

10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

After that, she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for 4 hours (since there are 7 hours in total), so she covers an additional distance of:

5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can cover in 7 hours is:

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles"
"Response:  We know that Djenny has a stack of 60 letters and she has already pasted stamps on one-third of them. If there are now 30 letters with stamps in the other pile, then we can calculate how many letters were initially in this pile.

Let X be the initial number of letters in the pile with no stamps. Since Djenny has pasted stamps on one-third of the letters, the number of letters without stamps is:

X = 60 / 3 = 20

So, there were originally 20 letters in the pile with no stamps."
Response:  We know that Djuilia bought a new package of plastic spoons and her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to her. So, in total, Julia has 8 new spoons (3 she used for tasting + 5 from her husband). She served 12 people at the dinner table, so each person got 1 spoon. Therefore, the number of spoons in Julia's original package is 12.
"Response:  We know that Di lan bought more fish sticks than chicken sticks. So if he bought x chicken sticks, he must have bought at least x + 6 fish sticks. Since there are 38 chicken sticks in total, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 6) = 38...

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 6 = 38...

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

2x = 32...

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 16...

So Di lan bought 16 chicken sticks and at least 16 + 6 = 22 fish sticks. In total, he bought 48 socks (16 chicken sticks + 22 fish sticks)."
"Response:  If Emily gained 20 more friends than Lily after switching schools, and Lily had 50 friends beforehand, then we can set up an equation to represent this information.
Let L be the number of friends Lily had before switching schools (i.e., her initial amount).
Emily gained 20 more friends than Lily, so Emily's total number of friends is:
E = L + 20...(1)
We know that Emi has 50 friends now, so we can substitute E for 50 in equation (1):
50 = L + 20...(2)
Now solve for L using equation (2):
L = 30...(3)
So Lily had 30 friends before switching schools. Therefore, together they have:
L + E = 30 + 50 = 80 friends."
"Response:  We know that the cost of each arbuz is three times the cost of each pepper. So if one pepper costs $15, then one arbuz will cost $15 x 3 = $45. Since Dillon needs to buy 4 arbuzes, he will spend $45 x 4 = $180 on arbuzes.  
We also know that the cost of each apeel sin is five times less than the cost of each arbuz. So if one arbuz costs $45, then one apeel sin will cost $45 / 5 = $9. Since Dillon needs to buy 10 apeel sins, he will spend $9 x 10 = $90 on apeel sins.  
Therefore, in total, Dillon will spend $180 + $90 = $270 on all the vegetables."
"Response:  We know that there are 500 patients per day and each patient stays for an average of 24 minutes. So, in one hour (60 minutes), the hospital can receive 500/24 = 20 patients.
Now we need to calculate how much money the hospital earns from these visits. The doctors take $150 per hour, so the hospital earns $20 x $150 = $3,000 per hour.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total daily profit is $3,000 x 24 = $72,000."
Response:  We have 60 elves in total and we need to subtract two groups of elves who will leave their jobs. Firstly, third of the elves (20) will be fired after children rip them apart. So, we have 60 - 20 = 40 elves left. Then, another 10 elves (out of 40) will be fired after children pinch them on their feet. Therefore, we have 40 - 10 = 30 elves remaining. Finally, there are 30 elves left working as santas' helpers in the village.
"Response:  We know that in May, Joseph spent $500 and in June, he spent $60 less than in May. So, in June, he spent $500 - $60 = $440. Therefore, Joseph's total expenses for both months are:
$500 + $440 = $940."
Response:  First, Pem and Fred rode the roller coaster twice each, so they spent 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for the roller coaster rides. Then, they went sledding together twice, which cost another 2 x 6 = 12 tickets. In total, they spent 12 + 12 = 24 tickets for all attractions.
"Response:  We know that Walts ran 4 miles on Monday and 6 times more than that on Tuesday. So, he ran 4 x 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday. In total, he ran 4 + 24 = 28 miles from Monday to Wednesday. Since he ran 41 miles in total, we can set up an equation:  
4 + 28 = 41 
Solving for the variable ""4"", we get:  
4 + 28 = 41  
32 = 41  
9 = 41 - 32  
9 = 9  
Therefore, Walt ran 9 miles on Wednesday (since he ran 41 miles in total)."
Response:  We know that Tom washes his car 4 times a month, and each wash costs $15. So, in one month, he spends $15 x 4 = $60 on car washes. In a year, he spends $60 x 12 = $720 on car washes.
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 video games and lost 5 of them before the comparison was made. So, he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. If Bobby has fewer than 15 x 3 = 45 video games, then he must have at most 44 video games. Therefore, the number of video games Bobby has is 44.
"Response:  We know that two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. So if we have x female unicorns in Scotland, then we have (3x/2) male unicorns. Since there are 27 unicorns in total, we can set up the following equation:

x + (3x/2) = 27

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4x/2 = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 18

So there are 18 female unicorns in Scotland."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the order without delivery:  
2 x sandwiches = 2 x 7.50$ = 15$  
2 x bags of chips = 2 x 1.50$ = 3$  
2 x pies = 2 x 1.00$ = 2$  
Total cost = 15 + 3 + 2 = 20$  
Now let's add the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost:  
Delivery fee = 20% x 20$ = 4$  
So the final price of the order with delivery will be:  
Final price = Total cost + Delivery fee = 20$ + 4$ = 24$"
Response:  We know that Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and he finished it with 75 questions in this time frame. This means that his speed was 75/8 = 9 questions per hour. Now we are given that he spent 6 hours completing the second test, which consists of 100 questions. So, we can calculate how many questions he completed as follows: 100 / 6 = 16.67 questions per hour (since we cannot have a fraction of a question, let's round up to 17). Therefore, Mark left 100 - 17 = 83 questions without an answer.
"Response:  We know that there are 22 more pink sharks than blue sharks multiplied by four. So if we let X be the number of blue sharks, then the number of pink sharks is X + 22. Now we know that the total number of sharks is equal to the number of blue sharks multiplied by four plus the number of pink sharks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
4X + (X + 22) =?
Combine like terms:
4X + X + 22 =?
5X + 22 =?
Now solve for X:
5X = 22
X = 4
So there are 4 blue sharks and 4 + 22 = 26 pink sharks."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 machines available for rent, and we want to find out how many of them have semi-automatic transmissions. So, first, let's count how many machines have automatic transmissions:

12 machines have automatic transmissions (we know this from the information given).

Now, let's count how many machines have manual transmissions:

4 machines have manual transmissions (again, we know this from the information given).

So, now we can calculate how many machines have semi-automatic transmissions:

20 - 12 (automatics) - 4 (manuals) = 4

Therefore, 4 machines (or 20%) have semi-automatic transmissions."
"Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in the hive and we want to find out how many worker bees there are. So let's start with what we do know:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as brood (cups). This means if there are x cups of brood, then there are 2x worker bees.
2. The number of cups of brood is equal to the number of queens times two. This means if there are y queens, then there are 2y cups of brood.
3. We know that there are z workers. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

z = 2(2y)

Now solve for z:

z = 2(2y)
= 4y

So there are 4y worker bees in the hive."
"Response:  We know that Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day and works for 4 hours at his part-time job. So, in one week (7 days), he has:

* 2 hours/day x 7 days = 14 hours of gaming time
* 4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours of work time

Now, let's calculate how much money Jordan could have earned from his part-time job in one week:

* 28 hours x $10/hour = $280

So, in one week, Jordan could have earned $280 from his part-time job."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much John spent on food items (milk, eggs, and lamps). Then, we can add the cost of non-food item (trap for tarantulas) and finally, we will multiply everything by 1.1 (to account for the tax rate of 10%).

Milk: $2 x 1 = $2
Eggs: $3 x 1 = $3
Lamps: $3 x 1 = $3
Trap for tarantulas: $4 x 1 = $4
Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $12
Total cost including tax: $12 x 1.1 = $13.20"
"Response:  We know that Lucas has three clients who will pay for his services, and he is negotiating with five potential clients. So, let's start by calculating the total income from his current clients:

3 clients x $2 (price of one bottle of cleaning solution) = $6
+ 3 clients x $5 (price of one pack of saloflets) = $15
Total income from current clients = $6 + $15 = $21

Now, let's calculate the total income from potential clients. If he manages to sign all five potential clients, the total income would be:

5 clients x $2 (price of one bottle of cleaning solution) = $10
+ 5 clients x $5 (price of one pack of saloflets) = $25
Total income from potential clients = $10 + $25 = $35

So, the total weekly income for Lucas would be:

Total income from current clients = $21
+ Total income from potential clients = $35
Total weekly income = $21 + $35 = $56

Therefore, Lucas can expect to earn $56 per week in profit."
"Response:  We know that John has a field of 10 hectares (ha) with 100 ananas per hectare. To find out how many ananas he can harvest in one year, we need to multiply the number of hectares by the number of ananas per hectare and then divide by the time it takes for him to harvest them.

So, the calculation is as follows:

10 ha x 100 ananas/ha = 1,000 ananas/ha

Since John can harvest every 3 months, he will have 4 harvests in a year (assuming each harvest takes 3 months). Therefore, the total number of ananas he can harvest in a year is:

1,000 ananas/ha x 4 harvests/year = 4,000 ananas/year

Therefore, John can expect to harvest 4,000 ananas per year from his 10-hectare field."
"Response:  We know that Johnny has three sets of Lego blocks:

Set A: 500 pieces
Set B: 3 times more than Set A = 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces
Set C: 1/4 of Set A = 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces

So in total, Johnny will have:

500 + 1500 + 125 = 2225 pieces of Lego."
"Response:  We know that in the first 6 hours, 30 pbees flew out of the hive and then returned over the next 6 hours. So, there were 30 bees outside for 6 hours. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees flew out (i.e., 60) and did not return. Therefore, the total number of bees outside at any given time was 30 + 60 = 90. Since each bee spent 6 hours outside, we can calculate how many bees returned during the last 6 hours of the day:  
90 x 6 = 540 bees returned during the last 6 hours."
Response:  We know that the cost of admission for adults is $12 and for children is $10. If Brittany's mom paid $8 in cash, she must have received $4 in change ($12 - $8 = $4). So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave to the cashier was $4.
"Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends, then Charlie has 3x friends. 
We also know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends, then James has 4x friends. 
If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Let C = number of friends Charlie has on Facebook (since ""C"" is the first letter of his name) 
Let D = number of friends Dorothy has on Facebook 
Let J = number of friends James has on Facebook 
Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write: 
C = 3D 
We also know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can write: 
J = 4D 
Now we have two equations and one unknown variable (D). Can you use these equations to find out how many friends James has on Facebook?"
"Response:  We know that STEV has to travel 3 miles and TIM has to travel 2 miles. So we can start by finding out how long it will take each of them to complete their journey.  
For STEV, we know that he is traveling at a speed of 440 feet per minute (fpm) on his bicycle. To find out how long it will take him to travel 3 miles, we can divide the distance by his speed:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = 3 miles / 440 fpm  
Time = 3 x 100 / 440  
Time = 75 minutes  
So STEV will take 75 minutes to travel 3 miles.  
Now let's find out how long it will take TIM to travel 2 miles. We know that he is traveling at a speed of 264 feet per minute (fpm) on his skateboard. To find out how long it will take him to travel 2 miles, we can divide the distance by his speed:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = 2 miles / 264 fpm  
Time = 2 x 100 / 264  
Time = 50 minutes  
So TIM will take 50 minutes to travel 2 miles.  
Now that we have found out how long each of them will take to complete their journey, we need to find out when TIM will catch up with STEV. We know that STEV starts first, so TIM will start after him. We can use subtraction to find out how much time TIM needs to catch up with STEV:  
Time for TIM to catch up = Time for STEV - Time for TIM  
Time for TIM to catch up = 75 minutes - 50 minutes  
Time for TIM to catch up = 25 minutes  
So TIM will catch up with STEV in 25 minutes. Therefore, the winner will wait for 25 minutes at home before completing the race."
"Response:  We have 5 people who came to fill both tires of their bicycles, so they paid $0.25 x 2 = $0.50 per person. That's a total of $5.00.  
We also had 3 people who came to fill all four tires of their tricycles, so they paid $0.25 x 4 = $1.00 per person. That's a total of $3.00.  
Finally, one person came with a monocycle and paid $0.25 for each of the two tires, for a total of $0.50. So the grand total is $5.00 + $3.00 + $0.50 = $8.50."
"Response:  If Karl buys ten packs of pastries and each pack contains six pastries, then he will buy in total:  
10 x 6 = 60 pastries. 
The cost of all pastries is:  
60 x 0.10 = 6 dollars. 
So Carl will receive $4 as change ($10 - $6)."
Response:  We know that Dave bought a large bag of potato chips and ate 14 of them before a hungry seagull stole the bag from his hand. The seagull took half of what Dave had eaten (7), leaving him with 7. Then three doves came and each ate three pieces, so there were 3 x 3 = 9 left. An otter then took two thirds of what was left (6), leaving only one piece. Finally, ants carried away the last piece, so there were no more potato chips in the bag when Dave bought it. Therefore, the number of potato chips in the bag when Dave bought it was 14 + 7 + 9 + 6 = 36.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 weeks in one month and 3 months in one semester. So, we have:

4 weeks/month x 3 months/semester = 12 weeks/semester

Now, let's count how many hours Kim spends on classes per week:

1 hour/class x 3 classes/week = 3 hours/week

Since there are 12 weeks in one semester, we can calculate the total number of hours Kim spends on classes for one semester as follows:

3 hours/week x 12 weeks/semester = 36 hours/semester

So, Kim spends 36 hours on classes for one semester."
"Response:  We know that we have three types of baked goods: rolls (300), chocolate croissants (120), and bread (60). We also know their lengths in inches or feet. So let's convert all the measurements to feet first:

Rolls: 300 x 4 = 1200 inches = 10 feet
Chocolate Croissants: 120 x 6 = 720 inches = 60 feet
Bread: 60 x 2 = 120 inches = 10 feet

Now, we need to add up all these lengths to find the total length of all the baked goods.

Total length = 10 + 60 + 10 = 80 feet

So, if Bill lays out all his baked goods end to end, they will be 80 feet long!"
"Response:  We know that the zookeeper needs to order bananas for each species of monkeys every two months. The number of bananas needed is as follows:

* Marmosets need 200 bananas per month, so they need 400 bananas for two months (2 x 200 = 400).
* Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so they need 800 bananas for two months (2 x 400 = 800).
* Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so they need 200 bananas for two months (2 x 100 = 200).

Therefore, the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for two months is:

400 + 800 + 200 = 1400

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas for two months."
Response:  We know that BLAKE runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers a distance of 100 yards x 15 = 1500 yards. KELLY runs to the end line and back once, which is 100 yards, then decides not to run near BLAKE and starts running to the 40-yard mark and back, for a total of 34 runs. Each run is 40 yards, so her total distance is 40 yards x 34 = 1360 yards. Since BLAKE ran more than KELLY (1500 - 1360 = 140), BLAKE wins.
"Response:  We know that Rafaél bought four pens for $1.5 each, so he spent:

4 x $1.5 = $6

He also bought two notebooks for $4 each, so he spent:

2 x $4 = $8

Finally, he bought a pack of thick paper for $20. So in total, Rafaél spent:

$6 + $8 + $20 = $34"
Response:  Firstly, we know that initially there were 11 headlights in the pond. Then, 6 of them left their hiding place under the leaf cup. So now there are 5 headlights left in the hiding place. Next, 2 of them hid under the rock. Therefore, there are 3 headlights visible to Finn in the pond now.
"Response:  We know that in Tuesday, the water level increased by 7 feet, so the new depth is:

Depth = Original Depth + Increase
= 17 ft + 7 ft
= 24 ft

Now we are told that on Wednesday, the water level decreased to two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

New Depth = Two-Thirds x Old Depth
= Two-Thirds x 24 ft
= 16 ft

Therefore, the depth of water in the reservoir on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Response:  We know that Enakin caught 10 marine stars, 6 marine colts, and 3 fish clowns. Loxin caught fewer marine stars than Ena kin by 5, fewer marine colts than Ena kin by 3, and more fish clowns than Ena Kin by 2. So let's start with the number of marine stars that Loxin caught:

Loxin caught 5 fewer marine stars than Ena kin, so he caught:

10 - 5 = 5 marine stars

Now, let's move on to the number of marine colts that Loxin caught:

Loxin caught 3 fewer marine colts than Ena kin, so he caught:

6 - 3 = 3 marine colts

Finally, let's calculate the number of fish clowns that Loxin caught:

Loxin caught 2 more fish clowns than Ena kin, so he caught:

3 + 2 = 5 fish clowns

Therefore, in total, Loxin caught 5 marine stars, 3 marine colts, and 5 fish clowns."
"Response:  We know that the price of the bag of flour will increase by 20% every two months. So if we start with a price of $20, after one month, the price will be:

$20 x 1.2 (100% + 20%) = $24

After two months, the price will be:

$24 x 1.2 (100% + 20%) = $28.80

And so on. After three years (36 months), the price of the bag of flour will be:

$28.80 x 1.2 (100% + 20%) = $35.79

So, the bag of flour will cost $35.79 after 36 months, assuming a 20% increase in price every two months starting from $20."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red machines and 3 figurines in total. The price of each figurine is $5, so they cost $5 x 3 = $15 altogether. Now we need to find out how much all the other items cost. There are 5 red machines, and each one costs $4, so their total cost is $4 x 5 = $20. Therefore, the total cost of all the items is $15 + $20 = $35.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jackie will earn if she works independently and then compare it with the cost of hiring an accountant.  
1. Calculate Jackie's hourly rate for freelance work:  
Hourly rate = Total hours worked - Time spent on taxes  
Total hours worked = 40 hours/week x 52 weeks/year = 2,080 hours/year  
Time spent on taxes = 3 hours/week x 52 weeks/year = 156 hours/year  
Hourly rate = (2,080 - 156) / 2,080 = 0.875 or 87.5%  
2. Calculate Jackie's earnings without an accountant:  
Earnings = Hourly rate x Total hours worked  
= 0.875 x 2,080 = $1,795 per year  
3. Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant:  
Cost = 90$/hour x Number of hours spent on taxes  
= 90$/hour x 156 hours = $14,000 per year  
Now, let's subtract the cost from Jackie's earnings:  
Earnings - Cost = $1,795 - $14,000 = -$12,205  
So, if Jackie chooses to handle her taxes independently, she would lose $12,205 per year.  
However, if she decides to hire an accountant, she won't have to spend time on tax preparation and can use that time to generate more income. Therefore, the additional amount she could earn is:  
Additional earnings = Total hours worked x Hourly rate  
= 2,080 hours x $35/hour = $71,800 per year  
Therefore, by hiring an accountant, Jackie can potentially earn an additional $71,800 per year."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Elvira spent in total for all the computer accessories and printer. So, we add up the prices of each item:

1090 € (computer) + 157 € (scanner) + 74 € (CD drive) + 102 € (printer) = 1323 €

Now, let's subtract the amount she spent from her initial sum of money:

1500 € - 1323 € = 177 €

Therefore, Elvira has 177 € left for buying clothes."
Response:  We know that Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan and her neighbor gives her a basket with 9 eggs each time she sits with his daughter. To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra will need 3 x 15 = 45 eggs in total. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs at a time, she will need to sit with his daughter 45 / 9 = 5 times to collect all the eggs she needs.
"Response:  We know that Brook is 2 years younger than Seth, so we can write an equation based on their ages:
Seth's age = 2x + 2 (where x is Brook's age)
Brook's age = 2x (since she is 2 years younger than Seth)
We also know that their sum of ages will be equal to 28 in 2 years:
2x + 2 + Brook's age = 28
Combine like terms:
2x + 2 + 2x = 28
4x + 2 = 28
Solve for x:
4x = 26
x = 6
Now we can find Seth and Brook's ages:
Seth's age = 2x + 2 = 2(6) + 2 = 14
Brook's age = 2x = 2(6) = 12"
Response:  We know that Jimmy has 2 dollars more than Etel multiplied by 2. So if Etel has x dollars, then Jimmy has x + 2 dollars. If Etel has 8 dollars, then Jimmy has 8 + 2 = 10 dollars.
"Response:  We know that Pancho walks 20 miles per day except for weekends when he only walks 10 miles. So, if we calculate the total distance he covers in a week, we can find out how many miles he covers in a week.

Total distance covered by Pancho in a week = Number of days he walks x Distance walked per day
= 7 (days) x 20 (miles/day) + 2 (days) x 10 (miles/day)
= 140 miles + 20 miles
= 160 miles

Therefore, Pancho covers 160 miles in a week."
"Response:  We know that the total cost of one uniform is equal to the cost of the hat + the cost of the jacket + the cost of the pants. So we can write an equation:

Total Cost = Hat Cost + Jacket Cost + Pants Cost

We also know that the cost of each item is as follows:

Hat Cost = $25
Jacket Cost = 3 x Hat Cost = $75
Pants Cost = $25 (the same as the hat)

Now let's substitute these values into our equation:

Total Cost = $25 + $75 + $25
Total Cost = $125

So, one complete uniform costs $125."
"Response:  We know that there are 80 paulks with 8 legs each, so we can calculate how many legs they have in total as follows:

80 x 8 = 640 legs

There are also 90 insects with 6 legs each, so we can calculate their total number of legs as follows:

90 x 6 = 540 legs

Finally, there are 3 rare mutants with 10 legs each, so we can calculate their total number of legs as follows:

3 x 10 = 30 legs

Now let's add up all these numbers to find out how many legs in total do we see in the entomological museum:

640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

So, in total, we see 1210 legs in the entomological museum."
"Response:  We know that:
Sally Four is 8 years old (given)
Sally Three is 3 years older than Sally Four (given)
Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Three (given)
So, Granny Red is 2 x 3 = 6 years older than Sally Three
Therefore, Granny Red is 6 + 8 = 14 years old
Now we can calculate the ages of all four birds:
Sally Four - 8 years old
Sally Three - 3 years older than Sally Four + 8 = 11 years old
Granny Red - 14 years old
Sally Two - 3 years younger than Sally Four + 8 = 5 years old
So, the ages of the four birds are:
Sally Four - 8 years old
Sally Three - 11 years old
Granny Red - 14 years old
Sally Two - 5 years old"
"Response:  We know that Jessica has three debts with different minimum monthly payments:  
1. Credit card: $200/month  
2. Student loan: $300/month  
3. Mortgage: $500/month  
If she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum for each debt, we can calculate her total monthly payment as follows:  
1. Credit card: $200 x 1.5 = $300  
2. Student loan: $300 x 1.5 = $450  
3. Mortgage: $500 x 1.5 = $750  
Total monthly payment: $300 + $450 + $750 = $1,400 per month.  
To find out how much Jessica will pay in a year, we can multiply her total monthly payment by 12 months:  
$1,400 x 12 = $16,800 per year."
Response:  We know that Billy needs to clean and cut 60 carrots for the big family barbecue. Cleaning each carrot takes him about half a minute (30 seconds), so he will spend 60 x 0.5 = 30 minutes just cleaning the carrots. Now, cutting each carrot takes only 5 seconds, so he will spend 60 x 0.05 = 3 minutes cutting all the carrots. In total, Billy will need 30 + 3 = 33 minutes to prepare the carrots for the barbecue.
"Response:  We know that they sold 20 stakans per gallon and each stakan costs $0.50. So, total revenue from one gallon is:

20 x $0.50 = $10

They received $25 in profit, so their total revenue must be:

$10 + $25 = $35

Now we need to find out how much they spent on lemons and sugar. They spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar for one gallon, so:

Total cost = $3 + $2 = $5

So, they spent $5 on ingredients for one gallon. Since they sold three gallons, they spent in total:

$5 x 3 = $15

Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $15 on lemons and sugar."
"Response:  We know that there were 240 participants in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, we can start by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants to find out how many participants were not Japanese:

240 - 80 = 160

Now, we are told that all but 60 of the non-Japanese participants were Chinese. This means that there were 160 - 60 = 100 Chinese participants. Since there were 60 boys among the Chinese participants, we can deduce that there were 100 - 60 = 40 girls among the Chinese participants.

Therefore, the answer is 40."
Response:  We know that Zayid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 600 $ (1/4 x 6000). He also spends 1/3 of his salary on fuel for his car, which is 2000 $ (1/3 x 6000). So far, he has spent 2600 $ (600 + 2000) out of his monthly salary. Next, we know that he gives his daughter 200 $ per week, so in one month, he gives her 800 $ (200 x 4 weeks). And finally, he donates half of what remains to a charity organization, which is 3400 $ (6000 - 2600 - 800). Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zayed will have 3400 $ left.
"Response:  We know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Ran, and Bo has 40 crabs. So, we can start by finding out how many crabs Ran has:
Ran has 10 more crabs than Monic, so if Monic has x crabs, Ran has x + 10 crabs.
We also know that Bo has 40 crabs, so together they have:
x + (x + 10) + 40 =?
Combine like terms:
2x + 10 + 40 =?
Add 10 to both sides:
2x + 50 =?
Subtract 50 from both sides:
2x =?
Divide both sides by 2:
x =?
So, Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Ran, which means Ran has 4 more crabs than Monic:
Ran has 14 crabs (since Monic has 4 crabs).
Bo has 40 crabs.
Together, they have:
14 + 40 = 54
Therefore, there are 54 crabs in total among the three of them."
"Response:  We know that Lloyd earns $10 per hour and he worked for x hours in total. In the first week, he worked for 5 hours, so we can write:

5 hours x $10/hour = $50

In the second week, he worked for 8 hours, so we can write:

8 hours x $10/hour = $80

Total amount earned in two weeks:

$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 in his first two weeks of tutoring."
"Response:  We know that the number of votes for the winning candidate is 3/4 of the total number of voters, which is 80 students. So we can write an equation:  
3/4 x 80 =? 
Now we need to solve this equation. To do so, we divide both sides by 4:  
? = 3 x 80 / 4 
? = 240 / 4 
? = 60 
So the winning candidate received 60 votes. Now let's find out how many votes the losing candidate received. We know that the remaining votes (i.e., those not won by the winning candidate) are equal to the total number of voters minus the number of votes won by the winning candidate:  
Remaining votes = Total voters - Winning votes 
= 80 - 60 
= 20 
Therefore, the losing candidate received 20 votes."
Response:  We know that Sandra ordered 4 times more red roses than white lilies (4x = 4). The number of red roses she ordered is 4 times 200 = 800. So, Fred needs to deliver 800 - 200 = 600 red roses to Sandra by 5 pm to avoid losing her business.
"Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than Jan. So, if Jan is x years old now, Mark was (x + 5) years old two years ago. Now we are given that Yan is 30 years old and Djan is 2 years younger than Mark. Therefore, Djan is (x + 5) - 2 years old. Since Djan is 2 years younger than Mark, we can set up an equation as follows:

Djan = Mark - 2

Now we have two equations:

1. Djan = (x + 5) - 2...(1)
2. Yan = 30...(2)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find out Djan's age. First, let's substitute equation (2) into equation (1):

Djan = (x + 5) - 2
= 30 - 2
= 28

So, Djan is 28 years old. Finally, we can find out Jan's age by subtracting 2 from Djan's age:

Jan = Djan - 2
= 28 - 2
= 26

Therefore, Jan is 26 years old."
Response:  We know that each member of the better prepared team runs their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So if we assume that all four members run at the same speed, they will complete their respective laps in 55 seconds x 4 = 220 seconds (or 3 minutes and 40 seconds). Now let's look at the other team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds to cover his 400 meters, but each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the second runner will take 57 seconds (60 - 3), the third runner will take 54 seconds (57 - 3), and the fourth runner will take 51 seconds (54 - 3) to cover their respective laps. Since there are four runners in each team, the total time for the better prepared team will be 220 seconds, while the total time for the less well-prepared team will be: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 228 seconds. Therefore, the more prepared team will win by 228 - 220 = 8 seconds.
"Response:  If Jerry throws a six-sided die, then there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We need to find out how many of these outcomes have two consecutive even numbers.

To do this, we can look at each outcome one by one:

1. 1 is not an even number, so it cannot be followed by another even number.
2. 2 is an even number, but it cannot be followed by another even number since all the other even numbers (4, 6) come after it.
3. 3 is an odd number, so it cannot be followed by another even number.
4. 4 is an even number, and it can be followed by another even number (6). However, there is only one way for this to happen (4-6), and that is with the outcome 4-6.
5. 5 is an odd number, so it cannot be followed by another even number.
6. 6 is an even number, and it can be followed by another even number (4). There are two ways for this to happen (4-6 and 6-4).

Now, let's calculate the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers:

Probability of getting two consecutive even numbers = Number of outcomes where two consecutive even numbers appear / Total number of outcomes
= (4-6 + 6-4) / 6
= (2/6) x (2/6)
= 0.33 x 0.33
= 0.11 or 11%

Therefore, the probability of Jerry getting two consecutive even numbers when he throws a six-sided die is approximately 11%.

So, to answer your question, the probability of Jerry getting a number greater than 3 is higher than the probability of him getting two consecutive even numbers. The exact percentage difference between these probabilities would depend on the specific values of the numbers that Jerry gets."
Response:  We know that Djenna collected half as many apples as her mother. So if her mother collected 20 apples, then Djenna collected 20/2 = 10 apples. Therefore, together they collected 20 + 10 = 30 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 10 klets with hamsters and each hamster gets 5 brittles of soloma, so the total number of brittles for hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50. There are also 3 cages with rats, and each rat gets 6 brittles of soloma, so the total number of brittles for rats is 3 x 6 = 18. In addition, there are 20 brittles of soloma for rabbits. Therefore, the total number of brittles of soloma distributed among all small rodents is 50 + 18 + 20 = 98. Since 160 brittles of soloma were distributed among all small rodents, we can divide 98 by 160 to find out how many brittles each kryse has: 98 / 160 = 6/10 or 3/5. So, each kryse has 3/5 or 60% of the total number of brittles of soloma. To find out how many kryse are in each cage, we need to multiply the total number of brittles of soloma per cage by the percentage of brittles that belong to kryse: 60% x 30 (the number of brittles in one cage) = 18. Therefore, there are 18 kryse in each cage.
"Response:  We know that Mandy owes Benedict $100 and they agreed to pay an interest rate of 2% per month. So, if Mandy pays back the full amount in 3 months, she will owe Benedict:  
$100 x (1 + 0.02)^3 = $100 x 1.06 = $106  
So, Mandy needs to pay Benedict $106 to settle her debt."
"Response:  We know that the trader bought several bags of wheat from the farmer at a price of $20 per bag. The transportation cost for each bag is $2. If the trader received a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a price of $30 each, we can calculate how many bags he sold as follows:

1. First, let's find out how much the trader paid in total for the bags:
$20 x number of bags = $20n (where n is the number of bags)
2. Next, let's find out how much the trader sold the bags for:
$30 x number of bags = $30n
3. Now we can set up an equation based on the information given:
$20n + $2n = $400

Solving this equation, we get:

$20n + $2n = $400
$22n = $400
n = 18

So the trader sold 18 bags of wheat."
"Response:  We know that they spent $20.25 on three tickets to the fair and $4.50 less on food than on tickets. So, we can start by calculating how much they spent on food:  
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 (food)
We also know that they spent $33 each on two different attractions, so let's add that up:  
$33 + $33 = $66 (attractions)
Now, we need to find out how much each person paid for their ticket and their share of the food and attraction costs. Since they agreed to split everything equally among themselves, we can use division to solve this problem:  
Total cost / Number of people = Share per person
Let's start with the total cost:  
$20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102
Now, let's divide the total cost by the number of people:  
$102 / 3 = $34
So, each friend paid $34 for their ticket, $15.75 for their share of the food, and $22 for their share of the attraction costs ($33 x 2). Therefore, the final amount each friend paid is:  
$34 + $15.75 + $22 = $72"
"Response:  We know that John collects persimmons for 3 hours, and he can collect 2 persimmons per minute. So we need to calculate how many minutes he spent collecting persimmons.  
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now we know that John collected persimmons for 180 minutes. Since he can collect 2 persimmons per minute, we can calculate how many persimmons he collected as follows:

180 minutes x 2 persimmons/minute = 360 persimmons

So John collected 360 persimmons during his 3-hour session."
Response:  If one duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, then it will need to eat approximately 0.5 pounds (or 226 grams) of insects per day. Since there are ten ducks in the flock, they will need to eat a total of 10 x 0.5 = 5 pounds (or 2268 grams) of insects per day.
"Response:  We know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees per year. So, after 10 years, he will have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees and cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, he will have 100 - 20 = 80 trees left.

Now, we are told that 30% of the trees die. This means that 30% of 80 is 24 trees (since 30% of 80 is 24). So, after 10 years, Tom will have 80 - 24 = 56 trees left."
Response:  We know that initially there were 18 rosy plastic flamingos before Sue's house. Then, in the morning of Saturday, her neighbors painted and replaced one-third of them with white ones. So, if we divide 18 by 3, we get 6. It means that 6 rosy flamingos were replaced with white ones. Now, let's add the new 18 rosy flamingos that appeared on Sunday morning. If we add 6 (remaining rosy flamingos from Saturday) to 18 (new rosy flamingos), we get 24. Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 pink plastic flamingos standing before Sue's house.
"Response:  We know that Violetta needs 5 different colored crayons and she has $20 to spend. One crayon costs $2, so we can calculate how many crayons she can buy with her money:

$20 / $2 = 10

Violetta can buy 10 crayons. Since she needs 5 different colors, she will receive 5 x 10 = 50 crayons in total."
"Response:  We know that the price of one pencil is $1.20 and the price of one rubber band is $0.30. So if we buy 8 pencils and 8 rubber bands together, how much will it cost in total?

To find out, let's calculate the cost of each item separately:

8 pencils x $1.20 per pencil = $9.60 (for 8 pencils)
8 rubber bands x $0.30 per rubber band = $2.40 (for 8 rubber bands)

Now, let's add up the costs:
$9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00

So, 8 rubbers and 8 pencils together will cost $12.00."
"Response:  We have 200 pounds of mushrooms and we need to distribute them among 40 restaurants in one city. Each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of mushrooms. So, if we divide 200 pounds by 40, we get: 

200 pounds / 40 = 5 pounds per restaurant

So, each restaurant will receive 5 pounds of mushrooms, leaving us with:

200 pounds - (40 x 5) = 200 pounds - 200 pounds = 0 pounds unused.

Therefore, all 200 pounds of mushrooms will be used."
"Response:  We know that in Soda there are 23,786 residents, including men and women. If we subtract the number of men (8417) from the total population, we get the number of women: 

23,786 - 8417 = 9092

Now let's find out how many children live in Soda. Since all other inhabitants are either men or women, we can conclude that all remaining inhabitants are children. Therefore, the number of children is equal to the difference between the total population and the sum of men and women:

23,786 - (8417 + 9092) = 23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277

Therefore, there are 6,277 children living in Soda."
"Response:  We know that Elain had 20 cards at first and collected three times as many in the first month, so she had:

20 x 3 = 60 cards

In the second month, she collected fewer than 60 cards, specifically 20 less than 60, which is:

60 - 20 = 40 cards

In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as she did in the first two months combined, so she had:

(40 + 60) x 2 = (100) x 2 = 200 cards

Therefore, Elain has 200 cards with Pokémon now."
Response:  We know that Mark edits 1000 proposals per week for both publishers A and B. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per proposal, so he earns $50 from Publisher A (1000 x 5 cents). Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, it will pay Mark $2 x 1000 = $2000 for the same number of proposals. Therefore, Mark's total income from both publishers is $50 + $2000 = $2050 per week.
Response:  We know that Baldur collects water from a well every morning and evening. In the morning, he collects 5 buckets of water (since each bucket contains 5 liters), so in total, he collects 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning. Similarly, in the evening, he collects 6 buckets of water (since each bucket contains 5 liters), so in total, he collects 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in the evening. Therefore, the daily amount of water collected by Baldur is 25 + 30 = 55 liters per day.
"Response:  John receives a prize of $5000 as a one-time payment and an additional 5% increase in his salary. If he earns $2000 per week and received the prize at the beginning of the year, how much did he earn in that year?

First, let's calculate the total amount earned for the year with the prize:

$2000 x 52 weeks = $104,000 (without the prize) + $5000 = $119,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount earned including the prize:

$119,000 x 1.05 (to account for the 5% increase in salary) = $126,450

Therefore, John earned $126,450 in that year, including the prize."
"Response:  We know that Joezy has 10 acres of vineyard and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. So, in total, she harvests 10 x 5 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate how many barrels of wine Joezy produces annually as follows:  
50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Response:  We know that Carl eats one butterbrot with two cubes of cheese every day for lunch, so he eats 7 cubes of cheese per week (7 days x 2 cubes/day).
We also know that he uses more cheese for omelets on three days than for butterbread, so let's calculate how much cheese he needs for omelets. If he eats one omelet per day on those three days, and each omelet requires one cube of cheese, then he needs 3 cubes of cheese for omelets (3 days x 1 cube/day).
Finally, we know that he prepares a large pasta dish with cheese to last several dinners throughout the week. Since he uses 8 cubes of cheese for this dish, we can add that to our total.
So, in total, Carl uses 7 + 3 + 8 = 18 cubes of cheese per week."
"Response:  First, we know that Djenet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens. Then she bought 6 pen sets with blue pens (each set has 9 pens) and 2 pen sets with red pens (each set has 6 pens). Therefore, the total number of pens she now has is:

32 + 6 x 9 = 32 + 54 = 86

So Djenet now has 86 pens in total."
Response:  We know that Brinly has already received grades for five control works and wants to get an average grade of 93. Since Mr. Bert allows students to drop the lowest score when calculating their semester averages, we need to find out what grade Brinly needs to receive on the sixth control work to achieve an overall average of 93. To do this, we first need to calculate the total score for the five completed control works:  5 x (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 458 Now, we add up all the scores and divide by the number of control works: 458 / 6 = 76.33 So, Brinly needs to receive at least 76.33 points on the sixth control work to have an overall average of 93.
"Response:  We know that Michael rode his bicycle for four weeks and then reduced the frequency of rides to two times a week. During the first four weeks, he rode 5 times a week, so he rode a total of 4 x 5 = 20 times. Each time, he traveled 25 kilometers, so he covered a total distance of 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers.

During the next three weeks, he rode only twice a week, but each time he traveled 60 kilometers, so he covered a total distance of 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers per week. Since there were three such weeks, he covered a total distance of 120 x 3 = 360 kilometers during this period.

Therefore, in total, Michael rode his bicycle for seven weeks and covered a distance of 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers."
Response:  We know that there are 25 shocolad chocolate bars and 80 apples in caramel in Joe's bag. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each apple in caramel. So if each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, then each apple in caramel must weigh 20 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all chocolate bars is 25 x 40 = 1000 grams, and the total weight of all apples in caramel is 80 x 20 = 1600 grams. The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is therefore 1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams or 2.6 kilograms.
Response:  We know that Rose bought 4 pirozhki on Monday and 3 times more on Tuesday (so 3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she bought 5 times more than on Tuesday, so 5 x 12 = 60. In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 pirozhki over the three days.
"Response:  We know that 20 dish sets cost $6000 and 1/2 set (5 dishes) costs $3000. So, we can calculate the price of one dish as follows:  
$3000 / 5 = $600 per dish  
Now, let's find out how much each cup costs. We are told that 20 cups cost less than $6000, so we can write an equation based on this information:  
$6000 - $x = $20 x $1200 where x is the number of cups Since we want to find out how much each cup costs, we need to solve for x in terms of the total cost. To do this, we can add $6000 to both sides of the equation:  
$6000 + $6000 - $x = ($20 x $1200) + $6000 Adding like terms gives us:  
$12,000 - $x = $24,000 Subtracting $x from both sides gives us:  
-$x = $9,600 Solving for x, we get:  
x = $9,600 / $20 x $1200 = $480 per cup Therefore, each cup costs $480."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sarah has already saved $10 before she started babysitting. So, she needs to earn an additional amount of money to buy the jacket and shoes. The cost of the jacket is $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Therefore, the total amount Sarah needs to save is:

$30 + $20 = $50

Now, let's calculate how many times Sarah needs to mow the lawn to earn this amount:

If Sarah earns $5 per time she mows the lawn, then she needs to mow the lawn:

$50 / $5 = 10 times

So, Sarah needs to mow the lawn 10 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."
"Response:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and has more white chickens than brown ones. So let's say he has x brown chickens and (42 - x) white chickens.

We also know that each brown chicken lays 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by brown chickens is 3x.

Each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is (42 - x) \* 5.

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the following equation:

3x + (42 - x) \* 5 = 42

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 42 - x \* 5 = 42

Combine like terms:

6x - x \* 5 = 42

Solve for x:

x = 10

So Jerry has 10 brown chickens."
"Response:  We know that Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour and he wants to walk around the local park which is rectangular in shape with dimensions of 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we need to calculate the total distance he covers first.

Total distance = Length x Width = 1.5 x 6 = 9 miles

Now, we can use our formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (in this case, the speed), and t is the time taken. Substituting the values, we get:

9 miles = 3 miles/hour x t

Solving for t, we get:

t = 9 miles / 3 miles/hour = 3 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 3 hours walking around the local park."
Response:  On the first day, Sloan counted 100 customers. On the second day, she had 50 more customers than on the first day, so she had 100 + 50 = 150 customers. Now, let's find out how many customers she had on the third day. If she had 500 customers in total, and she had 150 customers on the second day, then she must have had 500 - 150 = 350 customers on the third day. Therefore, Sloan counted 350 customers on the third day.
Response:  We know that initially there was twice as much water in the large basin as in the small basin. So if x gallons of water were in the small basin, then 2x gallons were in the large basin. Now we know that 4 minutes ago, the large basin had 4 times as much water as it does now. So if y gallons of water are currently in the large basin (where y is four times x), then 4y gallons were in the large basin 4 minutes ago. Finally, we know that the total amount of water lost from both basins is equal to the difference between the current amount of water in the large basin and the initial amount of water in the small basin. Therefore, the amount of water currently in the small basin can be found by subtracting the initial amount of water in the small basin from the total amount of water lost from both basins: Small basin = (4y - x) gallons. Substituting y = 4x for the value of y, we get: Small basin = (4x - x) gallons = 3x gallons. Answer: The current amount of water in the small basin is 3x gallons.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Loris needs to work to earn $320 (the cost of the shoes). We know that she earns $8 per hour, so:  

$320 / $8/hour = 40 hours  
Loris needs to work for 40 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes.  
Now let's calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn $32 (the cost of the belt). Again, we can use the same formula:  

$32 / $8/hour = 4 hours  
So Loris needs to work for 4 hours to earn enough money to buy the belt.  
In total, Loris needs to work for 40 + 4 = 44 hours to purchase both items."
"Response:  If Dженет will pay 165 $ in monthly installments for 12 months, then she will make a total of 1980 $ (165 x 12). So, if we subtract this amount from the initial amount of 2000 $, we get:  

Remainder = 2000 - 1980 = 20 $  
Therefore, the remainder at the end of 12 months will be 20 $."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more georginov than roses. So we can write an equation:

4 + 7 =... (1)

We also know that the total number of flowers in the vase is equal to the sum of the number of roses and the number of georginov. Therefore, we can write another equation:

Total = Roses + Georginov (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve them to find out how many flowers are in the vase?"
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet and Harriet is twice as young as Zach. So we can start with these two equations:

Adrian - Harriet = 3(21) = 63
Zach - Harriet = 2(21) = 42
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (Adrian's age and Zach's age). Can you solve for them?"
"Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's score (which is 34 points). So Yuri scored 34 + x points, where x is the number of points scored by Brianne. Since Brianne scored 17 more points than Naomi, she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

Naomi scored 68 points
Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's score (34 points)
Brianne scored 17 more points than Naomi

Let X be the number of points scored by Jodjo.

We can start with the fact that the total number of points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, we have:

68 + 34 + X + 85 = 251... (1)

Now let's simplify equation (1):

68 + 34 + X + 85 = 251

Combine like terms:

192 + X = 251

Subtract 192 from both sides:

X = 59

Therefore, Jodjo scored 59 points."
"Response:  We know that Carmen spends 10 minutes to solve each crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve each Sudoku puzzle. She solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles during her weekend. So, we can calculate the total time she spent playing these games as follows:

For crossword puzzles:
3 x 10 = 30 minutes

For Sudoku puzzles:
8 x 5 = 40 minutes

Total time spent playing both games:
30 + 40 = 70 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend."
Response:  We know that Selin used 90 liters of water from the bucket to water her garden. That means there are 90 - 90 = 0 liters left in the bucket. But we also know that she collected twice as much rainwater as was left in the bucket. So if there were 0 liters left in the bucket, then she collected 0 x 2 = 0 liters of rainwater. Therefore, there are currently 0 liters of water in the bucket.
"Response:  We know that Andy plants 90 geraniums and fewer petunias than geraniums. So if we let X be the number of petunias he plants, then X < 90 (since there are fewer petunias). Now we can write an equation based on this information:
X + 90 =?
We want to find out how many plants Andy has in total, so we add up the number of geraniums and petunias:
X + 90 = Total Plants
Can you solve for Total Plants?"
"Response:  We know that the company spends $15,000 per year on advertising and then spends one-third of this amount ($15,000 / 3 = $5,000) on advertising for the second year. Therefore, the total amount spent by the company on advertising over two years is:

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000"
"Response:  We know that Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour and Benji rents a banana-shaped raft for $18 per hour. If Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, we need to calculate how much they will pay in total.

First, let's calculate Carlos' cost:

3 hours x $30 per hour = $90

Next, let's calculate Benji's cost:

5 hours x $18 per hour = $90

Now, let's add their costs together:

$90 + $90 = $180

Therefore, Carlos and Benji will pay a total of $180 for their boat rentals."
"Response:  If Andrew takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, then he will spend half as much time (i.e., 3 days) returning from Rochester to New Jersey by car. Therefore, the total number of days for his trip is:

6 + 3 = 9 days"
Response:  We have 40 cards of water type and we lose 8 of them. So now we have 40 - 8 = 32 cards of water type left. Now, if James buys 14 cards of grass type, he will have 32 + 14 = 46 cards in total. The probability that a randomly selected card is of water type is 32/46 or approximately 0.70.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the meal without any discounts or promotions. We know that the base burrito costs $6.50, and Ched adds extra meat ($2), extra cheese ($1), avocado ($1), and two sauces ($0.25 each) for a total of:

$6.50 + $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.25 + $0.25 = $9.75

Next, Ched decides to upgrade his meal with additional items worth $3, so he pays an extra $3, bringing the total cost to:

$9.75 + $3 = $12.75

Finally, Ched uses his gift card worth $5, which reduces the amount he needs to pay:

$12.75 - $5 = $7.75

So, Ched needs to pay $7.75 for his meal."
"Response:  We know that Calinda can add 4 elements per minute and her mother can place half as many elements per minute as Calinda. So, if we let X be the number of minutes it takes for them to finish the puzzle, we have:

Calinda's contribution: 4X elements in X minutes
Mother's contribution: (1/2)X elements in X minutes
Total elements: 360

We want to find out how many minutes it will take for them to finish the puzzle. To do this, we need to set up an equation based on the information given:

4X + (1/2)X = 360

Simplifying the equation:

5X/2 = 360

Solving for X:

X = 720

So, it will take Calinda and her mother 720 minutes (or 12 hours) to finish the puzzle."
Response:  We know that 30% of the total number of arbuz were ready for harvest after two months, so we can find out how many arbuz were not ready yet. If 30% of 120 are ready, then 30% x 120 = 36 arbuz were ready. So, 120 - 36 = 84 arbuz were not ready yet. Now, we know that 3/4 of the remaining arbuz were ready for harvest after two weeks, so we need to calculate how many arbuz were left after two months and then find out how many were ready after two weeks. After two months, there will be 120 - 36 = 84 arbuz left. Then, 3/4 of 84 = 63 arbuz were ready after two weeks. Therefore, 84 - 63 = 21 arbuz were not ready for harvest after two weeks.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all cars:  
12 x 20,000 = 240,000 $  
Next, we add tax (10%):  
240,000 x 0.10 = 24,000 $  
Now we have the total cost with tax:  
240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 $  
Finally, we add registration fees (1000$ per car):  
264,000 x 12 = 3168000 $  
So, Mark pays $3,168,000 for all 12 cars."
"Response:  In Monday, Kaili collected 5 more rakuusk than Robert, so she collected 5 + 20 = 25 rakuusk. On Tuesday, Kaili collected twice as many rakuusk as she did on Monday, so she collected 2 x 25 = 50 rakuusk. Therefore, Kaili collects 50 rakuusk on Tuesday."""
"Response:  We know that there were 50 muhaviya in the garden and Dax found half as many beetles as he did ants. So if we let X be the number of beetles, then the number of ants is equal to half of X. Since Dax saw 50 ants, we can write the equation:

X + (1/2)X = 50... (1)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3X = 50... (2)

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

X = 16... (3)

So there are 16 beetles in the garden."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 36 penguins. If 1/3 of them (12) jumped into the ocean and swam away, then another 1/3 (12) went to eat in the cave. So how many are left?

12 + 12 = 24

Therefore, 24 penguins are still burning on the snow."
"Response:  We know that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and each branch can give 3 tomatoes in a week. So to calculate how many branches he needs, we need to divide the number of tomatoes he eats per day by the number of tomatoes each branch can give in a week:

6 tomatoes/day ÷ 3 tomatoes/week = 2 branches/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve needs 2 x 7 = 14 branches in total to meet his daily demand for tomatoes."
"Response:  We know that John wants to share his pizzas with 20 friends and each friend will get 4 pieces of pizza. So we can start by calculating how many pieces of pizza in total John needs for all his friends:  

20 friends x 4 pieces per friend = 80 pieces of pizza
Since pizzas are sold only in 8-piece portions, we need to round up to the nearest whole number:  

80 pieces / 8 portions per pizza = 10 pizzas
Therefore, John should order 10 pizzas to ensure that each of his 20 friends gets 4 pieces."
Response:  If Rем uses five empty pens to make one full pen, then he needs five empty pens for every full pen he makes. So if he has 25 empty pens and wants to make new pens when the ink runs out, he will need 25 x 5 = 125 full pens. Therefore, he will have 125 full pens after using all his empty pens.
Response:  Johnny took his salary of $20 and added $10 to it, so he had a total of $30. If he invested this amount and doubled it in one year, then he would have $60 after one year.
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jesse. So we can start with these equations:

Mary - Joan = 2... (1)
Joan - Jesse = 5... (2)

Now let's add equation (1) to equation (2):

Mary - Joan + Joan - Jesse = 2 + 5

Combine like terms:

Mary - Jesse = 7

So Mary is seven years younger than Jesse. Therefore, if Jesse is 20 years old, Mary is 20 - 7 = 13 years old, and Joan is 20 - 2 = 18 years old. The sum of their ages is:

13 + 18 + 20 = 41

Therefore, the sum of their ages is 41."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 1000 students in the school hall and after some of them left through exits A, B, and C, we need to find out how many students left through exit C.

Let X be the number of students who left through exit A (since 30% of 1000 is 300).
Let Y be the number of students who left through exit B (since 3/5 of 1000 is 600).
Let Z be the number of students who left through exit C (which means we want to find out how many students are left in the room after everyone has left through exits A and B).

Now, let's write an equation based on what we know:
X + Y + Z = 1000 (since all 1000 students started in the room)

We also know that X + Y = 300 + 600 = 900 (since 30% of 1000 is 300 and 3/5 of 1000 is 600)

So, we can substitute the value of X and Y into the first equation:
Z = 1000 - 900 = 100

Therefore, 100 students left through exit C."
"Response:  We know that James has more candies than Robert, so let's call the number of candies James has x + 6 (since he has 6 more than Robert). And we also know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has 2(x) candies. Now, if John has 54 candies, then we can set up an equation based on this information:  

2x = 54 + 6 

Simplifying the equation:  

2x = 60 

Dividing both sides by 2:  

x = 30 

So, James has 30 + 6 = 36 candies and John has 3 times as many candies as James, which is 3 \* 36 = 108 candies."
"Response: 

1. Dolly reads her two books. That means she will read 2 books in total.
2. Pandora reads one book. That means she will read 1 book in total.
3. Now, they both read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book, and Pandora will read Dolly's books (plural).
4. In total, Dolly will have read 2 + 1 = 3 books.
5. Pandora will have read 1 + 2 = 3 books as well.
6. Therefore, at the end of it all, both Dolly and Pandora will have read 3 books each."
"Response:  We know that Mike has to write 2 letters per week (14 letters in total), and each letter takes him 6 minutes to write. So, he spends 6 minutes x 2 letters = 12 minutes writing each letter. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate how much time Mike spends writing letters per day as follows:

12 minutes/letter x 2 letters/day = 24 minutes/day

Now, let's calculate how many hours Mike spends writing letters per week:

24 minutes/day x 7 days/week = 168 minutes/week

Therefore, Mike spends 168 minutes/week or 2 hours and 48 minutes writing letters per week."
Response:  We know that Jason has a phone plan with 1000 minutes per month and he makes 15-minute calls to his boss every day, which is 450 minutes (15 x 30 = 450). He also made 300 additional minutes of calls to other people, so in total, he used 750 minutes (450 + 300) out of his 1000 minute allowance. Therefore, there are 250 minutes left for Jason in this month (1000 - 750 = 250).
Response:  We know that Kyle took 5 pieces of fried potatoes from Griffin, so there were 24 - 5 = 19 left. Billy took twice as much as Kyle, so he took 2 x 5 = 10 pieces. Now there are 19 - 10 = 9 left. Dinner gave Griffin a handful of her fried potatoes, and then Colby took 3 fewer than the number of pieces that Kyle took, so she took 3 less than 5 = 2 pieces. Therefore, in the end, there were 9 + 2 = 11 pieces of fried potatoes left for Griffin. So, dinner gave Griffin 11 - 5 = 6 pieces of fried potatoes.
"Response:  We know that in one aquarium there are 4 snails and in another aquarium there are 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in the two aquariums. If there are an equal number of fish in both aquariums, then we can set up the following equation:

Let x be the number of fish in Aquarium 1 and y be the number of fish in Aquarium 2.

We know that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish:

(32 - 4) = 2(x + y)

Simplifying the equation:

28 = 2(x + y)

Solving for x and y:

x = 14
y = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  We know that Dijin pays Grimer $250 per hour and she needs to pay for 6 hours each day (9 am - 3 pm) x 4 days a week = 24 hours/week. Since there are 5 weeks of filming, the total number of hours Dijin will need to pay Grimer is:

24 hours/week x 5 weeks = 1200 hours

Now we need to calculate how much Dijin will pay Grimer in total. To do this, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate:

1200 hours x $250/hour = $300,000

Finally, since Grimer gives Dijin a discount of 10%, we subtract 10% of $300,000 from the total amount paid:

$300,000 x 10% = $30,000

So, Dijin will pay Grimer $270,000 ($300,000 - $30,000)."
Response:  We know that Isabel spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98 on party supplies. She divided the cost equally among three people, so each person paid $98 / 3 = $32.
"Response:  We know that each mesh of luka weighs 50 pounds and costs $1.50 per pound. So if Pova bought 4 bags of lukas, he spent:

4 x 50 = 200 pounds
x $1.50 = $300

Therefore, Pova spent $300 on 4 bags of lukas."
"Response:  We know that Sally (Sue's sister) ate 5 pieces of pastry on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. So in total, she ate 5 + 13 = 18 pieces of pastry. 
We also know that Sue ate 4 times more than her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 x 18 = 72 pieces of pastry on Monday. 
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as much as her sister, so she ate 2 x 18 = 36 pieces of pastry. In total, Sue ate 72 + 36 = 108 pieces of pastry.  
Since each piece of pastry contains 200 calories, we can calculate the total number of calories consumed by both sisters as follows: 
For Sally: 5 x 200 = 1000 calories (on Monday) + 13 x 200 = 2600 calories (on Tuesday) = 3600 calories in total. 
For Sue: 72 x 200 = 14400 calories (on Monday) + 36 x 200 = 7200 calories (on Tuesday) = 21600 calories in total. 
Therefore, Sue consumed 21600 - 3600 = 18000 calories more than her sister."
