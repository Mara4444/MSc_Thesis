Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads. So, we know that the number of downloads is x. Now let's find out how much it increased or decreased during the second month. Since it's 3 times more than the first month's downloads, we can say that the number of downloads doubled. So, the number of downloads after the second month would be 2x. But since they also cut down by 30%, so now the number of downloads will be (2x) * 0.7 = 1.4x.
Response:  The number of donuts is 12 (3 x 4), so we multiply that number with 68. Then add it up with the other numbers. So, the total cost is: 68 + 80 + 55 = $221

Response:  The first friend said that there were 80 jelly beans in the jar. So we know that there are at least 80 jelly beans in the jar. Now let's say that the second friend thinks that there are about 90 jelly beans in the jar. That means that there are at most 90 jelly beans in the jar. Since the total number of jelly beans in the jar is less than 100, it can be concluded that the average guess for the three friends would be: (80 + 90) / 3 = 60

Response:  Jean has 30 lollipops. Jean eats 2 of the lollipops. With the remaining lollipops, Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. So, we have 20 lollipops left.

Response:  The total number of gems is 175 + 35 = 190. So we need to find out how many of these are diamonds. We know that there are 175 diamonds. So we subtract 35 from 175 (175 - 35) = 140. Now we have to divide this number by 2 because each ruby has two rubies. This means that 140 / 2 = 70. Therefore, there are 70 diamonds in the chest.

- Number of pieces of straw per rat = 6
- Number of pieces of straw per hamster = 5
- Number of pieces of straw per rabbit = 20
- Total number of pieces of straw for all animals = 160
- Number of rats in each cage = (Total number of pieces of straw / Number of pieces of straw per rat) * Number of cages

"Response:  The big pool was filled up to 2 * (4/5) = 1.5 gallons per minute. So it took about 5 minutes for that amount of water to fill up the big pool. Since the leak rate is constant, we can calculate how long it takes to empty the big pool using this formula:
t = 1/(leak rate)
So t = 1/(2 * 4/5) = 1/4.
That means the big pool will be empty in about 4/4 = 8 hours."
