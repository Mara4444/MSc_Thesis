Response: 400 grams of mikhu (chickpeas) contain approximately 250 calories. If you have 300 grams of mikhu and want to know how many calories that is equivalent to in terms of mikhunkis (small balls), then each mikunksi contains approximately 500 calories. Therefore, if you have 2000 calories worth of mikhunkis (which would be 400 grams x 500 calories/gram = 2000 calories), or 1800 calories worth of mikhunkis (which would be 360 grams x 500 calories/gram = 1800 calories).
