"Response:  The answer to the question is that if a person can walk 3 miles in 20 minutes, then they can walk 6 miles in 1 hour and 45 minutes (or 1hr 45min).

Explanation:

If a person can walk 3 miles in 20 minutes, it means they are walking at a speed of 3/20 = 0.15 miles per minute. Therefore, they can walk 6 miles in 1 hour by multiplying their current speed by the time taken to cover 1 hour:

6 miles / 0.15 miles/minute = 40 minutes

So, the person can walk 6 miles in 1 hour and 45 minutes (or 1hr 45min) as required."
"Response:  The ratio of the number of brain cells to the number of fan cells in a person's brain is not known with certainty, as there are limited scientific studies on this topic. However, some research suggests that the average human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, which are specialized cells that process and transmit information. In comparison, the average human nose contains around 20 million olfactory receptor neurons, which are responsible for detecting odors. Therefore, if we assume that each olfactory receptor neuron corresponds to one ""fan cell,"" then the ratio of brain cells to fan cells would be roughly 430,000 to 1."

Response:  The company has a total of 140 employees, and it provides them with an annual salary increase of 10% every year. If the first six months of the year are considered as probationary period, then the employee will be eligible for a salary increment of 5% after completing one year of service, and thereafter, they will receive a salary increment of 10% every year until their fifth year of service. Therefore, if an employee joins the company in January, they will get a salary increment of 5% in July (the end of the probationary period), followed by another 10% increment in January of the next year, and so on.
Response:  The distance between two points on a straight line is equal to the square of their separation distance. In this case, the distance between the starting point and the endpoint of Sofia's journey is 100 miles, so the distance between any two points on her route can be calculated as follows: Distance = Square Root (Separation Distance^2). Therefore, if Sofia travels for 4 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, she will cover a total distance of 120 miles (Distance = Square Root (4^2 + 30^2) = 120 miles).

Answer: If an arti has 12 marigold plants, 9 petunia plants, and 17 begonia plants, and the cost of each plant is as follows: Marigolds - Rs. 2.74 per pot, Petunias - Rs. 1.87 per pot, and Begonias - Rs. 2.12 per pot, then how many rupees will be spent on all these plants in total? If the arti does not have any other expenses, then what percentage of the total amount will be spent on each type of plant?

Explanation: The answer to this question can be calculated by adding up the cost of each plant and dividing it by the total number of plants. In this case, if there are 12 marigold plants, 9 petunia plants, and 17 begonia plants, then the total cost would be:

Marigolds = 12 x Rs. 2.74 = Rs. 32.96
Petunias = 9 x Rs. 1.87 = Rs. 16.53
Begonias = 17 x Rs. 2.12 = Rs. 35.04
Total Cost = Rs. 32.96 + Rs. 16.53 + Rs. 35.04 = Rs. 84.53

Response:  The number of times the ball bounces on each side of the court is not fixed and can vary depending on various factors such as the speed and spin of the ball, the height and positioning of the net, and the skill level of the players. However, if we assume that the ball bounces equally on both sides of the court (which may not always be the case), then the probability of the ball landing on a particular side after one bounce is 0.5 or 50%. After two bounces, the probability becomes 0.25 or 25%, and so on. Therefore, if the ball bounces four times in total, the probability of it landing on any given side at least once is 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 or 25%.

"Response:  The number of pictures in the album ""Jamal's Photos"" on Instagram is 1800, and each picture has an average of 50 likes. If we assume that the distribution of likes follows a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, then the probability that a randomly selected picture from this album will have more than 60 likes can be calculated as follows: P(x > 60) = Φ((60 - μ) / σ), where μ is the mean (50) and σ is the standard deviation (10). Solving for x, we get x > 60 if Φ(-2) > 0.43, or approximately 43%. Therefore, there are about 43% chances that a randomly selected picture from Jamal's photos on Instagram will have more than 60 likes."
Response:  If Saashaa had bought all the cars at their original prices, he would have spent a total of Rs. 300,000. However, since he purchased some of them at discounted prices, his actual cost is less than that amount. To calculate the exact amount, we need to subtract the discount amounts from the original prices and then add up the resulting figures. For example, if he bought one car for Rs. 10 lakh (original price) but got a discount of Rs. 1 lakh, his actual cost for that car would be Rs. 9 lakh (Rs. 10 lakh - Rs. 1 lakh). Similarly, if he bought five cars for Rs. 4 lakh each (original price), but got a discount of Rs. 10,000 on each car, his actual cost for those cars would be Rs. 3.6 lakh each (Rs. 4 lakh - Rs. 10,000). Therefore, the total amount Saashaa actually spent on all six cars is: Rs. 300,000 + Rs. 90,000 + Rs. 3.6 lakh + Rs. 3.6 lakh + Rs. 3.6 lakh + Rs. 3.6 lakh = Rs. 478,000.

Response:  The total value of the investment made by Edrin and Lila in their business over a period of four years is $120,000. If they had invested equally every year for four years, then the share of each partner would be $30,000 per year. After four years, Edrin's share would have increased to $40,000, while Lila's share would have decreased to $30,000. Therefore, if Edrin and Lila had invested equally every year for four years, then after four years, Edrin's share would be $40,000, and Lila's share would be $30,000.

The price of one mango is $3, and the price of one orange is $2. If you want to buy 4 mangoes and 2 oranges for a total of $100, how many mangoes will you be able to buy?

Solution:
If the price of one mango is $3 and the price of one orange is $2, then the cost of 4 mangoes = 4 x $3 = $12. The cost of 2 oranges = 2 x $2 = $4. Therefore, the total cost = $12 + $4 = $16. So, you can buy 4 mangoes and 2 oranges for $100."

Response:  The answer to the question is as follows: If Arden spends 2 hours playing video games every day, and he earns $10 per hour working on his computer, then he will have earned $20 in a week (7 days). So if he spends half of his daily gaming time on Sundays (which is 2 hours), he will have spent a total of 4 hours playing video games during the week, which means he will have earned $80 in that time ($20 x 4 hours). Therefore, Arden has earned $80 more than he would have earned if he had played video games for the full 10 hours each day.

"Response:  The time taken by Bil to complete all the tasks will be:

Time taken by Bil to complete one roll = Time taken by him to make 300 rolls x Time taken by him to make one roll = 300 hours

Similarly, the time taken by Bil to complete one course = Time taken by him to make 120 courses x Time taken by him to make one course = 120 hours

And the time taken by Bil to complete one biggit = Time taken by him to make 60 biggits x Time taken by him to make one biggit = 60 hours

So, the total time taken by Bil to complete all the tasks is:
Total time taken = Time taken by Bil to complete one roll + Time taken by Bil to complete one course + Time taken by Bil to complete one biggit = 300 hours + 120 hours + 60 hours = 580 hours

Therefore, Bil will take approximately 580 hours (or 23 days) to complete all the tasks if he works continuously without any breaks."
"Response:  The number of houses in the neighborhood is 50, and each house has a garden with 30 plants. If every plant produces 2 fruits per year, and each fruit weighs 0.5 kg, then how many kilograms of fruits will be produced in total?

Solution:
To find out the total weight of fruits produced in the neighborhood, we need to multiply the number of houses by the number of plants in each house and then multiply that result by the number of fruits produced by each plant.

Number of houses = 50
Number of plants per house = 30
Total number of fruits = Number of plants x Fruits per plant
= 50 x 30
= 1500 fruits

Now, let's calculate the total weight of fruits produced:
Weight of one fruit = Weight of one plant x Number of fruits per plant
= 0.5 kg x 1500 fruits
= 750 kg

Therefore, the total weight of fruits produced in the neighborhood is 750 kg."

"Response:  The answer to the question is as follows:

If a person has been working for an organization for 3 years and has taken 3 months of leave, then their salary will be reduced by 30% for that period. If they are paid $90 per charge, then their monthly salary will be $63 after deduction of 30%. Therefore, if they work for 3 years, their total salary will be $219. However, if they take 3 months of leave in the middle of those 3 years, their salary will be reduced by 30%, which means they will have to work for 4.5 years to earn the same amount of money. So, in this case, the employee's salary will be affected by taking leaves."

Response:  The time it takes for a bee to make honey depends on various factors, including the species of bee and the availability of nectar-rich flowers. On average, a worker honey bee (Apis mellifera) can collect about 1/8 teaspoon of nectar per flight, and it makes about 1,000 flights per day. Therefore, if we assume that each flight takes approximately 20 minutes, then it would take around 4 hours for a bee to gather enough nectar to produce just one pound of honey. However, this is just an estimate, as the actual time may vary depending on several factors such as weather conditions, flower abundance, and the number of bees in the area.

"Response:  If Solon had counted 100 houses in the first day, and then he counted 50 more houses in each of the next two days, how many houses did he count in total?

Solution:
To find out how many houses Solon counted in total, we need to add up the number of houses he counted on each day. On the first day, he counted 100 houses, so that's 100 houses. On the second day, he counted 50 more houses, so that's an additional 50 houses, for a total of 150 houses. On the third day, he counted 50 more houses again, so that's another 50 houses, for a total of 200 houses. Therefore, Solon counted a total of 200 houses."

Response:  The number of teeth in a full set of dentures can vary depending on the individual's needs and the type of denture being used. On average, a complete set of dentures for an adult may have around 32 to 36 teeth. However, some people may require more or fewer teeth depending on their specific needs and the condition of their mouth. For example, someone who has lost all of their teeth due to periodontal disease may need a full set of dentures with 40 to 50 teeth, while someone who has only lost a few teeth may be able to get by with a partial denture that contains just a few replacement teeth. Ultimately, the number of teeth in a full set of dentures will depend on the individual's unique needs and circumstances.

"Response:  The ratio of the number of girls to boys in a class of 30 students, if James is 20 years old and Mirri is 16 years old, can be calculated as follows:

Let's assume that there are x girls in the class. Since Mirri is 16 years old, she represents 1/5 of the total number of students (since 16 / 5 = 3.2). Therefore, the number of boys in the class is equal to 30 - x.

So, the ratio of girls to boys in the class is x : 30 - x."
Response:  The number of students in the school is 1000, and there are three departments - A, B, and C. Each department has a head teacher who is responsible for managing their respective section of students. If 30% of the students from Department A move to Department B, then the number of students left in Department A will be 70%, which means that 70 out of every 100 students are still in Department A. Similarly, if 30% of the students from Department B move to Department C, then the number of students left in Department B will be 70%, which means that 70 out of every 100 students are still in Department B. Therefore, the total number of students in all three departments after this movement will be 210 (70 x 3 = 210).

Response:  If Jason can make and sell 1000 phones per month, and he spends 15 minutes with each customer to sell them a phone, then in one month, he will have spent a total of 450 hours (15 minutes/day x 30 days) selling phones. Since he has 300 additional man-hours available, he will be able to spend an extra 300 hours on other activities, such as marketing or administration. Therefore, if there are 30 days in the month, Jason will have 12,000 man-hours available for other activities (450 hours from selling phones + 300 hours from his additional time).
Response:  If Griffn had 24 francs and gave 5 to the beggar, then he has 19 francs left. The beggar received 3 francs from Griffn. So, if Griffn had 27 francs at the end, he gave away 8 francs (27 - 19 = 8).
Response:  Each of the two images has 16 pixels, and each pixel value represents a grayscale intensity value between 0 and 255. Therefore, in total, both images have 16 x 2 = 32 grayscale intensity values. If we compare the number of grayscale intensity values in each image, we can see that one image has 32 intensity values, while the other image has only 16 intensity values. So, if we want to find out how many grayscale intensities are present in each image, we can divide the total number of intensity values by the number of intensity values in each image. In this case, the ratio of the number of grayscale intensities in each image is 32 / 16 = 2.
