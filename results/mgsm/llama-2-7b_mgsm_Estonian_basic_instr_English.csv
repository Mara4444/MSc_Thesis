So, the total area of the rooms is 1/4 x 15 = 5."

"Response: 37.5 miles
Explanation: To find out how many miles Sophia can drive with one tank of gas, we need to divide the total amount of gas she has (160 kilometers) by the distance traveled since her last fill-up (4 gallons). This gives us an estimate of 40 miles. However, since Sophia's car has a larger fuel tank than what is stated in the problem (12 gallons instead of 10 gallons), we can multiply this number by 1.33 to account for the extra capacity. Therefore, the final answer is 37.5 miles."

Explanation:
Jamali telefonil has 1800 photos, and each photo can be displayed in 4 different sizes (small, medium, large, extra-large). Therefore, the total number of photos that can be displayed is:
1800 x 4 = 7200
However, since we are asked about the maximum number of photos that can be displayed, we need to consider the largest size (extra-large), which has a resolution of 5000x3750 pixels. The area of this image is:
5000 x 3750 = 18750000 square pixels
Therefore, the maximum number of photos that can be displayed at once is:
18750000 / 4 = 46875000 photos
So, there can be approximately 4.6 million photos displayed at once if all are set to the largest size."

Explanation: To find out how many dollars Benedict has after three years, we need to multiply the initial amount by the interest rate (2%) for three years. So, Benedict will have $100 x 2% = $2 after one year, $100 x 2% = $2 x 3 = $6 after two years, and $100 x 2% = $6 x 3 = $18 after three years. Therefore, Benedict has $100 + $2 + $6 + $18 = $34567890 after three years."

Since there were three groups, we need to calculate the number of students in each group separately: Group B had 50% of the remaining students (i.e., 1000 - 300 = 700), and Group C had 20% of the remaining students (i.e., 700 * 20 / 100 = 140). Therefore, the total number of students who remained in school after the first semester is 300 + 700 + 140 = 276."
