Response: 150 meters. Explanation: According to the question, Jamie and his friends decided to race for 3 laps around the track, which is 60 meters long. Since each lap takes them 2 minutes to complete, they will cover a total distance of 60 x 3 = 180 meters in one round. Therefore, if they continue racing for 3 more rounds, they will cover a total distance of 180 + 180 + 180 = 540 meters. Finally, since there are 3 races in total, the total distance covered by Jamie and his friends will be 540 / 3 = 180 meters.

The number of DTH connections sold by Billile during the week is given as 8 x 3 = 24. Since each connection requires one dish, the total number of dishes required to provide service to all 24 customers is 24 x 3 = 72. However, since some customers may not have purchased any additional dishes, we need to subtract the number of customers who did not purchase any extra dishes from the total number of dishes required. Therefore, the final answer is 72 - 3 = 69."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the number of rupees that Siyobhan received as gift money.
Ramanko's share is Rs. 5 more than half of Remand's share, which means Ramanko received Rs. (5/2) × Rs. 40 = Rs. 30 more than Remand's share.
So, Remand received Rs. 40 - Rs. 30 = Rs. 10.
Siyobhan received Rs. 20 less than Remand's share, which means Siyobhan received Rs. (Rs. 40 - Rs. 20) = Rs. 20."

"Response:  If it takes 250 grams of rice to make one chips packet and if we produce 3000 packets per day, then the total amount of rice used in producing those packets would be:

Total amount of rice = Number of packets produced per day x Amount of rice required for one packet
= 3000 x 250
= 75,000 grams

So, if we produce 1800 packets per day, then the total amount of rice used in producing those packets would be:

Total amount of rice = Number of packets produced per day x Amount of rice required for one packet
= 1800 x 250
= 450,000 grams"
Response:  The profit of selling one pound of madhumakki (a type of wood) is $10.

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of alarms that Gregle has set in one day as follows:
Gregle sets three alarms at 6 AM, 12 PM, and 6 PM. When an alarm goes off, it rings for 3 minutes.
So, in the first hour after an alarm goes off (i.e., from 7 AM to 8 AM), there are 3 x 3 = 9 alarms ringing simultaneously. In the second hour (from 8 AM to 9 AM), there are 9 x 3 = 27 alarms ringing. Similarly, in each subsequent hour, there are 27 alarms ringing.
Therefore, the total number of alarms that Gregle has set in one day is:
9 + 27 + 54 +... + 27 = 120
Note: The calculation assumes that Gregle sets only three alarms per day and does not change them during the day. If Gregle sets more than three alarms or changes them during the day, the calculation would be different."

"Response:  The total amount of money earned by Edrian and Lyla in their lifetime can be calculated as follows:

Edrian's earnings = Total earnings / Number of years worked x Percentage increase per year

Total earnings = Edrian's earnings + Lyla's earnings
= $480,000 + $640,000

Total amount of rice produced = Number of farmers x Amount of rice produced per farmer
= 300 x 200 kg/month
= 60,000 kg/month

So, if it takes 4 months for the rice to mature, the total amount of rice produced will be:

Total amount of rice produced = Months taken for maturation x Total amount of rice produced per month
= 4 x 60,000 kg/month
= 240,000 kg

Therefore, the total amount of rice produced by all the farmers is 240,000 kg."
Response:  The time taken by the black cat to reach the destination is 15 minutes. Therefore, the distance traveled by the black cat in 100 yards = (15 x 100) = 1500 feet. Since there are 3 feet in 1 yard, the distance traveled by the black cat in 100 yards = (1500 x 3) = 4500 feet. Now, we need to find out how many pats of the ball the black cat can throw in that distance. As per the given information, the black cat can throw the ball for 100 pats in 1 minute and 20 seconds. So, the number of pats thrown by the black cat in 4500 feet = (4500 / 100) = 45 pats. Therefore, the winner of the game is the one who throws the most pats. In this case, the white cat threw 34 pats more than the black cat, so the white cat won the game.

Response: 120000
Response:  The total cost of the jacket and two pairs of shoes will be $30 + (2 x $20) = $60. So, each pair of shoes will cost $40. Since there are four children in total, they will have to share the cost among themselves. If each child has to pay $5 for one pair of shoes, then they will have to pay a total of $5 x 4 = $20 for all four pairs of shoes. Therefore, the remaining amount that Saral needs to pay is $60 - $20 = $40.
Response:  The number of bags of rice that Jeri can produce in one day is 42 bags. If he works for 8 hours a day, then he can produce 5 bags of rice per hour. So, if he works for 16 hours (from midnight to 4 PM), then he can produce 80 bags of rice (5 x 16 = 80). However, if he works for only 4 hours (from midnight to 4 AM), then he can produce only 20 bags of rice (5 x 4 = 20). Therefore, if he works an extra two hours beyond his usual working time, he will be able to produce 2 additional bags of rice (2 x 2 = 4).

Response:  The total amount of money that Carlos and Benji have between them is $40 + $18 = $58. If Carlos has 30 days' worth of expenses (which is $30), then he has $58 / 30 = $1.90 left after paying his expenses. Similarly, if Benji has 5 days' worth of expenses (which is $18), then he has $58 - $18 = $40 left after paying his expenses.
Response: 14 days
"Response:  The probability of getting exactly 8 water cards and exactly 14 fire cards in a deck of 52 playing cards is (using the binomial distribution):

P(exactly 8 water cards) = (8/52)^30 x (16/52)^20 x (4/52)^4 = 0.0079

P(exactly 14 fire cards) = (14/52)^30 x (4/52)^20 x (1/52)^4 = 0.0007

So the probability that either exactly 8 water or exactly 14 fire cards are drawn from the deck is approximately 0.0079 + 0.0007 = 0.0086."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate that the total number of tarabooj (rice) required to make 30 bags of 5 kg each is:

Total number of tarabooj = Total quantity of rice / Quantity per bag
= 240 kg / 5 kg/bag
= 48 bags

Since there are only two farmers working together, they will be able to produce 2 bags of rice per day, which means it will take them 18 days to complete the task (2 bags/day x 18 days). Therefore, the answer is 30."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total weight of tomatoes that Aafni's family consumed in one day as follows:
6 people x 8 tomatoes per person = 48 tomatoes
Since each tomato weighs approximately 150 grams, the total weight of tomatoes consumed by Aafni's family in one day is:
48 tomatoes x 150 grams/tomato = 7200 grams or 7.2 kilograms (kg)
Now, if Aafni wants to produce 3 kg of tomato sauce, she will need to collect 3 kg - 7.2 kg = 4.2 kg of tomatoes from her garden."
Response: 200 people can be accommodated in each of the 8 rooms, so the total number of people that Jon can host is 200 x 8 = 1600. Since he has already given away 4 slabs of pizza (8 x 4 = 32), he still has 1600 - 32 = 1568 left to distribute among his guests.

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total amount of chips that Grifin had at first as follows:
Grifin had 24 vats of chips, and each vat contains 5 kg of chips. Therefore, the total amount of chips Grifin had is:
24 vats x 5 kg/vat = 120 kg
Now, let's see what happened to those chips:
Kailale took away 3 vats of chips from Grifin, which means Kailale got 3 x 5 kg = 15 kg of chips.
So, after Kailale took the chips, Grifin was left with:
120 kg - 15 kg = 105 kg of chips
Finally, if Grifin gave 7 vats of chips to Jinger, then Jinger received:
7 vats x 5 kg/vat = 35 kg of chips
Therefore, the final amount of chips Grifin had after giving them to Jinger is:
105 kg - 35 kg = 70 kg of chips"

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the total amount of rice consumed by Somba's wife as follows:

On Monday, she consumed 5 cups of rice (4 + 1 = 5).
On Tuesday, she consumed 3 cups of rice (2 + 1 = 3).
On Wednesday, she consumed 13 cups of rice (10 + 3 = 13).
In total, she consumed 2000 cups of rice (5 + 3 + 13 = 2000). Therefore, the answer is 2000."
