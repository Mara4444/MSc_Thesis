"Response:  The total time taken to download the file will be:
Time = Distance / Speed
Distance = Total size of the file (in GB)
Speed = Download speed in GB/minute

In this case, the distance is 200 GB and the download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the total time taken to download the file is:
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes

So, after the forced restart, Carla will have to spend additional 20 minutes to complete the download, making the total time taken to download the file 100 + 20 = 120 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes."
Response:  John je v 175 milách od domu po konci 4 hodin.
Response:  Eliza's earnings for this week would be $490. To calculate this, we need to multiply Eliza's regular hourly rate by the number of hours she worked (40) and then add the amount of money she earned in overtime ($10 x 1.2 = $12). So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $490 = $10 x 40 + $12.
"Response:  Over the three months, the program had a total of 210 downloads. To find this answer, we can use the information given in the problem: In the first month, there were 60 downloads; in the second month, there were 3 times as many downloads (or 60 x 3 = 180 downloads); and in the third month, there were 30% fewer downloads than in the second month (or 180 - (30/100) = 126 downloads). Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 210 downloads."
Response:  The total cost of the pastries was $497.
"Response: 4 years

Reasoning:
Carlos spends $90 to plant the lemon tree. In the first year, he does not earn any money because there are no lemons yet. In the second year, he grows 7 lemons that he can sell for $1.5 each, so he earns $10.5 ($7 x $1.5). In the third year, he grows 7 more lemons, so he earns $10.5 again. In the fourth year, he has grown enough lemons to start selling them regularly, so he starts earning money. Therefore, it takes 4 years for him to start earning money from his lemon tree."

"Response:  $240.00
Cynthia eat one serving of ice cream every night, so in total she eat 60 servings (60 days) = 60 x 1 = 60 servings.
She buy cartons of ice cream with 15 servings per carton, so she buy 60/15 = 4 cartons of ice cream.
Cost of each carton is $4.00, so the cost of all cartons is $4.00 x 4 = $16.00.
So after 60 days, Cynthia spent $16.00 on ice cream."
"Response: 30 miles.

My reasoning is as follows:

Henry made two stops, so he traveled a total distance of 60 miles minus the distance of each stop. The first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance between the first and second stop is 40 miles (60 - 20)."

"Response:  John spends  50 hours per week taking care of the dogs.

Explanation:
John takes care of 10 dogs, which means he has to walk and take care of their business for each dog every day. Since it takes half an hour (0.5 hours) to walk and take care of one dog's needs, John will have to spend 0.5 x 10 = 5 hours per day on dog care. Therefore, in one week, John spends 5 days \* 5 hours/day = 25 hours/week taking care of the dogs."

"Response:  John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour (mph).
Rozhovor:  Okay, let's see...John runs 60 miles a week, which means he runs for 60/7 = 8.5 hours per week. Since he runs 3 days a week, his daily running time is 8.5/3 = 2.83 hours per day. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, so his speed on that day is 3/2.83 = 1.04 mph. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time, so his speed on those days is (2 x 2.83) / 2 = 1.46 mph. Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 mph."

Grandma Jones: Oh, hello there! *smiling* I'm so glad you're here to help me with this little problem. You see, I baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon today. *counting on her fingers* And I cut each one into 8 pieces... *trails off* Hmmm...I wonder how many pieces the guests took? Let me see...if I cut each pie into 8 pieces...*counting again*...that means there are 8 x 5 = 40 pieces of pie in total. *looks up* But then, at the end of the evening, there were still 14 pieces left over! *excitedly* So, if we subtract the number of pieces that were left over from the total number of pieces, we get...*starts counting*...20 pieces must have been taken by the guests! *smiling widely* Isn't that just delicious? *giggles* Do you want a piece of pie? *offering a plate*"

"Response:  Charlie's net profit = (Selling price x Number of candles sold) - Cost of supplies
= ($2.00 x 20 candles) - ($10.00 + $10.00)
= $40.00 - $20.00
= $20.00
Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $20.00 if he makes and sells 20 candles."
"Response:  To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

Day 1 (Monday):
Meredith wrote 5 articles, which means she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours researching and writing on Monday.

Day 2 (Tuesday):
Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 x 5 = 7 articles. She also spent 4 hours researching and writing for each article, so she spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours on Tuesday.

Day 3 (Wednesday):
Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 x 7 = 14 articles. She also spent 4 hours researching and writing for each article, so she spent 14 x 4 = 56 hours on Wednesday.

Adding up all these hours gives us the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours."
Response:  The package of Post-it notes that Candice purchased contained 80 notes.
Response:  John bought 2 x 3 = 6 red ties and 3 blue ties, so the total number of ties he bought is 6 + 3 = 9.  The cost of one red tie is 1/2 x $40 = $20, so the total cost of red ties is 6 x $20 = $120.  The cost of one blue tie is $40, so the total cost of blue ties is 3 x $40 = $120.  Therefore, John spent a total of $120 + $120 = $240 on ties.

"Response:  Lloyd makes $408 per week on eggs.

Explanation:
Lloyd produces 252 eggs per day, which means he produces 18,360 eggs per week (252 x 7). Since he sells each egg for $2, the total amount of money Lloyd makes from selling eggs per week is:

$2 x 18,360 = $36,720

So, Lloyd makes $36,720 per week on eggs."
Response:  To determine the time it takes for Tom to return, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate x Speed. In this case, the distance traveled by Tom during his trip is 20 miles (from 1 to 4 PM), and he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. Therefore, the time it takes for Tom to get back is: Time = 20 miles / (6 miles/hour x 10 miles/hour) = 3 hours. So, it will take Tom 3 hours to get back.
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that the total weight of Uriah's book bag is 15 pounds, and that the comic books weigh 1/4 pound each. So, if he removes 30 comic books, the new weight of the comic books will be 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. This means that the remaining weight of the book bag is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since the toys weigh 1/2 pound each, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 toys to bring the weight of his book bag down to 15 pounds.
Response:  The mechanic earned $360 more on Friday than on Thursday.
Response:  The Doubirtire family currently has a total of 29 kittens - 7 kittens they adopted from the shelter plus 22 kittens born to Patchy and Trixie.
"Response: 15 bags.

My reasoning is as follows:

Jean has 30 lollipops and he eats 2 of them, so he has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.
He wants to package 2 lollipops in each bag, so he needs to divide the number of remaining lollipops by 2: 28 / 2 = 14 bags.
Therefore, Jean can fill 15 bags with his remaining lollipops."
Response:  Peter může odejít do kin celkově 6x.
Response:  The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 32. To calculate this, you need to subtract the total weight of the truck (driver + empty truck) from the weight limit of the bridge: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds. Dividing this amount by the weight of a single box (15 pounds) gives you the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded: 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes. However, since you cannot load an odd number of boxes onto a vehicle, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 32 boxes.

"Response:  Jim spends 16 hours watching TV and 8 hours reading in 4 weeks.

My reasoning is as follows:

* If Jim watches TV for 2 hours per session, he will watch TV for 2 x 4 = 8 hours in one week.
* Since he does this 3 times a week, he will watch TV for 8 x 3 = 24 hours in one month (or 4 weeks).
* Similarly, if he reads for half as long as he watches TV, he will read for half of 24 hours = 12 hours in one month.
* Therefore, over the course of 4 weeks, Jim will spend 24 hours watching TV and 12 hours reading, for a total of 36 hours."

"Response:  Judy makes $750.00 per week.

Explanation:
Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day during the week, which means she teaches a total of 25 classes (5 x 5 = 25) throughout the week. Each class costs $15.00, so the total amount of money Judy earns from teaching classes during the week is:

25 classes x $15.00 per class = $375.00 per week

On Saturdays, Judy teaches 8 additional classes, bringing the total number of classes to 33 (8 x 4 = 33). The calculation for the total amount of money Judy earns from teaching classes on Saturdays is similar:

33 classes x $15.00 per class = $505.00 per week

Adding up the amounts earned from both days gives us the total amount of money Judy makes in one week:

$375.00 + $505.00 = $750.00 per week"

Explanation:
Tommy sold 43 brownies at $3 per slice, so he raised $135 from the brownies ($43 x 3 = $135). Similarly, he sold 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice, so he raised an additional $92 from the cheesecakes ($23 x 4 = $92). Therefore, in total, Tommy raised $135 + $92 = $227."
"Response:  Shiela will pay $45 per month for 3 months.
Rozhovor:  Okay, let's see... So Sheila paid $150 for each of the five cell phones, and she'll be paying for them over three months. That means she'll have to pay $150 x 3 = $450 in total. And since there's a 2% interest charge, that's another $9 = $459 in total. So, Sheila will pay $45 per month for three months to own those cell phones."
"Response:  Artie will make $35.60.
Rozhovor:  Okay! Let's see... if Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds for $2.74 each, that means he made $32.88 from those sales ($2.74 x 12 = $32.88). And if he sold 9 pots of petunias for $1.87 each, that means he made $16.53 from those sales ($1.87 x 9 = $16.53). Finally, if he sold 17 pots of begonias for $2.12 each, that means he made $35.24 from those sales ($2.12 x 17 = $35.24). So in total, Artie made $35.60 from his flower sales ($32.88 + $16.53 + $35.24 = $35.60)."
Response:  The average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle is 8. To find this, we can use the fact that the square footage of each level decreases by half from the previous level. So, if the top level has a square footage of 16, then the second level (which is half the size) would have a square footage of 8, and so on. Therefore, the average square footage of all four levels is 8.
Response:  To calculate the number of bags of dog food that Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to know how long the first 180 days are and how much dog food she needs to feed the puppy during this time. Let's assume that the first 180 days are equal to 6 months. Therefore, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 6 x 1 = 6 cups of dog food per month, or 72 cups per year (6 months x 12 cups/month). Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will use 72 / 110 = 6.5 bags of dog food in the first year. So, the answer is 6.5 bags of dog food.
"Response:  If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.
David does 1/4 as much laundry as Sarah, so he does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds."

Pozadavková informácia:  John adopts a dog.  He takes the dog to the groomer, which costs $100.  The groomer offers him a 30% discount for being a new customer.

Myšlenka:  First, we need to calculate the original price of the grooming without the discount. In this case, it is $100. Then, we subtract the discount amount (30%) from the original price to get the final price with the discount. So, the final price of the grooming is $70 ($100 - $30)."

1. First time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. Second time the alarm went off, it rang for 3x longer than the first time = 4 x 3 = 12 times.
3. Third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time = 12 / 3 = 4 times.
So, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 4 = 18 times in total."

My reasoning is as follows:

* Out of 200 students, 2/5 = 40 are boys (since there are 2 boys for every 5 students).
* 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, so 2/3 x 100 = 73 girls are in the Girl Scouts.
* Therefore, there are 40 - 73 = 160 girls who are not in the Girl Scouts."

Response:  To find out how many pages Solo needs to read each day, we need to divide the total number of pages he needs to read by the number of days he has left to finish his reading. In this case, Solo needs to read 69 pages (4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 69). Since he already read 15 pages on Monday, he has 54 pages left to read (69 - 15 = 54). Therefore, he needs to read approximately 54/5 = 10.8 pages per day.
Response: 5 x 7 = 35 glasses of water per week.
"Response:  The fog bank will take 420 minutes (or 7 hours) to cover the entire city.

My reasoning:
The distance from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge of the city is 42 miles. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, it will take 42/3 = 14 minutes to cover the first 3 miles. Therefore, it will take 42 x 14 = 588 minutes (or 9.6 hours) to cover the entire city. However, since we are asked for the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide this value by 2, since it covers half the city at a time. So, the answer is 420 minutes or 7 hours."

"Response:  Sasha can make a total profit of $380 if she sells all of her leftover lumber. Here's how we calculate it:

Leftover 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per board = $10
Number of boards = 10
Total cost = $100
Selling price per board =? (based on current market price)
Profit per board = $100 - $10 = $90
Total profit from 2 x 4 lumber = 10 boards x $90 per board = $900

Leftover 4 x 4 lumber:
Cost per board = $16
Number of boards = 5
Total cost = $80
Selling price per board =? (based on current market price)
Profit per board = $80 - $16 = $64
Total profit from 4 x 4 lumber = 5 boards x $64 per board = $320

Total profit from both types of lumber = $900 + $320 = $1,220
So, Sasha makes a total profit of $1,220 by selling all of her leftover lumber."

Rozhodnutie:  Right! According to the information given in the problem, Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour, which means he needed 75/5 = 15 hours to complete the entire test. Since he had 8 hours to complete the test, he left 75 - 8 = 67 questions incomplete. Similarly, for the second test, he completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour, which means he needed 100/5 = 20 hours to complete the entire test. Since he had 6 hours to complete the test, he left 100 - 6 = 94 questions incomplete."
"Response:  Pink gumballs = 4 x 12 + 22 = 56
Explanation: Let's use the information given in the problem to find out how many pink gumballs there are. We know that there are 22 more pink gumballs than blue gumballs, so if there are 12 blue gumballs, then there are 22 + 12 = 34 pink gumballs. Since we were asked for the number of pink gumballs, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 56."

Response:  If Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day, then he spends a total of 14 hours (2 x 7) on gaming per week. If he works 5 days a week and earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, then he earns a total of $70 ($10 x 7) per week from work. Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn an additional $70 per week.

"Response:  Lucas will make $46 per week in profit.

Explanation:
Lucas's total income for the week is $92 (from all 8 clients). His total expenses are $10 (for 2 bottles of bleach x $2 each + pack of cloths x $5 each). So, his profit is $92 - $10 = $82 per week."
"Response:  John môže teraz (within a year) harvest approximately 3000 pineapples.

Explanation:
John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, which means he has 100 hectares of land for growing pineapples. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, the total number of pineapples that John has is:

100 pineapples/hectare x 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he will be able to harvest them 4 times in a year:

1000 pineapples / 4 harvests per year = 250 pineapples per harvest

Therefore, John can harvest approximately 3000 pineapples within a year."
Response: 2700 blocks (legos).
"Response: 40 bees.
Rozloženie:  Let x = number of bees that left the hive during the first 6 hours. Since half as many bees left during the second 6 hours, let y = number of bees that left during the second 6 hours. We know that twice as many bees left during the second 6 hours as left during the first 6 hours, so y = 2x. Now we want to find out how many bees returned during the last 6 hours of the day. Let z = number of bees that returned during the last 6 hours. We can set up an equation based on what we know about the bees: z + x = total number of bees that returned during the day (including those that didn't return). Substituting x = 30 and y = 15 (since there were half as many bees that left during the second 6 hours), we get: z + 30 = 2(15) = 90. So there were 90 bees that returned to the hive during the last 6 hours of the day."

Response:  Carl receives $9 in change.
"Response: 40

My reasoning:

Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the rest. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries (since 14 / 2 = 7). So, after the seagull ate its share, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.

Then, three pigeons came along and ate 3 fries each, so there were 7 - 9 = 8 fries left.

Later, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is equal to 6 fries (since 2/3 \* 8 = 6). So, there were 8 - 6 = 2 fries left.

Finally, an ant carried off the last french fry, leaving none.

Therefore, when Dave bought the pack of french fries, there were 40 fries in total (40 = 14 + 7 + 8 + 2)."
Response:  Kimo attend classes for a total of 3 x 4 = 12 hours per week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. He attends 2 x 4 = 8 hours per week on Tuesday and Thursday. Therefore, in one semester, Kimo spends a total of 12 + 8 = 20 hours attending classes.
"Response:  Bill's baked goods would be 780 feet long if he put them end to end. This calculation can be made by multiplying the number of rolls (300), chocolate croissants (120) and baguettes (60) by their respective lengths (in inches): 4 inches x 300 = 1200 inches for rolls; 6 inches x 120 = 720 inches for chocolate croissants; and 2 feet x 60 = 1200 inches for baguettes. Then, adding up these amounts gives us a total length of 1200 + 720 + 1200 = 780 feet."

"Response: 48 fish.
Rozhovor s učitelem:  Učitel: Hello, how did you do on that math problem? Student: I got 48 fish. Učitel: That's correct! Good job. Can you explain how you arrived at that answer? Student: Sure. So, Anakin caught 10 starfish, which is 10 x 1 = 10 fish. Then he caught 6 sea horses, which is 6 x 1 = 6 fish. And he caught 3 clownfish, which is 3 x 1 = 3 fish. Total number of fish he caught is 10 + 6 + 3 = 29 fish. But Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 5 x -5 = -25 starfish. He also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 3 x -3 = -9 sea horses. And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 2 x 2 = 4 clownfish. Therefore, total number of fish Locsin caught is -25 + -9 + 4 = -18 fish. Since Anakin caught 29 fish and Locsin caught -18 fish, the total number of fish they caught together is 29 - 18 = 11 fish."

"Response:  Jackie would have more money by hiring the accountant.

Reasoning:
If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income due to the time she spends on tax preparation. Since she works as a freelancer and earns $35/hour, this means that she misses out on $35 x 3 = $105 worth of income.
On the other hand, if she hires an accountant, she won't have to spend any time on tax preparation, so she can use that time for other things (e.g., working on freelance projects). This means that she gains $35/hour x 3 = $105 worth of income by hiring an accountant.
Therefore, hiring an accountant results in a net gain of $105 - $105 = $0, which is equal to zero dollars."

Response:  Billy will need approximately 1 hour and 2 minutes (60 potatoes x (1 min + 5 sec/potato)) to prep all the potatoes.
Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. So, the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade is: $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon. Since they sold 20 glasses per gallon and made a profit of $25, we can calculate their profit per gallon as follows: Profit per gallon = Total revenue - Total cost = $0.50 x 20 glasses/gallon - $5/gallon = $10/gallon Now, since they made a profit of $25, we know that their total revenue was at least $25 / $10 per gallon = 2 gallons. Therefore, they spent $10 on lemons (since $10 is the amount of money they earned in profit per gallon).

"Response: 15 sekund.

My reasoning:
The first team's total time for all four legs would be 2 x 55 = 110 seconds.
The second team's total time for all four legs would be 4 x (60 + 3) = 280 seconds.
Therefore, the difference between the two teams' times is 170 - 110 = 60 seconds."
"Response: 40%

My reasoning:
Let's define the event ""Jerry rolls a number greater than 3"" as E1, and the event ""Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row"" as E2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 can be calculated using the formula for the sum of probabilities of mutually exclusive events:
P(E1) = P(rolling a number greater than 3) = 6/6 = 1

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
We know that the first number rolled must be even, so there are 3 even numbers to choose from (2, 4, 6). The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is therefore:
P(rolling an even number on the second roll | rolling an even number on the first roll) = 3/6 = 1/2
So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
P(E2) = P(rolling an even number on the second roll | rolling an even number on the first roll) \* P(rolling an even number on the first roll) = 1/2 \* 3/6 = 1/4

Now we want to find out how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. We can do this by subtracting the probability of the less likely event (E2) from the probability of the more likely event (E1):
Percentage difference = P(E1) - P(E2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 = 75%

Therefore, it is 75% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

"Response: 15 bags

Poznámka:  In this problem, we are given three pieces of information: the cost of one bag of wheat ($20), the cost of transporting one bag from the farm to the warehouse ($2), and the total profit made by the trader after selling all the bags ($400). We can use these values to set up an equation that will help us solve for the number of bags sold. Let's start by using the first two pieces of information to find the total cost of transportation:

Total cost of transportation = Number of bags x Cost of transporting one bag
= 15 bags x $2
= $30

Now, let's use the third piece of information to find the total profit made by the trader:

Total profit = Number of bags x Selling price per bag + Total cost of transportation
= 15 bags x $30 + $30
= $450

Since the trader made a total profit of $450, we know that the number of bags sold must be equal to $450 divided by the selling price per bag:

Number of bags = $450 / $30
= 15 bags

Therefore, the trader bought 15 bags of wheat from the farmer and sold them at a rate of $30 per bag, making a total profit of $450."

My reasoning is as follows:

On Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.
On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos (which is equal to 6), so now there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
Then, on Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos, so now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.
At noon on Sunday, there are 30 - 9 = 21 pink plastic flamingos more than white plastic flamingos."

"Response:  Elaine has 80 Pokémon cards in total.

Explanation:
In the first month, Elaine collected 3 × 20 = 60 Pokémon cards.
In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first two months, which is 40 + 60 = 100 cards. Therefore, Elaine has 100 + 60 = 160 Pokémon cards in total."

Response:  Baldur gets 25 liters of water every day (5 liters x 5 pails in the morning + 6 liters x 6 pails in the afternoon).
"Response:  John made $104,000 that year.

My reasoning:

* First, we need to calculate the total amount of money John received from the award. Since it's a one-time award with a monetary reward of $5000, he will receive this amount once. So, the total amount of money he received is $5000.
* Next, we need to calculate the percentage increase in his salary due to the award. Since the award includes a 5% raise in salary, the new salary will be 5% higher than the original salary. Let's assume John's original salary was $2000 per week, so his new salary after receiving the award will be $2100 per week (($2000 x 1.05) = $2100).
* Now, let's calculate the total amount of money John earned that year. Since he worked 52 weeks in a year (assuming a Monday-Friday workweek), he earned $104,000 ($2100 per week x 52 weeks).

Therefore, John made $104,000 that year."

"Response:  Carl used 24 slices of cheese during the week.

Explanation:
Carl ate a sandwich with 2 slices of cheese every day, so he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for his sandwiches. Additionally, he had 3 cheese and egg omelets, which require 1 + 1 = 2 extra slices of cheese compared to his sandwiches. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for breakfast was 14 + 2 = 16 slices. For dinner, he made a dish of macaroni and cheese that required 8 slices of cheese. So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used during the week was 16 + 8 = 24 slices."

"Response: 10 red chickens.
Rozhovor:  Okay! Let's see... if Jerry collects 42 eggs every day and there are 3 red chickens producing 3 eggs per day, then the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3 x 42 = 126 eggs per day. And if there are 5 white chickens producing 5 eggs per day, then the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5 x 42 = 210 eggs per day. So, if Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, that means he has 2 + 2 = 4 more white chickens than red chickens. Therefore, Jerry has 10 red chickens."

"Response:  $937.48
Rozhodnutie:  The remaining balance after 12 months will be $937.48. To calculate this, we need to use the formula:
Remaining Balance = Initial Amount x (1 - Monthly Payment / Total Amount)
In this case, the initial amount was $2000, the monthly payment is $165, and the total amount is $2000 + ($2000 x 10%) = $2300. Plugging in these values into the formula gives us:
Remaining Balance = $2000 x (1 - $165/$2300) = $937.48
Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $937.48."

Andrew plans a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester, which is approximately 300 miles away. If it takes 6 days to travel by bus and half as many days to travel by car, then the time it takes to travel by bus is 300/2 = 150 miles per day. Since the distance between New Jersey and Rochester is 300 miles, it will take 300/150 = 2 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. To return from Rochester by car, it will take half as long, or 1 day. Therefore, Andrew will travel for 2 + 1 = 3 days in total."

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so she will complete 4 x 60 = 240 pieces per hour.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, so her rate is 240 / 2 = 120 pieces per hour.
Therefore, it will take them 360 / 120 = 3 hours to complete the puzzle."
"Response: 70

My reasoning is as follows:

* At first, there were 120 baby watermelons on the farm.
* After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, which means 36 (30% x 120) watermelons were ready.
* Two weeks later, when Ashlyn returned, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which means 48 (3/4 x 36) watermelons were ready.
* Therefore, there were 70 watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks (120 - 48 = 70)."
Response:  Mark pays a total of $240,000 for the fleet of 12 cars.

Response:  Ram gets to have 100 pens in total. Here's why: When Ram mixes the ink from five empty pens, he creates one full pen with 5/5 = 1 unit of ink. Since he has 25 pens initially, he can create 25 x 1 = 25 full pens using the ink from those pens. Then, when the ink runs low on each of these 25 full pens, he can use the remaining ink to create another 5 pens (since there are still 5 units of ink left). Therefore, in total, Ram gets to have 25 + 5 = 30 pens.

From the problem, we know that 30% of the students went out through exit A, so the number of students who left through exit A = 30% x 1000 = 300.
Then, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, so the number of students who left through exit B = 3/5 x (1000 - 300) = 600.
Finally, the rest of the students went out through exit C, so the number of students who left through exit C = (1000 - 300 - 600) = 140.
Therefore, the total number of students who went out through exit C is 140."

Response:  By the end of the activity, Dolly and Pandora will have read a total of 3 books between them.
Response:  Mike spends  10 hours per week writing letters to his remaining pen pals. To calculate this, we need to first find out how many letters he receives from the two pen pals he no longer writes to. Let's assume they each send him 4 letters per week (since they used to send 2 letters per week and now they each doubled their number of letters). So, Mike receives 8 letters per week from these two pen pals. Now, let's calculate how much time it takes for Mike to write one letter. Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, it means he can write 6 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, he can write 1/6 of a page in 1 minute. So, it takes him 6 minutes to write one letter. Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends writing letters per week: Number of letters he writes = Total number of letters received / Time it takes to write one letter x Number of weeks in a year To find out the total number of letters he receives, we multiply the number of letters he receives from each pen pal by the number of weeks they were pen pals together. For example, if he received 4 letters per week from Pen Pal A and they were pen pals for 3 months, then he received 4 x 3 = 12 letters from Pen Pal A. Similarly, he received 4 x 4 = 16 letters from Pen Pal B. So, the total number of letters he receives is: 12 + 16 = 28 letters per week. Now, let's calculate the time he spends writing letters per week: Time spent writing letters per week = Total number of letters written / Number of hours he can write per day x Number of days in a week To find out the number of hours he can write per day, we divide the number of pages he can write per hour by the number of minutes he can write a page. Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, it means he can write 6 pages per hour. Therefore, he can write 6 / 60 = 0.1 hours per minute. So, he can write 0.1 hours per minute. Now, let's calculate the time he spends writing letters per week: Time spent writing letters per week = 28 letters / 0.

My reasoning:
Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find out how many fries Kyle took:

Kyle took 5 of Griffin's fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Now let's use the next piece of information to find out how many fries Billy took:

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 × 5 = 10 fries.

So now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Next, we are told that Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries:

A ""handful"" is usually considered to be about 5-6 fries, so Ginger gave Griffin 5 - 6 = 1-2 fries.

Finally, we are told that Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle took:

Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle, who took 5 fries, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

So now Griffin has 9 + 1 + 2 = 12 fries left.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries (9 + 1 + 2)."
