Response:  First, we know that Janet lays 16 eggs per day and sells them for $2 each at the farmer's market. So, she sells 16 x $2 = 32 eggs per day. Since she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning, she has 32 - 3 = 29 eggs left to sell. Therefore, her daily income from selling eggs at the farmer's market is 29 x $2 = $58.
Response:  Firstly, we need to determine how many blue stripes are required for the overall design of the hijab. We know that there should be two blue stripes and half as many white stripes. So, if we have two blue stripes, we will need half as many white stripes, which is equal to one white strip. Therefore, the total number of shrafs (stripes) required for the hijab is: 2 blue stripes + 1 white strip = 3 shrafs.
"Response:  First, we know that JOSH bought the house for $80,000. Then he spent $50,000 on repairs and improvements, so the total amount invested in the house is: 

$80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs and improvements) = $130,000  Next, we are told that the value of the house increased by 150% after the renovations. So, if the original purchase price was $80,000, the new value of the house would be: 

$80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000 Therefore, Josh made a profit of: 

$120,000 - $130,000 = $10,000 or 7.69% return on investment."
Response:  First, we know that James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, for a total of 180 meters per day (3 x 60). Since he does this 3 times a week, his weekly total is 540 meters (180 x 3).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Wendy gives her chickens three meals a day and each meal contains a mix of seeds, worms, and vegetables to keep them healthy. In the morning, she gives her flock of 20 chickens 15 shells of food. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 shells of food. So, in total, Wendy gives her chickens 40 shells of food per day (15 + 25). Now, let's calculate how many shells of food Wendy should give to her chickens in the last feeding of the day if she has a flock of 20 chickens. To do this, we can simply divide the total number of shells of food given per day (40) by the number of chickens in the flock (20): 40 / 20 = 2 Therefore, Wendy should give her chickens 2 more shells of food in the last feeding of the day.
Response:  First, we know that each regular cup costs $5, so if Kylar buys 16 cups, he will pay:  16 x $5 = $80  Now, let's consider the discounted cups. We know that each one costs 60% of the regular price, so the cost of each discounted cup is:  60% x $5 = $3  Since Kylar wants to buy 16 cups in total, he will pay for the discounted cups:  16 x $3 = $48  Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay is:  $80 + $48 = $128
Response:  First, we know that Tuluza has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So if Charleston has 4 times more sheep than Seattle, then Tuluza has 8 times more sheep than Seattle.  Now, let's find out how many sheep each city has:  For Seattle: 20 sheep  For Charleston: 4 x 20 = 80 sheep  For Tuluza: 2 x 80 = 160 sheep  Therefore, together they have: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download 2 GB of data per minute. Secondly, we know that 40% of the time is spent on installing updates, which takes 20 minutes. Therefore, to calculate how much time is spent downloading the file, we need to subtract the time spent on updating from the total time taken for the download. In this case, the total time taken for the download would be: 

Time = (2 GB / min) x (100 - 40%) x (download size in MB) / (8 x 1024)

where ""download size in MB"" is the size of the file being downloaded, which is given as 200 GB or 200,000 MB. Substituting values, we get: 

Time = (2 GB / min) x (100 - 40%) x (200,000 MB) / (8 x 1024)

Simplifying and calculating, we get: 

Time = 200,000 MB / (8 x 1024) x (100 - 40%)

Time = 25,000 minutes

Therefore, it will take approximately 25,000 minutes or about 416 hours to download the entire file. To convert this to days, we divide by 24: 

Days = 416 h / 24 h/day

Days = 17 days

So, it will take approximately 17 days to download the entire file if Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute and there are 40% system updates."
"Response:  First, we know that John drives at a constant speed of 100 km/h for 3 hours (or 3 x 60 = 180 minutes). Then he spends the next 2 hours in traffic (at an average speed of 30 miles per hour), which is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Finally, he drives at a constant speed of 80 miles per hour for the remaining 40 minutes (since he has 40 minutes left until he reaches his destination). Therefore, the total distance traveled by John can be calculated as follows: Total Distance = Speed x Time + Speed x Time +... + Speed x Time Where ""Speed"" represents the speed at which John travels during each time interval, and ""Time"" represents the length of each time interval. In this case, the speeds are: Speed = 100 km/h (for first 3 hours) Speed = 30 miles/hour (for second 2 hours) Speed = 80 miles/hour (for last 40 minutes) And the times are: Time = 3 hours (first period) Time = 2 hours (second period) Time = 40 minutes (last period) Now let's substitute these values into our formula: Total Distance = 100 km/h x 3 hours + 30 miles/hour x 2 hours + 80 miles/hour x 40 minutes We can simplify this expression by converting all distances to kilometers: Total Distance = 300 km + 60 miles + 32 km Since 1 mile is equal to 1.60934 kilometers, we have: Total Distance = 300 km + 60 miles x 1.60934 km/mile + 32 km Total Distance = 300 km + 96.57 km + 32 km Total Distance = 428.57 km So, after driving for 4 hours, John will be approximately 428.57 kilometers away from home."
Response:  First, we know that Eliza was paid $10 per hour for her regular hours worked (the first 40 hours). So, she earned:  40 hours x $10/hour = $400  Next, we know that Eliza received overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular rate for the additional 5 hours she worked beyond 40 hours. So, she earned:  5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 = $60  Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week were:  $400 + $60 = $460
"Response:  First month had 60 downloads, second month had three times as many downloads as first month (so 180), and third month had 30% less downloads than second month (so 129). So we have:  
60 + 180 + 129 = 479 downloads in three months."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much each type of pastry cost per unit.  For the croissants, it was $68/10 = $6.80 per unit.  For the mini kolaches, it was $80/10 = $8 per unit.  And for the mini sir kolaches, it was $55/6 = $9.17 per unit.  Now let's add up all the costs:  Croissants: 3 x $6.80 = $20.40 Mini kolaches: 2 x $8 = $16 Minisir kolaches: 6 x $9.17 = $55.02 Total cost: $20.40 + $16 + $55.02 = $91.42
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend each year on planting and maintaining the lemon tree.  We know that he spends $3 per year for irrigation and fertilization. So, the total cost of maintaining the tree is: Total Cost = $3 + $90 (price of the tree) = $93 per year. Now, let's calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to break even. Break-even point = Total Cost / Annual Revenue Break-even Point = $93 / ($1.5 x 7) = 4 years After four years, Carlos will start making a profit from his lemon tree. Therefore, the answer is 4 years.
Response:  First, we know that Melanie sold one-third of the vacuum cleaners in the green house, so she had 5 - 1/3 = 4 left.  Next, she sold two more in the red house, leaving her with 4 - 2 = 2. Finally, she sold half of what was left in the purple house, which is half of 2, or 1. So, Melanie started with 5 vacuum cleaners and ended up selling 1 + 2 + 0 = 3.
Response:  We know that there are 20 students in the class and 20% of them have enrolled in modern dance (which is 4 students).  Additionally, we know that 25% of the remaining students have enrolled in jazz dance (which is 5 students), leaving us with 11 students who have not yet been accounted for.  Since these 11 students must be enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can conclude that 11/20 or approximately 55% of the total number of students have enrolled in hip-hop dance.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the estimated value of each item after the predicted price increase. For the jewelry worth $5,000, the estimated value after a 2.5% price increase would be:  
$5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125  
For the electronics worth $8,000, the estimated value after a 1.2% price increase would be:  
$8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096  
Now that we have the estimated values, let's compare them and find out which option would give us the highest profit if we sell both items at their estimated values. The higher profit would come from selling the item with the higher estimated value. In this case, it is the jewelry with an estimated value of $5,125. Therefore, the profit from selling the jewelry would be:  
Profit = Estimated Value - Purchase Price  
= $5,125 - $5,000 = $125  
The profit from selling the electronics would be:  
Profit = Estimated Value - Purchase Price  
= $8,096 - $8,000 = $96  
Since the profit from selling the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from selling the electronics ($96), it would be more profitable for the merchant to choose the first option (buying the jewelry)."
Response:  First day, both cars travel west for 80 miles. So, the distance traveled by each car is 80 miles. Second day, they travel north for an unknown distance. To find out how far each car has traveled, we need to know the total distance traveled by both cars. Total distance = Distance traveled by Car A + Distance traveled by Car B Since they are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance must be twice the distance traveled by each car. Therefore, Total distance = 2 x 80 miles = 160 miles Now we can calculate the distance traveled by each car. Distance traveled by Car A = Total distance / 2 = 160 miles / 2 = 80 miles Distance traveled by Car B = Total distance / 2 = 160 miles / 2 = 80 miles So, each car has traveled 80 miles on the second day.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much she earns per hour as an instructor and then add up her total annual income from both jobs.  As an instructor, Jill earns $20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week or $36,400/year (based on 50 weeks of work).  As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week or $23,400/year (based on 50 weeks of work).  Total annual income = $36,400 + $23,400 = $59,800/year.
Response:  If Claire eats 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, then she will eat 3 x 7 = 21 eggs in one week. Since we are asked about 4 weeks, she will eat 21 x 4 = 84 eggs in total.
Response:  First, we know that Marisa took one hour to cover the first four miles, so her speed for those four miles was: 4 miles / 1 hour = 4 miles/hour. Now, we need to find out how fast she needs to go to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the remaining distance of 8 miles. We can use the formula d = rt, where d is the total distance traveled (in this case, 8 miles), r is the rate at which she travels (which we want to find out), and t is the time it takes her to travel that distance (which we also want to find out). Since she has already covered 4 miles in one hour, we know that she spent one hour covering those four miles, so the time it will take her to cover the remaining 8 miles is: t = d / r, or t = 8 miles /? To find out what r is, we can rearrange the equation as follows: r = d / t, or r = 8 miles / t. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: r = 8 miles / t. Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving them simultaneously, we get: t = 4 hours and r = 2 miles/hour. Therefore, Marisa needs to maintain a speed of 2 miles per hour to complete the remaining 8 miles in 4 hours.
Response:  First, we know that the orange drink is 2/3 water and 1/3 juice. So if we add 15 liters of pineapple juice (which is also 3/4 water), what will be the ratio of water to juice in the final mixture?  Since the pineapple juice is 3/4 water, the final mixture will have 3/4 x 15 = 12 liters of water.  Now, let's calculate how much juice there will be in the final mixture. The orange drink has 2/3 water, so it contains 2/3 x 10 = 6.7 liters of juice. When we add 15 liters of pineapple juice, the total amount of juice in the final mixture will be 6.7 + 12 = 18.7 liters.  Therefore, the final mixture will contain 18.7 liters of juice out of a total volume of 24 liters.  To find out how much water is left after adding the pineapple juice, we can subtract the amount of juice from the total volume: 24 - 18.7 = 5.3 liters.  So, there are 5.3 liters of water left after adding 15 liters of pineapple juice.
Response:  First, we know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond must be 31 + 6 = 37 years old.  Now, we are told that Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so his son is currently 37 - 23 = 14 years old.  Therefore, 14 years have passed since Raymond's son was born.
Response:  First three clients bought one DVD each, so they purchased 3 DVDs in total. Next two clients bought two DVDs each, so they purchased 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total. Last three clients did not buy any DVDs, so we don't need to count them. In total, Billy sold 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs in the morning.
"Response:  We know that the candle burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So if we want to find out how much it will burn in 5 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00), we need to multiply the rate by the number of hours:  
2 cm/h x 5 h = 10 cm  Therefore, the candle will be 10 cm shorter after burning from 13:00 to 17:00."
Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a 25% discount from its original price. So we can start by finding out what the original price was before the discount. To do this, we can use the following formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)  Substituting the given values, we get:  Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)  Simplifying and solving for the original price, we get:  Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75  Original Price = $26.00  Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.
Response:  First, we know that Marie paid $50 in total.  Second, we know that she bought 5 packs of milk at $3 per pack, so she spent $3 x 5 = $15 on milk. Third, she bought 4 jars of jam at $1.50 per jar, so she spent $1.50 x 4 = $6 on jam. Fourth, she bought some boxes of pizza, but we don't know how many yet. Finally, we can add up all her expenses to find out how much she spent in total: $15 + $6 +... + (x) = $50, where x is the cost of the pizza boxes. Now, let's solve for x. We know that each box of pizza costs $8.50, so we can substitute this into our equation: $15 + $6 +... + (x) = $50. Simplifying and solving for x gives us: 5 + 6 +... + x = 50. Since there are 5 packs of milk and 4 jars of jam, we can write: 5 + 6 + 4 + x = 50. Combining like terms, we get: 15 + 6 + 4 + x = 50. Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us: 6 + 4 + x = 35. Adding 4 to both sides gives us: 6 + x = 39. Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us: x = 33. So Marie bought 33 boxes of pizza.
Response:  First, we know that Misaka bought three pairs of shorts, so she spent $16.5 x 3 = $49.50 on shorts. Next, she bought three pairs of tights, and each pair costs $22.50, so she spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on tights. Finally, she bought three pairs of shoes, and each pair costs $42, so she spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes. In total, Misaka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 on her outfit.
Response:  First, we know that Sintija eats one portion of ice cream every evening.  Second, each box contains 15 portions of ice cream. Third, the price per box is $4. Finally, Sintija buys these boxes for 60 days. So, to calculate how much she will spend on ice cream in total, we need to multiply the number of boxes she buys by the price per box and then multiply that result by the number of days she buys them.  Here's the calculation: Number of boxes = 60 days / 30 days per month (since there are 30 days in May) x 12 months/year = 20 boxes Total cost per box = $4/box Total cost = $4 x 20 boxes = $80 Therefore, Sintija will spend $80 on ice cream over the course of 60 days.
Response:  First, we know that Henry stopped for the first time after 20 miles. Secondly, he stopped again 15 miles before the end of his journey. So if we subtract 15 from 20, we get: 20 - 15 = 5. Therefore, Henry traveled 5 miles between his two stops.
Response:  First, we know that the price of one pair of high socks is $33.  Second, we know that two pairs of high socks cost $5 less than the price of one pair of shoes.  Third, we want to find out how much the shoes cost.  So let's use algebra to solve for x (the cost of the shoes).  We can start with this equation:  2(33) = x + 5  Now simplify the left side of the equation:   66 = x + 5  Subtract 5 from both sides:  61 = x  Therefore, the cost of the shoes is $61.
Response:  We know that Darrel is 7 years older than Allen, so we can start with that information.  If Darrel is 7 years older than Allen, then Allen is... (7) years younger than Darrel.  Now, we are given that their total age together is 162 years.  So, if we add up their ages, we get:  Darrel's age + Allen's age = 162  Since Darrel is 7 years older than Allen, we can write this as:  Darrel's age = Allen's age + 7  Now, we need to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years.  To do this, we can use the fact that Allen is currently (7) years younger than Darrel.  So, if Darrel is currently x years old, then Allen is x - 7 years old.  In 10 years, both of them will be x + 10 and x + 10 - 7 years old, respectively.  Therefore, Allen's age after 10 years will be:  x + 10 - 7 =?  Solving for x, we get:  x + 10 - 7 = 162  Simplifying, we get:  x = 85  Therefore, Allen will be 85 years old in 10 years.
Response:  First, we know that there are 80 jelly beans in the jar according to one of Gunther's friends. Next, another friend says that there are 20 more than half of the first amount, which means there are 20 + (half of 80) = 20 + 40 = 60 jelly beans. Finally, a third friend says that there are 25% more than the first amount, which is 1.25 x 80 = 100 jelly beans. So, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 jelly beans. Therefore, the average or mean number of jelly beans in the jar is 240 / 3 = 80 jelly beans per jar.
"Response:  Jon has 10 dogs and each dog needs half an hour of walking and care every day. So, in one week, Jon spends:  

10 dogs x 1/2 hour per day = 5 hours per day (walking and caring for dogs)  

Since there are 7 days in a week, Jon spends a total of:  

5 hours per day x 7 days = 35 hours per week (brushing and caring for dogs)"
Response:  First, we know that Gretchen has 110 novčića (coins). Second, we are told that she has 30 more zlatniki than srebrniki. So let's call the number of srebrniki x. Then, Gretchen has 30 + x zlatniki. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:  110 = x + 30 We can simplify this equation by subtracting 30 from both sides:  80 = x Now we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:  40 = x Therefore, Gretchen has 40 srebrniki and 30 + 40 = 70 zlatniki.
Response:  We know that Aaron has five more than half of Raymond's dragulja. So if Raymond has 40 dragulja, then Aaron has 5 + (1/2) \* 40 = 5 + 20 = 25 dragulja. Now we are told that Siobhan has two fewer than Aaron's number of dragulja. Therefore, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 dragulja.
Response:  First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than in the first 20 minutes. So, if he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, he scored (4 x 1.25) = 5 points in the next 20 minutes. Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is: 4 + 5 = 9 points.
Response:  If Terry consumes two yogurts per day and each costs $5, then he spends $10 per day on yogurt. Since there are 30 days in a month, Terry spends $10 x 30 = $300 on yogurt for the entire month.
Response:  First, we know that John has $5 left after buying video games. So he spent $20 \times 8 = 160 dollars on video games. Now let's calculate how much money John had before buying video games. He sold his Lego sets for $15 per piece, and he had 13 pieces in total. Therefore, he made $15 \times 13 = 195 dollars from selling Lego sets. In total, John had $195 + $160 = 355 dollars before buying video games. Since he only spent $160 on video games, he still has $355 - $160 = 195 dollars left. Finally, John has 195 / 15 = 13 Lego sets left.
Response:  First, we know that John runs for three days a week, so he has four days off.  Second, we know that John runs for 3 hours on the first day and half as much (i.e., 3/2 = 1.5 hours) on the next two days.  So, in total, John runs for:  3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours per week.  Now, let's convert this to kilometers per hour:  6 hours / 4 days = 1.5 kilometers per hour.  Therefore, John runs at a speed of approximately 1.5 kilometers per hour.
"Response:  First, we know that Dana can run at a speed of 4 times her walking speed. So if she walks at a speed of x miles per hour, she can run at a speed of 4x miles per hour.  Now, we are given that Dana can jump at a speed of 3 miles per hour. So if she jumps for 2/3 of the time and runs for 1/3 of the time, what is the total distance she can cover in 6 hours?  We know that Dana can run for 1/3 of the time, so she will cover a distance of:  

Distance = Speed x Time  
Distance = (4x) x (1/3)  
Distance = 4x/3  
Since Dana can walk at a speed of x miles per hour, we have:  

Distance = x x (2/3) + 4x/3  
Distance = 2x/3 + 4x/3  
Distance = 6x/3  
Now, we need to find out how far Dana can go in 6 hours if she spends 2/3 of the time jumping and 1/3 of the time running. To do this, we set up an equation based on the information given:  

Let x be Dana's walking speed (in miles per hour).  
Dana can jump for 2/3 of the time, so she covers a distance of:  

Distance = 2x/3 (in miles per hour) x (time spent jumping)  
Distance = 2x/3 x (2/3) of 6 hours  
Distance = 2x/3 x 4 hours  
Distance = 8x/9 (in miles)  
Dana can also run for 1/3 of the time, so she covers a distance of:  

Distance = 4x/3 (in miles per hour) x (time spent running)  
Distance = 4x/3 x (1/3) of 6 hours  
Distance = 4x/3 x 2 hours  
Distance = 8x/3 (in miles)  
Therefore, the total distance Dana can cover in 6 hours is:  

Total"
Response:  First, we know that Ben's iPhone is two years older than Susan's iPhone. So if Susan's iPhone is one year old, then Ben's iPhone is three years old (2 + 1 = 3).  Next, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four years older than Ben's iPhone. So if Ben's iPhone is three years old, then Brandon's iPhone is seven years old (3 + 4 = 7).  Therefore, if Susan's iPhone is one year old, then Brandon's iPhone is seven years old.
Response:  First, we know that without the sapphire, Polly can throw the golden spear 400 feet (120 meters) to reach the dragon's flames.  Second, with the sapphire, she can throw it three times farther than usual, which means she can throw it 1200 feet (365 meters) to reach the dragon's flames.  Now let's calculate how far from the dragon's flames Polly needs to stand in order to hit him with the golden spear while holding the sapphire:  We know that the distance between her and the dragon is 300 meters when she doesn't hold the sapphire.  With the sapphire, she can throw the spear three times as far, so she needs to be only one-third of the original distance away from the dragon, which is 100 meters (328 feet).  So, if Polly holds the sapphire, she can stand at least 100 meters away from the dragon and still hit him with the golden spear.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were five apples in total and each apple was cut into eight pieces. So, the total number of pieces of apple was 5 x 8 = 40 pieces.  Now, we are told that Baka Djons put out five pies on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves. Since each pie contained 8 pieces of apple, this means that she put out 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple on the buffet table.  Finally, we are given that after the guests had eaten their fill, there were 14 remaining pieces of apple left over. This means that if we subtract the number of pieces left over (14) from the total number of pieces served (40), we can find out how many pieces were taken by the guests:  40 - 14 = 26  Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of apple with them.
"Response:  First, we know that one serving of chips has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in the bag (since it says ""5 porcji"" on the label). So, if we multiply 250 calories per serving by 5 servings, we get a total of 1250 calories for the entire bag. Now, since you have already consumed 1800 calories today, we need to subtract the number of calories from the bag of chips from your daily calorie goal. In this case, we would subtract 1250 calories from 2000 calories to find out how many more calories you can consume before reaching your daily limit. Doing so gives us: 2000 - 1250 = 750 calories left to consume. Therefore, you could eat up to 750 additional calories before reaching your daily calorie goal."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Charlie will make if he sells all 20 candles at $2 each.  We know that each candle costs $1 and takes 10 sticks of wax, so:  

20 candles x $2 per candle = $40 total revenue  Now let's subtract the cost of materials:  

$40 total revenue - $10 (for 20 sticks of wax) = $30 profit  So Charlie would have a net profit of $30 if he sold all 20 candles for $2 each."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours she spent writing each day of the week. Then we can add up those numbers to get the total number of hours for the three days.  Monday: She wrote 5 blog posts, and it takes her 4 hours to write one post, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing on Monday. Tuesday: She wrote 2 more posts than on Monday (2/5 more), and it still takes her 4 hours to write one post, so she spent 2/5 x 4 = 8 hours writing on Tuesday. Wednesday: She wrote twice as much as on Tuesday (duplo više), and it still takes her 4 hours to write one post, so she spent 2 x 4 = 8 hours writing on Wednesday. Now let's add up the hours: 20 + 8 + 8 = 56 hours. So Meredith spent 56 hours writing blog posts over the course of three days.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Candice had 80 Post-It notes in her bag before she went to work. Secondly, we know that she used one Post-It note for each of the 220 different types of coffee cups at the cafe where she worked. Finally, we are told that she had 23 Post-It notes left over after using them all. So let's start with the number of Post-It notes she had before going to work:  
80 Now, let's subtract the number of Post-It notes she used:  
80 - 220 = -140 (since she used 220 Post-It notes) Now, let's add the number of Post-It notes she had left over:  
-140 + 23 = 23 The answer is 23."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jon buys double the amount of red crawfish than blue ones. Secondly, we know that the price of red crawfish is 50% higher than blue ones. Finally, we are given that Jon spent $200 on blue crawfish which costs $40 per piece. So, let's start by finding out how much Jon spent on blue crawfish:  
$200 / $40 per piece = 5 pieces of blue crawfish  Now, since Jon buys double the amount of red crawfish, he will buy 10 pieces of red crawfish:  
10 pieces of red crawfish x $60 per piece (since each piece costs $40 more than the blue crawfish) = $600  Therefore, Jon has spent a total of $600 on both blue and red crawfish."
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a piece of wire (žica) to support the paradise plants in her garden. The length of the wire was 4 meters long and she cut it into pieces of equal length. Since each piece is 15 cm long, we can calculate how many pieces she got using division.  
Number of pieces = Length of wire / Length of each piece Number of pieces = 4 m / 0.15 m Number of pieces = 26 pieces So, Tracy got 26 pieces of wire, each 15 cm long, to support her paradise plants."
Response:  First, we know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is:  15 x 8 = 120  Next, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that only 3/4 of the total number of units are available for rent. Therefore, the number of vacant units can be calculated as follows:  120 x (3/4) = 90  So, there are 90 vacant units in the building.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many eggs Lloyd sells in one week: 252 eggs per day x 7 days = 1,764 eggs per week. Next, we multiply that number by the price of each egg: 1,764 eggs x $2 per egg = $3,528 per week. So, Lloyd earns $3,528 per week from his chickens' eggs.
Response:  First, we know that Tomov brod can travel 10 miles per hour. So if he travels from 1 to 4 pm (which is 3 hours), then he will cover a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 10 mi/h x 3 h = 30 miles Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to return at a speed of 6 km/h. We know that there are 1.609 kilometers in a mile, so: Distance = 30 miles x (1.609 km/mile) = 48.27 km To find out how long it takes him to return, we divide the distance by his speed: Time = Distance / Speed = 48.27 km / 6 km/h = 8.05 hours Therefore, Tomov brod needs 8 hours and 5 minutes to return.
Response:  First, we know that the weight of each strip is 1 kg, so if he removes 30 strips, he will have removed a total of 30 kg. Since his book bag can only hold up to 5 kg, he needs to remove enough items to bring the total weight down to 5 kg or less.  Now let's consider the weight of the igračke (toys). Each toy weighs 1 kg, so if he has x toys, the total weight of the toys is also 1 kg x x = 1 kg.  To find out how many toys he needs to remove in order to bring the total weight down to 5 kg, we need to subtract the weight of the strips from the total weight of the bag and the toys. In this case, we would subtract 30 kg - 1 kg x x = 30 kg - x kg.  Solving for x, we get:  x = 20  Therefore, he needs to remove 20 toys in addition to the 30 strips in order to bring the total weight down to 5 kg or less.
Response:  First, we know that for each tire of the truck repaired, the mechanic will charge $ 60, and for each car tire repaired, the mechanic will charge $ 40. So if the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires on Thursday, he will earn:  6 x $ 60 = $ 360 + 4 x $ 40 = $ 160 = $ 520. On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 cars but does not repair any truck tires, so he will only earn:  12 x $ 40 = $ 480. Therefore, the mechanic earned more on Thursday with a higher income of $ 520 than on Friday with an income of $ 480.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each of the two mothers (Patchy and Trixie) had more than three and twelve usadopted kittens respectively. Since they are both referred to as ""mačići"" in the text, it is likely that these numbers represent the total number of kittens adopted by both mothers combined. Therefore, the total number of kittens adopted by the family is: 3 + 12 = 15.  So, the family currently has 15 mačića."
Response:  First, we know that Jean has 30 lollipops and wants to pack 2 in each box. So, he needs to make boxes until all the lollipops are used up.  To find out how many boxes Jean can make, let's divide the total number of lollipops (30) by the number of lollipops per box (2): 30 / 2 = 15  Therefore, Jean can make 15 boxes with 2 lollipops each.
Response:  First, we know that Peter has $42 for the week and he spends $7 each time he goes to the movies (for the ticket). So, if he wants to go to the movies more than once, he needs to have enough money left over after buying his tickets to buy snacks as well ($7 x number of times he goes = total amount spent on snacks).  Now let's calculate how many times Peter can go to the movies based on his budget:  Total amount available for the week: $42  Ticket price per movie: $7  To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, divide the total amount available by the ticket price:  Number of trips to the movies = $42 / $7  Number of trips to the movies = 6  Therefore, Peter can go to the movies six times this week with his current budget.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total weight of the loaded truck with all the boxes filled. We know that each box weighs 5 kg and there will be 28 such boxes (since 28 x 5 = 140). So, the total weight of the loaded truck is: Total weight = Number of boxes x Weight per box  = 28 x 5 kg  = 140 kg Now, let's subtract the weight of the empty truck (1400 kg) from the total weight of the loaded truck to find out how much weight the truck can carry without exceeding the limit: Maximum load = Total weight - Empty weight  = 140 kg - 1400 kg  = 1260 kg Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit is: Maximum number of boxes = Total weight / Weight per box  = 1260 kg / 5 kg  = 252 boxes
Response:  First we need to calculate the total cost of the groceries before any additional fees are added.  The problem states that Stephen ordered groceries online and his final bill was $40. Next, we know that there is an additional fee of 25% of the total cost for delivery, which comes out to be:  25% x $40 = $10 So now we have two amounts: $40 (total cost) + $10 (delivery fee) = $50 Total amount Stephen paid including delivery fee = $50 Now, Stephen also added a $4.00 tip, so we add that to the total: $50 + $4 = $54 Final answer: Stephen paid a total of $54 for his groceries, including the delivery fee and the tip he added.
"Response:  We know that each cluster has 20 fruits and there are 6 clusters in total. So, we can calculate the number of fruits in all clusters as follows:  
6 clusters x 20 fruits per cluster = 120 fruits  
Now, let's add the number of individual fruits to this total:  
120 fruits (from clusters) + 67 individual fruits = 187 fruits  
Therefore, there are 187 fruits in total."
Response:  First, we know that there are 25 oranges in total.  Of those, 1 is bad (loša), so we subtract 1 from the total number of oranges.  That leaves us with 24 oranges. Next, we know that 20% of the oranges are not ripe (nezrela), which means we need to subtract 20% of 24 oranges from the total. In this case, 20% of 24 is 4.8 (since 20% of 100 is 20). So, we subtract 4.8 from the total number of oranges, leaving us with 24 - 4.8 = 19.2. Finally, we know that 2 of the oranges are acidic (kisela), so we subtract 2 more from our total. This gives us a final answer of 19.2 - 2 = 17.2 good oranges.
Response:  First, we know that Janet paid $500 for the material. Then she paid an additional $800 to have it made (zlatar). So far, she has paid a total of $500 + $800 = $1300. Finally, she paid 10% of that amount as insurance, which is $1300 x 10% = $130. Therefore, in total, Janet paid $1300 + $130 = $1430.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the value of Ako's pension after 20 years of service.  Since she has the right to receive 5% of the value of her pension each year, and she has served for 20 years, we can calculate the value of her pension as follows:  Pension value after 20 years = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^20  = $86,797  Now, let's calculate the value of Ako's pension after 30 years of service.  Pension value after 30 years = $86,797 x (1 + 0.05)^10  = $129,624  Therefore, if Ako retires after 30 years of service, her annual pension will be $129,624.
"Response:  First, we know that Aleena paid $140 per month for her streaming service.  If she paid for six months (January to June), then she paid a total of:  
$140 x 6 = $840  Now, if the streaming company reduced her bill by 10% in the second half of the year (July to December), then they charged her:  
$840 x 0.9 = $756 For the entire year, Aleena paid:  
$840 + $756 = $1,596"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sofija has driven 160 km since her last fill-up and she needs to add 4 gallons of gasoline to her tank to refill it completely. Secondly, we are given that her car's fuel tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline. So, if we subtract the amount of gasoline she has already used (160 km / 10 km/gallon = 16 gallons) from the total capacity of her fuel tank (12 gallons), we get the remaining amount of gasoline in her tank after refilling:  
Remaining Gasoline = Total Capacity - Amount Used = 12 gallons - 16 gallons = 0 gallons Therefore, Sofija can drive 0 kilometers with one fill-up of gasoline because she will run out of gas immediately after refilling."
Response:  First, we know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each day (3 times a week). So, in one week, he watches TV for 2 x 3 = 6 hours.  Next, we know that he spends half of his time reading. Since he reads for half of his free time, and he has 10 hours of free time per week (since he works 5 days a week), he reads for 10/2 = 5 hours per week.  Now, let's add up all the time he spends on TV and reading: 6 + 5 = 11 hours.  Therefore, Jim spends 11 hours per week watching TV and reading.
Response:  Firstly, each school has sent one female basketball team and one male basketball team, so we need to calculate how many people are in total for all four schools.  Secondly, each team has five players, so let's multiply the number of teams by the number of players per team. Finally, we add up all these numbers to get the total number of people sent by all four schools.  So, if we have:  4 schools x 2 teams per school (1 female, 1 male) = 8 teams  8 teams x 5 players per team = 40 players Therefore, all four schools together have sent 40 players (20 females and 20 males).
Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds in the chest.  If each diamond weighed less than a ruby, then there must have been at least 35 rubies in the chest (since each ruby weighs more than a diamond).  Since there were twice as many emeralds as rubies, there must have been at least 2 x 35 = 70 emeralds in the chest.  Therefore, the total number of precious stones in the chest was:  175 + 35 + 70 = 280.
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls in total and each teacher has 5 students. So if we divide 60 by 5, we get: 60 / 5 = 12 teachers. Therefore, there are 12 teachers in the school.
"Response:  First, we know that Bailey has $x dollars at the beginning of the period. Then, she receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so her total income is: 

$x + (5 x 8) = $x + 40 

Since Bailey has $100 after 8 weeks, we can set up an equation: 

$x + 40 = 100 

Solving for $x$, we get: 

$x = 60 

So, Bailey had $60 at the beginning of the period."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Judy earns per day.  To do this, we can multiply the number of hours she teaches per day (5) by her hourly rate ($15). This gives us:  
Judy earns $75 per day (5 x $15) Now, let's calculate how much money Judy earns in one week. We know that there are 7 days in a week, so we can simply multiply the amount she earns per day by 7:  
Judy earns $525 per week (7 x $75) Finally, let's calculate how much money Judy earns in one month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we can multiply the amount she earns per week by 4:  
Judy earns $2,100 per month (4 x $525) So, Judy earns $2,100 per month teaching dance classes."
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions, then the second recipe will have 2 x 20 = 40 instructions.  Therefore, in total, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions to prepare both meals.
Response:  First, we know that Tommy sells cookies for $3 each and cheese cookies for $4 each. Next, we are given that Tommy sold 43 regular cookies and 23 cheese cookies. Finally, we want to find out how much money Tommy made in total. So let's calculate first how much he made from each type of cookie: Regular Cookies: 43 x $3 = $130 Cheese Cookies: 23 x $4 = $92 Now add up both amounts to get the total amount of money Tommy made: $130 + $92 = $222
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount that Shila will pay for all five phones over three months.  Total amount = (5 x $150) x 2% = $375 x 2% = $7.50 To find out how much Shila will pay each month, we can divide the total amount by the number of months: Monthly payment = $7.50 / 3 months = $2.50 per month So, Shila will pay $2.50 per month for three months.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Artie will make from each type of flower.  For nalivke, he makes $2.74 per pot. For petunije, he makes $1.87 per pot. And for begonije, he makes $2.12 per pot. Now let's multiply each amount by the number of pots he has of each type: Nalivke: 2.74 x 12 = $33.08 Petunije: 1.87 x 9 = $16.83 Begonije: 2.12 x 17 = $35.54 So, in total, Artie will make $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.54 = $85.45.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each level of the sandcastle will have half a square meter less space than the previous one. So if the topmost level has an area of $16\text{ m}^2$, then the second-from-top level will have $\frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ m}^2$ of space, and so on. Therefore, the total area of all four levels will be: $$A = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ m}^2$$ Since each level has half a square meter less space than the previous one, the average area of each level is: $$A_L = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ m}^2$$
Response:  First, we know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy with 2 bowls of dog food per day for the first 180 days. So, she will use 2 x 180 = 360 bowls of dog food in the first 180 days. Each bowl contains 110 shalics, so she will use 360 x 110 = 39,600 shalics in the first 180 days. After that, she will continue to feed her puppy with 2 bowls of dog food per day until the end of its life, which is assumed to be around 15 years. Therefore, she will use 2 x 365 (days in a year) x 15 = 18,900 bowls of dog food in total. Since each bowl contains 110 shalics, she will use a total of 18,900 x 110 = 2,079,000 shalics of dog food throughout the life of her puppy.
"Response:  First, we know that Sara earns four times as much as David, so if David earns x funti rublja, Sara earns 4x funti rublja.  Second, we know that Raymond earns more than David, so if David earns x funti rublja, Raymond earns more than x funti rublja.  Finally, we are told that Sara spends 400 funti rublja.  So, to find out how much money Raymond and David have after Sara spends her money, we need to subtract the amount that Sara spends from their total earnings.  Here is the calculation:  
Raymond's earnings = (more than) x funti rublja  Sara's earnings = 4x funti rublja  Total earnings = Raymond's earnings + Sara's earnings = (more than) x funti rublja + 4x funti rublja = (more than) x + 4x = 5x funti rublja  Now, let's subtract the amount that Sara spends from the total earnings:  Total earnings - Sara's spending = 5x funti rublja - 400 funti rublja = 5x - 400 = 3x funti rublja  Therefore, after Sara spends her money, Raymond has 3x funti rublja and David has x funti rublja."
Response:  First, we need to find out how much each package costs per flower.  Package of 3 flowers costs $2.50, so each flower in that packag...
Response:  First, we know that John pays $100 for the dog grooming service. Second, we are told that the groomer offers a 30% discount for new clients. So, if we subtract 30% of $100, we get: $100 - (30% x $100) = $100 - $30 = $70. Therefore, the cost of the dog grooming service with the discount is $70.
Response:  First, we know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 24 / 6 = 4 liters each. So, in total, they received 4 + 4 = 8 liters of water. Now, we are told that one boy received 6 liters of water. Therefore, the amount of water left is: 24 - 8 - 6 = 20 liters.
"Response:  First, we know that Charlie had 10 stickers before he bought any more. So, if he bought 21 stickers at the mall, how many does he have now?  
Charlie has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers in total. Next, we are told that he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so how many does he have left?  
Charlie has 31 - 9 = 22 stickers left. Finally, we are told that he used 28 stickers for decorating his birthday card, so how many does he have left after using them all up?  
Charlie has 22 - 28 = 4 stickers left. Therefore, Charlie has 4 stickers left after celebrating his birthday."
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds or 56.7 kg (since there are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram).  Now, we know that Alex weighs 2 times more than Grace, so Alex weighs 2 x 56.7 = 113.4 pounds or 51.5 kg.  Therefore, their combined weight is 56.7 + 51.5 = 108.2 kg.
Response:  First, we know that Dan has planted three rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses, so he has planted a total of 3 x 25 = 75 roses.  Next, we know that each rose has 8 thorns, so there are 75 x 8 = 600 thorns in total.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the football team played 22 matches and won eight more than they lost. So, if they won x matches, they lost x - 8. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x + (x - 8) = 22...(1)  Simplifying the equation:  
2x - 8 = 22...(2)  Solving for x:  
x = 20...(3)  Therefore, the football team won 20 matches and lost 4 matches."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each year of vacation has its own unique block. So if Gene goes on vacation 4 times a year (i.e., every quarter), then there will be 4 blocks in total for each year.  Since Gene is now 34 years old and has been going on vacation since he was 23 years old, we can calculate the number of blocks as follows:  
Number of blocks = Number of years x Number of blocks per year  
= 34 years x 4 blocks/year  
= 136 blocks  
Therefore, Gene has a total of 136 blocks from all his vacations over the years."
Response:  First time it rang, it rang for four times (4). Second time it rang, it rang three times longer than the first time, so it rang for:  3 x 4 = 12 times. Third time it rang, it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang for:  12 / 2 = 6 times. Therefore, the alarm rang a total of:  4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.
Response:  First, we know that Sylvie has been working for the company for five years as of December last year. Therefore, her current annual salary is $600 x 12 = $7,200 per year. Next, we know that the company increases salaries by 10% each year for employees who have remained with the company for at least five years. So, after one year, Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% of $7,200, which is $720. Her new annual salary would be $7,200 + $720 = $8,920. Now, let's calculate her salary three years from now. Three years later, in December of this year, Sylvie's salary will have increased by another 10% of $8,920, which is $892. So, her new annual salary will be $8,920 + $892 = $9,812. 
Response:  We know that Marilynina first plate has been sold 10 times more than Harald's. So if Marilynina first plate has been sold x times, then Harald's first plate has been sold 10x times.  Since they have sold together 88,000 copies, we can set up the equation:  x + 10x = 88,000  Simplifying the equation:  11x = 88,000  Dividing both sides by 11:  x = 8,000  Therefore, Harald has sold 8,000 copies of his first plate.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Christina needs to buy 75 gift bags for her birthday party because one-fourth of the invited guests will not show up. Secondly, each gift bag costs $2. Therefore, the total amount Christina will spend on gift bags is:  75 x $2 = $150
Response:  First we need to calculate how much food each adult and child will eat. Then we can add up all these amounts to find out how much food in total Ted needs to bring.  Adult dinosaurs eat 10 kg of coleslaw per person, so for 20 adults that's 20 x 10 = 200 kg of coleslaw. Children eat half as much as adults, so 5 children will eat 5 x 5 = 25 kg of coleslaw. Total amount of coleslaw needed for both adults and children is therefore: 200 + 25 = 225 kg.
Response:  We know that Jan has three pets more than Marsie, so if Marsie has x pets, then Jan has x + 3 pets.  We also know that Marcia has two pets more than Cindy, so if Cindy has y pets, then Marcia has y + 2 pets.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  If Jan has x + 3 pets and Marcia has y + 2 pets, how many pets do they have in total?  To find out, let's add their pet counts together:  x + 3 + (y + 2) =?  Simplifying the equation:  4x + 5 =?  Solve for x:  4x = 5 - 5  4x = 0   x = 0  So Jan and Marcia have a total of 0 pets!  This is clearly not possible, as both Jan and Marcia must have at least one pet each.  Therefore, our initial assumption that Cindy has four pets must be incorrect.  Instead, let's try assuming that Cindy has five pets.  Then Jan would have three more pets than Marsie, making her pet count six (6).  And Marcia would have two more pets than Cindy, making her pet count seven (7).  Based on these new assumptions, here are the updated equations:  Jan has 6 pets and Marcia has 7 pets.  How many pets do they have in total?  To find out, let's add their pet counts together:  6 + 7 = 13  So Jan and Marcia have a total of thirteen (13) pets.
"Response:  We know that Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey. So we can start with this information to find out how old Amy is.  If Amy is five years older than Jackson, then Amy must be 5 + x years old, where x is some number. Since she is also two years younger than Corey, we can add 2 to our previous equation to get:  
Amy = 5 + x + 2  Now we are given that James is ten years and one year younger than Corey. This means that James is 10 - 1 = 9 years old. But since he is one year younger than Corey, we know that Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.  Therefore, if Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey, and James is nine years old, then we can set up an equation based on these facts:  
Jackson = Amy - 5  Jackson = (5 + x + 2) - 5  Jackson = 5 + x - 5  Jackson = x + 2  Since we want to find out how old Jackson is, we need to solve for x in the above equation. To do so, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:  
x + 2 = x + 2 - 2  x + 2 = x  x = 2  Therefore, Jackson is two years older than Amy.  So, Jackson is 5 + 2 = 7 years old."
"Response:  First, we know that Lee can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds. Secondly, we are told that Gerald has improved his diet and increased his speed by 10%. So if Lee takes 38 seconds to run 400 meters with obstacles, then Gerald will take:  

$$ \text{Gerald's time} = \text{Lee's time} \times \frac{\text{Gerald's new speed}}{\text{Lee's old speed}} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \text{Gerald's time} = 38\text{ seconds} \times \frac{1.10}{1} $$

Simplifying, we have:

$$ \text{Gerald's time} = 38\text{ seconds} \times 1.10 $$

$$ \text{Gerald's time} = 41.8\text{ seconds} $$

So Gerald, with his improved diet and increased speed, can run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 41.8 seconds."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 times fewer hamsters than total dogs and cats. So if there are x dogs and y cats in the household, there will be 12x fewer hamsters.  Secondly, for every dog, there are two cats. Therefore, the number of cats is twice the number of dogs.  Finally, we know that there are 60 dogs in the household.  Putting all this information together, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:  
Let x be the number of dogs and y be the number of cats. Then, the number of hamsters is 12x fewer than the number of dogs, so the number of hamsters is:  
Now we have enough information to solve for x and y. We know that the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and hamsters must equal the total number of llubimacas in the household, which is given as 84.  Substituting the equations we derived above into this total, we get:  
Solving for x and y, we find that:  
Therefore, there are 60 dogs, 30 cats, and 72 hamsters in the household, for a total of 84 llubimacas."
Response:  We know that there are 200 students in total and 2/5 of them are boys (i.e., 2 x 5 = 10). So, the number of girls is: 200 - 10 = 190. Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the scouts (i.e., 2 x 3 = 6), so the number of girls not in the scouts is: 190 - 6 = 184. Therefore, there are 184 girls who are not in the scouts.
Response:  First, we know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night.  Second, we know that James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, if Harry slept for 9 hours, then James slept for 9 x 2/3 = 6 hours.  Therefore, Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James did.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each can of concentrated tomato juice contains three tomatoes. Secondly, we are given that Freda used up half of her stock of concentrated tomato juice and lost one-third of its volume during cooking. Therefore, if she had x cans of concentrated tomato juice initially, then she would have used (x/2) cans after reducing the volume by one-third. Finally, since the last batch of sauce contained 32 ounces of liquid, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  32 = (x/2) \* 3 So now solve for x using the above equation:  32 = (x/2) \* 3 Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:  64 = 2x Now dividing both sides by 2 gives us our final solution:  32 = x Thus, Freda used 32 cans of concentrated tomato juice in total.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 30 cars on the highway and 5 cars took an exit to avoid the traffic jam. So, the number of cars that remained on the highway is:  
30 - 5 = 25  Now, we are told that some cars passed through the first 15 minutes of traffic jam, while the remaining cars passed through in the next 15 minutes. Let's assume that x cars passed through during the first 15 minutes, as the traffic was heavy. Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through during the first 15 minutes is:  
x + (25 - x) = x + 25 - x = 45  Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that passed through during the second 15 minutes is:  
45 - 5 = 40  So, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is:  
x + 40 = 45 + 40 = 85  Therefore, the answer is 85."
Response:  First, we know that Mary has 40 prozors in her house and she already has two plants per corridor, so she has 2 x 40 = 80 plants in total.  Yesterday, she received 18 new plants in pots, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants.  Today, she wants to give one plant each to her friends and family, so she will have 98 - 18 = 80 plants left after giving them away.  Therefore, Mary will be left with 80 plants in her possession after today.
Response:  First, we know that the first friend pressed the bell 20 times before Jerry opened it. So, if Jerry had not opened the door, the bell would have rung 20 times.  The second friend pressed the bell 1/4 more than the first friend, so they pressed the bell 5 times (20 x 1/4).  The third friend pressed the bell 10 times more than the second friend, so they pressed the bell 15 times (5 + 10).  Finally, the fourth friend pressed the bell 60 times.  Therefore, in total, the bell rang 95 times (20 + 5 + 15 + 60).
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many pages Solo has left to read in each subject.  For that, we can use the information given in the problem:  - From the scientific textbook, Solo has 4 pages left (20 - 15 = 4).  - From the social studies textbook, Solo has 20 pages left (20 x 3 = 60).  - From the history book, Solo has 7 pages left (7 x 3 = 21).  - From the geography book, Solo has 8 pages left (8 x 3 = 24).  Now, let's add up all these numbers to find out how many pages Solo has left in total: Total pages left = 4 + 60 + 21 + 24 = 109 pages. Since Solo has 4 days left to finish reading, he needs to read an average of 109 / 4 = 27 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, John drinks one glass of water with his breakfast every day (Monday to Friday). Secondly, he drinks one glass of water with his dinner every evening (Monday to Friday). Finally, on weekends, he drinks two glasses of water with his supper and one glass of water before going to bed. Therefore, John drinks a total of: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5 glasses of water per week.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many minutes it would take to cover each 5 kilometers of the city. We know that Magica needs 10 minutes to cover each 5 kilometers. So for one kilometer, she will need 10/5 = 2 minutes. Now let's calculate the total number of minutes needed to cover the entire city. The city is 42 miles long (68 kilometers), so we can multiply the number of minutes per kilometer by the total distance: 2 x 68 = 136 minutes. Therefore, Magica will need 136 minutes to cover the entire city.
Response:  First, Poppy has 1000 pieces of the puzzle and she puts a quarter (250) on the table. That means she has 750 pieces left.  Now, her mother takes a third (250) of the remaining pieces, which is 250 x 3 = 750. So, there are 750 - 750 = 0 pieces of the puzzle left to be placed.  In other words, all the pieces have been used up!
Response:  First, we know that Cody eats three more cookies than Amir. So if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody will eat 3 + 5 = 8 cookies. Therefore, together they will eat 5 + 8 = 13 cookies.
Response:  First we need to find out the volume of one box.  The dimensions are given as 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches.  To calculate the volume of this box, we multiply the length, width and height: Volume = length x width x height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches.  Now let's move on to the second and third boxes.  We can use the same formula to calculate their volumes: Volume of second box = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches Volume of third box = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches Since all three boxes have the same dimensions, they will have the same volume. So, the total volume of all three boxes is: Total volume = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches.
Response:  First, we know that Frankie watched one hour of his favorite show every evening (Monday to Friday). On Tuesday and Thursday, he watched 30 minutes more than usual because he finished his homework early. So, on Tuesday, he watched 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours, and on Thursday, he watched 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours as well.  Now, let's calculate how many episodes of 30 minutes each day: Monday: 1 hour (no extra time) Tuesday: 1.5 hours (extra 30 minutes) Wednesday: 1 hour (no extra time) Thursday: 1.5 hours (extra 30 minutes) Friday: 1 hour (no extra time) Total daily time watching TV: 7 hours Therefore, if Frankie watched 7 hours of TV per day, he watched 7 x 60/120 = 4.5 episodes of 30 minutes each day in srijedu (Wednesday).
Response:  First, we know that Henry made twice as many kolacice last year as he did this year (2x).  Second, we know that he had 15 more kolacice than he intended to make this year (15 + 110 = 125). Finally, we can subtract the number of kolacice he intentionally let cool (5) from the total number of kolacice he made this year (125 - 5 = 120):  Therefore, Henry baked 120 kolacice last year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the local gas station is selling gasoline for $3 per gallon. Secondly, the company offers an application of $20 for each gallon filled at this station. Finally, if someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline, how much money will they have after receiving the reward? To find out, let's calculate the total amount paid for 10 gallons of gasoline:  Total Amount = 10 x $3 = $30 Now, let's subtract the reward amount: Net Amount = $30 - $20 = $10 So, after receiving the reward, the person has $10 left with their gasoline.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many rolls each person got right.  We know that Marcel got 3 rolls and Beatrice got 24 rolls.  So, Marcel got 3/14 of the total number of rolls (3/14 x 100 = 21.4%) and Beatrice got 24/100 of the total number of rolls (24/100 x 100 = 75%).  Now, let's calculate the average number of rolls they both got.  To do this, we add their percentages together and divide by 100.  So, (21.4 + 75) / 100 = 96.4 / 100 = 96.4%.  Therefore, on average, they both got 96.4% of the total number of rolls.
Response:  We know that the boat took 16 seconds to travel 20 meters, so we can calculate its speed as follows: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 20 m / 16 s = 1.25 m/s Now we need to find out how much water was in the boat when it reached the shore. We know that the boat took 2 liters of water for every 10 meters it traveled, so we can calculate the amount of water in the boat as follows: Amount of water = Distance x Water per meter Amount of water = 20 m x 2 L/10 m = 40 L Therefore, there were 40 liters of water in the boat when Julia arrived at the shore.
Response:  We know that there are 4 teachers who share the use of the classroom and each teacher has two lessons per day. This means that in total, there will be 8 lessons per day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/day). Since each teacher uses the blackboard for their lesson, we can assume that the blackboard needs to be cleaned after every lesson. Therefore, the blackboard will need to be cleaned 8 times per day (8 lessons x 1 cleaning/lesson). However, since the blackboard is only cleaned three times per hour, it will actually be cleaned 24 times per day (8 lessons x 3 cleanings/lesson x 2 hours/day). So, the blackboard will be cleaned 24 times per day.
Response:  If Ryan has 2 flowers each day and 5 of them do not grow, then he will have 2 x 15 = 30 flowers that have grown. So, in total, Ryan will have 30 + 5 = 35 flowers after 15 days.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, and Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds on Jamal's photo of the penguin enclosure in the zoo. So, if x is the number of birds on Jamal's photo, then Brittany's phone can hold 50x photographs. Now, let's find out how many birds are on Jamal's photo. We know that the largest number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold is 1800, so the smallest number of birds on his photo must be less than or equal to 1800. Therefore, the equation becomes:  

1800 = 50x 

Now divide both sides by 50:  

36 = x 

So there are 36 birds on Jamal's photo of the penguin enclosure in the zoo."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Sasa spent on all the wood she bought. We know that she has ten 2x4x10 boards and five 4x4x10 boards. So, let's start with the 2x4x10 boards. There are ten of them, so if we multiply 10 by $10 (the price per board), we get:  
Ten 2x4x10 boards x $10/board = $100  
Now, let's add the cost of the 4x4x10 boards. There are five of them, so if we multiply 5 by $16/board, we get:  
Five 4x4x10 boards x $16/board = $80  
Adding both amounts gives us the total amount Sasa spent on all the wood:  
$100 + $80 = $180  
Finally, if we subtract the total amount Sasa spent from the total value of the wood she has left (i.e., the current market price minus the price she paid), we can find out how much profit she made:  
Total value of wood - Total amount spent = Profit  
(Current market price - Price paid) - $180 = Profit  
If the current market price is $20 per board, then the total value of the wood Sasa has left is:  
Total value of wood = Number of boards x Current market price  
= 10 x 20 + 5 x 20 = $200 + $100 = $300  
Subtracting the total amount spent from the total value of the wood gives us the profit:  
Profit = Total value of wood - Total amount spent  
= $300 - $180 = $120"
Response:  We know that the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so we can start by setting up an equation based on this information.  Let x represent the number of cups of sugar used (since there are 8 cups in a gallon and we want to find out how many cups of sugar were used).  Since the total amount of liquid is 13 cups (7 cups of sugar + 6 cups of water), we can write:  x + 6 = 13...  Now we need to use the fact that there are 8 cups in a gallon to convert from cups to gallons.  There are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon, so:  x + 6 = 13 × 8/128 = 13 × 4/128 = 52/128...  Finally, we can simplify our fractional answer by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCF) of 4:  x + 6 = 52/128 = 4/9 = 2/3...  So, if she used 120 kašica šećera, then she used 2/3 of 120 or 80 kašica šećera.
Response:  First, we know that John buys two pairs of shoes for each of his three children. That means he buys a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Next, we know that each pair of shoes costs $60. So, to find out how much John paid in total, we multiply the number of pairs of shoes he bought by the cost per pair: 6 x $60 = $360. Therefore, John paid $360 for all six pairs of shoes.
"Response:  We know that there were 2 containers shipped into the port on the first day, and each container had 5 cars. So, we can calculate how many cars were shipped in total:  
2 containers x 5 cars per container = 10 cars (total)  On the second day, we are told that there were 30 cars in the port. This means that all of the cars from the previous day plus any additional cars must have been brought in today. So, let's subtract the number of cars from the first day from the total to find out how many cars were brought in today:  
30 cars - 10 cars = 20 cars (brought in on the second day)  Now, we need to determine how many containers were needed to bring in these 20 cars. Since each container holds 5 cars, we can divide the number of cars by the number of cars per container to get the number of containers:  
20 cars / 5 cars per container = 4 containers (needed for the second day)  Therefore, 4 containers were shipped into the port on the second day."
Response:  First, we know that Adrien's total income four years ago was 30% more than Lily's income at the same time. So if Lily earned x dollars, Adrien earned x + (x * 0.3) = x + 30% of x = x + 30x = 3x dollars. Four years later, Adrien's income increased by 40%. So his current income is 3x + (3x * 0.4) = 3x + 120% of 3x = 3x + 36x = 48x dollars. Therefore, Adrien and Lily's combined income four years later is 48x + x = 57x dollars.
Response:  If Miguel uses two sheets of paper per day and has 30 sheets of paper on each sheet, then he uses 60 sheets of paper per month (2 x 30).
Response:  First, we know that Morisette brought five apples and eight oranges. So, let's write down what she brought:  5 apples + 8 oranges =? Next, we know that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette and half as many oranges. So, let's write down what Kael brought:  2 x 5 (apples) = 10 apples + 4 oranges (half of 8) =? Now, we can add the total amount of fruit that both Morisette and Kael brought:  5 apples + 8 oranges + 10 apples + 4 oranges =? Solution: We have: 5 + 8 + 10 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31 fruit in total. Therefore, Morisette and Kael together have 31 pieces of fruit.
Response:  First, we know that Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday.  Next, she slept for 2 hours less each of the next two days, so she slept for 6 hours on Tuesday and 4 hours on Wednesday.  If she slept for 1 hour more than those two days for the rest of the week, how many hours did she sleep in total for the entire week?  To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  Monday: 8 hours  Tuesday: 6 hours (2 hours less)  Wednesday: 4 hours (2 hours less)  Rest of the week: 1 hour more than previous days Total hours slept =?  We can start by adding the hours from Monday to Wednesday:  8 + 6 + 4 = 18 Now, let's add the hours for the rest of the week:  18 + 1 = 19 So, Sadie slept for a total of 19 hours throughout the week.
"Response:  First, we know that Rosie can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers a distance of:  

10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles  

Now, we are told that after running for 3 hours, Rosie slows down to 8 kilometers per hour. So, if she runs for an additional 7 hours at this slower pace, she will cover a total distance of:  

8 kilometers/hour x 7 hours = 56 kilometers  

Therefore, Rosie can run a total distance of 30 + 56 = 86 kilometers in 7 hours."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 60 letters in total and Jennie has already put marks on one-third of them. So, if she has put marks on 30 letters, then the number of letters without marks is:  
60 - 30 = 30.  Now, let's find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie started working. We know that after marking one-third of the letters, there were 30 letters left without marks. So, the initial number of letters in the pile was:  
3 x 30 = 90.  Therefore, there were 90 letters in the pile when Jennie started working."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia used three skewers to taste her goulash before serving it. Secondly, when she went to serve the dish, she had 12 skewers left. Finally, we are told that her husband gave her a package of five new skewers. So, if we subtract the number of skewers Julia used (three) from the total number of skewers she had after preparing the meal (12), we can calculate how many skewers were in the package her husband gave her:  
12 - 3 = 9  
Therefore, there were nine skewers in the package her husband gave her."
"Response:  We know that Dylan bought 38 chicken breasts and 6 more than chicken breasts (ribs). So he bought 38 + 6 = 44 pieces of meat in total. Since each package of sausages contains 500 grams of meat, we can calculate how many packages of sausages Dylan needs to buy as follows:  
Number of packages of sausages = Total amount of meat / Amount of meat per package  
= 44 kg / 500 g  
= 8.8 packages  
Therefore, Dylan needs to buy 8.8 packages of sausages."
Response:  First, we know that Amy had 20 more friends than Lily after she transferred to a new school. So, if Lily had 50 friends, then Amy would have had 50 + 20 = 70 friends. Therefore, together they have 50 + 70 = 120 friends.
"Response:  First, we know that 3 lubenices cost as much as 1 paprika, so:  
3 x 15 = 45  Since Dillon wants to buy 4 lubenices, he will pay:  
4 x 45 = 180  Now, let's calculate the cost of the paprikas:  
20 x 15 = 300  And finally, the cost of the naranches:  
10 x 5 = 50  So, in total, Dillon will spend:  
180 + 300 + 50 = 530 $"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many patients the hospital sees in one day: 500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes per day. Next, we can calculate how much the hospital earns from these visits: 12,000 minutes/day x $200/minute = $2,400,000 per day.  So, the hospital earns $2,400,000 per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are initially 60 seasonal workers who play elves in Nissa's robotic center. Secondly, one-third of the elves give up after their children become ill and return home. This means that 20 elves (1/3 x 60) will stop working. Thirdly, another 10 elves (10%) will stop working because their children hit them on the legs. So, in total, 30 elves (20 + 10) will stop working. Therefore, the number of elves left is: 60 - 30 = 30.
Response:  First, we know that in May, Joseph spent $500.  In June, he spent $60 less than in May. So, if we subtract $60 from $500, we get:  Total amount spent in May and June = $500 - $60 = $440.
Response:  First, we know that Pam rode the roller coaster twice and each ride cost 6 tickets. So she spent 2 x 6 = 12 tickets.  Now let's look at Fred. He rode the roller coaster four times, so he spent 4 x 6 = 24 tickets.  But wait! We also know that both Pam and Fred went on the toboggan together, and it cost them each 6 tickets. So in total, they spent 12 + 12 = 24 tickets on the toboggan.  Therefore, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred that day was 12 + 24 = 36 tickets.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Walt walked 6 kilometers on Monday. Secondly, we are given that he walked six times more miles on Tuesday than he did on Monday. So if he walked x kilometers on Monday, then he walked 6x kilometers on Tuesday. Finally, we know that his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Let x be the number of kilometers Walt walked on Monday. Then, the number of kilometers he walked on Tuesday is 6x. The total distance Walt traveled from Monday to Wednesday is:  

41 = x + 6x Now solve for x.  Answer:  We have two equations and two unknowns (x and 6x). Substituting the first equation into the second equation gives us:  

41 = x + 6x 5x + 6x = 41 Combine like terms:  

11x = 41 x = 37 So Walt walked 37 kilometers on Monday and 222 kilometers (6x) on Tuesday. His total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 37 + 222 = 269 kilometers."
Response:  We know that Tom has four cars and he pays $15 per month for each car. So, if we multiply the number of cars by the cost per month, we get:  Total cost = Number of cars x Cost per car x Monthly rate  Total cost = 4 x $15 x 12  Total cost = $720 per year  Therefore, Tom pays $720 per year for his four cars.
"Response:  First, we know that Brian has 20 video games and he lost 5 before the comparison was made. So, if we subtract 5 from 20, we get:  
20 - 5 = 15  Now, we are told that Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer video games than Brian. So, to find out how many video games Bobby has, we can subtract 5 from the number of video games Brian has:  
15 - 5 = 10  Therefore, Bobby has 10 video games."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 one-horned animals left in the world and two-thirds of them are in Scotland. Secondly, we know that two-thirds of Scottish one-horned animals are females. So, to find out how many female one-horned animals there are in Scotland, we can multiply the total number of Scottish one-horned animals by two-thirds.  Multiplying 2/3 x 27 gives us:  Two-thirds of 27 is equal to: 27 x 2/3 = 18 Therefore, there are 18 female one-horned animals in Scotland.
"Response:  First calculate the total cost of the items without delivery charge:  
Sendviči x 2 = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00  
Vrećice čipsa x 2 = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00  
Kolači x 2 = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00  
Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 Now let's add the delivery charge: Delivery charge = $20.00 x 20% = $4.00 So the final total cost will be: Final total cost = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00"
Response:  First, we know that Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. So he spent 8 hours x 5 questions/hour = 400 minutes answering the first test. Since there were 75 questions in total, Mark answered 75 - 400 = 325 questions correctly. Now let's move on to the second test with 100 questions. If Mark takes 6 hours to complete this test, he will spend 6 hours x 5 questions/hour = 300 minutes answering it. However, since there are 100 questions in total, Mark cannot possibly answer all of them within 300 minutes. Therefore, the number of questions left unanswered is 100 - 300 = 70.
Response:  We know that there are four times as many pink rubber balls (ružičastih) as blue chew toys (plavih). So if we have 4x more of one thing than another, and we have 12 of the other thing, then we must have 4 x 12 = 48 pink rubber balls.  Therefore, there are 48 pink rubber balls in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 cars available for renting in total. Secondly, we know that 12 of them are automatic, and 4 are manual. Finally, we know that the remaining 4 cars are semi-automatic. So, to find out the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.  Calculation: Number of semi-automatic cars = 4 Total number of cars = 20 Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4/20) x 100% = 20% Therefore, 20% of the available cars are semi-automatic.
"Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total (pčela) and we also know that there are twice as many worker bees than queen bees. So if there are x queen bees, then there would be 2x worker bees.  Since the total number of bees is 700, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
Queen Bees + Worker Bees = Total Bees 2 Queen Bees + Worker Bees = 700  Now we need to find out how many queen bees there are. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate the variable for queen bees:  
2 Queen Bees + Worker Bees = 700 Divide both sides by 2:  Queen Bees + Worker Bees = 350  Now we have found out that there are 350 queen bees. Next, we can use the fact that there are twice as many worker bees as queen bees to find out how many worker bees there are:  
Worker Bees = Queen Bees x 2 Worker Bees = 350 x 2 Worker Bees = 700 - 350 Worker Bees = 350  Therefore, there are 350 worker bees."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jordan plays video games for two hours every day. Secondly, he works part-time for half of his working time and earns $10 per hour. So, if we calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week (7 days x 2 hours/day), it comes out to be:  

Total hours spent playing video games = 7 days x 2 hours/day = 14 hours/week  
Now, let's calculate the total amount earned from part-time work:  
Total amount earned from part-time work = Number of hours worked x Hourly wage  
= Half of the total working hours x $10/hour  
= (14 hours/week x 0.5) x $10/hour  
= 7 hours/week x $10/hour = $70/week  
Therefore, the total amount earned by Jordan in one week is the sum of the amount earned from part-time work ($70) and the amount earned from playing video games ($14):  
Total amount earned in one week = $70 + $14 = $84"
Response:  First we need to calculate how much John spent on non-food items. We know that he bought milk for $2, eggs for $3, sugar for $3, cups for $3, and spoons for $4. So, in total, John spent $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15 on non-food items. Now, since there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, we can calculate the amount of tax as follows: Tax = $15 x 10% = $1.50 Therefore, the total amount John paid for all his purchases, including tax, is: Total = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lucas will make from each client. Then, we can add up all of his expected income for the week. Finally, we can subtract his total expenses to find out his profit. Here are the calculations:  1. Calculate the amount of money Lucas will make per client: Number of clients x price per item = Total revenue per client 3 clients x $2 (price of bleach) + $5 (price of cleaning supplies) = $6 + $5 = $11 per client 2. Add up all of Lucas's expected income for the week: 3 clients x $11 = $33 3. Subtract his total expenses to find out his profit: $33 - $2 x 3 = $33 - $6 = $27 per week Profit = $27 per week
Response:  Firstly, we know that John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare contains 100 plants. So, in total, John has 10 x 100 = 1000 plants. Secondly, we are given that John can harvest the pineapples every 3 months. Therefore, in one year, John can harvest the pineapples 4 times (since there are 4 seasons in a year). Now, let's calculate how many pineapples John can collect per year. We know that each plant produces one pineapple every 3 months, so John can collect 1000 x 4 = 4000 pineapples per year.
Response:  First, we know that John has collected toys from under his bed in his room.  Secondly, he has three boxes of LEGO pieces: one with 500 pieces, another with three times as many pieces (so 3 x 500 = 1500), and another with one-quarter as many pieces (so 1/4 x 500 = 125). Thirdly, John wants to collect all the LEGO pieces. So our goal is to find out how many total pieces John will have if he collects all the pieces from these three boxes. To do this, we need to add up the number of pieces in each box. Therefore, the total number of pieces John will have is: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2225.
Response:  First, we know that in the first 6 hours of the day, there were 30 bees leaving the hive. This means that during this time period, there were 30 - 2 = 28 bees inside the hive. Now, let's consider the next 6 hours. We are told that half of the number of bees that left the hive returned during this time period. So, if 28 bees remained inside the hive after the first 6 hours, then half of 28 is 14. Therefore, 14 bees returned to the hive during the second 6-hour period. In total, then, there were 28 + 14 = 42 bees inside the hive at the end of the day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of admission for an adult is $12 and for a child is $10. So, if Brittany's mom gave the cashier $8, she must have bought tickets for one adult and one child. Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is: Adult ticket = $12 Child ticket = $10 Total cost = $12 + $10 = $22 Since Brittany's mom gave the cashier $8, she paid for the tickets as follows: Adult ticket = $8 (since the cashier kept $4) Child ticket = $8 (since the cashier kept $4) Total cost = $8 + $8 = $16 So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $8 in exchange for two museum tickets worth $16.
"Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. So if Dorothy has $x$ friends, Charlie has $3x$ friends.  Since James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, James has $4x$ friends.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
$$\begin{aligned} \text{Charlie}'s Facebook friends} &= 3\times \text{Dorothy's Facebook friends} \\ &= 3(x) \\ &= 3x \end{aligned}$$  And similarly for James:  
$$\begin{aligned} \text{James's Facebook friends} &= 4\times \text{Dorothy's Facebook friends} \\ &= 4(x) \\ &= 4x \end{aligned}$$  Now we are given that Charlie has 12 Facebook friends. So we can substitute this value into one of the equations to solve for x:  
$$\begin{aligned} 12 &= 3x \\ 4x &= 36 \\ x &= 9 \end{aligned}$$  Therefore, Dorothy has 9 Facebook friends, and James has 4 times as many Facebook friends, or 4 x 9 = 36 Facebook friends."
Response:  First we need to calculate how long it will take Steve and Tim to get home from school.  For Steve, we know he can bike at 440 steps per minute, so if he has a distance of 3 miles (which is equal to 5,280 feet), it will take him:  5,280 / 440 = 12 minutes to get home.  Now let's look at Tim. He can skateboard at 264 steps per minute, but his distance is not in feet, it's in kilometers! So we need to convert his distance first. There are 1,000 meters in a kilometer, so:  3 km x 1,000 m/km = 3,000 m  3,000 m / 264 spm = 11.36 minutes for Tim to get home.  Since Steve takes less time than Tim, Steve will arrive at home before Tim does. The difference between their arrival times is:  12 - 11.36 = 0.64 minutes or approximately 40 seconds.  Therefore, Steve will wait about 40 seconds for Tim to catch up after finishing the race.
Response:  First, we know that each tire costs $0.25 to fill up.  There were 5 people who came to inflate their bicycle tires on the first day. So, the total amount earned from these 5 people is:  5 x $0.25 = $1.25  Next, 3 people came to inflate all the tires on their tricycles. Since there are 3 tricycles, and each tire costs $0.25, the total amount earned from these 3 people is:  3 x (3 x $0.25) = $1.75  Finally, one person came to inflate one tire on one bicycle. The amount earned from this person is:  $0.25  Therefore, the total amount earned for the day is:  $1.25 + $1.75 + $0.25 = $3.25
Response:  First, we know that Carl buys ten packages of cookies. Second, each package contains six cookies inside. Third, each cookie costs $0.10. So, if Carl pays $10 with his money, how much will he get in total?  To find out, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Carl will get:  Ten packages x Six cookies per package = 60 cookies Total cost of cookies = 60 cookies x $0.10 per cookie = $6 Now, Carl has $10 to pay, so he will have $10 - $6 = $4 left after buying all the cookies.
Response:  First, Dave ate 14 pomfrits before the hungry seagull stole the box from his hand. Then, the seagull ate half of what was left (since there were still 50% of the pomfrits remaining). So, after the seagull ate its share, there were 30 pomfrits left. Next, three pigeons came and each ate three pomfrits, leaving only five pomfrits. Finally, a raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining five pomfrits, so one pomfrit was left. Therefore, when Dave bought the big box of pomfrits, there were originally 16 pomfrits in it (5 x 3 = 15 + 1).
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Kimo spends in school per week. We know that he has three classes of 1 hour each per day, so he spends 3 x 1 = 3 hours in school per day. Since there are 5 days in a week, Kimo spends a total of 3 x 5 = 15 hours in school per week. Now, let's calculate how many hours Kimo spends in school per semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so Kimo spends 15 hours/week x 16 weeks = 240 hours in school per semester. Finally, let's calculate how many hours Kimo spends on lectures. We know that he has two 2-hour lectures per week, so he spends 2 x 2 = 4 hours on lectures per week. Multiplying this by the number of weeks in a semester (16), we get 4 hours/week x 16 weeks = 64 hours on lectures per semester. Therefore, Kimo spends a total of 240 + 64 = 304 hours on school and lectures per semester.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total length of all the baked goods that Bill produces daily.  We know that he makes 300 cookies (10 cm each), 120 chocolate cruellers (15 cm each), and 60 bagels (60 cm each). So, the total length of all the baked goods is: 300 x 10 = 3000 cm + 120 x 15 = 1800 cm + 60 x 60 = 3600 cm = 9400 cm. Now, let's convert this value into feet. There are 12 inches in one foot, so: 9400 cm / 12 = 783.33 ft. Therefore, if Bill places all his baked goods end-to-end, they will be approximately 783.33 feet long.
"Response:  Firstly we need to calculate how many bananas each species needs per month and then add them up for two months.  Here are the calculations:  
Gorillas need 400 bananas/month x 2 = 800 bananas  
Pavijans need 100 bananas/month x 2 = 200 bananas  
Majmuni need 200 bananas/month x 2 = 400 bananas  
Total number of bananas needed for two months = 800 + 200 + 400 = 1400 bananas  
Therefore, the zookeeper should order 1400 bananas every two months to ensure that all three species have enough food."
"Response:  First, we know that Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.  Now, let's look at Kelly's run. She runs once from one end of the field to the other (200 yards), then turns around and runs back to the starting line (200 yards). In total, she has covered 200 + 200 = 400 yards. However, since she doesn't want to run next to Blake, she starts running towards the 40-yard line and back, for a total of 34 times. Each time she runs 40 yards, so her total distance is:  34 x 40 = 1360 yards.  Since Kelly ran less than Blake, she is the ""gubitnik"" in this scenario. The difference between their distances is:  1500 - 1360 = 140 yards.  Therefore, the winner (Blake) trcjes 140 yards farther than the loser (Kelly)."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much Rafael spent on each item.  Oловке Rafael has bought for $1.5 per piece, so he paid:  4 x $1.5 = $6 For beležnice, Rafael paid $4 per piece, so he paid:  2 x $4 = $8 Obruč papirnog papirja Rafael paid $20 for it. So in total, Rafael spent: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34
Response:  First, we know that there are 11 ducks in total.  Of those, 6 were hiding under a flower, and 2 were hiding under a rock.  That means there are 3 ducks left that Finn can see swimming in the lake.  So, the answer is 3.
Response:  First, we know that the water level in the tank increased by 2 meters from Monday to Tuesday. So, if the water level was 5 meters deep on Monday, it was 7 meters deep (5 + 2) on Tuesday.  Next, we are told that the water level decreased by two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, if the water level was 7 meters deep on Tuesday, it would be:  7 x 0.67 = 4.69 meters deep on Wednesday.  Therefore, the correct answer is 4.69 meters.
Response:  First, we know that Anakin caught 10 sea stars, 6 sea horses, and 3 clown fish.  We also know that Lokslin caught fewer sea stars than Anakin (5 less), fewer sea horses than Anakin (3 less), but more clown fish than Anakin (2 more). So, let's start with Anakin's catch:  10 sea stars + 6 sea horses + 3 clown fish =?   Next, we can calculate Lokslin's catch based on the information given:  5 sea stars less than Anakin's catch + 3 sea horses less than Anakin's catch + 2 clown fish more than Anakin's catch =?  Now, add both catches together to find out how many fish they caught in total: ? +? = Total Catch  Can you solve for the unknown numbers using the equations above?
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much the price of the ball will increase every two months.  If the price increases by 20%, that means it will increase by (20/100) x 100 = 20%. So, after two months, the price of the ball will be: $20 x 1.20 = $24. Therefore, the price of the ball after 36 months can be calculated as follows: $24 x 1.20^36 = $24 x 1.20 x 1.20 x... x 1.20 (36 times) = $24 x 1.20^36 = $576.88.
Response:  First, we know that the action figure costs $5 and each red car costs $4. So if we have 5 red cars, their total cost would be:  5 x $4 = $20  Next, we know that the action figure costs $5 and there are 3 of them in total. So their total cost would be:  3 x $5 = $15  Finally, we add up all the costs to find out how much everything is worth: $20 + $15 = $35  Therefore, all the game pieces together are worth $35.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jackie will lose if she works three hours less as an independent contractor and pays taxes herself.  If she earns $100 per hour and works for three fewer hours, she loses $35 x 3 = $105 in income.  Next, let's calculate how much Jackie would pay for an accountant.  If the accountant charges $90 per month, that's $90 x 12 = $1,080 per year.  Now, let's compare these two amounts:  $1,080 (accountant fee) - $105 (lost income from working three fewer hours) = $975.  So, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will save $975 per year compared to doing her own taxes and losing $105 in income.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Elvira has spent on the computer and its accessories. We know that she bought a computer for €1090, a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. So, in total, she has spent:  
€1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423  
Now, let's subtract the amount she has spent from her budget of €1500:  
€1500 - €1423 = €77  
So, Elvira will have €77 left over for clothes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan. Secondly, she has been given the task of making 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser. Now, let's calculate how many times Sandra will have to be an egg donor. We can do this by dividing the total number of flans she needs to make (15) by the number of eggs required per flan (3): 15 / 3 = 5 So, Sandra will need to donate eggs 5 times in order to make all 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser.
"Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brook, so if Brook is x years old, then Seth is 2x years old.  In two years, their combined age will be 28 years old. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

2x + x = 28  
3x = 28  
x = 9  
Seth is 18 years old (since he is twice as old as Brook)."
Response:  We know that Ethel has $8 and Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel. So, if we add $2 to $8, we get:  $8 + $2 = $10  Therefore, Jimmy has $10.
Response:  First, we know that Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day, except for weekends when he walks 10 miles (which is approximately 16 kilometers). So, during the weekdays, Pancho walks 30 kilometers each day. For the entire week, this means he walks a total of:  30 km/day x 5 days = 150 km   Therefore, Pancho can walk 150 kilometers in one week.
"Response:  First we need to find out how much does one shirt cost. It says ""Each shirt costs $25"". So, if we want to know how much does one shirt cost, we can simply multiply $25 by 1 (since we are asking for one shirt). Therefore, one shirt costs $25. Now let's move on to the jacket. We know that the jacket costs three times as much as the shirt. So, if one shirt costs $25, then the jacket will cost $25 x 3 = $75. Finally, we need to add the price of the pants. The problem states that the pants cost ""about the same"" as the shirt and jacket. Since ""about the same"" means roughly equal, we can assume that the pants cost around $25 like the shirt. So, the total cost of one pair of pants is $25. Therefore, the total cost of one uniform consisting of a shirt, a jacket, and pants is: $25 + $75 + $25 = $125."
Response:  First, we know that Jake sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so he sees a total of 80 x 8 = 640 legs from the spiders. Next, we know that he sees 90 insects with 6 legs each, so he sees a total of 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. Finally, we know that he sees 3 rare mutated creatures with 10 legs each, so he sees a total of 3 x 10 = 30 legs from these creatures. Therefore, the total number of legs that Jake sees is: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.
Response:  First, we know that Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are the same age. So if Sally Four has 8 years old, then Sally Thirtytwo also has 8 years old.  Now, we know that Sally Two is three years older than Sally Four. Therefore, Sally Two must be 11 years old (8 + 3).  Next, we know that Grandma Red is twice as old as Sally Four. So Grandma Red must be 16 years old (8 x 2).  Finally, we can find out the total age of all four birds by adding their ages together:  Sally Four = 8 years old  Sally Two = 11 years old  Grandma Red = 16 years old  Sally Thirtytwo = 8 years old Total Age = 8 + 11 + 16 + 8 = 43 years old
Response:  First we need to calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month for her student loan, credit card and mortgage if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment.  For the student loan, the minimum payment is $300 per month, so if Jessica pays 50% more, she will pay $450 per month ($300 x 1.5).  For the credit card, the minimum payment is $200 per month, so if Jessica pays 50% more, she will pay $300 per month ($200 x 1.5).  For the mortgage, the minimum payment is $500 per month, so if Jessica pays 50% more, she will pay $750 per month ($500 x 1.5).  Now let's add up all of these payments to see how much Jessica will pay in a year:  Student loan: $450 x 12 = $5,400 Credit card: $300 x 12 = $3,600 Mortgage: $750 x 12 = $9,000 Total annual payments: $5,400 + $3,600 + $9,000 = $18,000 So, in one year, Jessica will pay a total of $18,000 if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment for her student loan, credit card, and mortgage.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how long it will take Billy to peel all the potatoes. We know that he needs about 1 minute and 30 seconds (1.5 minutes) to peel one potato. So, if he has 60 potatoes to peel, we can multiply 1.5 minutes by 60 to get: 90 minutes (or 1.5 hours).  Now, let's calculate how long it will take Billy to cut all the peeled potatoes. We know that he needs only about 5 seconds to cut each potato. So, if he has 60 peeled potatoes to cut, we can multiply 5 seconds by 60 to get: 300 seconds (or 5 minutes).  Therefore, in total, Billy will need approximately 1 hour and 5 minutes (1.5 + 5 = 6.5 minutes) to prepare all the potatoes for his big family barbecue.
"Response:  First, we know that they sell each gallon of lemonade for $50 cents. So if they sold 20 gallons, they would have earned:  

$50 cents x 20 gallons = $10 per gallon x 20 gallons = $200  Since they earned $25 dollars, and they spent some amount on lemons, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  Let X be the cost of lemons in dollars. Then we know that:  

$200 (earned) - X (cost of lemons) = $25 (profit)  Now we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $200:  $\frac{X}{200} = \frac{25}{200}$  Simplifying this fraction gives us:  $\frac{X}{200} = \frac{1}{4}$  Therefore, the cost of lemons is:  $X = 4 \times 200 = 800$  So, Juan and his brother spent $800 on lemons."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 240 Asian players in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. This means that there were 160 non-Japanese Asian players (240 - 80 = 160). Since 60 of these non-Japanese players were Chinese, there must have been 100 non-Chinese players (160 - 60 = 100). Now, if there were 60 girls in the Chinese team, there must have been 40 girls in the non-Chinese teams (100 x 0.4 = 40). Therefore, there were 40 girls in the overall tournament.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Zayd spends on rent, gas for his car, and donations.  Rent: $1500 (1/4 of $6000) Gas: $1500 (1/3 of $6000) Donations: $1500 (half of $6000) Total expenses: $4500 Now let's subtract total expenses from Zayd's income: Income: $6000 - Expenses: $4500 = $1500 Left with $1500 after all expenses and donations.
Response:  First, we know that Monica has 4 fewer rabbits than Bo. So if Bo has 40 rabbits, then Monica has 40 - 4 = 36 rabbits. Now, we are told that Rani has 10 more rabbits than Monica. Therefore, Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 rabbits. Finally, we add up all three numbers to find out how many rabbits they have in total: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 rabbits.
"Response:  First, we know that Lloyd earns $10 per hour for teaching mathematics.  In the first week, he taught for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:  
$10 x 5 = $50  In the second week, he taught for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:  
$10 x 8 = $80  Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of:  
$50 + $80 = $130 in the first two weeks."
Response:  We know that the winner received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in total. So we can start by finding out how many votes the winner received.  3/4 x 80 =?  Now we need to find out how many votes the loser received. Since the winner received 3/4 of the votes, the loser must have received the remaining 1/4 of the votes.  1/4 x 80 =?  Finally, we add up the number of votes received by both candidates to find out the total number of votes cast.  3/4 x 80 + 1/4 x 80 =?  Can you solve this problem?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra has ordered four times more red roses than white carnations. So if she has ordered x white carnations, she has ordered 4x red roses. We also know that she has ordered 200 purple calla lilies, which are five times as many as the number of white carnations. Therefore, the total number of flowers Sandra has ordered is: 200 + (4x) = 200 + 4(x). Now, we need to find out how many crvenih ruža Sandra needs to receive before 17 hours. She has threatened to change suppliers if they don't arrive by then. To calculate this, we can use the fact that there are 360 minutes in a day and 17 hours is equal to 17 x 60 = 1020 minutes. So, Sandra needs to receive enough crvenih ruža to last until 1020 minutes before 17 hours. Since each red rose takes 5 minutes to deliver, Sandra needs: 1020 / 5 = 204 red roses to be delivered before 17 hours. Therefore, Fred must deliver at least 204 crvenih ruža to Sandra before 17 hours to avoid her changing suppliers.
Response:  First, we know that two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jean's age at that time. So, if Jean is x years old now, then Mark was (x + 5) years old two years ago. Now, we are given that Jean is 30 years old now, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + 2 = 30... 2. Solving for x, we get:  x = 28  Therefore, Jean is currently 28 years old and Mark is 33 years old (since he was 5 years older than half of Jean's age two years ago).
"Response:  First we need to calculate how long it will take each member of the first team to run their portion of the race (400 meters). We know that they are all running at a constant speed of 55 seconds per 400 meters. So, if one runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, then the next runner will run 400 meters in 55 seconds as well. And so on. Therefore, the total time for the first team to complete the race is:  
Total Time = (1 x 55 sec) + (2 x 55 sec) + (3 x 55 sec) + (4 x 55 sec) = 55 sec + 55 sec + 55 sec + 55 sec = 220 sec or 3 minutes and 40 seconds. Now let's calculate the time it will take the second team to complete the race. The first runner will run 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means the next runner will have to run 400 meters in 58 seconds (since the first runner ran 400 meters in 60 seconds, not exactly 60 seconds). And so on. Therefore, the total time for the second team to complete the race is:  
Total Time = (1 x 60 sec) + (2 x 58 sec) + (3 x 56 sec) + (4 x 54 sec) = 60 sec + 58 sec + 56 sec + 54 sec = 228 sec or 3 minutes and 48 seconds. Since the first team completed the race in 3 minutes and 40 seconds, and the second team took 3 minutes and 48 seconds, the difference between their times is:  
Difference = 3 min 48 sec - 3 min 40 sec = 8 sec. Therefore, the faster team will win by 8 seconds."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the number of ways Jerry can roll each possible outcome.  For example, if he rolls a 1,2, or 3, there is one way to do so (he can roll a 1). If he rolls two numbers that add up to 4,5, or 6, there are three ways to do so (he can roll a 2 and a 2, a 3 and a 1, or a 4 and a 0). And so on.  Now, let's calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a 3 or higher.  To do this, we need to add up all the probabilities of him rolling each possible outcome.  We can use the following formula:  P(A) = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes)  In this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways Jerry can roll a 3 or higher, which is:  4 + 5 + 6 +... + 6 = 21  The total number of outcomes is the number of ways Jerry can roll any number, which is:  6 x 6 x 6 = 216  So, the probability of Jerry rolling a 3 or higher is:  P(A) = (21) / (216) = 1/10  Or, in percentage terms, the probability of Jerry rolling a 3 or higher is:  P(A) = 10%  Therefore, based on the given information, it is more likely (10%) that Jerry will roll a 3 or higher than that he will roll two consecutive even numbers (2%).
Response:  If Jenna picked up half of her mother's apples, and her mother had 20 apples in total, then Jenna picked up 10 apples (half of 20). So together, they bought 30 apples (Jenna's 10 + her mother's 20).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 160 pieces of slamka in total and they need to be distributed among different groups. We have three kavezi with small rodents (glodari) who receive 6 pieces of slamka each, so let's calculate how many pieces of slamka they will get in total:  

3 kaveza x 6 pieces per kavez = 18 pieces of slamka  
Now, we also have 10 kaveza with hedgehogs who receive 5 pieces of slamka each, so let's calculate how many pieces of slamka they will get in total:  

10 kaveza x 5 pieces per kavez = 50 pieces of slamka  
Finally, we have an enclosure for rabbits where 20 pieces of slamka are distributed among them. So, let's calculate how many pieces of slamka each rabbit receives:  

20 pieces of slamka / 4 rabbits = 5 pieces of slamka per rabbit  
Now, let's add up all the pieces of slamka from each group to find out how many pacova (pacov is another name for hamster in Serbian) have in each kavez:  

18 pieces of slamka + 50 pieces of slamka + 5 pieces of slamka per rabbit = 73 pieces of slamka per kavez  
Therefore, if there are 160 pieces of slamka in total, then each kavez has 73 pieces of slamka."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much interest will be accrued in 3 months at an annual rate of 2% (since it is a monthly interest rate, we divide by 12): Interest = Principal x Rate x Time = $ 100 x 2/12 x 3 = $ 6 So, after 3 months, Benedict would have earned $6 in interest. Now, let's add this amount to the principal: Total = Principal + Interest = $100 + $6 = $106 Therefore, if Mandy pays Benedict after 3 months, he should receive $106.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of transporting each wreath from the farm to the storage is $2. Therefore, if the merchant sold all the wreaths for $30 per wreath, he would have made a total profit of: Profit = (Number of wreaths x Price per wreath) - (Cost per wreath x Number of wreaths) Profit = (x x 30) - (2 x x) Where x is the number of wreaths. Solving for x, we get: x = 167 Since the merchant sold all the wreaths for $30 per wreath, he would have made a total profit of: Profit = (167 x 30) - (2 x 167) = 4910 - 334 = 4576 dollars.
Response:  First, we know that they spent $20.25 on three cards for the fair and $4.50 less on food than on cards. So, they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.  Next, we know that they went on two different rides that cost $33 each. So, they spent $33 + $33 = $66 on rides.  Finally, we need to find out how much each person paid. Since there are three people, we can divide the total cost by 3 to get the amount each person paid: $15.75 + $66 = $81.75 ÷ 3 = $27.25 per person.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John can collect 2 apples per minute. Secondly, he will collect apples for three hours. So let's calculate how many minutes he will collect apples: 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes Now, let's calculate how many apples John will collect in total: 180 minutes x 2 apples/minute = 360 apples
Response:  First, we know that each patka eats 2.5 kg of insects per week. So, if there are ten pataka, they will eat a total of 25 kg of insects per week (2.5 x 10). Now, since there are seven days in a week, we can calculate how much each patka needs to eat per day: 25 kg / 7 days = 3.57 kg per day (or approximately 3.6 kg) Therefore, each patka needs to eat around 3.6 kg of insects per day to survive.
Response:  First, we know that Tom plants 10 trees every year and cuts down 2 trees each year. So after 10 years, he will have planted a total of 10 x 10 = 100 trees. However, since 30% of the trees die, he will be left with 100 - (30/100) x 100 = 70 trees.  Therefore, there will be 70 trees remaining after 10 years.
Response:  First, we know that there were initially 18 ružičastih plastičnih flaminga (ružićastih) on Sue's lawn. Then, on Saturday morning, her neighbors took one-third of these flamingos and painted them white (bijeli). So, they removed 6 flamingos (one-third of 18), leaving 12 ružičastih flaminga on Sue's lawn. Next, in Sunday morning, her neighbors added 18 new ružičastih flaminga to Sue's lawn, bringing the total number of flamingos to 30 (12 + 18). Finally, in Sunday afternoon, the number of flamingos was increased by another 18, so now there are 48 flamingos on Sue's lawn (30 + 18). Therefore, at 5 pm on Sunday, there were 48 flamingos outside Sue's house.
"Response:  First, we know that each pen costs $2, so if Violeta wants to buy five pens of different colors and has $20 to spend, she will need to calculate how many pens she can buy with that amount of money.  Here is the calculation:  
$20 / $2 per pen = 10 pens  Therefore, Violeta can buy ten pens in different colors using her $20 allowance."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much one olovka costs. We know that one olovka and one piece of gum cost $1.20 together, so if we divide $1.20 by two, we get $0.60 per olovka. Now, let's calculate how much eight olovki will cost. If eight olovki cost $0.60 each, then the total cost will be $4.80 (8 x $0.60).
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many half-kilogram portions of mrkva there are in 200 funta.  We know that 1 funta is equal to 0.5 kilograms, so: 200 funta x 0.5 kg/funta = 100 kg  Now, we know that each restaurant will receive half a kilogram of mrkva, so: 100 kg / 2 (since each restaurant receives half a kilogram) = 50 kg  Therefore, 50 kilograms of mrkva will not be used.
Response:  We know that there are 23786 people in Soda and we have information about the number of men and women. To find out how many children there are, we can subtract the number of men from the total population because all the men are adults and do not have any children. So, if we subtract 8417 (the number of men) from 23786 (the total population), we get: 23786 - 8417 = 15369. Therefore, there are 15369 children in Soda.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine collected three times as many cards as she had at the beginning (20 x 3 = 60).  In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month (60 - 20 = 40).  In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as in the first and second months combined (40 + 40 = 80).  Therefore, Elaine has 80 Pokémon cards.
"Response:  First, we know that Mark edits 1000 sentences per week for both publishers.  Second, we know that Publisher A pays Mark double what Publisher B pays him.  Finally, we are told that Publisher A pays Mark $ 5 per sentence.  So let's start with the calculation of how much Publisher A pays Mark:  
$ 5 x 1000 = $ 5,000  Now we need to find out how much Publisher B pays Mark. Since he pays double what Publisher A pays, we can calculate it as follows:  
$ 5,000 x 2 = $ 10,000  Therefore, in one week, Mark earns $ 10,000 from Publisher B and $ 5,000 from Publisher A, for a total of:  
$ 10,000 + $ 5,000 = $ 15,000  In one week, Mark earns $ 15,000."
Response:  First, we know that Baldur gets 5 cante of water in the morning and 6 cante of water in the afternoon. We also know that each cante contains 5 liters of water. So, to find out how many liters of water Baldur gets per day, we need to multiply the number of cante he receives with the amount of water in each cante.  Morning: 5 x 5 = 25 liters Afternoon: 6 x 5 = 30 liters Total: 25 + 30 = 55 liters Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water per day.
Response:  First, we know that John will receive $5000 as a one-time cash bonus and his salary will be increased by 5%. So, if he earns $2000 per week (or $104,000 per year), his new salary after the bonus and pay increase would be: New Salary = Old Salary x (1 + 0.05) = $104,000 x (1 + 0.05) = $109,200 Now, let's calculate how much John will earn in a year with the new salary: Total Earnings = Number of Weeks x Weekly Salary Total Earnings = 52 weeks x $109,200 = $5,672,800 Since John receives the $5000 cash bonus at the beginning of the year, we need to subtract it from the total earnings: Total Earnings - Bonus = $5,672,800 - $5,000 = $5,667,800 Therefore, John will earn $5,667,800 in a year with the new salary and bonus.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many tons of grapes are produced on the farm each year:  
10 hectares x 5 tons/hectare = 50 tons/year  Next, we need to calculate how many liters of wine can be produced from those tons of grapes:  
50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels/year (since there are 33 liters in a barrel) Finally, we can calculate the total volume of wine produced on the farm each year:  
100 barrels x 33 liters/barrel = 3,300 liters/year So, the farm produces 3,300 liters of wine per year."
Response:  First, we know that Carlo has used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich for lunch every day this week, so he has used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese in total for lunches.  Next, we know that he has made an omelette with cheese and eggs three mornings this week, using one more slice of cheese than before (since he had already used two slices for the sandwich), so he has used 3 x 2 = 6 additional slices of cheese for the omelettes.  Finally, we are told that he has made a large macaroni dish with cheese that lasted him several evenings, but we don't have enough information to determine how many slices of cheese were used for that.  Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carlo has used this week is:  14 + 6 = 20  So, Carlo has used 20 slices of cheese this week.
"Response:  First, we know that Janet had 22 green and 10 yellow markers. Then she bought 6 packs of blue markers with 9 each (for a total of 54) and 2 packs of red markers with 6 each (for a total of 12). So in total, Janet has:  
22 + 10 = 32 green markers 54 blue markers x 9 = 486 blue markers 12 red markers Total number of markers: 32 + 486 + 12 = 530 markers"
Response:  First, we need to calculate the average of the first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458. Then, we divide that number by 5 to get the mean (average) of the first five tests: 458 / 5 = 91.6. Since Brinli can drop her lowest score, she needs to get at least 93 on the sixth test to achieve an overall average of 93.
Response:  First, we know that Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week for four weeks, so he rode his bike at least 4 x 5 = 20 times in total.  Second, we know that each time he rode his bike, he traveled at least 25 kilometers, so he traveled at least 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers in total.  Third, we know that after four weeks, Michael started riding his bike only twice a week, but he doubled the distance of each ride, so he rode 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers per week.  Finally, we know that Michael rode his bike for three weeks with this new schedule, so he rode 3 x 120 = 360 kilometers in total during those three weeks.  Therefore, the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike is:  500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.
Response:  First, we know that there are 25 chocolate candies and 80 candy apples in Joe's bag. Since each chocolate candy weighs twice as much as one candy apple, we can start by finding out how many grams of chocolate candies there are.  There are 25 chocolate candies x 2 = 50 grams of chocolate candies.  Now, let's find out how many grams of candy apples there are. There are 80 candy apples x 1 gram per candy apple = 80 grams of candy apples.  So, in total, Joe's bag contains 50 + 80 = 130 grams of candy.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 colaccos.  On Tuesday, she bought three times more than on Monday, so she bought 4 x 3 = 12 colaccos.  On Wednesday, she bought five times more than on Tuesday, so she bought 12 x 5 = 60 colaccos.  Therefore, in total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 colaccos.
Response:  Firstly, we know that half of the total cost of the set is $6000 (since each cup costs $6000). Therefore, the total cost of the set is twice this amount, or $12,000. Now, if twenty cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of the set, then the cost of each cup must be:  Cost per cup = Total cost of set - Cost of 20 cups  = $12,000 - $1200  = $10,800 per cup.  So, the cost of each cup is $10,800.
Response:  First, we know that Sara wants to buy a new jacket and two pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. So in total, she needs $30 + $20 + $20 = $70.  Next, we know that Sara earns $5 for every time she watches her neighbor's dog. She has already saved $10 before starting to babysit the dog. So let's subtract the amount she has saved from the total cost: $70 - $10 = $60.  Now, we need to find out how many times Sara needs to watch the dog to save enough money to buy everything. We can divide the remaining cost ($60) by the amount she earns per session ($5): $60 / $5 = 12.  Therefore, Sara needs to watch the dog 12 times to save enough money to buy the jacket and two pairs of shoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of eggs collected daily is 42. Secondly, we know that the red hens lay 3 eggs per day and white hens lay 5 eggs per day. So, if we let X be the number of red hens, then the total number of eggs laid by red hens would be 3X. Similarly, if we let Y be the number of white hens, then the total number of eggs laid by white hens would be 5Y. Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:  3X + 5Y = 42... (1) Since there are two more white hens than red hens, we know that the ratio of white hens to red hens is 2:1. Therefore, we can write: Y = 2X... (2) Substituting (2) into (1), we get:  3X + 5(2X) = 42 3X + 10X = 42 13X = 42  X = 3  So, there are 3 red hens. Therefore, there are 6 white hens (since there are two more white hens than red hens).
"Response:  First, we need to convert miles to meters. There are 1609.34 meters in one mile, so:  
1.5 miles = 1.5 x 1609.34 meters = 2414 meters  Now, let's calculate the time it takes to walk this distance at a speed of 5 kilometers per hour (which is equivalent to 5000 meters per hour):  Time = Distance / Speed  Time = 2414 meters / 5000 meters/hour = 0.4828 hours or approximately 29 minutes and 14 seconds."
Response:  First day, there were 100 customers. Second day, there were 50 more than first day, so second day had 100 + 50 = 200 customers. Third day, there were 50 more than second day, so third day had 200 + 50 = 250 customers. Therefore, on the third day, there were 250 customers.
Response:  We know that the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool at all times.  So if the large pool starts with x gallons of water and loses 4x gallons per minute, it will be empty in 4 minutes.  The small pool also starts with x gallons of water and loses 4x gallons per minute, so it too will be empty in 4 minutes.  Therefore, after 4 minutes, both pools are empty.  Since the small pool started with half as much water as the large pool (since it holds only half as much), it contains 1/2x gallons of water initially.  Thus, the amount of water in the small pool now is 1/2x gallons.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Lori needs in total for the shoes and belt.  Shoes cost $320 and belt costs $32, so together they cost $352. Since her job pays her $8 per hour, she needs to work for: $$ \frac {352}{8} = 44 hours $$  Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy both items.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much interest Janet will pay over 12 months.  To do this, we can multiply the principal amount (2000) by the monthly interest rate (10%). This gives us an annual interest rate of 120 (2000 x 10%). Now, let's divide the annual interest rate by 12 to get the monthly interest rate: Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12 Monthly interest rate = 120 / 12 Monthly interest rate = 10 So, Janet will pay $10 in interest each month. Next, we need to calculate the total amount that Janet will pay over 12 months. We can add the principal amount ($2000) to the monthly interest payment ($10): Total amount paid = Principal + Interest Total amount paid = 2000 + (10 x 12) Total amount paid = 2000 + 120 Total amount paid = 2120 Finally, we can subtract the total amount paid from the original principal amount to find out what Janet's remaining balance will be after 12 months: Remaining balance = Principal - Amount paid Remaining balance = 2000 - 2120 Remaining balance = -120 Janet's remaining balance after 12 months will be negative $120, indicating that she will still owe $120 to the lender.
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more than roses. So we can start with the equation:  4 + 7 =?  Now we add 4 and 7:  4 + 7 = 11  Therefore, there are 11 flowers in the vase.
"Response:  First we know that Adrian is three years older than Harriet and Harriet is half as old as Zack. So if Harriet is currently 21 years old, what are their ages?  We can start with Adrian's age. Since he is three years older than Harriet, Adrian is 21 + 3 = 24 years old. Now let's find out how old Zack is. Since Harriet is half as old as Zack, Zack must be twice as old as Harriet. Therefore, Zack is 2 x 21 = 42 years old.  Finally, we need to calculate the average age of the three over the next three years. To do this, we add their current ages and divide by three. The sum of their current ages is:  
Adrian - 24  
Harriet - 21  
Zack - 42  
Adding these numbers gives us:  
24 + 21 + 42 = 87  
Dividing by three gives us:  
87 / 3 = 29  
So the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack over the next three years will be 29 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Naomi scored 68 points. Secondly, we know that Jurij scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which is equal to 68/2 = 34 points. Thirdly, we know that Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, which is equal to 68 + 17 = 85 points. Finally, we can calculate Jojo's score as follows: Total score = Naomi's score + Jurij's score + Brianna's score = 68 + 34 + 85 = 297 points. Therefore, Jojo scored 297 - 68 = 229 points.
Response:  Firstly, she spent 10 minutes solving crosswords and 5 minutes solving Sudoku puzzles. So, in total, she spent 10 + 5 = 15 minutes playing these games.
"Response:  First, we know that Celina used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is equal to the capacity of the tank minus the amount of water used by Celina. In this case, the capacity of the tank is 120 liters, and Celina used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:  
120 - 90 = 30 liters.  Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank."
Response:  We know that Andy planted fewer petunias than geraniums. So if he planted x geraniums, he must have planted x - 40 petunias.  Since there are 90 geraniums in total, we can set up the equation:  x + (x - 40) = 90.  Simplifying this equation gives us: 2x - 40 = 90.  Solving for x gives us: x = 50.  Therefore, Andy planted 50 geraniums and 50 - 40 = 10 petunias.
Response:  First year, company spends $15,000 on advertising. Second year, they spend one-third of that amount, which is $5,000 (since one-third of $15,000 is $5,000). So, in total, the company spent $20,000 on advertising over two years ($15,000 + $5,000).
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Carlos will pay for his canoe rental.  If he uses it for 3 hours, and the rent is $30 per hour, then he will pay:  
Carlos' cost = $30 x 3 hours = $90  Next, let's calculate how much Benji will pay for his paddleboat rental.  If he uses it for 5 hours, and the rent is $18 per hour, then he will pay:  
Benji's cost = $18 x 5 hours = $90  Now that we have calculated their individual costs, we can add them up to find out how much they will pay in total.  Total cost = Carlos' cost + Benji's cost = $90 + $90 = $180"
"Response:  If Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester and back using both bus and car, he will spend 6 days traveling by bus and half as many days (3 days) driving his car. Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will spend on this trip is:  
6 + 3 = 9 days."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many water cards James has after losing 8 of them. Then, we can subtract that number from his total number of cards to find out how many cards he has left. Finally, we can divide the remaining cards by the new total to get the probability of a randomly selected card being a water type.  
So, let's start with calculating how many water cards James loses:  
8 water cards x 1 card per 2 water cards = 4 cards lost  
Now, we subtract the lost cards from James' original number of water cards:  
30 water cards - 4 cards = 26 water cards left  
Next, we add the new cards James buys:  
26 water cards + 14 grass cards = 40 cards total  
Finally, we divide the remaining water cards by the total number of cards to get the probability of a randomly selected card being a water type:  
26/40 = 0.65 or 65%"
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of the basic burrito: 6.50 x 1 = 6.50 dollars. Next, let's add extra ingredients: 2 x 2 = 4 dollars for meat, 1 x 1 = 1 dollar for cheese, and 1 x 1 = 1 dollar for avocado. Total cost so far is: 6.50 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 13 dollars. Now, she wants to upgrade her meal with chips and drink, which will cost an additional 3 dollars. So, the final total is: 13 + 3 = 16 dollars. However, she has a gift card worth 5 dollars that she can use towards her bill, leaving her balance as follows: 16 - 5 = 11 dollars.
Response: 1) Kalinda can add 4 pieces in one minute, so she will have 4 x 60 = 240 pieces after one hour. 2) Her mother can set half as much as Kalinda, so her mother will have 240 / 2 = 120 pieces after one hour. 3) Since they both work at the same rate, it will take them the same amount of time to finish the puzzle. Therefore, it will take them 240 / 2 = 120 hours or 5 days to complete the puzzle together.
Response:  First, we know that Ashlyn collected 30% of the total number of watermelons after two months, which is 30% x 120 = 36 watermelons.  Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later, we can find out how many watermelons were not ready yet by subtracting the ones Ashlyn collected from the total number of watermelons.  Total watermelons - Watermelons collected = Number of watermelons not ready for harvest 120 - 36 = 84 So, there were 84 watermelons not ready for harvest after two weeks.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all cars without taxes and registration fees: Total Cost = Number of Cars x Price per Car = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000 Next, we need to calculate the tax amount based on the total cost: Tax Amount = Total Cost x Tax Rate (10%) = $240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000 Finally, we add the tax amount to the total cost to get the final price paid for all cars: Final Price = Total Cost + Tax Amount = $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000 So, Mark will pay $264,000 for his fleet of 12 cars after adding the tax and registration fees.
Response:  Firstly, in Monday, Kajli collected 5 more shells than Robert, so Robert collected 20 - 5 = 15 shells. Secondly, in Tuesday, Kajli collected twice as many shells as she did in Monday, so she collected 2 x (5) = 10 shells. Therefore, Kajli collected 10 + 15 = 25 shells in Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 bees in the garden and Dax found half as many wasps as bees, then he found 25 wasps (half of 50).  So, if there were 25 wasps in the garden, that means there were 50 - 25 = 25 more insects in the garden than just wasps. Since we know that there were 50 bees, these additional insects must have been other types of insects besides wasps and bees. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 50 + 25 = 75.
Response:  First, we know that 1/3 of the pingvinas (36) are skipping and swimming in the ocean. That means there are 36 x 2 = 72 pingvinas left.  Next, we know that another 1/3 of the remaining pingvinas (72) enter the cave to eat dinner. So, there are 72 x 2 = 144 pingvinas left.  Finally, we want to find out how many pingvinas are left to bask in the sun. We can do this by subtracting the number of pingvinas who entered the cave from the total number of pingvinas left: 144 - 72 = 72.  Therefore, there are 72 pingvinas left to bask in the sun.
Response:  First, we know that Steve eats 2 times more than his girlfriend. So if she eats x paradajz per day, he eats 2x paradajz per day. We also know that he eats 6 days a week (not on Sundays). Therefore, his daily consumption is 2x paradajz/day x 6 days/week = 12x paradajz/week. Now, we need to find out how many lozas of paradajz Steve needs per week. Since each loza contains 3 paradajz, we can calculate as follows: 12x paradajz/week / 3 paradajz/loza = 4 lozas/week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John has 20 friends and he wants to give each of them 4 slices of pizza. Secondly, pizzas are sold in 8-slice portions only. So, we need to find out how many pizzas John needs to buy. To do this, we can divide the total number of slices required (20 x 4 = 80) by the size of each portion (8): 80 / 8 = 10 Therefore, John needs to buy 10 pizzas.
Response:  Firstly, if he mixes the ink from five empty bottles into one full bottle, then he will have six bottles of ink (one full and five half-full).  If he buys 25 empty bottles and uses them to make new ones when they run out of ink, he will need three batches of ink (since 25 / 6 = 4 with remainder 1).  Therefore, after using all 25 empty bottles, he will have 3 x 6 = 18 full bottles of ink.
Response:  First, we know that John took his $20 savings and added another $10 to make a total of $30. Next, he invested this amount, which doubled in value over the course of a year. So, after one year, John had twice as much money - or $60.
Response:  First, we know that Joan is five years older than Jessica, so if Jessica is 20 years old, then Joan must be 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Next, we know that Meri is two years younger than Joan, so if Joan is 25 years old, then Meri must be 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  Therefore, the total age of the three girls is: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 1000 students in the school.  After the meeting, 30% of them left through exit A, which is 300 students (since 30% of 1000 is 300).  Now, we have 700 students remaining in the school.   Of these 700 students, 3/5 (or 60%) left through exit B, which is 420 students (since 60% of 700 is 420).  Finally, we have 280 students remaining in the school who left through exit C (since 280 = 700 - 420).  So, the number of students who left through exit C is 280.
Response:  First, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So if Robert has x candies, James has x + 6 candies.  Next, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So if Robert has x candies, John has 2x candies. Finally, we are told that John has 54 candies in total.  So we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + (x + 6) = 54  Simplifying the equation:  2x + 6 = 54  Solving for x:  2x = 54 - 6  2x = 48   x = 24  Therefore, James has 24 candies and John has 48 candies.
Response: 1. If Dolly reads her two books and Pandora reads one book each day, how many days will it take for them to finish reading their respective books?  2. After they finish reading their own books, they will start reading each other's books. How many more days will it take for them to read all the books together?  To find out, we need to know how many books each of them has and how long it takes for them to read one book.  So let's assume that Dolly's books are of equal length (call it x days) and Pandora's book is also of equal length (also x days). Then:  3. For Dolly, it will take x days to read both of her books.  4. For Pandora, it will take x days to read her one book.  5. Once they both finish reading their own books, they will start reading each other's books. It will take Dolly x days to read Pandora's book, and Pandora x days to read Dolly's books.  6. Therefore, in total, it will take them x + x = 2x days to read all the books together.  So the answer is 2x days.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Mike writes two letters per week to each of his five friends (so 10 letters in total). Each letter is five pages long and takes him six minutes to write. Therefore, the time it takes Mike to write one letter is:  
Time per letter = 6 minutes/letter  
Now, let's calculate how many hours Mike spends writing letters per week:  
Total time per week = Time per letter x Number of letters written per week  
= 6 minutes/letter x 10 letters/week  
= 60 minutes/week  
Therefore, Mike spends 60 minutes per week writing letters. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:  
Hours spent writing per week = Total time per week / 60  
= 60 minutes/week / 60  
= 1 hour/week"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason has a monthly plan of 1000 minutes. Secondly, he has 15-minute daily calls with his boss, which means he spends 450 minutes (15 x 30) on these calls per month. Thirdly, there were 300 additional minutes of calls with other people this month, so the total number of minutes spent on calls is:  450 + 300 = 750 minutes. Finally, since there are 30 days in this month, Jason has a remaining balance of:  1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that Kyle took 5 pomfrits from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 pomfrits left.  Next, we know that Billy took double the number of pomfrits that Kyle took, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 pomfrits.  Now, we know that Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 pomfrits left.  Finally, we know that Colby took 3 fewer than the number of pomfrits that Kyle took, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 pomfrits.  Therefore, the total number of pomfrits that Ginger gave to Griffin is 9 + 2 = 11.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 puzeva in one aquarium and 32 puzeva in another. The difference between the number of puzeva in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So we can write an equation based on this information:  
Let x be the number of fish in the first aquarium (4 puzeva) and y be the number of fish in the second aquarium (32 puzeva). Then we have:  
x + y = 4 + 32 (since each aquarium has 4 and 32 puzeva, respectively)  
2x + 2y = 8 + 64 (by adding the two equations)  
2x + 2y - 8 - 64 = 0 (by simplifying the equation)  
2(x + y) = 12 (by solving for x + y)  
x + y = 6 (by dividing both sides by 2)  
Therefore, there are 6 fish in each aquarium."
Response:  First, we know that Jean pays $250 per hour for her makeup artist. Next, we know that she needs to spend 6 hours each day (or 36 hours total) getting ready for the film shoots, and she has to do this 4 times a week (for a total of 144 hours). Finally, we know that the film takes 5 weeks to finish (or 5 x 7 = 35 days), so Jean will need to pay her makeup artist for a total of 35 days x 144 hours = 4800 hours. Now, we can calculate the total amount Jean will pay her makeup artist: 4800 hours x $250/hour = $120,000. So, Jean will pay her makeup artist $120,000 in total.
Response:  First, we know that Isabelle spent $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 = $74 on all the items for her sister's birthday party. She also paid $22 for bags for guests, so the total amount she spent is $74 + $22 = $96. Since she wants to split the cost with her parents, we can divide $96 by three: $96 ÷ 3 = $32 per person. So each of her parents paid $32, and Isabelle paid $32 as well.
Response:  First, we know that each bucket of lettuce costs $1.50.  Second, we know that Kuvars bought four buckets of lettuce.  So, if we multiply the cost per bucket by the number of buckets he bought, we get:  4 x $1.50 = $6.00  Therefore, Kuvars spent $6.00 on lettuce.
"Response:  First, we know that Sue ate 4 times more cake than her sister on Monday (M). So if her sister ate x cakes, Sue ate 4x cakes.  On Tuesday (T), Sue ate twice as much cake as her sister, so she ate 2(x) cakes.  We also know that Sue's total consumption of cake for both days is 13 cakes.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on this information:  
M + T = 13... (1)  Since Sue ate 4 times more cake than her sister on Monday, we can write:  
Sue's Monday intake = 4 x Sister's Monday intake... (2)  Substituting (2) into (1):  
4x + 2x = 13... (3)  Simplifying (3):   8x = 13... (4)  Dividing both sides by 8:  
x = 16... (5)  Now we have found out how many cakes Sue's sister ate on Monday:  
Sister's Monday intake = x = 16... (6)  Next, we need to find out how many calories Sue consumed in total:  
Total calories = Number of cakes x Calories per cake... (7)  Using (6) and (7):  
Total calories = 4x + 2x x 200... (8)  Substituting (6) and (8):  
Total calories = 4(16) + 2(16) x 200... (9)  Simplifying (9):  
Total calories = 64 + 320 = 384... (10)  Finally, we can calculate the difference between Sue's and her sister's calorie intake:  
Difference = Total calories - Sister's calorie intake... (11)  Substituting (10) and (6):  
Difference = 384 - 16 = 368... (12)  Therefore, Sue consumed 3"
