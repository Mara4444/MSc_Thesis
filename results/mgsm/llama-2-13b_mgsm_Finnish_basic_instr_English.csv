"Response:  To calculate how much money Janet makes daily, we need to consider her income from selling eggs and her expenses for food and other items. Let's break down the information given in the question:  
Income from selling eggs:  
* She sells 16 dozen eggs per day at $2 each = $32 per day  
Expenses:  
* She eats three meals a day (assuming $5 per meal) = $15 per day  
* She buys muffins for her friends every day (assuming $4 per muffin x 4 people) = $16 per day  
Total expenses: $15 + $16 = $31 per day Now, let's subtract her expenses from her income: Income - Expenses = $32 - $31 = $1 per day So, Janet makes $1 per day or $30 per month."

"Response:  If the value of the house increased by 150% after Josh spent $50,000 on renovations, then the current value of the house is:

Value of the house = Original price + (Original price x Percentage increase)
= $80,000 + ($80,000 x 150%)
= $80,000 + $120,000
= $200,000

So, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000."

Response:  To determine how many cups of food Wendi needs to give her chickens in the last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total number of cups of food she gives them per day and then divide that by the number of chickens she has. Let's start by calculating the total number of cups of food she gives them per day:  3 x 15 = 45 cups (morning feeding) + 25 x 3 = 75 cups (afternoon feeding) = 120 cups per day Now, let's divide the total number of cups by the number of chickens she has: 120 cups / 20 chickens = 6 cups per chicken So, Wendi needs to give each of her 20 chickens 6 cups of food in the last meal of the day.
"Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for the 16 glasses, we need to calculate the total cost of all the glasses first. Since each glass costs $5, the total cost of 16 glasses would be:  
Total Cost = Number of Glasses x Price per Glass  
Total Cost = 16 x $5  
Total Cost = $80  
However, since every other glass costs only 60% of the price, the cost of the remaining 8 glasses (which are not every other one) will be:  
Cost of Remaining Glasses = Total Cost x Percentage Discount  
Cost of Remaining Glasses = $80 x 40%  
Cost of Remaining Glasses = $32  
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay a total of $80 + $32 = $112 for the 16 glasses."
Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: 1) Toulouse has twice as many streetlights as Charleston. 2) Charleston has four times as many streetlights as Seattle. 3) Seattle has 20 streetlights. Using this information, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the situation:  Let T be the number of streetlights in Toulouse, C be the number of streetlights in Charleston, and S be the number of streetlights in Seattle. Based on the first statement, we know that T = 2C. Based on the second statement, we know that C = 4S. Finally, we know that S = 20. Substituting these expressions into each other, we get:  T = 2(4S) = 8S Now we need to find the value of T (the number of streetlights in Toulouse). Plugging in S = 20, we get:  T = 8(20) = 160 So there are 160 streetlights in Toulouse. Similarly, we can find the number of streetlights in Charleston:  C = 4(20) = 80 And finally, we can find the number of streetlights in Seattle:  S = 20 To summarize: There are 160 streetlights in Toulouse, 80 streetlights in Charleston, and 20 streetlights in Seattle.
"Response:  To calculate how much time is needed to download a 200 GB file with a downloading speed of 2 GB/minute and a 40% packet loss rate, we need to first calculate the total amount of data that needs to be downloaded.

200 GB x (1 - 0.4) = 120 GB

Next, we can calculate the time it takes to download this amount of data at a speed of 2 GB/minute:

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Therefore, it would take approximately 60 minutes (or 1 hour) to download a 200 GB file with a 40% packet loss rate."
"Response:  Let's break down the problem into its components:  
* First two hours (2 x 60 = 120 km) +  
* Next half hour (30 miles / 60 minutes = 5 km/hour) x 30 minutes = 15 km +  
* Last four hours (4 x 60 = 240 km) at 80 km/hour = 192 km  
Total distance traveled = 120 + 15 + 192 = 327 km  
So, after four hours, John is 327 kilometers away from home."
"Response:  To calculate how much Elisa has earned in this week, we need to add her regular hourly wage for the first 40 hours worked and her overtime pay for the additional 5 hours worked. First, let's calculate her regular hourly wage for the first 40 hours:  
Regular hourly wage = $10/hour x 40 hours = $400 Next, let's calculate her overtime pay for the additional 5 hours worked: Overtime pay = $10/hour x 5 hours = $50 Now, let's add her regular hourly wage and overtime pay to get her total earnings for the week: Total earnings = $400 + $50 = $450 Therefore, Elisa has earned $450 in this week."
"Response:  The number of downloaded programs during the three months can be calculated as follows:

Month 1: 60 downloads
Month 2: 3 x (60 + 60) = 3 x 120 = 360 downloads

Therefore, there were 60 + 360 + 252 = 672 downloads during the three months."
"Response:  To calculate how much Toula paid in total for all of her baked goods, we need to multiply the number of items she purchased by their respective prices per unit. Let's do this step by step:

1. Donuts: 3 tusinaa x $68/tusina = $204
2. Mini cupcakes: 2 tusinaa x $80/tusina = $160
3. Mini juustokakkua: 6 tusinaa x $55/tusina = $330

Adding up these amounts gives us a total cost of:
$204 + $160 + $330 = $794

Therefore, Toula paid a total of $794 for all of her baked goods."
Response:  To calculate how many years it takes for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to consider two factors: the cost of planting and maintaining the tree, and the revenue generated by selling the lemons. Let's break down the costs first: Planting the tree costs $90, and annual maintenance (watering and fertilizing) costs $3. Now, let's look at the revenue: The tree produces 7 lemons per year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.50. So, the total revenue per year is: Revenue = 7 x $1.50 = $10.50 However, we need to subtract the maintenance costs, so the net profit per year is: Net Profit = Revenue - Maintenance Costs = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 Since Carlos wants to start making money from the tree, we need to find out when the net profit will exceed the initial investment ($90). We can do this by dividing the initial investment by the net profit: Years to Break Even = Initial Investment / Net Profit = $90 / $7.50 = 12 years After 12 years, the tree will have generated enough revenue to cover the initial investment, and Carlos will start making a profit.

100% - (20% + 25%) = 100% - 45% = 55%  
Therefore, 55% of the students participated in hip-hop dance."
"Response:  To maximize profit, Kauppias should choose the $5000 worth of jewelry option because it has a higher potential return than the electronics option. Here's the calculation:

Option 1 (Jewelry):
Current price = $5000 x 1 + 0.025 = $5000 x 1.025 = $5125
Profit = $5125 - $5000 = $125

Option 2 (Electronics):
Current price = $8000 x 1 + 0.012 = $8000 x 1.012 = $8096
Profit = $8096 - $8000 = $96

Since Option 1 has a higher profit ($125) than Option 2 ($96), Kauppias should choose the jewelry option to maximize his profit."
Response:  The total distance traveled by both trains in two days is 80 miles (westward) + 240 kilometers (northward) = 320 km. Since each train travels for one day in each direction, the length of each train is half of this distance, or 160 km.
Response:  To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to first calculate her weekly earnings as an instructor and then add her weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach.  Weekly Earnings as Instructor:  35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week Weekly Earnings as Cheerleading Coach:  15 hours/week x $20/hour = $300/week Total Weekly Earnings:  $700 + $300 = $1,000/week Now, let's calculate Jill's annual salary by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works per year:  Annual Salary = $1,000/week x 50 weeks/year = $50,000/year
Response:  If Claire eats three eggs every morning and there are four weeks in a month, then she eats 3 x 28 = 84 eggs per month (since there are 28 days in April). Therefore, she eats 84 x 4 = 336 eggs in four weeks.
Response:  To find out what speed Marissa needs to walk at to cover the remaining distance of 4 miles in 30 minutes, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (speed), and t is the time taken. We know that Marissa walked for 1 hour and covered 4/5 of the total distance, so she has 4 miles left to cover. Let's assume that she wants to maintain an average speed of 6 kilometers per hour throughout her journey. Since there are 1.60934 kilometers per mile, we can convert the distance from miles to kilometers as follows: 4 miles x 1.60934 km/mile = 6.43736 km. Now, we can plug in the values into the formula: d = rt, where d = 6.43736 km, r = 6 km/h, and t = 30 min. Solving for d, we get: d = rt = 6 km/h x 30 min = 18.64 km. Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of approximately 18.64 kilometers per hour to cover the remaining distance of 4 miles in 30 minutes.
"Response:  There are 10 liters of orange juice that is two-thirds water and 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three-fifths water. After adding them together, there will be 24 liters of juice in total. To find out how much water is left after adding one liter of apple juice to the mixture, we need to calculate the proportion of water in the final mixture. Let's assume that the proportion of water in the final mixture is x/y, where x is the amount of water in the apple juice (one liter) and y is the total volume of the final mixture (24 liters). We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

x/3 + 15/5 = 24/y

Solving for y, we get:

y = 36

So, there will be 36 liters of juice in total after adding one liter of apple juice to the mixture. Now, let's calculate the proportion of water in the final mixture:

x/3 + 15/5 = 24/36

Simplifying, we get:

x/3 + 5 = 8

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7

Therefore, there will be 7 liters of water left in the final mixture after adding one liter of apple juice."

Response:  Let's say there are x bottles in the crate. According to the first friend, there are 80 bottles. According to the second friend, there are 20 more than half of the first amount, which is 20 + (half of 80) = 20 + 40 = 60 bottles. According to the third friend, there are 25% more than the first amount, which is 1.25x = 1.25(80) = 100 bottles. Therefore, the average of their estimates is (80 + 60 + 100)/3 = 70 bottles per crate.

Response:  If Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes and got 25% more points in the next 20 minutes, then he scored (4 x 1.25) = 5 points in the second 20 minutes. Therefore, his total score is 4 + 5 = 9 points.
Response:  If Terry eats two yogurt per day and each yogurt costs $2, then he spends $2 x 2 = $4 per day on yogurt. Since there are 30 days in a month, Terry spends $4 x 30 = $120 on yogurt for the entire month.
Response:  Let's start by identifying the information we have:  * John has 13 Lego series that he is selling for $15 each.  * He is buying 8 video games for $20 each.  * He has $5 left over after buying the video games.  To find out how many Legos John has left, we need to subtract the number of video games he bought from the total number of Legos he had:  Total number of Legos = 13 x 15 = 195  Number of video games = 8 x 20 = 160  So, we can calculate how many Legos John has left like this: 195 - 160 = 35  Therefore, John has 35 Legos left.
Response:  To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed for each day and then add them up. Let's break it down:  Day 1: John runs for 3 hours (3 x 60 = 180 minutes) at a constant speed. Since he runs for 3 days, we multiply the total distance by 3 to get the weekly distance:  Weekly distance = 3 x 180 = 540 minutes  Now, let's calculate John's average speed for each day:  Day 1: Average speed = Total distance / Time = 540 / 3 = 180 minutes per hour  Day 2: Average speed = Total distance / Time = 540 / 2 = 270 minutes per hour  Day 3: Average speed = Total distance / Time = 540 / 2 = 270 minutes per hour  Finally, we add up all three daily averages to get John's overall average speed for the week:  Overall average speed = 180 + 270 + 270 = 620 minutes per hour  Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 620 minutes per hour, or approximately 10.33 kilometers per hour.
"Response:  To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of her time jogging and two-thirds of her time walking, we need to first calculate how far she can travel in one hour while jogging and walking separately.  Since she can jog at four times the speed of walking, she can cover 4x = 4 \* 3 = 12 miles per hour while jogging.  And since she can walk at half the speed of jogging, she can cover  
2/3 \* 12 = 8 miles per hour while walking.  Now, let's calculate how far she can travel in six hours:  While jogging:  6 hours \* 12 miles/hour = 72 miles  While walking:  6 hours \* 8 miles/hour = 48 miles  Total distance traveled: 72 + 48 = 120 miles  So, Dana can travel 120 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of her time jogging and two-thirds of her time walking."

Response:  To calculate how many grams of food you can eat, we need to know your daily calorie intake and how much you have already eaten. If your daily calorie intake is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories, then you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the day. Since each serving of the food in the bag contains 250 calories, you can eat 200 / 250 = 4 servings or 4 x 300g = 1200g of food.
Response:  To find out Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles at $2 each, we need to calculate the total revenue and then subtract the cost of making one candle. Total Revenue = 20 x $2 = $40 Cost per candle = $1/10 (since he can make 10 candles with 1 kg of wax) = $0.10 Net Profit = Total Revenue - Cost per candle = $40 - $0.10 = $39 So Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles at $2 each is $39.

"Response:  To find out how much John paid for his red ties, we need to use the information that he bought twice as many red ties as blue ones and that the price of each red tie is 50% more than the price of each blue tie. Let's say he bought x red ties and 2x blue ties (since he bought twice as many blue ties). We know that the total cost of all the ties was $200, so we can set up an equation based on this:

Total Cost = (x + 2x) \* Price of one tie

where Price of one tie is either 40 or 60 dollars, depending on whether it's a blue or red tie. Since there are twice as many blue ties as red ties, we can simplify the equation like this:

Total Cost = (x + 2x) \* 40 + (2x) \* 60

Simplifying further gives us:

Total Cost = 3x \* 40 + 120

Now we just need to solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:

x = Total Cost / 3

Substituting Total Cost = 3x \* 40 + 120 gives us:

x = (3x \* 40 + 120) / 3

Solving for x gives us:

x = 80

So John paid $80 for his red ties."
"Response:  To find out how many pieces of wood Tracy got, we need to divide the length of the wooden stick (1 meter) by the length of the cut piece (15 centimeters). This gives us:

So Tracy got approximately 6 and two-thirds pieces of wood."
"Response:  There are 120 apartments in total (8 x 15 = 120). Of those, 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means there are 90 occupied apartments (120 x 3/4 = 90). The remaining 30 apartments are vacant or ""tyhjiä huoneistoja"" (empty apartments)."
"Response:  To find out how much Lloyd earns from selling eggs per week, we need to multiply the number of eggs he produces per day by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:  

252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week  
Since each dozen eggs costs $2, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total revenue from selling eggs is:  

1,764 eggs/week x $2/dozen = $35.36/week  
Therefore, Lloyd earns $35.36 per week from selling eggs."
Response:  If Tom's boat travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour during the time period from 13:00 to 14:00 and then returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour, he will take 2 hours to return. Calculation: Distance traveled = Speed x Time = 10 mi/h x 1 h = 10 miles Return journey distance = Speed x Time = 6 mi/h x 2 h = 12 miles Total time taken = Distance / Speed = 10 + 12 / 6 = 2 hours
Response:  To find out how many toys she needs to remove, we need to divide the weight of her books by the weight of each book. We know that her books weigh half a kilogram and her toys weigh half a kilogram as well. So if she removes 30 books (which is equal in weight to 30 x 0.5 kg = 15 kg), she will have removed enough weight for her toy box to be lighter by 15 kg - 15 kg = 0 kg! Therefore, she needs to remove 30 toys.
"Response:  The total income for the mechanic on Friday was higher because he had more customers (12 cars) than on Tuesday (6 trucks and 4 cars). To calculate the total income, we need to know how much each type of repair costs. For trucks, the cost is $60 per wheel, so for 6 trucks, the total income from truck repairs is:

6 x $60 = $360

For cars, the cost is $40 per wheel, so for 4 cars, the total income from car repairs is:

4 x $40 = $160

Therefore, the total income for the mechanic on Friday was:

$360 + $160 = $520

While on Tuesday, the total income was:

$60 x 6 = $360 + $40 x 4 = $160 = $520

So, the mechanic earned the same amount of money ($520) on both days."

"Response:  If Peter has $42 dollars per week and he spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn each time he goes to the movies, then he can go to the movies:  
$42 / ($7 + $7) = 42 / $14 = 3 times

So, Peter can go to the movies three times with his budget of $42 per week."
"Response:  The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 352 (calculation below).

Here's how to calculate it:

1. Total weight of the truck and its contents = 1760 kg (driver + empty truck) + x kg (boxes)
2. Maximum weight allowed on the bridge = 5000 kg
3. So, the total weight must be less than or equal to 5000 kg:

1760 kg + x kg <= 5000 kg

x kg < 3340 kg (since 1760 + x > 5000, we subtract 1760 from both sides)

x kg < 3340 kg / 5 kg/box (since each box weighs 5 kg)

x < 668 boxes (divide both sides by 5)

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 668."
"Response:  The final cost of Stephen's purchases is calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before adding any additional fees or taxes:
	* 2 x $10 = $20 (for the two shirts)
	* $20 + $15 = $35 (for the two pairs of shorts and one pair of pants)
	Total cost before additional fees or taxes: $35
2. Add the 25% service charge (as a percentage of the total cost):
	* $35 x 25% = $8.75
3. Add the $3 delivery fee:
	* Total cost with service charge and delivery fee: $35 + $8.75 + $3 = $46.75
4. Subtract the $4 discount for using the coupon code:
	* $46.75 - $4 = $42.75

Therefore, the final cost of Stephen's purchases after applying the coupon code is $42.75."

$50,000 / 12 = $4,167 per month."
"Response:  To find out how much money Aleena will have paid for her streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in the first half of the year and then subtract that amount from the full year's subscription fee. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Aleena pays $140 per month for her streaming service.
* The first six months of the year have already passed, and Aleena was charged $140 x 6 = $840 for those months.
* In the second half of the year, Aleena will be charged 10% less than the previous six months, so her monthly payment for the remaining six months will be $840 x 0.9 = $752.

Now let's add up the total amount Aleena will pay for the entire year:

$840 (first six months) + $752 (remaining six months) = $1,592

So, by the end of the year, Aleena will have paid a total of $1,592 for her streaming service."
Response:  To determine how far Sophia can drive with one tank of gasoline, we need to calculate the distance she can travel based on the amount of fuel in her tank and the fuel efficiency of her car. We know that her car has a capacity of 40 liters (L) of gasoline and that she traveled 160 kilometers (km) after her last fill-up. We also know that she needs to refill her tank with 4 gallons (G) of gasoline. Since there are approximately 3.785 liters per gallon, we can convert the volume of gasoline as follows: 4 G x 3.785 L/G = 15.14 L  Now, let's calculate the distance Sophia can travel based on the amount of fuel in her tank: Distance = Fuel Efficiency x Amount of Fuel Available Fuel Efficiency is typically measured in miles per gallon (mpg), so we need to convert the value from kilometers per liter (km/L) to mpg first: km/L x 100 / 3.785 = mpg  For example, if Sophia's car has a fuel efficiency of 25 km/L, then: 25 km/L x 100 / 3.785 = 67.9 mpg Now, we can calculate the distance Sophia can travel based on the amount of fuel available: Distance = Fuel Efficiency x Amount of Fuel Available Distance = 67.9 mpg x 15.14 L = 1021.6 km or approximately 635 miles So, Sophia can drive approximately 635 miles (1021.6 km) with one tank of gasoline.
Response:  To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading in four weeks, we need to calculate the time he spends on these activities each week and then multiply it by four.  Weekly time spent watching TV:  2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours per week Weekly time spent reading:  1 hour x 4 days = 4 hours per week Total weekly time spent on leisure activities:  6 + 4 = 10 hours per week Multiplying this by four gives us:  10 hours/week x 4 weeks = 40 hours In total, Jim spends 40 hours watching TV and reading over the course of four weeks.
Response:  There are four schools participating in the basketball tournament, and each school has both a boys' and girls' basketball team with five players each. Therefore, there are 4 x 2 = 8 teams in total. Additionally, each school has sent a coach for each team, so there are 4 x 2 = 8 coaches in total. So, in total, there are 8 + 8 = 16 people from the four schools who have been sent to the tournament.

"Response:  Let's call the initial amount of money that Bailey had ""x"". We know that after 8 weeks, Bailey has $100, so we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  

$100 = x + (5 x 8)  Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can simplify the equation as follows:  

$100 = x + (5 x 32)  Now we can solve for x by subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation:  

$100 - 5x = x + 32  Subtracting x from both sides gives us:  

-$x = 68  Dividing both sides by -1 gives us:  

x = -$68  So, Bailey had $68 at the beginning."

Response:  To calculate how much money Tommy will collect from selling brownies and juustokakkua, we need to multiply the number of items sold by their respective prices. For the brownies, Tommy will sell 43 x $3 = $139. For the juustokakkua, Tommy will sell 23 x $4 = $92. Therefore, Tommy will collect in total $139 + $92 = $231.
Response:  To calculate the monthly payment for three months, we need to use the formula for present value of a series of payments with a fixed interest rate. Let's assume that the interest rate is 2% per annum, and there are three equal payments of $150 each. The total amount paid at the end of three months will be:  PV = (3 x $150) x (1 + 0.02/12)^(3\*12) = $450 x (1 + 0.02/12)^(3\*12) = $450 x 1.02^36 = $489.76 So, Sheila needs to make three monthly payments of $489.76 each.
Response:  To find out how much Artie earns from selling flowers at the farmers market, we need to calculate the total amount of money he receives from each type of flower and then add it up.  First, let's convert all the prices to dollars per unit (dpu):  Kallisarvi: $2.74/ruukku = $2.74 dpu Petunia: $1.87/ruukku = $1.87 dpu Begonia: $2.12/ruukku = $2.12 dpu Now, let's multiply the number of units sold by the price per unit for each type of flower:  Kallisarvi: 12 ruukkua x $2.74 dpu = $33.08 Petunia: 9 ruukkua x $1.87 dpu = $16.93 Begonia: 17 ruukkua x $2.12 dpu = $35.94 Total revenue: $33.08 + $16.93 + $35.94 = $86.95 So, Artie earns $86.95 from selling flowers at the farmers market today.

Response:  To calculate how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in her first year, we need to know how many cups she needs per day and how many days she has in that period. We are given that she needs 1 cup per day for the first 180 days, so she will need 180 cups in total. Since one bag contains 110 cups, she will use 180/110 = 1.64 bags during this time.
Response:  If Sarah makes 400 kg of laundry and Jos Raymond makes as much as Sarah, then Jos Raymond makes 4 x 400 = 1600 kg of laundry.  If David makes 4 times as much as Sarah, then David makes 4 x 400 = 1600 kg of laundry.
"Response:  To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers in the better price, we need to calculate the total cost of 18 flowers at both prices and then compare them. Let's do that!

At $2.50 per 3-pack, the cost of 18 flowers would be:

18 x 3 = 54 dollars

At $1.00 per 2-pack, the cost of 18 flowers would be:

18 x 2 = 36 dollars

Now let's compare the two costs:

$54 (at $2.50 per 3-pack) - $36 (at $1.00 per 2-pack) = $18

So, Vincent saves $18 by buying 18 flowers in the better price of $1.00 per 2-pack instead of $2.50 per 3-pack."

Let's assume that an adult eats 10 kg of potato salad and a child eats half of that amount, or 5 kg.  Next, let's find out how many adults and children are attending the picnic:  There are 20 adults and 5 children. So, in total, there will be:  
Adults: 20 x 10 kg = 200 kg Potato Salad Children: 5 x 5 kg = 25 kg Potato Salad Total: 200 kg + 25 kg = 225 kg Therefore, Ted needs 225 kg of potato salad for the picnic."
Response:  If Janilla has three times as many pets as Marcia and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, then Janilla has 3 x 2 = 6 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, if Cindy has four pets, Janilla has 6 + 4 = 10 pets in total.
Response:  To find out how old Jackson is, we need to use the information that Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey. Let's start by finding out how old Amy is first. We know that Amy is five years older than Jackson, so if Jackson is x years old, then Amy is x + 5 years old. Since Amy is also two years younger than Corey, we can say that Amy is x + 5 - 2 years old. Now, we are given that James is ten years old and Corey is y years old, where y = 10 - x. Substituting these values into our equation for Amy's age, we get: x + 5 - 2 = y + 10. Solving this equation, we get: x = 8, which means that Jackson is eight years old.
Response:  To find out how fast Gerald can run 400 meters with his improved diet, we need to calculate the percentage increase in speed and then apply that percentage increase to Lee's time. Let's assume that Gerald's new speed is 10% faster than his original speed. So, if he originally ran 400 meters in x seconds, his new time would be (x + 10%) seconds. Now, let's plug in Lee's time of 38 seconds: If Gerald runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, his new time with the improved diet would be (38 + 10%) = 42.8 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can now run 400 meters in approximately 42.8 seconds with his improved diet.
Response:  There are 32 lemmikki pets in total in the neighborhood if there are two kissas for each dog and the number of dogs is 60.
Response:  There are 200 fifth-grade students, and two-thirds of them are boys. If two-thirds of the boys are in the scouting club, then two-thirds of the total number of students (200) is equal to twice the number of boys who are not in the scouting club. Therefore, there are 133 boys who are not in the scouting club. Since two-thirds of the girls are also in the scouting club, there are 67 girls who are not in the scouting club. In total, there are 133 + 67 = 200 students who are not in the scouting club.
Response:  Harry nukkui 9 x 2 = 18 tuntia enemmän kuin James (since James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept).
Response:  To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to know that each purple contains three tomatoes and that the final tomato puree was 30 grams. We can calculate the number of tomatoes as follows: Number of tomatoes = weight of tomato puree / weight of one tomato  Number of tomatoes = 30 g / 10 g (since one tomato weighs approximately 10 g)  Number of tomatoes = 3 x 30 g / 10 g = 9 tomatoes Therefore, Freda used nine tomatoes in her last tomato puree.
Response:  There were 24 cars in traffic jam during the first 15 minutes.  Explanation:  If there were originally 30 cars on the motorway and five cars left early to avoid traffic congestion, then there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars remaining on the motorway at the start of the first 15-minute period. During this time, some cars passed through quickly (20 cars), leaving 25 - 20 = 5 cars that did not pass through quickly. However, since these 5 cars did not pass through quickly, they must have been part of the second group of cars that passed through during the next 15 minutes. Therefore, there were 24 cars in traffic congestion during the first 15 minutes (5 cars that did not pass through quickly + 19 cars that passed through during the second 15 minutes).
Response:  Based on the information provided, Maria has 2 x 40 = 80 windows in her large house with two big gardens. She received 18 new plants from the greenhouse yesterday and plans to give one plant to each of her friends and family members tomorrow. Therefore, Maria will have 80 - 18 = 62 plants left after giving away the plants.
Response:  Let's denote the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell as x. Since the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, the number of times the second friend pressed the doorbell is 4x. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell is 60 + 10 = 70. Therefore, the total number of times all four friends pressed the doorbell is 4x + 70. We are given that the sum of these numbers is equal to 60, so we can set up the equation:  4x + 70 = 60. Solving for x gives us:  x = 15. So, the first friend pressed the doorbell 15 times.
Response:  To determine how many pages Solo needs to read each day to finish all 39 pages in 4 days, we can use the following calculation: Total number of pages / Number of days = Daily page count. In this case, we have: 39 pages / 4 days = 9.75 pages per day (round up to 10 pages per day). Therefore, Solo needs to read approximately 10 pages per day to finish all 39 pages within 4 days.
Response:  To determine how many glasses of water John drinks per week, we need to know how many meals he has per day and how much water he drinks with each meal. Let's assume that John has three meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and he drinks one glass of water with each meal. This means John drinks 3 x 1 = 3 glasses of water per day. Since there are seven days in a week, John drinks 3 x 7 = 21 glasses of water per week.
Response:  To find out how many minutes it takes for the fog to cover the entire city, we need to divide the length of the city (42 miles) by the distance that the fog covers every third of a mile (1 mile / 3 = 0.33 miles). Therefore, it will take 42 miles / 0.33 miles = 126.67 minutes (or approximately 2 hours and 6 minutes) for the fog to cover the entire city.

Response:  Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday as x. We know that Frankie watched a total of seven hours of television during the week, so we can write an equation based on this information:  7 = x + 30 + 30 +... + 30 (where the dots indicate the number of episodes watched on Wednesday)  Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we can convert the equation to:  7 = x + 30(Wednesday episodes)  Now we need to find out how many Wednesday episodes were watched. We are given that Frankie finished her homework early on Thursday and watched two hours of television that night, so she must have watched at least two episodes of her favorite show on Wednesday:  2 = x + 30  Solving for x, we get:  x = 28  Therefore, Frankie watched 28 30-minute episodes of her favorite show on Wednesday.
Response:  Henry leipooi 110 keksiä viime vuonna.
Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline at $3 per gallon from the local filling station and then applies the company's offer of $20 per gallon for bulk purchases, they will have 10 x $3 = $30 worth of gasoline before applying the discount. After applying the discount, they will have $30 - $20 = $10 worth of gasoline left. Therefore, they will have 10 gallons of gasoline left after the purchase.
"Response:  To find out how many fruit roll-ups they eat on average, we need to first calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice have.  Then, we can divide that by the number of people eating them (2) to get the average amount each person eats.  So, let's start by calculating the total number of fruit roll-ups:  
Marcell has 3 x 14 = 42 fruit roll-ups  
Beatrice has 2 x 24 = 48 fruit roll-ups  
Total number of fruit roll-ups = 42 + 48 = 90  
Now, let's divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people eating them:  
Average number of fruit roll-ups per person = 90 / 2 = 45  
So, Marcell and Beatrice eat an average of 45 fruit roll-ups each."
Response:  To find out how much water was in the boat when Julia reached the shore, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the boat and then use that information to determine how much water was displaced. Let's start with the given information:  * The boat had 2 liters of water for every 10 meters it traveled.  * Julia traveled 20 jalan (1 jalan = 10 meters) before reaching the shore.  * The shore was 64 seconds away from where she started. Now let's do some calculations:  First, convert the distance traveled into meters: 20 jalan x 10 meters/jalan = 200 meters  Next, calculate how much water was displaced: 2 liters x 200 meters = 400 liters Finally, subtract the amount of water that was already in the boat at the starting point: 400 liters - 2 liters (the initial amount of water in the boat) = 398 liters So there were approximately 398 liters of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore.

"Response:  To find out how many ducks are in Jamal's phone compared to the number of pictures of ducks in British phones, we need to divide the total number of pictures in Jamal's phone by the number of pictures of ducks in British phones. We know that there are 6 times as many pictures in Jamal's phone as there are in British phones, so we can write: 

Total pictures in Jamal's phone = 6 x Number of pictures in British phones

We also know that there are 50 times as many pictures of ducks in British phones as there are in Jamal's phone, so we can write: 

Number of pictures of ducks in British phones = 50 x Number of pictures in Jamal's phone

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (the number of pictures in British phones and the number of ducks in Jamal's phone). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us: 

Number of pictures in British phones = 320

Number of ducks in Jamal's phone = 320 / 50 = 6.4

So there are approximately 6.4 ducks in Jamal's phone."
"Response:  To calculate the profit, we need to know how much Sasha paid for each piece of wood and how many pieces she has left. According to the information given, Sasha paid $10 per 2x4x10 board (10 dollars x 10 boards = $100) and $16 per 4x4x10 board ($16 x 5 boards = $80). In total, she spent $180. She has 10 2x4x10 boards and 5 4x4x10 boards left, so she has 10 + 5 = 15 boards left. If she sells all of them at the current price of $15 per board, her profit would be:  
Profit = Total amount received - Total amount spent  
= (15 x 15 boards) - $180  
= $225 - $180  
= $45  
Therefore, Sasha's profit is $45."
Response:  To find out how many teaspoons of sugar and water Katy used, we can set up a ratio based on the information given: 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water. Let's say she used x teaspoons of sugar and y cups of water. We know that x + y = 120 (total amount of sugar and water used). We also know that 7x = 13y (ratio of sugar to water). Now we can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination. After solving, we get x = 84 and y = 36. So Katy used 84 teaspoons of sugar and 36 cups of water.
Response:  To find out how much John paid in total for all six pairs of shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs he bought by the price per pair. Since he bought three pairs for each child (3 x 2 = 6), and the price per pair is $60, then: Total cost = 6 x $60 = $360.
Response:  The number of containers arrived on the second day is 10 (5 x 2).
"Response:  To find out what Adrien and Lyla's salaries were four years later, we need to calculate the percentage increase in their salaries and then apply that percentage increase to their original salaries. Let's assume that Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years ago (which is 30% higher than Lyla's salary). If Adrien's salary increased by 30%, his new salary would be:

New Salary = Old Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase)
= $40,000 x (1 + 0.30)
= $40,000 x 1.30
= $52,000

Lyla's salary also increased by 30%, so her new salary would be:

New Salary = Old Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase)
= $28,000 x (1 + 0.30)
= $28,000 x 1.30
= $36,400

Therefore, Adrien's salary four years later was $52,000, and Lyla's salary was $36,400."

"Response:  To find out how far Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to first calculate her speed for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour and then multiply that by the number of hours she runs at that speed.  We know that Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she will cover a distance of:  

10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles  

Now, we need to add the distance she covers at 8 kilometers per hour (which is the average of her speeds):  

30 miles + (7 hours x 8 kilometers/hour) = 30 miles + 56 kilometers = 86 kilometers  

Therefore, Rosie can run 86 kilometers in 7 hours."

* WATERMELONS (4 x $3 =) $12
* PAPRIKAS (20 x $15 =) $300
* APPLESIANS (10 x $5 =) $50

Total Cost: $362

So, Dillon's total cost for purchasing four watermelons, 20 paprikas, and 10 oranges is $362."
"Response:  To calculate how much profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to subtract the cost of each visit (the amount paid by patients and doctors) from the revenue generated by each visit (the amount charged by the hospital). Let's assume that there are 500 patients per day, and each patient stays for an average of 24 minutes.

Patients per day = 500
Average stay per patient (minutes) = 24

Revenue generated per minute:
Doctor's fee per minute = $150/hour x 60 minutes/hour = $90 per minute
Patient's fee per minute = $200/hour x 60 minutes/hour = $120 per minute
Total revenue per minute = $90 + $120 = $210 per minute

Total revenue per day = Total revenue per minute x Number of minutes per day
= $210 per minute x 1440 minutes per day (24 minutes/patient x 500 patients)
= $312,000 per day

Cost per day:
Doctor's fee per day = $150/hour x 8 hours/day = $1200 per day
Patient's fee per day = $200/hour x 8 hours/day = $1600 per day
Total cost per day = $1200 + $1600 = $2800 per day

Profit per day = Revenue per day - Cost per day
= $312,000 - $2800
= $294,000 per day

Therefore, the hospital makes a daily profit of $294,000 from these visits."

* 2 x keitto (7.50 dollars each) = 15 dollars  
* 2 x pussi sipsejä (1.50 dollars each) = 3 dollars  
* 2 x keksi (1.00 dollar each) = 2 dollars  
Total cost before tip = 15 + 3 + 2 = 20 dollars  
Since Rory wants to add a five-dollar tip, her final bill will be:  
Final bill = 20 dollars + 5 dollars = 25 dollars"
Response:  If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions and he completed 5 questions per hour, then he completed 8 x 5 = 40 questions. Since there were 75 questions in total, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions unanswered. For the second test with 100 questions, if he has 6 hours to complete it, then he can complete 6 x 20 = 120 questions (since he completes 20 questions per hour).

Response:  If Jordan plays video games for two hours per day and has an part-time job that pays $10 per hour, then he earns $20 per day from his job. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jordan earns a total of $140 per week from his job ($20 x 7 days). Therefore, if Jordan spent all of his time working instead of playing video games, he would earn $140 more per week than he currently does.

Response:  To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the revenue. The COGS is $2 x 2 pullos + $5 x 1 laatan = $40. The revenue is $3 x 2 pullos + $5 x 1 laatan = $60. Therefore, the profit is $60 - $40 = $20 per week.
Response:  To find out how many pineapples John can harvest per year, we need to calculate how many pineapplies he can harvest in three months and then multiply that by four (since there are four seasons in a year). Let's assume each pineapple takes up one square meter of space. So, if John has 10 hectares of land, he has 10 x 100 = 1000 square meters of space for pineapples. Since he can harvest them every three months, he can harvest 4 times per year. Therefore, he can harvest 4 x 1000 = 4000 pineapples per year.
Response:  To find out how many boxes Johnny will collect if he gathers all the Legos, we need to calculate the total number of Lego pieces and then divide that by the number of pieces in each box. Let's start with the first box, which contains 500 pieces. The second box has three times as many pieces as the first box, so it contains 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. The third box has one fourth as many pieces as the second box, so it contains 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces. Therefore, Johnny will collect a total of 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 Lego pieces.

Response:  To find out how long the winner waits at home before the loser arrives, we need to calculate the time it takes for both participants to reach their homes from school. Let's start by calculating the distance each participant needs to travel: For Steve, the distance is 3 miles (since he lives 3 miles away from school), and for Tim, the distance is 3 kilometers (since he lives 3 kilometers away from school). Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each participant to cover that distance: For Steve, the time is: Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 440 ft/minute = 6.9 minutes Since Steve travels at 440 feet per minute, he covers 3 miles in 6.9 minutes. For Tim, the time is: Time = Distance / Speed = 3 km / 264 ft/minute = 11.3 minutes Since Tim travels at 264 feet per minute, he covers 3 kilometers in 11.3 minutes. Now, we need to subtract the time it takes for the faster participant (Steve) to arrive at home from the total time it takes for the slower participant (Tim) to arrive at home: Waiting time = Total time - Fastest time = 11.3 minutes - 6.9 minutes = 4.4 minutes So, the winner (Steve) waits at home for 4.4 minutes before the loser (Tim) arrives.

Response:  To calculate the total number of hours that Kimo spends in school during one academic year (16 weeks), we need to multiply the number of days he attends school each week by the number of hours he spends in school each day.  For Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday (4 days):  4 days x 3 hours/day = 12 hours/week  For Thursday (2 days):  2 days x 2 hours/day = 4 hours/week  Total hours for the week:  12 + 4 = 16 hours/week  Since there are 16 weeks in the academic year, the total number of hours that Kimo spends in school is:  16 weeks x 16 hours/week = 256 hours  Therefore, Kimo spends 256 hours in school during one academic year.
Response:  If each roll is 15 cm long and there are 300 of them, then the total length of all the rolls is 300 x 15 = 4500 cm or 4.5 meters. Similarly, if each croissant is 15 cm long and there are 120 of them, then the total length of all the croissants is 120 x 15 = 1800 cm or 1.8 meters. And if each baguette is 60 cm long and there are 60 of them, then the total length of all the baguettes is 60 x 60 = 3600 cm or 3.6 meters. Therefore, the total length of all the bread products that Bill produces daily is 4.5 + 1.8 + 3.6 = 9.9 meters.
"Response:  The zookeeper needs to order 350 bananas for two months (600 bananas total) to feed all the primates. Here's the calculation:

* Gorillas need 400 bananas per month x 2 months = 800 bananas
* Paviaans need 100 bananas per month x 2 months = 200 bananas
* Total needed = 800 + 200 = 1000 bananas

Since some of the bananas may be consumed or spoiled, it is better to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 350 bananas."

Response:  To find out how many fish they caught in total, we need to add up the number of each type of fish that Anakin and Locsin caught.  For Anakin:  10 meritähteä + 6 merikonkia + 3 klovninkalaa = 29 fish  For Locsin:  5 meritähteä + 3 merikonkia + 2 klovninkalaa = 18 fish  Therefore, together they caught 29 + 18 = 47 fish.
Response:  To calculate how much the marble vase will cost after 36 months, we need to find out how much it will cost each month and then multiply that by 36.  First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the vase:  Monthly Cost = (Initial Cost x (1 + Percentage Increase per Month)^Months) / 12  Initial Cost = $20  Percentage Increase per Month = 20%  Months = 36  Now, let's plug in the values:  Monthly Cost = ($20 x (1 + 0.20)^36) / 12  Using a calculator or spreadsheet, we can calculate the monthly cost as follows:  Monthly Cost = ($20 x 1.20^36) / 12  Monthly Cost = $20 x 1.20^36 / 12  Monthly Cost = $20 x 1.44 / 12  Monthly Cost = $28.80  Therefore, the monthly cost of the marble vase will be $28.80 for 36 months, or a total of $1,051.20 over three years.

"Response:  To determine how many times Sandra will have to babysit her daughter in order to collect 15 Spanish flans for the school fundraiser, we need to calculate the number of eggs required for each flan and then divide that number by the number of flans she needs to make. Let's assume that each flan requires 3 eggs (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, the total number of eggs required for 15 flans is:  

3 x 15 = 45 eggs

Now, let's calculate how many times Sandra will have to babysit her daughter based on the information given in the problem:

45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting session = 5 sessions

Therefore, Sandra will have to babysit her daughter 5 times to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans for the school fundraiser."

Sally Kolmekymmentäkaksi = 3 x 8 = 24 years old.  Therefore, the sum of the ages of the four birds is:  
8 + 3 + 2 + 24 = 47 years old."
Response:  To calculate how much Jessica pays per year, we need to multiply her monthly payments by 12. For her student loans, she pays $300/month x 12 = $3600/year. For her credit card debt, she pays $200/month x 12 = $2400/year. And for her mortgage, she pays $500/month x 12 = $6000/year. In total, Jessica pays $3600 + $2400 + $6000 = $11,800 per year.
"Response:  To calculate how long it takes Billy to prepare the potatoes, we need to add up the time he spends peeling and cutting them. Since there are 60 potatoes and each peeling takes approximately half a minute (30 seconds), the total peeling time would be:

60 x 0.5 = 30 minutes

Since each cutting takes only 5 seconds, the total cutting time would be:

60 x 0.05 = 3 minutes

Therefore, the total preparation time for all 60 potatoes would be:

30 + 3 = 33 minutes"
"Response:  To find out how much they spent on citrus, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem. Let's say x is the amount they spent on citrus. We know that they paid $3 per gallon for citrus and bought 20 gallons (since they sold 50 liters at $2 each). So, the total cost of citrus would be:

$3/gallon x 20 gallons = $60

Now, let's look at the profit they made from selling the mixture. They sold 50 liters at $2 each, so their revenue from sales is:

$2/liter x 50 liters = $100

Since they had a profit of $25, we can subtract the cost of ingredients from their revenue to find out how much they spent on citrus:

$100 - $60 = $40

Therefore, they spent $40 on citrus."

"Response:  To find out how much money Zaid has left after all expenses and gifts, we need to subtract all his expenses and gifts from his income. First, let's calculate his monthly expenses:  
* Rent: $1,500 (4/12 of $6,000) = $375 per month  
* Car payment: $300 (1/4 of $6,000) = $300 per month  
* Food and other household expenses: $700 (2/3 of $6,000) = $700 per month  
Total monthly expenses: $1,375  
Now, let's calculate his monthly gifts:  
* $200 for his daughter per month  
* $700 for his wife per month  
Total monthly gifts: $900  
Next, let's calculate his net income after all expenses and gifts:  
Net income = Income - Expenses - Gifts

Response:  To calculate how many red roses Sandra needs, we need to know how many white neiliöities she ordered and how many times more red roses she ordered than white neiliöities. The information given is that Sandra ordered 4 times more red roses than white neiliöities, so if she ordered x white neiliöities, she ordered 4x white neiliöities = 4x. We also know that she ordered 200 vaaleanpunaista kallaa, which are five times more than white neiliöities, so she ordered 5(200) = 1000 vaaleanpunaista kallaa. Therefore, Sandra needs 4x + 1000 = 4x + 1000 red roses.

Response:  To calculate the probability of Jerry throwing over three or two consecutive even numbers, we need to find the probability of each event and then add them up.  Let's start by finding the probability of throwing an odd number:  There are 6 possible outcomes when throwing one die:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since Jerry is throwing six dice, there are 6^6 = 46,656 possible outcomes. Of these, 3, 5, and 7 are odd numbers, so the probability of throwing an odd number is:  P(odd) = 3/46,656 = 0.006489 (or approximately 0.65%)  Now let's find the probability of throwing two consecutive even numbers:  There are 12 possible outcomes when throwing two dice:  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, or 22. Since Jerry is throwing six dice, there are 12 x 6 = 72 possible outcomes for two consecutive even numbers. The probability of throwing two consecutive even numbers is therefore:  P(two consecutive evens) = 72/46,656 = 0.153846 (or approximately 15.4%)  Finally, we can add the probabilities of throwing an odd number and two consecutive even numbers to get the total probability of throwing over three or two consecutive even numbers:  P(over three or two consequtive evens) = P(odd) + P(two consecutives evens) = 0.006489 + 0.153846 = 0.159335 (or approximately 15.9%)  So the probability of Jerry throwing over three or two consecutive even numbers is approximately 15.9%.

"Response:  To find out how much each of the three friends paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the event and then divide that amount by three. The total cost of the event is:

$20.25 (for three tickets) + $4.50 (for food) + $33 (for two horseback rides) = $68.75

To divide this amount among the three friends, we can simply divide $68.75 by 3:

$68.75 ÷ 3 = $22.91

So each friend paid $22.91 for the event."
Response:  John collects strawberries for three hours. He collects two strawberries per minute. How many strawberries does he collect in total?  To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many minutes there are in three hours and then multiply that by the number of strawberries John collects per minute.  There are 60 minutes in one hour, so there are 60 x 3 = 180 minutes in three hours.  Therefore, John collects 2 x 180 = 360 strawberries in three hours.

Friday morning:

* Vaaleanpunaisia (pink): 18
* Valkoisia (white): 6 (one third of 18)

Sunday morning:

* Vaaleanpunaisia (pink): 18 + 18 = 36
* Valkoisia (white): 6 + 6 = 12

So, on Sunday morning, there were 3 times more vaaleanpunaisia (pink) flamingos outside than valkoisia (white) flamingos."

Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:  First month: Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards and collected three times that amount, so she collected 60 Pokémon cards (20 x 3 = 60). Second month: Elaine collected fewer Pokémon cards than in the first month, so she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. Since there were 60 cards in the first month, Elaine collected 40 cards in the second month (60 - 20 = 40). Third month: Elaine collected twice as many Pokémon cards as in the first two months combined, so she collected 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 Pokémon cards in the third month. Therefore, Elaine has a total of 60 + 40 + 200 = 300 Pokémon cards.
Response:  To calculate how much Mark earns weekly from both publishers, we need to multiply the number of sentences he edits for each publisher by their respective payment rates. For Publisher A, Mark earns 5 cents x 200 sentences = $10 per week. For Publisher B, Mark earns 2 times more than with Publisher A, so he earns 2 x $10 = $20 per week. Therefore, Mark's total weekly income is $30 ($10 + $20).
Response:  Baldur receives five water jugs every morning and six water jugs every evening. Each jug contains 5 liters of water, so he receives a total of 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning and 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in the evening, for a daily total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water.
Response:  To calculate how much money John will earn in one year with a salary of $2000 per week and receiving a bonus of $5000 with a 5% raise, we can use the following formula: Total Earnings = Weekly Salary x Number of Weeks + Bonus. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, John's total earnings for the year would be: Total Earnings = $2000 x 52 + $5000 = $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000.
"Response:  To calculate how many barrels of wine are produced on Josie's farm each year, we need to multiply the number of tons of grapes produced per hectare by the number of hectares of land used for grape cultivation and then divide that result by 2 (since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine). Using the given information, we can calculate as follows:

Number of tons of grapes produced per hectare = 5 tons/hectare
Area of land used for grape cultivation = 10 hectares
Total number of tons of grapes produced per year = Number of hectares x Number of tons per hectare = 10 x 5 = 50 tons/year
Number of barrels of wine produced per year = Total number of tons of grapes produced / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 barrels/year
Therefore, Josie's farm produces 25 barrels of wine per year."

Response:  To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we need to calculate the distance he rode each week and then add it up. Let's break down the information given in the question:  Week 1: 5 times/week x 25 km/ride = 125 km/week (total for week)  Week 2-4: 2 times/week x 60 km/ride = 120 km/week (total for week)  Week 5: 3 times/week x 60 km/ride = 180 km/week (total for week) Total distance ridden per week: 125 km + 120 km + 180 km = 425 km Now, let's add up the distances for all four weeks: 425 km + 425 km + 425 km + 425 km = 1700 km So, Michael rode a total of 1700 kilometers.
Response:  To find out how many grams of chocolate Joen has, we need to first calculate the number of chocolates she has based on the information given. We know that each chocolate weighs twice as much as one apple, so if each apple weighs 100 grams, then each chocolate will weigh 2 x 100 = 200 grams. Since Joen has 25 chocolates, her total amount of chocolate is 25 x 200 = 5000 grams or 5 kilograms.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought four cakes. On Tuesday, she bought three times as many cakes as she did on Monday (3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she bought five times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday (5 x 12 = 60). In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes over the three days.

Therefore, the difference in cost between one half-dozen plate and twenty boxes of cups is:

2000 dollars - 30 dollars = 1970 dollars"
Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn before she has enough money for the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs and then divide that by the amount she earns each time she mows the lawn. Let's start by calculating the total amount of money Sara needs:  Takki: $30 + Kengät: $20 = $50.  Now let's calculate how much Sara earns each time she mows the lawn:  $5 per mowing x 4 mowings = $20.  Since Sara already had $10 saved up before becoming a babysitter, we can subtract that from the total amount she needs:  $50 - $10 = $40.  So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 40 / $5 per mowing = 8 times in order to have enough money for the jacket and shoes.
Response:  Let's say Jerry has x punaisia kanoja (punaiset kanat tuottavat 3 munaa päivässä, so x * 3 = 42). Since he has two more white chickens than red ones, he has x + 2 white chickens (valkoiset kanat tuottavat 5 munaa päivässä, so (x+2) * 5 = 42). Now we can solve for x.
Response:  To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to divide the distance he walks by his speed. Let's use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance (in this case, 3 miles), r is the rate (Gary's speed of 3 miles per hour), and t is the time (in hours). Plugging in the values, we get: 3 miles = 3 x 1 hour = 3 hours So, Gary spends 3 hours walking around the park.

Response:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford her purchases, we need to divide the cost of her purchases by her hourly wage.  Cost of purchases = $320 (kengät) + $32 (vyö) = $352 Total hourly wage = $8/hour Number of hours needed to work = $352 / $8 = 44 hours Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford her purchases.
Response:  To calculate the remaining balance of Janeth's loan after she has made 12 monthly payments of $165 each, we need to use the formula for amortization. The formula is:  Remaining Balance = (Initial Principal x Interest Rate) / (1 - (1 + Interest Rate)^(-Number of Payments))  In this case, the initial principal is $2000, the interest rate is 10%, and there will be 12 monthly payments. Plugging in these values, we get:  Remaining Balance = ($2000 x 10%) / (1 - (1 + 10%)^(-12))  Simplifying and calculating, we get:  Remaining Balance = $1438.79  Therefore, after making 12 monthly payments of $165 each, Janeth will have a remaining balance of $1438.79 on her loan.

"Response:  Let's denote the number of points scored by each student as follows:

Naomi = N
Yuri = Y
Brianna = B
Jojo = J

From the problem statement, we know that:

N + Y + B + J = 251 (total points)
N < Y (Yuri scores more than Naomi)
B > N (Brianna scores more than Naomi)
J > B (Jojo scores more than Brianna)

Now, let's solve for J:

J = 251 - (N + B)

Substituting N = 68 and B = 17, we get:

J = 251 - (68 + 17)
= 251 - 85
= 166

Therefore, Jojo scored 166 points."

Response:  To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their boat rentals, we need to calculate the cost of each hour they use the boats and then multiply that by the number of hours they use them.  For Carlos:  Cost per hour = $30/hour  Number of hours used = 3 hours Total cost = $30 x 3 = $90  For Benji:  Cost per hour = $18/hour  Number of hours used = 5 hours Total cost = $18 x 5 = $90  Since both Carlos and Benji use the boats for the same amount of time (3 and 5 hours respectively), they will both pay $90 for their boat rentals.
Response:  If Andrew takes the bus from New Jersey to Rochester and then returns by car, he will spend 6 days traveling (3 days on the bus + 3 days driving).
"Response:  The probability that a randomly selected card from James's deck is a water-type card, after he has lost 8 water cards and gained 14 grass cards, can be calculated as follows:

Probability of a water card = (Number of water cards before - Number of water cards after) / Total number of cards before
= (30 - 8) / 50
= 22 / 50
= 0.44 or 44%

So, there is a 44% chance that a randomly selected card from James's deck is a water-type card."
"Response:  To calculate how much Chad owes after his meal, we need to add up all of the costs he incurred. Here's the breakdown:

* Burrito: $6.50
* Additional meat: $2.00
* Avocado: $1.00
* Two salsas: $0.25
* Upgrade to French fries and drink: $3.00

Total cost: $13.95

Since Chad has a gift card worth $3.00, he will only have to pay the remaining balance of:

$13.95 - $3.00 = $10.95

So, Chad owes $10.95 for his meal."
"Response:  To determine how many hours it will take for Kalinda and her mother to solve the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate the number of pieces they can complete in one hour. Let's assume that Kalinda can complete 4 pieces per minute (since she can add 4 pieces per minute) and her mother can complete half of that amount, or 2 pieces per minute. Therefore, together they can complete:

Kalinda: 4 pieces/min x 60 minutes = 240 pieces/hour
Mother: 2 pieces/min x 60 minutes = 120 pieces/hour
Total: 240 + 120 = 360 pieces/hour
Since there are 360 pieces in total, it will take them exactly 1 hour to solve the puzzle."
Response:  To find out how many watermelons were not ready for harvest two weeks later, we need to calculate (1 - 0.7) x 90 = 63 watermelons were not ready for harvest two weeks later.
"Response:  To calculate how much Mark pays in total for his fleet of 12 cars, we need to consider two costs: the purchase price of each car and the registration fee. Let's break down the calculation step by step:  
1. Purchase Price: 12 x $20,000 = $240,000 (total cost of all cars)  
2. Registration Fee: 12 x $1,000 = $12,000 (total registration fees)  
3. Tax on Purchase Price: $240,000 x 10% = $24,000 (tax on total purchase price)  
Total Cost = Purchase Price + Registration Fee + Tax on Purchase Price:  
$240,000 + $12,000 + $24,000 = $276,000"
"Response:  To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to know that she collected 5 more shells on Monday than Robert did (5 = 20 - x, where x is the number of shells Robert collected). We also know that on Tuesday, Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday (2x = 5 + x). So we can set up the equation:  
2x + 5 = 2(20 - x)  
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  
2x + 5 = 40 - 2x  
3x + 5 = 40  
x = 16  
So Kylie collected 16 shells on Monday and 32 shells on Tuesday (2 times 16)."
Response:  There are 75 hyönteisä in the garden (50 muurahaisia + 25 ötököitä).
Response:  There are 12 pingviiniä left basking in the sun (36 - 3 x 12 = 12).
Response:  To determine how many vines Steve needs to produce three tomatoes per week, we need to calculate how much more he eats than his girlfriend and divide that amount by the number of tomatoes produced per vine per week. Let's assume his girlfriend eats two tomatoes per day, or 14 tomatoes per week (2 x 7 = 14). Steve eats twice as much, so he eats four tomatoes per day, or 28 tomatoes per week (4 x 7 = 28). To find out how many vines Steve needs, we can divide the difference between their weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced per vine per week: 28 - 14 = 14 / 3 = 4.67 vines. Since you cannot have a fraction of a vine, Steve would need five vines to meet his tomato demand.

"Response: 240.

Explanation:
Let X be the number of students who left through exit C.
We know that 30% of the students left through exit A, so the number of students who left through exit A is 30% of 1000, or 300.
We also know that 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, so the number of students who left through exit B is (3/5) × (1000 - 300), or 600.
Therefore, the total number of students who left through exits A and B is 300 + 600 = 900.
Since all the remaining students left through exit C, the number of students who left through exit C is 1000 - 900 = 100.
So, the number of students who left through exit C is 100."
"Response:  To find out how many more karkkia John has than James, we need to subtract the number of karkkia James has from the number of karkkia John has. Let's do that:  
54 (John) - 6 (James) =?

54 - 6 = 48  
So John has 48 more karkkia than James."
Response:  If Dolly reads two books and Pandora reads one book, then together they have read three books (2 + 1 = 3).
Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing per week, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends writing and then divide that by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Let's break down the information given in the problem:  * Each letter is 5 pages long.  * Mike writes two letters per week.  * Each page takes him 6 minutes to write.  So, for each letter, Mike spends 2 x 5 = 10 minutes writing. Since he writes two letters per week, he spends a total of 2 x 10 = 20 minutes writing per week. Now, let's convert minutes to hours: 20 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.33 hours or 20 minutes/week. Therefore, Mike spends approximately 20 minutes per week writing letters.
"Response:  To calculate how many minutes Jason has left for the month, we need to subtract the number of minutes he has already spent (300) from the total number of minutes available in the month (1000). Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is:  
1000 - 300 = 700 minutes."
Response:  Ginger gave Griffin 3 more than what Kyle took from him (5). Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 8 ransonlais (5 + 3 = 8)
"Response:  Let's say there are x number of fish in each aquarium. Since one aquarium has 4 tanks and the other has 32 tanks, we can write an equation for the total number of fish in each aquarium as follows:

Aquarium 1 (4 tanks): 4x = 4(x) = 4x

Aquarium 2 (32 tanks): 32x = 32(x) = 32x

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can set up a proportion between the two equations:

4x = 32x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So, there are 8 fish in each aquarium."
Response:  To calculate how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to know the total number of hours worked and the hourly rate. We are given that the makeup artist worked for six hours per day (6 x 4 = 24 hours/week) and four weeks (4 x 5 = 20 weeks). The weekly cost is $250/hour x 24 hours/week = $6,000/week. Multiplying this by the number of weeks gives us a total of $6,000 x 20 weeks = $120,000. Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount due to the large amount of work involved, Jean paid $120,000 x 90% = $108,000.
Response:  To find out how much each person paid, we need to divide the total cost by the number of people splitting the cost. In this case, the total cost is $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98. If there are three people splitting the cost, then each person pays $98 / 3 = $32.
Response:  To find out how much Kokki has spent in total, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then by the price per kilogram. So, 4 bags x 50 kg/bag x $1.5/kg = $600.
"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the difference between their total consumption of calories. Let's first calculate the total number of calories each day:

Maanantai (Monday):
Sue: 4 x 200 = 800 calories
Sister: 5 x 200 = 1000 calories
Tiistai (Tuesday):
Sue: 2 x 200 = 400 calories
Sister: 13 x 200 = 2600 calories
Total for Monday and Tuesday:
Sue: 800 + 400 = 1200 calories
Sister: 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories
Difference: 3600 - 1200 = 2400 calories
Therefore, Sue consumed 2400 more calories than her sister over these two days."
