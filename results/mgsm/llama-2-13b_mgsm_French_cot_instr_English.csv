"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many eggs are left after Janet uses them for her breakfast and baking. Then, we will subtract the number of eggs she sells daily from the total number of eggs produced. Finally, we will multiply the remaining eggs by the price per egg to find out how much money she earns daily.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs left after usage.
Janet eats three eggs at breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She uses four eggs to make muffins, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

Step 2: Subtract the number of eggs sold daily from the total number of eggs produced.
Since Janet sells four eggs daily, she has 9 - 4 = 5 eggs left unsold.

Step 3: Multiply the remaining eggs by the price per egg to find out how much money she earns daily.
Five eggs x $2/egg = $10/day.

Therefore, Janet earns $10/day selling fresh eggs at the farmer's market."
Response:  We know that we need half of the amount of white fiber as blue fiber to make one robe. So if we need 2 rolls of blue fiber, then we will need half of that quantity in white fiber, which is equal to 1 roll of white fiber. Therefore, we need a total of 3 rolls (2 blue + 1 white) of fiber to make one robe.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the value of the house after renovation. If the value increases by 150%, then it means that the new value is 1.5 times the original value. So, if the original value was $80,000, the new value would be:

$80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000

Now, let's subtract the amount Josh invested in the renovation from the new value:

$120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000

So, Josh has realized a profit of $70,000 or 70% return on his investment."
"Response:  We know that Jacques does 3 series of 3 sprints each per week, so he does a total of 9 sprints per week (3 x 3 = 9). And we also know that each sprint is 60 meters long, so if we multiply 9 sprints by 60 meters per sprint, we get...

Question: What is the difference between the area of a circle and the area of a square with the same perimeter?
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer. 
Answer: To find the difference in area between a circle and a square with the same perimeter, let's first calculate the area of the circle and the area of the square. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since we are given that the perimeter of both shapes is the same, we can set up an equation using the perimeter formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length of one side of the shape and w is the width. For a circle, the diameter (d) is twice the radius (r), so d = 2r. Substituting this into our perimeter equation, we get P = 2(2r + 2w). Now we can solve for the radius of the circle using this equation and the fact that the perimeter is the same for both shapes. Once we have the radius, we can plug it into the formula for the area of a circle to find the area of the circle. Then, we can compare this to the area of the square to find the difference in area."
Response:  We know that Wendi gives her chickens three meals per day and each meal contains three bowls of food mix with seeds, flour worms, and vegetables. So she gives them a total of nine bowls of food per day (3 x 3). If she has 20 chickens, then she needs to give each chicken one-third of a bowl of food at each meal, or 9/20 = 1/4 of a bowl for the last meal of the day. Therefore, she should give her chickens 25 / 4 = 6 1/4 bowls of food for the last meal of the day.
"Response:  If each second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass, then the price of the second glass would be:  
Price of the second glass = Price of the first glass x (60%) 
= $5 x (60%) 
= $3 
So, if Kylar buys 16 glasses, he will pay:  
Total cost = Number of glasses x Price per glass 
= 16 x $3 
= $48 
Therefore, Kylar will have to pay $48 for 16 glasses."
"Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and four times more than Seattle. So if we let T be the number of sheep in Toulouse, C be the number of sheep in Charleston, and S be the number of sheep in Seattle, we can write an equation based on the information given:
T = 2C... (1)
C = 4S... (2)
We also know that Seattle has 20 sheep, so we can write another equation:
S = 20... (3)
Now we have three equations and three unknowns. Can you use these equations to find out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have altogether?"
"Response:  We know that Carla is downloading at a rate of 2 GB per minute and it takes 40% of the download to complete before Windows requires a restart. So we can calculate how long it will take to download the file as follows:

1. Calculate the total size of the file in bytes:
200 GB x (1 GB / 1024 MB) = 20971520000 bytes
2. Calculate the percentage of the download that has already been completed:
40% = 40/100 = 0.4
3. Calculate the amount of data left to be downloaded:
Total size - Percentage completed = Amount left to be downloaded
20971520000 - 0.4 \* 20971520000 = 12385760000 bytes
4. Divide the amount left to be downloaded by the download rate to find out how many minutes are needed for the remaining portion of the download:
12385760000 / 2 GB/minute = 61928800 minutes
Therefore, if Carla restarts her computer after 20 minutes of downloading, she will need an additional 61928800 - 20 = 61928680 minutes to finish downloading the entire file. This translates to approximately 1032 hours or about 42 days."
"Response:  We know that Jean drives for 3 hours at 60 mph and then makes a U-turn to return home. He loses 2 hours in traffic jams, so he has 4 - 2 = 2 hours left to drive. During the next 30 minutes, he drives at 30 mph, which means he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 30 mph x 0.5 hour
= 15 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled during the remaining 2 hours:

Total Distance = (Speed x Time) + Initial Distance
= (80 mph x 2 hours) + 15 miles
= 160 miles + 15 miles
= 175 miles

So, after 4 hours, Jean is separated from his home by a distance of 175 miles."
"Response:  We know that Elisa works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10/hour and then she has 5 hours of overtime at 1.2 times her regular rate. So we can calculate her total earnings as follows:  
Total Earnings = Regular Hours x Regular Rate + Overtime Hours x Overtime Rate  
= 40 hours x $10/hour + 5 hours x (1.2 x $10/hour)  
= 400 + 60 = 460  
Therefore, Elisa's weekly salary is $460."
"Response:  We know that in the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times. In the second month, it was downloaded three times more than in the first month, so it was downloaded 60 x 3 = 180 times. Finally, in the third month, there was a 30% decrease from the previous month, which means we need to subtract 30% of 180. So, the number of downloads in the third month is:  
180 - (30/100) x 180 = 180 - 54 = 126 times. 
Therefore, the total number of downloads over these three months is:  
60 + 180 + 126 = 366 times."
"Response:  We have to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them up. 
1) Beignets: 3 x 68 = 204 $
2) Petits gâteaux: 2 x 80 = 160 $
3) Petits gâteaux au fromage: 6 x 55 = 330 $
Total cost: 204 + 160 + 330 = 794 $"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend each year for watering and fertilizing his lemon tree. We know that this cost is $3 per year. Now let's calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree. To do this, we need to subtract the annual expenses (watering and fertilizing) from the revenue generated by selling lemons. Revenue = Number of lemons x Price per lemon. In this case, the number of lemons produced annually is 7, and the price per lemon is $1.50. So, the total revenue per year is: Revenue = 7 x $1.50 = $10.50 Subtracting the annual expenses ($3), we get: Profit = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 Therefore, it will take Carlos 7.5 years to start making a profit from his lemon tree.
Response:  We know that Mélanie sold a third of her aspirators at the Green House (3/10), then she sold two more at the Red House (2/8), and finally, she sold half of what was left at the Orange House (1/2). To find out how many aspirators Melanie had to start with, we can use the fact that after each sale, there is less and less left. So let's divide the number of aspirators she has left by the number of houses she visited: 5 / 3 = 1 + 2 = 3. Therefore, Melanie started with 3 x 10 = 30 aspirators.
"Response:  We know that 20% of the students are in contemporary dance and 25% are in jazz dance. So, if we add these two percentages together, we get:

20% + 25% = 45%

Now, we can subtract this percentage from 100% to find out what percentage of students are not in either of those two styles:

100% - 45% = 55%

Therefore, 55% of the students are in hip-hop dance."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the value of each option at the end of the month. For the jewelry option, we have:

Value = 5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = 5,000 x 1.025 = 5,125

For the electronics option, we have:

Value = 8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = 8,000 x 1.012 = 8,096

Now, let's compare the two options and find out which one would give the highest profit:

Option 1 (Jewelry): Profit = Value - Cost = 5,125 - 5,000 = 125

Option 2 (Electronics): Profit = Value - Cost = 8,096 - 8,000 = 96

Since Option 2 has a higher profit, it is the better choice for the merchant."
Response:  We know that both trains travel for two days and cover a total of 230 miles (80 + 150). Since they start from the same place at the same time, their distances traveled must be equal. So each train covers 230 miles in two days.
"Response:  We know that Jill earns $20 per hour as an instructor and $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. She works 35 hours per week as an instructor, 15 hours per week as a cheerleading coach, and she works for 50 weeks per year (since there are 50 weeks in a typical school year). So let's calculate her annual salary first as an instructor:  

35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year  
$20/hour x 1750 hours/year = $35,000/year  
Now, let's calculate her annual salary as a cheerleading coach:  

15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year  
$30/hour x 750 hours/year = $22,500/year  
So, Jill's total annual salary is:  
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500/year"
"Response:  If Claire eats an omelette of 3 eggs every morning for 28 days (4 weeks), then she will eat a total of:

3 x 28 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks

So, Claire will consume 84 dozen eggs in 4 weeks."
Response:  We know that Marissa has already covered 4 miles in one hour and then another two miles in the next hour, so she has covered a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she still needs to cover 6 miles more. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she must cover these remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours (since 4 x 1.5 = 6). So, she needs to maintain a speed of 4 miles per hour for the last 1.5 hours of her hike.
"Response:  We have 10L of orange juice mixed with 6L (2/3) of water and we spill 1L of it. So, we are left with 9L of orange juice mixed with 6L of water. Now, we add 15L of anana juice mixed with 10L (3/4) of water to this mixture. Therefore, the final volume of the mixture is:

9L + 15L = 24L

Since 3/4 of the anana juice is water, there are 10L of water in the final mixture."
Response:  We know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond must be 31 + 6 = 37 years old. Since Raymond had his son at age 23, his son would now be 37 - 23 = 14 years old.
Response:  We know that Billy has 8 customers and his first three customers buy one DVD each. So he sells 3 DVDs to his first three customers. His next two customers buy two DVDs each, so he sells another 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs. Finally, he doesn't sell any DVDs to his last three customers because they don't buy any. In total, Billy sells 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that the candle loses 2 cm every hour. So if it burns for 4 hours (from 13h to 17h), it will lose 8 cm in total. Therefore, after burning from 13h to 17h, the candle will have lost 8 cm.
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book and received a discount of 25%. To find out what the original price was before the discount, we can use the following equation:

Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)

In this case, the discount percentage is 25%, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75
= Original Price = $26

So, the original price of the book before the discount was $26."
"Response:  We know that Marie paid in total 50 dollars and she bought some boxes of pizza. So we can start by writing an equation based on what we know:  
50 = 12 + 3 x (number of boxes) + 1.5 x (number of apples) + 8.5 x (number of boxes) 
We also know that each box of pizza costs 8.50$, so we can substitute this value into our previous equation:  
50 = 12 + 3x(number of boxes) + 1.5x(number of apples) + 8.5x(number of boxes)  
Simplifying the equation further:  
50 = 12 + 3x + 1.5x + 8.5x  
Combine like terms:  
50 = 12 + 3x + 1.5x + 8.5x  
Solve for ""x"" (the number of boxes):  
50 = 12 + 3x + 1.5x + 8.5x  
Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us:  
38 = 3x + 1.5x + 8.5x  
Adding 1.5x to both sides gives us:  
39.5 = 3x + 8.5x  
Subtracting 3x from both sides gives us:  
6 = 8.5x  
Dividing both sides by 8.5 gives us:  
7 = x  
Therefore, Marie ordered 7 boxes of pizza."
Response:  We know that Mishka bought 3 shorts, so she spent 3 x 16.50 = 49.50 $ on shorts. For pants, we have 3 x 22.50 = 67.50 $ and for shoes, we have 3 x 42 = 126 $. In total, Mishka has spent 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 $.
Response:  If Cynthia consumes one portion of ice cream every night and there are 30 days in April, she will consume 30 portions of ice cream in total. Since each carton contains 15 portions, she will need 2 cartons (30/15 = 2). Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will have consumed 2 x 30 = 60 portions of ice cream. To calculate how much she will spend on ice cream, we can multiply the number of portions by the cost per portion: 60 x 4.00 = 240. So, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent 240 dollars on ice cream.
Response:  We know that Henri has traveled for 20 miles before his first stop and then he has traveled for another 15 miles before his second stop. So in total, Henri has traveled for 20 + 15 = 35 miles between the two stops.
"Response:  We know that the price of one pair of high heels is $33 and the other pair costs twice as much. So, if we let X be the cost of the second pair of high heels, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:

X + 2X = 5 + 33 (since there are two pairs of high heels)

Simplifying the equation:

3X = 58

Dividing both sides by 3:

X = 19

So, the price of the second pair of high heels is $19. Since the first pair costs $33, we can find out the price of the bottines by subtracting the total cost of the two pairs of high heels from the original amount of money available to Gloria:

$50 - ($33 + $19) = $50 - $52 = $8

Therefore, the price of the bottines is $8."
"Response:  We know that Darrell is 7 years younger than Allen, so we can write an equation based on their ages:
Darrell's age = Allen's age - 7
We also know that the sum of their current ages is 162:
Darrell's age + Allen's age = 162... (1)
Now, we want to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years. So, let's add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age + 10 =?... (2)
Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
(Allen's age + 10) + (Darrell's age) = 162
Combine like terms:
Allen's age + 10 + Darrell's age = 162
Simplify:
11 Allen's age + 7 Darrell's age = 162
Combine like terms:
11A + 7D = 162
Solve for A (Allen's age):
11A = 155
A = 14
So, Allen will be 14 + 10 = 24 years old in 10 years."
"Response:  We have three friends who estimated the number of candies in the jar as follows:
Friend 1: 80
Friend 2: 80 + (20/2) = 80 + 10 = 90
Friend 3: 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + (25 x 4) = 80 + 100 = 180
Now we need to find the average of these estimates. To do this, we add all the numbers and divide by the number of friends:
(80 + 90 + 180) / 3 = (250) / 3 = 83
So, the average of their estimates is 83."
Response:  There are 7 days in a week and each day, Jean spends 0.5 hours with each of the 10 dogs, so she spends 0.5 x 10 = 5 hours per day taking care of the dogs. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jean spends a total of 5 x 7 = 35 hours per week taking care of the dogs.
"Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 pieces in total and there are 30 more gold coins than silver ones. So if we subtract the number of silver coins from both sides, we get:  

110 - 80 = 30 (where 80 is the number of silver coins)  

Now we can see that Gretchen has 30 gold coins."
"Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's beads, so we can start by finding out how many beads Raymond has. If Raymond has 40 beads, then he has 40/2 = 20 sets of beads. Since Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's beads, Aaron has 20 x 1.5 = 30 sets of beads. 
Now, let's find out how many beads Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer than Aaron, so if Aaron has 30 sets of beads, Siobhan has 30 - 2 = 28 sets of beads. Therefore, Siobhan has 28 sets of beads."
"Response:  We know that during the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. During the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than before. So, if he scored x points in the first 20 minutes, he scored (1 + 0.25x) points in the second 20 minutes. In total, Mike scored (4 + (1 + 0.25x)) points. To find x, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
4 + (1 + 0.25x) = Total Points  
Solving for x gives us:  
x = 8  
So, Mike scored a total of 8 + 4 = 12 points."
"Response:  We know that Terry consumes 2 yogurts per day and sells them at $4 for 5 yogurts. So he earns $8 per day from selling yogurt. If we multiply this amount by 30 days, we get:  
$8 x 30 = $240  
Therefore, Terry spends $240 on yogurt over 30 days."
Response:  First, we know that Jean has 13 Lego games and he is selling each one for $15. So, if he sells all of them, he will have $15 x 13 = $195. Then, he spends $195 to buy 8 video games at $20 per game, so he pays $195 / $20 = 10 games. Therefore, he has $195 - $10 = $185 left. Finally, he has $185 / $15 = 12 Lego games left.
"Response:  We know that Jean runs for three hours on the first day and two times less (i.e., six hours) on the other two days. So, in total, he runs for:

3 + 2 x 6 = 3 + 12 = 15 hours per week.

Since he covers 60 miles each week, his speed can be calculated as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 60 miles / 15 hours
= 4 miles/hour"
"Response:  We know that Dana runs four times faster than she walks, so if she walks at x miles per hour, she runs at 4x miles per hour. Since she spends 2/3 of her time walking and 1/3 of her time running, we can set up the following equation to represent how far she travels in each mode:

Walking (2/3):
Distance = Speed x Time = x x 2/3 hours = 2x/3 miles

Running (1/3):
Distance = Speed x Time = 4x x 1/3 hours = 4x/3 miles

Since Dana saunters at 3 miles per hour, we know that she covers:

Walking distance = 2x/3 miles = 2 miles

Now, let's find out how far she runs in one hour:

Running distance = 4x/3 miles = 4 miles

We also know that Dana spends 6 hours total, so we need to add up the distances she covers while walking and running:

Total distance = Walking distance + Running distance = 2 miles + 4 miles = 6 miles

Therefore, Dana covers 6 miles in 6 hours, assuming she spends 2/3 of her time walking and 1/3 of her time running at a speed of 3 miles per hour."
Response:  We know that the iPhone of Ben is two times older than the one of Suzie, so if Suzie has an iPhone that is one year old, then Ben's iPhone is two years old. Now we also know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so if Ben's iPhone is two years old, then Brandon's iPhone is eight years old. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is eight years old.
Response:  We know that without the stone of saphire, Polly can throw the javelot only up to 400 feet (the range of her weapon). With the stone, she can throw it three times as far, so 3 x 400 = 1200 feet. So with the stone, Polly can stay at a safe distance of 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet from the dragon and still hit it with the javelot.
"Response:  We know that each tart was cut into 8 parts, so if there were 5 tarts in total, then there were 5 x 8 = 40 parts in total. If there are 14 parts left over after everyone has taken and eaten their share, then we can set up an equation to represent this information:

14 = 40 - (number of parts taken)

To solve for the number of parts taken, we can subtract both sides of the equation from 40:

14 = 40 - (number of parts taken)

Subtracting 40 from both sides gives us:

26 = number of parts taken

So, each invitee took approximately 26 parts of the tart."
"Response:  We know that each serving of chips contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in total (since the bag weighs 300g and each serving is 60g). So if we want to calculate how many grams of chips we can eat while staying within our daily calorie goal of 2000 calories, we need to subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our daily limit.  

First, let's convert the weight of the bag from grams to calories using the nutritional information provided:
Calories per serving = 250
Total calories in the bag = 5 x Calories per serving = 5 x 250 = 1250

Now, let's subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our daily limit:
Daily calorie goal - Calories consumed so far = 2000 - 1800 = 200

So, we can safely consume up to 200 additional calories worth of chips without exceeding our daily calorie goal. Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, we can eat up to 4 servings (or 240g) of chips without going over our limit."
Response:  We know that each pound of beeswax allows Charlie to produce 10 candles. If he produces and sells 20 candles, then he must use 2 pounds of wax (20 / 10 = 2). The price of one pound of wax is $10, so the total cost of the wax for 20 candles is $20 (2 x $10). Since each candle is sold for $2, the total revenue from selling all 20 candles is $40 ($2 x 20). Subtracting the total cost of the wax gives us the net profit: Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $40 - $20 = $20.
"Response:  We know that Meredith spent 4 hours per day writing each article and she wrote x articles on Monday, y articles on Tuesday, and z articles on Wednesday. So we can start with this information to calculate the total number of hours worked during these three days.

Monday:
x articles \* 4 hours/article = 4x hours (written on Monday)

Tuesday:
y articles \* 4 hours/article = 4y hours (written on Tuesday)

Wednesday:
z articles \* 4 hours/article = 4z hours (written on Wednesday)

Total hours for 3 days:
4x + 4y + 4z hours

Now we need to find out how many hours Meredith worked in total over these three days. To do this, we add up all the hours from each day:

4x + 4y + 4z =?

Can you solve for x, y, and z using the information given in the problem?"
"Response:  We know that Candice had 80 pense-bêtes in her bag before she went to work and she placed one pense-bête on each of the 220 cups of coffee. So, if she has 23 pense-bêtes left, we can calculate how many pense-bêtes were in the package she bought.  
Let X be the number of pense-bêtes in the package. Since Candice used all of them, X + 23 = 80.  
Solving for X, we get X = 57. Therefore, there were 57 pense-bêtes in the package Candice bought."
"Response:  We know that Jean has bought twice as many red ties as blue ones. So if he has bought x blue ties, he must have bought 2x red ties. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so the total cost of all blue ties is:

40$ x x = 40x

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is:

40x + (50% of 40x) = 40x + 20x = 60x

Since Jean spent $200 on all the ties, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

40x + 60x = 200

Combine like terms:

100x = 200

Divide both sides by 100:

x = 2

So Jean has bought 2 blue ties and 4 red ties (since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties). Therefore, the total number of ties he has bought is:

2 + 4 = 6

And the total amount he has spent on ties is:

40x + 60x = 40(2) + 60(4) = 80 + 240 = 320

So Jean has spent $320 on ties."
"Response:  We know that Tracy has used a length of 4 feet (48 inches) and she wants to cut it into pieces of 6 inches each. So we can start by dividing 48 by 6:

48 / 6 = 8

This means that Tracy has obtained 8 pieces of 6 inches each from her original 4-foot length of wire."
"Response:  We know that there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments, so there are 15 x 8 = 120 apartments in total. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of unoccupied apartments as follows:

120 (total apartments) x 3/4 = 90 unoccupied apartments

So, there are 90 unoccupied apartments in the building."
"Response:  We know that Lloyd has 252 eggs per day and he sells them at $2 per dozen. So, if we divide 252 by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen), we get:

252 / 12 = 20

So, Lloyd sells 20 dozen eggs per day. Now, let's multiply this number by the price per dozen to find out how much he earns per day:

20 x $2 = $40

Therefore, Lloyd earns $40 per day from his eggs. To find out how much he earns per week, we can simply multiply $40 by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

$40 x 7 = $280

So, Lloyd earns $280 per week from his eggs."
"Response:  We know that Tom travelled for 3 hours (from 13h to 16h) at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So we can calculate how far he went during this time:  
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles  
Now, we know that Tom is returning at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take him to return, we need to divide the distance he needs to cover by his speed:  
Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours  
Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to return home."
Response:  We know that each of Uriah's comic books weighs 1/4 of a pound and each toy weighs 1/2 of a pound. So if he has 30 comic books, that would be 30 x 1/4 = 7 1/2 pounds. If he has n toys, then the total weight of all his toys is 7 1/2 + n pounds. Since he needs to reduce the weight of his bag by 15 pounds, he must remove enough toys so that 7 1/2 + n - 15 = 0. Solving for n, we get n = 8. Therefore, Uriah must remove 8 toys from his bag in order to reduce its weight by 15 pounds.
Response:  We know that on Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 pneus de camion and 4 pneus de voiture for a total of $60 x 6 + $40 x 4 = $360 + $160 = $520. On Friday, he repaired 12 pneus de voiture for $40 x 12 = $480. So, his total earnings for the week were $520 + $480 = $1,000.
Response:  We know that each of the sisters adopted 7 kittens from the animal shelter. So together they have 7 + 7 = 14 kittens in their car. Now we are told that Patchy had three times as many kittens as Trixie. If Trixie has 12 kittens, then Patchy must have had 3 x 12 = 36 kittens. In total, the family Doubtfire now has 14 + 36 = 50 kittens!
"Response:  If Jean has 30 lollipops and eats 2 of them, he will have 30 - 2 = 28 left. Now, if he wants to make bags of 2 lollipops each, he can make:  
28 / 2 = 14 bags."
"Response:  First, we know that Pierre has 42 dollars for the week and he spends 7 dollars on a movie ticket and 7 dollars on popcorn each time he goes to the movies. So if we want to find out how many times Pierre can go to the movies this week, we need to divide the total amount of money he has (42 dollars) by the cost of going to the movies (14 dollars).  

So, 42 / 14 = 3. We can round up or down depending on our preference, but since we are looking for an exact number, let's round down to 3 times. Therefore, Pierre can go to the movies 3 times this week with his current budget."
"Response:  We know that the total weight of the camion and its contents must not exceed 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). The weight of the empty camion is 3,755 pounds (1,701 kg), so we can subtract this from our limit to find out how much weight we have available for cargo:  
5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245 pounds (565 kg)  
Now let's consider each box of 15 pounds (6.8 kg): if we divide the available weight by the weight of one box, we get an idea of how many boxes we can load:  
1,245 / 15 = 83 boxes (or 1,245 / 6.8 = 183 boxes) So, we can safely load up to 83 or 183 boxes onto the truck without overloading the bridge."
"Response:  First, we know that the original price of the groceries was 40.00$. Then, there was a 25% service charge, which is 10$ (40 x 0.25). Finally, there were 3$ in delivery fees and a tip of 4$, so the total cost to Stéphane was :  
40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 67$."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 grape clusters of 20 grapes each, so we can start by adding up all those numbers to find out how many grapes are in the clusters:

6 x 20 = 120 grapes in the clusters

Now, let's add the number of isolated grapes to this total:

120 + 67 = 187 grapes

So, there are 187 grapes in total!"
"Response:  We know that there are 25 oranges in total and we have to find out how many of them are good. So let's break down the information given into three parts:

1. Not mature (20%): 20% of 25 is 5. Therefore, there are 5 oranges that are not mature.
2. Acidic (2): There are 2 acidic oranges.
3. Good (remaining): The remaining oranges are good. To find out how many, subtract the number of non-mature and acidic oranges from 25:

25 - 5 - 2 = 18

So, there are 18 good oranges."
"Response:  First, we know that Janet spent $500 for materials to make the brooch. Then she paid an additional $800 to have it made by a jeweler. Finally, she spent 10% of this amount ($800) on insurance. So, let's calculate how much she spent in total:

$500 + $800 = $1300 (total cost of materials and jeweler's fee)
$1300 x 10% = $130 (insurance premium)
Total cost = $1300 + $130 = $1430

Therefore, Janet has spent a total of $1430 on the brooch."
"Response:  If she works for 30 years and receives 5% of her annual salary as a pension benefit starting from year 20, then we can calculate her pension benefit as follows:  
1) Calculate her total work experience in years: 30 years  
2) Determine the number of years she is eligible for the pension benefit (starting from year 20): 10 years  
3) Multiply her annual salary by the number of years she is eligible for the pension benefit to get the total pension benefit amount:  
$50,000 x 10 = $500,000  
So, her annual pension benefit would be $500,000 / 10 = $50,000 per year."
"Response:  We know that the monthly subscription fee is $140 and we are given that the company charged her 10% less during the second half of the year. So if they charged her $140 per month for the first six months (half a year), then they would have charged her $126 per month ($140 x 90%) for the next six months (the other half of the year). Therefore, the total amount she paid for the entire year is:  
$140 x 6 months = $840 + $126 x 6 months = $756 = $1,596"
Response:  We know that Sophie has already driven 100 miles since her last fill-up and had to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill her tank. So she started with 12 gallons - 4 = 8 gallons left in her tank. To find out how many more miles she can drive, we need to divide the number of gallons left by her car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon). Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem statement. Without knowing her car's fuel efficiency, we cannot determine exactly how far Sophie can go on one tank of gas. However, we can estimate based on average fuel economy for different types of cars. For example, if Sophie drives an average car with a fuel economy of 25 miles per gallon, then she could potentially travel approximately 8 / 25 = 320 miles before running out of gas. But keep in mind that this is just an estimate and actual results may vary depending on various factors such as driving conditions, speed, and maintenance of the vehicle.
"Response:  We know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time he does it (since he ""passe 2 heures à regarder la télévision""). And we also know that he repeats this activity 3 times per week (since he ""repète cela 3 fois par semaine""). So in total, how many hours of TV does Jim watch per week?  

To find out, multiply the number of times he watches TV per week by the amount of time he spends watching TV each time:

3 x 2 = 6 hours/week

Now let's calculate how much time Jim spends reading. Since he reads for half the time he spends watching TV, and he watches TV for 6 hours per week, he must spend 6 / 2 = 3 hours per week reading.

So to summarize, Jim spends 6 hours per week watching TV and 3 hours per week reading. Over the course of 4 weeks, that adds up to:

6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours
3 hours/week x 4 weeks = 12 hours

Therefore, Jim spends a total of 24 + 12 = 36 hours watching TV and reading over the course of 4 weeks."
"Response:  Each school has sent one female team and one male team, so we need to add the number of players on each team. There are five players on each team, so for the four schools, we have:

4 x 5 (female teams) = 20
4 x 5 (male teams) = 20
Total number of players = 20 + 20 = 40

Now, let's consider the coaches. Each school has one coach, so there are four coaches in total:

4 x 1 (coaches) = 4

Therefore, the total number of people the schools have sent is:

40 (players) + 4 (coaches) = 44

So, the answer is 44."
"Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds and 35 rubies in the treasure chest. If there were twice as many emeralds as rubies, then there were 2 x 35 = 70 emeralds. In total, we have:

175 + 70 = 245 precious stones in the treasure chest."
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls in total and each class has 5 students. So if we divide 60 by 5, we get 12 classes with girls. Since boys outnumber girls two to one, there will be twice as many boys as girls. Therefore, there will be 2 x 12 = 24 classes with boys. In total, there will be 12 + 24 = 36 classes. Now, since each class has one teacher, there will be 36 teachers in total.
"Response:  We know that Bailey received an initial amount of money and then got an allowance of $5 per week for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, she had a total of $100. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
Initial Amount + (5 x Number of Weeks) = Total Amount  
Initial Amount + (5 x 8) = $100  
Initial Amount + 40 = $100  
Initial Amount = $60  
So Bailey started with $60."
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and Judy teaches 5 courses per day, so she teaches 5 x 7 = 35 courses per week. Each course has 15 students, so she teaches 35 x 15 = 525 students per week. If each student pays $15, then Judy earns 525 x $15 = $7,875 per week.
Response:  We know that one recipe has 20 instructions and the other has twice as many instructions as the first recipe. So if we multiply 20 by 2, we get 40 instructions for the second recipe. Therefore, to prepare both plates, Kelian must read 40 + 20 = 60 instructions.
"Response:  If Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 each, he will have collected:  
43 x $3 = $130 
If Tommy sells 23 pieces of cheesecake at $4 each, he will have collected:  
23 x $4 = $92 
In total, Tommy has collected:  
$130 + $92 = $222"
"Response:  We know that Sheila bought five phones at $150 each for a total of $750. Since she is paying in three installments, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Installments
= $750 / 3
= $250 per month

Now, since there is an interest charge of 2%, we need to add that to the monthly payment amount. The interest charge will be calculated as follows:

Interest Charge = Total Amount x Interest Rate x Time Period
= $750 x 2% x 3 months
= $45 (rounded to nearest dollar)

So, Sheila will have to pay $250 + $45 = $300 per month for three months."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Artie will make from each type of flower. Then we can add up all these amounts to find out his total earnings.

For soucis, he sells 12 pots at $2.74 per pot, so he makes:

12 x $2.74 = $33.04

For pétunias, he sells 9 pots at $1.87 per pot, so he makes:

9 x $1.87 = $16.83

For bégonias, he sells 17 pots at $2.12 per pot, so he makes:

17 x $2.12 = $35.54

Now let's add up all these amounts to find out Artie's total earnings:

$33.04 + $16.83 + $35.54 = $85.37

So Artie will earn $85.37 today."
"Response:  We know that each floor has half the area of the previous one, so if we start with the top floor and work our way down, we can find out how much space is in each room. The top floor has an area of 16 square feet, which means it takes up half as much space as the next floor below it. Therefore, the second floor from the top must have an area of 8 square feet (half of 16). The third floor from the top must have an area of 4 square feet (half of 8), and the bottom floor must have an area of 2 square feet (half of 4). So, the average area of all four floors is:

(16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet per floor."
"Response:  We know that Cecilia will need to feed her puppy for 180 days during the first year and then for the rest of its life. So we can break down the total number of days into two parts:  
Part 1 (days 1-180): 180 days x 1 bowl/day = 180 bowls  
Part 2 (remaining days of the dog's life): let's assume the dog lives for 10 years (10 x 365 days/year = 3650 days) x 2 bowls/day = 7300 bowls  
Total number of bowls needed: 180 + 7300 = 7480 bowls  
Now, we know that one bag of food contains 110 bowls, so Cecilia will use:  
7480 bowls / 110 bowls/bag = 67.91 bags  
Therefore, Cecilia will use approximately 68 bags of food during the first year, assuming the dog lives for 10 years."
"Response:  We know that Sara makes four times as much laundry detergent as David does. So if David makes x pounds of laundry detergent, then Sara makes 4x pounds. 
We also know that Raymond makes half as much laundry detergent as David does. So if David makes x pounds of laundry detergent, then Raymond makes (1/2)x pounds.  
Now we are given that Sara makes 400 pounds of laundry detergent. This means that David must make 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry detergent. And since Raymond makes half as much as David, he must make 100 / 2 = 50 pounds of laundry detergent. 
So the difference between the amount of laundry detergent made by Raymond and David is:  
50 - 100 = -50 pounds."
"Response:  If he buys 3 flowers for $2.50 or 2 flowers for $1, which option is better?  
Option A: Buy 3 flowers for $2.50 (3 x $2.50 = $7.50)  
Option B: Buy 2 flowers for $1 (2 x $1 = $2)  
Since Option B costs less than Option A, it is the better deal. Therefore, if Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers at the best price, he should choose Option B and pay $2 x 9 = $18."
Response:  First, we know that Jean pays $100 for the toilettage service. Then, the toiletteur offers a 30% discount. To find out how much Jean will pay after the discount, we can multiply $100 by (1 - 0.30) = 100 x 0.70 = $70. So, the final cost of the toilettage service is $70.
Response:  We know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters each, so they got 24 / 6 = 4 liters each. That means they have 4 + 4 = 8 liters in total. Then we gave 6 liters to the boy, so he has 6 - 8 = -2 liters (since negative numbers indicate less than zero). Finally, there are 24 - 8 - (-2) = 14 liters left.
Response:  First, we know that Charlie had 10 autocollants to start with. Then he bought 21 more in a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 autocollants. Next, he received 23 autocollants for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 autocollants. Finally, he gave 9 of them to his sister and used 28 to decorate a card, so now he has 54 - 9 - 28 = 17 autocollants left.
"Response:  We know that Alex weighs 4 times less than Grace, so if Grace weighs x pounds, then Alex weighs 4x pounds. Since they together weigh 200 pounds (the sum of their weights), we can set up an equation:

Grace + Alex = 200

Substituting x for Grace's weight and 4x for Alex's weight, we get:

x + 4x = 200

Simplifying the equation:

5x = 200

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 40

So Grace weighs 40 pounds and Alex weighs 4 times less, or 40/4 = 10 pounds. Therefore, the sum of their weights is:

Grace (40) + Alex (10) = 50 pounds."
"Response:  We know that each of the three roses has 25 flowers and each flower has 8 spines. So we can start by multiplying the number of flowers by the number of spines per flower to get the total number of spines for all three roses:  
25 x 8 = 200 spines per rose  
200 x 3 = 600 spines in total"
"Response:  We know that the team has played 22 matches and won more times than it lost. So if we let W be the number of wins and L be the number of losses, we can write an equation based on this information:
W + L = 22... (1)
Since the team won more times than it lost, we know that W > L. Now, we need to find out how many more times they won than they lost. To do this, we can subtract the number of losses from the number of wins:
W - L =?... (2)
We can substitute equation (1) into equation (2):
W - L = W + L - L
= W + (22 - L)
Now we have two unknowns, W and L. Can you use these equations to find out how many times the team won?"
Response:  We know that Gene has been going on vacation four times a year since he was 23 years old, so for 11 years (from 23 to 34). Therefore, he has gone on 4 x 11 = 44 vacations in total. Each vacation is represented by one T-shirt square, so his blanket will have 44 squares in total.
Response:  We know that the first time the alarm sounded for four times. The second time it sounded three times longer than the first time, so it sounded for 4 x 3 = 12 times. The third time it sounded two times shorter than the second time, so it sounded for 12 x 2 = 24 times. In total, the alarm has sounded 4 + 12 + 24 = 40 times.
"Response:  We know that Sylvie has been working for five years in December last year and her salary is increased by 10% after every five years of service. So, if she has worked for three more years, her salary will be increased by 10% thrice. Therefore, her annual salary after three more years will be:  
$600 x (1 + 0.10) ^3 = $600 x 1.30^3 = $847.42 per month."
"Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harald. So if Marilyn sold x records, then Harald sold 1/10 of x = 0.1x records. Since they together sold 88,000 records, we can set up the equation:

0.1x + x = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:

1.1x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 1.1:

x = 80,000

So Harald sold 80,000 records."
Response:  If one quarter of the invited guests do not show up, then three fourths will show up. So, if she has invited 16 friends, then three fourths of 16 is 12. Therefore, 12 friends will show up. Since each gift bag costs $2, Christina will spend $2 x 12 = $24 on gift bags.
"Response:  We know that each adult will need 10 pounds of salad and half as much for an child (since there are 5 children, we multiply this amount by 5 to get the total amount needed for all children). So, in total, we have:  
Adults: 20 x 10 = 200 pounds  
Children: 5 x 5 = 25 pounds  
Total: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds  
Therefore, Ted needs to bring approximately 225 pounds of salad to feed everyone at the picnic."
Response:  We know that Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia and two more than Cindy. So if Cindy has four animals, then Marcia must have six (4 x 3 = 12 + 2). Therefore, Jan will have twelve (6 x 3 = 18) pets in total. All three of them together will have twenty animals.
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So we can start with these two equations:
Amy - Jackson = 5... (1)
Corey - Amy = 2... (2)
Now we are given that Jacques has 10 years and 1 year less than Corey. This means that Jacques is 9 years old, so we can add this to equation (2):
Corey - Amy = 2 + 9 = 11... (3)
Now we have three equations and three unknowns (Jackson's age, Amy's age, and Corey's age). Can you solve for Jackson's age using these equations?"
Response:  We know that Lee used to run the 400 meters hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald before any changes were made. So if Lee ran in 38 seconds, then Gerald must have run in 40 seconds (2 seconds slower). Now we are told that after changing his diet, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. This means that he reduced his time by 10% of 40 seconds, which is 4 seconds. Therefore, Gerald will now run the race in 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.
"Response:  We know that there are 60 dogs and each dog has two cats as companions, so we can start by counting how many cats there are in total.  
Therefore, if there are 60 dogs, then there will be 60 x 2 = 120 cats. 
Now, let's count the number of rabbits. We know that there are 12 fewer rabbits than the total number of animals in the quarter. So, to find out how many rabbits there are, we need to subtract 12 from the total number of animals.  
Total number of animals = 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 188. 
So, there are 188 domestic animals in the quarter."
Response:  We know that there are 200 students in total and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is 200 x 2/5 = 40. Now we know that 2/3 of the remaining students (i.e., girls) are members of the scouts. Therefore, the number of girls who are not members of the scouts can be found by subtracting the number of girls who are members from the total number of girls. The number of girls who are members is 200 x 2/3 = 66.67 (round up to 67). So, the number of girls who are not members is: 200 - 67 = 133. Therefore, there are 133 girls who do not belong to the scouts.
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night and his friend Jacques only slept for 2/3 of that time. So we can start by finding out how many hours Jacques slept.  
We know that Jacques slept for 2/3 of the time Harry did, so if Harry slept for x hours, then Jacques slept for 2x/3 hours.  
Now we need to find out how much more time Harry spent sleeping than Jacques did. To do this, we can subtract the amount of time Jacques slept from the amount of time Harry slept:  
Harry slept for x hours, so he slept for 9 - x hours.  
Jacques slept for 2x/3 hours, so he slept for 2(9)/3 hours = 6x/3 hours.  
Now we can subtract the two amounts to find out how much more time Harry spent sleeping:  
9 - x - 6x/3 =?  
Simplifying and solving for x gives us:  
x = 8 hours  
So Harry slept for 8 hours more than Jacques did."
"Response:  We know that each box of tomatoes contains three tomatoes and has a weight of 16 ounces (oz). So, if we want to calculate how many tomatoes were used in total, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of tomatoes per box. In this case, it would be:  

Number of tomatoes = Number of boxes x Number of tomatoes per box  
= 32 oz / 16 oz/box x 3 tomatoes/box  
= 3 boxes  

Therefore, Freda used 3 boxes of tomatoes, which means she used 9 tomatoes in total (3 boxes x 3 tomatoes/box)."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 30 cars on the highway and 5 cars left the line to avoid the traffic jam. So, we start with 30 - 5 = 25 cars remaining in the queue.  
Now, we know that some cars managed to advance during the first 15 minutes, but we don't know exactly how many. Let's assume that x cars advanced during this time period (x being any positive integer).  
We also know that 20 cars advanced during the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam. Therefore, the total number of cars that advanced during both periods is 20 + x.  
However, since 5 cars left the line, the total number of cars that crossed the traffic jam is equal to the number of cars that advanced minus the number of cars that left the line:  
Total number of cars crossing the traffic jam = (20 + x) - 5  
Simplifying the expression, we get:  
Total number of cars crossing the traffic jam = 20 + x - 5  
Solving for x, we find that:  
x = 10  
Therefore, 10 cars advanced during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, and 20 cars advanced during the last 15 minutes, for a total of 30 cars crossing the traffic jam."
Response:  If Marie already has 2 plants on each of her 40 windowsills, that means she currently has 2 x 40 = 80 plants in total. Now, if tomorrow she gives one plant to each of her friends and relatives (let's assume there are x number of them), then she will have 80 - x plants left. So, the final number of plants Marie will have is 80 - x.
Response:  We know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jérôme opened the door. The second friend pressed it for 20 x (1/4) = 5 times. The third friend pressed it for 20 x (10) = 200 times. In total, all four friends pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 + 200 = 225 times.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 days left for him to finish reading all of his manuals and he has already read 15 pages on Monday. So we can start by calculating how many pages he needs to read in total.  
Total number of pages = (20 + 7 + 8) x 4 = 35 x 4 = 140 pages  
Now let's calculate how many pages he needs to read each day: Total number of pages / Number of days left = 140 pages / 4 days = 35 pages per day Therefore, he needs to read an average of 35 pages per day for the next four days to complete his assigned reading."
Response:  We know that Jean drinks one glass of water at breakfast, lunch and dinner every day (3 times). So he drinks 3 x 7 = 21 glasses of water per week during the weekdays. On weekends, he prefers to relax and drinks one soda instead of water at dinner time. Therefore, we can subtract 1 from the total number of glasses of water drunk during the weekdays, which gives us 21 - 1 = 20 glasses of water consumed by Jean in one week.
"Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes for the fog bank to cover 3 miles of the city. So if we want to find out how many minutes it will take to cover the entire city (which is 42 miles long), we need to divide the length of the city by the distance covered per minute. In this case, we can calculate as follows:

42 miles / 3 miles/minute = 14 minutes
Therefore, it will take 14 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city."
"Response:  If Poppy has placed one quarter of the pieces (25%), then she has placed 25 x 1000 = 250 pieces.
Now, if her mother has placed one third of the remaining pieces (33%), then she has placed 33 x 750 = 250 pieces as well.
In total, there are now 250 + 250 = 500 pieces placed.
So, there are still 500 - 500 = 0 pieces left to be placed!"
Response:  We know that Cody eats three times as many biscuits as Amir, so if Amir eats 5 biscuits, Cody will eat 3 x 5 = 15 biscuits. Therefore, the total number of biscuits consumed by both Cody and Amir is 5 + 15 = 20 biscuits.
Response:  We know that each box has an interior volume of $5 \times 6 \times 4 = 120$ cubic inches (since each side is 5 inches long and there are 3 sides). Since each wall is 1 inch thick, we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of each box. So, the net volume of each box is $120 - 3 \times 1 = 117$ cubic inches. Therefore, the total volume of all three boxes is $117 + 117 + 117 = 351$ cubic inches.
"Response:  We know that Frankie watched for 1 hour each day from Monday to Wednesday and for 2 hours on Thursday (including 1 episode of an hour and a half). On Friday, he watched for 2 hours again. In total, this makes 6 hours of television watching. Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we can calculate how many episodes Frankie has watched as follows:  
6 hours / 30 minutes per episode = 20 episodes  
Therefore, Frankie watched 20 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Henri prepared twice as many cookies this year than last year. So if he prepared x cookies last year, he prepared 2x = 2x + 15 more cookies this year (since he made 15 extra). Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:

2x + 15 = 110

Now let's simplify the equation:

2x = 95

So, Henri prepared 95 cookies last year."
"Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gas at $3 per gallon, they will pay $3 x 10 = $30 for the gas. However, if they use the company's app and fill up at that specific station, they will receive a rebate of $0.20 per gallon, so they will actually pay less than $30. To find out how much less they will pay, we can multiply $30 by the number of gallons they bought (10) and then subtract the total amount of rebates they received ($0.20 x 10 = $2):

$30 x 10 = $300 - $2 = $298

So, after applying the rebates, the person will pay $298 for 10 gallons of gas instead of $300."
"Response:  We know that Marcell has three large rolls and 14 long rolls, so he has a total of 3 + 14 = 17 rolls in all. Each large roll contains 8 pieces of fruit, so Marcell eats 3 x 8 = 24 pieces of fruit from his large rolls. Each long roll contains 6 pieces of fruit, so Marcell eats 14 x 6 = 84 pieces of fruit from his long rolls. In total, Marcell eats 24 + 84 = 108 pieces of fruit.
Now let's look at Béatrice. She has two large rolls and 24 long rolls, so she has a total of 2 + 24 = 26 rolls in all. Each large roll contains 8 pieces of fruit, so Béatrice eats 2 x 8 = 16 pieces of fruit from her large rolls. Each long roll contains 6 pieces of fruit, so Béatrice eats 24 x 6 = 144 pieces of fruit from her long rolls. In total, Béatrice eats 16 + 144 = 160 pieces of fruit.
So, if each of them had entirely eaten their rolls, Marcell would have eaten an average of 108 / 2 = 54 pieces of fruit per person, while Béatrice would have eaten an average of 160 / 2 = 80 pieces of fruit per person."
"Response:  We know that the boat took 16 seconds to travel 20 feet, so we can calculate its speed as follows:
Speed = Distance / Time
= 20 ft / 16 sec
= 1.25 ft/sec
Now, we need to find out how much water the boat has taken in. We are given that it takes 2 liters of water every 10 feet traveled towards the shore. So, if the boat traveled for 20 feet, it would have taken in:
Water Taken In = Distance x Water Per Foot
= 20 ft x 2 liters/10 ft
= 4 liters
Therefore, when Julia reached the shore after 64 seconds, the boat had taken in 4 liters of water."
"Response:  We have four teachers who use the classroom at different times of the day. Each teacher gives two classes per day and uses the blackboard for each class. If we assume that each class lasts for one hour (60 minutes), then we can calculate how many times the blackboard needs to be cleaned in a day as follows:

1. Number of classes per day = 4 x 2 = 8 classes
2. Total time spent teaching per day = 8 x 60 = 480 minutes
3. Time between classes = 480 / 8 = 60 minutes (since each class lasts for 60 minutes)
4. Number of times the blackboard needs to be cleaned per day = 60 / 3 = 20 times
5. Therefore, the blackboard needs to be cleaned 20 times in a day."
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers each day and 5 flowers do not grow, then he will have 2 + 0 = 2 flowers on the first day. On the second day, he will have 2 + 2 = 4 flowers. Continuing this pattern, after 15 days, he will have 2 + 2 +... + 2 = 30 flowers in his garden.
"Response:  We know that the phone of Jamal has six times more storage capacity than the phone of Brittany. So if Brittany's phone can store 50 times as many photos as there are birds in the picture taken by Jamal, then we can find out how many birds are in the picture by dividing the number of photos that Brittany's phone can store by 50.

Let's assume that Brittany's phone can store x photos. Then, we know that Jamal's phone can store 6x photos. Since each photo takes up the same amount of space, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

6x = 50x + 1800 (since Brittany's phone can store 50 times as many photos as Jamal's)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 36

So Brittany's phone can store 36 photos. Now, let's find out how many birds are in the picture taken by Jamal. We know that there are 50 birds in the picture, so we can divide the number of photos that Brittany's phone can store by the number of birds in the picture to find out how many birds are in each photo:

36 / 50 = 0.72

Therefore, there are approximately 0.72 birds in each photo taken by Jamal."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha will make from selling each type of board. Then we can add up all her earnings to find out her total profit.
For the 2x4 boards, she has 10 boards at $10 each = $100.
For the 4x4 boards, she has 5 boards at $16 each = $80.
Total earnings = $100 + $80 = $180."
"Response:  We know that Katy has used 120 cuillères à café of sugar and water in total. She uses a ratio of 7:13 to prepare her coffee, which means she needs 7 parts of sugar and 13 parts of water. To find out how many cuillères à café of water she has used, we can divide the number of cuillères à café of sugar by the ratio:  
7/7 = 1 (since 7 is divided evenly by 7)  
13/7 = 18 (since 13 is not divisible by 7)  
So, Katy has used 1 cup of water for every 18 cuillères à café of sugar. Now, let's calculate how many cuillères à café of water she has used:  
120 / 18 = 6.67 (rounded to the nearest whole number)  
Therefore, Katy has used approximately 7 cuillères à café of water."
"Response:  If Jean has three children and buys two pairs of shoes for each child, then he will buy a total of six pairs of shoes (3 x 2 = 6). The cost of one pair of shoes is $60, so the total amount that Jean pays is:

6 pairs x $60/pair = $60 x 6 = $360"
Response:  We know that there were 2 containers of vehicles imported on the first day and each container had 5 vehicles inside. So, in total, there were 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles imported on the first day. On the second day, we are told that 30 vehicles were present in the port, so we can assume that all 30 vehicles were not imported on the same day as they would have been counted in the previous day's count. Therefore, we need to find out how many more containers were imported on the second day. To do this, we subtract the number of vehicles imported on the first day (10) from the total number of vehicles present in the port on the second day (30): 30 - 10 = 20. This means that 20 more containers of vehicles were imported on the second day.
"Response:  We know that Adrien had a starting salary of $40,000 and it increased by 30% to become $52,000 four years later. So, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New Salary = Old Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase)
= $40,000 x (1 + 0.30)
= $40,000 x 1.30
= $52,000

Now, let's find out how much Lylah earned four years ago. Since her salary was 30% lower than Adrien's, we can say that her starting salary was:

Lylah's Starting Salary = Adrien's Starting Salary x (1 - Percentage Difference)
= $40,000 x (1 - 0.30)
= $40,000 x 0.70
= $28,000

We also know that both salaries increased simultaneously by 30%. So, we can calculate their new salaries in the same way:

New Salary = Old Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase)
= $28,000 x (1 + 0.30)
= $28,000 x 1.30
= $36,400

Therefore, Adrien earns $52,000 and Lylah earns $36,400 four years after their initial salaries."
"Response:  We know that Miguel uses two boxes of paper per week, and each box contains 30 sheets of paper. So, to find out how many sheets of paper he uses per month, we need to multiply the number of weeks in a month by the number of boxes of paper he uses per week. There are four weeks in a month, so:

4 weeks x 2 boxes/week = 8 boxes/month

Since each box contains 30 sheets of paper, Miguel uses:

8 boxes/month x 30 sheets/box = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper per month."
Response:  We know that Morisette brought 5 pommes and 8 oranges for a total of 13 fruits. Since Kael brought two times more pommes than Morisette, Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 pommes. Additionally, since Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette, Kael brought (1/2) x 8 = 4 oranges. Therefore, in total, Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. So, altogether, Morisette and Kael brought 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.
"Response:  We know that Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday and then she slept for 2 hours less each of the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday). So, her sleep schedule for those three days would be:

Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday: 6 hours (2 hours less than Monday)
Wednesday: 4 hours (2 hours less than Tuesday)

Now, we are told that for the rest of the week, Sadie slept for 1 hour more each day than she did during those first three days. So, if we calculate the number of hours she slept for the remaining four days of the week, we get:

Thursday: 5 hours (1 hour more than Wednesday)
Friday: 6 hours (1 hour more than Thursday)
Saturday: 7 hours (1 hour more than Friday)
Sunday: 8 hours (the same as Monday)

Adding up all these numbers gives us a total of:

8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 39 hours

Therefore, Sadie slept for a total of 39 hours throughout the entire week."
"Response:  We know that Rosie runs at two different speeds: 
10 miles per hour for 3 hours (3 x 10 = 30 miles) 
5 miles per hour for 4 hours (4 x 5 = 20 miles) Total distance traveled = 30 + 20 = 50 miles."
Response:  If Jennie has tampered with one-third of the letters to be stamped and there are now 30 letters in the pile of stamped letters, then she must have had 90 letters to begin with (1/3 x 60 = 20 + 60 = 90).
Response:  We know that Julia had 3 cuillères to taste her ragout during cooking and she used 3 of them. So, there were 3 - 3 = 0 cuillères left in the packet that Julia bought. But we also know that her husband gave her 5 new cuillères later. Therefore, the number of cuillères in the packet that Julia bought is equal to the number of cuillères she received from her husband minus the number of cuillères she used, which is 5 - 3 = 2. So, there were 2 cuillères in the packet that Julia bought.
"Response:  We know that Dylan bought more sausages of fish than he needed for chicken sausage. So let's say he bought x sausages of fish and y sausages of chicken. Since there are 38 sausages of chicken, we can set up an equation:

x + y = 38 (since there are 38 sausages in total)

We also know that Dylan has 6 more sausages of fish than he needs for chicken sausage. This means that if he had x sausages of fish, he would have 6 more:

x + 6 = y (since he has 6 more fish sausages than he needs for chicken sausage)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use substitution or elimination to solve for x and y?"
Response:  If Amy has made 20 new friends in her new school and Lily has made 50 friends, then together they have 20 + 50 = 70 friends.
"Response:  We know that one pastèque costs three times more than one poivron, so if we want to buy four pastèques, we will have to pay four times as much for them as we would for four poivrons. Since each poivron costs $15, then four poivrons will cost $15 x 4 = $60.
Now let's look at the oranges. If one orange costs five times less than one pastèque, and one pastèque costs $3x, then one orange must cost $3x/5 = $6x/5. Since we need ten oranges, we will have to pay $6x/5 for all of them, which is $60/5 = $12.
Therefore, the total amount that Dillon will have to spend is $60 + $12 = $72."
"Response:  We need to calculate how many hours are spent per day and then multiply that number with the hourly rate of each doctor and hospital. Finally, we will subtract the cost incurred by the hospital from its revenue to find out the profit.

Time Spent Per Day = Number of Patients x Average Time per Patient
= 500 x 24/60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
= 3000 minutes or 50 hours

Hourly Rate of Doctors = $150 per hour
Hourly Rate of Hospital = $200 per hour

Total Revenue = Total Time Spent x Hourly Rate of Doctor + Hourly Rate of Hospital
= 50 hours x $150 + $200
= $7500 + $10,000
= $17,500

Cost Incurred by Hospital = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $17,500 - ($150 x 50 doctors + $200 x 50 hours)
= $17,500 - ($7500 + $10,000)
= $17,500 - $17,500
= $0

Therefore, the hospital realizes no profit since the total cost incurred is equal to the total revenue generated."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 60 lutins and then:

* A third of them (20) quit after being vomited on.
* Then, 10 more quit after being kicked in the shin.

So, we need to subtract these numbers from the original number:

60 - 20 = 40
40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 lutins left."
"Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than in May. So, in June, he spent $500 - $60 = $440. Therefore, the total amount Joseph spent during both months is:
$500 + $440 = $940."
Response:  First, we know that each ride costs 6 tickets, so if Pam made 2 rides (the tour of the roller coaster twice), she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets. And if Fred made 4 rides (the tour of the roller coaster four times), he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets. Then, they both did two runs on the bumper cars, which means they used an additional 2 x 6 = 12 tickets. In total, Pam and Fred have used 12 + 24 + 12 = 58 tickets.
"Response:  We know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 6 times more than that on Tuesday (since ""Tuesday"" is mentioned after ""Monday""). So, he walked 4 x 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday. Therefore, his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday (including Wednesday) is:

4 + 24 = 28 miles

So, Walt walked 28 miles on Wednesday."
Response:  If Tom does 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then he spends $60 per month (4 x $15). Over the course of a year, that's $720 ($60 x 12 months).
"Response:  If Brian has lost 5 games before the comparison, he will have 20 - 5 = 15 games left. Since Bobby owns 5 fewer games than 3 times the number of games that Brian owns, we can set up an equation as follows:

Let X be the number of games owned by Bobby.
Since Bobby owns 5 fewer games than 3 times the number of games that Brian owns, we can write:
X = 3(15) - 5
= 45 - 5
= 40

Therefore, Bobby owns 40 games."
Response:  We know that there are only 27 licornes in the world and two thirds of them are women. So we can start with the fact that two thirds of 27 is equal to 18 (since 2/3 of 27 = 18). Now, since one third of all licornes are located in Scotland, we need to find out how many licornes are in Scotland. One third of 18 is equal to 6 (since 1/3 of 18 = 6), so there are 6 licornes in Scotland.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item in Rory's order:

* 2 submarines x $7.50 = $15.00
* 2 bags of fries x $1.50 = $3.00
* 2 biscuits x $1.00 = $2.00

Total cost before tax and tip: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Now let's apply the 20% delivery fee:

$20.00 x 20% = $4.00

So the total cost with delivery is: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, Rory adds a $5.00 tip, bringing the grand total to:

$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00"
"Response:  We know that Marc passed the first test in 8 hours with 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. So, we can calculate how many questions he answered in 8 hours as follows:

Questions answered = Number of questions x Hours spent
= 75 x 8
= 600

Now, let's look at the second test. We know that Marc took 6 hours to complete it and there were 100 questions. If he maintained the same pace of answering 5 questions per hour, we can calculate how many questions he would have answered as follows:

Questions answered = Number of questions x Hours spent
= 100 x 6
= 600

Since Marc answered 600 questions in both tests, we can subtract the number of questions he answered in the second test from the total number of questions in the second test to find out how many questions remained unanswered:

Unanswered questions = Total number of questions - Questions answered
= 100 - 600
= 400

Therefore, Marc left 400 questions unanswered during the second test."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 times more blue balls than rose balls. So if we have 12 blue balls, how many rose balls will we have?  
Let's use the ratio of blue to rose balls to find out. If there are 22 times more blue balls, then for every one blue ball, there are 22 rose balls. Therefore, if we have 12 blue balls, we have 12 x 22 = 264 rose balls."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for rental and we have to find out how many of them are semi-automatic. So, if we subtract the number of manual cars (4) from the total number of cars (20), we get:

20 - 4 = 16

So, there are 16 cars left. Now, if we divide the number of semi-automatic cars (which is half of the remaining cars) by the total number of cars, we get:

8 / 20 = 0.4 or 40%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 40%."
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees and twice as many baby bees as queen bees. So if we let X represent the number of worker bees, then there would be 2X baby bees. Since there are 700 total bees in the hive, we can set up the equation:

3X + 2(2X) = 700

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3X + 4X = 700

Combine like terms:

7X = 700

Divide both sides by 7:

X = 100

So there are 100 worker bees in the hive."
"Response:  If Jordan spends 2 hours per day playing video games and works 10 hours per week at his part-time job, he has 5 days to work (since there are 7 days in a week). So, he works for 5 x 4 = 20 hours per week. At $10/hour, his weekly earnings from his job would be:  

$10 x 20 = $200

Therefore, if Jordan spent all of his time working instead of playing video games, he would earn an additional $200 per week."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much each item costs without tax and then add up all of those amounts with their respective tax rates applied.

For the milk, it costs $2 without tax so the total cost including tax would be:
$2 x (1 + 0.10) = $2 x 1.10 = $2.20

For the eggs, they cost $3 without tax so the total cost including tax would be:
$3 x (1 + 0.10) = $3 x 1.10 = $3.30

For the light bulbs, they cost $3 without tax so the total cost including tax would be:
$3 x (1 + 0.10) = $3 x 1.10 = $3.30

For the cups, they cost $3 without tax so the total cost including tax would be:
$3 x (1 + 0.10) = $3 x 1.10 = $3.30

For the mouse traps, they cost $4 without tax so the total cost including tax would be:
$4 x (1 + 0.10) = $4 x 1.10 = $4.40

Now let's add up all these items:
$2.20 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $17.50

So the total cost of everything is $17.50."
"Response:  We know that Kim has 3 clients already and he is confident of getting 5 more. So, in total, he will have 8 clients. For each client, he needs to buy 2 bottles of water and one pack of rags, so his total cost per week will be:

2 x $2 (water) + 1 x $5 (rags) = $6

So, his total revenue per week will be:

8 x $92 (revenue per client) = $744

Subtracting his total cost from his total revenue gives us:

$744 - $6 = $738

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $738 per week."
Response:  We know that there are 100 ananas per hectare and Jean has 10 hectares of land. So, he has 10 x 100 = 1000 ananas per hectare. Since he harvests every 3 months, he will have 4 harvests in one year (3 months x 4 = 12 months). Therefore, he can collect 1000 x 4 = 4000 ananas in one year.
"Response:  We know that Johnny has collected toys from his room and among them are Lego sets with different number of pieces. We can start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* The first Lego set had 500 pieces.
* The second Lego set had three times as many pieces as the first one (i.e., 3 x 500 = 1500).
* The third Lego set had one-quarter of the number of pieces as the second set (i.e., 1500 / 4 = 375).

Now, let's add up all the piece counts:

500 + 1500 + 375 = 2475

Therefore, Johnny collects 2475 Lego pieces in total."
Response:  We know that in the first six hours, there were 30 bees leaving and half of them returned (15). In the next six hours, twice as many bees left as had left before (2 x 15 = 30), but we don't know if they all came back yet. So let's divide the number of bees who left during this period by two to find out how many did not come back yet (30 / 2 = 15). Now, we have a total of 15 bees who did not return yet + 15 bees who returned during the first six hours = 30 bees still outside. During the last six hours, all these bees returned to the hive (30). Therefore, during the last six hours, 30 bees returned to the hive.
Response:  We know that the price of one child ticket is $10 and the price of one adult ticket is $12. So if the mother gave $8 to the cashier, she must have given $8 + $10 = $18 in total. Therefore, the answer is $18.
"Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothée does. So if Dorothée has x friends, Charlie will have 3x friends. And we also know that Jacques has four times as many friends as Dorothée does. So Jacques will have 4x friends. Now we are given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Charlie = 3(Dorothée) = 3(x) = 3x
Jacques = 4(Dorothée) = 4(x) = 4x
We know that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can substitute this value into one of the equations:  

3x = 12
Now solve for x to find out how many friends Dorothée has:  

x = 12 / 3 = 4
Therefore, Dorothée has 4 friends on Facebook. And since Jacques has four times as many friends as Dorothée does, Jacques has:  

4x = 4(4) = 16
So Jacques has 16 friends on Facebook."
"Response:  We know that Steve lives farther away from school than Tim and has to use his bike, so he will take longer to arrive home. We also know that Tim is using a skateboard and traveling at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take Tim to finish the race, we need to divide the distance between their homes by Tim's speed:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = (3 miles) / (264 ft/min)  
Time = 11.3 minutes  
So, Tim will finish the race in approximately 11.3 minutes. Now, let's calculate how much longer Steve will take to arrive home. We know that Steve is traveling at a speed of 440 feet per minute on his bike:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = (2 miles) / (440 ft/min)  
Time = 5 minutes  
Steve will arrive home after Tim by approximately 5 minutes. Therefore, the winner will have to wait for approximately 11.3 + 5 = 16.3 minutes before the loser arrives home."
"Response:  We know that each bicycle has two tires and one tricycle has three tires. So in total, there are 5 + 3 = 8 tires to inflate. And we also know that the cost of inflating each tire is $0.25. Therefore, the total amount earned that day would be:  
8 x $0.25 = $2.00"
"Response:  First, we know that Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six biscuits. So, in total, Carl buys 10 x 6 = 60 biscuits. We also know that each biscuit costs $0.10, so the total cost of all the biscuits is 60 x $0.10 = $6. Now, if Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will receive $10 - $6 = $4 in change. Therefore, the numeric answer to the question is $4."""
Response:  We know that Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the bag. The seagull ate half of what was left (which is 7 fries). Then, three pigeons each ate 3 fries, leaving 2 fries. A raton laveur then took two thirds of those remaining (which is 2/3 x 2 = 4 fries), and finally, ants carried away one fry. Therefore, there were initially 14 + 7 + 3 + 4 = 28 fries in the bag when Dave bought it.
Response:  We know that there are 3 days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and each day has 2 courses of 2 hours each. So, total number of hours per week = 2 x 2 = 4 hours/week. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, total number of hours for the semester = 4 hours/week x 16 weeks = 64 hours.
"Response:  We know that we have three types of bread products: small loaves (petit pain), large loaves (croissant au chocolat), and long loaves (baguette). We also know their respective lengths in inches:

* Small loaves: 4 inches each
* Large loaves: 6 inches each
* Long loaves: 2 feet each (since there are 12 inches in a foot, this is equivalent to 2 x 12 = 24 inches)

Now, let's calculate the total length of all the bread products if they were placed end to end:

Small loaves: 300 x 4 = 1200 inches
Large loaves: 120 x 6 = 720 inches
Long loaves: 60 x 24 = 1440 inches

Adding up these values gives us a grand total of:

1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Therefore, the total length of all the bread products if they were placed end to end would be approximately 3360 inches or 280 feet!"
"Response:  We know that we need to order bananas for each species of monkeys in the zoo. For every 2 months, we have to order:  
* 200 bananas for macaques (since they require 200 per month) x 2 = 400 bananas  
* 400 bananas for gorillas (since they require 400 per month) x 2 = 800 bananas  
* 100 bananas for baboons (since they require 100 per month) x 2 = 200 bananas  
Therefore, the total number of bananas needed for two months is: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas."
"Response:  We know that Blake did 15 allers-retours and each one is 100 yards long, so he ran for 15 x 100 = 1500 yards in total.
Kelly did 34 allers-retours, but she only ran half the distance because she stopped at the 40-yard line after each one. So she ran for 34 x (40/100) = 34 x 0.4 = 136 yards in total.
Therefore, Blake ran 1500 - 136 = 1364 yards more than Kelly."
Response:  We know that Raphael bought 4 pens for $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on pens (4 x $1.5). He also bought two notebooks for $4 each, so he spent another $8 on notebooks (2 x $4). Finally, he bought paper for $20. So in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 11 tadpoles in the pond and we saw 6 come out from under a water lily. So, let's subtract the number of tadpoles that came out from under the water lily (6) from the initial number of tadpoles (11). This gives us:

11 - 6 = 5

So, there are now 5 tadpoles left in the pond. Then, we see 2 more tadpoles hiding under a rock. Therefore, the total number of tadpoles remaining in the pond is:

5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 tadpoles left in the pond after Finn observed them."
"Response:  We know that the water level in the reservoir increased by 7 feet from Monday to Tuesday and then decreased by two-thirds of the previous day's amount (Tuesday) on Wednesday. So we can start with the following equation:

Initial Water Level + Increase = Final Water Level

We know that the initial water level on Monday was 17 feet deep, so let's substitute this value into our equation:

17 + 7 = F

Where F is the final water level on Wednesday. Solving for F, we get:

F = 24

So the water level in the reservoir on Wednesday is 24 feet deep."
"Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 hippocampuses, and 3 clown fish. Locsin caught fewer starfish than Anakin (5 less), fewer hippocampuses than Anakin (3 less), but more clown fish than Anakin (2 more). So, if we add up what they both caught, we get:  
10 + 5 = 15 starfish  
6 + 3 = 9 hippocampuses  
3 + 2 = 5 clown fish  
Total: 15 + 9 + 5 = 29 fish."
"Response:  If the price increases by 20% every two months, then after one month, it will increase by 20/12 = 1.67%. So, if the initial price is x, then the price after one month will be x + (1.67x) = 1.67x + x = 3.34x.
Now, we know that the price of the bag of balls will increase by 20% every two months, so after three months, the price will be:
Price after three months = Price after one month x 1.67 = 3.34x x 1.67 = 5.59x
Therefore, the price of the bag of balls after 36 months will be:
Price after 36 months = Price after three months x 12 = 5.59x x 12 = 67.08x
So, the price of the bag of balls after 36 months will be approximately $67.08."
"Response:  We know that the poupée costs as much as three figurines, so we can write an equation based on this information:

Poupée = 3 x Figurine

We also know that one figurine costs $5, so we can substitute this value into our previous equation:

Poupée = 3 x $5

Now we have:

Poupée = 3 x $5

Simplifying:

Poupée = $15

Next, we need to find out how much each car costs. We are told that one car costs $4, so we can multiply this value by the number of cars:

Cars = Number of cars x $4

Cars = 5 x $4

Now we have:

Cars = $20

Finally, we add up the cost of all the toys:

Total Cost = Poupée + Cars

Substituting values:

Total Cost = $15 + $20

Solving for total cost:

Total Cost = $35

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $35."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time it takes for Jackie to do her taxes herself and then compare that with the cost of hiring an accountant.

Time taken to do taxes herself = 3 hours (as mentioned in the problem)
Cost of hiring an accountant = $90 (as mentioned in the problem)

Now, let's calculate the hourly wage she would earn if she does her taxes herself:
Hourly wage = Time taken x Hourly rate
= 3 hours x $35/hour
= $105

Since she can earn $105 by doing her taxes herself, she needs to compare this amount with the cost of hiring an accountant ($90). If she chooses to hire an accountant, she will have to pay $90, which means she will lose out on the opportunity to earn $105. Therefore, the best decision for her is to do her taxes herself."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money she spent on the computer and its accessories. We know that the computer costs 1090 €, and she also bought an ecran (screen), a keyboard, and a mouse, which cost 157 € + 74 € + 74 € = 305 € in total. So, the total amount she spent on the computer and its accessories is:

1090 € + 305 € = 1395 €

Now, let's subtract the amount she spent from her budget of 1500 €:

1500 € - 1395 € = 105 €

Therefore, she will have 105 € left for her vêtements (clothes)."
Response:  If Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan and she has to make 15 cakes with cream for her school fundraiser, then she will need 3 x 15 = 45 eggs in total. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits her daughter, Sandra must babysit her daughter 45/9 = 5 times to get all the eggs she needs.
"Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke now, so if we let S be the age of Seth and B be the age of Brooke, we can write:
S = 2B... (1)
We also know that in two years, their ages will add up to 28. So we can write:
S + B = 28... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for S?"
Response:  We know that Jimmy has $2 more than twice Ethel's amount. So if Ethel has $8, then Jimmy has $8 + 2 = $10.
"Response:  We know that Pancho walks 20 miles every day except for the weekends when he only walks 10 miles. So, if we add up all the days of the week, we get :

20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 80 miles

Therefore, Pancho walks 80 miles in one week."
"Response:  We know that each uniform consists of a hat, a jacket, and pants. The price of the hat is $25, the jacket is three times more expensive than the hat, and the pants are equally priced to the hat and jacket. So we can start by finding out how much the jacket costs. 
3 x $25 = $75
Now we know that the jacket costs $75. Since the pants cost as much as the hat and jacket, we can find out their price by adding the prices of the hat and jacket together.  
$25 + $75 = $100
So the pants cost $100. Now we have all the prices we need to calculate the total cost of each uniform. 
Total Cost = Hat Price + Jacket Price + Pants Price
= $25 + $75 + $100
= $200
Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $200."
"Response:  We know that Jake sees:

* 80 araignées à 8 pattes = 80 x 8 = 640 pattes
* 90 insectes à 6 pattes = 90 x 6 = 540 pattes
* 3 invertébrés mutants rares à 10 pattes = 3 x 10 = 30 pattes

Adding all these numbers together gives us a total of:

640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 pattes

So, in total, Jake sees 1210 pattes in the museum d'entomologie."
"Response:  We know that Sally Four is 3 years older than Sally Two, so Sally Four must be 3 + 2 = 5 years old. Since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old and has the same age as Sally Four, we can say that Sally Thirtytwo is also 5 years old. Now, let's look at the information given about Granny Red. She is two times more aged than Sally Two, which means she is 2 x 2 = 4 years older than Sally Two. So, Granny Red is 4 + 2 = 6 years old. Therefore, the total age of all four birds is:
Sally Two (2) + Sally Four (5) + Sally Thirtytwo (5) + Granny Red (6) = 18 years."
"Response:  We know that Jessica has three debts with different monthly payments:  
1. Student loan: $300/month  
2. Credit card: $200/month  
3. Mortgage: $500/month  
If she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum for each debt, we can calculate the total amount she needs to pay extra per month as follows:  
For the student loan: 50% of $300 = $150  
For the credit card: 50% of $200 = $100  
For the mortgage: 50% of $500 = $250  
Total extra payment per month: $150 + $100 + $250 = $500  
Now let's calculate how much Jessica will pay in one year if she pays this extra amount every month. For the student loan:  
$300 (minimum payment) + $150 (extra payment) = $450/month x 12 months = $5,400/year  
For the credit card:  
$200 (minimum payment) + $100 (extra payment) = $300/month x 12 months = $3,600/year  
For the mortgage:  
$500 (minimum payment) + $250 (extra payment) = $750/month x 12 months = $9,000/year  
In total, Jessica will pay:  
$5,400 + $3,600 + $9,000 = $18,000 in one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum for all her debts."
"Response:  We know that Billy needs approximately one and a half minutes (1.5 min) to epluch each potato. Since he has 60 potatoes, we can calculate as follows:  
60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes 
Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 90 minutes to prepare all the potatoes for his family barbecue."
"Response:  We know that they have sold 20 glasses of lemonade and each glass costs $0.50. So, their total revenue is:

20 x $0.50 = $10

We also know that they spent $3 per gallon on lemons and $2 per gallon on sugar. Since they sold 20 glasses, they must have used 20/4 = 5 gallons of lemonade (since there are 4 quarts in a gallon). Therefore, their total cost for lemons is:

5 x $3 = $15

And their total cost for sugar is:

5 x $2 = $10

So, their total cost is:

$15 + $10 = $25

Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up an equation:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

Substituting the values we found above:

Profit = $10 - $25

Solving for the unknown variable ""Cost"":

Cost = Profit + Total Revenue

Substituting the values again:

Cost = $25 + $10

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:

Cost = $35

So, the answer to the question is:

They spent $35 on lemons."
"Response:  We know that there were 80 Japanese runners in total and they are all boys. So, if we subtract the number of Japanese runners from the total number of runners (240), we get the number of Chinese runners:

240 - 80 = 160

We also know that 60 of these Chinese runners are boys. Therefore, the number of girls among the Chinese runners is:

160 - 60 = 100

So, there were 100 girls in the Chinese team."
"Response:  We know that Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary for rent (1/4 x 6000 = 1500), 1/3 for gasoline (1/3 x 6000 = 2000), and gives half of what remains to charity (half x 3500 = 1750). So, how much does he have left?  

1500 + 2000 - 1750 = 850

Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will have $850 remaining."
Response:  We know that Monique has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs and Rani has 10 more than Monique, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs. Therefore, the total number of crabs is 36 + 46 = 82.
"Response:  We know that Lloyd gave 5 hours of classes during the first week and 8 hours during the second week. So we can calculate his earnings for each week separately. For the first week, he worked for 5 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned:  
5 hours x $10/hour = $50  
For the second week, he worked for 8 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned:  
8 hours x $10/hour = $80  
Now let's add up his earnings for both weeks:  
$50 + $80 = $130  
Therefore, Lloyd has earned $130 for the two first weeks."
"Response:  We know that the winner received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in total. So we can start by finding out how many votes the winner received.  
We know that 3/4 is equal to 60% (since 3/4 = 60/100), so the winner received 60% of the total number of votes cast, which is:  
60% x 80 = 48 votes  
So the winner received 48 votes. Now let's find out how many votes the loser received. To do this, we subtract the number of votes received by the winner from the total number of votes cast:  
Total votes - Winner's votes = Loser's votes  
80 - 48 = 32  
Therefore, the loser received 32 votes."
"Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white carnations and five times as many calla lilies as white carnations. So if she ordered x white carnations, she ordered 4x x red roses and 5x x calla lilies. Since she only received half of her order (since it was an incomplete delivery), we can set up the following equation based on what she did receive:  

Let's start with the number of white carnations she received: 

x = 50 (half of 100) 

Now let's calculate how many red roses and calla lilies she should have received based on this number: 

Number of red roses: 

4x = 4(50) = 200 

Number of calla lilies: 

5x = 5(50) = 250 

Since Sandra only received 200 red roses and no calla lilies, we subtract the amount she received from the total amount she should have received to find out how many more she needs: 

Red roses needed: 

200 - 200 = 0 

No more red roses are needed. 

Calla lilies needed: 

250 - 0 = 250 

Sandra needs 250 calla lilies before 17 hours to keep her as a customer."
Response:  We know that two years ago, Marc was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So we can start with the fact that half of Jan's age is 28 (since Jan is 30). Now we need to find out how old Marc was two years ago. Two years ago, Marc was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so he was 28 + 5 = 33 years old. Since Jean is two years older than Marc, Jean is also 33 years old.
"Response:  The first team has four members who each run 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So their total time for the race is:

55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

Now let's look at the second team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds to complete his 400 meters. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one, so we can write down their times as follows:

60, 57, 54, 51 (since 57 - 60 = 3)

The total time for the second team is therefore:

60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 218 seconds

Since the first team finished in 220 seconds and the second team finished in 218 seconds, the difference between their finishing times is:

220 - 218 = 2 seconds

Therefore, the first team will win by 2 seconds."
"Response:  If Jerry gets an odd number on the first roll, then he will definitely get a pair of numbers on his second roll since all the numbers are even. So, we need to find out what is the probability that Jerry gets an odd number on the first roll.

Probability of getting an odd number on the first roll = 1/6 = 0.17

Now, if Jerry gets an odd number on the first roll, the probability of getting a pair on the second roll is 1/2 = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of getting a pair two times in a row is:

Probability of getting a pair two times in a row = 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25

So, the probability of getting a number superior to 3 rather than a pair two times in a row is:

Probability of getting a number superior to 3 = 1 - Probability of getting a pair two times in a row
= 1 - 0.25
= 0.75 or 75%

Therefore, the probability that Jerry obtains a number superior to 3 rather than a pair two times in a row is 75%."
Response:  If Jenna has picked twice less than her mother, then she has picked half of what her mother has picked. So if her mother has picked 20 apples, Jenna has picked 10 apples. In total, they have picked 30 apples (20 + 10).
Response:  We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters and each one receives 5 pieces of hay. So, in total, 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of hay are distributed to the hamsters. Now, we need to find out how many pieces of hay are left for the rats. Since there are 3 groups of rats with equal size (i.e., 3 x 6 = 18 pieces of hay per group), and since we have already distributed 50 pieces of hay to the hamsters, then we can conclude that there are 50 - 18 = 32 pieces of hay left for the rats. Therefore, each rat receives 32 / 3 = 10 pieces of hay.
"Response:  We know that Mandy owes Benedict $100 and they agreed to an annual interest rate of 2%. To find out how much Mandy needs to pay at the end of 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after 3 months. First, let's calculate the monthly interest:  
Monthly Interest = Principal x Rate x Time  
= $100 x 2% x 3/12  
= $6  
Now, let's add the monthly interest to the principal to get the total amount due at the end of 3 months:  
Total Amount Due = Principal + Monthly Interest  
= $100 + $6  
= $106  
So, Mandy needs to pay Benedict $106 at the end of 3 months to settle her debt."
"Response:  We know that the merchant sold all the sacks at a price of $30 per sack and had a total profit of $400. So we can write an equation based on this information:  

Total Profit = Number of Sacks x Price Per Sack

We also know that the cost of transporting one sack is $2. So we can add another equation to our system:  

Transportation Cost = Number of Sacks x Transportation Cost Per Sack

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (number of sacks and price per sack). Can you use these equations to find out how many sacks the merchant sold?"
Response:  We know that they spent $20.25 for three tickets to the fair and $4.50 less on food than they did for the tickets. So, if we subtract $4.50 from $20.25, we get $15.75. Then, we know that each person paid $15.75 / 3 = $5.25 for the tickets and food. However, they also went on two rides at $33 per ride, so they paid an additional $33 x 2 = $66. Therefore, in total, each person paid $5.25 + $66 = $71.25.
"Response:  We know that Jean has been picking peaches for 3 hours (3 x 60 = 180 minutes). And we also know that he collects 2 peaches per minute. So if we multiply 180 minutes by 2 peaches/minute, we get:  
180 min x 2 peaches/min = 360 peaches  
Therefore, Jean collected 360 peaches during his 3-hour peach-picking session."
"Response:  We know that each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week. That means they need to eat approximately 0.5 pounds (or 226 grams) of insects per day. Since there are ten ducks in the flock, we multiply this amount by ten to get our daily total: 10 x 226 grams = 2,260 grams or 2.26 kilograms. So, to feed a flock of ten ducks, you would need about 2.26 kilograms of insects per day."""
"Response:  We know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees each year. So after one year, he has planted 10 new trees and cut down 2 old trees, leaving him with 98 trees (50 + 10 - 2). Now we need to calculate how many trees are left after 10 years.  

Since 30% of the trees die, we can assume that 30% of 98 trees will die, which is 29.4 (98 x 0.3). So, after 10 years, Tom has 98 - 29 = 69 trees left."
Response:  On Friday morning, there were 18 pink flamingos in Sue's garden. On Saturday morning, one-third of the pink flamingos (6) were painted white and replaced back into Sue's garden. So, after Saturday morning, there were 18 + 6 = 24 flamingos in total in Sue's garden. On Sunday morning, 18 new pink flamingos were added to the garden. Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 + 18 = 42 flamingos in Sue's garden.
"Response:  If she needs 5 colors and each crayon costs $2, then she will need to spend $10 (5 x $2). Since she has planned to spend $20, she will have $10 left over after buying the crayons ($20 - $10 = $10). So, she will have $10 in her wallet after purchasing the crayons."""
"Response:  We know that one stylo costs as much as one crayon and one gum together. So if we multiply the cost of one crayon (1.20) by two (since we need two items to make one stylo), we get:

1.20 x 2 = 2.40

Now, let's add the cost of one gum to this amount:

2.40 + 0.30 = 2.70

Therefore, eight styloes will cost:

2.70 x 8 = 21.60"
"Response:  If we have to distribute 200 pounds of carrots among 40 restaurants and each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots, then we can calculate how many pounds of carrots will not be used as follows:  

200 pounds / 40 restaurants = 5 pounds per restaurant (remainder)  
5 pounds x 40 restaurants = 200 pounds (total amount)  
Therefore, 200 - 200 = 0 pounds of carrots will not be used. All 200 pounds will be distributed among the 40 restaurants."
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23,786 inhabitants in the city of Soda and we have been given two pieces of information about them: 

* There are 8,417 men (i.e., adult males).
* There are 9,092 women (i.e., adult females).

So, if we subtract the number of men from the total population, we get:

23,786 - 8,417 =...?

Now, let's add the number of women to this result:

... + 9,092 =...?

Finally, we can find out how many children there are by subtracting the sum of the number of men and women from the total population:

... - (8,417 + 9,092) =...?

Can you do these calculations and give me the final answer?"
Response:  We know that Elaine had 20 cards at first and collected three times more in one month. So she has 3 x 20 = 60 cards after the first month. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer than the previous month, so she has 60 - 20 = 40 cards now. Finally, in the third month, she collected two times the number of cards collected in the first two months, which is 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 cards. Therefore, Elaine currently has 40 + 200 = 240 cards.
Response:  We know that Marc edits 1,000 phrases per week for two editors, A and B. The editor A pays him $5 per phrase, so he earns $5 x 500 = $2,500 from Editor A. Since the editor B pays twice as much as Editor A, he pays $5 x 500 = $2,500 x 2 = $5,000 to Marc. Therefore, in one week, Marc earns a total of $2,500 + $5,000 = $7,500. So his weekly income is $7,500.
"Response:  We know that Baldur draws water from a well and fills 5 buckets in the morning and 6 buckets in the afternoon. Each bucket contains 5 liters of water. So we can calculate how much water he collects each day as follows:  
Morning: 5 buckets x 5 liters/bucket = 25 liters  
Afternoon: 6 buckets x 5 liters/bucket = 30 liters  
Total daily collection: 25 + 30 = 55 liters per day"
"Response:  First, we know that Jean received a prize of $5,000 as a one-time payment. Second, he also received an increase in salary of 5%. So, if he earned $2,000 per week before receiving the prize, his new weekly earnings would be:

$2,000 x (1 + 0.05) = $2,000 x 1.05 = $2,100

Now, let's calculate how much Jean has earned for the entire year:

$2,100 x 52 weeks = $106,200

So, Jean has earned $106,200 in one year, including the $5,000 prize and the 5% salary increase."
"Response:  We know that Josie produces 5 tons of grapes per acre and each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine. So if we multiply 5 tons/acre x 10 acres = 50 tons of grapes produced per year. Then we can calculate how many barrels of wine are produced as follows:  
50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Response:  We know that Carl has eaten 7 sandwiches per week (since he eats one every day), and each sandwich contains 2 slices of cheese. Therefore, he has consumed 14 slices of cheese through his sandwiches alone.

Next, we are told that he has made 3 omelets per week for breakfast, with an additional slice of cheese in each omelet compared to his sandwiches. This means he has used 3 x 2 = 6 more slices of cheese for his omelets.

Finally, we learn that he prepared a large macaroni dish using 8 slices of cheese. So, in total, Carl has consumed or used:

14 + 6 + 8 = 28 slices of cheese."
Response:  First, we know that Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens for a total of 32 pens. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens, each containing 9 pens, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 new blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, each containing 6 pens, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 new red pens. In total, Janet now has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.
"Response:  We know that Brinley has already taken five tests and has obtained scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To calculate her average score for the first five tests, we can add up all these scores and divide by 5:

(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = (458) / 5 = 91.6

Since Brinley is allowed to drop one score, she will not include her lowest score of 71 in her calculation. Therefore, her adjusted average score for the first five tests would be:

(89 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 4 = (367) / 4 = 91.75

Now, let's find out what score Brinley needs to obtain in the sixth test to have an overall average of 93. To do this, we subtract her current average score from 93:

93 - 91.75 = 1.25

So, Brinley needs to get at least 1.25 points more than her previous best score to achieve an overall average of 93. Since her highest score so far is 100, she should aim to beat that score by at least 1.25 points. In other words, she needs to get at least 101.25 points in the sixth test to achieve an overall average of 93."
Response:  We know that Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, so he rode his bike 5 x 4 = 20 times in total. Each time, he rode 25 kilometers, so he traveled a total distance of 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers during those 4 weeks. After that, he reduced to riding only twice a week and increased the distance per ride to 60 kilometers, so he rode 2 x 3 = 6 times during the next 3 weeks. In total, he rode 6 + 500 = 506 kilometers during the entire period.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 bars of chocolate and each bar weighs twice as much as one piece of candy corn. So if one bar weighs 40 grams, how many grams do all 25 bars weigh?  
To find out, we can multiply the weight of one bar by 25:
40g x 25 = 1000g
So, the total weight of Joe's Halloween candy bag is 1000 grams or 1 kilogram!"
"Response:  On Monday (Lundi), Rose bought 4 gâteaux. So she bought 4 x 1 = 4 gâteaux. 
On Tuesday (Mardi), she bought three times more than on Monday, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 gâteaux. 
On Wednesday (Mercredi), she bought five times more than on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 gâteaux. 
In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 gâteaux during these three days."
"Response:  We know that vingt douzaines of cups costed $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6,000 each. So we can start by calculating the cost of half a dozen plates:

$6,000 / 6 = $1,000 per plate

Now, let's calculate the cost of vingt douzaines of cups:

$1,200 / 24 (since there are 24 cups in a douzaine) = $50 per cup

So, the price of one cup is $50."
Response:  First, we know that Sara has to earn enough money to buy the vest and two pairs of shoes. The total cost is 30 + 2 x 20 = 70$. She already had 10$ in savings before starting babysitting, so she needs to earn an additional 60$. Since each time she takes care of her neighbor's kids, she earns 5$, she will have to do it 12 times (60/5). Therefore, Sara must tend the lawn 12 times to be able to afford the new outfit.
"Response:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and has twice as many white chickens as red ones. So if he has x red chickens, he must have 2x white chickens. Since each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, there are 2x \* 5 = 10 eggs from white chickens. Therefore, the total number of eggs Jerry collects is 42 + 10 = 52 eggs per day. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of red chickens:

x + 2x = 52 (total eggs collected)

Simplify the equation:

3x + 2 = 52

Subtract 2 from both sides:

3x = 50

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So Jerry has 16 red chickens."
"Response:  We know that Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour and we want to find out how many hours it takes him to walk around the park. The park is rectangular in shape with dimensions of 1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles total. So, if we divide the distance of the park by Gary's walking speed, we get:  
9 miles / 3 miles/hour = 3 hours To summarize, Gary spends 3 hours walking around the park."
Response:  On the first day, Sloane had 100 clients. On the second day, she had 50 more than the previous day, so she had 100 + 50 = 150 clients. Now, let's find out how many clients she had on the third day. She had 500 - 150 = 350 clients on the third day.
"Response:  We know that the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago. So if the large pool had x gallons of water, the small pool would have had x/2 gallons of water.
Now we are told that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, after four minutes, the large pool will have lost 4x gallons of water and the small pool will have lost 4(x/2) = 2x gallons of water.
Since the large pool started with twice as much water as the small pool, the small pool now has half as much water as the large pool. So the quantity of water in the small pool is (1/2)x gallons."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Lori needs in total for her purchases:  
$320 (shoes) + $32 (belt) = $352.  
Next, let's divide the amount she needs by her hourly wage:  
$352 / $8/hour = 44 hours.  
Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours before she can afford her purchases."
"Response:  We know that Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount. So, she will have to pay back $2,000 + (10% of $2,000) = $2,000 + $200 = $2,200 in total. 
Now, we are told that she has to pay $165 per month for 12 months. Therefore, the total number of payments she will make is 12 x $165 = $1,980. 
So, after making all these payments, how much money will be left with Janeth? Answer: $2,200 - $1,980 = $220."
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more than the number of roses. So if we add 7 to 4, we get: 4 + 7 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 flowers in the vase in total.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and that Harriet has half of Zack's age. So we can start with these two pieces of information to find out how old each person is now.
Harriet is currently 21 years old, so let's say she was born in 1998 (21 x 3 = 63).
Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so he was born in 1994 (2 x 21 = 42).
Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so he was born in 1970 (3 x 63 = 189).
Now we need to calculate their ages in three years. To do this, we add three years to each person's current age.
For Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
For Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
For Adrian: 189 + 3 = 192
So, in three years, Harriet will be 24 years old, Zack will be 45 years old, and Adrian will be 192 years old."
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score. So, Yuri scored (1/2) x 68 = 34 points. Now we need to find out how many points Brianna scored. We know that she scored 17 more than Naomi, so her score is 17 + 68 = 85 points. Finally, we can calculate Jojo's score as follows: Total score = Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score = 68 + 34 + 85 = 287 points. Therefore, Jojo scored 287 - 68 = 219 points.
"Response:  We know that Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to complete one Sudoku grid. During the weekend, she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku grids. So we can calculate how much time she spent playing these games as follows:

Time spent on crossword puzzles = 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes
Time spent on Sudoku grids = 8 x 5 minutes = 40 minutes
Total time spent playing both games = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes
Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing word games and Sudoku during the weekend."
"Response:  First, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the reservoir to irrigate her garden. So how much is left in the tank?  
We can calculate this as follows:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Amount used
= 120 L - 90 L
= 30 L

Now, we are told that Celine was able to collect twice as much rainwater as what remained in the tank. Therefore, the total amount of water collected is:

Total amount = Remaining amount x 2
= 30 L x 2
= 60 L

So there are now 60 liters of water remaining in the reservoir after Celine has finished using it and collecting rainwater."
Response:  We know that Andy plants fewer petunias than geraniums. So if he has x geraniums, he must have less than x petunias. Specifically, since there are 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can say that Andy has 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. Therefore, in total, Andy plants 50 + 90 = 140 flowers.
"Response:  We know that the company spent $15,000 in advertising during the first year and one-third of this amount during the second year. To find out how much they spent in total over both years, we need to add up these two amounts.

First Year: $15,000
Second Year: One-third of $15,000 = $5,000 (since they spent one-third of the previous year's amount)
Total Advertising Expenses Over Both Years: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000"
"Response:  We know that Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour and Benji rents a banana boat for $18 per hour. If Carlos uses his canoe for 3 hours and Benji uses his banana boat for 5 hours, we need to calculate how much they will pay in total.

Carlos: 3 hours x $30/hour = $90
Benji: 5 hours x $18/hour = $90
Total: $90 + $90 = $180
Therefore, the total amount of their rentals is $180."
"Response:  We know that André needs 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half of that time (3 days) to return by car. So he will need a total of 9 days for both trips.  
Numeric Answer: 9 days."
"Response:  We know that James had 40 cards of water before he lost any and bought new ones. After losing 8 cards of water, he is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cards of water. Now, if we buy 14 new cards of grass, we add them to our existing 32 cards of water, giving us a total of 32 + 14 = 46 cards. So, the percentage of water cards in James' deck after buying new cards is:

(number of water cards / total number of cards) x 100%
= (32 / 46) x 100%
= 70%

So, there is a 70% chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a card chosen at random from James' deck will be of the water type."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much he paid for his meal without any discounts or promotions. Then we can subtract the amount of his coupon and finally tell him how much he has left to pay. Here is the calculation:  
Base price of burrito = 6.50$ + (2$ x meat) + (1$ x cheese) + (1$ x avocado) + (2$ x sauce) = 6.50$ + 2$ + 1$ + 1$ + 2$ = 14.50$. 
He added an option premium which costs 3$ so the total cost with premium would be: 14.50$ + 3$ = 17.50$. Now let's apply the coupon. He has a coupon worth 5$ so he will deduct that from the total cost: 17.50$ - 5$ = 12.50$. Therefore, he has 12.50$ left to pay."
"Response:  We know that Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place 2 pieces per minute. So if we want to find out how many hours it will take them to finish the puzzle, we need to calculate how long it would take each of them individually and then add those times together.  
First, let's calculate how long it would take Kalinda to finish the puzzle. She can place 4 pieces per minute, so she can complete 360 pieces in:
360 / 4 = 90 minutes
Now, let's calculate how long it would take her mother to finish the puzzle. She can place 2 pieces per minute, so she can complete 360 pieces in:
360 / 2 = 180 minutes
Now, let's add these two times together to get the total time it will take both of them to finish the puzzle:
90 + 180 = 270 minutes
Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mother a total of 270 minutes (or 4.5 hours) to finish this 360-piece puzzle."
"Response:  We know that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested after two months, so we can calculate how many watermelons were not yet ready for harvesting at that time.  

If 30% of the watermelons were ready, then 70% were not yet ready (since 30 + 70 = 100%).  

Now, let's consider the number of watermelons that were not yet ready for harvesting after two weeks. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvesting, we can calculate the number of watermelons that were still not ready for harvesting.  

Let x represent the total number of watermelons that were not yet ready for harvesting after two months. Then, since 30% were ready, we have:  

x = 120 \* (1 - 0.3) = 120 \* 0.7 = 84  

So there were 84 watermelons that were not yet ready for harvesting after two months. Now, if 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvesting, we can calculate the number of watermelons that were still not ready for harvesting after two weeks as follows:  

(84 / 4) \* (1 - 0.75) = (84 / 4) \* 0.25 = 21  

Therefore, there were 21 watermelons that were not yet ready for harvesting after two weeks."
"Response:  First we calculate the total cost of all cars before taxes and registration fees:  
12 x 20,000 = 240,000 $  
Now let's add the tax rate (10%) to this amount:  
240,000 x 0.10 = 24,000 $  
So the total cost of all cars including taxes is:  
240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 $  
Finally, let's add the registration fee for each car (1,000 $):  
264,000 x 12 = 3,168,000 $  
Therefore, Marc will spend in total: 3,168,000 $"
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so if Robert collected 20 shells, then Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday. On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, which means she collected 2 x 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday. Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that there were twice as many fourmis as insects in the garden. If there were 50 fourmis, then there were 50 x 2 = 100 insects in the garden.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 pingouins in total. If one-third of them go to the ocean and another third goes inside the cave for dinner, then we can subtract those numbers from the total number of pingouins.  
One-third of 36 is 12 (since 12 x 3 = 36). So, 12 pingouins go to the ocean.  
Another third of 36 is also 12 (since 12 x 3 = 36). So, 12 pingouins go inside the cave for dinner.  
Now, let's add up how many pingouins are left: 36 - 12 - 12 = 12.  
Therefore, 12 pingouins continue to take the sunbathe."
"Response:  If Steve eats 2 times more than his girlfriend and she eats 6 tomatoes per day, then Steve eats 12 tomatoes per day (2 x 6 = 12). Since he wants to eat more tomatoes now, let's say he wants to increase his daily intake by 50%. So, if he currently eats 12 tomatoes per day, he will want to eat 18 tomatoes per day (12 + 50% of 12 = 18). Now we need to calculate how many vines he needs to produce that amount of tomatoes. We know that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so we can calculate how many vines he needs as follows: 

18 tomatoes/day x 7 days/week = 126 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes/week, Steve would need:

126 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 42 vines

Therefore, Steve would need 42 vines to satisfy his increased demand for tomatoes."
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend should have 4 parts of pizza. If we divide 20 by 4, we get 5 (since 20 divided by 4 is equal to 5). So, Jean needs to order 5 pizzas if they come in 8 parts each.
"Response:  If Ram uses five empty pens to make one full pen, then he needs five empty pens for every full pen he makes. So if he has 25 empty pens and wants to make 10 full pens, how many empty pens will be left over?  
Therefore, the number of full pens Ram can obtain is limited by the number of empty pens he has. In this case, he can get 25 full pens (since there are only 25 empty pens)."
"Response:  First, we know that Johnny had $20 + 10 = 30 dollars to invest. We also know that his investment tripled in one year, so if he had x dollars after one year, he would have had 3x dollars before. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x = 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = 10

So, Johnny had $10 after one year."
"Response:  We know that Marie is two years younger than Jeanne and five years older than Jessa. So we can start with the age of Jeanne:
Jeanne = 20 + 5 = 25 years old
Now, let's find out how old Marie is:
Marie = Jeanne - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 years old
And finally, let's calculate the age of Jessa:
Jessa = Jeanne + 5 = 25 + 5 = 30 years old
So the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
25 + 23 + 30 = 78 years old"
"Response:  We know that there are 1,000 students in total and we have three exits (A, B, and C). If 30% of the students leave through exit A, then 300 students will leave through this exit (since 30% of 1,000 is 300).  
If 3/5 of the remaining students leave through exit B, then 2/5 of the remaining students will leave through exit B (since 3/5 of 700 is 210, and 2/5 of 700 is 140).  
So, in total, 300 + 210 = 510 students will leave through exits A and B.  
This means that 1,000 - 510 = 490 students will leave through exit C."
"Response:  We know that Jacques has 6 more candies than Robert. So if Robert has x candies, Jacques will have x + 6 candies. Now we are told that Jean has two times as many candies as Robert. Therefore, Jean has 2x candies. Since Jean has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:  

2x = 54 

Solving for x, we get: 

2x = 54 

x = 27 

Now we can find out how many more candies Jean has than Jacques by subtracting the number of candies Jacques has from the number of candies Jean has: 

Jean - Jacques = 27 - (27 + 6) = 27 - 33 = 4 

Therefore, Jean has 4 more candies than Jacques."
"Response: 
Dolly has two books and reads one book from each of her friends (Pandora and herself). So she will have read a total of two + one = three books.
Now let's look at what happens to Pandora. She only has one book, but since Dolly reads one of her books, Pandora is left with no books. Therefore, Pandora will have read zero books.
So in total, Dolly and Pandora together will have read three + zero = three books."
Response:  We know that Mike writes to each person for 5 pages every week, so he spends 5 x 3 = 15 pages per week writing letters. Since he can write one page in 6 minutes, it takes him 15 pages / 6 minutes per page = 2.5 hours to write all his letters for the week. Therefore, Mike spends 2.5 hours per week writing letters.
"Response:  We know that Jason has a monthly phone plan with 1,000 minutes and he spends 15 minutes per day talking to his boss (30 days x 15 minutes/day = 450 minutes). He also made 300 additional calls (300 minutes) this month. Therefore, the total number of minutes used by Jason this month is:  
450 + 300 = 750 minutes. 
So, there are 250 minutes remaining in Jason's phone plan for the month (1,000 - 750 = 250)."
"Response:  We know that Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left. Then, Ginger gave some of her fries to Griffin, but we don't know how many. Let's say she gave x fries to him. So, Griffin now has 19 + x fries. Next, Colby took 3 fries from Griffin, so he has 19 + x - 3 fries. Since Colby took the same number of fries as Kyle, and there are 3 less than what Kyle took, we can set up an equation:

19 + x - 3 = 24 (since Kyle took 5 fries)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So, Ginger gave 8 fries to Griffin."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 escargots in one aquarium and 32 escargots in another. The difference between the two quantities is equal to twice the sum of the fish in both aquariums. So we can write an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of fish in Aquarium 1 (the one with 4 escargots)
and y be the number of fish in Aquarium 2 (the one with 32 escargots).

We know that the difference between the two quantities is equal to twice the sum of the fish:

(32 - 4) = 2(x + y)

Simplifying the equation:

28 = 2(x + y)

Now we can solve for x and y:

x + y = 14

x = 7
y = 7

So there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  We know that the makeup artist charges $250 per hour and Jeanne needs to be made up for 6 hours per day, 4 days per week, for 5 weeks. That means she will have to pay:

$250 x 6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = $80,000

But then we are told that the makeup artist gives Jeanne a 10% discount, so we can subtract:

$80,000 - (10% of $80,000) = $80,000 - $8,000 = $72,000

So Jeanne has paid $72,000 for her makeup services over the course of the 5-week film shoot."
Response:  We know that Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98 on her sister's birthday party. She shared the cost with her two parents, so they paid $98 / 3 = $32 each.
"Response:  We know that each bag of onions costs $1.50 per pound, so if we want to find out how much the chef spent in total, we need to multiply the number of pounds of onions he bought by the cost per pound. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound and since each bag contains 50 pounds, we can calculate as follows:  
Total amount spent = (50 x 16) x $1.50/16 = $50 x 256 = $1280 
Therefore, the chef has spent $1280 on onions."
Response:  We know that Sue has eaten four times more than her sister on Monday and two times more on Tuesday. So if her sister ate x biscuits on Monday, Sue ate 4x biscuits. On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 - 5 = 8 biscuits, so Sue ate 2(8) = 16 biscuits. In total, Sue consumed 4x + 16 = 20 x 200 = 4000 calories more than her sister.
