"Response: 
Els ànecs de Janet posen 16 ous al dia. So they lay 16 eggs per day.
Cada matí menja tres per esmorzar i cuina muffins per als seus amics cada dia amb quatre. So she eats three for breakfast and bakes four muffins for her friends every day.
Ella ven el que queda al mercat de grangers diàriament per 2 dòlars per ous de pato frescos. She sells what remains at the farmers market daily for $2 per fresh duck eggs.
Now we need to calculate how much money Janet makes from selling eggs at the farmers market each day. We know that she lays 16 eggs per day and sells them for $2 per egg, so she makes:
$2 x 16 = $32 per day in profit from selling eggs at the farmers market.
Therefore, Janet makes $32 per day in profit from selling eggs at the farmers market."
Response:  We know that one tunics requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half white fiber. So we need to find out how many threads are in each bolt. If we assume that there are 100 threads in each bolt (which is just an estimate), then...
"Response:  The original price of the house is $80,000 and after he made repairs worth $50,000, the value of the house increased by 150%, which means that the new value of the house is:
$80,000 x 150% = $120,000
So, the benefit Josh got from buying and repairing the house is:
$120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000"
Response:  If James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week and each sprint is 60 meters long... So in total he will run 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week. Therefore, he will cover a distance of 9 x 60 = 540 meters per week.
Response:  We know that every day, Wendy feeds each of her chickens with three bowls of mixed food, which contains seeds, worms, and vegetables to help keep them healthy. She gives the chickens their food in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 more bowls of food. How many bowls of food does Wendy need to give her chickens in the last meal of the day if the size of Wendy's flock is 20 chickens?  Solution: To find out how many bowls of food Wendy needs for the last meal of the day, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Wendy feeds her chickens three times a day, so she will need to feed them 3 x 20 = 60 bowls of food altogether. Since she already gave them 15 + 25 = 40 bowls of food earlier in the day, that means she still needs 60 - 40 = 20 bowls of food for the last meal of the day. Therefore, Wendy needs 20 bowls of food for the last meal of the day if the size of her flock is 20 chickens.
"Response:  If each glass costs $5 and every second glass costs $3, then...

Step 1: Calculate the cost of one glass: $5
Step 2: Calculate the cost of two glasses: ($5 x 2) = $10
Step 3: Calculate the cost of four glasses: ($10 x 4) = $40
Step 4: Calculate the total cost of 16 glasses: ($40 x 16) = $640
Therefore, Kylar will have to pay $640 for 16 glasses."
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x = 48 ovelles. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x = 80 ovelles. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is: Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 48 + 80 + 20 = 148 ovelles.
"Response:  The file is 200 GB in size and it takes 2 GB/minute to download. So, the time taken to download the entire file is:

Time = Size / Rate
= 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
= 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes)
Now, when Windows forces a restart during the download process, the download resumes from the beginning. Therefore, we need to add the time spent on the restart to the total download time:

New Time = Old Time + Time Spent on Restart
= 100 minutes + 20 minutes (the time spent on restart)
= 120 minutes (or 2 hours and 6 minutes)
So, the car needs 120 minutes or 2 hours and 6 minutes to download the 200 GB file after a forced restart."
"Response:  We know that John spent 3 hours driving at a speed of 100 km/h and then he realized something important and turned back. He tried to reach home in 4 hours but only managed to cover the first 2 hours during which he was stuck in traffic. After that, he drove for another half hour at a speed of 30 mph, and finally, he had 2 hours left to drive at a speed of 80 mph. So, let's calculate the distance traveled during each hour:

* During the first 3 hours, he drove at a speed of 100 km/h, so he covered a distance of 100 km/h x 3 hours = 300 km.
* During the last 2 hours, he drove at a speed of 80 km/h, so he covered a distance of 80 km/h x 2 hours = 160 km.
* During the half hour when he drove at a speed of 30 mph, he covered a distance of 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 km.

So, in total, John traveled a distance of 300 + 160 + 15 = 475 km from his starting point to his destination. Therefore, he is still 475 km away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
Response:  If Eliza works for $10/hour and she worked 45 hours this week, then her total earnings are: Total earnings = Number of hours worked x Hourly wage = 45 hours x $10/hour = $450. So, Eliza earned $450 this week.
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads. If in the second month, there were three times more downloads than in the first month, then in the second month, there would be 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. However, after that, there was a 30% decrease, so in the third month, there would be 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads during the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.
Response:  Toula bought 3 dozen rosquets that cost her 68$/dotzena = 204$. She also bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at 80$/dotzena = 160$. Finally, she bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for 55$/dotzena = 330$. Therefore, in total, Toula spent 204 + 160 + 330 = 694$.
Response:  The first year, there will be no income from the lemon tree because it is just being planted and has not yet started producing lemons. In the second year, Carlos will have to spend $3 for maintenance (regardless of whether he sells any lemons or not). If he sells all 7 lemons at $1.5 each, he will make $10.5 in total ($1.5 x 7 = $10.5). So, after two years, Carlos will have made a total of $10.5 + $3 = $13.5. Therefore, it will take approximately 2 years and 4 months for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree.
Response:  If Melanie sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at Green House, 2 more at Red House, and half of what remained at Yellow House, then she started with 3 x (1/3 + 2) = 7 vacuum cleaners. So, Melanie has 5 - 7 = -2 vacuum cleaners left.
Response:  We know that in total, 20 students are taking ballroom dance classes. Of those, 4 students (or 20%) have signed up for contemporary dance, and of the remaining 16 students, 4 (or 25%) have signed up for jazz dance. This means that a total of 8 students (or 40%) have signed up for either contemporary or jazz dance. Therefore, the percentage of students who have signed up for hip-hop dance is (100 - 40) / 20 = 30%. So, 30% of all students in the class have signed up for hip-hop dance.
Response:  The value of the jewelry market is expected to increase by 2.5%, and the value of the electronics market is expected to increase by 1.2%. If the merchant buys $5,000 worth of jewelry, they will gain $125 from the appreciation of the jewelry market (2.5% x $5,000). However, if they buy $8,000 worth of electronics, they will gain $96 from the appreciation of the electronics market (1.2% x $8,000). Therefore, the maximum profit for the merchant would be $96 ($8,000 x 1.2%).
"Response:  On day one, both trains travel west for 130 kilometers. So, train A covers a distance of 130 km. Train B covers a distance of 0 km because it starts its journey at the same time as train A and they are going in the same direction. Therefore, the total distance covered by train A is 130 km.
On day two, both trains travel north for 240 kilometers. So, train A covers a distance of 240 km, and train B covers a distance of 240 km. Therefore, the total distance covered by train A is 370 km (240 + 130), and the total distance covered by train B is also 370 km (240 + 130)."
Response:  As a teacher, she earns $20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week. As an athletic coach, she earns $30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week. So her total weekly income is $700 + $450 = $1,150/week. Now let's calculate her annual income: $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year.
"Response:  If she makes an omelette of three eggs every morning for breakfast, and there are 4 weeks in a month, then...

1 week = 7 days (assuming a 7-day week)
3 eggs/omelette x 7 days/week x 4 weeks/month = 84 eggs/month
Therefore, La Claire will eat 84 eggs in 4 months."
Response:  If she walked for one hour to cover the first four miles, then her speed during that time was $4 \div 60 = 0.67$ milles per hour. Since she wants her average speed to be $4$ milles per hour, we need to find out how long it will take her to cover the remaining distance at this new speed. We can do this by dividing the remaining distance ($8$ milles) by her new desired speed: $$ \text{Time} = \frac {8}{0.67} = 12 \text{ hours} $$ Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a velocity of $\boxed{12}$ milles per hour to complete the remaining distance in $12$ hours.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that is two thirds water and we want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three fifths water. But while mixing, one liter of orange juice spills out. How much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?

Step 1: Orange Juice (10 liters) = 2/3 \* 10 = 7.67 liters (water) + 2.33 liters (orange juice)
Step 2: Pineapple Juice (15 liters) = 3/5 \* 15 = 9 liters (water) + 6 liters (pineapple juice)
Step 3: Total Volume = Orange Juice + Pineapple Juice = 7.67 liters + 9 liters = 16.67 liters
Step 4: Water Left = Total Volume - Spilled Liter = 16.67 liters - 1 liter = 15.67 liters
Therefore, there are 15.67 liters of water left in the remaining 24 liters."
"Response:  We know that Raymond is six years older than Samantha, so he was born when she was six years younger. Then we know that Raymond had a child at the age of 23, and now Samantha is 31 years old. So, if we calculate the difference between their ages, we get:
Age of Raymond's son = Age of Samantha - (6 + 6)
= 31 - (12)
= 20 years
So, Raymon's son was born 20 years ago."
Response:  We know that Billy sold at least 3 DVDs because his first three customers bought one each. Then, two more customers came and bought two DVDs each, so he sold an additional 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs. Finally, the last three customers did not buy any DVDs, so Billy sold a total of 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs on Monday.
"Response:  The length of the wick is increasing at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So after 5 hours, the length will be:

Length = 2 cm/hour x 5 hours = 10 cm

Now, we need to convert this length from cm to m. There are 100 cm in 1 m, so:

Length (m) = 10 cm / 100 cm = 0.1 m

So, after burning for 5 hours, the length of the wick will be approximately 0.1 m or 10 cm."
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book after a discount of 25%. So we can set up an equation as follows:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

We are given that the discount percentage is 25%, so let's plug it in:

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26.00

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of these items. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

$12 + $3 x 5 = $50

Now, let's solve for the number of packages of chicken:

$12 + $15 = $50

So, there were 5 packages of chicken (since each package costs $12).

Next, let's find out how many apples and oranges Marie bought:

$3 x 5 = $15

So, she bought 5 apples ($1.50 each) and 5 oranges ($1.50 each).

Finally, let's calculate the number of pizzas Marie bought:

$8.50 x 4 = $34

So, she bought 4 pizzas ($34 total)."
Response:  The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50, and Mishka bought 3 pairs. So, she spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on shorts. Similarly, the cost of one pair of pants is $22.50, and Mishka bought 3 pairs. So, she spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on pants. And finally, the cost of one pair of shoes is $42, and Mishka bought 3 pairs. So, she spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes. Therefore, in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $233 on all the pieces of clothing.
"Response:  If Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every night and buys boxes of ice cream with 15 portions in each box at a price of $4.00 per box, then she will spend money as follows:
Day 1-29: No problem! She spends $4.00 x 29 = $116.00 for 29 days.
Day 30-60: Now things get interesting! Since she has been eating ice cream every day, she needs to buy another box (or two) after Day 29. So let's calculate how much she spends on Days 30-60: $4.00 x 2 = $8.00 + $4.00 x 2 = $8.00 + $4.00 x 3 = $12.00 = $20.00. Therefore, her total expenditure over 60 days is $116.00 + $20.00 = $136.00."
Response:  We know that Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike ride. The first stop was after 20 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. So, we can calculate the distance between the two stops as follows: Distance = Total distance - First stop distance = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles Therefore, Henry traveled 40 miles between his first and second stops.
"Response:  We know that Gloria is buying shoes and she finds two pairs of boots that fit her budget for shoes. However, she has to choose between these boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost $5 less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots? 
Step-by-step solution:
Let B be the cost of the boots. Since Gloria has to choose between the boots and the high heels, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:
B + (2 x H) = 50...(1)
Here, H represents the cost of the second pair of high heels. Since we want to find out how much the boots cost, we can substitute B with -H in equation (1):
-H + (2 x H) = 50...(2)
Now, we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving for H, we get:
H = $66...(3)
Since H represents the cost of one pair of high heels, we can find the cost of both pairs by multiplying H by 2:
Cost of both pairs = 2 x $66 = $132...(4)
Therefore, the cost of the boots is:
B = -H = -$66...(5)
So, the boots cost $66."
"Response:  The age difference between Darrell and Allen is 7 years. So, if their combined age is 162 years, we can calculate Allen's age as follows:

Allen's age = Darrell's age + Age difference (7)
= 7 + 7
= 14

Therefore, Allen's age is 14 years old."
"Response:  According to Gunter, there are x gelatines in the jar.
Friend 1 says there are 80 gelatines. So, friend 1's estimate is x + 80 = 80.
Friend 2 says that 20 more than half of what friend 1 said, so friend 2's estimate is (x + 80) / 2 = 40.
Friend 3 says it's 25% more than the first friend, so friend 3's estimate is (x + 80) * 1.25 = 96.
Now we have three estimates: x + 80 = 80, (x + 80) / 2 = 40, and (x + 80) * 1.25 = 96. We can solve for x using linear equations:
x + 80 = 80
(x + 80) / 2 = 40
(x + 80) * 1.25 = 96
Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:
x = 72
So, the average estimation of Gunter's friends is 72 gelatines in the jar."
Response:  If John takes care of 10 dogs and each dog needs 0.5 hours of attention per day, then in total he spends 5 hours (10 dogs x 0.5 hours/dog/day) taking care of them every day. Therefore, John spends 35 hours (5 hours/day x 7 days/week) taking care of the dogs every week.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we have x silver coins, then we have 3x gold coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins is 30. So, Gretchen has 30 gold coins.
Response:  We know that Siobhan has fewer jewels than Aaron and more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So if Raymond has 40 jewels, then Siobhan must have less than 40 - (1/2) x 40 = 30 jewels. Therefore, Siobhan has 30 jewels.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he has scored a total of 4 x 20 = 80 points in this time period. Now, in the next 20 minutes, he scores 1.25 times as many points as he did in the previous 20 minutes, which is equal to 1.25 x 80 = 100 points. Therefore, Mike has scored a total of 80 + 100 = 180 points in the entire 40 minutes.
Response:  If Terry eats 2 iogurts per day and they are currently sold for $5.00 each, then he spends $10.00 per day on iogurts. To find out how much he spends in total during 30 days, we can multiply the daily amount by 30: $10.00 x 30 = $300.00. Therefore, Terry spends $300.00 on iogurts during 30 days.
Response:  Firstly, John sold all his Lego toys and got $13 x 13 = $169 from them. Then he used this money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, which cost him $169 / 8 = $21. So now he has $169 - $21 = $148 left. Therefore, John still has 13 Lego toys.
"Response: 
Day 1: John runs for 3 hours (180 minutes).
Day 2-3: He runs half of the time he ran on Day 1 (90 minutes each day) = total distance run in 2 days = 180 + 180 = 360 kilometers.
Total distance run per week = 100 + 360 = 460 kilometers.
So, John runs at a rate of approximately 460/7 = 65 kilometers per day."
"Response:  If she can run at a speed of x miles/hour and walk at a speed of y miles/hour, then we know that her running speed is four times her walking speed (since she can run four times faster than she can walk). So if she runs for t hours, she will cover an distance of 4yt miles. Since she spends two-thirds of the time running and one-third of the time walking, the total distance she covers in six hours is:
Distance = 4t / 3
So, to find out how many kilometers she can cover in six hours, we need to convert the distance from miles to kilometers:
1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers
Therefore, the distance she covers in six hours is:
Distance = 4t / 3 x 1.60934 = 25.78 tenths of kilometers
Since she can jump at a speed of 3 miles/hour, she can cover a distance of 3t miles in six hours. Therefore, the total distance she covers in six hours including both running and jumping is:
Total distance = Distance + Jumping distance = 25.78 tenths of kilometers + 3t miles = 28.78 tenths of kilometers
So, the woman can cover approximately 28.78 tenths of kilometers in six hours."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, we know that:
L'iPhone de Brandon = 4 x iPhone de Ben
= 2 x iPhone de Suzy + 1
So, the age of Brandon's iPhone is equal to 2 times the age of Suzy's iPhone plus one year. Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is 3 years old."
"Response:  If we assume that when Polly has the sapphire stone, she can throw the spear three times farther than before, then...

1. Distance of Polly from the dragon = 400 feet (as given in the problem)
2. Distance of dragon's flames = 300 meters (as given in the problem)
3. Maximum distance Polly can throw the spear with the sapphire stone = 3 x 400 feet = 1200 feet
4. New distance of Polly from the dragon = 1200 feet - 400 feet = 800 feet
5. Now, the distance between Polly and the dragon is within her range to hit it with the spear. So, the answer is 800 feet."
Response:  If La àvia Jones made 5 apple tarts and cut each one into 8 pieces, then she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple tart in total. Since she put them on the table for the guests to serve themselves, and after they finished eating their share, there were 14 remaining pieces (not including any that may have been left uneaten by the guests). So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is equal to the number of remaining pieces, which is 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  If one serving of potato chips is 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a bag of 300g, then...
"Response:  If he sells each spoonful of wax for $2, and it takes 10 spoonfuls to make one candle, then...
Step-by-step calculation:
Benefit = Number of candles sold x Price per candle
= 20 veles x $2 per vela
= $40 in profit
So, his benefit is $40."
Response:  On Monday, she wrote 5 articles in 4 hours, so each article took her approximately 1 hour to write. On Tuesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Monday, which means she wrote 10 articles in 4 hours (since each article takes her 1 hour to write). Therefore, she spent 40 hours writing articles that week. On Wednesday, she doubled the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means she wrote 20 articles in 4 hours (again, each article taking her 1 hour to write). So, she spent an additional 80 hours writing articles that week. In total, then, Meredith spent 120 hours writing articles that week.
"Response: 
Candice had $80 in her purse before going to work at the cafe. She stopped at the store and bought a pack of Post-it notes, which contained x notes. At the cafe, she placed one note on each of the 220 cups of coffee she served, leaving her with 23 notes afterward. Therefore, the number of notes in the pack she bought is x = 23."
Response:  We know that John buys twice as many red dresses as blue ones. So he bought 2x = 2 times more red dresses than blue dresses. The price of each red dress is 1.5 times the price of each blue dress (50% more). Therefore, the price of each red dress is $1.5 \times 2 = 3$ times the price of each blue dress. Now we need to find out how much John spent on blue dresses. Since he spent $200 on all dresses, and he spent $40 per blue dress, then he spent $\boxed{200 - 80 = 120}$ dollars on blue dresses.
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a piece of thread 4 feet long to tie up the tomato plants in the garden. Since each piece of thread was 15 cm long, we can calculate how many pieces she could have made using the entire length of the thread as follows:
Number of pieces = Length of thread / Length of each piece
= 4 ft / 15 cm
= 267 pieces
Therefore, Tracy could have made 267 pieces using the entire length of the thread."
Response:  Since each floor has 8 units and 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means that 3/4 x 8 = 6 units are occupied per floor. Therefore, there are 6 - 2 (units on the top floor) = 4 units vacant in each floor. So, the number of vacant units in all floors is 4 x 15 = 60 units.
"Response:  How many oysters does Lloyd have in total if his gallinace produces 252 eggs per day and he sells them for $2 per dozen? 
Step-by-step calculation: Total number of oysters = Number of eggs produced per day x Number of days in a week Total number of oysters = 252 eggs/day x 7 days/week Total number of oysters = 1704 oysters (round up to nearest whole number) So, Lloyd makes $14 per week with the eggs ($2/dozen x 1704 oysters)."
Response:  The boat can travel at 10 miles per hour, so it will take 1 hour to cover 10 miles (10 x 1 = 10). From 1 to 4 pm, the boat traveled at this speed, so it covered 40 miles (4 x 10 = 40) during that time. After that, it slowed down and traveled back at 6 miles per hour. To find out how far it went after that, we need to subtract the distance traveled at 6 miles per hour from the total distance traveled. So, the answer is: Distance traveled after 4 pm = Total distance traveled - Distance traveled at 6 mph = 40 - 6 x 2 = 34 miles.
Response:  If Uriah has 10 kg of books (la bossa), and each comic book weighs 1 kg, then he has 10 kg / 1 kg = 10 comics. Similarly, if each toy weights 1 kg, then he has 10 kg / 1 kg = 10 toys. So, if he removes 30 comics, he will have 10 - 30 = 70% fewer comics. Since each comic book weighs 1 kg, then he will have 70% fewer comics x 1 kg/comic = 70 kg less weight in comics. Now, let's calculate how many toys he can remove to make up for the lost weight. We know that his total weight with toys is 10 kg + 10 kg = 20 kg, so he needs to remove 20 kg / 1 kg = 20 toys. Therefore, he will need to remove 20 toys from his bag to balance the weight.
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 tires of trucks and 4 tires of cars, so he earned $60 x 6 = $360 for truck tires and $40 x 4 = $160 for car tires, in total $520. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 cars but did not repair any truck tires, so he earned $40 x 12 = $480 for car tires only, in total $900. Therefore, the day with higher income was Friday ($900) than Thursday ($520).
Response:  The family Doubtfire had zero cats when they left home. Then, their mother called to tell them that their two cats had kittens. So, the family Doubtfire now has two cats and three times as many kittens (or six kittens). Additionally, Patchy had three more kittens, making it nine kittens in total for Patchy. Similarly, Trixie had twelve kittens, so there are thirteen kittens in total from both cats. Therefore, the number of cats the Doubtfire family currently has is: 2 + 6 + 13 = 21 cats!
Response:  Jean has 30 caramel candies and he eats 2 of them. So now he has 30 - 2 = 28 left. To fill two bags with sugar, he needs to have at least 2 x 2 = 4 sugars in total. Therefore, Jean can only fill 28 / 4 = 7 bags with sugar.
Response:  If Peter pays $7 for each ticket and $7 for popcorn, then he spends a total of $14 ($7 + $7) per trip to the movies. Since he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies $\boxed{6}$ times (since $42 / 14 = 6$).
Response:  The maximum weight that the bridge can hold is 5000 kg. If we divide this value by the weight of each box (which is 5 kg), we get the number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the limit: Number of boxes = Maximum weight of the bridge / Weight of one box = 5000 kg / 5 kg = 1000 boxes. Therefore, the number of ca...
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total cost of the order was $40. Then, there is an additional 25% charge for delivery which is equal to $10 (since it is 25% of $40). So, the new total cost becomes $50 ($40 + $10). Next, there is an additional $3 for delivery expenses, making the final total cost $53 ($50 + $3). Finally, there is a $4 tip added, bringing the total cost to $57 ($53 + $4). Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all charges and tips were applied is $57.
Response:  We know that each branch of the bush has 6 fruit clusters with 20 fruits in each cluster. Therefore, there are 6 x 20 = 120 fruits per branch. Since there are 6 branches, the total number of fruits is 6 x 120 = 720 fruits. However, we were also told that there are 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the bush, so the total number of fruits including these scattered ones is 720 + 67 = 787 fruits. Therefore, there are 787 malumbs (fruit bunches) in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 tangerines in total and we want to find out how many of them are good. From the information given, we can conclude that:

* 1 is bad (dolenta) = 1/25
* 20% are not mature = 5/25 (since 20% of 25 is 5)
* 2 are sour (agrides) = 2/25

So, the number of good tangerines is: 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 17
Therefore, 17 tangerines are good."
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for the materials to make the necklace. Then, she paid an additional $800 to have it made by a jeweler. Finally, she paid $100 (10%) of the total cost to insure it. Therefore, the amount she has paid in total is: $500 + $800 + $100 = $1400.
"Response:  If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and receives a yearly pension of $50,000 after retiring, then her annual pension is:

Pension = $50,000

From Year 21 to Year 30, she gets 5% of the annual pension amount, which is:

Annual Pension = $50,000 x 5% = $2,500

So, her total annual pension from Years 21 to 30 is:

Total Annual Pension = $50,000 + ($2,500 x 9 years) = $67,500

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of working for the same company is $67,500."
Response:  The amount paid for the first half of the year is $140 x 6 = $840. Then, in the second half of the year, the amount charged is $10% less than the previous amount, which means it will be $840 - ($840 / 10) = $752. So, the total amount paid for the service at the end of the year is $840 + $752 = $1592.
Response:  We know that Sophia has traveled 160 kilometers since she last filled her tank and had to use 4 gallons of gasoline to refill it. The manual says her tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline. To find out how far she can go with one full tank, we need to divide the total distance she's traveled (160 km) by the amount of gasoline left in her tank (12 gallons). So, Sophia can drive 133 kilometers (160 km / 12 gal) with one full tank of gasoline.
"Response: 
Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then decides to go to bed and read for half the time. He does this 3 times a week.
In 4 weeks, how many hours will he spend in front of the TV and reading?
To find out, we need to calculate the total number of hours spent watching TV and reading per week, and then multiply it by 4 to get the total number of hours over 4 weeks.
So, let's do the calculation:
Total hours spent watching TV per week = 2 hours/week x 3 times/week = 6 hours/week
Total hours spent reading per week = 1 hour/week x 3 times/week = 3 hours/week
Total hours spent watching TV and reading per week = 6 hours/week + 3 hours/week = 9 hours/week
Now, let's multiply the total hours by 4 to get the total number of hours over 4 weeks:
Total hours spent watching TV and reading over 4 weeks = 9 hours/week x 4 weeks = 36 hours
Therefore, Jim will spend 36 hours in front of the TV and reading over the course of 4 weeks."
Response:  Since there are four schools participating in the tournament and each school has sent one boys' team and one girls' team, then the number of teams is equal to 4 x 2 = 8 teams. Each team consists of 5 players plus 1 coach, so the total number of people who have been sent by all the schools is equal to 8 teams x 5 players + 1 coach = 40 people. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies less than diamonds. So, the total number of gemstones is 175 + (35 - 175) = 280. Additionally, we know that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is 2 x 35 = 70. Finally, we add up all the gemstones to get our total: 175 + 70 = 245. So, there were 245 gemstones in the treasure chest.
Response:  If there are 60 girls and 5 boys per teacher, then there must be 12 teachers (60/5 = 12). Therefore, there are 12 teachers at the school of Dr. Wertz.
Response:  We know that Bailey starts with some money and then receives an insurance of $5 per week for 8 weeks. At the end of those 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much did she start with? So, we can write an equation: Total amount = Starting amount + Insurance amount x Number of weeks. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total amount = $100 - ($5 x 8) = $100 - $40 = $60. Therefore, Bailey started with $60.
"Response: 
Judy gives 5 classes of dance per day from Monday to Friday and 8 classes on Saturday. So, in total she teaches 5 + 8 = 13 classes per week.
Each class has 15 students, so the number of students Judy teaches per week is 13 x 15 = 195 students.
Since each student pays $15, Judy earns $15 x 195 = $2,375 per week."
Response:  If Kelian has two recipes with 20 and double of 20 instructions respectively, then he will have to read 40 instructions in total to prepare both plates. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each piece of cheese cake for $4, then he will make $3 x 43 = $132 from the brownies and $4 x 23 = $92 from the cheesecakes, in total $224.
Response:  The total cost of the five phones is $750 (5 x $150). If there is a 2% interest rate for each phone, then the monthly payment will be calculated as follows: Monthly Payment = Total Cost / Number of Installments x Interest Rate x Time Period For this case, we have: Total Cost = $750 Number of Installments = 3 months Interest Rate = 0.02 (or 2%) Time Period = 3 months So, the monthly payment for Shiela would be: Monthly Payment = $750 / 3 x 0.02 x 3 = $68.33 Therefore, Shiela will pay $68.33 every month for 3 months to cover the cost of the five phones and the interest charges.
Response:  If Artie sells 12 pots of chrysanthemums at $2.74 each, he will make $32.08 ($12 x $2.74). If he sells 9 pots of petunias at $1.87 each, he will make $16.53 ($9 x $1.87). And if he sells 17 pots of begonias at $2.12 each, he will make $35.34 ($17 x $2.12). Therefore, Artie will have made a total of $83.95 in sales today.
Response:  If we have a castle of sand with $n$ levels, each level has an area of $\frac{1}{2}n^2$. Therefore, the total area of all levels is $\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2} i^2 = \frac{1}{2} n (n+1)$. Since there are 4 levels in this case, the area of each level is $\frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2$. So, the area of each level is $2$.
Response:  According to the problem statement, during the first 180 days, Cecilia has to give her puppy one bowl of food for dogs every day. This means she needs 180 bowls of food in total. After that period, she has to give her puppy two bowls of food for dogs every day, which means she needs an additional 360 bowls of food (2 x 180 = 360). So, in total, Cecilia will need 540 bowls of food for her puppy over the course of its first year (180 + 360 = 540).
Response:  If Sarah makes 4 times more clothes than David, then she makes 4 x 4 = 16 times more clothes than David. So if Sarah makes 400 kilograms of clothes, David makes 400 / 16 = 25 kilograms of clothes. Therefore, the difference in the amount of clothing that Raymond and David make is 25 - 0 = 25 kilograms.
"Response:  If we buy 3 flowers in a package for $2.50 each, then we will pay:
$2.50 x 3 = $7.50
If we buy 2 flowers in a package for $1 each, then we will pay:
$1 x 2 = $2
So, if we buy 18 flowers at the best price, we will save:
$7.50 - $2 = $5.50
Therefore, 18 flwers cost $5.50."
Response:  The cost of the treatment is $100 (John adopted a dog). If the groomer offers a 30% discount for being a new customer, then the cost after the discount will be: Cost = $100 x (1 - 0.3) = $70. So, the cost of the treatment is $70.
Response:  If there were initially 24 liters of water and each boy received 1/6 of it, then the number of liters that each boy received is 24 / 6 = 4 liters. So, if one boy received 6 liters of water, then there are 6 - 4 = 2 liters of water left.
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 pegatines initially and bought 21 more at the mall. So, he now has 31 adhesives in total (10 + 21 = 31). Then, he gave 9 of them to his sister, so he is left with 22 adhesives (31 - 9 = 22). Finally, he used 28 of them to decorate a card, leaving him with 4 adhesives (22 - 28 = 4). Therefore, Charlie has 4 adhesives left.
Response:  We know that Alex weighs less than Grace and their combined weight is 127 pounds (Grace's weight - Alex's weight). So, if Grace weighs 125 pounds, then Alex must weigh less than 125 - 2 = 123 pounds. Therefore, their combined weight is 125 + 123 = 248 pounds or 109 kg.
Response:  If Dan plants 3 roses, then there are 3 x 25 = 75 roses in total. Since each rose has 8 spines, there are 75 x 8 = 600 spines in total. Therefore, there are 600 spines in total.
Response:  The team has played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost. So, if they have lost x games, then they have won 22 - x games. Therefore, the number of games they have won is 22 - x.
Response:  We know that Gene has been going on vacation every year since he was 23 years old and currently he is 34 years old. So, in total, he has gone on 11 vacations (from age 23 to current age of 34). Now, we need to find out how many blocks of collar are there in each row. From the problem statement, we know that each row consists of one block from each vacation. Therefore, the number of blocks of collar in each row is equal to the number of vacations Gene has taken. In other words, there are 11 blocks of collar in each row. Since there are 4 rows in total, the total number of blocks of collar is 11 x 4 = 44 blocks of collar.
Response:  The alarm sounded three times today as a reminder. When it first went off, it sounded for four times. So, the second time it went off, it sounded for 3 + 4 = 7 times. And the third time it went off, it sounded for half of 7 = 3.5 times. Therefore, the alarm sounded a total of 3 + 7 + 3.5 = 13.5 times today.
Response:  If we assume that Sylvie has been working for the company since December of year t-4 (where t is the number of years since the policy was implemented), then her initial salary in year t-3 would be $600 \times (1 + 0.10) = 660$. In year t-2, her salary would be $660 \times (1 + 0.10) = 728$, and in year t-1, it would be $728 \times (1 + 0.10) = 802$. Therefore, after three additional years of service, Sylvie's annual salary would be $802 \times (1 + 0.10)^3 = 964$.
"Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than Harald. So if Marilyn sold x copies, Harald sold $x/10$ copies. Therefore, we can write an equation:
$$\boxed{88000 = x + \frac{x}{10}}$$
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and $\frac{x}{10}$). Solving for $\frac{x}{10}$, we get:
$$\boxed{\frac{x}{10} = 8800 - 88}$$
So, $\frac{x}{10} = 7912$. Now, substituting this value back into the first equation, we get:
$$\boxed{x = 88000 - 7912 \times 10}$$
Therefore, the answer is:
$$\boxed{x = 65080}$$
Harold sold $65080 \times 10 = 650800$ copies."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 guests invited to the party and since 25% of them will not show up (as mentioned in the problem), we can assume that 4 guests will not attend the party. So, the total number of guests at the party will be:

16 guests x 0.75 = 12 guests

Now, let's calculate how much Christina will spend on gift bags for each guest:

$2 x 12 guests = $24

So, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags for her guests."
"Response:  If an adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad and a child eats half that amount, then we can calculate how much each person will eat as follows:
Adult: 10 pounds / 20 adults = 0.5 pounds (or 250 grams) per person
Child: 10 pounds / 5 children = 0.2 pounds (or 90 grams) per person
Now, let's find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic:
Total weight of potato salad needed = Number of people x Amount each person will eat
= 20 adults x 0.5 pounds/person + 5 children x 0.2 pounds/person
= 10 pounds + 4 pounds
= 14 pounds (or 6.35 kilograms)
Therefore, Ted should bring at least 14 pounds (or 6.35 kilograms) of potato salad to the picnic to ensure there is enough for everyone to eat."
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three times more dogs than Marcia.
Marcia has two more dogs than Cindy.
Cindy has four dogs.
So, we can write an equation:
Jan = 3M (where M is Marcia)
Marcia = M + 2 (where M is Cindy)
Cindy = 4
Now, let's solve for ""the number of dogs"" in each group:
For Jan: 3M = 3(x) = x
For Marcia: M + 2 = x
For Cindy: 4 = x
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
Jan = 3M = 3(6) = 18
Marcia = M + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8
Cindy = 4 = 4
Therefore, the total number of dogs among the three friends is:
Jan = 18
Marcia = 8
Cindy = 4
Total = 18 + 8 + 4 = 30"
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write:
Amy - 5 = Jackson
Jackson + 2 = Corey
James - 10 = Corey (given)
Now, let's solve for Jackson's age:
Subtracting 5 from both sides of the first equation gives us:
Jackson = Amy - 5
Jackson = 9
So, Jackson is 9 years old."
Response:  If Lee is able to run 400 meters with hurdles in 38 seconds, and he was previously two seconds faster than Gerald in that distance, then we know that Lee ran 400 meters with hurdles in 36 seconds (since Gerald was two seconds slower). Now, if Gerald improved his speed by 10%, then he will be able to run 400 meters with hurdles in 39.6 seconds (since 10% of 36 seconds is 3.6 seconds, which is close to 39.6 seconds). Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters with hurdles in approximately 39.6 seconds.
"Response:  If there are 12 less conill than the number of dogs and cats combined, then...

Let D be the number of dogs, C be the number of cats, and N be the total number of animals (dogs + cats + conills).
We know that:
N = D + C
Since there are 12 fewer conills than the sum of dogs and cats, we can write:
D + C - 12 = N
Now we have to solve for D, C, and N. We can start by solving for N:
N = D + C - 12
Substituting the values given in the question:
N = 60 - 12
N = 48
So there are 48 animals in total in the barrio, including dogs, cats, and conills."
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in 5th grade, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in scouts. So, the number of girls who are not in scouts is (2/3) x (1 - 2/5). Can you calculate it now?
"Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours last night and his friend James slept for x hours less than Harry, then we can write an equation as follows:
x = 9 - y
where y is the number of hours that James slept. Substituting this equation into the problem statement, we get:
x = 9 - (2/3)
Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
x = 9 - 2/3
x = 10
Therefore, Harry slept for 1 hour more than James."
"Response:  We know that when Fred cooks canned tomatoes in sauce and they lose half their volume, each jar of tomato contains three tomatoes. So if the last batch of tomato sauce made by Fred contained 32 ounces (which is equal to 0.5 gallons), then he used...

$ \boxed {9 jars of tomatoes} $

So, Fred used 9 jars of tomatoes to make his last batch of tomato sauce!"
Response:  The first 15 minutes of the blockage are covered by 5 cars (since 5 cars took an exit to avoid passing through the flood). So, during these 15 minutes, 20 - 5 = 15 cars passed through the flood. In total, then, 30 - 5 = 25 cars passed through the flood in the first 15 minutes.
"Response: 
Maria has already given two plants in pots to each of the 40 windows of her big country house. So, she has given away 80 plants so far (2 x 40 = 80).
Now, she wants to give one plant in a pot to each of her friends and family members tomorrow. How many people does Maria have to give plants to?
Number of people = Total number of friends and family members / Number of plants available for giving away
= 80 / 18 (number of plants received today)
= 4.44 people
So, Maria will have to give plants to approximately 4.44 people tomorrow."
Response:  The first friend pressed the button 20 times before Jerome opened it, which means that the first friend pressed the button 20 / 5 = 4 times per second. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the first friend pressed the button 4 x 60 = 240 times in one minute. Now, let's find out how many times the third friend pressed the button. According to the problem statement, the third friend pressed the button 10 times more than the fourth friend, who pressed it 60 times. Therefore, the third friend pressed the button 60 x 1.5 = 90 times in one minute. Finally, we can calculate the total number of times the button was pressed as follows: 240 (first friend) + 90 (third friend) = 330 times per minute.
"Response: 
Solo has to read 4 pages of his science book, 20 pages of his social studies book, 7 pages of his history book, and 8 pages of his geography book in total. If he only read 15 pages on Monday, that means he has to read an average of 3.33 pages (15 / 4) per day to finish reading all the books within 4 days."
Response:  We know that John drinks water with every meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and also before going to bed. So he drinks 4 glasses of water per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, John drinks 28 glasses of water per week (4 x 7). However, during the weekends, he likes to relax and have a drink with his evening meal. Therefore, we need to add an additional 3 glasses of water for each weekend day (Saturday and Sunday), making it a total of 31 glasses of water per week (28 + 3).
Response:  The distance from the coastline to the center of the city is 42 miles. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3 miles, it will take 42/3 = 14 minutes to cover the entire distance. Therefore, it will take 14 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
Response:  Poppy has already placed 25% of the pieces (4/10) on the table. Then her mother places 33% of the remaining pieces (3/10). So far, they have used 58% of the total number of pieces (25 + 3 = 28). Therefore, there are 52% of the pieces left to place (100 - 28 = 72).
Response:  If Cody eats three times more gallettes than Amir, that means Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 galettes. So, if Amir eats 5 galettes, together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 galettes.
Response:  The volume of each box is given as 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches. Since there are three boxes, the total volume is 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches.
Response:  We know that Frankie watched TV for 7 hours in total. On Wednesday, he watched some episodes of a program that lasted for 30 minutes each. Since he had to stay late during the weekend, he watched two episodes of a one-hour show on Friday. Therefore, we can conclude that he watched 3 x 30 = 90 minutes of programs on Wednesday. So, he watched 90 - 7 = 83 minutes of programs on Wednesday.
"Response:  Last year, Henry made x galettes for the competition. When he finished cooking this time, he had y more galettes than last year. So, if he had x galettes last year and now has y + 5 = 110 galettes, we can write an equation:
x + (y + 5) = 110... (1)
Now, we need to solve for y. We know that y is equal to the number of galettes Henry made last year. Substituting this value in equation (1), we get:
x + y = 110... (2)
Since Henry wants to make double the amount as last year, we know that x = 2xlastyear. Therefore, substituting this value in equation (2):
2xlastyear + y = 110... (3)
Now, we can simplify the equation by subtracting y from both sides:
2xlastyear = 110 - y... (4)
Finally, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 2:
y = 55
Therefore, Henry made 55 galettes last year."
Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline at $3.00 per gallon, they will pay $30 for the gasoline itself ($3.00 x 10 gallons). Then, if they use the app to get $0.20 off per gallon, they will receive a total of $2.00 in rebates ($0.20 x 10 gallons). So, after getting the rebate, they will have paid a total of $28 for the gasoline ($30 - $2.00).
"Response:  If both Beatrice and Marcelli have eaten their full amount of fruit rolls, then we can calculate how many they ate in average as follows:
Beatrice had 2 wide rolls and 24 long rolls, so she ate a total of 2 + 24 = 26 rolls.
Marcelli had 3 wide rolls and 14 long rolls, so he ate a total of 3 + 14 = 17 rolls.
Now, let's divide the number of rolls each person ate by 2 (since there are two people) to get the average number of rolls eaten per person:
Average number of rolls eaten by Beatrice = 26 / 2 = 13 rolls
Average number of rolls eaten by Marcelli = 17 / 2 = 8.5 rolls
So, on average, Beatrice ate 13 rolls and Marcelli ate 8.5 rolls."
"Response:  We know that while Julia was in the boat and it was taking on water at a rate of two liters for every ten feet it moved towards shore, it took seventeen seconds to row twenty feet. The coast was sixty-four seconds away. So, if we let x be the distance traveled by the boat when Julia reached the shore, then we can write an equation as follows:
x = (2/10) \* t + 72
where t is the time taken to reach the shore in seconds. Substituting the value given in the problem, we get:
x = (2/10) \* 17 + 72
Simplifying, we get:
x = 96
Therefore, the boat had taken on 96 liters of water when Julia reached the shore."
Response:  If there are 4 professors and each one alternates in using the blackboard, then each professor will use the blackboard once every 4 days (since they alternate). So, if the blackboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, it means that it will be cleaned 12 times in a week (since there are 7 lessons per week). Therefore, the blackboard will be cleaned 36 times in a month (since there are 4 weeks in a month).
Response:  If Ryan plants two flowers per day and it takes 15 days for them to bloom, then he will have planted a total of 30 flowers (2 x 15 = 30). However, if 5 of these flowers did not grow, then Ryan will actually have 25 flowers in his garden (30 - 5 = 25).
"Response:  We know that the number of photographs that can be stored in Jamal's phone is six times more than the number of photographs that can be stored in Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone can store x photographs, then Jamal's phone can store 6x photographs.
We also know that the maximum number of photographs that can be stored in Brittany's phone is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo. So if there are y birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo, then the maximum number of photographs that can be stored in Brittany's phone is 50y photographs.
Now we have two equations:
6x = x + 50y (Jamal's phone)
x = y (Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo)
Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the value of y, which is the number of ants in Jamal's photo of ants at the zoo. Therefore, the answer is 30."
Response:  If she has ten pieces of 2x4 wood that each cost her $10, then she paid a total of $100 for those (since there are ten pieces). Similarly, if she has five pieces of 4x4 wood that each cost her $16, then she paid a total of $80 for those (since there are five pieces). In total, therefore, she paid $180 for all of the wood she bought. Now, let's assume that she is able to sell it all for $200. Then, her profit would be $200 - $180 = $20. So, she would make a profit of $20 from selling all of the wood.
Response:  We know that Katy used 7 times more sugar than water, so for every 13 ml of water she used 91 ml of sugar (7 x 13 = 91). Since she used a total of 120 ml of both, we can set up the equation: 91x + 36 = 120 where x is the number of ml of sugar used. Solving for x, we get x = 48 ml. So Katy used 48 ml of sugar.
Response:  If John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 sons, then he will buy a total of 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John will pay a total of $360. Therefore, John paid $360.
"Response:  On day one, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so in total, there were 10 vehicles imported. The next day, more containers arrived, but we don't know how many. So, let's assume that there were x new containers on the second day, and each container contained 5 vehicles again. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the second day is also 5x. 
So, the final answer is: 10 + 5x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 20. Therefore, there were 20 additional containers imported on the second day, containing 5 vehicles each, for a total of 30 vehicles imported in two days."
Response:  We know that Adrian's salary was $30% higher than Lyla's four years ago. So Adrian's salary was $70,000 ($100,000 x 30%). Four years later, Adrian's salary increased by 40%, which means it is now $102,000 ($70,000 x 1.4). Now we need to find out how much Lyla's salary has increased. Since their salaries have been increasing simultaneously, we can assume that Lyla's salary has also increased by 40%. Therefore, Lyla's new salary is $68,000 ($50,000 x 1.4). Finally, we add Adrian's and Lyla's new salaries together to get the total salary of both of them four years later: Total = $170,000 ($102,000 + $68,000).
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 blocks of paper per week and there are 30 sheets in each block, then he uses 60 sheets (2 x 30) per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he uses 8.5 sheets (60 / 7) per day.
Response:  We know that Morisette has 5 poms and 8 taronyes, so she has in total 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Now, we are told that Kael has twice as many pommes as Morisette, which means he has 2 x 5 = 10 pommes. Additionally, Kael has half as many naranjas as Morisette, which means he has 5 / 2 = 2 1/2 naranjas. Therefore, the total number of fruits brought by both students is 13 (Morisette) + 10 (Kael) + 2 1/2 (Kael) = 26 1/2 fruits.
Response:  On Monday, La Sadie slept for 8 hours. Tuesday and Wednesday she slept for x hours less than on Monday, so together they slept for 8 - 2x hours. Since Thursday she slept for 1 hour more than on those two days, she slept for 8 - 2x + 1 hours in total during the week.
"Response:  If La Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, then she has covered a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 mi/h x 3 h = 30 miles
Now, if she reduces her speed to 8 kilometers per hour, she will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 8 km/h x 7 h = 56 kilometers
Therefore, in 7 hours, La Rosie can cover a distance of 56 kilometers."
Response:  When Jennie started helping her mother at the office, there were x cartes that needed stamps and y cartes that had already been stamped. Since she put stamps on one-third of the cards that needed stamps (x/3), then the number of cards that needed stamps when she started is equal to 3x. Also, since there are now 30 cards with stamps out of a total of 60 cards, we can set up the equation: 3x = 30. Solving for x, we get: x = 20. So, when Jennie started helping her mother at the office, there were 20 cards that needed stamps.
Response:  We know that Julia had 3 cullerates left from her original pack of 6 (she used 3 and still has 3). Then, her husband gave her 5 more cullerates, so she now has a total of 8 cullerates (3 + 5 = 8). Finally, when she was setting the table, she used 3 more cullerates, bringing the total to 11 (8 + 3 = 11). Therefore, there were 11 cullerates in the pack that Julia bought.
Response:  We know that Dylan needed 42 salsitxes of chicken and fish to make chicken salads for a party. So he bought 38 salsitxes of chicken plus 6 salsitxes of fish, which is equal to 44 salsitxes in total. Therefore, Dylan bought 44 embryos in total.
Response:  If Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, then Amy has 30 friends (Lily + 20). So, if we add both their numbers, Lily and Amy together have 80 friends (30 + 50). Therefore, the answer is 80.
Response:  The cost of one melon is three times that of each pepper. So, if one pepper costs $15, then one melon will cost $3 x $15 = $45. Now, we need to buy 4 melons, so the total cost of melons will be $45 x 4 = $180. Similarly, we need to buy 20 peppers, so their total cost will be $15 x 20 = $300. Finally, we need to buy 10 taronjas, whose total cost will be $10 x 10 = $100. Therefore, the total amount that Dillon will spend at the store is $180 + $300 + $100 = $680.
"Response:  The number of patients seen in one day is given as 500. Since each patient takes an average of 24 minutes to be seen, the total time spent seeing patients in one day is:

Time = Number of patients x Time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes

Now, let's find out how much money the doctors earn from these visits. According to the question, each doctor charges $150 per hour and sees an average of 8 patients per hour (since they see 500 patients in one day). So, the total amount earned by each doctor in one day is:

Money earned by doctor = Total number of hours worked x Hourly wage = 8 patients/hour x $150/hour = $1,200

Finally, we need to calculate how much money the hospital makes from these visits. As mentioned earlier, the hospital charges each patient $200 per hour. If we assume that all 500 patients are seen during the day, then the total revenue generated by the hospital is:

Revenue = Number of patients x Price per patient = 500 x $200 = $100,000

So, the hospital makes $100,000 from these visits. To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to subtract the cost of seeing those patients from the revenue generated. The cost of seeing patients includes the salaries of the doctors ($1,200) and other expenses such as equipment maintenance, utilities, etc. Let's assume that the total cost of running the clinic for one day is $30,000 (this could include everything from staffing to supplies). Then, the profit made by the hospital can be calculated as follows:

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $70,000 from seeing 500 patients in one day."
Response:  We know that initially there are 60 elves working in the town of Santa. After one third of them leave, we have 40 elves left (30 = 2/3 x 60). Then, after another 10 elves leave due to the children kicking them, we have 30 elves left (10 = 10/3 x 30). Therefore, there are 30 elves left in the town of Santa.
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. So in June, his expenses were $60 less than that, which is $440 ($500 - $60). Therefore, Joseph's total expenses for both months are $500 + $440 = $940.
"Response: 
Pam and Fred went to a fair together. Pam rode the roller coaster twice while Fred rode it four times. After that, each of them decided to ride the log flume twice. If each ride costs 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?
Let X be the number of tickets used by Pam for riding the roller coaster. Since Fred rode it four times, he used 4X tickets in total. Similarly, let Y be the number of tickets used by Fred for riding the log flume. Since Pam rode it twice, she used 2Y tickets in total.
So, the total number of tickets used by both Pam and Fred is: 4X + 2Y = 10 (since each person rode the log flume twice).
Solving for X and Y, we get:
X = 4 ( since Pam rode the roller coaster twice)
Y = 3 ( since Fred rode the log flumin twice)
Therefore, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred is 4(4) + 2(3) = 56 tickets."
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), Walt walked 6 kilometers. On Tuesday (dimarts), he walked 6 times more miles than on Monday, so he walked 6 x 6 = 36 miles. Therefore, on Wednesday (dimecres), he walked 41 - 36 = 5 kilometers.
"Response:  If Tom pays four car rentals per month and each rental costs $15, then he pays:
4 rentals/month x $15/rental = $60/month
So in one year (12 months), Tom pays:
$60/month x 12 months = $720/year"
"Response:  We know that Bobby has 5 times more and 3 times more videos than Brian. So, if Brian has 20 videos, Bobby has:

5 times more = 5 x 20 = 100 videos
3 times more = 3 x 20 = 60 videos
Total number of videos in Bobby's collection = 100 + 60 = 160 videos
Therefore, Bobby has 160 videos in his collection."
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in total and two-thirds of them are located in Scotland (i.e., 19 unicorns). Since three-fourths of the Scottish unicorns are females (i.e., 15 females), we can conclude that there are 15 female unicorns in Scotland. Therefore, the number of female unicorns in Scotland is 15.
"Response: 
Rory ordered 2 subs for $7.50 each and 2 bags of fries for $1.50 each. He also ordered 2 muffins for $1.00 each. The total cost of these items is:
$7.50 x 2 = $15.00 + $1.50 x 2 = $3.00 + $1.00 x 2 = $2.00 = $20.00
The delivery charge is 20% of the total cost, so the delivery charge is:
$20.00 x 20% = $4.00
So the total cost of the delivery including the tip is:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00"
Response:  If Mark completed 75 questions in the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour, it means he took 15 hours to complete the test (75/5 = 15). Now, if he completed another test with 100 questions at the same rate, it will take him 20 hours to complete (100/5 = 20). So, he left 35 questions unanswered (20 - 15 = 35).
Response:  If there are 22 four times more pink marshmallows than blue ones, then the number of blue marshmallows is 4/5 of the total number of marshmallows. So, if there are 12 blue marshmallows, then there are 12 x 4/5 = 16 marshmallows in total. Therefore, there are 16 - 12 = 4 pink marshmallows.
"Response:  We know that out of 20 cars available for rent, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the rest are semi-automatic. So, we can write this information as follows:
Automatic = 12
Manual = 4
Semi-automatic = x (where x is the number of remaining cars)
Now, we need to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars among all the available cars. To do this, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of available cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (x / 20) × 100%
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) × 100% = 20%
Therefore, 20% of the 20 cars available for rent are semi-automatic."
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and we want to find out how many worker bees there are. According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as non-worker bees (nads). So, if there are x worker bees, there will be 2x non-worker bees. Now, let's substitute these values into the equation: 700 = x + 2x = 3x. Solving for x, we get x = 230. Therefore, there are 230 worker bees.
"Response: 
Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day and earns $10 per hour working part-time. To calculate how much money he would make in a week if he spent his gaming time working, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends gaming by the amount he earns per hour, then add that total to the number of hours he works and multiply it by his hourly wage.
So, let's do the calculation:
Gaming time = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week
Hourly wage from gaming = $10/hour x 14 hours/week = $140/week
Total hours worked = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week
Total earnings from work = $10/hour x 14 hours/week = $140/week
Therefore, Jordan would make $140 in a week if he spent his gaming time working."
"Response:  The total cost of all items is equal to the sum of their prices:

* Lletres: $2 x 5 = $10
* Ous: $3 x 2 = $6
* Bombetes: $3 x 1 = $3
* Tasses: $3 x 1 = $3
* Trampes per barracons: $4 x 1 = $4
Total cost = $10 + $6 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $28
Therefore, the total cost was $28."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much each customer will pay for cleaning services. Since there are three customers already signed up and five potential customers, let's assume that all of them will hire Kim's service. For each customer, they will require two bottles of bleach (costing $2) and one package of cloths (costing $5). Therefore, the total revenue from these customers can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Customers x Price Per Customer x Quantity of Products Each Customer Will Use Total Revenue = 3 x $2 x 2 + 5 x $5 x 1 = $60 + $25 = $85 Now, let's move on to calculating the expenses. As mentioned in the question, Kim has no other expenses apart from the cost of products. So, the total expense can be calculated as: Total Expense = Cost of Products x Number of Customers Total Expense = $2 x 3 + $5 x 5 = $12 + $25 = $37 Now, let's find out the profit. Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expense Profit = $85 - $37 = $48 per week. Therefore, Lucas will make a profit of $48 per week.
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land and there are 100 ananas per hectare. So, in total, he has 1000 ananas (10 x 100 = 1000). Since he can harvest them every 3 months, he will have 4 batches of ananas per year (1000 / 3 = 4). Therefore, John can collect 4000 ananas per year (4 x 1000 = 4000).
Response:  The first box had 500 pieces of Legos, and since Johnny collected all of them, he has 500 + 500 = 1000 pieces of Legos so far. Now, let's consider the second box. Since it had three times as many pieces as the first box, we can say that it had 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces of Legos. So, in total, Johnny has 1000 + 1500 = 2500 pieces of Legos. Finally, there was another box with one-quarter of the number of pieces as the third box. If we divide 2500 by 4 (since there were four boxes), we get 625 pieces of Legos left. Therefore, Johnny has collected a total of 2500 + 625 = 3125 pieces of Legos.
Response:  In the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees leave the bush and then come back in the next 6 hours, which means that half of them returned, or 15 bees. Then she saw twice as many bees leaving the bush than before, which is 2 x 15 = 30 bees. So, in total, Debra saw 45 bees leave the bush during those last 6 hours.
"Response:  The mother of Brittany gives $8 to the cashier in exchange for two tickets, one for an adult and one for a child. Therefore, the price of each ticket is:
Adult ticket = $12 - $8 = $4
Child ticket = $10 - $8 = $2
So, the mother of Brittany gave $4 to the cashier."
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, Charlie has 3x friends. Then we are told that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, James has 4x friends. Finally, we are given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. So we can set up the equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, James has 4x = 16 friends on Facebook.
"Response:  We know that Steve can go to school faster than Tim because he lives closer. So, if it takes Steve x minutes to reach school, then it will take Tim (x + 1) minutes to reach school since he has to travel farther. Since Tim is traveling at a speed of 264 feet per minute, it will take him y minutes to cover the distance of 3 kilometers. Therefore, we have two equations:

Steve's time = x
Tim's time = x + 1

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 15 minutes
y = 20 minutes

So, the winner will arrive at home after 15 minutes, and the loser will arrive after 20 minutes."
"Response: 
1. First day - 5 people with bicycles came to inflate both tires. Each tire costs $0.25 to inflate, so total cost for these 5 people = $5 (since there are two tires per bike).
2. Second day - 3 people with tricycles came to inflate their tires. Since each tricycle has three tires, total cost for these 3 people = $7.50 (since there are three tires per tricycle).
3. Third day - 1 person with a monowheel came to inflate one tire. Total cost for this person = $0.25.
Total revenue for all three days = $5 + $7.50 + $0.25 = $12.75.
Therefore, Shawnda earned $12.75 that day."
Response:  If Carl buys 2 packs of cookies and each pack has 6 cookies inside, then he will buy 2 x 6 = 12 cookies in total. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 12 x $0.10 = $1.20. Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, he received $10 - $1.20 = $8.80 in change.
Response:  When Dave bought the bag of French fries, there were x fries in it. He ate 14 before the seagull stole the bag from him. So, when the seagull flew away with the bag, there were x - 14 = 76 fries left. Then, three crows came and ate 3 fries each, leaving 76 - 9 = 67 fries. Later, a rat came and took two thirds of the remaining fries, which is equal to 2/3 × 67 = 45 fries. Finally, ants carried off one last fry, leaving 67 - 1 = 66 fries in the bag when Dave bought it. Therefore, when Dave bought the bag of French fries, there were 66 fries in it.
Response:  On Monday, Tuesday and Friday, Kimo has three classes of one hour each, so he spends 3 hours per day in class. On Wednesday and Thursday, Kimo has two classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 4 hours per day in class. In total, Kimo spends 7 hours per day (3 + 4) x 16 = 108 hours per semester attending classes.
"Response: 
We know that Bill has 300 palets of bread and 120 chocolate croissants per day. So, he needs space for all these products.
Let's assume each palet takes up 1 meter in length (which is a rough estimate). Then, we have:
Palets = 300 x 1 m = 300 meters long
Similarly, let's assume each chocolate croissant takes up 0.5 meters in length (again, a rough estimate). Then, we have:
Chocolate croissants = 120 x 0.5 m = 60 meters long
Now, let's calculate how much space Bill needs for his baguettes. Each baguette is 1.5 meters long, so Bill needs:
Baguettes = 60 x 1.5 m = 90 meters long
So, in total, Bill needs 300 + 60 + 90 = 450 meters long of space for his products.
Since Bill can only place them side by side, we need to divide this amount by the number of rows he can fit in one line. Let's assume he can fit 10 rows of products side by side. Then, we have:
Space needed per row = 450 / 10 = 45 meters long per row
Therefore, if Bill places all his products end to end, it will take him approximately 45 minutes to fill the entire space with his products."
"Response:  The caretaker of the zoo feeds all the monkeys in the zoo. He orders all the bananas from a local farm every two months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas each month, how many bananas does he need for two months?

To find out, we can use multiplication. We know that there are 2 months, so we multiply the number of bananas needed by 2:

200 + (400 x 2) + (100 x 2) =?

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 + 800 + 200 =?

The total number of bananas needed is 1200. So, the caretaker needs 1200 bananas for two months to feed all the monkeys in the zoo."
"Response: 
Blake runs from one side of the field to the other 15 times, so he covers a distance of 100 meters x 15 = 1500 meters.
Kelly runs once from one end of the field to the other (40 meters), then decides not to run with Blake and instead runs back and forth along the length of the field for 34 times, covering a total distance of 40 meters x 34 = 1360 meters.
Therefore, the total distance covered by both athletes is: 1500 + 1360 = 2860 meters.
Since they have 15 minutes to complete the race, we can calculate their speed as follows:
Speed = Distance / Time = 2860 / 15 = 194 meters per minute."
Response:  The total amount that Raphael has spent is equal to the sum of the prices he paid for each item. So, we can write: Total Cost = Price of pencils x 4 + Price of notebooks x 2 + Price of binder. We know that the price of one pencil is $1.50 and the price of one notebook is $4.00, so we can substitute these values into our equation: Total Cost = ($1.50 x 4) + ($4.00 x 2) + $20. Simplifying this equation gives us: Total Cost = $6.00 + $8.00 + $20 = $34.00. Therefore, Raphael has spent a total of $34.00 on all the materials he bought.
Response:  At first, Finn observed 11 ducks swimming in the pond. Then, he saw 6 more ducks coming out of an hiding place. Finally, he saw 2 ducks hiding under a rock. Therefore, the total number of ducks that Finn can see at the moment is: 11 + 6 = 17 ducks.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), the tank had an initial depth of 5 meters. Then, on Tuesday (dimarts), the tank gained 2 meters more water, so now it has a total depth of 7 meters (5 + 2). Finally, on Thursday (dimecres), the tank lost two-thirds of its water, which means that it now has a depth of 4.67 meters (7 - 2/3). Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Thursday was 4.67 meters.
"Response: 
Anakin captured 10 stars of sea, 6 horses of sea and 3 fish of pallasso. While Locsin caught 5 fewer stars than Anakin, 3 fewer horses than Anakin, and 2 more fish than Anakin. So, the number of fish that Locsin could catch is... (calculate)"
Response:  After one month, the price of the bag will increase by $4 (20% of $20). So after two months, the new price will be $24 ($20 + $4). Now let's assume that this pattern continues for another 35 months. Therefore, the price of the bag after 36 months will be $24 x 36 = $867.
"Response:  The total value of all toys is equal to the sum of their individual values. So, we can start by finding out how much each item costs:

* A figure action costs $5.
* A car red costs $4.

So, the total value of all toys is:

$5 (figure) + $4 (car) = $9

Therefore, the total value of all toys is $9."
Response:  If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will save 3 hours of work time at $35/hour = $105. However, if she hires a accountant, she will have to pay $90 for their services. So, the total cost is $90 - $105 = -$15. Therefore, if Jackie wants to maximize her profits, she should hire an accountant and pay them $90.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has a budget of $1500 given by her family for buying an computer and some clothes. Then she spent $1090 on the computer itself (screen, keyboard, mouse). Next, she bought an scanner for $157, a CD burner for $74, and a printer for $102, which adds up to $683 more. Therefore, Elvira will have $817 left over for buying clothes after purchasing all these items.
"Response:  If Veí gives Sandra one cistella of eggs every time she takes care of her daughter, and each cistella contains 9 eggs, then...

Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish omelette, so...

To make 15 Spanish omelettes for the school fundraiser, Sandra will need to prepare...

Therefore, Sandra has to take care of the child 4 times (or 4/1 = 4) in order to gather enough eggs to make all the required omelettes."
Response:  According to the problem statement, in two years, Seth will be twice as old as Brooke. So, if Brooke is currently x years old, then Seth will be 2x years old in two years. Moreover, we are told that the sum of their ages in two years will be equal to 28. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: 2x + x = 28. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 28. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 9. So, Brooke is currently 9 years old and Seth is twice as old, which means he is 18 years old.
"Response:  If Jimmy has $x dollars more than twice what Ethel has, then we can write an equation as follows:
Jimmy = 2 x + 8 (where ""x"" is the amount of money that Ethel has)
Now, based on the information given in the question, we know that Jimmy has $2 more than the double of what Ethel has. So, we can rewrite the above equation as:
Jimmy = 2(2x + 8)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Jimmy = 4x + 16
Therefore, Jimmy has $4x + $16 dollars."
"Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day, so he covers a total distance of 30 x 5 = 150 kilometers in those days. Now, on Saturdays and Sundays (the ""caps of setmana""), he only walks 10 miles per day, which is equal to 16.1 kilometers. So, in these two days, he covers a total distance of 16.1 x 2 = 32.2 kilometers. Therefore, in a week, Pancho covers a total distance of 150 + 32.2 = 182.2 kilometers."
"Response:  The band wants to buy new uniforms and each uniform includes a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times more than the hat, and pants that cost half of the combined cost of the hat and jacket. So, we need to find out how much each item costs and then add them up to get the total cost of each uniform.
Hat Cost = $25
Jacket Cost = 3 x $25 = $75
Pants Cost = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50
Total Cost per Uniform = $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $140
Therefore, each uniform costs $140 in total."
"Response:  The number of legs for each group is as follows:
* Aranyes: 8 x 8 = 64 legs
* Insectes: 90 x 6 = 540 legs
* Invertebrats mutants: 3 x 10 = 30 legs
Total number of legs seen by Jake = 64 + 540 + 30 = 634 legs."
Response:  We know that Sally Dos is three years older than Granny Red, so Granny Red is 3 + x = 2x years old (where x is an unknown number). Also, we know that Granny Red has twice as much age as Sally Four, which means that Sally Four is half of Granny Red's age. Therefore, Sally Four is 1/2(2x) = x years old. Finally, if Sally Four has the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, then Sally Thirtytwo is also x years old. So, the total age of all four birds is 2x + x = 3x years old.
Response:  We know that Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum payment for each debt. So we can assume that she will pay at least 50% of the minimum payment for each debt. For her student loans, the minimum payment is $300 per month, so she will pay at least $150 ($300 x 50%) towards those debts every month. For her credit card, the minimum payment is $200 per month, so she will pay at least $100 ($200 x 50%) towards that debt every month. And for her mortgage, the minimum payment is $500 per month, so she will pay at least $750 ($500 x 50%) towards that debt every month. Therefore, in one year, Jessica will have paid a total of: $150 + $100 + $750 = $920 towards her debts.
"Response: 
1. Billy has to peel and chop 60 potatoes for the family barbecue.
2. Each potato takes him approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel (since he can do it in 1 minute and 30 seconds).
3. He spends only half that time chopping each potato (i.e., 5 seconds).
4. Therefore, total time needed to prepare all 60 potatoes = (1 + 1/2) x 60 = 35 minutes."
Response:  We know that they sold x liters of lemonade and each liter cost them $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. They also sold each glass for $0.50 and made 20 glasses per gallon. So, their total revenue was $x + (20 \* x/5) = 25 dollars. Now we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. Since they made $x + (20 \* x/5) = 25 dollars in revenue, and they spent $3 for every liter of lemons they sold, then the number of liters they sold is given by the equation $x = (25 - 3 \* x)/(2 \* 0.50)$. Solving this equation, we get x = 16 liters. Therefore, they spent $48 on lemons ($3 \* 16).
Response:  We know that there are 240 participants in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Asian participants who are not Japanese is 240 - 80 = 160. Since we also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can conclude that the number of girls on the Chinese team is 60 - 60 = 0. Therefore, there are no nenes on the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends one-fourth of his income on rent, which is $1500 (since he earns $6000). Secondly, he spends one-third of his income on fuel for his car, which is $2000 (since he drives 10,000 miles per year at an average cost of $2 per mile). Thirdly, he gives half of the remaining amount to charity, which is $3000 ($6000 x 0.5 = $3000). Fourthly, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife, respectively. Therefore, the total amount he spends on these expenses is $6800 ($1500 + $2000 + $3000 + $200 + $700). Now let’s calculate how much money he has left after all these expenses: $6000 - $6800 = -$800. So, Zaid does not have any money left after paying all his bills and donations.
Response:  We know that Rani has 12 bats more than Monica and Monica has 4 bats less than Bo. So, if we call the number of bats that Monica has x, then Rani has x + 12 = 13 bats. Now, Bo has 40 carpings, so let's say that Monica has x carpings as well. Therefore, Rani has 13 + x = 15 carpings in total.
"Response:  We know that Lloyd has worked for 2 weeks and earned $10 per hour. So, in total he has earned:

Week 1: 5 hours x $10/hour = $50
Week 2: 8 hours x $10/hour = $80
So, Lloyd has earned a total of $130 in two weeks."
"Response:  The number of students in the class is 80 and two candidates are running for election. If one candidate obtained 3/4 of the votes, then the other candidate got...

Please provide your reasoning or solution to this problem."
Response:  If Sandra asked for four times more red roses than white clavellums and she also requested 200 pink lilies which are five times more than the white clavellums, then we need to find out how many red roses and pink lilies Sandra actually received. Let's assume that Sandra received x red roses and y pink lilies. We know that x + y = 4 (the number of white clavellums) since Sandra asked for four times more red roses than white clavellums. Also, x + 2y = 200 (the total number of lilies Sandra requested). Now we have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve them using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving the first equation for x, we get x = 8. Substituting this value into the second equation, we get y = 16. So, Sandra received 8 red roses and 16 pink lilies less than what she actually ordered. To find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver before 5 pm, we need to subtract the number of red roses Sandra received from the total number of red roses she ordered. In this case, Fred needs to deliver 32 red roses (4 - 8) before 5 pm to satisfy Sandra's request.
Response:  We know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is x years old, then Jean is x + 2 years old. Also, we know that two years ago, Mark was five years more than half of Jan's age. So, if Jan is y years old now, then two years ago, Mark was y/2 + 5 = y - 5 years old. Now, we are told that Jan is 30 years old, so her age at present is y = 30. Substituting this value in the equation for Mark's age two years ago, we get (y - 5) = x + 2. Solving for x, we find that Mark is 27 years old. Therefore, Jean is 27 + 2 = 29 years old.
Response:  The team that is faster will finish in 55 seconds, and each member of their team will run for 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. Therefore, they will complete the race in 2200 seconds (4 x 55). On the other hand, the slower team will take 60 seconds to cover the distance of 400 meters, so it will take them 2400 seconds (4 x 60) to complete the race. Thus, the difference between the two teams' times is 1200 seconds or 2 minutes.
"Response:  The probability of getting an odd number is $\frac{1}{2}$. Since we are asking for the probability that the number is greater than $3$, we need to subtract the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers (which is also $\frac{1}{2}$). Therefore, the desired probability is:

$$\begin{align\*}
P(\text{number greater than }3) &= P(\text{odd number}) - P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) \
&= \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \
&= \frac{3}{8} \
&= \boxed{\frac{37}{100}}
\end{align\*})$$"
Response:  If Jenna collected half of the total number of apples and her mother collected the remaining half, then together they collected 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 whole apple. So, if their mother received 20 apples, then Jenna collected 20 / 2 = 10 apples.
Response:  We know that there are three groups of rodents in different cages and each group has an equal number of rodents. The first group contains 8 rodents (since 8 x 6 = 48 pieces of food), the second group contains 7 rodents ( since 7 x 5 = 35 pieces of food), and the third group contains 9 rodents (since 9 x 6 = 54 pieces of food). Therefore, there are altogether 8 + 7 + 9 = 24 rodents in the three groups. Since we have distributed 160 pieces of food among all the groups, each rodent gets 160 / 24 = 6.67 pieces of food per day. So, there must be at least 6.67 rodents in each cage to divide the given amount of food equally. But we were asked to round up to the nearest whole number, so let’s assume that there are exactly 7 rodents in each cage.
Response:  The amount borrowed was $100 and the interest rate is 2% per month. So after one month, the amount owed will be: $100 + (2% of $100) = $100 + $2 = $102. After two months, the amount owed will be: $102 + (2% of $102) = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04. And so on... If it took three months to pay back the loan, then the total amount paid back would be: $100 + $102 + $104.04 = $306.04. Therefore, Benedict should give $70.96 to La Mandy ($306.04 - $100).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the merchant paid $20 for each bag of wheat from the farmer. Then, to transport each bag from the farm to his store cost him $2. Therefore, he spent a total of $20 + ($2 x number of bags) = $20 + $4 = $24 per bag. Now, if he sold all the bags at a price of $30 each, then his total revenue would be $30 x number of bags = $30x. After deducting the cost of transportation and buying the bags, his profit is given as $400. So, we can set up an equation: $30x - $24 = $400. Solving for 'x', we get x = 16. Therefore, the merchant sold 16 bags of wheat.
Response:  The total amount spent at the fair was $20.25 + $4.50 - $17 = $6.25. Since they agreed to split the costs equally among themselves, each person paid $6.25 / 3 = $2.08.
Response:  If John collects for 3 hours, he will have collected for 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. Since he can collect 2 pears per minute, he will have collected 180 / 2 = 90 pears in total.
Response:  If an eagle needs to eat 3.5 kg of insects per week to survive and there are ten eagles in total, then each eagle needs to eat 0.35 kg (or 350 grams) of insects per day.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 18 trees left."
Response:  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 red plastic flamingos in Sue's backyard. Then, on Saturday morning, they returned with one-third of the flamingos and painted them white. They then placed these newly painted white flamingos in front of Sue's house. Finally, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 red plastic flamingos to the collection. Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were how many more red plastic flamingos than white ones? Answer: At noon on Sunday, there were 18 + 18 = 36 red plastic flamingos, which is 18 more than the number of white flamingos (18). So, the answer is 18.
Response:  The total cost of the crayons is 5 x $2 = $10. So, Violetta will have $20 - $10 = $10 left after buying the crayons. Therefore, she will have $10 in change.
Response:  If one pencil costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30, then 8 pencils will cost $9.60 ($1.20 x 8). Therefore, 8 pens will cost $9.60.
"Response:  We have to distribute 200 kilograms of croissants among 40 restaurants in a certain city. Since each restaurant will receive 2 kilograms of croissants, we need to calculate how many kilograms of croissants won't be used. So, the number of unused kilograms is:

200 kg - (40 x 2 kg) = 200 kg - 80 kg = 120 kg

Therefore, 120 kilograms of croissants won't be used."
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in Soda. Among them, there are 8417 men and 9092 women. This means that the total number of adults (men + women) is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. Since we were told that ""the rest of the population"" consists of children, this means that the number of children is equal to 17509 - (8417 + 9092) = 17509 - 17501 = 1009. Therefore, there are 1009 children in Soda."
Response:  At first month, Elaine had 20 cards of Pokemon. Then she collected three times more than that in the second month, so she got 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as in the previous two months, so she got 120 cards (2 x 60 = 120). Therefore, Elaine has 120 cards of Pokemon in total.
Response:  We know that Editor A pays $0.05 per phrase and Editor B pays twice as much, or $0.10 per phrase. Since Mark writes 1000 phrases per week for both editors, he earns a total of $50 from Editor A and $100 from Editor B. So his total weekly income is $150.
Response:  If he takes 5 cups of water each morning and 6 cups each afternoon, then in total he takes 5 + 6 = 11 cups of water per day. Since each cup contains 5 liters of water, then the total amount of water he receives per day is 11 x 5 = 55 liters. Therefore, Baldur receives 55 liters of water per day.
"Response:  If he gets paid weekly and receives the prize money of $5000 once a year, then his total earnings for the year will be:
Weekly income = $2000 x 52 weeks = $104,000
Prize money = $5000
Total earnings = Weekly income + Prize money = $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000
Therefore, John Guanya earned $109,000 that year."
"Response:  If each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes and each ton makes 2 barrels of wine, then we have:
Granja = 10 hectares x 5 tons/hectare = 50 tons of grapes per year
Now, let's convert the number of tons to barrels of wine:
50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year
Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Response: 
Carl likes cheese and eats it every day for lunch with two slices of cheese in each sandwich. He also has an omelette with cheese and eggs three days a week, using more cheese than egg. Additionally, he makes a large pasta dish with cheese once a week and uses eight slices of cheese in it. So, how many pieces of cheese does Carl use in total?
Total number of pieces of cheese used = Number of sandwiches x 2 slices/sandwich + Number of omelettes x (more cheese than egg) + Number of pasta dishes x 8 slices/dish
= 7 sandwiches x 2 slices/sandwich + 3 omelettes x (more cheese than egg) + 1 pasta dish x 8 slices/dish
= 14 + 6 + 8
= 28 pieces of cheese
Therefore, Carl uses 28 pieces of cheese throughout the week."
"Response: 
Janet had initially 22 green feathers and 10 orange feathers, so she had in total 32 feathers.
Then, she bought 6 bags of blue feathers containing 9 feathers each, so she got 54 blue feathers.
Finally, she bought 2 bags of red feathers containing 6 feathers each, so she got 12 red feathers.
In total, Janet has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 feathers now."
Response:  If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in his first five tests, then he needs to get at least a score of 94 in the sixth test to have an average of 93. Therefore, the answer is 94.
"Response: 
Firstly, he went for a bike ride at least 5 times a week and covered 25 km each time during 4 weeks. So, in total, he cycled 5 x 25 = 125 km/week.
Then, he reduced his bike rides to twice a week but increased the distance to 60 km each time during 3 weeks. Therefore, he cycled 2 x 60 = 120 km/week.
So, in total, he cycled 125 + 120 = 245 km."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 barrels of chocolate and 80 pieces of candied apples in Joe's Halloween candy bag. If each bar of chocolate weighs twice as much as each piece of candied apple, then...

Step-by-step solution:
Let X be the weight of one bar of chocolate (in grams). Since each bar of chocolate weighs double the weight of each piece of candied apple, we can write:
X = 2Y
where Y is the weight of one piece of candied apple (also in grams).
Now, we know that there are 25 barrels of chocolate in total, so the total weight of all the chocolate is:
Total weight of chocolate = 25X = 25(2Y) = 50Y
Similarly, since there are 80 pieces of candied apple in total, the total weight of all the candied apple is:
Total weight of candied apple = 80Y = 80(2Y) = 160Y
So, the total weight of all the candy in Joe's bag is:
Total weight of candy = Total weight of chocolate + Total weight of candied apple = 50Y + 160Y = 210Y
Therefore, the weight of each piece of candy in Joe's bag is:
Weight of each piece of candy = Total weight of candy / Number of pieces of candy = 210Y / 160 = 133Y
Since each bar of chocolate weighs 40 grams, we can convert the weight of each piece of candy to grams by dividing it by the weight of one bar of chocolate:
Weight of each piece of candy in grams = Weight of each piece of candy in Y = 133Y / 40 = 330Y / 40 = 8.25Y
Therefore, the weight of each bombon in Joe's bag is approximately 8.25 grams."
Response:  On Monday (Rose went to the store), she bought 4 pastries. Then on Tuesday (she went to another store), she bought 3 times more pastries than on Monday, so she bought 12 pastries (since 3 x 4 = 12). Finally, on Wednesday (she went to yet another store), she bought 5 times as many pastries as she did on Tuesday, so she bought 60 pastries (since 5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, after three days, Rose bought a total of 72 pastries (60 + 12 + 4 = 72).
"Response:  We know that vint dotzenes (50) of cups cost $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen (3) plates sold for $6,000 each. So, we can write an equation as follows:

$1,200 = Total Cost of Half a Dozen Plates - Cost per Cup x Number of Cups

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:

$1,200 = $6,000 - ($6,000 / 3) x 50

Simplifying and solving for the cost per cup:

Cost per Cup = $1,200 / 50 = $24

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $24."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has to work for 4 times as a babysitter and each time she earns $5. So, in total, she will have earned $20 ($5 x 4). Secondly, we know that Sara already had $10 saved before starting her job as a babysitter. Now, let's calculate how many times she needs to cut grass to save enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. We can do this by dividing the cost of the items by the amount of money she earns per time she works as a babysitter. The cost of the jacket is $30 and the cost of each pair of shoes is $20, so together they cost $50. To find out how many times Sara needs to work as a babysitter to save enough money, we divide $50 by $20 (the amount she earns per time): $50 / $20 = 2.5 times. Since you cannot divide by a fraction, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 times. Therefore, Sara needs to work as a babysitter 3 times to save enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.
Response:  We know that there are more white hens than red ones because we have two white pollsters and only one red pollster in Jerry's flock. So, if there were no white hens, Jerry would collect 42 eggs per day from the red hens alone (since each red hen lays 3 eggs). But since there are white hens too, they also lay eggs, so Jerry collects 42 + x eggs where x is the number of eggs laid by the white hens per day. Since the white hens lay 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs collected by Jerry per day is 42 + 5 = 47 eggs per day. Now, let's find out how many red hens Jerry has based on this information. If he collects 47 eggs per day and each red hen lays 3 eggs per day, then there are 47 / 3 = 15 red hens in Jerry's flock. Therefore, Jerry has 15 red pollssters and 2 white pollssters.
"Response:  The distance of the park is 1.5 miles wide and 6 miles long. If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, then in one hour he will have walked a distance of 3 miles = 0.5 miles (since there are 6 miles in total). So, in 1 hour, he has walked half a mile. Therefore, to find out how many hours it takes him to walk around the entire park, we divide the distance of the park by his walking speed: 
Time taken = Distance / Speed = 1.5 miles / 3 miles/hour = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes."
Response:  On day one, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. On the second day, he counted 50 more customers than the first day, so he counted 150 customers (100 + 50). Therefore, on the third day, he counted 300 customers (150 + 150).
"Response:  If Jerry had two pools with leaks that emptied them at 4 gallons per minute and he did this for four minutes, then...

Pool A (the large one) had twice as much water as Pool B (the small one) initially. So after 4 minutes, if Pool A lost 16 gallons (since it took 4 minutes to empty), then...

Pool B lost 4 gallons in the same time period, so it lost 0.53 gallons per minute (since it has half the capacity of Pool A). Now, let's find out how much water Pool B loses in total...

So, Pool B loses 0.53 gallons/minute x 4 minutes = 2.12 gallons in total. And since it started with 100 gallons, it now has 97.88 gallons left.

Therefore, the amount of water left in Pool B is 97.88 gallons."
Response:  To calculate how many hours she needs to work before being able to buy the shoes and belt, we need to know her total earnings after taxes. Her hourly wage is $8, so if she works for x hours, her total earnings will be $x \* $8/100 = $x \* 0.8. Now, let's compare this amount with the cost of the shoes and belt: $320 + $32 = $352. Since $352 > $320 (the cost of the shoes), she can afford to buy them. Therefore, she has to work x hours such that $x \* 0.8 > $352. Solving for x, we get x = 46. So, she needs to work for 46 hours before being able to afford the shoes and belt.
Response:  If Janeth borrows $2000 and promises to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount, then she will have to pay back $2200 ($2000 + $200). If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, the remaining balance after 12 months will be $2200 - $165 \* 12 = $1835. So, the final balance left for Janeth is $1835.
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the floral arrangement and six more daisies than roses. So, if there are x daisies, then there will be 6x flowers in total in the floral arrangement. Therefore, the number of flowers in the floral arrangement is 4 + 6x = 10x.
"Response:  Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet is half of Zack's age. So we can write:
Age of Adrian = 3 x Age of Harriet
Age of Harriet = Half of Zack's age
Now we know that Harriet is 21 years old now, so we can substitute this value in the first equation:
Age of Adrian = 3 x 21
Age of Adrian = 63
Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack is 63 years."
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's score. So, Yuri scored at least 68/2 = 34 points. Additionally, Brianna scored more than Naomi but less than Yuri. Therefore, Brianna scored between 68 and 34 = 34 points. Now, we have to find out how many points Jojo scored. According to the problem, Jojo scored fewer points than any of the other students. So, Jojo scored less than 251 - (68 + 34) = 159 points. Hence, Jojo scored 159 points.
"Response: 
Carmen said it took her 10 minutes to solve one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve one Sudoku.
She solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku during the weekend.
So, she spent a total of:
Time spent solving crossword puzzles = 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes
Time spent solving Sudoku = 8 x 5 minutes = 40 minutes
Total time spent playing games = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes"
Response:  We know that initially there were 120 liters of water in the tank and then Celine used 90 liters to water her small garden. So, now we have 30 liters left in the tank (120 - 90 = 30). Then, we are told that Celine was able to collect double the amount of rainwater than what remained in the tank. Therefore, if she collected x liters of rainwater, then the total amount of water in the tank after collection would be 30 + x liters. So, the final answer is 30 + x liters.
Response:  We know that Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 petunias. The number of flowers planted in total is equal to the sum of the number of geraniums and petunias. Therefore, we can write: Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total number of flowers = 90 + 40 = 130. So, Andy plants 130 flowers in total.
Response:  The first year, the company spent $15,000 on advertising. In the second year, they spent $\frac{1}{3}$ of that amount, or $5,000. So, in total, the company spent $15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000 dollars on advertising over the two years.
Response:  If Carlos rents the canoe for 3 hours and pays $30/hour, then he will pay $90 ($30 x 3) for renting the canoe. Similarly, if Benji rents the pontoon boat for 5 hours and pays $18/hour, then he will pay $90 ($18 x 5) for renting the pontoon boat. Therefore, in total, they will pay $180 ($90 + $90).
"Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester and half of those days are spent driving back in a car, then we can calculate as follows:
Day 1: Travel from NJ to Rochester by bus (6 hours)
Day 2-3: Drive back from Rochester to NJ (4 hours each day)
Total time = 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 days
Therefore, if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, it will take him 14 days to complete the trip."
Response:  If James had initially 40% of his cards as water types, and he lost 8 cards of that type, then he has 40 - 8 = 32% of his cards left as water types. Now, if he buys 14 new cards of any type, including water types, then he will have 32 + 14 = 46% of his cards as water types. So, the probability that a randomly drawn card is a water type is 46%.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the burrito without any upgrades or extras:

Base price of burrito = $6.50
Total cost = $6.50 + (carne extra x $2) + (formatge extra x $1) + (avocat extra x $1) + (2 sauces x $0.25 each) = $9.75
Now, let's consider the additional upgrade of adding potatoes and a drink for $3 more:
Additional cost = $3
New total cost = $9.75 + $3 = $12.75
Finally, let's subtract the gift card value of $5:
Final amount due = $12.75 - $5 = $7.75
Therefore, Chad owes $7.75 in total."
"Response:  The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, then they will complete the puzzle in the following time:
Kalinda - 360/4 = 90 minutes
Mother - 180/2 = 90 minutes
Therefore, it will take them 90 + 90 = 180 minutes to complete the puzzle."
Response:  We know that after two months, 30% of the melons were ready to be harvested, so Ashlyn collected them and brought them home. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready to be harvested, so she collected them too. So, how many melons weren't ready to be harvested after those two weeks? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of melons Ashlyn collected from the total number of melons left in the field. Total number of melons = 120 (from the beginning) - 30 (ready to be harvested after two months) = 90 Melons not ready for harvesting after two weeks = 90 - 3/4 x 90 = 60 Therefore, there were 60 melons not ready to be harvested after those two weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark buys 12 cars for his company. Each car costs $20,000, so he pays a total of $240,000 ($20,000 x 12) for all the cars. Then, he pays an income tax of 10%, which is equal to $24,000 (10% of $240,000). Finally, he also pays $1,000 for registering each car, so in total he pays $265,000 ($240,000 + $24,000 + $1,000 x 12).
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she collected 5 + 20 = 25 shells. On Tuesday (dimarts), Kylie doubled her collection from Monday, so she collected 25 x 2 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If Dax found half of the insects in the garden, that means he found 50/2 = 25 insects. So, there are 25 + 50 = 75 insects in the garden altogether.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 penguins in total and they are taking sunbathing at the beach. Then, we have three scenarios:
1. Some of them jump into the ocean (a third of them). So, the number of penguins remaining on the beach is 36 - 12 = 24.
2. Another group goes to eat in a cave (another third of them). So, the number of penguins remaining on the beach is 24 - 8 = 16.
3. The last group stays on the beach to take sunbathe (the remaining third of them). So, the final number of penguins staying on the beach is 16 + 12 = 28.
Therefore, there are 28 penguins left on the beach after all the movements."
Response:  If Steve eats double the amount of tomatoes than his wife and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, then his total daily consumption is twice that of his wife. So, if his wife produces 3 tomatoes per week, then Steve needs 2 x 3 = 6 lives to produce the same amount of tomatoes as his wife.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend wants to have 4 pieces of pizza. Since the pizzas come in 8 slices only, we need to divide the number of friends by the number of slices per pizza. So, John needs to ask for 5 pizzas (20 friends / 4 pieces per friend = 5 pizzas).

Response:  If Johnny took $20 and added $10 more, he now has $30. Then, if he invested this amount and it tripled in one year, he would have $90 after one year. So, Johnny had $90 after one year.
Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is x - 2 years old. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can write Joan = 5 + x years old. Finally, since Jessa has an age of 20, we have Jessa = x + 20 years old. Now we need to find out what value fits all these equations simultaneously. Solving for x, we get: x = 18 years old. So, the sum of their ages is: Mary = 18 + (x - 2) = 18 + 16 = 34 years old Joan = 5 + x = 5 + 18 = 23 years old Jessa = x + 20 = 18 + 20 = 38 years old Therefore, the sum of their ages is 34 + 23 + 38 = 95 years old.
"Response:  The total number of students in the room was 1000. Now, let's calculate how many students left through each exit:

* Through exit A: 30% of 1000 = 300 students
* Through exit B: 3/5 of 700 (since 300 students already left through exit A) = 240 students
* Through exit C: 1000 - 300 - 240 = 460 students

Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is 460."
"Response:  We know that James has 6 caramels more than Robert. So, if Robert has x caramels, then James has 6 + x caramels. 
We also know that John has twice as many caramels as Robert. So, if Robert has x caramels, then John has 2x caramels. 
Finally, we are told that John has 54 caramels in total. So, we can set up the equation: 6 + x = 54. Solving for x, we get: x = 48. Therefore, John has 108 caramels (2x) more than James."
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then collectively they have 3 books. If both of them read each other's books as their own, then Dolly will read 2 books (Pandora's + her own) and Pandora will read 1 book (Dolly's + her own). Therefore, at the end, they will have read a total of 5 books together.
"Response: 
Mike has 5 friends with whom he is in contact through letters. If he stops being friends with two of them, then there are 3 remaining friends.
Each friend sends 2 letters per week, so in total, Mike receives 6 letters per week (3 friends x 2 letters/week).
To calculate how many hours Mike spends writing letters per week, we need to divide the number of letters he receives by the time it takes him to write one letter. Since he can write a page in 6 minutes, he can write an hour in 10 minutes (6 minutes / 0.1 pages/minute = 10 minutes/page). Therefore, Mike spends 10 minutes writing each letter, and since he receives 6 letters per week, he spends 60 minutes (10 minutes/letter x 6 letters/week) writing letters per week."
Response:  We know that Jason has used 300 minutes of additional calls this month, so he has used a total of 700 minutes (1000 - 300) of his allowance. Since there are 30 days in the month, we can calculate how many minutes he has left per day as follows: Number of minutes remaining = Total minutes available x Number of days in the month / Number of days in the month = 1000 / 30 = 33.33 minutes per day So, if Jason has 30 days in the month, he will have 33.33 minutes left each day.
"Response: 
Griffin had 24 French fries initially.
Kyle took 5 French fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 French fries left.
Billy took twice as many French fries as Kyle, so he took 2 × 5 = 10 French fries from Griffin.
After Ginger gave Griffin some of her French fries, Griffin had x French fries left.
Colby took 3 fewer French fries than Kyle, so he took 3 - 5 = -2 French fries from Griffin.
At the end, Griffin had 27 French fries, so the number of French fries Ginger gave him is 27 - x = 19.
Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 6 French fries (x = 6)."
Response:  If there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in another, that means there is a ratio of 8:16 between the number of snails in each aquarium (since 4/32 = 1/8). Now, we know that the difference between the number of fish in both aquariums is double the number of fish in each aquarium. So, if there are x fish in the first aquarium, there will be 2x fish in the second aquarium. Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquariums is equal to 8x + 16(2x) = 8x + 32x = 40x. Since the total number of fish in both aquariums is equal, we can set up the equation: 40x = 72. Solving for x, we get x = 18. So, there are 18 fish in each aquarium.
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate how much time she spends working each day. Since it takes her 6 hours to do the makeup for one day of filming and she works 4 days a week, that means she spends 24 hours (6 x 4) doing makeup each week.
Next, we need to calculate how much money she earns in a week. If she charges $250 an hour and works 24 hours a week, then she earns $6,000 ($250/hour x 24 hours/week).
Now let’s move on to calculating how much money she makes during the entire production period. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish shooting, and she works 4 days a week, that means she works a total of 20 weeks (5 weeks x 4 days/week). So, if she earns $6,000 per week, then she earns a total of $120,000 ($6,000/week x 20 weeks) during the entire production period.
Finally, since the maquillador gives her a discount of 10%, that means he pays her $98,300 instead of $120,000. Therefore, Jean ends up getting paid $98,300 for her work on the movie."
Response:  We know that Isabella spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on party favors. To divide these costs equally among her parents, she paid $12 / 3 = $4 per person for the ingredients, $43 / 3 = $14 per person for the gifts, $15 / 3 = $5 per person for the decorations, $4 / 3 = $1 per person for the invitations, and $22 / 3 = $7 per person for the party favors. So each of her parents paid $4 + $14 + $5 + $1 + $7 = $31.
Response:  The chef has bought 4 bunches of cabbage. Each bunch weighs 50 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the bunches is 4 x 50 = 200 kg. Since each kilogram of cabbage costs $1.50, then the total cost of all the cabbage is 200 kg x $1.50/kg = $300. So, the chef has spent $300 buying cabbage.
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more cookies than her sister. So she ate 4 x 4 = 16 cookies. Then on Tuesday, she doubled that amount and ate 2 x 16 = 32 cookies. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Wednesday. Therefore, Sue ate 32 - 5 = 27 more cookies than her sister. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 27 x 200 = 5400 calories more than her sister.
