She feeds them in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives them 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she gives them an additional 25 bowls of food. Since there are 20 chickens in the coop, Wendi must give them a total of 30 bowls of food for their last meal of the day."
"Response: 92 $
Explanation: To calculate the cost of 16 glasses for Kylar, we need to use the formula: Cost = (Number of glasses x Price per glass) + (Number of glasses x Discount percentage). In this case, the price per glass is $5, and the discount percentage is 60%. So, the total cost of 16 glasses would be: Cost = ($5 x 16) + ($5 x 16 x 60%) = $92."
"Response: 156 (Toulouse has 2 x 3 = 6 moutons; Charleston has 4 x 9 = 36 moutons; Seattle has 20 moutons). Total number of moutons = 6 + 36 + 20 = 156."
"Response: 3 hours and 40 minutes (or 210 minutes).
Explanation:
Carla has to restart her computer for 20 minutes to install updates, which means she will lose 20% of progress made so far (i.e., 40% - 20% = 20%). After the restart, she will have to start downloading from the beginning, which takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time required to download the file is:
Time = Total size / Download speed + Time lost due to restart = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute + 20 min = 3 h 40 min or 210 minutes."
"Response: 15 miles (24 km)
Explanation:
Jean spent 3 hours driving at a speed of 60 mph, which means he traveled a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 miles during that time. Since he then lost 2 hours in traffic jams and drove at 30 mph for one hour, he covered an additional distance of 30 x 1 = 30 miles. Finally, he drove at 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours, which brings him back home with a total distance traveled of 180 + 30 + 2 x 80 = 15 miles."
"Response: 630 $
Explanation:
First, calculate Elisa's hourly rate for her first 40 hours of work at $10/hour:
$10 x 40 = $400
Next, calculate her additional hours (45 - 40) at her regular hourly rate:
$10 x 5 = $50
Total hours worked = 45 hours
Total pay = $400 + $50 = $450
Therefore, Elisa's weekly salary is $450."
"Response: 120
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* In the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times.
* In the second month, the program was downloaded three times more than in the first month, so it was downloaded 60 x 3 = 180 times.
* In the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30%, which means that it was downloaded 180 - (30/100) = 120 times.

Therefore, the total number of times the program was downloaded over these three months is 60 + 180 + 120 = 360."
Response: 417.90 $ 
"Response: 6 years
Explanation: To calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to subtract the initial cost of the plantation (90$) from the total revenue generated by the tree each year. The total revenue is calculated as follows:
Total Revenue = Number of lemons produced x Selling price per lemon
= 7 lemons x 1.5$ per lemon
= 10.5$ per year
Now, we need to subtract the annual maintenance costs (3$ per year) from the total revenue to get the net income:
Net Income = Total Revenue - Annual Maintenance Costs
= 10.5$ - 3$
= 7.5$ per year
Since Carlos has invested 90$ in the plantation, he will break even after 6 years (90$ / 7.5$ per year = 6 years). This means that after 6 years, Carlos will start making a profit from his lemon tree."

"Response: 3750$
Explanation:
The value of the jewelry is 5000$, and the expected increase in their market price is 2.5%. So, the new value of the jewelry will be:
5000 x (1 + 0.025) = 5125$.
Similarly, the value of the electronics is 8000$, and the expected increase in their market price is 1.2%. So, the new value of the electronics will be:
8000 x (1 + 0.012) = 8160$.
Now, if the merchant chooses to buy the jewelry, he will make a profit of:
Profit = New Value - Original Value = 5125 - 5000 = 125$.
If he chooses to buy the electronics, he will make a profit of:
Profit = New Value - Original Value = 8160 - 8000 = 160$.
Therefore, the maximum profit that the merchant can make is 160$."

"Response: 48,670$/year
Explanation: To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she works per week and then by the number of weeks in a year. For teaching, she works 35 hours per week, for training, she works 15 hours per week, and there are 50 weeks in a year. So, her total hours worked per year is: 35 x 50 = 1750 hours/year. Then, we can multiply her hourly rate by this number to get her annual salary: 20 x 1750 = 35,000 dollars/year + 30 x 1750 = 52,500 dollars/year = 48,670 dollars/year."
"Response: 120 douzains of eggs (or 480 eggs)
Explanation:
Claire has an omelette made of 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. To calculate how many eggs she will consume in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of days in a week by the number of eggs per omelette and then multiply that result by the number of weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, each omelette contains 3 eggs, and there are 4 weeks in the given time period, Claire will eat 120 omelettes or 480 eggs during this time."
Response: 3 miles per hour.
"Response: 6 liters
Explanation: Let X be the amount of water in the orange juice initially (in liters). Since the orange juice is composed of two-thirds water and one-third orange juice, we can write:
X = 10/3 = 3.33 liters
Now, let Y be the amount of water in the pineapple juice initially (also in liters):
Y = 15/4 = 3.75 liters
When you mix the two juices, you add 1 liter of orange juice to the mixture, so the total volume of the mixed juice is:
V = X + Y + 1 = 3.33 + 3.75 + 1 = 8 liters
Since you want to know how much water is left in the 24 liters of mixed juice after adding 1 liter of orange juice, we can subtract the volume of the mixed juice from the total volume of the original juices:
Water remaining = Total volume - Volume of mixed juice = 24 - 8 = 16 liters
Therefore, there are 6 liters of water in the 24 liters of mixed juice."
Response: 5 years old.
"Response: 10 DVDs
Explanation: Let X be the number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday. Since 3 of his first 4 customers bought a DVD each, he has sold 3X DVDs initially. Then, in the next two groups of 2 customers each, they bought 2 DVDs each, so he sold an additional 2(2) = 4 DVDs. Finally, since the last three customers did not buy any DVDs, he sold no DVDs to them. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy is 3X + 4 = 10 DVDs."

"Response: 147
Explanation: Let X be the number of bonbons in the bowl. According to Gunter, his estimate is 80. His friend's estimate is 20 more than half of Gunter's estimate, so their estimate is (80 + 20) = 100. The third person estimates that there are 25% more bonbons than Gunter's estimate, which means they estimate 100 / 0.25 = 400 bonbons. Therefore, the average of their three estimates is (80 + 100 + 400) / 3 = 147."

"Response: 36
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Siobhan has 2 fewer bijoux than Aaron (so she has 48 - 2 = 46).
Aaron has 5 more bijoux than half of Raymond's bijoux (so he has 5 + (moitié x raymond) = 5 + (20 x 2/3) = 5 + 12 = 17).
Raymond has 40 bijoux.
So, Siobhan has 46 bijoux and Aaron has 17 bijoux."
"Response: 36 points
Explanation: During the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, which is 20% of the total possible points (20 x 10 = 200). Since he marked 25% more points during the next 20 minutes, he scored an additional 25/100 = 0.25 x 200 = 50 points. Therefore, Mike scored a total of 4 + 50 = 36 points."

"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Jean sold all of his Lego sets for an average price of $15 each and used the money he earned to buy 8 video games at $20 each. This means that he spent a total of $160 on video games ($20 x 8 = $160). Since he had 13 Lego sets initially, and he sold them all, he must have been left with 6 Lego sets ($160 / $15 per set = 6 sets)."
Response: 12 minutes per mile.
"Response: 48 miles
Explanation:
Dana runs four times faster than she walks, so her running speed is 4 times 3 = 12 miles per hour. Since she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking, she covers 12 x (2/3) + 3 = 48 miles in 6 hours."

"Response: 350$
Explanation:
Charlie produces 20 bougies using 10 books of beeswax (since each book allows him to produce 10 bougies). Therefore, he has produced 200 bougies in total (20 x 10 = 200). Since each bougie is sold for $2, Charlie has earned revenue of $400 ($2 x 200 bougies). Subtracting his cost of goods sold ($10 per book of beeswax), Charlie's gross profit is $390 ($400 - $10). Deducting his fixed costs ($10,000), Charlie's net profit is $350 ($390 - $10,000)."
"Response: 16 hours
Explanation: To calculate the number of hours spent writing articles during these three days, we need to use the information provided in the question.
Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Tuesday: 2/5 x 4 hours per article = 8 hours (since she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Monday)
Wednesday: 2 x 4 hours per article = 8 hours
Total hours spent writing articles = 20 + 8 + 8 = 16 hours."
"Response: 57
Explanation: Let X be the number of pense-bêtes in the pack that Candice bought. Since she had already put 80 pense-bêtes in her bag before going to work and placed one on each of the remaining 220 cups of coffee, there are 220 - 80 = 140 cups of coffee left after using all the pense-bêtes from the pack. Therefore, the number of pense-bêtes in the pack is 57 (since 140 / 2 = 70)."

"Response: 4 hours
Explanation: To find out how long it will take for Tom to return, we need to calculate the time taken during each leg of his journey. During the first leg (from 13h to 16h), Tom's boat moves at 10 miles per hour, so he covers a distance of 10 x 4 = 40 miles. During the second leg (return journey), Tom moves at 6 miles per hour, so he covers a distance of 6 x 4 = 24 miles. Therefore, it will take Tom 4 hours to return."
"Response: 60 toys.
Explanation:
Le sac d'Uriah pèse 15 livres (ou 6 kg). Pour réduire ce poids, il doit enlever une quantité de objets qui représente 1/4 de la masse du sac. En utilisant les informations données dans le problème, nous savons que chaque bande dessinée pèse 1/4 de livre et chaque jouet 1/2 de livre. Donc, si Uriah enlève 30 bandes dessinées, cela représentera 30 x 1/4 = 7,5 livres de poids supplémentaires qu'il doit enlever. De plus, s'il enlève 30 jouets, cela represente 30 x 1/2 = 15 livres de poids supplémentaires qu'il doit enlever. Ainsi, au total, Uriah doit enlever 7,5 + 15 = 22,5 pounds (ou 10 kg) de jouets pour réduire le poids de son sac à 15 livres."
"Response: 380$
Explanation:
On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 pneus of trucks and 4 pneus of cars, so he earned $6 x 6 = $360 for truck tires and $4 x 4 = $160 for car tires, in total $520.
On Friday, he repaired 12 pneus of cars but didn't repair any truck tires, so he earned $4 x 12 = $48 for car tires only, $0 for truck tires.
So, the highest amount of money the mechanic earned in one day is $520 (Thursday)."

"Response: 28 boîtes
Explanation: To determine how many boîtes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, we need to calculate the total weight of the load that the truck will carry. The weight of the truck itself is 3755 pounds (the sum of the driver and the empty truck). Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the total weight of the boxes is 15 x 28 = 420 pounds. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be carried by the truck without overloading the bridge is 420 / 15 = 28 boîtes."

"Response: 205 pierres précies. 
Explanation: The number of diamonds is given as 175, and there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, the total number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. Since two times the number of emeralds is equal to the number of rubies, the number of emeralds is 140 / 2 = 70. So, in total, there were 175 + 140 + 70 = 205 pierres précies in the coffre."
"Response: 12 professors
Explanation: Let X be the number of professors at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls in total, we can write:
X = (number of boys) / 2 = (2 \* 60) / 2 = 120 / 2 = 60
Since each professor teaches 5 students, there are 60 x 5 = 300 students in total. Therefore, the ratio of boys to girls is 2:1, so the number of boys is twice that of girls:
Boys = 2 \* Girls = 2 \* 60 = 120
So, there are 12 professors at Dr. Wertz's school."

Response: 9324$/year. Explanation: To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three years of additional service, we need to first determine her initial salary based on the policy stated in the question. According to the policy, each employee receives an additional 10% of their initial salary for every five years of service. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, her initial salary will be 600 x 1.1 = 660$. Then, over the next three years, she will receive an additional 10% of this amount, which is 660 x 1.1 x 3 = 1988$. Therefore, Sylvie's total annual salary after three years of additional service will be 660 + 1988 = 2648$.

"Response: 7 hours
Explanation: According to the question, Harry slept for 9 hours last night, and his friend Jacques only slept for 2/3 of that time. To find out how many more hours Harry slept than Jacques, we can multiply the difference between their sleep times by 3. So, if Jacques slept for 2/3 of 9 hours = 6 hours (since 9 x 2/3 = 6), then Harry slept for 9 - 6 = 3 additional hours."
"Response: 48 tomatoes
Explanation: Let X be the number of tomatoes used by Freda to make the sauce. Since each box contains 3 tomates and there are 5 boxes in total, the total number of tomatoes used is 3X = 3(48) = 144 tomatoes. However, since the last preparation of sauce resulted in 32 onces of sauce, we know that X = 48 (since 32/3 = 14). Therefore, Freda used 48 tomatoes to make the sauce."
"Response: 15
Explanation: Let X be the number of vehicles that passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes. Since some vehicles were able to move during this time, we can write:
X + 5 = 30 (since 5 vehicles left the line)
X + 20 = 45 (since 20 vehicles moved during the last 15 minutes)
Solving for X, we get:
X = 15
Therefore, 15 vehicles passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes."

"Response: 24 miles
Explanation: To find out how many miles Rosie will have covered in 7 hours, we need to calculate the total distance she covers during each hour of running and then add it up.
During the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, so she covers a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles.
After that, she reduces her speed to 5 miles per hour, which means she covers a distance of 5 x 7 = 35 miles.
Therefore, in total, Rosie will have covered 30 + 35 = 65 miles in 7 hours."
"Response: 90 letters.
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
* ""Jennie apporte une assistance au bureau de sa mère."" (This means that Jennie is helping her mother with some work.)
* ""Elle dispose d'une pile de 60 lettres à timbrer"" (This means that there are 60 letters to be stamped.)
* ""et d'une autre avec des lettres déjà timbrées"" (This means that there are already stamped letters in another pile.)
* ""elle tamponne un tiers des lettres à timbrer"" (This means that Jennie stamps one-third of the total number of letters to be stamped.)
Now, let's calculate the number of letters in the pile when Jennie started working:
Total number of letters = Number of letters to be stamped + Number of already stamped letters
= 60 + (Number of already stamped letters)
Since Jennie stamps one-third of the total number of letters to be stamped, the number of already stamped letters is:
Number of already stamped letters = Total number of letters x Third of total letters
= 90 letters
Therefore, when Jennie started working, there were 90 letters in the pile."

Response: 360$ 
Response: 37500 dollars per day. Explanation: The number of people seen at the hospital per day is given as 500. Each person is examined for an average of 24 minutes, so the total time spent by all patients being seen is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes per day. If each doctor charges $150 per hour and the hospital charges $200 per hour to patients, then the total revenue from these consultations is $150/hour x 12,000 minutes = $180,000 per day. Therefore, the profit made by the hospital is $180,000 - $200,000 = $375,000 per day.

Explanation: If Marc took 8 hours to complete the first test of 75 questions and 6 hours to complete the second test of 100 questions, then he completed the second test in 6/8 = 3/4ths of the time it took him to complete the first test. Therefore, if he answered 5 questions per hour for the second test, he left 3/4 \* 5 = 3.75 questions without answers. Since we cannot have a fraction of a question remaining, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 25 questions."
"Response: 36
Explanation: Let B be the number of boules of gummies blue and R be the number of boules of gummies red. According to the problem, BR = 22, so we can write:
R = (22/B) × 12
Now, we have two equations:
B = 12 / (22/B) = 4
Substituting this in the first equation, we get:
R = (22/4) × 12 = 36
Therefore, there are 36 boules of gummies red in the dispenser."

Response: 1400 abeilles ouvrières. Explanation: Let X be the number of worker bees. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can write: X = 2Y, where Y is the number of baby bees. And since there are also twice as many baby bees as queen bees, we can write: Y = 2Z, where Z is the number of queen bees. Substituting these equations into each other, we get: X = 2(2Z) = 4Z. So, there are 4 times as many worker bees as queen bees, or 1400 worker bees in total.

"Response: 15 minutes
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steve will arrive at home first if he takes his bike. Since Steve lives 3 miles away from school and can pedal at 440 feet per minute, it means that he covers a distance of 3 x 440 = 1270 feet per minute. Therefore, it will take him 1270 / 264 = 4.8 minutes to reach home. On the other hand, since Tim lives only 2 miles away from school and can travel at a speed of 264 feet per minute on his skateboard, it will take him only 2 x 264 = 528 feet per minute to reach home. This means that Tim will arrive home after Steve by 4.8 - 5.2 = 0.6 minutes. So, Steve will wait for 0.6 minutes before Tim arrives home."

Explanation:
To find the total length of all the products put together, we need to multiply their individual lengths by the number of each product that Bill prepares every day.
For the small bread rolls, which are 4 inches long, the total length is 4 x 300 = 1200 inches or 9.8 feet (or 2.97 meters).
For the croissants, which are 6 inches long, the total length is 6 x 120 = 720 inches or 6 feet (or 1.83 meters).
And for the baguettes, which are 2 feet long, the total length is 2 x 60 = 120 feet or 36 meters.
Adding up these values gives us a total length of 120 + 720 + 120 = 1020 feet or 30.9 meters."

Explanation: To calculate the amount that Mandy must give to Benedict at the end of 3 months, we need to use the formula for calculating the total amount due with an interest rate and a time period. The formula is: Total Amount Due = Principal + Interest x Time Period. In this case, the principal is $100 (the initial debt), the interest rate is 2% per month, and the time period is 3 months. Therefore, the total amount due is: Total Amount Due = $100 + ($100 x 2%) x 3 = $104."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let X be the number of sacs sold by the merchant. Since each sac costs $20 to buy from the farmer and $2 to transport, the revenue from selling one sac is $30 - $2 = $28. The profit from selling one sac is $400 - $28 = $372. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
X(30 - 2) + 2 = 372
Simplifying this equation, we get:
X = 16
So, the merchant has sold 16 sacs of wheat."

* After 4 weeks, he reduced the number of times he rides to twice a week, but increased the distance he covers each time by 50%. So now he does 2 x 60 = 120 km per week.
* He continued this pattern for another 3 weeks, so he covered a total distance of 120 km + (3 x 120) = 170 km.
Therefore, the total distance Michael has traveled is 170 km."

"Response: 16
Explanation: Let R be the number of red birds and W be the number of white birds. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we know that R + W = 42 (since there are more white birds than red). We also know that each red bird lays 3 eggs/day, so R x 3 = 2R (since there are twice as many red birds as white). Substituting this into our first equation gives us 2R + W = 42. Now, since there are two more white birds than red, we have W > R. Solving for R, we get R = 8. Therefore, Jerry has 8 red birds."

Explanation: Let X be the quantity of water in the small pool initially. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool initially, the amount of water in the big pool was 2X. After 4 minutes, the amount of water in the big pool increased by 4 times the initial amount, so it is now (2X) × 4 = 8X. The amount of water in the small pool decreased by 4 times the initial amount, so it is now X - 4(X) = -3X. Therefore, the current quantity of water in the small pool is 2 gallons."
"Response: 41 hours
Explanation: To determine how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford her purchases, we need to calculate her total income from working at her part-time job. Her hourly wage is $8, so if she works for x number of hours, her total earnings will be $x \times 8 = 8x. We are given that the cost of the shoes is $320 and the belt is $32, so together they cost $352. Therefore, Lori needs to work enough hours to earn at least $352 / $8 = 45 hours. Since you cannot divide by zero, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 41 hours."

"Response: 39
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Naomi has scored 68 points.
* Yuri has scored 10 points more than half of Naomi's score, which means Yuri has scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.
* Brianna has scored 17 points more than Naomi, which means Brianna has scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
* Jojo has scored fewer points than any of the other three students (Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna). Therefore, Jojo has scored 39 points or less.

So, the total number of points scored by all five students is:
68 + 78 + 85 + 39 = 280

Therefore, Jojo has scored 280 - 39 = 241 points."

Response: 240 liters. Explanation: Initially, there were 120 liters of water in the reservoir. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, leaving 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30). Then, two times more rainwater entered the reservoir, which is equal to 2 x 30 = 60 liters. Therefore, the current amount of water in the reservoir is 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

Response: 22 500 dollars. Explanation: The first year, the company spent $15,000 on advertising, and in the second year, it spent one-third of that amount, or $5,000. Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising over both years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.
Response: 72 dollars. Explanation: To calculate the total amount of their rentals, we need to multiply the time they used each boat by its hourly rate. For Carlos, he used the canoe for 3 hours at $30/hour = $90. For Benji, he used the banana boat for 5 hours at $18/hour = $90. Therefore, the total amount of their rentals is $90 + $90 = $180 or $180 dollars.
Response: 3 days.
"Response: 50%
Explanation: If James loses 8 cards of type water and acquires 14 cards of type herb, his total number of cards of each type will be:

* Type Fire: 30
* Type Herb: 34 (20 + 14)
* Type Water: 22 (40 - 8)

Since he now has more cards of type herb than any other type, there is a 50% chance that a card chosen at random from his deck will be of type herb."

"Response: 90 minutes
Explanation:
Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, so she will need 360/4 = 90 minutes to complete the puzzle by herself. Since her mother can only place 2 pieces per minute, it will take them twice as long to finish the puzzle together. Therefore, they will need 90 x 2 = 180 minutes to complete the puzzle."
"Response: 40
Explanation:
Ashlyn visited the farm after two months and found that 30% of the peppers were ready to be harvested. She then picked 30% of them (i.e., 30 out of 100) and brought them back home. Two weeks later, when she returned to the farm, 75% of the remaining peppers were ready to be harvested. This means that 25% of the original number of peppers (i.e., 25 out of 100) were not yet ready for harvesting after those two weeks. Therefore, there were 40 peppers that were not yet ready for harvesting."
"Response: 240 000$. 
Explanation: To calculate the total cost of the fleet of cars, we need to consider two components: the purchase price and the registration fee. The purchase price is 20 000$ per car, so the total cost for 12 cars is 240 000$: (12 x 20 000$). Additionally, there is a 10% tax on the purchase price, which adds another 24 000$(=20 000 x 10%). Finally, there is an additional 1 000$ registration fee for each car, bringing the total cost to 264 000$."
"Response: 16
Explanation: On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more coquills than Robert, so she collected 5 + 20 = 25 coquills. On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many coquills as she collected on Monday, so she collected 2 \* 25 = 50 coquills."
Response: 100 insectes. Explanation: According to the passage, there were twice as many insects as fourmis in the garden. Since there are 50 fourmis, the number of insects is twice that amount, or 100.
"Response: 24
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:
* ""Il y a 36 pingouins"" means there are 36 pingouins in total.
* ""qui prennent un bain de soleil dans la neige"" means that all of the pingouins are taking a sun bath in the snow.
* ""Un tiers d'entre eux plongent et nagent dans l'océan."" means that one-third of the pingouins (12) plunge and swim in the ocean.
* ""Un autre tiers va à l'intérieur de la grotte pour y manger son dîner."" means that another third of the pingouins (12) go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

So, out of the original 36 pingouins, 24 continue to take the sun bath (since 36 - 12 = 24)."
"Response: 20 vines
Explanation: To determine how many vines Steve will need to grow in order to produce enough tomatoes for him and his wife to eat, we can use the information provided in the problem. The problem states that Steve wants to eat twice as many tomatoes as his wife (i.e., he wants to eat 6 tomatoes per day instead of her 3). Therefore, if Steve grows one vine, he will be able to produce 3 tomatoes per week (since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week). Since Steve wants to eat 6 tomatoes per day, he will need 20 vines (i.e., 6 tomatoes/day / 3 tomatoes/week = 20 vines) to meet his daily demand."
Response: 5 pizzas.
Response: 100 stylos. Explanation: According to the question, if Ram can save money by mixing the ink of five empty pens to make one full pen, and he buys 25 pens to use for this purpose, then he will obtain 25 x 5 = 125 pens in total. However, since each pen contains enough ink to fill one pen, Ram will actually end up with 125 full pens, or 100 stylos.
"Response: 30 $

"Response: 400
Explanation: Let X be the number of students who took exit C. Since 70% of the students did not take exit C (X is 30% of 1000), we can write:
X = 700
So, 400 students took exit C."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jacques has 6 more bonbons than Robert. This means that Jacques has x bonbons and Robert has x - 6 bonbons.
Jean has twice as many bonbons as Robert, which means that Jean has 2x bonbons.
The total number of bonbons that Jean has is 54, so we can write the equation:
x + (x - 6) = 54
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 54
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 27
So, Jacques has 30 bonbons more than Jacques."

"Response: 6
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Griffin had 24 fries initially.
* Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. (So Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries)
* Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means he took 10 fries (since 2 x 5 = 10). So now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
* Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave him. For simplicity, let's assume it was an even number, say 6 fries. So now Griffin has 9 + 6 = 15 fries.
* Colby took 3 fries less than what Kyle took. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took 2 fries fewer, or 3 fries. So now Griffin has 15 - 3 = 12 fries left.
* Finally, the question states that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. This must be because Ginger gave him an additional 6 fries, bringing his total to 27.

Therefore, the answer is 6."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let X be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is equal to twice the sum of the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write:

Number of snails in first aquarium = 4X
Number of snails in second aquarium = 32 - (2(number of fish in first aquarium))

Now, we are given that the number of fish in the first aquarium is equal to the number of fish in the second aquarium, so we can substitute this value into one of the equations above:

Number of snails in first aquarium = 4X
Number of snails in second aquarium = 32 - (2(X))

Solving for X, we get:

X = 16

Therefore, there are 16 fish in each aquarium."
