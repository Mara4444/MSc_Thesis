"Response:  To calculate how much Janet earns in dollars each day at the farmer's market, we need to know how many eggs she sells and at what price. Let's assume that she sells all 16 eggs daily. She sells three eggs for breakfast and four eggs for baking kolači (kolac) every day, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left for sale at the farmer's market. At $2 per fresh egg, her daily income from egg sales would be:  
13 x $2 = $26  
Therefore, Janet earns $26 per day at the farmer's market."
Response:  To make one complete shirt, you will need 3/2 = 1 and a half times as many blue stripes as white stripes. Since each blue stripe requires 2 threads of blue yarn and each white stripe requires 1 thread of white yarn, you will need a total of 2 x 3 (since there are three blue stripes) + 1 x 2 (since there is only one white stripe) = 6 threads of blue yarn and 2 threads of white yarn. Therefore, you will need a total of 8 threads of yarn to make one complete shirt.
"Response:  If Josh bought the house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs, then he increased the value of the house by 150%, which means that the new value of the house is:

$80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000

So, Josh has made a profit of $40,000 ($120,000 - $80,000)."
Response:  To calculate how many meters James runs weekly, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does per week (3) by the distance of each sprint (60 meters). Therefore, James runs 3 x 60 = 180 meters per week.
Response:  To determine how many shaloches of food Wendi should give to her chickens in the last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of food she gives to her chickens daily and then divide it by the number of chickens she has. Let's break down the information given in the question:  * Wendi gives each of her chickens three bowls of mixed feed per day (3 x 20 = 60 bowls/day)  * Each bowl contains seeds, worms, and vegetables (let's assume an average weight of 500g per bowl)  * In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 bowls of food (15 x 500g = 7500g)  * In the afternoon, Wendi gives her chickens another 25 bowls of food (25 x 500g = 12500g) Total amount of food given to the chickens per day: 7500g + 12500g = 20000g Now, let's divide the total amount of food by the number of chickens: 20000g / 20 chickens = 1000g per chicken So, Wendi should give each of her chickens 1000g of food in the last meal of the day.
"Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for the 16 cups, we need to calculate the total cost of all the cups he wants to buy. Since each cup costs $5 except for every second cup which costs 60% of the previous cup's price, we can use the following steps to calculate the total cost:  
Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first cup: 1 x $5 = $5  
Step 2: Calculate the cost of the second cup (every second cup is discounted by 60%): 2 x $5 x 60% = $5 x 40% = $2  
Step 3: Add the costs of the first two cups: $5 + $2 = $7  
Step 4: Repeat step 2 and 3 for the remaining cups: $7 + ($5 x 40%) = $7 + $2 = $9 $9 + ($5 x 40%) = $9 + $2 = $11... and so on until the last cup.  
Therefore, the total cost of 16 cups would be: $7 + $9 + $11 +... + $5 x 40% (16 times) = $7 + $9 + $11 +... + $80 = $105."
Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: 1) Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. 2) Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. 3) Seattle has 20 sheep. We can use this information to find out how many sheep each city has:  Toulouse: 2 x (number of sheep in Charleston) = 2 x 4 = 8 sheep Charleston: 4 x (number of sheep in Seattle) = 4 x 20 = 80 sheep Seattle: 20 sheep Now we need to add up all the sheep to get the total number of sheep for all three cities: Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 8 + 80 + 20 = 108 sheep So there are 108 sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together.
Response:  To calculate how much time it will take to download the 200 GB file, we need to know the speed at which the file is being downloaded and the amount of time that is spent on installing updates during each restart. Let's assume that the installation of updates takes 20 minutes every time the computer restarts. We can use the formula d = rt, where d is the total time taken to download the file, r is the rate at which the file is being downloaded (in this case, 2 GB/min), and t is the time taken for each restart (20 minutes). Since the file size is 200 GB, we can calculate the total time taken to download the file as follows: d = 200,000,000,000 / (2 x 60) = approximately 133 hours or about 5.4 days.
"Response:  To find out how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate his average speed for the last 4 hours. Let's call this average speed ""x"" miles per hour. We know that he drove the first two hours at 30 miles per hour and the remaining 2 hours at 80 miles per hour. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

(30 x 2) + (80 x 2) = 4(x)

Simplifying the equation:

60 + 160 = 4x

Solving for ""x"":

220 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4:

55 = x

So, John's average speed for the last 4 hours was 55 miles per hour. Now, we can use this information to find out how far he traveled during those 4 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 55 x 4
= 220 miles

Therefore, John is 220 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
Response:  To calculate Eliza's weekly earnings, we need to first calculate her regular hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours she worked. Since she works 45 hours this week, we can calculate her regular hourly wage as follows: Regular hourly wage = $10/hour x 40 hours (first 40 hours) + $10/hour x 5 hours (additional 5 hours) = $400 + $50 = $450 Now, we need to calculate her overtime pay for the additional 5 hours she worked beyond 40 hours. Overtime pay = $10/hour x 5 hours = $500 Therefore, Eliza's total weekly earnings are: Total weekly earnings = Regular hourly wage + Overtime pay = $450 + $500 = $950
Response:  To find out how many downloads there were in three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads in each month and then add them up. Let's start by analyzing the information given:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads.  In the second month, there were three times as many downloads as in the first month, so there were 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.  In the third month, there were 30% fewer downloads than in the second month, so there were 180 - (180 x 0.3) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.  Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.
"Response:  To calculate the total cost of the pastries purchased by Toula, we need to multiply the number of each type of pastry by its price per unit and then add up all the costs. Let's do this step by step:  
1. Calculate the cost of 3 trays of croissants at $68 per tray: 3 x $68 = $204  
2. Calculate the cost of 2 trays of mini muffins at $80 per tray: 2 x $80 = $160  
3. Calculate the cost of 6 trays of mini muffins with cheese at $55 per tray: 6 x $55 = $330  
Now, let's add up all the costs: $204 + $160 + $330 = $794 So, the total cost of the pastries purchased by Toula is $794."
Response:  To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the following factors: 1) Initial investment (cost of planting and maintaining the tree), 2) Annual revenue from selling lemons, and 3) Life expectancy of the tree.  Let's assume that the initial investment is $90 (as mentioned in the problem statement). The annual revenue from selling 7 lemons per year at $1.5 per piece is: 7 x $1.5 = $10.50 per year. The life expectancy of a lemon tree is approximately 5-6 years. Therefore, to calculate the break-even point, we can use the formula: Break-Even Point = Initial Investment / Annual Revenue. Substituting the values, we get: Break-Even Point = $90 / $10.50 = 8.5 years. This means that Carlos will have to wait for around 8.5 years before he starts earning a profit from his lemon tree.
Response:  If Melanie started with 5 usisivača and sold one-third of them in the green house, two in the red house, and half of what was left in the orange house, then she had 5 - (1/3) = 5 - 2 = 3 usisivača left at the beginning.
"Response:  To find out how many percent of all students are enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.  So, if there are 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance out of a total of 200 students (20 + 25 + 20 = 200), then the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:  
(20/200) x 100 = 10%."
"Response:  To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the plan with the higher percentage increase in value. In this case, the value of the jewelry is expected to increase by 2.5%, while the value of the electronics will increase by 1.2%. Therefore, if the merchant chooses the $5,000 worth of jewelry, their potential profit at the end of the month would be:  
$5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125  
While if they choose the $8,000 worth of electronics, their potential profit at the end of the month would be:  
$8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096  
Therefore, the merchant should choose the $5,000 worth of jewelry to maximize their potential profit."
"Response:  The distance traveled by each train in two days can be calculated as follows:  
Day 1 (westward journey):  
Train A travels 80 miles west = 80 miles  
Train B travels 80 miles west = 80 miles  
Total distance traveled by both trains on Day 1 = 80 + 80 = 160 miles  
Day 2 (northward journey):  
Train A travels 240 kilometers north = 240 km  
Train B travels 240 kilometers north = 240 km  
Total distance traveled by both trains on Day 2 = 240 + 240 = 480 km  
Therefore, the total distance traveled by each train in two days is:  
Train A: 160 + 480 = 640 km  
Train B: 160 + 480 = 640 km"
"Response:  To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to first determine her hourly wage for each job and then multiply that by the number of hours she works per week.  For her job as an instructor, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours per week, so her weekly earnings are:  
$20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week  For her job as a cheerleading coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours per week, so her weekly earnings are:  
$30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week  Since Jill works 50 weeks per year (50 weeks x $700/week + 50 weeks x $450/week), her total annual earnings are:  
$700/week x 50 weeks = $35,000 + $450/week x 50 weeks = $22,500 = $57,500/year"
Response:  Claire will eat 12 eggs (3 x 4 weeks) during the 4-week period.
Response:  To find out what speed Marissa needs to maintain for the remaining distance of 8 miles in order to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile course, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the total distance, r is the rate (speed), and t is the time taken. Since she took one hour to cover the first 4 miles at a constant speed, her average speed over that portion of the race was also 4 miles per hour. Therefore, we know that she covered the first 4 miles in 1 hour, so we can write: 4 miles/hour x 1 hour = 4 miles. Now, we need to find out how long it took her to cover the next 2 miles, since she took another hour to cover those 2 miles. So, we can write: 2 miles / 4 miles/hour = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes. Therefore, Marissa spent 30 minutes covering the last 2 miles, which means she had to walk at a speed of: 2 miles / 0.5 hours = 4 miles/hour. Thus, her overall average speed for the entire 12-mile course would be: (4 miles + 4 miles)/2 = 4 miles/hour.

"Response:  Let's denote the cost of one pair of high socks as x and the cost of one pair of shoes as y. We know that the total cost of both pairs of socks is 33 dollars, so we can write an equation:  
x + 2x = 33... (1) Now, we are given that the cost of two pairs of socks is five dollars less than the cost of one pair of shoes, so we can write another equation:  
2x + 2y - 5 = y... (2) Solving equation (1) for x, we get:  
x = 16.50... (3) Substituting this value into equation (2), we get:  
2(16.50) + 2y - 5 = y... (4) Simplifying and solving for y, we get:  
y = 29.75... (5) Therefore, the cost of the shoes is 29.75 dollars."
Response:  If Darrel is 7 times as old as Allen and their combined age is 162 years, then Allen's age is 162/7 = 23 years. Therefore, Allen will be 23 + 10 = 33 years old in 10 years.
"Response:  To find the average of their guesses, we need to add all three numbers and divide by 3. So, we have:  
80 + (20 + 1/2(80)) + (25% + 1/4(80)) = 80 + 20 + 25 + 20 = 245  
Now, let's divide by 3:

So, the average of their guesses is approximately 81.67."
Response:  If John spends 10 minutes each day taking care of his dogs and needs to spend half an hour per day doing so, then he spends 5 hours per week (30 minutes x 7 days = 5 hours) caring for his dogs.
"Response:  Gretchen has 110 novčića and 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's say she has x silver coins. Then, she has 30 + x gold coins. We know that the total number of coins is 110. So we can set up the equation:

x + (30 + x) = 110

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing by 2:

x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 30 + 40 = 70 gold coins."
Response:  If Raymond has 40 dragulja and Aaron has five more than half of Raymond's dragulja, then Aaron has 5 + (1/2) \* 40 = 5 + 20 = 25 dragulja. Since Siobhan has two fewer dragulja than Aaron, she has 25 - 2 = 23 dragulja.
"Response:  To find out how many points Mike scored in total, we need to calculate his score for each of the two periods and then add them up. For the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points, so:  
Mike's score for first 20 minutes = 4 points  
For the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than the previous period, which means he scored:  
Mike's score for second 20 minutes = (4 x 1.25) = 5 points  
Now, let's add up Mike's scores for both periods:  
Total points scored by Mike = 4 + 5 = 9 points"

Response:  If John has $5 left after buying 8 video games at $20 each and he sold all his Lego sets for $15 each, then he must have had 5 x 15 = 75 dollars from the sale of Lego sets. So, he spent 8 x 20 = 160 dollars on video games, leaving him with 75 - 160 = -5 dollars. Therefore, John has no more Lego sets left.
"Response:  To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed for each day and then add them up. Let's start by calculating his daily distances:  
Day 1: 3 hours x 5 km/hour = 15 km Day 2: 1.5 hours x 5 km/hour = 7.5 km Day 3: 1.5 hours x 5 km/hour = 7.5 km Total distance per week: 15 km + 7.5 km + 7.5 km = 30 km Now let's calculate his average speed for each day:  
Day 1: 15 km / 3 hours = 5 km/hour Day 2: 7.5 km / 1.5 hours = 5 km/hour Day 3: 7.5 km / 1.5 hours = 5 km/hour Average speed per week: (5 km/hour x 3 days) + (5 km/hour x 2 days) = (15 km/day x 3 days) + (7.5 km/day x 2 days) = 45 km/week So, John runs at an average speed of 45 km/week or 6.42 km/hour."
"Response:  To find out how many miles Dana can cover in 6 hours if she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking, we need to first determine how far she can run in one hour. We know that she can run at a speed of 4 times her walking speed, so her running speed is 4 x 2 = 8 miles per hour. Since she can run for one-third of the time, she will cover:

8 miles/hour x 1/3 = 2.67 miles

in one hour while running. Therefore, she will cover:

2.67 miles x 6 hours = 15.62 miles

in total during the 6 hours. However, since she also walks for two-thirds of the time, she will cover:

2 miles/hour x 2/3 = 1.33 miles

in one hour while walking. Therefore, she will cover:

1.33 miles x 6 hours = 7.98 miles

in total during the 6 hours. So, Dana can cover a total distance of 15.62 + 7.98 = 23.60 miles in 6 hours if she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking."
Response:  If Suzy is one year old and Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is two years older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, if Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, then Brandon's iPhone is eight years older than Suzy's iPhone. So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 + 2 = 10 years old.
Response:  To determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon while still hitting it with her golden spear, we need to find the maximum distance at which she can throw the spear when holding the sapphire and compare it to the range of the dragon's flames. Let's start by calculating the distance Polly can throw the spear without the sapphire:  With no stone, Polly can throw the spear 400 feet (120 meters). Now let's calculate the distance Polly can throw the spear with the sapphire:  With the sapphire, Polly can throw the spear three times farther than normal, so she can throw it 1200 feet (365 meters) in total. However, since the dragon's flames only reach 300 meters, Polly must be able to throw the spear at least that far beyond the edge of the flames to hit the dragon. Therefore, the minimum distance Polly needs to stand from the dragon is:   Minimum distance = 1200 - 300 = 900 feet (274 meters) So, if Polly holds the sapphire, she can stand up to 900 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with her golden spear.
"Response:  To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces (14) from the total number of pieces that were cut (5 x 8 = 40). Therefore, the answer is:  
40 - 14 = 26  
So, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests."
Response:  To determine how many grams of chips you can eat while staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories and having already consumed 1800 calories, we need to calculate the number of calories left in your daily budget. We know that one serving of chips (50g) contains 250 calories, so if you have 5 servings (5 x 250 = 1250 calories), you would have used up 1250/2000 = 62.5% of your daily calorie budget. Therefore, you could consume 2000 - 1250 = 750 calories worth of chips. Since each serving contains 250 calories, you could eat 750 / 250 = 3 servings or 3 x 50g = 150g of chips.
"Response:  To find Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of producing and selling them first. The cost of one kilogram of beeswax is $10, so the cost of 20 candles (since each candle requires 10 grams of wax) would be:  

$10 x 20 = $200  

The revenue from selling 20 candles at $2 each would be:  

$2 x 20 = $40  

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the revenue to get the net profit:  

$40 - $200 = $-160  

So, Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles would be negative $160."
Response:  To calculate the total number of hours that Meredith spent writing blog posts in three days, we need to know how many hours she spent writing each day and then add them up. Let's break down the information given in the question:  Monday: 5 blog posts x 4 hours per post = 20 hours  Tuesday: 2/5 more posts than Monday x 4 hours per post = 8 hours (2/5 x 4) + 20 hours = 36 hours Wednesday: 2 times as much as Tuesday x 4 hours per post = 12 hours (2 x 8) + 36 hours = 52 hours Total hours spent writing blog posts in three days: 20 + 36 + 52 = 108 hours Therefore, Meredith spent 108 hours writing blog posts over the course of three days.
"Response:  There were 23 post-it notes remaining after Candice placed one on each of the 220 different cups of coffee at work. To determine how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice bought, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  
Let x be the number of post-it notes in the package. Since Candice had 23 post-it notes remaining, she must have used some of them to decorate the cups of coffee:  
23 = (x - 80)... (1)  
We know that Candice purchased 80 post-it notes in total, since she had 80 left over and she used some of them to decorate the cups of coffee:  
80 = x... (2)  
Now we can solve for x by substituting equation (1) into equation (2):  
80 = x - 23  
Solving for x, we get:  
x = 103  
Therefore, there were 103 post-it notes in the package that Candice bought."
"Response:  To find out how much John spent on kravates, we need to calculate the cost of the blue ones first. Since he bought 200 dollars worth of blue shirts at $40 per piece, the total cost is:  

$40 x 200 = $8,000  
Since red ties are 50% more expensive than blue ties, the cost of the red ties will be:  

$8,000 x 1.5 = $12,000  
Therefore, John spent $12,000 on kravates."
Response:  Tracy received 3 pieces of wire (since 4 x 15 = 60 and 60 / 15 = 3).
Response:  There are 12 floors (15 - 3) and each floor has 8 units, so there are 12 x 8 = 96 units in total. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, there are 96 x 0.75 = 72 vacant units.
"Response:  To calculate how much Lloyd earns from eggs per week, we need to multiply the number of eggs he sells per day by the number of days in a week. Let's assume there are 7 days in a week.  

Number of eggs sold per day = 252 eggs/day  
Number of days in a week = 7 days/week  
Total number of eggs sold per week = Number of eggs sold per day x Number of days in a week  
= 252 eggs/day x 7 days/week  
= 1,764 eggs/week  
Price per egg = $2/egg  
Total revenue per week = Total number of eggs sold per week x Price per egg  
= 1,764 eggs/week x $2/egg  
= $3,528/week"
Response:  To calculate how long it will take for Tom to return, we need to know his speed and the distance he needs to cover. We are given that he travels at a speed of 6 km/h during the return journey. The distance he needs to cover is the total distance he traveled during the day (i.e., 10 miles x 2 = 20 kilometers). Therefore, the time it will take for Tom to return is: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 20 km / 6 km/h Time = 3 hours So, Tom will take 3 hours to return.
Response:  If Uriah wants to reduce the weight of his book bag by 15 pounds and each strip weighs half a kilogram, then he needs to remove 30 strips (since 30 x 0.5 = 15). Therefore, he needs to remove 30/2 = 15 game books as well.
"Response:  To find out which day had a higher income for the mechanic, we need to calculate the total amount earned from both days and compare them. Let's start by calculating the total amount earned for each day:

Day 1 (Thursday):

* 6 x $60 = $360 (for repairing 6 truck tires)
* 4 x $40 = $160 (for repairing 4 car tires)

Total earnings for Day 1: $520

Day 2 (Friday):

* 12 x $40 = $480 (for repairing 12 car tires)

Total earnings for Day 2: $480

Now let's compare the total earnings for each day:

$520 (Day 1) > $480 (Day 2)

Response:  To determine how far Sophia can drive with one tank of gasoline, we need to divide the amount of fuel she has (40 liters) by the number of kilometers she can travel per liter of fuel. According to the problem, Sophia's car uses 4 gallons of gasoline for every 32 miles driven, so we can calculate her fuel consumption as follows: Fuel Consumption = 4 gallons / 32 miles = 0.125 gallons/mile Now, let's convert this value into kilometers per liter: Kilometers Per Liter = 0.125 gallons/mile x 1000 meters/liter = 125 kilometers/liter Since Sophia has 40 liters of fuel, we can calculate how far she can drive as follows: Total Distance = Number of Liters x Kilometers Per Liter Total Distance = 40 liters x 125 kilometers/liter = 5000 kilometers Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 5000 kilometers (3107 miles) with one tank of gasoline.

Response:  To calculate how much money Tommy will collect from selling kolača and kolača od sira, we need to multiply the number of items sold by their price. For kolača, the price is $3 each, so if Tommy sells 43 kolača, he will collect:  43 x $3 = $130 For kolača od sira, the price is $4 each, so if Tommy sells 23 pieces, he will collect:  23 x $4 = $92 Therefore, Tommy will collect in total: $130 + $92 = $222
Response:  To calculate the monthly payment for each mobile phone, we need to use the formula for the present value of a series of payments with a fixed interest rate and a finite number of periods. Let's assume that the monthly payment for each phone is $x. Then, the total cost of all five phones is $5 x 150 = $750. The interest rate is 2%, so the annual interest rate is 2/12 = 0.067. Since there are three months in this case, we can calculate the monthly interest as follows: Monthly interest = Annual interest x Number of periods / 12 Monthly interest = 0.067 x 3 / 12 = 0.0222 So, the total amount paid over three months is: Total amount = Initial investment + (Number of periods x Monthly interest) Total amount = $750 + ($3 x $0.0222) = $750 + $0.666 = $816.60 Therefore, Sheila will have to pay $816.60 for all five mobile phones over three months.
"Response:  To calculate how much Artie will earn from selling his flowers, we need to first find out how much each type of flower costs in dollars per unit (lonic). We can do this by dividing the cost per unit by the number of units sold. For example, if Artie sells 12 units of nalivnice at $2.74 per unit, he will earn:  

$2.74/unit x 12 units = $33.08 for nalivnice

Similarly, if he sells 9 units of petunija at $1.87 per unit, he will earn:  

$1.87/unit x 9 units = $16.83 for petunija

And if he sells 17 units of begonija at $2.12 per unit, he will earn:  

$2.12/unit x 17 units = $35.64 for begonija

Now that we have found out how much Artie will earn from each type of flower, we can add up all these amounts to get the total amount he will earn today:  

$33.08 + $16.83 + $35.64 = $85.55

Therefore, Artie will earn a total of $85.55 today from selling his flowers."

"Response:  To determine how many vials of food for dogs Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the number of days she needs to feed her puppy and then divide that by the number of servings per day. There are 365 days in a year, so:  

Number of days to feed puppy = 180 (as recommended by the veterinarian) + 365 (remaining days in the year) = 545 days  

Number of servings per day = 1 (for the first 180 days) + 2 (for the remaining 365 days) = 3 servings per day  

Total number of servings needed in the first year = Number of days to feed puppy x Number of servings per day = 545 x 3 = 1635 servings  

Since one vial of dog food contains 110 servings, Cecilia will need:  

Number of vials needed in the first year = Total number of servings needed / Number of servings per vial = 1635 / 110 = 14.8 vials  

Therefore, Cecilia will need approximately 15 vials of dog food in the first year."

Response:  To find out how much money will be saved by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the total cost of 18 flowers at both prices and compare them. Let's do that!  Price per flower (pack of 3): $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per flower Price per flower (pack of 2): $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per flower Now, let's calculate the total cost of 18 flowers at each price: Pack of 3: 18 x $0.83 = $14.64 Pack of 2: 18 x $0.50 = $9.00 Since the total cost of 18 flowers at the better price is $9.00, and the total cost at the other price is $14.64, the difference in cost is: $14.64 - $9.00 = $5.64 So, by buying 18 flowers at the better price, Vincent will save $5.64.
"Response:  To find out how much it would cost for John to have his dog groomed with a 30% discount, we can use the following calculation:

Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:  - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey.  - James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey. We can start by finding out how old Amy is:  Age of Amy = 5 + 2 = 7 years old Now we know that Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy:  Age of Jackson = Amy's age - 5 = 7 - 5 = 2 years old Therefore, Jackson is 2 years old.
Response:  To find out how fast Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles, we need to use the information that Lee could run it in 38 seconds before changing his diet and that Gerald improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet. We can set up an equation based on this information as follows: Let L be the time it takes Lee to run 400 meters with obstacles (in seconds) L = 38 Let G be the time it takes Gerald to run 400 meters with obstacles (in seconds) G =? Since Gerald's speed increased by 10%, we know that G = L x 1.10 We can substitute the value of L into this equation to get: G = 38 x 1.10 = 41.8 So Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 41.8 seconds.
Response:  To find out how many household pets there are in the neighborhood, we need to use the information that there are 12 times fewer hamsters than dogs and cats combined, and that there are 60 dogs. So, if there are x dogs and y cats, then there are 60 / (x + y) hamsters. Since there are two cats for each dog, we can write this as 60 / (x + 2y). Solving for x and y gives us x = 30 and y = 15, so there are 30 dogs, 15 cats, and 720 hamsters in the neighborhood.
Response:  There are 40 djevojčica in the fifth grade class, and two-thirds of them (i.e., 2/3 x 40 = 26) are not in the scouts. Therefore, there are 14 djevojčica (40 - 26) who are not in the scouts.

Therefore, Harry has slept 3 more hours than James."
"Response:  To find out how many bell peppers Freda used, we need to divide the volume of the umac by the volume of one bell pepper. We know that each bell pepper contains three paradajz, so we can multiply the number of bell peppers by three to get the total number of paradajz used. Let's start with the calculation:

Volume of umac = 32 unces (from the problem)

Volume of one bell pepper = 1/4 cup (since 4 cups of chopped bell peppers make 1 cup of umac)

Therefore, the number of bell peppers needed to make 32 unces of umac is:

32 unces / 1/4 cup per bell pepper = 128 bell peppers

Since each bell pepper has three paradajz, the total number of paradajz used in the umac is:

128 bell peppers x 3 paradajz per bell pepper = 384 paradajz

So, Freda used 384 paradajz to make her last series of umac."

Response:  To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to know how many days he works and how many glasses he drinks per day. Let's assume that John works 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). He drinks 3 glasses of water during breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day, which adds up to 15 glasses of water per week (3 x 5 = 15). However, on weekends, John prefers to relax and only drinks 2 glasses of sparkling water for dinner, so his total number of glasses of water consumed per week is 17 (15 + 2).
Response:  To calculate how many minutes it will take for the fog to cover the entire city, we need to divide the distance of the city by the speed at which the fog is moving. Let's assume that the fog moves at a constant speed of 5 kilometers per minute (as mentioned in the problem). The length of the city is given as 42 miles or 68 kilometers. Therefore, we can calculate the time required for the fog to cover the entire city as follows: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 68 km / 5 km/minute Time = 13.6 minutes So, it will take approximately 13.6 minutes for the fog to cover the entire city.

Response:  To find out the total amount that both Adrien and Lyliah received four years later, we need to calculate their individual salary increases and then add them up. Let's assume that Adrien's salary increased by $x dollars per year, and Lyliah's salary increased by $y dollars per year. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lyliah's before the increase, so we can set up the equation:  Adrien's salary = Lyliah's salary x 1.30. After four years, Adrien's salary would have increased by 4 times the amount it increased each year, or 4x(x + y) dollars. Similarly, Lyliah's salary would have increased by 4 times the amount it increased each year, or 4x(y + x) dollars. So the total amount that both Adrien and Lyliah received four years later would be:  Total amount = 4x(x + y) + 4x(y + x) = 8x(x + y) dollars. Since Adrien earned $40,000 more than Lyliah four years ago, we know that Adrien's salary at that time was $40,000 higher than Lyliah's. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  Adrien's salary four years ago = Lyliah's salary four years ago + $40,000. Solving for Lyliah's salary four years ago, we get:  Lyliah's salary four years ago = $40,000 / (1.30 - 1) = $40,000 / 0.7 = $57,143. Now we can substitute this value into the equation for the total amount they received four years later:  Total amount = 8x(x + y) = 8x(57,143 + x) = 462,952 + 8x(x) dollars. To find out how much Adrien received four years later, we can solve for x in the first equation:  Adrien's salary = Lyliah's salary x

Response:  To find out how much fruit they have in total, we need to add up the number of apples and oranges that each person brought. Let's start with Morisette: she brought 5 jabukas (j) + 8 narancica (n), so her total is 5j + 8n = 13. Now let's look at Kael: he brought 2 times as many jabukas as Morisette, so he brought 2 x 5 = 10 jabukas (k). He also brought half as many narancica as Morisette, so he brought 4 n. Therefore, Kael's total is 10j + 4n = 14. Finally, we can add up their totals to get the total amount of fruit: 13 + 14 = 27. So there are 27 pieces of fruit in total.

Let's start with Pam: she went on the roller coaster twice, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets. Now let's add Fred's rides: he went on the roller coaster four times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets. In total, they used 12 + 24 = 36 tickets.
Response:  In order to find out how many kilometers Walt walked on Wednesday (Srijeda), we can use the information that he walked six times as far on Tuesday (Utorak) as he did on Monday (Ponedjeljak). Let's call the distance Walt walked on Monday x kilometers. Then, the distance he walked on Tuesday is 6x kilometers. The total distance Walt walked from Monday to Wednesday is given as 41 miles. We can convert this to kilometers by multiplying by 1.60934 (there are approximately 1.60934 kilometers in a mile): 41 miles x 1.60934 = 65.172 kilometers. Since Walt walked 6x as far on Tuesday as he did on Monday, we can set up the equation: 6x + x = 65.172. Combining like terms, we get: 7x = 65.172. Dividing both sides by 7, we get: x = 9.302 kilometers. Therefore, Walt walked 9.302 kilometers on Monday and 55.864 kilometers on Tuesday (6x 9.302 = 55.864).

So, Rory's order will cost $23.40 with the $5.00 napojnica added."
"Response:  To find out how many questions were left unanswered by Mark in the second test, we need to divide the total number of questions in the test (100) by the time he had to complete it (6 hours). This gives us:  
100 / 6 = 16.67 questions per hour  
Since Mark spent 8 hours completing the first test, he did not have enough time to finish the second test completely. Therefore, the number of questions left unanswered is:  
100 - (16.67 x 8) = 100 - 130 = 70 questions  
So, Mark left 70 questions unanswered in the second test."

"Response:  To find out how many blocks Johnny will buy if he buys all the Legos, we need to know how many blocks are in each of the boxes and then add them up. Let's start by converting each number into its equivalent fraction:

* 500 = 500/1
* 3 x 500 = 3 x 500/1 = 3/1
* 1/4 x 500 = 1/4 x 500/1 = 125/4

Now let's add up the fractions:

500 + 3/1 + 125/4 = 500 + 3 + 125 = 628

Therefore, Johnny will buy 628 blocks if he buys all the Legos."

"Response:  If Brittany's mom gave $8 in change and the admission price for an adult is $12 and the admission price for a child is $10, then the number of dollars that Brittany's mom gave to the cashier can be calculated as follows:  
Adult ticket price = $12  
Child ticket price = $10  
Total cost = Adult ticket price + Child ticket price = $12 + $10 = $22  
Change given by Brittany's mom = Total cost - Price of tickets = $22 - ($12 + $10) = $22 - $22 = $0  
Therefore, Brittany's mom gave $0 in change."

"Response:  To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser to finish the race, we need to calculate the time it takes each of them to travel their respective distances. Let's start with Steve:  
Steve lives 3 miles from school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Therefore, his travel time is:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = 3 miles / 440 ft/min  
Time = 7.5 minutes (round up to 8 minutes) Now let's calculate Tim's travel time:  
Tim lives 2 miles from school and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. His travel time is:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = 2 miles / 264 ft/min  
Time = 7.5 minutes (round down to 7 minutes) Since Steve has an 8-minute head start, he will finish the race before Tim does. The winner will wait for the loser to finish for:  
Waiting Time = Finish Time - Start Time  
Waiting Time = 8 minutes - 7 minutes  
Waiting Time = 1 minute So, the winner will wait for one minute after finishing the race before the loser arrives."

Response:  To determine how many bananas need to be purchased for two months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required per month. We can do this by adding up the number of bananas required by each species:  Total bananas/month = (200 + 400 + 100) = 700 bananas/month.  Since there are two months, we need to double the total number of bananas to get the total quantity needed:  Total bananas = 2 x 700 = 1400 bananas.
"Response:  To determine how much farther the winner (Blake) is ahead of the loser (Kelly), we need to calculate the distance that each one has traveled. Let's start by calculating the distance that Blake has traveled:  

15 x 100 = 1500 yards  
Since Blake ran back and forth 15 times, he has traveled 1500 yards. Now let's calculate the distance that Kelly has traveled:  

34 x 40 = 1360 yards  
Kelly ran back and forth 34 times, but she only ran 40 yards each time, so her total distance is 1360 yards. Now we can find out how much farther Blake is ahead of Kelly:  

1500 - 1360 = 140 yards  
Blake is 140 yards ahead of Kelly."

"Response:  If Jackie chooses to hire an accountant and pays $90 per month, she will have $35 more per hour than if she were to work three hours less as a freelancer and earn $120 per hour ($120 - $90 = $30). Therefore, her total income after paying for the accountant's services would be:

$120 x 3 = $360 + $90 = $450

If she were to do it herself, her total income would be:

$120 x 3 = $360 - $90 = $270

Therefore, by hiring an accountant, Jackie would have $180 more in total income ($450 - $270 = $180)."

"Response:  If the winner received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in the class, then the number of votes that the loser received can be calculated as follows:  
Let x be the number of votes that the loser received. Since the winner received 3/4 of the votes, the number of votes that the winner received is 3/4 x. The total number of votes cast is 80, so the sum of the votes received by both candidates must equal 80:  
3/4x + x = 80  
2x + 3/4x = 80  
5x/4 = 80  
x = 160  
Therefore, the loser received 160 - 3/4(80) = 160 - 60 = 100 votes."
Response:  To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver to Sandra by 17 hours (5 PM), we need to calculate the total number of flowers she ordered and compare it with the number of red roses she received. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  Total number of flowers ordered = 4 times more than the number of white carnations + 200 pink calla lilies  Total number of flowers ordered = 4(10) + 200 = 40 + 200 = 240 flowers  Number of red roses requested = 4 times the number of white carnations  Number of red roses requested = 4(10) = 40 red roses  Since Sandra has already received 30 red roses, she needs an additional 10 red roses to fulfill her order. Therefore, Fred must deliver at least 10 red roses to Sandra by 17 hours (5 PM).
Response:  If Jean is two years older than Mark and Mark was five years younger than half of Jean's age two years ago, then we can set up an equation to represent this information. Let J be Jean's current age (in years) and M be Mark's current age (in years). We know that J = 2 + 5, so J = 7. Two years ago, when Mark was five years younger than half of Jean's age, his age would have been: M = (J/2) - 5 = (7/2) - 5 = 3. So Mark is currently 3 years old. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is 3 + 2 = 5 years old. Therefore, Jean is 5 years old.
"Response:  The faster team will be seconds ahead of the slower team at the end of the race if each member of the faster team runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds, while each member of the slower team runs their 400 meters in 60 seconds with an increase of 3 seconds for each subsequent runner. Calculating the total time difference between the two teams, we get:

Faster team: (55 sec x 4 runners) = 220 sec
Slower team: (60 sec x 4 runners) = 240 sec

Time difference = Faster team time - Slower team time
= 220 sec - 240 sec
= 20 sec

Therefore, the faster team will be 20 seconds ahead of the slower team at the end of the race."

Response:  There are 10 cages of mice that hold themselves and each mouse receives 5 pieces of cheese. Additionally, there is a shelter for rats where 20 pieces of cheese are divided among the rats. Nowhere else in the store do we use cheese. If 160 pieces of cheese are distributed among small rodents, how many mice are in each cage?  Calculation: Let X be the number of mice in each cage. Since each cage has 5 pieces of cheese, we can set up the equation: 5X = 160 (since there are 160 pieces of cheese to distribute). Solving for X, we get: X = 32 (since 5 x 32 = 160). Therefore, there are 32 mice in each cage.
Response:  To calculate how much Mandy needs to pay after 3 months, we can use the formula for future value of an investment with monthly compounding: FV = PV x (1 + r/n)^(n\*t) Where: FV = Future Value PV = Present Value (the amount borrowed) r = Monthly interest rate n = Number of times interest is compounded per year t = Time in years In this case, there are no years involved, so we'll assume that the time period is in months. We know that: PV = $100 r = 2%/12 = 0.02/month n = 12 (since interest is compounded monthly) t = 3 months So we can plug these values into the formula: FV = $100 x (1 + 0.02/12)^(12\*3) FV = $100 x (1 + 0.02)^3 FV = $100 x 1.06^3 FV = $104.89 Therefore, Mandy would need to pay Benedict $104.89 after 3 months.

x = 13  

So the merchant sold 13 vrećica of wheat."
Response:  To calculate how much each person paid, we need to first find out how much they spent on food and then add that amount to the cost of the rides. Let's start by finding out how much they spent on food: 4.50 dollars less than the total amount spent on tickets. So, if they spent 20.25 dollars on tickets, they spent 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 dollars on food. Now, let's add the cost of the two rides: 2 x 33 dollars = 66 dollars. Therefore, the total amount spent by the three friends is: 15.75 + 66 = 81.75 dollars. Since there are three people, each person paid: 81.75 / 3 = 27.25 dollars.

Response:  To find out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has after three months, we need to calculate her total number of cards collected in each month and then add them up. Let's break down the information given in the question:  Month 1: Elaine collected 3 times more cards than she had before (20 x 3 = 60).  Month 2: Elaine collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month (60 - 20 = 40).  Month 3: Elaine collected twice as many cards as she did in the first two months combined (40 + 40 = 80). Therefore, Elaine has a total of 80 Pokémon cards after three months.
"Response:  To find out how much Mark earns weekly in cents, we need to calculate the total amount he receives from both publishers and then divide that number by the number of weeks in a year (52). Let's start by calculating the total amount Mark receives from each publisher:  
For Publisher A:  
Total amount = Number of reichenicas x Price per reichenica = 1000 x 5c = $50  
For Publisher B:  
Total amount = Number of reichenicas x Price per reichenica = 1000 x 2x5c = $200  
Now let's add up the total amounts Mark receives from both publishers:  
Total amount = Total amount for Publisher A + Total amount for Publisher B = $50 + $200 = $250  
Finally, let's divide the total amount by the number of weeks in a year (52) to get the weekly earnings in cents:  
Weekly earnings = Total amount / Number of weeks in a year = $250 / 52 = $4.83 per week"
Response:  Baldur receives 5 cante of water every morning and 6 cante of water every afternoon. Since each canta contains 5 liters of water, Baldur receives a total of 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning and 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in the afternoon, for a daily total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water.

$2000 x 52 = $104,000 (weekly earnings) + $5000 = $119,000 (total earnings for the year)

If he receives the 5% increase in salary, his new weekly earnings would be:

$119,000 / 52 = $2308 (new weekly earnings)"
"Response:  To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces annually, we need to multiply the number of tons of grapes produced by each hectare by the number of hectares she has. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine and Josie has 10 hectares of land, her annual production would be:  
10 hectares x 5 tons/hectare = 50 tons  
50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels  
Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."

Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 kolacas. On Tuesday, she bought three times more than on Monday, so she bought 4 x 3 = 12 kolacas. On Wednesday, she bought five times more than on Tuesday, so she bought 12 x 5 = 60 kolacas. In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 kolacas.
Response:  The cost of each cup is $6000 / 10 = $600 per cup.
"Response:  To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate how much money she earns from mowing the lawn and compare it to the cost of the items she wants to buy. Let's break down the information given in the question:  
* Sara earns $5 per time she mows the lawn.  
* She has already saved $10.  
* The jacket costs $30.  
* The shoes cost $20 each (so two pairs would be $40).  
To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can set up an equation using these values:  
$5 x (number of times) = $30 + $40 = $70  
Solving for the number of times, we get:  
$5 x (number of times) = $70  
$5 x (number of times) = $70 / $5  
Number of times = $70 / $5  
Number of times = 14  
So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 14 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
Response:  Let's say there are x crvene (red) chickens and y bijele (white) chickens. Since each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3x. Each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5y. Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, so we can set up the equation:  3x + 5y = 42.  Now we know that there are more white chickens than red chickens, since Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens. So let's say there are y + 2 white chickens. We can substitute this into our previous equation:  3x + 5(y+2) = 42.  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  x = 10.  Therefore, Jerry has 10 red chickens.
Response:  To find out how many hours Gary spends walking in the local park, we need to divide the distance he walks (1.5 x 6 = 9 miles) by his speed (5 km/h): 9 miles / 5 km/h = 1.8 hours So, Gary spends 1.8 hours walking in the park.

Response:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work before she can buy the shoes and belt, we need to calculate her total earnings from working for that amount of time. Let's assume she works at a rate of $8 per hour (as stated in the problem).  First, let's calculate the cost of the items she wants to purchase: Shoes: $320 Belt: $32,000 Total cost: $352,000 Now, let's calculate the number of hours she needs to work to earn enough money to buy these items: Total cost / Hourly wage = Number of hours needed To find out how many hours she needs to work, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage: $352,000 / $8/hour = 44,000 hours So, Lori would need to work for approximately 44,000 hours (or about 5,500 days or 15 years) to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt.
Response:  To find out how much Janeth will still owe after paying $165 per month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will have paid over that period. We can do this by multiplying the number of months by the monthly payment amount: Total Amount = Monthly Payment x Number of Months Total Amount = $165 x 12 Total Amount = $1980 Now, we subtract the total amount she has paid from the original loan amount to find out how much she will still owe: Remaining Balance = Original Loan Amount - Total Amount Remaining Balance = $2000 - $1980 Remaining Balance = $20 To find out what percentage of the original loan amount she will still owe, we divide the remaining balance by the original loan amount and multiply by 100: Percentage Owed = (Remaining Balance / Original Loan Amount) x 100 Percentage Owed = ($20 / $2000) x 100 Percentage Owed = 10% So, after paying $165 per month for 12 months, Janeth will still owe $20, which is 10% of the original loan amount.
Response:  There are 4 roses in the vase and 7 daisies more than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 flowers in the vase.
Response:  The average age of the three is calculated by adding their ages and dividing by three.  Since Harriet is 21 years old, we know that her age is 21.  Therefore, the average age of the three is: (Adrian's age + Harriet's age + Zack's age) / 3 = (3 x 25) + (21) + (Zack's age) / 3 = 75 + 21 + Zack's age / 3 = 96 / 3 = 32.
Response:  Let's denote the number of points scored by each student as follows: N - Naomi, Y - Yuri, B - Brianna, and J - Jojo. We know that: N = 68, Y = 10 more than half of N, B = 17 more than N, and J =? We can start by finding out how many points Yuri scored: Y = (1/2)N + 10 = (1/2)(68) + 10 = 44 + 10 = 54 points. Now we can find out how many points Brianna scored: B = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85 points. Finally, we can find out how many points Jojo scored: J = Y + 10 = 54 + 10 = 64 points.
"Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing games during the weekend, we need to calculate the total time she spent solving crosswords and Sudoku puzzles. Let's start by calculating the time she spent solving each type of puzzle:  
Crosswords: 3 x 10 = 30 minutes (since she solved 3 crosswords) Sudoku: 8 x 5 = 40 minutes (since she solved 8 Sudoku puzzles) Now, let's add up the total time she spent playing games: Total time = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing games during the weekend."

Response:  To find out how much TVRTKA has spent on advertising in two years, we need to calculate the amount she spends each year and then add it up. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  Year 1: TVRTKA spends $15,000 on advertising. She then spends one-third of that amount ($15,000 x 1/3 = $5,000) on advertising for the next year (Year 2). So, in total, TVRTKA spends $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000 on advertising over two years.
Response:  To calculate the total cost of renting the canoe and the speedboat, we need to multiply the number of hours rented by the hourly rate.  For Carlos:  3 hours x $30/hour = $90  For Benji:  5 hours x $18/hour = $90  Therefore, both Carlos and Benji will pay $90 for their respective watercraft rentals.
Response:  If Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will spend 6 days traveling by bus and half as many days (3 days) driving. Therefore, the total number of days he will spend traveling is 6 + 3 = 9 days.
"Response:  To calculate the probability that a randomly selected card from James's deck will be a water-type Pokémon after he loses 8 water-type cards and buys 14 grass-type cards, we need to first determine the number of water-type cards remaining in the deck after he loses 8 cards.

Let X be the number of water-type cards remaining in the deck after losing 8 cards.

We know that James had 40 water-type cards initially, so:

X = 40 - 8

X = 32

Now, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected card from the updated deck will be a water-type card. We can do this by dividing the number of water-type cards remaining in the deck by the total number of cards remaining in the deck:

Probability of selecting a water-type card = X / Total number of cards remaining in the deck

Total number of cards remaining in the deck = 30 + 20 + X

Substituting X = 32, we get:

Total number of cards remaining in the deck = 30 + 20 + 32

Total number of cards remaining in the deck = 62

Probability of selecting a water-type card = 32 / 62

Probability of selecting a water-type card = 0.516 (approximately 51.6%)

So, the probability that a randomly selected card from James's deck will be a water-type Pokémon after he loses 8 water-type cards and buys 14 grass-type cards is approximately 51.6%."
Response:  The total cost of Chad's lunch is calculated as follows: Basic Burrito ($6.50) + Extra Meat ($2) + Extra Cheese ($1) + Avocado ($1) + 2 Sauces ($0.25 each) = $9.75. Adding an additional $3 for chips and drink brings the total to $12.75. Subtracting the $5 discount coupon leaves a balance due of $7.75.
Response:  To determine how many hours it will take for Kalinda and her mother to finish the 360 pieces of slagalica, we need to calculate their combined rate of work. Let's assume that Kalinda's mother can set up half as much as Kalinda in one minute. Therefore, Kalinda's mother can set up 2 komada (half of 4) in one minute.  Total number of pieces = 360 Komada  Kalinda's contribution = 4 komada/minute x 360 minutes = 1440 komada (since she can do this in 360 minutes) Mother's contribution = 2 komada/minute x 360 minutes = 720 komada (since she can do this in 360 minutes) Total number of pieces = 1440 + 720 = 2160 komada Therefore, it will take them 2160 / 4 = 540 minutes or 9 hours to complete the slagalica.
Response:  After two weeks, $60$ of the lubenicas were ready for harvest.
"Response:  To calculate the total amount that Mark will pay for his fleet of 12 cars, we need to consider two costs: the purchase price of each car and the additional registration fee. Let's break down the calculation as follows:  
Purchase Price per Car = $20,000 (given)  
Total Purchase Price for 12 Cars = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000  
Registration Fee per Car = $1,000 (given)  
Total Registration Fee for 12 Cars = 12 x $1,000 = $12,000  
Total Amount Payable by Mark = Total Purchase Price + Total Registration Fee  
= $240,000 + $12,000 = $252,000  
Therefore, Mark will pay a total of $252,000 for his fleet of 12 cars, including the purchase price and the registration fees."
"Response:  In order to find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to know how many she collected on Monday and how much more she collected than Robert on Monday. Let's say that Kylie collected x shells on Monday and Robert collected 20 - x shells on Monday (since he collected 20 shells and Kylie collected less). On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collects 2x shells. We can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 2x = 2(20 - x)
3x = 40 - 2x
solve for x

x = 16
So, Kylie collected 16 shells on Monday and 32 shells on Tuesday."

Response:  There are 36 pingvinas and they have three options: swimming in the ocean (1/3), entering the cave to eat dinner (1/3), and staying outside to sunbathe (1/3). Therefore, there are 36 x 1/3 = 12 pingvinas left to sunbathe.
Response:  To determine how many rows of strawberries Steve needs to produce three strawberries per day, we need to calculate his daily consumption in terms of strawberries. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and she eats three strawberries per day, Steve eats six strawberries per day (2 x 3 = 6). Therefore, Steve needs 6 / 3 = 2 rows of strawberries per day.
Response:  To ensure that each of John's 20 friends can get 4 pieces of pizza, he needs to order 20 x 4 = 80 pieces of pizza in total. Since pizzas are sold only by the slice (8 slices per pie), John needs to order 80/8 = 10 pizzas.
Response:  If Ram mixes the ink from five empty bottles to make one full bottle, then he can save $5 by not buying a new bottle of ink.

"Response:  To find out how many students left through exit C, we need to first determine how many students remained in the building after 30% of them left through exit A and 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B. Let's use algebra to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of students who left through exit A (x = 30% of 1000 = 300).
Let y be the number of students who left through exit B (y = 3/5 of 700 = 210).
So, the total number of students who left through exits A and B is x + y = 300 + 210 = 510.
Now, let z be the number of students who left through exit C (z = 1000 - 510 = 490).
Therefore, there were 490 students who left through exit C."
Response:  To find out how many more candies James has than Robert, we need to subtract the number of candies Robert has from the number of candies James has. If James has 6 more candies than Robert, and Robert has 54 candies, then James has 54 + 6 = 60 candies. Therefore, James has 60 - 54 = 6 more candies than Robert.
"Response:  If Dolly reads her two books at a rate of one book per day and Pandora reads her one book at a rate of one chapter per day (assuming each chapter takes one day to read), then together they will take:  
Day 1: Dolly reads one book, Pandora reads no books. Total books read = 1 (Dolly's book).  
Day 2: Dolly reads one book, Pandora reads one chapter. Total books read = 2 (Dolly's book + Pandora's chapter).  
Day 3: Dolly reads one book, Pandora reads two chapters. Total books read = 4 (Dolly's book + Pandora's two chapters).  
And so on...  
Therefore, in total, they will have read 6 books (3 books by Dolly and 3 chapters by Pandora) before either of them finishes their respective books."
Response:  To find out how many hours per week Mike writes, we need to divide the number of pages he can write in one sitting (6 minutes x 1 page = 6 minutes) by the time it takes him to write each letter (2 letters x 5 pages = 10 minutes). Therefore, Mike can write for 6/10 = 3/5 = 4/10 = 2 hours per week.

Response:  There are 4 puševa in one aquarium and 32 puševa in another aquarium. The difference between the number of puševa in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. If there are the same number of fish in both aquariums, then there must be 8 fish in each aquarium.
"Response:  To calculate how much Jean paid for her makeup services, we need to first determine the total amount she was charged for each day of shooting. We know that she was charged $250 per hour and that she needed 6 hours of makeup each day, so the daily cost would be:  
$250 x 6 hours = $1,500 per day  
Since the shoot lasted for 5 weeks (or 5 x 7 days = 35 days), the total cost for all 35 days would be:  
$1,500 x 35 days = $52,500  
Finally, since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount for the large volume of work, the actual amount Jean paid would be:  
$52,500 x 90% = $47,250"
Response:  Each parent paid $7 ($22 / 3).
Response:  To find out how much the cook spent, we need to multiply the number of vreća (4) by the weight of each vreća (50 pounds): 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Since the cost per kilogram is $1.50, we can calculate the total cost as follows: 200 pounds / 1.50 dollars/pound = $300. Therefore, the cook spent $300 on the lukas.
Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the difference between their daily intakes of calories. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Sue ate 4 times as much cake as her sister. So, if her sister ate x kolača (cake pieces), Sue ate 4x kolača.  We know that each kolač contains 200 calories, so Sue ate 4x \* 200 = 800 calories on Monday.  On Tuesday (utorak), Sue ate twice as much cake as her sister again. So, if her sister ate y kolača, Sue ate 2y kolača. Since we already found out that Sue ate 800 calories on Monday, let's add that to the total number of calories she consumed on Tuesday:  Total calories eaten by Sue on Tuesday = 2y \* 200 + 800 = 2y \* 400 + 800  Now, we need to find out how many calories Sue's sister consumed on both days. On Monday, her sister ate 5 kolača (since we were told that Sue ate 4 times as much cake as her sister). Each kolač contains 200 calories, so her sister consumed 5 \* 200 = 1000 calories on Monday. On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 kolača (we were told that Sue ate twice as much cake as her sister on Tuesday). Again, each kolač contains 200 calories, so her sister consumed 13 \* 200 = 2600 calories on Tuesday.  Finally, we can subtract the total number of calories Sue's sister consumed from the total number of calories Sue consumed to find out how many more calories Sue consumed:  Total calories consumed by Sue - Total calories consumed by her sister = 800 + 2600 - 10
