"Response: 
Janet produces 16 eggs per day and sells them at $2 each. So she makes $32 from egg sales every day (16 x $2 = $32).  Now let's consider how many muffins she bakes and sells every day. According to the problem, she bakes four muffins every day and sells them for $5 each. Therefore, she earns $20 from muffin sales every day ($4 x $5 = $20). In total, then, Janet makes $52 per day from both her egg and muffin businesses ($32 + $20 = $52)."
Response:  We need two blue fiber spools and half of the white one to make an outfit. So we will need... (calculate)...bobbins altogether!
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then invested $50,000 in repairs. This means he spent a total of $130,000 on the house ($80,000 + $50,000).  Now, since the value of the house increased by 150%, we can calculate the new value of the house as follows: New Value = Old Value x (1 + Percentage Increase) New Value = $130,000 x (1 + 150%) New Value = $245,000 So, Josh has gained $115,000 ($245,000 - $130,000) from his investment in the house.
Response:  First sprint: James runs 60 meters. Second sprint: James runs 60 meters again. Third sprint: James runs 60 meters once more. Total distance run per week = Distance of first sprint + Distance of second sprint + Distance of third sprint = 60 meters x 3 = 180 meters per week. Therefore, James runs a total of 180 meters per week.
Response:  If Wendi gives her flock of 20 chickens 3 cups of food per day (as stated in the problem), then she will give them a total of 60 cups of food per day (3 cups x 20 chickens).  Since there are 8 hours in a day, Wendi will give each chicken approximately 7.5 cups of food per hour (60 cups / 8 hours = 7.5 cups/hour).
Response:  If one glass costs $5, then each subsequent glass costs $\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$ dollars. So if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will pay $\boxed{\text {16} \times 2.5 = 40}$ dollars.
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 16 = 32 sheep.  We also know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 5 = 20 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is: 32 + 20 + 5 = 67 sheep.
Response: 1) Before the interruption, Carla had downloaded 40% of the file, which is equal to 80 GB (200 GB x 40%). 2) After the interruption and reinstallation of updates, Carla must restart the download from the beginning, so she has to download the remaining 160 GB (200 GB - 40 GB). Therefore, it will take Carla approximately 4 minutes to complete the download (160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 4 minutes).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John travelled for 3 hours at a speed of 100 km/h before turning back. So he covered a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/h x 3 h = 300 km

Now, after turning back, he spent the next 2 hours in traffic, so he didn't cover any more distance during this time. Therefore, the total distance he covered in 4 hours is:

Total Distance = Distance Covered Before Turning Back + Distance Covered After Turning Back = 300 km + 0 km = 300 km

So, at the end of 4 hours, John was still 300 km away from his destination."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Eliza's hourly wage is $10. Then, she receives an overtime pay of $1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $12 for every hour worked beyond 40 hours in a week. Therefore, if she has worked 45 hours this week, her total earnings can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = Regular hourly wage x Number of regular hours worked + Overtime pay x Number of overtime hours worked Total earnings = $10 x 40 + ($12 x 5) = $400 + $60 = $460 This means that Eliza has earned $460 for this week.
Response:  In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. If it tripled its downloads in the second month (as stated), then it had 60 x 3 = 180 downloads in that month. However, if it decreased by 30% in the third month, then it would have had 180 / 0.7 = 257 downloads in that month. Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three months is 60 + 180 + 257 = 597.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toula bought 3 dozen of ciambelles which costs $ 68 x 3 = $ 204.  Secondly, she also bought 2 dozen of mini cupcakes which costs $ 80 x 2 = $ 160. Finally, she bought 6 dozen of mini cheesecakes which costs $ 55 x 6 = $ 330. Therefore, the total cost is $ 204 + $ 160 + $ 330 = $ 794.
Response:  First year:  We spend $90 to plant the tree and get no fruit. Second year:  We have 7 lemons at $1.5 each = $10.5 Third year:  We have 14 lemons at $1.5 each = $21 Fourth year:  We have 21 lemons at $1.5 each = $32 Fifth year:  We have 28 lemons at $1.5 each = $42 Sixth year:  We have 35 lemons at $1.5 each = $52 Seventh year:  We have 42 lemons at $1.5 each = $63 Eighth year:  We have 49 lemons at $1.5 each = $73 Ninth year:  We have 56 lemons at $1.5 each = $83 Tenth year:  We have 63 lemons at $1.5 each = $93 Eleventh year:  We have 70 lemons at $1.5 each = $105 Twelfth year:  We have 77 lemons at $1.5 each = $117 Thirteenth year:  We have 84 lemons at $1.5 each = $126 Fourteenth year:  We have 91 lemons at $1.5 each = $136 Fifteenth year:  We have 98 lemons at $1.5 each = $146 Sixteenth year:  We have 105 lemons at $1.5 each = $156 Seventeenth year:  We have 112 lemons at $1.5 each = $166 Eighteenth year:  We have 119 lemons at $1.5 each = $180 Nineteenth year:  We have 126 lemons at $1.5 each = $195 Twentieth year:  We have 133 lemons at $1.5 each = $200 Twenty-first year:  We have 140 lemons at $1.5 each = $210 Twenty-second year:  We have 147 lemons
"Response:  We know that Melanie sold 1/3 of the vacuum cleaners to Green House, 2/3 to Red House, and half of what was left to Orange House. So, if she had x aspirators at the beginning, we can write an equation:  
x - (1/3)x = 5  
Simplifying the equation:  
2x - 3x = 5  
Solving for x:  
x = 7  
So, Melanie had 7 aspirator cleaners at the beginning."
"Response:  We know that in total there are 20 students in the class and they have chosen one of three types of dance: contemporary (20%), jazz (25%), or hip hop (75%). So we can write an equation using these values:

(20/100) x 20 = 20/100 x A + (80/100) x B

where A represents the percentage of students who chose jazz and B represents the percentage of students who chose hip hop. Solving for B, we get:

B = 80/100 - 20/100 = 60/100

So, 60% of the students in the class chose hip hop. Therefore, the answer to the question is 60%."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the expected value of each option based on their respective probabilities and market growth rates. For the jewelry option, the probability is 0.7 (given that the market grows at 2.5%) and for the electronics option, it's 0.6 (based on an 1.2% growth rate). Now, let's calculate the expected values: Jewelry Option: E(V) = $5,000 x 0.7 = $3,500 Electronics Option: E(V) = $8,000 x 0.6 = $4,800 Next, we compare these expected values to determine which option has higher potential profit. The option with the highest expected value is the one that maximizes the profit. In this case, the expected value of the jewelry option ($3,500) is higher than that of the electronics option ($4,800), so the commercial should choose the jewelry option to maximize his profit. Therefore, the correct answer is: Commercial should choose the jewelry option to maximize the profit, which would result in a profit of $3,500.
Response:  On day one, both trains travel west for 130 kilometers. So, Train A has traveled 130 kilometers and Train B has traveled 0 kilometers.  On day two, both trains travel north for 240 kilometers. So, Train A has traveled an additional 240 kilometers (for a total of 370 kilometers), while Train B has also traveled an additional 240 kilometers (for a total of 260 kilometers). Therefore, the distance traveled by each train in two days is:  Distance traveled by Train A = 370 km Distance traveled by Train B = 260 km
Response:  As an instructor, Jill works 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week $700/week x 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year As a coach, Jill works 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week $450/week x 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year Total income = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500/year
Response:  If Claire makes an omelette of 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, then she will have made a total of 3 x 21 = 63 omelettes in one month (which is equal to 4 weeks). So, in 4 weeks, Claire will have consumed 63 x 3 = 189 eggs.
Response:  First, we know that Marissa has already traveled 4 kilometers in one hour, so her speed at this point is 4/1 = 4 miles per hour. Then, she travels another hour and covers 2 kilometers, so her new speed is 2/1 = 2 miles per hour. To find her average speed for the remaining distance of 10 miles, we can use the formula: average speed = total distance / time taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles (since she has already covered 4 miles), and the time taken is 3 hours (since it took her an additional hour to cover the next 2 kilometers). Therefore, her average speed for the remaining distance is: average speed = 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles per hour.
"Response:  We have:
Half of 10 liters = 5 liters (of orange juice)
Three-quarters of 15 liters = 11.25 liters (of pineapple juice)
After adding the orange juice, we have:
Total volume = 5 + 11.25 = 16.25 liters
Now, when we turn the mixture upside down and add a liter of orange liqueur, we have:
New total volume = 16.25 - 1 = 15.25 liters
Therefore, there are 15.25 liters of liquid in the remaining 24 liters."
Response:  We know that Raymonde was born 6 years before Samantha, so he is 6 + 31 = 37 years old when Samantha was born. Then, at age 23, Raymond had his son, who is now 37 + 23 = 59 years old. Therefore, Raymond's son was born 59 years ago.
Response:  Billy has 8 customers in total. The first three customers buy one DVD each, so he sells 3 DVDs. Then, the next two customers buy 2 DVDs each, so he sells an additional 4 DVDs (for a total of 7). Finally, the last three customers do not buy any DVDs, so Billy does not sell any more. Therefore, Billy has sold a total of 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs on Monday.
Response:  After one hour (from 1 to 2), the candle will be 2 cm shorter = 2 cm.  After two hours (from 2 to 4), the candle will be 4 cm shorter = 6 cm.  After three hours (from 3 to 5), the candle will be 8 cm shorter = 10 cm. Therefore, after five hours, the candle will be 10 cm shorter than its original length of 20 cm.
Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book last year and there was a discount of 25%. So we can write an equation as follows:  Price original = Discounted price x (1 - Discount percentage)  In this case, the price original is what we want to find out. Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Price original = $19.50 x (1 - 0.25)  Price original = $19.50 x 0.75  Price original = $14.38  Therefore, the price original of the book was $14.38.
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for her food. From this, we can determine that she ordered at least one of each item (pasta, milk, apples). So let's list out all possible combinations and calculate how much each combination would cost:

* Pasta + Milk + Apples = $12 + $3 x 5 = $60
* Pasta + Milk + Apples + Pizza = $12 + $3 x 5 + $8.5 x n = $75 + $4n
* Pasta + Milk + Apples + Pizza = $12 + $3 x 5 + $8.5 x n = $75 + $4n

Since Marie paid $50, we know that the total cost of her order is less than or equal to $50. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

$60 < 50

Solving for n, we get:

n < 4

So Marie ordered exactly 4 boxes of pizza."
Response:  We know that Mishka has bought 3 pairs of shorts, which cost $ 16.50 each, so he spent $ 16.50 x 3 = $ 49.50 for shorts. Similarly, she bought 3 pairs of pants, which cost $ 22.50 each, so she spent $ 22.50 x 3 = $ 67.50 for pants. And finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes, which cost $ 42 each, so she spent $ 42 x 3 = $ 126 for shoes. Therefore, in total, Mishka spent $ 49.50 + $ 67.50 + $ 126 = $ 243 dollars for all clothing items.
Response:  If she eats one portion of ice cream every night and there are 15 portions in each box, then after 60 days (or 3 months), she will have eaten 3 x 15 = 45 portions of ice cream. Since each box costs $4, she will have spent $4 x 45 = $180 on ice cream over those 3 months. Therefore, her total expenditure for ice cream is $180.
Response:  We know that Henry made two stops during his bike ride of 60 miles. He stopped after 20 miles and his second stop was at 15 miles from the end of the trip. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Distance = Total distance - (Distance to first stop + Distance to second stop) Now, we are given that the total distance is 60 miles, and the distance to the first stop is 20 miles. Therefore, we can plug these values into our equation: Distance = 60 - (20 + x) Where x is the distance to the second stop. Since the second stop is 15 miles from the end of the trip, we can substitute this value for x: Distance = 60 - (20 + 15) = 45 miles So, Henry traveled 45 miles between his first and second stops.
Response:  If two pairs of high heels cost $5 less than the stivali and one pair of high heels costs $33, then we can write an equation based on this information: Stivali = $X + ($5 - X) (where X is the price of the other two pairs). Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: $100 = $X + ($5 - $X) Now, simplifying the equation, we get: $100 = $X + $5 - $X $100 = $X Solving for $X, we find that the stivali cost $77.
Response:  We know that Darrell is 7 times older than Allen, so their combined age is 7x + x = 162. Since Allen is 10 years younger than Darrell, we can write Allen's age as x - 10. Now we have two equations: 7x + (x - 10) = 162 and x - 10 = 7(Allen's age). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us Allen's age as 48.
Response:  First, Gunther thinks there are 80 marmalades in the jar. Then, his friend says that there are 20 more than half of the first estimate, so there are 160 (80 + 20) marmalades in total. Finally, another friend says that there are 25% more marmalades than the previous estimate, which means there are 195 marmalades in total (160 x 1.25). Therefore, their estimated average is 195.
Response:  Since there are 10 dogs and each dog spends 0.5 hours taking care of itself every day, we have: Time spent by John taking care of the dogs = Number of dogs x Time spent by each dog per day = 10 dogs x 0.5 hours/day = 5 hours/day  Therefore, John spends 5 hours per day taking care of the dogs.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total. Since there are 30 more silver coins than gold coins, we can say that Gretchen has 30 + 80 = 110 gold coins. Therefore, Gretchen has 110 - 30 = 80 gold coins.
"Response:  We know that Siobhan has two fewer jewels than Aaron and Aaron has five more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Siobhan = Aaron - 2
Aaron = Half of Raymond + 5
Now we need to solve for Siobhan. Using the first equation, we get:
Siobhan = Aaron - 2
= (Half of Raymond + 5) - 2
= Half of (Raymond + 10) - 2
= Half of 46 - 2
= 23
So Siobhan has 23 jewels."
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he has scored a total of 4 x 20 = 80 points. Then, in the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the previous period, which means he scored (25/100) x 80 = 20 points. Therefore, Mike has totalled 80 + 20 = 100 points.
Response:  Terry consumes two yogurts every day and there are currently 4 yogurts for sale at $5 each. To calculate how much he spends in 30 days, we need to multiply the number of yogurts consumed daily by the cost per yogurt and then multiply that result by the number of days. So, Terry spends: $$ = 2 \times 4 = 8$ yogurts per day $\times $ $5 = $40$ per month. Therefore, Terry spends $120$ in 30 days on yogurt.
Response:  Firstly, John sells all his toys and gets $15 x 13 = $195 from it. Then he spends $195 x 8 = $1620 on video games. So he has $1620 - $15 x 13 = $147 left after buying the video games. Therefore, John still has 13 sets of Legos.
Response:  If John runs 100 kilometers per week and he runs three days a week, then he runs a total of 300 kilometers per week (100 km x 3 days). Now, let's analyze his running time for each day: On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of 3/4 \* 100 km = 75 km. On the other two days, he runs for half the time, which means he covers a distance of 2/3 \* 75 km = 56.67 km per day. Therefore, in one week, John runs a total distance of: 300 km + 75 km + 56.67 km = 431.67 km.
"Response:  If Dana can run four times faster than she can walk and can jump at half the speed of running, then we know that her walking speed is 1/4 of her running speed (since she can run 4 times faster). So if she walks at x miles per hour, she runs at 4x miles per hour.  Now, we are told that she can cover 5 km in one hour while walking, so her walking speed is 5 km/h.  Since she can jump at half the speed of running, her jumping speed is also 2x miles per hour.  Therefore, if she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking, she will cover a total distance of:

Total distance = Time spent running x Running speed + Time spent walking x Walking speed
= (1/3) x (2x) + (2/3) x (5 km/h)
= 4x + 10 km/h

So, if Dana can cover 5 km in one hour while walking, and she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking, she will be able to cover 4x + 10 km in 6 hours."
Response:  We know that iPhone of Brandon is four times older than Ben's iPhone. So, if Ben's iPhone is x years old, then Brandon's iPhone is 4x years old.  Moreover, we know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, if Suzy's iPhone is y years old, then Ben's iPhone is 2y years old. Now, we have to find out how many years old is Brandon's iPhone. So, we can write an equation: 4x = y + 2(Suzy's age)  Solving for x, we get: 4x = y + 2suzy's age  Divide both sides by 4: x = (y + 2Suzy's age)/4  Substituting the values given in the question: x = (2 + 2(3))/4  Simplifying: x = 7/4  Therefore, the iPhone of Brandon is 7/4 years old.
Response:  First, we know that when Polly doesn't have the precious stone, she can throw the javelin 140 meters within the dragon's breath range.  Then, when she has the precious stone, she can throw it three times farther than usual, which means she can throw it 420 meters (3 x 140).  Finally, since the dragon's breath reaches only up to 300 meters, Polly can safely stand at most 70 meters away from the dragon when throwing the javelin with the precious stone (300 - 420 = 70).
Response:  If Nonna Jones made 5 tartes of apple and cut each one into 8 pieces, then she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of tart in total.  Since there were 14 remaining pieces of tart after everyone had taken some, that means that everyone took a total of 14 - 40 = -26 pieces of tart.  So, the answer is -26.
Response:  If one serving of potato chips has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a bag that weighs 300 grams, then...
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many candles Charlie can make from one kilogram of beeswax. Since each kilogram of beeswax allows him to create 10 spiral candles, he will be able to produce 10 x 20 = 200 candles with one kilogram of wax. Now, let's find out how much money Charlie makes selling these candles. If he sells each candle for $2, then he will earn total revenue of 200 x $2 = $400 from selling all the candles. Finally, we need to subtract his initial investment in supplies (which is $10) from his total revenue to get his profit. Therefore, Charlie's profit netto is $400 - $10 = $390.
Response:  On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles and spent 4 hours each = 20 hours.  On Tuesday, she wrote 3 times more articles than on Monday (5 x 3 = 15) and spent 4 hours each = 60 hours.  On Wednesday, she doubled her work from Tuesday (15 x 2 = 30) and spent 4 hours each = 120 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in those three days is 20 + 60 + 120 = 200 hours.
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-its in her bag before going to work at the bar. Then she stopped at the store and bought a pack of Post-its. Since she used only one Post-it for each of the 220 cups of coffee at work, there were 220 Post-its left over from the pack. Therefore, the number of Post-its in the pack is 220 - 80 = 140.
Response:  If John buys twice as many red ties as blue ones, then he has bought $2 \times 20 = 40$ dollars worth of blue ties and $2 \times 2 = 4$ dollars worth of red ties. So, John has spent a total of $40 + 4 = 44$ dollars for all his ties.
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a piece of string that is 1.5 meters long to support the tomatoes in her garden. If we divide this length by the length of each piece (which is 15 cm), we get:

$ \text{Length of string} = 1.5 \text{ meters} = 150 \text{ cm}$

So, Tracy obtained $150$ pieces of string, each one being $15$ cm long."
Response:  Since every floor has 8 units and 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied floors as follows: Number of occupied floors = Total number of floors x Percentage of building that is occupied Number of occupied floors = 15 x 0.75 = 11 floors Now, let's find out how many apartments are available per floor: Number of apartments per floor = Total number of apartments - Number of occupied floors Number of apartments per floor = 25 - 11 = 14 apartments per floor Therefore, there are 14 apartments available for rent on each of the remaining 11 floors (since 3/4 of the building is occupied). So, the total number of apartments available for rent in the building is: Total number of apartments available = Number of apartments per floor x Number of floors available Number of apartments available = 14 x 11 = 154 apartments In conclusion, there are 154 apartments available for rent in the building.
Response:  If Lloyd has a farm of eggs and his hens produce 252 eggs per day, then he sells them at $2 per dozen. So, how much does Lloyd earn from eggs in one week? Weekly income = Number of eggs sold x Selling price per egg / Dozen  Weekly income = 252 eggs/day x $2/dozen / 10 (since there are 10 eggs in a dozen)  Weekly income = $504/week Now we have to convert this amount into dollars. To do that, divide the weekly income by 7 since there are 7 days in a week.  $504/week / 7 days/week = $72/day Therefore, Lloyd earns $72 per day from his egg farming business.
"Response:  The distance traveled during the first leg of the journey is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x (4 hours - 1 hour) = 40 miles
Now, let's find out how much time it takes to return:
Time = Distance / Speed = 40 miles / 6 miles/hour = 6.67 hours
So, it will take approximately 6.67 hours for La Nave di Tom to return."
Response:  If Uriah's book bag is becoming too heavy for him and it currently weighs 15 kg (as stated in the problem), then removing 5 kg would bring the weight down to 10 kg. Since each comic book weighs 0.75 kg and each toy weighs 0.75 kg, if he removes 30 comics, he will have to remove 22.5 kg of toys (since 30 x 0.75 = 22.5). Therefore, after removing 30 comics, Uriah must remove 22.5 kg of toys from his book bag.
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 tires for trucks and 4 for cars, so he earned $60 x 6 = $360 + $40 x 4 = $160 = $520 in total.  On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires but did not repair any truck tires, so he earned $40 x 12 = $480. Therefore, the mechanic earned more money on Friday with an income of $520 + $480 = $900.
Response:  The sisters Doubtfire have 7 adopted cats from the local animal shelter. Their mother tells them that their two pet cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. According to their mother, Patchy has had three times as many kittens as the number of cats they adopted (3 x 7 = 21), while Trixie has had 12 kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens for the Doubtfire family is 21 + 12 = 33 kittens.
Response:  Jean has 30 lecca-lecca and he eats two of them. So, he has 28 lecca-lecca left. To put two suckers in a bag, we need at least one bag for each two lecca-lecca. Therefore, Jean can fill __________ bags with his remaining lecca-lecca.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn each time he goes to the movies, then his total cost is $7 + $7 = $14 per trip. Since he has $42 dollars a week, he can go to the movies $\frac{42}{14} = 3$ times per week. Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times per week if he has $42 dollars a week.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total weight of the truck and its contents without any scatole. The weight of the driver is 3755 pounds or 1698 kg. Therefore, the weight of the empty truck = 1698 kg + 1698 kg = 3396 kg (or 7492 lbs). Now let's assume that each box has a weight of 5 kg (or 11 lbs), so there are 3396 / 5 = 679 boxes in total. However, since some of these boxes will be stacked on top of each other, we can only fit roughly half of this number onto the bridge at once. So the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge = approximately 679/2 = 339 boxes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Stephen ordered an item worth $40 online. Then, he was charged with a delivery fee of 25% of the total amount, which is equal to $10 (25% x $40). Additionally, he paid $3 as delivery fees. Finally, he added a tip of $4. So, let's calculate the final price of Stephen's order: Total cost = Item value + Delivery fee + Tip = $40 + $10 + $4 = $64. Therefore, the final price of Stephen's order was $64.
"Response:  We have:

* 6 grappoli of grapes with 20 grapes each = 120 grapes (grappolo x numero di grappoli)
* 67 single grapes scattered throughout the bush = 67 grapes (singoli frutti dispersi)
Total number of grapes = Grappoli + Singoli frutti dispersi = 120 + 67 = 187 grapes. Therefore, there are 187 lampions in total."
Response:  We know that out of 25 oranges, 1 is bad (cattiva), and we also know that 20% are immature (incomplete). So, there are 5 immature oranges. Now, let's consider the acidic oranges. There are 2 acidic oranges among the total number of oranges. Therefore, the remaining good oranges are 25 - 5 - 2 = 18. So, there are 18 good oranges in the basket.
Response:  Firstly, Janet paid $500 for the material of the necklace. Then she paid $800 to the jeweler who constructed it. Finally, she paid $100 (10%) as insurance. Therefore, in total, Janet paid $680 ($500 + $800 + $100) for the necklace.
Response:  If she works for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000, then her total pension amount is:  P = $50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000.  Now, from year 20 to 60 (i.e., after 40 years of service), she gets 5% of the pension amount every year as a bonus. So, her annual bonus starting from year 20 is: B = $2,000,000 x 5% = $100,000. Therefore, her total annual pension amount including the bonus is: P + B = $2,000,000 + $100,000 = $2,100,000.
Response:  First half of the year = $140 x (6/12) = $80 Second half of the year = $80 x (6/12) = $56 Total amount paid for the year = $80 + $56 = $136
Response:  We know that Sophia has traveled 160 kilometers since she last filled her tank, which means she has used up 160/4 = 40 liters of fuel. Since she only has one remaining liter of fuel left, she can travel at most 40 + 1 = 41 kilometers more before running out of gas. Therefore, Sophia can go 41 kilometers with just one full tank of gas.
Response:  Jim spends two hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and read for half of that time. So he spends 2 + (1/2) = 3 hours in front of the TV and reading each week. To find out how many hours he spends in total in 4 weeks, we can multiply this number by 4: 3 x 4 = 12 hours. Therefore, Jim passes 12 hours in front of the TV and reading each week.
"Response:  Since there are four schools participating in the tournament and each school has sent one female basketball team and one male basketball team with five players on each team, we have:
Female teams: 4 schools x 1 team/school = 4 teams
Male teams: 4 schools x 1 team/school = 4 teams
Total number of players: 4 schools x 5 players/team (on average) = 20 players
Total number of coaches: 4 schools x 1 coach/school = 4 coaches
Therefore, all together, 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 32 people have been sent to the tournament by all the schools."
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies less than the number of diamonds. So, if we subtract 35 from 175, we get 140. Therefore, there were 140 gemstones (diamonds + rubies) in the chest.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in Dr. Wertz's school. So if there are 60 girls, then there are 120 boys (twice 60). Since each class has 5 students per teacher, we can calculate the number of teachers as follows: Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 120 boys + 60 girls / 5 = 7  Therefore, there are 7 teachers in Dr. Wertz's school.
"Response:  Bailey starts with some money and then receives an weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of those 8 weeks, if he has a total of $100, how much did Bailey start with?  We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the amount of money that Bailey started with.

After 8 weeks, Bailey received $40 (8 x $5). So, his new balance is:

x + $40 = $100

Solving for x, we get:

x = $60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"Response:

Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second one has twice as many instructions as the first (i.e., 40 instructions). So, in total, Kelian needs to read 60 instructions to prepare both dishes.
Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each piece of cheesecake for $4, then he will make $3 x 43 = $132 from brownie sales and $4 x 23 = $92 from cheesecake sales in total. So, Tommy will have raised $132 + $92 = $224.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of each phone: $150 x 5 = $750. Then, we apply an interest rate of 2% to find out how much Sheila will pay for each unit of capital: $750 x 2% = $15. So, Sheila will pay $15 per month for each phone. Therefore, her total monthly payment for 3 months will be $15 x 3 = $45.
Response:  If we multiply the number of vases sold for each type of flower by its price, we get:  Calendula: $2.74 x 12 = $32.88 Petunia: $1.87 x 9 = $16.53 Begonia: $2.12 x 17 = $35.34 Total revenue: $32.88 + $16.53 + $35.34 = $84.75 So, if Artie sells these amounts and rounds all prices to the nearest dollar, he will earn $84.75 in total.
"Response:  If we have a square of side length $x$, then its area is $x^2$. So, if we have a castle with $n$ levels, each level has an area of $\frac{x^2}{n}$. Since the total surface area of the castle is equal to the sum of the areas of all the levels, we can write:
$$S = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{x^2}{n}$$
Now, since there are $4$ levels in this case, we can simplify the equation as follows:
$$S = 4\cdot \frac{x^2}{4} = 4x^2$$
So, the surface area of the castle is $4x^2$."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many days are in the first year of Cecilia's dog's life. There are 365 days in a year, so there will be 180 days in the first year (since the dog is 180 days old after the first 180 days). Now, let's calculate how much food the dog needs each day based on its age and size. According to the question, the dog needs 1 tazza of food every 24 hours, which means it needs 4 tazze of food per day ( since there are 24 hours in a day). Therefore, Cecilia must buy 4 x 180 = 720 sacchetti of food for her dog during its first year of life. Since each sacchetto contains 110 tazze of food, Cecilia must buy 720 / 110 = 6.5 sacchetti of food per day for her dog during its first year of life.
Response:  We know that Sarah makes half of the flour that Raymond does, so she makes 400/2 = 200 pounds of flour.  And we also know that David makes four times as much flour as Sarah, so he makes 4 x 200 = 800 pounds of flour. Therefore, the difference in the amount of flour made by Raymond and David is 800 - 200 = 600 pounds.
"Response:  If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the better price of $2 each, he will pay:
$2 x 18 = $36
So, he saves $24 ($36 - $12) by choosing the better deal."
Response:  Firstly, we know that John has to pay $100 for the haircut itself. Then, he gets an discount of 30%, which means he will pay $70 (100 x 30%) less than the original price. So, the cost of the haircut after the discount is $30 ($100 - $70). Therefore, the final cost of the haircut for John is $30.
Response:  The girls took each 1/6 of 24 liters of water, so they took in total 24/6 = 4 liters of water. Then, one boy took 6 liters of water, leaving 4 + 6 = 10 liters of water remaining. Therefore, there are 10 liters of water left.
Response:  At first, Charlie had 10 stickers. Then he bought 21 more from the mall and received 23 as a gift for his birthday. So, at this point, Charlie has 54 stickers (10 + 21 + 23). Next, he gave 9 of them to his sister. Now, he has 45 stickers left (54 - 9 = 45). Finally, he used 28 of them to decorate a greeting card. Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left (45 - 28 = 17).
Response:  If Grace weighs 40 chilies and Alex weights less than her by half, then Alex weighs 20 chilies. So, their weight in pounds is:  Grace - 40 = 30 chilies Alex - 20 = 20 chilies x 2 = 40 pounds
Response:  We have 3 cespugli of roses. Each cespuglio has 25 roses. Therefore, we have 3 x 25 = 75 roses altogether. Since each rose has 8 spines, there are 75 x 8 = 600 spines in total.
Response:  We know that the team has played 22 games and won 8 more than they have lost. So, if they have lost x times, then they have won 22 - x times. Since they have won 8 more than they have lost, we can write: 22 - x = 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. Therefore, the team has won 14 games.
Response:  Since Gene has been going on vacation four times a year since he was 23 years old (he is now 34), that means he has gone on vacation for a total of 11 times (4 x 11 = 44).  Each time he goes on vacation, he collects one more block of T-shirts to add to his collection. So, he has collected 44 blocks of T-shirts so far.  Therefore, the number of blocks of T-shirts Gene has in total is 44.
"Response:  The alarm sounded three times today and each time it sounded for a different amount of time. Here are the details we know from the question:

1. First time: It sounded four times.
2. Second time: It sounded for three times longer than the first time, so it sounded for (4 + 3) = 7 times.
3. Third time: It sounded for half as long as the second time, so it sounded for (7 / 2) = 3.5 times.

Therefore, the alarm sounded a total of 4 + 7 + 3.5 = 14.5 times today."
Response:  If the company pays each of its employees $600 per month and has a policy to give them a 10% raise every year for those who have been with the company for five years or more, then we can calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three additional years of service as follows:  First Year (just completed): $600 x 12 = $7,200 Second Year (current year): $7,200 x 1.10 = $8,432 Third Year (next year): $8,432 x 1.10 = $9,570 Total Annual Salary after Three Additional Years of Service: $7,200 + $8,432 + $9,570 = $25,102 Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three additional years of service would be $25,102.
Response:  If Marilyn has sold 10 times more than Harald, then for every copy that Harald has sold, Marilyn has sold 10 copies. So if Harald has sold x copies, Marilyn has sold 10x copies. We are given that Marilyn has sold 88,000 copies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 10x = 88,000. Solving for x, we get: x = 8,800. So Harald has sold 8,800 copies.
Response:  Since one-fourth of the guests did not show up (4/16), we need to adjust the number of gifts accordingly. So, Christina needs 120 gift bags instead of 160 (16 x 75 = 120). The cost of each bag is $2, so she will spend $240 in total ($2 x 120 gift bags).
Response:  Adults eat 10 kg of salad per person and children half that amount (5 kg). So for 20 adults, it would be 20 x 10 = 200 kg of salad. For 5 children, it would be 5 x 5 = 25 kg of salad. In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 kg of salad to the picnic.
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three times as many animals as Marcia.
Marcia has two more animals than Cindy.
Cindy has four animals.
So, we can write an equation based on these statements:
Let x be the number of animals owned by Jan.
Then, the number of animals owned by Marcia is 3x.
The number of animals owned by Cindy is 4.
Now, we need to find out how many animals are owned in total by all three people. So, let's add up their numbers:
Total number of animals = Number of animals owned by Jan + Number of animals owned by Marcia + Number of animals owned by Cindy
= 3x + 2(4) + 4
= 3x + 8 + 4
= 7x + 12
Therefore, the total number of animals owned by all three people is 7x + 12."
Response:  We know that:  - Amy has 5 years more than Jackson (given)  - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey (given)  - James is one year older than Corey (given) So, we can write:  Age of Jackson = Age of Amy + 5 Years  Age of Corey = Age of Amy - 2 Years  Age of James = Age of Corey + 1 Year Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:  Age of Jackson = 5 + 4 = 9 Years old  Therefore, Jackson is 9 years old.
Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, and he is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in 40 seconds (since Lee is 2 seconds faster). Now, if Gerald has improved his speed by 10%, that means he can now run 400 meters with obstacles in 36 seconds ( since 10% of 40 = 4 seconds). So, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in 36 seconds.
Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer conigs than the combined number of dogs and cats. So if there are 60 dogs, then there must be 72 cats (since there are twice as many cats as dogs). Therefore, the total number of animals in the neighborhood is 60 + 72 = 132.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students, 100 are boys and 100 are girls.  Out of the boys, 2/5 are in the Scouts, so there are 40 boys in the Scouts.  Therefore, there are 60 boys who are not in the Scouts (100 - 40).  Now, we know that out of the girls, 2/3 are in the Scouts, so there are 67 girls in the Scouts (100 x 2/3 = 67).  Therefore, there are 33 girls who are not in the Scouts (100 - 67).  So, there are 33 girls who are not in the Scouts.
"Response:  If Harry slept for nine hours last night and his friend James slept for two-thirds of that time (i.e., 9/3 = 3), then we can calculate how many more hours Harry slept than James as follows:   
Harry slept for 9 hours - James slept for 3 hours = 6 hours  
So, Harry slept 6 hours more than James."
Response:  We know that when Freda cooks tomatoes in a box and loses half of their volume. So if she uses 40 grams of tomatoes to make each serving, then she will use three times 40 grams = 120 grams of tomatoes for one serving of salsa. Since there are 32 ounces in a cup, we can convert the amount of salsa from ounces to grams as follows: 32 oz x 28 g/oz = 904 grams. Therefore, Freda used 904 / 120 = 7.5 pounds (or 3.4 kilograms) of tomatoes to make the last batch of salsa.
Response:  In the first 15 minutes of congestion (from time = 0 to 15), 20 cars passed through the bottleneck. Since there were initially 30 cars on the highway, this means that 5 cars did not pass through the bottleneck during this time (since 20 > 30). Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the bottleneck in the remaining 15 minutes is equal to 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
Response:  Mary has already put two plants in each of her 40 windows, so she has used up 80 plants (2 x 40 = 80). Then, she wants to give away one plant from every cornice, which means she will use up another 40 plants (40 / 1 = 40). So, in total, Mary will have 80 + 40 = 120 plants left after giving them away.
Response:  We know that the first friend pressed the bell 20 times before Jerome opened the door. So, the total number of rings is 20. Now, we are told that the second friend pressed the bell for 1/4 more than the first friend, which means they pressed it 25 times (since 1/4 of 20 is 5). Therefore, the total number of rings so far is 20 + 5 = 25. Next, we are told that the third friend pressed the bell 10 times more than the second friend, which means they pressed it 35 times ( since 10 times 5 is 50, and 50 - 25 = 35). Finally, we are told that the fourth friend pressed the bell 60 times. So, the total number of rings is 25 + 35 + 60 = 110.
Response:  If he has to read 4 pages of his science book, 20 pages of his social studies book, 7 pages of his history book, and 8 pages of his geography book, then the total number of pages he needs to read is: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages. Since he only had one day (Monday) to complete the reading, he needs to read an average of 39/5 = 7.8 pages per day.
"Response: 
* At breakfast (colazione), John drinks one glass of water. So, he has drunk 1 bicchiere d'acqua.
* At lunchtime (pranzo), John also drinks one glass of water. Therefore, he has drunk an additional 1 bicchiere d'acqua.
* In the evening (cena), John drinks another glass of water. Hence, he has consumed 1 more bicchiere d'acqua.
* On weekends (fine settimana), John likes to relax and have a drink before bedtime. Assuming he drinks only one glass of water during this time as well, we can add it to his total consumption for the week. This means that John has drunk a total of 5 bicchieri d'acqua throughout the week."
"Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city with fog. So, if we divide the diameter of the city (in miles) by 3, we get the time it will take for the fog to cover the entire city:

Diameter of city = 42 miles
Time to cover entire city = Diameter of city / 3 = 42 miles / 3 = 14 minutes
Therefore, it will take approximately 14 minutes for the bank of fog to cover the entire city."
Response:  Poppy has put 25% of the pieces (a quarter) on the board, so there are 75% of the pieces left. Then, her mother puts another 33% of the remaining pieces on the board, which means that there are now 67% of the pieces left. Therefore, there are still 33% of the original 1000 pieces left in the puzzle.
Response:  If Cody can eat three times more biscuits than Amir, that means Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 biscuits. So together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 biscuits.
Response:  The volume of each box is given as 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches. Since there are 3 boxes, the total volume of all the boxes is 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches.
Response:  We know that Frankie watched an hour-long program every Monday and Tuesday night after finishing his homework. So he watched 2 hours of TV on those nights. On Wednesday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour-long program followed by a 30-minute program. Therefore, he watched a total of 3 hours of TV on Wednesday. On Thursday, he stayed up late for the weekend, so he didn't watch any TV. And on Friday, he watched two hour-long programs. Thus, he watched a total of 4 hours of TV on Friday. Now let's calculate how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday: Total TV time on Wednesday = 3 hours (as mentioned above) Number of 30-minute episodes = Total TV time / Time per episode (in minutes) Time per episode = 30 minutes (since it was a 30-minute program) Therefore, Frankie watched 3 hours / 30 minutes per episode = 10 30-minute episodes of TV on Wednesday.
Response:  Last year, Henry made x biscuits. This year, he wants to make twice that amount (2x). When he finishes cooking, he realizes he has made 15 more biscuits than he wanted (15 > x), so x = 135. Therefore, Henry made 135 biscuits last year.
Response:  If someone buys $10 worth of gasoline (10 gallons x $3/gallon = $30), and they get a $20 rebate from the company, then they will have $50 left ($30 + $20 = $50). So, after the rebate, they will have $50 - $30 = $20.
Response:  We know that both Marcell and Beatrice have found the same number of fruit roll-ups (let's call it x). Since they are competing to see who can eat more, we can assume that Beatrice has eaten all of her fruit roll-ups before Marcell did. Therefore, the length of Beatrice's fruit roll-up is twice as long as its width (since it is wide enough for two times its length). So, the area of Beatrice's fruit roll-up is equal to 2x x 2 = 4x square units.  Similarly, Marcell's fruit roll-up has an area of 3x x 14 = 42x square units.  Now, let's find out how many fruit roll-ups each person has eaten in total. The total area of both fruit roll-ups is equal to the sum of their individual areas: 4x + 42x = 86x square units.  Finally, since they started with the same number of fruit roll-ups (x), we can set up the equation: x / 86 = (4x) / 86 = (3x) / 86. Solving for x, we get: x = 50. So, Beatrice has eaten 100 fruit roll-ups (twice as much as Marcell), and Marcell has eaten 50 fruit roll-ups.
Response:  We know that the boat took in two liters of water for every three meters it rowed towards the shore. So if it was rowing at a speed of 20 feet (which is equal to 6 meters), then it would take in 12 liters of water (2 x 3 = 6). Now we are told that it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so the time taken to row 6 meters would be half of that, or 8 seconds. Therefore, the amount of water taken in by the boat when Julia reached the shore is 12 + 8 = 20 liters.
Response:  Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons per day, there will be a total of 8 lessons per day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/teacher).  If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, then it will be cleaned a total of 8 x 3 = 24 times per day.
Response:  After 15 days, if Ryan has planted 2 flowers per day, he will have planted a total of 30 flowers (2 x 15 = 30). If 5 of them did not grow, then the number of flowers that grew is 30 - 5 = 25. Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan will have 25 grown flowers in his garden.
Response:  We know that the number of photos in Jamal's phone is six times more than the number of photos in Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone can hold 50 photos, then Jamal's phone can hold 6 x 50 = 300 photos. Now we are told that the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold is equal to 50 times the number of birds in the photo of Jamal's ducks at the zoo. Therefore, if there are n birds in the photo of Jamal's ducks at the zoo, then Brittany's phone can hold at most 50n photos. Since Jamal has 1800 photos, and each photo contains 9 birds (as stated in the problem), then the number of birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo is 1800 / 9 = 200 birds.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has 15 pieces of wood (10 x 2"" x 4"" + 5 x 4"" x 10""). The total cost of these pieces is $150 ($10 x 10 + $16 x 5). If she sells them all together, her revenue will be equal to the total cost of the wood plus any additional costs associated with selling it. So, her revenue can be calculated as follows: Revenue = Total Cost + Commission or other expenses. In this case, let's assume there are no additional expenses. Therefore, Sasha's revenue from selling all the wood will be: Revenue = $150 + $0 = $150."
"Response:  We know that Katy used a ratio of 7:13 for making coffee, which means she used 7 parts of sugar to every 13 parts of water. Therefore, if she used a total of 120 cucchiaini (or teaspoons) of both sugar and water, we can calculate the number of cucchiaini of sugar as follows:

Number of cucchiaini of sugar = Total amount of sugar x Ratio of sugar to water
= 120 x 7/13
= 56 cucchiaini of sugar
Therefore, Katy used approximately 56 cucchiaini of sugar to make her coffee."
Response:  If John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, he will buy a total of 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John has paid a total of $360. Therefore, John has paid $360 to buy shoes for all three of his children.
"Response:  We know that in the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles was 10 (2 x 5).  On the second day, we are told that ""others"" containers arrived at the port, and the total number of vehicles became 30. So, if we assume that all these additional containers contained 5 vehicles each, then the total number of containers imported on the second day is:

Number of containers = Total number of vehicles / Number of vehicles per container
= 30 / 5
= 6

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day was 6."
"Response:  We know that Adrien's salary was $120,000 four years ago (since it increased by 40%). So, if Adrien and Lylah's salaries have increased simultaneously, we can set up the equation:
Salary of Adrien = x + y
where x is the original salary of Adrien ($60,000) and y is the increase in his salary over time (40%). Therefore, Adrien's current salary is:
Adrien's current salary = $60,000 + (40%) = $80,000
Now, let's find out what percentage increase Lylah received:
Lylah's new salary = Salary of Lylah before + Percentage increase
= $50,000 + (30%)
= $65,000
So, Lylah's salary has increased by 30%. Now, we need to calculate how much Adrien's salary has increased since then:
Adrien's new salary = Old salary + New salary - Original salary
= $80,000 + ($65,000 - $60,000)
= $80,000 + $5,000
= $85,000
Therefore, Adrien's total salary after four years is $85,000, and Lylah's total salary after four years is $65,000."
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 blocks of paper per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he uses 8 blocks of paper per month. Since each block has 30 sheets of paper, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper per month (8 blocks x 30 sheets/block).
Response:  We know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Therefore, she has a total of 13 (5 + 8) fruits. Now, we are told that Kael doubled the number of apples that Morisette brought, so he brought twice as many apples as Morisette did. This means that Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Additionally, since Kael also brought half of the oranges that Morisette brought, he brought 1/2 x 8 = 4 oranges. In total, then, both Morisette and Kael brought 13 + 10 + 4 = 27 fruits to the party.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept for 6 hours on Tuesday and 4 hours on Wednesday. Therefore, her total sleep time for the week was: 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 hours.
Response:  If Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, she will have covered a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Then, if she runs at 8 kilometers per hour after that, she will cover a distance of 8 x 4 = 32 kilometers. To find out how many miles she can cover in 7 hours, we need to convert the distance she covers at 8 kilometers per hour from kilometers to miles. There are 1.60934 kilometers in a mile, so: Distance = 32 km / 1.60934 = 20.5 miles Therefore, Rosie can cover 20.5 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jennie started helping her mom at work, there were x letters that needed to be stamped. She put stamps on one-third of these letters (x/3). So, after she finished working, there were 30 letters with stamps and x - 30 = y letters without stamps. Therefore, when Jennie started, there were y letters in the stack of already stamped letters.
Response:  Julia had none before she bought the new package of spoons because she realized she didn't have any. Then, after buying the new package, she used three spoons to taste her stew. Later, when setting the table, she had a total of 12 spoons (including the ones she already had). So, the number of spoons in the new package that Julia bought is: 12 - 3 = 9.
Response:  We know that Dylan had to have both chicken and fish sausages for his sandwiches at the party. So he bought 38 chicken sausages plus 6 fish sausages, which is equal to 44 sausages in total. Therefore, Dylan bought 44 sausages in all.
Response:  If Amy has made 20 more friends than Lily, then Amy has 80 friends (Lily + 20). So, together, Amy and Lily have 130 friends (80 + 50).
Response:  Mother Well sells eggplants for $3 each, peppers for $5 each, and oranges for $7 each. Dillon is sent to buy 4 eggplants, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. So, he will pay:  For 4 eggplants = $3 x 4 = $12  For 20 peppers = $5 x 20 = $100  For 10 oranges = $7 x 10 = $70 Total cost = $12 + $100 + $70 = $292
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of minutes spent by doctors and patients in the hospital daily. As mentioned in the question, an average patient spends 24 minutes with each doctor. Therefore, the total time spent by patients in the hospital is:

Total time = Number of patients x Time spent per patient
= 500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient
= 12,000 minutes/day

Next, we need to calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these visits. Based on the information provided, the doctors pay $150 per hour, and the patients pay $200 per hour. So, the total revenue generated by the hospital can be calculated as follows:

Revenue = Total time x Rate charged per minute
= 12,000 minutes/day x ($150/hour)
= $180,000 per day

Therefore, based on the given information, the hospital generates $180,000 in revenue every day from these medical consultations."
Response:  Firstly, we know that 60 workers were hired to make toys in Santa Claus' big warehouse. Then, after some children threw up on them, 20 of these workers retired (3/4 of the initial number). Next, another 10 workers retired after being kicked by the children (additional 10%). So, finally, there are remaining 30 workers who have not retired (60 - 20 - 10 = 30).
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500.  In June, he spent $60 less than in May, so he spent $440 in June. Therefore, his total expenses for those two months are: $500 + $440 = $940.
Response:  Pam made two roller coaster rides, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 biglietti.  Fred made four roller coaster rides, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 biglietti. Then, they both rode the sleigh twice, for a total of 2 x 6 = 12 biglietti each. Therefore, in total, they used 12 + 12 + 24 = 58 biglietti that day.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Walter walked for 6 miles. On Tuesday (Martes), he walked 6 times more than he did on Monday, so he walked 6 x 6 = 36 miles. Therefore, his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 - 36 = 5 miles. So, Walter walked 5 miles on Wednesday.
Response:  If Tom does 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then he pays:  $15 x 4 = $60 per month. So, in one year (12 months), Tom will pay: $60 x 12 = $720.
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 videogiochi and he lost 5 before the comparison with Bobby. So, Brian has 20 - 5 = 15 videogiochi left. Now, we are told that Bobby has 5 times less than 3 times the number of videogiochi that Brian has. In other words, Bobby has 5 × 3 = 15 videogiochi. Therefore, Bobby has 15 videogiochi.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in total and two-thirds of them are located in Scotland (which is equal to 1/3). So, the number of unicorns in Scotland = 27 x 1/3 = 9 unicorns. Since two-thirds of these unicorns are female (which is equal to 2/3), the number of female unicorns in Scotland = 9 x 2/3 = 6 female unicorns. Therefore, there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy: Dolci x $7,50 = $15,00 Patatine x $1,50 = $3,00 Biscotti x $1,00 = $3,00 Total cost of items = $19,00 Now, let's add the delivery charge: Delivery charge = $20% of $19,00 = $3,80 So, the total cost of her order including delivery is: $19,00 + $3,80 = $22,80
Response:  If Mark completed the first test with 75 questions in 5 hours (or 375 minutes), he would have taken 375/5 = 75 minutes to complete each question.  Since he took 8 hours to complete the first test, he must have spent 8 x 75 = 600 minutes on it.  Therefore, he left 25 questions incomplete.  Similarly, if he took 6 hours to complete the second test with 100 questions, he must have spent 6 x 75 = 450 minutes on it. So, he left 55 questions incomplete.
Response:  We know that there are four times as many pink gummies as blue ones, so if there are 12 blue gummies, then there are 48 pink gummies (since 4 x 12 = 48).
"Response:  We know that out of 20 cars available for rent, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the remaining are semi-automatic. So, we can write this as follows:
Automatic = 12
Manual = 4
Semi-automatic = x (where x is the number of cars that are semi-automatic)
Now, we need to find the value of x. To do so, we can use the following equation:
x = Total - Automatic - Manual
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
x = 20 - 12 - 4
x = 4
So, there are 4 cars that are semi-automatic. Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars
= 4/20
= 0.2 or 20%
Therefore, the answer is 20%."
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and we have to find out how many worker bees (api operaie) there are. According to the problem, there are twice as many workers as drones (males), so if there are x drone...
Response:  If Jordan spends two hours playing video games every day, that means he spends 14 hours (2 hours/day x 7 days/week) playing video games per week.  Now, let's calculate how much money Jordan earns from his part-time job. Since he works for $10/hour, he earns $10 x 10 = $100 per week working part-time. So, if Jordan spends less time gaming and more time working, he would earn an additional $100 per week. Therefore, Jordan would earn a total of $100 + $14 = $114 per week.
Response:  Latte = $2 Uova = $3 Lampadine = $3 Tazze = $3 Trappole = $4 Total cost of non-food items = $15 (Note: I have rounded off the prices to the nearest whole number for simplicity.) Now, let's calculate the tax amount: Tax rate = 10% Tax amount = $15 x 10% = $1.50 So, the total cost of everything is: Total cost = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money each customer will pay for cleaning services. Since there are three customers so far and they will all require two candles and one package of cloths, the total amount paid by these customers is:

3 customers x $2 per candle = $6
3 customers x $5 per package of clothes = $15
Total amount paid by existing customers = $6 + $15 = $21
Now, let's assume that Kim will get five new customers this week, and each of them will also require two candles and one package of clothes. So, the total amount paid by new customers will be:

5 new customers x $2 per candle = $10
5 new customers x $5 per package of clothes = $25
Total amount paid by new customers = $10 + $25 = $35
Now, let's add up the total amount paid by both existing and new customers:

Total amount paid by all customers = $21 (existing) + $35 (new) = $56
Since Kim has no expenses other than the cost of candles and cloths, her profit will be:

Profit = Total amount paid by all customers - Cost of goods sold = $56 - ($2 x 10) = $56 - $20 = $36
Therefore, Lucas will make a profit of $36 every week."
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land and there are 100 ananas per hectare. So, he can collect 1000 ananas (10 x 100) per hectare every 3 months. Therefore, if we divide this number by 4 (since there are 4 seasons in a year), John can collect 250 ananas (1000 / 4) per season. Since there are 4 seasons in a year, John can collect a total of 1000 ananas (250 x 4) in one year.
Response:  The first box of Legos had 500 pieces, and since it was thrown onto the floor along with the other boxes, Johnny has collected all 500 pieces.  Now let's consider the second box. Since it had three times as many pieces as the first box, it must have contained 1500 pieces (3 x 500 = 1500). And since Johnny has already collected 500 pieces from the first box, he now has a total of 2000 pieces (500 + 1500 = 2000). Finally, there is the third box, which contains a quarter of the number of pieces in the second box. Therefore, if the second box contained 1500 pieces, then the third box must contain 375 pieces (1500 / 4 = 375). So, in total, Johnny has collected 2000 + 375 = 2375 pieces of Legos.
Response:  At first, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, half of those bees return within the next 6 hours (since she sees twice as many bees leaving as returning). So, at this point, Debra has seen a total of 30 + 15 = 45 bees leave the hive. However, since two more bees have left than she initially saw, that means there are actually 2 more bees that have left the hive but haven't yet returned. Therefore, the number of bees that Debra sees return to the hive within the last 6 hours is 45 - 2 = 43 bees.
Response:  The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. So, if Brittany's mother gave $8 to the cashier, that means she bought one adult ticket and one child ticket. Therefore, the amount she gave to the cashier is: $12 + $10 = $22.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, Charlie has 3x friends.  Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, he has 4x = 16 friends on Facebook. Therefore, James has 16 - 3x = 13 friends on Facebook.
Response:  First, we need to find out how long it takes for Steve to reach home from school. Since he lives 5 km away and can ride his bike at 140 m/min, it will take him 5 km / 140 m/min = 35 minutes to get home. Now, let's find out how long it will take Tim to reach home from school. Since he lives 3 km away and can ride his skateboard at 264 ft/min, it will take him 3 km / 264 ft/min = 11 minutes to get home. So, if they start racing at the same time, Tim will finish first and arrive home before Steve does. Therefore, the answer is 35 - 11 = 24 minutes.
"Response:  On day one, there were 5 people who came to inflate their tires. Each person paid $0.25 for each tire they had inflated, so the total amount of money earned that day was:

$0.25 x 5 = $1.25

On the second day, there were 3 people who came to inflate their tires, and 1 person who came to inflate the tire of their tricycle. So, the total amount of money earned that day was:

$0.25 x 3 + $0.25 x 1 = $0.75

On the third day, there was only one person who came to inflate their tire, and it was on a monocycle. So, the total amount of money earned that day was:

$0.25 x 1 = $0.25

Therefore, the total amount of money earned over the three days was:

$1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25"
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of cookies and each package has six cookies inside, then he will buy a total of 60 cookies (10 x 6 = 60). Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl will pay a total of $6 for all the cookies ($60 / 0.10 = 60). So, if he pays with a $10 bill, he will receive $4 in change ($10 - $6 = $4).
Response:  When Dave first bought the bag of french fries, there were 14 fries in it. Then, the seagull ate half of them (7). Next, three pigeons came and ate 3 each (9 total). After that, a rat stole two-thirds of what was left (5). Finally, ants took one more (5 remaining). So, when Dave originally bought the bag of fries, there were 14 fries in it.
Response:  Monday, Tuesday and Friday, Kimo has three one-hour classes per day. Wednesday and Thursday, he has two two-hour classes per day. In total, there are 16 weeks of school in a semester. So, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes per week? Well, if we divide the number of hours he spends attending classes per week by the number of weeks in a semester, we get... (calculate)...hours per week!
Response:  We know that Bill has to make 300 sandwiches (panini), 120 chocolate-filled pastries (croissants), and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll of bread is 10 cm long, each croissant is 15 cm long, and each baguette is 90 cm long (half a meter). If we stack all these items one after another, it would take Bill approximately 4 hours and 20 minutes (4:20) to arrange them in a row. Therefore, the answer is 4:20.
"Response:  The zookeeper needs to order bananas for two months. For each month, he needs to provide bananas to all the monkeys in the zoo. So, the total number of bananas needed for two months is:

Monkeys that need bananas per month:
Gorillas (400) + Baboons (100) = 500

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 500 bananas every two months."
Response:  Blake runs back and forth 15 times, covering a distance of 100 meters x 2 = 200 meters.  Kelly runs once towards the 40-yard line and then backwards, covering a distance of 40 yards x 2 = 80 meters. Therefore, the total distance covered by Blake is twice that of Kelly, so the winner is ahead by a distance of 200 - 80 = 120 meters.
Response:  Raphael bought 4 pens that cost $1.5 each, so he spent $6 for the pens. He also bought 2 notebooks that cost $4 each, so he spent $8 for the notebooks. Finally, he bought a circle of paper for obligations that cost $20. Therefore, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  At first, Finn sees 11 frogs swimming in the pond. Then he sees 6 of them come out from under a lily pad and another 2 hide under a rock. So, at this point, Finn can see 11 + 6 = 17 frogs in the pond.
Response:  On Monday (martedì), the water level was 7 meters and a half (metri e mezzo). This means that the water level increased of 2 meters from Monday to Tuesday (mercoledì). So, the water level on Tuesday is 9 meters (7 + 2 = 9). Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday (mercoledì) is 9/3 = 3 meters.
Response:  Anakin has taken 3 fish, so Locsin must have taken at least 7 fish to surpass him (since he took 3 more than Anakin). Therefore, Locsin has taken 7 fish.
Response:  After 1 month, the price of the bag of tickets will increase by 20%, so it will be $24 (20 x 1.2).  After 2 months, the price will increase again by 20%, so it will be $28.80 ($24 x 1.2 x 1.2 = $28.80).  We can continue this process for each additional two months until we reach 36 months.  Therefore, after 36 months, the price of the bag of tickets will be $75.92 ($20 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 = $75.92).
Response:  We know that one action figure costs $5 and one toy car costs $4. So, if we have 3 action figures and 5 toy cars, their total value is: 3 x $5 = $15 + 5 x $4 = $20. Now, let's add the babydoll to this amount. Since it cost as much as 3 action figures, its value is also $15. Therefore, the total value of all the toys in the room is $15 + $20 = $35.
Response:  If Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she will save 3 hours of work per year (or $35/hour) by not hiring an accountant. So, if she works for $35/hour and saves 3 hours per year, she will earn $105 less per year ($35 x 3 = $105). Therefore, if she assumes the accountant's fee is $90, she will have $15 left over after paying the accountant ($90 - $105 = -$15).  So, the correct answer is -$15.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has a total of $1500 to spend on her gift and clothes. Then she spent $1090 on the new computer with monitor, keyboard, and mouse. So far, she has spent $1090 + $157 = $1247. Now let's calculate how much money is left for clothes. $1500 - $1247 = $253. Therefore, Elvira will have $253 left over for her clothes.
Response:  If Sandra has to make 15 Spanish omelets for the school fundraiser and she needs 3 eggs per omelet, then she will need 15 x 3 = 45 eggs in total. Since she gets 9 eggs from her neighbor every time she watches the little girl, she will have to do it 45/9 = 5 times. So, Sandra will have to babysit the little girl 5 times to get enough eggs to make all the Spanish omelets needed for the fundraiser.
"Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke and in two years, their combined age will be 28 years. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Seth's age = 2 x Brooke's age + 2
Now we are given that Brooke's age is 16 years old. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:
Seth's age = 2 x 16 + 2
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Seth's age = 32 years
Therefore, Seth is 32 years old."
"Response:  If Jimmy has $2 more than double what Ethel has, then we can write an equation as follows:
Jimmy = 2 x (Ethel + 2)
Substituting the value given in the question for Ethel ($8), we get:
Jimmy = 2 x ($8 + 2)
= 2 x $10
= $20
Therefore, Jimmy has $20."
Response:  If Pancho walks 30 kilometers (or miles) per day, then he walks a total of 210 kilometers (or miles) per week (7 days). However, as stated in the question, he only walks 10 miles (or kilometers) on Saturday. So, his weekly walking distance is: 210 km - 10 km = 200 km (or miles). Therefore, Pancho camminas approximately 200 kilometers (or miles) per week.
"Response:  The total cost of each uniform is equal to the cost of the hat plus twice the cost of the jacket plus the cost of the pants. So, if we call the cost of the hat x, the cost of the jacket 3x and the cost of the pants 2x, then the total cost of each uniform is:

Total Cost = x + (3x) + (2x) = 6x

So, the cost of each uniform is $6x."
Response:  We know that there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so we have 8 x 80 = 640 legs from spiders alone. Then, there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, giving us 90 x 6 = 540 legs from insects. Finally, there are 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, which gives us 3 x 10 = 30 legs from these creatures. Therefore, in total, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
Response:  We know that there are four birds at Cape Cod (Ci sono cuatro uccelli al Capo).  Sally Blue has three years more than her mother (Sally Blu ha tre anni in piu' di nonna Rossa), so her age is 3 + 2 = 5 years old (Sally Quattro ha cinque anni).  We also know that Nonna Rossa has twice as many years as Sally Blue (Nonna Rossa ha il doppio degli anni di Sally Blu), so she is 2 x 5 = 10 years old (Nonna Rossa ha dieci anni).  Now we come to Sally Thirty-two (Sally Trenta-due): if she has the same age as Sally Forty-two (Sally Quaranta-due), then she is 42 - 32 = 10 years old too (Sally Trenta-due ha undici anni). Finally, we have Sally Fourty-two (Sally Quaranta-due), who is 8 years older than Sally Thirty-two (Sally Trenta-due), so she is 8 + 10 = 18 years old (Sally Quaranta-due ha diciotto anni). Therefore, the total age of all four birds is 5 + 10 + 11 + 18 = 64 years old (L'eta complessiva de I quadri è di 64 anni).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total monthly payments for all of Jessica's debts. The total monthly payment is equal to the minimum payment for each debt plus any additional amount that Jessica wants to pay above the minimum. So, let's calculate the total monthly payment as follows: Minimum payment for student loans = $300 x 3 = $900 Minimum payment for credit card = $200 x 12 = $2400 Total monthly payment = $900 + $2400 = $3300 Now, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will have to pay an extra amount of $3300 x 50% = $1650 per year. Therefore, the total amount that Jessica will have to pay in a year is $3300 (minimum payment) + $1650 (extra amount) = $5000 per year.
Response:  Since there are 60 potatoes to be peeled and chopped, it will take approximately the same time to peel each one as it does to chop them. Therefore, if it takes Billy about 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel a single potato (since he can peel 60 in total), and about 5 seconds to chop each peeled potato, then it will take him altogether 60 x 1 min 30 sec + 60 x 5 sec = 39 minutes and 20 seconds to prepare all the potatoes for the family barbecue.
"Response:  We know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade for $3 per gallon of lemons and $2 per cup of sugar. They also charge $0.50 per glass of lemonade. Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up an equation to represent this information: Lemons Cost = Profit - Sugar Cost - Glasses Sold x Price per Glass  Substituting the given values into this equation, we get: Lemons Cost = $25 - ($2 x Number of Gallons) - (Number of Glasses x $0.50)  Now we need to find out how many gallons Juan and Carlos sold. According to the question, they sold 20 bicchieri per gallon. So, if they sold X gallons, then they sold X x 20 bicchieri. Therefore, we can substitute this value in place of ""Number of Gallons"" in the above equation: Lemons Cost = $25 - ($2 x X x 20) - (X x $0.50)  Simplifying the expression, we get: Lemons Cost = $25 - $40 - $10 = $0  This means that Juan and Carlos did not spend any money on lemons!"
Response:  We know that there are 240 Asian people in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is 240 - 80 = 160. Since the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60, we can conclude that there are 60 girls in the Chinese team. Therefore, the answer is 60.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends $150 for rent (a quarter of his salary). Then he spends $3000 for fuel (a third of his salary). Next, he gives away half of what remains to his charity organization ($3000 x 2 = $6000). Now, he has $6000 - $150 - $3000 = $4850 left after all these expenses and donations. Therefore, Zaid will have $4850 remaining after paying all his bills and making those donations.
"Response:  We know that:
Rani has 10 crabs more than Monica (Rani = Monica + 10).
Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo (Bo - Monica = 4).
Bo has 40 crabs (Bo = 40).
Now we can calculate the total number of crabs that the three have together:
Rani has 10 + 4 = 14 crabs more than Bo.
So, the total number of crabs that Rani, Monica, and Bo have together is:
Rani + Monica + Bo = 14 + 40 + 4 = 68 crabs."
Response:  First week (5 hours x $10/hour) = $50 Second week (8 hours x $10/hour) = $80 Total earnings in first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130
Response:  We know that there are 80 students in total who voted in class and the winner obtained 3/4 of the votes. So, we can write an equation as follows: Winner's votes = Total number of votes x (3/4) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Winner's votes = 80 x (3/4) = 60 Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.
Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white garlands and 200 gills of pink roses which is five times the number of white garlands. So, we need to find out how many red roses Sandra ordered and then multiply it by four to get the total number of red roses she wants.  Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 4 x 36 = 144 red roses to Sandra within 5 hours.
Response:  Three years ago, Mark was 5 + 3 = 8 years old. Now, Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 8 + 2 = 10 years old. Therefore, Jean has 10 years.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that one of the teams has four members who can run 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds each. Therefore, their total time for running 400 meters is:

Time = (Number of members) x (Time taken to complete 1 lap)
= (4) x (55)
= 220 seconds

Now, let's consider the other team. We are told that their first member takes 60 seconds to complete 400 meters, and every subsequent member is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the time taken by their second member to complete 400 meters is:

Time = (Time taken by first member) + (Time taken by second member - Time taken by first member)
= (60) + (3 - 60)
= 97 seconds

We can repeat this process for all four members of the second team, using the times given in the question:

Third member: Time = 94 seconds
Fourth member: Time = 91 seconds

Therefore, the total time taken by the second team to complete 400 meters is:

Total time = (Time taken by first member) + (Time taken by second member) + (Time taken by third member) + (Time taken by fourth member)
= 97 + 94 + 91 + 91
= 463 seconds

Finally, we need to find out how many seconds ahead of the other team the first team is. Since they completed the race in 220 seconds, and the second team took 463 seconds to complete it, we can calculate the difference between their times as follows:

Difference = Total time of first team - Total time of second team
= 220 - 463
= -243 seconds

So, the first team is 243 seconds ahead of the second team in a 400-meter race."
"Response:  The probability of getting an odd number is $ \frac{1}{2} $.  Therefore, the probability of getting two consecutive odd numbers is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.  Now, let's calculate the probability of getting three or more consecutive odd numbers:
$$\begin{aligned} P(three\text{ or more consecutive odd numbers}) &= 1 - P(two\text{ consecutive odd numbers}) \\&= 1 - \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \\&= \frac{3}{4} \end{aligned}$$
So, the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 in six throws is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$."
Response:  If Jenna and her mother have collected half of their mother's apples, then they together have collected half of 20 apples = 10 apples.
Response:  We know that there are three groups of rodents and each group has an equal number of rodents. So, if there are x rodents in total, then there must be 3x rodents in each group. Since we have given 6 pieces of straw to each rat, there are 6x pieces of straw distributed among all the rats. Similarly, since we have given 5 pieces of straw to each cricket, there are 5x pieces of straw distributed among all the crickets. Finally, since we have given 20 pieces of straw to the rabbits, there are 20x pieces of straw distributed among them. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw distributed is: 6x + 5x + 20x = 41x. Now, since none of these animals are sharing their straw with each other, we can conclude that each animal has its own share of straw. So, the number of rodents in each group is: 3x / 41x = 1/13. Therefore, there are 13 rodents in each group or 39 rodents in total (since they are divided into three groups).
"Response:  If Mandy pays $100 to Benedict after 3 months with an interest rate of 2%, then we can calculate the amount as follows:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $100 x 2% x 3/12
= $6

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106 ($100 + $6)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total profit of the merchant is $400 and he sold all the bags of corn at $30 each. So, the number of bags sold can be calculated as follows: Total Profit = Number of Bags Sold x Price per Bag $400 = (Number of Bags Sold) x $30 $30 = Number of Bags Sold Therefore, the merchant has sold 13 bags of corn ($400 / $30).
Response:  The three friends spent $20.25 for the fair tickets. Since they paid $4.50 less than the total amount spent on food and rides, the total amount spent on food and rides is $20.25 + $4.50 = $24.75. Therefore, if they divided all the expenses equally among themselves, each friend would pay $24.75 / 3 = $8.25.
Response:  If John collects fish for 3 hours and can catch 2 fish per minute, then he will have collected 60 fish in total (3 hours x 2 fish/minute = 60 fish).
Response:  If one goose needs to eat 1.5 kg of insects per week, then ten geese will need 15 kg (10 x 1.5) of insects per week. So, they have to eat 2.25 kg of insects per day (15 kg / 7 days).
"Response: 
Tom has 50 trees initially. Every year he cuts down 2 trees, so after 10 years he will have cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees. Now, 30% of the remaining trees die every year, which means that in 10 years, 30% of 50 = 15 trees will die. So, the number of trees left after 10 years is 50 - 15 = 35 trees."
Response:  On Friday morning, the neighbors put 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's courtyard. Then, on Saturday morning, they took back one-third of these flamingos (6 flamingos), painted them white, and returned them to Sue's courtyard. Finally, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, at noon on Sunday, there were how many more pink plastic flamingos outside compared to the white ones?  Answer:  At noon on Sunday, there were 12 more pink plastic flamingos outside than white ones (18 - 6 = 12).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pastelles Violetta can buy with her budget of $20. We know that each pastelle costs $2, so...
Response:  We know that one pen costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30. So, if we want to find out how much 8 pens and 8 erasers together cost, we can multiply the price of each item by 8. Therefore, the total cost of 8 pens is $96 (8 x $1.20) and the total cost of 8 erasers is $24 (8 x $0.30).
"Response:  We have to distribute 200 kilograms of carrots among 40 restaurants. Since each restaurant will receive half a kilogram (or 500 grams) of carrots, we need to divide 200 kilograms by 40 restaurants. So, the number of kilograms that won't be used is:

$$ \therefore 200 kg - \frac{200 kg}{40} = 167 kg $$

Therefore, $167$ kilograms of carrots won't be used."
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in Soda. Of these, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. This means that the total number of adults (men + women) is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. Now, we need to find out how many children there are in Soda. Since the rest of the population consists of ""bambini,"" or children, we can assume that this group makes up the remaining portion of the population after subtracting the number of adults from the total number of inhabitants. Therefore, the number of children in Soda is equal to 23786 - 17509 = 6277. So, there are approximately 6277 children living in Soda."
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 cards and collected three times that amount, so she had 60 cards in total.  In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the previous month, so she had 40 cards in total.  In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as in the previous two months combined, so she had 80 cards in total. Therefore, Elaine has a total of 80 cards of Pokémon.
Response:  We know that Mark modifies an equal number of phrases for both editors each week (so let's call this number x). Since Editor B pays twice as much as Editor A, we can say that Editor A pays $x/2 per phrase and Editor B pays $2x per phrase.  Now, we are told that Mark earns $5 per 1000 phrases. So, if he modifies x phrases for Editor A and $2x phrases for Editor B, his total weekly earnings can be calculated as follows: Total weekly earnings = ($x/2) + ($2x) = $3x/2 + $4x = $7x/2 Mark's weekly earnings are $7x/2 dollars.
Response:  In the morning, he takes 5 secchi of water, which means he takes 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water.  In the afternoon, he takes 6 secchi of water, which means he takes 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water. So in total, he takes 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water every day.
Response:  If John wins the prize and gets an increase of 5%, his weekly salary will be increased by $100 (5% of $2000). So, he will now earn $2100 per week. Since he received the prize on the first day of the year, he will have earned $104,200 ($2100 x 52) in that year. Therefore, John has earned a total of $104,700 ($104,200 + $5000) in that year.
Response:  If each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, then we can calculate how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces in total as follows:  Barrels of wine = Tons of grapes x Number of acres x Yield per ton of grapes  Barrels of wine = 5 tons/acre x 10 acres x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels/year So, according to the question, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine every year.
Response:  First day: he had one sandwich with two slices of cheese. Second day: he had an omelet with three slices of cheese and another sandwich with two slices of cheese. Third day: he had an omelet with four slices of cheese and another sandwich with two slices of cheese. Fourth day: he had pasta with eight slices of cheese. So, total number of slices of cheese used = 1 + 3 + 4 + 8 = 16 slices of cheese. Therefore, Carl has used 16 fettes of formaggio (or cheese).
Response:  At first, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, for a total of 32 pens. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, and 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag. How many pens does Janet have now? Total number of pens = Number of green pens + Number of yellow pens + Number of blue pens + Number of red pens. In this case, we can calculate it as follows: Total number of pens = 32 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 108 pens. So, Janet has 108 pens altogether.
Response:  We know that Brinley has already taken five tests and obtained the following scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To calculate his average score, we need to add these numbers together and divide by 5: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 459. Now, if he wants to have an average of 93 in the sixth test, he needs to get at least 459 - 93 = 366 points. Therefore, Brinley needs to obtain 366 or more points in the sixth test to achieve a mean of 93.
Response:  Firstly, he rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, which means he covered a total distance of 5 x 4 = 20 km/week. Then, he reduced to riding only twice a week but with a longer distance of 60 km/ride. So, he covered a total distance of 2 x 60 = 120 km in the third week. Therefore, Michael has covered a total distance of 20 + 120 = 140 km in four weeks.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 bars of chocolate and 80 candy apples. Each piece of chocolate weighs twice as much as an apple, so...

$$ \therefore {weight} = 2 \times {weight} \text{of} \space candy \space apples $$

So, the weight of the chocolates is $ 2 \times 80 = 160 grams$. Therefore, the total weight of the bag of sweets is $ 25 + 160 = 185 grams$."
Response:  On Monday (Rose went to the store), she bought 4 tarts.  On Tuesday (she went to another store), she bought three times as many tarts as she had bought on Monday. So, she bought 3 x 4 = 12 tarts.  On Wednesday (she went to yet another store), she bought 5 times as many tarts as she had bought on Tuesday. So, she bought 5 x 12 = 60 tarts. Therefore, after all three days, she has bought a total of 60 + 12 + 4 = 76 tarts.
Response:  We know that venti dozzine of cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half dozen plates sold at $6000 each. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Cost of 20 dozens = Total cost - ($6000 x 0.5)  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Cost of 20 dozens = $1200 - ($6000 x 0.5) = $1200 - $3000 = $900  Therefore, the cost of each cup is $900.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sara has after she finishes working as a babysitter and mows the lawn. We know that she earns $5 per time she watches the kids, so if she watches them four times, she will have earned $20 ($5 x 4). Additionally, her parents pay her $4 for each time she mows the lawn, so if she mows it twice, she will have earned $8 ($4 x 2). Therefore, Sara has a total of $28 ($20 + $8) after finishing both tasks.  Now, let's check how much money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes. The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of each pair of shoes is $20. To find out how many times Sara needs to do either task to afford the items, we can divide the cost of the item by the amount of money she has after finishing both tasks. In this case, dividing $30 / $28 gives us approximately 1.07 or about once and a quarter times. So, Sara needs to do either task (mowing the lawn or watching the kids) approximately 1.25 times to afford the jacket and shoes.
Response:  If there are x polli rossi, then the total number of uova produced per day is 3x + 5(2x). Since Jerry collects 42 uova everyday, we can set up the equation: 3x + 5(2x) = 42. Solving for x, we get: x = 10. So, Jerry has 10 polli rossi.
"Response:  First, we need to convert the length of the park from miles to kilometers. There are 1.60934 kilometers in one mile, so the length of the park is:

$$ L = \frac{1.5 \text {miles}}{1.60934} = 0.9378 \text{kilometers} $$
Next, we can calculate how long it takes Piace to walk along the park using the given speed:

$$ T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{0.9378 \text{kilometers}}{5 \text{km/h}} = 18.76 \text{hours} $$
Therefore, Piace spends $18.76$ hours walking along the park at a speed of $5\text{km/h}$."
Response:  On day one (Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store)...On day two...(Sloane counted 50 more customers than the previous day)...So, on day two, he counted 150 customers entering the store...On day three...If the total number of customers was 500, then on day three, Sloane counted 350 customers entering the store.
"Response:  If Jerry has two pools and both are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, then after 4 minutes, the small pool will have lost twice as much water as the large pool (since it is half the size). So, if the small pool had initially had x gallons of water, it will now have 2x gallons of water. Similarly, since the large pool had y gallons of water initially, it will now have 4y gallons of water. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

Small pool: 2x = original amount - 4minutes * 4gallons/minute
Large pool: 4y = original amount
Now we can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving the system of equations, we get:

x = 80
y = 160
So, the small pool currently has 80 gallons of water, and the large pool has 160 gallons of water."
Response:  The cost of the shoes is $320 and the belt costs $32, so together they total $352. Since Lori earns $8 per hour, she needs to work for hours to afford the items. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we can divide the total cost of the items by her hourly wage: $352 / $8 = 44 hours. So, Lori will need to work for 44 hours before she can afford the shoes and belt.
Response:  We know that $2000 was borrowed and an additional $200 (10%) will be paid as interest. So, the total amount to be repaid is $2200 ($2000 + $200). To calculate the monthly payment, we can use the formula: Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months. In this case, the number of months is 12. Therefore, the monthly payment is: $2200 / 12 = $165/month. Since Janeth has been paying for 10 months, the remaining balance until then is: Remaining Balance = Total Amount - Amount Paid = $2200 - ($165 x 10) = $1835.
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses and 7 daisies in the vase. Since each rose has 5 petals and each daisy has 6 petals, we can calculate the total number of petals as follows: Roses - 4 x 5 = 20 Dahlias - 7 x 6 = 42 Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is 20 + 42 = 62 petals. So, there are 62 fiori (flowers) in the vase.
Response:  Age of Adrian = 3 x age of Harriet = 3 x 21 = 63 Age of Harriet = half of Zack's age = half of 30 = 15 Age of Zack = 30 years old now. So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet and Zack is (63 + 15) / 3 = 48 years old.
Response:  We know that Naomi has obtained 68 points and Yuri has scored more than half of Naomi's score (which is equal to 34 points). Therefore, Yuri has obtained at least 34 + 68 = 102 points. Now we know that Brianna has scored more than Naomi but less than Yuri, so she has obtained between 68 and 102 points (inclusive). Finally, since Jojo hasn't scored as much as either Naomi or Brianna, he must have obtained fewer than 68 points. So, Jojo has obtained exactly 67 points.
Response:  The person has solved 3 crosswords in 10 minutes each = 3 x 10 = 30 minutes and 8 Sudokus in 5 minutes each = 8 x 5 = 40 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent playing these games is 70 minutes (30 + 40).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Celine has used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is equal to the initial capacity minus the amount used (120 - 90 = 30). Then, we are told that she has collected twice as much rainwater as was remaining in the tank. Therefore, if there were x liters of water left in the tank initially, then after collecting double that amount, there will be 2x liters of water left in the tank now. Substituting this value into our equation above gives us: 30 + 2(2x) = 120. Simplifying and solving for x, we get: x = 60 liters. So, there are 60 liters of water left in the tank now.
Response:  We know that Andy has 90 geraniums and 40 petunias. To find out how many flowers he has in total, we need to add these two numbers together. So, the total number of flowers is: 90 + 40 = 130. Therefore, Andy plants 130 flowers in total.
Response:  In the first year, the company spent $15,000 on advertising. Then, in the second year, it spent $\frac{1}{3}$ of that amount, which is $5,000 (since $\frac{1}{3} \times 15,000 = 5,000$). So, the total amount the company has spent on advertising for both years is $15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000$.
Response:  If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and pays $30/hour, he will pay $90 ($30 x 3) for his rental fee. Similarly, if Benji uses the raft for 5 hours and pays $18/hour, he will pay $90 ($18 x 5) for his rental fee as well. Therefore, the total amount they will pay together is $180 ($90 + $90).
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, then it will take half of that time (or 3 days) to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car. So, if he goes to Rochester by bus and comes back by car, he will have to spend 3 + 3 = 6 days for the entire trip. Therefore, the answer is 6 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that James has 40 cards of type water. After losing 8 of them, he has 40 - 8 = 32 cards of type water left. Now, when he buys 14 new cards of type grass, he adds these to his deck, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 cards in total. Since he already had 30 fire and 20 earth cards, nothing changes regarding those types. Therefore, the percentage of probability that a randomly chosen card is of type water after this process is:  Percentage = (Number of water cards / Total number of cards) x 100 = (46 / 96) x 100 = 48%
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the original burrito that Chad ordered. The price of the burrito base is $6.50 + (2 dollars for additional meat) = $8.50. Then, he added $1 for more cheese and $1 for avocado, so the total cost of his original order is $8.50 + $1 + $1 = $9.50. Next, he decided to add an extra $3 for fries and a drink, which brings the new total cost to $9.50 + $3 = $12.50. Finally, he used his $5 gift card at checkout, leaving him with a balance of $7.50. Therefore, Chad must pay $7.50 for his meal.
Response:  Kalinda can add 4 pieces to the puzzle in one minute, so her mother can also do it in one minute. Therefore, they will need $ \frac {360}{4} = 90$ minutes to complete the puzzle.
Response:  After two months, Ashlyn went to the farm and found that 30% of the small coconuts were ready for harvesting. So she took them home. When she returned two weeks later, 75% of the remaining coconuts were ready, so she collected them. Therefore, there were 25% of the original number of coconuts that were not yet ready for harvesting after two weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company. So, he pays $20,000 x 12 = $240,000 for all the cars together. Then, he pays 10% tax on each car, which is equal to $20,000 x 12 = $240,000. Finally, he pays an additional $1,000 registration fee for each car, so the total cost for all the cars including tax and registration fees would be $264,000 ($240,000 + $24,000). Therefore, the answer is $264,000.
Response:  On Monday (lunedì), Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so she has collected 5 + 20 = 25 shells.  On Tuesday (martedì), Kylie doubles her collection from Monday, so she collects 25 x 2 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there are 50 ants (formiche) in the garden, then Dax has found half of them, which is equal to 25 ants. So, the total number of ants in the garden is 50 + 25 = 75 ants.
"Response:  If there are 36 penguins taking sunbathing at first, and then one-third of them (12) jump into the ocean, we have:

Number of penguins remaining to take sunbathe = Total number of penguins - Number that jumped into the ocean
= 36 - 12
= 24

So, there are 24 penguins left to take sunbathe after some of them jumped into the ocean."
Response:  If Steve decides to eat double the amount of tomatoes than his girlfriend, that means he will eat 6 tomatoes per day (double 3).  Since each tomato plant can produce 3 tomatoes per week, Steve needs 2 vine plants to produce enough tomatoes for him to eat (6/3 = 2).
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend wants to have 4 slices of pizza. Since the pizzas are sold only cut into 8 pieces, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order: 20 / 8 = 5 So, John needs to order 5 pizzas.
Response:  If we buy 25 pens and use them to fill up other pens when the ink runs out, then at any given time, we will have 25 pens that are empty of ink but still have their bodies intact. So, after using all 25 pens, we will have a total of 25 empty pens. Therefore, the final number of pens we will have is 25.
Response:  Johnny had $20 + $10 = $30 to start with. Then he invested this amount and it tripled to $90 after one year. So, Johnny had $30 + $90 = $120 after one year.
"Response:  We know that:
Mary is younger than Joan (by 2 years)
Joan is older than Jessa (by 5 years)
Jessa is 20 years old
So we can write an equation based on this information:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Substituting Jessa's age from the problem into the second equation:
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25
Now we can find Mary's age using the first equation:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23
Therefore, the sum of their ages is:
Mary's age + Joan's age + Jessa's age = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68"
"Response:  We know that after the meeting, 30% of the students left through entrance A, so the number of students who left through entrances B and C is equal to 70% of the original number of students.  Since there are three entrances (A, B, and C), we can write:

Number of students who left through entrance C = (70% x 1000) / 3
= 466.67

Therefore, 466.67 students left through entrance C."
Response:  We know that James has 6 more caramelles than Robert (so James has 6 + 6 = 12 more caramelles than Robert).  Then we are told that John has twice as many caramelles as Robert, so John has 2 x 6 = 12 more caramelles than Robert. Finally, we are given that John has 54 caramelles, so we can subtract the number of caramelles he has more than Robert to find out how many caramelles he has more than James: 54 - 12 = 42. So John has 42 more caramelles than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they have three books to read. When they read each other's books, they will have read a total of six books (two from Dolly + three from Pandora). Therefore, at the end, they will have collectively read six books.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many letters Mike sends per week. Since he has stopped being friends with two of them, that means he is left with three people to write letters to. So, he will send 3 x 2 = 6 letters per week.  Now, let's calculate how long it takes him to write each letter. According to the problem, Mike can write one page in 6 minutes. So, it takes him 1/6 hour or 10 minutes to write one page. Therefore, it takes him 6 letters / 10 minutes per letter = 60 minutes to write all six letters.  Hence, Mike spends 60 minutes per week writing letters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason has 1000 minutes of phone calls per month. Then, he makes a daily call of 15 minutes with his boss, which means he uses 15 x 30 = 450 minutes for these calls this month. So far, Jason has used 1000 + 450 = 1450 minutes of phone calls this month. Now, we are told that he has had 300 additional minutes of phone calls this month with other people. Therefore, the total number of minutes he has used this month is 1450 + 300 = 1750 minutes. Since there are 30 days in this month, Jason has 1750 / 30 = 58 minutes remaining at the end of the month.
Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 French fries to start with and then he got some from Ginger (who gave him a handful). Then Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 left. Next, Billy took double what Kyle took, which is 2 x 5 = 10 more French fries from Griffin, leaving him with 19 - 10 = 9 remaining. Finally, Colby took 3 fewer than what Billy took, which means Colby took 3 less than 10, or 7 French fries from Griffin, leaving him with 9 - 7 = 2 remaining. So, Ginger gave Griffin an additional handful of French fries, bringing his total up to 2 + 5 = 7. Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 7 patatines in total.
Response:  If there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium, then the difference between the number of snails in the two aquaria is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. So if there are x fish in the first aquarium, there are 2x fish in the second aquarium. Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquaria is 4x + 2(2x) = 8x. Since the total number of snails in both aquaria is double the number of fish, we have 2(8x) = 16x. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Thus, there are 4 fish in the first aquarium and 8 fish in the second aquarium.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time it takes for the makeup artist to work on Jean every day. Since it takes 6 hours to do his makeup and he needs to do it 4 times a week, that means he spends 24 hours (or 3 days) doing makeup every week. Therefore, the total number of hours spent on makeup is: 24 hours/week x 5 weeks = 120 hours  Next, we need to calculate how much money Jean pays for these services. According to the question, Jean pays $250 per hour, so the total amount paid for makeup is: $250/hour x 120 hours = $30,000  Finally, since the makeup artist gives Jean an discount of 10%, the actual amount paid by Jean is: $30,000 x (1 - 0.10) = $27,000 So, Jean has paid $27,000 for the entire duration of the movie shoot.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Isabella spent $12 for the ingredients of the cake, $43 for gifts, $15 for decorations, $4 for invitations and $22 for sweets bags for guests.

Response:  The chef has bought 4 bags of onions, each bag weighing 50 kg. Therefore, the total weight of onions is 4 x 50 = 200 kg. Since each kilogram of onions costs $1.50, the cost of all the onions is 200 kg x $1.50/kg = $300. So, the chef has spent $300 on onions.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Sue ate 4 times more cookies than her sister, so she ate 4 x 20 = 80 cookies.  On Tuesday (Martes), Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.  In total, Sue ate 80 + 26 = 106 cookies.  Therefore, Sue consumed 106 - 5 = 101 calories more than her sister.
