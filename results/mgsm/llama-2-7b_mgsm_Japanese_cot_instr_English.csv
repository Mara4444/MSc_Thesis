"Response: 

1. Janet consumes 3 eggs per day for breakfast.
2. She uses 4 eggs per day to bake muffins for her friends.
3. So, she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left over each day.
4. Since she sells each egg at $2, her daily income from selling eggs is 9 x $2 = $18.
5. Therefore, her total daily income from both consuming and selling eggs is $18 + 3(breakfast eggs) = $18 + $6 = $24.

So, Janet earns $24 per day."
"Response:  We need to use 2 volumes of blue fibers and half volume of white fibers. So we can calculate as follows:

Blue fiber volume = 2 volumes
White fiber volume = Half volume of blue fiber volume

Therefore, the total amount of yarn needed is:
Total yarn volume = Blue fiber volume + White fiber volume
= 2 + (1/2) \* 2
= 2 + 1
= 3 volumes of yarn."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of renovation (5 million dollars). Then, we can subtract that from the original purchase price (8 million) to get the new value of the house after renovation:  
New Value = Purchase Price - Renovation Cost  
= 8,000,000 - 5,000,000  
= 3,000,000  
Next, we know that the house increased in value by 150%, so we can multiply the new value by 1.5 to find out the total profit:  
Profit = New Value x Increase Percentage  
= 3,000,000 x 1.5  
= 4,500,000  
Therefore, Josh's profit is $4,500,000."
"Response:  James runs 3 sprints per week, and each sprint is 60 meters long. So, in one week, James will run:

3 x 60 = 180 meters

Therefore, James will run 180 meters in one week."
Response:  We know that Wendy gives her chickens a mixed feed of grains, mealworms, and vegetables three times a day. In total, she gives each chicken 15 cups of food in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. If we assume that there are 20 chickens in total, how much food would Wendy need to give them at the third serving? To calculate this, we can use multiplication. First, let's find out how much food one chicken needs per day: 15 + 25 = 40 cups of food per day (morning + afternoon) Now, let's multiply the number of chickens by the amount of food needed per chicken: 20 x 40 = 800 cups of food per day (total for all 20 chickens) So, Wendy would need to give her chickens 800 cups of food at the third serving.
"Response: 

First, we need to calculate the cost of one glass. We know that the cost is $5 per glass.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of two glasses. Since the second glass costs 60% of the original price, we can calculate it as follows:

$5 x 2 = $10 (cost of two glasses)

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 glasses. We know that the cost of one glass is $5, so:

$5 x 16 = $80 (total cost of 16 glasses)

Therefore, the total cost of 16 glasses will be $80."
"Response:  We know that Turin has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So if we can find out how many sheep Seattle has, we can calculate the total number of sheep for all three cities.
Let's assume that Seattle has 20 sheep. Then we can start with the information that Turin has twice as many sheep as Charleston:
Turin has 2 x (number of sheep in Charleston) = 2 x 4x(20) = 80 sheep
Charleston has 4x(20) = 80 sheep
Now we have the total number of sheep for both Turin and Charleston:
Turin has 80 sheep
Charleston has 80 sheep
Next, let's add the number of sheep for Seattle to the total:
Total number of sheep for all three cities = 80 + 80 + 20 = 180 sheep
Therefore, the total number of sheep for Turin, Charleston, and Seattle is 180 heads."
"Response: 

Step 1: The file is downloaded to 40%.

Step 2: Windows updates and restarts the computer for 20 minutes (assuming it takes that long).

Step 3: Carla starts downloading the file again from scratch.

To find out how much time will be spent downloading the file, we need to calculate the total amount of time spent on each step.

Step 1: Downloading to 40% (time = 40%/60% x 1 hour) = 20 minutes

Step 2: Waiting for Windows update and restart (time = 20 minutes) = 20 minutes

Step 3: Redownloading the entire file (time = file size / download speed x 1 hour) = (200 GB / 2 GB/min x 1 hour) = 100 hours

Therefore, in total, it will take 100 + 20 + 20 = 140 hours or approximately 6 days to download the entire file."
"Response: 

1. John drives at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 60 miles/hour x 3 hours
= 180 miles

2. He then realizes that he forgot something important and turns back home. Since he cannot move due to heavy traffic for the first 2 hours, let's assume that he spends this time idling (not moving).

3. After 2 hours, he starts driving again at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour for the next 30 minutes. So, he covers an additional distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 30 miles/hour x 0.5 hours
= 15 miles

Total distance traveled from his starting point to his destination is:

Total Distance = Initial Distance + Additional Distance
= 180 miles + 15 miles
= 195 miles

Therefore, after 4 hours have passed, John will be 195 miles away from his starting point."
"Response: 

1. First 40 hours of the week: $10/hour x 40 hours = $400
2. Overtime hours (5 hours): $10/hour x 5 hours = $50
Total earnings for the week: $400 + $50 = $450

Therefore, Eliza will receive $450 in wages for this week."
"Response:  We know that in the first month, there were 60 downloads of the program. In the second month, there were three times as many downloads (i.e., 3 x 60 = 180). And in the third month, there was a 30% decrease from the previous month (i.e., 180 - 30% = 126). Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is:

60 + 180 + 126 = 466"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item. 

For donuts, there are 12 per pack and it costs $68, so one donut costs $68/12 = $5.67. 

For mini cupcakes, there are 12 per pack and it costs $80, so one mini cupcake costs $80/12 = $6.67. 

For mini cheesecakes, there are 72 per pack and it costs $55, so one mini cheesecake costs $55/72 = $7.69. 

Now, let's add up all the items that Turu purchased: 

Donuts (36) x Cost per Donut = $5.67 x 36 = $206.72 
Mini Cupcakes (24) x Cost per Mini Cupcake = $6.67 x 24 = $157.08 
Mini Cheesecakes (72) x Cost per Mini Cheesecake = $7.69 x 72 = $553.44 
Total Cost = $206.72 + $157.08 + $553.44 = $917.24"
"Response: 

1. Initial investment: $90 (for planting the lemon tree)
2. Annual revenue: $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 per year (from selling 7 lemons at $1.5 each)
3. Ongoing expenses: $3 per year (for water and fertilizer)
4. Profit per year: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year

To break even, we need to calculate how many years it takes for the profit to equal the initial investment:

$90 / $7.5 per year = 12 years (to break even)

So, Carlos will start making a profit after 12 years of owning the lemon tree."
"Response:  We know that Melanie sold 3/4 of the green houses, 2/3 of the red houses, and half of the orange houses. So let's start with the total number of houses she had at first.

Total = 3/4 + 2/3 + (1/2) = 7/4 + 2/3 + 1/2 = 12/6 + 2/3 + 1/2 = 20/6 + 2/3 + 1/2 = 28/6 + 2/3 + 1/2 = 34/6

Now we know that Melanie has 5 machines left, so we can set up an equation:

34/6 - 5 =?

Solve for the unknown variable (in this case, ""?"") to find out how many machines Melanie had at the beginning.

34/6 - 5 = 34/6 - 5 \* 6 = 34/6 - 30 = 4/6 = 4

Therefore, Melanie had 4 machines at the beginning."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 students in total and we have three types of dances - Contemporary Dance (20%), Jazz Dance (25%), and Hip-Hop Dance. So, if we add up all these percentages, we get:

20% + 25% + 25% = 70%

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total number of students is studying Hip-Hop Dance. To do this, we can use the following formula:

(number of students studying Hip-Hop Dance) / (total number of students) x 100

In this case, the number of students studying Hip-Hop Dance is 20% of 20, which is:

20/20 x 100 = 100%

So, 100% of the total number of students (20) are studying Hip-Hop Dance."
"Response:  We have two options for purchasing plans: $5,000 worth of precious stones and $8,000 worth of electrical products. The financial advisor predicts that the price of precious stones will increase by 2.5% per month, while the price of electrical products will increase by 1.2% per month. To maximize profits at the end of the month, we need to choose the option with the highest profit margin.  
First, let's calculate the total cost of each purchase plan:
Precious Stones: $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125
Electrical Products: $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096
Next, we compare the profit margins of each option:
Profit Margin (PM) = (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost
PM for Precious Stones = ($5,125 - $5,000) / $5,000 = 2.4%
PM for Electrical Products = ($8,096 - $8,000) / $8,000 = 1.25%
Since the PM for precious stones is higher than that of electrical products, it is more profitable to buy precious stones. Therefore, the answer is:
The maximum profit at the end of the month is $5,125 if you choose the precious stone purchase plan."
"Response: 

Day 1 (westward journey):

Electric car A travels for 80 miles westward.
Electric car B travels for 80 miles westward as well.
Total distance traveled by both cars on Day 1 = 2 x 80 = 160 miles

Day 2 (northward journey):

Electric car A travels for 150 miles northward.
Electric car B also travels for 150 miles northward.
Total distance traveled by both cars on Day 2 = 2 x 150 = 300 miles

Total distance traveled by both electric cars in 2 days = Total distance traveled on Day 1 + Total distance traveled on Day 2
= 160 + 300 = 460 miles

Therefore, each electric car traveled 460 miles in 2 days."
"Response:  We know that Jill works as an instructor for 35 hours per week and as a cheerleading coach for 15 hours per week. Since she works for 50 weeks in a year, we can calculate her total working hours as follows:

Total working hours = 35 hours/week x 50 weeks + 15 hours/week x 50 weeks
= 1750 hours + 750 hours
= 2500 hours

Now, let's convert her hourly wage to annual salary. As an instructor, Jill earns $20 per hour, so her annual salary would be:

Annual salary (as instructor) = $20/hour x 2500 hours
= $50,000

As a cheerleading coach, Jill earns $30 per hour, so her annual salary would be:

Annual salary (as cheerleading coach) = $30/hour x 750 hours
= $22,500

Therefore, Jill's total annual salary is:

Total annual salary = Annual salary (as instructor) + Annual salary (as cheerleading coach)
= $50,000 + $22,500
= $72,500"
"Response: 

1. Clare uses 3 eggs per day for breakfast, so she uses 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week.
2. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Clare eats 21 x 4 = 84 eggs in a month."
Response:  We know that Marissa walked for 4 miles in the first hour and then walked for another 2 miles in the second hour. So, in total, she walked for 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Since she walked for 6 hours, she covered a distance of 6 x 4 = 24 miles. Therefore, to cover the remaining distance of 12 - 24 = 0 miles, she needs to walk at an average speed of 0 / 24 = 0 miles per hour (since there is no distance left to cover).
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that is 3/2 water and 2/3 fruit puree. If we add this to 15 liters of pineapple drink, which is also 3/2 water and 2/3 fruit puree, then we will have a total volume of:

10 liters x (3/2) = 6 liters of water from orange juice
+ 15 liters x (3/2) = 9 liters of water from pineapple drink
= 15 liters of water in total

So, there are 15 liters of water in the final mixture."
"Response:  We know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond must be 31 + 6 = 37 years old.
Now, we are told that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. So, we can calculate the age of his son as follows:
Age of son = Age of Raymond at the time of his birth - Age of Raymond now
= 37 - 23
= 14 years old
Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago."
Response:  We know that Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday and his first three customers each buy one DVD. So, he sells 3 DVDs to his first three customers. Then, we know that his next two customers buy two DVDs each, so he sells another 2 DVDs. Finally, since his last three customers do not buy any DVDs, he does not sell any more DVDs. Therefore, in total, Billy sells 3 + 2 = 5 DVDs on Tuesday.
"Response: 

First, we know that the candle burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So if it burns for 4 hours (from 1 pm to 5 pm), it will burn a total of 8 cm (2 cm x 4 hours).

Now, let's find out how much shorter the candle will be after burning for 4 hours. We can do this by subtracting the amount of wax consumed from the original length of the candle.

The original length of the candle is 30 cm, so after burning for 4 hours, the candle will be:

30 cm - 8 cm = 22 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 22 cm long after burning for 4 hours."
"Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book at a discount of 25%, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Original price = Discounted price x (1 - Discount percentage)

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50, and the discount percentage is 25%. So we can plug these values into the equation:

Original price = $19.50 x (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 x 0.75
= $14.38

Therefore, the original price of the book was $14.38."
"Response:  We know that Marie ordered $12$ chicken meals at $\$3$ each, so she spent $\$36$ on chicken meals. She also bought $5$ packs of milk at $\$3$ each, so she spent another $\$15$ on milk. Moreover, she purchased $4$ packets of raspberries at $\$1.5$ each, which cost her an additional $\$6$. Finally, she bought a pizza for $\$8.50$. So in total, Marie spent $\$50$. Now we can set up an equation to represent this information:

$$36 + 15 + 6 + 8.5 = 50$$

Solving for the variable ""pizzas"", we get:

$$8.5 = 50 - (36 + 15 + 6)$$

Simplifying and solving for the number of pizzas, we have:

$$8.5 = 50 - (36 + 15 + 6) \Rightarrow 8.5 = 50 - 58 \Rightarrow 8.5 = -3.5$$

Therefore, Marie bought $3.5$ pizzas."
"Response: 
First, we know that Mishka bought three pairs of half-pants for $16.50 each, so she spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on half-pants.
Next, we know that she bought three pairs of long pants for $22.50 each, so she spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on long pants.
Finally, we know that she bought three pairs of shoes for $42 each, so she spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes.
Therefore, in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 on all her clothes."
"Response: 

1. There are 15 servings in one carton of ice cream.
2. If there are $4 per carton, then the cost per serving is:

$$ \text{cost per serving} = \frac{\$4}{15\text{ servings}} = \$0.27 $$
3. Since she eats one serving every night, she will use up all the ice cream in:

$$ \text{days to finish} = \frac{\text{total servings}}{\text{servings per day}} = \frac{15\text{ servings}}{1\text{ serving per night}} = 60\text{ days} $$

So, she will finish the ice cream in 60 days if she eats one serving every night."
"Response:  We know that Henry stopped twice during his bike trip. The first stop was after he had traveled for 20 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of his journey. So we can start by finding out how far Henry traveled between the two stops. Since he traveled for 20 miles before stopping the first time, and then another 15 miles before stopping again, the total distance between the two stops is:

20 + 15 = 35 miles

So Henry traveled a total of 35 miles between the two stops. Now let's find out how far each stop was from the starting point. We know that the first stop was 20 miles away from the starting point, and the second stop was 15 miles away from the ending point (since it was 15 miles before the end of the journey). Therefore, the distances from the starting point to each stop are:

First stop: 20 miles
Second stop: 45 miles (since the journey is 60 miles long, and the second stop is 15 miles before the end)

Therefore, the distances between the two stops are:

First stop - Second stop: 45 - 20 = 25 miles"
Response:  We know that Gloria has found one pair of boots within her budget of $50. If she chooses only one pair, it will cost $33 per pair. However, if she wants to buy both pairs, the total cost would be $66 ($33 x 2). Since she has already found one pair within her budget, she needs to find another pair that is not more than $50 - $33 = $17. Therefore, the second pair of boots should cost at most $17.
"Response:  We know that Darrel and Allen are currently 7 years apart in age, and their combined age is 162. So we can write an equation based on this information:

Darrel's age + Allen's age = 162... (1)

We also know that 7 years from now, Allen's age will be different. So let's calculate how old Allen will be 10 years from now:

Allen's age + 10 =?... (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for Allen's age 10 years from now?"
"Response:  We have three people who gave their answers as follows:

Person 1: 80
Person 2: Half of Person 1's answer (i.e., 40)
Person 3: 25% more than Person 1's answer (i.e., 80 x 1.25 = 100)

Now, let's calculate the average of these three numbers:

(80 + 40 + 100) / 3 = (220) / 3 = 73.33

So, the average of the three people's estimates is 73.33."
"Response: 

* John has 10 dogs to take care of.
* Each dog needs 30 minutes of walking and individual attention every day.
* To find out how many hours John spends taking care of his dogs in one week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent with each dog.

So, in one week, John spends:

10 dogs x 30 minutes/dog = 300 minutes (or 5 hours) per day

Therefore, John spends 5 hours x 7 days = 35 hours taking care of his dogs in one week."
"Response:  We know that Grettchen has 110 coins in total and gold coins are more than silver coins by 30. So if we subtract the number of silver coins from both sides, we get:

Gold Coins = Total Coins - Silver Coins
= 110 - (30 x 2)
= 110 - 60
= 50

Therefore, Grettchen has 50 gold coins."
"Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more diamonds than Raymond, so if Raymond has x diamonds, then Aaron has x + 5 diamonds. 
We also know that Cynthia has 2 fewer diamonds than Aaron, so if Aaron has x + 5 diamonds, then Cynthia has x + 3 diamonds. 
Finally, we are told that Raymond has 40 diamonds, so we can set up an equation based on this information:
x + 5 = 40... (1)
Now we need to find out how many diamonds Cynthia has. To do this, we substitute equation (1) into our second equation:
x + 3 =?... (2)
Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
x + 3 = 40 - 5
Simplifying, we get:
x + 3 = 35
Solving for x, we get:
x = 32
So Cynthia has 32 diamonds."
"Response: 

1. First 20 minutes (4 points)

Total points in first 20 minutes = 4 points

2. Next 20 minutes (with 25% more points)

If Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, he would have scored 4 x 25% = 1 point more in the next 20 minutes.

So, total points in the next 20 minutes = 1 point + 4 points = 5 points

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:

Total points = 4 + 5 = 9 points"
"Response: 

First, we know that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, so he consumes 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts in total for one month (30 days).

Second, each yogurt costs $5 when there is a sale, so the total cost of 60 yogurts would be:

60 yogurts x $5/yogurt = $300

Therefore, Terry will spend $300 on yogurt for one month if he eats two yogurts per day and there are four yogurts in a pack at a sale price of $5 per yogurt."
"Response:  John has $20 and he wants to buy 8 video games at $20 each. So, he needs $160 for all the video games (8 x $20 = $160). Since he only has $20, he cannot afford all of them. Therefore, he will have to use some of his Legos to pay for the video games.  
Let's assume that one Lego set costs $15. If John sells all 13 sets, he will get $195 ($15 x 13 = $195). This is more than enough to buy all the video games he wants. However, since he only has $20, he can only buy 4 video games with the money from the Legos.  
So, after buying 4 video games, John will be left with $20 - $60 = $40. He will still have 9 Lego sets remaining. Therefore, the number of Lego sets John has now is 9."
"Response:  We know that John runs for 3 hours on the first day and half the time (1/2) on the other two days. So, he runs for 3/2 = 1.5 hours per day on the second and third days. Therefore, his total weekly running distance is:

3 hours x 1 day + 1.5 hours x 2 days = 3 + 3 x 1.5 = 9 miles per week."
Response:  We know that Dan can run at twice the speed of walking, so if she walks for 3 minutes, she can run for 3/2 = 1.5 minutes. Since she runs at a speed of 3 miles per hour, she will cover a distance of 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 miles in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, if she spends 3 minutes walking and 1.5 minutes running, she will cover a total distance of 3 + 4.5 = 7.5 miles in 3 minutes. So, in 6 hours, she will cover a distance of 7.5 x 6 = 45 miles.
"Response:  We know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is two years older than Suzie's iPhone. So we can start with these facts:

Ben's iPhone is 2 years old (given)
Suzie's iPhone is 2 years younger than Ben's iPhone (given)
Brandon's iPhone is 4 times older than Ben's iPhone (given)

Now let's find out how old Suzie's iPhone is:

Suzie's iPhone = Ben's iPhone - 2 years
= 2 years ago

So Suzie's iPhone is 2 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old Brandon's iPhone is:

Brandon's iPhone = Ben's iPhone + 4 x 2 years
= 2 years + 8 years
= 10 years ago

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 10 years old."
"Response:  We know that Polly can throw the gold spear 400 feet and it is enough to reach the dragon's flames. If she has the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the spear three times farther than usual. So we need to find out how far she can throw the spear with the gemstone.

First, let's calculate the distance she can throw the spear without the gemstone:

Distance = 400 feet

Now, if she has the gemstone, we know that she can throw the spear three times farther:

Distance x 3 =?

We want to find out what this number is. Can you help us?"
"Response: 

1. Jones-obaachan baked 5 apple pies for the firefighters' lunch meeting.
2. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple pie in total.
3. The guests took the apple pies and ate them, leaving 14 remaining at nightfall (40 - 14 = 26).
4. Since each guest ate 8 pieces of apple pie, we can calculate how many guests attended the meeting as follows: 26 / 8 = 3.

Therefore, 3 guests attended the firefighters' lunch meeting and ate 8 pieces of apple pie each."
Response:  We know that one serving of potato chips (1 bag) contains 250 calories and our daily calorie goal is 2000 calories. If we have already consumed 1800 calories, we can calculate how much more calories we can consume from the remaining 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. Since there are 300 grams in one bag of potato chips, we can divide 200 calories by 300 grams to get the number of grams we can eat: 200 / 300 = 0.67 or approximately 67 grams. Therefore, if we have already consumed 1800 calories and want to add 200 more calories from potato chips, we can eat about 67 grams (or 1/4 of a bag).
"Response:  We know that Charlie has $10 worth of wax and wicks for each candle he makes, so if he makes 20 candles, his total cost would be:

10 (wax and wicks) x 20 (candles) = $200

We also know that Charlie sells each candle for $2, so if he sells all 20 candles, his revenue would be:

20 (candles) x $2 (price per candle) = $40

Now we need to find out how much profit Charlie will make from selling these 20 candles. To do this, we subtract our total cost ($200) from our revenue ($40):

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $40 - $200
= -$160

So unfortunately, Charlie will actually lose $160 by making and selling these 20 candles."
Response:  We know that Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and twice as many (i.e., 2 x 5 = 10) on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote 10 times as many articles as she did on Tuesday, so she wrote 10 x 10 = 100 articles on Wednesday. In total, Meredith wrote 5 + 10 + 100 = 115 articles in 3 days. Therefore, she spent 115 / 4 = 28.75 hours writing articles over those 3 days.
"Response: 

1. Candice had 80 post-its in her bag before going to work at the coffee shop.
2. She bought a pack of post-its during her shift (we don't know how many were in the pack).
3. She put one memo per cup for all 220 cups of coffee she served that day.
4. Therefore, there are 23 remaining post-it notes left after serving all the customers.

Now let's calculate how many post-it notes were in the pack Candice bought:

5. Since each pack contains x post-it notes, and Candice used 23 post-it notes out of the pack, we can set up an equation:

x - 23 = 80 (since Candice started with 80 post-it notes)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 57 (post-it notes in the pack)

Therefore, Candice bought a pack of 57 post-it notes."
"Response:  We know that John spent $200 on blue neckties and each blue necktie costs $40. So he bought:

$$ \text{Number of blue neckties} = \frac{\$200}{ \$40} = 5 $$

Now we need to find out how many red neckties he bought since they are twice as expensive as blue ones.

$$ \text{Number of red neckties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue neckties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 $$

So John spent $200 on 5 blue neckties and $200 x 2 = $400 on 10 red neckties in total."
"Response:  We know that Tracy used 4 feet of wire to support tomato seedlings in her garden. If we divide the length of wire into equal parts based on the number of seedlings she planted, we can calculate how much wire she needed for each seedling.

Let's assume that Tracy planted n seedlings. Since each seedling needs 6 inches of wire (1/4 of the total length), Tracy needed 4n + 6 inches of wire in total.

We are given that the wire was cut into pieces of 6 inches each, so Tracy had m pieces of wire, where m = 4n + 6.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of wire Tracy had if she planted 50 seedlings. Can you do that?"
"Response: 

1. Total number of rooms in the building = 8 x 15 = 120 rooms
2. Number of occupied rooms = 3/4 of 120 = 90 rooms (since 3/4 of the building is occupied)
3. Number of unoccupied rooms = 120 - 90 = 30 rooms

Therefore, there are 30 unoccupied rooms in the building."
"Response: 

1. The number of eggs per day is given as 252.
2. The price of one dozen (12) eggs is $2.
3. To find out how much money Lloyd can make in a week, we need to multiply the number of eggs he sells per day by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week.
4. So, Lloyd can sell 252 eggs x 7 days = 1,764 eggs per week.
5. At $2 per dozen, Lloyd can earn 1,764 eggs x $2/dozen = $3,528 per week.

Therefore, Lloyd can make $3,528 per week selling eggs from his chicken farm."
"Response:  We know that Tom can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour during his voyage. If he sails for 4 hours (from 1 pm to 5 pm), then he will cover a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 10 miles/hour x 4 hours
= 40 miles

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to return at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We know that the distance he needs to cover is 40 miles. So, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 40 miles / 6 miles/hour
= 6.67 hours (or approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes)

Therefore, it will take Tom approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes to return home."
"Response: 

First, we know that the total weight of the manga books is 15 pounds x 30 = 450 pounds.

Next, we know that each manga book weighs 1/4 pound, so the total number of manga books is 450 / 1/4 = 1800 books.

Now, let's find out how many toys he needs to remove to reach his goal of 15 pounds. We know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the total number of toys is 15 - 450 = 435 pounds / 1/2 = 870 toys.

Therefore, if he removes 30 manga books and 870 toys, he will have reached his goal of removing 15 pounds from his backpack."
"Response:  We know that the cost of repairing each tire for trucks is $60 and for cars it is $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, so the total revenue from Thursday's work is:

6 x $60 = $360 (for truck tires) + 4 x $40 = $160 (for car tires) = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 tires in total, but only repaired car tires and not truck tires. So, the total revenue from Friday's work is:

12 x $40 = $480 (for car tires)

Therefore, the total revenue for both days is:

$520 + $480 = $1,000

So, the mechanic earned $1,000 in two days."
"Response:  We know that Patchie had 3 times as many kittens as the number of kittens brought from the shelter. So if the number of kittens brought from the shelter is x, then Patchie had 3x kittens.
We also know that Tricksy had 12 kittens.
So in total, there are 3x + 12 = 15 kittens in the Doutfire household."
Response:  Jane has 30 candies and eats 2 of them. That means she has 30 - 2 = 28 candies left. She wants to put 2 candies in each bag, so she needs 28 / 2 = 14 bags.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Peter has $42 to spend for the week and he spends $7 on tickets and popcorn each time he goes to the movies. So, if he wants to go to the movies $x$ times this week, he will have spent a total of $7x + 42$. Since he only has $42$ dollars, we can set up an equation as follows:

$$7x + 42 = 42$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$7x = 42 - 42$$

$$7x = 0$$

So, Peter can go to the movies $0$ times this week since he doesn't have enough money to buy tickets and popcorn."
"Response:  We know that each box weighs 15 pounds and there are 33 boxes in total. So, the weight of all the boxes is:

33 x 15 = 495 pounds

We also know that the truck with the driver has a maximum load capacity of 3755 pounds (3755 - 495 = 3260). Therefore, if we want to avoid exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to make sure that the combined weight of the boxes and the truck does not exceed 3260 pounds.

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit is:

3260 / 15 = 217

Therefore, the truck can carry up to 217 boxes without exceeding the weight limit."
"Response: 
1st) The final cost of Steven's grocery order is $40.00 (given).
2nd) The delivery company added a 25% service fee to the total amount, which is $40.00 x 25% = $10.00.
So, the new total amount including the service fee is $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.
3rd) Steven also paid an additional $4.00 tip, so the final payment he made was $50.00 + $4.00 = $54.00.
Therefore, the final cost of Steven's grocery order after adding all the charges is $54.00."
"Response: 
1) Each cluster has 20 berries.
2) There are 6 clusters in total.
3) Therefore, there are 6 x 20 = 120 berries in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 oranges in total, and we have to find out how many of them are in good condition. According to the information given, 1 orange is bad, 20% of the oranges are still green, and 2 oranges are too acidic. So, if we subtract the number of bad oranges (1) and the percentage of green oranges (20% of 25 = 5), we get:

25 - 1 - 5 = 19

Therefore, there are 19 oranges in good condition."
"Response: 

First, Janet paid $500 for the materials to make the brooch.
Next, she spent $800 to have the gemstone merchant create the brooch.
Finally, she paid an additional $100 (10% of $800) for insurance.

So in total, Janet paid:

$$500 + 800 + 100 = 1400$$

Therefore, the answer is $1400."
"Response: 

1. First, we know that Marsha will receive $50,000 per year for 40 years, starting from her retirement at age 65. This means she will receive a total of:

40 x $50,000 = $2,000,000

2. Next, we know that after 20 years, Marsha will start receiving an annual increase of 5%. So, if she receives $2,000,000 in the first 20 years, she will receive:

$2,000,000 x (1 + 0.05)^20 = $2,789,232

in the next 20 years.

3. Finally, since Marsha retires at age 65 and lives for 30 years, she will receive a total of:

$2,789,232 x (1 + 0.05)^30 = $5,322,857

Therefore, Marsha's pension fund will be worth approximately $5,322,857 when she retires at age 65 and lives for 30 years."
"Response:  
First half year (6 months) = $140 x 6 = $840
Discounted price for second half year = $840 x 0.9 = $752
Total amount paid by Arena for one year = $840 + $752 = $1,592
Therefore, Arena will pay $1,592 for one year of streaming service."
"Response:  We know that Sofia has driven 100 miles since her last fill-up and she needs to drive another 1 tank (4 gallons) to refill her tank completely. Therefore, we can calculate how far she can go with one tank of gas as follows:  
Total distance = Distance since last fill-up + Distance until next fill-up  
= 100 miles + (4 gallons / 12 gallons per tank) x Total tank capacity  
= 100 miles + (4/12) x 12  
= 100 miles + 3.33 miles  
Therefore, Sofia can go approximately 103.33 miles with one tank of gas."
"Response: 

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV every day for 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).

Total time spent watching TV per week = 2 x 3 = 6 hours/week

2. He spends half of his remaining time reading books.

Total time spent reading books per week = (7 - 6) / 2 = 5 hours/week

Therefore, Jim spends a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours per week on TV and reading books."
"Response:  We know that each school has a boys' basketball team and a girls' basketball team, with 5 members in each team. So, for one school, we have:

Boys' team: 5 players
Girls' team: 5 players
Total number of students: 5 + 5 = 10

Since there are four schools, we multiply the total number of students by 4 to get the total number of people participating in the tournament:

10 x 4 = 40

Therefore, there will be 40 people participating in the tournament (10 from each of the four schools)."
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies in total. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we can write: Number of emeralds = 2 x 35 = 70. Therefore, the total number of precious stones in the treasure chest is: 175 + 35 + 70 = 280.
Response:  We know that there are 60 female students and 5 male students for every female student, so the total number of male students is 60 x 2 = 120. Since each teacher has 5 students, we need 120 / 5 = 24 teachers. Therefore, there would be 24 teachers in Welz's school.
"Response:  If Bailey had $x at first and received $5 each week for 8 weeks, then she would have received a total of:

$$ 5 x 8 = 40 $$

dollars over those 8 weeks. So, if she ended up with $100 after those 8 weeks, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

$$ x + 40 = 100 $$

Solving for x, we get:

$$ x = 60 $$

So, Bailey had $60 at first."
"Response: 

1. Total number of students per week = 7 (weekdays) x 15 (students per class) = 105 students/week
2. Total amount earned per week from each student = $15/student/class x 7 classes/week = $105/student/week
3. Total earnings for Judy per week = 105 students/week x $105/student/week = $10,925/week
4. Total earnings for Judy per month (assuming 4 weeks in a month) = $10,925/week x 4 weeks/month = $43,700/month

Therefore, Judy can earn approximately $43,700 per month teaching dance classes."
Response:  We know that Kerry has two recipes with different numbers of instructions. The first recipe has 20 instructions, and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one (i.e., 2 x 20 = 40). To prepare both dishes, Kerry needs to read a total of 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.
"Response: 

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Tommy can collect from selling 43 brownies and 23 cheesecakes.

43 x $3 = $139 (brownies)
23 x $4 = $92 (cheesecakes)
Total: $231

Step 2: Subtract the cost of ingredients for each item.

For brownies:
$139 - ($2 x 43) = $139 - $86 = $53

For cheesecakes:
$92 - ($4 x 23) = $92 - $88 = $4

Step 3: Add the profits from both items.

$53 + $4 = $57

Therefore, if Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 cheesecakes, he will collect a total of $57."
"Response: 

First, we need to calculate the total amount that Seira needs to pay for all five phones. Since each phone costs $150 and there are five phones, the total amount is:

Total = 5 x $150 = $750

Next, we need to calculate the interest rate. The question states that there is a 2% interest rate, so we can calculate the interest as follows:

Interest = Total x Rate / 100
Interest = $750 x 2/100
Interest = $15

Now, let's calculate the monthly payment amount. We know that Seira needs to make three payments of $x each. So, we can set up an equation based on the total amount and the interest rate:

Monthly Payment = Total + Interest / Number of Payments
Monthly Payment = $750 + $15 / 3
Monthly Payment = $765

Therefore, Seira needs to pay $765 per month for three months to cover the cost of the five phones with a 2% interest rate."
"Response:  We know that Artie has 12 Marigold flowers, 9 Petunia flowers, and 17 Begonia flowers to sell. The prices of each flower are $2.74, $1.87, and $2.12 per pot, respectively. To find out how much money Artie can make in total, we need to multiply the number of flowers he has by their respective prices. So, for Marigold:  
12 x $2.74 = $33.08  
For Petunia:  
9 x $1.87 = $16.93  
For Begonia:  
17 x $2.12 = $35.04  
Adding up all these amounts gives us a total of:  
$33.08 + $16.93 + $35.04 = $85.05 That's how much money Artie can make today!"
"Response:  We know that each floor has half the area of the previous floor, so we can start with the top floor and work our way down to find out how much space is available for each floor.

Top Floor (Floor 4): Area = 16 square feet

Next Floor (Floor 3): Area = Half of 16 = 8 square feet

Next Floor (Floor 2): Area = Half of 8 = 4 square feet

Next Floor (Floor 1): Area = Half of 4 = 2 square feet

So, the average area per floor is:

(16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5 square feet per floor."
"Response:  We know that Cesilia needs to feed her new puppy dog food for the first 180 days (6 months) and then for the rest of its life. So we can break down the total amount of dog food needed into two parts:  
Part 1: First 180 days (6 months)  
Cesilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, so she will need:  
1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups  
Part 2: Rest of the puppy's life  
Assuming the average lifespan of a dog is 15 years, Cesilia will need to feed her puppy for another 14.5 years (15 - 0.5).  
She needs to feed her puppy 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining period, so she will need:  
2 cups/day x 14.5 years = 3175 cups  
Total number of cups needed: Part 1 + Part 2  
= 180 cups + 3175 cups = 3355 cups  
Therefore, Cesilia needs 3355 cups of dog food for the first year and approximately 3175 cups per year for the next 14.5 years."
"Response:  We know that Raymond did half of Sarah's laundry, and David did the same amount as Sarah. So if Sarah did 400 pounds of laundry, then:

1. Raymond did half of 400 = 200 pounds of laundry (since he did half)
2. David did the same amount as Sarah, so he did 400 pounds of laundry as well.

So there is a difference of 200 - 400 = -200 pounds between Raymond and David's laundry."
"Response: 
First, we need to calculate the cost of one bouquet of flowers. We know that Vincent sells them in packages of 2 or 3 stems for $1 and $2.50, respectively. So, if we buy one bouquet, we will pay $1 or $2.50, depending on the package we choose.
Now, let's consider the case where we buy 18 bouquets. If we buy them individually at $1 each, the total cost would be 18 x $1 = $18.
On the other hand, if we buy them in packages of 3 stems for $2.50 each, we would need to purchase 6 packages (18 / 3 = 6). The total cost in this case would be 6 x $2.50 = $15.
Therefore, the cheaper option is to buy the bouquets in packages of 3 stems for $2.50 each, as it costs $15 for 18 bouquets, while buying them individually at $1 each would cost $18."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John will pay $100 for the trimming service at the dog groomer's. Secondly, we are told that the groomer is offering a 30% discount to new customers like John. So, if we calculate the original price of the trimming service without the discount, it would be:

Original Price = $100 x (1 - 0.3) = $100 x 0.7 = $70

Now, since John is a new customer, he will receive a 30% discount, so the amount he needs to pay becomes:

Discounted Price = $70 x 0.7 = $49

Therefore, the cost of the trimming service for John after the 30% discount is $49."
"Response: 

First, each of the two girls drank 24 liters of water, so they together drank 2 x 24 = 48 liters of water.

Then, the boy drank 6 liters of water. So, in total, 48 + 6 = 54 liters of water were drunk.

Now, we need to find out how much water is left. We know that there are 72 liters of water in the container (since it holds 6 times as much water as one girl can drink). Therefore, if we subtract the amount of water that was drunk from the total amount of water available, we get:

72 - 54 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  Charlie has 10 stickers to begin with.

Step 1: Charlie buys 21 stickers at the mall, so now they have 10 + 21 = 31 stickers in total.

Step 2: On their birthday, Charlie receives 23 more stickers, so now they have 31 + 23 = 54 stickers in total.

Step 3: Charlie gives 9 stickers to their sister, leaving them with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 45 stickers left after giving some to their sister and using some for greeting cards."
Response:  We know that Alex's weight is 4 times Grace's weight, so if Grace weighs 125 pounds, then Alex weighs 4 x 125 = 500 pounds. The total weight of both women is 125 + 500 = 625 pounds.
"Response:  We know that Dan has three rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns, so we can calculate the total number of thorns as follows:

3 x 25 x 8 = 3 x 200 = 600 thorns

Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total."
"Response:  We know that the soccer team played 22 games and won more than they lost. If they lost x games, then they must have won 22 - x games. Since they won more than they lost, we can say that they won at least one game more than they lost. So, we can set up an equation as follows:

22 - x >= 1

Now solve for x.

x <= 21

So, the soccer team won 21 games and lost 1 game."
"Response: 

1. Gene has been going on vacation for 4 years since he was 23 years old.
2. He gets one T-shirt each time he goes on vacation.
3. Each T-shirt represents a block of his kilim.
4. Different blocks are used in each row to represent different years of vacation.
5. We want to know how many blocks Gene has in total.

So, let's count the number of blocks for each year that Gene has gone on vacation:

Year 1: 1 block (he was 23 years old)
Year 2: 2 blocks (he was 24 years old)
Year 3: 3 blocks (he was 25 years old)
Year 4: 4 blocks (he was 26 years old)

Now, let's add up all the blocks:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Gene has 10 blocks in total."
"Response: 

First alarm: 1 time
Second alarm: 3 times (since it rang for three times as long as the first alarm) = 3 x 1 = 3
Third alarm: Half the length of the second alarm = half of 3 = 1.5
Total number of alarms: 1 + 3 + 1.5 = 5.5

So, there were 5.5 alarms in total."
"Response: 

Year 1: Salary = $600 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $660
Year 2: Salary = $660 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $728
Year 3: Salary = $728 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $804
Year 4: Salary = $804 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $889
Year 5: Salary = $889 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $983

Therefore, after 3 years from December of her fifth year of employment, Silvie's salary would be $983 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $1,081."
"Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 8 times as much as Harold. So if Marilyn sold x copies, Harold sold 8x copies. We also know that the total number of records sold is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:

8x + x = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:

9x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 9:

x = 9,777

So Marilyn sold 9,777 copies and Harold sold 8 times as much, which is 8 x 9,777 = 78,336 copies."
"Response: 

First, we need to calculate how many gift bags Christina needs in total. Since 4/1 of the attendees will not participate, she needs 4 times as many gift bags as the number of attendees. So, if she has invited 16 people, she needs:

4 x 16 = 64 gift bags

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of all the gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is:

64 x $2 = $128

Therefore, Christina needs 64 gift bags and the total cost will be $128."
"Response:  We know that adult dinosaurs eat 10 pounds of potato salad each and children eat half as much as adults. So if there are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 children participating in the picnic, we can calculate how many pounds of potato salad they will need based on their respective consumption rates.  
First, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for all participants:  
Total = (20 x 10) + (5 x 0.5)  
Total = 200 + 2.5  
Total = 202.5 pounds  
Therefore, Ted needs to prepare approximately 202.5 pounds of potato salad for the picnic."
"Response:  We know that Jean has three times as many pets as Marsha. So if Marsha has x pets, Jean has 3x pets. Additionally, we know that Cindy has four pets. Therefore, the total number of pets owned by all three women is:

3x + 4 =?

Solve for x to find out how many pets Marsha owns:

3x + 4 = 7 (since Cindy has 4 pets)

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 3

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1

So Marsha owns one pet. Now we can calculate how many pets each woman owns:

Jean: 3(1) = 3 pets
Cindy: 4 pets
Marsha: 1 pet

Therefore, the three women together have 3 + 4 + 1 = 8 pets."
"Response:  We know that Emily has four children, and their ages are as follows:

* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
* Colin is 2 years younger than Emily.
* James is 10 years old.

We can start by finding out how old Jackson is. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can say that Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy. Therefore, Jackson's age is:

Jackson's age = Amy's age - 5
= 10 (Emily's age) - 5
= 5

So, Jackson is 5 years old."
"Response:  We know that Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds, and Jerry can run it in 42 seconds if he changes his diet to improve his speed by 10%. So we have two equations:

Equation 1:
Lee's time = 38 seconds

Equation 2:
Jerry's time with improved diet = (10% of 42 seconds) = 4.2 seconds faster than before

Now let's solve for Jerry's new time after improving his diet:

New Jerry's time = Old Jerry's time + (4.2 seconds x 10%)
= 42 seconds + (4.2 x 10%)
= 42 seconds + 0.42 seconds
= 42.42 seconds

So, Jerry can run 400 meters in 42.42 seconds after improving his diet."
"Response:  We know that there are 60 dogs and each dog has 2 cats, so we can start by calculating how many cats there are in total.

60 dogs x 2 cats per dog = 120 cats

Now, we know that there are fewer rabbits than dogs plus cats. So, if there are 120 cats and dogs, how many rabbits would make the total number of pets equal to the number of dogs and cats?

Let's assume there are x rabbits. Then, we can calculate the total number of pets as follows:

x + 120 (cats and dogs) = 120 (dogs) + 2(120) = 360

Solving for x, we get:

x = 360 - 120 = 240

Therefore, there are 240 rabbits in the neighborhood."
"Response: 

1. 2/5 of the students are boys. This means that 2/5 x 200 = 40 students are boys.
2. 2/3 of the remaining students (i.e., those who are not boys) are girls. This means that 2/3 x (200 - 40) = 60 students are girls.
3. Therefore, there are 40 + 60 = 100 students in total who are either boys or girls.
4. The number of girls who are not in Girl Scouts is 60 - 20 = 40.

So, there are 40 girls who are not in Girl Scouts."
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night and James only slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  

Harry slept for 9 hours = 9 x 100% = 900 minutes  
James slept for 2/3 of 900 minutes = 2/3 x 900 = 600 minutes  
Now we need to find out how many more minutes Harry slept than James did. To do this, subtract the amount of time James slept from the amount of time Harry slept:  
600 - 900 = -300 minutes  
So Harry slept 300 minutes (or 5 hours) more than James did!"
Response:  We know that Freeda used 16-ounce cans of tomatoes and each can contained three tomatoes. So she used a total of 16 x 3 = 48 tomatoes.
"Response:  We know that there are initially 30 cars on the highway and 5 cars exit from the beginning of the congestion. So, after 15 minutes of congestion, there will be 30 - 5 = 25 cars left on the highway.  
Now, we know that another 20 cars pass through the remaining 15 minutes of congestion, so there will be 25 + 20 = 45 cars passing through the entire 30-minute period of congestion."
"Response: 

1. Marry received 18 new potted plants yesterday.
2. She already has 40 windows with two potted plants each.
3. She wants to give one potted plant to her friends and family tomorrow.

So, how many potted plants will Mary have left after giving them away?

To find out, we need to subtract the number of potted plants she plans to give away (18) from the total number of potted plants she has (40 x 2 = 80).

80 - 18 = 62

Therefore, Mary will have 62 potted plants left after giving some away to her friends and family."
"Response:  We know that Jerome has four friends who visit him on specific days of the week. The first friend visits Jerome before he opens the door 20 times, and the second friend visits after the first friend has finished (i.e., after 20 rings). The third friend visits after the second friend has finished (i.e., after 20 x 2 = 40 rings), and the fourth friend visits last.

We can start with the number of rings made by the first friend:

20 rings

Now, let's consider the number of rings made by the second friend:

Since the second friend visits after the first friend has finished, they make half as many rings as the first friend:

20 / 2 = 10 rings

Next, we'll look at the number of rings made by the third friend:

The third friend makes more rings than the second friend because there are more people visiting after them:

10 + (4 - 2) = 10 + 2 = 12 rings

Finally, we'll calculate the total number of rings made by all four friends:

20 + 10 + 12 + 60 = 102 rings

So, if the fourth friend visits Jerome 60 times, the total number of rings made by all four friends is 102."
"Response: 

First, we know that Solo has read 15 pages of his science textbook on Monday.

Second, we know that he needs to read 4 pages per day for each subject (science, social studies, history, and geography) to catch up with the rest of the class.

Third, we can calculate how many days it will take him to finish reading all the subjects based on the number of pages he needs to read per day.

So, let's start by calculating the total number of pages Solo needs to read for each subject:

Science: 4 x 3 = 12 pages
Social Studies: 20 x 3 = 60 pages
History: 7 x 3 = 21 pages
Geography: 8 x 3 = 24 pages

Total pages: 12 + 60 + 21 + 24 = 127 pages

Now, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days he has left to finish reading them:

127 pages / 4 days = 31.75 pages per day

Since we cannot have a fraction of a page, we round up to the nearest whole number:

31.75 pages/day → 32 pages/day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 32 pages per day for the next four days to catch up with the rest of the class."
"Response: 

1. John drinks 1 cup of water in the morning, noon, and evening (3 times).
2. On weekdays, he drinks 3 cups of water (3 x 1 cup).
3. On weekends, he replaces one cup of water with soda (3 x 1 cup - 1 cup = 2 cups).
4. Therefore, John drinks 2 cups of water on weekends.
5. So, John drinks a total of 3 + 2 = 5 cups of water per day."
"Response: 

First, we know that it takes 10 minutes for the mist to cover one mile of the city. So if we want to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles long, how many minutes will it take?

We can start by converting miles to minutes:

1 mile = 60 seconds (since there are 5,280 feet in a mile)

Therefore, 42 miles = 42 x 60 = 25200 seconds

Now, we need to divide this number by 10 to find out how many groups of 10 minutes it would take to cover the entire city:

25200 / 10 = 2520 groups of 10 minutes

So, it would take 2520 groups of 10 minutes to cover the entire city with mist, or 252 hours. That's equivalent to approximately 10 days and 20 hours!"
Response:  If Popie has 1000 pieces of jigsaw puzzle and she has already put in 4/10 or 400 pieces, then there are only 600 pieces left to be placed. Since her mother will place 3/10 or 300 pieces, that means there are still 300 pieces left unplaced. So the answer is 300.
Response:  If Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody will eat 3 times that amount, which is 15 cookies (3 x 5 = 15). So together, they will eat 20 cookies (5 + 15 = 20).
"Response:  We know that each box has a volume of 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot and 120 cubic inches in a cubic foot). Since each box has a thickness of 1 inch, we can subtract 1 inch from each dimension to find the internal volume of each box:

Box 1: 5 inches - 1 inch = 4 inches x 6 inches - 1 inch = 240 cubic inches
Box 2: 5 inches - 1 inch = 4 inches x 6 inches - 1 inch = 240 cubic inches
Box 3: 5 inches - 1 inch = 4 inches x 6 inches - 1 inch = 240 cubic inches

Since all three boxes have the same dimensions and volume, we can add their volumes together to find the total volume of all three boxes:

Total volume = 240 cubic inches + 240 cubic inches + 240 cubic inches = 720 cubic inches

Therefore, the total volume of all three boxes is 720 cubic inches."
"Response:  We know that Frankie watches TV for 7 hours in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one hour of his favorite episode each day. On Wednesday, he watches three episodes of 30 minutes each. On Thursday, he finishes his homework early and watches one hour of TV plus three 30-minute episodes. Finally, on Friday, he stays up late and watches two one-hour episodes. So, let's calculate how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday:

Wednesday: 3 x 30 min = 90 min

Now, we can add up all the time he spent watching TV:

Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday = 7 hours

So, Frankie watched 90 minutes of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. Last year, he baked x cookies. So this year, he will bake 2x cookies.
We also know that he has 110 cookies in total and removed 5 of them. So we can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:
2x - 5 = 110
Solving for x, we get:
2x = 110 + 5
2x = 115
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
x = 57.5
So Henry baked 57.5 cookies last year."
"Response:  If someone buys 1 gallon of gas at $3.00 per gallon and receives a cash back of $0.20 per gallon, then they will pay $3.00 - $0.20 = $2.80 for 1 gallon of gas.  
If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, they will pay $2.80 x 10 = $28.00 for 10 gallons of gas."
"Response:  Marcel and Betries both have fruit roll-ups with different widths but equal lengths (24 rolls). If we assume they eat all their roll-ups without any waste or leftovers, then we can calculate how much each of them eats based on the area of their respective roll-ups.

Marcel has a roll-up that is 3 rolls wide and 24 rolls long, so its area is:

Area = length x width = 24 x 3 = 72 square rolls

Betries has a roll-up that is 2 rolls wide and 24 rolls long, so its area is:

Area = length x width = 24 x 2 = 48 square rolls

Since both of them eat everything they have, we can say that they consume an equal amount of fruit roll-ups based on their areas:

Average consumption per person = Total area / Number of people
= (72 + 48) / 2
= 120 / 2
= 60 square rolls per person

Therefore, Marcel and Betries consume an average of 60 square rolls each."
"Response:  We know that Julia's boat travels at a speed of 10 feet per second and takes 64 seconds to reach the shore. So, we can calculate the distance traveled by the boat as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 10 ft/sec x 64 sec
= 640 ft

Now, we need to find out how much water enters the boat during this time. We are given that 2 liters of water enter the boat every second it travels. So, we can calculate the total amount of water that enters the boat as follows:

Water entered = Speed x Distance x Water per second
= 10 ft/sec x 640 ft x 2 L/sec
= 1280 L (or 1.28 cubic meters)

Therefore, a total of 1.28 cubic meters of water will enter Julia's boat during her journey from the middle of the lake to the shore."
"Response: 

1. Each teacher has 2 classes per day, so there are a total of 8 classes (2 x 4 teachers).
2. Since each class uses the whiteboard once, there will be a total of 8 writing sessions on the whiteboard (8 classes x 1 writing session per class).
3. If the whiteboard is erased three times during each writing session, it means that the whiteboard will be erased a total of 24 times (8 writing sessions x 3 erasures per session).

Therefore, the whiteboard will be erased 24 times in one day."
"Response: 

Day 0: Ryan has no flowers yet.

Day 1: Ryan plants 2 flowers.

Day 2: Ryan now has 2 + 2 = 4 flowers.

Day 3: Ryan plants 2 more flowers.

Day 4: Ryan now has 4 + 2 = 6 flowers.

Day 5: Ryan does not water any of his flowers and they all die.

So, after 5 days, Ryan has 6 - 5 = 1 flower left."
Response:  We know that Jamal has 6 times as many photos as Brittany, so if Brittany can save 300 photos, then Jamal can save 300 x 6 = 1800 photos. Now we are given that there are 50 birds in each photo of Jamal taking pictures of ducks at the zoo, so the total number of ducks in all of Jamal's photos is 1800 x 50 = 90,000 ducks.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all the lumber that Sasha has purchased. We know that she has 10 boards of 2x4x10, each board costs $10, so the total cost is:

10 boards x $10/board = $100

She also has 5 boards of 4x4x10, each board costs $16, so the total cost is:

5 boards x $16/board = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Now, let's calculate the profit. If Sasha sells all the lumber for $30 per board, then the total revenue will be:

10 boards x $30/board = $300

5 boards x $30/board = $150

Total revenue = $300 + $150 = $450

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $450 - $180
= $270

Therefore, if Sasha sells all the lumber for $30 per board, she will make a profit of $270."
"Response:  We know that Katie uses 7 parts of coffee to 1 part of sugar and water. So if she uses 120 cups of sugar and water in total, how many cups of coffee will she use?

First, let's calculate the number of cups of coffee based on the ratio:

7/1 = 7 x 120 / 7 = 170 cups of coffee

Therefore, Katie will use 170 cups of coffee."
"Response:  If John bought two pairs of shoes for each child, then he bought a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John paid in total:  
6 x $60 = $360"
"Response:  We know that each container can hold 5 cars and there are 2 containers on day 1, so we have 2 x 5 = 10 cars in total on day 1. On day 2, there are additional containers, but we don't know how many yet. So let's call the number of containers on day 2 ""x"". Then, we have 2x x 5 = 2x \* 5 cars on day 2. In total, we have 10 + 2x cars on both days. To find out how many containers were imported on day 2, we need to solve for x. We do this by setting up an equation based on the information given:

10 + 2x = 30 (total number of cars)

Now we can solve for x:

2x = 30 - 10

2x = 20

x = 10 (number of containers on day 2)

So, there were 10 containers imported on day 2."
"Response:  We know that Adrian's salary is 30% higher than Lily's salary, so we can start by finding out how much Lily earns. If Lily earns $x per year, then Adrian will earn $x x 1.3 = $x \* 1.3.
We also know that both of their salaries increased by 40% four years ago, so we need to find out what they earned four years ago and then calculate how much they would have earned if their salaries had increased by 40%.
Let's assume that Lily earned $50,000 four years ago (before the increase). Then, her current salary would be $50,000 x 1.4 = $70,000.
Adrian also earned $40,000 four years ago (before the increase), so his current salary would be $40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000.
Now, let's add up their current salaries: $70,000 + $56,000 = $126,000.
So, if Adrian and Lily received the same raise four years ago, their combined salary four years later would be $126,000.
However, since Adrian's salary was already 30% higher than Lily's before the raise, we need to adjust for that difference. To do this, we can multiply Lily's salary by 1.3 to match Adrian's pre-raise salary, and then add that amount to Adrian's current salary.
New total = ($70,000 x 1.3) + $56,000 = $91,000 + $56,000 = $147,000.
Therefore, if Adrian and Lily received the same raise four years ago, their combined salary four years later would be $147,000."
"Response: 

1. Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week.
2. If we assume that each pad has 30 sheets, then Miguel uses 60 sheets (2 x 30) per week.
3. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Miguel uses a total of 60 x 4 = 240 sheets per month."
"Response:  We know that Morissey has 5 apples and 8 oranges, so we can start by writing down what he has:

Morissey: 5A + 8O

Now, we know that Kale has twice as many apples as Morissey and half as many oranges. So, let's write down what Kale has:

Kale: 2(5) = 10A + (1/2)(8) = 10A + 4O

Now, we need to find out how many fruits in total they have. To do this, we add up what each of them has:

Total: Morissey + Kale = 5A + 8O + 10A + 4O = 13A + 12O

So, in total, they have 13 apples and 12 oranges."
"Response: 

Day 1: Monday (8 hours sleep) + Tuesday (6 hours sleep) = Total sleep time for 2 days = 8 + 6 = 14 hours

For the remaining 5 days of the week, Sadie slept for 1 hour less each day than she did on the previous two days. So, if she slept for x hours on each of those days, she would have slept for a total of 14 + x hours for the entire week.

Therefore, the answer is 14 + x hours, where x is the number of hours Sadie slept on each of the last 5 days of the week."
"Response:  We know that Roxie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers a distance of:

10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

Next, we know that she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for 4 hours, so she covers a distance of:

5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles

In total, Roxie runs for 7 hours and covers a distance of:

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles"
"Response:  We know that Jenny has two sets of letters - one with stamps and another without stamps. The set with stamps contains 30 letters, and each letter needs 2 stamps (1 for the envelope and 1 for the content). So, in total, there are 30 x 2 = 60 stamps in this set.  
Now, let's consider the second set of letters without stamps. There are 60 letters in this set, and each letter needs 2 stamps as well. Therefore, we need to place 60 x 2 = 120 stamps on these letters.  
In total, we have placed 60 + 120 = 180 stamps so far. However, we still need to stamp the remaining 30 letters from the first set without stamps. Each letter requires 2 stamps, so we need to place 30 x 2 = 60 more stamps.  
Therefore, the total number of stamps required is 180 + 60 = 240 stamps."
"Response:  We know that Julia purchased a package of new spoons for her dinner party at home. The number of spoons in the package is not specified, but we can make an educated guess based on the information provided.

Firstly, Julia used three spoons to taste the soup while cooking it. This means she had three spoons left after tasting the soup.

Secondly, her husband also bought five new packages of spoons and gave them to Julia. Since each package contains multiple spoons (we don't know how many), let's assume that each package contained five spoons as well. Therefore, Julia received a total of 5 x 5 = 25 new spoons from her husband.

Lastly, when Julia set the table, she found that there were 12 spoons in total. This includes the three spoons she used for tasting the soup and the 25 new spoons she received from her husband. So, the total number of spoons Julia had available for her dinner party was:

3 + 25 = 28

Therefore, the answer is 28 spoons."
"Response:  We know that Di Ran bought chicken sausages and fish sausages at the supermarket. The number of chicken sausages he bought is 38, and he also bought some extra fish sausages beyond the number of chicken sausages. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of fish sausages Di Ran bought.
Since he bought more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we know that x > 38 (since there are 38 chicken sausages).
We also know that Di Ran bought a total of 44 sausages (38 chicken sausages + x fish sausages).
So we can write an equation to represent this information:

44 = 38 + x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6

Therefore, Di Ran bought 6 fish sausages in addition to the 38 chicken sausages. In total, he bought 44 sausages."
Response:  We know that Amy has made 20 more friends than Lily, so if Lily has 50 friends, then Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends. Therefore, together, Lily and Abi have 50 + 70 = 120 friends.
"Response:  We know that each strawberry costs $3 times as much as an orange, so if one orange costs $x, then three oranges cost $3x. We also know that there are 20 oranges and 4 strawberries in total. So we can set up the following equation based on this information:

20 x + 4 (3x) =?

Now let's substitute the value of x, which is the price of one orange. If one orange costs $x, then three oranges cost $3x. Therefore, the equation becomes:

20 x + 4 (3x) = 20x + 12x = 40x + 4x = 44x

So the total cost of all the fruits is 44 times the price of one orange."
"Response: 

First, we need to calculate how much time each doctor spends with each patient. Since there are 500 patients and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total time spent by all doctors can be calculated as follows:

Total time = Number of patients x Average time per patient
= 500 x 24/60
= 500 x 0.4
= 200 hours

Next, we need to calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these consultations. If each doctor charges $150 per hour and sees an average of 24 patients per day (assuming they see only one patient at a time), their daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

Daily earnings = Number of patients x Doctor's fee per patient
= 24 x $150
= $3,600

Now, let's calculate the hospital's revenue. The hospital charges each patient $200 per hour, so its daily revenue can be calculated as follows:

Daily revenue = Number of patients x Hospital's fee per patient
= 500 x $200
= $1,000,000

Finally, we need to subtract the doctors' earnings from the hospital's revenue to find out how much profit the hospital makes.

Profit = Daily revenue - Doctors' daily earnings
= $1,000,000 - $3,600
= $967,400

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of approximately $967,400 per day."
"Response:  We know that 60 elves work at Nissa's department store during the holiday season. If 3/4 of them quit after being belittled by children, then we can calculate how many elves would have quit as follows:

60 x 3/4 = 45

So, 45 elves would have quit after being belittled by children. Now, if 10 more elves quit after being kicked in the shins, we can add this number to the previous total:

45 + 10 = 55

Therefore, there would be 55 elves left working at Nissa's department store."
"Response:  We know that Joseph spent $500 in May and $60 less in June. So we can start by finding out how much he spent in June:  
June spending = May spending - $60 
June spending = $500 - $60 
June spending = $440 
Now we add up the total amount Joseph spent in both months:  
Total spending = May spending + June spending 
Total spending = $500 + $440 
Total spending = $940 
Therefore, Joseph spent a total of $940 in May and June."
"Response: 

1. Pam rode the jet coaster twice, so she used 2 tickets for that.
2. Fred rode the jet coaster 4 times, so he used 4 tickets for that.
3. Both Pam and Fred rode the Ferris wheel twice, so they used 2 tickets each for that.

In total, Pam used 2 + 2 = 4 tickets, and Fred used 4 + 2 = 6 tickets. Therefore, they together used 4 + 6 = 10 tickets."
"Response: 

On Monday, Walter walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday, which is 6 x 4 = 24 miles.
So, Walter walked a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles from Monday to Wednesday.

Therefore, on Wednesday (water day), Walter walked 28 miles."
"Response: 

1. How many times does Tom wash his cars per year?
2. What is the total cost of washing each car?
3. Multiply the number of times he washes each car by its cost to find the annual expense for each car.
4. Add up the annual expenses for all four cars to get the total amount Tom spends on car washing per year.

Now let's fill in some numbers based on the information given:

1. Tom washes his cars every month, so he washes them 12 times per year (12 x $15 = $180).
2. The total cost of washing each car is $15.
3. Therefore, the annual expense for each car is $180 ($15 x 12).
4. Since Tom has four cars, the total amount he spends on car washing per year is $720 ($180 x 4)."
Response:  If Brian had 20 video games and gave away 5 of them before comparing with Bobby, then Brian would have 15 video games left (20 - 5 = 15). Since Bobby has three times as many games as Brian, Bobby would have 3 x 15 = 45 video games.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in total and 3/4 of them are Scottish Highland unicorns. So, the number of Scottish Highland unicorns is 27 x 3/4 = 20. Now we know that 2/3 of the Scottish Highland unicorns are females, so the number of female Scottish Highland unicorns is 20 x 2/3 = 13.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Roxie ordered:  

* 2 sandwiches x $7.50 each = $15.00  
* 2 bags of potato chips x $1.50 each = $3.00  
* 2 cookies x $1.00 each = $2.00  
Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00  
Now, let's add the delivery fee (20% of $20.00):  
Delivery fee = $20.00 x 20% = $4.00  
So, the total amount Roxie needs to pay is:  
Total amount = Total cost + Delivery fee = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00"
"Response: 

1. Mark took 75 questions test yesterday and finished it in 1 hour with a speed of 5 questions per hour.
2. Today, he takes a 100-question test at the same speed.
3. If he finishes the first test in 8 hours and the second test in 6 hours, then the total time taken for both tests is:

8 + 6 = 14 hours

Now, let's calculate how many questions Mark could not answer:

Total number of questions = 100 (for the second test) - 75 (for the first test) = 25

Therefore, Mark could not answer 25 questions."
Response:  If there are 12 blue gumballs, then there are 4 times as many pink gumballs, which is 12 x 4 = 48 pink gumballs.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 cars in total, and we have the following information about them:

* 12 cars are automatic (12/20 = 0.6 or 60%)
* 4 cars are manual (4/20 = 0.2 or 20%)
* The remaining 4 cars are semi-automatic (4/20 = 0.2 or 20%)

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is also 20%. Therefore, the correct answer is:

30% (60% + 20% + 20%)"
"Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and 2/3 of them are worker bees (i.e., not including the queen bee). So, we can start by finding out how many worker bees there are:

700 x 2/3 = 466.67 (round up to 467)

So, there are 467 worker bees. Now, we need to find out how many of these worker bees are red bees. We know that red bees make up half of all worker bees, so:

467 / 2 = 233.5 (round up to 234)

Therefore, there are 234 red bees among the 467 worker bees."
"Response: 

1. Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day, so he spends 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week playing video games.
2. He works for 1 hour each day as an alibi, so he works 7 days x 1 hour = 7 hours per week.
3. To calculate how much money Jordan earns in one week, we need to know his hourly wage for his part-time job. Let's assume his hourly wage is $15.
4. Therefore, Jordan's total weekly income from his part-time job is 7 hours x $15/hour = $105.
5. Now let's subtract the amount of time and money Jordan spends on video games from his total weekly income.
6. Total weekly income - Time spent on video games = $105 - (14 hours x $0/hour) = $105 - $0 = $105.

Therefore, Jordan earns $105 per week."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item without taxes:

* Milk (2 bottles x $2/bottle) = $4
* Eggs (1 dozen x $3/dozen) = $3
* Light bulbs (1 pack x $3/pack) = $3
* Cups (1 set x $3/set) = $3
* Trap (1 unit x $4/unit) = $4

Total cost before taxes = $4 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $17

Now, let's apply the 10% tax rate:

$17 x 0.10 = $1.70

So, the total cost with taxes is $17 + $1.70 = $18.70"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much revenue Lucas will generate each week if he has 3 customers and is negotiating with 5 potential customers. We know that each customer needs 2 bottles of cleaning solution ($2 x 2 = $4) and one pack of cloths ($5). So, total revenue per week for 3 customers would be:

3 customers x $4 (cleaning solution) + 3 customers x $5 (cloths) = $12 + $15 = $27

Now, let's add the potential customers. If he can secure all 5 potential customers, the additional revenue per week would be:

5 customers x $4 (cleaning solution) + 5 customers x $5 (cloths) = $20 + $25 = $45

Total weekly revenue for Lucas would then be:

$27 + $45 = $72

Finally, we need to subtract his expenses, which are only the cost of the cleaning solution and cloths:

$72 - ($2 x 2 = $4) - ($5 x 3 = $15) = $72 - $4 - $15 = $53

Therefore, Lucas's weekly profit would be $53."
"Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple farmland and each hectare has 100 pineapples. To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is:

10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare = 1,000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 1,000 pineapples every year."
"Response: 

First, Johnny picks up all the blocks from the first box with 500 pieces. That means he has 500 blocks in total.

Next, he picks up all the blocks from the second box with 500 pieces x 3 = 1500 pieces. So now, he has 500 + 1500 = 2000 blocks in total.

Finally, he picks up all the blocks from the third box with 1/4 of the number of pieces in the second box = 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces. Therefore, he has 2000 + 375 = 2375 blocks in total."
Response:  We know that in the first six hours, there were 30 bees who left the hive and 2/3 of them returned within six hours. This means that 2/3 x 30 = 20 bees returned within six hours. Now we need to find out how many bees will return during the last six hours. We know that twice as many bees left the hive during the second six-hour period as left during the first period (i.e., 2 x 30 = 60 bees). However, we also know that only half of these bees returned within six hours (i.e., 60 / 2 = 30 bees). Therefore, the total number of bees returning during the last six hours is 20 + 30 = 50 bees. So, Debora saw 50 bees returning to the hive during the last six hours.
Response:  We know that the adult ticket price is $12 and the child ticket price is $10. If Brittany's mother paid for one adult and one child ticket, she would have paid a total of $12 + $10 = $22. However, she received $8 in change, so she gave the cashier $22 - $8 = $14. Therefore, Brittany's mother gave the cashier $14.
"Response:  We know that Charlie has 3 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends. And James has 4 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has 4x friends. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Charlie has 3x friends and James has 4x friends. 

If they both have Facebook friends, then together they have 3x + 4x = 7x friends. 

Since there are 12 people in total who have Facebook friends (according to the problem), we can set up another equation:  

7x = 12. 

Solving for x gives us: 

x = 16. 

So Dorothy has 16 friends on Facebook, Charlie has 3 x 16 = 48 friends, and James has 4 x 16 = 64 friends."
"Response:  We know that Steve lives 3 miles away from school and can ride his bike at a speed of 1 minute 440 feet. Tim lives 2 miles away from school and can skateboard at a speed of 1 minute 264 feet. To determine who will arrive home first, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to travel their respective distances.  
For Steve: Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 1 min 440 ft/mile = 44 minutes (approximately)  
For Tim: Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 1 min 264 ft/mile = 26 minutes (approximately)  
Since Tim arrives home earlier than Steve, if Tim skateboards at a constant speed of 1 minute 264 feet per mile, he will arrive home before Steve does. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Tim""."
"Response: 

1. First, we know that 5 people came to inflate their tires.
2. Each person had three tires (front and rear tires for a bicycle), so there were a total of 5 x 3 = 15 tires to be inflated.
3. The cost per tire is $0.25, so the total amount earned that day was 15 x $0.25 = $3.75.
4. Three people inflated all three tires, so they paid $0.25 x 3 = $0.75 each.
5. One person came with one tire, so they paid $0.25.

Therefore, the total amount earned that day was $3.75 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $4.75."
"Response:  If Carl buys 10 packs of cookies at $0.10 per cookie, then he spends a total of:

10 x $0.10 = $1.00

So, if Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will receive:

$10 - $1.00 = $9.00

Therefore, the change that Carl will receive is $9.00."
"Response: 

Step 1: Dave bought fried potatoes in a large pack (let's call it x).

Step 2: The crow took half of the fried potatoes that Dave had eaten (half of x).

Step 3: Three pigeons took three pieces each from what was left (3 \* 3 = 9), leaving 6 pieces remaining.

Step 4: An otter took two-thirds of the remaining six pieces (2/3 \* 6 = 4), leaving two pieces remaining.

Step 5: A mouse took one piece (1), leaving only one piece remaining.

So, if Dave bought x fried potatoes, then:

x - (1/2)x = 5 (since the crow took half of x)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

Therefore, Dave bought 8 fried potatoes in the large pack."
"Response: 

First, we know that there are 4 days in a week (Monday to Thursday).

Second, we know that Kimoto attends 3 one-hour lectures each day from Monday to Wednesday. Therefore, he attends a total of 3 x 3 = 9 hours of lectures per week.

Third, we know that Kimoto attends 2 two-hour lectures each day from Tuesday to Friday. Therefore, he attends a total of 2 x 2 = 4 hours of lectures per week.

Fourth, we know that there are 16 weeks in a semester.

Now, let's calculate how many hours Kimoto spends in lectures for the entire semester:

9 hours/week x 16 weeks = 144 hours

Adding the 4 hours from Tuesday to Friday gives us a total of:

144 hours + 4 hours = 148 hours

Therefore, Kimoto spends 148 hours in lectures for the entire semester."
"Response:  We know that Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 bagels every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, and each bagel is 2 feet long. To find out how many feet of bread Bill bakes in total, we need to multiply the number of items by their length. First, let's calculate the total length of all the rolls: 
300 x 4 = 1200 inches (rolls)
Next, let's calculate the total length of all the chocolate croissants: 
120 x 6 = 720 inches (chocolate croissants)
Finally, let's calculate the total length of all the bagels: 
60 x 2 = 120 inches (bagels)
Now, add up all these lengths to get the total length of bread Bill bakes in one day: 
1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches
Therefore, if Bill were to line up all the bread he bakes in one day, it would be approximately 2040 inches or 170 feet long!"
"Response:  We know that there are three types of monkeys in total, and each type needs bananas per month as follows:

* Monkeys (200) x Bananas/Monkey = 200 x 1 = 200 bananas
* Gorillas (400) x Bananas/Gorilla = 400 x 2 = 800 bananas
* Hippos (100) x Bananas/Hippo = 100 x 3 = 300 bananas

Total number of bananas needed for two months:

200 + 800 + 300 = 1,300 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1,300 bananas every two months."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Break has run 15 rounds of the track, so he has covered a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.

Now, let's consider Kelly's runs. She has done 34 runs, and each run is 40 yards long, so she has covered a total distance of 34 x 40 = 1360 yards.

Since Kelly has only run one way and then returned, her net distance traveled is half of this amount, i.e., 1360 / 2 = 680 yards.

Therefore, the winner is Break, who has traveled 1500 yards, which is more than Kelly's 680 yards."
"Response: 

First, we know that Rafael bought 4 pens for $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on pens.

Next, we know that he bought 2 notebooks for $4 each, so he spent $8 on notebooks.

Finally, we know that he bought one bond paper for $20, so he spent $20 on bond paper.

In total, Rafael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34."
"Response: 

1. At first, there were 11 otamajakshi (otters) in the pond.
2. Suddenly, 6 of them hid under the lily pads.
3. Then, 2 of them hiding under the rocks emerged.

So, after these events, we can calculate how many otters are left in the pond as follows:

11 - 6 = 5 (otters hidden under lily pads)
5 - 2 = 3 (otters hidden under rocks)

Therefore, there are 3 otters left in the pond."
"Response:  We know that the depth of water in the tank on Monday was 17 feet. On Tuesday, the water level increased by 7 feet. So, the depth of water in the tank on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet. Now, we are asked to find the depth of water in the tank on Wednesday. Since the water level on Wednesday is three-fourths of the water level on Tuesday, we can set up a proportion:

Wednesday's water level : Tuesday's water level = 3/4 : 1

We know that Tuesday's water level is 24 feet, so we can substitute this value into the proportion:

Wednesday's water level = 3/4 x 24 = 18 feet

Therefore, the depth of water in the tank on Wednesday is 18 feet."
Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish in total. And Roxas caught fewer than Anakin by 5 less for each type of fish. So, Roxas caught 19 - 5 = 14 fish in total. Therefore, the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Roxas is 19 + 14 = 33 fish.
"Response: 

First, we know that the price of one bag of beads increases by 20% every two months. So if we start with $20, after two months, the price will be:

$20 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $24

So, after two months, the price of one bag of beads is $24.

Now, let's calculate the price after each additional month:

After three months:

$24 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $28.80

After four months:

$28.80 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $34.56

After five months:

$34.56 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $41.79

After six months:

$41.79 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $50.35

After seven months:

$50.35 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $60.59

After eight months:

$60.59 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $72.35

After nine months:

$72.35 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $86.23

After ten months:

$86.23 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $103.49

After eleven months:

$103.49 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $124.69

After twelve months:

$124.69 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $150.31

Therefore, after thirty-six months (three years), the price of one bag of beads would be $150.31."
"Response:  We know that there are five red cars and three action figures. Each action figure costs $5, so together they cost $5 x 3 = $15. The doll costs $3, so altogether these items cost $15 + $3 = $18. Since one red car costs $4, we can calculate the total value of all the toys as follows:

$18 (all toys) / $4 (one red car) = 4.5 (total number of red cars)

Therefore, there are 4 red cars in the room."
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of hiring an accountant. The question states that the cost is $90 per hour. Therefore, if Jackie decides to hire an accountant for one hour, she will have to pay $90.

Next, let's calculate the amount of time Jackie spends on her own tax preparation. The question states that she can save 3 hours by hiring an accountant. Therefore, if she spends 3 hours on her own tax preparation, she will lose $3 \times 35 = $105.

Now, let's compare the two options:

Option 1 (Hiring an Accountant):
Cost = $90 per hour x 1 hour = $90
Total Cost = $90

Option 2 (Doing it Herself):
Time Spent = 3 hours
Lost Income = $3 \times 35 = $105
Total Cost = $105

As we can see, Option 2 (Doing it Herself) has a higher total cost than Option 1 (Hiring an Accountant). Therefore, it makes sense for Jackie to hire an accountant to prepare her taxes, as she will end up saving money in the long run."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Elvira has a budget of €1500 for her computer and accessories. She spends €1090 on a machine with screen, keyboard, mouse, and scanner. This leaves her with €410 remaining in her budget.

Next, she buys a CD burner for €74 and a printer for €102, which brings her total expenditure to €1166. Since she has already spent all of her budget, there is no money left over for clothing or any other items. Therefore, the amount of money Elvira has available for clothes is zero (€0)."
"Response:  We know that Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish-style fran, and she has 9 eggs in total. So, if she wants to make 15 Spanish-style frans for the school fundraiser, how many times will she need to take care of the children?  
We can set up an equation based on this information:
15 (Spanish-style frans) x 3 (eggs per fran) = 45 eggs needed
Since Sandra has 9 eggs, we can subtract 45 - 9 = 36 eggs needed
Now, let's divide the number of eggs needed by the number of eggs Sandra has:
36 eggs / 9 eggs = 4 times
Therefore, Sandra needs to take care of the children 4 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish-style frans for the school fundraiser."
"Response:  We know that Brook is 2 years younger than Sess, so we can start with Sess' age.
Sess is 2 years older than Brook, so if Brook is x years old, Sess is x + 2 years old.
We also know that in 2 years, their combined age will be 28. So let's calculate their ages now and then add 2 to find out Sess' age.
Brook is x years old, so her current age is x.
Sess is x + 2 years old, so his current age is x + 2.
Their combined age now is:
x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2
Now, we need to make sure that their combined age in 2 years is equal to 28. So, we add 2 to our previous equation:
2x + 2 + 2 = 28
Simplifying:
4x + 4 = 28
Solving for x:
4x = 24
x = 6
So, Brook is 6 years old, and Sess is 6 + 2 = 8 years old."
"Response:  We know that Jimmy has twice as much money as Isal, and Isal has $8. So if we let J be the amount of money Jimmy has, we can set up the equation:

J = 2I

where I is the amount of money Isal has (which we know to be $8). Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

J = 2(8)

Simplifying, we have:

J = 16

So Jimmy has $16."
"Response:  We know that Pancho walks 20 miles per day from Monday to Friday (5 days). On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he only walks 10 miles per day. So, in total, Pancho walks:

20 miles/day x 5 days = 100 miles/week (Monday to Friday) + 10 miles/day x 2 days = 20 miles/week (Saturday and Sunday) = 120 miles/week."
"Response:  We know that each uniform consists of a hat (25 dollars), a jacket (three times the price of the hat), and pants (the average price of the hat and jacket). So we can start by calculating the cost of each item:

Hat: $25
Jacket: 3 x $25 = $75
Pants: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

Now we have the total cost of each uniform:

Total Cost = Hat + Jacket + Pants
= $25 + $75 + $50
= $150

So the total cost of one set of marching band uniforms is $150."
"Response: 

1. Jake is walking to the insect museum.
2. He sees 8-legged spiders with 80 individuals and 6-legged insects with 90 individuals.
3. Each of these creatures has multiple legs, so we need to calculate how many legs in total Jake sees.

For the spiders:
80 x 8 = 640 legs (from 80 spiders with 8 legs each)

For the insects:
90 x 6 = 540 legs (from 90 insects with 6 legs each)

Adding both totals gives us:
640 + 540 = 1180 legs

Therefore, Jake sees 1180 legs during his visit to the insect museum."
"Response:  We know that Grannie Red is 3 years older than Sally Two, so we can start with their ages as follows:
Grannie Red - 3 = Sally Two
Sally Two + 3 =? (Grannie Red's age)
Now, we know that Sally Four is 2 times as old as Sally Two, so we can add that to our equation:
Sally Two + 3 + 2(Sally Two) =? (Grannie Red's age)
Simplifying and solving for the unknown variable (Sally Two's age), we get:
Sally Two + 3 + 2(Sally Two) = 7 + 2(Sally Two)
= 7 + 2(5)
= 7 + 10
= 17
Therefore, Grannie Red is 17 years old.
Now, let's find out how many years old each of the other birds are. Since there are four birds in total, we can simply divide Grannie Red's age by 4 to find out how many years old each bird is:
17 / 4 = 4.25
So, each bird is approximately 4.25 years old."
"Response:  We know that Jessica wants to pay at least 50% more than the minimum amount for each loan. So, if we calculate the total monthly payment for each loan and then add them up, we can find out how much she needs to pay in total per year.

For the student loans:
Minimum monthly payment = $300 x 12 = $3,600 per year
Jessica wants to pay 50% more, so her annual payment would be:
$3,600 + (50% of $3,600) = $3,600 + $1,800 = $5,400 per year

For the credit card debt:
Minimum monthly payment = $200 x 12 = $2,400 per year
Jessica wants to pay 50% more, so her annual payment would be:
$2,400 + (50% of $2,400) = $2,400 + $1,200 = $3,600 per year

For the mortgage:
Minimum monthly payment = $500 x 12 = $6,000 per year
Jessica wants to pay 50% more, so her annual payment would be:
$6,000 + (50% of $6,000) = $6,000 + $3,000 = $9,000 per year

Adding all these amounts together gives us a total annual payment of:
$5,400 + $3,600 + $9,000 = $18,000 per year

So, Jessica needs to pay $18,000 per year to cover all her loans and debts."
"Response: 

1. Billy needs to peel and cut 60 potatoes for the barbecue event.
2. Each potato takes approximately the same amount of time to peel and cut (we'll assume 5 seconds per potato).
3. Billy can peel and cut one potato in 1.5 minutes.
4. To calculate how long it will take Billy to prepare all 60 potatoes, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the time it takes him to prepare one potato:

60 potatoes / 1.5 minutes/potato = 40 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 40 minutes to prepare all 60 potatoes."
"Response: 

First, we know that Carlos and Juan sell lemonade for $0.50 per cup.

Second, we know that they use 3 dollars worth of lemons and 2 dollars worth of sugar to make one gallon of lemonade.

Third, we know that they can make 20 cups of lemonade with one gallon.

Fourth, we know that they made a profit of $25 from selling lemonade.

Now let's calculate how much lemon they used based on their profit. We can do this by dividing their profit by the price of each cup of lemonade:

$25 / $0.50 = 50 cups

Since they can make 20 cups with one gallon, we can calculate how much lemon they used as follows:

50 cups / 20 cups per gallon = 2.5 gallons

Therefore, Carlos and Juan used 2.5 gallons of lemons to make $25 in profits."
"Response:  We know that there are 80 Japanese people and 60 Chinese men in total. So, if we subtract the number of Chinese men from the total number of Asian people, we get:  
Asian people - Chinese men = 240 - 60 = 180  
Now, let's divide the remaining Asian people (180) by the number of Japanese people (80):  
180 / 80 = 2  
So, there are 2 times as many women as men in the Chinese team. Therefore, there are 2 x 60 = 120 Chinese women in the team."
"Response: 

1. Salary: $6,000 per month
2. Rent: 1/4 of salary = $6,000 x 1/4 = $1,500 per month (assuming he spends all his salary on rent)
3. Fuel for car: 1/3 of salary = $6,000 x 1/3 = $2,000 per month (assuming he spends all his salary on fuel)
4. Charity: half of salary = $6,000 x 1/2 = $3,000 per month (assuming he donates half of his salary to charity)
5. Weekly expenses for daughter: $200 per week x 4 weeks = $800 per month
6. Expenses for wife (food and household items): $700 per month

Total monthly expenses: $1,500 + $2,000 + $3,000 + $800 + $700 = $9,000

So, after deducting all the expenses, Zeid has $6,000 - $9,000 = $0 left over each month."
"Response:  We know that Ran has 10 more crabs than Monica, and Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So we can start with these equations:

Monica has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs
Ran has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs
Bo has 40 crabs

Now we have three equations and three variables (Monica, Ran, and Bo). Can you solve for the number of crabs each person has?"
"Response: 

First week, Lloyd taught for 5 hours and earned $10 per hour, so he earned $50.
Next week, Lloyd taught for 8 hours, so he earned $80.
Total earnings for both weeks = $50 + $80 = $130."
"Response: 
1) The winner got 3/4 of the votes, so they got 80 x 3/4 = 60 votes.
2) The loser got the remaining 1/4 of the votes, which is 80 x 1/4 = 20 votes.
So, the number of votes the loser received is 20."
"Response:  We know that Sandra wants 4 times as many red roses as white carnations, so if she ordered 4x = 4(100) = 400 white carnations, then she must have ordered 4x - 400 = 4(100) - 400 = 3600 red roses.  
We also know that she wanted 5 times as many pink tulips as white carnations, so if she ordered 5x = 5(100) = 500 white carnations, then she must have ordered 5x - 500 = 5(100) - 500 = 4500 pink tulips.  
Therefore, in total, Fred needs to prepare 3600 + 4500 = 8100 flowers (red roses and pink tulips combined) before 5 pm to keep Sandra as a client."
"Response:  We know that Jane is 2 years older than Mark and Mark was half a year younger than Jan 2 years ago. So we can start with the fact that Jane is 2 years older than Mark.

Let M be Mark's age 2 years ago, then:
M = 2J - 1 (since Mark was half a year younger than Jan)

Now we know that Jane is 2 years older than Mark, so her current age J is:

J = M + 2

Substituting M = 2J - 1, we get:

J = (2J - 1) + 2
= 2J + 1

So Jane's current age J is equal to twice Mark's age 2 years ago plus 1. Since Jan is 30 years old now, we can substitute this value into the equation above:

J = (2(30) - 1) + 2
= 60 + 2
= 62

Therefore, Jane is currently 62 years old."
"Response:  The first team has four runners who each run 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So their total time for the relay is 4 x 55 = 220 seconds. Now let's look at the second team. Their first runner runs in 60 seconds, which means they are behind by 60 - 55 = 5 seconds right from the start. But then the next three runners all run faster than the corresponding runners of the first team, so they make up some ground. Specifically, each of the next three runners gains 3 seconds over the previous runner, so the total time for the second team is:

60 + (60 - 3) + (60 - 3 + 3) + (60 - 3 + 3 + 3) = 60 + 39 + 36 + 33 = 208 seconds

So the second team finishes 208 - 220 = 12 seconds behind the first team. Therefore, the winning margin is 12 seconds."
"Response: 

1. The probability of getting an even number is 3/6 = 0.5 (50%).
2. The probability of getting a 3 is 1/6 = 0.17 (17%).
3. Since Jerry rolls two dice, the probability of getting two consecutive evens is (0.5 x 0.5) = 0.25 (25%).
4. Now, we need to compare the probabilities of getting a 3 and two consecutive evens. We can see that the probability of getting two consecutive evens is higher than the probability of getting a 3. Specifically, the ratio of their probabilities is:

0.25 : 0.17 = 1.47 (approximately).

So, the probability of Jerry rolling three or more is approximately 1.47 times higher than the probability of him rolling two consecutive evens."
Response:  If Jenna picked half of her mother's number of strawberries, and her mother picked 20 strawberries, then Jenna picked 20/2 = 10 strawberries. So together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 strawberries.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 cages with the same number of mice in each cage, and each mouse is given 6 pieces of hay. So, if we multiply the number of cages by the number of mice in each cage, we get:

3 x (number of mice) = 3 x 6 = 18

So, there must be 18 mice in total. Now, let's consider the hamsters. There are 10 cages with one hamster in each cage, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of hay. Therefore:

10 x (number of hamsters) = 10 x 5 = 50

So, there must be 50 hamsters in total. Finally, we need to add up all the animals to find out how many pieces of hay have been distributed in total. We can do this by adding the number of mice and the number of hamsters:

18 + 50 = 68

Therefore, there are 68 animals in total, and each animal has received an average of 68 / 3 = 22.67 pieces of hay."
Response:  If Mandi borrows $100 from Benedict with an interest rate of 2% per month, then she will owe $100 x 2% = $2 in interest for each month. Since there are three months until she needs to repay the loan, she will owe a total of $2 x 3 = $6 in interest. Therefore, if Mandi pays back the original principal amount of $100 plus the accumulated interest of $6, she can settle her debt completely. So, she should pay $100 + $6 = $106 to Benedict three months later.
"Response:  We know that the merchant bought x bags of wheat from the farm for $20 per bag and sold each bag for $30. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x \* 20 = 400 (since the merchant made a profit of $400)

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 400 / 20

x = 20

So, the merchant sold 20 bags of wheat."
"Response: 

First, we know that the total cost of the tickets is $20.25 x 3 = $60.75.

Next, we know that they spent less than $60.75 on food, so let's call the amount they spent on food x. Then, we can set up the equation:

x + 3(33) = 60.75

where 3(33) represents the cost of two rides at $33 each.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 60.75 - 3(33)
= 60.75 - 66
= -6.90

So, they spent $6.90 on food.

Now, we need to find out how much each person paid. Since there are three people, we can divide the total cost by 3:

$60.75 / 3 = $20.25 per person

Adding the cost of food, we get:

$20.25 + $6.90 = $27.15 per person

Therefore, each person paid $27.15."
"Response:  We know that John can collect 2 apples per minute. If he collects apples for 3 hours (which is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes), then he will collect a total of:

180 minutes x 2 apples/minute = 360 apples

So, John will collect 360 apples in 3 hours."
"Response: 

1. There are 10 birds in the group, so there are 10 x 3.5 = 35 pounds of insects needed per day."
"Response: 

1. Tom plants 10 trees per year.
2. He harvests 2 trees per year.
3. So he has 10 - 2 = 8 trees left at the end of each year.
4. Since he starts with 50 trees, he has 50 - 8 = 42 trees after 10 years.
5. After 10 years, 30% of the trees will die (i.e., 30/100 x 42 = 12.6 trees).
6. Therefore, Tom will have 42 - 12.6 = 30.4 trees left after 10 years.

So, there will be 30.4 trees left after 10 years."
Response:  We know that there were initially 18 pink flamingos in the collection. On Saturday morning, they painted one-third of them white and returned them to Su's front yard. So, after painting, there were 18 - (1/3) = 12 pink flamingos left. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. Therefore, the total number of flamingos on Sunday afternoon is 12 + 18 = 30.
"Response:  We know that Bioletta wants to buy 5 different colors of crayons and she has $20 available for this purchase. Each crayon costs $2, so we can calculate how many crayons she can buy as follows:

$20 / $2 = 10

So, Bioletta can buy 10 crayons with her $20."
"Response:  We know that we have 8 pens in total and each pen has both a lead (lead pencil) and an eraser (rubber). So, if we calculate the cost of one pen, it would be the sum of the costs of its components. The cost of one lead pencil is $1.20, and the cost of one rubber is $0.30. Therefore, the cost of one pen would be:  
Cost of one pen = Cost of lead + Cost of rubber  
= $1.20 + $0.30  
= $1.50  
So, the total cost of 8 pens would be:  
Total cost of 8 pens = 8 x Cost of one pen  
= 8 x $1.50  
= $12.00"
"Response: 

1. Total amount of persimmons to be distributed = 200 pounds
2. Number of restaurants receiving persimmons = 40
3. Amount of persimmons each restaurant receives = 2 pounds

Now, let's calculate how much persimmon is left over after all the restaurants receive their share:

Total amount of persimmons to be distributed - (Number of restaurants x Amount of persimmons each restaurant receives)
= 200 pounds - (40 x 2 pounds)
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

Therefore, there are 120 pounds of persimmons left over after all the restaurants receive their share."
Response:  We know that there are 23,786 people living in Soda City, including 8,417 men and 9,092 women. This means that the total number of adults is 8,417 + 9,092 = 17,519. So, the remaining population must be children. Therefore, the number of children in Soda City is 23,786 - 17,519 = 6,267.
"Response: 

1st month: Elrain had 20 Pokémon cards.

2nd month: She collected 3 times as many cards as she had in the first month, so she collected 60 cards (3 x 20).

3rd month: She collected half as many cards as she collected in the second month, so she collected 30 cards (half of 60).

Now, let's add up all the cards Elrain has collected over the three months:

20 + 60 + 30 = 110

Therefore, Elrain has a total of 110 Pokémon cards."
"Response:  We know that Mark edits 1,000 words per week for each publisher and receives 5 cents per word from Publisher A. Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, Mark will receive 10 cents per word from Publisher B. Therefore, if Mark edits 1,000 words per week for both publishers, he will receive:

From Publisher A: 1,000 x 5 = $50
From Publisher B: 1,000 x 10 = $100
Total: $150"
"Response: 

In the morning, Baldr drinks 5 buckets of water, and each bucket contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, he drinks a total of 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning.

In the afternoon, Baldr drinks 6 buckets of water, and each bucket contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, he drinks a total of 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in the afternoon.

Therefore, the total amount of water that Baldr drinks per day is 25 + 30 = 55 liters."
"Response: 

First, John will receive $5,000 as a one-time payment for winning the award.

Next, he will receive a 5% raise in his salary, which means his new weekly earnings will be:

$2,000 x 1.05 = $2,100 per week

Now, let's calculate how much John will have earned in a year if he receives this raise from the start of the year:

$2,100 x 52 weeks = $109,200

So, John will have earned $109,200 in a year, including the one-time payment of $5,000 and the 5% raise."
Response:  We know that Joji has 10 acres of land and can produce 5 tons of grapes per acre per year. So she can produce 5 x 10 = 50 tons of grapes in total per year. Since each ton of grapes can be used to make 2 barrels of wine, Joji can produce 50 x 2 = 100 barrels of wine per year.
"Response: 

Day 1: Sandwiches (2 x 1 = 2 pieces of cheese)
Day 2: Breakfast omelette (1 piece of cheese more than sandwiches)
Day 3: Lunch and dinner sandwiches (2 x 2 = 4 pieces of cheese)
Total for 3 days: 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 pieces of cheese

Adding the macaroni cheese for one day (8 pieces of cheese), we get:
7 + 8 = 15 pieces of cheese in total."
Response:  First, Janet has 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she has a total of 32 pens. Next, she buys 6 bags of blue pens, each with 9 pens, for a total of 54 blue pens. She also buys 2 bags of red pens, each with 6 pens, for a total of 12 red pens. In total, Janet now has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.
"Response:  We know that Brinley has taken five tests so far and has scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 points respectively. To calculate her average score, we need to find out how many points she would have gotten if she had not received any of those scores. In other words, we need to subtract the lowest score from her total score.
Let's assume the lowest score is 71. If Brinley did not get any of the previous scores, her total score would be:
Total score = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 458
Now, let's subtract the lowest score (71):
Total score - 71 = 458 - 71 = 387
So, Brinley's average score without the lowest score would be 387/5 = 77.4.
Since Brinley has already taken five tests, she needs to score at least 77.4 on the sixth test to maintain her average score."
"Response:  We know that Michael rode his bicycle for 4 weeks and each week he rode it 5 times, covering 25 km each time. That means he rode a total of 4 x 5 = 20 km per week. Since he only rode twice a week after that, we need to calculate how far he rode during those 3 weeks.

Let's do that:

Week 1: 2 x 25 km = 50 km
Week 2: 2 x 25 km = 50 km
Week 3: 2 x 60 km = 120 km (since he rode twice a week)

Total distance traveled in 3 weeks: 50 + 50 + 120 = 220 km

Therefore, Michael rode a total of 220 km over the course of 3 weeks."
"Response:  We know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and there are 25 of them in total. So, the total weight of all the chocolate bars is:

25 x 40 = 1000 grams

Now, we also know that each piece of candy (chocolate bar + rice candy) weighs twice as much as the chocolate bar alone. Therefore, the total weight of all the candies is:

1000 x 2 = 2000 grams

So, the total weight of Joe's Halloween candy bag is 2000 grams or 2 kilograms."
"Response: 

Day 1 (Monday): Rose bought 4 cakes.

Day 2 (Tuesday): Rose bought 3 times as many cakes as she bought on Monday, so she bought 4 x 3 = 12 cakes.

Day 3 (Wednesday): Rose bought 5 times as many cakes as she bought on Tuesday, so she bought 12 x 5 = 60 cakes.

In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes over 3 days."
"Response:  We know that $20$ dozen cups cost $6000$, so each cup costs $\frac{6000}{20} = \boxed{\mathbf{300}}$.
Now we are given that $12$ half-dozen cups cost $\boxed{\mathbf{900}}$. Since there are $6$ cups in a half-dozen, we can calculate the cost of one cup as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Cost per cup} &= \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of cups}} \\
&= \frac{\boxed{\mathbf{900}}}{\boxed{\mathbf{6}}} \\
&= \boxed{\mathbf{150}}.
\end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the total cost of $20$ dozen cups is:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Total cost} &= \text{Number of cups} \times \text{Cost per cup} \\
&= 20 \times \boxed{\mathbf{150}} \\
&= \boxed{\mathbf{3000}}.
\end{aligned}$$
So the total cost of $20$ dozen cups is $\boxed{\mathbf{3000}}$."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Sarah wants to buy a jacket and two pairs of shoes, so she needs $30 + $20 = $50 in total.

Secondly, we know that Sarah has already saved $10, so she only needs to earn an additional $50 - $10 = $40.

Thirdly, we know that Sarah can earn $5 per day by taking care of children, so she needs to work for $40 / $5 = 8 days.

Therefore, if Sarah has already saved $10 before starting to take care of children, she will need to work for 8 days to earn enough money to buy her desired items."
"Response:  We know that Jerry has x white chickens and y red chickens. Since he collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up an equation based on this information.  
Let's start with the number of eggs produced by each type of chicken:
* Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day (x + y)  
* White chickens produce 5 eggs per day (x)  
Now let's add these two equations together to find out how many eggs Jerry collects in total:  
Total eggs = (x + y) * 3 + x * 5  
Simplifying this equation, we get:  
Total eggs = 3x + 9y  
Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up another equation:  
42 = 3x + 9y  
Solving for x and y, we get:  
x = 7  
y = 6  
So Jerry owns 7 red chickens and 6 white chickens."
"Response: 

First, we know that Gerry walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour.

Second, we are given two distances he walks: 1.5 miles and 6 miles.

Third, we need to find out how long it takes him to walk each distance.

Let's start with the shorter distance first - 1.5 miles. We can use our formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Substituting the values we have:

Time = 1.5 miles / 3 miles/hour

Time = 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)

Now let's move on to the longer distance - 6 miles. Using the same formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Substituting the values we have:

Time = 6 miles / 3 miles/hour

Time = 2 hours

Therefore, Gerry spends 30 minutes walking 1.5 miles and 2 hours walking 6 miles. In total, he spends 2 hours and 30 minutes walking in the park."
"Response: 

Day 1: Stone entered 100 customers.

Day 2: There were 50 more customers than Day 1, so there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Day 3: If there were 500 customers in total, then on Day 3, there would be 150 + (500 - 150) = 150 + 350 = 450 customers."
"Response:  We know that the large pool has twice as much water as the small pool at 4 minutes ago. So, if the small pool had x gallons of water, the large pool would have had 2x gallons of water.
Now, we know that 1 minute later, the large pool lost 1/4 of its water, so it lost 2x/4 = x/2 gallons of water.
Since the small pool gained this amount of water, it now has x + x/2 = 3x/2 gallons of water.
Therefore, the small pool currently has 3x/2 gallons of water."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Roxie needs in total for the shoes and belt. We know that the shoes cost $320 and the belt costs $32, so the total amount needed is:

$320 + $32 = $352

Now, we want to find out how many hours Roxie needs to work to earn this amount of money at her hourly wage of $8. To do this, we can divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage:

$352 / $8 = 44 hours

So, Roxie needs to work for 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt."
"Response: 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Janet will pay over the 12 months. Since she promised to pay $165 per month for 12 months, her total payment will be:

$165 x 12 = $1,980

Next, let's calculate the interest rate as a decimal. We know that the interest rate is 10%, so we can convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100:

10% ÷ 100 = 0.10

Now, we can calculate the total amount of interest that Janet will pay over the 12 months. To do this, we multiply the principal (the initial amount borrowed) by the interest rate as a decimal:

$2,000 x 0.10 = $200

So, the total amount of interest that Janet will pay over the 12 months is $200.

Finally, we add the total amount of interest to the original principal to find out how much Janet will owe after 12 months:

$2,000 + $200 = $2,200

Therefore, after 12 months, Janet's debt balance will be $2,200."
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more daisies than roses. So if we let R be the number of roses, then the number of daisies is 7 + R. In total, there are R + (7 + R) = 2R + 7 flowers in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 2R + 7.
"Response: 

First, we know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet. So if Harriet is x years old, Adrian is 3x years old.

Second, we know that Zach is half of Harriet's age. So if Harriet is x years old, Zach is (1/2)x years old.

Now let's assume that Harriet is 21 years old (as given in the problem). Then we can substitute this value into our equations to find Adrian and Zach's ages:

Adrian = 3(21) = 63 years old
Zach = (1/2)(21) = 10.5 years old

Now, we need to find the average age of all three people after 3 years. We can calculate their ages after 3 years using the same formula:

Harriet = 21 + 3 = 24 years old
Adrian = 63 + 3 = 66 years old
Zach = 10.5 + 3 = 13.5 years old

So, the average age of all three people after 3 years is:

(24 + 66 + 13.5) / 3 = 104.5 / 3 = 34.83 years old

Therefore, the average age of all three people after 3 years will be approximately 34.83 years old."
"Response:  We know that Naomi got 68 points and Brieana got 17 more than Naomi. So, Brieana got 68 + 17 = 85 points. 
We also know that Yuri got half of Naomi's points plus 10. Half of 68 is 34, so Yuri got 34 + 10 = 44 points. 
Finally, we can calculate Jojo's score by subtracting the total number of points earned by Naomi, Brieana, and Yuri from 251. That gives us:  
251 - (68 + 85 + 44) = 251 - 297 = -46
So, Jojo scored 46 points."
"Response: 

1. Crossword puzzles: Carmen can solve each crossword puzzle in 10 minutes.
2. Sudoku puzzles: Carmen can solve each sudoku puzzle in 5 minutes.
3. Total number of puzzles: Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent by Carmen on both types of puzzles:

For crossword puzzles:
Time = Number of puzzles x Time per puzzle
= 3 x 10 min/puzzle
= 30 minutes

For sudoku puzzles:
Time = Number of puzzles x Time per puzzle
= 8 x 5 min/puzzle
= 40 minutes

Total time spent by Carmen over the weekend:
Total time = Time for crossword puzzles + Time for sudoku puzzles
= 30 minutes + 40 minutes
= 70 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes (or 1 hour and 10 minutes) solving puzzles over the weekend."
"Response: 
Firstly, Serene used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
120 - 90 = 30 liters
Now, since it rained and collected twice the amount of water that was left in the tank, we can calculate the total amount of rainwater as follows:
Total amount of rainwater = 2 x 30 = 60 liters
Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is:
120 - 60 = 60 liters"
"Response: 
Firstly, Andy has 90 Zeraniums, and each Zeranium has 10 petunias, so he has 90 x 10 = 900 petunias from the Zeraniums.
Now, he has to plant 40 more petunias, so in total, he has 900 + 40 = 940 petunias."
"Response:  We know that the company spent $15,000 in one year and used 3/4 of that amount for the next year. So we can calculate as follows:  
First year expenses: $15,000  
Second-year expenses (using 3/4 of first-year expenses): $15,000 x 3/4 = $10,500  
Total expenses over two years: $15,000 + $10,500 = $25,500"
"Response:  We know that Carlos rented a canoe for $30 per hour and Benji rented a banana boat for $18 per hour. If they used their equipment for different amounts of time, we need to calculate how much each person paid in total.

Carlos used the canoe for 3 hours, so he paid:

$30 x 3 = $90

Benji used the banana boat for 5 hours, so he paid:

$18 x 5 = $90

Since both people paid the same amount ($90), the total cost for both is:

$90 + $90 = $180

Therefore, the combined rental fee for both Carlos and Benji is $180."
"Response: 

Day 1: Andrew leaves New Jersey by car.

Day 2-3: Andrew travels by bus from New York to Rochester (6 days).

Day 4: Andrew arrives in Rochester and spends the day exploring the city.

Day 5: Andrew returns to New Jersey by car (half the time it took to get there).

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will spend is:

Day 1 + Day 2-3 + Day 4 + Day 5 = 8 days."
"Response: 

Firstly, James has 8 water-type cards and he wants to get rid of them. So, if he gets 8 new grass-type cards, the probability that any one card will be a water type is 8/8 = 1.

Secondly, there are 40 water-type cards in total, so the probability that any one card is a water type is 40/72 = 1/2.

Therefore, the probability that at least one of the 14 newly purchased grass-type cards is a water type is (1/2) x 14 = 7.

So, the probability that any randomly selected card from the remaining 76 cards (30 fire-type + 20 grass-type + 40 water-type - 8 water-type) is a water type is 7/76 = 1/11."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the basic burrito price without any upgrades or extras. Basic Burrito Price = $6.50 Next, we need to add any upgrades or extras that Chad ordered. Upgrade/Extra 1 (additional meat) = $2.00 Upgrade/Extra 2 (additional cheese) = $1.00 Upgrade/Extra 3 (avocado) = $1.00 Upgrade/Extra 4 (source) = $0.25 Total Upgrades and Extras = $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.25 = $4.25 Now, let's add the total cost of the upgrades and extras to the basic burrito price. Total Cost = Basic Burrito Price + Upgrades and Extras = $6.50 + $4.25 = $10.75 Finally, we need to subtract the gift card amount from the total cost. Gift Card Amount = $5.00 Subtracting the gift card amount from the total cost gives us the final bill amount. Final Bill Amount = Total Cost - Gift Card Amount = $10.75 - $5.00 = $5.75 So, Chad's final bill amount is $5.75.
"Response: 

Step 1: Mother puts in half of the pieces (360/2 = 180).

Step 2: Calinda puts in 4 times as many pieces as her mother (180 x 4 = 720).

Total number of pieces put in: 180 + 720 = 900.

Therefore, it will take 900 / 4 = 225 minutes to complete the puzzle."
"Response: 

First, Ashurin visited the farm 2 months after the small pumpkins were planted, and 30% of them were harvestable. This means that 30% of 120 = 36 pumpkins were ready to be picked.

Ashurin took 36 pumpkins home with her.

Two weeks later, when she visited the farm again, 4/3 of the remaining pumpkins (i.e., 4/3 x 96) were harvestable. Since 4/3 of 96 is equal to 72, there were 72 pumpkins left that had not been harvested yet.

Therefore, the total number of pumpkins that Ashurin could have taken home was 36 + 72 = 108."
"Response: 

1. Total cost of 1 car = $20,000 (given)
2. Tax rate for cars = 10% (given)
3. Registration fee per car = $1,000 (given)
4. Number of cars purchased = 12 (given)
5. Total amount paid for all cars =?

Now let's calculate:

Total cost of all cars = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000
Tax on all cars = 10% of $240,000 = $24,000
Registration fees for all cars = 12 x $1,000 = $12,000

Total amount paid for all cars = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000"
Response:  We know that on Monday, Kaili collected 5 more shells than Robert, so if Robert collected 20 shells, then Kaili collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kaili collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collected 2 x 25 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kaili collected 50 shells on Tuesday.
"Response:  If there are 50 ants in the garden and each ant can carry 1/2 of a red bean, then the total number of red beans carried by all the ants is:  
50 x (1/2) = 25 red beans.
Therefore, if there were 50 ants in the garden, they could have carried a maximum of 25 red beans."
"Response:  We know that there are initially 36 penguins in total. If 3/4 of them (3 x 36 = 72) enter the cave to eat food, then how many penguins remain outside? The remaining number is equal to the difference between the initial number and the number entering the cave: 

36 - 72 = 56

Therefore, there are still 56 penguins left outside who continue to sunbathe."
"Response: 

First, we know that Steve wants to eat twice as much tomatoes as his girlfriend, so he needs to eat 2 x 6 = 12 tomatoes per day.

Second, we know that one cherry tomato plant can produce 3 tomatoes per week, so Steve will need 12 / 3 = 4 plants to meet his daily demand.

Therefore, Steve will need 4 x 1 week = 4 weeks' worth of cherry tomato plants to sustain his diet."
"Response:  We know that John wants to order enough slices for all of his friends (20 people) and he wants each person to have 4 slices. Since there are 8 slices per pizza, we can calculate how many pizzas John needs to order as follows:

20 people x 4 slices/person = 80 slices

Since each pizza has 8 slices, John will need to order:

80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
Response:  If Ram has 25 pens and each pen can be refilled with ink from other pens, then he can collect ink from 5 empty pens to fill one pen. So, if we let X represent the number of times Ram can reuse the ink, then he can use X + 5 pens. Since there are 25 pens in total, Ram can use a maximum of 25 + 5 = 30 pens.
"Response: 

First, Johnny added $10 to his initial allowance of $20, so he had a total of $30.

Then, he invested this money and it tripled in value over the course of one year. So, if he started with $30, he would have $30 x 3 = $90 after one year.

Therefore, Johnny has $90 at the end of the year."
"Response:  We know that Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, and Joan is 5 years older than Jess. So we can start with these two equations:

1. Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
2. Joan's age = Jess's age + 5

Now, let's substitute equation (2) into equation (1):

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Joan's age = Jess's age + 5

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

Mary's age = (Jess's age + 5) - 2

Simplifying, we have:

Mary's age = Jess's age + 3

So, if Jess is 20 years old, then Mary is 20 + 3 = 23 years old.

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three women is:

Mary's age + Joan's age + Jess's age = 23 + (5 years older than Jess) + 20
= 23 + 5 + 20
= 48

So, the total age of the three women is 48 years."
"Response:  We know that there are 1,000 students in total and 30% of them leave through exit A. That means 300 students (1,000 x 0.3) leave through exit A.  
Now, we have 700 students left (1,000 - 300). Of these remaining 700 students, 5/3 or 2/3 (700 / 3) leave through exit B. This means 466 students (700 x 2/3) leave through exit B.  
So, now we have 234 students left (700 - 466). These students all leave through exit C, so the number of students who leave through exit C is 234."
"Response:  We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so if Robert has x candies, then James has x + 6 candies. We also know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so if Robert has x candies, then John has 2x candies. Finally, we are told that John has 54 candies. So let's set up an equation based on this information:

x + (6) = 2(x)

Simplifying the equation:

x + 6 = 2x

Subtracting x from both sides:

6 = x

Therefore, Robert has 6 candies. Now we can find out how many candies James and John have:

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so he has:

6 + 6 = 12 candies

John has twice as many candies as Robert, so he has:

2(6) = 12 candies

So James has 12 candies, and John has 12 candies."
"Response: 

Firstly, Dr. Dolittle reads two books. So he has read 2 books.

Next, Pandora also reads one book. So she has read 1 book.

Now, let's add up the number of books that both of them have read. Dr. Dolittle has read 2 books and Pandora has read 1 book, so together they have read 3 books.

Therefore, if Dr. Dolittle and Pandora each read their own books as well as one another's books, then together they would have read a total of 3 books."
"Response: 

1. Total time spent writing letters per week = (Number of letters written x Time taken to write each letter) + (Number of letters received x Time taken to read and respond to each letter)

Since Mike writes 2 letters per week, we can calculate the total time spent writing letters as follows:

Total time spent writing letters per week = (2 x 5 minutes/letter) + (0 x 6 minutes/letter) (since he receives no letters)

Total time spent writing letters per week = 10 minutes + 0 minutes = 10 minutes

Therefore, Mike spends 10 minutes per week writing letters."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Jason has 1,000 minutes of call time for the month.

Secondly, he talks to his boss every day for 15 minutes, so he uses up 15 x 30 = 450 minutes for the month.

Thirdly, he makes other calls totaling 300 minutes for the month.

Now, let's calculate how many minutes are left for the month:

1,000 - 450 - 300 = 250 minutes

Therefore, there are 250 minutes left for the month."
"Response: 

1. Griffin had 24 fried potatoes and Kyle took 5 of them.
2. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 2 x 5 = 10 more.
3. Ginger gave some to Griffin, but not all. Let's say she gave him x potatoes (x < 24).
4. Colby took fewer than Kyle, so he took 3 less than 5 = 2 fewer.
5. Finally, Griffin has 24 - (5 + 10 + x) = 24 - 16 = 8 left.

Now we can solve for x. Substituting x < 24 into the equation above, we get:

8 = 24 - 16 + x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So Ginger gave Griffin 8 fried potatoes."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 turtles in one aquarium and 32 turtles in another aquarium. The difference between them is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. So we can set up an equation as follows:

Let x be the number of fish in the first aquarium (including turtles).
Then the number of fish in the second aquarium is 32 - x.
The total number of fish in both aquariums is x + (32 - x) = 2x.
Since the difference between the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish, we have:

2x = 4 + (32 - 4) = 2x + 28

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

2x + 28 = 2x + 28

Simplifying, we get:

2x = 28

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 14

So there are 14 fish in the first aquarium, including 4 turtles."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Gene paid for each makeup session. We know that she had four sessions per week and each session lasted six hours, so she spent 6 x 4 = 24 hours per week on makeup. Since there were five weeks in total, Gene spent 24 x 5 = 120 hours on makeup.

We also know that Gene was charged $250 per hour, so her total cost for all five weeks of makeup would be:

120 hours x $250/hour = $30,000

Now, let's consider the discount that the makeup artist gave Gene. We are told that the artist offered a 10% discount, which means that Gene only had to pay 90% of the original price. So, if Gene originally owed $30,000, she would have paid:

$30,000 x 0.9 = $27,000

Therefore, Gene paid $27,000 for all five weeks of makeup."
Response:  We know that Isabel spent $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 = $74 in total for her sister's birthday party supplies. Since she is splitting the cost equally with her parents, each of them will pay $\frac{74}{3} = 24\text{ dollars}$.
Response:  We know that there are four bags of onions and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, in total, the chef has bought 4 x 50 = 200 pounds of onions. Since one pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost for all the onions is 200 pounds x $1.50 per pound = $300.
Response:  We know that Su eats twice as much cookies as her sister on Tuesday. So if her sister eats 5 cookies on Monday, Su will eat 5 x 2 = 10 cookies on Tuesday. On Wednesday, her sister eats 13 - 5 = 8 more cookies than she did on Monday, so Su will eat 10 + 8 = 18 cookies on Wednesday. In total, Su eats 10 + 18 = 28 cookies. The calorie intake of each cookie is assumed to be 200 calories, so Su consumes 28 x 200 = 5600 calories.
