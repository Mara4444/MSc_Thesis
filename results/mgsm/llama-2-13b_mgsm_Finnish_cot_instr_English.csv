Response:  First, we know that Janet sells two dozen fresh eggs daily at $2 each, so her income from egg sales is:  2 dozen x $2/dozen = $4/day   Since she has three meals per day and eats one-third of an egg for each meal (3 meals x 1/3 egg/meal), she consumes:  3 meals x 1/3 egg/meal = 1 egg/day   Therefore, she has 15 eggs left after consuming one egg per day, which she can sell:  15 eggs - 1 egg = 14 eggs/day   So, her total daily income from both egg sales and consumption is:  4 dollars/day + 14 dollars/day = 18 dollars/day
Response:  First, we need to find out how many white threads are needed for one pukuu.  We know that each pukuu needs half of a white thread. So, if we have two white threads, we can make four pukuus (2 x 2 = 4). Therefore, we need half of one white thread for each pukuu, which is equal to 0.5 white threads.  Now, let's calculate how many black threads are needed for one pukuu. We know that each pukuu needs two black threads. So, if we have two black threads, we can make four pukuus (2 x 2 = 4) as well. Therefore, we need two black threads for each pukuu.  Finally, we can calculate how many pulttii are needed in total. Since we need four pukuus to make one pultti, and each pukuu requires two black threads and half of one white thread, we can conclude that we need eight black threads and four white threads to make one pultti.  In summary, we need: 8 black threads and 4 white threads to make one pultti.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Josh paid for the house and renovations:  
80,000 (purchase price) + 50,000 (renovation costs) = 130,000 dollars. Next, let's find out what the increased value of the house is after renovations:  
150% increase in value x 130,000 (original cost) = 245,000 dollars. Finally, we subtract the original purchase price from the increased value to get the profit:  
245,000 - 80,000 = 165,000 dollars. So, Josh made a profit of $165,000 on his investment."
Response:  If James runs three sprints of 60 meters each, three times a week, that means he runs a total of 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week.  Since each sprint is 60 meters long, James runs a total distance of 9 x 60 = 540 meters per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each chicken gets three cups of mixed feed per day, which includes grains, worms, and vegetables to keep them healthy. Secondly, we are given that Wendi feeds her chickens twice a day - in the morning and in the evening. Finally, we are asked how many cups of food she needs to give to her chickens in the last meal of the day if her flock has 20 chickens.  To begin with, let's calculate the total number of cups of food needed for all the chickens in one day:  3 cups/chicken x 20 chickens = 60 cups/day Now, since Wendi feeds her chickens twice a day, she needs to provide half of the daily amount at each meal:  60 cups/day / 2 meals/day = 30 cups/meal So, in the morning, Wendi needs to provide 30 cups of food for her chickens, and in the evening, she needs to provide another 30 cups. Therefore, the answer is:  30 cups + 30 cups = 60 cups
Response:  First, we know that each full glass costs $5, so the total cost of 16 full glasses would be:  16 x $5 = $80  Now, we also know that each half glass costs 60% of the full price, so the cost of 4 half glasses (since there are 16 in total) can be calculated as follows:  4 x ($5 x 0.6) = $24  Therefore, the total cost of all 16 glasses is:  $80 + $24 = $104
Response:  First, we know that there are twice as many lamps in Toulouse as in Charleston. So if Charleston has x lamps, then Toulouse has 2x lamps.  Next, we know that Charleston has four times as many lamps as Seattle. So if Seattle has y lamps, then Charleston has 4y lamps.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  2x + 4y =?  We know that there are a total of 20 lamps in Seattle, so we can substitute that into our equation:  2x + 4y = 20.  Solving for x and y gives us:  x = 10 and y = 5.  Therefore, there are 10 lamps in Toulouse, 40 lamps in Charleston, and 5 lamps in Seattle.  The sum of these numbers is:  10 + 40 + 5 = 55.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute normally. This means she can download 2 \* 60 = 120 GB in an hour. Now, if 40% of the file is downloaded and then Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes, then we need to calculate how much of the file has been downloaded during those 20 minutes. We know that 40% of the file is equal to 40/100 = 0.4 \* 200 GB = 80 GB. So, after the restart, only 80 GB of the file has been downloaded. Therefore, the total amount of time required to download the entire file would be: Total time = (120 GB - 80 GB) / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that John drives at an average speed of 60 miles per hour (mph) for two hours (2t), so he covers a distance of:  Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 t = 120 miles  Next, we know that John increases his speed to 80 mph and drives for another half hour (0.5 t), so he covers an additional distance of:  Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 0.5 t = 40 miles  Therefore, the total distance John travels is: Total Distance = Distance + Distance = 120 miles + 40 miles = 160 miles Now, let's calculate how far John is from home after four hours (4t):  Since John starts driving at 3 pm and needs to be back home by 7 pm, we know that he has been driving for four hours (4t). So, if he started 160 miles away from home, he would now be: Distance = Speed x Time = 160 miles x 4 t = 640 miles away from home  However, since John increased his speed during the last half hour of his journey, we need to adjust the calculation accordingly:  Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 0.5 t = 40 miles  Therefore, John is only 40 miles away from home after four hours of driving.
Response:  First, we know that Elisa worked for 45 hours this week.  Of those 45 hours, she worked her first 40 hours at $10 per hour, which is $400 (40 x $10).  Next, we know that she received overtime pay for the remaining 5 hours at 1.2 times her regular rate of pay, which is $12 per hour (1.2 x $10).  So, the overtime pay for those 5 hours is $60 ($12 x 5).  Therefore, Elisa's total earnings for the week are $460 ($400 + $60).
"Response:  We know that in the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times. In the second month, it was downloaded three times as many times as in the first month, so we can calculate that as follows:  
In the second month, the program was downloaded = 60 x 3 = 180 times.  Now let's look at the third month. The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month, so we can calculate that as follows:  
In the third month, the program was downloaded = 180 x 0.7 = 126 times.  Therefore, over the course of three months, the program was downloaded a total of:  
Total number of downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 426 times."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Toula paid for each type of pastry.  For the donuts, she paid $68 per dozen, so one donut costs $68/12 = $5.67.  For the mini cupcakes, she paid $80 per dozen, so one mini cupcake costs $80/12 = $6.67.  And for the mini juusto-kakku, she paid $55 per dozen, so one mini juusto-kakku costs $55/6 = $9.17.  Now that we have the cost of each item, let's add them up.  Toula spent $5.67 x 3 (donuts) + $6.67 x 2 (mini cupcakes) + $9.17 x 6 (mini juusto-kakku) = $5.67 x 3 + $6.67 x 2 + $9.17 x 6 = $17.01 + $14.04 + $55.62 = $86.77.  Therefore, Toula spent a total of $86.77 on pastries.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend on planting and maintaining the tree for each year.  Planting cost = $90  Annual maintenance cost (3 dollars x 2 years) = $6 Yearly expenses = $90 + $6 = $96 Now, let's calculate how many years it will take before Carlos starts making a profit from his citrus tree.  Profit per year = 7 sitruuna x $1.5 per sitruuna = $10.5 per year Total profit after n years = $10.5 x n Years needed to start making a profit = $10.5 x (n - 1) / 6 Since Carlos spends $96 per year, he needs to sell at least $96 worth of sitruunas to break even.  To find out when this happens, we can set up an equation:  
$10.5x(n-1)/6 = $96  Solving for n, we get:  n = 96/10.5 = 9  So, Carlos will start making a profit in the 9th year after planting his citrus tree."
Response:  First, we know that Melanie sold one-third of the imuri to green houses (3/10), two-thirds to red houses (2/10), and half of what was left to orange houses (1/2). So let's start with the total number of imuri she had:  5 x 10 = 50  Now, let's see how many she sold to each color house:  Green: 3/10 x 50 = 15 Orange: 1/2 x 50 = 25 Red: 2/10 x 50 = 10 Total sold: 15 + 25 + 10 = 40 Now, let's find out how many are left: 50 - 40 = 10 So there are 10 imuri left for Melanie.
Response:  We know that 20% of the students studied contemporary dance, so there were 20/100 = 2 students who studied contemporary dance.  Similarly, we can find out how many students studied jazz dance and hip-hop dance.  There were 25% of the students who studied jazz dance, so there were 25/100 = 2.5 students who studied jazz dance.  And finally, we have 75% of the students who studied hip-hop dance, so there were 75/100 = 3.75 students who studied hip-hop dance.  In total, there were 2 + 2.5 + 3.75 = 8 students who participated in the dance competition.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the value of each option in one month from now. For the jewelry option, we have:  
Value of jewelry = $5000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5000 x 1.025 = $5125  For the electronics option, we have:  
Value of electronics = $8000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8000 x 1.012 = $8096  Now, let's compare the two options and find out which one would give us the highest profit. We can see that the value of the jewelry option is higher than the value of the electronics option after one month. Therefore, if Kauppias wants to maximize his profit, he should choose the jewelry option. The difference between the two values is:  
Profit = Value of jewelry - Value of electronics = $5125 - $8096 = $-2971  So, if Kauppias chooses the jewelry option, he will make a profit of $-2971."
Response:  First day: Both trains travel west for 80 miles. Since they are going in opposite directions, their distances traveled will be additive. So one train has traveled 80 miles west and the other train has traveled 80 miles east. Total distance = 160 miles. Second day: Both trains travel north for more than 240 kilometers (we don't know exactly how much). Again, since they are going in opposite directions, their distances traveled will be additive. So one train has traveled more than 240 kilometers north and the other train has traveled more than 240 kilometers south. Total distance = more than 480 kilometers. Therefore, the total distance covered by both trains in two days is: Total distance = 160 + (more than 480) = 640 kilometers.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate Jill's weekly earnings as an instructor and a coach separately. As an instructor, she works for 35 hours per week and her hourly wage is $20, so her weekly earnings are:  
Weekly Earnings as Instructor = 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week  As a coach, she works for 15 hours per week and her hourly wage is also $20, so her weekly earnings are:  
Weekly Earnings as Coach = 15 hours/week x $20/hour = $300/week Now that we have Jill's weekly earnings for both roles, let's calculate her annual salary. She works for 50 weeks per year (assuming a standard work year with two weeks of vacation), so her total annual earnings as an instructor are:  
Annual Earnings as Instructor = $700/week x 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year Similarly, her total annual earnings as a coach are:  
Annual Earnings as Coach = $300/week x 50 weeks/year = $15,000/year Finally, we add up her annual earnings from both roles to get her total annual salary:  
Total Annual Salary = $35,000 + $15,000 = $50,000/year"
Response:  If Claire eats three eggs every morning and there are four weeks in a month, then she eats 3 x 4 = 12 eggs per week. Since there are four weeks in a month, Claire eats 12 x 4 = 48 eggs per month. Therefore, she consumes 48 eggs per month or 6,912 eggs per year (48 x 12).
Response:  First, we know that Marissa walked for 4 miles in the first hour at an average speed of 6 kilometers per hour. So she covered 4/6 = 0.67 miles per hour in the first hour. Now, let's find out how fast she needs to walk to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles in the second hour. We can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (speed), and t is the time. In this case, d = 8 miles, r =?, and t = 1 hour. To find the value of r, we can rearrange the equation as follows: r = d / t. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: r = 8 / 1 = 8 miles per hour. Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 8 miles per hour to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles in the second hour.
Response:  First, we have 10 liters of orange juice that is two-thirds water and one-third orange juice. So, if we multiply 10 by 2/3, we get 6.67 liters (approximately) of water in the orange juice. Next, we add 15 liters of pineapple juice to it, which is three-fifths water. If we multiply 15 by 3/5, we get 9 liters (approximately) of water in the pineapple juice. Now, when we mix both juices together, we will lose 1 liter of water from the orange juice because we added 1 liter of pineapple juice. Therefore, the total amount of water left after mixing is: 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters (approximately). Finally, since there are 24 liters in total, we can find out how much water is left by dividing 14.67 by 24: 14.67 / 24 = approximately 0.61 or 61% of the total volume is water.
Response:  We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so we can write an equation based on this information:  Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6  Now we are given that Samantha is 31 years old now, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:   Raymond's age = 31 + 6 = 37  So, Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23 years old (since he had his son at 23), which means the son was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.
Response: 1) First three customers buy one DVD each, so 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs are sold. 2) Next two customers buy two DVDs each, so 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs are sold. In total, 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs are sold. So, Billy sells 7 DVDs on Tuesday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the candle burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour. Secondly, we are given the time period of interest, which is from 13:00 to 17:00 hours (4 hours). Thirdly, we need to calculate how much shorter the candle will be after these 4 hours have passed. To do this, we can use the formula: Total distance = Rate x Time. In our case, the total distance the candle will burn in 4 hours is: Total distance = 2 cm/hr x 4 hrs = 8 cm. So, the candle will be 8 cm shorter after burning for 4 hours.
"Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50, which is 25% off the original price. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
$19.50 = $25 x (1 - 0.25)  Simplifying the equation:  
$19.50 = $25 x 0.75  Solving for the original price of the book:  
$25 x 0.75 = $19.50  Original price of the book = $30  Therefore, the original price of the book was $30."
Response:  First, we know that Marie paid $12 for one can of soda, so each can cost $12. Next, we know that she paid $5 for five apples, so each apple costs $5/5 = $1. Finally, we know that she paid $3 for four oranges, so each orange costs $3/4 = $0.75. Now let's add up all these prices to find out how much Marie paid in total: Total price = $12 + ($1 x 5) + ($0.75 x 4) = $12 + $5 + $3 = $20. So Marie paid $20 in total. To find out how many pizzas Marie ordered, we need to subtract the total price of the other items from the total amount she paid: Number of pizzas = $50 - $20 = 30. Therefore, Marie ordered 30 pizzas.
Response:  First, we know that Mishka bought three pairs of shorts, so she spent $16.5 x 3 = $49.50 on shorts. Next, she bought three pairs of pants, so she spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on pants. Finally, she bought three pairs of shoes, so she spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes. In total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 on clothes.
Response:  First, we know that Cynthia eats one scoop of ice cream every night, so she consumes 365 scoops in 60 days (since there are 365 days in a year).  Next, we know that each pack contains 15 scoops, so she needs 24 packs to consume all 365 scoops (365 / 15 = 24).  Finally, since each pack costs $4, her total cost for 60 days would be 24 x $4 = $96.
Response:  First, we know that Henry stopped for 20 miles after traveling 60 miles. So he traveled 60 - 20 = 40 miles before his first stop.  Now, we know that he stopped again 15 miles before the end of his journey. So he traveled 40 + 15 = 55 miles between his two stops.
Response:  First, we know that one of the korkokengät costs $33 and the other two times as much, so the second korkokengä costs $33 x 2 = $66.  Now, we need to find out how much the two pairs of shoes cost in total.  The first pair of shoes (the ones that fit Gloria's budget) costs $33 + $66 = $99.  Since Gloria has a budget of $100, she can afford to buy these two pairs of shoes.  So, the total cost of the two pairs of shoes is $99 + $99 = $198.
Response:  First, we know that Darrelli...
Response:  First, we know that the first person said there are 80 in a box. Second, the second person said they have 20 more than half of the first number, which is 20 + (half of 80) = 20 + 40 = 60. Third, the third person said they have 25% more than the first number, which is 125% of 80 = 100 + 25% of 80 = 100 + 20 = 120. So, the average of these three numbers is (80 + 60 + 120) / 3 = 260 / 3 = 86.67.
Response:  There are ten dogs in total.  Each dog spends half an hour per day on walks and errands. So, each dog spends half an hour x 10 = 5 hours per week on walks and errands.  Since there are ten dogs, John spends 5 hours x 10 = 50 hours per week taking care of all his dogs.
Response:  We know that there are 110 coins in total and 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let X be the number of silver coins, then the number of gold coins is 30 more than X. In other words, the number of gold coins is X + 30. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information: X + (X + 30) = 110... 2X + 30 = 110 Subtracting X from both sides gives us: 2X = 80 Solving for X, we get: X = 40 Therefore, there are 40 silver coins and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has five more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So if Raymond has 40 jewels, then half of them are 20.  Aaron has five more than 20, so he has 25 jewels.  Now we know that Siobhan has two fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.
Response:  First 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more than before. So, if he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, he will score (4 x 1.25) = 5 points in the second 20 minutes. Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is 4 + 5 = 9 points.
Response:  First, we know that Terry eats two yogurts per day, so he consumes 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts in 30 days.  Next, we are told that each yogurt costs $4, so the total cost of all 60 yogurts is 60 x $4 = $240.  Therefore, Terry spends $240 on yogurt in 30 days.
Response:  First, we know that John has 13 Lego series and he sells each one for $15. So, if he sells all of them, he will have $180 (13 x $15).  Next, we know that he spends $20 on eight video games, so he has $160 left ($180 - $20). Finally, we know that he has $5 left, so he has a total of $165 left after selling all his Legos and buying video games.  Now, let's calculate how many Legos he has left. We can do this by subtracting the number of Legos he sold from the total number of Legos he had:  13 - (13 x $15) =?  To solve for the unknown variable, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:  13 - (13 x $15) = $165  Simplifying the equation, we get:  13 - $195 = $165  Solving for the unknown variable, we get:  13 - $195 = $165  This gives us:  13 - $195 = 5  Therefore, John has 5 Legos left after selling all his other Legos and buying video games.
Response:  First, we know that John runs for three days a week, so he has three running sessions per week.  Second, we know that he runs for three hours on the first day and half as much (i.e., one hour) on the other two days.  Finally, we know that he runs a total of 100 kilometers per week.  So, let's calculate his average speed per session:  Total distance run per week = 3 x 3 hours + 2 x 1 hour = 9 hours + 2 hours = 11 hours  Total distance run per week = 100 km  Therefore, his average speed per session is:  100 km / 11 hours = 9.09 km/h  Now, let's find out how fast he runs during each session:  Session 1 (first day): 3 hours x 9.09 km/h = 27.27 km/h Session 2 (second day): 1 hour x 9.09 km/h = 9.09 km/h Session 3 (third day): 1 hour x 9.09 km/h = 9.09 km/h  So, John runs at an average speed of 27.27 km/h during his first session, 9.09 km/h during his second session, and 9.09 km/h during his third session.
Response:  First, we know that Dana can walk at a speed of 2 miles per hour.  If she walks for 6 hours, she will cover a distance of 6 x 2 = 12 miles.  Now, let's consider her running speed.  We are given that she can run four times faster than she can walk, so her running speed is 4 x 2 = 8 miles per hour.  Since she runs for only one-third of the time, her total running distance is 1/3 x 6 = 2 hours x 8 = 16 miles.  Therefore, Dana's total distance traveled in 6 hours is 12 + 16 = 28 miles.
Response:  First, we know that Benin is two years older than Suzy's iPhone. So if Suzy's iPhone is one year old, then Benin's iPhone is three years old (2 + 1 = 3).  Next, we know that Brandon is four years older than Benin's iPhone. So if Benin's iPhone is three years old, then Brandon's iPhone is seven years old (4 + 3 = 7).  Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is seven years old.
Response: 1) Without holding the sapphire, Polly can throw the golden spear to a distance of 400 feet (based on the information given). 2) With the sapphire in her hand, she can throw it three times farther than without the sapphire (also based on the information given). So, if we multiply 400 by 3, we get 1200 feet as the maximum distance that Polly can throw the golden spear with the sapphire in her hand. Therefore, the correct answer is 1200 feet.
Response:  Firstly, there were five omelette pies in total.  Secondly, each pie was cut into eight pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces was 5 x 8 = 40. Thirdly, 14 pieces were left over at the end of the evening. So, the number of pieces taken away by the guests can be calculated as follows: 14 - 40 = 26. Thus, 26 pieces of omelette pie were taken away by the guests.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 250 calories in one serving of puffed rice. Secondly, we know that there are 300g of puffed rice in each bag. Finally, we know that our daily calorie intake is 2000 calories and we have already consumed 1800 calories. So, to calculate how many servings of puffed rice we can eat, let's divide our remaining calorie intake (2000 - 1800 = 200) by the number of calories in one serving (250). This gives us: 200 / 250 = 4/5 or 80% of a serving. Since each serving is 50g, we can eat 80% of 50g = 40g of puffed rice. Therefore, the answer is 40g.
Response:  First, we know that Charlie can make 10 curved candles for every pound of wax he has. So if he wants to sell each candle for $2, how many pounds of wax will he need to produce in total?  To find out, we multiply the number of candles he plans to sell (20) by the weight of one candle ($2 / $10 per pound). This gives us:  20 x $2 / $10 = 4 pounds  Since Charlie needs 10 pounds of wax to make 10 curved candles, he will need 4 pounds more to make an additional 20 candles. Therefore, his total revenue from selling all 30 candles would be:  10 pounds x $10 per pound + 4 pounds x $10 per pound = $100 + $40 = $140  Now let's calculate his net profit. He spends $10 per pound of wax and $5 per pound of wick, so his total cost is:  10 pounds x $10 per pound + 4 pounds x $10 per pound = $100 + $40 = $140  His net profit is therefore: Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $140 - $140 = $0  In other words, Charlie breaks even by selling 30 curved candles at $2 each.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. So, if she wrote x articles on Monday, then she wrote 2x/5 + x = 7 articles on Tuesday (since there are 5 days in a week, and she wrote 2 extra articles on Tuesday).  On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday, so she wrote 2(2x/5 + x) = 4x + 14 articles on Wednesday. Finally, on Thursday, she wrote k articles, where k is some constant.  Therefore, the total number of articles written during the three days is:  
3x + 4x + k = 7x + 14 + k  Simplifying, we get:  
10x + k = 21  Solving for x, we get:  
x = 21 - k  Now, we need to find out how much time she spent writing these articles. We know that each article takes her 4 hours to write, so the total time spent writing all the articles is:  
Time = Number of articles x Time per article = (7x + 14 + k) x 4 = 28x + 56 + 4k hours  Substituting x from the previous equation, we get:  
Time = 21 - k x 4 = 21 x 4 - k  Since she worked for 3 days, the total time spent working is:  
Total time = 3 x Time per day = 3 x (28x + 56 + 4k) = 84x + 168 + 12k hours  Now, we need to find out what value of k gives us the correct total time. To do this, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem statement:  
84x + 168 + 12k = 210  Since we want the total time to be exactly 210 hours, we can equate the two expressions:  
84x + 168 + 12k = 210  Simplifying, we"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Candice had 80 post-its in her bag before she went to work at the cafe. Secondly, we know that she used one post-it per cup for each of the 220 cups she served. Finally, we are told that she had 23 post-its left over after serving all the cups. So, let's calculate how many post-its were in the packet she bought:  
23 (left) = 80 (starting amount) - (220 x 1) = 80 - 220 = -140  Since the number of post-its cannot be negative, we can conclude that there were 140 post-its in the packet she bought."
"Response:  First, we know that John bought twice as many red roses as blue ones. So if he bought x blue roses, he bought 2x red roses. We also know that each blue rose cost $40 and each red rose costs $1.5 times more than a blue rose (or $40 x 1.5 = $60).  Now let's calculate how much John paid for all of his roses:  For the blue roses, he paid $40 x x = $40x.  For the red roses, he paid $60 x 2x = $120x.  Total amount paid = $40x + $120x = $160x.  Since John spent $200 on all of his roses, we can set up an equation:  
$160x = $200  Solving for x gives us:  x = 120/160 = 3/4 or x = 75.  Therefore, John bought 75 blue roses and 150 red roses (since he bought twice as many red roses as blue roses).  To find out how much he paid for the blue roses, we can substitute x into our previous equation:  
$40x = $40(75) = $3000.  Finally, to find out how much he paid in total, we add the cost of the blue roses to the cost of the red roses:  
Total amount paid = $3000 + $120(150) = $3000 + $18000 = $21000.  Therefore, John paid $21000 for all of his roses."
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a meter-long stick to support the tomato plants in her garden.  If she cut the stick into 15 centimeter pieces, how many pieces will she get?  To find out, we can divide the length of the stick (meter) by the length of each piece (centimeters):  
1 meter = 100 cm  Therefore, 15 cm / 100 cm = 0.15 or 15/100 = 1/7  So, Tracy got 7 pieces of 15 centimeter long sticks from one meter long stick."
Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 apartments.  That means there are 120 apartments in total (15 x 8).  Now we need to find out how many of those apartments are vacant.  We are told that 3/4 of the building is occupied, so we can start by multiplying 120 by 3/4 to get the number of occupied apartments:  120 x 3/4 = 90  So, there are 90 occupied apartments in the building.  To find out how many vacant apartments there are, we simply subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments:  120 - 90 = 30  Therefore, there are 30 vacant apartments in the building.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many dozen eggs Lloyd sells in a week (1 week = 7 days x 24 hours/day = 168 hours).  We know that he sells 252 eggs per day, so in one week, he sells:  
252 eggs/day x 7 days = 1,792 eggs/week  
Now, we know that each dozen eggs costs $2, so the total revenue from egg sales is:  
1,792 eggs/week x $2/dozen = $3,584/week  
Therefore, Lloyd earns $3,584 per week from his egg sales."
Response:  First we need to calculate how long it takes for Tomin to sail at his top speed of 10 miles per hour. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 10 miles / 10 miles/hour Time = 1 hour Now we need to calculate how long it takes for Tomin to return at a speed of 6 miles per hour. Again, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = (10 miles x 2) / 6 miles/hour Time = 2 hours So, Tomin will spend 1 hour sailing at his top speed and 2 hours returning at a slower speed, for a total time of 3 hours.
Response:  First, we know that Uurian has to reduce the weight of his backpack by 15 kg.  Second, we know that each comic book weighs half a kilogram and each toy weighs half a kilogram as well.  Third, we are given that Uurian has 30 comic books and wants to remove them from his backpack.  So, let's calculate how much weight he can save by removing the comic books:  Weight saved = Number of comic books x Weight per comic book  Weight saved = 30 x 0.5 kg  Weight saved = 15 kg Now, we need to find out how many toys Uurian needs to remove to reach his goal of reducing the weight of his backpack by 15 kg.  To do this, we will set up an equation based on the information given:  Total weight of backpack before removal = Total weight of backpack after removal + Weight saved  Total weight of backpack before removal = (Number of comic books x Weight per comic book) + (Number of toys x Weight per toy)  Total weight of backpack before removal = (30 x 0.5 kg) + (x x 0.5 kg)  Where x is the number of toys Uurian needs to remove.  Solving for x, we get:  x = 12  Therefore, Uurian needs to remove 12 toys from his backpack to achieve his goal of reducing its weight by 15 kg.
Response:  First, we know that on Tuesday (torstai), the mechanic earned $60 x 6 = $360 from six truck tires and $40 x 4 = $160 from four car tires, for a total of $520. On Friday (perjantai), the mechanic earned $60 x 12 = $720 from twelve cars, but did not earn any money from truck tires, so the total income for the day is $720 + $520 = $1,240. Therefore, the mechanic earned more income on Friday than on Tuesday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Patchy has three times as many adopted kitten pups as Trixy. So if Trixy has 12 adopted kittens, then Patchy must have 3 x 12 = 36 adopted kittens.  Therefore, there are in total 36 + 12 = 48 adopted kittens in Doubtfire's family.
Response:  First, we know that Jean has 30 pieces of sugar and she eats two pieces. That means she has 30 - 2 = 28 pieces left. Now, she wants to pack the remaining sweets into two bags. Can she do it? Yes, she can! Since each bag can hold half of the total number of sweets, and there are two bags, we need to find out how many sweets each bag can hold. Half of 28 is 14, so each bag can hold 14 sweets. Therefore, Jean can pack all 28 sweets into two bags of 14 sweets each.
"Response:  First, we know that Peter has $42 dollars per week.  He spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn each time he goes to the movies. So if he wants to go to the movies more than once in one week, he needs to have enough money left over after buying his tickets and snacks to cover those additional costs.  To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, let's set up an equation based on this information:  
Ticket price = $7  
Popcorn price = $7  
Total cost per trip = Ticket price + Popcorn price = $14  
Number of trips = Total cost per trip / (Ticket price + Popcorn price) = $42 / ($14 x 2) = 6  
Therefore, Peter can go to the movies six times with his $42 dollars per week."
Response:  First we need to calculate the total weight of the truck with the driver and empty: 1760 kg (1.76 tons). Then we add the weight of one box: 5 kg. To exceed the bridge limit of 5000 kg, we need to load more boxes than:  5000 - 1760 = 3240 kg / 5 kg/box = 648 boxes.
Response:  First, we know that Stephen paid $40 for his meal.  Next, we know that there was a 25% service charge added to the bill, which is $10 (25% of $40).  So, the total amount Stephen paid before taxes and tips was $50 ($40 + $10).  Now, we are told that Stephen also paid $3 in delivery fees.  Therefore, the final cost of Stephen's meal, including all charges and taxes, was $53 ($50 + $3).
Response:  First, we know that each pumpkin has 20 individual fruits (hedelmää) and 67 total fruits (yksittäistä hedelmää).  So, if we multiply 20 x 67, we get:  20 x 67 = 1340  Therefore, there are 1340 individual grapes in total.
Response:  First, we know that 25% of the apples are bad, so we can subtract that from the total number of apples.  That leaves us with 75%. Next, we know that 20% of the remaining apples are not yet ripe, so we can subtract that from the total number of good apples.  Now we have our final answer!  There are 30 good apples (75% x 80%).
Response:  First, we know that Janet paid $500 for the materials to make the tiara. Then she paid $800 to the person who made the tiara. Finally, she paid a 10% commission on the total cost of the tiara. So let's calculate the total cost of the tiara first: Total Cost = Materials + Labor Total Cost = $500 + $800 Total Cost = $1300 Now we can calculate the commission: Commission = Total Cost x 10% Commission = $1300 x 10% Commission = $130 To find out how much Janet paid in total, we add up all these amounts: Total Paid = Materials + Labor + Commission Total Paid = $500 + $800 + $130 Total Paid = $2400 Therefore, Janet paid $2400 for the tiara.
"Response:  First, we know that Jos Marcy gets $50,000 per year as an annuity for 20 years, so he will receive a total of $1,000,000 (50,000 x 20).  After 20 years, his pension increases by 5% each year, so in year 30, his pension will be:  
$50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^20 = $50,000 x 2.678 = $133,900 per year.  Therefore, if Jos Marcy retires after 30 years, his annual pension will be $133,900."
"Response:  First, we know that Aleena paid $140 per month for her streaming service.  Second, we are told that the company charged her 10% less in the second half of the year.  So, if she paid $140 per month for the first six months (half a year), she would have paid a total of:  
$140 x 6 = $840  Now, since the company reduced their charges by 10%, they would have charged Aleena:  
$840 x 0.9 = $756 For the remaining six months of the year.  Therefore, Aleena's total payment for the entire year is:  
$840 + $756 = $1,596"
Response:  First, we know that Sophia has traveled 160 kilometers since her last fill-up and needs to refill with 4 gallons of gasoline.  We also know that her car's tank holds 40 liters of fuel.  To determine how far Sophia can drive on one tank, we need to calculate how many kilometers she can travel based on the amount of fuel in her tank.  We can do this by dividing the number of liters of fuel in the tank (40) by the distance she can travel per liter of fuel (which we will calculate below).  So first, let's find out how many kilometers Sophia can travel per liter of fuel.  We know that there are 1000 milliliters in a liter, so we can convert the volume of fuel from liters to milliliters:  40 liters x 1000 ml/L = 40,000 ml  Now we need to know how many kilometers Sophia can travel per 40,000 milliliters of fuel.  According to the problem, she has already driven 160 kilometers since her last fill-up, so we can subtract that distance from the total distance she could potentially travel based on the amount of fuel left in her tank:   Total distance = 40,000 ml / km per 40,000 ml  Since we don't know exactly how many kilometers Sophia can travel per liter of fuel, we can use an average fuel economy estimate of about 25 miles per gallon (or approximately 40 kilometers per liter):  Therefore, the total distance Sophia can travel on one tank is:   Total distance = 40,000 ml / 40 km/L = 1000 km or approximately 621 miles  Based on this calculation, Sophia can drive approximately 621 miles (1000 km) on one tank of gasoline.
Response:  First, we know that Jim spends two hours watching TV three times a week, so he watches TV for a total of 6 hours per week (2 x 3 = 6).  Next, we know that he spends half of his time reading, so he reads for half of the remaining time, which is half of 4 weeks or 2 weeks (since there are 4 weeks in a month). Therefore, Jim spends 2 weeks (or 1440 minutes) reading each month.  Now let's calculate how many minutes he spends on TV and reading altogether. We can add the number of minutes he spends on TV to the number of minutes he spends reading:  6 hours/week x 60 minutes/hour = 3600 minutes/week + 1440 minutes/month = 5040 minutes/month Total minutes spent on TV and reading per month: 5040 minutes.
Response:  We know that there are four schools participating in the basketball tournament, and each school has both a boys' and girls' team with five players each. So, we can start by calculating how many students are involved in total.  There are 4 schools x 2 teams per school (boys and girls) = 8 teams x 5 players per team = 40 students per school. Since there are four schools, we multiply 40 by 4 to get the total number of students involved: 40 x 4 = 160 students.  Now let's consider the coaches. Each team has one coach, so we need to add the number of coaches for all eight teams: 8 teams x 1 coach per team = 8 coaches. Finally, we add the number of students and coaches to find out how many people have been sent from the schools: 160 students + 8 coaches = 168 people. Therefore, a total of 168 people have been sent from the four schools to participate in the basketball tournament.
Response:  We know that there were 175 timanttia (diamonds) in the chest, and 35 rubiinia (rubies).  So, if we subtract the number of diamonds from the total number of precious stones, we get: Total precious stones - Diamonds = Rubies + Smmaragdes 175 - 35 = 2 x 175 = 350  Therefore, there were 350 jalokivia (precious stones) in the chest, including diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in the school. So if there are x girls, there will be 2x boys.  Since each teacher has 60 girls and 5 boys, we can set up the following system of linear equations:  

60x + 100 = 300... (1)   
60(2x) + 100 = 300... (2)

Solving this system of equations, we get:  x = 40.  Therefore, there are 40 girls in the school.  And since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are 80 boys in the school."
Response:  First, we know that Bailey starts with some amount of money and gets $5 per week for 8 weeks.  We also know that after 8 weeks, she has $100. So let's set up an equation to represent this information.  Let x be the initial amount of money Bailey had. Then we can write:  x + (5 x 8) = 100  Simplifying this equation, we get:  x + 40 = 100  Subtracting 40 from both sides gives us:  x = 60  Therefore, Bailey started with $60.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Judy earns per day.  To do this, we can multiply the number of dance lessons she teaches per day (5) by the cost per student (15 dollars).  This gives us:  
5 x 15 = 75 dollars per day  Next, we need to calculate how much money Judy earns per week.  To do this, we can multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):  
75 x 7 = 525 dollars per week Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Judy earns per month by multiplying the weekly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):  
525 x 4 = 2080 dollars per month So, Judy earns $2080 per month teaching dance and singing lessons."
"Response:  If one recipe has twice as many instructions as the other, and the second recipe has 20 instructions, then we can find out how many instructions are in the first recipe by dividing 20 by 2.  
Result: The first recipe has 10 instructions (20 / 2 = 10).  Therefore, Kelianilla needs to read 10 + 2 x (number of instructions in the second recipe) = 10 + 2 x 20 = 40 instructions."
"Response:  First, we know that Tommy sells brownies for $3 each and juustokakkuja for $4 each.  So if he sells x brownies and y juustokakkuja, his total revenue will be:  
Revenue = 3x + 4y  Now, we are given that Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 juustokakkuja.  So we can substitute these values into our equation to find out how much money Tommy makes in total:  Revenue = 3(43) + 4(23)  Revenue = 129 + 92  Revenue = 221 dollars  Therefore, Tommy makes $221 in total."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sheila borrowed.  Total = $150 x 5 units = $750. Next, we need to calculate the interest for each unit. Interest per unit = $750 x 2% = $15. Now, let's calculate the monthly payment for three months. Monthly payment = Total / Number of payments Monthly payment = $750 / 3 payments = $250 per month. So, Sheila will have to make three monthly payments of $250 each.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Artie will make from each type of flower.  We know that he sells each type of flower at a discounted price, so we need to find out what that discounted price is.  The problem tells us that Artie usually sells cultas for $2.74 per bouquet, petunias for $1.87 per bouquet, and begonias for $2.12 per bouquet.  However, today he has rounded all prices to the nearest dollar, so we need to round those numbers up.  So, the discounted prices for each type of flower are:  Cultas: $3.00 per bouquet (rounded from $2.74) Petunias: $2.00 per bouquet (rounded from $1.87) Begonias: $2.50 per bouquet (rounded from $2.12)  Now, let's calculate how much money Artie will make from each type of flower:  Cultas: 12 bouquets x $3.00 per bouquet = $36.00 Petunias: 9 bouquets x $2.00 per bouquet = $18.00 Begonias: 17 bouquets x $2.50 per bouquet = $42.50  Total amount earned: $36.00 + $18.00 + $42.50 = $96.50
Response:  First, we know that each level of the sandcastle has half the area of the level below it.  So if the top level has an area of 16 square meters, then the second level will have half that area, or 8 square meters.  The third level will have half the area of the second level, or 4 square meters.  And the bottom level will have half the area of the third level, or 2 square meters.  Therefore, the total area of all four levels is:  16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square meters.
Response:  First year: 1 cup of dog food per day x 365 days = 365 cups of dog food. Total amount of dog food needed for first year: 365 cups x 110 g/cup = 39750 grams or approximately 40 kg. For the rest of the dog's life (let's assume it lives for 10 years), Cecilia needs to feed her dog two cups of dog food per day x 365 days per year x 10 years = 7300 cups of dog food. Total amount of dog food needed for the entire lifetime: 7300 cups x 110 g/cup = 799000 grams or approximately 800 kg.
"Response:  First, we know that Sarah makes 4 times as many pyjamas as David, so if David makes x pyjamas, Sarah makes 4x pyjamas.  Second, we know that Jos makes just as many pyjamas as Raymond, so if Raymond makes y pyjamas, Jos also makes y pyjamas.  Now, let's say that the total number of pyjamas made by all three is z.  We can write an equation based on this information:  
z = x + 4x + y  Simplifying the equation:  
3x + y = z  Solving for x:  
x = (z - y) / 3  Substituting the value given in the problem:  
x = (400 - y) / 3  Since Sarah makes 4 times as many pyjamas as David, we can set up another equation using the same logic:  
4x = 4(z - y) / 3  Combining these two equations, we get:  
5x = 4z - 2y  Solving for x:  
x = (4z - 2y) / 5  Now, we need to find out how many pyjamas David and Raymond make together.  We know that they make a total of 400 pyjamas, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  
4x + y = 400  Simplifying the equation:  
4x + y = 4(z - y) / 3 + y  Substituting the values we found earlier:  
4x + y = 4(400 - y) / 3 + y  Combining like terms:  
4x + y = 1600 - 2y + y  Simplifying:  
4x + y = 1600  Solving for x:  
x = 1600 / 5  x = 320  So, David and Raymond together make 320 pyjamas."
"Response:  First, we need to find out how much each pack of flowers costs.  We know that the price per stem is $2.50 for three stems and $1 for two stems.  So, if Vincent buys three stems at a time (the ""three-pack"" option), he pays $2.50 x 3 = $7.50 for 9 stems.  If he buys two stems at a time (the ""two-pack"" option), he pays $1 x 2 = $2 for 6 stems.  Now, let's calculate how much it would cost Vincent to buy 18 stems in total:  If he buys them in threes, he would pay $7.50 x 3 = $22.50.  If he buys them in twos, he would pay $2 x 6 = $12.  Therefore, Vincent saves $22.50 - $12 = $10.50 by buying the flowers in threes instead of twos."
Response:  First, we know that John pays $100 for the dog to be groomed.  Second, we know that the ho...
Response:  First, we know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is 24 / 6 = 4 liters each.  So, they received a total of 4 x 2 = 8 liters of water.  Next, we know that a boy received 6 liters of water.  Therefore, the amount of water left over is:  24 - 8 - 6 = 20 liters.
Response:  First, we know that Charlie had 10 tarra initially. Then she bought 21 more at the store, so now she has 10 + 21 = 31 tarra in total. Next, she received 23 birthday gifts, so now she has 31 + 23 = 54 tarra. Finally, she gave 9 tarra to her sister and used 28 for decorating cards, leaving her with 54 - 9 - 28 = 17 tarra. Therefore, there are 17 tarra left with Charlie.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Grace weighs 40 kg more than Alex. So if Alex weighs x kg, Grace will weigh x + 40 kg. Now, we are given that Alex weighs two kilograms less than Grace. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:  x + (x + 40) = (x + 40) + 2  Simplifying the equation, we get:  2x + 40 = x + 42  Solving for x, we get:  x = 20 kg  Therefore, Alex weighs 20 kg and Grace weighs 60 kg (since Grace weighs 40 kg more than Alex).
Response:  First, we know that each rose bush has 3 roses.  Each rose has 8 thorns. So, if we multiply 3 (rose bushes) x 8 (thorns per rose), we get: 3 x 8 = 24 thorns in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the team won eight more games than they lost. So if they lost x games, they won x + 8 games. Since they played 22 games in total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 8) = 22...  Now solve for x to find out how many games they lost.
Response:  First, we know that each shirt has its own pattern and there are no repeats.  Second, we know that she has been going on vacation for 11 years (23-34 = 11).  Finally, we know that each row is made up of different pieces from different vacations. Therefore, if we divide 11 (the number of years) by 4 (the number of pieces in each row), we get approximately 2.75 rows per year. Since there are no fractions of rows, let's round down to 2 rows per year. Now, let's multiply 2 x 11 (years) to get approximately 22 rows in total. So, the correct answer is 22 patterns or peittopaloja.
Response:  First alarm sounds four times today.  Second alarm sounds three times as long as the first one. Third alarm sounds half as long as the second one. So we need to find out how many times the third alarm sounds and add that to the number of times the first two alarms sounded.  We know that the third alarm sounds for half the time of the second alarm, which means it sounds for $\frac{3}{2}$ times as long as the second alarm. Since the second alarm sounds for $3$ times as long as the first alarm, the total number of times the third alarm sounds is:$$\frac{3}{2} \times 3 = 3\frac{1}{2}$$Adding this to the number of times the first two alarms sounded gives us:$$4 + 3\frac{1}{2} = 4 + \frac{9}{2} = 13\frac{1}{2}$$So the hälytys soi $13\frac{1}{2}$ times in total.
Response:  First, we know that Sylvie has been working for the company for five years as of December.  Second, we know that her salary increases by 10% every year. Third, we know that she currently earns $600 per month. Now let's calculate her salary three years from now.  Year 1 (December): $600 x 1.10 = $660 Monthly Salary Year 2 (December): $660 x 1.10 = $728 Monthly Salary Year 3 (December): $728 x 1.10 = $805.60 Monthly Salary So, after three years, Sylvie's monthly salary will be $805.60.
Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harald. So if Marilyn sold x records, Harald sold 10x = 10x(x) = 10xx = 10x(88000) = 880000 records.  Therefore, Harald sold 88000 - 880000 = -79200 records.  This is not possible since negative number of records cannot be sold.  Thus, we can conclude that Harald did not sell any records.
Response:  First, we know that Christina has 16 friends she invited to the party and 4/5 of them will come (or 12). So, the total number of attendees = 12 + 4(16) = 12 + 64 = 76. Now, since each gift bag costs $2, the total amount spent on gift bags = 76 x $2 = $152.
Response:  Firstly, we know that an adult dinosaur eats 10 kg of potato salad and a child eats half of it. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children, how much potato salad will Ted need to buy for everyone? We can start by calculating the total amount of potato salad needed for all the dinosaurs: Total = (20 x 10) + (5 x 0.5) = 200 kg + 2.5 kg = 202.5 kg Now, let's check our answer: Is 202.5 kg enough to feed all the dinosaurs at the picnic? Yes, it is! So, Ted needs to buy 202.5 kg of potato salad for the picnic.
Response:  First, we know that Janilla has three times as many lemurs as Marcialla. So if Marcialla has x lemurs, then Janilla has 3x lemurs.  Next, we know that Marcialla has two more lemurs than Cindy. So if Cindy has y lemurs, then Marcialla has y + 2 lemurs.  Finally, we are told that Cindy has four lemurs.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the information given in the problem:  3x + (y + 2) = 4  To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting y from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 3:  3x + 2 = 4 - y 3x = 4 - y / 3  Now we have solved for x! The value of x is 1, so there are one lemur with Janilla.  However, we also know that Marcialla has two more lemurs than Cindy, which means she has four lemurs in total.  Therefore, the number of lemurs with Marcialla is 4, not 1.  This seems like an inconsistency in the problem statement, but it may be intentional or due to rounding errors.
Response:  First, we know that Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey. So, if Amy is x years old, then Jackson is (x - 5) years old and Corey is (x - 2) years old. Next, we know that James is ten years younger than Corey, so Corey is (x - 2 + 10) years old. Finally, we are told that Jackson is not as old as James. Therefore, we can set up an inequality to represent this information: Jackson < James. Using the ages we have found, we can substitute them into the inequality: (x - 5) < 10 + 2 = x - 3 < 12. Solving for x, we get x = 9. Therefore, Jackson is nine years old.
"Response:  First, we know that Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Lee's time = 38 seconds 

Next, we are told that Gerald improved his diet and increased his speed by 10%. This means that if Gerald ran 400 meters in x seconds before improving his diet, he will now be able to run it in 0.9x seconds (since 10% is equal to 0.1). So, we can set up another equation based on this information:  

Gerald's new time = 0.9x seconds 

Now we need to find out how fast Gerald can run 400 meters after improving his diet. To do this, we can substitute Lee's time into one of the equations:  

Gerald's new time = 0.9(38) = 34.2 seconds 

So, Gerald can run 400 meters in approximately 34.2 seconds after improving his diet."
Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer kaninin than lemmikejä, so if there were 12 more kaninin, they would have the same number of lemmikejä.  Since each dog has two cats, we can say that for every dog, there are two cats.  Therefore, if there are 60 dogs, there are 60 x 2 = 120 cats.  So, in total, there are 120 + 12 = 132 lemmikkejä in the neighborhood.
Response:  We know that two-thirds of the students are girls and two-thirds of the girls are partioalaisia (participate in the scouts). So, if we multiply 2/3 by 150 (the total number of students), we get 100. Therefore, there are 100 girl students who participate in the scouts. Now, let's find out how many girls do not participate in the scouts. To do this, we subtract the number of participants from the total number of girls: 150 - 100 = 50. So, there are 50 girl students who do not participate in the scouts.
Response:  We know that Harry slept for nine hours (9) and his friend James slept for two-thirds of that amount. So we can write an equation to represent this information:  Harry slept for 9 hours = 2/3 x James' sleep time  Now we need to find out how many hours James slept. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:  9 = 2/3 x 3x  Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us:  9 = 6x  Now we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:  x = 9 / 6  x = 1 5  Therefore, James slept for 15 hours.  So Harry slept more than James by 7 hours (9 - 15).
Response:  Firstly, we know that each tomato in the purse has lost half of its volume when cooked. So if there are three tomatoes in the purse, they must have had a total volume of 3 x 50 = 150 grams before being cooked. Since the final weight of the tomato puree is 30 grams, we can set up the equation:  150 - 30 = 2x (where x is the number of tomatoes)  Solving for x gives us:  x = 6  Therefore, Freda used six tomatoes to make her last tomato puree.
Response:  First, we know that there were originally 30 cars on the highway.  Of those, five cars left early to avoid traffic (so they didn't contribute to the first 15 minutes of traffic).  That leaves us with 25 cars.  We also know that some cars passed through during the first 15 minutes, but not all of them.  Specifically, 20 cars passed through during this time period.  So, if 20 cars passed through in the first 15 minutes, and there were originally 25 cars on the highway, then there must have been 5 cars that did not pass through during the first 15 minutes.  These are the cars that remained on the highway for the second 15 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that Maria has 2 large windows in her country house with 40 windows each. That means she already has 2 x 40 = 80 plants. Next, we are told that she received 18 new plants from her favorite greenhouse yesterday. So, the total number of plants Maria has now is 80 + 18 = 98 plants.
"Response:  We know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome answered.  The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, so they pressed it 5 times (20 x 1/4).  The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the second friend, so they pressed it 65 times (5 + 10).  Finally, the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.  So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:  
20 + 5 + 65 + 60 = 155 presses of the doorbell."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so he has 395 - 15 = 380 pages left to read. Secondly, we know that there are 7 days in total, and Solo has 4 days left to finish reading all the pages. So, if we divide the number of pages left to read (380) by the number of days left (4), we get the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day:  380 / 4 = 95 pages per day.
Response:  We know that John drinks three glasses of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), so he drinks a total of 3 x 3 = 9 glasses of water per day. Since he does this every day, he drinks 9 x 7 = 63 glasses of water per week. However, on weekends, he wants to relax and have some fun, so he only drinks one glass of wine with his dinner. Therefore, the number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 63 - 1 = 62 glasses.
Response:  Firstly, we know that it takes 10 minutes for the fog to cover every third of a mile. So if there are 42 miles between the two points inland from the sea, then it will take:  42 miles / 3 = 14 cycles (of covering every third of a mile) To cover all 42 miles. Therefore, it will take: 14 x 10 minutes = 140 minutes or 2 hours and 20 minutes for the fog to cover the entire distance between the two points inland from the sea.
Response:  First, Poppy has 1000 pieces of candy and she puts 250 (4/10) on the table. That means she has 750 left (1000 - 250). Now her mother takes 250 more pieces (3/10), so there are 500 pieces left (750 - 250). Therefore, there are 500 candies left.
Response:  If Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, that means Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies.  So together, they will eat 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.
Response:  First we need to find out the volume of one box.  Volume = length x width x height = 15 x 16 x 16 = 3200 cubic centimeters (cm³).  Now let's calculate the total volume of all three boxes: Total volume = 3200 + 3200 + 3200 = 9600 cm³.
Response:  First, we know that Frankie watched 7 hours of television in total. We also know that she watched 1 hour of her favorite show on Monday and Tuesday, and 30 minutes of another show on Wednesday. That means she watched a total of 2 hours of shows on those days. On Thursday, she finished her homework early and watched 1 hour of TV. Finally, on Friday, she stayed up late and watched 2 hours of TV. So, if we add up all the times she watched TV, we get:  7 hours = 2 hours (Mon-Tue) + 30 minutes (Wed) + 1 hour (Thurs) + 2 hours (Fri)  Now, let's convert the 30 minutes on Wednesday to hours:  30 minutes x 60/45 = 1.5 hours  So, the final equation becomes:  7 hours = 2 hours (Mon-Tue) + 1.5 hours (Wed) + 1 hour (Thurs) + 2 hours (Fri)  Solving for the number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday, we get:  1.5 hours / 30 minutes per episode = 5 episodes  Therefore, Frankie watched 5 30-minute episodes of her favorite show on Wednesday.
Response:  First, we know that Henry made 15 more loaves of bread than he intended to make. So if he had intended to make x loaves, then he actually made x + 15 loaves.  Next, we know that Henry dropped 5 loaves when he was putting them in the fridge. So the total number of loaves Henry has is x + 15 - 5 = x + 10.  Finally, we are told that Henry has 110 loaves of bread altogether. So we can set up the equation:  x + 10 = 110.  Solving for x gives us:  x = 90.  Therefore, Henry leiop 90 loaves of bread last year.
"Response:  First, we know that the local gas station sells gas for $3 per gallon.  If the company offers a discount of $20 per gallon if you buy in bulk, then the cost per gallon would be:  
$3 - $20 = $17 per gallon  So, if someone buys 10 gallons of gas, they will pay:  
$17 x 10 = $170  After the discount, they will receive:  
$20 x 10 = $200  Therefore, they will have $30 left over after purchasing 10 gallons of gas."
"Response:  First, we need to find out how many rolls of each type they have in total.  For Beatrice, she has 2 rolls of 24 and 3 rolls of 14, so her total is:  
2 x 24 + 3 x 14 = 48 + 42 = 90 rolls.  For Marcel, he has 3 rolls of 14, so his total is:  
3 x 14 = 42 rolls.  Now that we know how many rolls they have in total, let's calculate their average number of rolls eaten.  To do this, we add up all the rolls they have and divide by the total number of rolls.  So for Beatrice:  
90 / 90 = 1 (average)  And for Marcel:  
42 / 90 = 0.5 (average)  Therefore, Beatrice eats an average of 1 roll per day, while Marcel eats an average of 0.5 rolls per day."
"Response:  First, we know that the boat traveled for 16 seconds at a speed of 20 feet per second (since it covered 20 feet in 16 seconds). So, the total distance traveled is:  Distance = Speed x Time = 20 ft/sec x 16 sec = 320 feet.  Now, since the boat started with 2 liters of water and lost some amount during the journey, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  Initial Water + Lost Water = Final Water. In other words, the initial water volume plus the amount lost equals the final water volume.  We know that the boat had 2 liters of water initially (given) and lost some amount during the journey (not given explicitly but implied as ""some amount"" since the boat was not full when it reached the shore). Therefore, the equation becomes:  2 L + Lost Water = Final Water. Since the boat reached the shore with 320 feet of water remaining (given), we can substitute this value into the equation:  2 L + Lost Water = 320 ft. Solving for Lost Water, we get: Lost Water = 320 ft - 2 L. Now, we need to find out how much water was left in the boat when it reached the shore. To do so, we can substitute the value of Lost Water back into the original equation:  2 L + Lost Water = Final Water. Substituting 320 ft - 2 L for Lost Water, we get:  2 L + (320 ft - 2 L) = 320 ft. Simplifying and solving for L (the volume of water left in the boat when it reached the shore), we get: L = 160 ft. Therefore, there were 160 feet of water left in the boat when Julia reached the shore."
Response:  We know that there are four teachers and each teacher has two classes per day.  That means there will be a total of eight classes per day (4 x 2 = 8).  Now we need to find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in one day.  Since each class lasts for 50 minutes, there will be 8 x 50 = 400 minutes of teaching time per day.  If the whiteboard needs to be cleaned three times during each class, then it will be cleaned a total of 400 x 3 = 1200 times per day.  So the answer is 1200.
Response:  If Ryan has two flowers on day 1 and each flower grows one new flower per day, then he will have:  2 (initial flowers) + 2 x 1 (new flowers per day) = 4 flowers on day 2.  Similarly, if we continue this pattern of adding one new flower per day for 15 days, Ryan will have:  4 + 4 x 15 = 60 flowers on day 15.  However, since 5 flowers did not grow, we need to subtract that from our total:  60 - 5 = 55 flowers on day 15.
Response:  First, we know that there are six times as many pictures in Jamaica's phone as in Britain's phone. So if Britain has 50 photos, Jamaica has 6 x 50 = 300 photos.  Next, we know that each photo of an animal in Jamaica's phone shows 1800 animals. Therefore, the total number of animals shown in all of Jamaica's photos is 300 x 1800 = 540,000 animals. Finally, since there are only five ankkuvalokuvat (ank pictures) in Jamaica's phone, we can divide the total number of animals by five to find out how many ankkuvalokuvat there are: 540,000 / 5 = 108,000 ankkuvalokuvat.  So there are approximately 108,000 ankkuvalokuvat in Jamaica's eläintarhan ankkuvalokuvissa.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha will get for each type of wood she sells. For the 2x4x10 boards, she will get $10 per board, so in total, she will get $10 x 10 = $100. For the 4x4x10 boards, she paid $16 per board, so if she sells them all, she will get $16 x 5 = $80. In total, Sasha will get $100 + $80 = $180.
Response:  First, we know that Katy used 120 teelusikallista sokeria and kupillisia vettä in total.  We also know that she used them in a ratio of 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of tea leaves, she used 13 parts of water.  So if we want to find out how many teaspoons of tea leaves Katy used, we can start with the number of parts of water she used.  There are 8 fluid ounces in a cup, so 13 cups of water is equal to 13 x 8 = 104 fluid ounces.  Now, we need to convert this amount from fluid ounces to teaspoons.  One teaspoon is equal to 6 grams, so 104 fluid ounces is equal to 104 / 6 = 17.33 teaspoons.  Since Katy used 120 teelusikallista sokeria and kupillisia vettä in total, we can subtract the number of teaspoons of water she used (17.33) from 120 to find out how many teaspoons of tea leaves she used.  Therefore, the answer is:  120 - 17.33 = 102.67 teaspoons.
Response:  First, we know that John has three children and each child needs two pairs of shoes. So he buys six pairs of shoes in total. Secondly, we are told that each pair costs $60. Therefore, to calculate how much John paid in total, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair: 6 pairs x $60/pair = $360. 
Response:  We know that there were 2 containers brought in on the first day, and each container had 5 vehicles. So, on the first day, there were 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles brought in. On the second day, we are told that there were additional containers brought in, but we don't know how many. However, we do know that there were a total of 30 vehicles at the end of the second day. So, if we subtract the number of vehicles brought in on the first day (10) from the total number of vehicles at the end of the second day (30), we can find out how many vehicles were brought in on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles were brought in on the second day.
Response:  First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lyla's four years ago. So if Lyla earned $x dollars per year, Adrien earned $x x 1.3 = $x + 30%.  Now, we are told that Adrien's current salary is 40% more than his salary four years ago. So if Adrien earned $x + 30% four years ago, his current salary would be $(x + 30%) x 1.4 = (x + 30) + 40%.  Since Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, we can set up an equation based on this information:  (x + 30) + 40% of $40,000 = $40,000.  Solving for x, we get:  x = $28,000.  Therefore, Lyla earns $28,000 and Adrien earns $28,000 x 1.3 = $36,400.
Response:  If Miguel uses two papers per week for his drawings and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he uses 8 papers per month (2 x 4 = 8). Since there are 30 papers in a pack, Miguel uses 30/8 = 375% of a pack each month.
Response:  First, we know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, let's add up how many fruits she brought in total: 5 + 8 = 13. Now, we know that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, so he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Additionally, Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette, so he brought 1/2 x 8 = 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael is: 13 (Morisette) + 10 (Kael) + 4 (Kael) = 27.
Response:  First, we know that Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday.  Next, we know that she slept for 2 hours less each day than the previous day. So, on Tuesday, she slept for 8 - 2 = 6 hours, and on Wednesday, she slept for 6 - 2 = 4 hours.  Now, let's find out how many hours Sadie slept in total for the whole week. We can do this by adding up all the hours she slept each day:  8 + 6 + 4 +... + 2 =?  Can you fill in the missing numbers to complete the sum?
"Response:  First we need to calculate how far Rosie can run in 3 hours at 10 miles per hour.  Then we will use that information to find out how far she can run in 7 hours.  Here is the calculation for the first part of the problem:  
Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour, so she covers:  
10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles  
Now let's calculate how far Rosie can run in 7 hours:  
She has already run 30 miles in 3 hours, so she has:  
30 miles - 30 miles = 0 miles left to run  
Therefore, Rosie can run 0 miles in 7 hours."
Response: 1) Jennie has 60 stamps and she needs 3 stamps for each letter. So, if she has 30 letters now, how many more letters can she send?  2) If she has 30 letters now and she puts three stamps on each letter, then she has used 90 stamps (3 x 30). So, how many stamps does she have left?  3) Jennie started with 60 stamps, so if she has 90 stamps left, that means she had 60 - 90 = 30 stamps left at first. Therefore, there were 30 letters in the pile when Jennie started.
Response:  Firstly, Julia bought three new packs of lusikka (3 x 5 = 15). Then her husband bought five more packs for her (5 x 5 = 25), so in total, Julia had 15 + 25 = 40 lusikka.
"Response:  We know that Dylan bought more chicken sausages than pork sausages. So let's start with the number of chicken sausages he bought. The problem states that he bought 38 chicken sausages. Now, we need to find out how many pork sausages he bought if he bought more pork sausages than chicken sausages. The problem tells us that he bought 6 more pork sausages than chicken sausages. This means that if he bought x chicken sausages, he bought x + 6 pork sausages. Since there are 6 more pork sausages than chicken sausages, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x + (x + 6) = 38 + 6   
2x + 6 = 44   
2x = 38   
x = 19   
So, Dylan bought 19 chicken sausages and 19 + 6 = 25 pork sausages."
Response:  First, we know that Amy has 20 more friends than Lily. So if Lily has x friends, Amy will have x + 20 friends.  Now, we are told that Lily has 50 friends. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + (x + 20) = 50  Simplifying the equation:  2x + 20 = 50  Subtracting 20 from both sides:   2x = 30  Dividing both sides by 2:    x = 15  Therefore, Lily has 15 friends and Amy has 15 + 20 = 35 friends.  In total, there are 15 + 35 = 50 friends.
Response:  First, we know that oranges cost $5 less than watermelons, so oranges cost $5 x 3 = $15 per unit. Paprika costs $15 per unit. Apples cost $15 x 2 = $30 per unit. Now let's calculate the total cost of each fruit: Watermelon: $15 x 4 = $60 Orange: $15 x 10 = $150 Paprika: $15 x 20 = $300 Apple: $30 x 10 = $300 Total Cost: $60 + $150 + $300 + $300 = $910
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time each doctor spends with each patient per day. We know that there are 500 patients and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes per day. Therefore, the total time spent by doctors per day = Number of patients x Average time per patient Total number of doctors x Hours worked per day So, the total time spent by doctors per day = 500 x 24 x 8 (hours) / 3 (doctors) = 9600 hours/day Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these visits. We know that the fee charged by the doctors is $150 per hour and the fee charged by the hospital from the patients is $200 per hour. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the hospital per day = Total time spent by doctors per day x Fee charged by doctors per hour + Total time spent by patients per day x Fee charged by hospital per hour So, the total revenue generated by the hospital per day = 9600 x $150 + 500 x $200 = $1,440,000 + $1,000,000 = $2,440,000 per day.
"Response:  First, 60 elves work for Nissa in her toy store.  If one-third of the elves quit when children cry on their heads, then 20 elves (60 x 1/3) will leave.  Next, if 10 more elves quit when the children kick them, then there will be 50 elves left (60 - 10).  So, finally, there are 50 elves remaining or ""tonto"" as you asked."
Response:  First, we know that in May (the third month), Joseph had $500.  In June (the fourth month), he had $440 ($500 - $60). So, he spent $60 in June.
Response:  First, Pam and Fred went to the amusement park twice (Pam) and four times (Fred), so they rode the roller coaster a total of:  2 x 6 = 12 times.  Then, they rode the log flume twice on the back of a truck, so they used:  2 x 6 = 12 tickets for that ride as well.  Therefore, in total, they used:  12 + 12 = 24 tickets.
Response:  First, we know that Walt walked six kilometers on Monday. That means he walked 6 x 1.6093 = 9.65 miles (since there are 1.6093 miles in a kilometer).  On Tuesday, he walked six times as many miles as he did on Monday. So he walked 6 x 9.65 = 57.9 miles.  Therefore, Walt walked 57.9 miles on Tuesday.
Response:  If Tom goes to the laundry four times a month and each wash costs $15, how much does he spend per year?  To find out, we need to multiply the number of times he goes to the laundry per month by the cost of one wash.  So, if he goes to the laundry 4 times per month, that's 4 x $15 = $60 per month.  Now, let's multiply that by 12 months in a year: $60 x 12 = $720 per year.  Therefore, Tom spends $720 per year on laundry.
Response:  If Brian has 20 video games and lost five just before the comparison, then he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left.  Since Brian has five times fewer games than Bobby, Bobby has 5 x 15 = 75 video games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 one-horned animals in the world and two-thirds of them are found in Scotland's uplands. Secondly, we know that two-thirds of the Scottish one-horned animals are females. So, to find out how many females are in Scotland's one-horned population, we can multiply the total number of Scottish one-horned animals by two-thirds.  Multiplying 2/3 by 27 gives us:  27 x 2/3 = 18 Therefore, there are 18 females in Scotland's one-horned population.
Response:  First calculate the total cost of the items without shipping:  7.5 x 2 = 15 + 1.5 x 2 = 3 + 1.0 x 2 = 2 = 18.50 dollars. Next, calculate the shipping cost based on 20% of the total cost: 18.50 x 0.20 = 3.70 dollars. Now add the shipping cost and the tip to get the final total: 18.50 + 3.70 + 5.00 = 27.20 dollars. So Rory's order will cost 27.20 dollars including shipping and the tip.
Response:  First, we know that Mark took 5 hours to complete 75 questions, so his speed is: 75 / 5 = 15 questions per hour.  Now, let's calculate how many questions he could have completed in 8 hours (the time it took him to finish the first test):  8 hours x 15 questions/hour = 120 questions.  Since there were 100 questions in the second test, Mark left 100 - 120 = 80 questions unanswered.
"Response:  We know that there are 22 pink balls in total and four times as many pink balls as blue ones. So if we have x blue balls, we will have 4x pink balls. Now we know that there are 12 blue balls (given), so we can set up an equation:  
x + 12 = 4x  Simplifying this equation, we get:  
3x = 20  Solving for x, we find that there are 6 blue balls. Therefore, there are 6 x 4 = 24 pink balls."
Response:  We know that there are 20 vehicles in total, and we have been given their distribution as follows:  Automatic: 12 (60%) Manual: 4 (20%) Semi-automatic:? (20% - 60% = 40%) Since we want to find out how many of the vehicles are semi-automatic, we can use the information provided to calculate it.  So, the number of semi-automatic vehicles is: 40% of 20 = 8 Therefore, there are 8 semi-automatic vehicles among the 20 vehicles.
Response:  First, we know that there are 2 times more worker bees than queen bees. So if there are x queen bees, then there are 2x worker bees.  Next, we know that each worker bee lays twice as many eggs as the queen bee. So if there are y eggs in total, then the queen bees lay z eggs (z = y/2), and the worker bees lay w eggs (w = 2y - z).  Now we can set up an equation based on these relationships:  2x + 2(y - z) = 700  Simplifying this equation, we get:  2x + 2y - 2z = 700  Solving for x, we get:  x = 350  Therefore, there are 350 queen bees.  And since each queen bee lays z eggs, there are:  z = 350 \* 2 = 700 eggs laid by the queen bees.  Finally, we can calculate the number of worker bees using the fact that there are 2 times more worker bees than queen bees: 2(350) = 700 worker bees.  So there are 700 worker bees and 350 queen bees in the hive.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games per week.  He plays for two hours per day, so he spends 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week playing video games.  Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan earns from his part-time job.  He earns $10 per hour, so if he works for 10 hours per week (2 hours/day x 5 days/week), he earns $10 x 10 = $100 per week.  Now, let's add up Jordan's total weekly income from both sources:  Video games: 14 hours/week x $0/hour = $0 Total income from part-time job: $100/week Therefore, Jordan's total weekly income is $100.
Response:  First, we know that all items except food are subject to a 10% tax.  So, if John buys $2 worth of food, he will pay $2 x 1.10 = $2.20 for it.  If he buys $3 worth of milk, he will pay $3 x 1.10 = $3.30 for it.  Similarly, if he buys $3 worth of lamps, he will pay $3 x 1.10 = $3.30 for them.  And so on.  Now, let's add up all these amounts: Food: $2.20 Milk: $3.30 Lamp...
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lucas earns from each customer.  For each customer, he needs two bottles of cleaning solution and one pack of sponges, which cost $2 and $5 respectively. So, the total amount earned from each customer is:  
$2 + $5 = $7  
Since there are three customers now, Lucas has earned:  
$7 x 3 = $21  
Now, let's consider the potential five more customers that Lucas believes will become his clients. Each of them will also require two bottles of cleaning solution and one pack of sponges, so the total amount earned from these five customers would be:  
$2 x 5 = $10  
$10 + $21 = $31  
Therefore, Lucas's weekly income is:  
$31 x 5 (number of weeks in a month) = $155  
Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total revenue:  
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses  
In this case, the total expenses include only the cost of raw materials ($2 + $5 = $7), so the profit would be:  
Profit = $155 - $7 = $148  
So, Lucas makes $148 in profit every week."
Response:  First, we know that John has 10 hectares of land for ananas cultivation.  One hectare contains 100 ananas plants, so John has 10 x 100 = 1000 ananas plants in total.  Next, we are told that John can harvest his ananas every three months. This means he has four harvests per year (3 months x 4 times = 12 months).  Now, let's calculate how many ananas John can harvest each time he harvests. Since he has 1000 plants and can harvest them every three months, he will harvest 1000 / 3 = 333 ananas each time.  Therefore, John can harvest a total of 333 x 4 = 1332 ananas per year.
Response:  First, we know that Johnny has collected 500 Lego pieces from the floor.  Next, we are told that there is another box with three times as many pieces as 500, and one more box with a fourth of the total number of pieces.  So let's start by finding out how many pieces are in each of these boxes.  We can do this by using multiplication and division.  Here's what we know:  * The second box has three times as many pieces as 500, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.  * The third box has a fourth of the total number of pieces, so it has (4/4) x 1500 = 625 pieces.  Now that we have found out how many pieces are in each box, we need to add them up to find out how many pieces Johnny will collect in total.  This gives us:  500 + 1500 + 625 = 2625 pieces.  Therefore, Johnny will collect 2625 Lego pieces if he gathers all of the pieces on the floor.
Response:  First, we know that 30 bees left the nest in the first six hours. That means there were 30/2 = 15 bees outside the nest at any given time during those six hours.  Next, we know that half of them returned to the nest within the next six hours. So, if there were 15 bees outside, then half of them is 7.5 (since 7.5 x 2 = 15).  Now, we need to find out how many of these returning bees came back during the last six hours. We can do this by subtracting the number of bees that left the nest from the total number of bees that returned. In other words, we can subtract 7.5 from 15 to get the number of bees that returned during the last six hours:  15 - 7.5 = 7.5  Therefore, Debra saw 7.5 bees return to the nest during the last six hours.
Response:  First, we know that the adult ticket costs $12 and the child ticket costs $10.  So if Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8 in change, that means she paid for one adult ticket ($12) and one child ticket ($10).  Therefore, the total amount of money Brittany's mother gave to the cashier is:   Adult ticket: $12 Child ticket: $10 Total: $22  Now let's check our calculation:  $12 + $10 = $22 Yes, that's correct!  So Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8 in change.
Response:  We know that Charliella has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. So if Charliella has 12 friends, then Dorothy has 12 x 3 = 36 friends.  Now we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So James has 36 x 4 = 144 friends.
"Response:  First we need to find out how long it takes for Steve to get home from school. We know that he can drive his bike at 440 feet per minute. So if he has to travel three miles (which is equal to 5,280 feet), it will take him:  
Time = Distance / Speed Time = 5,280 ft / 440 ft/min Time = 12 minutes Now we need to find out how long it takes for Tim to get home from school. We know that he can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. So if he has to travel three kilometers (which is equal to 3,000 meters or 9,842 feet), it will take him:  
Time = Distance / Speed Time = 9,842 ft / 264 ft/min Time = 37 minutes Since Steve gets home earlier than Tim, the winner will have to wait for Tim to arrive before they can start their activity together. Therefore, the time difference between them is:  
Waiting time = Time of slower person - Time of faster person Waiting time = 37 min - 12 min Waiting time = 25 minutes So the winner will have to wait for 25 minutes before they can start their activity together."
Response:  First, we know that five people came to use the bike stand and filled both tires. That means they paid $25 x 2 = $50 for the day.  Next, three more people came and also filled both tires, so they paid the same amount, $50. Finally, one person came with a unicycle, but since there is no tire to fill, they didn't pay anything.  So, in total, Shawnda earned $50 + $50 + $0 = $100 on her first day of business.
Response:  First, we know that Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies. So, in total, Carl buys 10 x 6 = 60 cookies.  Next, we know that each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for all the cookies is 60 x $0.10 = $6.00.  Finally, since Carl pays with $10 dollar bills, he will receive $6.00 in change ($10 - $6.00).
Response:  First, Dave had 14 French fries in his bag. Then, a hungry sea gull stole half of them (7). Next, three crows forced Dave to leave the table (3 x 2 = 6), and each crow ate three French fries (6 x 3 = 18). After that, a beaver stole two thirds of what was left (18 / 3 = 6). Finally, ants took the last one (6 - 1 = 5). So, there were originally 14 French fries in Dave's bag.
Response:  First, we know that there are 16 weeks in one school year (lukukausi). Next, we need to calculate how many days there are in each week. Since Kimo has three two-hour lessons per day, Monday through Friday (maanantain, keskiviikkoisin, perjantaisin), he has a total of 3 x 5 = 15 days per week. Therefore, the number of days in one school year is:  16 weeks x 15 days/week = 240 days. Now let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class during the school year: 240 days x 2 hours/day = 480 hours. So, Kimo spends 480 hours in class during one school year.
Response:  First we need to calculate how many meters of each product are produced per day:  * Leivät: 300 x 15 cm = 4500 cm (or 4.5 m) per day  * Croissants: 120 x 15 cm = 1800 cm (or 1.8 m) per day  * Baguettes: 60 x 60 cm = 3600 cm (or 3.6 m) per day Now let's convert all values to hours:  * Leivät: 4.5 m / 30 cm/h = 15 h/day  * Croissants: 1.8 m / 30 cm/h = 6 h/day  * Baguettes: 3.6 m / 30 cm/h = 12 h/day So, in total, Bill produces 15 + 6 + 12 = 33 h of leavened products per day.
Response:  First we need to calculate how many bananas each species needs per month:  Gorillas need 400 bananas/month Paviaans need 100 bananas/month So, in total, the animals need 500 bananas/month (400 + 100) Now, let's calculate how many months of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for two months:  To cover 2 months, we need to multiply the number of bananas needed per month by 2:  Total bananas needed for 2 months = 500 x 2 = 1000 bananas Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1000 bananas for two months.
Response:  First, we know that Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance he covers is:  15 x (100 m + 100 m) = 1500 m  Now, let's calculate how far Kelly goes. She runs 40 yards each way, for a total of:  2 x 40 yd = 80 yd  However, she does this 34 times, so her total distance is:   80 yd x 34 = 2720 yd  Since Kelly runs further than Blake, the correct answer is:  2720 yd > 1500 m
Response:  First, we know that Raphael spent $1.5 x 4 = $6 on kynää (four pencils).  Next, we know he spent $4 x 2 = $8 on muistikirjat (two notebooks).  Finally, we know he spent $20 on paperin reunan (one ream of paper).  So in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  First, we know that Finn sees six fish swimming in the water. Next, he sees two more hiding under a rock. So, if we add 6 + 2 = 8, then we can conclude that Finn sees eight fish in total in the lake.
Response:  First, we know that on Tuesday (tiista), there was two meters more water in the container than on Monday (maanantai). So, if the water level on Monday was x meters deep, then the water level on Tuesday was x + 2 meters deep. Next, we are told that on Wednesday (keskiviikko), the water level is two-thirds of the water level on Tuesday. Therefore, the water level on Wednesday can be found as follows: Water level on Wednesday = x + 2 \* (2/3) = x + 2 \* 2/3 = x + 4/3 meters deep. Finally, we want to find out how deep the water is on Wednesday. To do this, we need to subtract the initial depth from the final depth: Depth on Wednesday = x + 4/3 - x = 4/3 meters deeper than it was on Monday. The answer is 4/3 meters deeper on Wednesday than it was on Monday.
Response:  First, we know that Anakin got 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish in total.  Now, we are told that Locsin got fewer than Anakin in each category. So, she got 5 less than Anakin in meritähteä, which is 19 - 5 = 14. In merikonkia, she got 3 less than Anakin, which is 14 - 3 = 11. And in klovninkalaa, she got 2 more than Anakin, which is 11 + 2 = 13. Therefore, Locsin caught 14 + 11 + 13 = 38 fish in total.
Response:  First, we know that the original price of the marble is $20.  If it increases by 20% every month, then after one month, the new price will be:  $20 x 1.2 = $24 Next, if the price increases by another 20% after the next month, the new price will be: $24 x 1.2 = $28.80 So, after 36 months (or 3 years), the price of the marble will be: $28.80 x 1.2 = $34.57 Therefore, the total cost of the marble over 36 months will be $34.57.
Response:  First, we know that the price of each action figure is $3, so if there are 3 action figures in total, their combined cost would be $3 x 3 = $9.  Next, we know that the red car costs $4 per unit, and there are 5 red cars in total, so their combined cost would be $4 x 5 = $20.  Finally, we know that the remaining amount of money to spend is $5 - ($9 + $20) = $5 - $29 = $6.  Therefore, the value of all the toys together is $9 (action figures) + $20 (red cars) = $29, which leaves $6 left over after buying all the toys with the $5 budget.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Jackie would save if she pays someone else to do her taxes instead of doing them herself.  If she does them herself, she needs to spend 3 hours and 35 dollars per hour, so in total, she spends 105 dollars (3 x 35).  But if she hires someone else to do them, she only needs to pay 90 dollars.  So, the difference is 15 dollars (105 - 90).  Now, let's check if this amount is worth the time she saves.  She can save 3 hours by not doing the taxes herself, which means she gains 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes or 3 hours.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she gains 60 x 3 = 180 minutes or 3 hours.  So, the value of the time she saves is 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes or 3 hours.  Now, let's compare the cost with the value of the time she saves:  15 dollars / 3 hours = 5 dollars per hour saved.  This means that for every hour she saves, she gains 5 dollars.  Therefore, if she has more than 5 dollars per hour saved, it makes sense for her to hire someone else to do her taxes.  Otherwise, it doesn't make economic sense to pay someone else to do something she could do herself at no additional cost.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Elvira spent on the computer and its accessories.  The cost of the computer is 1090 euros, plus she bought a scanner for 157 euros, a CD-levahtan for 74 euros, and a printer for 102 euros. So in total, she spent:  
1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 euros.  Now let's check if she has enough money left over for clothes. She received 1500 euros as a gift from her family, and she spent 1423 euros on the computer and its accessories. That means she has:  
1500 - 1423 = 177 euros left over for clothes."
Response:  First, we know that Sandra needs three eggs to make one Spanish flan.  Second, she has nine eggs every time she watches her daughter.  Third, she needs to make 15 Spanish flans for the school fundraiser.  So, how many times will Sandra have to watch her daughter?  To find out, we can divide the number of flans she needs to make (15) by the number of eggs she needs per flan (3):  15 / 3 = 5  Therefore, Sandra will have to watch her daughter five times to collect enough eggs to make all 15 Spanish flans for the school fundraiser.
Response:  We know that Brooke is two years younger than Seth, so if Brooke is x years old, then Seth is x + 2 years old.  Since both are 28 years old together, we can set up the equation:  x + (x + 2) = 28.  Simplifying this equation, we get:  2x + 2 = 28.  Solving for x, we find that Seth is 14 years old.
Response:  If Ethel has $8, then she has 8 dollars.  Now, we know that Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel, so we can add 2 to 8 to find out how much Jimmy has:  8 + 2 = 10  Therefore, Jimmy has $10.
Response:  First, we know that Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day, except for weekends. So, during the weekdays, he walks 30 km x 5 = 150 km per week. On weekends, he walks 10 miles (since each mile is equal to 1.60934 kilometers) x 2 = 20 miles per weekend. Therefore, in total, Pancho walks 150 km + 20 miles = 170 miles per week.
Response:  First, we know that each hat costs $25. Second, we know that the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs $25 x 3 = $75. Finally, we know that the pants cost the same amount as the hat and the jacket combined, so the pants cost $25 + $75 = $100. Therefore, each complete uniform (hat, jacket, and pants) costs $100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake sees 80 eight-legged spiders and 90 six-legged insects in total. Secondly, he sees three rare, ten-legged creatures. Therefore, to calculate the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to add up the number of legs from all these groups: 80 x 8 = 640 (for the spiders) + 90 x 6 = 540 (for the insects) + 3 x 10 = 30 (for the rare creatures). Finally, we add up all these numbers to get our total: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210. So, Jake sees a total of 1210 legs.
Response:  First, we know that Sally Four is three years older than her mother, so if Sally Four is x years old, then her mother (Sally Three) is x - 3 years old.  Next, we know that Red is twice as old as Sally Three, so if Red is y years old, then Sally Three is y / 2 years old.  Finally, we know that Sally Ninety-eight is eight years older than Sally Eighty-four, so if Sally Ninety-eight is z years old, then Sally Eighty-four is z - 8 years old.  Now we can set up an equation based on these relationships:  Sally Four = x + 3  Sally Three = x - 3  Red = 2(x - 3) = 2x - 6  Sally Ninety-eight = z + 8  Sally Eighty-four = z - 8  We have five equations and four unknowns (x, y, z, and the sum of their ages). Can you solve for them?
Response:  First we need to calculate how much Jessica pays each month for her student loans, credit card debt and mortgage.  Student Loan Debt: $300/month Credit Card Debt: $200/month Mortgage Debt: $500/month Total Monthly Payments: $1,000 Now let's calculate how much Jessica will pay annually if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment. For the student loan debt, she will pay 50% of $300, which is $150 per month or $1800 per year (150 x 12). For the credit card debt, she will pay 50% of $200, which is $100 per month or $1200 per year (100 x 12). And for the mortgage debt, she will pay 50% of $500, which is $250 per month or $3000 per year (250 x 12). Therefore, Jessica will pay a total of $6,000 per year in extra payments.
Response: 1) Kuoriutumisesta kestää 30 perunaa x 0.5 min = 15 minutes (since there are 30 perunas and each takes half a minute to peel). 2) Leikkaus kestää 30 perunaa x 5 seconds = 150 seconds (since there are 30 perunas and each takes 5 seconds to chop). So in total, it will take Billy 15 + 150 = 165 minutes to prepare all the potatoes.
"Response:  First, we know that they sold 20 gallons of lemonade and made $25 in profit.  Second, we know that each gallon cost $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.  Third, we know that they sold each glass for 50 cents, so total revenue from sales is 20 x 50 cents = $10.  Fourth, we want to find out how much they spent on lemons. Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue must have been at least $25. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:  
$10 (revenue from sales) + $5 (cost per gallon) = $25 (profit)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  
$10 + $5 = $25  Solving for x, we get:  
$15 = $25  So, they spent $15 on lemons."
Response:  We know that there were 240 participants in total and 80 of them were Japanese.  That means there are 160 non-Japanese participants (240 - 80 = 160).  Of those 160, we know that 60 were Chinese boys.  So, if there were 60 boys in the Chinese team, how many girls were there in the Chinese team?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of non-Japanese participants.  In other words, we can use the following equation: Girls + Boys = Total Non-Japanese Participants.  Substituting the values we know, we get: Girls = 160 - 60 = 100.  Therefore, there were 100 girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  First, we know that Zaid spends one fourth of his salary on rent, which is $1500 (1/4 x $6000). Next, he spends one third of his salary on car expenses, which is $2000 (1/3 x $6000). So far, he has spent $3500. Now, let's look at what he gives to his family. He gives his daughter $200 per week, which is $800 per month ($200 x 4 weeks). He also gives his wife $700 per month for food and other household expenses. In total, he gives $1500 per month to his family. Therefore, after deducting all these amounts from his salary, Zaid has $6000 - $3500 - $1500 = $1000 left for himself each month.
Response:  First, we know that Rani has 10 crabs more than Monica, so Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Rani.  That means Monica has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.  Now, let's find out how many crabs Bolla has.  We know that Bolla has 40 crabs in total, and each of them is worth 3 units.  So, the total value of all the crabs is:  40 x 3 = 120 units.  Since Monica has 36 crabs, her share of the total value would be:  36 / 120 x 120 = 9 units.  Finally, to find the sum of the first three numbers (Rani, Monica, and Bolla), we add their values:  120 + 9 + 36 = 165 units.
Response:  First, we know that Lloyd taught for five hours during the first week and eight hours during the second week.  So, his total teaching time for both weeks is:  5 + 8 = 13 hours  Next, we know that he charged $10 per hour.  So, his total earnings for both weeks are:  13 x $10 = $130  Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 in two weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the winner received 3/4 of the votes, which means they got 3/4 x 80 = 240 votes. Now, we need to find out how many votes the loser got. We can do this by subtracting the winner's votes from the total number of votes cast (80). So, the loser got 80 - 240 = 60 votes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white lilies. So if she ordered x white lilies, she ordered 4x red roses. We also know that she ordered 200 light purple calla lilies, which is five times more than white lilies. Therefore, the number of light purple calla lilies she ordered is 5x + 200 = 1000. Now, let's calculate how many red roses and white lilies were ordered in total. Total number of red roses = 4x + 200 = 800 Total number of white lilies = x + 200 = 300 To find out how many red roses Sandra needs to receive today, we need to divide the total number of red roses by the number of days since her last delivery (which was yesterday). The number of days since her last delivery is one day, so: Number of red roses needed today = 800 / 1 = 800 Today, Sandra should receive 800 red roses. To find out how many white lilies she should receive today, we can use the same calculation as above: Number of white lilies needed today = 300 / 1 = 300 Therefore, Sandra should receive 300 white lilies today.
Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was five years older than Jan. So if Jan is currently 30 years old, then two years ago, Jan would have been 28 years old.  And we also know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, two years ago, Jean would have been 28 + 2 = 30 years old.  Since Jan and Jean are both 30 years old now, we can conclude that Jean is also 30 years old.
Response:  First we need to calculate how long it takes for each member of the faster team to run their respective distances. We know that the first runner runs at a speed of 60 seconds per 400 meters, so they will cover their distance in:  60 sec / 400 m = 0.15 sec/m  The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first runner, so they will cover their distance in:  60 + 3 = 63 sec / 400 m = 0.1575 sec/m  The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they will cover their distance in:  63 + 3 = 66 sec / 400 m = 0.165 sec/m  And finally, the fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they will cover their distance in:  66 + 3 = 69 sec / 400 m = 0.1725 sec/m Now let's calculate the total time it takes for both teams to complete their laps:  Faster team:  0.15 sec/m x 400 m = 60 sec  Slower team:  0.1725 sec/m x 400 m = 69.06 sec (to two decimal places) Since the slower team takes longer to complete their lap, the faster team wins by: 69.06 - 60 = 9.06 seconds
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the probability of Jerry throwing an odd number.  Since there are three odd numbers (1, 3, and 5) out of six possible outcomes, the probability of throwing an odd number is:  P(odd) = 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.   Next, we need to calculate the probability of Jerry throwing two consecutive even numbers (2 and 4). There are four even numbers in total (2, 4, 6, and 8), so the probability of throwing two consecutive even numbers is:  P(even-even) = 4/6 = 0.67 or 67%.   Now that we have calculated the probabilities of both events, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief about which event is more likely based on the information we have. We will use the following formula:  P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)   where A represents ""Jerry throws an odd number"" and B represents ""Jerry throws two consecutive even numbers"".   Plugging in the values we obtained earlier, we get:  P(odd|even-even) = (0.5 \* 0.67) / (0.67) = 0.39 or 39%   So, according to Bayes' theorem, it is more likely (39%) that Jerry will throw an odd number than that he will throw two consecutive even numbers (61%)."
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together got 20 apples, then Jenna must have picked half of that amount, which is 10 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 160 olkia in total and they have to be distributed among all the animals in the pet store. Secondly, we know that each rat gets six olkia, so if we divide 160 by six, we get... (do you want me to continue?)
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much interest will be accrued over three months at a rate of 2%. Then, we can add that amount to the original $100 loan to find out how much Mandy needs to pay back to Benedict.  Calculation for interest: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time Interest = $100 x 2% x 3/12 = $6.67 So, in total, Mandy needs to pay back $100 + $6.67 = $106.67 to Benedict.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each sack costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse. So if Kauppias sold all the sacks for $30 each, he would have made a profit of $400 (since there are 100 sacks x $30 per sack = $3000). Now let's calculate how many sacks he had to sell to make this profit: Profit = $400; Cost per sack = $2; Number of sacks =? We can set up an equation based on these values: Number of sacks x Cost per sack = Profit To solve for the number of sacks, we can divide both sides of the equation by the cost per sack: Number of sacks = Profit / Cost per sack Number of sacks = $400 / $2 Number of sacks = 200 sacks Therefore, Kauppias had to sell 200 sacks to make a profit of $400."
"Response:  First, we know that three friends paid $20.25 for three tickets to a show. We can start by writing an equation based on this information:  
Ticket price = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75 per ticket  Next, we know that they spent less money on food than they did on tickets. So let's say they spent $4.50 less on food than they did on tickets. We can write another equation based on this information:  
Food cost = Ticket price - $4.50 = $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25 per person  Now, we know that two of the friends went on a horseback ride that cost $33. So, we can add that amount to their total cost:  
Total cost = Food cost + Horseback ride cost = $2.25 + $33 = $35.25 per person  Finally, since there are three friends, we can divide the total cost by three to find out how much each friend paid:  
Each friend paid = Total cost / Number of friends = $35.25 / 3 = $11.75 per person"
"Response:  We know that John collects strawberries for three hours and gathers two strawberries per minute. To find out how many strawberries he collects in total, we need to multiply the number of minutes he spends collecting strawberries by the number of strawberries he gathers per minute. So, if John collects strawberries for 3 hours (which is equal to 180 minutes), and he gathers 2 strawberries per minute, then he will gather a total of:  
180 minutes x 2 strawberries/minute = 360 strawberries  
Therefore, John collects 360 strawberries during his three-hour strawberry-picking session."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each ankan needs to consume approximately 1.5 kg of insects per week to survive. Secondly, there are ten ankans in total in the flock. Therefore, the total amount of insects consumed by the flock per week is:  10 x 1.5 kg = 15 kg  So, the flock of ten ankas requires 15 kg of insects per week to survive.
Response:  First, we know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down two trees per year. So, if he starts with 50 trees, how many trees will he have after one year?  After one year, he will have 50 - 2 = 48 trees.  Now, let's consider the effect of the 30% mortality rate over 10 years.  If 30% of the trees die each year, then after 10 years, 30% of 48 trees will die, which is 48 x 0.3 = 14.4 trees (round up to 15).  Therefore, Tom will have 48 - 15 = 33 trees left after 10 years.
Response:  First, we know that there were initially 18 vaaleanpunaista (pink) flamingos placed on Sue's front yard. Then, on Saturday morning, 3/4 of these pink flamingos were taken back by the neighbors. This means that 3/4 x 18 = 13 pink flamingos were returned to the neighbors. So, on Sunday morning, there would be 18 - 13 = 5 pink flamingos left outside Sue's house.  Next, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white ones. We know that the neighbors added 18 new pink flamingos on Sunday morning. So, if there were already 5 pink flamingos left outside Sue's house, then there would be a total of 5 + 18 = 23 pink flamingos outside Sue's house. However, we also know that there were only 12 white flamingos added to the collection on Sunday morning. Therefore, the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is: 23 - 12 = 11.  So, on Sunday afternoon, there were 11 more pink flamingos outside Sue's house than white flamingos.
Response:  First, we know that one kynä (pen) costs two dollars. So if Violetta wants to buy five pens, she will have to pay five times two dollars, which is ten dollars.  Now, she has twenty dollars and she spent ten dollars on pens, so she has twelve dollars left.  Therefore, her vaihtoraha (change) is twelve dollars.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much 8 pyyhkiä would cost. We know that one pyyhki costs $0.30, so 8 pyyhkiä would cost $0.30 x 8 = $2.40. Now we can add the cost of the kyniä to this amount: $2.40 + $1.20 (for 8 kyniä) = $3.60. So, 8 kynää and 8 pyyhkiä would cost a total of $3.60.
Response:  First, we know that there are 200 kilograms of porkkanos available and they need to be distributed among 40 restaurants. Second, each restaurant receives half a kilogram of porkkanos. So, if we divide 200 kilograms by 40, we get...  Yes! The correct answer is 5 kilograms (or 5,000 grams) of porkkanos will not be used.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 23786 people in total in Soda.  Next, we know that 8417 of them are men and 9092 are women. Finally, we know that ""the rest"" (whatever is left over) are children. So, to find out how many children there are, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. Here's the calculation: Total Population = Men + Women + Children Total Population = 8417 + 9092 + Children Children = Total Population - (Men + Women) Children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092) Children = 23786 - 17509 Children = 6277 There are 6277 children in Soda."
Response:  First month, she had 20 cards and collected three times that amount, so she had 60 cards in total.  Second month, she had 60 cards and collected 20 fewer than the first month, so she had 40 cards in total.  Third month, she had 40 cards and collected two times more than the first month, so she had 80 cards in total.  Therefore, Elaine has a total of 80 + 40 + 60 = 180 Pokémon cards.
Response:  We know that Mark writes 1000 sentences per week and each sentence brings him 5 cents from Julkaisija A. So he earns 5000 cents (or $50) from Julkaisija A per week. Now let's calculate how much he earns from Julkaisija B. Since Julkaisija B pays twice as much as Julkaisija A, Mark earns 2 x 5000 = 10,000 cents ($100) from Julkaisija B per week. Therefore, Mark's total weekly income is 5000 + 10,000 = 15,000 cents or $150.
Response:  First, we know that Baldur gets five water jugs every morning and six water jugs every evening.  Each water jug contains 5 liters of water, so let's calculate how much water he gets in total each day.  Morning: 5 x 5 = 25 liters Evening: 6 x 5 = 30 liters Total daily water intake: 25 + 30 = 55 liters So, Baldur consumes 55 liters of water per day.
Response:  First, we know that John earns $2000 per week, or $104,000 per year (2000 x 52).  Next, we know that he received a bonus of $5000 and a 5% raise, so his total earnings for the year are:   Total Earnings = $104,000 + $5000 + ($104,000 x 5%)   Calculate the total earnings:   Total Earnings = $104,000 + $5000 + ($104,000 x 5%)   Total Earnings = $104,000 + $5000 + $5200   Total Earnings = $119,200   Therefore, John earned $119,200 in that year.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many tons of grapes are produced per hectare: 5 tons/hectare x 10 hectares = 50 tons/year. Next, we can calculate how many liters of wine are produced per ton of grapes: 2 tons/ton x 50 tons = 100 tons of wine/year. Finally, we can convert this amount to tynnyri (a unit of measurement for wine): 100 tons / 200 liters/tynnyr = 0.5 tynnyrs/year or 5 tynnyrs/year. So, Josie produces 5 tynnyrs of wine per year on her 10-hectare vineyard.
Response:  First, we know that Carlin used two slices of cheese for each sandwich, so she used 2 x 3 = 6 slices of cheese in total for her three daily sandwiches.  Next, we know that she used one more slice of cheese for each muffin than for each sandwich, so she used 1 + 3 = 4 slices of cheese for her morning muffins.  Finally, we know that she used eight slices of cheese for her macaroni and cheese dish, which means she used 8 - 6 = 2 additional slices of cheese.  Therefore, in total, Carlin used 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 slices of cheese during the week.
Response:  First, we know that Janetilla had 22 green and 10 yellow pens. So she had a total of 32 pens.  Next, we know that she bought six packs of blue pens, each with nine pens. That means she got 6 x 9 = 54 new pens. And she also bought two packs of red pens, each with six pens. That gives her an additional 2 x 6 = 12 new pens.  In total, then, Janetilla has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the mean of Brinley's first five test scores: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458. Then, we divide the sum by 5 to get the mean: 458 / 5 = 91.8. So, Brinley needs to score at least 91.8 on her sixth test to have an average of 93.
Response:  First, we know that Michael rode his bike five times a week for four weeks, so he rode a total of 4 x 5 = 20 times.  Next, we know that each time he rode, he traveled 25 kilometers, so he covered a total distance of 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers during those four weeks.  Finally, we know that in the third week, he reduced his frequency to two times per week and doubled his distance to 60 kilometers per ride, so he rode twice for a total of 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers that week.  Therefore, Michael rode a total of 500 + 120 = 620 kilometers over the entire six-week period.
Response:  First, we know that each chocolate bar weights twice as much as one apple. So if one chocolate bar weights 40 grams, two apples would weight 40/2 = 20 grams. Since Joen has 25 chocolate bars and 80 apples, the total weight of her chocolate bars is 25 x 40 = 1000 grams and the total weight of her apples is 80 x 20 = 1600 grams. Therefore, Joen's total weight in grams is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams.
"Response:  First, she bought 4 cakes on Monday.  Next, she went back to the store on Tuesday and bought 3 times as many cakes as she did on Monday (since ""kolme kertaa"" means ""three times""). So, on Tuesday, she bought 12 cakes (3 x 4 = 12).  On Wednesday, she went back to the store again and bought 5 times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday (since ""viisi kertaa"" means ""five times""). So, on Wednesday, she bought 60 cakes (5 x 12 = 60).  In total, she bought 72 cakes (4 + 12 + 60 = 72) over three days."
Response:  We know that half a dozen (3) plates cost $6000, so each plate costs $6000/3 = $2000.  Now we need to find out how many cups of coffee it would take to equal the cost of one plate.  We know that 1200 dollars is less than $2000, so we can set up an equation:  1200 = x \* 4 (since there are 4 cups in a pint)  Solving for x, we get:  x = 1200 / 4 = 300 cups of coffee.  So, it would take 300 cups of coffee to equal the cost of one plate.
Response:  First, we know that Sara has saved $10 before becoming a babysitter. So she has $10 + $5 (from babysitting) = $15 in total.  Next, we know that the takki costs $30 and the kengät cost $20, so together they cost $30 + $20 = $50.  Since Sara only has $15, she needs to earn more money to buy the takki and kengät.  We know that she gets paid $5 each time she takes care of her neighbor's children, so she needs to take care of them 5 x $5 = $25 more times.  After taking care of the children 5 times, she will have earned enough money ($25) to buy the takki and kengät.  Therefore, Sara needs to take care of the children 5 times before she can afford the new outfit.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry has twice as many white chickens as red ones. So if he has x red chickens, he has 2x white chickens. Now, each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day and each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs laid by all the chickens is: 3x + 5(2x) = 3x + 10x = 13x. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation: 13x = 42. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. So Jerry has 3 red chickens.
Response:  First, we know that Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour (3 mi/h).  Second, we know that he wants to walk around the square-shaped park, which has a length of half a mile and a width of six miles (0.5 mi x 6 mi = 3 mi^2).  Now, let's calculate how long it would take him to walk around the park once: Time = Distance / Rate Time = 3 mi^2 / 3 mi/h Time = 1 hour So, Gary will spend one hour walking around the park once.  To find out how many hours he spends if he walks for n times, we can simply multiply the time by n: Total Time = Number of Times x Hour Spent Per Time Total Time = n x 1 hour Therefore, the answer is: If Gary walks around the park n times, he will spend n hours doing so.
Response:  First day, Sloane had 100 customers.  Second day, she had 50 more than the first day, so she had 100 + 50 = 150 customers. Third day, she had 50 more than the second day, so she had 150 + 50 = 200 customers. Therefore, Sloane had 200 customers on the third day.
Response:  We know that in four minutes ago, there was twice as much water in the large tank than in the small one. So if x gallons of water were in the small tank, then y = 2x gallons of water were in the large tank (where y is the amount of water in the large tank). Now we are told that currently, there is four times as much water in the large tank as in the small tank. Therefore, the current amount of water in the small tank can be found by dividing the current amount of water in the large tank by four: z = y/4, where z is the current amount of water in the small tank. Substituting y = 2x and solving for x gives us x = 2z/3. So the current amount of water in the small tank is 2z/3 gallons.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Loris earns per hour. We know that she earns $8 per hour from her part-time job. Next, we need to find out how many hours she needs to work in order to afford the items she wants to buy.  To do this, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:  Let x represent the number of hours Loris works.  The cost of the shoes is $320, so the equation for that would be:  320 = x(8)  Since Loris also wants to buy a $32 vest, we need another equation:  32 = x(8)  Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and ).  Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  x = 40  This means that Loris needs to work for 40 hours before she can afford both the shoes and the vest.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Janeth will pay in total if she pays $165 per month for 12 months.  We can do this by multiplying the number of months by the monthly payment amount:  12 x $165 = $1980  Now, let's subtract the total amount paid ($1980) from the original amount borrowed ($2000):  $2000 - $1980 = $20  So, after 12 months, Janeth will have $20 left over from the original $2000.
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the vase and seven more daisies than roses. So if we subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers to find out how many daisies there are, we get: Total Flowers - Roses = Daisies 7 (more daisies) + 4 (roses) =?  Now let's add up all the numbers to find out how many flowers there are altogether: 4 (roses) + 7 (daisies) +? =?  Since there are four roses and seven daisies, we can start by adding those two numbers together: 4 + 7 = 11  Then, we add one more to account for the unknown quantity: 11 + 1 = 12  Therefore, there are 12 flowers in the vase altogether!
Response:  First, we know that Harriet is currently 21 years old.  In three years, she will be 24 years old (21 + 3 = 24).  Now, let's calculate the average age of Adrian and Harriet's children.  We know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so he will be 63 years old in three years (21 x 3 = 63).  The average age of their children will be half of Adrian's age, which is 63/2 = 31.5 years old.  However, since we are rounding up to the nearest whole number, the average age of their children will be 32 years old in three years.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Yuri scored 10 more points than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.  Secondly, we know that Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.  Finally, we know that the total score of all four students is 251, so we can set up an equation:  78 + 85 + x = 251 where x is the score of Jojo. Solving for x, we get:  x = 251 - (78 + 85) = 251 - 163 = 88 points.  Therefore, Jojo scored 88 points.
Response:  First, we know that Carmen spent 3 hours solving crosswords (3 x 60 = 180 minutes).  Next, we know she spent 4 hours solving Sudokus (4 x 60 = 240 minutes).  In total, she spent 180 + 240 = 420 minutes playing puzzles.
Response:  First, we know that Celina needed 90 liters of water from the tank for her small garden irrigation. Secondly, she was able to collect rainwater which is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, if we let X be the number of liters of water left in the tank after Celina took out 90 liters, then we can write an equation based on this information:  X + 90 = 2(X)...  and solve it!
Response:  First, we know that Andy has fewer petunias than geraniums. So if he has 90 geraniums and 40 petunias, then he must have at least 90 - 40 = 50 more geraniums.  Since each geranium plant produces 3 flowers, Andy will have 50 x 3 = 150 flowers in total.  However, this does not include the petunias, which produce 2 flowers per plant. So let's add the number of petunias to the total: 150 + (40 x 2) = 150 + 80 = 230 flowers in total.  Therefore, Andy will have 230 flowers in his garden.
"Response:  First, we know that the company spends $15,000 per year on advertising and then one-third of that amount in the following year. So, if they spend $15,000 in Year 1, how much will they spend in Year 2?  To find out, we need to calculate one-third of $15,000. One-third of $15,000 is:  
$15,000 x (1/3) = $5,000  Therefore, the company will spend $5,000 in Year 2 on advertising.  Now, let's add up the total amount spent by the company over two years:  Year 1: $15,000 + Year 2: $5,000 = Total: $20,000  The company has spent a total of $20,000 on advertising over two years."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Carlos and Benji pay for their rentals separately.  For Carlos:  Rental fee = $30/hour x 3 hours = $90  For Benji:  Rental fee = $18/hour x 5 hours = $90  Now, let's add up the total amount they pay:  Total = $90 + $90 = $180  So, Carlos and Benji will pay a total of $180 for their rentals.
Response:  First, Andrew travels from New Jersey to Rochester by bus for 6 days (since the bus trip takes 6 days). Then he spends some time in Rochester before returning home. To return home, he drives for half of the distance between Rochester and New Jersey (since driving takes half the time as the bus ride). So, in total, Andrew spends 6 + X days on his trip, where X is the number of days he spends in Rochester.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of cards that James has after he loses 8 water-type cards and buys 14 grass-type cards. Total number of cards = 30 + 20 - 8 + 14 = 56 cards. Now, we can calculate the percentage of water-type cards left in James' deck after he buys new grass-type cards. Percentage of water-type cards = (Number of water-type cards before buying new cards x 100) / Total number of cards After losing 8 water-type cards, Number of water-type cards before buying new cards = 40 - 8 = 32. Therefore, Percentage of water-type cards = (32 x 100) / 56 = 57.14% So, there is a 57.14% chance that a randomly selected card from James' deck will be a water-type card.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Chad spends on each ingredient.  For the burrito itself, he pays $6.50.  He adds:  * Beef ($2) * Cheese ($1) * Avocado ($1) * Salsa ($.50 x 2 = $1) Total cost of ingredients: $9.50 Next, we need to add the additional costs:  * Pesto ($3) Total cost with pesto: $12.50 Now, let's subtract the discount from the lahjakortti:  Discount: $3 Subtracting the discount from the total cost: $12.50 - $3 = $9.50 So, Chad is left with $9.50 in debt after his meal.
"Response: 1) How many minutes will it take for Kalinda to do 360 puzzles at her normal rate of 4 pieces per minute? 2) How long will it take her mother to solve half of that amount (since she can only set half as much)? 3) Add up their total time to find out how many hours they need to spend solving the puzzles.  
Step 1: Calculate Kalinda's time. 360 puzzles x 4 pieces/minute = 1440 minutes (20 hours)  
Step 2: Calculate her mother's time. Half of 1440 is 720 minutes (12 hours).  
Step 3: Add their times together. 20 + 12 = 32 hours. Therefore, Kalinda and her mother need to spend 32 hours solving these puzzles."
"Response:  We know that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks ago, so we can find out how many watermelons were not ready for harvest at that time.  If 30% of the watermelons were ready, then 70% were not ready (100% - 30%).  Since there were 120 watermelons in total, we can calculate how many were not ready for harvest as follows:  
Not ready = Total x Percentage not ready  
= 120 x 70%  
= 84  
So, 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest two weeks ago. Now, we know that three-fourths of the watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks, so we can calculate how many watermelons were still not ready for harvest as follows:  
Not ready = Total x Percentage not ready  
= 84 x (1 - 3/4)  
= 84 x 1/4  
= 21  
Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready for harvest two weeks after the first harvest."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Mark makes from each car he sells. We know that each car costs $20,000 and Mark pays a 10% tax on the cars. So, if we multiply $20,000 by 10%, we get $2,000 in taxes per car. Now, let's add the taxes to the cost of each car: $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000.  Next, we need to find out how much Mark pays for registering each car. We know that he pays $1,000 for registration. So, if we multiply $22,000 (the cost of each car) by $1,000 (registration fee), we get $22,000 x $1,000 = $22,000,000.  Finally, we can add up all the amounts that Mark pays for each car to find out how much he pays in total: $22,000 (cost of each car) + $2,000 (tax on each car) + $1,000 (registration fee) = $25,000.  Therefore, Mark pays $25,000 for each car he sells. Since he sold 12 cars, he pays a total of $25,000 x 12 = $300,000.
Response:  First, we know that Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert on Monday. So if Robert collected x shells, then Kylie collected x + 5 shells.  On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday. So if she collected x + 5 shells on Monday, she will collect 2(x + 5) = 2x + 10 shells on Tuesday.  Now we need to find out how many shells Robert collected on Monday. We know that he collected less than Kylie, so let's say he collected x shells. Then we can write an equation based on what we know:  Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so the difference between their collections is 5:  Kylie collected x + 5 shells, and Robert collected x shells.  Since Kylie collected twice as many shells on Tuesday as she did on Monday, her total collection for both days is 2(x + 5) = 2x + 10.  To find out how many shells Robert collected on Monday, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:  Robert collected 20 fewer shells than Kylie on Monday, so the difference between their collections is 20:  Kylie collected x + 5 shells, and Robert collected x - 20 shells.  Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:  x = 8  So Robert collected 8 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 8 + 5 = 13 shells on Monday.  Finally, we can find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday by substituting x = 8 into the equation 2x + 10 = 2(8) + 10:  2(8) + 10 = 16 + 10 = 26  Therefore, Kylie collected 26 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there are 50 ants in the garden and each ant has 2 eggs, then there are 100 eggs in total (50 x 2). However, if Dax found half of the eggs, then there would be 50 eggs left in the garden (100 / 2 = 50). Therefore, there are 50 eggs in the garden.
Response: 1/3 of the penguins are swimming in the ocean (36 / 3 = 12). 1/3 of the remaining penguins go to the cave to eat their dinner (12 x 1/3 = 4). So, there are 4 penguins left basking in the sun.
Response:  First, we know that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. So if she eats x tomatoes per day, he eats 2x tomatoes per day.  Second, we know that Steve eats six days a week (he doesn't eat on the seventh day). So in total, he eats 6 x 2x = 12x tomatoes per week.  Third, we know that the yield of the vine is three tomatoes per week. So to satisfy Steve's demand, he needs at least 12x - 3x = 9x tomatoes more than what the vine produces.  Finally, since each tomato plant produces three tomatoes per week, Steve needs 9x / 3x = 3 times as many plants as his girlfriend has.  Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  First, we know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend will receive four slices of pizza. So, the total number of slices needed is 20 x 4 = 80 slices. Since pizzas can only be cut into eight pieces, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John needs to order 9 pizzas (80/8 = 9).
Response:  Firstly, if he mixes five empty pens together, he will have one full pen with the ink of all five pens combined. Therefore, if he has 25 pens and wants to make one full pen, he needs to collect the ink from five pens. So, he can use 25/5 = 5 pens to get one full pen. Now, let's calculate how many pens he has altogether. He has 25 original pens and 5 mixed pens, so he has a total of 25 + 5 = 30 pens.
Response:  First, we know that Johnny had $20 in his wallet and added $10 to it. So he started with $30. Next, we are told that this amount tripled within a year. This means that after one year, Johnny will have $30 x 3 = $90. Therefore, Johnny has $90 one year later.
Response:  First, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So if Joan is x years old, Mary is x - 2 years old.  Second, we know that Joan is five years older than Jessa. So if Jessa is y years old, Joan is y + 5 years old.  Finally, we want to find the sum of all three girls' ages. We can do this by adding their ages together: x + (x - 2) + y + 5 =?  Now let's substitute some numbers for the variables. Suppose Jessa is 20 years old. Then Joan would be 20 + 5 = 25 years old, and Mary would be 20 - 2 = 18 years old. The sum of their ages is: 18 + 25 + 20 = 63 years old.
"Response:  Firstly we need to find out how many students left through each exit.  So, if 30% of the students left through exit A, that means 30% of 1000 = 300 students left through exit A.  
Now, if 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., 600) left through exit B, then 3/5 x 600 = 480 students left through exit B.  
Finally, since all the remaining students (i.e., 200) left through exit C, there are 200 students who left through exit C.  Therefore, the total number of students who left the school is:  
300 + 480 + 200 = 980 students."
"Response:  First, we know that James has six more candies than Robert. So if Robert has x candies, James has x + 6 candies.  Next, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So if Robert has x candies, John has 2x candies.  Finally, we are told that John has 54 candies.  So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

x + (x + 6) = 54  

Simplifying this equation, we get:  

2x + 6 = 54  

Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:  

2x = 48  

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  

x = 24  

So Robert has 24 candies and James has 24 + 6 = 30 candies. Therefore, James has 30 - 24 = 6 more candies than Robert."
Response:  First, we know that Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book.  So together they have three books.  If they read each other's books, then Dolly will read one book (Pandora's) and Pandora will read one book (Dolly's).  Therefore, in total, they will have read two + one = three books together.
Response: 1) Number of letters he writes per week = 2 x 5 pages/week = 10 pages/week 2) Time taken to write one page = 6 minutes/page 3) Total time taken to write 10 pages = 10 x 6 minutes = 60 minutes 4) Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 60 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1 hour  Therefore, Mike spends 1 hour writing per week.
Response:  First, we know that Jason has made 300 minutes of extra calls, and he makes 15-minute calls to his boss every day. So, in total, he has made 300/15 = 20 days worth of calls. Since there are 30 days in this month, Jason has made an additional 20 days x 15 minutes per day = 300 minutes of calls. Now, let's calculate how many minutes Jason has left for the remaining 10 days of the month. To do this, we need to subtract the number of minutes he has already used from the total number of minutes available. In this case, we can use the formula: Total Minutes Available - Used Minutes = Remaining Minutes. Total Minutes Available = 1000 (since Jason has 1000 minutes available each month) Used Minutes = 300 (the number of minutes Jason has already used) Therefore, Remaining Minutes = Total Minutes Available - Used Minutes = 1000 - 300 = 700 minutes. So, Jason has 700 minutes left for the remaining 10 days of the month.
Response:  First, we know that Kyle took five of the French from Griffin.  So, if Griffin had 24 French to start with, he has 19 left (24 - 5 = 19).  Next, we are told that Billy took twice as many as Kyle.  So, Billy took two times five, or ten French.  That means Griffin now has 19 - 10 = 9 French left.  Then, we are told that Ginger gave Griffin a handful of French.  We don't know how many exactly, but we do know that it was less than three, because Colby took three fewer than Kyle took.  Since Kyle took five, Colby took three (5 - 3 = 2).  Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin two French (since two is less than three).  Finally, we are told that Griffin ended up with 27 French.  So, let's add up all the numbers:  9 + 2 + 27 = 38  Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin two French.
Response:  We know that in one aquarium there are four tanks and each tank contains x fish. In total, there are 4x fish in this aquarium.  Similarly, in the other aquarium, there are 32 tanks and each tank contains y fish. In total, there are 32y fish in this aquarium.  Now we need to find out how many fish are in both aquariums combined.  Can you use the information given in the problem to help you figure it out?
Response:  First, we know that Jean pays $250 per hour for Meikki's services.  Second, we know that Meikki works four times a week (4 x 6 hours/day = 24 hours/week). Third, we know that Meikki works for five weeks (5 weeks x 24 hours/week = 120 hours total). Fourth, we know that Meikki gives Jean a 10% discount for the amount of work done. Finally, we can calculate the total amount Jean pays to Meikki.  So, let's start with the calculation of the total number of hours Meikki works for Jean:  120 hours (total) = 4 weeks x 24 hours/week + 1 week x 24 hours/week = 48 hours/week x 4 weeks + 24 hours/week x 1 week = 192 hours + 96 hours = 288 hours  Now, let's calculate the total amount Jean pays to Meikki without the discount:  288 hours x $250/hour = $72,000  And finally, let's apply the 10% discount:  72,000 x 0.9 = $65,200  Therefore, Jean pays $65,200 to Meikki for her makeup services over the course of five weeks.
Response:  First, we know that Isabelle spent $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98 on her little sister's birthday party.  We also know that she divided the cost equally among three people (her parents and herself), so each person paid $\frac{98}{3} = 32$ dollars.  Therefore, Isabelle paid $32$ dollars for her sister's birthday party.
Response:  First, we know that each bag of onions costs $1.50.  Second, we know that Kokki bought four bags of onions.  So, if we multiply the cost per bag by the number of bags, we get:  4 x $1.50 = $6.00  Therefore, Kokki has spent $6.00 on onions.
Response:  First, we know that Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. So if her sister ate x cookies, Sue ate 4x cookies. We also know that Sue ate two times as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. So if her sister ate x cookies again, Sue ate 2x cookies. Now let's add up all the calories eaten by both girls over the two days:  On Monday, Sue ate 4x cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 800 calories more than her sister.  On Tuesday, Sue ate 2x cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 400 calories more than her sister.  Total extra calories eaten by Sue = 800 + 400 = 1200 calories.  Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies over the next day, she consumed a total of:  5 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 1000 calories + 13 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 2600 calories = 3600 calories.  Therefore, Sue consumed 1200 calories more than her sister over the two days.
