1. The number of eggs sold per day is given as 16 eggs.
2. The price of each egg is $2.
3. The total revenue from selling eggs per day is therefore 16 x $2 = $32.
4. To calculate the daily profit, we need to subtract the cost of producing each egg (which is not provided in the question). Let's assume it costs $1 to produce one egg. Then, the daily profit would be $32 - $1 = $31 per day.
5. Finally, to find out how much money Thai will have after 7 days, we multiply the daily profit by 7: $31 x 7 = $217."

1. The first person uses 2 mornings of water to wash their face, and they use 1/4 cup of soap for each morning. Therefore, the total amount of water used is 2 x 2 = 4 mornings.
2. For the second person, they use 3 mornings of water to wash their face, and they also use 1/4 cup of soap for each morning. So, the total amount of water used is 3 x 2 = 6 mornings.
3. Now, let's calculate the number of cups of water used in total. Since there are 8 mornings in total (4 + 6), we can divide the total amount of water used by the number of mornings to get the average amount of water used per morning. Therefore, the average amount of water used per morning is: 4 mornings / 8 mornings = 0.5 cups of water per morning."

Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of buying and renovating the house as follows:
Total Cost = Purchase Price + Renovation Cost
= $80,000 + $50,000
= $130,000
Now, let's calculate the percentage increase in value after renovation as follows:
Percentage Increase in Value = (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value x 100
= ($150,000 - $130,000) / $130,000 x 100
= 16.92%
Therefore, the person will make 16.92% profit from their investment."

Firstly, we need to calculate the total hours worked in a week. As the employee works for 40 hours per week, it is given that they work for 40 x 4 = 160 hours per month.
Next, we need to calculate the overtime pay based on the hourly wage of $10 and the number of overtime hours worked. Since the employee works for 160 hours per month, and 45 hours are considered overtime, the overtime pay can be calculated as follows:
Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours x Hourly Wage
= 45 hours x $10/hour
= $450
Therefore, the total income of the employee for the month is their basic salary + overtime pay:
Total Income = Basic Salary + Overtime Pay
= $3,200 + $450
= $3,650
So, the employee's total income for the month is $3,650."

Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing both machines. The cost of the first machine is $5,000, and the cost of the second machine is $8,000. Therefore, the total cost of purchasing both machines is:

Total Cost = $5,000 + $8,000 = $13,000

Next, we need to calculate the depreciation for each machine using the straight-line method with a useful life of 5 years and a residual value of 20%. For the first machine, the annual depreciation is:

Annual Depreciation (Machine 1) = ($13,000 x 20%) / 5 = $460
For the second machine, the annual depreciation is:

Annual Depreciation (Machine 2) = ($13,000 x 20%) / 5 = $460

Now, let's calculate the operating income for each machine based on their respective annual depreciations:

Operating Income (Machine 1) = Revenue - Annual Depreciation = $10,000 - $460 = $9,540
Operating Income (Machine 2) = Revenue - Annual Depreciation = $12,000 - $460 = $11,540

Finally, we need to calculate the overall operating income for both machines combined:

Overall Operating Income = Sum of Machine 1 & Machine 2 Operating Income = $9,540 + $11,540 = $21,080

Therefore, the answer is $21,080."

Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of calories in the food that Thai will eat per day. According to the question, Thai eats 250 grams of rice per meal, which means he consumes 250 x 7 = 1750 grams of rice per day. Additionally, he drinks 300 grams of milk per day. Therefore, the total amount of calories from food is:

1750 grams of rice x 400 calories/gram (of rice) + 300 grams of milk x 90 calories/gram (of milk) = 6900 calories/day

Next, we need to determine how many calories Thai has left after working for one hour. According to the question, Thai works for 2 hours and earns 250 calories per hour. Therefore, the number of calories Thai has earned after working for one hour is:

250 calories/hour x 1 hour = 250 calories

Finally, we can calculate the number of calories Thai has left after working for one hour as follows:

Total calories consumed - Calories earned = Remaining calories
= 6900 calories/day - 250 calories = 6650 calories/day

Therefore, Thai has 6650 calories left after working for one hour."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages that can be written with one pen.
One pen can write 10 sheets in one day, and there are 365 days in a year (assuming a non-leap year). Therefore, the total number of pages that can be written with one pen is:
Total pages = Number of sheets x Number of days
= 10 x 365
= 3650 pages
Step 2: Calculate the cost of each page written with one pen.
The price of each sheet of paper is $10, and there are 10 sheets in one pack. Therefore, the cost of each page written with one pen is:
Cost per page = Price of one sheet / Number of sheets in a pack
= $10 / 10
= $1 per page
Step 3: Calculate the profit earned from selling 20 packets of papers.
Assume that the seller sells each packet for $20, and there are 20 packets in total. The total revenue earned is therefore:
Total revenue = Number of packets x Selling price of each packet
= 20 x $20
= $400
Step 4: Calculate the profit margin as a percentage.
To calculate the profit margin as a percentage, we need to divide the profit earned by the total revenue and multiply by 100. Therefore, the profit margin as a percentage is:
Profit margin (%) = Profit earned / Total revenue x 100
= $400 / $400 x 100
= 100%
Therefore, the answer to the question is 100%."

"Response: 
1. The farmer has 252 eggs per day and sells them at $2 each. So, the total revenue from egg sales is:
$2 x 252 = $504 per day
2. Now, let's calculate the cost of producing one egg. According to the question, it takes 3 hours for the chicken to lay an egg, so the daily production time is:
3 hours/day x 252 days/year = 768 hours/year
Now, let's assume that the chicken lays an average of 3 eggs per day (which is a rough estimate). Therefore, the number of eggs produced per year is:
768 hours/year / 3 eggs/day = 256 eggs/year
So, the cost of producing one egg is:
$2 x 256 eggs/year = $512 per year
Therefore, the profit from egg production per year is:
Profit = Revenue - Cost = $504 - $512 = $12 per year
So, the farmer makes $12 in profit per year from each chicken."

The father has 3 dogs and 4 cats at home. The mother said that one of the dogs ran away with its tail cut off. So there are only 2 dogs left at home now.
From the information given in the passage, we can conclude that:
Number of dogs = 3 (initially) - 1 (ran away) = 2 (now)
Number of cats = 4 (initially) = 4 (now)
So, the total number of pets at home now is 2 + 4 = 6 pets."

"Response: 
The volume of water that can be absorbed by the towel is 5000 ml (as stated in the question).
Now, we need to calculate how much water will be left after it has been absorbed by the towel.
Let's assume that each liter of water absorbed by the towel reduces its weight by 2 kg (this value may vary depending on the type of fabric and other factors).
So, if we have 5000 ml of water, and each liter of water absorbs 2 kg of weight from the towel, then the total weight reduction after absorbing all 5000 ml of water would be:
Weight reduction = 5000 ml x 2 kg/liter = 10,000 kg
Now, let's convert this weight reduction to number of layers of towels based on their thickness:
Assuming each layer of towel is approximately 0.2 mm thick (based on typical bath towel dimensions), we can calculate the number of layers as follows:
Number of layers = Weight reduction / Thickness of towel = 10,000 kg / 0.2 mm = 50,000 layers
Therefore, if you have a towel with a capacity of 5000 ml and you immerse it in water, you can expect it to absorb around 50,000 layers or so, depending on the specific properties of the towel and the amount of water used."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total cost of shipping for all orders.
Total cost = Number of orders x Shipping cost per order
Number of orders = Total value of sales / Price of one product
= $40,000 / $30
= 1,333 orders
Step 2: Calculate the additional fee for each order based on the percentage of the total value of sales.
Additional fee = Total value of sales x Percentage of total value of sales
Percentage of total value of sales = 25%
= $40,000 x 25%
= $10,000
Step 3: Add the additional fee to the total cost of shipping for each order.
New total cost of shipping = Old total cost of shipping + Additional fee
For the first 1,333 orders, new total cost of shipping = $3 x 1,333 = $3,999
For the remaining orders (if any), new total cost of shipping = $3 x number of orders = $X
Where X is the number of remaining orders.
Therefore, the total cost of shipping for all orders is $3,999 + $X = $X,XXX."

Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies in the litter.
Number of puppies = 25

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of healthy puppies (those that are not sick or weak).
Healthy puppies = Number of healthy puppies / Total number of puppies x 100
= 20/25 x 100 = 80%

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of puppies with mild symptoms (those that are slightly sick but can still walk and play).
Mildly sick puppies = Number of mildly sick puppies / Total number of puppies x 100
= 4/25 x 100 = 16%

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of puppies with severe symptoms (those that cannot walk or play).
Severely sick puppies = Number of severely sick puppies / Total number of puppies x 100
= 1/25 x 100 = 4%

Step 5: Calculate the percentage of dead puppies.
Dead puppies = Number of dead puppies / Total number of puppies x 100
= 1/25 x 100 = 4%

Therefore, there are 80% healthy puppies, 16% mildly sick puppies, 4% severely sick puppies, and 4% dead puppies in the litter."

The distance traveled by the car is 100 miles and then it needs to be filled with gasoline again after that distance. The person wants to know how many gallons of gasoline will be needed for each fill-up.
To calculate this, we need to divide the total distance traveled (100 miles) by the distance between fill-ups (4 gallons). This gives us an average fuel economy of 25 miles per gallon (MPG).
So, to find out how many gallons of gasoline will be needed for each fill-up, we can multiply the average MPG by the total distance traveled:
25 MPG x 100 miles = 2500 gallons
Therefore, the person will need 2500 gallons of gasoline for each fill-up."

The length of the longest finger is 175 mm and the width is 35 mm. The ratio between the length and width is 5:2 or 2.5:1.
So, if we want to find out how many fingers are in one hand, we can use this ratio.
For example, if we have a hand with a length of 100 mm (which is half the length of the longest finger), then the width would be 35 mm / 2 = 17.5 mm.
Now, let's calculate the number of fingers in that hand:
Number of fingers = Length of hand / Width of hand
= 100 mm / 17.5 mm
= 5.67 fingers
Therefore, there are approximately 5.67 fingers in one hand based on the given measurements."

"Response: 
The height of each layer is given as $h_k$, where $k$ is the layer number. The total height of all layers is given as $H$.
We are asked to find the area of each layer, which we can call $A_k$.
From the problem statement, we know that $A_k = h_k \times T_k$, where $T_k$ is the thickness of the layer at position $k$.
So, we need to find the value of $T_k$.
Since there are $n$ layers in total, and each layer has a thickness of $\frac{1}{2} \times H$, we have:
$$\sum_{k=1}^n A_k = \sum_{k=1}^n (h_k \times T_k) = \frac{1}{2} \times H \times n = \frac{1}{2} \times H \times (n-1)$$
Now, we need to find the values of $h_k$ and $T_k$. From the problem statement, we know that $h_k = k \times h$, where $h$ is some constant. Also, from the diagram, we see that $T_k = k \times t$, where $t$ is also some constant.
Substituting these expressions into the equation for $\sum_{k=1}^n A_k$, we get:
$$\sum_{k=1}^n A_k = \frac{1}{2} \times H \times (n-1)$$
Solving for $h$ and $t$, we get:
$$h = \frac{H}{n-1}$$
$$t = \frac{H}{n-1}$$
Therefore, the area of each layer is:
$$A_k = h_k \times T_k = k \times (\frac{H}{n-1}) \times k \times (\frac{H}{n-1}) = \frac{H^2}{n-1}$$
So, the area of each layer is proportional to $H^2$."

The weight of water is 1 gram per milliliter (g/mL). So, if we have 125 ml of water, its weight is:
Weight of water = 1 g/mL x 125 ml = 125 grams
Now, let's calculate the weight of each person's drinking water:
Person A has 2 liters of water, so their weight is:
Weight of Person A's water = 1 g/mL x 2 L = 200 grams
Person B has 4 liters of water, so their weight is:
Weight of Person B's water = 1 g/mL x 4 L = 400 grams
To find out how much heavier Person B is than Person A, we need to subtract their weights:
Heavier person = 400 grams - 200 grams = 200 grams
Therefore, Person B is 200 grams heavier than Person A."

Step 1: Calculate the number of matches played in total.
Total number of matches = 22 matches x 7 teams = 154 matches.
Step 2: Calculate the number of wins for each team.
Team A won 8 matches, Team B won 6 matches, Team C won 3 matches, and so on.
Step 3: Calculate the total number of wins for all teams combined.
Total number of wins = Sum of all team wins (8 + 6 + 3 +...).
Step 4: Calculate the average number of wins per team.
Average number of wins per team = Total number of wins / Number of teams.
Step 5: Calculate the difference between the highest and lowest number of wins among all teams.
Highest win difference = Highest number of wins - Lowest number of wins.
Step 6: Calculate the standard deviation of the number of wins for all teams.
Standard deviation of wins = Square root of the variance of wins.
Step 7: Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) of the number of wins for all teams.
Interquartile range of wins = Median of wins - First quartile of wins.
Step 8: Calculate the outlier score based on the IQR.
Outlier score = Score that is more than 1.5 times the IQR away from the median.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly salary of the employee based on the given information.
Monthly Salary = $600 x 12 = $7,200 per year
Step 2: Calculate the percentage of bonus that the company will give to the employee based on the performance of the business in each month.
Percentage Bonus = (Monthly Sales - Monthly Target) / Monthly Target x 10%
For example, if the monthly sales are $50,000 and the monthly target is $40,000, then the percentage bonus would be:
Percentage Bonus = ($50,000 - $40,000) / $40,000 x 10% = 25%
Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money that the employee will receive as a bonus based on their performance in each month.
Total Bonus Amount = Percentage Bonus x Monthly Salary
Using the previous example, the total bonus amount for the month would be:
Total Bonus Amount = 25% x $7,200 = $1,800
Step 4: Repeat steps 2-3 for each month of the year to determine the total amount of bonus that the employee will receive over the course of the year.
Therefore, the total amount of bonus that the employee will receive over the course of the year is:
Total Bonus Amount = $1,800 x 12 = $21,600
So, the employee will receive a total of $21,600 in bonuses over the course of the year, in addition to their regular monthly salary of $7,200."
Response:  The song of Marilyn Monroe has a pitch range of approximately 88,000 Hz. To convert this to decibels (dB), we can use the following formula: dB = log10(frequency) x 20 x π.

"Response: 
The original question is asking about how long it takes for someone to lose weight if they consume 400 ml of water per day and exercise regularly. The question also mentions that the person has been exercising for two years.
To calculate the time taken to lose weight, we need to consider several factors such as the amount of water consumed, the type and intensity of exercise, and the individual's starting weight and body composition.
Assuming an average weight loss rate of 1-2 kg per month, and considering that the person has been exercising for two years, we can estimate the total weight lost over this period as follows:
Weight lost = (Total water consumption in liters x Exercise duration in minutes) / (Body weight at start of exercise x Body fat percentage at start of exercise)
Using the values provided in the question, we have:
Weight lost = (400 ml/day x 38 weeks) / (75 kg x 30%) = 16.9 kg
Now, let's assume that the person wants to lose another 10 kg over the next three months, which would be equivalent to losing 0.33 kg per week. To achieve this, they will need to increase their daily water intake to 600 ml or more, depending on their activity level and other factors.
Therefore, the estimated time taken to reach the desired weight loss goal of 10 kg is as follows:
Time taken to reach goal = Total weight lost / Desired weight loss per week
= 16.9 kg / 0.33 kg/week = 50 weeks
So, based on these calculations, it would take approximately 50 weeks or around 11 months for the person to lose an additional 10 kg of weight if they continue to exercise regularly and increase their water intake accordingly."

Cost per dress = 40 baht/dress
Total cost of all dresses = 18 x 40 baht/dress = 720 baht
Mary wants to share them equally among her friends and family, so she will give each person X number of dresses.
X = Total cost of all dresses / Number of people
X = 720 baht / (number of friends + number of family)
Now let's find out how many pieces of each dress Mary will have left after sharing them:
For each friend or family member, we can calculate the number of dresses they will receive based on the total number of dresses available and the number of people involved:
Friends or family members who receive X dresses = Total number of dresses - (Number of people x X)
For example, if there are 5 friends and 3 family members, the calculation would be:
Friends who receive X dresses = 18 - (5 x X) = 18 - 25 = 6 dresses
Family members who receive X dresses = 18 - (3 x X) = 18 - 9 = 9 dresses
So, Mary will have 6 + 9 = 15 pieces of each dress left after sharing them with her friends and family."

The distance from the shoulder to the elbow is approximately 6 inches (or 15 cm).
The distance from the elbow to the wrist is approximately 4 inches (or 10 cm).
So, in total, there are 10 inches (or 25 cm) of forearm length between the shoulder and wrist.
Now, let's calculate how many minutes it would take to massage each section of the forearm:
* From the shoulder to the elbow: 10 inches / 60 seconds per minute = approximately 1.67 minutes
* From the elbow to the wrist: 10 inches / 60 seconds per minute = approximately 1.67 minutes
* Total time to massage the entire forearm: Approximately 3.34 minutes (1.67 + 1.67 + 1.67)
Therefore, if you spend 10 minutes massaging each section of the forearm, it will take approximately 33.4 minutes to complete the entire massage."

The hospital has 500 patients per day and each patient spends an average of 24 hours receiving treatment. The doctor thinks that the cost of treating one patient is $150 per hour. Therefore, the total cost of treating all 500 patients per day would be:
$150/hour x 500 patients = $75,000 per day
Now, let's calculate how much money the hospital makes from these patients. Since the doctor thinks that the cost of treating one patient is $200 per hour, the total revenue generated from all 500 patients per day would be:
$200/hour x 500 patients = $100,000 per day
So, the hospital makes $35,000 more than it spends on treating patients ($75,000 - $100,000)."

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of fuel for each trip.
Cost per trip = Fuel price x Distance traveled (in km)
= $15 x 4 trips/month x 30 days/month x 12 months/year
= $18,000/year

Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled in one year.
Total distance traveled = Total number of trips x Average distance per trip (in km)
= 4 trips/month x 30 days/month x 12 months/year x 40 km/trip
= 96,000 km/year

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of maintenance and repair for each trip.
Cost per trip = Maintenance and repair cost x Distance traveled (in km)
= $15 x 40 km/trip
= $600/year

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of maintenance and repair for all trips in one year.
Total cost of maintenance and repair = Total number of trips x Cost per trip
= 4 trips/month x $600/year
= $2,400/year

Therefore, the total cost of owning and maintaining a car that travels 4 times a month for 12 months a year is approximately $2,400 + $18,000 = $20,400 per year."

Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
Step 2: Calculate the delivery fee (20% of the total cost):
$20.00 x 20% = $4.00
Delivery fee = $4.00
Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount that needs to be paid after deducting the delivery fee ($5.00):

Step 1: Distance between Steffie and Thyme's homes (using Google Maps):
Steffie's home is located at X = 15.8 km from the school.
Thyme's home is located at X = 21.7 km from the school.
So, the distance between their homes is:
Distance = sqrt(X^2 + Y^2)
= sqrt((15.8)^2 + (21.7)^2)
= sqrt(239.44 + 469.44)
= sqrt(708.88)
= 28.27 km
Step 2: Time taken to travel from school to Steffie's home:
The speed of Steffie's car is v = 30 km/h.
The distance between the school and Steffie's home is d = 28.27 km.
Time taken = distance / speed
= 28.27 km / 30 km/h
= 90.9 min
Step 3: Time taken to travel from school to Thyme's home:
The speed of Thyme's car is v = 40 km/h.
The distance between the school and Thyme's home is d = 21.7 km.
Time taken = distance / speed
= 21.7 km / 40 km/h

"Response: 
The total number of balls = 300 + 120 + 60 = 480 balls.
Since each ball is 4 inches wide and 6 inches long, we have:
Total length of all balls = 480 x 6 = 2880 inches.
Now, let's convert it to feet:
There are 12 inches in one foot, so:
Total length of all balls in feet = 2880 / 12 = 235 feet."
"Response: 

For each month, there are 30 days. So for 2 months, there will be 60 days (2 x 30 = 60).
The zookeeper needs to buy food for all animals in the zoo every day. For each type of animal, let's assume that they need an average of 50 grams of food per day (this is just an estimate and may vary depending on the size and activity level of the animals).
So for 60 days, the total amount of food needed for all animals in the zoo would be:
60 days x 50 grams/day = 3000 grams (or approximately 3 kilograms) of food per month.
Now, let's calculate how many bags of dog food the zookeeper needs to buy each month:
3000 grams / 50 grams/bag = 60 bags of dog food per month.
Therefore, the answer is 60 bags of dog food per month."
"Response: 
The distance between two points is given as $100 \text{ meters}$.
We have to find out how many times the person can walk this distance in $15 \text{ minutes}$.
To do this, we need to convert $15 \text{ minutes}$ into seconds.
There are $60$ seconds in $1 \text{ minute}$, so:
$$\therefore 15 \text{ minutes} = 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ seconds}$$
Now, we know that the person walks $40 \text{ meters}$ per second.
So, to find out how far they will walk in $900 \text{ seconds}$, we divide the distance by the speed:
$$\therefore distance = 40 \text{ meters/second} \times 900 \text{ seconds} = 36,000 \text{ meters}$$
Finally, we want to know how many times the person can walk this distance in $15 \text{ minutes}$.
We can do this by dividing the total distance by the distance walked per second:
$$\therefore number of times = distance / speed = 36,000 \text{ meters} / 40 \text{ meters/second} = 875 \text{ times}$$
So, the person can walk $875$ times the distance of $100 \text{ meters}$ in $15 \text{ minutes}$."

Now, let's count how many babies FINNY will see in each group:
Group A (morning sickness): 6 babies x 1 = 6 babies
Group B (no morning sickness): 5 babies x 1 = 5 babies
Therefore, FINNY will see a total of 6 + 5 = 11 babies."
"Response: 
The amount of water in the tank increases by 7 feet every day during the weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total increase in water level is:
7 x 5 = 35 feet
Now, let's calculate the change in water level for each day of the week:
Water level on Monday = 17 feet
Change in water level from Monday to Tuesday = 35 - 17 = 18 feet
Water level on Tuesday = 18 + 7 = 25 feet
Change in water level from Tuesday to Wednesday = 25 - 18 = 7 feet
Water level on Wednesday = 7 + 7 = 14 feet
Change in water level from Wednesday to Thursday = 14 - 7 = 7 feet
Water level on Thursday = 7 + 7 = 14 feet
Change in water level from Thursday to Friday = 14 - 7 = 7 feet
Water level on Friday = 7 + 7 = 14 feet
So, the water level in the tank changes by 7 feet every day of the week."

"Response: 
1. The cost of one liter of coconut water is $3.
2. The cost of one liter of tap water is $2.
3. The profit per liter of coconut water sold is $0.50.
4. The number of liters of coconut water sold per day is 20 liters.
Now let's calculate the total revenue and expenses for each option:
Option A (Selling Coconut Water):
Total Revenue = Number of Liters Sold x Price Per Liter
= 20 liters x $3 per liter
= $60 per day
Expenses = Cost of Goods Sold + Other Expenses
= $3 per liter x Number of Liters Sold
+ $2 per liter x Number of Liters Sold
= $60 per day + $40 per day
= $100 per day
Profit = Total Revenue - Expenses
= $60 per day - $100 per day
= -$40 per day
Option B (Selling Tap Water):
Total Revenue = Number of Liters Sold x Price Per Liter
= 20 liters x $2 per liter
= $40 per day
Expenses = Cost of Goods Sold + Other Expenses
= $2 per liter x Number of Liters Sold
+ $1 per liter x Number of Liters Sold
= $40 per day + $20 per day
= $60 per day
Profit = Total Revenue - Expenses
= $40 per day - $60 per day
= -$20 per day
Therefore, based on the given information, selling coconut water results in a loss of $40 per day, while selling tap water results in a profit of $20 per day."

"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate how much money the owner spends on rent each month. According to the question, the owner pays 1/4 of their salary as rent, which is $200 per month.

Next, we need to calculate how much money the owner spends on water and electricity bills. The question states that the owner pays $150 for water and electricity bills every month.

Then, we need to subtract the amount spent on rent and utilities from the total income of $6,000 per month to find out how much money the owner has left after paying all expenses. This gives us:

$6,000 - ($200 + $150) = $5,850

So, the owner has $5,850 left after paying all expenses."

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who got full marks (A).
From the given information, we know that out of 80 students, 3/4 of them got full marks, which means 3/4 x 80 = 60 students got full marks.
So, A = 60.
Step 2: Calculate the number of students who did not get full marks (B).
Now, we need to find out how many students did not get full marks. Since 3/4 of the students got full marks, the remaining 1/4 are the ones who did not get full marks. So, B = 80 - 60 = 20 students.
Therefore, the final answer is:
A = 60 and B = 20."

"Response: 
Let X be the time taken by team A to complete their task (in minutes). Since they have 4 members and each member takes 1 minute to complete their task, we can write:
X = 4(time taken by one person) = 4(60) = 240 minutes
Now, let Y be the time taken by team B to complete their task (in minutes). Since they have 3 members and each member takes 1.5 minutes to complete their task, we can write:
Y = 3(time taken by one person) = 3(90) = 270 minutes
Since both teams started at the same time, the difference in time taken by them is:
Time taken by Team A - Time taken by Team B = X - Y = 240 - 270 = -30 minutes
Therefore, if the race lasted for 55 minutes, then team B will finish 30 minutes before team A."

"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of hairs that the snake needs to shed.
The question states that the snake sheds its skin every 3 months and each time it sheds, it loses about 6 scales per inch. Since there are 10 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total number of scales lost per month as follows:
Total scales lost/month = (Number of feet x Number of scales lost/inch) x Number of inches in a foot
= (3 x 6 x 10) / 12
= 720 scales/month
Step 2: Determine how many hair follicles are present on the snake's body.
According to the question, there are approximately 20 hair follicles per square centimeter of skin. Since the snake has a total body surface area of approximately 1.4 square meters, we can calculate the total number of hair follicles on the snake's body as follows:
Total number of hair follicles = Total body surface area x Number of hair follicles/square centimeter
= 1.4 x 20
= 280 hair follicles
Step 3: Calculate the amount of time it takes for the snake to grow back its hair.
Since the snake sheds its skin every 3 months, it means that it grows back its hair over a period of time. We can estimate this time based on the rate at which the snake grows new scales. According to the question, the snake grows new scales at a rate of approximately 1/3 inch per week. Therefore, it will take approximately 3 weeks for the snake to grow back all of its hair.
So, the final answer is:
Total number of hairs shed per year = 720 x 4 (since the snake sheds its skin 4 times a year)
Total number of hair follicles on the snake's body = 280
Time taken for the snake to grow back its hair = 3 weeks"
"Response:  The man wants to invest $100 in a bond that pays 2% interest per month for 3 months. To calculate how much he will have after 3 months, we can use the formula:

"Response: 
In month 1, she saved 20 cards.
In month 2, she saved fewer cards than in month 1. (We don't know exactly how many fewer.)
So, in total, she saved $X$ cards during the two months.
Now, we are asked to find out how many cards she has in total.
Let's use algebra to solve for $X$.
We know that in month 1, she saved 20 cards, and in month 2, she saved fewer cards than in month 1. So, let's call the number of cards she saved in month 2 as $x$.
We can write an equation based on this information:
$$20 + x = X$$
where $X$ is the total number of cards she has in both months combined.
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$x = X - 20$$
Now, we are also given that she has $20 \times 2 = 40$ cards in total.
Substituting this value into our previous equation, we get:
$$40 = X - 20$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$X = 60$$
Therefore, the girl has $60$ cards in total."
"Response: 

Suppose there are two salespeople, Salesperson A and Salesperson B. They sell products to customers every day, Monday through Sunday. The number of customers they can serve per day is different for each salesperson, as follows:

Salesperson A can serve up to 20 customers per day.
Salesperson B can serve up to 30 customers per day.

Their salaries are also different, with Salesperson A earning $5 per customer served and Salesperson B earning $8 per customer served.

Now, let's calculate how much money each salesperson will make in one week (Monday to Sunday).

For Salesperson A:
Total number of customers served = 20 x 7 = 140 customers
Total income = Total number of customers served x Salary per customer
= 140 x $5
= $700

For Salesperson B:
Total number of customers served = 30 x 7 = 210 customers
Total income = Total number of customers served x Salary per customer
= 210 x $8
= $1680

Therefore, Salesperson B will make more money than Salesperson A in one week."

"Response: 
Firstly, we know that John received a bonus of $5000 once and it was given at the beginning of the year. So, he got the bonus in January.
Secondly, we are told that the bonus is added to his monthly salary and increases by 5% every month. Therefore, his monthly salary after receiving the bonus would be:
$2000 (basic salary) + ($5000 x 5%) = $2100
So, John's total income for the first month after getting the bonus would be $2100.
Now, let's calculate his total income for each subsequent month:
Month 2: $2100 x 1.05 = $2235
Month 3: $2235 x 1.05 = $2369.75
And so on...
Therefore, John's total income for the entire year would be:

"Response: 
Step 1: The first water tank has 20 liters of water and is filled every 4 hours.
Step 2: After 4 hours, the small water tank will have 8 liters of water left (since it can hold 20 liters - 12 liters = 8 liters).
Step 3: Now, let's assume that the large water tank also loses 4 liters of water per hour (just like the small one). So after 4 hours, the large water tank will have lost 16 liters of water (4 liters x 4 hours = 16 liters).
Step 4: Therefore, at this point, the total amount of water in both tanks combined is 20 liters + 8 liters = 28 liters.
Step 5: Since the small water tank still has 8 liters of water left after 4 hours, we know that the large water tank now has 28 liters of water minus 8 liters = 20 liters of water remaining.
So, to summarize:
After 4 hours, the small water tank will have 8 liters of water left, and the large water tank will have 20 liters of water remaining."

* Cheese: $2.00
* Bacon: $1.00
* Avocado: $1.00
* Mushrooms: $1.00
* Onions: $0.25 (since there are two types)

Total cost of additional items = $6.25

Now, let's add the total cost of the additional items to the cost of the burger:

Total cost = $6.50 + $6.25 = $12.75

"Response: 
The probability of getting at least one pregnancy after two months is 30%. So, there are 30 out of 100 (or 30%) chances that you will get pregnant after two months.
Now, let's calculate the number of times you need to have unprotected sex to achieve a 95% chance of getting pregnant within three months.
To do this, we can use the formula: Number of attempts = (Probability of success x Time frame) / (1 - Probability of failure)
In this case, the probability of success is 30%, and the time frame is three months. Therefore, we can plug in these values into the formula like this:
Number of attempts = (0.3 x 3) / (1 - 0.3)
Number of attempts = 9
So, based on the calculation above, you would need to have unprotected sex nine times to achieve a 95% chance of getting pregnant within three months with a 30% probability of getting pregnant each month."

Firstly, we need to calculate how many hours per day Sanan spends talking on the phone with his boss and other people. According to the question, he talks for 15 minutes every day and uses an additional 300 minutes of his daily allowance to talk to others. Therefore, the total time Sanan spends talking on the phone each day is:

15 minutes + (300 minutes / 30 days) = 45 minutes/day

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Sanan has available for leisure activities in a month. Based on the question, he has 1,000 minutes of free time each day, which translates to:

1,000 minutes/day x 30 days = 30,000 minutes/month

Finally, we can calculate the number of hours Sanan has available for leisure activities in a year by multiplying the number of months in a year by the number of hours he has available for leisure activities in a month:

365 days/year x 30,000 minutes/month = 10,950 hours/year

Therefore, Sanan has approximately 10,950 hours available for leisure activities in a year."

"Response: 
In one of the tanks, there are 4 fish and in another tank, there are 32 fish. The number of fish in each tank is different from the number of fish in the other tank. If we compare the two tanks together, then the total number of fish in both tanks is equal to the total number of fish in one tank plus the total number of fish in the other tank. So, if we let x be the number of fish in the first tank and y be the number of fish in the second tank, we can write the equation:
x + y = 4 (from the first tank)
32y = 4 (from the second tank)
Now, we need to solve for x and y. We know that x + y = 4, so we can subtract x from both sides:
y = 4 - x
Now, we substitute this expression for y into the second equation:
32(4 - x) = 4
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
128 - 32x = 4
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:
124 = -32x
Dividing both sides by -32 gives us:
x = 4
So, there are 4 fish in the first tank and 32 fish in the second tank."
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of makeup for each day as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Makeup Days x Cost per Day
= 6 days x $250 per day

The man eats more than his wife in terms of number of meals per week. He eats 7 meals per week, while his wife only eats 4 meals per week.
In terms of amount of food consumed, the man eats an average of 200 calories more than his wife per meal. So if he eats 7 meals per week, that means he consumes an additional 1400 calories (200 x 7) compared to his wife who eats 4 meals per week and consumes an additional 800 calories (200 x 4).
Therefore, the difference in calorie consumption between the two is 600 calories per week (1400 - 800 = 600)."
