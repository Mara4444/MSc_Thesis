Response:  The buyer will have a $750 profit if they choose to buy jewelry worth $5000 at the end of the month instead of electronics worth $8000.  Explanation:  If the market for jewelry grows by 2.5% and the market for electronics grows by 1.2%, then the value of each item will increase by a different amount. Specifically, the value of jewelry will increase by $12.50 (2.5% of $5000), while the value of electronics will increase by $96 (1.2% of $8000). Therefore, if the buyer chooses to buy jewelry at the end of the month, their profit will be $750 ($12.50 - $96).

Explanation:
Jill works as a teacher for 35 hours per week and as a cheerleading coach for 15 hours per week. If she works 50 weeks in a year (assuming 2 weeks of vacation), her total work hours for the year are:

Teaching hours = 35 x 50 = 1750 hours
Coaching hours = 15 x 50 = 750 hours
Total work hours = 1750 + 750 = 2500 hours

Since Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as a coach, her annual salary can be calculated as follows:

Annual teaching salary = 20 x 2500 hours = $50,000
Annual coaching salary = 30 x 750 hours = $22,500
Annual total salary = $50,000 + $22,500 = $72,500

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $72,500."

Explanation:
The problem states that there are 10 liters of orange juice and it is in two-thirds water. So, if we add this to 15 liters of pineapple juice (which is three-fifths water), we will have a total of 27 liters of liquid (10 + 15 = 25). However, since the orange juice is not fully dissolved, some of it will remain unmixed with the other juice, resulting in 24 liters of water left over after mixing. Therefore, the amount of water remaining is 24 - 27 = -3 liters."

Explanation:  The total cost of both pairs of shoes is $5 less than the cost of the buts, which means that the cost of each pair of shoes is $5 / 2 = $2.50. Since one pair of obcas costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, the cost of the first pair is $33 + ($2 \* 2) = $47, and the cost of the second pair is $33 + ($2 \* 2) = $47. Therefore, the difference between the two prices is $47 - $41 = $6, which is equal to the price of the buts."

Explanation: According to the passage, John has 13 sets of Legos and sells them for $15 each, resulting in $195 total revenue. He then uses this money to buy eight video games at $20 each, which costs him $160. Therefore, he is left with $35 ($195 - $160). Since he started with 13 sets of Legos, he still has 13 sets after selling them and buying the video games."
Response: 5 km/h
"Response: 40 km
Explanation:
Dana can run four times faster than she walks, so if she runs at a speed of x km/h and walks at a speed of y km/h, then we have:
x = 4y
Since Dana can skakać with a speed of half that of her running speed, we know that her skating speed is also equal to 4 times her walking speed:
x = 4y
Now, let's find out how far Dana can travel in 6 hours:
Time = Distance / Speed
In this case, time is 6 hours, distance is 40 km (since Dana can walk at a rate of 2 km/h), and speed is either x or y depending on whether Dana is running or walking.
We are given that Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking, so the proportion of time spent running is 1/3 and the proportion of time spent walking is 2/3.
Therefore, the total time spent by Dana running is 1/3 \* 6 hours = 2 hours, and the total time spent by Dana walking is 2/3 \* 6 hours = 4 hours.
Substituting these values into the equation for distance traveled, we get:
Distance = Time \* Speed
For running:
Distance = 2 hours \* x km/h = 8 km
For walking:
Distance = 4 hours \* y km/h = 8 km
Since Dana can skate at a speed of half that of her running speed, we know that her skating distance is also equal to half the distance traveled while running:
Skating distance = Half(Running distance) = Half(8 km) = 4 km
Therefore, the total distance traveled by Dana in 6 hours is:
Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance + Skating distance
= 8 km + 8 km + 4 km
= 20 km
So, Dana can travel 20 kilometers in 6 hours."

Explanation:
Polly can throw the golden lance at the dragon from a distance of 400 feet when she has the sapphire. Since the dragon's flames only reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand outside of its range and still hit it with the lance three times farther than when she doesn't have the sapphire. Therefore, if Polly is holding the stone, she can stand 375 feet away from the dragon and continue to hit it with the golden lance."

Explanation:
Tracy used a piece of wire that was 4 feet long to support tomato plants in her garden. The wire was cut into pieces that were 15 cm long. To find out how many pieces she got, we need to divide the length of the wire by the length of each piece. Since there are 3 feet in 1 foot and 12 inches in 1 foot, we can convert the length of the wire from feet to inches as follows:

4 feet = 4 x 12 = 48 inches
Now, let's divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (15 cm):
48 inches / 15 cm = 3
So, Tracy obtained 3 pieces of wire."

"Response:  The maximum number of crates that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 12. To calculate this, we need to divide the total weight of the driver and the empty truck (3755 funtów) by the weight of each crate (5 kg):

Number of crates = Total weight / Weight of each crate
= 3755 / 5
= 751

Since you cannot have a fraction of a crate, round up to the nearest whole number:

Number of crates = 751

Therefore, the maximum number of crates that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 12."

To calculate the cost of presents for the birthday party, we need to multiply the number of guests by the cost per present. Since 1/4 of the guests will not come (i.e., 4 out of 16), we need to adjust the calculation accordingly.

Number of guests who will come = 16 / 4 = 4
Cost of presents = Number of guests x Cost per present = $160

Therefore, the total cost of presents for the birthday party is $160."

Explanation:
To determine how much coleslaw Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total weight of all the adult and child dinosaurs at the picnic. There are 20 adults that each eat 10 funtuns of coleslaw, so their total weight is 20 x 10 = 200 lb. Additionally, there are 5 children who each eat half as much as an adult, so they eat 5 x 5 = 25 lb of coleslaw. Therefore, the total weight of all the dinosaurs at the picnic is 200 + 25 = 225 lb. Since Ted wants to make sure everyone has enough food, he should bring 40 lb of coleslaw to feed them all."

The third friend pressed it 10 times more than the second friend, so they pressed it 90 times (80 x 1.1 = 90). Finally, the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, so the total number of times the friends pressed the doorbell was 48 + 90 + 60 = 278."

Explanation: According to the passage, John drinks one glass of water at breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day, which means he has 3 glasses of water per day (1 x 3 = 3). Additionally, he has one glass of water before bedtime, making it 4 total glasses of water per day (3 + 1 = 4) in a typical weekday. However, during weekends, John likes to relax and have a carbonated beverage with his meals instead of water, so he does not consume any additional glasses of water on weekends. Therefore, John consumes 4 glasses of water per day on average throughout the week."

"Response: 40 gallons
Explanation:
If the local gas station sells gas for $3 per gallon and the company offers $0.20 cashback per gallon, then the total cost of 10 gallons of gas would be $3 x 10 = $30. If the customer receives $0.20 cashback for each gallon, they will receive $0.20 x 10 = $2 in cashback, leaving them with a net cost of $30 - $2 = $28 for 10 gallons of gas. Since the question asks how much gas the customer will have after receiving the cashback, the answer is 40 gallons ($28 / $0.20 = 40)."

"Response: 35.7 liters
Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:
* The distance traveled by the boat was 20 feet (6 meters).
* The time taken to travel this distance was 16 seconds.
* The speed of the boat was 2 feet per second (0.6 meters per second).
From these values, we can calculate the volume of water that flowed into the boat during its journey:
Volume = Distance x Speed x Time
= 6 meters x 0.6 meters/second x 16 seconds
= 96 cubic meters
Now, we know that the boat collected two liters of water for every three meters it traveled. Since the boat traveled 6 meters, it collected 2 x 6 = 12 liters of water.
Therefore, the total amount of water on the boat when it reached the shore was 96 cubic meters - 12 liters = 84 cubic meters.
Finally, since the boat took 64 seconds to reach the shore, and there were 20 feet in each stroke, we can calculate the volume of water on the boat at any given moment using the formula:
Volume = Distance / Strokes per Minute
= 20 feet / 16 strokes/minute
= 1.25 feet^3/stroke
So, the volume of water on the boat at any given moment was 1.25 feet^3/stroke x Number of strokes taken = 84 cubic meters x 1.25 feet^3/stroke
= 101.25 cubic feet
Since there are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, we can convert the volume of water on the boat from cubic feet to gallons as follows:
101.25 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 763.125 gallons
Therefore, the final answer is 763.125 gallons of water were on the boat when it reached the shore."

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:
Telefon Jamala can hold 6 times more pictures than telefon Brittany, which means that telefon Brittany can hold 6/7 = 0.86 (approximately) times as many pictures as telefon Jamala.
The maximum number of pictures that telefon Brittany can hold is 50 times greater than the number of birds in the picture with Jamal and his friends at the zoo, which means that the number of birds in the picture is 50 / 51 = 0.98 (approximately) times as many birds as the total capacity of telefon Brittany.
Therefore, if telefon Jamala can hold 1800 pictures, then the number of birds in the picture with Jamal and his friends at the zoo is approximately 1800 x 0.98 = 1728 birds."

Explanation:
We know that Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, so Adrian's salary was $60,000 ($80,000 - 30%). We also know that Adrian's salary increased by 40% over the past four years, so his current salary is $92,000 ($60,000 x 1.4). Since both Adrian and Lylah had their salaries increase equally, we can assume that Lylah's salary is now $75,000 ($60,000 + 25%). Therefore, the combined salary of Adrian and Lylah four years later is $167,000 ($92,000 + $75,000)."

Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of red gummies is x. Since there are 4 times more red gummies than blue gummies, the number of blue gummies is 4x.
The total number of gummies in the machine is 22, so we can set up the equation:
x + 4x = 22
Simplifying the equation, we get:
5x = 22
Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
x = 4
So, there are 4 red gummies in the machine. Therefore, there are 5 different types of gummies in total (red, blue, green, yellow, and orange)."

John sells milk for $2, eggs for $3, candles for $3, buckets for $3, and birdhouses for $4. If there is a 10% tax on all non-food products, the total cost of everything would be:

Milk x $2 = $2
Eggs x $3 = $3
Candles x $3 = $3
Buckets x $3 = $3
Birdhouses x $4 = $4
Total cost = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $17
Tax on total cost = $17 x 10% = $1.70
So the final cost of everything is $17 + $1.70 = $18.70 or $56 dollars."

Explanation:
Lucas has already three clients and is expecting to get five more. Each client needs two bottles of bleach and one package of cleaning supplies. The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of each package of cleaning supplies is $5. Therefore, Lucas's total weekly expenses will be:
Total Weekly Expenses = Number of Clients x Cost per Client + Number of Potential Clients x Cost per Potential Client
= 3 x $2 + 5 x $5
= $92
Since Lucas expects to earn $92 per week in revenue from his cleaning services, he will have a profit of:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
= $92 - $92
= $0
Therefore, Lucas will not make any profit this week."

Debra observed bees entering and leaving the hive over a period of 12 hours. In the first 6 hours, she saw 30 bees leave the hive and half of them returned within the next 6 hours. Since she saw twice as many bees leaving the hive than when she first left it, there were 60 bees that left the hive in total (30 x 2 = 60). Therefore, 40 bees did not return to the hive (60 - 20 = 40). So, Debra saw 15 bees returning to the hive during the last 6 hours of the day (40 / 2 = 15)."

Explanation:
Steve is 3 miles away from school and can ride his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim is 3 kilometers away from school and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take for Steve to reach school, we need to convert the distance between Steve's house and school from miles to feet. There are 5,280 feet in a mile, so Steve's distance of 3 miles is equal to 3 x 5,280 = 15,720 feet. Now, we can use the speeds given in the problem to find out how long it will take Steve to reach school: Time = Distance / Speed = 15,720 feet / 440 feet/minute = 35.5 minutes. Since Tim starts later than Steve, he will also take 35.5 minutes to reach school."

"Response:  $1875
Explanation:  To calculate how much Jessica will pay in interest over one year, we need to multiply her total debt by the annual percentage rate (APR) and then subtract that amount from her total debt. The APR for each of her loans is as follows: credit card = 18%, student loan = 6%, mortgage = 4%. Therefore, the total interest she will pay over one year is: Credit card = ($300 x 18%) = $5400 Student loan = ($200 x 6%) = $1200 Mortgage = ($500 x 4%) = $200 Total interest = $5400 + $1200 + $200 = $7800 So, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for all of her loans, her monthly payments would be: Credit card = $540 / 12 = $450 per month Student loan = $1200 / 12 = $100 per month Mortgage = $200 / 12 = $17 per month Total monthly payments = $450 + $100 + $17 = $677 per month Over the course of one year, Jessica will have paid a total of: Credit card = $450 x 12 = $5400 Student loan = $100 x 12 = $1200 Mortgage = $17 x 12 = $204 Total payments = $5400 + $1200 + $204 = $7804 So, the difference between the total amount she will pay over one year with the minimum payments versus the amount she will pay if she makes only the minimum payments is: $7804 - $5400 = $2404 This means that by making only the minimum payments on her loans, Jessica will end up paying an additional $2404 in interest over the course of one year compared to what she would pay if she made larger payments."

* Przejażdżki = $33 x 2 = $66

Total cost per friend = $60.75 + $56.25 + $66 = $182.90

Since they agreed to split the costs equally, each friend will pay:

$182.90 / 3 = $60.63

Therefore, each friend will pay $60.63."

Response: 5 kg (or 11 lbs) of mushrooms will not be used. Explanation: To determine how much mushroom will not be used, we need to divide the total amount of mushrooms by the number of restaurants that will receive them. In this case, 200 £ / 40 restaurants = 5 kg (or 11 lbs) of mushrooms per restaurant. Since each restaurant will receive 2 £ of mushrooms, 5 kg - 2 £ = 3 kg (or 6.6 lbs) of mushrooms will remain unused.

Therefore, the total number of pens that Janet has is 32 + 54 + 12 = 38."
Response:  To obtain an average of 93, Brinley needs to achieve a score of at least 95 on the sixth test.  Explanation:  The given information is as follows:  * First five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 (for a total of 446) * Sixth test: unknown score By using the formula for calculating the average, we can determine that the sum of all six test scores is equal to the total number of tests multiplied by the number of students. Therefore, the sum of all six test scores is 446 x 6 = 2696. If Brinley's score on the sixth test is X, then the total score for all six tests is 2696 + X. Since Brinley wants his average to be 93, he must have a score of at least X = 2696 / 93 = 286 on the sixth test.

* The next day (second day), there were 50 more customers than the previous day, so the total number of customers was 150 (100 + 50).
* On the third day, the total number of customers was 500, which means that there were 350 additional customers compared to the second day (500 - 150 = 350).

Therefore, the number of customers who entered the store on the third day was 300 (350 - 50 = 300)."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The number of students in the classroom was 1000.
* 30% of the students left through exit A. (So, 300 students left through exit A.)
* 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B. (So, 600 students left through exit B.)

Explanation:
Griffin had 24 cookies initially.
Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 19 (24 - 5).
Billy took twice as many cookies as Kyle, so he took 10 (2 x 5 = 10).
Ginger gave Griffin some more cookies, but we don't know how many exactly. Let's assume she gave him 6 additional cookies. So now Griffin has 25 (19 + 6) cookies in total.
Colby took 3 fewer cookies than Kyle, which means he took 7 (3 - 5 = 7) cookies from Griffin.
Now, if Griffin had 27 cookies originally, and Colby took 7 cookies, that means Colby left with 27 - 7 = 20 cookies.
So, Ginger gave Griffin 18 cookies (27 - 20 = 18)."
