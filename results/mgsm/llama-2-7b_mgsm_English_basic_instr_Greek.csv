Therefore, the total cost of all the pastries is $784."
Response:  To determine how long it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate its annual income and compare it with the initial investment of $90. Let's do this by using an equation that takes into account the number of lemons produced per year, their selling price, and the annual maintenance cost: Annual Income = Number of Lemons x Selling Price - Maintenance Cost (per year) In this case, the annual income would be: Annual Income = 7 lemons x $1.50 - $3 = $42.50 So, after one year, Carlos will have earned $42.50 from his lemon tree. Now, let's assume that Carlos wants to continue growing the tree for more than one year. We can use the same equation to calculate the time it will take him to reach breakeven point, or when he starts making a profit from the tree: Time to Reach Breakeven Point = Initial Investment / Annual Income To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to reach breakeven point, we can plug in the values we just calculated: Time to Reach Breakeven Point = $90 / $42.50 = 2.1 years Therefore, it will take Carlos approximately 2.1 years to start earning money from his lemon tree, assuming he continues to maintain it annually at a cost of $3 per year.
Response:  To find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she had x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling some there. Then, she sold 2 more to the red house, so she had x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left after that. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she had (x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left after that. Since she now has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 2 = (x/3 - 2)/2 = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 15. So, Melanie started with 15 vacuum cleaners.
Response:  Of the total number of students in the dance class, 37.5% (or 3/6) are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Response:  Jill's annual salary is $14,000 (teacher) + $6,750 (coach) = $20,750.
Response:  Claire will eat 12 eggs (3 x 4) in 4 weeks.
Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles and the time taken so far is 3 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles + 1 hour for the next 2 miles). So, Marissa's average speed needed to complete the remaining distance of 6 miles is: Average Speed = 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles/hour.

"Response:  John's average speed for his weekly 60-mile runs is 10 miles per hour (mph).

Here's how we can calculate it:

Day 1: John runs for 3 hours at a speed of x mph = 3/x mph
Days 2 and 3: John runs for half the time of Day 1, so he runs for 1.5 hours each day at a speed of x mph / 2 = 3x/4 mph

Now, to find John's average speed, we need to add up all these speeds and divide by the total time he spent running:

Total time running = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours
Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 mph

Therefore, John's average speed for his weekly 60-mile runs is 10 mph."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how far Dana can travel in each mode of transportation. We know that Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, so if she runs for x hours, she will travel 4x miles. Similarly, if she walks for y hours, she will travel y/2 miles. Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can write:

x + (2/3)y = 6

Now we need to find the value of x and y that satisfies this equation. Solving for x, we get:

x = 6(1/4) = 3 miles

And solving for y, we get:

y = (6 - 3)/2 = 3 miles

Therefore, Dana can travel 3 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking."
Response:  Brandon's iPhone is eight years old.
"Response:  To determine the maximum distance from which Polly can hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to use the information provided in the problem.  First, we know that the distance between Polly and the dragon is 400 feet when she throws the javelin without holding the gemstone. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than before. Therefore, the maximum distance from which Polly can hit the dragon with the javelin while holding the gemstone is:

3 x (distance without gemstone) = 3 x 400 = 1200 feet

So, Polly can stand up to 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin if she holds the sapphire gemstone."
Response:  The number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 7 (14 - 5 = 7).
"Response:  To determine the number of grams of chips that can be eaten based on the given information, we need to calculate the remaining calories available for consumption after consuming 1800 calories from other sources throughout the day. Let's assume that the person has already consumed 1800 calories from other foods and drinks before eating the bag of chips. Therefore, the total calories consumed so far are:

1800 + (2000 - 250) = 2050 calories

Now, let's subtract the number of calories in the bag of chips (250) from the total calories consumed so far:

2050 - 250 = 1800 calories

So, there are 1800 calories left available for consumption after consuming the bag of chips. Dividing this amount by the number of servings in the bag (5) gives us the number of grams of chips that can be eaten:

1800 / 5 = 360 grams

Therefore, if your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories from other sources, you can safely eat up to 360 grams of chips while staying within your daily calorie goal."
"Response:  Net Profit = Selling Price x Number of Candles Sold - Cost of Supplies

"Response:  To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information provided in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

Day 1 (Monday):
Meredith wrote 5 articles, which means she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours researching and writing on Monday.

Day 2 (Tuesday):
Meredith wrote 2/5 = 0.4 articles more than on Monday. So, she spent 0.4 x 4 = 1.6 hours researching and writing on Tuesday.

Day 3 (Wednesday):
Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 x 1.6 = 3.2 articles on Wednesday. She spent 3.2 x 4 = 12.8 hours researching and writing on Wednesday.

Total hours spent writing articles in the three days = 20 + 1.6 + 12.8 = 34.4 hours.

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 34.4 hours writing articles in the three days."
Response:  To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to subtract the number of Post-it notes she already had (80) from the total number of Post-it notes she used (23 + 220 = 240).

"Response:  The time it takes for Tom to get back depends on the distance he traveled during each leg of his journey.

During the first leg of his journey (from 1 to 4 PM), Tom traveled at a rate of 10 miles per hour, so he covered a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 5 hours = 50 miles

During the second leg of his journey (back to the starting point), Tom traveled at a rate of 6 miles per hour, so he covered a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 6 miles/hour x 3 hours = 18 miles

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled in both legs of his journey is:

Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2 = 50 miles + 18 miles = 68 miles

To find out how long it took Tom to get back, we need to divide the total distance by his speed during the second leg of his journey:

Time = Total Distance / Speed = 68 miles / 6 miles/hour = 11.33 hours

So, it took Tom approximately 11.33 hours to get back."
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so if Uriah removes 30 comic books, they will weigh 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds less. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we need to subtract 7.5 pounds / 1/2 = 15 toys from his book bag. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.
Response:  To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to subtract the total amount earned from repairing truck tires ($60 x 6 = $360) from the total amount earned from repairing car tires ($40 x 12 = $480). Therefore, the difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $360 = $120. So, the mechanic earned $120 more revenue on Friday than on Thursday.

"Response:  To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight limit of the bridge. So, in this case, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:
Maximum number of boxes = Total weight limit of the bridge - Weight of the truck and driver
= 5000 pounds - (3755 pounds)
= 1245 pounds
Therefore, approximately 1245 boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit."

Second half of the year (July - December): Discounted amount = $90 x 10% = $9
Total amount paid = $90 + $9 = $189
Therefore, by the end of the year, Aleena had paid a total of $189 for the streaming service."
"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total amount of gas she has by the distance she has already driven. In this case, Sophia has 12 gallons of gas in her tank, and she has driven 100 miles since last filling her tank. So, if we divide 12 by 100, we get:

12 / 100 = 0.12

This means that Sophia can drive 0.12 x 12 = 1.44 miles on a single tank of gas. Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 1.5 miles on a single tank of gas."

"Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs and then divide it by the number of cups per bag. Let's do that:
Total cups of dog food needed = 1 cup/day x 180 days + 2 cups/day x remaining days = 180 + (365 - 180) = 485 cups
Since there are 110 cups per bag, Cecilia will use:
Number of bags = Total cups / Cups per bag = 485 / 110 = 4.4 bags
So, Cecilia will use approximately 4.4 bags of dog food in the first year."

"Response:  To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we can use the information provided in the problem. We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for all the dinosaurs is:

Adults x 10 lbs = 200 lbs
Children x 50% of 10 lbs = 50 lbs
Total weight of potato salad needed = 250 lbs
So, Ted should bring 250 lbs of potato salad to the picnic to ensure that everyone has enough to eat."

"Response:  If Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and now Gerald's speed has improved by 10%, then we can say that Gerald's new time for running the 400-meter hurdles is:
Gerald's time = Lee's old time + (Lee's old time x 10%)
= 38 seconds + (38 seconds x 10%)
= 41.6 seconds
So, if Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run it in 41.6 seconds."
Response:  Let's assume that the number of pet dogs is x. Since there are twice as many cats as dogs, the number of pet cats is 2x. The total number of pets in the neighborhood is given by x + 2x = 120 (since the number of rabbits is 12 less than the sum of the numbers of dogs and cats). Solving for x, we get x = 40. Therefore, there are 40 dogs and 80 cats in the neighborhood.
Response:  There are 140 girls who are not in the Girl Scouts out of a total of 200 grade 5 students.

"Response:  To calculate the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups they ate by 2. Since Beatrice's was 24 roll-ups long and 2 wide, she ate 48 roll-ups (24 x 2). Similarly, since Marcell's was 14 roll-ups long and 3 wide, he ate 42 roll-ups (14 x 3). Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:

(48 + 42) / 2 = 90

So, on average, Marcell and Beatrice ate 90 fruit roll-ups each."
Response:  To find the amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows back towards shore, and that it takes 64 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the boat will have taken on 2 x 20 = 40 liters of water by the time Julia reaches shore.

Response:  To find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so if Brittany's phone can hold 50 photographs, then Jamal's phone can hold 300 photographs (6 x 50 = 300). Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, this means that he has taken 1500 photographs beyond what Brittany's phone can hold (1800 - 300 = 1500). Therefore, there are 1500 / 6 = 250 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo (since each photograph represents one duck).
"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she sold and then subtract that amount from the total revenue she received. The total cost of the lumber she sold is:

Cost = (Number of boards x Cost per board)
= (10 x $10) + (5 x $16)
= $100 + $80
= $180

The total revenue she received is:

Revenue = Number of boards x Price per board
= 10 x $20
+ 5 x $32

"Response:  Of course! To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles was 2 x 5 = 10.
2. On the second day, more containers arrived, bringing the total number of vehicles to 30.
3. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can conclude that there are 30 / 5 = 6 containers of vehicles on the second day.

Therefore, the answer is 6 containers."

Response:  The total amount of money Dillon will spend for the fruits is: Watermelons x price = $3 x 4 = $12 Peppers x price = $15 x 20 = $300 Oranges x price = $15 x 10 = $150 Total = $300 + $300 + $150 = $750
"Response:  To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to subtract the cost of providing healthcare services (i.e., the amount paid to the doctors) from the revenue generated by those services.

Revenue = Number of patients x Time spent with each patient x Charge per minute
= 500 x 24 x $200
= $480,000 per day

Cost = Number of patients x Time spent with each patient x Cost per minute
= 500 x 24 x $150
= $360,000 per day

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $480,000 - $360,000
= $120,000 per day

So, the hospital makes a daily profit of $120,000 from seeing 500 patients per day, assuming each patient spends an average of 24 minutes being seen by a doctor and paying $200 per minute."

"Response:  To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the number of questions he answered in both tests from the total number of questions in each test.
For the first test, Mark answered 75/5 = 15 questions per hour. So, he completed the test in 8 hours (since there are 8 times as many hours as questions). Therefore, he left 75 - 120 = 45 questions incomplete.
For the second test, Mark answered 100/5 = 20 questions per hour. So, he completed the test in 6 hours (again, since there are 6 times as many hours as questions). Therefore, he left 100 - 40 = 60 questions incomplete.
So, Mark left 45 + 60 = 105 questions incomplete in total."

Response:  The total cost of the items John bought is: $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15. Since there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, the tax amount is: $15 x 0.10 = $1.50. So, the final cost of everything to John is: $15 + $1.50 = $16.50.
Response:  To calculate the profit that Lucas will make each week, we first need to find out his total income for the week. His total income per week is $92 (3 clients x $27 per client). Next, we subtract his total expenses from his total income to find his profit. His total expenses are $10 (2 bottles of bleach x $2 each + 5 packs of cloths x $5 each), so his profit per week is $82 ($92 - $10). Therefore, Lucas will make $82 in profit each week.
"Response:  John can harvest 1000 pineapples within a year.

Here's how you can calculate the answer:

* Number of pineapples per hectare = 100
* Total number of hectares = 10 (John has 10 hectares)
* Total number of pineapples = Number of pineapples per hectare x Total number of hectares
= 100 x 10
= 1000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 1000 pineapples within a year."

"Response:  The number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day can be calculated as follows:

At first, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Half of these bees (i.e., 15 bees) return to the hive in the next 6 hours.
Then, twice as many bees as Debra initially saw leave the hive (i.e., 2 x 30 = 60 bees) fly away and don't return.
Finally, all of the bees that had left the hive but not yet returned (i.e., the initial 30 bees plus the additional 60 bees) come back to the hive in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the total number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees."
Response:  £8
Response:  James has 48 Facebook friends.
Response:  To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Where: * Distance = 3 miles (for Steve) or 2 miles (for Tim) * Speed = 440 ft/min (for Steve) or 264 ft/min (for Tim) Now let's plug in the values we know into the formula: For Steve: Time = 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 6.8 minutes For Tim: Time = 2 miles / 264 ft/min = 7.5 minutes So, if Steve starts the race first, it will take him 6.8 minutes to reach his house after leaving the school. If Tim starts the race second, it will take him 7.5 minutes to reach his house after leaving the school. Therefore, the winner will wait for 7.5 - 6.8 = 0.75 minutes at their house before the loser finishes the race.

Response:  To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to multiply the number of days he has classes by the length of each class. So, for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, he has 3 x 1 hour = 3 hours of classes per day. For Tuesday and Thursday, he has 2 x 2 hours = 4 hours of classes per day. Therefore, in total, Kimo spends 3 + 4 = 7 hours per day attending classes. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 7 hours/day x 16 weeks = 112 hours attending classes per semester.
Response:  The total length of all the baked goods put end to end would be: Rolls = 300 x 4 = 1200 inches Croissants = 120 x 6 = 720 inches Baguettes = 60 x 2 = 120 inches Total length = 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches Which is equal to approximately 16.8 feet.
"Response:  To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo over that period. We can do this by multiplying the number of bananas each species needs per month by the number of months they will be receiving food (i.e., 2).

Total number of bananas needed = Number of bananas needed per month x Number of months
= 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper receives an entire shipment of bananas every 2 months, he needs to order enough bananas to last for those 2 months. Therefore, he needs to order 700 / 2 = 350 bananas per shipment."
Response:  The winner (Blake) ran a total distance of 100 yards x 15 = 1500 yards. The loser (Kelly) ran a total distance of 40 yards + 40 yards = 80 yards. Therefore, the winner ran 1500 - 80 = 1420 yards more than the loser.

"Response:  To find the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them up.
The cost of the doll is $3 (since it costs as much as 3 action figures), and the cost of each red car is $4. Therefore, the cost of the 5 red cars is $20 ($4 x 5).
The cost of the 3 action figures is $15 ($5 x 3).
So, the total value of all the toys is $35 ($20 + $15)."
Response:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of the accountant from the value of the extra time she would gain by doing her taxes herself. In this case, that means subtracting $90 (the cost of the accountant) from $65 ($35/hour x 3 hours). So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $25 more than if she did her taxes herself.
Response:  To calculate how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of all the accessories from her budget. Her budget is €1500, and the total cost of all the accessories is €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423. So, Elvira will have €1500 - €1423 = €77 left over for her clothing.

"Response:  To find out how much each uniform costs in total, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Hat: $25
2. Jacket: 3x$25 = $75
3. Pants: ($25 + $75)/2 = $48.50

So, each uniform costs: $25 (for the hat) + $75 (for the jacket) + $48.50 (for the pants) = $148.50

Therefore, each uniform costs $148.50 in total."

"Response:  To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum for each of her debts, we need to first find the total minimum payments for each debt per month. For the student loan, it's $300/month; for the credit card, it's $200/month; and for the mortgage, it's $500/month. Then, we multiply each of these amounts by 12 to get the annual minimum payment for that debt. So, the total annual minimum payments are: Student Loan = $300 x 12 = $3600 Credit Card = $200 x 12 = $2400 Mortgage = $500 x 12 = $6000 Next, we subtract the total annual minimum payments from the total amount Jessica wants to pay each year to determine how much extra she can pay above the minimums. In this case, Jessica wants to pay $7200/year (50% more than the minimum). So, the difference between what Jessica wants to pay and the total annual minimum payments is: $7200 - ($3600 + $2400 + $6000) = $800 Therefore, Jessica pays $800 more than the minimum payment each year."
"Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to use multiplication. If it takes him about a minute and a half to peel each potato (1.5 minutes), and only about 5 seconds to cut them up, then it will take him:

60 potatoes x 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes total time to peel and cut
So, it will take Billy approximately 90 minutes to prepare all 60 potatoes for his family reunion barbecue."
Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to subtract the amount of money they made from the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade. So, if they made $25 in profit, that means they sold 25 x 20 = 500 glasses of lemonade. Since each glass costs $0.50, the total cost of making one gallon is: $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5 per gallon. Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $5 x 500 = $2500 on lemons.
Response:  There are not enough facts given in the problem to determine the number of girls on the Chinese team. The information provided states that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team, but does not provide any information about the number of girls.

Response:  After all the expenses and donations, Zaid will have $5,800 left ($6,000 - (1/4 x $1,200) - (1/3 x $1,000) - (half of $1,200) - $200 - $700 = $5,800).
"Response:  The total number of crabs the three have together is 120. Here's how we can calculate it:
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 50 + 10 = 60 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Bo has 40 crabs.
So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 60 + 36 + 40 = 120 crabs."

Response:  To solve this problem we need to find the total time it takes for all four runners on both teams to complete their legs of the relay race.  For Team A, since they are well-rounded, each member will take exactly 55 seconds to complete their leg, so the total time taken by Team A is:  Time = (Number of Runners) x (Time per Runner) = 4 x 55 = 220 seconds.  Now, let's find out the total time taken by Team B. Since their first runner runs in 60 seconds, the second runner needs to run in 55 - 60 = -5 seconds faster than the first runner. So, the time taken by the second runner is 55 seconds. Similarly, the third runner needs to run 5 seconds faster than the second runner, so their time is 59 seconds. And finally, the fourth runner needs to run 4 seconds faster than the third runner, so their time is 63 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken by Team B is: Time = (Number of Runners) x (Time per Runner) = 4 x (55 + 5 + 59 + 63) = 281 seconds.  Hence, Team A wins by 61 seconds (220 - 281).
Response:  The probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on the die is 5/6 or approximately 83.3%. To calculate the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling another even number on the second roll. This can be done by multiplying the probabilities of each event occurring separately: P(rolling an even number on the first roll) = 4/6 = 2/3 P(rolling an even number on the second roll | rolling an even number on the first roll) = 1/2 Since these events are independent, we can multiply them together to get the overall probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = P(rolling an even number on the first roll) × P(rolling an even number on the second roll | rolling an even number on the first roll) = 2/3 × 1/2 = 4/9 or approximately 44.4% Therefore, the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row is about 44.4%, which is less than the probability of him rolling a number greater than 3 (83.3%).
Response:  Jenna picked 10 apples and her mother picked 20 apples, so together they picked 30 apples.
"Response:  Let's assume that there are x rats in each cage. Since there are 3 cages and each cage has an equal number of rats, we can write:
x = 3x
Now, let's consider the total number of rats:
Number of rats = Number of cages x Number of rats per cage
= 3x
Since there are 10 cages of hamsters, the total number of hamsters is:
Number of hamsters = 10 x 5 = 50
And since there are 20 pens of rabbits, the total number of rabbits is:
Number of rabbits = 20 x 1 = 20
So, if 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, we can calculate the number of pieces of straw for each type of animal as follows:
Rats: 3x = 90 (since each cage has 3 rats)
Hamsters: 50
Rabbits: 20
Therefore, the answer to the question is:
x = 3 (the number of rats in each cage)"

Response:  To calculate the daily amount of insects needed for a flock of ten ducks, we can use the following formula: Daily Insect Needs = Weekly Insect Needs / Number of Days in a Week x Number of Ducks. Plugging in the values given in the problem (3.5 pounds of insects per week and 7 days in a week), we get: Daily Insect Needs = 3.5 pounds/week x 7 days/week x 10 ducks = 24.5 pounds of insects per day. Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs to eat approximately 24.5 pounds of insects per day to survive.
"Response:  Tom has 40 trees left after 10 years.

The explanation is as follows:

Tom starts with 50 trees, which means he has 50 x 10 = 500 trees in total over 10 years.

Every year, Tom chooses to plant 10 new trees, so he adds 10 x 10 = 100 new trees to his original stock, bringing the total number of trees to 500 + 100 = 600 trees.

However, every year Tom also chooses to chop down 2 trees, which reduces his total number of trees by 2 x 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, after 10 years, Tom's total number of trees will be 600 - 20 = 580 trees.

Since 30% of the trees die each year, after 10 years, 30% of 580 = 174 trees will have died, leaving Tom with 580 - 174 = 406 trees.

Therefore, Tom has 406 trees left after 10 years."
Response:  The number of pink plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday is 36 - 18 = 18 more than the number of white plastic flamingos. Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 18 + 18 = 36 pink plastic flamingos out compared to the 18 white plastic flamingos.

Response:  Elaine currently has 140 Pokémon cards.
Response:  To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first find out how many cents he earns from Publisher A and then add the amount he earns from Publisher B. Since Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, and he edits 500 sentences for them, he earns 500 x 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A. Similarly, since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays him 2 x 2500 = 5000 cents. Therefore, Mark makes a total of 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents in a week.
Response:  Every day, Baldur gets 5 x 12 = 60 liters of water in the morning and 6 x 6 = 36 liters of water in the afternoon, for a total of 96 liters of water per day.

Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and doing chores. Let's start by calculating the amount of money Sara will make from babysitting: 4 x $5 = $20. Now let's add this to the $10 she already has: $10 + $20 = $30. So now Sara has $30 in total. Next, let's calculate the cost of the jacket and shoes: $30 / $20 (the cost of one pair of shoes) = 1.5 pairs of shoes or 1 jacket. Since Sara cannot buy half a pair of shoes, she needs to buy 2 pairs of shoes. Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn $\boxed{3}$ times to afford the jacket and shoes.
Response:  Jerry has 16 red chickens.
Response:  Gary will spend 2 hours walking around the edge of the park if he walks at 3 miles per hour.
Response:  To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to use the information given in the problem. On the first day, there were 100 customers, and on the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so there were 150 customers (100 + 50) on the second day. On the third day, there were 50 more customers than the second day, so there were 200 customers (150 + 50) on the third day. Therefore, Sloane counted 200 customers on the third day.

Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle. For the crossword puzzles, it took her 10 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 10 x 3 = 30 minutes solving crossword puzzles. For the sudoku puzzles, it took her 5 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 5 x 8 = 40 minutes solving sudoku puzzles. Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

Response:  To find out how long it will take for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to know how many pieces are in the puzzle and how fast they can work together. Let's assume that there are 360 pieces in the puzzle. If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, then she can finish 4 x 360 = 1440 pieces per hour. Since her mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom can place 1440 / 2 = 720 pieces per hour. Therefore, it will take them 1440 / 720 = 2 hours to complete the puzzle.
Response:  After two weeks, there were 80 baby watermelons left on the farm (since 70% of the original 120 melons were already harvested). So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 40 (120 - 80 = 40).
Response:  To calculate the total cost of the cars, we need to add up all the costs involved in purchasing and registering them. The total cost can be calculated as follows: Total Cost = Price of Cars x Tax Rate + Registration Fee per Car x Number of Cars Total Cost = $20,000 x 10% + $1000 x 12 = $24,000 + $12,000 = $36,000 Therefore, Mark pays a total of $36,000 for the fleet of 12 cars.

"Response:  To determine the number of vines needed for Steve to grow enough cherry tomatoes to eat 6 per day, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes that one vine can produce in a week. Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the total number of tomatoes that one vine can produce is:

3 tomatoes/week x 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

Since Steve wants to eat 6 tomatoes per day, he will need:

21 tomatoes/week / 6 tomatoes/day = 3.5 weeks

Therefore, Steve needs approximately 3.5 weeks worth of vines to grow enough cherry tomatoes to eat 6 per day."
Response:  John needs to order 5 pizzas.
Response:  To find out how many total pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the number of pens he will be able to make using the mixed ink. Since each pen contains 1/5 of the ink, if he mixes 5 pens together, he will have 5 x 1/5 = 1 full pen. So, if he uses 25 pens to make new ones, he will get to have 25 + 1 = 26 pens in total.
Response:  After a year, Johnny had $30 + $10 = $40.
Response:  The sum of the ages of the three girls is 53 years (Mary's age + Joan's age - Jessa's age).
Response:  Of course! Here's the solution to the problem: Let's start by analyzing the information given in the question: * Initially, there were 1000 students in the school hall. * After the meeting, 30% of the students left through exit A. So, the number of students who left through exit A = 30% x 1000 = 300 students. * Next, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B. So, the number of students who left through exit B = (3/5) x (900 - 300) = 420 students. * Finally, the rest of the students left through exit C. So, the number of students who left through exit C = (1000 - 300 - 420) = 280 students. Therefore, the total number of students who left the building through all three exits is: Total = 300 + 420 + 280 = 900 students. So, the number of students who left through exit C is 280 / 900 = 311 students.
Response:  John has 32 more candies than James.
Response:  By the end of the activity, Dolly and Pandora will have read a total of 3 books between them.
"Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to know the number of letters he receives and sends per week. Let's assume he receives 3 letters per week from the remaining 3 pen pals and sends 2 letters per week in response. Therefore, the total number of letters he writes per week is:

3 letters received x 2 letters written = 6 letters/week

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Mike to write one letter:

Time to write one letter = Number of letters written / Time taken to write one letter
= 6 letters/week / 1 page/letter = 6 pages/week

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the time it takes him to write one page is:

Time to write one page = 6 minutes/page

Therefore, the total time Mike spends writing letters per week is:

Total time spent writing letters/week = Number of letters written x Time taken to write one letter
= 6 letters/week x 6 minutes/page = 36 minutes/week

So, Mike spends approximately 36 minutes per week writing letters to his pen pals."
Response:  If Jason has used 300 extra minutes of calls this month, that means he has used a total of 300 + 1000 = 1300 minutes. Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason has 1300 / 30 = 43 minutes left for the rest of the month.
Response:  The answer is 8.
Response:  Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can write: 2x = 4 - 32. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So there are 8 fish in the first aquarium and 0 fish in the second aquarium (since there are no fish).
Response:  To calculate how much Jean paid, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of hours per day and then multiply that result by the cost per hour. So, for example, if it took 6 hours per day x 4 days per week = 24 hours/week, and 24 hours/week x $250/hour = $5,000/week. Since the movie lasted for 5 weeks, Jean paid a total of $5,000 x 5 weeks = $25,000. Then, after the movie was finished, the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, so Jean paid $25,000 - (10% of $25,000) = $23,750.
Response:  Each person paid $70 / 3 = $23.33.
Response:  The chef spent a total of $600 ($1.50 x 4 bags = $600).
"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to first find out how many cookies Sue ate in total. We can do this by adding up the number of cookies she ate on each day:
Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.
Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 46 x 200 = 9,200 calories.
So, Sue consumed 9,200 - 780 (the number of calories her sister ate) = 8,420 more calories than her sister."
