"Response:  We have:
Pato = 16 (ze pa)
Janet = 0 (yo mete)
Meten = 4 (chak maten)
Kat = 3 (fè gato)
Zannimo = 5 (pou zanmi)
Fre = 2 (la nan mache)
Dola = 10 (kiltivatè)
Now we can calculate:
Pato x Janet = 16 x 0 = 0
Meten x Kat = 4 x 3 = 12
Zannimo x Fre = 5 x 2 = 10
So the total amount of money that Janet will receive is:
12 + 10 = 22 dollars."
Response:  The number of bolts in one row is 5, and there are 10 rows in total. So, the total number of bolts is 5 x 10 = 50.
"Response:  The cost of repairs is $50,000 and the value of the car after repairs is $80,000. So, we have:
Value before repairs = $80,000
Cost of repairs = $50,000
Profit = Value after repairs - Cost of repairs
= $80,000 - $50,000
= $30,000
So, the profit made by Josh is $30,000."
Response:  We know that James ran three sprints of 30 meters each and then walked back for a total distance of 60 meters. So, in total, he covered a distance of 90 meters (3 x 30 = 90).
"Response:  We have to find out how many chickens Wendi has in total and then calculate how many she will get after 20 days. So let's start with the information given in the question:
Chak jou ( initial number of chickens): 30
Wendi gives away 15 chickens.
After giving away 15 chickens, Wendi has 30 - 15 = 15 chickens left.
Now, Wendi gives away another 25 chickens.
So, after giving away 25 chickens, Wendi has 15 - 25 = -10 chickens left.
Therefore, after 20 days, Wendi will have -10 + 20 = 10 chickens."
Response:  We know that $Kylar$ wants to buy 16 threads and he has $5 dolars$. If we calculate the price of one thread with the discount of 60%, then it will cost him $\$2 \times (1 - 0.6) = \$1.4$. So, he needs to pay $\$5 + \$1.4 = \$6.4$ for all the 16 threads.
Response:  The number of sheep in Toulouse is 4, and each sheep produces 3 lambs. So, there are 12 lambs (4 x 3 = 12) in Toulouse. Now, let's move to Charleston where there are 5 shepherds who have 6 sheep each. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Charleston is 5 x 6 = 30 sheep. And each sheep in Charleston gives birth to 2 lambs, so there are 30 x 2 = 60 lambs in Charleston. Finally, in Seattle, there are 8 shepherds with 7 sheep each, resulting in a total of 56 sheep (8 x 7 = 56). Each sheep in Seattle gives birth to 2 lambs, so there are 56 x 2 = 112 lambs in Seattle. Thus, the final answer is: Toulouse - 12 lambs, Charleston - 60 lambs, and Seattle - 112 lambs.
Response:  The time taken to transfer 200 GB of data is given as 40% of the downloading speed, which means that the speed at which the data is being transferred is 60 MB/minute (200 GB / 0.4 = 60 MB/min). Now, we are asked how much time it would take for Carla to perform this task. Since she can handle 2 GB per minute, it will take her approximately 33 minutes and 20 seconds to complete the task (200 GB / 2 GB/min = 33 minutes and 20 seconds). Therefore, the answer is 33 minutes and 20 seconds.
Response:  The car traveling at $30 \text{ mph}$ passes a point in $4$ seconds, and then it takes $2$ minutes to reach the next point where it is observed that there are $4$ cars traveling at $80 \text{ mph}$. So, the distance traveled by the car in $4$ seconds is $\frac {4 \times 52 \text{ ft}} {1 \text{ min}} = 208 \text{ ft}$. Now, we need to find out how far the car has traveled in total during this time period. Therefore, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed of the car is $30 \text{ mph}$, and the time taken to cover the distance is $2 \text{ min} = 2 \times 60 \text{ s} = 120 \text{ s}$. So, the total distance traveled by the car is: Distance = $30 \text{ mph} \times 120 \text{ s} = 3600 \text{ ft}$.
Response:  If Eliza works for 40 hours per week and her hourly wage is $10, then she earns $400 per week. If we subtract the simple tax of $12 from that amount, she will have $388 left after paying taxes. So if she works 45 extra hours in one week, she will earn an additional $67 (($388 x 45) / 40). Therefore, her total earnings for that week would be $455 ($400 + $67).
"Response:  We have to calculate how many times the program was downloaded in the first month and then multiply it with the percentage of reduction. So, we can write:
Total number of downloads = Number of downloads in the first month x Percentage of reduction
= 60 x (1 - 0.3)
= 40
Therefore, the program generated 40 downloads in the first month after the optimization."
Response:  We have three large donuts that cost $68 for three, two mini cats that cost $80 for two, and six mini cheesecakes that cost $55 each. So we need to calculate the total price of all these items together. The total number of items is 3 + 2 + 6 = 11. Therefore, the total price will be $68 x 3 + $80 x 2 + $55 x 6 = $497.
Response:  We have to find out how many small plants (7) are needed for one big plant ($1.5 per small plant). So we need 7 x $1.5 = $10.50 for one big plant. If it costs $3 to make one small plant, then the total cost of making all the small plants is $3 x 7 = $21. Therefore, the total cost of making all the plants is $10.50 + $21 = $31.50.
Response:  If Melanie has 5 aspirations and she wants to achieve them all in her life, then she will have to work hard for each of those aspirations. She needs to set specific goals for herself and make sure that she is taking steps towards achieving them every day. For example, if one of her aspirations is to become fluent in French, she could start by listening to French music or watching French movies every day. By doing so, she will be able to improve her language skills gradually over time. Similarly, if another aspiration is to travel around the world, she could start saving money by working extra hours or cutting back on unnecessary expenses. With determination and consistent effort, Melanie can achieve any of her aspirations within a given time frame.
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 100 (yon = 100). Of these, 20% are in class 2 (klas = 20), which means there are 20 students in this class. Now, 25% of the students in this class are interested in dance (dans = 25), so there are 5 students (25 x 20 / 100) who are interested in dance. Similarly, 20% of the remaining 70 students are interested in music (djaz = 14), and 25% of them are interested in hip-hop (hip-hop = 3). Therefore, the final answer is 5 + 14 + 3 = 22 students who are interested in hip-hop.
"Response:  If we want to maximize profit from selling jewelry and electronics, we need to find the optimal price for each product that will give us the highest profit margin. We can use the following formulas to calculate this:
Profit Margin = (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price
For jewelry, let's assume the cost is $5,000 and the selling price is $8,000, so the profit margin would be:
Profit Margin = ($8,000 - $5,000) / $8,000 = 2.5%
For electronics, let's assume the cost is $8,000 and the selling price is $6,000, so the profit margin would be:
Profit Margin = ($6,000 - $8,000) / $6,000 = 1.2%
Now, if we want to maximize our overall profit, we should choose the product with the higher profit margin. In this case, it's jewelry, since its profit margin is 2.5%, while electronics has a profit margin of only 1.2%. So, if Komèsan wants to maximize their profits, they should sell jewelry at a price closer to $8,000 rather than $6,000."
Response:  The distance from San Rafael to Menm Tan is approximately 32 km (according to Google Maps). If we travel in the direction of Menm Tan for 80 km, then the total distance traveled will be 80 + 32 = 112 km. Therefore, the distance covered by the train is 112 km.
Response:  We know that Jill has to pay $20 for cheerleading and she also needs $30 for equipment. If it takes 50 weeks of training, then we can calculate how much each week costs. So, the total cost per week is $20 + $30 = $50. Now, if there are 35 students who are taking part in the training, then each student will have to pay $50 / 35 = $1.43 per week. And if there are 15 students who are training to be coaches, then each coach will have to pay $50 / 15 = $3.33 per week.
Response:  If Claire has 3 eggs and she makes one omelette with each egg, then she will have made 3 omelettes in total. Now, if she wants to share one of these omelettes equally among 4 people, she will have 3 omelettes left for herself after sharing one. So, the number of omelettes that Claire can eat is 3.
Response:  The distance traveled by the car is 12 km and it takes 1 hour to cover this distance at a speed of 40 km/h. Therefore, in one hour, the car will have covered a distance of 12 / 40 = 300 meters. Now, if we want to find out how many times the car can travel this distance in an hour, we divide the total distance traveled by the distance covered per hour: 12 km / 300 m = 40 trips. So, the car can make 40 trips of 12 km each in one hour.
Response:  We have 10 liters of water and we want to add 15 liters of banana juice. So, in total, we will have 10 + 15 = 25 liters of liquid. Now, if we divide this amount by two (since there are two people), we get 25 / 2 = 12.5 liters per person. Since each person gets half of the liquid, the final answer is 12.5 liters.
Response:  We know that Raymond is 6 years younger than Samantha. So, if Samantha is 31 years old, then Raymond is 25 years old (6 x 31 = 156).
"Response:  We know that there are 8 clues in total and we have already found 3 of them. So, if we want to find out how many days it would take for Billy to get his DVD back, we can calculate as follows:

Number of days = Total number of clues / Number of clues found so far
= 8 / 3
= 2.67 days (approximately)
Therefore, Billy will get his DVD back after approximately 2.67 days."
Response:  The first candle is lit at 8 am and will burn for 4 hours (until 12 pm). So there are 6 hours between the first and second candles. Then, the second candle is lit at 1 pm and will burn for 3 hours until 4 pm. Therefore, there are 9 hours between the two candles.
"Response:  The original price of the item is $19.50 and there is a discount of 25%. To find out how much the discounted price will be, we can multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
Discounted Price = Original Price x Discount Percentage
= $19.50 x 25%
= $4.875
So, the discounted price of the item is $4.875."
Response:  We know that Marie has to pay for 1 lb of meat which costs $12 (in Anglais). She also needs to buy 5 pieces of lettuce which cost $3 each. Additionally, she wants to buy 4 tomatoes which cost $1.50 each. Finally, she buys some bread which costs $0.50 per piece. To calculate the total amount Marie needs to pay, we can multiply the number of items she bought with their prices: Total = $12 x 1 + $3 x 5 + $1.50 x 4 + $0.50 x n Where n is the number of bread pieces Marie bought. Since Marie bought 4 bread pieces, we have: Total = $12 x 1 + $3 x 5 + $1.50 x 4 + $0.50 x 4 = $8.50 So, the answer is $8.50.
Response:  The cost of three pairs of pants is $16.50 x 3 = $49.50. The cost of three shirts is $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. So, in total, Mishka will have to pay $49.50 + $67.50 = $117 for all four items.
"Response:  We know that Cynthia has 20 boxes of cream cheese and she wants to sell them at $4 each. So, we can calculate how many dollars she will make from selling all her cream cheese:

$ Number of boxes x Price per box = Total amount earned
20 boxes x $4 per box = $80

Now, let's find out how much money Cynthia will have after selling 60 jars of cream cheese:

$ Total amount earned / Number of jars sold = Amount left after selling
$80 / 60 jars = $1.33

So, after selling 60 jars of cream cheese, Cynthia will have $1.33 left."
Response:  We know that Henry has cycled for 60 miles and then stopped to rest after covering 20 more miles. So he has covered a total distance of 80 miles (60 + 20). Now we are asked how many miles he will cover in the remaining 15 miles before reaching his destination. To find this out, we can divide the remaining distance (15 miles) by the speed at which he is traveling (which was given as 30 miles per hour). Therefore, Henry will cover 15 / 30 = 5 miles in the remaining distance before reaching his destination.
Response:  If there are 33 lots of 10 eggs each in a basket, and we take out one egg from each lot, then we have taken out 33 x 10 = 330 eggs. So, the number of eggs left in the basket is 330 - 33 = 297 eggs.
Response:  If Darrel is 7 years old and Allen is 10 years older than him, then Allen is 16 years old.
Response:  We have to find out how many jelly beans are in one bowl and then multiply it with the number of bowls. So we can calculate the total amount of jelly beans. The question says there are 80 bowls, so let's start with that. One bowl contains 20 pieces of jelly beans, so we have 80/20 = 4 bowls per group. Now we need to calculate the percentage of jelly beans that are left over after each group is divided into two equal parts. For example, if we divide 4 bowls into two groups of 2 bowls each, we will have 4/2 = 2 jelly beans left over from the first group. Therefore, the percentage of jelly beans left over after dividing the first group into two equal parts is 2/4 x 100 = 50%. Similarly, we can calculate the percentage of jelly beans left over after dividing each subsequent group into two equal parts. After dividing all 80 bowls into 20 equal parts, we will have 80/20 = 4 groups of 20 jelly beans each. Therefore, the final percentage of jelly beans left over is (20/4) x 100 = 50%. So, there are 50% of the original amount of jelly beans left over after dividing all 80 bowls into 20 equal parts.
Response:  The question is asking about how many businesses in Cap-Haitien have closed due to the pandemic. We know that there are 10 centers of commerce (chen) in Cap-Haitien and 5% of them have closed (chak chen). So, we can calculate the number of closed businesses as follows: Number of closed businesses = Total number of businesses x Percentage of closed businesses Total number of businesses = 10 centers of commerce x 5% closure rate = 0.5 or 50% Number of closed businesses = 50% of 10 = 5 businesses Therefore, based on the calculation, it is estimated that 5 businesses in Cap-Haitien have closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 pies and she gives 30 of them to her friend. So, how many pies does Gretchen have left? Gretchen has 80 pies left (110 - 30 = 80).
Response:  We know that Siobhan has 2 bijoux from Aaron and she gave one to Raymond. So, Siobhan now has 1 bijou left. Since Aaron had 5 bijous, he gave 4 of them to Raymond, so Aaron now has 1 bijou left. Therefore, the number of bijous Siobhan has after giving one to Raymond is 1 + (Aaron's remaining bijous) = 1 + 4 = 5.
Response:  The time taken to complete each level is 40 minutes and there are 20 premium levels. So in 20 minutes, he completed 4 puzzles.

Response:  If Terry buys 2 yogurt for J$10 each, then he pays a total of J$20. Now if there are 4 yogurts at J$5 each, Terry pays a total of J$20 + (4 x J$5) = J$28. So, the change given to Terry is J$8 - J$28 = -J$20. Therefore, there are 30 yogurts in the box.
Response:  The total cost of all 13 Legos is $15 x 13 = $195. Then, he bought 8 more Legos for $20 x 8 = $160. So, in total, Konbyen spent $195 + $160 = $355.
Response:  We know that John has $60 million in savings and he is 60 years old. He also has 3 children who are 18 years old each. So, we can calculate how much money John will have after his children inherit from him. After 30 years (when all of them turn 90), John will have $27 million left ($60 million x 0.5 = $30 million) since half of it will be inherited by his children. Therefore, John's net worth at age 90 is $27 million.
Response:  We have to find out how many meters are in one kilometer and then convert it into centimeters. A kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, so we can say that there are 1000 x 3 = 3000 meters in three kilometers. Now, we need to convert this value from meters to centimeters. There are 100 centimeters in one meter, so we can say that there are 3000 x 100 = 300,000 centimeters in three kilometers. Therefore, the answer is 300,000 centimeters.
Response:  If iPhone Suzy has generation 1 and can give away a large prize to iPhone Ben, then we need to calculate how many generations are between them. Since iPhone Suzy is in Generation 1 and iPhone Ben is not specified, let's assume that iPhone Ben is also in Generation 1. Therefore, there is only one generation difference between them. So, the number of years between them is 1 year.
Response:  We know that the distance between Farbo and the dragon is 1000 pyramids (p). The dragon can throw its javelin at a speed of x p per second. If we want to calculate how long it takes for the javelin to reach Farbo, we need to use the formula: time = distance / speed. So, in this case, the time would be: time = 1000 p / x p/s = 1000/x seconds. Now, let's assume that after 400 seconds (or 6.67 minutes), the javelin has reached Farbo. At this point, if Polly wants to hit the dragon with another javelin, he needs to do so within 200 seconds (or 3.33 minutes) after the first javelin has arrived. This means that Polly must launch his second javelin at a speed of at least 2x p/s, where x is the initial speed of the first javelin. Therefore, if the initial speed of the first javelin is 50 p/s, then Polly must launch his second javelin at a speed of at least 100 p/s (2x50=100 p/s).
Response:  If Granmét Jones gives you 5 pieces of pompano to eat at noon, and each piece weighs approximately 200 grams (based on the average weight of a pompano), then in total you will have 5 x 200 = 1000 grams of pompano to eat. Now, if you divide this amount by 8 (the number of people invited), you get 1000 / 8 = 125 grams per person. So, each person will receive approximately 125 grams of pompano to eat.
Response:  If Nitrogen has 250 calories per serving and there are 300 grams of it in 5 servings, then each serving contains 250/3 = 83.3 calories. Now, if we consume 2000 calories overall and have already consumed 1800 calories, that means we still have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left to consume. So, the remaining amount of calories we can eat is 200 / 5 = 40 calories per serving. Therefore, we can safely consume an additional 40 calories per serving without exceeding our daily calorie goal of 2000 calories.
"Response:  We have to calculate how many candles can fit in one box of beeswax and then multiply it with the price per candle to get the total cost.

Box of Beeswax: The question states that there are 10 boxes of beeswax, each containing 5 pounds of beeswax. So, we have:

Number of Boxes = 10
Weight of Each Box = 5 pounds (or 2.26 kg)
Total Weight of All Boxes = 10 x 5 pounds = 50 pounds (or 22.68 kg)

Now, let's find out how many candles can fit in one box of beeswax:

Candles per Box = Total weight of beeswax / Weight of one candle
= 50 pounds / 2.26 pounds (or 1 kg)
= approximately 22 candles per box

So, if Li has 20 chandels, he will need 4 boxes of beeswax (20 / 22 = 4). Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the candles:

Cost of One Candle = Price per candle x Number of Candles
= $2.00 x 20 candles
= $40.00

Since Li needs 4 boxes of beeswax, the total cost of all his candles will be:

Total Cost = Number of Boxes x Cost of One Candle
= 4 boxes x $40.00
= $160.00

Therefore, the answer is $160.00."
Response:  The blog has 100 readers who read an article every day. If each reader spends 3 minutes reading the article and there are 7 days in a week, then the total time spent reading articles is: (100 readers x 3 minutes per reader x 7 days) = 2100 minutes. Now, let's calculate the number of articles read per day: (2100 minutes / 7 days) = 300 articles per day. So, the total number of articles read in one year is: (365 days / year) x (300 articles per day) = 109,500 articles per year.
Response:  We know that Candice has 80 sticky notes in her bag and she gives half of them to her friend at the cafe. So, she gives 40 sticky notes to her friend. Now, we need to find out how many sticky notes are left with Candice after giving them to her friend. Since she gave away 40 sticky notes, there are now 40 - 40 = 0 sticky notes left with Candice. Therefore, the number of sticky notes that Candice gets back is 0.
"Response:  The cost of one piece of cloth is $40, and Jan bought 10 pieces of cloth. So, the total cost of the cloth she bought is:

$40 x 10 = $400

Now, let's find out how much percentage of the total cost of the cloth she paid for. We know that 50% of the total cost of the cloth was paid by her, so we can calculate it as follows:

$400 / 2 = $200

So, Jan paid $200 for the cloth."
"Response:  The length of the potato is given as 4 pye (pye = cubit) long, and we are asked to find out how many times it can be cut into pieces that are 6 pous (pou = palm) long. So, if we divide the length of the potato by 6, we get:

4 pye / 6 pous = 0.67 pye per pou

Therefore, the number of times the potato can be cut into pieces that are 6 pous long is:

0.67 pye per pou x 4 pye = 2.68 pyes

So, there are approximately 2.68 pyes of potato in the original piece."
Response:  The building has 15 floors and Richard is on floor 8 of it. He can see 3/4 of the building from his current position. So, if we calculate the area of the part he can see, it will be: Area = (3/4) x (15 - 8) = 90 square meters.
Response:  We know that Lloyd is asking for $2 to buy something from him. If he sells it for $2 per item and has 252 items, then his total earnings would be $2 x 252 = $504. So, Lloyd has $504 in his pocket.
Response:  We know that Batou has traveled 10 miles in 2 hours (from 1 to 4 pm). Therefore, his average speed is 6 mph. To find out how far he will travel in one hour, we can multiply his average speed by the number of hours he will be traveling: 6 mph x 1 hour = 6 miles per hour. So, in one hour, Batou will cover 6 miles.
Response:  If Sak lives for 75 years (twice his age), he will have retired at the age of 15 + 75 = 90 years old. Since he has worked for half of his life, he has worked for 45 years (half of 90). So, if he retires at the age of 90 and works for 45 years before that, he will have earned $30 \times 45 = 1350$ dollars in total during his working life. Therefore, the correct answer is $1350$.
Response:  The mechanic fixed 6 cars and 4 machines. So in total he fixed 10 things (6 cars + 4 machines). On Friday, he fixed 12 machines. Therefore, the number of things the mechanic touched that day is 12 + 10 = 22.

Response:  Jean has 30 lollipops and gives 2 to his friend. So he has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. Now, Jean wants to share 2 more lollipops with his friend. So, he will have 28 - 2 = 26 lollipops left after sharing them. Therefore, Jean has 26 lollipops left in total.
Response:  If we buy one ticket for $7 and get free popcorn with it, then the total cost of one ticket is $7 + $7 = $14. So if we want to know how much money we will have left after buying four tickets, we can subtract $14 from $42, which gives us $28. Therefore, we will have $28 left after buying four tickets to the movie.
"Response:  We have to find out how much money is left after buying 5000 liv (livres) of books at 15 Liv per book and then combining them with 3755 Liv from another source. So we need to calculate as follows:

Money left = Total amount of money - Amount spent on books
= 5000 Liv + 3755 Liv - 15 x 5000 Liv
= 8250 Liv - 7500 Liv
= 750 Liv
Therefore, there are 750 Liv left after buying 5000 Liv of books and combining them with 3755 Liv from another source."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the cost of the book that Stephen bought. The original price was $40.00, and there was a 25% discount given, so the new price would be: $40.00 x (1 - 0.25) = $30.00. Then, Stephen added $4.00 as a tip, bringing the total cost to $34.00. Finally, the seller added an extra $2.00 for the delivery fee, making the final price $36.00. So, the amount that Stephen paid for the book is $36.00.
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of Raspberry Gen 6 are in 20 fruit watermelons and then multiply it with 67% of the endive gelatin content. So, first we need to calculate the weight of 1 watermelon. A typical watermelon weighs around 3-4 kg (kilograms). Therefore, the weight of 20 watermelons would be 20 x 3 = 60 kg. Now, let's assume that each watermelon contains approximately 800 grams of Raspberry Gen 6. This is just an estimate as there may vary depending on various factors such as size, variety, ripeness, etc. So, the total weight of Raspberry Gen 6 in 20 watermelons would be 60 kg x 800 grams/watermelon = 48,000 grams or 48 kilograms. Finally, if we multiply this value by 67%, we get the approximate amount of endive gelatin required for making Konbyen Framboz. So, the answer is 48,000 grams / 0.67 = 71,529 grams or 71.5 kilograms of endive gelatin needed to make Konbyen Framboz using Raspberry Gen 6.
"Response:  The question is asking about how many days it takes for an egg to hatch after laying. If we assume that the egg lays at a rate of 25 eggs per day and each egg takes 1 second to hatch, then the total time taken for all eggs to hatch would be:

Time = Number of Eggs x Time per Egg / Total Number of Seconds
= 25 x 1/60 + 2 x (1/60)²

Response:  The service cost is $140 per month and there is a 10% discount for early payment. So, if we calculate the total amount paid over 6 months, it would be: Total Amount = Service Cost x Number of Months - Discount (%) x Number of Months Total Amount = $140 x 6 - ($14 x 6) Total Amount = $840 - $84 Total Amount = $756
Response:  We know that the distance between Sophia and Machicolles is 100 km. If we travel at a speed of 60 km/h (which is the average speed of a car), it will take us approximately 1 hour to cover this distance. Therefore, if we want to fill up our gas tank with 12 gallons of fuel, we need to stop for refueling after driving for about 1 hour. So, the number of kilometers traveled before stopping for refueling is equal to 100 km - 1 hour = 99 km. Now, let's calculate how much fuel we can buy based on the price per liter given in the problem: Price per liter = $3.50/liter Fuel capacity = 12 gallons = 45 liters (since there are approximately 3.785 liters in a US gallon) Total cost = Price per liter x Fuel capacity = $3.50/liter x 45 liters = $157.50 Therefore, the amount of money spent on fuel during the trip from Sophia to Machicolles is $157.50.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Jim passed in front of the TV and then divide it by 5 because he had 3 feet long legs. So, if Jim passed 2 times in front of the TV, that means he walked for 2 x 3 = 6 feet. Now we need to divide this number by 5 since each foot is equal to 12 inches, so 6 feet / 5 = 1.2 feet per second.
Response:  The school has 10 teams in basketball competition and each team consists of 7 players. Therefore, there are 7 x 10 = 70 students who participate in the competition. Additionally, there is one coach for every 5 teams, so there are 5/7 = 3 coaches in total.
Response:  We have 175 days in total (35 weeks x 5 days/week). Each week has 24 hours, so we have 175 x 24 = 4080 hours in total. Now, let's calculate how many minutes there are in that amount of time: 4080 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 244,800 minutes. Finally, to convert it to seconds, divide by 60 again: 244,800 minutes / 60 = 40,784,000 seconds.
Response:  If there are 60 students in total and 5 of them are eligible to compete for the prize, then we can calculate the number of competitors as follows: Number of competitors = Total number of students x Percentage of eligible students Number of competitors = 60 x 5/100 = 30 So, there will be 30 competitors in total.
"Response:  If Bailey has to pay $5 for each of the first 8 semesters and then $100 for the last semester, we can calculate the total amount he needs as follows:

= $108
Therefore, Bailey needs $108 to complete his studies."
"Response:  We know that Judy has been teaching for 5 classes in the morning and 3 classes in the afternoon. So, she teaches a total of 8 classes per day. If each class generates $15.00 for her, then we can calculate how much money she earns per day as follows:

Total number of classes taught per day = 5 + 3 = 8
Total amount earned per day = Total number of classes taught per day x Average income per class = 8 x $15.00 = $120.00
So, Judy earns $120.00 per day."
Response:  We have to prepare 20 portions of food for 10 people. So we need 2 times more ingredients than usual. Therefore, we will need 40 ingredients in total (2 x 10 = 20).
Response:  If Tommy sold each brownie for $3 and each cheesecake for $4, he would have earned a total of $3 x 43 = $132 from selling brownies and $4 x 23 = $92 from selling cheesecakes, in total $224. So Tommy raised $224 for charity.
Response:  The cost of one phone is $150 and there are three phones. So, the total cost would be $150 x 3 = $450. If we apply a 2% discount, then we can calculate it as follows: Discount amount = Total cost x Discount percentage (in this case, 2%) = $450 x 2% = $9 Discount amount = $9 Now, let's find out how much Sheila will pay for each phone: Cost price after discount = Total cost - Discount amount ($450 - $9) = $441 per phone Therefore, Sheila will pay $441 per phone.
Response:  If Artie buys 12 marigolds for $2.74 each, that means he spends $32.08 (12 x $2.74). For petunias, if he buys 9 plants for $1.87 each, then he spends $16.53 ($1.87 x 9). And for begonias, if he buys 17 plants for $2.12 each, then he spends $35.34 ($2.12 x 17). So in total, Artie spends $73.95.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 4 goes into 16. So we divide 16 by 4 and get 4 with a remainder of 2. Therefore, there are 4 complete sets of 4 numbers in the pattern plus 2 extra numbers that repeat after the last set, for a total of 8 numbers in the pattern.
"Response:  If Cecilia buys one new dog and pays $150 for its food, then she will have to pay $180 for the first month (since there are 30 days in April). Therefore, if she has 110 bags of dog food left over from last year, she can use them to feed her new dog for three months (April, May, and June) without having to buy any more food. So, the number of bags of dog food that Cecilia can use is:

$ \text {Number of bags of dog food = Number of days in the period during which the food can be used} $

$ \text {Number of days in the period = Total number of days in the three months minus the number of days in April} $

$ \text {Total number of days in the three months = 90 days (May + June)} $

$ \text {Number of days in April = 30 days} $

So, we can calculate the number of bags of dog food that Cecilia can use as follows:

$ \text {Number of bags of dog food = 90 days - 30 days} $

$ \text {Number of bags of dog food = 60 bags} $

Therefore, Cecilia can use 60 bags of dog food to feed her new dog for three months without having to buy any more food."
Response:  If Raymonf has $100 in his pocket and he gives $5 to Sarah, then Sarah has $95. Now, if Sarah has $95 and she gives $4 to David, then David has $91. So, the difference between what Raymonf has and what David has is $91 - $95 = -$4. Therefore, the answer is -$4.
Response:  If he bought 18 eggs at $2.50 each and then sold them for $1 each, how much money did he make in total? To calculate this, we need to subtract the cost of the eggs from the revenue generated by selling them. So, the calculation would be as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Eggs x Selling Price Total Cost = Number of Eggs x Purchasing Price Subtracting the total cost from the total revenue gives us the profit made: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost In this case, if he bought 18 eggs at $2.50 each and sold them for $1 each, his profit would be: Profit = 18 x $2.50 - $1 = $6.50 Therefore, he made a profit of $6.50 by selling the 18 eggs.
Response:  The groomer offers a discount of 30% for the new client. If the original price was $100, then the discounted price would be $70 ($100 x 30%). So, the total cost to the client would be $80 ($70 + $10).

Response:  We know that Charlie has 10 stickers and he bought 21 more stickers from the same store. So, in total, Charlie has 31 stickers (10 + 21). Now, we are asked how many stickers Charlie will have after he uses 28 of them to decorate his cat's collar. To find out, we need to subtract the number of stickers Charlie used (28) from the total number of stickers he had (31): 31 - 28 = 3. Therefore, Charlie has 3 stickers left after using 28 to decorate his cat's collar.
Response:  The weight of Alex is 2 lives (or 2 x 50 = 100 kg). Now, Grace weighs 40 kilograms. So, if they are together, their total weight would be 100 + 40 = 140 kg. Therefore, the weight of one life is 140 / 2 = 70 kg.
Response:  We have three pyebwas (Dan) and each of them has 25 roses. So, in total, we have 3 x 25 = 75 roses. Now, one rose is equal to 0.16 kg, so the total weight of all the roses is 75 x 0.16 = 12 kg. Therefore, the answer is 12 kg.

Response:  We have to find out how many times Greg can see the sun in one day. The sun rises once every 24 hours, so Greg can see the sun 6 times per day (1/24). Now we need to calculate how long it takes for Greg to see the sun 100 times. If he sees the sun 6 times per day and there are 24 hours in a day, then it will take him 16 days to see the sun 100 times (100 / 6 = 16). So, the answer is 16 days.

Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds, then he covers 400 meters in 38/100 = 4 meters per second. Therefore, if Gerald changes his running technique and increases his speed by 20%, he will be able to cover 400 meters in 38 + (20% of 38) = 38 + 7.6 = 45.6 seconds. So, Gerald will be able to cover 400 meters in 45.6 seconds.
Response:  We have 40 cents for each of the two friends and we want to know how much money they will have in total if they share it equally among themselves. So, the total amount of money that the two friends will have is: 40 cents x 2 = 80 cents.
"Response:  We are given that 2/5 of the class is in the school yard and 2/3 of them are playing outside. So, we can write:

Number of students in the schoolyard = 2/5 x 100 = 40

Now, let's find out how many students are playing outside:

Number of students playing outside = Number of students in the schoolyard x 2/3 = 40 x 2/3 = 60

So, there are 60 students playing outside in the schoolyard."
Response:  We know that Harry has 9 eggs and James has 2/3 of them. So, if we multiply 2/3 with 9, we get 6. Therefore, Harry gave 6 eggs to James.
Response:  We have 400 grams of tomato sauce (Freda) that we want to divide into two portions of equal size. Each portion should contain 16 ounces or 450 grams of sauce. So, if we divide 400 grams of tomato sauce equally between two portions, each portion will contain 225 grams of sauce. Therefore, the amount of tomato sauce left over after dividing it into two portions is 175 grams (400 - 225 = 175).
Response:  If there are 20 machines working for every 15 minutes they work, that means in one hour (60 minutes) they will work for 4 hours (20 x 60 = 1200 minutes). So if you have 30 machines and each machine works for 15 minutes, then in one hour they will work for 30 x 15 = 450 minutes. Therefore, if it takes 15 minutes to pass through the bottleneck, it will take 450 / 15 = 30 minutes for all the machines to pass through the bottleneck.
Response:  If Mari has 18 new plants to plant in her garden and she already has 2 plants in pots with 40 feet of space between them, then she will have enough space for 6 more plants (2 x 3 = 6). So, the number of plants that Mari can plant in her garden is 6 + 2 = 8.
Response:  We know that Jerome can sing for 4 minutes and 30 seconds (4 x 30 = 120). If he sings at a rate of 1 song per 15 seconds (since there are 60 seconds in a minute), then he will be able to sing 120 / 15 = 8 songs. So if Katrine can sing for 10 minutes and 40 seconds (10 x 40 = 400), she will be able to sing 400 / 15 = 26 songs.
Response:  We have 4 people who are able to speak French (pou li), and among them, 20% can also speak Haitian Creole (sosyal li). So, we have 4 x 20% = 0.8 people who can speak both languages. Then, we have 7 people who can speak only one of these two languages (istwa li) and 8 people who cannot speak either language (jewografi li). Therefore, the total number of people who can speak at least one of these two languages is 0.8 + 7 = 7.8. Finally, if we consider that there are 15 people in total, then the percentage of people who can speak at least one of these two languages is 7.8 / 15 = 0.52 or approximately 52%.
"Response:  We have:
John has 5 apples and gives 3 to his friend. He then buys 2 oranges from the market and shares them equally among 4 people. Finally, he keeps 1 apple for himself. So, how many apples does John have left?

Oranges bought = 2
People shared with = 4
Apple kept by John = 1
Therefore, John has 1 apple left."
"Response:  The distance from point A to point B is 3 miles and it takes 10 minutes to cover that distance. If we assume that the speed of the car is constant throughout the journey, then the average speed of the car can be calculated as follows:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken
= 3 miles / 10 minutes
= 0.3 miles/minute
Now, let's calculate the time taken for the car to reach point C:
Time Required = Distance between Point B and Point C
= 42 miles - 3 miles (distance already covered)
= 39 miles
Therefore, the time taken for the car to reach point C will be:
Time Required = 39 miles / 0.3 miles/minute
= 130 minutes
So, the car will take approximately 130 minutes to reach point C after covering a distance of 3 miles from point A."
Response:  If we have 1000 mosquitoes and each one can lay 10 eggs per day, then in one day we will have 1000 x 10 = 10,000 new mosquitoes. So in one week (7 days), we will have 10,000 x 7 = 70,000 new mosquitoes. In one month (30 days), we will have 70,000 x 30 = 210,000 new mosquitoes. Therefore, in one year (365 days), we will have 210,000 x 365 = 74,700,000 new mosquitoes.
Response:  If Cody has two pieces of candy and gives one to Amir, then Cody has one piece of candy left. If Amir has five biscuits and shares them equally among his friends, he will have 1 biscuit per friend. So, if there are 3 friends in total, Amir will have 3 biscuits.
Response:  The first bat (John) has 3 balls in his hand, and he throws them one by one. So, after throwing the first ball, he has 2 balls left. After throwing the second ball, he has 1 ball left. And after throwing the third ball, he doesn't have any more balls. Therefore, the total number of balls that John threw is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
Response:  On Monday (Mèkredi), we watched one episode of a TV show for 30 minutes. Therefore, if we watch seven episodes in total, and each episode is 30 minutes long, then we will have watched a total of 210 minutes (7 x 30) of television on Friday (Vandredi).
Response:  We know that Henry made 15 more buns than he had at first. So if he started with x buns, then he has 15 + x = 110 buns now. Therefore, x = 95.
"Response:  If you buy 10 gallons of gas at an average price of $3.00 per gallon and get $0.20 cash back for each gallon, then your total savings would be:

$3.00 x 10 = $30.00 (for the 10 gallons of gas)
-$0.20 x 10 = $2.00 (cash back)
Total cost = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00
So, after buying 10 gallons of gas, you will have saved $28.00."
Response:  If we have 50 apples and want to divide them equally among 4 people, each person will get 12 apples (50/4 = 12). Now let's say we want to give 3 of those apples to Beatrice, so now there are 12 - 3 = 9 apples left for the other 3 people. Each of them will get 9 / 3 = 3 apples. Therefore, the final answer is 3 apples per person.
Response:  We know that in 10 seconds, Julia can make 20 pies. So, she will need 200 seconds (or 3 minutes and 20 seconds) to make all 100 pies. Now, let's calculate how long it takes her to make each pie. Since she makes 20 pies per 10 seconds, she will take 64 seconds (or 1 minute and 6 seconds) to make one pie. Therefore, the number of pies Julia can make in one hour is: 100/64 = 1.57 pies per hour.
Response:  If there are 4 professions and each profession has 2 lessons to learn, then in total, there will be 8 lessons (4 x 2 = 8). Now, if we divide this number by 3, as the question asks us to do, we get 2 lessons per profession (8 / 3 = 2). So, there will be 2 lessons for each of the 4 professions.
Response:  If Ryan has 2 flies and gives one to Jaden after 15 minutes, then he will have 3 flies left (Ryan - 1 = 3). After another 5 hours, he will have 8 flies (3 x 2 = 6), so the answer is 8.
Response:  If Jamal has 6 photos and each photo contains 50 likes, then he has a total of 300 likes (6 x 50 = 300). Now, if Brittany has 1800 photos and each photo receives an average of 20 likes, then she has a total of 36,000 likes (1800 x 20 = 36,000). Therefore, the difference between the number of likes that Jamal and Brittany have is 34,700 (36,000 - 300). So, the answer to the question is 34,700.
"Response:  The first table has 2 rows and 4 columns, so it contains 8 cells in total (2 x 4 = 8). Each cell has an area of $10 square feet, so the total area of the first table is:

$10 x 8 = $80

Now let's move to the second table, which has 4 rows and 4 columns, so it also contains 8 cells in total (4 x 4 = 16). Again, each cell has an area of $10 square feet, so the total area of the second table is:

$10 x 16 = $160

If Sasha buys both tables, she will pay a total of:

$80 + $160 = $240

So if Sasha wants to buy both tables without any discount, she will have to pay $240."
"Response:  We are given that Katy has $120 to spend at the coffee shop and she wants to buy something that costs at least $7. So, we can calculate the maximum amount of money she can spend per item as follows:

Therefore, the maximum number of items Katy can buy is:
$120 / $17 = 7 (items)"
Response:  Jan bought 2 pairs of shoes for $30 each. Therefore, she paid a total of $60. So, Konbyen owes her $60.
Response:  We have to find out how many containers can fit in a row with a length of 10 meters (clearance between containers is 2 meters). To do this, we need to divide the total length of the container line by the distance between each container. In this case, there are 5 containers that can be placed end-to-end, so we multiply the number of containers by their length to get the total length of the line: 5 x 10 = 50 meters. Therefore, there are 50 meters of containers along the shore.
Response:  If Adrien touches 30 push-ups and gets a prize of $40, then he will get $120 for completing all 50 push-ups (since each additional push-up is worth $4). So, Adrien's total reward would be $160 ($120 from the first 30 push-ups + $40 from the remaining 20 push-ups).
Response:  If we have 2 bags of rice and each bag contains 5 kg of rice, then in total, we have 10 kg of rice (2 x 5 kg = 10 kg). Now, if we want to divide this amount equally among 30 people, each person will get 0.33 kg of rice (10 kg / 30 people = 0.33 kg).
Response:  We have to calculate how many pomegranates Morisette can get from each tree and then multiply it with the number of trees she has. So, if Morisette can get 5 pomegranates per tree, and she has 8 trees, then she will get 5 x 8 = 40 pomegranates in total.
Response:  We have 8 eggs and we want to make 2 dozen eggs. So, we will need 2 x 12 = 24 eggs in total. Since each egg is worth $0.50, then the total cost of all the eggs will be 24 x $0.50 = $12.
Response:  We have 10 miles for 3 people, which is equal to 30 miles. Then we subtract 5 miles from it, so we are left with 25 miles. Finally, if we divide 25 miles by 7 people, we get approximately 3.56 miles per person. Therefore, the answer is 3.56 miles.
Response:  If we have 60 apples and we give away 15 of them to someone else, then we will have 45 apples left (60 - 15 = 45). Now, if we divide these remaining apples into two equal parts, each part will contain 22.5 apples (45 / 2 = 22.5). So, Jennie will receive 22.5 apples from us.
Response:  If we want to make 12 new pairs of shoes with the same design as the old ones but made from recycled plastic, and if each pair requires 5 new plastic bags, then we need 60 new plastic bags in total (12 pairs x 5 bags per pair). So, Julia will have to buy 60 new plastic bags.
Response:  We have to calculate how many pieces of chicken and sausage Dylan bought in total. For the chicken, he bought 38 pieces, and for the sausage, he bought 6 more pieces than the number of chicken pieces. So, we can write it as follows: Total = 38 + (6 - 38) = 38 + (-29) = 67 pieces of meat. Therefore, Dylan bought 67 pieces of meat in total.
Response:  If Amy has 20 friends at the new school and each friend of hers gives $50 to Lily, then in total, Lily will receive $1000 from Amy's friends. So, the answer is $1000.
Response:  We have to calculate how many melons and watermelons are in each bag of fruit. For example, if we buy 4 bags of melons, there will be 4 x 3 = 12 melons in all. Similarly, for watermelons, there will be 4 x 2 = 8 watermelons in all. Now let's move on to calculating the number of oranges. If we buy 20 oranges, then there will be 20 oranges in all. Finally, let's count the number of apples. There will be 10 apples in all. So, the total quantity of fruit is: Melons = 12 Watermelons = 8 Oranges = 20 Apples = 10 Total Quantity = 12 + 8 + 20 + 10 = 50
"Response:  The doctor charges $150 for each visit to the hospital and he visits 500 people in 24 minutes. So, the total amount of money the doctor earns from these visits is:
$150 x 500 = $75,000
Now, let's calculate how much profit the doctor makes after paying the hospital fee:
$75,000 - $200 x 500 = $62,500
So, the doctor profits $62,500 from these visits."

Response:  The amount of money that Joseph has is $500. If he gives $60 to his friend, then Joseph will have $440 left ($500 - $60 = $440). So, the total amount of money that Joseph has after giving $60 to his friend is $440 + $60 = $500.
"Response:  If we have to decide which two of four mountains to climb in order to reach Fred's location, and if we want to take into account the distance between each mountain and Fred's position, then we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the shortest distance from each mountain to Fred's location.

Let M1, M2, M3, and M4 be the four mountains, and let F be Fred's location. We know that the distance between M1 and F is 2 km, the distance between M2 and F is 4 km, the distance between M3 and F is 5 km, and the distance between M4 and F is 6 km.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the shortest distance from each mountain to Fred's location as follows:

For M1: d = sqrt(2^2 + 0^2) = 2 km
For M2: d = sqrt(4^2 + 0^2) = 8 km
For M3: d = sqrt(5^2 + 0^2) = 10 km
For M4: d = sqrt(6^2 + 0^2) = 12 km

Now, we need to find out which two mountains are closest to Fred's location. In this case, M1 and M2 are the closest ones, with distances of 8 km and 10 km respectively. Therefore, we should choose M1 and M2 for our route."
"Response:  We know that Lendi walked for 4 miles and then took a break. After his break, he continued walking and covered another distance of 6 more miles. So, in total, Lendi walked for 4 + 6 = 10 miles. Now, we need to find out how many kilometers Lendi walked in total. Since there are 1.60934 kilometers in a mile, we can convert the distance Lendi walked as follows: 

Distance = Total distance / Number of miles
= 10 miles x 1.60934 km/mile
= 16.0934 kilometers
So, the distance from Lendi's starting point to the place where he took a break is approximately 16.0934 kilometers."

Response:  If Brian has 20 videos and he gives 5 to his friend Bobby, then Bobby will have 5/5 of what Brian had which is equal to 1 video. So, Bobby will have 1 video.
"Response:  The word ""unicorn"" has 9 letters. There are 3 words in the phrase ""Gen 27 unicorns"". Therefore, there are 9 x 3 = 27 unicorns. Now, let's count how many times the letter ""k"" appears in the phrase ""Rete nan Mond Lan"": it appears once. So, we have 27 unicorns and one ""k"", which gives us a total of 28 elements in the phrase. Finally, let's count how many times the letter ""y"" appears in the phrase ""Yon Tyè Nan Yo Se Nan Highlands Scottish Yo"": it appears twice. So, we have 28 elements + 2 = 30 elements in the phrase."
"Response:  The total cost of the meal is:
$7.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $9.00
If there is a 20% tip, the total cost will be:
$9.00 x 1.20 = $10.80"
Response:  If we have 75 keys to complete a puzzle and each key can unlock 5 locks, then we need 75 x 5 = 375 locks to complete the puzzle. Now, if we have 100 keys and we want to know how many locks we will have when we finish the puzzle with 8 extra keys left over, then we can calculate it as follows: 100 - 375 = -275 locks. So, there are -275 locks remaining after finishing the puzzle with 8 extra keys.
Response:  We have 22 balls of different colors and we want to know how many red balls there are among them. If we take 12 balls from the total of 22 balls, then the number of red balls in the remaining 10 balls is equal to the number of red balls in the initial 22 balls minus the number of red balls taken (12). So, if there were x red balls in the initial 22 balls, then there would be x - 12 red balls in the remaining 10 balls. Therefore, the number of red balls among the 10 balls is x - 12.
"Response:  The first option is ""Nan"" which means nothing or zero in Haitian Creole. So we can eliminate that option immediately. Option 2 has 20 machines available for maintenance, and option 3 has 12 machines that are automatically maintained. Option 4 has 4 machines with manual maintenance, while option 5 has 6 machines with semi-automatic maintenance. Therefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is (D) 6 machines with semi-automatic maintenance."
Response:  The number of years that a person can live without drinking milk is 700 years. If they start consuming milk at age 25 and stop at age 95, then from age 96 to 165 (their remaining lifespan), they will not consume any milk. Therefore, the total number of years they lived without consuming milk is 165 - 96 = 69 years.
Response:  If Jordan touches 10 dollars for each child he has, and he has 2 children, then he will have touched $20 (10 x 2 = 20).
Response:  If John bought something for 2 dollars, he paid 3 dollars for it, and another thing for 3 dollars, then he spent a total of 6 dollars (3 + 3 = 6). If he spent 6 dollars on things that cost 3 dollars each, then he spent a total of 18 dollars (6 x 3 = 18). And if he spent 18 dollars on things that cost 4 dollars each, then he spent a total of 72 dollars (18 x 4 = 72). So, if there is a 10% tax on everything he bought, then he will pay $7.20 in taxes ($72 x 10%).
"Response:  We have to calculate how much money each customer spent and then find out the difference between the total revenue and the total deposit. So we can determine if there is any profit or loss for the business. Here are some calculations based on the information provided in the question:
Total Revenue = Number of Customers x Average Spending per Customer Total Depens = Deposits + Withdrawals
Let's assume that the number of customers who made purchases was 10 (not including the 5 customers who withdrew money). And let's assume that the average spending per customer was $20 (based on the information provided in the question). Therefore, the total revenue would be:
Total Revenue = 10 customers x $20 avg spend/customer = $200
Now, let's check the deposits and withdrawals:
Deposits = $50 (from the 5 customers who deposited money) + $30 (from the other 5 customers who did not make purchases but had money in their accounts) = $80
Withdrawals = $40 (from the 5 customers who withdrew money) + $20 (from the other 5 customers who did not make purchases but had money in their accounts) = $60
So, the total depense would be:
Total Depens = Deposits + Withdrawals = $80 + $60 = $140
Now, let's compare the total revenue and total depense:
Profit/Loss = Total Revenue - Total Depens Profit/Loss = $200 - $140 = $60
Therefore, the business made a profit of $60."
Response:  We have 10 apples and we want to know how many apples John can buy with $3. So, if John wants to buy one apple, he will need $3 / 1 = $3 per apple. Therefore, if John wants to buy 100 apples, he will need $3 x 100 = $300.
Response:  If Johnny has 500 blocks of Lego and he wants to make a square with sides that are 3 times as long as the height of each block (i.e., 3h), then the area of the square will be 3h x 3h = 9h^2. Since the height of each block is h, we can write this as A = 9h^2. Now, if Johnny wants to divide the square into smaller squares so that each small square has an area of 1/4 the original square (i.e., A = 1/4A), then we need to find out what fraction of the original square each small square represents. To do this, we can divide the area of the small square by the area of the original square: 1/4A / 9h^2 = 16h^2 / 9h^2 = 1 1/9. So, Johnny needs 11 small squares to cover the entire surface of the original square.
Response:  We have to find out how many days it takes for Debra to complete 30 miles when she walks at a rate of 2 miles per hour. Firstly, we need to convert the distance from miles to hours. There are 1609.34 meters in a mile, so 30 miles is equal to 30 x 1609.34 = 4827.52 hours. Now, we know that Debra walks at a rate of 2 miles per hour, which means she covers 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet per hour. To find out how long it takes her to cover 30 miles, we divide the total distance by her walking speed: 4827.52 hours / 10560 feet/hour = 46.1 hours. Therefore, it will take Debra approximately 46.1 hours to walk 30 miles.
Response:  If Brittany has $12 for adults and $10 for children, she will have $8 left after buying something for both adults and children. So, if she reserved $8 for the children, she will have $4 left ($12 - $8 = $4).
Response:  If Charlie has 10 friends on Facebook and he adds two more friends, then Charlie now has 12 friends on Facebook. So, James has 4 fewer friends than Charlie on Facebook.
Response:  We know that Steve took 3 miles to reach the school and he walked at a rate of 440 feet per minute. Therefore, it would take him 15 minutes to walk to the school (3 miles / 440 ft/min = 15 min). Now, we need to find out how long it would take Tim to ride his bike to the school. Since Tim rode his bike at a speed of 2 kilometers per hour, it would take him 10 minutes to reach the school (2 km/h x 10 min = 20 min). Finally, if Tim started riding his bike when Steve was already at the school, then Tim would arrive after Steve had been there for 15 minutes (20 min - 15 min = 5 min). So, Tim would arrive at the school in 5 minutes.
Response:  If Shawnda decides to inflate all of her tires at once, she will need $25 for each tire. Since there are five tires in total, she will need $125 for them all. Now, if three people come to help her inflate the tires, they will each be able to inflate one tire, so they will need $25 each. Therefore, the final amount that Shawnda needs to pay is $125 + ($25 x 3) = $175.
Response:  We know that Carl bought this pack of biscuits for $0.10. If we assume that each biscuit costs $0.10, then the total cost of all the biscuits in the pack is $0.10 x number of biscuits = $0.10 x 10 = $1.00. So, if Carl paid $10 for the whole thing, he got $10 - $1.00 = $9.00 worth of biscuits.
"Response:  If we assume that each French fry costs $1 (which is not necessarily true), then the total cost of the package would be:

$1 x 20 = $20 for 20 French fries

So, if Dave bought the whole package and ate all 20 French fries, he would have spent $20 in total. However, since he only ate half of them (10 French fries), his share of the cost would be:

$20 / 2 = $10

Therefore, the amount that Dave paid for his share of the French fries was $10."
Response:  In Lendi and Mekredi, there are two classes of students - one for elementary school (Klas 1-4) and another for high school (Klas 5-9). At Jedi, there is only one class for elementary school (Klas 1-4), while at Vandredi, there are two classes for high school (Klas 5-7 and 8-10). Therefore, in total, there are 16 classes in all four schools combined. Now, let's calculate how many students are in each class at Kimo. Since Kimo has two classes for high school (Klas 5-7 and 8-10), we can assume that there are twice as many students in these classes compared to the other schools. So, if there are x students in each class at Kimo, then there would be 2x students in total across both classes.
Response:  If Bill has 300 tamarinds and he gives 120 to his friend, then he has 180 left (300 - 120 = 180). If he also has 60 bananas and he gives 4 to his friend, then he has 56 bananas left (60 - 4 = 56). And if he has 4 pounds of bread and he gives 6 pounds to his friend, then he has 0 pounds of bread left (4 - 6 = 0). So in total, Bill has 180 + 56 + 0 = 236 things left after giving everything away.
"Response:  The zoo has 5 animals (giraffes, monkeys, elephants, crocodiles, and baboons). Each animal can eat between 2 to 4 meals per day, depending on its size. So we have:
Giraffe: 2 meals/day x 5 giraffes = 10 meals/day
Monkey: 3 meals/day x 5 monkeys = 15 meals/day
Elephant: 4 meals/day x 3 elephants = 12 meals/day
Crocodile: 2 meals/day x 2 crocodiles = 4 meals/day
Baboon: 2 meals/day x 4 baboons = 8 meals/day
Total daily meals: 10 + 15 + 12 + 4 + 8 = 69 meals/day
Now, let's calculate how many meals each animal will eat in one week:
7 days x 69 meals/day = 473 meals/week
So, if there are 200 animals in the zoo, they will eat approximately 473 x 200 = 94,600 meals per week."
Response:  We know that Blake covered 15 minutes and ran 100 meters. So he covered a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters in those 15 minutes. Now we need to find out how far Kelly ran during those same 15 minutes. According to the problem, Kelly ran for 40 meters more than Blake, so she ran a total distance of 1500 + 40 = 1540 meters. Therefore, the distance between Blake and Kelly after 15 minutes is 1540 - 1500 = 40 meters.
Response:  Raphael bought 4 bags of rice for $1.5 each, 2 bags of sugar for $4 each, and a box of matches for $20. So in total, Raphael spent $1.5 + $4 + $20 = $37.
Response:  If Finn has 11 cows and he gives 3 to his friend Lily, then he will have 8 cows left. Then if he buys 2 more cows from Lily, he will have 10 cows in total. So the correct answer is 10.
Response:  The tank has 5 meters of water in it at Landi. Then, we add 7 more meters to make it 12 meters deep. On Monday (Mekredi), the water level is lower than before. So, the depth of the water in the tank on Monday is less than 12 meters. Therefore, the answer is 10 meters (12 - x) where x represents the difference between the original and current water levels.
Response:  We know that Anakin has 10 zebras, 6 chevaux, and 3 clown fish. If we subtract 5 zebras from Anakin, he will have 5 zebras left. Then if we add 3 chevaux to Anakin, he will have 8 chevaux in total. Finally, if we add 2 plis of clown fish to Anakin, he will have 5 clown fish in total. So the final number of animals that Anakin has is 5 zebras + 8 chevaux + 5 clown fish = 18 animals.
Response:  If you buy something for $20 and get a discount of 20%, then the original price was $25 (20% of $20). So, after the discount, you will pay $18 ($25 x 20%). Now, if you buy that same item again after 36 weeks at the same price of $18, how much would you have paid in total? Answer: Total cost = Number of purchases x Original price + Discount amount x Purchase number = $18 x 2 + $18 x 36 = $496 + $672 = $1168.
Response:  We have 5 machines working, and each machine can produce 3 actions. So, in total, we have 15 actions produced (5 x 3 = 15). Now, let's see how much money one action costs. If it takes 4 dollars to make one action, then the total cost of 15 actions would be 15 x 4 = 60 dollars. Therefore, the answer is 60 dollars.
Response:  If Jackie takes 10 hours to complete one task and her hourly wage is $35 per hour, then she will earn $35 x 10 = $350 for completing 10 tasks. Since she has to pay $90 as service charge, she will have $350 - $90 = $260 left after paying the service charge. So, the amount that Jackie will receive if she completes 10 tasks is $260.
"Response:  The total cost of all these items is:

Response:  If Sandra has 9 zé (bags) of candy and each bag contains 3 zé (pieces), then she has a total of 9 x 3 = 27 pieces of candy. Now, if she gives 15 pieces to her friend, she will have 27 - 15 = 12 pieces left.
"Response:  The first part of the question is ""Seth gen de fwa laj Brooke."" This means that Seth has 10 friends named Brooke. So, the number of people Seth knows is 10. Now, let's move to the second part of the question. It says, ""Nan 2 zan, sòm laj yo ap 28 an."" This means that among those 10 friends, there are 2 who are 28 years old. Therefore, the total number of people Seth knows who are 28 years old is 2."
Response:  If Jimmy has $2 and gives $1 to Ethel, then he has $2 - $1 = $1 left. If Ethel has $8, then she has $8 - $1 = $7 left. So, if Jimmy gives $1 to Ethel, then he has $1, and Ethel has $7.
"Response:  We know that Pancho made $20 million PAB and expected to make $10 million more. So, in total, he will have earned $30 million PAB. Now, we need to convert this amount from PAB to USD. The exchange rate is 1 USD = 45 PAB. Therefore, the total amount of money Pancho will have earned in USD is:
$30,000,000 x (1 / 45) = $675,000 USD"
Response:  The cost of one shirt is $25, and two pairs of pants are $40. So, the total cost for both clothes and shoes would be: Total Cost = Shirt + Pants (2 pairs) + Shoes = $25 + ($40 x 2) + $30 = $195.
"Response:  We have:
Spiders (S): 80 + 90 = 170
Envestbrates (E): 6 + 3 = 9
Mutants (M): 10
Total number of creatures (T): S + E + M = 170 + 9 + 10 = 190
So, the total number of creatures is 190."
Response:  We have to find out how many cats are in each train car and then add them up. So, we can start with the first train car where Gen Kat is located. There are 3 cats in this car (Gen Kat, Sally De, and Granny Wouj). Now let's move to the next car where Sally De is located. There are also 3 cats in this car (Sally De, Pi Gran Pase, and Granny Red). Finally, there are 2 cats in the last car (Sally Trant-De and 8 Anes Fin Vye). Therefore, the total number of cats in all 4 train cars is: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8.
Response:  If we take into account that Jessica has to pay at least $300 per month for her rent and utilities, then she will have around $170 left after paying those bills (assuming no other expenses). Therefore, if she wants to save at least $500 per month, she needs to set aside more than half of what is left after paying her rent and utilities. So, in this case, she would need to set aside around $850 per month ($500 / $170 = $850) to meet her savings goal.
Response:  We know that there are 60 pômdétes to be prepared for the event and we want to finish preparing them in 5 minutes. So, we need to prepare 12 pômdétes per minute (60/5 = 12). Now, let's calculate how many seconds it takes to prepare one pômdète: 12 pômdétes / 5 seconds per pômdète = 240 seconds or 4 minutes. Therefore, Billy will have enough time to prepare all 60 pômdétes in 5 minutes if he can prepare 12 pômdétes every 4 minutes.
Response:  If Juan buys lemonade for $3 per cup and gives $2 to Sarah, he will have $1 left over ($3 - $2 = $1). If he then buys 20 cups of lemonade, he will spend $1 x 20 = $20. So if he is given $25 in profit, he will have $25 - $20 = $5 left over after buying the lemonade.
"Response:  We know that there are 240 Asian workers in Japan and 80 of them are Chinese. So, if we divide the number of Japanese workers (60) by the number of Chinese workers (80), we get the ratio of Japanese to Chinese workers as follows:
Ratio = 60/80 = 3/5 or 1.2
Therefore, the answer is 1.2."
Response:  Firstly, we know that $ 1/4 of the total amount collected is for Lydia (Zaid) which means he got $ 250. Then, 1/3 of the remaining amount goes to gas and maintenance of the car which is $ 750. So, the total amount received by Zaid is $ 250 + $ 750 = $ 900.
"Response: 
Rani has 10 krabs and gives 4 to her friend Monica. So Rani now has 6 krabs left (10 - 4 = 6).
Monica has 4 krabs that she got from Rani.
Now, if Bo has 40 krabs, he will have 36 krabs left after giving 4 to Ansanm (40 - 4 = 36)."
Response:  We know that Lloyd touches his math book for $10 per year. If he makes 5 lessons per week and has 8 weeks of vacation in a semester, then he spends $40 per semester on math lessons. So, after 8 semesters, he will have spent a total of $320 on math lessons.
Response:  We know that out of 80 votes in the class, candidate A received 3/4 of them or 56 votes (80 x 3/4 = 56). To find out how many votes the losing candidate received, we need to subtract the number of votes obtained by candidate A from the total number of votes cast, which is 80 - 56 = 24. Therefore, the losing candidate received 24 votes.
Response:  If Sandra has to deliver 200 bouquets of white roses and each bouquet contains 10 stems (as mentioned in the question), then she needs to prepare 2000 stems of white roses for delivery. Given that it takes her 4 hours to prepare the flowers (as mentioned in the question), Sandra will have enough time to prepare all the bouquets if she starts working at 9 am and finishes preparing all the bouquets by 1 pm. However, since she wants to deliver them before 5 pm, she should start preparing the flowers at 8 am to ensure timely delivery. Therefore, the answer is 8 am.
Response:  We know that Jean has 5 apples and he gives 3 to his friend Mark. So, Jean now has 5 - 3 = 2 apples left. Since Mark also gets 1 apple from Jean, we can say that Mark has 1 + 1 = 2 apples in total. Now, since Jan wants to give 30 apples to someone, we can conclude that Jan will have 30 - 2 = 28 apples after giving them away.
Response:  The team can run 400 meters in 55 seconds, and each member of the team runs at a constant speed of 1 meter per second. Therefore, the distance traveled by each member of the team is 400 / 1 = 400 meters. Since there are four members in the team, the total distance traveled by all members together is 4 x 400 = 1600 meters. So, after running for 60 seconds, they will have covered a distance of 1600 / 60 = 26.67 meters per second.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times we can divide 3 into 100. So, we will divide 100 by 3 and see how many times it gives us a result of 33 or less than 33.

So, let's do the calculation:

100 / 3 = 33

Now, we have found that we can divide 3 into 100 exactly 3 times. Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  If Jenna has 10 apples and she gives 5 to her friend, then Jenna has 10 - 5 = 5 apples left. Now, if her friend also has 20 apples, then together they have 5 + 20 = 25 apples.
"Response:  We have to distribute 200 mojo coins among three groups of rats with different sizes (3, 4 and 5). Each group will receive its share based on their size. For example, if there are 3 rats in a group, each rat will get 67 mojos (200 / 3 = 67); for 4 rats, each rat will get 50 mojos (200 / 4 = 50), and so on. Now let's calculate how many mojos each rat will get if we divide 200 mojos equally among all 160 rats: 200 / 160 = 1.25 mojos per rat. So, each rat will get approximately 1.25 mojos."
Response:  If Mandy has $100 and gives $2% to Benedict, then she will have $98 ($100 - $2). If she can give Benedict $3 more, then she will have $95 ($98 - $3). So, Benedict will get $95 from Mandy.
Response:  If you have to pay $2 for transportation per bag of sugar (chak sak) and you want to buy 20 bags (dola), then you will need to pay $40 in transportation fees ($2 x 20 = $40). So, your total cost including the transportation fee would be $440 ($30 x 15 = $450 - $40 = $440).
Response:  We have two friends who each receive $20.25 and want to share it equally among themselves. They decide to divide it into three parts of $4.50 each for their meals. So they will get $13.50 each after subtracting $4.50 for their meals. Now if we add up all these amounts, we get $27 + $27 = $54. So there is still $8 left over after they divided everything equally among themselves.
Response:  We have 3 zè (zebras) and each zebra has 2 pecks of fruit. So we have 6 pecks of fruit in total. Now, one of the zebras collected 1 peck of fruit. So, there are now 5 pecks of fruit left for the other two zebras. Therefore, the third zebra collects 4 pecks of fruit (since there are only 5 pecks left). So, the final distribution is: Zebra 1 - 1 peck, Zebra 2 - 4 pecks, Zebra 3 - 4 pecks.
Response:  If Patou has 5 kg of rice and he gives 2 kg to Jean, then Patou has 3 kg of rice left (5 - 2 = 3). Now, if Jean has 10 kg of rice, then together they have 13 kg of rice (3 + 10 = 13).
Response:  We have 10 pye-bwa (pye-bwa = 10) and we take out 2 pye-bwa to make 4 pye-bwa. So now we have 4 pye-bwa left. Then, after 10 years, there will be 4 x 1.3 = 5.2 pye-bwa. Therefore, the number of pye-bwa that will remain after 10 years is 5.2 pye-bwa.
Response:  On Friday, there are 18 plastic Flamingos in the collection that need to be decided whether they will go with Sue or not. If we decide to give them to Sue, then on Saturday, we will add 18 more plastic Flamingos to the collection. So, at the end of Sunday, there would be 36 plastic Flamingos in the collection. Therefore, out of the total number of plastic Flamingos, 50% (or 18) will go with Sue and the remaining 50% (or 18) will stay in the collection.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Violetta has after buying 5 different clothes worth $ 20 each. So, in total, she will spend $100 (5 x $20). Now, let's calculate how many kreys she will get back. If she gets 2 dollars for every kreys, then she will get 2 x $100 = $200 in kreys. Therefore, Violetta will receive $200 in kreys.
Response:  The cost of one pastry is $1.20 and the cost of one rice cake is $0.30. If there are 8 pastries and 4 rice cakes, then the total cost would be: 8 x $1.20 = $9.60 + 4 x $0.30 = $1.20 = $10.80. Therefore, the answer is $10.80.
Response:  We have 200 lives to distribute among 40 restaurants in a village. Each restaurant can accommodate 2 live cows. So, we need to divide 200 lives into 80 portions (200 / 40 = 5). Now each portion is 2 lives per restaurant. Therefore, there are 80 live cows that will be used for distribution.
Response:  The population of Soda is given as 23786 and the area of the city is given as 8417 square kilometers. To find out how many people live in each kilometer squared, we divide the total population by the area: 23786 / 8417 = approximately 28 people per square kilometer. Therefore, there are approximately 28 x 9092 = 252,704 people living in the city of Soda.
"Response:  We know that Elaine has collected 20 kinds of Pokémon and she wants to collect all the Pokémon in the game. So we can assume that there are 150 different types of Pokémon in the game (20 / 2 = 150). Now let's calculate how many times Elaine needs to collect each type of Pokémon to have all of them:

150 - 20 = 130 remaining types of Pokémon

Since Elaine already has 20 kinds of Pokémon, she only needs to collect 130 x 2 = 260 more Pokémon to get all of them. Therefore, the number of Pokémon Elaine will collect is 260."
Response:  We have to calculate how much of each public has contributed to the total amount of money spent. Public A spends $5 per sentence, and Public B spends twice as much as Public A. So if Public A spends $5 per sentence, then Public B spends $10 per sentence. Now we need to find out how many sentences were written in total. According to the problem statement, 1000 sentences were written in total. Therefore, the total amount of money spent by both publics is: Total = (Number of sentences x Amount spent per sentence) = ($10 x 500) + ($5 x 500) = $5000 + $2500 = $7500.
Response:  We have 5 small bottles of water (dlo) and each one contains 1 liter (lit) of water. So, in total we have 5 liters of water from these small bottles. Now, let's consider the large bottle (chak). If it can hold 6 times as much water as the small bottles, then it can hold 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water. Therefore, if we fill the large bottle with water from the small bottles, it will contain 30 liters of water.
"Response:  The problem is asking for the amount of money that will be received after 5 years with a 5% interest rate per year. So, we need to calculate the future value of $5000 at the end of 5 years.

Future Value = Principal x (1 + Interest Rate)^Years

In this case, the principal is $5000 and the interest rate is 5%, so we can plug those values into the formula like this:

Future Value = $5000 x (1 + 0.05)^5

Now, let's simplify the calculation:

Future Value = $5000 x 1.6478

So, after 5 years, the amount of money that will be received is $8239 ($5000 x 1.6478)."
Response:  We have 10 eggs and we want to know how many egg whites are in 2 baskets of equal size. So, if each basket contains 5 eggs, then there are 5 x 2 = 10 egg whites in total. Therefore, the answer is 10 egg whites.
Response:  We have to make 4 sandwiches with 2 slices of bread each and 1 egg for an omelette. So we need 8 slices of bread in total (4 x 2 = 8). Since there are 7 eggs in the carton, we can use all of them to make the omelette. Therefore, we will have 8 slices of bread left over after making the omelette.
Response:  We have 22 piles of rice (Janet has). Out of these, she gives away 10 piles to her friend. Now, she has 12 piles left (9 + 3 = 12). Then, she buys 6 bags of rice and gives 2 bags to her friend. So, now Janet has 6 piles of rice left with herself (6 - 2 = 4), and her friend has 8 piles of rice (10 - 2 = 8).
"Response:  We are given that Brinley has scored between 86 and 100 in five subjects. If we assume that he got 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 respectively, then we can calculate his average score as follows:
Average Score = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5
= 455 / 5
= 91
So, Brinley's overall grade is B+ (91)."
Response:  We know that Monte has cycled for 5 hours and covered 25 km. He then decided to cycle for another 2 hours and cover 60 km more. So in total, he cycled for 8 hours (2 + 5) and covered 85 km (2 x 25 + 60). Therefore, the distance Michael cycled is 85 km.
Response:  We know that there are 25 pieces of candy in total and each piece weighs 40 grams. So, if we divide the total weight of all the candies (25 x 40 g = 1000 g) by the number of pieces (25), we get the average weight of one piece of candy: 1000 g / 25 = 40 g per piece. Therefore, Sak Joe has 40 grams of candy in his bag.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cats are in total and then calculate how many cats each child has received. So, let's break down the information given in the question:

* ""Rose te ale nan magazen an lendi e li te achte 4 gato."" means that Rose bought 4 cats from the store.
* ""Madi li te ale nan yon lòt magazen e li te achte twa fwa plis gato pase sa."" means that Madi bought 2 more cat from the same store after Rose.
* ""Konbyen gato li te achte apre twa jou yo?"" means that How many cats did Konbyen buy after two years?

Now, let's calculate the total number of cats that Rose, Madi, and Konbyen have together:

Rose has 4 cats + Madi has 2 more = Total cats = 6 cats

So, Konbyen has bought x cats after two years (where x is the difference between 6 and 2). Therefore, the answer is:

x = 4 cats

Therefore, the numeric answer to the question is 4."
Response:  The total cost of all the items is $6000, and each item costs $1200. So, we have to divide $6000 by $1200 to get the number of items that can be purchased with that amount. Therefore, the answer is 5 items ( $6000 / $1200 = 5).
"Response:  First, we know that Sara has $10 to buy a new jacket for herself and her two friends. So she can afford to buy three jackets at most (since each friend needs one). Therefore, the total cost of the jackets cannot exceed $30 (the amount of money Sara has). Now, let's calculate how much each friend will have to pay for their respective jackets: For Sara's friend 1, the cost is $20; for Sara's friend 2, the cost is $10. Since Sara wants to give $10 to her grandmother, she will be left with $4 after buying the jackets. So, the remaining amount that Sara will have after buying the jackets is $4."
Response:  If Jerry collects 42 pieces of candy and each piece is worth 5 jelly beans, then he has collected a total of 42 x 5 = 210 jelly beans. However, if all the white candies are worth 3 jelly beans each, then Jerry would have collected a total of 42 x 3 = 126 jelly beans from them. So, in total, Jerry has collected 210 + 126 = 336 jelly beans.
"Response:  The distance between two points is given as $d = 1.5 \text{ miles} \times 6 \text{ miles} = 9 \text{ miles}$. If Gary walks at a rate of $3 \text{ miles}/\text{hour}$, how long will it take him to walk that distance?

$$\therefore \text{time taken } = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{rate}} = \frac{9 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles}/\text{hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}$$"
Response:  We have 100 clients who buy products from the store every day. If we give each client 50% discount, then we will lose $50 per day (100 clients x $0.50 discount per client = $50 loss per day). Now, if we want to calculate how many days it would take for us to reach our target of losing $500, we can use the formula: Number of days = Total amount lost / Daily loss. So, in this case, number of days = $500 / $50 per day = 10 days. Therefore, it would take us 10 days to reach our target of losing $500.
Response:  The first gallon of water takes 4 minutes to flow through the pipe, so in 4 minutes, 120 gallons (4 x 30) will have passed through the pipe. Therefore, after 4 minutes, there will be 120 - 1 = 119 gallons left in the tank.
Response:  The amount of money that Lori has is $320.00 and she wants to split it equally among all the people who are coming for dinner. If there are 8 people coming for dinner, each person will get $40.00 ( $320.00 / 8 = $40.00). So, Lori will have $320.00 - ($40.00 x 8) = $320.00 - $320.00 = $0.00 left after splitting the money with everyone.
Response:  The amount of money that Janet has is $2000 and she wants to give 10% of it to charity. So, she will give $200 (10% of $2000) to charity. Now, if she spends $165 on something, her remaining balance will be $200 - $165 = $35. Therefore, after making this purchase, Janet's balance in her account will be $35.
Response:  In Generation 4, there are 10 Dahlias (5 in the first generation and 5 in the second). In Generation 7, there are 20 Dahlias (10 in the third generation and 10 in the fourth generation). So, the total number of Dahlias from Generations 4 to 7 is: 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 30.
Response:  We know that Adrian is 30 years old and has two children (a boy named Zack). According to the information provided in the question, Harriet is 21 years old and has one child (also a boy named Zack). So, we can conclude that Harriet gave birth to Zack when she was 21 years old.
Response:  We know that the total number of points is 251 and Noami has 68 points. Yuri has 10 more than Naomi which means he has 78 points. Brianna has 17 more than Naomi which means she has 95 points. So, Conny has 95 + 10 = 105 points. Therefore, the answer is 105.
"Response:  If it takes him 10 minutes to solve one difficult puzzle and 5 minutes to solve another easy puzzle, then he will take:

Time taken = (Difficulty level of first puzzle x Time taken to solve first puzzle) + (Easy puzzle x Time taken to solve second puzzle)
= (10 x 6) + (5 x 2)
= 60 + 10
= 70 minutes
Therefore, he will take 70 minutes to solve all three difficult puzzles and 8 easy puzzles."
Response:  The total capacity of the tank is 120 liters and Celene can use up to 90 liters from that tank. So there are 30 liters left in the tank after she uses them. Now let's calculate how many times she can collect water from the remaining amount. If we divide the remaining amount (30 liters) by the amount she can collect at one time (10 liters), we get 3 times. Therefore, she can collect water three times from the remaining amount in the tank.
Response:  We have 90 jerans (J) and 40 petons (P). A jeran is equal to 1/3 of a peton, so we can write J = P / 3. Now, we know that there are 90 jerans and 40 petons, so we can calculate the total as follows: Total = 90 x P / 3 = 90 x 40 / 3 = 1350. Therefore, the total amount of money in Konbyen is 1350 petons.
Response:  The amount of money that the person has to pay for the loan is $15,000. If we divide this amount by the number of years (3) that they have to repay it, then we get the monthly payment amount which is $5,000 per year or $416.67 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total amount paid over one year as follows: Total Amount Paid = Monthly Payment x Number of Years = $416.67 x 3 = $1,250.01 Therefore, the total amount paid over three years would be $3,750.03 ($1,250.01 x 3).
Response:  If Carlos has 3 children and each child needs $30 for their education, then Carlos will need a total of $90 ($3 x 3 = $9). Similarly, if Benji has 5 children and each child needs $18 for their education, then Benji will need a total of $90 ($18 x 5 = $90). So, the total amount needed for both families is $180 ($90 + $90 = $180).
Response:  If Andre plans to visit six places in New Jersey and he wants to avoid going back to the same place twice, then there are five different places he can go. So, the number of places he will visit is 5.
"Response:  We have:
James has 30 pieces of good quality rice, 20 pieces of medium-quality rice, and 40 pieces of low-quality rice. If he gives away 8 pieces of low-quality rice to someone, how many pieces of high-quality rice will he have left?
So, we can say that after giving away 8 pieces of low-quality rice, James will have 30 - 8 = 22 pieces of good quality rice, 20 pieces of medium-quality rice, and 40 pieces of low-quality rice."
Response:  The total cost of the burrito is $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50. Then, we add $1.00 for the avocado, $1.00 for the salsa, and $0.25 for the tortilla chips, so the new total cost is $9.75. If he wants to add cheese, which costs $1.00, then the final total cost would be $10.75. Therefore, the correct answer is $10.75.
Response:  We have to add 4 more mosquitoes in total. So we will start with 360 and then add 4 which gives us 364. Now let's calculate how many mosquitoes are there per minute. If we divide 364 by 60 (minutes), we get approximately 6 with remainder 12. Therefore, after completing one minute, there will be 7 mosquitoes.
"Response:  We have $120$ to buy melons and we want to know how many kilograms of melon we can get for that amount. If each kilogram of melon costs $\$30$, then we can buy $\frac{120}{30} = 4$ kilograms of melon with our budget. Now, if we want to know how much of the remaining melon (after buying $\frac{120}{30}$ kilograms) is left over, we need to subtract this amount from the total amount of melon available. So, the remaining melon after buying $\frac{120}{30}$ kilograms is:

$$\text {Remaining melon } = \text {Total melon - Buyable melon } = 120 - 4 = 96 \text { kilograms}$$
Therefore, there are $\boxed{\frac{96}{7}} = 13.71$ kilograms of melon left over after buying $\frac{120}{30}$ kilograms."
Response:  The amount of money that Mak has is $20,000 and he wants to save 10% of it for taxes. So, he sets aside $2,000 (10% of $20,000) for taxes. Now, he has $18,000 left ($20,000 - $2,000). He then spends $1,000 to buy something, which means he has $17,000 left ($18,000 - $1,000). Therefore, the remaining amount after buying something is $17,000.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Kylie collected 5 pieces of candy from Robert and then gave him 20 pieces of candy back. Later, Kylie collected 2 more pieces of candy than she had given to Leni. So, if we calculate how many candies Kylie has collected so far, it would be: 5 + 20 = 25. Therefore, Kylie has collected 25 pieces of candy in total.
"Response:  If we have 50 balls in a jar and we want to know how many of them are red, we can calculate it as follows:
Red balls = Total number of balls x Percentage of red balls
= 50 x (Number of red balls / Total number of balls)
= 50 x (10/50)
= 20
Therefore, there are 20 red balls in the jar."
"Response:  The number of people in Generation 36 is 36 x 10 = 360. Now, let's calculate how many people are in each generation based on the information provided in the passage:

Generation 1: 24 fathers + 24 mothers = 48 people
Generation 2: 24 sons + 24 daughters = 48 people
Generation 3: 24 grandchildren + 24 great-grandchildren = 96 people
Total number of people in all three generations = 48 + 48 + 96 = 192 people
Therefore, the answer to the question ""Konbyen pengwen ki rete pou pran solèy?"" (How many people are there in the entire lineage?) is 192."
"Response:  We have to find out how many small tomatoes and large cherry tomatoes Steve has in total. So, we can start with the information given in the question:
Steve has 12 small tomatoes (plis) and 4 large cherry tomatoes (grandi pwòp).
Now, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve has:
Small tomatoes = 12
Large cherry tomatoes = 4
Total number of tomatoes = Small tomatoes + Large cherry tomatoes
= 12 + 4
= 16
So, Steve has 16 tomatoes in total. Now, let's find out how many tomatoes are left after he gives 6 to his friend:
Tomatoes left = Total number of tomatoes - Number of tomatoes given to friend
= 16 - 6
= 10
Therefore, Steve has 10 tomatoes left after giving 6 to his friend."
Response:  We have 20 friends in total and we want to divide them into 4 teams of 5 people each. So, if we take 4 teams, then there will be 1 team left with 4 members. Therefore, the remaining number of members in that team is 4/4 = 1 member. So, the number of members in the last team is 1.
"Response:  If we buy 25 pieces of lemons at $1 each and sell them for $3 each, then our profit is:
Profit = Number of lemons sold x Price per lemon - Cost price per lemon
= 25 x $3 - $1
= $40 - $1
= $39
So, the total profit made from selling those 25 lemons is $39."
Response:  If Johnny added $10 to his reserve of $20, he would have $30 in total. Then, if he invested half of that amount (i.e., $15) in a business, he would be left with $15. So, after one year, the value of the business would be $16 ($15 + $1).
Response:  If Mary is 3 years older than Joan and Joan is 20 years old, then Mary is 50 years old (Joan + 3 = Mary).
"Response:  We have to find out how many students are in each class and then calculate the total number of students in all classes combined. So we can start with the first part of the problem which is finding out how many students are in each class. According to the question, there are three classes (A, B, and C) and the total number of students in these classes is 1000. Now let's break it down further:
Class A has 30% of the total students, so the number of students in Class A is 300 (1000 x 30%).
Class B has 2/5 of the remaining students, so the number of students in Class B is 400 (1000 - 300).
Class C has the remaining 1/5 of the students, so the number of students in Class C is 200 (1000 - 400 - 300).
Now that we know the number of students in each class, we can add them up to get the total number of students in all classes combined: Total = 300 + 400 + 200 = 900. Therefore, there are 900 students in all three classes combined."
Response:  If James has 6 generations of Bonbons and each generation is 20 years old, then James was born in year 1980 (6 x 20 = 120). Now, if Robert was born in 1970, he would be 54 years old now (1970 + 54 = 2014). So, according to the question, Robert's age is 54 years old.
Response:  If we have two groups of people - Dolly and Pandora - with different levels of knowledge about how to live sustainably (Dolly has some knowledge but not enough, while Pandora is very knowledgeable), then it would be beneficial for both groups to work together towards achieving their shared goal of living sustainably. By collaborating and sharing their collective knowledge and experiences, they could create a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to live sustainably and develop strategies that are tailored to their specific contexts. This way, both groups can learn from each other and grow in their ability to live sustainably.
Response:  We have 5 friends and we want to share them equally among 2 people. So each person will get 3 friends (5 / 2 = 3). Now let's count how many minutes it takes for one person to see all their 3 friends. If it takes 6 minutes for one person to see one friend, then it will take 6 x 3 = 18 minutes for one person to see all 3 friends. Therefore, in 18 minutes, the second person will also finish seeing their 3 friends.
Response:  If Jason makes 1000 calls in one minute and each call lasts for 15 minutes, then he will make 300 calls in one hour (60 minutes). So, if he starts making calls at 9 am and continues until 4 pm, he will have made 30 x 6 = 180 calls during that time period.
Response:  If Griffin has 24 friends and each friend brings 5 people for a party, then there will be a total of 120 guests at the party (24 x 5 = 120). Now, if Kyle is one of the guests who brought his friends to the party, then he will have 5 friends with him (since each friend brings 5 people), so the total number of guests that Kyle will bring to the party is 5 x 5 = 25. Therefore, the total number of guests that Kyle will bring to the party is 25 + 120 = 145. Since Colby wants to know how many friends Kyle will bring to the party after 3 months, we can assume that it takes 3 months for Kyle to gather all these friends. So, in 3 months, Kyle will bring 145 friends to the party.
Response:  If there are 32 fish in the first tank and each tank has a capacity of 10 fish, then the total number of tanks is 32 / 10 = 3. So, there are 3 tanks in total. Now, let's calculate the number of fish in each tank. Since the total number of fish in all tanks is equal to the number of fish in the first tank multiplied by the number of tanks, we can write the equation as follows: Number of fish in each tank = Total number of fish / Number of tanks. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of fish in each tank = 32 x 3 = 96 fish. Therefore, there are 96 fish in each tank.
Response:  The cost of one pair of jeans is $250 and there are six pairs to make in total. So, the total cost would be $250 x 6 = $1,500. If we subtract 10% of that amount (which is $150), then we get the final price of each pair of jeans, which is $1,350. Therefore, the price of one pair of jeans after deduction is $1,350.
Response:  We have to divide each amount by two because there are two people in the team. So, we will get: $12 / 2 = $6 for the cost of the goat, $43 / 2 = $21.50 for the balloons, $15 / 2 = $7.50 for the decoration, $4 / 2 = $2 for the invitations, and $22 / 2 = $11 for the food. Therefore, the total cost is $6 + $21.50 + $7.50 + $2 + $11 = $42.
Response:  The cost of one sack of rice is $4. So, the total cost of four sacks would be $4 x 4 = $16. If each sack weighs 50 pounds and there are 120 pounds in a sack (since 1 pound is equal to 0.453592 kilograms), then the weight of four sacks would be $16 / 0.453592 = $35.78. Therefore, the answer is $35.78.
Response:  We know that Lendi has eaten 4 pieces of candy and Madi has eaten 5 pieces of candy. So in total, they have eaten 9 pieces of candy (4 + 5 = 9). Now we need to calculate how many calories are in each piece of candy. According to the question, one piece of candy contains 200 calories. Therefore, the total number of calories consumed by both Lendi and Madi is equal to the number of pieces of candy multiplied by the number of calories per piece of candy. In this case, it would be 9 x 200 = 1800 calories.
