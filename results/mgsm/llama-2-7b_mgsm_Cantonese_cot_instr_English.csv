"Response: 
Janet can lay 16 eggs per day.
Each egg costs $2.
So, Janet earns $32 per day from selling eggs ($2 x 16).
Now, let's calculate how much money she makes from cooking and selling breakfast to her friends every day.
She cooks three meals of chicken nuggets for four friends each day, which means she prepares a total of 12 meals (3 x 4) per day.
The cost price of each meal is $5, so Janet earns $60 per day from cooking breakfast for her friends ($5 x 12).
Therefore, Janet earns a total of $92 per day ($32 from selling eggs + $60 from cooking breakfast) in the farmers' market."

"Response: 
Josh spent $80,000 to buy an old house and then spent another $50,000 for renovation work. The value of the house after renovation increased by 150%. So, how much money did Josh make from this deal?
Let's calculate it as follows:
Before renovation: Value of the house = $80,000
After renovation: Value of the house = $120,000 (increase of 150%)
Profit = New value - Original price
= $120,000 - $80,000
= $40,000
So, Josh made a profit of $40,000 from this deal."
Response:  If James decides to run three steps per week and each step is 60 meters long, then he will cover a total distance of 180 meters (3 x 60) in one week. Therefore, he will cover a total distance of 540 meters (180 x 3) in three weeks.
"Response: 
Wendy feeds her chickens three bowls of chicken meat every day, and each bowl contains seeds and insects that are good for their health. She divides the chicken into three meals throughout the day. In the morning, she gives them 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 bowls of food. If Wendy has 20 chickens, how many bowls of food does she need to give them at the last meal?
Let X be the number of bowls of food Wendy needs to give her chickens at the last meal.
Since there are 3 meals in a day, we can write an equation:
X + 15 = 25 (morning)
X + 25 = 45 (afternoon)
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 45 - 25 = 20
So, Wendy needs 20 bowls of food to give her 20 chickens at the last meal."
Response:  Kara wants to buy 16 glasses of wine for $5 each, so she needs $80. However, each glass of wine costs only $6, so she can buy 13 glasses with her remaining money ($80 / $6 = 13). Therefore, Kara needs $42 to buy all 16 glasses of wine.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, we know that:

* Turin has twice as many sheep as Charles Town. So if Charles Town has x sheep, Turin has 2x sheep.
* Seattle has four times as many sheep as Charles Town. So if Charles Town has x sheep, Seattle has 4x sheep.

Now, we need to find out how many sheep are there in total among these three cities. We can do this by adding up the number of sheep in each city:

Turin: 2x = 2(x) sheep
Charles Town: x sheep
Seattle: 4x = 4(x) sheep
Total: 2x + x + 4x = 7x sheep

So, there are 7x sheep in total among these three cities."
"Response: 
Carla has a file of 200 GB that she wants to download. She can typically download 2 terabytes (or 2,000 gigabytes) of data per minute, but after downloading it, Windows forces her to restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. To calculate how long it will take for Carla to download the file, we need to consider two factors: the speed at which she can download the file and the time it takes for Windows to force her to restart after each download session.
Let's assume that Carla can download the file at a rate of 2 terabytes per minute, or 120 gigabytes per minute (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). Therefore, it will take her approximately 16.7 minutes (200 GB / 120 GB/minute = 16.7 minutes) to download the entire file if she doesn't have to restart her computer after each download session. However, since Windows forces her to restart after each download session, it will actually take her twice as long to download the file - 33.4 minutes (16.7 minutes x 2 = 33.4 minutes)."
"Response: 
John walked for three hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour and then turned back home because he realized that he had forgotten something important. He wanted to drive back home in four hours but encountered traffic jams during the last two hours of his journey. After waiting for 2 hours, he resumed driving at a speed of 30 miles per hour and took another 4 hours to reach home. How far is John from his house?
Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Distance covered in the first 3 hours = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours = 180 miles
2. Distance traveled after turning back = Speed x Time = 30 miles/hour x 2 hours = 60 miles
Total distance traveled = Add the distances above = 180 + 60 = 240 miles
So, John is 240 miles away from his house."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Eliza works for 40 hours per week and earns $10 per hour. Additionally, overtime pay is calculated at 1.2 times the regular rate, so if she works more than 40 hours in a week, her overtime pay will be $10 x 1.2 = $12 per hour. Now, let's calculate Eliza's total income for the week: Regular pay = $10 x 40 hours = $400 Overtime pay = $12 x (number of overtime hours) =? Total income = Regular pay + Overtime pay So, if Eliza worked 45 hours this week, her total income would be: Total income = $400 + ($12 x 9 hours) = $400 + $108 = $508
"Response: 

Step 1 (first month): The new program has 60 downloads. Since it is the first month, we can assume that the downloads are tripled, so the total number of downloads in the first month is 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.

Step 2 (second month): The program has 40 downloads, which is 30% less than the previous month. So, the total number of downloads in the second month is 180 - 40 = 140 downloads.

Step 3 (third month): We are given that the program has 20 downloads in the third month. To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to add up all the downloads from each month: 140 + 140 + 20 = 380 downloads.

Therefore, the program was downloaded 380 times in the past three months."
Response:  Toula bought three tarts at $68 each, so that's $194 for the tarts alone. Then she bought two cakes at $80 each, which is an additional $160. Finally, she bought six cheese puffs at $55 each, which brings the total to $375. Therefore, the total cost of all the items Toula bought from the bakery is $375.
"Response: 
Carlos planted one tree and spent $90.
Each year, he plants seven trees at a cost of $1 each. Therefore, the total cost for each tree is $7.
To calculate how many years it takes to make money from raising trees, we need to subtract the initial investment ($90) from the annual income ($7 \times 7 = $49). So, it will take approximately 36 years to break even (i.e., make $90 in profit).
Therefore, the answer is 36 years."
"Response: 
Green House sells three-fifths of its vacuum cleaners to Melanie. This means that Green House has 3/5 = 0.6 times as many vacuum cleaners left as it had initially.
Red House sells two-thirds of its remaining vacuum cleaners to Melanie. This means that Red House has 2/3 = 0.67 times as many vacuum cleaners left as it had initially.
Melanie buys five vacuum cleaners from both Green and Red Houses. So, she has 0.6 + 0.67 = 1.27 times as many vacuum cleaners as she started with.
Therefore, if Melanie starts with five vacuum cleaners, she will have 1.27 x 5 = 6.35 vacuum cleaners after purchasing from both Green and Red Houses."
"Response: 
1. The total number of students in the class is 20.
2. 20% of them are good at modern dance, which means there are 4 students who are good at modern dance (20% x 20 = 4).
3. 25% of them are good at jazz dance, which means there are 5 students who are good at jazz dance (25% x 20 = 5).
4. The remaining students are good at hip-hop dance, which means there are 11 students who are good at hip-hop dance (100 - 4 - 5 = 11).
5. In total, there are 4 + 5 + 11 = 20 students who are good at dancing.
Therefore, out of the 800 graduates, approximately 20/800 = 0.025 or 2.5% are good at dancing."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the expected return of each investment separately.
Expected return of buying a $5,000 piece of jewelry = (5,000 x 2.5%) = $125
Expected return of buying an $8,000 electronic product = (8,000 x 1.2%) = $96
Step 2: Compare the expected returns to determine which investment has higher potential for profit.
Higher expected return is $125 > $96, so the jewelry investment has higher potential for profit.
Therefore, if the merchant wants to maximize their profits at the end of the month, they should buy the $5,000 piece of jewelry."
"Response:  
Day 1: The two trains leave San Rafael at the same time and travel west for 130 miles.
Day 2: One train turns north and travels for 240 miles.
So, the total distance traveled by both trains in these two days is:
130 + 240 = 370 miles."
"Response: 
Jill earns $20 per hour as an English teacher. If she works for 50 weeks in a year (which is equivalent to 10 months), then her total hours worked in a year would be:

50 weeks x 4 weeks/month = 200 hours/year

Now, let's calculate how many hours she spends teaching and training each week:

Teaching hours/week = Total hours/year / Number of weeks in a year
= 200 hours/year / 10 months
= 20 hours/month

Training hours/week = Total hours/year / Number of weeks in a year
= 200 hours/year / 10 months
= 20 hours/month

Since Jill works for 35 hours/week as a teacher and 15 hours/week as a coach, we can calculate her annual income as follows:

Annual income = Hours worked/Week x Hourly wage

For teaching:
Annual income = 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week
$700/week x 50 weeks = $35,000/year

For coaching:
Annual income = 15 hours/week x $20/hour = $300/week
$300/week x 50 weeks = $15,000/year

Therefore, Jill's annual income from teaching and coaching would be approximately $48,000 ($35,000 + $15,000)."
Response:  Claire makes three eggs every morning, so in one week (7 days), she will make 21 eggs (3 x 7). In four weeks (28 days), she will make 84 eggs (21 x 4).
"Response:  
Marissa walked for 1 hour and covered 4 miles (first part). Then she walked for another 1 hour and covered 2 miles (second part). If she wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour throughout her journey, how many hours will it take her to cover the remaining distance? 
To find out, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance left to cover is the total distance minus the distance already covered, which is: Remaining distance = Total distance - Covered distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles. Now, if Marissa wants to cover the remaining distance at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the same formula again: Time = Distance / Speed = 6 miles / 4 miles/hour = 1.5 hours. So, Marissa needs to walk for 1.5 hours to complete her journey."
Response:  We know that initially you have 10 liters of juice and three-quarters of it is water (i.e., 75%), so the volume of juice is 10/4 = 2.5 liters. Now, when you add 15 liters of water to this mixture, the total volume becomes 2.5 + 15 = 17.5 liters. Since three-fifths of this new mixture is water, we can calculate the volume of juice as follows: 17.5 / 3 = 5.83 liters. So, there are 5.83 liters of juice left after adding 15 liters of water to the initial 10 liters of juice.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that Ramon was born six years before Samantha and that he is currently 23 years old. Therefore, if Samantha is 31 years old now, then Ramon must have been born when she was 25 years old. So, Ramon was born 6 + 25 = 31 years ago.
"Response: 
Step 1: The first three customers bought one DVD each, so there are 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs sold in total.
Step 2: The next two customers bought two DVDs each, so there are 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs sold in total.
Step 3: The last three customers did not buy any DVDs, so there are no additional DVDs sold.
In conclusion, the total number of DVDs sold on Wednesday is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs."
"Response:  If every burning time of 2 cm melts into 5 points from afternoon to evening (4 pm to 7 pm), then we can calculate the total amount of melted material as follows:
Total melted material = Number of hours x Burning time per hour x Melting rate
= 5 hours x 0.167 hours/cm x 2 cm/hour
= 8.33 cm^3
Therefore, the total amount of melted material is approximately 8.33 cubic centimeters."
Response:  The book was sold for $19.50 last year, and there is a 25% discount. To find out how much the original price of the book was, we can use the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage). In this case, the discount percentage is 25%, so we can plug in the values to get: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $78.00 Therefore, the original price of the book before the discount was $78.00.
"Response:  We know that Mary spent $50 on groceries in total. The cost of one chicken is $12, and there are five chickens in total. So, the total cost of chicken is $60 ($12 x 5).
The cost of each package of milk is $3, so the total cost of milk is $15 ($3 x 5).
The cost of each fruit is $1.50, so the total cost of fruits is $7.50 ($1.50 x 4).
If we have 8 packages of bread, then the total cost of bread is $64 ($8 x $8.50).
So, the total cost of all groceries is $60 + $15 + $7.50 + $64 = $146.
Now, let's find out how many boxes of bread Mary can buy with her budget of $146. To do this, we divide the total cost of groceries by the cost of each box of bread: $146 / $8.50 = 17 boxes.
Therefore, Mary can buy 17 boxes of bread with her budget of $146."

Mishka bought three pairs of shorts for $16.50 each, so that is $49.50. Then she bought three long pants for $22.50 each, which adds up to $67.50. Finally, she bought three pairs of shoes for $42 each, which equals $126. So in total, Mishka spent $234 ($49.50 + $67.50 + $126)."
"Response:  辛西 every night eats one ice cream. He bought an ice cream box with 15 pieces of ice cream per box and each piece costs $4. After six months, how many ice creams has he eaten?

Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes of ice cream that 辛西 has bought.
Number of boxes = Number of months x Number of pieces in each box
= 6 x 15
= 90 boxes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of ice creams that 辛西 has eaten.
Total number of ice creams = Number of boxes x Number of pieces in each box
= 90 x 15
= 1350 ice creams

Therefore, after six months, 辛西 has eaten 1350 ice creams."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Henry cycled for 60 miles and stopped twice along the way. The first stop was after 20 miles, and he then continued cycling until he reached his second stop, which was 15 miles from the end of his journey. So, the distance between the two stops is 15 miles. Therefore, the distance Henry cycled between the first and second stops is 40 miles (60 - 20 + 15).
Response:  Firstly, Gloria buys one pair of shoes for $33 and then sees another pair that she likes, which costs more than twice as much as the first pair. Therefore, if the price of the second pair is x, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem: 33 + x = 5x. Solving for x, we get x = 26. So, the price of the second pair of shoes is $26.
Response:  If Darrell is currently 7 years old and Allen is currently 11 years old, then in 10 years, Darrell will be 17 years old (7 + 10 = 17) and Allen will be 21 years old (11 + 10 = 21). Therefore, after 10 years, Allen will be 31 years old (21 + 10 = 31).
"Response:  
Günter has 80 apples in one basket and 20 apples in another basket. So, altogether he has 100 apples (80 + 20 = 100).
Now, Günter wants to know how many more apples his third basket has compared to the first two baskets. If the third basket has 35 apples (which is 25% more than the total number of apples in the first two baskets), then the average number of apples in all three baskets is:
Average number of apples = Total number of apples / Number of baskets
= 100 apples / 3 baskets
= 33.33 apples per basket
Therefore, the answer is 33 apples."
"Response:  Since each dog needs to spend 0.5 hours per day for exercise and care, the total time spent on exercising and caring for all ten dogs would be:

10 dogs x 0.5 hours/day = 5 hours/day

Now, let's calculate how many minutes are in 5 hours:

5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes/day

So, John spends 300 minutes (or approximately 5 hours) every day taking care of his ten dogs."
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total, and she gained 30 gold coins. So, the number of gold coins is equal to the total number of coins minus the number of silver coins. In other words, we can write an equation as follows: Number of gold coins = Total coins - Silver coins Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of gold coins = 110 - 80 (since there are 80 silver coins) Number of gold coins = 30 Therefore, Gretchen has 30 gold coins.
Response:  We know that Arron has more than half of Lemon's jewels. So, if Lemon has 40 pieces of jewelry, then Arron has at least 40 / 2 = 20 pieces of jewelry.
"Response:  
Mike played table tennis for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, he scored an average of 0.2 points per minute (4/40). 
In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored more than twice as many points as before, which means he scored 1.5 times as many points as his previous score (2 x 1.5 = 3). So, he scored 3 + 0.2 = 3.2 points in the last 20 minutes. 
Therefore, Mike scored a total of 4 + 3.2 = 7.2 points in the entire 40 minutes."
Response:  Since Terry buys two cups of yogurt every day and each cup costs $5, he spends a total of $10 per day on yogurt. To calculate how many cups of yogurt Terry can buy in 30 days, we need to divide the total amount he spends on yogurt ($10 x 30 = $300) by the cost of one cup of yogurt ($5). So, Terry can buy 60 cups of yogurt in 30 days (i.e., $300 / $5 = 60).
"Response: 
John sold each Lego block for $15 and bought eight video games at $20 each, so he spent a total of:
$15 x 13 = $195 (from selling Lego blocks)
$195 + ($8 x 8) = $195 + $64 = $259 (from buying video games)
Therefore, John has $259 left after buying the video games."
Response:  On Monday, John ran for 3 hours (or 3 x 60 = 180 minutes). On Tuesday, he ran for half an hour (or 30 minutes). So, in total, John ran for 180 + 30 = 210 minutes on those two days. Now, let's calculate how many kilometers he ran based on the time taken to run each day: Distance = Speed x Time traveled = 5 km/h x 210 min = 1050 meters per day. Since John runs every weekday, we can multiply this value by 5 to get the total distance covered in one week: Total distance = 1050 m/day x 5 d = 5250 meters per week. Therefore, John covers approximately 5250 meters per week when he runs every weekday.

Step 1: The chef has cut each of the five pieces into eight pieces, so there are now 40 pieces of fruit cake in total (5 x 8 = 40).
Step 2: Each customer takes one piece of fruit cake from the self-service table, leaving 39 pieces remaining after everyone has taken their share (40 - 1 = 39).
Step 3: After all customers have finished eating their fruit cakes and left no leftovers, there will be 14 pieces of fruit cake remaining (39 - 14 = 14).
Therefore, the number of pieces of fruit cake that remain after all customers have finished eating is 14."
Response:  If one bag of snacks contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in each bag, then the total number of calories in one bag is 250 x 5 = 1250 calories. Now, if you consume 2000 calories per day, and you have already consumed 1800 calories (which is equal to 18/5 of the total calories in one bag), then you still have 1250 - 1800 = 450 calories left to consume from that bag. Therefore, you will be able to eat approximately 450/5 = 90 servings of those snacks from that one bag.
Response:  If Charlie sells each bee for $2 and spends $1 to make ten sticks of honey per pound of bees, then he will have a profit of $1 per pound of bees sold. Since there are 20 pounds of bees in total, Charlie will have a total profit of $20 from selling all 20 pounds of bees. Therefore, Charlie will have a profit of $20 / $2 = $10 per pound of bees sold.

"Response: 

1. 坎迪斯 (Kandi) has 80 pieces of stickers in her wallet before going to work at the coffee shop.
2. She buys some things during her lunch break and returns with 67 remaining stickers.
3. At work, she puts one sticker on each cup of coffee she makes, so she uses up 67/4 = 16.75 stickers per day.
4. Since Kandi works for 5 days, she uses up 16.75 x 5 = 83.75 stickers in total during her workdays.
5. Therefore, there are 80 - 83.75 = 2.25 stickers left over after her workdays."
"Response: 
John bought a red scarf that is twice as expensive as a blue scarf. The price of each blue scarf is $40. How much did John pay for one blue scarf?
Let X be the cost of one blue scarf. Since the price of each blue scarf is $40, we can write:
X = 40
Now, let Y be the cost of one red scarf, which is twice as expensive as the blue scarf. So, Y = 2X = 80.
Therefore, John paid $80 for one blue scarf."
Response:  The line is 4.5 feet long and each piece of broken line is 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces of broken line there are, we need to divide the length of the line by the length of each piece of broken line. So, the number of pieces of broken line = 4.5 ft / 6 in = 750 pieces.
Response:  According to the question, there are 15 floors in total, and each floor has 8 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments is 15 x 8 = 120. Since the building occupies three-quarters of the entire building, the remaining quarter is equal to 1 - (3/4) = 1/4. So, the open-type units in the building have 1/4 x 120 = 30 units.
Response:  According to the question, Loyd has 252 eggs per day and each egg is 12 grams. So, he earns $2 x 252 = $504 per day from selling eggs. Now, let's calculate how much money Lloyd makes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so Lloyd makes $504 x 7 = $3,530 per week.
"Response:  
Step 1 (Departure): The boat can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 4 hours. Therefore, it will cover a distance of 4 x 10 = 40 miles in this time period.
Step 2 (Return Journey): After completing the first leg of the journey, the boat will return to the starting point at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 4 hours. This means that it will cover a distance of 4 x 10 = 40 miles again during this time period.
Total Distance Traveled: So, in total, the boat will have traveled 80 miles (40 + 40) during the entire journey.
Time Taken: To calculate the time taken for the entire journey, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the speed at which the boat is traveling. In this case, the time taken will be:
Time = Total Distance / Speed = 80 miles / 10 miles/hour = 8 hours
Therefore, the boat will take approximately 8 hours to complete the round-trip journey."
Response:  If Ullya needs to reduce his weight by 15 pounds and he has 30 comics that weigh 1 pound each, then he will have 30 pounds of comics.

"Response: 
Step 1: Identify the information given in the question.
* The cost of repairing each tire for a bus is $60.
* The cost of repairing each tire for a car is $40.
* Six truck tires and four car tires were repaired on Thursday.
* One mechanic worked on Friday and tried to repair ten car tires but did not try to repair any truck tire.
Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned by the mechanic on Thursday.
Total number of tires repaired = 6 (truck) + 4 (car) = 10
Each tire costs $60, so total earning on Thursday = 10 x $60 = $600
Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned by the mechanic on Friday.
Since one mechanic worked on Friday and only tried to repair car tires, let's assume that he repaired 5 car tires at $40 each = $200.
Step 4: Calculate the total amount earned by the mechanic over the two days.
Add the total earnings from Thursday and Friday = $600 + $200 = $800
Therefore, the mechanic earned $800 over the two days."

Firstly, we know that the weight of each box is 5,000 pounds or more. Therefore, the total weight of all boxes will be at least 5,000 pounds x number of boxes = 5,000 x n (where n is the number of boxes).
Since the bridge can bear a maximum weight of 1,553 pounds per axle, and there are four axles in total (two for the truck and two for the cargo), the total maximum weight that the bridge can bear is 1,553 x 4 = 6,212 pounds.
Now, let's find out how many boxes can fit in the truck based on their weight and the weight limit of the bridge. We know that the weight of one box is 5,000 pounds or more, so the minimum weight of one box is 5,000 pounds. Since the total weight of all boxes must not exceed the weight limit of the bridge, we can set up the following equation:
6,212 - 1,553 = n(5,000)
Solving for n, we get:
n = 6212 / 5000 = 1.22
Therefore, the truck can carry approximately 1.22 times the number of boxes it would normally carry, given the weight limit of the bridge."

"Response:  The tree has six fruits, and each fruit has 20 seeds. Therefore, there are 6 x 20 = 120 seeds in total. However, some of these seeds may not have fallen off the tree yet, so we need to subtract that number from the total. According to the problem statement, ""every seed is scattered evenly throughout the forest."" This means that every square meter of forest floor contains an equal number of seeds (since the area of the forest floor is much larger than 1 square meter). So, if we assume that the average density of seeds on the forest floor is 1 seed per square meter, then the total number of seeds in the forest is equal to the total area of the forest multiplied by the average density of seeds. Using this calculation, we can estimate the total number of seeds in the forest as follows: Total area of the forest = 67 square kilometers / 100,000 hectares = 0.67 square meters Per square meter of forest floor, there are 1 seed on average, so the total number of seeds in the forest = 0.67 square meters x 1 seed/square meter = 0.67 x 10^8 seeds In conclusion, based on the information provided in the question, there are approximately 67 billion seeds in the forest."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 fruits in total and we have to find out how many of them are good. From the information given, we can conclude that:

* 1 fruit is bad (20%)
* 2 fruits are sour (2%)

So, the number of good fruits = Total fruits - Bad fruits - Sour fruits
= 25 - 2.5 - 2
= 20

Therefore, 20 fruits are good."
Response:  Firstly, Janet bought a breast for $500. Then she sold it to a jewelry maker for $800. After that, she gave you 10% of the profit, which is $80. So the amount of money Janet made from selling the breast is $800 - $500 = $300.
"Response:  If he works for 40 years and then gets $50,000 per year as retirement benefits for 20 years, his total retirement benefit would be:

$50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000

If he continues to work for another 10 years after that, his total retirement benefit would increase by an additional:

$1,000,000 / 10 = $100,000 per year

So, if he retires at age 60 (after working for 30 years), his total retirement benefit would be:

$1,000,000 + ($100,000 x 10) = $1,100,000

Therefore, if he retires at age 60 with 30 years of service, his estimated retirement benefit is approximately $1,100,000."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Alicia paid $140 for one month of TV service in June. So, the total amount she paid for half a year is:
$140 x 6 = $840
Now, we are asked to find out how much Alicia will pay at the end of the year if the media company charges her an extra 10% of the half-yearly fee. Therefore, the total amount Alicia will pay at the end of the year is:
$840 + (10% of $840) = $928
So, the total amount Alicia will pay for the TV service at the end of the year is $928."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Sofia has already driven for 160 miles since her last fill-up and needs to add 4 more gallons of gasoline to continue driving. Based on the car owner's manual, Sofia's fuel tank capacity is 40 gallons. Therefore, we can calculate the distance Sofia can travel with one gallon of gasoline as follows:

Distance = Fuel tank capacity / Number of gallons used
= 40 / 4
= 10 miles/gallon

So, based on this calculation, Sofia can travel approximately 10 miles per gallon of gasoline."

Step 2: Each school has one girls' and one boys' basketball team, with 5 players on each team. Therefore, the total number of players from all 4 schools is: 4 x 5 = 20 (girls) + 4 x 5 = 20 (boys).
Step 3: Since there are 20 girls and 20 boys playing for the 4 schools, the total number of students involved in the competition is: 20 + 20 = 40.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 40."
Response:  We know that there are 175 pearls in total and fewer than 35 red pearls. So, we can conclude that there are more white pearls than red pearls. Now, let's calculate the number of white pearls based on the ratio given in the problem. According to the problem, the number of white pearls is twice the number of red pearls. Therefore, if x represents the number of red pearls, then the number of white pearls would be 2x. Substituting the value of x from the problem, we get 2(35) = 70 white pearls. So, there are 70 white pearls in addition to the 175 red pearls.
Response:  If there are 60 girls and 5 boys in total, then each boy has 12 female classmates (60 / 5 = 12). Therefore, each teacher needs to teach 12 x 6 = 72 students.
Response:  At first, Benny has $100. Then every week, he gets an allowance of $50. So after one week, his new balance is $100 + $50 = $150. After two weeks, his new balance is $150 + $50 = $200, and so on. Therefore, Benny starts with $100 and ends up with $200 in total.

Response:  If Tommy sells 43 pieces of candy and 23 pieces of cheesecake, he will earn $129 in total ($3 x 43) + $86 in total ($4 x 23). So Tommy can earn $215 in total.
Response:  Sheila bought five smartphones at $150 each, totaling $750. The interest rate is 2% per month for three months. To calculate how much she will pay in total, we can use the formula: Total Amount = Principal x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal is $750, and the time is 3 months (or 0.5 years). So, the total amount Sheila will pay is: Total Amount = $750 x 2% x 0.5 = $15. Therefore, Sheila will pay $15 more than the original price of the smartphones.
Response:  If Ati sells 12 yellow flowers for $2.74 each, he will make $32.08 ($2.74 x 12). If he sells 9 red flowers for $1.87 each, he will make $16.53 ($1.87 x 9). And if he sells 17 blue flowers for $2.12 each, he will make $35.34 ($2.12 x 17). Therefore, in total, Ati will make $32.08 + $16.53 + $35.34 = $83.95.
"Response:  If each layer of the sandcastle has an area equal to half the previous layer, then the area of the topmost layer is indeed 16 square feet. To find out how many layers there are, we can divide the total area by the area of each layer. So, if we have a four-layered sandcastle, the number of layers is:

Total area = 16 sq ft / (2 x Area of each layer) = 8 layers

Therefore, there are 8 layers in a four-layered sandcastle."
"Response:  According to the veterinarian, the puppy needs one bowl of dog food per day for the first 180 days, and then it will need two bowls of dog food per day after that. If one bag of dog food contains 110 bowls, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia need in total during the first year?

Solution: To calculate the number of bags of dog food Cecilia needs, we can use the information provided in the question.

Firstly, let's find out how many bowls of dog food the puppy needs per day:

1 bowl/day x 365 days = 365 bowls/year

Since the puppy needs one bowl per day for the first 180 days, the total number of bowls needed during this period is:

180 days x 1 bowl/day = 180 bowls

After the first 180 days, the puppy needs two bowls of dog food per day, so the total number of bowls needed during the remaining 180 days is:

2 bowls/day x 180 days = 360 bowls

Adding up all these numbers gives us the total number of bowls of dog food the puppy needs over the course of its first year:

365 bowls + 180 bowls + 360 bowls = 705 bowls

Now, we know that one bag of dog food contains 110 bowls, so we can divide the total number of bowls by the number of bags per bag to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia needs:

705 bowls / 110 bowls/bag = 6.4 bags

Therefore, Cecilia needs approximately 6.4 bags of dog food over the course of her puppy's first year."
Response:  If Remmon's laundry capacity is half of Sarah's, then Remmon can wash 50 pounds of clothes in one load (since Sarah can wash 100 pounds). David can wash 4 times as much as Sarah, so he can wash 4 x 100 = 400 pounds in one load. Therefore, the difference between Remmon and David's laundry capacities is 400 - 50 = 350 pounds.
"Response:  If Vincent can buy three sets of flowers for $2.50 each or two sets for $1.00 each, and he buys the most expensive flower (which costs $18), then...

Step 1: Calculate how much Vincent spends on flowers in total if he buys three sets.
$3 \times 3 = 9$

Step 2: Calculate how much Vincent spends on flowers in total if he buys two sets.
$2 \times 2 = 4$

Step 3: Compare the amounts from Steps 1 and 2 to find out which option is cheaper for Vincent.
$9 > 4$, so Vincent saves money by buying two sets of flowers instead of three sets.

Therefore, the answer is $4$."

"Response: 
1. Every year, Gene goes on a vacation for one month. Therefore, there are 12 months in a year.
2. Gene starts traveling abroad at the age of 23 and continues until he is 34 years old. This means that he has been traveling abroad for 11 years (from 23 to 34).
3. Since each trip lasts for one month, Gene has taken 11 x 12 = 132 trips abroad during those 11 years (ignoring leap years).
Therefore, the total number of trips Gene has taken abroad is 132."
"Response:  
Greg heard the bell three times a day every day for one week. So, in total, he heard the bell 21 times (3 x 7). 
Now, let's calculate the number of times the bell rang during the second and third times Greg heard it: 
During the second time, the bell rang four times more than the first time, so it rang 4 + 3 = 7 times. 
During the third time, the bell rang as many times as the first two times combined, or 3 + 3 = 6 times. 
Therefore, the total number of times the bell rang during the entire week is: 21 + 7 + 6 = 34 times."
"Response: 
According to the policy, every year, the salary of each employee will be increased by 10%. So if an employee has worked for five years in the company, their annual salary will be increased by 50% (10% x 5 years).
For example, if an employee's annual salary is $60,000, after working for five years, their annual salary will be $90,000 ($60,000 x 1.5 = $90,000).
Now, let's consider Sylvie's case. She just completed her fifth year of work in December last year, so she will receive a 10% increase in her salary this year. Her new annual salary can be calculated as follows:
$90,000 (last year's salary) x 1.10 (10% increase) = $100,000 (this year's salary)
Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary this year is $100,000."
"Response:  According to the question, Maria Lin's first album sold more than 10 times as many copies as Harry's album. If they all sold 88,000 copies in total, then we can calculate the number of copies that each artist sold as follows:

Harry: 88,000 / 10 = 8,800 copies"
"Response:  Since there are 16 friends invited to the party and each friend needs 75 gift bags, we need to calculate how many gift bags Christina will buy in total. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:

16 friends x 75 gift bags per friend = 1,200 gift bags

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost of all the gift bags needed for the party is:

1,200 gift bags x $2 per gift bag = $2,400

Therefore, Christina will spend $2,400 on gift bags for her party."
"Response:  If one adult can eat half a pound of beef, and there are 20 adults and 5 children going to the dinosaur picnic, then the total amount of food needed is:

Adults x Half a pound per person = 20 x 0.5 pounds = 10 pounds
Children x Half a pound per person = 5 x 0.5 pounds = 2.5 pounds
Total amount of food needed = Adult weight + Child weight = 10 + 2.5 = 12.5 pounds
Therefore, Ted needs to bring at least 12.5 pounds of beef for the entire group to have enough to eat."
"Response:  
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, which means Jan has 3 x 3 = 9 pets. 
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, which means Marcia has 2 + 1 = 3 more pets than Cindy. 
So, if Zhen-di has four pets, then Cindy has 4 - 3 = 1 pet. 
Therefore, the total number of pets is 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 pets."
Response:  We know that Amy is older than Jackson by five years and younger than Corey by two years. So, Amy's age is between 5 + 2 = 7 years old. Now, we need to find out how old Jackson is. Since Jackson is younger than Amy by five years, his age is equal to her age minus five years. Therefore, Jackson's age is 7 - 5 = 2 years old. Next, let's consider James. According to the problem statement, James is ten years old, which means he is one year older than Corey. So, Corey's age is nine years old.
"Response:  If Li can run 400 meters in 38 seconds, then his speed is 6.95 meters per second (m/s). Now, if Jerry changes his diet and increases his food intake by 10%, his new running speed will be:

New speed = Old speed x (1 + 0.10) = 6.95 m/s x 1.10 = 7.24 m/s

So, if Jerry runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, he will finish in approximately 35.6 seconds (using the new running speed of 7.24 m/s)."
Response:  If there are 12 times fewer dogs than cats in a community, and there are 60 dogs, then there must be 60 x 12 = 720 cats in the community.
Response:  There are 200 students in total, and we know that there are 4 boys (2 male students). So, the number of girls is 200 - 4 = 196. Therefore, there are 96 female students in the class (196 / 2 = 96).
Response:  Harry slept for 9 hours last night, and his friend James only slept for half of that time (4.5 hours). So, if we subtract the amount of time that James slept from the total time that Harry slept, we get the difference in hours. The difference is 8.5 hours (9 - 4.5 = 8.5). Therefore, Harry slept for more than 8.5 hours than James did.
Response:  When Freda adds sugar to her tea, she uses half of it each time. So if there are 80 grams of sugar in each packet and she uses three packets, then she uses 80 x 3 = 240 grams of sugar altogether. Since Freda has 120 pounds (or 54 kilograms) of sugar at the end, that means she used 54 / 240 = 0.22 or 22% of the total amount of sugar. Therefore, Freda used 22% of the total amount of sugar.
"Response:

"Response: 
Mary has 18 new potted plants and wants to give them away as gifts. She decides to send one plant per window in her house, which means she will have 18 plants to distribute. Since each plant needs at least two windows to grow, Mary will need to find 9 more windows to place the remaining plants (18 - 9 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 extra windows available for placing additional plants."
"Response:  
Step 1: The first friend knocked the door 20 times, and then Jerome opened it. So, the number of times the first friend knocked the door is 20.
Step 2: The second friend knocked the door four times more than the first friend, which means he knocked the door 24 times (20 + 4).
Step 3: The third friend called Jerome twice as many times as the second friend, which means he called Jerome 48 times (24 x 2).
Step 4: If the fourth friend knocked the door six times more than the third friend, which means he knocked the door 6 x 48 = 288 times.
Therefore, if the fourth friend knocked the door 60 times, he knocked the door 60 / 288 = 2.11 times."
"Response: 
Sora wants to read 4 pages from science, 20 pages from social sciences, 7 pages from history, and 8 pages from geography. If Sora reads for 15 minutes per day, we can calculate the number of pages he will read in four days as follows:

Science (4 pages/day x 4 days) = 16 pages
Social Sciences (20 pages/day x 4 days) = 80 pages
History (7 pages/day x 4 days) = 28 pages
Geography (8 pages/day x 4 days) = 32 pages
Total pages read in 4 days = 146 pages
Therefore, if Sora has 4 days to read all of these books, she will need to read an average of approximately 36 pages per day."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, John drinks water every day during his lunch break and before going to bed. He also mentioned that he works Monday through Friday, so he drinks water for 5 days of the week. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of glasses of water John drinks per week as follows:
Glasses of water drunk per day = 3 (lunch + before bed)
Days of the week = 5 (Monday to Friday)
Total number of glasses of water drunk per week = Glasses of water drunk per day x Days of the week = 3 x 5 = 15
So, John drinks 15 glasses of water per week."

1. The city is covered with fog every three miles (or 4.8 kilometers).
2. The distance from the coast to the center of the city is 42 miles (67.6 kilometers).
3. The time it takes for the fog to cover each mile is ten minutes.
Now, let's calculate how long it will take for the fog to cover the entire city:
Time = Distance / Speed
= 42 miles / 10 minutes/mile
= 4.2 hours
Therefore, it will take approximately 4.2 hours for the fog to cover the entire city."
Response:  At first, there are 1000 pieces of puzzle and Poppy will divide them into four equal parts. So, each part has 250 pieces (1000 / 4 = 250). Then, Poppy's mother will take away some pieces from one of the parts to make it smaller. Let's assume that she takes away 1/3 of the pieces in that part, which is 83 pieces (250 x 1/3 = 83). Now, we have three parts with different numbers of pieces: Part A has 250 - 83 = 167 pieces, Part B has 250 - 83 = 167 pieces, and Part C has 250 - 83 = 167 pieces.
Response:  If Amir eats three times as much candy as Cody, and Cody has 30 pieces of candy, then Amir will have 3 x 30 = 90 pieces of candy.

Volume of Box 2 = 5 x 6 x 3 = 72 cubic meters
Volume of Box 3 = 5 x 4 x 3 = 30 cubic meters
Therefore, the total volume of all three boxes is:
Total Volume = Volume of Box 1 + Volume of Box 2 + Volume of Box 3
= 120 + 72 + 30
= 220 cubic meters"
"Response: 
Every day, Frankie watches TV for 1 hour and 30 minutes after finishing his homework.
Monday to Thursday, he watches his favorite TV program for 45 minutes.
Friday, he finishes his homework early and watches two 30-minute TV programs.
So, if Frankie watches TV for 7 hours every day (as stated in the question), how many times will he watch his favorite TV program on Monday to Thursday?
Let X be the number of times Frankie watches his favorite TV program on Monday to Thursday.
We know that Frankie watches this program for 45 minutes each time, so the total duration of watching this program is 45 x X = 1450 minutes.
Since Frankie watches TV for 7 hours every day, the total number of days he watches TV is 7 x 5 = 35 days.
Now, we need to find out how many times Frankie watches his favorite TV program on Monday to Thursday. Since there are 35 days, and Frankie watches this program for 45 minutes each day, the number of times he watches it is 35 / 45 = 78 times."

Response:  The price of one gallon of gasoline is $3 US dollars at this station. If someone buys 20 gallons for $20 US dollars, that means they are getting a discount of $17 per gallon ($3 - $20). So if 10 people buy gasoline here, each person will get a discount of $17 per gallon, and they will pay $34 per gallon ($3 x 10) in total.
"Response:  
Marcel and Beatrice are competing in a fruit-eating contest. They have to eat as many fruits as possible within a certain time frame (in this case, 2 hours). The number of fruits each person can eat is limited only by their stomach capacity. 
The problem states that Marcel ate 2 turns of fruits (which means he ate half of the total number of fruits available) and Beatrice ate 3 turns of fruits (meaning she ate one third of the total number of fruits available). 
To find out how many fruits each person ate in total, we need to multiply the number of turns they ate by the number of fruits available per turn. So for Marcel, if there were x fruits available per turn, then he ate x/2 fruits in total. Similarly, for Beatrice, if there were y fruits available per turn, then she ate y/3 fruits in total. 
Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: x = 24 and y = 14. Therefore, Marcel ate 24/2 = 12 fruits in total, and Beatrice ate 14/3 = 4.67 fruits in total. Since you cannot have a fraction of a fruit, we round up to 5 fruits for Beatrice. 
So, the final answer is: Marcel ate 12 fruits in total, and Beatrice ate 5 fruits in total."
Response:  The boat travels at an angle of 3 meters per second towards the shore. Since there are 20 feet in 1 meter, the distance traveled by the boat during each turn is 60 feet (20 x 3). Therefore, after 8 turns (or 8 x 60 = 480 feet), the total distance traveled by the boat will be 480 + 64 = 544 feet. So, when Julia reaches the shore, the boat has already entered the water to a depth of 544 / 20 = 27 feet.
"Response:  Since there are four teachers and each teacher has two classes per day, the total number of classes is 4 x 2 = 8 classes per day. If each class uses one whiteboard, then the total number of whiteboards used per day is 8 x 1 = 8 whiteboards.
Since the whiteboards are cleaned three times a day, the total number of cleanings per day is 3 x 8 = 24 cleanings per day. Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in one day."
Response:  If Ryan plants two flowers every day in his garden and 5 of them don't open within 15 days, then we can calculate the total number of flowers that have opened as follows: Total number of days = 15 days Total number of flowers planted = 2 x 15 = 30 flowers So, the number of flowers that haven't opened is equal to the total number of flowers planted minus the number of flowers that have opened, which is 30 - 5 = 25 flowers. Therefore, there are 25 flowers in Ryan's garden that haven't opened yet.
Response:  We know that Brittany's phone can hold 6 times more pictures than Jamal's phone. So if Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 x 6 = 10,800 pictures. Now, we need to calculate how many animals are in each picture. If Jamal took 50 pictures of animals at the zoo, and each picture has 50 animals, then there are 50 x 10,800 = 540,000 animals in total in Jamal's pictures.

Firstly, Shasha has $200 worth of wood chips that she wants to sell. Each piece of wood chip costs $10, so there are 20 pieces in total. Therefore, the total value of the wood chips is $200 x 20 = $4,000.
Secondly, Shasha also has a wooden board with dimensions 5 feet by 4 feet by 10 inches, which costs $16 per square foot. Since the board is 5 feet long and 4 feet wide, its volume can be calculated as follows: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 5 ft x 4 ft x 10 in = 200 cubic feet. The cost of this board is therefore $200 / 200 cubic feet = $1 per cubic foot.
Lastly, Shasha has 10 boards in total, each measuring 5 feet by 4 feet by 10 inches. So, the total value of all her wooden boards is $10 x 10 = $100.
Therefore, if Shasha sells all her wood chips and wooden boards together, she will have a total of $4,000 + $100 = $4,100."
"Response:  If Kati uses 7 tea spoons of sugar for every 13 cups of water in her coffee, and she wants to use 120 tea spoons of sugar altogether, we can calculate how many cups of water she will need based on this ratio.
So if Kati wants to use 120 tea spoons of sugar, and she has x cups of water, then the number of cups of water she needs is:
x = (120 / 7) = 17 cups
Therefore, Kati needs 17 cups of water to make her coffee with 120 tea spoons of sugar."

"Response: 
The hospital can receive 500 patients per day and each patient takes an average of 24 minutes to be seen by a doctor. Therefore, the number of patients seen by doctors in one day is:
500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day
Now, let's calculate how much money the hospital makes from seeing patients:
For every minute a doctor spends with a patient, the hospital earns $150 (according to the information given). So, the total amount of money the hospital earns from seeing patients in one day is:
12,000 minutes/day x $150/minute = $180,000/day
Finally, we need to subtract the cost of treating each patient. According to the question, the hospital charges each patient $200 per visit. Therefore, the total cost of treating patients in one day is:
$180,000/day - ($200/visit x 500 patients/day) = $160,000/day
So, the profit made by the hospital after treating all 500 patients per day is:
$180,000/day - $160,000/day = $20,000/day"

Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he reduced his spending by $60, for a total of $440 in those two months combined. So, Joseph spent a total of $940 ($500 + $440) over those two months.
"Response: 
Pam and Fred went to an amusement park together.
Pam sat on two roller coasters, while Fred sat on four.
After that, they decided to alternate turns sitting on the roller coasters.
So, each person would sit twice.
If there are six seats in each roller coaster car, they used how many cars in total?
Let's calculate:
Total number of times Pam sat on the roller coaster = 2
Total number of times Fred sat on the roller coaster = 4
Number of times they alternated = 2 (since they both sat twice)
Total number of times they used roller coaster cars = Number of times Pam sat + Number of times Fred sat - Number of times they alternated
= 2 + 4 - 2
= 6
Therefore, they used 6 roller coaster cars in total."
"Response: 
From the information given in the question, we know that Walter walked 6 miles on Monday and 6 miles on Tuesday. So, his total distance traveled on these two days is:
6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles
On Wednesday, he walked for 41 miles. So, his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is:
12 miles + 41 miles = 53 miles
Therefore, the number of miles Walter walked on Wednesday is:
53 miles / 3 days = 17.67 miles per day"
Response:  Tom washes his car four times a month. Therefore, he washes his car 4 x 12 = 48 times in a year. If each wash costs $15, then Tom spends $15 x 48 = $720 in a year on washing his car.

"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately:
* Two pieces of three-dimensional fish = $7.5 x 2 = $15
* One package of snacks = $1.5
* Two pieces of bread = $1 x 2 = $2
Total cost for items = $15 + $1.5 + $2 = $18
Next, we need to add the transportation fee which is 20% of the total cost:
Transportation fee = $18 x 20% = $3.60
So, the total amount needed to send the goods is:
$18 (total cost) + $3.60 (transportation fee) = $21.60
Finally, if he wants to add an extra $5 as handling fee, that would be:
Handling fee = $5
Total amount needed to send the goods including handling fee = $21.60 + $5 = $26.60"
"Response: 

Step 1 (completing the first test): Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test, which means he completed 1/8 of the total questions in that time frame. Therefore, if there are 75 questions in total, Mark has 75 / 8 = 9.4 questions left to complete after finishing the first test.

Step 2 (completing the second test): Mark took 6 hours to complete the second test, which means he completed 1/6 of the remaining questions. Since there were 9.4 questions left, and Mark completed 1/6 of them, the number of questions left is 9.4 - (1/6) = 14.6 questions.

So, Mark has 14.6 questions left to complete after finishing both tests."
Response:  We know that there are 22 red balls and four times as many blue balls as red balls. So, if we have 12 blue marbles, then there must be how many red marbles?

He spent $3 on eggs, so the cost of eggs is $3.
He spent $3 on sugar, so the cost of sugar is $3.
He spent $3 on tea, so the cost of tea is $3.
He spent $4 on a bowl, so the cost of the bowl is $4.
Total cost = Cost of milk + Cost of eggs + Cost of sugar + Cost of tea + Cost of bowl
= $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4
= $15
Therefore, the total cost of all the items is $15."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Kim will spend on cleaning supplies for each customer. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each bag of laundry detergent costs $5, so the total cost per customer is:

$2 x 2 = $4 (bleach)
$5 x 1 = $5 (laundry detergent)
Total cost per customer = $9
Now, let's assume that Kim has three customers already and she wants to estimate how many more customers she can acquire based on her current income. If each customer pays $9 for cleaning services, then Kim's weekly income from existing customers is:

Weekly income from existing customers = $9 x 3 = $27
To determine how many new customers Kim can acquire, we need to subtract her weekly expenses from her weekly income. Her weekly expenses are:

Weekly expenses = $27 + ($9 x 5) = $36
So, Kim can afford to acquire up to 5 new customers per week, assuming she wants to break even. Therefore, her estimated weekly income from new customers is:

Estimated weekly income from new customers = $36 / 5 = $7.20
Therefore, Lucas will earn approximately $7.20 per week from his cleaning business if he acquires 5 new customers."
"Response:

Step 1: Johnny has 500 Lego bricks to start with.
Step 2: He adds another set of 3 times as many Lego bricks (i.e., 3 x 500 = 1500).
Step 3: He then adds an additional set of Lego bricks that is only one-fourth as many as the previous set (i.e., 1/4 x 1500 = 375).
Therefore, if Johnny can collect all the Lego bricks, he will have a total of 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 Lego bricks."
"Response: 
Debra observed that for every 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive and then return after 6 hours. She wants to know how many bees she sees during this time period.
Let's assume there are x bees in total in the hive at the start of the observation period. Since 30 bees leave every 6 hours, the number of bees left in the hive after 1 hour is x - 30. Similarly, the number of bees left in the hive after 2 hours is (x - 30) / 2, and so on.
After 6 hours, the number of bees left in the hive is (x - 30) / 6. Since half of these bees will fly away again after another 6 hours, the number of bees that Debra sees during her observation period is (x - 30) / 6 + (x - 30) / 6 = 2x / 3.
Therefore, the answer is 2x/3."

"Response: 
Steve lives 3 miles away from school, which means he can ride his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from school, which means he can slideboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. Since both Steve and Tim are traveling to the same location (their homes), we can compare their speeds directly.
To determine who will arrive first, we need to calculate the time it takes each person to reach their home based on their speed. We know that distance = speed x time, so we can set up an equation as follows:
Distance = Speed x Time
For Steve: Distance = 3 miles x 440 ft/min = 1,320 minutes
For Tim: Distance = 2 miles x 264 ft/min = 528 minutes
Now, let's solve for the time it takes each person to reach their home:
Time = Distance / Speed
For Steve: Time = 1,320 min / 440 ft/min = 3 hours
For Tim: Time = 528 min / 264 ft/min = 2 hours
Therefore, Tim will arrive at his home before Steve."
"Response: 
Day 1: 5 people ride bicycles to work and need to inflate their tires. Each person needs $25 to inflate one tire, so the total cost for Day 1 is:
$25 x 5 = $125
Days 2-4: 3 people go past the bike station on each day, but they don't stop to inflate their tires. So, the total cost for Days 2-4 is:
$0 x 3 = $0
Day 5: 1 person stops at the bike station and inflates his/her tire(s), so the total cost for Day 5 is:
$25
Therefore, the total amount of money earned in 5 days is:
$125 + $0 + $0 + $25 = $150
So, the person earned $150 in 5 days."
Response:  If Calvin buys ten boxes of cookies and each box contains six cookies, then he will buy a total of 60 cookies (10 x 6 = 60). Since each cookie costs $0.10, Calvin will spend a total of $6.00 for all the cookies ($0.10 x 60 = $6.00). So, if Calvin uses $10 to buy the cookies, he will get $4.00 change ($10 - $6.00 = $4.00).

Every day, Kimo has three one-hour classes from Monday to Friday. Therefore, he has 3 x 7 = 21 hours of class per week.

On Wednesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 45-minute classes. So, he has 2 x 45 minutes = 90 minutes of class per week on these days.

In total, Kimo has 21 + 90 = 111 hours of class per week."
"Response: 
Step 1 (Initial arrangement): Bill arranges all 300 bread rolls and 120 chocolate bread rolls in a single row. The length of each bread roll is 10 cm, and the diameter of each round bread roll is 20 cm. Therefore, the total length of the initial arrangement is:
L = 300 x 10 cm + 120 x 20 cm = 7800 cm
Time taken to arrange them initially = 0 minutes

Step 2 (Arranging the bread rolls into columns): Now, Bill decides to arrange the bread rolls into columns instead of a single row. He divides the total length of the arrangement into equal parts and places 60 bread rolls in each part. Since there are 300 bread rolls in total, he needs to place them in 5 rows (since 300 / 60 = 5). Therefore, the length of each column is:
L = 5 x 60 cm = 300 cm
Now, let's calculate the time taken for this step:
Time taken to arrange them into columns = 5 x (time taken to arrange one column) = 5 x (time taken to arrange 60 bread rolls) = 5 x 0.2 minutes/bread roll = 1 minute per bread roll
So, the total time taken for Step 2 is 180 minutes (1 minute per bread roll x 60 bread rolls).

Step 3 (Arranging the chocolate bread rolls): Similarly, Bill arranges the chocolate bread rolls into columns after placing the bread rolls. There are 120 chocolate bread rolls in total, so he needs to place them in 5 rows like before. The length of each column is still 300 cm, as it was calculated earlier. Therefore, the time taken for this step is the same as Step 2:
Time taken to arrange them into columns = 5 x 0.2 minutes/chocolate bread roll = 1 minute per chocolate bread roll
So, the total time taken for Step 3 is also 180 minutes (1 minute per chocolate bread roll x "
Response:  The zoo manager needs to buy food for all the monkeys in the zoo every two months. According to the information provided, each monkey requires different amounts of food per month. For example, a small monkey needs 200 grams of food, while a large monkey needs 400 grams per month. To determine how many kilograms of food the zoo manager needs to buy every two months, we can use the following formula: Number of kilograms = Total amount of food required / Period between purchases (in this case, every two months) So, if we calculate the total amount of food required based on the given information, we get: Small monkey: 200 grams x 2 months = 400 grams Large monkey: 400 grams x 2 months = 800 grams Total amount of food required = 400 + 800 = 1,200 grams Now, let's convert the total amount of food from grams to kilograms: 1,200 grams / 1000 = 1.2 kilograms Therefore, the zoo manager needs to buy approximately 1.2 kilograms of food every two months for all the monkeys in the zoo.
"Response: 

Step 1: Blake runs back to the starting point 10 times in 15 minutes (since he has already run 100 meters).
Time taken by Blake = 10 x 15 seconds/run = 150 seconds

Step 2: Kelly starts running and completes 40 meters before deciding not to run with Blake anymore.
Distance covered by Kelly = 40 meters

Step 3: Kelly then runs back to the starting point 34 times in total (including the distance she covered in Step 2).
Total time taken by Kelly = 34 x 15 seconds/run = 510 seconds

Now, let's compare the time taken by both Blake and Kelly:

Blake took 150 seconds to cover 100 meters, which means his speed was 100 meters / 150 seconds = 0.67 meters/second.

Kelly took 510 seconds to cover 40 meters + 100 meters (the distance she ran with Blake), which means her speed was 100 meters / 510 seconds = 0.19 meters/second.

Since Kelly's speed is slower than Blake's speed, it means that Blake won the race. The difference in their speeds can be calculated as follows:

Speed difference = Blake's speed - Kelly's speed = 0.67 meters/second - 0.19 meters/second = 0.48 meters/second.

Therefore, Blake covers the distance of 100 meters in less time than Kelly does, i.e., Blake wins the race by a margin of 0.48 meters/second."

"Response:  If one bag of pearls sells for $20 per month and then increases by 20% every two months, we can calculate the total amount of money earned as follows:

Month 1: One bag of pearls sells for $20, so the earnings are $20 x 1 = $20.

Month 3 (every two months): The price increase is 20%, which means the new price is $20 x 1.2 = $24.

Month 5 (every three months): The price increase is another 20%, which means the new price is $24 x 1.2 = $28.80.

And so on...

Therefore, after n months, the total amount of money earned will be: $20 + ($24 - $20) + ($28.80 - $24) +... + ($x - $20), where x is the number of months since the first sale.

So, to find out how much one bag of pearls would sell for in total, we need to calculate the sum of all these amounts:

$20 + ($24 - $20) + ($28.80 - $24) +... + ($x - $20) =?

Solving for x, we get:

$20 + ($24 - $20) + ($28.80 - $24) +... + ($n - $20) = $20(1 + 0.2 + 0.2^2 +... + 0.2^(n-3))

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$20 \times 1.679 =?

The answer is approximately $33.58. Therefore, if one bag of pearls sells for $20 initially and then increases by 20% every two months, it would sell for around $33.58 after 10 months."

"Response:  If Jackie decides to hire an accountant and saves 3 hours per week (or $35/hour) in lost productivity due to tax preparation work, then the total savings would be:

Total Savings = Number of Hours saved x Hourly Wage Lost
= 3 hours/week x $35/hour
= $105/week

Now, let's calculate the total cost of hiring an accountant over one year:

Total Cost = Total Savings x Number of Weeks in a Year
= $105/week x 52 weeks/year
= $5,460/year

So, if Jackie hires an accountant, he will save $5,460 per year in lost productivity due to tax preparation work."

"Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho travels 20 miles per day. However, on weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he can only cover 10 miles of distance each day. So, in one week, Pancho covers a total distance of:

Weekday distance = 20 miles/day x 5 days = 100 miles
Weekend distance = 10 miles/day x 2 days = 20 miles
Total distance covered in one week = 100 + 20 = 120 miles
Therefore, Pancho can cover approximately 120 miles in one week."

1. The music group wants to replace their old uniform with new ones.
2. Each new uniform includes a hat and an outerwear piece that costs $25 each.
3. The outerwear piece is three times more expensive than the hat.
4. The long pants are priced at the same rate as the hat and outerwear piece.
Now, let's calculate the total cost of one set of new uniforms:
Hat: $25 x 1 = $25
Outerwear piece: $25 x 3 = $75
Long pants: $25 x 1 = $25
Total cost per set: $25 + $75 + $25 = $125
Therefore, the music group will need to pay $125 for each set of new uniforms."
"Response: 
Jake visited the insect museum and saw eighty spiders with eight legs each, ninety insects with six legs each, and three rare and unusual creatures without any limbs at all. How many legs did Jack see in total?
Let's count the number of legs for each group:
* Eighty spiders x 8 legs per spider = 640 legs
* Ninety insects x 6 legs per insect = 540 legs
* Three rare and unusual creatures x 10 legs per creature (since they have ten legs) = 30 legs
Now let's add up the total number of legs Jack saw: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1230 legs."
"Response:  We know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so their ages are as follows:
Granny Red - 3 + 8 = 11 years old
Sally Two - 3 + 8 = 11 years old
Now let's find out the age of Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo:
Sally Four - 2 + 8 = 10 years old
Sally Thirtytwo - 3 + 8 = 11 years old
So, the total age of these four birds is:
Granny Red - 11 years old
Sally Two - 11 years old
Sally Four - 10 years old
Sally Thirtytwo - 11 years old

"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month for her debts.
For student loans, the minimum payment is $300 per month. For credit cards, it's $200 per month. And for mortgages, the minimum payment is $500 per month.
So, if Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum amount each month, she will have to pay an additional amount beyond what is required. To determine this amount, let's use the following formula:
Additional Amount = Total Debt x Desired Percentage / (1 - Percentage)
Total Debt = $10,000 + $8,000 + $6,000 = $24,000
Desired Percentage = 50%
Now, plugging in the values, we get:
Additional Amount = $24,000 x 50% / (1 - 50%)
= $24,000 x 0.5 / 0.5
= $48,000
Therefore, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum amount each month, she will need to pay $48,000 over and above the minimum payments for her debts of $10,000, $8,000, and $6,000 respectively."
"Response:  
1. 比利 needs to cut 60 pieces of potatoes, each piece takes about half a minute (30 seconds). So, in total, 比利 needs 60 x 0.5 = 30 minutes to cut all the potatoes.
2. However, cutting two pieces of potato takes only 5 seconds, as mentioned in the question. Therefore, if 比利 wants to cut all 60 pieces of potatoes, he will need 60 x 5 = 300 seconds or 5 minutes to complete the task.
So, 比利 needs 5 more minutes than what is required for one piece of potato to cut all 60 pieces."
Response:  If Juan and his friends sell water for $3 per bucket, sugar costs $2 per bag, and each bucket holds 1/4 of a gallon (or 32 ounces), then they will need to sell 8 buckets of water to make $25 in profit. So, they will need to sell 8 x 3 = 24 buckets of water in total.

"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the class.
There are 3 candidates running for the position of class president, and each candidate has received 3/4 of the votes. Therefore, there are 3 x 3/4 = 2.25 votes for every student in the class.
So, the total number of votes for all students is 80 (total number of students) x 2.25 (votes per student) = 176.
Step 2: Calculate the number of votes that the losing candidate will receive.
Since the winning candidate has received 3/4 of the votes, the losing candidate will receive 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of the votes.
So, the number of votes that the losing candidate will receive is 80 x 1/4 = 20 votes.
Now we have the total number of votes for both candidates: 176 + 20 = 196 votes."
"Response: 
Sandra wants to receive 4 times as many red flowers as white flowers in her order. If she has already ordered 200 red flowers and there are 100 white flowers, then the total number of flowers in her order is 300 (200 + 100). So, if Fred needs to send at least 5 more bunches of red flowers before 5 pm today, he will need to send 15 bunches of red flowers (300 / 5 = 60)."
Response:  Five years ago, Mark was half as old as Jan, who is now 30 years old. So five years ago, Mark was 15 years old (half of 30). Now, compare Mark's age with Jean's age. Jean is two years younger than Mark, so Jean is currently 17 years old (2 - 2 = 0). Therefore, Jean is 17 years old.
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the time taken by each runner in Team A to complete one lap (400 meters).
Time taken by each runner = Distance / Time taken per lap
= 400 m / 55 s
= 7.2 s/person
Step 2: Calculate the total time taken by all runners in Team B to complete one lap (400 meters).
Total time taken by Team B = Number of runners x Time taken per lap
= 8 runners x 60 s
= 480 s
Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total time taken by Team A and Team B to complete one lap (400 meters).
Difference in time = Total time taken by Team A - Total time taken by Team B
= 480 s - 400 s
= 80 s
Therefore, Team A is ahead of Team B by 80 seconds."
Response:  The probability of getting a number greater than 3 is 1/4 since there are only four numbers greater than 3 in the set {4, 6, 8, 10}. Therefore, the probability of getting a number that is not consecutive with 3 is also 1/4. So, the probability of getting a number that is not consecutive with 3 and greater than 3 is (1/4) \* (3/4) = 1/2 or 50%.
Response:  If Jenna has half of her mother's apples and her mother has 20 apples in total, then Jenna has 10 apples (half of 20). So, if Jenna chooses two apples from the basket, she will have 8 apples left (10 - 2 = 8).

"Response: 
Manley owes $100 to Mandy. They agree that Manley will pay 2% interest every month until he pays off the debt. If Manley pays off the debt in 3 months, how much money does Mandy have to wait for?
Let's break it down:
* Interest per month = 2% of $100 = $2
* Number of months before Manley pays off the debt = 3 months
So, Mandy has to wait for $2 x 3 = $6 before Manley pays off the debt. Therefore, the answer is $6."
Response:  The merchant buys $30 worth of grain from each farmer and sells it for $40 per bag. To calculate how many bags he can sell, we need to subtract the cost of transporting one bag ($2) from the profit he makes per bag ($40 - $2 = $38). So, if he sells each bag at $38, he will make a total profit of $38 x 30 = $1,140.
"Response: 
Firstly, let X be the cost of each theme park ticket (in dollars). Since they bought three tickets together, we can write an equation as follows:
X + X + X = 69.75 (since 3 x $20.25 = $69.75)
Now, we know that they spent $4.50 less than the total cost of the three tickets, so we can subtract this amount from the previous equation to get:
X + X - $4.50 = $69.75
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2X = $65.25 ($69.75 - $4.50)
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we find out that the cost of each theme park ticket is:
X = $32.62 ($65.25 / 2)
Therefore, if the three friends split the cost equally, each person will pay $32.62 for their theme park ticket."

"Response:  
1. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.
2. After one month, her collection increased three times to 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60).
3. In the second month, she collected fewer cards than in the first month, so there were 40 cards left (60 - 20 = 40).
4. In the third month, she received more cards than in the previous two months combined, which is twice as many as in the first two months (4 x 20 = 80).
Therefore, the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has is: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140."
"Response: 
Weekly income of Mark from A Publisher = Number of sentences edited x Price per sentence
= 1000 sentences/week x $0.05/sentence
= $50/week
Now, let's calculate how much money Mark can earn from B Publisher in one week:
Weekly income of Mark from B Publisher = Number of sentences edited x Price per sentence
= 2000 sentences/week x $0.10/sentence
= $200/week
Therefore, Mark can earn $50 + $200 = $250 in one week working for both publishers."
Response:  The man drinks five buckets of water in the morning and six buckets of water in the evening, so he drinks a total of 11 buckets of water per day (5 + 6 = 11). Since each bucket contains 5 liters of water, the man drinks a total of 55 liters of water per day (11 x 5 = 55).
Response:  If John wins $5000 every week and his salary is increased by 5%, then he will win $105 each week (5000 x 1.05). Since there are 52 weeks in a year, John will have won a total of $5300 ($105 x 52) during the year. Therefore, John will have earned $6850 ($5300 + $1550) that year.
"Response: 
Josie has 10 acres of vineyard and each acre can produce 5 bunches of grapes. Therefore, Josie can produce 50 bunches of grapes per acre (10 acres x 5 bunches/acre).
Since each bunch of grapes can produce 2 barrels of wine, Josie can produce 100 barrels of wine per acre (50 bunches/bunch x 2 barrels/bunch).
Now, let's calculate how many barrels of wine Josie can produce in total based on the size of her vineyard:
Total number of barrels of wine = Total number of bunches of grapes x Number of barrels produced per bunch
= 500 bunches (from 10 acres) x 2 barrels/bunch
= 1000 barrels of wine
Therefore, Josie can produce approximately 1000 barrels of wine per year."
"Response: 

1. Calvin eats three sandwiches every day, and each sandwich has two slices of cheese. Therefore, he consumes 6 slices of cheese per day (3 sandwiches x 2 slices/sandwich = 6 slices).
2. Since Calvin starts his day with breakfast at 8 am, he will have one slice of cheese for breakfast (assuming he takes one slice of cheese with his toast or omelette). So, now he has 5 slices of cheese left for lunch and dinner (6 - 1 = 5).
3. For lunch, Calvin adds an extra slice of cheese to his sandwich, making it 3 sandwiches with 4 slices of cheese in total (3 x 2 = 6). Now, he has 9 slices of cheese remaining for dinner (5 + 4 = 9).
4. In the evening, Calvin again adds an extra slice of cheese to his sandwich, bringing the total number of slices of cheese consumed that day to 10 (9 + 1 = 10).

Therefore, Calvin uses 10 slices of cheese throughout the day."

"Response: 
Mickey loves cycling and rides his bike at least five times a week for 25 kilometers each time. He does this every four weeks, which means he cycles a total of 100 kilometers in one month (4 weeks x 5 times/week x 25 km/ride).
Now, Mickey decides to reduce his cycling frequency to twice a week, with each ride being 60 kilometers long. This means he will cycle a total of 120 kilometers in three months (3 months x 2 times/week x 60 km/ride).
Therefore, Mickey has cycled a total distance of 220 kilometers in one year (100 km/month x 12 months)."
Response:  We know that Joe bought 25 pieces of black dragon sweets and each piece contains 80 candies. Each candy weighs twice as much as a pea, so each candy weighs 160 grams (2 x 80 grams). Since there are 40 grams of chocolate in each candy, the total weight of each candy is 200 grams (160 grams + 40 grams). Therefore, the total weight of all 25 pieces of black dragon sweets is 500 grams (200 grams x 25 pieces).
Response:  On Monday, Rosie bought 4 cakes from one store. On Tuesday, she went to another store and bought 3 times more cakes than she bought on Monday, which means she bought 12 cakes (3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times more cakes than she bought on Tuesday, which means she bought 60 cakes (5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, after three days, Rosie has bought a total of 72 cakes (4 + 12 + 60 = 72).
"Response: 

Step 1: Calculate the cost of one plate of rice.
Given that 30 plates are sold for $6,000, we can calculate the cost per plate as follows:
Cost per plate = Total amount / Number of plates = $6,000 / 30 = $200 per plate

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each bowl of soup.
Given that 20 bowls are sold for $1,200, we can calculate the cost per bowl as follows:
Cost per bowl = Total amount / Number of bowls = $1,200 / 20 = $60 per bowl

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all 50 dishes.
Total cost = Cost of 30 plates + Cost of 20 bowls = $200 x 30 + $60 x 20 = $9,600

Therefore, the total cost of all 50 dishes is $9,600."

"Response:  
Red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, so it lays 3 x 7 = 21 eggs in one week. 
White chicken lays 5 eggs per day, so it lays 5 x 7 = 35 eggs in one week. 
In total, Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, which means he collects 42 x 7 = 294 eggs in one week. 
Now, if there are more than two white chickens for every red chicken, we can say that the number of red chickens is equal to the number of white chickens divided by 2. So, if there are n white chickens, there are n / 2 red chickens. 
In this case, Jerry collects 294 eggs in one week, and since each egg comes from a chicken, there are 294 chickens in total. If there are n / 2 red chickens, then there are (n - n / 2) white chickens. 
So, if there are 2 white chickens for every red chicken, there are 2 x 2 = 4 red chickens."
Response:  The park is 6 miles wide and long, so its area is $6 \times 6 = 36$ square miles. If he walks at a rate of $3$ miles per hour, it will take him $\frac{36}{3} = 12$ hours to walk around the entire park.
Response:  On day 1, there were 100 customers at the store. If the number of customers increased by 50 on day 2, then there were 150 customers (100 + 50) on day 2. On day 3, if the total number of customers was 500, then the number of customers on day 3 would be 500 - 150 = 350. Therefore, there were 350 customers at the store on day 3.
Response:  The smaller pool has twice as much water as the larger pool per hour, so the smaller pool loses four times as much water as the larger pool per hour. Therefore, if the larger pool loses $x$ liters of water per hour, the smaller pool loses $4x$ liters of water per hour. Since the smaller pool is half the size of the larger pool, it holds half as much water as the larger pool. So, the amount of water in the smaller pool after one hour is equal to half of the amount of water lost by the larger pool during that time. Thus, we can write an equation: $\frac{1}{2}x = 4x$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 8$. Therefore, there are $8$ liters of water in the smaller pool after one hour.
"Response: 
Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes worth $320.00 and she has to work for 8 hours to earn enough money to buy them. So, she needs to work for:

"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Janet borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10%. If she makes monthly installments of $165 for 12 months, how much will her remaining balance be after 12 months?
To calculate this, we can use the formula:
Remaining Balance = Initial Amount x (1 - Payment Percentage) / Number of Payments
In this case, the initial amount is $2000, the payment percentage is 10%, and the number of payments is 12. So, plugging these values into the formula, we get:
Remaining Balance = $2000 x (1 - 0.10) / 12 = $1487.50
Therefore, after making monthly payments of $165 for 12 months, Janet's remaining balance would be $1487.50."
Response:  We know that there are four flowers in the vase and each flower has more than seven petals. So, if we assume that each flower has eight petals (which is a reasonable assumption), then there will be 4 x 8 = 32 petals in total. Therefore, there are 32 flowers in the vase.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Adrian is three times older than Harry, and Harry is half the age of Zack. So, if Adrian is 21 years old, then Harry must be 3 × 21 = 63 years old.

"Response: 

James has 30 fire cards, 20 grass cards, and 40 water cards in his deck. If he loses 8 water cards, then he has 32 water cards left (40 - 8 = 32).

Next, he buys 14 grass cards. So, his new deck consists of 32 water cards, 14 grass cards, and 20 remaining fire cards.

Now, let's calculate the probability that he will draw a water card when he plays a random card from his deck. Since he has 32 water cards out of 56 total cards in his deck (32/56), the probability is 32/56 or approximately 0.577.

Therefore, the chance that James will draw a water card after losing 8 water cards and buying 14 grass cards is approximately 0.577 or 57.7%."

Chad bought one ""self-made coffee burrito"" for $6.50 and added various toppings such as meat ($2), cheese ($1), avocado ($0.25), and salsa ($0.25). He also received a $5 gift card as change. Therefore, he spent a total of:
$6.50 (burrito) + $2 (meat) + $1 (cheese) + $0.25 (avocado) + $0.25 (salsa) = $9.75
Adding the $5 gift card, Chad had $14.75 in total."
"Response:  
Kalinda can make 4 pieces of puzzle every minute, and her mother usually makes half as many pieces per minute. So, in one hour, Kalinda can make 4 x 60 = 240 pieces of puzzle, while her mother can make 2 x 60 = 120 pieces of puzzle. Therefore, it will take Kalinda 2 hours to complete the puzzle, while her mother will need 1 hour to finish it."
"Response: 

At first, there were 120 watermelons in the farm. (Given)

After Ashlin left for two months, three-quarters of the watermelons were ready to be harvested. (Given)

So, the number of watermelons that were not yet ready to be harvested was 3/4 x 120 = 80 watermelons.

Two weeks later, when Ashlin returned, he found that only 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready to be harvested. (Given)

Therefore, the total number of watermelons that were not yet ready to be harvested after two weeks was 80 + (3/4 x 30) = 80 + 22.5 = 102.5 watermelons."
"Response: 
Mark bought 12 cars from Company A at $20,000 each. That means he spent a total of $240,000 (12 x $20,000).
As for the registration fee, it is $1,000 per car. So, Mark paid a total of $12,000 ($1,000 x 12) for the registration fees.
Therefore, Mark spent a total of $252,000 ($240,000 + $12,000) for buying and registering the 12 cars."
"Response: 
On Monday (week 1), Kaitlyn received 3 more than Robert, so Kaitlyn received 5 + 3 = 8 shells.
On Tuesday (week 2), Kaitlyn received twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so Kaitlyn received 2 x 8 = 16 shells.
Therefore, Kaitlyn collected 8 + 16 = 24 shells in total over the two days."
Response:  If there are 50 insects in the garden after Dax left, and he saw half of them, then there were originally 100 insects in the garden (since half of 50 is 25). So, the total number of insects in the garden before Dax left would be 100 + 100 = 200.
"Response: 
1. There are 36 creatures in the snow.
2. Three-quarters of them (30) jump into the water.
3. Of the remaining quarter (9), three-quarters (7) enter the cave to eat dinner.
So, there are 30 + 7 = 37 creatures left outside."
Response:  Steve eats six portions of tomatoes per day, and each portion is twice as big as his girlfriend's share. So, if his girlfriend eats two portions per day, Steve needs to eat three times as many portions. Therefore, he needs to eat 3 x 6 = 18 portions of tomatoes per day. Since one tomato tree can produce three tomatoes per week, Steve needs 18 / 3 = 6 tomato trees to satisfy his daily demand.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends in total and John wants to make sure each person can have 4 pieces of pizza. If we divide 8 (the number of slices per pizza) by 4 (the number of pieces each friend wants), we get 2. So John needs to buy 2 pizzas.
Response:  If he buys 25 pens and uses each pen to make one big ink bottle, then he will have 25 big ink bottles. After that, if he wants to use these big ink bottles again to make new pens, he can do so because there are still 25 big ink bottles left. So, the total number of pens he will get is 25.
Response:  Firstly, Johnny invested $20 and then he got another $10 as an investment. So in total, Johnny had $30 to invest. After one year, if his investment grew three times, that means he gained $90 ($30 x 3 = $90). Therefore, after one year, Johnny has $120 ($90 + $30).
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and that Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
Mary's age = Jessa's age + 5 - 2
Now we have to find out Jessa's age. According to the problem statement, Jessa is already 30 years old. Therefore, we can substitute Jessa's age (30) into the above equation:
Jessa's age = Jessa's age + 5 - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28
So, Jessa is 28 years old. Now let's calculate the total age of all three women:
Mary's age = 28 + 2 = 30
Joan's age = 30 + 5 = 35
The total age of all three women is 30 + 35 = 65 years."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who will leave through each exit.
Total number of students = Total number of students x Percentage of students leaving through that exit
For Exit A: Total number of students x 30% = 300 students
For Exit B: Total number of students - 300 students (since 30% of students left through Exit A) = 700 students
For Exit C: Total number of students - 700 students (since 40% of students left through Exits A and B) = 400 students
Step 2: Add up the total number of students leaving through all three exits to get the overall total number of students leaving the hall.
Overall total number of students leaving the hall = 300 + 700 + 400 = 1400 students
Therefore, there are 1400 students leaving the hall through one of the three exits."
Response:  According to the problem statement, James has 6 more sweets than Robert. So, if Robert has x sweets, then James has x + 6 = 7x sweets. Now, we are told that John has twice as many sweets as Robert. Therefore, John has 2x = 14 sweets. Finally, we are asked how many sweets John has compared to James. Since John has 14 sweets and James has 7x = 49 sweets, John is ahead of James by 35 sweets (14 - 49).
Response:  If Mulan has two books and Pan Dalor has one book, then if we add them together, they will have a total of 3 books (2 + 1 = 3).
"Response: 
1. The friend sends five letters every week.
2. Each letter is five pages long (a total of 25 pages per week).
3. The friend receives two letters from the other person every day (a total of 140 pages per week).
4. The exchange lasts for six months (a total of 6 x 4 weeks = 24 weeks).
Now let's calculate the number of pages written in total:
Total pages written by the friend = Number of letters received x Number of pages per letter
= 140 pages/week x 24 weeks
= 3,360 pages
Therefore, the friend writes approximately 3,360 pages over the course of six months."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Jason has a monthly plan of 1000 hours.
Secondly, he spends 15 minutes talking to his grandfather every day, which is equal to 90 minutes per week (7 days x 12 minutes/day).
Thirdly, he uses an additional 300 minutes talking to other people throughout the month, which means he has 450 minutes left after subtracting the time spent with his grandfather and other people.
Lastly, if there are 30 days in the month, Jason will have 450 / 30 = 15 minutes remaining at the end of the month. Therefore, the answer is 15 minutes."
Response:  We know that Griffin has 24 pieces of candy and Kyle has 5 pieces of candy. If we double the amount of ginger in Griffin's candy, it will be twice as much as Kyle's candy. So, if Griffin had 27 pieces of candy, then Kyle would have 3 fewer pieces than Griffin, which is 24 - 3 = 21 pieces of candy. Therefore, Griffin has 27 - 21 = 6 more pieces of candy than Kyle.
"Response:  
Step 1: We know that there are four cows in one water tank and three times as many fish in another water tank (i.e., 32 fish). So, we can write this information as:
Four cows + 32 fish = total number of animals in both tanks
Let's call the total number of animals x.
Step 2: Since two water tanks have the same number of fish, if the number of fish in one tank is x, then the number of fish in the other tank is also x. This means that the difference between the number of fish in the two tanks is zero:
x - x = 0
Step 3: Now, let's use the fact that there are four cows in one water tank to find out how many cows are in the other tank:
If there are four cows in one tank, then there are twice as many cows in the other tank:
Two x = 4
So, there are eight cows in the other tank.
Step 4: Finally, we can use the information from Step 3 to find out how many animals are in each tank:
Number of animals in first tank = Four cows + 32 fish = 36 animals
Number of animals in second tank = Eight cows + 32 fish = 40 animals
Therefore, there are 40 animals in the second tank and 36 animals in the first tank."
"Response: 
Jean receives $250 per hour for his work as an animator.
He needs to spend 6 hours every day for 4 weeks to complete one part of the movie.
So, he spends 6 x 4 = 24 hours in total for each part.
Since there are 3 parts in total, he spends 24 x 3 = 72 hours in total for all three parts.
Now, let's calculate how much money Jean earns from working on the movie:
$250/hour x 72 hours = $18,000
Therefore, Jean earns $18,000 for completing the three parts of the movie."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Isabelle spent on the party decorations and gifts for her friends. According to the question, she spent $15 on decorations and $43 on gifts, so the total amount she spent on these items is $58. Next, we need to subtract this amount from the total cost of the party, which was $120. So, the remaining amount that Isabelle needs to pay is $62 ($120 - $58). Now, let's divide this amount among the three guests who attended the party. Since each guest cost $22, Isabelle needs to pay $22 x 3 = $66 to cover the costs of the party. Therefore, the answer is $66.
"Response:  The teacher bought four bags of rice. Each bag weighs 50 pounds (lb). So, in total, the teacher has purchased 200 lb (4 x 50 lb) of rice. Now, if each pound of rice costs $1.50 USD, then the total cost of the rice is:
$1.50/lb x 200 lb = $300 USD
Therefore, the teacher paid $300 for the 200 lb of rice."
Response:  On Monday (Week 1), SoBi ate four times as many cookies as her sister. If SoBi ate 4 \* 8 = 32 cookies, then her sister ate 8 cookies. On Tuesday (Week 2), SoBi ate twice as many cookies as her sister. If SoBi ate 2 \* 8 = 16 cookies and her sister ate 8 cookies, then in total SoBi ate 32 + 16 = 48 cookies. Therefore, SoBi ate 48 - 8 = 40 more cookies than her sister.
