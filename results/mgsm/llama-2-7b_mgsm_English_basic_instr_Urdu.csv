Response:  To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can use the information given in the problem. If Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens, and she gives them 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon, then she will need to give them an additional 30 cups of feed (20 - 15 = 5) in the final meal of the day. Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 30 cups of feed in the evening.
Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we can use the formula: Price of n glasses = (Price of one glass x n) / (n + 1). In this case, the price of one glass is $5 and Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, so... Price of 16 glasses = ($5 x 16) / (16 + 1) = $80 / 17 = $4.71 per glass. Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $4.71 per glass for 16 glasses.
Response:  Toulouse has 80 sheep, Charleston has 160 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.
Response:  To find out how long it will take for Carla to download the file after a restart, we need to calculate the average speed of her internet connection during the time when she was able to use it without interruptions. Let's assume that before the update installation and restart, Carla could download at a rate of 2 GB/minute. After the restart, she resumes the download from the beginning, so the total time taken to complete the download will be longer than before. Therefore, the average speed during this period will be lower than before. Let's say it took Carla x hours to finish the download after the restart. Then, we can calculate the average speed as follows: Average Speed = Total Size / Total Time = 200 GB / (x + 20) Where 'x' is the additional time taken to complete the download after the restart. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Average Speed = 200 GB / (x + 20) = 200 GB / 30 = 6.67 GB/hour Now, since Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute, we can convert the average speed to minutes per hour by dividing by 60: Average Speed (in minutes/hour) = Average Speed (in GB/hour) / 60 = 6.67 GB/hour / 60 = 0.111 GB/minute So, after the restart, it will take Carla approximately 0.111 minutes or 66.7 seconds to download each remaining 1 GB of the file.
Response:  The distance traveled by John during the 4 hours is given by the equation d = (1/3)ht + (1/2)ts, where h is the total time spent driving at a constant speed, t is the total time spent in standstill traffic, and d is the distance traveled. In this case, h = 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours, and t = 2 hours. Plugging these values into the equation, we get d = (1/3)(2 x 60) + (1/2)(2 x 30) = 120 miles. Therefore, John is 120 miles away from his destination at the end of the 4 hours.
Response:  To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular hourly earnings and then add her overtime pay. Her regular hourly earnings are $10 x 40 = $400. Her overtime pay is $400 x 1.2 = $480. So, her total earnings for the week are $400 + $480 = $880.
Response:  To find the total number of downloads for the program over the three months, we need to use the information given in the problem. In the first month, there were 60 downloads. In the second month, there were 3 times as many downloads as in the first month, which is 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. Then, in the third month, there were 30% fewer downloads than in the second month, which is 180 - (30/100) x 180 = 126 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads for the program over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.
Response:  The total cost of the pastries is $497.
Response:  It will take 60 years for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree.
Response:  To find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she had (3/4) x 5 = 3.75 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house. Then, she sold 2 more to the red house, so now she had (3.75 - 2) = 1.75 vacuum cleaners left. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she had (1.75 / 2) = 0.875 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house. Since you said there were 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: 5 = 0.875 + 3.75 + 2. So, Melanie started with 5 + 3.75 + 2 = 11 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, Melanie started with 11 vacuum cleaners.
"Response:  To find out what percentage of the total number of students are enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to add up all the percentages given in the problem.

First, let's calculate the total number of students who are not enrolled in hip-hop dance:

100 - (20/100) = 70

Now, let's calculate the percentage of students who are enrolled in hip-hop dance:

(70/100) x 100 = 70%

Therefore, 70% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
Response:  The profit from purchasing jewelry is $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,375 and the profit from purchasing electronic gadgets is $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,480. Therefore, the maximum profit for the merchant would be $8,480 - $5,375 = $3,105.
Response:  Let's first calculate the distance traveled by each train on the first day: Distance = Speed x Time = 80 miles/hour x 2 hours = 160 miles. Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by each train on the second day: Distance = Speed x Time = 150 miles / hour x 4 hours = 600 miles. So, the total distance covered by Train A is 760 miles (160 + 600), and the total distance covered by Train B is also 760 miles (160 + 600).
Response:  To find Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply the number of hours she works each week by the hourly wage for each job. For teaching, that's 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week. For coaching, it's 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week. Then, we add up these amounts to get Jill's total weekly income: $700 + $450 = $1,150/week. Finally, we multiply this amount by the number of weeks she works in a year (50) to get her annual salary: $1,150/week x 50 weeks = $57,500/year.
Response:  If Claire makes a 3 egg omelette every morning, then she will eat 3 x 28 = 84 eggs in one month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she will eat 84 x 4 = 336 eggs in 4 weeks. Therefore, Claire will eat 336 eggs in 4 weeks.
Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles and the time taken so far is 3 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles + 1 hour for the next 2 miles). So, Marissa's average speed needed to complete the remaining distance of 6 miles is: Average Speed = 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles/hour.

Response:  To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to subtract the cost of all the other items from the total amount she paid. The total cost of all the items is $12 + ($3 x 5) + ($1.50 x 4) = $69. Since Marie paid $50, she must have ordered at least $69 / $8.50 = 8 boxes of pizza.
Response:  To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to add up the cost of each item that she bought. The total cost of the shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50. The total cost of the pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50. The total cost of the shoes is 3 x $42 = $126. So, Mishka spent a total of $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $242 on all her clothing items.

Response:  To find out how many points Mike scored in total, we need to calculate the number of points he scored in each half and then add them up. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he scored a total of 4 x 2 = 8 points in that time period. Then, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes, which is equal to 8 x 1.25 = 10 points. Therefore, Mike scored a total of 8 + 10 = 18 points playing ping pong for 40 minutes.

"Response:  To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the javelin. Let's assume that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for 400 feet (the distance mentioned in the problem). When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin an additional 300 feet (as stated in the problem). Therefore, the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the javelin is:

Maximum distance = 400 + 300 = 700 feet

So, if Polly stands at least 700 feet away from the dragon when holding the sapphire gemstone, she will be able to hit it with the gold javelin even though the dragon's flames are within a distance of 1000 feet."
Response:  The guests took 9 pieces of pie.
Response:  To calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories in a single serving, we need to use the following formula: Calories available for snack = Daily calorie target - Total calories consumed so far. In this case, the total calories consumed so far are 1800, and the daily calorie target is 2000. Therefore, the number of grams of chips you can eat is: Number of grams of chips = (Calories available for snack / Number of servings) x Serving size. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, the number of grams of chips you can eat is: Number of grams of chips = (2000 - 1800) / 5 x 30 = 40 grams. So, you can eat up to 40 grams of chips based on the information provided.
"Response:  To find out how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax, we need to divide the weight of the beeswax by the weight of a single candle. In this case, that would be 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax. So, if Charlie has one pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles.

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the supplies from the revenue generated by the sale of the candles. The total cost of the supplies (beeswax and wicks) is $10.00, and the revenue generated by selling 20 candles at $2.00 each is $40.00. Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $30.00 ($40.00 - $10.00)."
"Response:  To find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

Day 1 (Monday):

* Number of articles written = 5
* Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
* Total time spent writing articles = 5 x 4 = 20 hours

Day 2 (Tuesday):

* Number of articles written = 2/5 x 5 = 4 articles
* Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
* Total time spent writing articles = 4 x 4 = 16 hours

Day 3 (Wednesday):

* Number of articles written = 2 x 5 = 10 articles
* Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
* Total time spent writing articles = 10 x 4 = 40 hours

Total time spent writing articles in the three days = 20 + 16 + 40 = 76 hours."
Response:  To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to subtract the number of Post-it notes she used from the total number of Post-it notes she had. In this case, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse plus the ones she purchased at the store, which is equal to 23 + 80 = 103 Post-it notes. Therefore, there were 103 Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.

"Response:  The time it takes for Tom to get back depends on the distance he traveled during each leg of his journey.

Tom's first leg covers a distance of 3 miles, and he travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour. Therefore, it will take him 3/10 = 0.3 hours (or 18 minutes) to cover this distance.

Tom's second leg covers a distance of 2 miles, and he travels at a rate of 6 miles per hour. Therefore, it will take him 2/6 = 0.33 hours (or 20 minutes) to cover this distance.

Since Tom started his journey at 1 PM and finished at 4 PM, the total time it took him to get back is the sum of these two times: 0.3 + 0.33 = 0.63 hours (or 37 minutes)."
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so if Uriah removes 30 comic books, they will weigh 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds less. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we need to subtract 7.5 pounds from the total weight of the toys to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove. Therefore, he needs to remove 7.5 / 2 = 3.75 toys.
Response:  To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to subtract the total amount earned from repairing truck tires ($60 x 6 = $360) from the total amount earned from repairing car tires ($40 x 12 = $480). Therefore, the difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $360 = $120. So, the mechanic earned $120 more revenue on Friday than he did on Thursday.

Response:  To find out how much Aleena has paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to use the information given in the problem. The streaming company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year (6 months) which is $840 ($140 x 6). Then, it charged her 10% less money on the other half of the year (6 months), which is $720 ($140 x 50%). Therefore, the total amount Aleena has paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $720 = $1560.
"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total amount of gas left in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling it up. In this case, there are 12 gallons of gas left in Sophia's tank, and she has driven 100 miles since last filling it up, so:

distance = (total gas left) / (number of miles driven)
= (12 gallons) / (100 miles)
= 0.12 or 12%

Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 12% of the distance her car can travel on a full tank of gas, which means she can drive around 12 miles on a single tank of gas."
Response:  To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Jim watches TV for 2 hours each time he goes to bed, so he spends 2 x 3 = 6 hours on TV per week. Similarly, he reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he spends 6/2 = 3 hours on reading per week. Therefore, over the course of 4 weeks, Jim spends a total of 6 x 4 = 24 hours on TV and 3 x 4 = 12 hours on reading.

Response:  To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to multiply the number of classes she teaches by the number of students in each class and then multiply that result by the cost per student. So, if she teaches 5 classes on weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday, she will have a total of 5 x 15 + 8 x 15 = 90 classes in one week. And if she charges $15.00 per student, she will make $90 x $15.00 = $1350.00 in one week.
Response:  Kelian has to read a total of 40 instructions to prepare both dishes.
Response:  Tommy raises $105.
Response:  To find out how much Sheila will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then subtract the amount she paid as down payment. The formula for calculating the monthly installments is: M = P / (1 - r)^n, where M is the monthly installment, P is the purchase price, r is the annual interest rate divided by 12, and n is the number of months. In this case, the purchase price is $150 x 5 = $750, the annual interest rate is 2/12 = 0.02, and the number of months is 3. So, the monthly installment for Sheila would be: M = $750 / (1 - 0.02)^3 = $68.75 per month.
Response:  Artie will make $35.60 in total.
Response:  The average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle is 8.
Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs during that time. The formula is: Total cups = (Days x Cup per day) + (Remaining days x 2 Cups per day). In this case, Days = 180, Cup per day = 1, and Remaining days = 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, Total cups = (180 x 1) + (185 x 2) = 370 + 370 = 740 cups. Since there are 110 cups in each bag, Cecilia will use 740 / 110 = 6.7 bags of dog food in the first year.
Response:  To find the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David, we need to first find out how much laundry Sarah does. Since she does 4 times as much laundry as David, Sarah does 4 x 200 = 800 pounds of laundry. Now, since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, he does half of 800 = 400 pounds of laundry. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 400 - 200 = 200 pounds.
Response:  To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of 18 flowers at each price. If he buys 18 flowers in a package of 3, it will cost him $2.50 x 6 = $15. If he buys 18 flowers in a package of 2, it will cost him $1 x 9 = $9. So, he saves $6 ($15 - $9).

"Response:  To find the number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of rows x the number of blocks per row. Since every shirt represents one block, we can multiply the number of years by the number of shirts per year. Then, we add up all these numbers to get the total number of quilt blocks.

1. Number of rows = 4 (since Gene goes on four vacations a year)
2. Number of blocks per row = 1 (since each shirt represents one block)
3. Total number of years = 11 (from age 23 to age 34)
4. Total number of shirts = 48 (one shirt per year)
5. Total number of quilt blocks = 4 x 11 x 48 = 1904

Therefore, Gene has 1904 quilt blocks in total."

Response:  To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to divide the total number of copies sold by 10. So, if Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, and they sold a total of 88,000 copies, then Harald sold 88,000 / 10 = 8,800 copies.
Response:  To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags she will need. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, she will actually need (16 x 0.75) = 12 gift bags. So, she will spend $2 x 12 = $24 on gift bags.
"Response:  To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we can use the information provided in the problem. We know that each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and each child will eat half as much as an adult. Therefore, if there are 20 adults and 5 children attending the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed is:

20 x 10 = 200 pounds (for adults) + 5 x 5 = 25 pounds (for children) = 225 pounds

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure that everyone has enough to eat."

Response:  Gerald's new running time for the 400-meter hurdles is 35 seconds.
"Response:  The answer to this problem can be found by using the information given in the question. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The number of rabbits pets = 12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, if the combined number of pet dogs and cats is x, then the number of rabbits pets is x - 12.
2. There are two cats for every dog, so if there are x dogs, there are 2x cats.
3. The number of dogs is 60, so the number of cats is 2x = 120.
4. Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is x + 120 = 180.

So, there are 180 pets in the neighborhood, including both dogs and cats."

Response:  To find out how much each person ate on average, we need to divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people participating in the contest. In this case, there were 36 fruit roll-ups (24 + 12). Since Beatrice had twice as many roll-ups as Marcell, she ate half as much as Marcell. So, Beatrice ate 18 roll-ups on average (36 / 2 = 18) and Marcell ate 30 roll-ups on average (36 / 1 = 30).
Response:  To find how much water the boat had taken on, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows back towards shore. So, if Julia rowed 20 feet (which is equal to 1/5 of the distance to shore), then the boat took on 2 x 20 = 40 liters of water. Since there are 64 seconds between Julia and the shore, we can divide the amount of water taken on by the time it took to take on that water to find out how much water the boat took on per second: 40 liters / 64 seconds = 0.63 liters per second. Therefore, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on approximately 0.63 x 64 = 39.84 liters of water.

Response:  Ryan has 30 flowers in his garden after 15 days (2 x 15 = 30).
Response:  To find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so if Brittany's phone can hold 50 photographs, then Jamal's phone can hold 50 x 6 = 300 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, this means that he has taken 1800 - 300 = 1500 photographs of ducks at the zoo. Therefore, there are 1500 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.
"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she sold and then subtract that amount from the total revenue she received. Let's do this step by step:

Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x 2 x 4 = $80
Total cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 16 x 4 = $64
Total cost of all lumber = $80 + $64 = $144

Revenue from selling 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 x 10 = $100
Revenue from selling 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $16 x 5 = $80
Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $144 = $36

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $36 from selling all of her leftover lumber."
Response:  To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to divide the total amount of sugar (120 teaspoons) by the ratio of sugar to water (7:13). So, we can calculate that Katy used 84 teaspoonfuls of sugar (120 / 7 = 84).
Response:  John paid a total of $180.
"Response:  To find out how many containers were imported on the second day, we need to subtract the number of containers that contained 5 vehicles from the total number of containers that arrived on the second day. Let's assume that the number of containers that arrived on the second day is x. Then, we can write the equation as follows:

x - (2 \* 5) = 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40

Therefore, 40 containers were imported on the second day."
Response:  To find out how much Adrien and Lylah were earning four years later, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Adrien's salary is currently 40% higher than it was four years ago, which means that if he was earning $40000 four years ago, he is now earning $56000 ($40000 x 1.4). Similarly, since Lylah's salary is 30% lower than Adrien's, she is earning $56000 / 0.7 = $80000. Therefore, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is $56000 + $80000 = $136000.
Response:  To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to divide the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so Miguel uses 2 pads of paper x 4 weeks = 8 sheets of paper per month.

"Response:  To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital during each day. We can do this by multiplying the number of patients seen per day (500) by the average time spent with each patient (24 minutes). This gives us a total revenue of $500 x 24 = $12,000 per day.

Now, let's calculate the cost incurred by the hospital on providing medical services to these patients. Since the doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital, and the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, the total cost incurred by the hospital would be $150 + $200 = $350 per hour. Multiplying this by the number of hours worked by the doctors (8 hours/day) gives us a daily cost of $350 x 8 = $2,800.

So, the profit made by the hospital per day would be $12,000 - $2,800 = $9,200."

Response:  To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to add up all of the items she is ordering. The sub sandwiches are $7.50 each, so two of them would be $15.00. The bags of chips are $1.50 each, so two of them would be $3.00. The cookies are $1.00 each, so two of them would be $2.00. The delivery fee is $20%, or $1.50 per item, times the total cost of the order, which is $48.50 (($15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00) x 2). So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $61.50 ($48.50 + $13.00).

Response:  To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends playing video games by his hourly wage from his part-time job. If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day and works for 4 hours per day (for a total of 6 hours), then he will have worked for 42 hours in one week (7 days x 6 hours/day). If he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, then he will have earned $420 in one week ($420 = $10/hour x 42 hours).
Response:  The total cost of the items after the 10% tax on non-food items would be $8 + $9 + $12 + $15 = $64.
Response:  To find out how much profit Lucas will make each week, we first need to calculate his total income for the week. His total income per week is $92. Then, we subtract his total expenses (the cost of two bottles of bleach and five packs of cloths) from his total income. Total expenses = $10 (2 x $2 + 5 x $5). So, profit = $92 - $10 = $82. Therefore, Lucas will make $82 in profit each week.
Response:  John can harvest 1000 pineapples within a year.
"Response:  To find out how many Legos Johnny picked up, we need to add the number of pieces in each Lego set that he picked up. Let's do that:

Set 1 (500 pieces): Johnny picked up 500 pieces from this set.
Set 2 (3 x 500 = 1500 pieces): Johnny picked up 1500 pieces from this set.
Set 3 (1/4 of 500 = 125 pieces): Johnny picked up 125 pieces from this set.

So, altogether, Johnny picked up 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2175 pieces of Legos!"
Response:  The number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is equal to half of the original number of bees that left the hive plus twice the number of bees that left after Debra started observing them.

Response:  James has 48 Facebook friends.
Response:  To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance between Steve's house and the school is 3 miles (1.6 km). Since Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, his speed is 440 feet/minute. Now, we need to find out how long it takes for Tim to cover the same distance on his skateboard. We know that Tim can move at a speed of 264 feet per minute, so he covers half the distance in the same time as Steve. Therefore, the time taken by Tim to cover 1 mile (which is half the distance) is: Time = Distance / Speed = 1.6 km / 264 ft/min = 6 minutes. So, if Steve starts the race first, he will reach his house after 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 7 minutes. If Tim starts the race second, he will take 6 minutes to cover the same distance, and then an additional 3 miles / 264 ft/min = 12 minutes to reach Steve's house, making him wait 12 - 6 = 6 minutes for Steve to arrive.
Response:  To find out how much money Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the cost of inflating each tire and then multiply it by the number of tires inflated. For the bicycles, each tire costs $0.25, so 5 tires x $0.25 = $1.25. For the tricycles, each tire costs $0.25, so 3 tires x $0.25 = $0.75. And for the unicycle, since there is only one tire, it costs $0.25. So, in total, Shawnda made $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25 that day.
Response:  Carl will receive $9 in change.

"Response:  To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he attends classes per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Weekly hours = (3 x 1 hour/day) + (2 x 2 hours/day) = 7 hours/week
Total hours in a semester = Weekly hours x Number of weeks in a semester = 7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 112 hours attending classes in a semester."

Response:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring an accountant, we need to subtract the cost of the accountant from the lost income due to doing her own taxes. In this case, the cost of the accountant is $90 and the lost income due to doing her own taxes is $35/hour x 3 hours = $105. So, by hiring an accountant, Jackie will save $105 - $90 = $15.
Response:  To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the cost of all the accessories from her total budget. The total cost of the accessories is €688 (€157 + €74 + €102). Subtracting this amount from her total budget of €1500 gives us €812. So, Elvira will have €812 left for her clothing.

Response:  Each uniform costs $75 (3 x $25 + $25).
Response:  To find out how many legs Jake sees, we need to add up the number of legs on all the creatures he saw. The spiders have 8 legs each, so that's 8 x 80 = 640 legs from the spiders alone. The insects have 6 legs each, so that's 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. And there are 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 legs from those. So, in total, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
Response:  The total age of the four birds is 30 + 24 = 54 years.
Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month first. The total monthly payment for Jessica's debts are: Student Loan = $300 + (50% x $300) = $450 Credit Card = $200 + (50% x $200) = $300 Mortgage = $500 + (50% x $500) = $750 Therefore, Jessica pays a total of $1500 per month ($450 + $300 + $750). Now, to find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 x 12 = $18,000 So, Jessica pays $18,000 in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts.
Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes him to prepare one potato. So, if it takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato (1.5 minutes), and he needs to do this 60 times, it will take him 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes to prep all the potatoes.
Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to subtract the amount of money they earned from the total amount they spent. In this case, they earned $25 in profit and spent a total of $3 x 20 = $60 on lemons. So, they spent $60 on lemons.

"Response:  To determine the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team for all four legs of the relay race. Let's do that:

Team A: Each member runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, so their total time = 4 x 55 = 220 seconds.

Team B: Their first runner takes 60 seconds to complete their leg, which means their second runner has to cover the remaining distance in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. Their third runner covers the same distance in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and their fourth runner completes it in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. Therefore, Team B's total time = 4 x (57 + 54 + 51 + 50) = 242 seconds.

Now, let's find out who wins by how much:
Time difference = Total time of Team A - Total time of Team B = 220 - 242 = -22 seconds.

So, Team A wins by 22 seconds."
"Response:  To determine the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to find the number of ways this can happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes. There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since Jerry has already rolled a 6, there are only 5 remaining possibilities for his next roll: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is 5/6 = 0.83 (or 83%).

Now, let's calculate the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so there are 3 possible combinations of two even numbers that Jerry could roll in a row. The probability of this happening is therefore 3/6 = 0.50 (or 50%)."

Response:  John collects 60 peaches (2 peaches/minute x 3 hours = 60 peaches).
Response:  To calculate the number of pounds of insects that the duck needs per day, we must divide the total amount of insects needed by the number of days in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total amount of insects needed (3.5 pounds) by 7 to get the daily amount: 3.5 pounds / 7 = 0.5 pounds per day. Therefore, the duck needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day.

Response:  Elaine has 160 Pokemon cards in total.
Response:  To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Publisher A pays him $0.05 per sentence, Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher A, so he makes $50 ($0.05 x 1000) per week from Publisher A. Similarly, since Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher B (since Publisher B pays him $0.10 per sentence), so he makes $50 + $25 = $75 per week from Publisher B. Therefore, Mark makes a total of $125 per week ($50 + $75).
Response:  Baldur gets 5 x 2 = 10 liters of water every day.
Response:  John made $104,000 that year ($2000 x 52 weeks + $5000 award).
Response:  To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of acres she has by the amount of grapes produced per acre. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes, and there are 2 barrels of wine made from each ton of grapes, we can calculate the total number of barrels of wine as follows: Number of barrels of wine = Total number of tons of grapes x Number of barrels of wine per ton of grapes Total number of tons of grapes = Number of acres x Number of tons of grapes per acre Total number of barrels of wine = Total number of tons of grapes x Number of barrels of wine per ton of grapes = 10 acres x 5 tons/acre x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year. Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"Response:  To find out how many kilometers Michael did in total, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during each period of his biking activity.

During the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week and made 25 kilometers each time, so he traveled a total distance of:

5 x 25 = 125 kilometers per week

Since he did this for 4 weeks, the total distance he traveled during this period is:

125 km/week x 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the next three weeks when he rode his bike only twice a week but for longer distances:

He rode his bike for 60 kilometers each time, so he traveled a total distance of:

2 x 60 = 120 kilometers per week

Since he did this for 3 weeks, the total distance he traveled during this period is:

120 km/week x 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

Adding up the total distance traveled during both periods, we get:

500 km + 360 km = 860 kilometers

Therefore, Michael traveled a total distance of 860 kilometers."

Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and doing chores. Let's start by calculating the amount of money Sara will make from babysitting: 4 x $5 = $20. Now let's add that to the $10 she already has: $10 + $20 = $30. So now Sara has $30 in total. Next, let's calculate the cost of the jacket and shoes: $30 / $20 = 1.5 times. That means Sara needs to mow the lawn 1.5 times to afford the jacket and shoes. Since you cannot divide a number by a fraction (like 1.5), we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2. Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn twice to afford the jacket and shoes.

$352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt."

Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle. For the crossword puzzles, it took her 10 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 10 x 3 = 30 minutes solving those puzzles. For the sudoku puzzles, it took her 5 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 5 x 8 = 40 minutes solving those puzzles. Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

Response:  To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, we need to calculate the total time each of them used the boat or raft. For Carlos, he used the canoe for 3 hours, so his cost is $30 x 3 = $90. For Benji, he used the raft for 5 hours, so his cost is $18 x 5 = $90. Therefore, together they will pay $90 + $90 = $180 for their rentals.

Response:  To find out how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to know how many pieces are in the puzzle and how quickly they can work together. If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, then they can place 2 pieces per minute together. Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, it will take them 180 minutes (or 3 hours) to complete it.
Response:  After two weeks, 70 melons were left unharvested.
"Response:  To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars first. The total cost of 12 cars is:

$20,000 x 12 = $240,000

Then, Mark pays 10% tax on the total cost of the cars, which is:

$240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000

And then he pays an additional $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars, so the total amount he pays for registration is:

$24,000 + (12 x $1000) = $36,000

Therefore, Mark pays a total of:

$240,000 + $24,000 + $36,000 = $290,000

So, Mark pays $290,000 for everything."
Response:  Kylie collects 35 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to multiply the number of ants by 2. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, the number of bugs is also half of 50, which is 25. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 25 + 25 = 50.
Response: 24
Response:  To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he will have in one week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, he will have 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes in one week. Now, since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, Steve will need 42 / 3 = 14 vines to grow all the tomatoes he wants. Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines to grow enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.
Response:  John needs to order 5 pizzas.
"Response:  To find out how many pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the amount of ink available after mixing all the empty pens. Since each pen has 0.7 ml of ink, the total amount of ink available is:

5 x 0.7 = 3.5 ml

Now, since Ram mixes the ink from 5 pens, he will have 3.5 ml of ink for every 1 pen he makes. So, if he makes 25 pens, he will have:

3.5 ml / 1 pen = 3.5 ml per pen

Therefore, Ram gets to have 25 x 3.5 ml = 87.5 ml of ink."

"Response:  According to the given information, the total number of students = 1000. Now, let's analyze each part of the question separately:

Part 1: After the meeting, 30% of the students went out of the building through exit A. So, the number of students who went out through exit A = (30/100) x 1000 = 300.

Part 2: Of the remaining students, 3/5 went out through exit B. So, the number of students who went out through exit B = (3/5) x (900 - 300) = 450.

Part 3: Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is equal to the remaining students, i.e., (900 - 300 - 450) = 150.

So, the final answer is 150 students went out through exit C."

"Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to first calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Since each person sends 2 letters per week and each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages Mike writes per week is:

5 x 2 = 10 pages/week

Next, we need to divide this number by the time it takes him to write one page (which is 1 minute). So, the number of hours Mike spends writing per week is:

10 pages/week / 1 min/page = 10 hours/week

Therefore, Mike spends 10 hours per week writing letters to his pen pals."
Response:  Jason has 700 minutes left for the rest of the month (1000 - 300 = 700).
Response:  Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries.
Response:  Let's assume that the number of fish in the first aquarium is x. Then, the number of fish in the second aquarium is 2x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can write: 4 - 2x = 32. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So, there are 8 fish in the first aquarium and 16 fish in the second aquarium.
"Response:  To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup services over the duration of the movie shoot.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours of makeup application per week:
4 days x 6 hours/day = 24 hours/week

Next, let's multiply the total hours by the hourly rate of the makeup artist:
$250/hour x 24 hours/week = $6,000/week

Since the movie shoot lasts for 5 weeks, the total cost of makeup services comes to:
$6,000/week x 5 weeks = $30,000

Finally, after the movie is finished, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, so the final cost that Jean pays is:
$30,000 x (1 - 0.10) = $27,000

Therefore, Jean paid $27,000 for the makeup services during the movie shoot."
Response:  Each person paid $70.
Response:  The chef spent a total of $600 ($1.50 x 4 bags = $600).
"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to first calculate the total number of calories that each girl ate over the two days. Let's do this by multiplying the number of cookies they ate each day by the number of calories in one cookie (which is 200). Then, we can subtract the total number of calories that her sister ate from the total number of calories that Sue ate to find out how many more calories Sue consumed. Here are the calculations:

Sue:
Monday: 4x = 800 (cookies) x 200 = 1600 calories
Tuesday: 2x = 1000 (cookies) x 200 = 2000 calories
Total: 1600 + 2000 = 3600 calories

Her Sister:
Monday: 5 cookies x 200 = 1000 calories
Tuesday: 13 cookies x 200 = 2600 calories
Total: 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories

Now, let's subtract the total number of calories that her sister ate from the total number of calories that Sue ate to find out how many more calories Sue consumed:
3600 - 3600 = 0 calories

So, Sue did not consume any more calories than her sister over the two days."
