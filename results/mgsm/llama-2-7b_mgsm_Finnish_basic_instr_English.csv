Explanation:
Carlos invests $90 in planting an apple tree. Each year, the tree produces 7 apples that he can sell for $1.5 each. The cost of caring for and maintaining the tree is $3 per year. To calculate how long it will take for Carlos to start making money from the tree, we need to subtract the initial investment ($90) from the total revenue generated by the tree over its lifetime (7 x $1.5 = $10.5). This means that after 4 years, Carlos will start making a profit from the tree."

Explanation:  To calculate the profit, we need to compare the value of the two options and choose the one that will give the highest profit. The value of the first option is $5000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5250, while the value of the second option is $8000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8400. Since the value of the second option is higher than the first option, it would be more profitable for the merchant to choose the electronics. Therefore, the profit would be $8400 - $5250 = $375."

3/5 = 0.6 liters
Now we know that the mixture originally contained 10 liters of apple juice and 0.6 liters of pineapple juice, for a total of:
10 + 0.6 = 10.6 liters
When you add 15 liters of water to this mixture, the total volume becomes:

Explanation:
Günter asks his friends how many bottles of beer are in each box. One friend says there are 80 bottles in each box. Another friend says that there are 20 more bottles than half of the first friend's answer. The third friend says that there are 25% more bottles than the first friend's answer.

Let x be the number of bottles in each box. Then we have:

* Half of the first friend's answer = 4x (since 80 is half of 160)
* Second friend's answer = 20 + 4x
* Third friend's answer = 1.25x (since 25% is equal to 1.25 times the original value)

Now we can solve for x using linear equations:

4x + 20 = 140... (1)
1.25x = 140 - 4x... (2)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 140 / 3 = 46

Therefore, the average estimate of the number of bottles in each box is 46."

"Response:  The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 320. Here's how we arrive at this answer:

Let's first calculate the total weight of the truck and its load:
Truck weight = driver + empty truck = 1760 kg
Total weight of load = number of boxes x weight of each box = 5 kg/box x number of boxes = 5000 kg (given)
So, the total weight of the truck and its load is 1760 kg + 5000 kg = 6760 kg.
Now, let's find out what percentage of the bridge's capacity the total weight of the truck and its load represents:
Percentage of capacity used = total weight / bridge capacity = 6760 kg / 5000 kg = 133%
Since the bridge cannot handle more than 5000 kg in weight, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:
Maximum number of boxes = bridge capacity / total weight of truck and load = 5000 kg / 133% = 380 boxes
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 380."

= 0.5 liters

Therefore, there were 0.5 liters of water in the boat when it reached the shore."

Explanation:  According to the information provided in the question, Kim has three existing customers who pay her $2 each for two bottles of cleaning solution and $5 each for five packs of cleaning cloths, totaling $3 x 3 = $9. Additionally, she is trying to sell her services to five potential customers, each of whom will also need two bottles of cleaning solution and five packs of cleaning cloths, at a cost of $2 x 5 = $10 and $5 x 5 = $25 respectively. Therefore, the total revenue generated by Kim's business is $9 + $10 + $25 = $44. Subtracting her weekly expenses of $92 leaves her with a profit of $44 - $92 = -$58.

Explanation:
Johnny has thrown 500 Lego bricks onto his room floor, which means he has 500/3 = 166 remaining bricks left in the original bag. Since there are 4 times as many bricks in the second bag (3 x 500 = 1500), Johnny now has 166 + 1500 = 1666 bricks total. Therefore, Johnny has collected 1666 - 500 = 1166 bricks."

"Response: 350 banaania  
Explanation: To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to buy for two years, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the primates in one year and then double it since they will need twice as much food for two years. The total number of bananas required by all the primates in one year is calculated by multiplying the number of each species' daily requirement (given in the question) by 365 days in a year. For example, the gorillas require 400 bananas per day, so their annual requirement is 400 x 365 = 146,000 bananas. Similarly, the other two species have annual requirements of 78,000 bananas (for the chimpanzees) and 29,000 bananas (for the paviant). Therefore, the total annual requirement for all three species is 146,000 + 78,000 + 29,000 = 253,000 bananas. Since they will need twice as much food for two years, the total number of bananas needed is 253,000 x 2 = 506,000 bananas."

Therefore, the marble will cost $48 after 36 months."
Response: 12 dollars. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the total value of all the toys is equal to $5 + $4 = $9. Since there are 5 red cars and 3 action heroes, each red car is worth $9 / 5 = $1.80, and each action hero is worth $9 / 3 = $3.00. Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $1.80 x 5 = $9.00 + $3.00 x 3 = $9.00 + $9.00 = $18.00.

"Response:  $1684.75

Explanation:
Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum amount for her loans each month. Let's assume she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum amount. For her student loan, the minimum payment is $300 per month, so 50% more would be $450 per month. For her credit card debt, the minimum payment is $200 per month, so 50% more would be $300 per month. And for her rent, the minimum payment is $500 per month, so 50% more would be $750 per month. Therefore, Jessica will have to pay $450 + $300 + $750 = $1684.75 per month to meet her goal of paying 50% more than the minimum amount."

Explanation:
Kauppias paid $2 for each bag of wheat that he bought from the farmer, so he made a profit of $2 per bag. Since he bought 20 bags in total, his total profit was $40 ($2 x 20 = $40).
If he sold all 20 bags at a price of $30 each, he would have made a total revenue of $600 ($30 x 20 = $600). Therefore, his profit is equal to the difference between his revenue and cost, which is $400 ($600 - $200 = $400)."

If he continued this pace for four weeks, he would have covered a total of 490 km (125 x 4 = 490). However, after three weeks, he decided to reduce his cycling frequency to twice a week and increase the distance he covered each time by 30%, from 25 km to 37.5 km. So, in the third week, he covered a total of 180 km (3 x 37.5 = 180). Therefore, the total distance Michael traveled during the entire period is 490 + 180 = 670 km."

"Response: 769

Explanation:
Let's analyze the situation:

* Initial number of students in the school = 1000
* Number of exits (entrances) in the school = 3 (A, B, and C)
* After the meeting, 30% of the students left through exit A, which means 300 students left through that exit.
* Remaining 700 students went out through either exit B or exit C. Since there are 2 remaining exits, each student has a probability of 1/2 to go out through any of them. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit B is 700 x 1/2 = 350, and the number of students who went out through exit C is 700 x 1/2 = 350.
* So, the total number of students who left the school through all three exits is 300 + 350 + 350 = 1000.

Now, let's find the number of students who left through exit C:

Number of students who left through exit C = Total number of students who left the school - Number of students who left through exit A - Number of students who left through exit B
= 1000 - 300 - 350
= 769

Therefore, the answer is 769."
