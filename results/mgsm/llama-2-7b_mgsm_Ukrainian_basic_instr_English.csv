She also feeds her chickens in three separate portions - 15 bowls in the morning, 25 bowls in the afternoon, and 30 bowls at night. Therefore, the total number of bowls of food that Wendy needs to give to her chickens per day is:

15 + 25 + 30 = 70
So, Wendy needs to give her chickens 70 bowls of food per day if she has 20 chickens in her flock."

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* In Toulouse, there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston. So, if there are x sheep in Toulouse, there are 2x sheep in Charleston.
* In Charleston, there are 4 times as many sheep as in Seattle. So, if there are y sheep in Charleston, there are 4y sheep in Seattle.
* In Seattle, there are 20 sheep.

Now, let's find out how many sheep each city has individually and then add them up to get the total number of sheep for all three cities together:

Toulouse: 2x = 2 \* 150 = 300 sheep
Charleston: 2x = 2 \* 60 = 120 sheep
Seattle: 20 sheep
Total number of sheep for all three cities: 300 + 120 + 20 = 238 sheep."

Explanation:
John started his journey at 3 pm with a speed of 60 mph for the first 2 hours (or 60 + 60 = 120 minutes). During this time, he traveled a distance of 120/60 = 2 miles per minute or 120 miles total.
From 2-4 pm, John's speed decreased to 30 mph for half an hour (or 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles), so he traveled a total distance of 15 + 2 = 17 miles during this period.
Finally, from 4-6 pm, John's speed increased to 80 mph, and he traveled a distance of 80 x 2 = 160 miles in those two hours. Therefore, after 4 hours of driving, John had covered a total distance of 17 + 160 = 177 miles away from home."

Explanation:
If Eliza works for 40 hours at $10 per hour and receives overtime pay of 1.2 times her normal hourly rate, then she earns:

Normal hourly wage = $10/hour
Overtime hourly wage = $10 x 1.2 = $12/hour
Total hours worked = 40 hours
Total amount earned = Total hours worked x Normal hourly wage + Total hours worked x Overtime hourly wage
= 40 hours x $10 + 40 hours x $12
= $400 + $480
= $880
Therefore, Eliza earned $880 that week."

Explanation: To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to break even on his investment in the lemon tree, we need to subtract the initial cost of planting the tree from the total revenue he will generate over time. The initial cost is $90 (for planting the tree), and the total revenue is $7 \times 10 = $70 (from selling 7 lemons per year at $1.5 each). Therefore, the number of years it will take to break even is:
Years to break even = Initial cost / Total revenue
= $90 / $70
= 4 years
Therefore, Carlos will need 4 years to recoup his initial investment in the lemon tree."

"Response: 36 liters
Explanation: Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The mixture of apple juice and orange juice is composed of two-thirds apple juice and one-third orange juice (by volume). This means that for every liter of apple juice, there are 1/3 liters of orange juice.
2. You have 10 liters of apple juice, which means you have 10 x 1/3 = 3.33 liters of orange juice in your mixture.
3. You want to add this mixture to 15 liters of orange juice, which means you will be adding 3.33 liters of orange juice to 15 liters of orange juice.
4. When you mix these two liquids together, you will lose some liquid due to evaporation or other factors. However, let's assume that none of the liquid is lost during mixing, so we can calculate the total volume of the final mixture as follows:
Volume of final mixture = Volume of apple juice + Volume of orange juice
= 10 liters + 15 liters
= 25 liters
Therefore, the ratio of water to fruit juice in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:
Ratio of water to fruit juice = Volume of water / Total volume of mixture
= 24 liters / 25 liters
= 96% (or 960 ml out of 1000 ml)
So, there are approximately 960 ml of water in each 1000 ml of the remaining mixture. To convert this value to liters, divide by 1000:
960 ml / 1000 ml = 0.96 liters per 1000 ml
Now, we know that you have 24 liters of the remaining mixture, so we can calculate the number of liters of water present in it as follows:
Number of liters of water = Total volume of mixture x Ratio of water to fruit juice
= 24 liters x 0.96 liters/1000 ml
= 23"

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Danya can run four times faster than she can walk. This means that if it takes her x hours to walk a distance of y miles, it will take her 4x hours to run the same distance.
* Danya can jump twice as fast as she can run. This means that if it takes her 4x hours to run a distance of y miles, it will take her 8x hours to jump the same distance.

Now, let's apply these formulas to find out how many miles Danya can cover in six hours:

1. If Danya walks at a speed of y miles per hour for 6 hours, she will cover a total distance of 6y miles.
2. If Danya runs at a speed of 4x miles per hour for 6 hours, she will cover a total distance of 4(6y) = 24y miles.
3. Since Danya jumps twice as fast as she runs, if she covers 24y miles running, she will cover 48y miles jumping (since 2x = 4).

So, the total distance Danya can cover in six hours is:
Distance = 6y + 24y + 48y = 98y miles

Therefore, the answer is 98 miles."

Explanation:
To determine how many grams of chips you can eat to reach your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories while already consuming 1800 calories from the package, we need to use the information provided in the question.
The package contains 250 calories per serving, and there are 5 servings in the package (since each serving is 50 grams). Therefore, the total number of calories in the package is:
250 x 5 = 1250 calories
Since you want to consume 2000 calories today, you have a remaining balance of:
2000 - 1250 = 750 calories
Now, dividing the remaining calories by the number of servings in the package gives us the maximum amount of chips you can eat:
750 / 5 = 150 grams
However, since you already consumed 1800 calories from the package, you cannot eat the full 150 grams. To calculate the actual amount of chips you can eat, subtract the calories you already consumed from the remaining calories:
150 - 1800 = -1650 calories
Therefore, the actual amount of chips you can eat is (-1650) / 5 = -330 grams."

Explanation:
Charlie wants to sell candles made of beeswax. For every pound of beeswax he can make 10 twisted candles. A kilogram of beeswax and wick cost $10. If he sells each candle for $2, what will be his pure profit if he sells 20 candles?
To find Charlie's pure profit, we need to subtract the cost of the materials from the revenue generated by the sale of the candles. The cost of the materials is $10 per kilogram of beeswax and wick, so the total cost for 20 candles would be $200 ($10 x 20).
If Charlie sells each candle for $2, then the total revenue from the sale of the 20 candles would be $400 ($2 x 20). Subtracting the cost of the materials from the revenue gives us Charlie's pure profit of $200."

Explanation:
The mechanic repaired 6 tires for trucks and 4 tires for cars on Thursday, so he earned $6 x 6 = $36 in revenue from tire repair for trucks and $4 x 4 = $16 in revenue from tire repair for cars. Therefore, the total revenue from tire repair on Thursday was $52 ($36 + $16).
On Friday, the mechanic did not repair any tires for trucks but repaired 12 cars, so he earned $40 x 12 = $480 in revenue from car tire repair. Therefore, the total revenue from tire repair on Friday was $52 + $480 = $532.
So, the difference between the daily earnings of the mechanic with higher tire repair income is $532 - $36 = $496."

Explanation:
Softia has traveled 160 kilometers since her last refueling and needs to fill up with 4 gallons of gasoline to continue her journey. According to the manual for her car, she has a total capacity of 12 gallons of gasoline in her tank. Therefore, Softia can travel an additional distance of:

Distance = Total fuel capacity - Used fuel capacity
= 12 gallons - 4 gallons
= 8 gallons

Since there are approximately 3.79 miles per gallon of gasoline (based on average fuel economy data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency), we can calculate the total distance Softia can travel as follows:

Total distance = Distance / Miles per gallon
= 8 gallons / 3.79 miles/gallon

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Let L be the length of the beach and W be the width of the beach.
Luke builds a sandcastle with n levels, where each level has an area of half the previous level's area (i.e., the area of each level decreases by half). Let A_n be the area of the top level (level n) of the sandcastle.
From the problem statement, we know that Luke starts building the sandcastle at one end of the beach, so the length of the castle is equal to L. Also, since the castle has n levels, its height is equal to n times the width of the beach (W). Therefore, the volume of the sandcastle is:
V = L \* W^n
Since the top level has an area of 16 square feet, we can find the area of each lower level using the fact that the area of each level decreases by half:
A_n = A_{n-1}/2
Substituting this into the equation for V above, we get:
V = L \* W^(n-1) / 2^n
Now, we are asked to find the average value of A_n over all levels. Since each level has an area of half the previous level's area, the average area of all levels is:
average area = (A_1 + A_2 +... + A_n) / n = (1/2)^(n-1) \* (L \* W^(n-1)) / 2^n
Simplifying this expression, we get:
average area = L \* W^(n-1)/4
Therefore, the average area of all levels of the sandcastle is L \* W^(n-1)/4."

Explanation: According to the passage, each 16-ounce batch of pickled cucumbers contains three cucumbers. Since Freddy made 32 ounces of tomato sauce and used 16 ounces of pickled cucumbers in each batch, she must have used 3 x 16 = 48 cucumbers in total. Therefore, there are 48 / 3 = 16 cucumbers left over after making the tomato sauce."

Explanation:
The passage states that ""десять автомобілів проїжджали через пробку протягом перших п'ятнадцяти хвилин"". This means that 10 cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Since there were initially 30 cars on the highway, this means that 20 cars (30 - 10) did not pass through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam during the last 15 minutes is equal to the total number of cars minus the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes, which is 20 cars. So, the answer is 40 cars (20 + 20)."

The third friend pressed it 10 times more than the second friend, so they pressed it 240 times (24 x 10). Finally, the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, which is equal to 35 times the number of times the other three friends pressed it combined (60 / 3 = 20). Therefore, the total number of times the four friends pressed the button is 35."

Let's analyze the given information:

* Lodka Julia appeared when she was on the lake.
* The boat gained two liters of water for every ten feet it traveled back to shore.
* It took her sixteen seconds to travel twenty feet.
* There were sixty-four seconds until she reached the shore.

Now, let's calculate the total volume of water that was in the boat at that time:

The mitny officer in the main port of Seaside calculated that 2 containers imported transport vehicles contained 5 vehicles each, for a total of 10 vehicles. The next day, more containers arrived and the total number of vehicles in the port increased to 30. Since all containers are assumed to contain 5 vehicles each, the number of containers imported on the second day can be found by subtracting the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles after arrival: 30 - 10 = 20. Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."

"Response:  $375,000 per day

Explanation:

Let's assume that there are 500 patients who visit the hospital every day. Since each patient spends an average of 24 hours in the hospital, they spend a total of 500 x 24 = 12,000 hours at the hospital daily.

Since each doctor charges $150 per hour and sees 5 patients per hour, the doctors earn $150 x 5 = $750 per hour. Therefore, the total amount earned by the doctors per day is $750 x 12 = $9,000 per day.

Similarly, since each patient pays $200 per hour to the hospital, the hospital earns $200 x 12 = $2,400 per day from each patient. Therefore, the total amount earned by the hospital per day is $2,400 x 500 = $1,200,000 per day.

So, the total amount that the hospital receives from these visits is $9,000 + $1,200,000 = $1,209,000 per day."

Response: 3600 bananas. Explanation: To calculate how many bananas Dvirnik needs to buy for two months, we need to multiply the number of animals by the amount each animal needs per month. For example, there are 8 mahouts (majors) that require 200 bananas each = 1600 bananas. Similarly, there are 4 gorillas that require 400 bananas each = 1600 bananas. There are also 2 baboons that require 100 bananas each = 200 bananas. Therefore, in total, Dvirnik needs to buy 1600 + 1600 + 200 = 3600 bananas for two months.
"Response: 270 yards
Explanation:
Blake runs back and forth along the 100-yard field 15 times, covering a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.
Kelly runs once from the start to the 40-yard line and back, covering a distance of 40 + 40 = 80 yards.
Therefore, Blake covers a total distance of 1500 + 80 = 1580 yards, while Kelly covers a total distance of 80 yards.
Since Blake covers more distance than Kelly, he is the winner and his score is 270 yards (1580 - 80)."

Loxin caught fewer marine stars than Ana kin (5 less), fewer marine horses than Ana kin (3 less), but more clown fish than Ana kin (2 more). Therefore, the total number of fish that both boys caught is:
Ana kin - 10 + 6 = 16
Loxin - 5 + 3 = 8
So, they together caught 16 + 8 = 24 fish or 70 marine animals."

Explanation:
The initial price of the marble box is $20.
After 2 months, the price increases by 20%, so the new price is:
$20 x 1.2 = $24
New price after 2 months = $20 + ($24 - $20) = $44
Repeat this process for each month:
Years 3-6: $44 x 1.2 = $52.80; $52.80 x 1.2 = $63.76; $63.76 x 1.2 = $76.64; $76.64 x 1.2 = $92.52
Years 7-12: $92.52 x 1.2 = $109.24; $109.24 x 1.2 = $126.96; $126.96 x 1.2 = $145.68; $145.68 x 1.2 = $165.40
Years 13-18: $165.40 x 1.2 = $192.56; $192.56 x 1.2 = $219.72; $219.72 x 1.2 = $247.96; $247.96 x 1.2 = $276.20
Years 19-24: $276.20 x 1.2 = $313.44; $313.44 x 1.2 = $349.76; $349.76 x 1.2 = $386.12; $386.12 x 1.2 = $422.44

Question:  There are 5 red cars and 3 blue cars parked outside. If a red car costs $800 more than a blue car, how much will the total cost be for all the cars?
Answer:  Based on the given information, we can conclude that the total cost of all the red cars = (Number of red cars x Price difference between red and blue cars) + Total cost of blue cars. So, T = (5 x ($800)) + (Total cost of blue cars). Substituting the values, T = $4000 + X, where X is the total cost of the blue cars. Solving for X, we get X = $6000. Therefore, the total cost of all the cars is $6000. Explanation: The problem states that there are 5 red cars and 3 blue cars parked outside. We know that each red car costs $800 more than each blue car. Therefore, the price of each red car is $800 more than the price of each blue car. Since there are 5 red cars, their total cost is $800 times 5 = $4000. Additionally, since there are 3 blue cars, their total cost is $6000. Thus, the total cost of all the cars is $4000 + $6000 = $10000."

"Response:  $18,467
Explanation:
To calculate how much Jessica will pay per month for her debts, we need to multiply each of her debt amounts by the percentage she wants to pay above the minimum (50%). For example, if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum student loan payment, that means she will pay $300 x 50% = $150 extra per month. Therefore, her total monthly debt payment will be $300 + $150 = $450 per month.
Similarly, if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum credit card payment, that means she will pay $200 x 50% = $100 extra per month. So, her total monthly credit card payment will be $200 + $100 = $300 per month. And if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum mortgage payment, that means she will pay $500 x 50% = $250 extra per month. So, her total monthly mortgage payment will be $500 + $250 = $750 per month.
Now, let’s calculate the total amount Jessica will pay over one year at this rate:
$450/month x 12 months = $5,400 per year
$300/month x 12 months = $3,600 per year
$750/month x 12 months = $9,000 per year
Therefore, Jessica will pay a total of $5,400 + $3,600 + $9,000 = $18,467 over one year at this rate."

The problem states that Billy takes half an hour to prepare 60 carrots for his barbecue (which is equivalent to 1 minute per carrot). Since he spends only 5 seconds to cut each carrot after cleaning it, we can assume that the time spent on cutting the carrots is negligible compared to the time spent on preparing them. Therefore, the total time taken by Billy to prepare all 60 carrots is half an hour or 30 minutes."

Total monthly expenses: $2500 + $1250 + $900 = $4650
Now, let's check how much money Zeyd has left after all these expenses and donations:
Money left: $6000 - $4650 = $1350
Therefore, Zeyd will have $1350 left after paying all his bills and making donations."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 10 cages with hamsters, each containing one hamster. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of carrot. Therefore, the total number of hamsters = 10 x 1 = 10. Since Russel works at the pet store and gives carrots to the small rodents, he does not use any carrots himself. So, the number of carrots used by Russell = 0. Thus, the remaining carrots (160 - 0) = 160 are distributed among the small rodents. As there are 10 cages with hamsters, each cage contains 160 / 10 = 16 hamsters."

Since 30% of the original 50 trees have died, 30 / 100 = 0.3 or 30% of the remaining trees are gone, leaving 150 - 30 = 120 trees.

Response: 50 kg (kilograms) of cucumbers will not be used. Explanation: To determine how much cucumber will not be used, we need to subtract the amount given in the problem from the total amount of cucumbers available for distribution. In this case, each restaurant will receive 2 funti of cucumber, and there are 40 restaurants in total, so the total amount of cucumbers distributed is 80 funti (2 x 40 = 80). Since 200 funti were initially available, that means 120 funti (200 - 80 = 120) will remain unused. Therefore, 50 kg (120 / 2 = 50) of cucumbers will not be used.
"Response: 5608

Explanation:
The total population of SoDA is given as 23786. Among them, there are 8417 men and 9092 women. Therefore, the number of children in SoDA is:

Number of children = Total population - Number of men + Number of women
= 23786 - 8417 + 9092
= 5608

Therefore, there are 5608 children in SoDA."
Response: 40 cards. Explanation: Let X be the number of cards Ileyn had at first. Since she gathered thrice as many cards in the second month, her total number of cards after two months is 3X = 60. In the third month, she gathered twice as many cards as in the previous two months, so her total number of cards after three months is 2(3X) = 66. Therefore, her final number of cards is 40 (since 66 - 20 = 40).

Explanation:
Let's assume that Mark edits x recesses per week for each of the two publishers. Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, Publisher B will pay Mark $2x recesses per week. Therefore, Mark earns a total of $2x + 5x = 7x cent per week.
Since there are 1000 recesses in a week, Mark earns 7x \* 1000 = 7000 cent per week."

Explanation:
Carl used 2 pieces of cheese per sandwich and 1 piece more than he did for omelets. Therefore, he used 3 x 2 = 6 pieces of cheese for sandwiches. He also used 8 shreds of cheese in his macaroni dish, which is equal to 4 times as much cheese as he used for sandwiches (since there are 4 shreds of cheese in each sandwich). So, in total, Carl used 6 + 4 = 10 pieces of cheese."

* At first, Janet had 22 green buttons and 10 yellow ones, so she had a total of 32 buttons (22 x 2 = 44 + 10).
* Then, she bought 6 packages of blue buttons, each containing 9 buttons, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 blue buttons.
* Next, she bought 2 packages of red buttons, each containing 6 buttons, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 red buttons.

In total, Janet now has 44 + 54 + 12 = 110 buttons."

"Response: 16 hours
Explanation: To calculate how many hours Lorraine needs to work before she can afford the shoes and belt, we need to find out how much money she will have after buying them. The cost of the shoes is $320, and the cost of the belt is $32. If she works for $8 per hour, then she will earn $8 x number of hours worked = total amount earned. Since she wants to buy the shoes and belt together, we need to subtract their combined cost from her total amount earned. Therefore, the equation becomes: Total amount earned - Cost of shoes - Cost of belt = Amount left over After working for 16 hours (based on the given information), Lorraine will have earned $8 x 16 = $128. Subtracting the cost of the shoes ($320) and the cost of the belt ($32), we get: $128 - $352 = -$224. This means that Lorraine does not have enough money to buy the shoes and belt yet."

Explanation:
James has 30 fire cards, 20 grass cards, and 40 water cards in his deck. If he loses 8 water cards, he will have 32 water cards left (40 - 8 = 32). Then, if he buys 14 new cards of any type, there is a probability of 0.67 that one of them will be a water card. This is calculated by dividing the number of remaining water cards (32) by the total number of cards in his deck (90): 32 / 90 = 0.67."

Explanation: Let's assume that there are x students who left through exit S. Since 30% of the students left through exit A, the number of students who left through exit A is 0.3x = 300. Similarly, since 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, the number of students who left through exit B is 3/5 \* (900 - 300) = 450. Therefore, the total number of students who left through exits A and B is 300 + 450 = 750. This means that the number of students who left through exit C (i.e., exit S) is x - 750 = 267."

"Response: 30 hours per week

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Mike is friends with five people and they all send two letters per week. Since each letter takes six minutes to write, Mike spends a total of 12 minutes writing letters per day (5 people x 2 letters/person/week x 6 minutes/letter = 12 minutes/day). Therefore, he spends 72 minutes per week writing letters (12 minutes/day x 6 days/week = 72 minutes/week).
Since Mike can write one page in 6 minutes, he writes 12 pages per hour (72 minutes/week / 6 minutes/page = 12 pages/hour). So, he spends 30 hours per week writing letters (12 pages/hour x 6 hours/day = 30 hours/week)."
"Response: 2700 hours

Explanation:
Jason plans to make 1000 calls per month, and each call lasts for 15 minutes. Therefore, he will spend 1000 x 15 = 15,000 minutes on calls in a month. Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason spends 15,000 / 30 = 500 minutes per day on calls.
Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason has 30 x 24 = 720 minutes free time per day (besides his daily calls). Therefore, the total number of hours available for other activities is 720 / 60 = 12 hours per day.
So, if there are 30 days in the month, Jason has 12 x 30 = 360 hours available for other activities during that month."

From the information provided in the question:
* Grifin had 24 carrots and Kyle took 5 of them. So Grifin has 24 - 5 = 19 carrots left.
* Billy took twice as many carrots as Kyle, so he took (2 x 5) = 10 carrots from Grifin.
* Jenner gave Grifin some of her own carrots, but we don't know how many. Let's assume it was an even number, say 6.
* Colby took 3 fewer carrots than Kyle took, so he took (3 - 5) = -2 carrots from Grifin.
* At the end of all these transactions, Grifin had 19 + 10 - 2 = 19 carrots left.
So Ginger gave Grifin 10 more carrots, making his total 29 carrots."
