"Response: 
Janet has 16 eggs per day and sells them at $2 each in the farmer's market every day. So she earns $32 from selling eggs every day (16 x $2 = $32)."
"Response:  We know that the jubah takes 2 bolts of blue thread and half of white thread. So, we need to find out how many threads are in total for both blue and white threads. The number of threads in one bolt is given as follows:
Number of threads per bolt = Number of strands x Length of each strand (in meters)
For blue thread, there are 3 strands with a length of 0.5 meter each, so the total number of threads in one bolt is:
Number of threads per bolt = 3 x 0.5 = 1.5 meters
Similarly, for white thread, there are 4 strands with a length of 0.75 meter each, so the total number of threads in one bolt is:
Number of threads per bolt = 4 x 0.75 = 3 meters
Now, let's calculate the total number of threads needed for both blue and white threads:
Total number of threads needed = Number of blue threads x Number of threads per bolt + Number of white threads x Number of threads per bolt
= 2 x 1.5 + 4 x 3 = 9 meters
Therefore, there are 9 meters of threads needed in total."
Response:  If Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 to renovate it, that means he invested a total of $130,000 ($80,000 + $50,000). After renovating the house, its value increased by 150%, which is equal to $225,000 (150% of $150,000). So, Josh made a profit of $95,000 ($225,000 - $130,000).
"Response:  If James runs three times per week and each time he runs 60 meters, then in one week he will run:

3 x 3 = 9 sprints (or distances of 60 meters) per week

So, in one week, James will have run a total distance of:

9 x 60 = 540 meters

Therefore, the answer is 540 meters."
"Response:  
Wendi gives her chickens three bowls of mixed chicken food every day, which contains seeds, wheat germ, and vegetables to help keep them healthy. She feeds her chickens in three equal portions. In the morning, she gives them 15 bowls of food. In the evening, she gives them 25 more bowls of food. How many bowls of food does Wendi need to give to her chickens today if there are 20 chickens in total? 
So, the answer is 3 x 15 = 45 bowls of food for the morning feeding, plus 25 = 69 bowls of food for the evening feeding, so the total number of bowls of food needed is 45 + 69 = 114 bowls."
Response:  If one glass costs $5, then two glasses cost half price of $2.5 each. So, if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will need to pay $40 for them (16 x $2.5 = $40).
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Toulouse has 2 x 2 = 4 times 20 = 80 sheep. Therefore, the number of sheep owned by Toulouse is 80.
Response:  We know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute, which means she has downloaded 80 GB in 40 minutes (since there are 5 minutes left). Therefore, the remaining amount to be downloaded is 200 - 80 = 120 GB. Since it takes 20 minutes for Windows to restart and start downloading from the beginning, we need to divide the remaining amount by this time to find out how much data needs to be downloaded each minute: 120 GB / 20 min = 6 GB/min. So, Carla needs to download 6 GB every minute to finish downloading the file within the given time frame.
"Response: 
John spent 3 hours driving at 60 mph and then turned back because he realized something important was forgotten at home. He tried to return in 4 hours but spent the first 2 hours stuck in traffic. Then, he drove at 30 mph for half an hour before finishing his journey at 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours. So, how far is John from his house after 4 hours?
Let's break down the distance traveled during each leg of the trip:
1. Driving at 60 mph for 3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 miles
2. Stuck in traffic for 2 hours = 2 x 0 = no distance traveled (since he didn't move)
3. Driving at 30 mph for half an hour = 0.5 x 30 = 15 miles
4. Finishing the journey at 80 mph for 2 hours = 2 x 80 = 160 miles
Total distance traveled = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 425 miles
Therefore, John is 425 miles away from his house after 4 hours."
Response:  If Eliza works for 40 hours per week and her hourly wage is $10, then her total weekly earnings are: Weekly Earnings = Hourly Wage x Number of Hours Worked = $10 x 40 = $400 per week. Now, if she works overtime for 5 hours (45 - 40), her additional earnings will be: Overtime Earning = Hourly Wage x Number of Extra Hours Worked = $10 x 5 = $50. So, her total earnings for this week would be: Total Earnings = Weekly Earnings + Overtime Earning = $400 + $50 = $450.
Response:  In the first month, there are 60 downloads. In the second month, the number of downloads is three times greater than in the first month, so we have 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. Then, in the third month, the number of downloads decreases by 30%, so we have 180 - (30/100) = 126 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads over the period of three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.
"Response: 
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 each = $68 x 3 = $194 for donuts.
She also bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 each = $80 x 2 = $160 for cupcakes.
Lastly, she purchased 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 each = $55 x 6 = $330 for cheesecakes.
Therefore, the total cost of all the baked goods is $194 + $160 + $330 = $684."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of growing lemons for one year as follows: Total Cost = Initial Investment + Annual Maintenance Costs + Profit per Lemon x Number of Lemons Grown Total Cost = $90 + ($3 x 7) + ($1.5 x 7) Total Cost = $90 + $21 + $10.5 Total Cost = $121.5 Now, let's find out how many years it will take for Carlos to break even or recover his initial investment: Break-even Point = Total Cost / Annual Revenue Break-even Point = $121.5 / $10.5 (Profit per Lemon x Number of Lemons Grown) Break-even Point = 11 years Therefore, it will take Carlos approximately 11 years to break even or recover his initial investment of $90 in growing lemons.
"Response: 
Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaner sales at Green House, two-thirds to Red House, and half of what was left at Orange House. If Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners in total, how many did she sell?
Let X be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially. Since she sold one-third of them at Green House, she sold (1/3)X = 2X at Green House. Similarly, since she sold two-thirds of them to Red House, she sold (2/3)X = 4X at Red House. Finally, since she sold half of what was left at Orange House, she sold (1/2)X = 3X at Orange House. Therefore, the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie sold is 2X + 4X + 3X = 9X. So, the answer is 9."
Response:  We know that out of 20 students in total, 4 students (20% of them) registered for contemporary dance, and 6 students (25% of them) registered for jazz dance. So far, we have 10 students who registered for either contemporary or jazz dance. Now, let's calculate the percentage of students who registered for hip-hop dance. Since the remaining 8 students did not register for any of those three dances, we can say that they registered for hip-hop dance. Therefore, the percentage of students who registered for hip-hop dance is: 8/10 = 0.8 or 80%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the present value of each option using the given prices and probabilities of price movements. For Perhiasan, the probability of price movement is 2.5%, so the expected change in price is 2.5%. Therefore, the present value of Perhiasan = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,375. Similarly, for Alat Elektronik, the probability of price movement is 1.2%, so the expected change in price is 1.2%. Therefore, the present value of Alat Elektronik = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,496. Now, let's calculate the maximum profit that the peniaga can make if he chooses either option. The maximum profit will be the difference between the expected values of the two options. So, Maximum Profit = Expected Value of Perhiasan - Expected Value of Alat Elektronik. Using the calculations above, we get Maximum Profit = $5,375 - $8,496 = -$3,121. This means that if the peniaga chooses either option, he will not maximize his profits. In fact, he will lose $3,121. Therefore, the answer is (-)$3,121.
Response:  On day one, both trains travel west for 80 batu each, so they are 80 batu apart. Then, on the second day, they move north and cover 150 batu each, so they are now 230 batu (80 + 150) apart. Therefore, the distance between them after two days is 230 batu.
"Response:  If she works as a teacher for 50 weeks per year and teaches for 35 hours per week, her total teaching hours per year is: 
$$ \text {Total teaching hours} = \text{Number of weeks} \times \text{Total hours per week} $$
$$ \text {Total teaching hours} = 50 \times 35 = 1750 \text { hours/year} $$
If she also works as a cheerleading coach for 15 hours per week, her total coaching hours per year is:
$$ \text {Total coaching hours} = \text{Number of weeks} \times \text{Total hours per week} $$
$$ \text {Total coaching hours} = 50 \times 15 = 750 \text { hours/year} $$
Now we need to calculate her annual salary based on these hours:
$$ \text {Annual Salary} = \text {Hours worked} \times \text {Salary per hour} $$
For teaching:
$$ \text {Teaching Annual Salary} = 1750 \text { hours/year} \times \$20 = \$35,000 \text { per year} $$
For coaching:
$$ \text {Coaching Annual Salary} = 750 \text { hours/year} \times \$30 = \$22,500 \text { per year} $$
So, Jill's annual salary would be:
$$ \text {Annual Salary} = \$35,000 + \$22,500 = \$57,500 \text { per year} $$"
"Response:  If Claire makes 3 eggs per morning for breakfast and she does this for 4 weeks, then...

1 week = 21 days (since there are 7 days in a week)
Claire makes 3 eggs/day x 21 days/week = 63 eggs/week
Therefore, Claire will eat 63 eggs/week."
Response:  If she took 1 hour to walk 4 stones in the first part and then another hour to walk 2 stones after that, it means she walked for a total of 3 hours. So, if she wants her average pace to be 4 stones per hour, she needs to walk for a distance of 3 x 4 = 12 batu.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice and we want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice. Since two-thirds of the orange juice is water, we can assume that one-third of the total mixture is also water (since the pineapple juice has three-fifths water). So, if we add the two mixtures together, we get:

Orange juice + Pineapple juice = 10 + 15 = 25 liters
Since we added one liter of orange juice during mixing, the final volume of the mixed liquid will be:

Mixed liquid = 25 - 1 = 24 liters
Therefore, there are 24 liters of water in the 24-liter container."
Response:  We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and he is now 23 years old when his son was born. So, Samantha must be 31 - 6 = 25 years old at that time. Therefore, the child of Raymond was born 23 + 6 = 29 years ago.
"Response:  The total number of customers who bought from Billy is 8. Now let's analyze how many DVD each customer bought:
* First 3 customers bought 1 DVD each = 3 DVDs
* Next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each = 4 DVDs
* Last 3 customers did not buy any DVD = 0 DVDs
Total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Monday = 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs
Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Monday."
"Response:  The length of the lilin is increasing at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour after it catches fire at 1:00 pm. Therefore, the length of the lilin at 5:00 pm will be:
L = 2 cm/hr x (5 - 1) = 10 cm
So, the length of the lilin after it catches fire from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm is 10 centimeters."
Response:  The original price of the book is given to be $19.50 and there is a discount of 25% off that price. So we can write an equation based on this information: Discounted Price = Original Price x (1 - Discount Percentage) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Discounted Price = $19.50 x (1 - 0.25) = $19.50 x 0.75 = $14.38 Therefore, the original price of the book was $14.38.
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for the food. From the information given in the problem, we can write an equation using the prices of each item as follows:

$12 (ayam) + $3 (pek susu) x 5 = $50

Total cost = $12 + $6 = $18
So, Marie bought 18 Kotak Pizza if each Kotak costs $8.50."
"Response: 
Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, which cost $16.50 x 3 = $49.50.
She also bought 3 pairs of pants, which cost $22.50 x 3 = $67.50.
Finally, she bought 3 jackets, which cost $42 x 3 = $126.
Therefore, in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $233.00."
"Response:  If Cynthia buys one box of ice cream every night and each box contains 15 servings at a cost of $4 per box after 60 days, she will have spent a total of:

Total number of boxes = Number of nights / Number of servings per box
= 30 nights (assuming she eats ice cream every night) / 15 servings per box
= 2 boxes

So, Cynthia will have spent $8 on ice cream in total ($4 x 2 boxes)."
Response:  The distance traveled by Henry is given as 60 batu in total. He stopped twice during his journey. The first stop was after 20 batu, and the second stop was 15 batu before the end of the journey. So, we can deduce that he traveled for 45 batu (60 - 20 - 15) between his two stops. Therefore, the answer is 45 batu.
"Response:  If Gloria buys one pair of shoes that costs $50 and has to choose between two pairs of shoes with prices below $50, then we can calculate as follows:

1. The price of the first pair of shoes is $50.
2. The price of the second pair of shoes is $33 (since it is twice the price of the first pair).
3. Therefore, the total cost of both pairs of shoes = $50 + ($33 x 2) = $50 + $66 = $116.
4. So, the price of the third pair of shoes is $116 - $50 = $66."
Response:  The ratio of their ages is 7:11, which means that if we multiply their current age difference (10 years) by this ratio, we will get the age difference between them at the time when they were born. So, the age difference between them at birth was 70 years (7 x 10 = 70). Therefore, Allen was born 70 years ago.
Response:  According to Gunter, there are 80 beans in the bag. His friend thinks that there are more than half of them (which is 40). Another friend says that there are 25% more than what Gunter said (which is 10). So, the total number of beans in the bag is: 80 + (40/2) = 80 + 20 = 100. Therefore, the average amount of beans in the bag is 100 / 3 = 33.33 beans per person.
Response:  Since John takes care of 10 dogs and each dog spends 0.5 hours per day walking and managing their businesses, then in one week, he will spend 7 days x 24 hours/day = 168 hours taking care of the dogs. So, the answer is 168 hours.
Response:  We know that there are 110 silver coins and 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of silver coins = 110 Number of gold coins = 110 + 30 = 140 Therefore, Gretchen has 140 gold coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has more than two fewer pearls than Siobhan and Aaron has five more pearls than half of Raymond's pearls. So, if Raymond has 40 pearls, then Siobhan must have at least 38 pearls (since she has 2 fewer than Aaron). Therefore, the answer is 38.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. If he scores 25% more in the next 20 minutes, then he will score (4 x 1.25) = 5 points in total during those 20 minutes. So, the final answer is 9 points (4 + 5).
Response:  If Terry consumes 2 yogurts per day and now sells them for 4 yogurts at $5 each, then he will make $5 x 4 = $20 from selling yogurt every day. So in 30 days, he will make $20 x 30 = $600. Therefore, Terry spends $600 worth of yogurt during 30 days.
Response:  We know that John sold all of his Lego sets and used the money to buy video games. He had 13 Lego sets and sold each one for $15, so he made $195 from selling the Lego sets ($15 x 13 = $195). Now, he has $195 left after buying 8 video games at $20 each, so he spent $160 on video games ($195 - $160 = $35). Therefore, there are 13 - 8 = 5 Lego sets remaining with John.
Response:  If he ran for 60 minutes per day (3 hours), then his total distance covered in one week would be: Distance = Speed x Time = 60 x 3 = 180 km. So, he ran at an average speed of 180/3 = 60 km/h.
Response:  If she can jump 3 stones in one second, then she can cover 3 x 6 = 18 stones in 6 hours if she spends half of her time running and two-thirds of her time running. So the answer is 18 stones.
Response:  We know that iPhone Ben is two times older than iPhone Suzy, so iPhone Ben is 2 x 1 = 2 years old. Since iPhone Brandon is five times older than iPhone Ben, iPhone Brandon is 5 x 2 = 10 years old. Therefore, the age of iPhone Brandon is 10 years.
"Response: 
First, we know that the range of Polly's throwing ability with the gold tomahawk is 400 feet (120 meters).
Next, we are told that when Polly holds the gemstone amulet, she can throw the gold tomahawk three times farther than usual. So, if her usual throwing distance was x feet, then the increased distance with the amulet would be 3x feet.
Finally, we are given that the dragon's flame extends to a distance of 1000 feet (305 meters), so we need to find the maximum distance from which Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold tomahawk.
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1000 - 3(400) = 600 feet (183 meters)
Therefore, Polly could stand at most 600 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold tomahawk using the gemstone amulet."
Response:  If Nenek Jones burned 5 pais and cut each one into 8 pieces, then she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pai in total. Since she placed 5 pieces on the buffet table for guests to serve themselves, that means there were 40 - 5 = 35 pieces of pai left after the guests took some. So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 35.
Response:  If one serving of Beg Cip has 250 calories, then three servings would have 750 calories (250 x 3 = 750). Now, if you want to consume 2000 calories per day and you have already consumed 1800 calories from Beg Cip, that means you still need to consume an additional 200 calories from other sources to reach your daily target (2000 - 1800 = 200). So, in total, you can eat up to 300 grams of Beg Cip per day while staying within your daily calorie goal.
Response:  If Charlie sells each lantern for $2, he will make $2 x 20 = $40 from selling 20 lanterns. However, he also has to pay $10 per pack of 10 lanterns, so his total cost is $10 x 20 = $200. Therefore, his profit is $40 - $200 = -$160.

"Response: 
Candice had 80 notes before she left for work at the coffee shop. She bought one pack of note stickers after stopping at the coffee shop and placed one sticker on each of the 220 cups of coffee that were different prices. If she has 23 remaining stickers, how many stickers were in the package she bought?
Let x be the number of stickers in the package. Since there are 220 cups of coffee with different prices, we can write an equation based on this information:
x + 80 = 23
Now let's solve for x:
Subtracting 80 from both sides gives us:
x = 140
Therefore, the package contained 140 stickers!"
Response:  The price of red beads is 50% more than that of blue beads. So if the price of one blue bead is $ 40, then the price of one red bead is $ 40 x 1.5 = $ 60. Therefore, John spent $ 200 for 3 sets of red beads, which means he spent $ 60 per set.
Response:  The length of the wayar is 4 feet or 120 cm. Since each section of the wayar is 6 inches long (or 15 cm), we can calculate how many sections there are based on the total length of the wayar. Therefore, the number of sections = Total length of wayar / Length of one section. In this case, the total length of the wayar is 120 cm x 4 ft = 480 cm. So, there are 480/15 = 32 sections of wayar. Now, let's find out how many keping tomatoes Tracy can plant using these sections. Each section of wayar can hold approximately 3-4 keping tomatoes, depending on their size and growth pattern. Based on that, Tracy can plant around 32 x 3 = 96 keping tomatoes in her garden!
Response:  The total number of units in the building is given as 15 x 8 = 120 units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of unoccupied units as follows: Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - (Number of occupied units / 4) = 120 - (3/4) x 120 = 96 units. Therefore, there are 96 units that are vacant or unoccupied in the building.
Response:  If Lloyd has an egg farm and his chickens lay 252 eggs per day, then he must produce at least 16,320 eggs (252 x 67) in one week (7 days). So, if he sells each egg for $2, then he makes $32,640 from egg sales alone in one week ($2 x 16,320 eggs).
"Response:

Therefore, it took him a total of 5 hours and 40 minutes to return."
Response:  If each book weighs 1/4 pound and there are 30 books in total, then each book weighs 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. Since the boy can only carry 15 pounds, he needs to remove 7.5 - 15 = 7.5 pounds of books. So, he needs to remove 7.5 pounds of books from his bag.
Response:  On Thursday (Khamis), the mechanic repairs 6 tires and 4 cars, so he earns $60 + $40 = $100. On Friday (Jumaat), the mechanic repairs 12 cars but does not repair any tires, so he earns $0. Therefore, the total amount of money the mechanic earned is $100 from Thursday plus $0 from Friday, which is $100.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Suster Doubtfire has adopted 7 cats from the local animal shelter. The first cat, Patchy, has had 3 litters of kittens, and the second cat, Trixie, has had 12 kittens. Therefore, the total number of cats that the Doubtfire family currently has is: 7 + 3 = 10 cats.
Response:  If Jean has 30 lollipops and he eats 2 of them, then he has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. To pack these lollipops into groups of 2, we need to divide them by 2, so we have 28 / 2 = 14 groups of 2 lollipops each. Therefore, Jean can make 14 begs (groups) of lollipops.
Response:  If Peter can go to the movies once with $7 for tickets and $7 for popcorn, then he has spent a total of $14 ($7 + $7). So, if he has $42 for the whole week, he can go to the movies $\boxed{6}$ times (since $42 / 14 = 3$).
Response:  We know that the maximum weight of wood that can be carried across the bridge is 5000 pounds (jambatan). The total weight of the packages and the empty track is 3755 pounds (berat gabungan pemandu dan trak kosong). To determine how many packages can be loaded onto the cart without exceeding the weight limit, we need to divide the total weight by the weight of each package: $ \frac {3755} {15} = 250$ packages (jumlah maksimum Kotak) Can be loaded onto the cart without exceeding the weight limit.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the order before adding any additional fees or tips. The total cost of the order is calculated as follows: Total Cost = Price x Quantity Total Cost = $40.00 x 1 = $40.00 Next, we add the delivery fee which is 25% of the total cost + $3.00 (delivery fee) = $40.00 + ($40.00 x 25%) + $3.00 = $68.75 Finally, we add the tip amounting to $4.00, bringing the final price to $72.75. Therefore, the final price after all calculations are made is $72.75.
Response:  We know that there are 6 buah of raspberries in each cluster and 3 clusters of raspberries altogether. Therefore, the total number of raspberries is: 6 x 3 = 18. So, there are 18 raspberries in total.
"Response:  We have 25 jeruk in total, and we want to know how many are good (baik). From the information given, we can see that:
* 1 is bad (buruk)
* 20% are not yet ripe (belum matang)
* 2 are overripe (masam)
* The rest are good (baik)

So, if we subtract the number of bad ones (1), the number of not-yet-ripe ones (20% of 25 = 5), and the number of overripe ones (2), we get the total number of good ones:

Total good jeruk = 25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = 17

Therefore, there are 17 jeruk that are good."
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for materials to make the brooch. Then, she paid another $800 to have it customized and decorated. Finally, she paid 10% of the total cost as insurance, which is $80 (since the total cost was $960). Therefore, in total, she paid $720 ($500 + $800 - $80).
"Response:  If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual bonus of $50,000 per year starting from Year 1 to Year 40, then she has received a total bonus of:

$50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000

Since Marcy starts receiving a percentage of the bonus after 20 years, let's calculate the amount she would receive in Year 20:

$2,000,000 x 5% = $100,000

So, in Year 20, Marcy would receive $100,000 as her bonus. Now, let's assume that Marcy stops working after 30 years. In this case, the total amount of bonuses she would have received is:

$2,000,000 x 30 = $60,000,000

Therefore, the total amount of bonuses Marcy would have received throughout her career is $60 million."
"Response: 
Aleena pays for half of the year at an initial payment of $70 (since it is only half a year). Then, in the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than what she paid initially, which means she pays $63 ($70 - $7 = $63). So, the total amount that Aleena has paid for the entire year is $70 + $63 = $133."
Response:  We know that Sophia has been driving for 100 miles since she last filled her tank, and she needs to fill up again with 4 gallons of gasoline. The manual for her car states that it holds 12 gallons of gasoline in total. Therefore, we can calculate the distance Sophia can drive with one tank of gas as follows: Distance = Total amount of fuel / Amount of fuel used So, in this case, Distance = 12 gallons / 4 gallons = 3 miles. Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 3 miles with one tank of gas.
Response:  If Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to sleep or read for half an hour each time, he will spend 2 + (1/2) + (1/2) = 5 hours per week on these activities. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Jim will spend 5 x 4 = 20 hours per month on these activities.
"Response: 
1. There are four schools participating in the competition.
2. Each school has one girls' and one boys' team, with 5 players on each team.
3. Therefore, there are a total of 4 x 2 = 8 teams participating in the competition.
So, the number of people hantared by all schools is 8 x 5 = 40."
Response:  We know that there are 175 berlians in the chest and 35 fewer rubies than berlians. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. Since two times the number of rubies is equal to the total number of precious stones, we can write: 2 x 140 = 280. Therefore, there are 280 precious stones (including both rubies and emeralds) in the chest.
Response:  We know that there are more male students than female students in school Dr. Wertz. So, we can start with the number of male students. There are 2 times as many male students as female students, so the number of male students is twice the number of female students. Therefore, if there are x female students, then there are 2x male students. Now, we have to find out how many teachers are in the school. According to the problem, there are 60 girls and 5 boys for each teacher, which means that there are 60/1 = 60 teachers in total. So, the number of male students is 2x = 120, and the number of female students is x = 60.
Response:  Bailey started with some money (let's call it x). Then he received weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So at the end of 8 weeks, his total amount is $x + 8 \* $5 = 4x + 40. Since he has $100 at the end, we can set up the equation: 4x + 40 = 100. Solving for x, we get x = 25. Therefore, Bailey started with $25.
"Response: 
Judy teaches 5 classes per day during weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday. So, in total, she teaches 5 x 7 = 35 classes per week.
Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students Judy teaches per week is 35 x 15 = 525 students per week.
Since Judy charges $15 per student per class, her total earnings from teaching per week are 525 x $15 = $7,875 per week."
Response:  If Kelian has two recipes to provide food for guests, one with 20 steps and another with twice the number of steps as the first (which is equal to 40 steps). Therefore, Kelian needs to read 40 steps in total to prepare both dishes.
Response:  If Tommy sells each kek coklat for $3 and each cheesecake for $4, then he will make $3 x 43 = $130 from selling kek coklat and $4 x 23 = $92 from selling cheesecakes. Therefore, Tommy can make a total of $130 + $92 = $222.
Response:  The total cost of five mobile phones is $750 (5 x $150). Since there is a discount of 2%, we need to calculate the amount after applying the discount. So, the amount paid by Sheila for each month will be: Total Cost - Discount = $750 - ($750 x 2%) = $680 per month. Therefore, Sheila will pay $680 per month for three months.
Response:  If Artie sells 12 periunks of marigold at $ 2.74 each, then he will make $ 32.08 (12 x $ 2.74). Similarly, if he sells 9 periunks of petunia at $ 1.87 each, he will make $ 16.53 ($ 1.87 x 9). And if he sells 17 periunks of begonia at $ 2.12 each, he will make $ 35.34 ($ 2.12 x 17). So, altogether, Artie will make $ 83.95.
"Response:  If Luke builds a 4-tiered sandcastle with each tier having half of the area of the previous tier (i.e., $ \frac{1}{2} $ times), then we can find the average area of each tier as follows:

Tier 1: $\boxed{\text {Area of Tier 1 = }}$ $\frac{1}{2}$ $\times$ $\text{Total Area} = $ $\frac{1}{2}$ $\times$ $16 = $ $8$ square feet

Tier 2: $\boxed{\text {Area of Tier 2 = }}$ $\frac{1}{4}$ $\times$ $\text{Area of Tier 1} = $ $\frac{1}{4}$ $\times$ $8 = $ $2$ square feet

Tier 3: $\boxed{\text {Area of Tier 3 = }}$ $\frac{1}{8}$ $\times$ $\text{Area of Tier 2} = $ $\frac{1}{8}$ $\times$ $2 = $ $0.5$ square feet

Tier 4: $\boxed{\text {Area of Tier 4 = }}$ $\frac{1}{16}$ $\times$ $\text{Area of Tier 3} = $ $\frac{1}{16}$ $\times$ $0.5 = $ $0.0625$ square feet

Therefore, the average area of each tier is:

$$\boxed{\text{Average Area of Each Tier = }}$$ $\frac{1}{4}$ $\times$ ($8 + $ $2 + $ $0.5 + $ $0.0625) = $ $\approx$ $4.75$ square feet

So, the average area of each level in Luke's sandcastle is approximately $4.75$ square feet."
"Response: 
Cecilia needs to feed her new puppy for 180 days (first year of its life). According to the doctor, she should give the puppy 1 bowl of dog food per day during this period. Then, she needs to continue giving the puppy 2 bowls of dog food per day throughout its lifetime.
If one bowl of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bowls of dog food will Cecilia need in total during the first year of her puppy's life?
Total number of days = 180 days
Number of bowls per day = 1
Total number of bowls = Total number of days x Number of bowls per day
= 180 x 1
= 180 bowls
Therefore, Cecilia will need 180 bowls of dog food during the first year of her puppy's life."
Response:  If Raymond cuci 1/2 of Sarah's clothes and Sarah cuci 4 times as many clothes as David, then the total number of clothes that Raymond and David have cleaned is equal to the number of clothes that Sarah has cleaned multiplied by 4. So, if Sarah cleans 400 pieces of clothing, then the total number of clothes that Raymond and David have cleaned is equal to 400 x 4 = 1600 pieces of clothing.
Response:  If he buys 3 bunches of flowers for $ 2.50 each, then he spends $ 7.50 (3 x $ 2.50). If he buys 2 bunches of flowers for $ 1 each, then he spends $ 2 (2 x $ 1). So, if he buys 18 bunches of flowers with a better price, he will save $ 5 ($ 7.50 - $ 2 = $ 5). Therefore, he will spend $ 5 + $ 2 = $ 7 to buy 18 bunches of flowers with a better price.
"Response:  The cost of grooming without discount is $100. If we apply a 30% discount, the new price will be:
$100 x (1 - 0.3) = $70
So, the cost of grooming after the discount is $70."
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water each, which means they got 24 / 6 = 4 liters of water in total. Then, the boy got 6 liters of water, so there are 4 + 6 = 10 liters of water left. Therefore, there are 24 - 10 = 14 liters of water left.
"Response: 
Charlie has 10 stickers initially. Then he buys 21 more from the shop and gets 23 as a gift for his birthday. He gives 9 stickers to his brother and uses 28 for decorating the greeting card. So, the total number of stickers that Charlie has is:

Initially: 10 + (21 bought from shop) = 31
Later: 31 + (23 gift) = 54
Used: 54 - (9 given away) = 45
Therefore, Charlie has 45 stickers in total."
Response:  The weight of Grace is 125 pounds and the weight of Alex is 2 pounds less than 4 times the weight of Grace. So, the total weight of both of them in pounds is: 125 x 4 = 400 + (2 - 4 x 125) = 400 + (-50) = 350 pounds. Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 350 pounds.
Response:  We have three mango trees with 25 flowers each. Therefore, we have a total of 75 flowers (3 x 25). Each flower has 8 petals, so we have a total of 600 petals (75 x 8).
"Response:  If they won 8 more than they lost, then the number of matches they won is equal to the number of matches they lost plus 8. So, if they played 22 matches, we can write an equation as follows: Won = Lost + 8. Now, we need to solve for ""Won"". Can you do that?"
"Response:  We know that Gene has been traveling for four times a year since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. Therefore, we can calculate how many blocks of quilts he has made as follows:

Yearly trips x Number of blocks per trip = Total number of blocks

Since Gene goes on four trips a year, let's assume each trip takes him to a different place where he buys a new shirt. So, in one year, he makes 4 x 1 = 4 blocks of quilts.

Now, let's calculate the total number of blocks Gene has made over his lifetime:
Total number of blocks = (Number of years traveled) x (Number of blocks per year)
= (34 - 23) x 4
= 960 blocks

Therefore, Gene has made approximately 960 blocks of quilts throughout his life."
"Response: 
Kali pertama - 4 times = 4 x 4 = 16 bunyis
Kali kedua - 3 times longer than kali pertama = (16 x 3) + 1 = 49 bunyis
Kali ketiga - half of kali kedua = (49 / 2) = 24 bunyis
So, the total number of bunyis is 16 + 49 + 24 = 89 bunyis."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate Sylvie's basic salary based on her years of service with the company. Since she has been working for the company for only five years, her basic salary is $600 x 5 = $3000 per year. Then, we need to calculate the annual increase in her salary due to her long-term service with the company. Based on the information provided, the annual increase is 10% of her basic salary, which is $300 (10% of $3000). Therefore, Sylvie's total annual salary after three years will be $3000 + $300 = $3300 per year.
Response:  If Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than Harald, then for every copy that Harald sold, Marilyn sold 10 copies. So if Harald sold x copies, Marilyn sold 10x copies. Now we are told that together they sold 88,000 copies. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 10x + x = 88,000. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x = 88,000. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us: x = 44,000. So Harald sold 44,000 copies.
"Response:  Since there are 16 guests invited and each guest will receive 75 gifts (which is 1/4 of the total number of participants), then the total number of gifts that Christina needs to buy is:

16 x 75 = 1200

So, Christina will need to spend $1200 on gifts."
Response:  If there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, then the total number of people is 20 + 5 = 25. Since each adult will eat 10 pieces of carrot sticks, and each child will eat half as much (since they are smaller), we can calculate the total amount of carrot sticks needed as follows: Adults: 20 x 10 = 200 Carrot sticks Children: 5 x 5 = 25 Carrot sticks Total: 200 + 25 = 225 Carrot sticks Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 carrot sticks to the picnic if he wants enough for everyone to have some.
"Response: 
1. Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. So if Marcia has x pets, Jan has 3x pets.
2. Marcia loves two pets more than Cindy. So Cindy has x - 2 pets.
3. If Cindy has four pets, then the total number of pets that Jan and Marcia have is equal to 3x + (x - 2) = 4x.
Therefore, the answer is 4x."
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Emily has four children named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.
Amy is five years older than Jackson.
Corey is two years younger than Amy.
James is ten years old and one year younger than Corey.
So, we can write the following equations based on the information provided:
Age of Amy = Age of Jackson + 5 (Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
Age of Corey = Age of Amy - 2 (Since Corey is 2 years younger than Amy)
Age of James = Age of Corey - 1 (Since James is 1 year younger than Corey)
Now, let's substitute the values for each equation:
Age of Amy = 30 + 5 = 35 (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
Age of Corey = 35 - 2 = 33 (since Corey is 2 years younger than Amy)
Age of James = 33 - 1 = 32 (since James is 1 year younger than Corey)
Therefore, the age of Jackson is 32 years old."
Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds with his current speed, then Gerald's original running speed was (400 meters / 38 seconds) = 10.5 meters per second. Now, if Gerald improves his diet and increases his running speed by 10%, then his new running speed is (10.5 meters/second x 1.10) = 11.65 meters per second. So, Gerald can run 400 meters in approximately 35.7 seconds (rounded to nearest whole number).
"Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 12 less than the total number of cats and dogs in the shelter. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many animals are in the shelter?
Let's use algebraic notation to represent the variables involved:
Let x be the total number of animals (cats + dogs) in the shelter.
Since there are 12 fewer than the total number of animals, we can write:
x - 12 = Total number of cats
x - 12 = Number of dogs
From the problem statement, we know that there are two cats for every dog, so:
Number of cats = 2(number of dogs)
Substituting the value of x - 12 from the previous equation into this one gives us:
Number of cats = 2(60 - 12)
= 2(48)
= 96
Therefore, there are 96 animals in the shelter, including both cats and dogs."
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in Class 5, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls who are Girl Scouts. So, the number of girls who are not Girl Scouts is 2/3 - 2/5 = 1/5 or 20%. Therefore, there are 80% (or 160) girls who are not Girl Scouts among the 200 students in Class 5.
"Response:  If Harry sleeps for 9 hours per night and his friend James sleeps for 2/3 of Harry's time, then we can calculate how many hours Harry sleeps more than James as follows:

Harry sleeps for 9 hours = 720 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
James sleeps for 2/3 of Harry's time = 432 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 2/3 is equal to 432/60)
So, Harry sleeps 288 minutes more than James (720 - 432)."
Response:  If Freda loses half of her initial amount of tomatoes when cooking them in a tin, then she must have started with an original amount of x tomatoes. Since each batch of 16 auns of sos can contain three tomatoes, we know that Freda used x/3 tomatoes to make her final batch of sos. Therefore, the number of tomatoes Freda originally had is x/3.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that there are 20 trains passing through in 15 minutes without any delay (first part of the question).
Then, 5 trains take an alternative route to avoid congestion (second part of the question).
So, the total number of trains passing through is 20 + 5 = 25 trains.
Therefore, the answer is 25 trains pass through during the first 15 minutes of congestion."
Response:  Mary has 2 tanaman in each of her 40 tingkat (level) of her big house. So she has 80 tanaman in total. If she gives away 1 tanaman to each of her friends and family tomorrow, then she will have 73 tanaman left (80 - 7 = 73).
"Response:  
Kawan pertama menekan loceng pintu 20 kali sebelum Jerome membuka. So, there are 20 loceng pintu before Jerome opened it. 
Kawan kedua menekan loceng pintu 1/4 kali lebih daripada kawan pertama. So, there are (20 x 4) = 80 loceng pintu after kawan kedua pressed it. 
Kawan ketiga menekan loceng pintu 10 kali lebih banyak daripada kawan keempat. So, there are (80 x 5) = 400 loceng pintu after kawan ketiga pressed it. 
If kawan keempat menekan loceng pintu 60 kali, then there are 60 x 5 = 300 loceng pintu after he pressed it. Therefore, the total number of loceng pintu is 20 + 80 + 400 + 300 = 900 loceng pintu."
"Response: 
Solo has to read 4 pages from the science book, 20 pages from the social studies book, 7 pages from the history book, and 8 pages from the geography book. In total, he needs to read 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages in one day. So, if he has 4 days left to finish all the reading, he will need to read approximately 39/4 = 9.75 pages per day."
"Response: 
John drinks water with his breakfast every day (3 times).
He drinks water during lunchtime every day (2 times).
He drinks water before dinner every day (1 time).
In total, he drinks water 6 times per day.
Since he takes a break from drinking water at the end of the week and only drinks soda once, we subtract that one instance. So, John drinks water 5 times in one week."
Response:  The beach is 42 stones long and it takes him 10 minutes to cover each group of 3 stones. Therefore, he will need 42 / 3 = 14 minutes to cover the entire beach.
Response:  If Poppy has already placed 500 pieces of puzzle, and her mother places 250 more pieces, then there are altogether 750 pieces of puzzle left to be placed. So, the answer is 750.
Response:  If Cody can eat three times more biscuits than Amir, that means Cody can eat 3 x 5 = 15 biscuits. So, if they both eat together, they will eat 5 + 15 = 20 biscuits.
Response:  The total volume of each box is given as follows: Volume of first box = length x width x height = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches Volume of second box = length x width x height = 6 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 144 cubic inches Volume of third box = length x width x height = 7 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 288 cubic inches Total volume of all three boxes = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box = 120 cubic inches + 144 cubic inches + 288 cubic inches = 642 cubic inches Therefore, the total volume of all three boxes is 642 cubic inches.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one hour of his favorite show each night. So, he watches two hours in total (one hour x two days). On Wednesday, he watches three episodes of his favorite show, which last for 30 minutes each. Therefore, he watches a total of six hours (three episodes x 30 minutes per episode). On Thursday, he finishes work early and watches an extra hour of his favorite show. So, he watches seven hours in total (one hour x two days + six hours). Finally, on Friday, he can only watch two episodes due to his busy schedule, so he watches a total of four hours (two episodes x 60 minutes per episode). Thus, if he watches seven hours of TV, he must have watched at least 28 episodes of his favorite show during the week (seven hours / 30 minutes per episode = 28 episodes).
Response:  If Henry made twice as many cookies last year and he dropped 5 of them while arranging them, then this means that he actually baked 2 x 15 = 30 more cookies than he intended to make. So, the total number of cookies he baked is 110 - 5 = 105. Therefore, the answer is 105.
Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon, they will pay $30 for the gas itself ($3.00 x 10 gallons). Now, if the company offers $20 cashback per gallon, then the total amount of cashback they will receive is $200 (($20 x 10 gallons) - $30 = $200). So, after getting the cashback, their final cost for the gas will be $50 ($30 + $200 - $30 = $50).
Response:  If both of them eat completely, then they will have eaten altogether 2 x (2 roll-ups wide + 24 roll-ups long) = 48 roll-ups and 3 x (3 roll-ups wide + 14 roll-ups long) = 42 roll-ups. So, in total, they will have eaten 90 roll-ups.
"Response:  The distance that Julia traveled with her boat is given as 20 kaki (feet). Since she took two liters of water for every ten feet she traveled, we can write an equation based on this information:

Liters of water taken = Distance traveled x 2 liters/10 feet

Now, we are told that it took Julia 16 seconds to travel each foot, so the time it took her to travel 20 feet is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds/foot = 1.25 minutes

Since Julia started at the lake and ended up at the beach, the total distance she traveled is equal to the distance between these two points:

Total distance = Beach - Lake = 64 seconds - 16 seconds = 48 seconds

So, the number of liters of water that Julia took from the lake is:

Number of liters = Total distance x 2 liters/10 feet = 48 seconds x 2 liters/10 feet = 96 liters

Therefore, the answer is 96 liters."
"Response:  The number of times the whiteboard is erased in one day can be calculated as follows:
Number of classes = Number of teachers x Number of students per class
= 4 teachers x 30 students/class (assuming each class has 30 students)
= 120 classes
Since each teacher teaches 2 subjects per day and uses the whiteboard for both subjects, we need to divide the total number of classes by 2 to get the number of times the whiteboard is used per day:
Total number of times the whiteboard is used per day = Total number of classes / 2
= 120 classes / 2
= 60 times
So, the whiteboard is erased 60 times in one day."
Response:  If Ryan has 2 flowers per day for 15 days, then he will have 30 flowers in total (2 x 15 = 30). However, if 5 of them do not grow, then Ryan will only have 25 flowers left (30 - 5 = 25). Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  We know that Telefon Jamal can store 1800 images and Telefon Brittany can store 6 times more than Telefon Jamal, which means it can store 1800 x 6 = 10,800 images. Now we need to find out how many images of birds are shown in the picture taken by Jamal about the bird at the zoo. Since the number of images is less than or equal to 10,800, we can conclude that there are at most 10,800 / 50 = 216 birds in the image taken by Jamal about the bird at the zoo. Therefore, there are 216 birds in the image taken by Jamal about the bird at the zoo.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the wood that Sasha has purchased: Total Cost = (10 x $10) + (5 x $16) = $180 Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the wood: Revenue = Total Cost x Number of Papers Sold = $180 x??? Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the revenue to find out the profit: Profit = Revenue - Total Cost =??? Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Profit = $180 x 30 = $5400 So, Sasha can gain a profit of $5400 if she sells all her wood.
"Response:  If Katy uses 7 parts of tea leaves for every 1 part of water and she uses 120 parts of tea leaves in total, then we can calculate the number of parts of water used as follows:

Number of parts of water = Total amount of tea leaves / Number of parts of tea leaves per unit of water
= 120 / 7
= 17 (approximately)
So, Katy used approximately 17 parts of water to make her cup of tea."
Response:  If John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, then he will buy a total of 6 pairs of shoes (2 x 3 = 6). Since each pair costs $60, John will pay a total of $360 ($60 x 6 pairs). Therefore, John will pay $360.
Response:  On day one, there are two containers with 5 kenderaans each, so the total number of kenderaans imported is 10 (2 x 5). On the second day, more containers arrive, and we know that the total number of containers has increased to 30. Since each container can hold up to 5 kenderaans, the total number of kenderaans imported on the second day is also 30 (30 / 5 = 6). Therefore, the answer is 46 (10 + 6).
"Response:  We know that Adrien's salary is currently 30% higher than Lylah's and it has increased by 40% from four years ago. So, Adrien's current salary can be calculated as follows:
Adrien's current salary = (Lylah's current salary x 1.3) + ($40,000 x 1.4)
Substituting the given values, we get:
Adrien's current salary = ($50,000 x 1.3) + ($40,000 x 1.4)
Adrien's current salary = $62,000
Therefore, the total amount of money that both Adrien and Lylah received in their salaries after four years is:
Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
= $62,000 +?
The blank represents the unknown value of Lylah's current salary. Since Lylah's salary was initially 70% lower than Adrien's, and it has increased by 40% over time, we can calculate her current salary as follows:
Lylah's current salary = (Adrien's current salary / 1.7) x 100
Substituting the given values, we get:
Lylah's current salary = ($62,000 / 1.7) x 100
Lylah's current salary = $38,000
So, the total amount of money that both Adrien and Lylah received in their salaries after four years is:
Total salary = $62,000 + $38,000
Total salary = $100,000"
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week for his drawing, and there are 30 sheets in each pad, then he will use 60 sheets (2 x 30) per month. So, he will use 60 x 4 = 240 sheets of paper per year. Therefore, the answer is 240 sheets of paper per year.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Therefore, the total number of fruits that Morisette brought is 5 + 8 = 13. Now, we are told that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Additionally, Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette, which means he brought 2/3 x 8 = 6 oranges. So, in total, both Morisette and Kael brought 13 + 10 + 6 = 29 fruits.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, Sadie slept for 8 hours each day. So in total, she slept for 16 hours (8 + 8). Then, on Wednesday and Thursday, she slept for 2 hours less than the previous days, which means she slept for 6 hours each day (8 - 2 = 6). Therefore, in total, Sadie slept for 22 hours (16 + 6) throughout the week.
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 boulders for 3 hours, then she has covered a distance of 10 x 3 = 30 boulders. After that, if she runs 5 boulders in an hour, then she covers a distance of 5 x 7 = 35 boulders in 7 hours. Therefore, Rosie can run 30 + 35 = 65 boulders in 7 hours.
"Response: 
Jennie has already sorted 2/3 of the total letters that needed stamps (60 / 3 = 20). So there are 40 letters left to sort (60 - 20 = 40).
Now, there are 30 letters in the pile that have already been stamped. Therefore, the number of letters remaining in the pile when Jennie started sorting is 40 - 30 = 10."
"Response: 
Step 1: Julia bought one package of new plastic containers (su du). We know this because she ran out of plastic containers and had to buy more. So, there is one new container in the equation.
Step 2: Julia used three containers to cook her dish. This means that after Step 1, we have four containers left (three used + one new).
Step 3: Julia's husband also bought five new containers and gave them to Julia. This means that now we have nine containers in total (four from before + five new).
Step 4: Julia used three containers to prepare the table. This means that after Step 3, we have six containers left (nine - three = six).
So, the number of containers in the package that Julia bought is six."
"Response:  We know that Dylan needs at least 20 pieces of chicken and fish to make the sandwiches for the party. So he buys 38 pieces of chicken and 6 pieces of fish more than the number of chicken pieces needed. Therefore, the total number of pieces of chicken bought by Dylan is:

38 + 6 = 44

So, Dylan buys 44 pieces of chicken."
Response:  If Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, then Lily has x friends and Amy has x + 20 = 70 friends. So, the number of friends Lily has is 50 - x. Therefore, the number of friends both Lily and Amy have together is 50 - x + 20 = 30.
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to find out how much one semangka costs. According to the question, the price of semangka is three times that of lada, so if one lada costs $15, then one semangka costs $15 x 3 = $45.
Secondly, we need to find out how many ladas Dillon bought. The question states that he bought 20 ladas, so their total cost is $20 x $15 = $300.
Lastly, we need to find out how much jeruk costs. According to the question, the price of jeruk is five less than that of semangka, so if one semangka costs $45, then one jeruk costs $45 - $5 = $40.
Therefore, the total amount that Dillon will pay for all the fruits is $300 + $40 = $340."
Response:  The number of patients seen per day is 500. Each patient takes an average of 24 minutes to be seen by the doctor. So, the total time spent by doctors seeing patients per day is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. Now, each doctor earns $150 per day and the hospital charges each patient $200 per visit. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the hospital from these visits is 12,000 x $150 = $180,000 per day. So, the profit earned by the hospital from these visits is $180,000 - $120,000 = $60,000 per day.
Response:  We know that out of 60 workers hired by Nissa to play Peri in Kampung Santa, 20 (or 33%) stopped working after getting sick. Then, 10 more elves who were still working stopped after their children got sick. So, the total number of elves who stopped working is 30 (20 + 10). Therefore, there are 30 elves who tinggal (remained) after the incident.
Response:  The amount of expenditure in May is $ 500. In June, there is a decrease of $ 60, so the total amount of spending in June is $ 440 ($ 500 - $ 60). Therefore, the total amount of spending for two months is $ 940 ($ 500 + $ 440).
"Response: 
Pam and Fred went to a carnival together. Pam rode the roller coaster twice while Fred rode it four times. After that, each of them decided to ride the luge twice. If each ride costs 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use in total that day?
Let P be the number of tickets used by Pam for all her rides and F be the number of tickets used by Fred for all his rides. We know that P + F = 10 (since Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times). Also, we know that P + 2F = 18 (since Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode the luge twice). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
P = 3
F = 6
So, Pam used 3 tickets for all her rides and Fred used 6 tickets for all his rides. In total, they used 9 tickets (3 + 6) that day at the carnival."
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Walt walked 4 batu. On Tuesday (Selasa), he walked 6 times more than he walked on Monday, so he walked 24 batu (6 x 4 = 24). On Wednesday (Rabu), the total distance he traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 batu, so he walked 41 - 24 = 17 batu on Wednesday. Therefore, Walt walked 17 batu on Wednesday.
Response:  If Tom gets 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $ 15, then he will pay $ 15 x 4 = $ 60 per month for car washing services. Therefore, in one year (i.e., 12 months), Tom will pay $ 60 x 12 = $ 720 for car washing services.
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 video games and is short of 5 from reaching 3 times more than Bobby. So, if Brian has 20 video games, then Bobby must have 60 video games (3 x 20 = 60). Therefore, the correct answer is 60.
Response:  According to the question, there are 27 unicorns in total and one-third of them live in Scotland (i.e., 9 unicorns). Since two-thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female (i.e., 6 unicorns), we can conclude that there are 6 + 3 = 9 female unicorns in Scotland. Therefore, the number of female unicorns in Scotland is 9.
"Response: 
Rory charges $7.50 for each meme, so if he sells 2 memes, his total revenue from those sales would be $15 (2 x $7.50).
For the first two biscuits, Rory charges $1.50 each, so his total revenue from those sales would be $3 (2 x $1.50).
For the second batch of biscuits, Rory charges $1.00 each, so his total revenue from those sales would be $2 (2 x $1.00).
Total revenue = $15 + $3 + $2 = $20
So, the cost of shipping is $20 x 20% = $4. Therefore, the amount that Rory needs to pay for shipping is $4."
Response:  If Mark took 75 questions per day and solved them with an efficiency of 5 questions per hour, then he would take 15 hours to solve all 75 questions (75/5 = 15). Now, if he takes another test consisting of 100 questions today, it means that he will spend additional time solving those questions. So, the total time taken by Mark to solve both tests is: Total Time = Time for First Test + Time for Second Test = 15 hours + Time for Second Test Therefore, the number of questions left incomplete by Mark is: Number of Incomplete Questions = Total Time / Efficiency = 15 hours / 5 questions per hour = 3 hours Since Mark has 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second test, we can conclude that he spent 3 hours completing the remaining questions from the second test.
Response:  We know that there are 4 times more red beads than blue beads in total. So if there are x blue beads, then there are 4x red beads. If there are 12 blue beads, then there are 48 red beads (since 4x = 12). Therefore, there are 36 red beads of the same color as the blue beads.
Response:  We know that out of 20 cars available for rent, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is 6 (20 - 12 - 4). Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 30% (6/20 x 100%).
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in the hive and twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, the number of worker bees is 700 x 2 = 1400. Therefore, there are 1400 worker bees in the hive.
"Response: 
Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day and works part-time for $ 10/hour. To calculate how much money Jordan will earn in a week if he spends his time playing video games while working, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends playing video games with his hourly wage from work, then add that amount to his total weekly income from work. So, let's do it like this:
Hours spent playing video games = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week
Hourly wage from work = $ 10/hour
Total weekly income from work = Hours worked x Hourly wage = 14 hours/week x $ 10/hour = $ 140/week
Therefore, Jordan will earn $ 140/week if he spends his time playing video games while working."
Response:  The total cost of all items is given as follows: Susu = $2, Telur = $3, Mentol Lampu = $3, Cawan = $3, and Perangkap Kecoak = $4. Therefore, the total cost of all items is: Total Cost = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15. Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, the amount of tax paid is: Tax = $15 x 10% = $1.50. So, the final price after tax is: Final Price = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of materials for each customer. For Customer 1, it will be $2 x 2 = $4 for the bottles and $5 x 1 = $5 for the cloth. Similarly, for Customer 2, it will be $4 + $5 = $9. For Customer 3, it will be $4 + $5 = $9 as well. Now, let's move on to the potential customers (Customers 4-6). For Customer 4, it will be $4 + $5 = $9 again. For Customer 5, it will be $4 + $5 = $9 once more. And for Customer 6, it will be $4 + $5 = $9 yet again! So, in total, Lucas will make $9 x 6 = $54 per week from selling these cleaning products. Therefore, his profit is $54 - $30 = $24 per week.
"Response: 
John has 10 hectares of land for orange cultivation. Since there are 100 oranges per hectare, John has a total of 1000 oranges (10 x 100 = 1000).
Since John can harvest his oranges every 3 months, he will be able to harvest them 4 times in one year (4 x 3 = 12).
Therefore, John will have a total of 1000 x 12 = 12,000 oranges in one year."
Response:  The first box contains 500 blocks, and the second one has 3 times as many blocks as the first box, which means it contains 3 x 500 = 1500 blocks. Finally, there is another box that contains 1/4 of the total number of blocks, so it contains 1500 / 4 = 375 blocks. Therefore, Johnny has taken a total of 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 blocks in all.
Response:  We know that there are 30 bees that left the nest during the first 6 hours and half of them returned within the next 6 hours. So, the number of bees that did not return to the nest is 30/2 = 15 bees. Therefore, the number of bees that returned to the nest during the last 6 hours is 15 + 30 = 45 bees.
Response:  The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. If Brittany's mother gives $8 as change to the cashier, then she must have paid $4 for her own ticket (being an adult). So, the amount that Brittany's mother gave to the cashier is $4 + $4 = $8.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times more friends than Dorothy on Facebook. So, if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends. Moreover, James has four times more friends than Dorothy. Therefore, James has 4x friends. Now, we are given that Charlie has 12 friends. So, we can write an equation as follows: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Hence, James has 4x = 16 friends on Facebook.
"Response: 
Steve is closer to the school than Tim, so he can bike faster. The distance between Steve and the school is 3 stones, which means he can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute (since there are 5 stones in one bat).
Tim is 2 stones away from the school, so he can also bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. However, since Tim starts later than Steve, he will have to wait for Steve to finish before he can start his race. Therefore, Tim's time will be longer than Steve's time.
Let T be the time taken by Tim to reach the school, and S be the time taken by Steve. Since Steve has already finished his race, we know that S = 440/5 = 88 minutes.
Now, let's find out how long Tim will take to reach the school:
T = Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed = 2 stones / 440 feet/minute = 55 minutes
Therefore, if Tim takes 55 minutes to reach the school, Steve will have waited for him for 31 minutes (55 - 88) before starting his race."
Response:  On day one, there are 5 people who use the basic service and pay RM 1 for each ride. So, they paid a total of RM 5 x 5 = RM 25. Now, let's calculate how much money Shawnda made from these riders. Since 3 out of the 5 riders paid for their entire balance, Shawnda earned RM 3 x RM 25 = RM 75 from them. Therefore, Shawnda made a total of RM 25 + RM 75 = RM 100 that day.
Response:  If Carl buys 10 packs of cookies and each pack contains 6 cookies, then he has bought a total of 60 cookies (10 x 6 = 60). Since each cookie costs $0.10, the total cost of all the cookies is $6 (60 x $0.10 = $6). So, if Carl pays with cash, he will receive $4 ($10 - $6) in change.
"Response: 
Dave bought $4$ packets of fried chicken and ate $14$ pieces before a seagull stole them from him. If the seagull ate $\frac{1}{2}$ of the remaining chicken, then how many pieces were left?
The seagull ate $\frac{3}{4}$ of the remaining chicken, so there were $\frac{7}{4}$ pieces left.
Then, three crows took $\frac{3}{4}$ of the remaining pieces, leaving $\frac{5}{4}$ pieces.
A rat took $\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining pieces, leaving $\frac{3}{3}$ pieces.
Finally, an ant carried away the last piece, leaving $5$.
So, when Dave bought the fried chicken, he had $5$ pieces in total."
Response:  On Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, there are three classes of 1 hour each, so that is 3 hours per day. On Wednesday and Friday, there are two classes of 2 hours each, so that is 4 hours per day. In total, Kimo spends 7 hours per day in class (3 + 4). Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 112 hours (7 x 16) attending classes per semester.
"Response: 
For rotis, there are 300 of them, and each one is 4 inches long. So, the total length of all rotis is 300 x 4 = 1200 inches.
For keropok coklat, there are 120 of them, and each one is 6 inches long. So, the total length of all keropok coklat is 120 x 6 = 720 inches.
For baguettes, there are 60 of them, and each one is 2 feet long (or 2 x 3 = 6 feet). So, the total length of all baguettes is 60 x 6 = 360 feet.
Now, let's add up the lengths of all the food items: 1200 + 720 + 360 = 2280 inches.
Therefore, if Bill places all the baked goods end to end, they will be 2280 inches long."
Response:  The total number of bananas needed for two months is calculated as follows: For monkeys (200 + 400 + 100) = 700 bananas For gorillas (400 x 2) = 800 bananas For orangs (100 x 2) = 200 bananas Total number of bananas needed = 700 + 800 + 200 = 1700 bananas Therefore, the zookeeper needs to buy 1700 bananas every two months.
"Response: 
Step 1: Blake runs for 15 minutes straight. Since he is running at a constant speed, we can assume that he covers a distance of $x$ meters in this time.
Step 2: Kelly decides to run behind and in front of Blake 15 times. Each time he runs behind Blake, he covers half the distance that Blake covered ($x/2$). Then, when he runs in front of Blake, he covers the remaining distance ($x - x/2$). Therefore, Kelly covers a total distance of $K = \frac{x}{2} + (x - x/2) = \boxed{x}$ meters.
Step 3: Now, since Kelly ran only once from the starting point to the finish line, which is 40 yards away from the start, he covers a distance of $\text {yards} = 40$.
So, the difference in distance between Kelly and Blake after 15 minutes is:
$$\text{Distance between Kelly and Blake} = x - \text{yards} = x - 40 = \boxed{x - 40}$$
Therefore, the answer is $x - 40$."
Response:  Raphael bought 4 pens that cost $ 1.5 each, so he spent $ 6 for the pens. He also bought 2 notebooks that cost $ 4 each, so he spent $ 8 for the notebooks. Finally, he bought a folder that cost $ 20. Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $ 6 + $ 8 + $ 20 = $ 34. So, the answer is $ 34.
Response:  At first, Finn saw 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, he noticed that 6 of them were hiding underneath the lily pad. Later, he found out that 2 more were hiding beneath the rock. So, if we add up all these numbers, there are now 11 + 6 + 2 = 19 tadpoles that Finn can see in the pond. Therefore, the correct answer is 19.
"Response:  On Monday (Selasa), the depth of water in the tank was 17 feet. On Tuesday (Rabu), the depth of water was two-thirds of what it was on Monday. So, if we let x be the depth of water on Monday, then we can write:

Depth of water on Tuesday = 2/3x

Now, we are given that the depth of water on Tuesday was 7 feet more than it was on Monday. So, we can write:

Depth of water on Tuesday = 2/3x + 7

Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do that?"
"Response: 
Anakin caught 10 stars, 6 horses, and 3 fish.
Locsin caught 5 fewer stars than Anakin, 3 fewer horses than Anakin, and 2 more fish than Anakin.
So, if Anakin caught 10 stars, then Locsin caught 5 stars (since he caught 5 fewer). If Anakin caught 6 horses, then Locsin caught 1 horse less (since he caught 5 fewer). And if Anakin caught 3 fish, then Locsin caught 2 more fish (since he caught 2 more).
Therefore, the total number of stars that both Anakin and Locsin caught is 10 + 5 = 15. The total number of horses they caught is 6 + 1 = 7. And the total number of fish they caught is 3 + 2 = 5."
"Response:  The initial price of one marble is $20, and it increases by 20% every two months. After three years (36 months), the new price will be calculated as follows:

Year 1: Price = $20 x (1 + 0.2) = $24
Year 2: Price = $24 x (1 + 0.2) = $28.80
Year 3: Price = $28.80 x (1 + 0.2) = $33.79
Therefore, after 36 months, the cost of one marble will be approximately $33.79."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red trains and 3 action figures in the room. The doll is worth 3 action figures and one red train worth $4. So, the total value of all the toys is equal to 3 x $3 = $9 + $4 = $13. Therefore, there are 13 toys in total with a combined value of $13.
Response:  If Jackie does her own taxes and works for 3 hours without paying an accountant, she will lose $35 per hour in income. So if she works for 3 hours, she will lose $105 ($35 x 3). Now let's consider how much more money Jackie would have if she had hired an accountant instead of doing it herself. The cost of hiring an accountant is $90, so if Jackie hires an accountant, she will save $105 - $90 = $15. Therefore, the amount of money that Jackie will have left after hiring an accountant is $15.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira spent € 1090 for the computer itself (mesin). Then she took additional accessories such as keyboard, mouse, and speakers which cost her € 157 + € 74 + € 102 = € 333. Therefore, in total, Elvira spent € 1090 + € 333 = € 1423. So, she will have € 1423 - € 1500 = € -177 left for clothes.
Response:  If Sandra needs to make 15 flans of Spanish omelette and each flan requires 3 eggs, then she will need 45 eggs (15 x 3 = 45). Since she can take care of her baby 9 times a week, she will need to do this task 45 / 9 = 5 times a week. Therefore, Sandra will need to take care of her baby 5 times a week to make 15 flans of Spanish omelette for the school fundraiser.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Seth is currently 3 years older than Brooke. So, if Brooke is x years old, then Seth is 3 + x years old. In two years, both will be 2 years older, so their ages will become 3 + x + 2 = 5x + 4. Now we know that in 2 years, their combined age will be 50 (2 times 28). Therefore, Seth's current age is 50 - 3 = 47 years old.
Response:  We know that Jimmy has more than twice as much money as Ethel. So if Ethel has $8, then Jimmy must have at least $16 (twice $8). Therefore, Jimmy has at least $16.
"Response:  If Pancho walks 30 kilometers every day except for the last day of the week when he walks 10 stones, then we can calculate how many stones he walked in total during the week as follows:
Total distance = Total daily distance x Number of days + Special case (last day)
= 30 km/day x 7 days + 10 km
= 210 km + 10 km
= 220 km
Therefore, Pancho walked 220 stones during the week."
Response:  The cost of each shirt is three times that of the hat, so if the hat costs $25, then the shirt costs $75 ($25 x 3 = $75). Next, we know that the jacket costs twice as much as the shirt, so if the shirt costs $75, then the jacket costs $150 ($75 x 2 = $150). Finally, we know that the sleeves cost half as much as the jacket, so if the jacket costs $150, then the sleeves cost $75 ($150 / 2 = $75). Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $25 + $75 + $75 = $225.
"Response: 
Jake saw 80 beetles with each having 8 feet, so he saw a total of 80 x 8 = 640 feet of beetles.
He also saw 90 insects with each having 6 feet, so he saw a total of 90 x 6 = 540 feet of insects.
Finally, he saw 3 mutant invertebrates with each having 10 feet, so he saw a total of 3 x 10 = 30 feet of mutants.
Therefore, Jake saw a total of 640 + 540 + 30 = 1470 feet of creatures."
"Response:  We know that there are four birds in total and they are named after numbers from one to four (Ada, Sally, Red, and Burp). From the information given, we can deduce the following facts about their ages:
* Sally is two years older than Red.
* Red is twice as old as Burp.
* Sally is 32 years old.
* Sally was 8 years old when she met Burp.
Now let's use these clues to calculate the age of each bird:
1. Ada - Since Ada is not mentioned in any of the statements, her age cannot be determined directly. However, since there are only four birds in total, we can assume that Ada is also 32 years old like Sally.
2. Sally - As stated earlier, Sally is 32 years old.
3. Red - Red is twice as old as Burp, which means he is 64 years old (since Burp is 8 years old).
4. Burp - Burp is 8 years old.
Therefore, the combined age of all four birds is:
Ada = 32 years old
Sally = 32 years old
Red = 64 years old
Burp = 8 years old
So the sum of their ages is 174 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of debts that Jessica has. The total amount of debts = Minimum payment for each loan + Interest rate x Total outstanding balance. For example, the minimum payment for her first loan is $300 per month, and the interest rate is 1%. So, the total amount of debt for this loan after one year is $3600 ($300 x 12 months). Similarly, the total amount of debt for her second loan is $2400 ($200 x 12 months), and the total amount of debt for her third loan is $7200 ($500 x 12 months). Therefore, the total amount of debts that Jessica has is $13800 ($3600 + $2400 + $7200). Now, if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, then she needs to pay $1950 per month (50% of $3900) for all three loans combined. This means that in one year, she will have paid a total of $23400 ($1950 x 12 months) towards her debts.
"Response: 
1. Billy takes approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel each potato (since he takes roughly 1 minute for every 2 potatoes).
Therefore, it will take him around 60 minutes to peel all 60 potatoes (60 x 1 min 30 sec = 9000 seconds).
2. However, Billy only spends roughly 5 seconds to cut each potato after peeling them (since he takes roughly 5 seconds for every 2 potatoes).
So, it will take him around 60 minutes to cut all 60 potatoes (60 x 5 sec = 3000 seconds).
In total, Billy will spend around 12 minutes (9000 + 3000 = 12,000 seconds) to prepare all 60 potatoes for the family gathering."
Response:  We know that Juan and Carlos sell each glass of lemonade for $0.50, so they make $0.50 x 20 = $10 per gallon. Since they sell one gallon, their total revenue is $10. Now we need to find out how much they spend on lemons. They buy lemons for $3 each, so they spend $3 x number of gallons sold = $3x. Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up an equation as follows: $10 + $3x = $25. Solving for x, we get $3x = $18. So they spent $18 on lemons. Therefore, they made $10 - $18 = -$8 on lemon sales.
Response:  We know that there are 240 people from Asia, and among them, 80 are Japanese. So, the number of Asian males is 240 - 80 = 160. Now, we know that 60 of these males are Chinese, so the number of Chinese females must be equal to the total number of female soldiers minus the number of male soldiers who are not Chinese. Therefore, the number of Chinese females is 160 - 60 = 100.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Zaid spends for rent and car fuel. As he pays 1/4 of his salary for rent, it means he spends $ 1500 ( $ 6000 x 1/4) for rent. Similarly, he spends $ 500 ( $ 6000 x 1/3) for car fuel. Therefore, the total amount of money that Zaid spends is $ 2000 ($ 1500 + $ 500). Next, let's calculate how much money he gives to his children and wife. He gives $ 200 to his daughter for her weekly expenses and $ 700 to his wife for household expenses. So, the total amount of money given away is $ 900 ($ 200 + $ 700). Finally, let's check how much money is left after all these transactions. If Zaid gets $ 6000 per month and he spends $ 2000 and gives away $ 900, then there are $ 3100 remaining ($ 6000 - $ 2000 - $ 900 = $ 3100).
Response:  According to the question, Rani has more than ten ketams than Monica, who has fewer than four ketams less than Bo. So, if Bo has 40 ketams, together they have how many ketams?  Therefore, the answer is 54 (10 + 4 = 54).
Response:  For the first week (Week 1), Lloyd taught for 5 hours, so he earned $5 x 5 = $25. For the second week (Week 2), he taught for 8 hours, so he earned $8 x 2 = $16. Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $25 + $16 = $41 for the two weeks.
Response:  The total number of votes is equal to the number of students in the class who voted plus the number of votes received by the winner. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Votes = Number of Students x Undo Received + Winner's Votes. Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: Total Votes = 80 x 3/4 + X (where X is the number of votes received by the loser). Solving for X, we get: X = 60. Therefore, the number of votes received by the loser is 60.
Response:  According to the question, Sandra has ordered 4 times more red roses than white ones, which means she has ordered 4 x 10 = 40 white roses and 4 x 20 = 80 red roses in total. Additionally, she has ordered 200 Calla lilies, which are five times as many as the white roses. So, if we assume that each delivery takes up to 5 pm, then Fred needs to deliver 40 + 80 + 200 = 300 roses before 5 pm. Therefore, the answer is 300.
Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, if Jan is currently 30 years old, then 2 years ago, Mark would have been 30 + 5 = 35 years old. Now, we are told that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean is currently 37 years old (35 + 2).
Response:  The first runner of team A finishes their 400 meters in 55 seconds, and each subsequent runner takes 3 seconds less than the previous one to complete their race. Therefore, the second runner of team A finishes their race in 52 seconds (55 - 3 = 52). Similarly, the third runner of team A finishes their race in 49 seconds (52 - 3 = 49), and so on. Now, let's calculate the time taken by each runner of team B to complete their 400 meters. Since they are slower than team A, it will take them longer to finish their race. For example, the first runner of team B finishes their race in 60 seconds + 3 seconds = 63 seconds (since they took 3 seconds more than the corresponding runner of team A). Therefore, we can conclude that team A will win the race since their total time is lower than team B's total time. So, the answer is: Team A will win the race in 218 seconds (55 + 52 + 49 +... + x) where x represents the time taken by the last runner of team B to complete their race.
Response:  If Jerry throws six darts and gets two numbers that are odd, then there is a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ that he will throw a number greater than $3$. So, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together take half of their peanut harvest (which is 20 epal), then they must have collected 40 epal in total (half of 80). So, if Jenna took 1/3 of what her mother had, she would have taken 13 epal (1/3 x 40 = 13).
Response:  We know that there are 3 sangkars and each sangkar contains 6 tikus. So, in total, we have 3 x 6 = 18 tikus in all the sangkars combined. Now, let's consider how many jerami are given to each tikus. Each tikus is given 6 jerami, so altogether, we have 18 x 6 = 108 jerami distributed among all the tikus. Next, we need to find out how much jerami are left after giving it to all the tikus. If 160 jerami were initially available, then after distributing it among all the tikus, we will have 160 - 108 = 52 jerami left. Therefore, there are 52 jerami left after giving it to all the tikus.
"Response:  If Mandy pays back the debt of $100 with an interest rate of 2% per month for 3 months, we can calculate it as follows:

Month 1:
Mandy owes $100 + ($100 x 2%) = $100 + $2 = $102

Month 2:
Mandy owes $102 + ($102 x 2%) = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

Month 3:
Mandy owes $104.04 + ($104.04 x 2%) = $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12

Therefore, after 3 months, Mandy should pay Benedict $106.12 to settle the debt in full, including the interest."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total cost of transportation is $ 2 x number of begs = $ 2 x 10 begs = $ 20. Next, we can calculate the profit from selling all the begs as follows: Profit = Selling price - Cost of transportation = $ 30 x number of begs - $ 20 = $ 30 x 10 begs - $ 20 = $ 500. Therefore, the peniaga has sold 10 begs in total and made a profit of $ 500.
Response:  The total cost of three tickets to the exhibition is $20.25 x 3 = $60.75. Since they spent more than just the ticket price for food, let's assume that the amount they spent on food was $4.50 + $4.50 + $4.50 = $13.50. So their total expenses were $60.75 + $13.50 = $74.25. If they want to split this equally among themselves, each person will pay $74.25 / 3 = $24.75.
Response:  If John gathers persimmons for 3 hours, he can gather 2 persimmons in one minute. So, if he gathered persimmons for 3 hours, then he gathered 60 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Therefore, John gathered 120 persimmons ( since there are 2 persimmons per minute) altogether.
Response:  If bebek needs to eat 3.5 ants per week to survive, and there are ten friends, then they need to eat 35 ants per day (3.5 x 10 = 35). So, each friend needs to eat 3.5 ants per hour (35 / 10 = 3.5) to maintain their weight.
"Response: 
Tom planted 10 trees per year for 10 years. He also cut down 2 trees per year. So in total, he had 50 trees at first. After 10 years, 30% of the trees died, which is 15 trees. Therefore, Tom has 35 trees left."

E) 60"
Response:  If Violetta needs to buy five new pens and each pen costs $2, then she will need to spend $10 for the pens ($2 x 5 = $10). So, there is a change of $10 from what she originally had ($20 - $10 = $10).
Response:  The total cost of 8 pens is equal to the sum of the cost of each pen multiplied by 8. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Cost = (Cost per pen) x Number of pens. In this case, the cost per pen is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of 8 pens is $1.50 x 8 = $12.00.
Response:  If there are 200 packets of potatoes (wortel) to be distributed among 40 restaurants, then each restaurant will receive an average of 5 packets per restaurant (200/40 = 5). Now, if each packet contains 2 pounds (paun) of potatoes, then the total amount of potatoes that each restaurant will receive is 10 pounds (5 x 2 = 10). Therefore, 90 pounds (10 - 10 = 90) of potatoes will not be used or wasted.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 23786 people in Soda, including 8417 males and 9092 females. Therefore, the total number of children (i.e., those under 18 years old) is equal to the total population minus the number of adults (males + females). So we can write: Number of children = Total population - (Number of males + Number of females) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092) Number of children = 23786 - 17509 Number of children = 6277 Children, therefore, live in Soda.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine collected 20 cards. Then she collected three times that amount in the second month, so she had 60 cards (20 x 3 = 60). In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as she had in the previous two months combined, which is 120 cards (60 + 60 = 120). Therefore, Elaine currently has 120 cards.
"Response: 
Mark edits 1000 ayats per week for two publishers with different pay rates. Publisher A pays $0.05 per ayat, and Publisher B pays twice as much, or $0.10 per ayat. So, Mark earns a total of:
$0.05 x 1000 = $50 from Publisher A
$0.10 x 1000 = $100 from Publisher B
Therefore, Mark makes a total of $150 per week."
Response:  If Baldur gets 5 baldi of water each morning and 6 baldi of water each evening, then he gets a total of 5 + 6 = 11 baldi of water per day. Since each baldi contains 5 liters of water, then Baldur can get a total of 11 x 5 = 55 liters of water per day. Therefore, the correct answer is 55 liters.
Response:  If John wins the award and gets a bonus of $5000, his total income for that year will be $20,000 (2000 x $10). Since he gets a 5% raise, his new salary will be $21,000 ($20,000 x 1.05). So, if he makes $2000 per week throughout the year, his total income for that year will be $104,000 ($21,000 x 52 weeks).
"Response: 
Josie has 10 ekar of land and each ekar produces 5 tans of grapes per year. Therefore, the total number of tans of grapes produced by Josie's land is:
10 ekar x 5 tans/ekar = 50 tans of grapes per year.
Now, each tan of grapes produces 2 tong wains. So, the total number of tong wains produced by Josie's land is:
50 tans of grapes x 2 tong wains/tan = 100 tong wains per year."
"Response: 
Day 1 (lunch):
Carl eats two slices of cheese for his lunchtime sandwiches, so he uses 4 slices of cheese.
Day 2 (breakfast and lunch):
For breakfast, Carl has three eggs, which requires one more slice of cheese than the previous day, so he uses 5 slices of cheese. For lunch, he eats another two slices of cheese for his sandwiches, so he uses 7 slices of cheese.
Day 3 (brunch and dinner):
For brunch, Carl has two eggs again, which requires one more slice of cheese than the previous day, so he uses 6 slices of cheese. For dinner, he makes pasta with eight slices of cheese, so he uses 8 slices of cheese.
Total number of slices of cheese used = 4 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 30 slices of cheese."
"Response: 
Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens initially. So, she has a total of 32 pens (22 + 10).
Then, she bought 6 blue pens and 2 red pens. Since there are 9 pens in each blue pack and 6 pens in each red pack, Janet now has 54 additional pens (9 x 6 = 54).
Therefore, the total number of pens that Janet has now is 32 + 54 = 86 pens."
Response:  If Brinley got scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in the first five tests, then his average score is (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 455 / 5 = 91. So, to get an overall score of 93, he needs to get at least 91 in the sixth test.
"Response: 
Michael rode his bicycle for four weeks and covered a total distance of 100 kilometers per week. Therefore, he covered a total distance of 400 kilometers in four weeks (100 km/week x 4 weeks).
Then, he reduced his riding frequency to twice a week and increased the distance he covered each time to 60 kilometers. So, he covered a total distance of 1200 kilometers in three weeks (60 km/week x 3 weeks).
Therefore, Michael has covered a total distance of 1600 kilometers (400 km + 1200 km) during the five weeks he was riding his bicycle."
Response:  We know that there are 25 bars of chocolate and 80 marshmallows in total. Each bar of chocolate weighs twice as much as each marshmallow. So, if each bar of chocolate weighs 40 grams, then each marshmallow must weigh 20 grams. Therefore, Joe has 80 x 2 = 160 grams of marshmallows.
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Rose bought 4 packs of chicken nuggets. Then on Tuesday (Selasa), she went to another store and bought 3 times the amount of chicken nuggets she bought on Monday, so she bought 12 packs of chicken nuggets. Finally, on Wednesday (Rabu), she went to yet another store and bought 5 times the amount of chicken nuggets she bought on Tuesday, so she bought 60 packs of chicken nuggets after three days. Therefore, the total number of packs of chicken nuggets Rose bought after three days is 60 + 12 = 72 packs.
Response:  We have to calculate how many cups can be bought with $ 1200 less than half of the total cost of all pots sold for $ 6000 each. So we need to find out how much money is left after subtracting $ 1200 from $ 6000. To do this, we divide $ 6000 by 2 and then subtract $ 1200: $$ \frac {6000}{2} - 1200 = 3600 $$ Therefore, you can buy 3600 cups with $ 1200 less than half of the total cost of all pots.
Response:  Firstly, Sara has $10 before she starts taking care of her siblings. After that, she earns $5 for each time she takes care of them, and spends $30 for the new jacket and $20 for each pair of socks. Therefore, Sara needs to work (take care of her siblings) x times before she can afford the jacket and socks. Since she gets paid $5 per time she takes care of her siblings, she will need to work: $10 / $5 = 2 times before she can afford the jacket and socks. So, Sara must work twice before she can buy the jacket and socks.
Response:  If Jerry has two white chickens more than red chickens, then the number of red chickens is equal to half the total number of chickens he owns minus the number of white chickens he owns. So, if Jerry has 2 white chickens more than red chickens, that means the number of red chickens is half (2/3) of the total number of chickens he owns minus the number of white chickens he owns. Therefore, the number of red chickens = (3 x 2)/3 - 2 = 6. So, there are 6 red chickens in Jerry's farm.
Response:  If Gary walks for 3 hours at a speed of 1.5 batu per hour, he will have walked 4.5 batu (3 x 1.5 = 4.5). Since there are 6 batu in total, Gary has walked half of them, which is 3 batu. Therefore, Gary has spent 3 hours walking.
Response:  On day one (hari pertama), Sloane estimated that there were 100 customers in the store. On day two (hari kedua), he estimated that there were 50 more customers than the previous day, so the total number of customers was 150. On day three (hari ketiga), if the total number of customers was 500, then the difference between the number of customers on days two and three is 350. Therefore, the number of customers on day three was 350 + 100 = 450.
Response:  At first, both pools had an equal amount of water (4 gallons/minute). Then, the big pool lost twice as much water as the small pool (8 gallons/minute), so the small pool now has half as much water as the big pool (2 gallons). Now, the big pool loses another 4 gallons per minute, bringing its total loss to 12 gallons (twice the small pool's loss). Therefore, the small pool currently has 3 gallons of water left (half of what it originally had minus the big pool's losses).
Response:  The total cost of the shoes and belt is $320 + $32 = $352. Since she works half time, she needs to work for $\frac{352}{8} = \boxed{44}$ hours before she can afford to buy them.
Response:  If Janet lends $2000 and promises to return it with an additional 10% of its amount, then we can calculate the total amount that she will pay as follows: Total Amount = Original Amount + Interest = $2000 + (10% x $2000) = $2300 So, if Janet pays $165 per month for 12 months, her total payment would be: Total Payment = Number of Monthly Payments x Monthly Payment = 12 x $165 = $2040 Therefore, the amount of money that Janet has left after returning the loan is: Leftover Money = Total Payment - Original Amount = $2040 - $2000 = $40 Janet has $40 leftover after returning the loan.
Response:  We know that there are four marigolds in the potpourri and seven dahlias more than marigolds in the potpourri. So, if we call the number of marigolds x, then the number of dahlias is x + 7. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the potpourri is x + (x + 7) = 2x + 7.
"Response: 
Harriet is currently 21 years old, so she was born when Zack was half her age (Zack = 21/2 = 10.5 years old).
Then, three years ago, Harriet was 18 years old, and Zack was 39 years old (Zack = 10.5 + 3 = 43.5 years old).
So, the ratio of Harriet's current age to Zack's current age is 43.5 : 21 = 2.06."
Response:  We know that Naomi got 68 mata and Yuri got 10 more than Naomi, so Yuri got 78 mata. Brianna got 17 more than Naomi, which means she got 95 mata (since Naomi got 68). Now we have to find out how many mata Jojo got. According to the question, Jojo got 251 - 68 = 183 mata more than Naomi. So Jojo got 183 + 68 = 251 mata in total.
"Response:

Masa yang dibutuhkan untuk menyelesaikan teka-teki sudoku = 5 minutes (as stated in the question)
Total time spent playing the game = Time taken to solve puzzles + Time taken to play Sudoku
= 10 minutes + 5 minutes
= 15 minutes
Therefore, the person spent 15 minutes playing the game."
Response:  We know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. This means that there are now 30 litres less water in the tank than before (since 90 litres were removed). So, if we assume that the original amount of water in the tank was 120 litres, then the current amount of water in the tank is 90 litres minus 30 litres = 60 litres. Therefore, there are currently 60 litres of water left in the tank.
Response:  We know that Andy has planted 90 geraniums and 40 petunias. The total number of flowers he has planted is 90 + 40 = 130. So, the answer is 130.
"Response:  The company spends $15,000 for advertising in one year and then spends one-third of that amount for advertising in the next year. So, if we let x be the total amount spent on advertising during the two years, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question as follows:
x = 15,000 + (1/3)x
Now, we are asked to find the value of x. To do this, we can solve the equation above for x. We get:
x = 15,000 + (1/3)x
Substituting the expression for x from the previous line into the first equation, we get:
15,000 + (1/3)(15,000 + (1/3)x)
Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
15,000 + (1/3)x = 22,500
Solving for x, we get:
x = 45,000
Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising by the company over the two years is $45,000."
Response:  If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and pays $30 per hour, he will pay $90 ($30 x 3). Similarly, if Benji uses the raft for 5 hours and pays $18 per hour, he will pay $90 ($18 x 5). Therefore, in total, they will pay $180 ($90 + $90).
"Response:  If it takes 6 hours to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half a day (3 hours) to return by bus, then the total time taken for both trips is:

6 hours + (3/2) = 9 hours

So, if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and back by train, he will take approximately 9 hours in total."
Response:  If James has 30 types of fire, and he loses 8 types of water, then he has 30 - 8 = 22 types of fire left. If he buys 14 types of grass, then he has 22 + 14 = 36 types of fire left. Since there are only 40 types of water in total, if he has 36 types of fire left after losing 8 types of water and buying 14 types of grass, then the probability that the selected card will be an air is 36/40 or approximately 0.9.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Chad spent for his original burrito and additional items he added:
$6.50 (burrito) + $2.00 (daging tambahan) + $1.00 (keju tambahan) + $1.00 (alpukat) + $0.25 x 2 (sos) = $9.75
Next, let's add the amount of money Chad paid for the drink and tip:
$9.75 + $3.00 (cips & minuman) = $12.75
Finally, let's subtract the amount of money Chad received as change:
$12.75 - $5.00 (hadiah) = $7.75
Therefore, Chad still owes $7.75."
"Response:  Kalinda can add 4 pieces every minute, and her mother can place half of a piece every minute as well. To find out how many minutes it will take them to solve the puzzle, we need to calculate the number of pieces they have added or placed so far.

Kalinda has been working for x minutes, and she has added 4 pieces every minute, so she has added a total of 4x pieces. Her mother has also been working for x minutes, and she has placed half of a piece every minute, so she has placed a total of x/2 pieces.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can set up the equation:

4x + (x/2) = 360

Solving for x, we get:

4x = 360 - (x/2)

4x = 360 - x

x = 180

So, Kalinda and her mother will take 180 minutes to solve the puzzle."
"Response: 
Ashlyn visited the orchard two months after the melons were planted and found that 30% of them had ripened. So she took 30% of 120 melons, which is 36 melons.
When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons had ripened, which means she harvested another 30% of the remaining melons, or 21 melons.
So, in total, Ashlyn harvested 57 melons (36 + 21).
Therefore, there are still 63 melons left to be ripe (120 - 57 = 63)."
"Response:  The total number of cars that Mark wants to buy is 12. Each car costs $20,000, so the total cost of all the cars is:

$20,000 x 12 = $240,000

Now, there is a 10% tax on each car, which means that for each car, Mark will pay an additional amount equal to 10% of its value. So, the total amount paid for each car is:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

So, the total amount paid for all 12 cars is:

$240,000 + ($24,000 x 12) = $368,000

Therefore, Mark pays a total of $368,000 for all 12 cars."
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she collected 7 shells (5 + 2 = 7). On Tuesday (Selasa), Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collected 14 shells (7 x 2 = 14). Therefore, Kylie collected a total of 14 + 7 = 21 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there are 50 semut in the garden and each semut has 2 friends (as stated in the passage), then there will be 100 serangga (semut + their friends) in the garden. So, the answer is 100.
Response:  We know that 36 penguins are sleeping on the ice. One-third of them (12) jump and swim in the ocean. Another one-third of them (12) enter caves to spend the night. So, there are 12 penguins left who are still sleeping on the ice. Therefore, the correct answer is 12.
Response:  If Steve eats twice as much tomatoes than his wife and he eats for 6 days, then he needs to eat 2 x 6 = 12 tomatoes per day. Now, if one tomato plant can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then how many tomato plants does Steve need to grow to meet his daily demand of 12 tomatoes? So, the answer is 12 / 3 = 4 tomato plants.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend wants to have 4 slices of pizza. Since the pizza is sold in 8 parts, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many whole pizzas John needs to buy:

20 / 8 = 5
So John needs to buy 5 whole pizzas."
Response:  If he uses 5 pens to make one full pen, then he will use 25/5 = 5 pens to make 5 full pens. So, after using all 25 pens, he will have 5 - 0 = 5 full pens left.
Response:  If Johnny initially has $20 and adds $10 more, he will have $30 in total. Then, if he invests this amount three times within a year, he will have $90 after one year ($30 x 3 = $90). Therefore, the amount of money that Johnny has after one year is $90.
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years older than Joan and five years older than Jessa. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Mary = Joan + 2
Joan = Jessa - 5
Jessa = 20
Now, let's solve for each variable in turn:
Substituting Mary = Joan + 2 into the first equation, we get:
Mary = Joan + 2
Joan = Jessa - 5
Substituting the second equation into the third one gives:
Jessa = 20
So, Jessa is 20 years old. Now, let's find out how old the other two girls are:
Using the first equation again, we have:
Mary = Joan + 2
Mary = 18 + 2
Mary = 20
And so, Mary is also 20 years old. Finally, using the second equation, we can calculate Joan's age:
Joan = Jessa - 5
Joan = 20 - 5
Joan = 15
Therefore, the three girls are aged 15 (Joan), 20 (Jessa), and 20 (Mary)."
Response:  If 30% of students leave after the assembly, then there are 700 students left in the building (1000 - 30%). Now, we need to find out how many students leave through each exit. We know that 3/5 of the remaining students leave through exit B and the rest through exit C. So, the number of students who leave through exit C is equal to 700 x (4/5). Therefore, the answer is 700 x (4/5) = 560 students.
Response:  We know that James has 6 more sugar than Robert. So, if Robert has x sugars, then James has x + 6 = x + 6 sugars. Now we are given that John has twice as many sweets as Robert, so John has 2x sugars. Finally, we are told that John has 54 sugars in total. Therefore, the number of sugars that John has is equal to the number of sugars that he has minus the number of sugars that James has, which is 54 - (x + 6). Simplifying this equation, we get x = 38. So, John has 38 sugars for every 6 sugars that James has.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they will have three books to read. So, at the end of the process, they will have read a total of 3 + 1 = 4 books.
"Response: 
Mike has 5 pen pals and he stops being pen pals with 2 of them. So, there are 3 remaining pen pals.
Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week, which means Mike receives 6 letters per week (3 pen pals x 2 letters/week).
To write one letter takes him 6 minutes, so Mike spends 6 minutes/letter x 6 letters/week = 36 minutes/week writing letters to his pen pals."
"Response: 
Jason has 1000 minutes per month, which is equivalent to 16.67 hours (since there are 24 hours in a day).
He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, so that's 15 x 30 = 450 minutes per month.
He talks to other people for an additional 300 minutes this month, bringing the total number of minutes he uses to 890 minutes (450 + 440).
Since there are 30 days in the month, we can divide the total number of minutes by 30 to find out how many minutes Jason uses per day: 890 / 30 = 29.67 minutes per day."
"Response: 
Griffin made 24 fried potatoes and Kyle ate 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 10 fried potatoes (since 2 x 5 = 10).
Ginger gave Griffin some of his fried potatoes, but we don't know how many. So let's assume that Ginger gave Griffin x fried potatoes.
Colby then took 3 fewer than the number of fried potatoes that Kyle had eaten, which means he took 7 fried potatoes (since 3 < 5).
So at the end of the day, Griffin has 27 fried potatoes in total. To find out how many fried potatoes Ginger gave him, we can subtract the number of fried potatoes that Kyle ate from the total number of fried potatoes that Griffin has: 27 - 5 = 22. Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 22 fried potatoes."
Response:  In the first aquarium, there are 4 fish. In the second aquarium, there are 32 fish. To find out how many fish each aquarium has, we need to divide the total number of fish (4 + 32 = 36) by the number of aquariums (2). So, each aquarium has 18 fish.
"Response: 
Jeans is an makeup artist who charges $250 for her services. She needs to spend a lot of money on materials for the film she is working on and it takes her 6 hours each day to complete the work, which means she works 4 times a week. The film takes 5 weeks to finish. After the film is finished, the actress gives Jean a discount of 10% because of the amount of work done. So, how much does Jean pay?
Let's break down the calculation:
Total time spent on the project = 6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = 800 hours
Total cost of materials = $250 x 800 hours = $200,000
Discount given by the actress = 10% of $200,000 = $20,000
So, Jean pays $180,000 ($200,000 - $20,000) for the project."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Isabella spent in total for her party. We know that she spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on gifts for her brother's birthday, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on party supplies for the guests. Therefore, the total amount of money Isabella spent is:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Now, let's divide this amount equally among three parts: two mothers and one daughter (Isabella). So, each mother will get:

$96 / 3 = $32

Therefore, each mother will pay $32 for the party."
Response:  The number of beg bawang that the cook buys is 4. Each beg bawang weighs 50 paun, so the total weight of all beg bawang is 4 x 50 = 200 paun. Since each bawang costs $1.50, the total cost of all beg bawang is 200 x $1.50 = $300. Therefore, the chef spends $300 to buy 4 beg bawang.
"Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Sue eats 4 times more biscuits than her brother. So if her brother eats x biscuits, Sue eats 4x biscuits. On Tuesday (Selasa), Sue eats twice as many biscuits as her brother. If her brother eats x biscuits, then Sue eats 2x biscuits. The total number of biscuits that Sue eats in one day is equal to the sum of the number of biscuits she eats on each of the next 13 days. Therefore, the total number of biscuits that Sue eats is: 

$$ \text {Total number of biscuits} = \text {Number of biscuits on Monday} + \text{ Number of biscuits on Tuesday} + \text{ Number of biscuits on Wednesday} +... + \text{ Number of biscuits on the 13th day} $$

We know that on Monday, Sue eats 4 times more biscuits than her brother, so the number of biscuits that Sue eats on Monday is 4 times the number of biscuits that her brother eats. We also know that on Tuesday, Sue eats twice as many biscuits as her brother. So, the number of biscuits that Sue eats on Tuesday is twice the number of biscuits that her brother eats. Therefore, we can write:

$$ \text {Total number of biscuits} = 4\times \text {number of biscuits on Monday} + 2\times \text {number of biscuits on Tuesday} + \text {number of biscuits on Wednesday} +... + \text {number of biscuits on the 13th day} $$

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:

$$ \text {Total number of biscuits} = 4\times 4x + 2\times 2x + x +... + x $$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$ \text {Total number of biscuits} = 8x + 6x = 14x $$

Therefore, the total number"
