"Response: 
Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes three for breakfast every morning and makes muffins for her friends four times a day. So, she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left to sell at the farmer's market each day.
Now, let's calculate how much money Janet earns from selling those eggs:
She sells each egg for $2, so she earns $2 x 13 = $26 daily from selling eggs at the farmer's market. Therefore, the correct answer is:
Janet earns $26 daily from selling eggs at the farmer's market."
Response:  We need to find out how much of each color is required for the manta and then calculate the number of spools needed.  The ratio of blue to white fiber is given as 1:2, which means that for every 2 parts of white fiber, we need 1 part of blue fiber. So, if we want to make a manta with 2 spools of blue fiber and half of it is white fiber, we can calculate it as follows:  Number of spools of blue fiber = Total amount of blue fiber / Amount of blue fiber per spool = (Half of white fiber + White fiber) / 2 = (Half of 50 + 50) / 2 = 37.5 / 2 = 18.75 spools  Therefore, we need 19 spools of fiber to make the manta.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on repairs. This means he invested a total of $130,000 in the house ($80,000 + $50,000).
Response:  Firstly, we know that James decides to run three sprints per week. So, he runs 3 x 3 = 9 sprints in total per week. Now, each sprint is 60 meters long, so the total distance James covers in one week is 9 x 60 = 540 meters. Therefore, James runs 540 meters per week.
Response:  We know that every day, Wendy feeds each of her chickens with three bowls of food for chickens mixed, containing seeds, worms, and vegetables to help keep them healthy. She gives the chickens their food in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives the flock of chickens 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she gives the chickens more food, specifically 25 bowls. If Wendy's flock of chickens has 20 chickens, how many bowls of food does she need to give them at the last meal of the day?  Solution: To find out how many bowls of food Wendy needs to give the chickens at the last meal of the day, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Wendy gives the chickens 3 bowls of food per meal, so she gives a total of 3 x 3 = 9 bowls of food per day. Since there are 20 chickens in Wendy’s flock, she needs to give them 9 bowls of food per day x 20 chickens = 180 bowls of food per day. Therefore, Wendy needs to give the chickens 180 bowls of food at the last meal of the day.
Response:  If one cup costs $5, then each subsequent cup will cost $\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$ dollars. So, if Kylar wants to buy 16 cups, he will need to pay $\text {16} \times 2.5 = 40$ dollars.
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times more sheep than Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Toulouse has 2 x 4 = 8 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 8 + 4 x 20 = 160 sheep.
Response: 1. Before the forced restart, Carla had downloaded 40% of the file, which is equal to 80 GB (since 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB). 2. After the forced restart, Carla has to start downloading from the beginning, so she needs to download an additional 160 GB (the remaining 70% of the file). 3. Therefore, the total time needed to download the file after the forced restart is: 80 GB + 160 GB = 240 GB / 2 GB/minute = 120 minutes or 2 hours and 40 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 100 km/h before he turned back home because he forgot something important. So in this 3-hour period, he covered a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/h x 3 hours = 300 km.  Now, after turning back home, he spent the next 2 hours stuck in traffic, which means he didn't cover any additional distance during this time. Therefore, his total distance traveled so far is still 300 km.  Next, he drives at a speed of 30 mph (which is equivalent to 48 km/h) for the next me...
Response:  Firstly, we know that Eliza works for $10 per hour in her first 40 hours of work. So, she earned $400 (10$/hour x 40 hours) during this period.  Then, she receives an extra payment of $1.2 times her regular hourly wage for each hour worked beyond 40 hours. Therefore, she earned an additional amount of $48 ($1.2 \* 40 hours) for working 10 extra hours. Thus, Eliza's total earnings for this week are $448 ($400 + $48).
Response:  In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.  In the second month, the number of downloads was three times that of the first month, so in the second month, the program had 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.  Then, in the third month, there was a 30% decrease, so the program had 180 - (30/100) = 126 downloads.  Therefore, the program had a total of 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads over the three months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toula bought 3 dúzias of donuts, which means she spent US $ 68 x 3 = US $ 194 on donuts. Secondly, she bought 2 dúzias of mini cupcakes, which means she spent US $ 80 x 2 = US $ 160 on mini cupcakes. Finally, she bought 6 dúzias of mini cheesecakes, which means she spent US $ 55 x 6 = US $ 330 on mini cheesecakes. Therefore, the total cost is US $ 194 + US $ 160 + US $ 330 = US $ 684.
Response:  First year:  No income from lemons since it takes time for the tree to grow and produce fruit. Expenses: $3 (regarding) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $93.  Second year: Income from selling lemons: $7 x 2 = $14. Expenses: $3 (regardings) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $103. Third year: Income from selling lemons: $7 x 3 = $21. Expenses: $3 (regards) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $113. Fourth year: Income from selling lemons: $7 x 4 = $28. Expenses: $3 (regards) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $113. Fifth year: Income from selling lemons: $7 x 5 = $35. Expenses: $3 (regards) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $123. Sixth year: Income from selling lemons: $7 x 6 = $42. Expenses: $3 (regards) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $133. Seventh year: Income from selling lemons: $7 x 7 = $49. Expenses: $3 (regards) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $133. Eighth year: Income from selling lemons: $7 x 8 = $56. Expenses: $3 (regards) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $143. Ninth year: Income from selling lemons: $7 x 9 = $63. Expenses: $3 (regards) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $153. Tenth year: Income from selling lemons: $7 x 10 = $70. Expenses: $3 (regards) + $90 (tree cost). Total = $163. Ele will start making money with the lemon in the tenth year.
"Response:  We know that Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners at Green House, two to Red House, and half of what was left at Orange House. So, if she had 5 vacuum cleaners initially, we can calculate it as follows:

1/3 x Initial number = Number sold at Green House
2 x Number sold at Red House = Number sold at Red House
Half of remaining = Number sold at Orange House

Now, let's substitute these values into the equation:

Number sold at Green House = 5 / 3 = 1.67 (since 1/3 is equal to 1.67)
Number sold at Red House = 2
Number sold at Orange House = 5 - (1.67 x 2) = 5 - 3.34 = 1.66

So, Melanie had 5 aspirators initially."
Response:  We know that out of 20 students, 20% (or 4) enrolled in contemporary dance and 25% (or 5) of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. This means that 9 students (4 + 5 = 9) did not enroll in either contemporary or jazz dance. Therefore, the percentage of all students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 9/20 x 100 = 45%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the expected value of each market at the end of the month based on their historical growth rates:  Expected value of jewelry market = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125 Expected value of electronics market = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,160 Now, let's compare these values and choose the option that has the higher expected value:  Highest expected value = $5,125 (jewelry market) or $8,160 (electronics market) = $8,160 Therefore, if the merchant wants to maximize profits at the end of this month, they should invest in electronics.
Response:  Day 1: Both trains travel west for 80 miles (130 km). So, each train has traveled 80/2 = 40 miles (64 km) in total.  Day 2: One train travels north for 240 kilometers and then returns to its original path. The other train continues traveling west for another 80 miles (130 km), so it has covered an additional distance of 80 - 40 = 40 miles (64 km). Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains combined is: 40 + 40 = 80 miles (130 km).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jill earns as a teacher per week. As she works 35 hours/week as a professor, her weekly income is $35 x 4 = $140 per week. Now, let's calculate how much Jill earns as a cheerleading coach per week. Since she works 15 hours/week as a cheerleading coach, her weekly income is $15 x 4 = $60 per week. Finally, let's add up Jill's total weekly income from both jobs to find out her annual income. So, her annual income is $140 + $60 = $200 per week. Therefore, her annual salary is $200 x 50 weeks = $10,000 per year.
Response:  If Claire makes an omelette of three eggs every morning for breakfast, and she does this for 4 weeks (or 28 days), then she will have made a total of 3 x 28 = 84 omelettes in that time period. So, she will have consumed 84 dúzias of eggs (1 dúzia = 10 eggs).
Response:  We know that Marissa has already walked for 4 kilometers in one hour, so her speed at this point is 4/1 = 4 miles per hour. Then she walks for another two kilometers in one hour, which means her speed during this time is 2/1 = 2 miles per hour. To find her average speed over the entire distance of 12 miles, we need to add these two speeds together and divide by the total time it took her to walk those distances:  So, Marissa's average speed over the remaining distance of 10 kilometers (or 12 miles) is (4 + 2)/(3 + 1) = 5 miles per hour.
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange drink that is two thirds water (i.e., 6/7 = 85% water). When we add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three fifths water (i.e., 3/5 = 60% water), we get a total volume of 23 liters (10 + 15 x 60%). Now, when we spill one liter of the orange drink during the pouring process, the remaining amount in the container will be 22 liters (23 - 1 = 22). Therefore, there are 22 liters of liquid left after spilling one liter of the orange drink.
Response:  We know that Raymonde was born six years before Samantha, so he is now 36 years old (Samantha - 6 = Raymonde). Then, when Raymonde had his son at age 23, Samantha was born. So, the difference between their ages is 36 - 23 = 13 years. Therefore, Samantha is currently 45 years old (36 + 13 = 45).
Response:  The first three customers buy one DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total. Then, the next four customers buy two DVDs each, so they bought 8 DVDs (4 x 2 = 8). In total, Billy sold 3 + 8 = 11 DVDs on that day.
Response:  At 13:00, the wick will have burned for 4 hours (from 9:00 to 13:00). So, its length will be reduced by 4 cm = 2 cm/hour x 4 hours. Now, from 13:00 to 17:00, the wick will burn for another 4 hours. Therefore, its length will be further reduced by an additional 4 cm = 2 cm/hour x 4 hours. Thus, after burning from 13:00 to 17:00, the wick will have a total length reduction of 8 cm = 4 cm + 4 cm.
Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book after a discount of 25%. So we can write an equation as follows:  Book price = Original price - Discount  Substituting the given values in the equation above, we get:  Book price = $19.50 = $Original price - $Discount  Now, we are asked to find the value of the original price. To do this, we need to isolate the variable 'original price'.  We can do this by subtracting the discount from both sides of the equation:  $Original price - $Discount = $19.50  Now, we have:  $Original price = $19.50 / ($Discount)  Since the discount is 25%, we can simplify the fraction as follows:  $Original price = $19.50 / (25%)  Now, we multiply both sides of the equation by $100 to convert it into dollars:  $Original price = $19.50 x $100 = $1,950  Therefore, the original price of the book was $1,950.
Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for her meal. From this information, we can calculate the cost of the chicken dish as follows:  Cost of chicken = Price of chicken dish x Number of packages of chicken = $12.50 x 5 = $62.50  Similarly, we can calculate the cost of the milk as follows: Cost of milk = Price of milk per package x Number of packages of milk = $3 x 5 = $15 So, in total, Marie paid $62.50 + $15 = $77.50 for her meal. Now, let's find out how many pizzas Marie ordered based on the amount she paid: Number of pizzas = Total amount paid / Price of one pizza = $77.50 / $8.50 = 9 Therefore, Marie ordered 9 boxes of pizza.
Response:  The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50, so the total cost of three pairs of shorts is $16.50 x 3 = $49.50. Similarly, the cost of one pair of pants is $22.50, so the total cost of three pairs of pants is $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. Finally, the cost of one pair of shoes is $42, so the total cost of three pairs of shoes is $42 x 3 = $126. Therefore, in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $233 on all the clothing items.
Response:  After 60 days of buying ice cream every night, Cynthia will have bought a total of 60 x 7 = 420 portions of ice cream (since there are 7 nights in a week). Since each portion costs R$ 4.00, the total cost of all the ice cream she has bought is:  Total Cost = Number of Portions x Price per Portion = 420 x R$ 4.00 = R$ 1,680.00. Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent R$ 1,680.00 on ice cream.
Response:  After he stopped for the first time, he had traveled 40 miles (20 + 20). Then, he rode another 30 miles before stopping again (15 + 30 = 45). So, in total, he rode 40 + 45 = 85 miles.
Response:  If Gloria is buying shoes and finds a pair of boots that fit her budget, then she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that cost $5 less together than the boots. So, if one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?  Therefore, the answer is $66.
Response:  The ratio of Darrell to Allen is 7:11, so their combined age is 7x + 11 = 162. If we want to find Allen's age after 10 years, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 7x + 11 - 10 =...
Response:  Firstly, we have Gunter who is trying to count the jellies in a jar. He asks his friends for their estimates and one of them says there are 80 jellies in the jar. Another friend says that there are 20 more jellies than half of the first estimate, which means they think there are 160 jellies (half of 80). Finally, a third friend says that there are 25% more jellies than the first estimate, which means they think there are 100 jellies (25% more than 80). So, our estimated average is (80 + 160 + 100) / 3 = 340 jellies.
"Response:  If John has 10 dogs and each dog takes 0.5 hours per day to walk and take care of its business, then in one week (7 days), John will spend:

Days per week = 7
Hours per day = 0.5 hours/dog x 10 dogs = 5 hours/day
Total hours per week = 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week
Therefore, John spends approximately 35 hours per week taking care of his 10 dogs."
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we have x silver coins, then we have 3x gold coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins is equal to 30/5 = 6. So, Gretchen has 6 gold coins.
"Response:  We know that Aaron has two more jewels than Siobhan and five more jewels than half of Raymon's jewels. So if we can find out how many jewels Raymon has, we will be able to determine how many jewels Siobhan has.  Now let's analyze the information given in the question:  • ""Aaron has two more jewels than Siobhan"" means that if Siobhan has x jewels, then Aaron has x + 2 jewels.  • ""Aaron has five more jewels than half of Raymon's jewels"" means that if Raymon has y jewels, then Aaron has y + 5 jewels.  Based on these statements, we can write an equation:  Siobhan has x jewels (given).  Aaron has x + 2 jewels (given).  Half of Raymon's jewels is y jewels (given).  Aaron has y + 5 jewels (given).  Substituting the values from the equations into each other, we get:  X = 40 (since Raymon has 40 jewels).  Y = 20 (half of 40 is 20).  Therefore, Siobhan has 20 jewels."
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he scored an average of 0.2 points per minute (4/20).  During the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the previous period, which means he scored 0.3 points per minute (25% of 0.2 = 0.06) more than before. Therefore, his total score during those 40 minutes is: $0.2 + 0.06 = 0.26$ points per minute x 40 minutes = $1.04$ points. So, Mike scored $1.04 \times 40 = 41.6$ points in total.
"Response:  If Terry buys two yogurt per day and currently costs $ 5 for 4 yogurts, then he spends:
$$ \therefore Total cost = Number of yogurts \times Price per yogurt $$
$$ \therefore Total cost = 2 \times 5 = 10 $ $
So, Terry spends $ 10 in yogurt during 30 days."
Response:  Firstly, we know that John sold all his toys and used the money to buy video games. So he has no more toys left. Then, we are told that he had 13 sets of Legos and sold them for $15 each, which means he made a total of $195 ($13 x $15). Now, we see that he spent $240 on video games (8 x $20), leaving him with a remaining amount of $45 ($240 - $195). Finally, since he has $5 left over after buying the video games, this means he still has at least one set of Legos left. Therefore, John still has 13 sets of Legos.
Response:  We know that John runs for 100 kilometers per week and he runs 3 days a week. He also tells us that he runs for 3 hours on the first day and half of the other two days. So, let's calculate his running speed as follows: Day 1: He runs for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 kilometers/day. Days 2-3: Since he only runs for half of these days, he covers a total distance of (1/2) x 60 = 30 kilometers/day. Therefore, John's average running speed is (180 + 30)/2 = 95 kilometers per hour.
Response:  If Dana can run at a speed of x miles per hour, then she can travel a distance of x \* 6 hours = 6x miles in six hours.  Similarly, if she can walk at a speed of y miles per hour, then she can travel a distance of y \* 6 hours = 6y miles in six hours.  Since Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, her running speed is 4x miles per hour, and her walking speed is y miles per hour.  We are given that Dana can jump to a speed of 5 miles per hour. So, we have two equations:  Running: 6x = 4(x) Walking: 6y = 2(y) Now, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations.  Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get: 4x = 2(x) Solving for x, we get: x = 8  Therefore, Dana can travel 8 miles in six hours if she runs, and 4 miles in six hours if she walks.
Response:  According to the question, the age of Ben's iPhone is twice that of Suzy's iPhone. So, if Suzy's iPhone has one year, then Ben's iPhone has two years. Now, according to the question, Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. Therefore, if Ben's iPhone has two years, then Brandon's iPhone must have eight years (4 x 2 = 8).
Response:  First, we know that when Polly holds the gemstone (pedra preciosa), she can throw the javelin three times farther than usual. So if she throws it from a distance of x meters without holding the stone, it will travel x/3 meters after being thrown.  Now, let's consider how far the dragon's flames reach. We are told that they extend to a distance of 300 meters. Therefore, if Polly is at a distance of x meters from the dragon and throws the javelin without holding the gemstone, it will be within the dragon's flame zone after traveling x/3 meters.  However, since Polly can use the gemstone to increase her throwing power, she can throw the javelin beyond the dragon's flame zone even though it was initially within it. So, the maximum distance that Polly could throw the javelin and still hit the dragon with the golden one would be equal to the initial distance plus the additional distance gained by using the gemstone.  To calculate this maximum distance, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 300 and 120, which is 60. Then, we multiply both numbers by 60 to get the maximum distance:  Distance = 300 x 60 + 120 x 60 = 18000 meters.  Therefore, Polly could potentially hit the dragon with the golden javelin if she threw it from a distance of up to 18000 meters away while holding the gemstone.
Response:  Avó Jones made 5 tortas of apple for the firefighter's lunch and cut each torta into 8 pieces. So, there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of torta in total. Then, after all the guests had taken their share, there were 40 - 14 = 26 remaining pieces of torta. Therefore, 26 pieces of torta were taken by the guests.
Response:  If one serving of potatoes contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a bag of 300g, then the total number of calories in that bag is:  Calories per serving x Number of servings = Total calories in the bag  Therefore, if you want to know how many grams of potatoes you can eat while staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories when you have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to calculate the remaining amount of calories available for consumption:  Remaining calories = Daily calorie goal - Already consumed calories  Now, let's plug in the values given in the question:  Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories  So, you can consume up to 200 grams of potatoes (based on 250 calories per serving) while still staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories after consuming 1800 calories.
Response:  Firstly, we know that for each kilogram of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 conical candles. So if he sells each candle for $2, then he will earn $2 x 10 = $20 per kilogram of wax sold. Now, we are given that one kilogram of beeswax and the meches cost $10 in supplies. Therefore, Charlie's total cost for making 20 candles would be $10 + $10 = $20. If he sells each candle for $2, his profit from selling 20 candles would be $20 - $20 = $0. Since he doesn't have any costs associated with selling the candles (no shipping or other expenses), his overall profit from this transaction would also be $0.
Response:  On Monday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday, so she spent $2 \times 4 = 8$ hours writing articles that day.  On Wednesday, she wrote half as many articles as she did on Monday, so she spent $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4$ hours writing articles that day. Therefore, in total, she spent $8 + 4 = 12$ hours writing articles over those three days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Candice had $80 notes in her purse before going to work. Then she stopped at the store and bought a package of Post-its containing $15 notas. After that, she placed one Post-it in each of the $220 coffee cups at work, leaving her with $23 remaining Post-its. Therefore, the number of notes in the package she bought is $15 + $23 = $38.
"Response:  We know that John buys twice as many red scarves as blue ones. So if he bought x blue scarves, he bought 2x red scarves. Since red scarves cost $70 each and blue scarves cost $40 each, we can write:

Total cost of blue scarves = x \* $40
Total cost of red scarves = 2x \* $70

We also know that John spent $200 on scarves in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Total cost of blue scarves + Total cost of red scarves = $200

Substituting the equations above, we get:

x \* $40 + (2x) \* $70 = $200

Simplifying and solving for x, we find that John bought 8 blue scarves ($40 per scarf x 8 scarves). Therefore, he bought 16 red scarves ($70 per scarf x 16 scarves):

Answer: $160"
Response:  We know that Tracy used a piece of string that is 1,20 m long to support the tomatoes in the garden. If we cut this string into pieces of 15 cm length, then... (1) The total number of pieces of string = Length of string / Length of each piece (1,20 m / 15 cm) = Number of pieces = 80 pieces. Therefore, Tracy obtained 80 pieces of string from the original piece of string she used.
Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in the building, each floor has 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows: Occupied units = Number of floors x Number of units per floor x Fraction of building occupied = 15 x 8 x 0.75 = 1125 units Now, we need to subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to get the number of unoccupied units: Unoccupied units = Total number of units - Occupied units = 15 x 8 x 1 = 1200 units Therefore, there are 1200 unoccupied units in the building.
Response:  If Lloyd has a quinta of eggs and his hens produce 252 eggs per day, then he will have 252 x 7 = 1809 eggs in one week (assuming a 7-day week). Since each egg costs $2, Lloyd will make $2 x 1809 = $3618 from selling all the eggs produced in one week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tom can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 5 hours (from 1 to 4 pm). So he has traveled a distance of 10 x 5 = 50 miles during this time. Then, from 4 pm to 6 pm, his speed is reduced to 6 miles per hour, so he covers a distance of 6 x 2 = 12 miles during this period. Therefore, in total, Tom has traveled a distance of 50 + 12 = 62 miles. To find out how long it takes him to return, we need to divide the total distance by his speed: 62 miles / 6 miles/hour = 10.33 hours. So, it will take Tom approximately 10 and a half hours to return.
Response:  If Uriah needs to take out 15 kilograms from his bag of books and each comic book weighs one kilogram, then he will need to remove 15 comics. Since each toy weighs one kilogram as well, if he removes 30 comics, he will need to remove 30 toys. Therefore, the answer is 30 toys.
Response:  On Friday (day with more revenue), the mechanic repaired 12 cars and did not repair any truck tires, so he earned $480 from car tire repairs ($40 per tire x 12 tires).  In total, the mechanic earned $540 in revenue on Friday ($480 + $60 per tire x 6 truck tires).  Therefore, the maximum amount of money the mechanic could have received on that day is $540.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Irmãs Doubtfire have 7 adopted kittens from the animal shelter. Then, their mother calls to tell them that their two domestic cats, Patchy and Trixie, have each had three times as many kittens as they originally had. So, if Patchy had 3 times 3 = 9 kittens, and Trixie had 12 kittens, then the total number of kittens for both cats is 9 + 12 = 21 kittens. Therefore, the family Doubtfire now has 7 + 21 = 28 kittens in total!
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 pirulitos in total and he wants to put two of them in a bag. So, we have 30 - 2 = 28 pirulitos left. To find out how many bags Jean can fill with these remaining pirulitos, we need to divide the number of pirulitos by 2 (since he wants to put two pirulitos in each bag). Therefore, the number of bags Jean can fill is 28 / 2 = 14 bags.
Response:  If Peter pays $7 for each ticket and popcorn, he will spend a total of $7 + $7 = $14 per trip to the movies. Since he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies $\frac{42}{14} = 3$ times. Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times that week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the weight of the bridge is limited to 5000 pounds (or 2268 kg). Then, we are given that the driver and the empty truck together weigh 1400 kilograms or 3086 pounds. Now, let's calculate how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the limit of the bridge: Total weight = Weight of the bridge + Weight of the driver + Weight of the load = 5000 lb + 1400 kg + x kg Where 'x' represents the number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck. Solving for 'x', we get: x = 5000 - (1400 + 5) = 3595 kg or approximately 7925 pounds Since each box weighs 5 kg, we can carry up to 3595 boxes (or 7925 pounds) without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. Therefore, the correct answer is 3595 boxes.
Response:  Firstly, Stephen paid $40 for his groceries online. Then, the delivery service added 25% to that amount, making it $50 (25% of $40). Next, they charged him an additional $3 in delivery fees, bringing the total cost to $53 ($50 + $3). Finally, Stephen also paid $4 for a gift wrap, so the final price he paid was $57 ($53 + $4). Therefore, the final price of Stephen's purchases was $57.
Response:  We know that there are 6 groups of 20 frutes each, so we have: 6 x 20 = 120 frutes in total. And then, we have 67 individual frutes scattered throughout the bush, so we add them to the previous count: 120 + 67 = 187 frutes in total. Therefore, there are 187 framboesas in this bush.
Response:  We know that 25 is the total number of oranges in the basket.  From this information, we can calculate the percentage of good oranges as follows:  Percentage of good oranges = (Number of good oranges / Total number of oranges) x 100  In this case, the number of good oranges is 24 (since 25 - 1 = 24 are good). So, the percentage of good oranges is:  Percentage of good oranges = (24 / 25) x 100  = 96%  Now, let's find out how many good oranges there are in total:  Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges x Percentage of good oranges  = 25 x 96%  = 24 Therefore, there are 24 good oranges in the basket.
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for the materials to make the brooch. Then, she paid $800 to have it made by the jeweler. Finally, she paid $100 (10%) as insurance. So, in total, she paid $680 ($500 + $800 + $100).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Marcy worked for the same company for 40 years and received an annual pension of $50,000. From year 20 onwards, she has the right to receive 5% of the value of her pension annually. So, after 30 years of service (i.e., from year 50 onwards), her annual pension will be:

Pension = $50,000 x (1 + 5%)^30 = $75,000 per year
Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after working for 30 years will be $75,000."
Response:  In the first semester of the year, she paid $140 for the service. Then in the second semester, she paid $126 (10% less than the initial amount). So, the total amount she paid for the service until the end of the year is: $140 + $126 = $266.
Response:  Since Sophia traveled 160 kilometers since she last filled up her tank and needed to add 4 gallons of gasoline to fill it again, we can calculate how far she could go with one tank as follows: Distance = Total distance traveled / Amount of fuel added = 160 km / 4 gal = 40 km So, Sophia could drive approximately 40 kilometers with just one tank of gasoline.
"Response: 
Jim spends two hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and read for half of that time. He does this three times a week. So in one week, he will spend $2 \times 3 = 6$ hours watching TV and reading. In four weeks, he will spend $\boxed{6 \times 4 = 24}$ hours watching TV and reading."
Response:  For girls' teams: * Number of schools = 4 * Number of players per team = 5 * Total number of players for girls' teams = 4 x 5 = 20 For boys' teams: * Number of schools = 4 * Number of players per team = 5 * Total number of players for boys' teams = 4 x 5 = 20 Add both numbers to get the total number of people sent by each school: 20 + 20 = 40 So, in total, 40 people were sent from all four schools.
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds in total and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, if we have x diamonds, then we have 35 less than x = 140 (rubies). Since we also have twice as many emeralds as rubies, we can say that there are 2x = 280 emeralds (emeralds). Therefore, the total number of stones in the chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = 695 stones.
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls and 5 boys in total. If we divide this number by 2 (since there are twice as many girls as boys), we get 30 girls per teacher. Since there are 4 teachers, we can conclude that there are 120 students in total (4 x 30 = 120).
Response:  Bailey started with some initial amount of money (call it x). Then she received $40 as an allowance for 8 weeks ($5/week \* 8 weeks = $40). After receiving this allowance, her total amount of money was $x + $40 = 100 dollars. So, Bailey started with $60 in money.
"Response: 
A) Daily classes:
Judy teaches dance for 5 days a week, so she has 5 x 7 = 35 students per week.
Since each student pays $15, Judy earns $35 x 35 = $1225 per week from daily classes.

B) Saturday classes:
Judy also teaches dance on Saturdays, and there are 8 classes in total. So, she has 8 x 1 = 8 students per Saturday.
Each student pays $15, so Judy earns $8 x $15 = $120 per Saturday.

C) Total income per week:
Adding up all the income from both daily and Saturday classes, we get: $1225 + $120 = $1345 per week."
"Response:  If Kelian has two recipes with 20 and double instructions each, then he will have:

For the first recipe: 20 instructions x 2 = 40 instructions to read.
For the second recipe: 20 instructions x 2 = 80 instructions to read.
Therefore, Kelian needs to read 40 + 80 = 120 instructions in total to prepare both dishes."
Response:  If Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 each, he will make $13 (43 x $3). Similarly, if he sells 23 cheesecakes at $4 each, he will make $98 ($23 x $4). Therefore, in total, Tommy will make $111 ($13 + $98).
"Response:  Firstly, Sheila bought five cellphones for $150 each, so she paid a total of $750. Then, there is a 2% interest charge per unit, which means that Sheila will pay $15 (2% x $75) per month for each cellphone. Therefore, her total monthly payment for three months will be $45 ($15 x 3). So, during the first month, Sheila will pay $45; in the second month, she will pay $60 ($45 + $15); and in the third month, she will pay $75 ($60 + $15)."
Response:  If we multiply each type of flower by its price per pot and then add them up, we get: Calendula x $2.74/pot = $32.80 Petunia x $1.87/pot = $16.53 Begonia x $2.12/pot = $34.34 Total = $83.67 So if Artie sells 12 pots of calendulas, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, he will make a total of $83.67.
"Response:  If each level of the sandcastle has half the area of the previous level, then the area of each level will decrease exponentially as we go upward. Specifically, if the area of the top level is A square meters, then the area of the next lower level (the one below it) will be $A/2$ square meters. Therefore, the area of each level will decrease by half every time we move down one level.
Now, let's find out what happens when we build a castle with 4 levels. Since you said that the top level has an area of 16 square meters, we can start there and work our way down. The area of the second level will be $A/2 = 8$ square meters, since it's half the size of the first level. Similarly, the area of the third level will be $A/4 = 4$ square meters, and the area of the fourth level will be $A/8 = 2$ square meters. So, in total, the four-level sandcastle will have an area of:
$$Area = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30$$square meters.
Therefore, the average area of each level of the sandcastle is:
$$\text{average area} = \frac{Total Area}{Number of Levels} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5$$square meters."
Response:  Firstly, we know that during the first 180 days (6 months), Cecilia has to give her puppy one bowl of dog food every day. Therefore, she will use 180 bowls of dog food in total during this period.  Next, after the initial 180-day period, Cecilia needs to provide two bowls of dog food to her puppy every day for the rest of its life. So, how many bowls of dog food does Cecilia need to use altogether? Well, if we divide the number of bowls she needs to use each day by the number of days she needs to use them, we get: Number of bowls used per day = 2 / Days used = Total number of bowls used = 2 x 365 = 730 bowls.  Therefore, Cecilia will use 730 bowls of dog food in total over the course of her puppy's lifetime.
Response:  We know that Sarah does 4 times more laundry than David. So if she does 400 kilograms of laundry, then David does 4 x 400 = 1600 kilograms of laundry. Now we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since he and Sarah do half as much laundry as each other, Raymond does (50% of 1600) = 800 kilograms of laundry. Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 800 - 1600 = -800 kilograms.
Response:  If Vincent buys 3 flowers in packages of $R$ 2.50 each, he will spend $R$ 7.50 (3 x $R$ 2.50).  If he buys 2 flowers in packages of $R$ 1 each, he will spend $R$ 2 (2 x $R$ 1). So, if he buys 18 flowers altogether, he will save $R$ 5 ($R$ 7.50 - $R$ 2 = $R$ 5).
Response:  Firstly, we know that John paid $100 for the haircut. Then, he got a discount of 30%, which is equal to $30. So, the final price he paid was $70 ($100 - $30).
Response:  We know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 4 liters (since 24 / 6 = 4). Now we are told that one boy received 6 liters of water. So, if we subtract the amount of water the boy received from the total amount of water received by the two girls, we get the remaining amount of water: 4 - 6 = -2 liters. Therefore, there are -2 liters of water left over.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie had initially 10 auto-adhesives. Then he bought 21 stickers from a store in the shopping mall and received 23 more for his birthday. So far, Charlie has spent 44 adhesives (21 + 23). Now, he gave 9 of them to his sister, leaving him with 35 adhesives (44 - 9 = 35). Therefore, Charlie still has 35 auto-adhesives left.
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 45 kg and Alex weighs less than her. So, if we call the weight of Alex x kilograms, we can write the equation: 45 + x = 100 (since the total weight is equal to 100). Solving for x, we get: x = 55 kg. Therefore, the total weight of Grace and Alex together is 45 + 55 = 100 kg.
Response:  We have three rose bushes with 25 roses each. So, we have 3 x 25 = 75 roses in total. Since each rose has 8 spines, there are 75 x 8 = 600 spines altogether. Therefore, the correct answer is 600.
"Response:  We know that the team won 8 more games than they lost. So, if they won x games and lost y games, we can write this as:

x - y = 8... (1)
We also know that the total number of games played was 22. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 22... (2)
Now, let's solve for x in Equation (1):

x - y = 8
x = y + 8
Substituting this into Equation (2), we get:
y + 8 = 22
y = 14
So, the team won 8 more games than they lost, which means they won 14 games and lost 6 games."
Response:  Since he has been taking four vacations per year since he was 23 years old and he is now 34 years old, we can calculate that he has taken 170 vacations (4 x 40 = 160 + 10).  Therefore, there are 170 blocks of collar in total.
Response:  The alarm clock rang three times when it first went off today. So, in total, it rang for 3 + 3 = 6 times during its first two instances. Then, it rang for half the time of the second instance (i.e., 3/2 x 3 = 4) during its third instance. Therefore, the alarm clock rang a total of 6 + 4 = 10 times today.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sylvie received $600 per month as her initial salary. Then, after five years of service, she will receive a 10% increase in her salary every year, which means her annual salary at the end of five years is: $600 x (1 + 0.1) = $660. Now, if she serves for three more years, her annual salary becomes: $660 x (1 + 0.1) x (1 + 0.1) = $738. So, Sylvie's annual salary after serving for three more years is $738.
"Response:  We know that the first album of Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than the one of Harald. So if the number of copies sold by Marilyn is x, then the number of copies sold by Harald is 10x. Moreover, we are told that the total number of copies sold was 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:

11x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, the number of copies sold by Harald is 10 times 8,000, which is equal to 80,000."
Response:  We know that there are 16 friends invited to the party and each friend will receive 75 presents (since one-fourth of the participants do not appear). So, we need to calculate how many presents we need in total. The cost of each present is $2, so we multiply the number of presents by their cost to get the total amount spent on presents: Total Amount Spent = Number of Presents x Cost per Present = 16 friends x 75 presents x $2/present = $300. Therefore, Christina will spend $300 on presents for her guests.
Response:  If an adult dinosaur will eat 10 kilograms of potato salad and a child will eat half of what an adult eats, then we can calculate how much each adult and child will eat as follows: Adult: 10 kg / 1 = 10 kg per person Child: 10 kg x 0.5 = 5 kg per person Now, let's find out how many kilograms of potato salad Ted needs to bring for all the dinosaurs at the picnic: Total number of adults = 20 Total number of children = 5 So, total amount of potato salad needed = Number of adults x amount of potato salad each adult will eat + Number of children x amount of potato salad each child will eat = 20 x 10 + 5 x 5 = 100 + 25 = 125 kilograms Therefore, Ted needs to bring 125 kilograms of potato salad for the picnic.
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three times more pets than Marcia.
Marcia has more pets than Cindy.
Cindy has four pets.
So, we can write an equation based on these statements:
Let J be the number of pets Jan has = 3x (where x is the number of pets Marcia has)
Let M be the number of pets Marcia has = x + 2 (since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy)
Let C be the number of pets Cindy has = 4
Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies all the equations.
We know that J = 3x and M = x + 2, so we can substitute J = 3x in M = x + 2:
M = (3x) + 2
Substituting the value of J from the first equation, we get:
(3x) + 2 = x + 2
Simplifying, we get:
2x = 2
X = 1
Therefore, Jan has 3 times more pets than Marcia, who has 1 pet more than Cindy, who has 4 pets."
"Response:  We know that:
Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Amy's age = Jackson's age + 5.
Jackson is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Corey's age = Jackson's age - 2.
James is one year younger than Corey. So, Corey's age = James's age - 1.
Now we have three equations:
Age of Amy = Age of Jackson + 5... (1)
Age of Jackson = Age of Corey - 2... (2)
Age of Corey = Age of James - 1... (3)
We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the ages of all the children. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
Age of Jackson = Age of Corey - 7
Substituting this value into equation (3), we get:
Age of Corey = Age of James - 8
So, the ages of the children are:
Amy - 16 years old
Jackson - 10 years old
Corey - 9 years old
James - 8 years old"
Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters with hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be able to run it two seconds faster than Gerald, then we know that Lee ran it in 36 seconds (2 seconds faster than Gerald). Now, if Gerald improved his speed by 10%, then he can now run 400 meters with hurdles in x seconds, where x is 36 + (10% of 36) = 39.6 seconds. So, Gerald can run 400 meters with hurdles in 39.6 seconds.
Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer coelhos than the number of dogs and cats combined. So if we have x dogs, then the number of cats is 60 - x. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of coelhos is 2x. Therefore, the total number of animals in the neighborhood is 60 - 2x.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students, 100 are boys and 50 are girls. Since 2/5 of the boys are in the uniform, we have 50 x 2/5 = 40 boys in the uniform. Similarly, since 2/3 of the girls are in the uniform, we have 50 x 2/3 = 33 girls in the uniform. Therefore, there are 40 - 33 = 7 boys who are not in the uniform. So, there are 7 raparigas who are not in the uniform.
Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours last night and his friend James slept for less than 9 hours but more than 2/3 of the time that Harry slept, then we can write an equation based on this information:  Harry slept for x hours, where x is a positive integer (whole number). Since James slept for less than 9 hours, we know that x > 9. Also, since James slept for more than 2/3 of the time that Harry slept, we can write another inequality: 2x/3 < 9. Now we have two inequalities to work with:  x > 9 and 2x/3 < 9. Can you solve these inequalities to find out how many hours more Harry slept than James?
"Response:  We know that when Freda cooks canned tomatoes in sauce, they lose half their volume. So if she uses 40 grams of canned tomatoes (which contain three tomatoes), after cooking, they will reduce to 20 grams (half of 40 grams). Now, let's calculate how many tomatoes were used based on the amount of sauce left. If the last lot of tomato sauce had 32 ounces, and each ounce contains 85 grams (since there are 16 tablespoons in an ounce), then the total amount of sauce used is:

32 ounces x 85 grams/ounce = 2700 grams
Now, we need to convert this amount from grams to number of tomatoes. Since each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide the total amount of sauce used by the weight of one can of tomatoes:

2700 grams / 40 grams/can = 67.5 cans
So, Freda used approximately 67.5 cans of tomatoes while making the tomato sauce."
Response:  We know that some cars passed through the bottleneck in the first 15 minutes and another 20 cars passed through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, in total, 35 cars passed through the bottleneck (the initial 15 + the additional 15). Now, we are told that 5 cars took a detour to avoid passing through the bottleneck. Therefore, the number of cars that actually passed through the bottleneck is 35 - 5 = 30 cars.
Response:  Mary already has two plants in pots at each of her 40 windowsills (a total of 80 plants). She decides to give one plant pot away to friends and family tomorrow (a total of 81 plants). So, after giving away one plant pot, Mary will have 79 plants left in her house.
Response:  We know that the first friend tolled the bell 20 times before Jerome opened the door. So the second friend must have tolled it 5 times more than the first (since he tolled it 20 + 5 = 25 times). The third friend tolled it 10 times more than the second friend (so 25 x 3 = 75 times), and the fourth friend tolled it 60 - 75 = 85 times. Therefore, in total, the four friends tolled the bell 85 times.
"Response:  If Solo has to read 4 pages of his science book, 20 pages of his social studies book, 7 pages of his history book, and 8 pages of his geography book in total, then he needs to read:

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages

If he has 5 days left to finish reading all these books, then he needs to read:

Pages per day = Total pages / Number of days = 49 pages / 5 days = 9.8 pages/day

So, Solo needs to read approximately 9.8 pages per day to finish reading all the required books within 5 days."
Response:  Monday to Friday, John drinks water with breakfast, lunch and dinner, so he drinks 3 times per day x 5 days = 15 cups of water per week. On Saturday and Sunday, John relaxes and drinks a refrigerant instead of water, so he drinks 2 times per day x 2 days = 4 cups of refrigerant per week. Therefore, in total, John drinks 15 + 4 = 19 cups of liquid per week.
"Response:  We know that the bank of fog rolls over the ocean and takes 10 minutes to cover each 3 miles of city. So, if we divide the distance of the city (42 miles) by the distance covered in one minute (3 miles), we get:
Time = Distance / Speed = 42 miles / 3 miles/minute = 14 minutes
Therefore, it will take 14 minutes for the bank of fog to cover the entire city."
Response:  If Poppy has placed one fourth of the pieces (25%), then her mother has placed one third of the remaining pieces (33%). So, in total, Poppy and her mother have placed 58% of the total number of pieces (25 + 33 = 58). Therefore, there are still 42% of the pieces left to be placed (100 - 58 = 42%).
Response:  If Cody comes three times more balls than Amir, then for every ball that Amir eats, Cody will eat 3 + 1 = 4 balls.  So if Amir eats 5 biscuits, Cody will eat 5 x 4 = 20 biscuits.
"Response:  The volume of each box is given by the formula V = l × w × h, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height of the box, respectively. Since we have three boxes, their volumes can be calculated separately using the same formula:
V1 = l1 × w1 × h1
V2 = l2 × w2 × h2
V3 = l3 × w3 × h3
Since the dimensions of each box are given in centimeters (cm), we need to convert them to meters (m) before calculating their volumes:
l1 = 15 cm = 0.15 m
w1 = 15 cm = 0.15 m
h1 = 15 cm = 0.15 m
l2 = 15 cm = 0.15 m
w2 = 15 cm = 0.15 m
h2 = 15 cm = 0.15 m
l3 = 15 cm = 0.15 m
w3 = 15 cm = 0.15 m
h3 = 15 cm = 0.15 m
Now we can calculate the volumes of each box:
V1 = 0.15 m × 0.15 m × 0.15 m = 0.2875 m³
V2 = 0.15 m × 0.15 m × 0.15 m = 0.2875 m³
V3 = 0.15 m × 0.15 m × 0.15 m = 0.2875 m³
The total volume of all three boxes is simply the sum of their individual volumes:
Total Volume = V1 + V2 + V3 = 0.2875 m³ + 0.2875 m³ + 0.2875 m³ = 0.86 m³
Therefore, the volume internal total of all three boxes is approximately 0.86 cubic meters or 860 cubic centimeters."
Response:  We know that Frankie watched TV for 7 hours in total. On Tuesday and Thursday, he watched an hour-long program each night. So, he watched 2 x 1 = 2 episodes of the show on those days. On Wednesday, he watched some episodes of a 30-minute program, but we don't know how many. Therefore, let's assume he watched half an episode (15 minutes) on Wednesday. That means he watched a total of 2 + 15 = 17 minutes of TV on Wednesday. Finally, on Friday, he stayed up late and watched two episodes of a one-hour program. So, he watched 2 x 60 = 120 minutes of TV on Friday. In summary, Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, which is equal to 490 minutes. Therefore, if he watched 30-minute programs, he watched 490 / 30 = 16 episodes of the show on Monday.
Response:  Last year, Henry made $X$ biscuits. This year, he wants to double that amount, so he makes $2X$ biscuits. However, when he finishes baking and counts them, he realizes that he accidentally added $5$ more biscuits, making a total of $110$ biscuits. Therefore, last year, Henry made $X = \frac{110}{2} - 5 = 55$ biscuits.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much someone would pay for 10 gallons of gasoline at the local station if they paid in US dollars. So, 10 gallons x US$ 3,00 per gallon = US$ 30,00. Now, let's consider the rebate offered by the application company. They will give US$ 20,00 as a rebate for each gallon of gasoline purchased at that station. Therefore, after purchasing 10 gallons of gasoline and getting the rebate, the total amount spent would be US$ 30,00 - US$ 20,00 = US$ 10,00.
Response:  We know that Beatrice had 24 rolos of length and 2 rolos of width, for a total area of 48 square rolos (since each rolo has an area of 9 square centimeters). Similarly, Marcel had 14 rolos of length and 3 rolos of width, for a total area of 42 square rolos. So, if they both ate the entire supply of fruit rolls, their average consumption would be:  Average Consumption = (Beatrice's Area + Marcel's Area) / 2  = (48 + 42) / 2 = 90 square rolos.
Response:  We know that while Julia was in the lake, the boat was leaking and taking in two liters of water for every ten feet it rowed towards the shore. Since Julia took six meters to reach the shore, she had rowed for 6/10 = 3/5 of the distance to the shore. Therefore, the boat had taken in 2 x (3/5) = 1.2 liters of water when Julia reached the shore.
Response:  If there are 4 teachers who take turns using the classroom and each teacher has 2 classes per day, then there will be a total of 8 classes in one day (4 teachers x 2 classes/teacher). Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per aula, it will be cleaned 24 times in one day (8 classes x 3 times/class). Therefore, the whiteboard will be cleaned 24 times in one day.
Response:  If Ryan plants two flowers per day in his garden and it takes 15 days for them to grow, then he will have planted a total of 30 flowers (2 x 15 = 30). However, if 5 of these flowers did not grow, then Ryan will actually have 25 flowers in his garden (30 - 5 = 25).
Response:  We know that the number of photographs in Jamal's phone is six times more than the number of photographs in Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone has x photographs, then Jamal's phone has 6x photographs.  Moreover, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can contain is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo. Therefore, if there are y birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo, then the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can contain is 50y.  Now, we are given that Jamal's phone contains 1800 photographs. If we want to find out how many birds are in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo, we can set up the following equation:  Number of photographs in Jamal's phone = 6(Number of photographs in Brittany's phone) = 6(50y) = 300y  Substituting the value 1800 for Jamal's phone, we get: 300y = 1800  Divide both sides by 300: y = 6  Therefore, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the materials that Sasha has. The ten tábuas of 2x4x10 have a total cost of $100 (US$10 each x 10 pieces). Similarly, the five quadros of 4x4x10 have a total cost of $80 (US$16 each x 5 pieces). Therefore, the total cost of all the materials is $180. Now, let's find out how much money Sasha can make from selling these materials. If she sells them at their original price, she will make a profit of $180 - $100 = $80. So, her profit is $80.
"Response:  We know that Katy used 7 times as many spoonfuls of sugar as she did of water. So if she used x spoonfuls of sugar, she used 7x spoonfuls of water. Since there are 120 spoons in all, we can set up the equation:

x + (7x) = 120

Simplifying this equation, we get:

8x = 120

Dividing both sides by 8, we find that:

x = 15

So Katy used 15 spoonfuls of sugar."
Response:  If John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 sons, then he will buy a total of 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John will pay a total of $360. Therefore, the answer is $360.
Response:  On day one, there were two containers with 5 vehicles each, so in total, there were 10 vehicles imported. If more containers arrived on the second day, then the number of vehicles imported that day would be: $ Number of containers \times Number of vehicles per container = 30$ So, the number of contenters imported on the second day is 30.
Response:  Four years ago, Adrien was earning $40,000 and Lylah was earning $25,000 (since her salary was 30% less than Adrien's). So their combined salary four years ago was $65,000 ($40,000 + $25,000). Now, if Adrien's salary increased by 40%, then his new salary is $57,000 ($40,000 x 1.4) and Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Therefore, her new salary is $31,500 ($25,000 x 1.4). So the combined salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $88,500 ($57,000 + $31,500).
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 blocks of paper per week and there are 30 sheets in each block, then he will use 60 sheets (2 x 30) per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he will use 240 sheets (60 x 4) per month.
Response:  We know that Morisette brought 5 maçãs and 8 laranjas, so together they brought 13 frutas (5 + 8 = 13). Now, we are told that Kael brought twice as many maçãs as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 maçãs. He also brought half of the number of laranjas that Morisette brought, which is 8 / 2 = 4 laranjas. So in total, Morisette and Kael brought 13 + 10 + 4 = 27 frutas.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. If she had to complete some tasks, then on Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept for 6 hours each day (2 hours less than Monday). So, in total, Sadie slept for 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours during those three days. Now, if we add the extra hour she slept on Thursday (1 hour more than on Monday), we get 20 + 1 = 21 hours of sleep for the week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rosie can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means she covers a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles in this time period. Now, after running for 3 hours, her speed reduces to 8 km/h. To find out how many kilometers she can cover in 7 hours, we need to multiply her new speed by the time taken (in hours): Distance covered = Speed x Time = 8 km/h x 7 hours = 56 km So, Rosie can cover 56 kilometers in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jennie started helping at her mother's office, there were 60 cards that needed stamps and another pile of 30 already stamped cards. So in total, there were 90 cards (60 + 30).
Response:  Julia bought a new package of 5 colheres and her husband also gave her 3 more colheres, so together they have 8 colheres. Later, when she was putting the table, she had a total of 12 colheres. Therefore, the number of colheres in the package that Julia bought is 8.
Response:  We know that Dylan needed 40 salsichas (29 + 11) to make the bolinhos de salsicha for the party. Since he bought more than enough salsichas of chicken, we can say that he bought 38 x = salsichas of chicken. Now, let's find out how many salsichas of fish he bought. We are told that he bought 6 salsichas of fish less than the number of salsichas of chicken he bought. So, if x is the number of salsichas of chicken, then the number of salsichas of fish he bought is 6 - x. Therefore, the total number of salsichas Dylan bought is 38x + (6 - x).
Response:  We know that after moving to a new school, Amy made more than 20 friends. So let's say she made x friends. Since Lily made 50 friends, we can write an equation: Amy + Lily = Total number of friends. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: x + 50 = Total number of friends. Solving for x, we find that Amy has 30 friends and Lily has 20 friends. Therefore, the total number of friends they have together is 50 (Lily) + 30 (Amy) = 80 friends.
Response:  If each melon costs three times more than each pepper, then each melon costs $3x = 3(15) = 45 dollars.  Therefore, the total cost of 4 melons is $45 x 4 = 180 dollars.  Similarly, since each orange costs $5 less than each melon, each orange costs $45 - $5 = $40 dollars.  The total cost of 10 oranges is therefore $40 x 10 = 400 dollars.  So, in total, Dillon will spend $180 + $400 = $580 dollars.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many hours the doctors work in one day. Since each doctor sees an average of 24 minutes per patient, they see 6 patients per hour (since there are 500 patients per day). So, the total number of hours worked by all doctors is:

$$ \text {Total hours worked by doctors} = \frac{\text{Number of patients seen}}{ \text{Time taken to see each patient}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Total hours worked by doctors} = \frac{500}{24} = 20\text{ hours} $$

Now, let's find out how much money the doctors make from their work. As mentioned earlier, each doctor charges $150 per hour and works for $20$ hours. Therefore, the total amount earned by the doctors is:

$$ \text {Total amount earned by doctors} = \text {Total hours worked by doctors} \times \text {Hourly wage of doctors} $$

Substituting the values obtained above, we get:

$$ \text {Total amount earned by doctors} = 20\text{ hours} \times $150 $\per$hour = $3000 $$

Finally, let's find out how much profit the hospital makes from these visits. The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients, and since the doctors work for $20$ hours, the total revenue generated by the hospital is:

$$ \text {Total revenue generated by hospital} = \text {Total hours worked by doctors} \times \text {Hourly wage of hospital} $$

Substituting the values obtained above, we get:

$$ \text {Total revenue generated by hospital} = 20\text{ hours} \times $200 $\per$hour = $4000 $$

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $1000 ($4000 - $3000) from these visits."
Response:  First, we know that Nissa hired 60 temporary workers to play Santa's helpers in her department store's Christmas village. Then, after some children threw up on them and gave them wedgies, 30 of these elves quit their jobs (since they were already unhappy with their job). So, there are now 30 elves left. Finally, since 10 more elves quit after being hit by kids, there are only 20 elves remaining. Therefore, the answer is 20.
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. So in June, his expenses were $60 less than that, which is $440 ($500 - $60). Therefore, the total expenses of Joseph in those two months are $500 + $440 = $940.
Response:  Pam went on the roller coaster twice, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets.  Fred went on it four times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets. Then they both went on the slide two times each, using another 2 x 6 = 12 tickets in total. Therefore, the total number of tickets used that day is 12 + 24 + 12 = 58 tickets.
Response:  On Monday, Walter walked 6 km. On Tuesday, he walked six times more than he did on Monday, so he walked 6 x 6 = 36 km. On Wednesday, he walked three times as far as he did on Tuesday, so he walked 36 x 3 = 108 km. Finally, on Thursday, he walked four times as far as he did on Wednesday, so he walked 108 x 4 = 432 km. Therefore, Walter walked 432 km on Thursday.
Response:  If Tom receives 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then he pays for 4 x $15 = $60 per month. Therefore, in one year (12 months), Tom pays $60 x 12 = $720 for all his car washes.
Response:  We know that Bobby has 5 less games than Brian and 3 times more games than Brian. So if Brian has x games of video, Bobby has 3x games. Since Brian lost 5 games before the comparison, he now has 20 - 5 = 15 games left. Therefore, Bobby has 3 \* 15 = 45 games of video.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in the world and two-thirds of them are located in Scotland (i.e., 19 unicorns). Since three-fourths of the Scottish unicorns are females (i.e., 15 females), we can conclude that there are 15 female unicorns in Scotland. Therefore, the number of female unicorns in Scotland is 15.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each item that she wants to buy:  * Sandwiches: 2 x $2 = $4.00  * French fries: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00  * Cookies: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00 Total cost of items = $9.00 Now, let's add the delivery charge: 20% of $9.00 = $1.80 So, the total cost of her order is $9.00 + $1.80 = $10.80 Finally, if she adds an extra $5.00 for the gorjeta, the new total cost will be $10.80 + $5.00 = $15.80
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark completed the first test with 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. So, he took 75/5 = 15 hours to complete the test. Now, let's find out how many questions Mark left unanswered in the second test. We are given that he took 6 hours to complete the test with 100 questions. Therefore, he answered 100/6 = 16.67 questions per hour. Since there were 100 total questions in the test, Mark left 100 - (16.67 x 6) = 43.33 questions unanswered.
Response:  We know that there are 22 red balls and 4 times more blue balls than red balls. So, if there are x blue balls, then there would be 22 + 4x blue balls in total. Since there are 12 blue balls, we can set up the equation: 22 + 4x = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 blue balls.
Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for rent and we have already identified how many of them are automatic (12) or manual (4). So, the number of semi-automatic cars is equal to the total number of cars minus the number of automatic and manual cars. Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows: Percentage = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) x 100%  Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4) = 4 Semi-automatic cars out of 20 cars = 4/20 x 100% = 20%  Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the 20 available for rent is 20%.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in the hive and that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, if there are x baby bees, there are 2x worker bees. Now we also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees. Therefore, the number of queen bees is 2x/3 = 4x/3. Finally, since there are 700 bees in total, the number of worker bees must be equal to the total number of bees minus the number of queens, which is 700 - 4x/3 = 700 - 12x/3. Solving for x, we get x = 80. Thus, there are 80 worker bees in the hive.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. According to the question, he plays for 2 hours every day, which means he spends 14 hours (2 x 7) playing video games per week.  Next, we need to calculate his earnings from his part-time job. Since he works at $10/hour, and he works for 3 hours per day (since he has a full-time job too), he earns $30 per day ($10/hour x 3 hours). Therefore, he earns $210 per week ($30 x 7 days).  Now, let's find out how much money Jordan would make if he spent all of his time playing video games instead of working. His total earnings from playing video games are $140 (14 hours x $10/hour). So, if he spent all of his time playing video games, he would have earned an additional $790 ($210 + $140).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all non-food items that John bought: Leite x $ 2 = $ 2, Ovos x $ 3 = $ 9, Lâmpadas x $ 3 = $ 9, Copos x $ 3 = $ 9, Armadilhas x $ 4 = $ 16. Total cost of non-food items = $ 2 + $ 9 + $ 9 + $ 9 + $ 16 = $ 50. Now, let's calculate the tax amount: Tax rate = 10%. Tax amount = $ 50 x 10% = $ 5. So, the final price that John paid for all the items is: Final price = Total cost + Tax amount = $ 50 + $ 5 = $ 55.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kim has already signed up three clients and is in talks with five more potential clients. So, let's assume he will sign up all eight clients (3 + 5 = 8).  Next, we are told that each house will require two bottles of cleaning solution and one package of cloths for cleaning. The cost of each bottle of cleaning solution is $2, and the cost of each package of cloths is $5. Therefore, the total cost of materials for each house is $2 x 2 = $4, plus $5 x 1 = $5.  Now, let's calculate the revenue from each client. Since there are eight clients, and each client requires two bottles of cleaning solution and one package of cloths, the total revenue from each client is $4 x 2 = $8, plus $5 x 1 = $5. So, the total revenue from all eight clients is $8 x 8 = $64.  Finally, we need to subtract the total costs from the total revenue to find out the profit. The profit is equal to the difference between the total revenue and total costs. In this case, the profit is $64 - ($4 x 8) = $64 - $32 = $32 per week.  Therefore, Lucas will make $32 per week in profit.
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land and there are 100 abacaxes per hectare. So, in total, John has 1000 abacaxes (10 x 100 = 1000). Since he can harvest his abacaxes every 3 months, we will divide the total number of abacaxes by the number of times he can harvest them in a year: 1000 / 4 = 250 abacaxes per year. Therefore, John can harvest 250 abacaxes in a year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John has played with three sets of Lego blocks in total. The first set had 500 pieces, and each subsequent set had twice as many pieces as the previous one (i.e., 2 times 500 = 1000 for the second set, and 3 times 1000 = 3000 for the third set). Therefore, the total number of Lego pieces that John has is equal to the sum of these three quantities: 500 + 1000 + 3000 = 4500 pieces. So, if John picks up all the Lego blocks from his floor, he will have picked up 4500 pieces.
Response:  We know that in the first 6 hours of the day, Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive and not return. Then, during the next 6 hours, she sees half of those bees (15 bees) return to the hive. So, the total number of bees that returned to the hive within the last 6 hours is 15 + 30 = 45 bees. Therefore, the answer is 45 bees.
Response:  The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. So, if the mother paid for two tickets, she paid a total of $22. If she received $8 in change, that means she overpaid by $14 ($22 - $8 = $14). Therefore, the amount of money the mother gave to the cashier is $14.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times more friends than Dorothy on Facebook. So if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends.  Then we are told that James has four times more friends than Dorothy. So if Dorothy has x friends, James has 4x friends.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  Charlie has 3x friends, and James has 4x friends.  Can you solve for x now?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve lives farther away from school than Tim does. So, he can bike faster than Tim. Secondly, we are given that Steve can cycle at 440 feet per minute, while Tim can skate at 264 feet per minute. Thirdly, we need to find out how long it will take for both of them to reach home after starting their journey simultaneously from the school entrance. Finally, we want to determine who will arrive first.  To solve this problem, let's use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance between Steve's house and the school is 5 kilometers or 5000 feet (since there are 1000 feet in a kilometer). Similarly, the distance between Tim's house and the school is also 3 kilometers or 3000 feet. Now, let's calculate the time taken by each person to cover these distances using their respective speeds:  For Steve: Time = Distance / Speed = 5000 feet / 440 feet/minute = 11.3 minutes  For Tim: Time = Distance / Speed = 3000 feet / 264 feet/minute = 11.7 minutes  Since both Steve and Tim start their journey from the same point (the school entrance), they will reach their homes at the same time if they start simultaneously. However, since Steve has a longer distance to cover, he will take slightly more time than Tim to reach his destination. Therefore, the winner (i.e., the one who arrives first) is...Steve! He will have to wait approximately 11.3 minutes before Tim reaches his home.
Response:  On the first day, 5 people came to inflate their tires, and each tire cost $0.25 to inflate. So, in total, they paid $1.25 for inflating their tires. Now, let's consider the number of tricycles that came for inflation. Three tricycles were brought for inflation, and each tricycle has three tires (front, rear left, and rear right). Therefore, the total number of tires inflated from tricycles was 3 x 3 = 9 tires. Since each tire costs $0.25 to inflate, the total amount paid for inflating tricycle tires was 9 x $0.25 = $2.25. Finally, one person came with a bicycle, and each bicycle has two tires. So, the total number of tires inflated from this person's bicycle was 2 tires, which cost $0.50 to inflate. In summary, the total amount earned by Shawnda on the first day was $1.25 + $2.25 + $0.50 = $4.00.
Response:  If Carl buys 12 packages of cookies and each package has 6 cookies inside, then he bought a total of 72 cookies (12 x 6 = 72).  Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl paid a total of $7.20 for all the cookies ($0.10 x 72 = $7.20). So, if he received a $10 note as change, he would have $2.80 left over ($10 - $7.20 = $2.80).
Response:  When Dave bought the package of French fries, there were x fries in it. He ate 14 before a hungry seagull stole the package from his hand. So, there were x - 14 fries left when the seagull took them. Then, three sparrows came and each one ate three fries, leaving x - 9 fries. Later, a crow stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is equal to (2/3) \* (x - 9) = 5 fries. Therefore, when Dave bought the package of French fries, there were 5 fries in it.
Response:  On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, Kimo has three one-hour classes per day. Therefore, he spends 3 x 60 = 180 minutes in class per week.  In a semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, Kimo spends 180 minutes/week x 16 weeks = 2880 minutes or 47 hours per semester attending classes.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many points are there in each product. For example, in rolls, there are 300 rolls x 10 cm/roll = 3000 cm of length. Similarly, for croissants and baguettes, we have:

* Croissants: 120 croissants x 20 cm/croissant = 2400 cm of length
* Baguettes: 60 baguettes x 60 cm/baguette = 3600 cm of length

Now, let's assume that Bill places all these products side by side, point to point, without overlapping them. The total length of all these products will be:

Total length = Rolls + Croissants + Baguettes
= 3000 cm + 2400 cm + 3600 cm
= 9000 cm

Therefore, it will take Bill approximately 9000 / 10 = 900 days to place all the products end to end."
Response:  The zookeeper feeds all monkeys in the zoo every two months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month, how many bananas does the zookeeper need to order for 2 months? To find out, we can multiply each group of monkeys by the number of months they will be fed. So, the total number of bananas needed for 2 months is: Monkeys that need 200 bananas/month x 2 months = 400 bananas Gorillas that need 400 bananas/month x 2 months = 800 bananas Baboons that need 100 bananas/month x 2 months = 200 bananas Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order a total of 1,400 bananas for 2 months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that O Blake ran backwards and forwards 15 times in total. Since he did this in a field of 100 meters long, his distance covered would be 15 x 100 = 1500 meters.  Now, let's consider Kelly's runs. She initially ran once from the starting point to the 40-yard line (which is 30 yards or 27.43 meters) and then back again. So her distance covered was 30 + 30 = 60 meters. Then she repeated this process 34 times, so her total distance covered was 60 x 34 = 2040 meters.  Therefore, the winner (Kelly) covered more distance than the loser (O Blake), who covered 1500 meters, which means that Kelly won the race by 540 meters (2040 - 1500).
Response:  The cost of each pencil is $1.50, and he bought 4 pencils, so he spent $6 (4 x $1.50).  The cost of each notebook is $4.00, and he bought 2 notebooks, so he spent $8 (2 x $4.00).  Finally, the cost of the paper was $20. So, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  Initially, Finn observed 11 goblins swimming in the lake. Then he saw six of them coming out from underneath a blanket and two more hiding beneath a stone. So, now there are 6 + 2 = 8 goblins that Finn can see in the lake. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  On Monday (second day), the depth of water in the tank was 5 meters. So, the volume of water in the tank at that time is 5 meters x 100% = 5 cubic meters.  On Tuesday (third day), the depth of water increased by 2 meters, so the new volume of water in the tank is 5 + 2 = 7 cubic meters.  On Wednesday (fourth day), the depth of water decreased to two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the new volume of water in the tank is 7 / 3 = 4.67 cubic meters. Therefore, the depth of water in the tank on Wednesday is 4.67 meters.
Response:  We know that Anakin caught 3 more fish than Locsin. So, if Anakin caught 3 peixes-palhaço, then Locsin caught 3 - 3 = 0 peixes-palhaço. Therefore, the number of fish that both of them caught together is:  Anakin's catch + Locsin's catch = 10 + 5 = 15 fish.
Response:  After 1 month, the price of the bag of candies will increase by 20%. So, the new price is $24 (20 x 1.2).  After 2 months, the price will increase again by 20%, so the new price is $28.80 ($24 x 1.2 x 1.2 = $28.80).  We continue this process for 36 months, and at each stage, the price increases by 20%. Therefore, after 36 months, the price of the bag of candy would be $97.60 ($20 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 = $97.60).
Response:  We know that one figure of action costs $5 and we have 3 figures of actions in total. So, they cost $15 together.  Now, let's calculate how much each toy costs: * Carros vermelhos - There are 5 cars, so their total cost is $5 x 5 = $25. * Figuras de ação - There are 3 figures of action, so their total cost is $15. * Boneca - The boneca costs $3 + $4 (for the car) = $7. Therefore, all the toys together cost $25 + $15 + $7 = $47.
"Response:  If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will save $35/hour in lost income from working less time on freelance work. So, if she works 3 hours less, she will earn $105 ($35 x 3) less than if she hired an accountant. Therefore, the cost of hiring an accountant is:

$90 (cost of hiring an accountant) - $105 (lost income from working less freelance work) = $15

So, hiring an accountant will actually save Jackie money."
Response:  Firstly, Elvira spent 1090 euros on the computer itself (ecrã, teclado e rato). Then she spent another 157 euros on the scanner and 74 euros on the CD burner. Finally, she spent 102 euros on the printer. In total, Elvira spent 1423 euros (1090 + 157 + 74 + 102). Now let's check how much money she had to spare for buying clothes: According to the problem statement, Elvira received 1500 euros as a gift from her family. Subtracting the amount she spent on the computer and accessories (1423 euros), we get 77 euros left over for buying clothes. So, Elvira will have 77 euros to spend on clothes.
"Response:  If the neighbor gives Sandra 9 eggs each time she takes care of her daughter, and Sandra needs 3 eggs to make a Spanish omelette, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many times Sandra has to take care of her daughter for the neighbor to give her enough eggs to make one Spanish omelette.

Number of eggs needed = 3
Number of eggs given per time = 9

So, Sandra has to take care of her daughter for 9 / 3 = 3 times for the neighbor to give her enough eggs to make one Spanish omelette.

Step 2: Now that we know how many times Sandra has to take care of her daughter, let's calculate how many times she will have to do it in total if she is asked to make 15 Spanish omelettes for the school fundraiser.

Total number of Spanish omelettes requested = 15
Number of eggs needed per omelette = 3

So, Sandra will have to take care of her daughter 15 x 3 = 45 times in total to make all the Spanish omelettes requested."
Response:  We know that Seth is older than Brooke and has twice her age in 2 years. So, if Brooke is x years old, then Seth is 2x years old. Now we are told that the sum of their ages will be 28 in 2 years. Therefore, we can write an equation: 2x + x = 28. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 28. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 9. So, Brooke is 9 years old and Seth is 18 years old (twice Brooke's age).
Response:  If Jimmy has $2 more than double what Ethel has, then we can write an equation as follows:  Jimmy = 2 x (double of Ethel)  Substituting the value given in the question, we get:  Jimmy = 2 x 8  = 16  So, Jimmy has $16.
"Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), he walks 30 km per day. So, in one week, he walks:

30 km/day x 5 days = 150 km/week

Now, let's calculate how much he walks on weekends (Saturday and Sunday):

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 16 km/day. So, in one weekend, he walks:

16 km/day x 2 days = 32 km/weekend

Adding both amounts, we get:

150 km/week + 32 km/weekend = 182 km/week

Therefore, he walks approximately 182 km in a week."
Response:  The cost of each item is given as follows:  Chapéu - $25 Jaqueta - 3 times the cost of the cap = $25 x 3 = $75 Calções - half the cost of the cap and jaqueta = $25 + ($25 x 2) = $62 Therefore, each uniform costs: $25 (chapéu) + $75 (jaqueta) + $62 (calções) = $162
Response:  The number of spiders with 8 legs is 8 x 8 = 64.  The number of insects with 6 legs is 90 / 6 = 15.  And the number of rare mutants with 10 legs is 3 x 10 = 30. So, in total, Jake sees 64 + 15 + 30 = 109 legs.
Response:  We know that Sally Dois is three years older than Avó Vermelha, so Avó Vermelha is 3 + 1 = 4 years old.  Since Avó Red has twice the age of Sally Dois, Avó Red is 2 x 4 = 8 years old.  Now, we are told that Sally Quatro has the same age as Sally Trinta e Dois, and Sally Trinta e Dois is 8 years old. So, Sally Quatro is also 8 years old. Finally, since Sally Four is younger than all the other birds, she must be 0 years old. Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 4 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 12 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica has to pay each month for her student loans, credit card debt and mortgage.  For the student loans, she needs to pay at least $300 per month. For the credit card debt, she needs to pay at least $200 per month. And for the mortgage, she needs to pay at least $500 per month. So, in total, Jessica has to pay at least $1000 per month ($300 + $200 + $500). Now, if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, then she will have to pay $1500 per month ($1000 + $500). Therefore, in one year, Jessica will pay a total of $18,000 ($1500 x 12 months).
Response:  We know that Billy has to prepare 60 batatas for his family gathering. Each batata takes approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds (or 1.5 minutes) to cut and peel, since he needs to spend around 5 seconds cutting each one after peeling it. Therefore, the total time needed to prepare all 60 batatas would be: Time = Number of batatas x Time per batata = 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes. So, Billy will need around 90 minutes to finish preparing all the potatoes for his family gathering.
Response:  We know that they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, if they sold one gallon of lemonade, they would make $10 (20 x $0.50). Now we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. According to the problem, they made $25 in profit, so their total revenue must be equal to their total cost plus their profit. Therefore, we can set up the equation: Total Revenue = Total Cost + Profit Total Revenue = $25 Total Cost =? To solve for the unknown variable, we can use substitution. Substituting the given information into the first equation, we get: Total Lemons Sold = Total Revenue / Price Per Lemon Total Lemons Sold = $25 / $0.50 = 50 lemons They sold 50 lemons, which means they spent $50 on lemons ($0.50 x 50) to make $25 in profit.
Response:  We know that there are 240 people in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Asians who are not Japanese is 240 - 80 = 160. Now, we know that 60 of these non-Japanese Asians are boys, so the number of girls among the non-Japanese Asians is 160 - 60 = 100. Therefore, there are 100 Chinese girls in the team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends $ 1/4 of his monthly income on rent, which is $ 1500 (since he earns $ 6000 per month). Therefore, after paying rent, he has $ 4500 left ($ 6000 - $ 1500 = $ 4500).  Next, we know that he spends $ 1/3 of his monthly income on fuel for his car, which is $ 2000 (since he earns $ 6000 per month). So, after buying fuel, he has $ 2500 left ($ 4500 - $ 2000 = $ 2500).  Then, we are told that he donates half of what remains to his favorite charity, which is $ 1250 (half of $ 2500). So, after giving this amount to charity, he has $ 1250 left ($ 2500 - $ 1250 = $ 1250).  Finally, we are given that he gives $ 200 to his daughter and $ 700 to his wife for their expenses. For his daughter, he spends $ 200 out of the $ 1250 he has left, so he has $ 1050 left ($ 1250 - $ 200 = $ 1050). Similarly, for his wife, he spends $ 700 out of the $ 1250 he has left, so he has $ 550 left ($ 1250 - $ 700 = $ 550).  In conclusion, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid has $ 550 left in his bank account ($ 1250 - $ 1250 = $ 0).
Response:  We know that Rani has 12 more crabs than Monica, and Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, if Bo has 40 crabs, then Monica has 36 crabs (40 - 4 = 36). Now, we can calculate the number of crabs that Rani has as follows: Rani has 12 more crabs than Monica, so Rani has 36 + 12 = 48 crabs. Therefore, the total number of crabs that the three friends have together is 48 + 36 + 40 = 124 crabs.
Response:  First week (5 hours): $10/hour x 5 hours = $50 Second week (8 hours): $10/hour x 8 hours = $80 Total for two weeks: $50 + $80 = $130 So, Lloyd earned $130 in the first two weeks.
Response:  We know that there are two candidates running for representative of class in Sarai School. If one candidate obtained 3/4 of the votes and the number of students who voted was 80, then we can calculate the number of votes obtained by the other candidate as follows: Number of votes obtained by the other candidate = Total number of votes - Number of votes obtained by the winner Number of votes obtained by the winner = 3/4 x 80 = 60 Therefore, the number of votes obtained by the loser is 80 - 60 = 20.
Response:  We know that Sandra had ordered four times more red roses than white lilies (4 x 200 = 800). So, if they are not delivered until 5 pm, then she will be missing out on 400 roses (800 - 400 = 400). Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 400 red roses until 5 pm to avoid losing Sandra as a customer.
Response:  We know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is x years old, then Jean is x + 2 years old.  Moreover, we know that two years ago, Mark was five years younger than half of Jan's age. Therefore, if Jan is y years old now, then two years ago, Mark was y - 5 years old. Now, we can use the information given in the question to find out how old Mark and Jan are:  • Two years ago, Mark was y - 5 years old. So, his current age is y + 2 = 30 (since he is two years older than Mark).  • Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is also y + 2 = 32 (since he is two years older than Mark).
Response:  We know that Team B is less well-rounded than Team A and each member of Team B will run their stage in the following times:  $t_1 = 60$ seconds for the first runner, $t_2 = t_1 + 3$ seconds for the second runner, $t_3 = t_2 + 3$ seconds for the third runner, and so on.  Therefore, we can write:  $$t_4 = t_3 + 3$$  Substituting this into our equation for Team B's total time gives us:  $$T_B = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 +... + t_n = (60 + 3) + (t_2 + 3) + (t_3 + 3)...+ (t_{n-1} + 3)$$  Now, let's compare this to Team A's total time:  $$T_A = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 +... + t_n = 55 + 55 + 55...+ 55$$  Since Team B has members who are slower than Team A's members, we know that $t_i < t_j$ whenever $i < j$. In particular, since $t_1 = 60$ seconds, we have $t_1 < 55$, which means that Team B will finish with a time that is greater than or equal to $T_A$.  To find exactly how much faster Team B will be, we need to calculate the difference between $T_A$ and $T_B$:  $$D = T_B - T_A = \sum_{i=1}^n (t_i - t_{i-1})$$  Using the values given in the problem statement, we get:  $$D = (60 + 3) + (55 + 3) +... + (55 + 3) - (55 + 3) = 90$$  So, Team B will finish with a time that is $90$ seconds faster than Team A's time.
"Response:  If Jerry throws a six-sided die and gets an outcome of $x$, then there are six possible outcomes: $1,2,3,4,5$ or $6$. Since we want to know the probability that he will get a number greater than $3$, we can calculate this as follows:
Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
Favorable outcomes = Outcomes with a value greater than $3$
= ($4$, $5$, or $6$) / $6$
= $\frac{4}{6}$ + $\frac{5}{6}$ + $\frac{6}{6}$
= $\frac{6}{6}$ = $1$
Therefore, the probability that Jerry will launch a number larger than $3$ is $100\%$."
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked half of the apples from the orchard (which is equal to 50%), then they must have picked 100/2 = 50 apples in total. Since Jenna alone received 20 apples, that means she got 20/50 = 40% of all the apples they picked. So, the answer is 40%.
Response:  We know that there are 3 groups of rodents and each group has an equal number of rodents. So, if we have x rodents in total, then we must have 3x rodents in each group. Also, we know that each rat receives 6 pieces of hay, so the total number of pieces of hay distributed among all the rats is 3x \* 6 = 180. Now, since there are no other places where pallets are used in the store, the remaining 160 pieces of hay must be divided equally among the 10 hamsters, giving each one 16 pieces of hay. Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 3x / (160 - 16) = 3x/144 = 21.
Response:  The amount borrowed is $100 and the interest rate is 2% per month. So after one month, the amount due will be: $100 x (1 + 0.02) = $102. After two months, the amount due will be: $102 x (1 + 0.02) = $104.40. And so on... Therefore, if Mandy pays after three months, she must give to Benedict: $104.40 x (1 - 0.98) = $100.56.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of transporting each sack from the farm to the warehouse is $2. So, if he bought x sacks of wheat, the total cost of transportation will be $2x.  Secondly, after buying the sacks, he sold them at a price of $30 per sack, which means he made a profit of $30 - $20 = $10 per sack. Therefore, his total profit from all the sacks he sold will be $10x. Finally, since he made a profit of $400 overall, we can set up the equation: $10x = $400. Solving for x, we get: $10x = $400 $10x / $10 = $40 So, he sold 40 sacks of wheat.
Response:  Firstly, they spent $20.25 on three tickets to the fair. So each ticket cost $6.75. Secondly, they spent $4.50 less than they did on food than they did on tickets. Thirdly, they went on two different walks that cost $33 per person. Therefore, if they divided all costs equally among themselves, each of them paid $198.75 ($6.75 x 3 = $19.25 + $4.50 - $33).
Response:  If John collects pumpkins for 3 hours, he will have collected them for a total of 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. Since he can pick up 2 pumpkins per minute, he will have picked up a total of 180 x 2 = 360 pumpkins during those 3 hours. Therefore, John has collected 360 pumpkins.
Response:  If one pato needs 1.5 kg of insects per week to survive, then ten patos need 15 kg of insects per week (10 x 1.5 = 15). Now, if we divide this amount by seven days, we get the daily requirement for insects: 15 / 7 = 2.14 kg of insects per day. So, ten patos need approximately 2.14 kg of insects per day to survive.
Response:  After 1 year, he has 50 trees and cuts 2 trees. So now he has 48 trees.  In the next 9 years, he adds 90 trees (10 x 9 = 90) so he has 138 trees after 10 years. Now, 30% of the trees die every year, which is 36 trees (30% of 138). So, after 10 years, he has 102 trees left (138 - 36 = 102).
Response:  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 flamingos of plastic pink in front of Sue's house.  On Saturday morning, they returned one third of these flamingos and painted them white. Then, they put back those white flamingos in front of Sue's house. Finally, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 flamingos of plastic pink to the collection. So, at midday on Sunday, how many more plastic pink flamingos were there than white ones?  Solution: At midday on Sunday, there were 36 (18 + 18) flamingos in total, including both plastic pink and white ones. Therefore, the number of plastic pink flamingos was 24 (36 - 12).
Response: 1) Violetta needs to buy new pens in 5 different colors. So she will need 5 x $2 = $10 for all the pens together. 2) Each pen costs $2, so she will pay $10 / $2 = 5 pens. Therefore, she will receive $5 in change.
Response:  We know that one caneta costs R$ 1,20 and one lápis costs R$ 0,30. So, eight canetas would cost: 8 x R$ 1,20 = R$ 9,60.
"Response:  We have to distribute 200 kilograms of wheat among 40 restaurants in a certain city. Since each restaurant will receive one kilogram of wheat, we need to divide 200 kilograms by 40 restaurants. So, the number of kilograms that won't be used is:

$$ \therefore 200 kg - (40 \times 1 kg) = 200 kg - 40 kg = 160 kg $$

Therefore, $160$ kilograms of wheat won't be used."
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in Soda. Among them, we have:  • 8417 men (or boys)  • 9092 women (or girls)  So, the number of children (miuids) in Soda is equal to the total population minus the number of men and women. That is: $ Number of children = Total population - Men - Women $$ Number of children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092 $$ Number of children = 15277 $$ Therefore, there are approximately 15277 children or miuids living in Soda.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 cards. Then she collected three times that number, so in the second month, she had 60 cards (3 x 20). In the third month, she doubled her collection again, collecting twice as many cards as in the previous two months combined. Therefore, Elaine now has 120 cards (2 x 60).
Response:  We know that Editor A pays $0.05 per sentence and Editor B pays twice as much, or $0.10 per sentence. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both editors, he earns a total of $500 per week ($0.05 x 1000 sentences). So, Mark earns $500 per week in total.
"Response: 
1) In the morning, he receives 5 baldes of water, so he receives 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in total.
2) In the afternoon/evening, he receives 6 baldes of water, so he receives 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in total.
Therefore, he receives a total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water every day."
"Response:  If John earns $2000 per week and works all 52 weeks of the year (assuming a standard calendar year), his annual income is:

$2000/week x 52 weeks = $104,000/year

Now, let's consider the prize money. The question states that the prize has a monetary reward of $5000 and an increase in salary of 5%. So, the total value of the prize is:

$5000 + ($2000/week x 5%) = $5300

Therefore, the total amount of money John earned during the year is:

$104,000 + $5300 = $109,300

So, if John received the prize on the first day of the year, he would have earned $109,300 that year."
Response:  If Josie has 10 acres of vineyard and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then she has 10 x 5 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, then she produces 50 x 2 = 100 barrels of wine per year. Therefore, the answer is 100 barrels of wine per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carl had cheese every day for lunch and used two slices of cheese in each sandwich. So he used 14 slices (2 x 7) of cheese for lunch. Secondly, we know that Carl had eggs and cheese omelets three days a week, using one extra slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich. Therefore, he used an additional 3 slices (1 x 3 = 3) of cheese for omelets. Thirdly, we know that Carl made a large macaroni dish with cheese to last several meals, and used eight slices of cheese in it. Finally, we add up all these amounts to find out how many total slices of cheese Carl used: 14 + 3 + 8 = 25 slices of cheese.  Therefore, Carl used 25 slices of cheese throughout the week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens initially. So, she had in total 32 pens (22 + 10). Then, she bought 6 bags of blue pens containing 9 pens each, so she got 54 blue pens (6 x 9 = 54). Similarly, she bought 2 bags of red pens containing 6 pens each, so she got 12 red pens (2 x 6 = 12). Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has now is 32 + 54 + 12 = 108 pens.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the average of the first five tests scores given in the problem as follows:  Average = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 84.  Now, since Mr. Bert allows students to remove their lowest score from the calculation each semester, we can subtract the lowest score from the calculated average:  Lowest score = min(89, 71, 92, 100, 86) = 71. Therefore, the required score for Brinley in the sixth test is:  Score needed = 84 - 71 = 13.
Response:  Firstly, he rode his bike at least 5 times per week for 25 kilometers each time during four weeks, so in total he covered 4 x 25 = 100 kilometers. Then, he reduced to riding only twice a week but with longer distances of 60 kilometers each time, covering 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers more. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Michael is 100 + 120 = 220 kilometers.
Response:  We know that there are 25 bars of chocolate and 80 macarons in the bag. Each bar of chocolate weighs twice as much as each macaron, so if each bar of chocolate weighs 40 grams, then each macaron must weigh 20 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all the sweets in the bag is equal to the sum of the weights of all the chocolate bars plus the weights of all the macarons. Since there are 25 bars of chocolate with a weight of 40 g x 2 = 80 g per bar, and 80 macarons with a weight of 20 g per macaron, the total weight of all the sweets in the bag is 80 + 160 = 240 g. So, the weight of the bag of candy from Joe is approximately 240 grams.
Response:  On Monday, she bought 4 balls. On Tuesday, she bought 3 times more than on Monday, so she bought 12 balls (3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she bought 5 times more than on Tuesday, so she bought 60 balls (5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, in total, she bought 78 balls (4 + 12 + 60 = 78).
Response:  We know that vinte dúzias of cups cost $ 1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold for $ 6,000 each. So we can write an equation as follows:  Cost of 50 cups = Total cost of 30 plates - $ 1,200  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Cost of 50 cups = $ 3,800 - $ 1,200 = $ 2,600 per cup  Therefore, the cost of each cup is $ 2,600.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $10 before she starts taking care of children. Then, she earns $5 for each time she takes care of them four times, so she earns a total of $20. Next, she spends $30 on the new coat and $60 on two pairs of shoes ($20 x 3 = $60). So, her remaining balance after buying the coat and shoes is $20 - $60 = -$40. Therefore, Sara needs to cut the grass four times to have enough money to buy the coat and shoes.
Response:  If there are more white hens than red hens, then the total number of eggs produced by all the hens is greater than 42. So, we can say that the number of red hens is less than or equal to $ \frac{42}{3} = 14$. Therefore, Jerry has at least 14 red hens.
Response:  If he walks at 5 km/h, in one hour he will have walked $ \frac{ distance}{speed} = \frac {1,5 \times 6 miles}{5 km/h} = 30$ miles. So, in $ \frac{distance}{speed} = \frac {1,5 \times 6 miles}{5 km/h} = 30$ hours he will walk around the park.
Response:  On day 1, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. So, the number of customers she counted on day 2 was 100 + 50 = 150. Therefore, on day 3, the number of customers she counted was 150 + 50 = 200.  Thus, the answer is 200.
Response:  At first, both pools had the same amount of water (since they were emptying at the same rate). So, initially, the small pool had $x$ gallons of water, and the large pool had twice as much ($2x$) gallons of water. After 4 minutes, the small pool gained $4x$ gallons of water, while the large pool lost $4x$ gallons. Now, we know that the small pool has $x+4x=5x$ gallons of water, and the large pool has half of its original amount, which is $\frac{2x}{2}=x$ gallons. Therefore, the small pool now has $x$ gallons of water, and the large pool has $x$ gallons of water.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lori has after working for one hour. As she earns $8 per hour and works for one hour only, her income will be $8. Then, let's find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and belt. The total cost of the shoes and belt is $320 + $32 = $352. So, Lori needs to work for ( $352 / $8) = 44 hours to buy both items. Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt.
"Response:  We know that Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10%. So, she will have to pay $2200 in total. If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance after 12 months will be:
$2200 - ($165 x 12) = $835
So, the remaining balance of Janeth until then is $835."
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the vase and seven daisies more than roses in the vase. So, if we have x rose(s) in the vase, then we have 7x daisy(ies) in the vase too (since there are seven daisies more than roses). Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is x + 7x = 14 flowers.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet has half of Zack's age. So we can write an equation as follows:
Age of Adrian = 3 x Age of Harriet
Age of Harriet = Half of Zack's age
Now, if Harriet is 21 years old now, then in three years she will be 24 years old (since she will have aged 3 + 3 = 6 years). Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack will be:
Average age = (Age of Adrian + Age of Harriet + Age of Zack) / 3
= (3 x 21 + 24 +?) / 3
= 75 / 3
= 25
So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after three years is 25 years old."
"Response:  We know that Jojo did not score any points because it is stated in the problem that ""Jojo did not mark any points."" So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Total points = Naomi + Yuri + Brianna + Jojo

We are also given that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored 10 more than Naomi (i.e., 78 points). Additionally, Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi (i.e., 95 points). Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equation to solve for Jojo's score:

Total points = 68 + 78 + 95 + 0 = 231

So, Jojo scored 0 points or 0 + 231 = 231."
"Response: 
Leva 10 minutos para a Carmen resolver um cruciverba significa que she spent 10 minutes solving one crossword puzzle.
Leva 5 minutos para uma pessoa resolver um sudoku significa that it takes her 5 minutes to solve one Sudoku puzzle.
Since she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles in total, we can calculate how much time she spent on each type of game as follows:
Time spent on crossword puzzles = Total time spent on games / Number of crossword puzzles solved
= (10 + 5) / 3
= 7.67 minutes per crossword puzzle

Similarly, we can calculate the time she spent on Sudoku puzzles as follows:
Time spent on Sudoku puzzles = Total time spent on games / Number of Sudoku puzzles solved
= (10 + 5) / 8
= 6.25 minutes per Sudoku puzzle

Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, Carmen spent approximately 7.67 minutes per crossword puzzle and 6.25 minutes per Sudoku puzzle during the weekend."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, initially, there were 120 - 90 = 30 liters of water left in the tank. Then, she collected double the amount of rainwater, which is equal to 2 x 30 = 60 liters. Therefore, now there are 30 + 60 = 90 liters of water in the tank.
Response:  If Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 petunias, he will have a total of 90 + 40 = 130 flowers planted.
Response:  In year one, the company spends $15,000 in advertising. Then, in year two, it spends $\frac{1}{3}$ of that amount, which is $5,000. So, the total amount spent on advertising by the company over both years is: $$ Total = 15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000 $$ Therefore, the answer is $20,000.
Response:  If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and pays $30 per hour, he will pay $90 ($30 x 3).  If Benji uses the banana boat for 5 hours and pays $18 per hour, he will pay $90 ($18 x 5).  So in total, they will pay $180 ($90 + $90).
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half of those days are spent driving from New Jersey to Rochester, then it will take 3 days to drive from Rochester back to New Jersey. So, if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will spend 3 + 2 = 5 days on his trip.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many cards of each type James has before losing and buying any new ones.  From the question, we know that he has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water. So, the total number of cards he has is:

Total = 30 x Fire + 20 x Grass + 40 x Water = 130

Now, let's assume that after losing 8 cards of type water, he only has X cards left. Since he bought 14 cards of type grass, the total number of cards he now has is:

New Total = X + 14 = 154

Since he has a total of 154 cards, and he lost 8 cards of type water, the probability of drawing a card of type water when he picks one randomly from his remaining deck is:

Probability = Number of water cards / Total number of cards = 8/154 = 0.052

So, the percentage chance of drawing an aquatic card is approximately 5.2%."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of the basic burrito which is $6.50 + tax (let's assume it's 8% so it would be $0.52). Then, let's add the additional costs for each item he added: * Carne extra = $2.00 * Queijo extra = $1.00 * Abacate = $1.00 * Molho extra = $0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, the total cost of his upgraded burrito is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $9.00. Now, if he spent an additional $3.00 for the batatas fritas and drink, that brings the total cost to $9.00 + $3.00 = $12.00. Therefore, he still needs to pay $12.00 - $5.00 (the value of his gift card) = $7.00.
"Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place half of the total number of pieces per minute, then they will complete the puzzle in the following time:
Time = Total number of pieces / (Kalinda's rate + Mother's rate)
= 360 / (4 + (1/2))
= 360 / 5.5
= approximately 67 minutes
Therefore, it will take them approximately 67 minutes to complete the jigsaw puzzle."
Response:  After two months, 120 baby melons were produced and Ashlyn visited the farm to find that 30% of them were ready for harvesting. So, she took 30% of them home = 36 baby melons (since 30% of 120 is 36). When she returned after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvesting = 48 more baby melons ( since 3/4 of 96 is 48). Therefore, there are 84 baby melons left unharvested after two weeks = 84 - 36 = 48.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark buys 12 cars for his company. So, he pays 12 x 20,000 = 240,000 dollars for all of them. Then, he pays 10% of 240,000 = 24,000 dollars as taxes. Finally, he also pays 1000 dollars as registration fee for each car, which is 12 times 1000 = 12,000 dollars. Therefore, in total, Mark pays 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 dollars.
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she had 5 + 20 = 25 shells in total.  On Tuesday, Kylie doubled her collection from Monday, so she collected 25 x 2 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 ants and Dax found half of them, then there are 50/2 = 25 ants left. Since an ant can carry one mango seed, the number of mango seeds carried by all ants is equal to the number of ants multiplied by the number of mango seeds each ant can carry. Therefore, the total number of mango seeds carried by all ants is 25 x 1 = 25 mango seeds. So, the total number of insects (ants + other insects) in the garden is 25 +?, where? is the number of other insects that Dax did not find.
Response:  We know that 36 penguins are taking sunbathing in the snow.  A third of them (12 penguins) are puffed up and do not go to the ocean. Another third (12 penguins) enter the cave for lunch. So, how many penguins are still taking sunbathing? The answer is 12 penguins.
Response:  If Steve doubles his consumption of tomatoes and now consumes six per day, that means he consumes 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.  Since one cherry tomato plant can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes consumed by the number of plants required to produce them: 42 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes per week = 14 videiras (plants). Therefore, Steve needs 14 videiras (plants) to meet his daily demand for tomatoes.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend wants to have 4 slices of pizza. So, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many groups of 4 we can make: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, John needs to order 5 pizzas.
Response:  If he mixes the ink of five empty pens to fill one pen, then he will have 5/1 = 5 units of ink left after filling one pen.  If he buys 25 pens and uses them all up to make new pens when the ink runs out, then he will have used 25 x 5 = 125 units of ink in total. So, he will have 125 - 5 = 120 units of ink left over at the end. Therefore, he will have 120 canetsas in total.
Response:  If John deposited $20 and then added another $10, he had a total of $30. Then, if it tripled in one year, he would have $90 after one year. So, John had $90 after one year.
Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Joan is five years older than Mary. If Jessa is five years older than Joan, then Jessa is also five years older than Mary. Therefore, Jessa has an age of 25 (Joan + 5 = Jessa). Since Jessa has an age of 25 and she is three years younger than Mary, we can conclude that Mary has an age of 28 (Mary - 3 = Jessa). So, the sum of their ages is 28 + 25 + 19 = 62.
Response:  After the meeting, 30% of the students left through entrance A, so there are 700 students remaining (1000 - 30%). Then, 3/5 of the remaining students left through entrance B, which means that 600 students left through entrance B (3/5 x 700). Finally, the remaining students left through entrance C, so there are 200 students who left through entrance C (1000 - 600 - 600 = 200). Therefore, the number of students who left through entrance C is 200.
Response:  We know that James has more than 6 doces than Robert. So, if Robert has x doces, then James has x + 6 doces.  We also know that John has twice as many doces as Robert, so John has 2x doces.  Finally, we are told that Joao has 54 doces, which means he has 54 - x doces.  Now, we can set up an equation using these values:  James has x + 6 doces, John has 2x doces, and Joao has 54 - x doces.  Solving for x, we get:  x = 38. Therefore, Joao has 38 - x = 16 doces more than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they have three books to read. If they both read each other's books, they will have read a total of six books (two from Dolly + three from Pandora). So, the collective number of books they will have read at the end is six.
Response:  We know that there are five people who are friends with Mike and they exchange letters every week. Since Mike used to be a correspondent of two of them but no longer is, we can assume that he received 2 x 5 = 10 letters per week from these five people.  Now, each letter takes him 6 minutes to write, so in total, Mike spends 10 x 6 = 60 minutes per week writing letters. Therefore, he passes 60/60 = 1 hour per week writing letters.
Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 minutes per month and he uses 15 minutes of it for daily calls with his boss. So far so good! Now we need to calculate how many minutes he used for other people this month. He had 300 extra minutes, which means he spent 300/10 = 30 minutes more than usual. Therefore, Jason has left 970 minutes (1000 - 30) in his phone this month if there are 30 days in the month.
"Response:  We know that at first, Griffin had 24 french fries and then he received from Ginger a handful of fries (we don't know how many). Then, Kyle took 5 fries away from Griffin. After that, Billy gave Griffin twice as many fries as Kyle took (so 10 more fries). Finally, Colby took 3 fewer fries than what Kyle took (so -3 fries). So, in total, Griffin gained 10 + (-3) = 7 additional fries. Therefore, after all these events, Griffin had 27 fries in total. Now, let's calculate how many fries Ginger gave to Griffin: since Ginger gave a ""handful"" of fries, we can assume that she gave an amount equal to half of the original number of fries that Griffin had (since a handful is roughly half a cup). So, if Griffin initially had 24 fries, then Ginger gave him half of that amount, which is 12 fries."
Response:  We know that there are 4 crabs in one aquarium and 32 crabs in another aquarium. If we call the number of crabs in the first aquarium x, then the number of crabs in the second aquarium is twice that amount, or 2x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is equal. So, if x is the number of fish in the first aquarium, the number of fish in the second aquarium is 2x. Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is x/2.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jean pays for each hour of makeup work. According to the question, the maquilhadora charges $250 per hour. Therefore, Jean pays $250 x 6 hours = $1,500 per day for makeup work. Since she needs to do this four times a week, her total weekly cost for makeup work is $1,500 x 4 weeks = $6,000. Now, let's calculate the total amount that Jean pays for all five weeks of filming. Her total cost for makeup work is $6,000 + (6 x $250) = $6,750. Finally, since the maquiador gives Jean a discount of 10%, her actual payment will be $6,750 - ($6,750 x 10%) = $6,085. So, Jean paid $6,085 for the entire five-week filming process.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Isabella spent $12 on ingredients for the birthday cake, which means she paid $12 / 3 = $4 per person (since there are three people in total). Secondly, she spent $43 on presents, which means she paid $43 / 3 = $14 per person. Thirdly, she spent $15 on decorations, which means she paid $15 / 3 = $5 per person. Fourthly, she spent $4 on invitations, which means she paid $4 / 3 = $1.33 per person. Finally, she spent $22 on gifts for the guests, which means she paid $22 / 3 = $7.67 per person. Therefore, each person paid $4 + $14 + $5 + $1.33 + $7.67 = $30.98 towards the cost of the party.
Response:  The number of bags of onions is given as 4. Each bag weighs 50 kg, so the total weight of all the bags is 4 x 50 = 200 kg. Since each kilogram of onion costs $1.50, the total cost of all the onions is 200 kg x $1.50/kg = $300. So, the chef spent $300 on the onions.
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate four times more cookies than her sister. So if her sister ate x cookies, Sue ate 4x cookies. Then, on Tuesday, Sue doubled the number of cookies she ate compared to her sister. So if her sister ate x cookies again, Sue ate 2x cookies. Now we know that the total number of cookies Sue ate is 4x + 2x = 6x cookies. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 6x x 200 = 1200 calories more than her sister. Therefore, the difference in calories between what Sue and her sister consumed is 1200 calories.
