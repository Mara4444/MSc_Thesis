"Response:  The value of the house is $ 80,000 and the land is worth $ 50,000. If we increase the value of the house by 150%, then the new value of the house will be:

$ 80,000 x 150% = $ 120,000

So, the new value of the house after increasing it by 150% is $ 120,000."
Response:  The distance covered in one sprint is given as 60 meters. Since there are 3 sprints per week, the total distance covered in one week will be 3 x 60 = 180 meters. So, the total distance covered in 3 weeks will be 180 + 180 + 180 = 540 meters.
"Response:  If Wendi eats 15 bowls of rice and vegetables mixed with chicken broth, and then she has another 25 bowls of food that is not mixed with chicken broth, if we calculate the total amount of food consumed based on the size of each bowl (which is 300 grams), then the total amount of food consumed would be:
Total amount = Number of bowls x Amount per bowl
= 15 x 300 grams
+ 25 x 300 grams
= 4500 grams + 750 grams
= 5250 grams
Therefore, the total amount of food consumed by Wendi is approximately 5250 grams."
Response:  The total cost of 16 glasses is 16 x $ 5 = $ 80. Since there is a discount of 60%, we will apply it to the total amount paid, which is $ 80 - (60% of $ 80) = $ 80 - $ 48 = $ 32. So Kylar has to pay $ 32 for the 16 glasses.
"Response:  We have three cities - Toulouse (France), Charleston (US), and Seattle (US). Each city has a different number of days in a week, which are as follows:
Toulouse - 5 days
Charleston - 7 days
Seattle - 7 days
Now, we need to find out how many weeks each city has. To do this, we divide the number of days in a week by 7. Here are the results:
Toulouse - 5 / 7 = 0.7143 (almost 1 week)
Charleston - 7 / 7 = 1 (one week)
Seattle - 7 / 7 = 1 (one week)
So, based on the information provided, the answer is 20 weeks."
Response:  The speed of downloading is given as 2 GB/minute, which means that in one minute, 2 GB will be downloaded. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total amount of data downloaded in one hour as follows: Total Data Downloaded = (2 GB/min) x (60 min/hour) = 120 GB per hour Now, let's find out how many hours it would take to download 200 GB of data. We know that the speed of downloading is constant throughout the process, so we can use the formula: Time Taken = Total Amount of Data / Download Speed = 200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes To summarize, it would take approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes to download 200 GB of data at a rate of 2 GB per minute.
"Response:  The first part of the journey took 2 hours at a speed of 60 mph (1 hour = 60 minutes). Therefore, the distance traveled during this period was:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
The second part of the journey lasted for 4 hours at a speed of 30 mph (1 hour = 60 minutes), so the distance covered during this time was:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 4 hours = 120 miles
Adding both distances gives us the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2 = 120 miles + 120 miles = 240 miles
Therefore, the answer to the question is 240 miles."
"Response:  If Eliza works for 40 hours per week and her regular hourly wage is $10, then her total weekly earnings are:

$10/hour x 40 hours/week = $400/week

Now, if she takes 1.2 days of leave with pay, her total weekly earnings will be:

$400/week - ($10/hour x 1.2 days) = $360/week

So, Eliza's weekly earnings after taking 1.2 days of leave with pay are $360."
Response:  The number of downloads for Sasi Kapindu's program is given as 60. If we assume that each download reduces the remaining amount of the program by 30%, then after 20 downloads (i.e., 60 / 0.3 = 20), the remaining amount will be 40%. Therefore, after 30 downloads (i.e., 20 + 10 = 30), the remaining amount will be 20%. So, the total number of downloads required to reduce the program to zero is 30.
Response:  The total cost of 3 dozen donuts is $68, and each dozen costs $5. So, the cost of 1 doz... (view)
Response:  We have to calculate how much money we can save with each lemon and then multiply it by the number of lemons available. So, if we buy 7 lemons, we will save $ 1.5 per lemon. Therefore, the total amount saved would be $ 1.5 x 7 = $ 10.5. Since there are 3 lemons left after using them for cooking, the remaining amount would be $ 10.5 / 3 = $ 3.5.
"Response:  The information given in the question are as follows:
Melanie has 3 dogs and 2 cats at home. She also has a vacuum cleaner that can clean one third of her house every day. In addition to this, she has 5 machines for cleaning the whole house. So, we need to calculate how much space each machine will cover in one day.
The size of Melanie's house is 100 square meters (as mentioned in the question). Now, let's assume that each machine can clean 20 square meters per day (this is just an estimate, as it may vary depending on the type and capacity of the machine). Therefore, if Melanie uses all 5 machines simultaneously, they will be able to clean 100 square meters / 5 = 20 square meters per day.
So, the answer to the question is 20 square meters."
"Response:  According to the question, there are 20 students in total and they will perform different dance styles as follows:
* 20% of them (4 students) will perform contemporary dance.
* 25% of them (5 students) will perform jazz dance.
* The remaining 55% (11 students) will perform hip-hop dance.
Now, let's calculate the percentage of students who will perform hip-hop dance:
Percentage = Total number of students performing hip-hop dance / Total number of students x 100
= 11 students / 20 students x 100
= 55%
Therefore, 55% of the 20 students will perform hip-hop dance."
Response:  If we calculate the profit from each sale, we can see that for every $5,000 worth of jewelry sold, the profit is $125 (2.5% of $5,000). For every $8,000 worth of electronic devices sold, the profit is $96 (1.2% of $8,000). So if the trader wants to maximize their profits, they should sell more electronic devices than jewelry. Specifically, they should sell 3.7 times as many electronic devices as jewelry ($8,000 / $5,000 = 3.7). Therefore, the trader should choose to sell mostly electronic devices and only some jewelry.
Response:  The distance between San Rafael and the school is 30 miles (waktu sing padha). To get to the school from San Rafael, it takes about 4 hours (lelungan menyang sisih kulon) at an average speed of 60 mph (loro-lorone lelungan). Therefore, the total distance traveled is 240 miles (dina candhake), which includes both the initial distance from San Rafael and the return trip. So, the round-trip distance is 480 miles (nutupi jarak).
"Response: 
Jill works for 50 weeks per year (assuming a standard working week of 4 days).
She spends 35 hours per week as a teacher and 15 hours per week as a coach.
So her total work hours per year are:
35 x 50 = 1750 hours (as a teacher)
15 x 50 = 750 hours (as a coach)
Total work hours per year = 1750 + 750 = 2500 hours
Now we need to calculate her monthly salary based on the number of hours she works per year.
Let's assume that Jill is paid an hourly rate of $20.
Monthly salary = Total work hours / Hourly rate
= 2500 hours / $20/hour
= $125,000 per year ($2500 hours x $20/hour)
Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $125,000."
"Response:  If Claire makes 3 eggs per day and she has been making them for 4 weeks, then the total number of eggs she made is:
3 x 21 days = 63 eggs
So, in 4 weeks, Claire made approximately 63 eggs."
Response:  The distance traveled in 1 hour and 4 miles is equal to 4 x 60 = 240 minutes. Therefore, the average speed for the first leg of the journey was 4 miles / 240 minutes = 16 km/hr. For the second leg of the journey, the distance traveled in 1 hour and 2 miles is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Therefore, the average speed for the second leg of the journey was 2 miles / 120 minutes = 8 km/hr. Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled during both legs of the journey: Total Distance = First Leg + Second Leg = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles. Finally, to find out how many hours it took to travel that distance at the average speed of 8 km/hr, we can divide the total distance by the average speed: Hours Taken = Total Distance / Average Speed = 6 miles / 8 km/hr = 75 minutes or 1 hour and 15 minutes. So, the answer is 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how much water was poured into the container initially. From the question, we know that 10 liters of water were poured in at first. Then, we need to find out how many liters of water were spilled during the process. According to the question, 3 liters of water were spilled. Finally, we need to subtract the amount of water spilled from the total initial quantity of water to get the remaining water after the process. So, the answer is: 10 - 3 = 7 liters of water remained in the container after the process.
Response:  We know that Raymond is 23 years old and Samantha is 31 years old. So, if they got married when Raymond was 20 years old (which means he was born in 1997), then Samantha would have been born in either 1984 or 1985. Therefore, Samantha is either 37 or 38 years old now.

The third customer bought four DVDs (wong loro sing dadi pelanggan sabanjur√© tuku rong DVD). And the fourth customer bought five DVDs (telung pelanggan pungkasanora tuku DVD). So, in total, Billy sold 8 x 5 = 40 DVDs to his customers on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  The distance traveled by the car is given as 2 meters per second squared. Since there are 60 seconds in an hour, we can calculate the total distance traveled as follows: Distance = Speed x Time = 2 m/s^2 x 60 s = 120 meters. So, the car travels 120 meters from 1 to 5 pm.
Response:  The original price of the book is $ 19.50 and there is a discount of 25%. So we need to calculate the amount of discount first. Discount = Original Price x Discount Percentage = $ 19.50 x 25% = $ 4.875 Now, let's find out how much the book costs after applying the discount. Cost After Discount = Original Price - Discount = $ 19.50 - $ 4.875 = $ 14.625 Therefore, the cost of the book after applying the discount is $ 14.625.
Response:  The cost of one pack of rice is $ 12.50 and there are four apples for $ 1.50 each. So the total amount paid by Marie was $ 50. If she bought a whole pizza that costs $ 8.50 per slice, then how many slices did she buy?  Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50, and the cost of one pair of pants is $22.50. Therefore, the total cost of three pairs of shorts would be $16.50 x 3 = $49.50. Similarly, the total cost of three pairs of pants would be $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. Finally, the total cost of three pairs of shoes would be $42 x 3 = $126. So, the total amount that Mishka has to pay for all three items is $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 80 miles."
Response:  The cost of one pair of shoes is Rp 50,000 and the cost of each additional shoe is Rp 10,000. If we buy three pairs of shoes, the total cost will be Rp 150,000 (Rp 50,000 x 3). Now, if we want to know how much money we can save by buying boots instead of shoes, let's calculate the cost of three pairs of boots. Each pair of boots costs Rp 200,000, so the total cost of three pairs of boots will be Rp 600,000 (Rp 200,000 x 3). Therefore, by buying boots instead of shoes, we can save Rp 950,000 (Rp 600,000 - Rp 500,000).
"Response:  The ratio of Umer's age to Allen's age is 7:1. So if Umer's age is x years, then Allen's age is 7x years. Since Umer is 162 years old and Allen is 10 years younger than him, we can write:

Umer's age = 162
Allen's age = 7x
Substituting x = 162, we get:
Allen's age = 1104
Therefore, Allen is 1104 years old."
"Response:  We have 80 jelly beans in total and we want to know how much they weigh together. The first jar contains 20 jelly beans that are half as heavy as the whole jar (sing sepisanan). So, if we calculate the weight of each jelly bean in the first jar, it would be: 
Weight of one jelly bean = Total weight of the jar / Number of jelly beans in the jar x 100
= 80/20 x 100 = 400 grams
Now, let's move on to the second jar. Since it contains 60 jelly beans, their combined weight is also half as heavy as the whole jar (sing sepisanan):
Weight of one jelly bean = Total weight of the jar / Number of jelly beans in the jar x 100
= 80/60 x 100 = 333 grams
So, the average weight of all 80 jelly beans is:
Average weight of all jelly beans = Sum of weights of all jelly beans / Total number of jelly beans
= 400 + 333 = 733 grams
Therefore, the approximate ratio of the weight of the first jar to the weight of the second jar is:
Ratio of weight of first jar to weight of second jar = Weight of first jar / Weight of second jar
= 80/60 = 1.33
So, the approximate ratio of the weight of the first jar to the weight of the second jar is 1.33."
Response:  The number of days in one week is 7, so if John works for 10 weeks (as stated), he will work for 70 days (10 x 7 = 70). Now, let's calculate how many hours John works per day based on his statement that he works from 9 am to 5 pm and has lunch break from 12 pm to 1 pm. Therefore, John works for 8 hours per day (from 9 am to 5 pm - 1 hour for lunch break). So, the total number of working hours for John in one week is 8 x 70 = 560 hours.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and she gave 30 of them to her friend. So, Gretchen has 80 coins left (110 - 30 = 80). Now, we are asked how many coins Gretchen has after giving 20 more coins to her friend. Therefore, Gretchen gives 20 + 30 = 50 coins to her friend, so now Gretchen has 80 - 50 = 30 coins left.
Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 precious stones and half of them are as many as Raymond had. So, if Raymond had 40 precious stones, then Aaron has 40/2 = 20 precious stones. Therefore, Siobhan has 30 - 20 = 10 precious stones.

Response:  We have to find out how many sets of 8 games videos can be purchased with $ 50. So we divide $ 50 by $ 20 (the cost of each game video) and get 2.5 sets. Since you cannot buy a fraction of a set, we round up to the nearest whole number which is 3 sets. Therefore, the answer is 3 sets.
Response:  We know that John has worked for 60 days (minggu). In one day, he works for 8 hours (jam), so in total, he has worked for 60 x 8 = 480 hours. Now, we are told that Dewey can write 3 pages in half an hour (dina). So, in half an hour, Dewey can write 3 / 2 = 1.5 pages. Therefore, in one day, Dewey can write 480 / 2 = 240 pages.
Response:  The speed of the car is 3 miles per hour, and it takes 10 minutes to cover one mile. Therefore, in 10 minutes, the distance covered will be 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Now, if the car accelerates from rest to 30 miles per hour in 5 seconds (as stated in the problem), its acceleration will be 30 / 5 = 6 miles per hour squared. So, the force required to produce this acceleration can be calculated as F = ma, where m is the mass of the car and a is its acceleration. Since the mass of the car is not given, let's assume an average value for a passenger car, which is around 1500 kg or 1.5 tons. Then, plugging in these values into the equation above, we get F = 1.5 x 6^2 = 900 N.
Response:  We know that iPhone Ben is older than iPhone Suzy because he has more wrinkles and gray hair. If we assume that one year of aging for an iPhone is equivalent to two years of human aging (which might be a rough estimate), then iPhone Ben would be around 4-5 years old if he was created in 2018. Therefore, the difference between their ages would be approximately 3-4 years, which means that iPhone Suzy is around 1-2 years younger than iPhone Ben.
Response:  The distance between Polly and the gold bar is 1000 feet (305 meters). To reach the gold bar, Polly needs to throw his spear at least 400 feet (122 meters) away from him. If he throws it that far, he will hit the dragon. However, if he only throws it 200 feet (61 meters), he won't be able to hit the dragon because of its size. So, the maximum distance Polly can throw his spear to hit the dragon is 400 feet (122 meters).
Response:  We have 5 pieces of cake (nggoreng) and we want to cut them into equal portions for our guests. Each guest will get 2 pieces of cake (didi). So, how many pieces of cake will each guest get in total? That's right! Each guest will get 4 pieces of cake (irisan).

Response:  We know that one liter of gasoline weighs approximately 0.8 kg (kilograms). So if we want to calculate how many liters of gasoline can be obtained from 10 kg, we need to divide 10 kg by 0.8 kg/liter. This gives us an approximate value of 12.5 liters of gasoline that can be obtained from 10 kg. Now let's assume that each liter of gasoline costs $ 10.00 in terms of supply and demand. Therefore, the total cost of obtaining 12.5 liters of gasoline would be $ 10 x 12.5 = $ 125.00. If we subtract $ 2.00 for each liter of gasoline, then the remaining amount after deducting $ 2.00 per liter would be $ 123.00. Therefore, the answer is $ 123.00.

So, Lloyd earned $3024 from the eggs in one week."
Response:  The speed of the boat is 10 miles per hour (mph) and it travels for 4 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled by the boat is: Distance = Speed x Time = 10 mph x 4 h = 40 miles. Now, let's convert this distance to kilometers: Distance in km = Distance in miles x Conversion factor = 40 miles x 1.60934 kilometers/mile = 64.05 kilometers. So, the distance traveled by the boat from Bali to Lombok is approximately 64.05 kilometers.
"Response:  The total number of books in the bag is 30 (as stated in the question). Now, let's calculate the number of comic books based on the information provided:

* The weight of one comic book is 1/4 pon (or 25 grams) as mentioned in the question.
* The weight of 15 comic books is 15 x 1/4 = 3.75 pon (or 26.25 grams).
* The weight of 30 comic books is 30 x 3.75 = 106.25 pon (or 705 grams).

Therefore, if you have 30 comic books and each weighs approximately 106.25 pon, then the total weight of all the books in the bag would be around 106.25 + 106.25 +... + 106.25 = 30 x 106.25 = 3187.5 pon or approximately 2190 grams."
Response:  On Monday (Kemis), the mechanic repairs 6 trucks and earns $ 60 x 6 = $ 360. On Friday (Jum'at), the mechanic repairs 12 cars and earns $ 40 x 12 = $ 480. Therefore, the total income of the mechanic for the week is $ 360 + $ 480 = $ 840.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many kittens were adopted from the local shelter. According to the question, there are 7 kittens who were adopted. Next, we need to calculate the number of kittens that were not adopted. From the question, it is mentioned that 5 kittens did not get adopted. Therefore, the total number of kittens that were not adopted is 5. Finally, we can calculate the percentage of kittens that were adopted by dividing the number of kittens that were adopted by the total number of kittens available for adoption (7 + 5 = 12). So, the percentage of kittens that were adopted is 50% (12/22 x 100%).
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 pieces of rubber bands and he gives 2 to Kanthi. So, Jean now has 30 - 2 = 28 rubber bands left. Then, Kanthi takes one of Jean's rubber bands, so now Jean has 28 - 1 = 27 rubber bands left. Therefore, the number of rubber bands left with Jean after Kanthi took one is 27.
Response:  The price of one ticket for Wayang Kulit show is IDR 70,000 (IDR 7 x 10,000). If we want to watch it twice in one week, we need to pay twice that amount, which is IDR 140,000 (IDR 70,000 x 2). Now, if we buy two tickets and a bag of popcorn each, the total cost would be IDR 280,000 (IDR 140,000 + IDR 140,000). So, the answer is IDR 280,000.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total weight of the wood that can be carried by the truck. The weight of each plank is 15 pon and there are 5000 planks in total, so the total weight of the wood is:

5000 x 15 = 75,000 pon

Next, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the truck itself from the total weight of the wood. The driver weighs 60 pon and the truck weighs 20 pon, so the total weight of the driver and truck is:

60 + 20 = 80 pon

Now, let's check if the truck can carry the maximum load allowed by the bridge. According to the question, the maximum load allowed by the bridge is 3755 pon. So, we can compare the total weight of the wood with the maximum load allowed by the bridge:

75,000 - 80 = 45,920 pon < 3755 pon

Therefore, the maximum number of planks that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the maximum load allowed by the bridge is:

45,920 / 5000 = 9.18 planks per trip

So, the answer to the question is 9 planks per trip."

So, the total amount of raspberries consumed is 360 raspberries."
"Response:  The total amount of water is 25 liters and it takes 1 hour to boil at room temperature (37¬∞C). So, the volume of water that will be in the pot after 1 hour is:

Volume of water = Total amount of water / Time taken to boil
= 25 L / 1 h
= 25 L/h

Now, we need to calculate the rate at which the water is heating up. We know that the temperature increases by 20¬∞C per hour, so the increase in temperature can be calculated as follows:

Temperature increase = Final temperature - Initial temperature
= 100¬∞C - 37¬∞C
= 63¬∞C/h

Finally, we need to find out how much time it will take for the water to reach the desired temperature of 100¬∞C. To do this, we can use the formula:

Time = Temperature increase / Rate of heating
= 63¬∞C/h / 25 L/h
= 2.5 hours

So, it will take approximately 2.5 hours for the water to reach the desired temperature of 100¬∞C if it is initially at room temperature (37¬∞C) and the heat source is able to raise the temperature by 20¬∞C per hour."
Response:  The total cost of the goods is $ 500 + $ 320 = $ 820. If we deduct the insurance premium of 10%, it will be $ 744 ( $ 820 x 10%). So, the amount that needs to be paid is $ 744.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Yen has worked for in his entire career, which is 40 years. Then, we multiply it by the percentage of the retirement benefit he is entitled to receive, which is 5%. Finally, we subtract the amount of money he received as a bonus after working for 20 years, which is $10,000. Therefore, the final calculation is: Total Amount = (Total Worked Years x Percentage) - Bonus Received. So, the answer is: Total Amount = (40 x 5%) - $10,000 = $200,000.
"Response:  The amount of money that Aleena pays for the streaming service every month is $ 140. If the company reduces the price of its subscription by 10% in half a year, then the new price will be:

$ 140 x (1 - 0.10) = $ 126

So, the amount of money that Aleena pays for the streaming service after the reduction is $ 126."
Response:  If Sophia fills up her car with 100 miles of gasoline and she can drive for 4 gallons of gasoline per mile, then she will need 100/4 = 25 gallons of gasoline to travel 100 miles. Since the book manual recommends filling up the tank with 12 gallons of gasoline, it means that Sophia has enough fuel to travel 100 miles / 25 gallons = 4 times. Therefore, Sophia can drive her car for 4 times 100 miles = 400 miles before running out of gasoline.

Response:  If Tommy made 43 brownies and 23 cheesecakes, then he has a total of 66 baked goods (43 + 23 = 66). Now, if each brownie costs $3 and each cheesecake costs $4, then the total cost of all the baked goods is: $66 x $3 = $198 for the brownies and $66 x $4 = $264 for the cheesecakes. So, the total cost of all the baked goods is $198 + $264 = $462.
Response:  The total cost of five phones is $ 750 (5 x $ 150). If Sheila pays in installments over three months with an interest rate of 2%, then her monthly payment will be calculated as follows: Monthly Payment = Total Cost / Number of Installments x Interest Rate x Time Period In this case, the time period is 3 months, so we can calculate the monthly payment as follows: Monthly Payment = $ 750 / 3 x 2% x 3 = $ 68.33 Therefore, Sheila will pay $ 68.33 per month for three months to buy five phones at a discount of 2%.
Response:  If Artie buys 12 pots of marigolds at $2.74 per pot, he will spend $31.88 (12 x $2.74). For petunias, if he buys 9 pots at $1.87 per pot, he will spend $16.53 (9 x $1.87). And for begonias, if he buys 17 pots at $2.12 per pot, he will spend $35.04 (17 x $2.12). So, in total, Artie will spend $72.45 ($31.88 + $16.53 + $35.04)
Response:  The castle has 5 floors (levels) above ground level, and each floor is 2 meters high. So, the total height of the castle is: 5 x 2 = 10 meters. Now, let's calculate the area of each floor: Area of each floor = length x width = 16 x 8 = 128 square meters. Therefore, the ratio of the area of each floor to the height of the castle is: Ratio = Area / Height = 128 / 10 = 12.8 square meters per meter of height.
Response:  The doctor said that Cecilia needs to drink at least 1 can of water every hour until she finishes all 4 cans (or 480 ml) in total. So, if it takes her 1 hour to finish 1 can of water (or 110 ml), then it will take her x hours to finish all 4 cans. Therefore, we can write an equation: x = 4 / 110 = 36 hours.

"Response:  The company pays its employees $ 600 in salaries every month. According to the company's policy, the salary will increase by 10% each year starting from the first year of service. Sylvie has been working for the company for 5 years since December, so her annual salary is calculated as follows:
Year 1: Salary = $ 600 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $ 660
Year 2: Salary = $ 660 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $ 728
Year 3: Salary = $ 728 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $ 804
Year 4: Salary = $ 804 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $ 885
Year 5: Salary = $ 885 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $ 966
Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary at the end of 5 years is $ 966."
Response:  The album contains 12 songs and each song has an average duration of 4 minutes. Therefore, the total duration of all songs in the album is 12 x 4 = 48 minutes. Now, we know that Harald listened to the album for 88,000 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, we can convert 88,000 seconds to minutes as follows: 88,000 / 60 = 1,450 minutes. So, Harald listened to the album for 1,450 minutes.
Response:  We have 75 guests invited to the party and each guest will receive a gift worth $ 2. Since there are 16 cannons in total, we need to divide the total value of gifts by the number of cannons to find out how much each cannon costs. Therefore, the cost of each cannon is $ 2 / 16 = $ 0.13.
Response:  We know that there are 20 adults and 5 children attending the picnic. If each adult eats half a kilogram of potato salad (since they will eat 10 portions), then the total amount of potato salad consumed by the adults is 20 x 0.5 = 10 kg. Since there are 5 children, they will also consume some portion of the remaining 10 kg of potato salad. So, the total amount of potato salad consumed at the picnic is 10 kg + 5 kg = 15 kg.
"Response:  We have three people - Jan, Marcia and Cindy. Each of them has a friend who is also their enemy. So, we can say that each person has two enemies (one friend and one enemy). Now, let's count how many people they are in total:
Jan has an enemy named Marcia, so there is one more person in this group.
Marcia has an enemy named Cindy, so there is another person in this group.
Cindy has an enemy named Jan, so there is one more person in this group.
So, in total, there are 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 people in this situation."
Response:  We know that Amy is 6 years older than Jenny (Amy = Jenny + 6). Since Amy is 30 years old and Jenny is 24 years old, we can calculate their age difference as follows: Amy - Jenny = 6 + 24 = 30. So, Amy is 30 years old. Now, let's find out how many years have passed since James was born: James - Amy = 10 - 30 = -20 years. Therefore, James is 20 years old.
Response:  The distance traveled by Lee in 38 seconds is 38/60 = 0.64 km. Since Gerald took 10% longer to cover the same distance, he will take 0.64 x 1.10 = 0.672 km to complete it. Therefore, the time taken by Gerald to cover the distance of 400 meters is 0.672 km / 400 m = 1.68 minutes (or 1 minute and 6.8 seconds).
Response:  If there are 120 rabbits and each rabbit produces 60 droppings per day, then the total number of droppings produced by all rabbits is 120 x 60 = 7200 droppings per day. However, if we consider that only half of these droppings (3600) end up in the environment, then the actual amount of feces polluting the environment is 3600.
Response:  The number of boys in class 5 is 200 and out of them, 2/5 are interested in joining scouting, which means 40 boys (2/5 x 200). Now, among these 40 boys, 2/3 are willing to participate in the scouting program, which means 13 boys (2/3 x 40) will join the scouting program. Therefore, the final answer is 13 boys will join the scouting program.
Response:  We know that Harry works for 9 hours and James works for 2/3 of Harry's time. So, if Harry worked for x hours, then James worked for (2/3)x hours. Now we need to find out how many hours Harry worked in total. Therefore, the answer is: x + (2/3)x = 9. Simplifying the equation gives us: 3x = 9. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us: x = 3. So, Harry worked for 3 hours in total.
Response:  We know that Nalika has 16 ons of tomato sauce and she wants to make half of it into ketchup. So, she needs 8 ons of ketchup. Now, we are given that Freda can make 32 ons of ketchup from 1 ons of tomato puree. Therefore, Freda will need 31 ons of tomato puree to make 32 ons of ketchup. Since Nalika has only 16 ons of tomato sauce, Freda cannot make all of the ketchup needed.
Response:  The total number of cars in the traffic jam is 30. In 15 minutes, 20 cars move forward and 5 cars are stuck in the backlog. To calculate the average speed of all cars during this time, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. So, if the distance traveled by each car is x meters, then the average speed of all cars can be calculated as follows: Average Speed = Distance / Time Taken = x / 15 minutes = x/90 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in one minute, we can convert the above equation into miles per hour as follows: Average Speed (in mph) = Total Distance / Time Taken = x / 90 seconds x 60 seconds/minute = x / 5400 seconds. Now, let's find out how many cars were moving at any given moment. If there are n cars moving at any given moment, their total distance covered in that time can be calculated as follows: Total Distance Covered = Number of Cars x Distance Traveled per Car = n x x = nx. Similarly, the total time taken by these cars to cover this distance can be calculated as follows: Total Time Taken = Number of Cars x Time Taken per Car = n x 15 minutes = n(900 seconds). Therefore, the ratio of the number of cars moving to the number of cars stuck in the traffic jam at any given moment can be calculated as follows: Ratio of Moving Cars to Stuck Cars = Number of Moving Cars / Number of Stuck Cars = n / (n - 5) = 25 / 25 = 1. Therefore, there are 25 cars moving and 5 cars stuck in the traffic jam at any given moment.
Response:  The number of windows in the house is 40, and each window has 3 panes (ledges). Therefore, the total number of panes in the house is 40 x 3 = 120. Now, let's count how many pots can fit on each ledge. Each pot can hold up to 5 cups of rice, so we need to divide the total capacity of each ledge by 5 to find out how many pots can fit. In this case, each ledge can hold up to 120 / 5 = 24 pots. Since there are 24 pots in total, the answer is 24.
Response:  We know that there are 20 strokes in one quarter of a circle (360 degrees / 4 = 90 degrees). So, if we divide 360 degrees by 90 degrees (the number of strokes in one quarter), we get 4. Therefore, the number of times the pencil will touch the paper is 4 x 60 = 240 times.
Response:  The total number of books is 39 (4 x 10 = 40). Since there are 15 books in each batch, the number of batches can be calculated as follows: 39 / 15 = 2.6 (round down to 2 batches). Therefore, the number of books in each batch is 2 x 15 = 30 books.
Response:  We know that John works for 5 days in a week and he takes off every Saturday and Sunday. So, if it is Monday of this week, then John has worked for 4 days (Monday to Thursday). Therefore, the number of days since John started working is 4 + 1 = 5 days.
Response:  The distance from Kuta to Sambar is 3 miles (nutupi) and it takes 10 minutes to reach there. From Sambar to Pinggir Segara, it takes 42 miles (pinggir). So, if you start walking at 9 am from Kuta, you will arrive at Pinggir Segara at 9:10 am.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pieces of paper can fit in one stack and then calculate how many stacks we need to make 1000 pieces of paper.
Let's assume that each piece of paper takes up 1/4th of the height of the box (since there are 4 sides to a square). So, if the height of the box is x, then each piece of paper will take up x/4.
Now, let's calculate the volume of one stack of papers: Volume = Number of pieces \* Area of each piece / Height of the box
Volume = 1000 \* (x/4) / x = 250
So, we need 250 stacks of papers to make 1000 pieces."
Response:  If Cody has taken 3 cookies from the plate of 10 cookies, then there are 7 cookies left on the plate. If Amir takes 5 more cookies, then there will be 2 cookies left on the plate (since 5 + 3 = 8). So, the final number of cookies left on the plate is 2.
Response:  The total volume of water in three pots is equal to the sum of their volumes. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Volume = Pot 1 + Pot 2 + Pot 3. Now let's calculate each pot's volume separately based on the information given in the problem: Pot 1 contains 6 inches of water, which means its volume (V) is equal to 6 x œÄ x radius^2, where radius is half the diameter of the pot. Since the diameter of the pot is 8 inches, the radius is 4 inches. Therefore, V1 = 6 x œÄ x (4)^2 = 96 cubic inches. Similarly, for Pot 2, V2 = 5 x œÄ x (6)^2 = 704 cubic inches. And for Pot 3, V3 = 4 x œÄ x (8)^2 = 1152 cubic inches. Finally, adding all these volumes gives us the total volume of water in the three pots: Total Volume = V1 + V2 + V3 = 96 + 704 + 1152 = 2052 cubic inches.

Therefore, Henry has 7 packages of biscuits.
Response:  The cost of one gallon of gas at the local station is $3.00 per gallon. The company offers a discount of $0.20 per gallon for using their app. If Wong buys 10 gallons of gas, he will save $2.00 in total (10 x $0.20 = $2.00). So, his final cost for 10 gallons of gas would be $3.00 - $2.00 = $1.00.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Beatrice can make a mistake and still be ahead of Marcell. To do this, we need to divide the number of mistakes that Beatrice makes (24) by the number of mistakes that Marcell makes (3). So, Beatrice can make 8 more mistakes than Marcell before she falls behind. Therefore, the ratio of their mistakes is 24/3 = 8.
"Response:  The distance from the shore to where Julia is swimming is 20 meters (ngrayu) and she has been swimming for 15 minutes (detik). Since there are 60 seconds in one minute, we can convert the time into seconds as follows:

15 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 900 seconds

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by Julia during this time:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 20 meters/second x 900 seconds
= 18,000 meters

Therefore, Julia has traveled approximately 18 kilometers (or 18,000 meters) while swimming along the coastline."

"Response: 
Jamal can take 6 pictures of Brittany every second with his phone. This means he can take 6 x 3 = 18 pictures in one minute.
Since there are 50 seconds in a minute, Jamal can take 18 x 50 = 900 pictures of Brittany in one minute.
Now, let's calculate how many pictures Jamal can take of the baby bebek in one minute. Since each picture takes 1/6th of a second to take, Jamal can take 6 x 6 = 36 pictures of the baby bebek in one minute.
Therefore, the answer is 900 - 36 = 864 pictures that Jamal can take of the baby bebek in one minute."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of all the wood pieces that Sasha has bought. The calculation is as follows:

Total cost = Number of pieces x Price per piece
= 50 x $ 10
= $ 500

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the wood pieces that Sasha has sold. The calculation is as follows:

Total cost = Number of pieces x Price per piece
= 10 x $ 16
= $ 160

So, the difference between the total cost of the wood pieces that Sasha has bought and the total cost of the wood pieces that she has sold is:

Difference = Total cost of bought - Total cost of sold
= $ 500 - $ 160
= $ 340

Therefore, the answer to the question is $ 340."
Response:  We have to make 120 cups of tea using 7 parts water and 1 part sugar. So we need 840 grams of sugar (1 part / 7 parts = 840 grams). Since each cup requires 5 grams of sugar, we will use 840/5 = 168 cups of sugar for all 120 cups of tea. Therefore, the number of cups of sugar needed is 168.

"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total income of Adrien and Lylah for one year. According to the question, Adrien's monthly salary is IDR 30 million, and he works for 12 months in a year. Therefore, his annual income is:

Adrien's annual income = Monthly salary x Number of months worked in a year
= IDR 30 million x 12 months
= IDR 360 million per year

Similarly, Lylah's monthly salary is IDR 25 million, and she works for 9 months in a year. Therefore, her annual income is:

Lylah's annual income = Monthly salary x Number of months worked in a year
= IDR 25 million x 9 months
= IDR 225 million per year

Now, let's find out the percentage of tax that Adrien and Lylah have to pay based on their respective incomes. According to the question, Adrien has to pay 40% of his income as tax, while Lylah has to pay 30% of her income as tax. So, we can calculate their tax amounts as follows:

Tax amount for Adrien = Tax rate x Annual income
= 40% x IDR 360 million
= IDR 144 million

Tax amount for Lylah = Tax rate x Annual income
= 30% x IDR 225 million
= IDR 67.5 million

Finally, we need to add up the total income and tax amounts to get the total amount of money that Adrien and Lylah receive after paying their taxes. Here it is:

Total amount received by Adrien + Total amount received by Lylah = Total income - Tax amount
= IDR 360 million + IDR 225 million - (IDR 144 million + IDR 67.5 million)
= IDR 587.5 million

Therefore, the total amount of money that Adrien and Lylah receive after paying their taxes is IDR 587.5 million."
Response:  If Migunakak√© has 2 pads of paper with 15 sheets each, then he has a total of 30 sheets of paper (2 x 15 = 30). Now, if he wants to share these sheets equally among his friends, he will have to distribute them in such a way that each friend gets an equal number of sheets. Since there are 4 friends in total, each friend will get 7.5 sheets of paper (30 / 4 = 7.5). So, the answer is 7.5 sheets of paper per friend.
Response:  Morisette picked 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael picked apple slices and half of an orange. The total number of fruits is equal to the sum of the number of fruits each person picked. Therefore, the answer is: Apples + Oranges = 5 + 8 = 13
Response:  According to the problem statement, Sadie works for 8 hours on Monday (Senin). Then she has off work for 2 hours and returns to work for another 4 hours. So her total working time in that day is 8 + 2 = 10 hours. Now let's calculate her weekly working time based on the number of days she works. She works for 5 days in a week, so her weekly working time is 10 hours/day x 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 miles in 3 hours, then she has covered a distance of 10 x 3 = 30 miles. Now, if her speed is 8 km/hour, then she has traveled a distance of 8 x 30 = 240 kilometers. Therefore, Rosie can cover a distance of 240 kilometers in 7 hours.

Therefore, the total amount paid for the fruits is 42 x $15 = $630."
"Response:  The doctor charges $ 150 per hour and the patient pays $ 200 per hour for hospitalization. If the average length of stay is 24 minutes, then the total cost to the patient will be:
$ 200/hour x (24 minutes / 60 minutes) = $ 37.50
So, the profit made by the doctor is:
$ 150 - $ 37.50 = $ 112.50
Therefore, the doctor makes a profit of $ 112.50 from each patient visit."
"Response:  We know that there are 60 workers in total working at the Santa Department Store. Among them, 10 elves have been assigned to help with the delivery of gifts. So, we can calculate the percentage of elves as follows:

Percentage of elves = (Number of elves / Total number of workers) x 100
= (10 / 60) x 100
= 16.67%

Therefore, approximately 16.67% of the workers at the Santa Department Store are elves."
Response:  The amount of money that was in the account at the end of June is $ 60 less than the initial amount of $ 500. So, if we subtract $ 60 from $ 500, we get $ 440. Therefore, the answer is $ 440.
Response:  Pam and Fred are at the carnival. Pam has a roller coaster ticket that she wants to trade with Fred for his tickets to the log ride. However, Fred only has three tickets left, so he can't give Pam all of them. If Pam has six tickets in total, then she must have traded two of her own tickets with someone else before meeting Fred. Therefore, the correct answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Dina travelled for 4 miles on Monday and then rested for 2 days (Tuesday and Wednesday). So she traveled for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 miles from Monday to Wednesday. Now we need to calculate how far Walt went in those 3 days. Since he started at 41 miles away from Dina's location, let's assume he traveled straight towards her until they met. Therefore, his distance covered would be equal to the distance between their locations initially minus the distance they traveled together. So, the answer is 41 - 6 = 35 miles.
Response:  If Tom can clean 4 cars in 2 hours (wulan), then he will be able to clean one car in 2/4 = 1 hour (cuci mobil). So, it takes him 1 hour to clean one car. Now, if each car costs Rp150,000 to clean (pira), then the total cost of cleaning all 4 cars is Rp150,000 x 4 = Rp600,000. Therefore, the answer is Rp600,000.
Response:  The number of games that Brian has created is 5 less than the number of games that Bobby has created, which is 20. So, the difference between the two numbers is 15 (20 - 5). Therefore, the number of games that Brian has created is 15.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in total and they are all singing together. Since we want to find out how many of them are in Scotland, we need to divide the number of unicorns by the number of unicorns that are in Scotland. So, if there are 3 unicorns in Scotland (according to the question), then the ratio of unicorns in Scotland to unicorns outside of Scotland is 3/27 or 1/9. Therefore, 10% of the unicorns are in Scotland.
Response:  The total cost of two sandwiches is $ 7.50 x 2 = $ 15.00. The total cost of two packets of crackers is $ 1.50 x 2 = $ 3.00. The total cost of two cookies is $ 1.00 x 2 = $ 2.00. So the total cost of all three items is $ 15.00 + $ 3.00 + $ 2.00 = $ 20.00. Then, if we add 20% of that amount for shipping (which is $ 4.00), and then subtract the tip of $ 5.00, the final delivery fee will be $ 20.00 - $ 4.00 = $ 16.00. Therefore, the total cost to deliver the order will be $ 16.00.

Response:  We have 22 gumballs in total and we want to know how many blue ones there are. If each pack of gumballs contains 5 blue ones, then we can calculate the number of blue gumballs as follows: Number of blue gumballs = Total number of gumballs x Number of blue gumballs per pack / Number of packs So, if we have 22 gumballs in total and each pack contains 5 blue gumballs, then the number of blue gumballs is: Number of blue gumballs = 22 x 5/2 = 10 blue gumballs Therefore, there are 10 blue gumballs among the 22 gumballs. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. We have 12 balls of rubber (karet) and we want to know how much money we will get from selling them. The price of one ball of rubber is Rp 100, so we can calculate the total amount of money we will get from selling all 12 balls of rubber as follows: Total amount of money = Number of balls of rubber x Price of one ball of rubber So, if we sell all 12 balls of rubber for Rp 100 each, then the total amount of money we will get is: Total amount of money = 12 x Rp 100 = Rp 1,200 Therefore, we will get Rp 1,200 from selling all 12 balls of rubber.

So, the answer is 7 days or 168 hours.
"Response: 
John bought some items from Kanggo and paid $2 for each item. He also bought a lamp that cost $3. Additionally, he bought three cups of coffee for $3 each, and four cans of soda for $4 each. Finally, he bought a bag of snacks that cost $5.
Total amount spent = Price of each item x Number of items
= $2 x 6 (items) + $3 x 1 (lamp) + $3 x 3 (cups of coffee) + $4 x 4 (cans of soda) + $5 x 1 (bag of snacks)
= $24 + $3 + $9 + $12 + $20 + $5
= $78
Therefore, the total amount John spent at Kanggo is $78."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total revenue from all three clients. The total revenue is calculated as follows:
Total Revenue = Number of Clients x Average Order Value (AOV) per Client
= 3 Clients x $ 20 per client
= $ 60
Next, we need to subtract the total expenses from the total revenue to get the profit. The total expenses are calculated as follows:
Total Expenses = Cost of Goods Sold + Shipping Costs + Miscellaneous Expenses
= $ 10 + $ 5 + $ 3
= $ 18
Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
= $ 60 - $ 18
= $ 42
Therefore, if Lucas earns $ 92 per week, his profit margin would be:
Profit Margin = Profit / Total Revenue
= $ 42 / $ 60
= 70%
So, Lucas's profit margin for that particular week was 70%."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that John has 10 hectares of land for growing mangoes. Then, we are told that there are 100 mango trees per hectare. Therefore, the total number of mango trees in John's land is 10 x 100 = 1000 mango trees.
Next, we are given that John can harvest mangoes for 3 months. So, the total number of mangoes that John can harvest is 1000 x 3 = 3000 mangoes.
Finally, we are asked how many baskets of mangoes John can make from his harvest. Based on the information provided earlier, each basket contains 50 mangoes. Therefore, John can make 3000 / 50 = 60 baskets of mangoes from his harvest."
"Response:  If Johnny has collected 500 pieces of wood and he wants to know how many pieces he needs to collect to have 1/4 of the total amount of wood that is needed for the floor, we can calculate it as follows:

Total number of pieces of wood needed for the floor = 500 (as given in the problem)
Number of pieces of wood needed to cover 1/4 of the floor = Total number of pieces of wood needed for the floor / 4
= 500 / 4
= 125 pieces of wood
Therefore, Johnny needs to collect 125 more pieces of wood to have 1/4 of the total amount of wood needed for the floor."
"Response:  We know that there are 30 bees in total and they work for 6 hours every day. So, the number of bee visits to the flower per hour is:

Number of bee visits/hour = Total number of bees / Time worked (in hours)
= 30 / 6
= 5 bee visits/hour

Now, we need to calculate how many times each bee visits the flower during its working time. Since there are 6 hours in a day, the number of times each bee visits the flower per day is:

Number of times each bee visits the flower/day = Number of bee visits/hour x Number of hours worked/day
= 5 bee visits/hour x 6 hours/day
= 30 bee visits/day

Since Debra works for 6 hours every day, the number of bee visits to the flower by Debra per day is:

Number of bee visits to the flower by Debra/day = Total number of bee visits/day x Working hours of Debra/day
= 30 bee visits/day x 6 hours/day
= 180 bee visits/day

Therefore, the answer to the question is 180 bee visits to the flower per day by Debra."
Response:  The cost of one ticket for an adult is $12 and for a child it is $10. If Brittany buys two tickets (one for herself and one for her child), she will pay $24 in total. So, the amount that Brittany will have left after buying the tickets is $8 - $24 = -$16. Therefore, the correct answer is -$16.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 12 friends in Facebook and James also has some friends in Facebook. So, if we add both of their friend counts together, we get 12 + x = 24. Solving for x, we find that x = 12. Therefore, James has 12 friends in Facebook as well.
"Response: 
Steve can run at an average speed of 440 feet per minute (or 137 meters per minute). If he runs for 3 miles (which is equal to 4828 feet), it will take him approximately 3 minutes and 20 seconds to cover that distance.
Tim can run at an average speed of 264 feet per minute (or 80 meters per minute). If he runs for 2 miles (which is equal to 3265 feet), it will take him approximately 2 minutes and 40 seconds to cover that distance.
Now, let's calculate how long it would take both Steve and Tim to reach each other if they are running towards each other. We know that Steve takes 3 minutes and 20 seconds to cover 3 miles, so it will take him 3 x 20 = 60 seconds to cover half of that distance (i.e., 1.5 miles or 2414 feet). Similarly, Tim takes 2 minutes and 40 seconds to cover 2 miles, so it will take him 2 x 40 = 80 seconds to cover half of that distance (i.e., 1 mile or 1609 feet).
Therefore, if Steve starts running from his current position and Tim starts running from his current position, it will take Steve 60 seconds to catch up to Tim, assuming they are running towards each other."
Response:  The price of one ride is Rp 10,000 (Rupiah). If we want to calculate how much money can be saved with a discount of 25%, we need to know the original price first. So, if the original price of one ride is x, then after applying a 25% discount, the new price will be x - (x/4) = 75%. Now, let's find out how many rides can be taken with the remaining amount of money. If there are y rides left, and each ride costs Rp 75,000, then the total cost of all rides will be y \* 75,000 =...
Response:  We know that Carl has 10 packages of cookies and each package contains 12 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is 10 x 12 = 120 cookies. Since each cookie costs $ 0.10, the total cost of all the cookies is 120 x $ 0.10 = $ 12. Now, we need to find out how much money Carl needs to pay for the cookies. As he only has $ 10 in his wallet, he cannot afford to buy all the cookies. So, the amount of money Carl needs to pay is $ 12 - $ 10 = $ 2.

"Response: 
Petugas kebun binatang men√®hi panganan marang kab√®h kera ing kebun binatang means that the forest ranger counted the number of bananas consumed by monkeys in the forest for two months.
Dheweke pesen kabeh pisang saka peternakan lokal saben 2 wulan means that there are 200 banana plants planted and harvested every two months (for a total of 400 bananas).
Yen kethek butuh 200 pisang means that the gorilla needs 200 bananas per month.
Lan babon butuh 100 pisang saben wulan means that the orangutan needs 100 bananas every two months (for a total of 200 bananas).
So, we need to calculate how many bananas will be left after two months based on these requirements:
Total bananas needed = Gorilla + Orangutan + Banana plants
= 400 + 200 + 200
= 800 bananas
Now, let's assume that the banana plants produce 200 bananas every two months. So, after two months, we have:
Remaining bananas = Total bananas - Produced bananas
= 800 - 200 x 2
= 600 bananas
Therefore, after two months, there will be 600 bananas left in the forest."

Raphael bought 4 pens for Rp1.5 thousand, 2 notebooks for Rp4 thousand, and a set of obligatory papers for Rp20 thousand. Therefore, the total cost of Raphael's school supplies is:
Total Cost = Cost of pens x Number of pens + Cost of notebooks x Number of notebooks + Cost of obligatory papers x Number of obligatory papers
= Rp1.5 x 4 + Rp4 x 2 + Rp20 x 1
= Rp9 + Rp8 + Rp20
= Rp37
Therefore, the answer to the question ""How much did Raphael spend on his school supplies?"" is Rp37."
Response:  We know that there are 11 tadpoles in total and they need to cross the pond. If we assume that each tadpole takes 3 seconds to cross the pond, then it will take them 33 seconds (11 x 3) to complete their journey. However, if we consider that Finns can only carry 2 tadpoles at a time, then he needs to make 17 trips (2 x 8 = 17) to transport all the tadpoles across the pond. Therefore, the answer is 17.
Response:  On Monday (Selasa), the height of the water in the container was 17 feet. Then on Tuesday (Rebo), the water level decreased by one-third or 5 feet (2/3 x 7 kaki = 5 kaki). So, the new height of the water in the container on Tuesday is 12 feet (17 - 5 = 12).
"Response: 
Anakin has 10 degrees of longitude and 6 degrees of latitude, while Locsin has 5 degrees of longitude less than Anakin, 3 degrees less than Anakin in terms of latitude, and 2 degrees less than Anakin in terms of depth.
So, if we calculate the distance between Anakin and Locsin using trigonometry, we get:
Distance = sqrt((10 - 5)¬≤ + (6 - 3)¬≤ + (2 - x)¬≤)
Where x is the difference in depth between Anakin and Locsin.
Solving for x, we get:
x = 4
Therefore, the distance between Anakin and Locsin is approximately 8 kilometers."
Response:  The original price of marble is $ 20 per square meter and there is a discount of 20%. So, the new price will be $ 16 per square meter ( $ 20 x 80%). Now, if we want to calculate the price of 36 square meters, we need to multiply the price per square meter by 36, which gives us $ 576 ($ 16 x 36). Therefore, the final price of marble after applying the discount is $ 576.

X + Y = Number of votes obtained by candidate A (60)... (2)
Y + Z = Number of votes obtained by candidate B (40)... (3)
Z = Number of votes obtained by candidate C (20)... (4)
Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
X + Y + Z = 80
Substituting equation (2) into equation (3), we get:
Y + Z = 40
Substituting equation (4) into equation (1), we get:
X + Y + Z = 80
Now, we have four linear equations with four unknown variables (X, Y, Z, and W). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
X = 50
Y = 30
Z = 20
W = 80 - (X + Y + Z) = 80 - (50 + 30 + 20) = 70
Therefore, the answer is:

Response:  The probability of Jerry winning is 60%, and the probability of losing is 40%. If Jerry wins, his partner will get Rp 1 million, and if he loses, his partner will get nothing. So, the expected value of the game for Jerry's partner is: Expected Value = (Probability of Winning x Prize for Winning) + (Probability of Losing x Prize for Losing) = (60% x IDR 1 million) + (40% x Nothing) = IDR 600,000 + IDR 0 = IDR 600,000 In summary, Jerry's partner expects to receive an average payout of IDR 600,000 from the game.
Response:  We know that Jenna has 1/2 of an apple (which is equal to 5 apples). If she gives 3 apples to her friend, then she will have 5 - 3 = 2 apples left. So, there are 2 apples left after Jenna gives 3 apples to her friend.
Response:  The total number of jerami that the mouse wants is 3 x 6 = 18 jerami. Since there are 10 hamsters and each hamster has 5 jerami, then the total number of jerami for the hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50 jerami. Now, since there are 20 jerami scattered among the rabbits, then the number of jerami per rabbit is 20 / 4 = 5 jerami. Therefore, the total number of jerami left in the store after all the animals have taken their share is 18 + 50 - 5 = 93 jerami.
"Response:  The amount of money owed to Benedict is $100. If Mandy agrees to pay 2% interest per year, then the total amount that Mandy will have to pay after one year is:

Response:  The total amount of money that Mark earned in one week is 1000 ukara. If Penerbit A pays 5 sen per ukra, then the amount of money that Penerbit A paid to Mark is 5 x 1000 = 5000 sen. So, after one week, Mark received 5000 - 3000 = 2000 sen from Penerbit A.
Response:  We have 5 people who can drink 1 liter of water each, so they will need 5 liters of water in total. Then we have 6 more people who also want to drink water, but they only need 0.6 liters per person, so they will need 3.6 liters of water in total. Therefore, the total amount of water needed is 5 + 3.6 = 8.6 liters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John won an award worth $5000 and received a 5% raise. We also know that he worked for 20 weeks in a year. Therefore, his total earnings for the year can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = Award + Raise x Number of working weeks = $5000 + ($5000 x 5%) x 20 = $5000 + $1000 = $6000 Now, let's calculate the amount of money John earned per week: Weekly earnings = Total earnings / Number of weeks worked = $6000 / 20 = $300 per week So, John earned $300 per week.
Response:  The total area of land owned by Josie is 10 hectares (hectar). Of this, 5 tons of grapes are grown in 2 hectares (hectare) per year, and each ton of grapes produces 2 bottles of wine. Therefore, the number of bottles of wine produced annually by Josie's winery can be calculated as follows: Number of bottles = Total area x Production per hectare x Number of tons produced per hectare x Number of bottles per ton = 10 x 5 x 2 x 2 = 400 bottles per year.
Response:  The number of pieces of cheese that Carl eats in one week is 14 (2 x 7). Then, he eats 3 more pieces of cheese for breakfast every day, so the total number of pieces of cheese he eats in one week is 14 + 3 x 7 = 59. Therefore, the number of pieces of cheese that Carl eats in one month is 59 x 4 = 236.
"Response:  We have:
Janet has 22 pens in total (including both blue and red pens).
She gives away 10 blue pens to her friends.
So, she now has 12 blue pens left (22 - 10 = 12).
She also has 6 red pens left (22 - 10 = 12), since she gave away 4 red pens.
Now, we need to find out how many pens Janet has in total after giving them away. So, let's add up the number of blue and red pens she has:
12 + 6 = 18 pens.
Therefore, Janet has 18 pens in total after giving some away."

"Response: 
Michael walked for 5 days and covered 25 kilometers per day. Therefore, he traveled a total distance of 125 kilometers (25 km/day x 5 days) during those 5 days.
After that, he rested for 3 days and then continued his journey, covering 60 kilometers per day. So, in total, he traveled a distance of 180 kilometers (60 km/day x 3 days) during those 3 days.
Therefore, the total distance traveled by Michael is 125 + 180 = 305 kilometers."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 candies in total and each candy weighs 40 grams. So, if we divide the weight of all the candies (25 x 40 = 1000) by the number of candies (25), we get the average weight of one candy as follows:
Average weight of one candy = Total weight / Number of candies = 1000 / 25 = 40 grams."
"Response:  According to the question, there are 4 kinds of kue sold in Dina's store every Monday (Selasa). If we assume that each kind of kue is equally popular and sells for IDR 10,000 per piece, then the total revenue from kue sales would be:
IDR 10,000 x 4 = IDR 40,000
Now, let's consider how many pieces of each type of kue were sold during the day. Based on the information provided, there were 5 types of kue in total, with the following number of pieces sold:
Type A - 3 pieces
Type B - 2 pieces
Type C - 4 pieces
Type D - 5 pieces
Type E - 6 pieces
So, the total number of pieces of all types of kue sold was:
3 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 pieces
Finally, if we multiply the total number of pieces by their respective prices, we get the total revenue from kue sales:
IDR 40,000 x 21 = IDR 840,000
Therefore, the answer to the question is IDR 840,000."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of one roll of rice. Since there are 1200 grams of rice in a roll, and each gram costs $0.05, then the cost of one roll is:

$0.05 x 1200 = $60

Next, we need to calculate the number of rolls of rice that $6000 can buy. Since there are 6000 grams of rice in a half-roll (i.e., 3000 grams per roll), then the number of rolls that $6000 can buy is:

$6000 / $0.05 = 120 rolls

Finally, we need to subtract the number of rolls that $6000 can buy from the total amount of money spent on rice ($1200 - $6000). Therefore, the remaining amount of money after buying all the rice is:

$1200 - 120 x $0.05 = $4800

So, the total cost of the rice is $6000, and the remaining amount of money after buying all the rice is $4800."

Wong Tuwane will pay $4 for the shoes. So, Sara needs to pay $9 (=$5 x 2) for the shoes. Now, let's calculate how much money Sara needs to pay in total: $30 + $20 = $50. Therefore, Sara needs to pay $50 to buy the jacket and shoes for her children."
Response:  The number of white eggs produced in 3 days is 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. And the total number of eggs produced in 5 days is 5 x 5 = 25 eggs. So, the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42 - 9 = 33 eggs. Therefore, the ratio of white eggs to brown eggs is 33 : 18 (or 2 : 1).
Response:  The length of the straight line is given as 1.5 miles and the speed is 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to cover that distance at that speed, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. So, in this case, the time taken would be: Time = 1.5 miles / 3 miles/hour = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 30 minutes.
Response:  The total number of customers who bought something from the store is 100 (Sloane said so). Out of those 100 customers, 50 did not pay attention to the price tag (according to the passage). So, the remaining 50 customers paid attention to the price tag and were interested in buying things at the store. Therefore, the percentage of customers who paid attention to the price tag is 50/100 = 0.5 or 50%.

Jerry drew wrong Kolam, Kalorone Bocor Kanthi 4 Galon/Menit. (4 Menit = 24 Menit)
Kolam Gedhe Duwe Banyu Kaping Pindho Tinimbang Kolam Cilik = 160 Galon (Since 4 Menit x 24 Menit = 96 Menit)
Saiki Kolam Gedhe Duwe Banyu Kaping Papat Luwih Akeh Tinimbang Kolam Cilik = 160 Galon / 3 = 53.33 Galon
So, the amount of water in the small tank is approximately 53.33 Galons."
Response:  The total cost of one pair of shoes is $320.00, and the discount for buying in bulk is $32.00. So, the price per pair after the discount is $320.00 - $32.00 = $288.00. If you buy two pairs of shoes, the total cost would be $288.00 x 2 = $576.00. Now, if you pay $8.00 for each pair, the total amount paid would be $576.00 x 2 = $1152.00. Therefore, the remaining balance after paying $1152.00 is $494.00 ($1152.00 - $576.00).
Response:  The total amount that Janet promised to pay is $ 2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount, which is $ 2000 x 10% = $ 200. So the total amount that Janet has to pay is $ 2000 + $ 200 = $ 2200. If she pays $ 165 per week for 12 weeks, her remaining balance after 12 weeks will be $ 2200 - $ 165 x 12 = $ 1835.

IDR 150,000 x 3 = IDR 450,000 (for one campaign)
Since there are 3 campaigns in a year, the total cost for all campaigns is:
IDR 450,000 x 3 = IDR 1,350,000 (total cost for all campaigns)"
Response:  The cost of renting Carlos' boat for 3 hours is $30, and the cost of renting Benji's boat for 5 hours is $18. Therefore, the total cost of renting both boats for 3 + 5 = 8 hours can be calculated as follows: Total Cost = $30 (Carlos) + $18 (Benji) x Number of Hours Used = $30 + $18 x 8 = $240.
Response:  The distance from Newark, NJ to Rochester is approximately 305 miles (491 km). If we assume that the car can travel at an average speed of 60 mph (97 km/h), it will take around 5 hours and 30 minutes to cover this distance. So, if the driver stops for half an hour, they will have traveled 258 miles (415 km) or roughly 85% of the total distance.
"Response:  We have 30 cards of each type in total: 
Jinis Geni = 30 x 1/30 = 1/1
Jinis Suket = 30 x 2/30 = 2/1
Jinis Banyu = 30 x 4/30 = 4/1
Total number of cards = Jinis Geni + Jinis Suket + Jinis Banyu = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
Now we need to choose 8 cards from them randomly. The probability of choosing any one card is equal to the number of that card divided by the total number of cards. So, the probability of choosing a genie card is 1/7, the probability of choosing a suket card is 2/7, and the probability of choosing a banyu card is 4/7."
Response:  The total cost of the burrito is $6.50. If you add extra beef ($2.00), extra cheese ($1.00), and extra vegetables ($1.00), the new total cost would be $9.50. However, if you also want to add two sauces ($.25 x 2 = $.50), the final total cost would be $10.00. So, the correct answer is $10.00.
"Response:  If Kalinda can make 360 pieces of ibune in one day, and she adds 4 more pieces every minute, then...

1. In 1 hour (or 60 minutes), Kalinda will have made 60 x 4 = 240 additional pieces of ibune.
2. In 2 hours (or 120 minutes), Kalinda will have made 120 x 4 = 480 additional pieces of ibune.
3. In 3 hours (or 180 minutes), Kalinda will have made 180 x 4 = 720 additional pieces of ibune.
4. In 4 hours (or 240 minutes), Kalinda will have made 240 x 4 = 960 additional pieces of ibune.
5. In 5 hours (or 300 minutes), Kalinda will have made 300 x 4 = 1200 additional pieces of ibune.

Therefore, if Kalinda continues to work at this rate for 5 hours, she will have made a total of 1200 + 360 = 1560 pieces of ibune in that time. So, the answer is 1560."
"Response:  We know that there are 120 baby chicks in the basket and Ashlyn has already collected 30% of them (which means she has collected 36 baby chicks). Now we need to find out how many baby chicks will be left after one week. If it takes 7 days for the chicks to grow into adult chickens, then after one week, only 3/4 of the remaining chicks will have grown into adult chickens. So, the number of baby chicks left after one week is:

Number of baby chicks left = Number of baby chicks initially - Number of baby chicks collected x (Time taken to grow into adult chicken / Total time)
= 120 - 36 x (7 / 14)
= 84

So, after one week, there will be 84 baby chicks left in the basket."
Response:  The price of the car is $20,000 and we have to pay taxes of 10% which means $2,000. So, the total cost of the car including registration fee is $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000.
Response:  We know that Kylie has collected 5 shells and Robert has collected 20 shells in total. On Tuesday (Selasa), Kylie collects 3 more shells than she did on Monday (Senen). So, if Kylie collected 5 shells on Monday, then she collected 8 shells on Tuesday (since 5 + 3 = 8). Therefore, the number of shells collected by Kylie on Tuesday is 8.
Response:  We are given that there are 50 semut (ants) in the kebon (garden). The question asks how many of them will be left after half of the ants have been eaten by the snake. So, if we assume that the snake eats half of the total number of ants, then the remaining ants will be equal to half of 50, which is 25. Therefore, after half of the ants have been eaten by the snake, there will be 25 ants left in the garden.
Response:  The penguin has to cross the snow and reach the other side of the river. There are three options for crossing the river: by swimming, sliding on ice, or walking along the bank. If we assume that the penguin can swim at a speed of 10 meters per minute, it will take him 36 minutes to cross the river (since he started swimming from the point where he was standing). If he chooses to slide on the ice, he will need to cover a distance of 25 meters in one direction, which means he will have traveled 50 meters overall (since he needs to return to his starting point as well). Therefore, it will also take him 36 minutes to cross the river using this method. Finally, if he decides to walk along the bank, he will need to cover a distance of 50 meters in each direction, resulting in a total time of 72 minutes to cross the river. So, based on these calculations, the penguin will take the longest time to cross the river if he walks along the bank.
"Response:  We have to calculate how many weeks it takes for 3 tomatoes to grow from seedlings to full-grown tomatoes using an angel wing plant. The time frame is given as follows: ""Dheweke mangan 6 saben dina."" This means that in 6 weeks, the tomato plants will be ready to harvest. Now, let's convert this period into weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 6 weeks by 7 days per week: 6/7 = 0.86 or approximately 1 month and 2 weeks. Therefore, if we start with 3 tomato seeds today, it will take around 1 month and 2 weeks (or 45 days) for them to fully grown using an angel wing plant."
Response:  We know that there are 20 pieces of pizza in total and John can eat 4 pieces at once. So, if we divide the number of pieces he can eat at once (4) with the total number of pieces of pizza (20), we get the number of times John can eat pizza: 4/20 = 1/5. Therefore, John can eat one piece of pizza five times.
Response:  We are given that there are 25 pens without ink and we want to know how many full pens (inked) can be made from them. So, let F represent the number of full pens that can be made. According to the question, each pen requires 3 drops of ink to fill it completely. Therefore, if we use all 25 pens without ink, we will need 25 x 3 = 75 drops of ink to fill them completely. Since one drop of ink can fill one pen, we have 75 / 1 = 75 full pens. So, the answer is 75.
Response:  If Johnny has $10 more than Nujupuk, and Nujupuk has $50, then Johnny has $60. So, the answer is 60.

"Response:  The total number of students in classroom X = 1000. From the information given, we know that there are 3 rows of desks (A, B, and C) with different numbers of students sitting at each row. We also know that 30% of the students in row A are late, 3/5 of the students in row B are late, and all the students in row C are late. To find out how many students are late overall, we can multiply the percentage of students who are late for each row by the total number of students in that row. So, the total number of students who are late = (30% x 300) + (3/5 x 200) + (liyane x 100). Now, let's calculate these values: 30% of 300 students in row A = 90; 3/5 of 200 students in row B = 40; and all 100 students in row C are late. Therefore, the total number of students who are late = 90 + 40 + 100 = 230."
Response:  We know that John has 6 permits and he gave one to Robert. So, John now has 6 - 1 = 5 remaining permits. Since each permit costs $10, John now has 5 x $10 = $50 left after giving one permit to Robert. Therefore, John has $50 / 5 = $10 per permit left.

"Response:  We have to write down the number of minutes in one week as follows:
Monday = 1440 minutes (24 hours x 60 minutes/hour)
Tuesday = 1440 minutes
Wednesday = 1440 minutes
Thursday = 1440 minutes
Friday = 1440 minutes
Saturday = 1440 minutes
Sunday = 1440 minutes
Total minutes in one week = 7200 minutes
Now, let's calculate how many minutes are written in 5 weeks as follows:
Week 1 = 7200 minutes / 5 weeks = 1440 minutes per week
Week 2 = 1440 minutes per week x 2 weeks = 2880 minutes
Week 3 = 2880 minutes per week x 3 weeks = 8640 minutes
Week 4 = 8640 minutes per week x 4 weeks = 33600 minutes
Week 5 = 33600 minutes per week x 1 week = 33600 minutes
Therefore, the total number of minutes written in 5 weeks is 33600 minutes."

Jason has a plan to call Wulan for 1000 minutes in total. If he calls her every 15 minutes, then the total time spent calling her is:

1000 minutes x (15 minutes/call) = 15000 minutes

Now, we need to calculate how many hours Jason spends talking to Wulan. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

15000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 250 hours

Therefore, Jason talks to Wulan for 250 hours in total."
Response:  We know that Griffin made 24 fried potatoes and gave 5 to Kyle. Then, Kyle mixed them with other ingredients and cooked them again. After that, Billy took some of those fried potatoes from Kyle and added them to his own mixture. Finally, Ginger mixed all of them together and got 27 fried potatoes in total. So, the number of fried potatoes that Ginger had after mixing everything is 27 - 5 = 22.
Response:  We have 4 siput in one aquarium and 32 siput in another aquarium. The total number of siput is 36 (4 + 32). Now, we need to find out how many siput are left after some of them died. If there were initially 36 siput, and 10 of them died, then the remaining siput would be 26 (36 - 10). So, the final answer is 26 siput.
"Response:  The cost of one pair of jeans is $250 and it takes 6 hours to make each pair. Therefore, the total cost of making 4 pairs of jeans in one week is:

$250 x 4 = $1000

Since the artist gets a discount of 10%, the amount that needs to be paid for each pair of jeans is:

$1000 x (1 - 0.10) = $900

Therefore, the total amount that needs to be paid for all 4 pairs of jeans is:

$900 x 4 = $3600

So, the pira duhit (the amount needed to pay) for the 4 pairs of jeans is $3600."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items needed for the party: Bahan kanggo ($ 12), hadiah ulang tahun ($ 43), dekorasi ($ 15), undhangan ($ 4), and tas barang kanggo tamu ($ 22). The total cost is: $ 1 + $ 43 + $ 15 + $ 4 + $ 22 = $ 86. So, the amount paid in dollars is $ 86 / 100 = $ 0.86. Therefore, the answer is $ 0.86.
Response:  We have 4 bunches of bananas and each bunch contains 10 bananas. Therefore, we have a total of 4 x 10 = 40 bananas. Since each banana costs $0.25, the total cost of all the bananas is 40 x $0.25 = $10. So, the answer is $10.
Response:  If Ing Dina baked 4 cookies and each cookie contains 200 calories, then the total number of calories in all 4 cookies is 800 (4 x 200).
