"Response:  To find out how much money Janet makes from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market each day, we need to subtract the number of eggs she eats or uses (3) from the total number of eggs she lays per day (16). So, the number of eggs available for sale is:

16 - 3 = 13

Now, let's assume that she sells all 13 eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily income from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market would be:

13 x $2 = $26

So, Janet makes $26 per day by selling duck eggs at the farmers' market."
Response:  Total amount of fibers required = (2 x Blue Fiber) + (Half White Fiber) = 4 Bolts
Response:  To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to subtract the cost of repairs from the original price of the house. So, if the value of the house after repairs is $240,000 (150% increase), and Josh paid $80,000 for the house, his profit would be: Profit = Selling Price - Purchase Price = $240,000 - $80,000 = $160,000.

Response:  To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Wendi feeds her chickens 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per bird every day, so for a flock of 20 chickens, she will need to give them 60 cups of feed (3 x 20 = 60).
Response:  The cost of 16 glasses = (16 x $5) + (8 x ($5 / 2)) = $96 + $4 = $100.
Response:  Let's first find out how many sheep Charleston has. According to the problem, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep. Finally, we can add the number of sheep in Seattle (20) to get the total number of sheep in all three cities: 160 + 80 + 20 = 360 sheep.
"Response:  The total time taken to download the file will be:
Time = Distance / Speed
Distance = Total size of the file (in GB)
Speed = Download speed in GB/minute
So, if the total size of the file is 200 GB and the download speed is 2 GB/minute, then the time taken to download the file will be:
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes
Therefore, the load on the computer during this process will be approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes."
"Response:  To find out how far John is from home after 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance traveled during each leg of his journey and add them up.

Leg 1: Driving for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph = Distance = Speed x Time = 60 x 3 = 180 miles
Leg 2: Spending the first 2 hours in standstill traffic = No distance traveled (as there was no movement)
Leg 3: Driving for the last half-hour at a speed of 30 mph = Distance = Speed x Time = 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles
Leg 4: Driving the remaining time of the 4 hours at a speed of 80 mph = Distance = Speed x Time = 80 x 4 = 320 miles
Total distance traveled = Add the distances of all legs = 180 + 0 + 15 + 320 = 515 miles
Therefore, John is 515 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
"Response:  Let E be Eliza's total earnings for the week. Since Eliza worked for 45 hours, her regular earnings for the week are:
E = 45 x $10 = $450
Now, let OT stand for overtime pay. So, Eliza's overtime earnings for the week are:
OT = $450 x 1.2 = $540
Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
E = $450 + $540 = $990"
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

1. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
2. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as in the first month, so the downloads were 3 x 60 = 180 downloads.
3. In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were (180 - 30%) = 126 downloads.

Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three months is: 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads."
Response:  The total cost of the pastries is given by the equation: Total Cost = (3 x $68/dozen) + (2 x $80/dozen) + (6 x $55/dozen) = $249.
"Response:  To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the total cost of planting the tree, as well as the annual income generated by the tree. Let's break down these costs and revenues in a table format:

| Year | Cost of Planting Tree ($) | Number of Lemons Produced per Year ($) | Revenue from Lemons Sold ($) | Total Income ($) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | $90 | 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 | $10.5 | $100 |
| 2 | $90 | 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 | $18.5 | $168 |
| 3 | $90 | 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 | $24.5 | $224 |
|... |... |... |... |... |

As you can see, the first year Carlos spends $90 to plant the tree, but he doesn't generate any revenue yet. In the second year, he produces 7 lemons worth $10.5, so his total income is $168. In the third year, he produces 7 more lemons worth $10.5, so his total income is $224.

To find out when Carlos will start earning money from his lemon tree, let's set up an equation based on the total cost of planting the tree and the annual income generated by the tree:

Total Cost + Annual Income = Earning Period

Substituting the values from the table above into this equation, we get:

$90 + ($10.5 x Years) = Earning Period

Solving for ""Years"", we get:

Years = $90 / ($10.5 x Years)

Plugging in the value of $90 and solving for ""Years"", we get:

Years = $90 / ($10.5 x Years) = 8.5 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos approximately 8.5 years to start ear"
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she had (3/4) x 5 = 3.75 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.
* She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had (3.75 - 2) = 1.75 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the red house.
* She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she had (1.75 / 2) = 0.875 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.
* Finally, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: 0.875 + 3.75 + 2 = 5.
Solving for x, we get: x = 4.
So, Melanie started with 4 vacuum cleaners."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Out of 20 students, 4 students (20%) enrolled in contemporary dance.
* Out of the remaining 16 students, 4 students (25%) enrolled in jazz dance.
* So, out of the total 36 students, 8 students (22%) enrolled in jazz dance.
* Now, we are asked to find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance.

So, the answer is: 36 - 8 = 28 students enrolled in hip-hop dance, which means that 77% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance (28/36 x 100%)."
"Response:  The profit from purchasing jewelry over electronics can be calculated as follows:

Profit = ($5,000 x 2.5%) - ($8,000 x 1.2%)
= $1,250 - $960
= $290

Therefore, if the merchant chooses to buy jewelry instead of electronic gadgets, they will make a profit of $290 at the end of the month."
Response:  Let's assume that the speed of one train is x mph and the other train's speed is y mph. We know that the total distance traveled by both trains in the first day = 80 miles. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Distance = Speed x Time. In the first day, the time taken to cover 80 miles will be equal to the speed of one train divided by its distance covered. Similarly, for the second day, the time taken to cover 150 miles will be equal to the speed of the other train divided by its distance covered. Now, let's substitute these values into the above equation: For Train A (speed = x): Distance = x x 80/1 = 80x For Train B (speed = y): Distance = y x 150/2 = 75y Now, we have two equations with two unknown variables (x and y). Solving them simultaneously gives us the following values: x = 30 and y = 45. Therefore, the distance covered by Train A in the first day was 80x = 80(30) = 2400 miles, and the distance covered by Train B in the first day was 75y = 75(45) = 3125 miles. In the second day, Train A covered a distance of 80x = 80(30) = 2400 miles, while Train B covered a distance of 75y = 75(45) = 3125 miles.
Response:  To find Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply the number of hours she works each week by the rate she is paid for each activity. For teaching, she works 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week. For coaching, she works 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week. So, her total weekly income is $700 + $450 = $1,150/week. Since she works 50 weeks/year, her annual salary is $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year.
Response:  To find out how many dozen eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she eats per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. So, if Claire makes a 3 egg omelette every morning, she will eat 3 x 21 = 63 eggs in one week. Therefore, she will eat 63 x 4 = 252 eggs in 4 weeks. Hence, Claire will eat 252 / 12 = 20.17 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.
"Response:  Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

Marissa walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, so her pace for that section was 4 miles/hour.
She then walked the next 2 miles in 1 hour, so her pace for that section was also 4 miles/hour.
To find her average speed for the entire hike, we can add up all of these speeds and divide by the total distance:

Average speed = (4 miles/hour x 4 miles) + (4 miles/hour x 2 miles) / (12 miles)
= 8 miles/hour

So, if Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a rate of 8 miles per hour."
"Response:  The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters can be calculated as follows:

Original volume of orange drink = 10 liters
Initial proportion of water in orange drink = 2/3
Final volume of orange drink after spilling = 9 liters (since 1 liter was spilled)
New proportion of water in orange drink = (9/10) x (2/3) = 8/9

Now, let's calculate the total volume of both drinks:
Volume of orange drink = 10 liters + Volume of pineapple drink = 15 liters
Total volume of both drinks = Orange drink + Pineapple drink = 10 liters + 15 liters = 25 liters

Since we spilled 1 liter of orange drink, the new volume of orange drink is:
Orange drink after spilling = 9 liters

So, the final proportion of water in the orange drink is:
(9/10) x (2/3) = 8/9

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
24 liters x 8/9 = 19 liters"
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. So, Raymond was born when Samantha was 6 years old.
* Raymond had a son at the age of 23. So, Raymond's son was born when he was 23 + 6 = 39 years old.
* Now, Samantha is 31 years old. So, the difference between their ages is 31 - 6 = 25 years.
* Therefore, Raymond's son was born 25 years ago."

Response:  Let's first calculate the total amount spent by Marie on food items: Chicken meal = $12 x 1 = $12 Milk = $3 x 5 = $15 Apples = $1.50 x 4 = $6 Total amount spent on food = $19 Now, let's find out how much money Marie paid for pizza: Pizza = $8.50 x number of boxes =? Number of boxes = Total amount spent on pizza / $8.50 So, we can set up an equation as follows: $19 + x = $50 where x is the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Solving for x, we get x = 3 Therefore, Marie ordered 3 boxes of pizza.
"Response:  To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to add up the cost of each item that she bought. The total cost is:

Shorts: 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
Pants: 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
Shoes: 3 x $42 = $126
Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $242.00

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $242.00 on all the clothing items."
Response:  The total cost of ice cream that Cynthia will spend in 60 days is given by the formula: Total Cost = Number of Servings x Cost per Serving. In this case, the number of servings is 15 (since each carton has 15 servings) and the cost per serving is $4.00. Therefore, the total cost of ice cream that Cynthia will spend in 60 days is: Total Cost = 15 x $4.00 = $60.00.
Response:  The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 35 miles (20 + 15).
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information:

Gloria has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels.
The total cost of the three options is:
Boots = $X
High heels (pair 1) = $33
High heels (pair 2) = $66 ($33 x 2)
So, the total cost of all three options is:
$X + $33 + $66 = $100
Now, we need to find out what value of X satisfies this equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by $100:
$X / $100 = $33 + $66 / $100
$X / $100 = $99
X = $100 - $99 = $1
Therefore, the boots cost $1."
Response:  To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to multiply Darrell's age by 11 and add it to Darrell's current age. So, Allen's age will be 162 x 11 = 1730 + 75 = 1805 years old.
"Response:  Let's analyze each friend's answer:
Friend 1 said there are 80 jelly beans in the jar.
Friend 2 said there are 20 more than half of what Friend 1 said, which means they multiplied 80 by 3/2 = 130 jelly beans.
Friend 3 said there are 25% more than Friend 1, which means they multiplied 80 by 1.25 = 100 jelly beans.
Now, let's find the average of these three answers: (80 + 130 + 100) / 3 = 210. Therefore, the average guess of Gunter's friends is 210 jelly beans in the jar."
Response:  To find out how many hours per week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to walk and take care of each dog's business per day. So, if John takes care of 10 dogs, he will spend 10 x.5 = 5 hours per day taking care of them. Therefore, John spends 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week taking care of the dogs.
Response:  Let's assume the total number of coins Gretchen has is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x - 30. So, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is 70 (x - 30).
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

1. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, if Aaron has x jewels, Siobhan has x - 2 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, if Raymond has y jewels, Aaron has y + 5 jewels.
3. Raymond has 40 jewels.

Now, we can use the above information to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

Siobhan has x - 2 jewels, and Aaron has y + 5 jewels. Therefore, Siobhan has (x - 2) + (y + 5) = 40 jewels.

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 26
y = 24

So, Siobhan has 26 jewels."
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information:
Mike played ping-pong for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. So, his average score per minute is:
Average score = Total score / Time taken = 4 + (20 x 25%) = 4 + 5 = 9 points/minute
Now, let's calculate the total number of points Mike scored during the entire game:
Total points = Average score x Game time = 9 points/minute x 40 minutes = 360 points
Therefore, Mike scored a total of 360 points playing ping-pong for 40 minutes."
Response:  To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the cost of 30 days worth of yogurt. Since there are 30 days in a month and Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, the total number of yogurts he will eat in a month is 60 (2 x 30). Therefore, the cost of 1 yogurt = $\$5.00 / 60 = \$0.83$. So, the cost of 30 days worth of yogurt = $\$0.83 \times 30 = \$25.90$. Hence, Terry spends $25.90 on yogurt over 30 days.
Response:  John sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each, so he got $195 ($13 x $15). Then he spent $80 on video games (8 x $20), so he has $195 - $80 = $115 left. Therefore, John still has 13 Lego sets.
Response:  John's average speed is 10 miles per hour.
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information:

1. Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, if she can walk at x miles per hour, she can run at 4x miles per hour.
2. She can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So, if she can run at 4x miles per hour, she can skip at (4x)/2 = 2x miles per hour.
3. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 4x = 12 miles per hour.
4. In six hours, she will have traveled a total distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 12 miles/hour x 6 hours
= 72 miles

So, Dana can travel 72 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking."
"Response:  Let's assume that the age of Ben's iPhone is x years. Since it is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone, which is one year old, we can write:
Ben's iPhone = 2x
Now, according to the problem, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so we can write:
Brandon's iPhone = 4Ben's iPhone
Substituting Ben's iPhone value from the previous equation, we get:
Brandon's iPhone = 4(2x)
Simplifying and solving for x (the age of Brandon's iPhone), we get:
Brandon's iPhone = 8x
Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is eight times as old as Suzy's iPhone, which is one year old. So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"Response:  To determine the maximum distance beyond which Polly can stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to use the information given in the problem.

First, let's find out the maximum distance at which Polly can throw the gold javelin without holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, the distance is 400 feet.

Now, let's find out the additional distance that Polly can cover by holding the sapphire gemstone. As per the problem, the distance increases by 3 times, or 3 x 400 = 1200 feet. So, the total maximum distance beyond which Polly can stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone is:

400 + 1200 = 1600 feet

Therefore, the answer is 1600 feet."
Response:  The number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 7 (5 - 8 = 7).
Response:  To calculate the number of grams of chips that you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories in a single serving of chips, we need to use the following formula: Calories available for snack = Daily calorie target - Total calories consumed so far. In this case, the total calories consumed so far are 1800, and the daily calorie target is 2000. Therefore, the number of grams of chips you can eat is: Number of grams of chips = Calories available for snack / Number of servings per bag x Serving size per bag (in grams) Based on the information provided earlier, there are 5 servings per 300g bag of chips, and each serving contains 250 calories. So, the number of grams of chips you can eat is: Number of grams of chips = 2000 - 1800 = 200 / 5 x 25 = 40 grams.
"Response:  To find out Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making 20 candles and then subtract that from the revenue generated by selling those same candles. Let's do this step by step:

Total cost = Cost of beeswax + Cost of wicks
= $10.00 (beeswax) + $0.50 (wicks) x 20 candles
= $20.00

Revenue = Number of candles sold x Price per candle
= 20 candles x $2.00 per candle
= $40.00

Net Profit = Revenue - Total Cost
= $40.00 - $20.00
= $20.00

Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $20.00."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
* On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote x articles (where x = 5 × 2/5).
* On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means she wrote 2x articles (where x = 5 × 2/5).

Now, we can use the formula for finding the total value of a proportion to find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days:

Total hours = (number of articles written on Monday + number of articles written on Tuesday + number of articles written on Wednesday) / 3

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

Total hours = (5 + x + 2x) / 3
= (8 + 2x) / 3

Simplifying, we get:

Total hours = 6x / 3

So, Meredith spent a total of 6x hours writing articles in the three days."
Response:  The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 16 (80 - 23 = 57).
Response:  Let the number of red ties be x. Then, the number of blue ties is 2x. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the total number of ties bought by John is 2x + x = 3x.  Now, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties, so the cost of one blue tie is $\frac{200}{40} = 5$. Therefore, the cost of one red tie is $\frac{1}{2}$ times the cost of a blue tie, i.e., $\frac{5}{2}$. So, the cost of one red tie is $7.5$.  Thus, John spent $7.5 \times 2x = 15x$ on ties in total.
Response:  To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of wire (4 feet) by the length of each piece (6 inches). This gives us 4 / 6 = 2 pieces. So, Tracy obtained 2 pieces of wire.

Response:  To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs he sells per week. We can do this by multiplying the number of eggs he produces per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). Then, we can multiply the total number of eggs sold per week by the price he charges per dozen to find his total weekly earnings. Here's the calculation: Total number of eggs sold per week = Number of eggs produced per day x 7 Total number of eggs sold per week = 252 eggs/day x 7 = 1804 eggs/week Total number of dollars earned per week = Total number of eggs sold per week x Price per dozen Total number of dollars earned per week = 1804 eggs/week x $2/dozen = $3608 per week Therefore, Lloyd makes $3608 per week on eggs.
"Response:  The time taken by Tom to reach the destination and return will be calculated as follows:

Time taken to reach the destination = Distance / Speed
= 4 miles / 10 miles/hour = 0.4 hours (or 24 minutes)

Time taken to return = Time taken to reach the destination + Time taken to travel back at 6 mph
= 0.4 hours + 0.6 hours (as he travels back at 6 mph)
= 1 hour (or 60 minutes)

Therefore, it takes Tom one hour to get back."
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that the total weight of all the items in his backpack is 15 pounds, and that the comic books weigh 1/4 pound each. So, if he removes 30 comic books, the new weight of the comic books will be 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. This means that the remaining weight in his backpack is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since the toys weigh 1/2 pound each, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 toys to bring the weight of his backpack down to 0 pounds.
Response:  The mechanic earned $240 more on Friday than on Thursday.
"Response:  Let's break this down step by step:

The Doubtfire sisters have 7 adopted kittens.
Mother informs them that Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has 3 x 7 = 21 kittens.

So, in total, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 kittens!"
"Response:  Let's analyze the situation:

Jean has 30 lollipops and he eats 2 of them, so now he has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.
He wants to package 2 lollipops in each bag, so he needs to divide the remaining lollipops by 2.
Number of bags that Jean can fill = Number of lollipops / Number of lollipops per bag
= 28 / 2
= 14 bags
Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops."
Response:  Let's assume that Peter goes to the movies once per week. So, if he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies $\boxed{4}$ times.
Response:  Let x be the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. We know that the total weight of the truck and its contents is less than or equal to 5000 pounds. Therefore, the sum of the weights of all the boxes must be less than or equal to 5000 - (3755 + driver's weight). Now, the weight of a single box is 15 pounds, so the total weight of x boxes is x \* 15 = 15x pounds. Since this is less than or equal to 5000 - (3755 + driver's weight), we have 15x <= 4245. Solving for x, we get x <= 286. So, at most 286 boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

Cost of Construction = $800
Insurance Cost = $80 (10% of $800)
Total Cost = Cost of Material + Cost of Construction + Insurance Cost
= $500 + $800 + $80
= $1460

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1460 for the brooch."
"Response:  Let's assume that Marcy worked for the company for x years and received a total of y pensions throughout her career. Since she became eligible for a pension after 20 years, we can say that x > 20. Also, since she quit after 30 years, we know that x = 30. Therefore, the number of years Marcy worked for the company is equal to 30. Now, let's calculate the total amount of pension she received during those 30 years:

Year 1-20: No pension (since she didn't become eligible until year 20)
Year 21-30: 5% of $50,000 = $2,500 per year (based on the formula provided in the question)
Total pension received over 30 years = $2,500 x 30 = $75,000
So, Marcy's annual pension after working for the company for 30 years is $75,000."
"Response:  The total amount Aleena pays for the streaming service by the end of the year can be calculated as follows:

Initial payment = $140 x (6/12) = $90
Remaining amount = $140 - $90 = $50
Total amount paid = Initial payment + Remaining amount = $90 + $50 = $140
Therefore, by the end of the year, Aleena has paid a total of $140 for the streaming service."
"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total amount of gas left in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling it. We can use the information given in the problem to do this calculation:

Total amount of gas left in tank = 12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons
Distance driven since last filling = 100 miles
So, the number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas is:
8 gallons / 100 miles = 0.08 or 8/100 = 0.08 miles per gallon
Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 8 miles on a single tank of gas."
Response:  If Jim watches TV for 2 hours per day and reads for half as long, he will spend 1 hour reading per day. Since he does this 3 times a week, he will spend 3 x 7 = 21 hours watching TV and 3 x 7 = 21 hours reading in one week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, he will have spent a total of 4 x 21 = 84 hours watching TV and 4 x 21 = 84 hours reading.
"Response:  Total number of people = Number of teams + Number of players + Number of coaches
Total number of people = 4 x (5 + 5) + 4 = 20 + 20 + 4 = 44
Therefore, all the schools have sent 44 people to the tournament."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems.
* There were 175 diamonds in the chest.
* There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies = 175 - 35 = 140.
* Twice the number of emeralds than the rubies means that the number of emeralds = 2 x 140 = 280.

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = 695 gems."
"Response:  Let the number of boys be x. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of girls is 2x. The total number of students is given by 60 + 2x = 130. Now, we have:

Teachers = (Total Students) / (Number of Students per Teacher) = (130) / 5 = 26

Therefore, there are 26 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
Response:  Let's assume that Bailey started with x dollars. Since she received a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, she will have received a total of $40 (x + 40). Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 40 = 100. Solving for x, we get: x = 60. So, Bailey started with $60.
Response:  To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to multiply the number of classes she teaches by the number of students in each class and then multiply that result by the amount she charges per student. So, if she teaches 5 classes on weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday, she will have a total of 5 x 15 + 8 x 15 = 90 classes in one week. And if she charges $15.00 per student, she will make $90 x $15.00 = $1350 in one week.
Response:  To prepare both dishes, Kelian needs to read a total of 40 instructions.
Response:  To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of brownies sold (43) by the price per slice ($3): $$=43\times3=135$$ Similarly, we can multiply the number of cheesecakes sold (23) by the price per slice ($4): $$=23\times4=92$$ Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $135 + $92 = $227.
"Response:  To find out how much Sheila will pay each month for 3 months, we need to calculate the total cost of each phone and then multiply it by the number of months she will be making payments. Let's break down the calculation as follows:

Total cost of one phone = $150 x 3 (months) = $450
Interest charge per phone = $450 x 2% = $9
Total cost of one phone including interest = $450 + $9 = $459
Sheila will buy 5 phones, so the total cost of all phones = 5 x $459 = $2,295
Monthly payment = Total cost / Number of months = $2,295 / 3 = $765
Therefore, Sheila will pay $765 per month for 3 months to own the five cell phones."
Response:  To find out how much Artie will make from selling these flowers, we need to multiply the number of pots sold by the price per pot rounded to the nearest dollar. For marigolds, it would be: Marigold sales = 12 x $1 = $12 For petunias, it would be: Petunia sales = 9 x $0.99 = $8.91 For begonias, it would be: Begonia sales = 17 x $1 = $17 Total sales = $12 + $8.91 + $17 = $37.91 So Artie will make $37.91 from selling these flowers.
"Response:  To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we need to use the information given in the problem. The square footage of each level decreases by half from the previous level. So, if the top level has a square footage of 16, then the second level (which is half the size of the top level) would have a square footage of 8, and so on. Therefore, the average square footage of a level can be calculated as follows:

Average square footage = (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 8

So, the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle is 8 square feet."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* First 180 days: Feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day, so total number of cups = 180 days x 1 cup/day = 180 cups.
* Rest of its life: Feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day, so total number of cups = (365 days - 180 days) x 2 cups/day = 185 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year. Since each bag contains 110 cups, we can divide the total number of cups by the number of cups in each bag to get the answer:

Total number of cups / Number of cups in each bag =...
180 cups + 185 cups / 110 cups/bag =...
= 17 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 17 bags of dog food in the first year."
Response:  Let's assume that Raymond does x pounds of laundry. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, Sarah does 4x pounds of laundry. So, the total amount of laundry done by Sarah is 400 pounds. Now, we know that Sarah does half as much laundry as Raymond, so Raymond does 2x pounds of laundry. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 2x - x = 1x pounds.
"Response:  To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of 18 flowers at each price. At $2.50 per package of 3 flowers, the total cost would be:

$2.50 x 3 = $7.50

At $1 per package of 2 flowers, the total cost would be:

$1 x 9 = $9.00

So, by buying 18 flowers at the better price of $1 per package of 2 flowers, Vincent saves a total of:

$9.00 - $7.50 = $1.50

Therefore, Vincent saves $1.50 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"Response:  If the groomer offers a 30% discount for being a new customer, then the cost of the grooming after the discount is:

Cost of grooming = Original price of grooming x (1 - Discount percentage)
= $100 x (1 - 0.30)
= $70

So, the cost of grooming is $70."
Response:  Total amount of water = 24 liters. After two girls shared it equally, they got 1/6 x 24 = 8 liters each. So, total amount of water left after boys got 6 liters is 24 - 8 - 6 = 10 liters.
Response:  Charlie has 28 stickers left.
Response:  Let's assume that the weight of Grace is x pounds. Then, according to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, so his weight is 4x - 2 pounds. Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is x + (4x - 2) = 5x - 2 pounds.
Response:  Total number of thorns = Number of rose bushes x Number of roses per bush x Number of thorns per rose. In this case, the calculation is as follows: Total number of thorns = 3 x 25 x 8 = 750 thorns. Therefore, there are 750 thorns in total.
Response:  Let the number of games they won be x. Then, the number of games they lost is x - 8. So, we can write an equation: x - (x - 8) = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, the football team won 10 games.
"Response:  Total number of quilt blocks = (Number of years x Number of vacations per year) / 4

Explanation:
Gene has been going on vacations for 11 years (from age 23 to 34). If he goes on 4 vacations per year, then the total number of quilt blocks he has is:
Total number of quilt blocks = 11 x 4 = 44
So, there are 44 quilt blocks in total."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

1. First time the alarm went off, it rang four times.
2. Second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times longer than the first time (i.e., 4 x 3 = 12).
3. Third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time (i.e., 12 / 2 = 6).

Now, let's find out how many times the alarm rang in total:
Total times the alarm rang = Number of times it rang during the first time + Number of times it rang during the second time + Number of times it rang during the third time
= 4 + 12 + 6
= 22

Therefore, the alarm rang 22 times in all."
"Response:  To find out Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the formula given in the question: Salary = Initial Salary x (1 + Increment Percentage) ^ Number of Years of Service.
Initial Salary = $600 (as given in the problem)
Increment Percentage = 10% (as given in the problem)
Number of Years of Service = 3 (as requested in the problem)
So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service can be calculated as follows:
Salary = $600 x (1 + 0.10)^3 = $720
Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $720."
"Response:  Let x be the number of copies Harald sold. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000, so we can set up the equation: Marilyn's sales = 10x; Harald's sales = x. Solving for x, we get: x = 8,800. So Harald sold 8,800 copies."
Response:  To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags she will need based on the number of guests who actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can assume that 4/8 or half of the invited guests will actually attend the party. So, the total number of gift bags needed = (Number of guests x Number of gift bags per guest) / 2 = 16 x 0.75 = 12 gift bags. Therefore, Christina will spend $2 x 12 = $24 on gift bags.
"Response:  To find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed is:

20 x 10 = 200 pounds (for adults) + 5 x 5 = 25 pounds (for children) = 225 pounds

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

1. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets.
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. So, if Cindy has x pets, then Marcia has x + 2 pets.

Now, we can use the information to find out the total number of pets among the three:

Total number of pets = Number of pets with Jan + Number of pets with Marcia - Number of pets with Cindy
= 3x + (x + 2) - 4
= 5x + 2

So, the total number of pets among the three is 5x + 2."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Amy is 5 + 5 = 10 years older than Jackson.
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Corey is 2 - 2 = 0 years older than Amy.
* James is 1 year younger than Corey. So, James is 0 + 1 = 1 year younger than Corey.

Now, we can find out the age of Jackson by using the information provided:

Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy, so Jacksoon is 10 - 5 = 5 years old.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 5 years old."
Response:  Let's assume that Gerald's original time for running the 400-meter hurdles was x seconds. Since Lee used to be able to run it two seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's original time was x - 2 seconds. Now, since Gerald improved his speed by 10%, his new time after changing his diet will be (x - 2) + 10% = x + 10%. So, if Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, then Gerald, with his improved diet, can run it in 38 + 10 = 48 seconds.
Response:  Let's first find out the number of dogs in the neighborhood. According to the problem, the number of dogs is 60 - (12 = 58). So, the number of dogs is 58. Now, we know that for every dog, there are 2 cats. Therefore, the number of cats in the neighborhood is 58 x 2 = 116. Finally, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 58 + 116 = 174.
Response:  Let's first find out how many girls are in the Girl Scouts. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts is 2/3 - x, where x is the total number of girls. So, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts is 160 (200 - 40). Therefore, there are 40 girls who are not in the Girl Scouts.
Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for 2/3 of that, then James slept for 6 hours (since 2/3 of 9 = 6). So, Harry slept for 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James.
"Response:  To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the volume of the sauce by the volume of each tomato. So, if 32 ounces of sauce were made with 16 ounce cans of tomatoes, then:

32 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 2 cans

So, Freda used 2 cans of tomatoes."
"Response:  Let's assume that the time taken by each car to pass through the traffic jam is uniform and equal to x minutes. Since some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we can say that the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is equal to the total number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:

Number of cars that drove through = Total number of cars - Number of cars that took an exit
= 30 - 5
= 25

So, 25 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
Response:  Mary will remain with 36 potted plants after giving away 18 new ones to friends and family.
"Response:  Let's call the number of doorbell rings made by the first friend ""x"". Since the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, the number of doorbell rings made by the second friend is x + (x/4). Similarly, the number of doorbell rings made by the third friend is x + (x/4) + (x/2), and the number of doorbell rings made by the fourth friend is x + (x/4) + (x/2) + 60. Now we can set up an equation using these values: x + (x/4) + (x/2) = x + (x/4) + (x/2) + 60... (1) Substituting the value of x for each friend in turn, we get: x + (x/4) + (x/2) = x + (3x/4) + (2x/2) + 60... (2) Simplifying this equation, we get: 5x + 30 = 60... (3) Solving for x, we find that the total number of doorbell rings was 90. Therefore, the answer is (B) 90."
Response:  To find out the number of pages that Solo needs to read per day, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Solo has 4 days left to complete all his reading, so he will have to read x pages per day where x is the total number of pages he needs to read divided by 4 = 15 + (4 \* 30) / 4 = 60 pages per day. Therefore, Solo needs to read 60 pages per day on average to finish all his reading within 4 days.
Response:  John drinks 7 glasses of water in a week (Monday to Friday).
Response:  Let's first calculate the distance that the fog bank covers per minute: Distance = Speed x Time = 3 miles/minute x 10 minutes = 30 miles. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city: Total distance = Circumference of the city = 42 miles x π = approximately 157.6 miles. Therefore, it will take approximately 157.6 / 30 = 5.25 hours (or 5 hours and 15 minutes) for the fog bank to cover the whole city.
Response:  The number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed = Total number of jigsaw pieces - Number of pieces already placed by Poppy + Number of pieces already placed by her mom = 1000 - (25/4) + (33/3) = 1000 - 83 + 33 = 697 pieces.
Response:  Let's assume that Amir eats x cookies. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, Cody will eat 3x cookies. So, the total number of cookies eaten by both of them is x + 3x = 4x cookies.
"Response:  To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we need to calculate the volume of each box and then add them up.
The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is: Volume = Length x Width x Height
So, the volume of the first box is: Volume of Box 1 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Similarly, the volume of the second box is: Volume of Box 2 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
And the volume of the third box is: Volume of Box 3 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Now, let's add the volumes of all three boxes together to get the total inner volume: Total Inner Volume = Volume of Box 1 + Volume of Box 2 + Volume of Box 3 = 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches = 360 cubic inches
Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic inches."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Every night, Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework.
* On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night. So, he watched 2 x 1 = 2 hours of TV on these days.
* On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Since he watched ""a few"" episodes, let's assume he watched 4 episodes (an arbitrary number). Each episode is 30 minutes long, so he watched 4 x 30 = 120 minutes of TV on Wednesday.
* On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. He watched 1 hour + 30 minutes = 130 minutes of TV on Thursday.
* On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched 2 x 1 = 2 hours of TV.

Total time spent watching TV = 2 + 120 + 130 + 2 = 284 minutes.

So, Frankie watched 4 x 30 = 120 minutes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday."
Response:  Last year, Henry baked 2 x 110 = 220 cookies.
Response:  After getting the cashback reward, the person will pay $2.80 per gallon for the gas, since the cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon. So, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas will be $28.00 ($2.80 x 10 gallons).
"Response:  To find out how much each of them ate on average, we need to divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of roll-ups each person had. Let's do that for Beatrice first:
Beatrice had 24 fruit roll-ups in her container, which is 2 times the width of Marcell's container (since his was only 3 roll-ups wide). So, if Beatrice ate all of hers, she would have eaten 2 x 24 = 48 fruit roll-ups.
Now let's calculate Marcell's average:
Marcell had 14 fruit roll-ups in his container, which is half the length of Beatrice's container (since hers was 24 roll-ups long). So, if Marcell ate all of his, he would have eaten 14 / 2 = 7 fruit roll-ups.
Now, let's add up the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate:
Beatrice ate 48 fruit roll-ups + Marcell ate 7 fruit roll-ups = 55 fruit roll-ups.
So, on average, Beatrice ate 48/2 = 24 fruit roll-ups per person, and Marcell ate 7/1 = 7 fruit roll-ups per person."
Response:  Let's start by using the information given in the problem that the boat takes on 2 L of water for every 10 ft it rows back towards shore. So, if Julia rows 20 ft back towards shore, the boat will take on 2 x 20 = 40 L of water. Now, we know that it takes Julia 16 sec to row 20 ft, so she can row 320 ft (20 x 16) in one minute. Since there are 60 sec in one min, Julia can row 320 x 60 = 19200 ft in one minute. Therefore, the total amount of water the boat has taken on by the time Julia reaches shore is 19200 x 2 = 38400 L.
Response:  The whiteboard will be cleaned 12 times in a day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/day x 3 cleans per lesson = 12).
Response:  Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden. If after 15 days, he has 30 flowers (not including the ones that didn't grow), then the answer is 30.
"Response:  Let x be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, we have:

x = 1800 / 50 = 36

Therefore, there are 36 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo."
"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she has and then subtract the amount she sold it for. Let's do this step by step:

Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x 2 x 4 = $80
Total cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 16 x 4 = $64
Total cost of all lumber = $80 + $64 = $144

Sasha sold 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each, so she made $10 x 2 = $20 from those boards.
She sold 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each, so she made $16 x 5 = $80 from those boards.
In total, Sasha made $20 + $80 = $100 in profit from selling the leftover lumber."
Response:  Let's assume that Katy uses x teaspoonfuls of sugar. Since the ratio is 7:13, for every 7 teaspoonfuls of sugar, there are 13 teaspoonfuls of water. So, the total amount of water used = 120/7 = 17 teaspoonfuls. Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used = x - 17.
Response:  Total amount paid by John = Number of pairs of shoes x Cost per pair = 2 x $60 = $120
"Response:  Let's assume that X is the number of containers imported on the second day. Since there are 30 vehicles in total, we can write an equation based on this information:

X + 2 = 30... (1)

Now, let's use the information given in the problem to find out how many containers contained vehicles on the first day:

If the customs officer at the main port of SeaSide cleared 2 containers of imported vehicles, then the number of vehicles in those containers is:

2 x 5 = 10

So, the total number of vehicles at the port on the first day is:

10 + 30 = 40

Now, we can substitute this value into equation (1):

X + 2 = 40

Solving for X, we get:

X = 38

Therefore, 38 containers were imported on the second day containing a total of 190 vehicles (5 vehicles per container x 38 containers)."
"Response:  Let's assume that Adrien's initial salary was x. Since Adrien's salary is now 40% more than it was four years ago, his current salary is (1 + 0.4)x = 1.4x. Similarly, Lylah's initial salary was y, and her current salary is (1 + 0.4)y = 1.4y. We know that Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, so we can write:

Adrien's salary : Lylah's salary :: 1.4x : 1.2y

Now, we are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can substitute this value in the above equation to get:

$40000 : x :: 1.4x : 1.2y

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = $60000... (1)
y = $50000... (2)

Four years later, both Adrien and Lylah's salaries have increased by 40%, so their new salaries will be:

Adrien's new salary = 1.4x = $84000... (3)
Lylah's new salary = 1.2y = $64000... (4)

Therefore, the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= $84000 + $64000
= $148000"
Response:  To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to divide the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month. So, if Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, he will use 8 pads of paper (2 x 4) in a month. Since each pad has 30 sheets of paper, Miguel will use 240 sheets of paper (8 x 30) in a month.
Response:  Let's first find out how many fruits Morisette brought. Morisette brought 5 apples, so he has 5 x = 20 fruits (since each apple is counted once). Now, let's find out how many fruits Kael brought. Kael brought twice the number of apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x = 10 apples. Since Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, he brought 5/2 = 2.5 oranges (since we can't have a fraction of an orange). So, Kael has 10 + 2.5 = 12.5 fruits in total. Now, let's add up the number of fruits Morisette and Kael have: 20 + 12.5 = 32.5 fruits. Therefore, they have 32.5 fruits in total.
Response:  Total hours = 8 + (2 - 2) + (1 - 2) = 8 + (-4) + 1 = 5 hours
"Response:  To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the total distance she can cover in 7 hours by adding up her running speeds at different times.

Rosie's running speed at time t = x is given by the equation:

Speed = 10 miles/hour + (5 miles/hour) \* (t - 3)

where t is the time in hours and x is the value of time between 3 and 7 hours.

We want to find out the total distance Rosie can cover in 7 hours, so we set up the following equation:

Total Distance = Speed \* Time
= (10 miles/hour + (5 miles/hour) \* (x - 3)) \* 7 hours

Now, we solve for x by substituting the values given in the problem:

Total Distance = (10 miles/hour + (5 miles/hour) \* (x - 3)) \* 7 hours
= 70 miles + (5 miles/hour) \* (x - 3) \* 7 hours

To find out the value of x, we can use the information given in the problem that Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. Therefore, x - 3 = 3 hours.

So, the total distance Rosie can cover in 7 hours is:

Total Distance = 70 miles + (5 miles/hour) \* (3 hours) \* 7 hours
= 490 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run 490 miles in 7 hours."
Response:  Let X be the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she put stamps on 20 letters (since 1/3 × 60 = 20). So, after Jennie began, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is X - 20.
Response:  The number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is equal to the number of spoons that her husband gave her plus the number of spoons that she used to sample her stew. Therefore, there are 3 + 3 = 6 spoons in the package that Julia bought.
Response:  To find out how many sausages Dylan bought in all, we need to add the number of chicken sausages he bought (38) to the number of fish sausages he bought plus six (which is equal to the number of chicken sausages he bought). So, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is: 38 + (6 + 38) = 72 sausages.
Response:  Let's assume that Lily has x friends initially. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, Amy has x + 20 friends. So, the total number of friends they both have together is x + 20 = 50 (as given in the problem). Therefore, Lily and Amy have together x + 20 = 30 friends.
"Response:  The total amount of money Dillon will spend on buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges can be calculated as follows:

Watermelons: 4 x 3 = 12 x 15 = 180
Peppers: 20 x 15 = 300
Oranges: 10 x 15 - 5 = 150
Total amount spent = 180 + 300 + 150 = 630

Therefore, the answer is 630 rupees."
"Response:  To find out how much profit the hospital makes from each visit, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by all the visits in a day. We can then subtract the total cost of providing healthcare services (including doctor's fees) to determine the profit made by the hospital. Here's how we can calculate it:
Total Revenue = Number of Visits per Day x Average Time Per Visit x Charge per Visit
= 500 visitors/day x 24 min/visit x $200/visit
= $1,200,000/day
Now, let's calculate the total cost of providing healthcare services:
Total Cost = Total Revenue x Profit Margin
= $1,200,000/day x ($150/hour - $200/hour)
= $360,000/day
So, the hospital makes a daily profit of $840,000 ($1,200,000 - $360,000).
To find out the yearly profit, we simply multiply this daily profit by the number of days in a year:
Yearly Profit = Daily Profit x Number of Days in a Year
= $840,000/day x 365 days/year
= $307,200,000/year
Therefore, the hospital makes approximately $307 million in profits every year."
Response:  After 30% of the initial workforce (20 elves) quit due to being vomited upon, there are 40 elves left (60 - 20 = 40). Then, when 10 more elves quit after being kicked by children, there are 30 elves left (40 - 10 = 30). Therefore, there are 30 elves left working at the Santa village.
Response:  Total expenditure = $500 + ($60 - $50) = $510
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for that ride.
* Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets for that ride.
* Each of them then rode the luge 2 times, so together they used 2 + 2 = 4 tickets for that ride.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred that day is 12 + 24 + 4 = 30 tickets."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. So, his total distance walked on Monday = 4 miles.
* On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, his total distance walked on Tuesday = 6 x 4 = 24 miles.
* Total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday = 4 + 24 = 28 miles.
* Therefore, Walt walked 28 miles on Wednesday."
Response:  To find out how much Tom pays in a year for the 4 car washes per month, we need to multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each car wash. So, Tom pays $60 ($15 x 4) per month and $720 ($60 x 12) per year.
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. ""Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does."" - This means that if Brian has x video games, then Bobby has x - 5 video games.
2. ""If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made..."" - This means that after losing 5 video games, Brian now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.
3. So, we can write an equation based on the above two statements:
Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does, so Bobby has 3x - 5 video games.
After Brian lost 5 video games, he had 15 video games, so the number of video games Bobby has is equal to 3(15) - 5 = 45 video games.
Therefore, the answer is 45."
Response:  Let's break this problem down step by step! We know that there are 27 unicorns in total and one-third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. So, the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is 9 (27 / 3). Now, we know that two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, which means that the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6 (9 x 2/3). Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.
Response:  To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to add up all the items she is ordering. The cost of two subs is $7.50 x 2 = $15.00, the cost of two bags of chips is $1.50 x 2 = $3.00, and the cost of two cookies is $1.00 x 2 = $2.00. So, the total cost of the items she is ordering is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00. Next, we need to add the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items she is ordering, or $20.00 x 20% = $4.00. Finally, we need to add the tip, which is $5.00. So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $39.00.
Response:  Let's assume that Mark completed x questions in total during both tests. Since he completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions/hour, he completed it in 8 hours = 8x/5 questions. Similarly, since he completed the second test at a rate of 5 questions/hour, he completed it in 6 hours = 6x/5 questions. Now, we can set up the following equation: 8x/5 + 6x/5 = 75 (from the first test) + 100 (from the second test). Solving for x, we get: x = 49. So, Mark left 21 questions incomplete.
Response:  Let's assume that the total number of gumballs in the machine is x. Since there are 4 times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, then the number of pink gumballs is 4x. Therefore, the number of blue gumballs is 12 - 4x. Now we can use the information given in the question to find out the value of x : 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs means that the number of pink gumballs plus 22 is equal to 4 times the number of blue gumballs. So we can write an equation : x + 22 = 4(12). Solving for x, we get x = 56. Therefore, there are 56 blue gumballs and 78 pink gumballs ( since 4x = 104 ).
Response:  The percentage of semi-automatic cars is (4/20) x 100 = 20%.
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There are 700 bees in a hive.
* There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so there are 2 x 150 = 300 worker bees.
* There are twice as many babies as queens, so there are 2 x 50 = 100 baby bees.

So, the total number of bees in the hive is 700 + 300 + 100 = 800 bees."
Response:  To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on video games and then multiply it by his hourly wage from his part-time job. Let's assume that Jordan spends 2 hours per day playing video games. In a week, there are 7 days, so he spends a total of 14 hours (2 x 7) playing video games. If he works 8 hours per day at his part-time job, he will work a total of 56 hours (8 x 7) in a week. Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn $560 ($10/hour x 56 hours).
"Response:  The total cost of the items after the 10% tax on non-food items would be:

* Milk: $2 x (1 - 0.10) = $1.80
* Eggs: $3 x (1 - 0.10) = $2.70
* Light bulbs: $3 x (1 - 0.10) = $2.70
* Cups: $3 x (1 - 0.10) = $2.70
* Roach traps: $4 x (1 - 0.10) = $3.60
Total cost: $15.80

Explanation:
The formula to calculate the cost after taxes is:
Cost = Original price x (1 - Tax rate)
In this case, the original prices are:
Milk: $2
Eggs: $3
Light bulbs: $3
Cups: $3
Roach traps: $4
Tax rate is 10%, so we subtract that amount from each item's original price to get the post-tax price."
"Response:  To find out how much profit Lucas will make each week, we first need to calculate his total income for the week. Since he already has 3 clients and is confident about including the other 5 potential clients in his calculations, let's assume he will have a total of 8 clients for the week. The total amount he will charge for cleaning each client's home is:

Total income = Number of clients x Cost per client
= 8 x ($2 x 2 bottles + $5 x 1 pack)
= 8 x ($40 + $50)
= $360

Next, we need to subtract his total expenses from his total income. His total expenses are:

Total expenses = Number of clients x Cost per client
= 8 x ($2 x 2 bottles + $5 x 1 pack)
= 8 x ($40 + $50)
= $360

So, his profit for the week is:

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
= $360 - $360
= $0

Therefore, Lucas will not make any profit each week."
"Response:  To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to multiply the number of hectares he has by the number of pineapples per hectare and then divide it by the time interval between harvests (in this case, 3 months). So, the answer is:

Number of pineapples = Number of hectares x Number of pineapples per hectare / Time interval between harvests
= 10 x 100 / 3
= 3333 pineapples
Therefore, John can harvest approximately 3333 pineapples within a year."
"Response:  Let's first find out how many pieces are in each of the Lego sets:

Set 1 (500 pieces): x = 500
Set 2 (3x pieces): x = 3 \* 500 = 1500
Set 3 (1/4 the number of pieces as Set 1): x = 1/4 \* 500 = 125

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces picked up by Johnny:
Total pieces = x + 125 + 1500 = 1725

Therefore, Johnny picks up 1725 Legos in total."
Response:  Let x be the number of bees that left the hive during the first 6 hours. Since twice as many bees left after that, the number of bees that left during the last 6 hours is 2x. Now, since every bee that had left earlier than that returned to the hive, the total number of bees that returned is also 2x. So, the answer is 4x.
Response:  Brittany's mom gave the cashier $10 (adult ticket) + $10 (child ticket) = $20. So, she gave the cashier $20 in dollars.
Response:  Let's assume that the number of friends of Charlie is x. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, James's number of friends can be calculated as 4x. Now, we know that Charlie has 12 friends, so x + 4x = 12. Simplifying and solving for x, we get x = 6. Therefore, James has 24 friends on Facebook.
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Steve has traveled when Tim catches up to him. We know that Steve travels at a rate of 440 feet per minute, which means he covers an area equal to 440 feet x minutes = distance = 440 x min. Since Tim takes less time to reach Steve's house, he covers a shorter distance. So, the distance covered by Tim is given by: Distance = Speed x Time taken = 264 ft/min x (time taken - Steve's time) Where 'Steve's time' is the time it took Steve to cover the distance to his house. Now, we are asked to find out how much longer the winner will have to wait at their house before the loser finishes the race. This can be found by subtracting the time taken by the loser (Tim) from the total time taken by both the racers: Total time = Winner's time + Loser's time = (Home-School) + (School-Home) = Home-School + School-Home = 3 miles + 2 miles = 5 miles Therefore, the winner will have to wait for 5 miles / 440 feet/minute = 11.4 minutes at their house before the loser finishes the race.
Response:  To find out how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the cost of inflating each tire and then multiply it by the number of tires inflated. For the bicycles, each tire costs $0.25, so 5 tires x $0.25 = $1.25. For the tricycles, each tire costs $0.25, so 3 tires x $0.25 = $0.75. And for the unicycle, since there is only one tire, the cost is $0.25. Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25.
Response:  The total cost of the cookies is 6 x 10 = $60. Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, he will receive $60 - $10 = $50 in change.
"Response:  Let's break this problem into smaller parts to solve it step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 French fries before the seagull stole the pack. So, there were 14 - 1 = 13 French fries left in the pack.
2. The seagull ate half of the remaining fries, which is 13 / 2 = 6 French fries.
3. Three pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 French fries. So, the total number of French fries eaten by the pigeons is 3 x 3 = 9 French fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (13 / 3) = 4 French fries.
5. Ants carried off one French fry, leaving 5 French fries behind.

So, when Dave bought the pack of French fries, there were 13 French fries inside. After all these events occurred, there were only 5 French fries left in the pack."
"Response:  To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he attends classes per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Weekly attendance:
Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 3 x 1 hour = 3 hours/week
Tuesday, Thursday: 2 x 2 hours = 4 hours/week
Total weekly attendance: 3 + 4 = 7 hours/week

Semester duration: 16 weeks
Total hours attended in a semester: 7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 112 hours attending classes in a semester."
Response:  Let's first calculate the total length of all the baked goods that Bill makes per day: Rolls = 300 x 4 = 1200 inches Croissants = 120 x 6 = 720 inches Baguettes = 60 x 2 = 120 inches Total length = 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches Now, since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length from inches to feet: Total length (in feet) = 2040 / 12 = 167 feet So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they would be approximately 167 feet long.
"Response:  To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo over a period of 2 months.

Total number of bananas needed = Number of bananas needed by each ape x Number of months
= 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, he needs to order half of the total number of bananas needed over a period of 2 months. Therefore, he needs to order:

Half of 700 bananas = 350 bananas

So, the zookeeper needs to order 350 bananas to last for 2 months."
Response:  The distance between the start and finish lines of the football field is 100 yards = 91.4 meters (using the conversion factor of 1 yard = 0.914 meters). Since Blake ran 15 times back and forth across the field, his total distance covered is 15 x 91.4 = 1366 meters. Kelly, on the other hand, ran from the 20-yard line (which is halfway between the start and finish lines) to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of 80 yards + 80 yards = 160 yards. So, the winner (Blake) ran a total distance of 1366 meters, while the loser (Kelly) ran a distance of 160 yards x 2 = 320 meters. Therefore, the winner runs approximately 1046 meters more than the loser.
Response:  To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to add the cost of all the items he bought. The total cost is: 4 x $1.5 = $6 + 2 x $4 = $8 + $20 = $34 So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the new depth would be 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the new depth would be (24 / 3) = 8 feet.
Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 8 feet."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:
Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 5 - 10 = -5 starfish.
Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 6 - 6 = 0 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 3 + 3 = 6 clownfish.
So, the total number of fish that both Anakin and Locsin caught is:
10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 6 (clownfish) = 22 fish."
"Response:  After 36 months, if the price of a bag of marbles increases by 20% of the original price every two months, then the new price of a bag of marbles can be calculated as follows:

Price after 1 month = Original price x (1 + 20%)
= $20 x (1 + 0.2)
= $24

Price after 2 months = Price after 1 month x (1 + 20%)
= $24 x (1 + 0.2)
= $28.80

Price after 3 months = Price after 2 months x (1 + 20%)
= $28.80 x (1 + 0.2)
= $33.79

Price after 4 months = Price after 3 months x (1 + 20%)
= $33.79 x (1 + 0.2)
= $40.59

Price after 5 months = Price after 4 months x (1 + 20%)
= $40.59 x (1 + 0.2)
= $48.79

Price after 6 months = Price after 5 months x (1 + 20%)
= $48.79 x (1 + 0.2)
= $57.19

Price after 7 months = Price after 6 months x (1 + 20%)
= $57.19 x (1 + 0.2)
= $65.69

Price after 8 months = Price after 7 months x (1 + 20%)
= $65.69 x (1 + 0.2)
= $74.39

Price after 9 months = Price after 8 months x (1 + 20%)
= $74.39 x (1 + 0.2)
= $83.29

Price after 10 months = Price after 9 months x (1 + 20%)
= $83.29 x (1 + 0.2)
= $92.49

Price after 1"
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The total number of toys = 5 + 3 = 8
* The cost of each red car = $4
* The cost of each action figure = $5
* The cost of the doll = as much as 3 action figures and one red car (let's call it x)

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys:

Total cost of red cars = 8 x $4 = $32
Total cost of action figures = 3 x $5 = $15
Total cost of the doll = x

So, the total value of all the toys is:
$32 + $15 + x =?

Can you find the answer now?"
"Response:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring an accountant, we need to calculate the value of the time she would spend doing her own taxes and compare it to the cost of the accountant's services. Let's start by calculating the value of the time Jackie would spend on her taxes:

Time spent on taxes = Freelance rate x Time spent on taxes (in hours)
= $35/hour x 3 hours
= $105

Now, let's subtract this amount from the total cost of the accountant's services:

Cost of accountant - Value of time saved
= $90 - $105
= -$15

So, by hiring an accountant, Jackie will actually end up spending more money than if she did her taxes herself! However, there are other benefits to hiring an accountant, such as saving time and reducing stress, which may make it worthwhile for Jackie to consider hiring one despite the additional cost."
Response:  To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the cost of all the accessories from her total budget. So, if her total budget is €1500 and she spends €1090 on the computer, then she will have €410 left (€1500 - €1090 = €410). If she spends another €157 on the scanner, €74 on the CD burner, and €102 on the printer, then she will have €283 left (€410 - €157 + €74 + €102 = €283) for her clothing.
Response:  Babysitting is done 4 times.
Response:  Let's assume that Seth's age is 'S'. Then, Brooke's age can be represented as 'B = S - 2'. According to the problem statement, in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write an equation: B + S = 28... (1) Now, substituting B = S - 2 from the given information, we get: S + (S - 2) = 28... (2) Simplifying equation (2), we get: 2S = 26 Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us: S = 13 Therefore, Seth is 13 years old.
"Response:  Let's assume that Ethel has x dollars. Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, we can write an equation as follows:
Jimmy = 2x + 2
Now, we are given that Ethel has 8 dollars, so we can substitute this value in the equation:
Jimmy = 2x + 2 = 2(8) + 2 = 16
Therefore, Jimmy has 16 dollars."
Response:  To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total number of miles he walks during the weekdays and then add that to the total number of miles he walks on weekends. Let's assume it takes him 5 days to complete his daily walk of 20 miles, so he walks for 100 miles (20 x 5) during the weekdays. On weekends, he walks for 10 miles per day, so he walks for 40 miles (10 x 4) during the weekend days. Therefore, the total distance Pancho walks in a week is: Total distance = Weekday distance + Weekend distance = 100 + 40 = 140 miles.
"Response:  Let's break down the cost of each component of the uniform:

* Hat: $25
* Jacket: $3x$25 = $75
* Pants: ($25 + $75)/2 = $40

So, the total cost of each uniform is: $25 + $75 + $40 = $130."
Response:  To find out how many legs Jake sees total, we need to add up the number of legs on all the creatures he saw. The spiders have 8 legs each, so that's 8 x 80 = 640 legs from the spiders alone. The insects have 6 legs each, so that's 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. And there are 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 legs from those. Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Granny Red is 3 years younger than Sally Two.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red is 2 x (Sally Four - 8) = 2(40) = 80 years old.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. So, Sally Four is 32 years old.

Now, let's find the total age of the four birds:

Granny Red + Sally Two + Sally Four + Sally Thirtytwo =?
= 80 + 3 + 32 + 32 = 157 years old.

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 157 years old."
Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month and then multiply it by 12. Let's start by calculating the total amount Jessica pays each month: Minimum payment for student loans = $300 Minimum payment for credit card = $200 Minimum payment for mortgage = $500 Total minimum payments per month = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000 Now, let's see how much Jessica pays if she pays 50% more than the minimum: Amount paid above minimum = $1000 x 50% = $500 So, Jessica pays $1000 plus $500 = $1500 per month. Therefore, Jessica pays $1500 x 12 = $18,000 per year.
"Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that it takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato (1 min 15 sec) and about 5 seconds to cut it up. Since there are 60 potatoes to prepare, we can use these times to calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping them all.

Total time = Number of potatoes x Time per potato
= 60 x (1 min 15 sec + 5 sec)
= 60 x 1 min 20 sec
= 36 minutes

So, it will take Billy approximately 36 minutes to finish prepping all 60 potatoes for his big family reunion barbecue."
Response:  Let's first calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3/gallon, and the cost of sugar is $2/gallon. So, the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade = $3 + $2 = $5/gallon. Now, we know that Juan and Carlos sold 20 glasses per gallon, so they sold a total of 20 x $5 = $100 worth of lemonade. Since they made a profit of $25, their expenses (i.e., the cost of lemons) must be less than $100. Therefore, the amount spent on lemons = $100 - $25 = $75.
Response:  We are given that there are 240 people in total who are Asian. Of these, 80 are Japanese and the remaining are Chinese. This means that the number of Chinese is equal to 240 - 80 = 160. Since 60 of them are boys, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 160 - 60 = 100.
"Response:  To find out how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations, we need to first calculate the total amount that he spends each month. We can do this by adding up all of the amounts that he spends or gives away.

Rent = 1/4 x $6000 = $1500
Car fuel = 1/3 x $6000 = $2000
Donation = Half of ($6000 - $1500 - $2000) = $3500
Money given to daughter = $200
Money given to wife = $700
Total amount spent or given away = $1500 + $2000 + $3500 + $200 + $700 = $8500

So, Zaid has $6000 - $8500 = $3500 left over after all of his expenses and donations."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, which means Rani has x crabs and Monic has x - 10 crabs.
Bo has 4 fewer crabs than Monic, which means Bo has x - (4) crabs.
Total number of crabs = Rani + Monic + Bo = x + (x - 10) + (x - 4) = 3x - 14
So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 3 times Rani's crabs minus 14."
Response:  For the first two weeks, Lloyd earned a total of $40 ($10/hour x 5 hours + $10/hour x 8 hours).
Response:  Let X be the number of votes received by the loser. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, the number of votes received by the winner is 3X/4. Therefore, we can write an equation: 3X/4 = 72 (since there were 80 students who voted). Solving for X, we get X = 16. So, the loser got 16 votes.
Response:  Let's first calculate the total number of flowers that Sandra needs for her orders: Red roses = 4 x (total number of flowers) White carnations = 200 / 5 = 40 Pink calla lilies = 5 x (total number of flowers) Total flowers needed = Red roses + White carnations + Pink calla lilies = 4 x (total number of flowers) + 40 + 5 x (total number of flowers) = 4x(total number of flowers) + 130 Now, we need to find out what time it is by when Fred can deliver the missing red roses and still meet Sandra's deadline of 5 pm. Let's assume it takes 2 hours to deliver the flowers from the time they are picked up until they reach Sandra's shop. So, if Fred picks up the red roses at 3 pm, he will arrive at Sandra's shop at 5 pm (since it takes 2 hours to get there). Therefore, Fred must deliver 4 x (total number of flowers) red roses by 3 pm in order to meet Sandra's deadline of 5 pm.
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's age = Mark's age + 2.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, Mark's age at that time = Half of Jan's age + 5.
3. Now, we know that Jan's current age is 30 years. So, Half of Jan's age = 15 years (since Jan is 30 years old and half of 30 is 15).
4. Therefore, Mark's age two years ago = 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
5. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age = 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

So, Jean is 22 years old."
Response:  To solve this problem we need to find out the total time taken by both teams to complete the race. Let's assume that the slower team takes x seconds to complete their race. Since they start with a disadvantage of 3 seconds per runner, the fastest runner will take 55 seconds to complete his/her leg, and each subsequent runner will take 3 seconds less than the previous one. Therefore, the slowest runner will take 52 seconds (55 - 3) to complete his/her leg, the second slowest runner will take 51 seconds (55 - 6), and so on. Now, let's calculate the total time taken by the slower team: Time taken by slower team = Time taken by first runner + Time taken by second runner +... + Time taken by fourth runner = 60 + 51 + 50 + 49 = 270 seconds. Similarly, the faster team will take 55 seconds to complete their race, since all their runners will finish their legs in exactly 55 seconds. So, the total time taken by the faster team is also 270 seconds. Now, to find out the difference between the times taken by the two teams, we can subtract the time taken by the slower team from the time taken by the faster team: Difference = Time taken by faster team - Time taken by slower team = 270 - 270 = 0 seconds. Therefore, there is no difference in the times taken by the two teams.
"Response:  Let's analyze the probability of each event separately:

Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 6 - 3 / 6
= 2/3

Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 0 / 6 (since there are no even numbers in a row)
= 0%

Now, to find the relative probability, we need to divide the probability of Event 1 by the probability of Event 2:
Relative probability = Probability of Event 1 / Probability of Event 2
= 2/3 / 0
= 6

So, the relative probability of rolling a number greater than 3 compared to not rolling two even numbers in a row is 6 times higher (or 50%)."
Response:  Let's assume that Jenna picked x apples. Since her mother picked 20 apples, the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother is 20 + x = 40. So, Jenna picked 20 apples.
Response:  Let's first calculate the total number of small rodents in all three cages: Number of rats = Total number of small rodents / Number of cages = 160/3 = 53 Each cage has 53 rats.
"Response:  To find out the amount that Mandy needs to pay to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount due including principal and interest.

Total Amount Due = Principal + Interest
= $100 + (2% x $100) x 3/12
= $100 + ($2 x $100) / 12
= $100 + $8.33
= $108.33

Therefore, Mandy needs to pay $108.33 to Benedict after 3 months."
Response:  Let's first calculate the total cost of transportation for all the bags: Transportation cost = Number of bags x Cost per bag = $2 x Total number of bags = $2T Where T is the total number of bags sold. Now, let's use the information given in the problem to find T: Profit = Selling price - Cost = $30 - ($2 x Total number of bags) = $30 - $4T We can simplify this equation by substituting the expression we derived for T: $30 - $4T = $400 Subtracting $400 from both sides gives us: $T = $100 So, the trader sold 100 bags of wheat.
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The total cost of the tickets is $20.25.
2. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. Each friend paid an equal amount for the tickets and food, so each friend paid $15.75 / 3 = $5.25 for the tickets and $5.25 + $15.75 = $20.95 for the food.

Therefore, each friend paid a total of $20.95."
Response:  John collects 3 x 2 = 6 peaches in 3 hours.
Response:  To find out how much food the duck needs in one day, we can multiply the amount of food needed per week by seven (since there are seven days in a week). So, if the ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects per week, then they will need 24.5 pounds of insects per day (3.5 x 7 = 24.5).
"Response:  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

Year 1:
Tom plants 10 trees, so he has 50 trees (the initial number).

Year 2-10:
Tom continues to plant 10 trees each year, so he now has 50 + 10 x 9 = 450 trees.

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die, which is equal to 135 trees (since 30% of 450 is 135). So, Tom now has 450 - 135 = 315 trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 315 trees left."
"Response:  Let's first count the total number of flamingos:

Friday Morning: 18 pink flamingos
Saturday Morning: 12 (3/4) x 18 = 12 white flamingos
Sunday Morning: 18 + 18 = 36 new pink flamingos
Total Number of Flamingos: 18 + 12 + 36 = 66 flamingos
Now, let's find out how many more pink flamingos are there than white flamingos:
Number of Pink Flamingos - Number of White Flamingos = 66 - 12 = 54 more pink flamingos
Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 54 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
Response:  To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to subtract the cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has. In this case, the cost of the crayons is $2 x 5 = $10, so Violetta will get $20 - $10 = $10 in change.
"Response:  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. So, the total cost of one pen is equal to the cost of one pencil + the cost of one eraser.

The cost of one pencil = $1.20
The cost of one eraser = $0.30

So, the total cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, let's find out how much 8 pens will cost:

Total cost of 8 pens = $1.50 x 8 = $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
Response: 196 pounds
Response:  Let's first find out how many males and females are in Soda. There are 8417 males and 9092 females in Soda. Now, we know that the total number of inhabitants in Soda is 23786. So, the number of children in Soda can be calculated as follows: Total number of inhabitants - Number of males + Number of females = 23786 - 8417 + 9092 = 15377. Therefore, there are 15377 kids in Soda.
"Response:  Let's break this down step by step:

Month 1: Elaine has 20 Pokémon cards.

Month 2: Elaine collects 3 times as many cards as she had in Month 1, so she gets 60 new cards (3 x 20 = 60). Now, she has 80 cards in total (20 + 60 = 80).

Month 3: Elaine collects half as many cards as she did in Month 2, so she gets 30 new cards (half of 60 = 30). Now, she has 110 cards in total (80 + 30 = 110).

Therefore, Elaine has 110 Pokémon cards in total."
Response:  Let's say the total number of sentences edited by Mark is x. Since Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, he makes 5x cents from Publisher A. Now, since Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, Mark makes 2(5x) = 10x cents from Publisher B. So, his total earnings are 5x + 10x = 15x cents.
"Response:  To find out the total amount of water that Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the number of liters of water he gets in the morning and then add it to the number of liters of water he gets in the afternoon. Let's do this step by step:

Morning:
Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning, so he gets 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning.

Afternoon:
Baldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon, so he gets 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in the afternoon.

Total daily water supply:
Adding the number of liters of water Baldur gets in the morning and afternoon gives us a total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water per day.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"Response:  To find out how much money John made that year, we need to calculate his total earnings from January 1st to December 31st. Since he makes $2000 per week, his total earnings for the year will be:

$2000 x 52 weeks = $104,000

So, John made $104,000 that year."
"Response:  To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of acres she has by the amount of grapes produced per acre. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and there are 10 acres in total, we can calculate the total number of tons of grapes as follows:

10 acres x 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes per year

Now, since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total number of barrels of wine produced as follows:

50 tons of grapes x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Response:  To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add up all the amounts of cheese he consumed throughout the week. Let's do that:

* Sandwiches: 7 days x 2 slices/day = 14 slices of cheese
* Omelets: 3 days x 1 slice/day + 1 extra slice/day = 6 slices of cheese
* Macaroni and cheese: 1 dish x 8 slices/dish = 8 slices of cheese

Adding these amounts together gives us a total of 28 slices of cheese that Carl used during the week."
Response:  Let's first find out how many pens Janet had before buying the new pens. She had 22 green pens + 10 yellow pens = 32 pens. Now, let's count the number of pens she bought: 6 bags of blue pens x 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens + 2 bags of red pens x 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens = 66 pens total. So, Janet has 32 + 66 = 98 pens now.
Response:  To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we can use the formula for calculating a weighted average: Average = (sum of all scores x weight) / (number of scores). In this case, the sum of all scores is 455 (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86), and the number of scores is 6. So, if Brinley gets a score of X on the sixth test, her new average will be: Average = (455 x 6/6) / 6 = 93. Since there are only six scores, we don't need to include any weights or multipliers in our calculation.
Response:  Total distance = (5 x 25) + (2 x 60) = 150 + 120 = 270 kilometers
Response:  Let's first find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, the weight of one chocolate bar is 2 x 40 = 80 g. Now, there are 25 chocolate bars in total, so their total weight is 25 x 80 = 2000 g. Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples in total, and each one weighs 40 g, so their total weight is 80 x 40 = 3200 g. Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2000 + 3200 = 5200 g.
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Rose went to the store and bought 4 cakes. So, the total number of cakes she bought on Monday is 4.
* On Tuesday, Rose went to a different store and bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, if she bought 4 cakes on Monday, then she bought 12 cakes (3 x 4) on Tuesday.
* On Wednesday, Rose went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, if she bought 12 cakes on Tuesday, then she bought 60 cakes (5 x 12) on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of cakes Rose bought on each day:

Monday: 4 cakes
Tuesday: 12 cakes
Wednesday: 60 cakes

So, in total, Rose bought 76 cakes (4 + 12 + 60)."
Response:  Let x be the number of cups. Then, we know that the total cost of buying all these cups is equal to $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. So, we can write an equation as follows: $\boxed{6x + 1200 = 3(6000)}$. Now, solve for x using algebraic manipulation and simplify your answer.
Response:  Let X be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. We know that after mowing the lawn X times, Sara has $X + $10 = $70 (since she already had $10 saved). Now, we need to find out how much money Sara will have after buying the jacket and shoes. The total cost of the jacket and two pairs of shoes is $30 + ($2 x 2) = $60. So, if Sara wants to afford these items, she needs to mow the lawn at least X = 60 / $4 = 15 times.
Response:  Let's assume that Jerry has x red chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(2) = 10 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42 eggs/day - 10 eggs/day = 32 eggs/day. Now, we are given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. So, if Jerry has x red chickens, then he has x + 2 white chickens. Substituting this value in the equation above, we get 3x - 10 = 32, which simplifies to x = 18. Hence, Jerry has 18 red chickens.
Response:  To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to divide the distance he covers (the perimeter of the park) by his speed (3 miles/hour). So, we can calculate it as follows: Perimeter of the park = 1.5 x 6 = 9 miles Distance covered by Gary = Perimeter of the park / Speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours Therefore, Gary spends 3 hours walking around the edge of the local park.
Response:  Let's use algebra to solve this problem! We know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, there were 50 more customers, so she counted 150 customers (100 + 50). On the third day, there were 50 more customers than the second day, so she counted 200 customers (150 + 50). Therefore, Sloane counted 200 customers on the third day.
"Response:  Let's assume that the amount of water in the small pool is x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool initially, the amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons. Now, since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the big pool is 4x gallons. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 4(x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x = 4x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1 gallon

So, the small pool currently has 1 gallon of water."
"Response:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage. In this case, the total cost is $352 ($320 + $32), and her hourly wage is $8. So, Lori would need to work for:

$352 / $8 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours to afford the shoes and belt."
"Response:  Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Total amount borrowed = $2000
2. Additional amount to be paid as interest = 10% of $2000 = $200
3. Monthly payment amount = $165
4. Number of months to repay = 12 months

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance after each month:

Month 1:
Remaining balance = Total amount borrowed - Monthly payment amount = $2000 - $165 = $1835

Month 2:
Remaining balance = Remaining balance from previous month + Monthly payment amount = $1835 + $165 = $1990

And so on...

By the end of the 12th month, the total amount paid will be:
Total amount paid = Monthly payment amount x Number of months paid = $165 x 12 = $2000

So, the remaining balance at the end of 12 months will be:
Remaining balance = Total amount borrowed - Total amount paid = $2000 - $2000 = $0

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be zero."
Response:  Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias = 4 + (7 - 4) = 15
"Response:  Let A be the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after 3 years. According to the problem, Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age = 3H. Similarly, Zack's age = H/2, where H is Harriet's current age. Now we have the following equations:
A = 3H + H/2 = 21 + (H/2)
Solving for H, we get:
H = 63
Now substituting H into any of the above equations, we can find A:
Adrian's age = 3(63) = 189
Harriet's age = 63
Zack's age = 63/2 = 31.5
Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after 3 years will be 189, 63, and 31.5 respectively."

Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle. For the crossword puzzles, it took her 10 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 10 x 3 = 30 minutes solving those puzzles. For the sudoku puzzles, it took her 5 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 5 x 8 = 40 minutes solving those puzzles. Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
Response:  The amount of water in the tank before Celine took any water is 120 liters. After she took 90 liters of water, the remaining amount of water in the tank is 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30). Then, when she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, the new amount of water in the tank is 60 liters (30 x 2 = 60). So, there are 60 liters of water in the tank now.

So, Chad owes $7.75."
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Kalinda and her mom to add one piece each. Let's assume that Kalinda adds 4 pieces in 1 minute. Then, she adds 4 x 60 = 240 pieces in 1 hour. Similarly, her mom adds half as many pieces, i.e., 240 / 2 = 120 pieces in 1 hour. Now, the total number of pieces they add in 1 hour is 240 + 120 = 360 pieces. Therefore, it will take them 360/4 = 90 minutes (or 1.5 hours) to complete the puzzle.
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
* After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, which means 36 watermelons (30% of 120) were ready.
* Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which means 24 watermelons (3/4 of 36) were ready.
* So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 36 - 24 = 12 watermelons."
"Response:  To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars first. The total cost of 12 cars is:

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Then, Mark pays 10% tax on the total cost of the cars, which is:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

Finally, Mark pays an additional $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars, so the total amount he pays for registration is:

$240,000 x 12 = $28,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

$24,000 + $28,000 = $52,000"
Response:  Let's assume that Kylie collected x shells on Monday. Since Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, we can say that Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collected x + 5 shells on Monday. Now, on Tuesday, since Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday, she collected (x + 5) × 2 = 2(x + 5) shells on Tuesday. Therefore, Kylie collected 2x + 10 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  Let's assume that the number of bugs in the garden is x. Since Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, the number of ants in the garden is 50/2 = 25 ants. So, the number of bugs in the garden is x - 25 = 3x/2 bugs. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 3x/2 + 25 = (3x)/2 + 25 bugs.
"Response:  Total number of penguins = 36

One third of them jumped in and swam in the ocean = 12 (since there are 36 penguins, if one-third jumps in, then it is 36 / 3 = 12)

Another one-third went inside the cave to eat their dinner = 12 (again, since there are 36 penguins, if another one-third goes inside the cave, then it is 36 / 3 = 12)

So, the total number of penguins still sunbathing = 36 - (12 + 12) = 9

Therefore, 9 penguins are still left sunbathing."
Response:  To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to find out how many tomatoes the vine can produce in one week. The question states that the vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. So, if Steve wants to eat 6 tomatoes per day, he will need 6/3 = 2 vines to provide him with enough tomatoes. Therefore, Steve needs 2 vines.
Response:  John needs to order 5 pizzas.
"Response:  Total number of pens = Number of pens used for making new pens x Number of pens saved by mixing ink = 25 x (4/5) = 16

Explanation:
Ram has 25 pens initially. When the ink runs low in each pen, he mixes the ink from five pens to make one full pen. Since there are 5 pens per batch, he can make 5 x 5 = 25 new pens using the mixed ink. So, after mixing the ink, he has 25 - 25 = 0 new pens left. Therefore, the total number of pens he gets is 25."
Response:  After a year, Johnny had $30 x 3 = $90.
"Response:  Let's assume the age of each girl as follows:
Mary - 2 + x (where x is the current age of Jessa)
Joan - 5 + x
Jessa - 20
Now, we need to find the value of 'x'. We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age = Joan's age - 2. Substituting this in the equation for Mary's age, we get:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
= 5 + x - 2
Now, we know that Jessa is five years older than Joan, so Jessa's age = Joan's age + 5. Substituting this in the equation for Jessa's age, we get:
Jessa's age = Joan's age + 5
= 5 + x + 5
Now, we have three equations and three variables. Solving them simultaneously, we get:
x = 15
So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
Mary's age = 2 + 15 = 17
Joan's age = 5 + 15 = 20
Jessa's age = 20 + 5 = 25"
"Response:  Let X be the total number of students who went out through all three exits (A, B, and C). According to the problem, 30% of the students went out through exit A, so the number of students who went out through exit A is 30%. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit A = 30%.
Now, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, so the number of students who went out through exit B = 3/5 × (100 - 30) = 60.
Therefore, the total number of students who went out through exits A and B = 30 + 60 = 90.
So, the number of students who went out through exit C = 100 - 90 = 10."
Response:  Let's assume that James has x candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, John has 2x candies. Now, we know that John has 54 candies, so we can write the equation: 2x = 54. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. Therefore, John has 27 more candies than James.
"Response:  By the end of this activity, Dolly and Pandora will have read a total of 3 books between them. Here is how I arrived at that answer:
1. Dolly has 2 books, so she reads 2 books initially.
2. Pandora has 1 book, so she reads 1 book initially.
3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books, which means they read an additional 2 + 1 = 3 books altogether.
Therefore, the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora together is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 books."
"Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to first calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Since each person sends 2 letters per week and each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages Mike writes per week is:

5 pages/letter x 2 letters/week = 10 pages/week

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes Mike to write one page. As you mentioned, he can write a page every 6 minutes, so:

1 page/6 minutes = 0.17 minutes/page

Now, let's multiply the total number of pages Mike writes per week by the time it takes him to write one page:

10 pages/week x 0.17 minutes/page = 1.7 minutes/week

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

1.7 minutes/week x 60 minutes/hour = 10.2 hours/week

Therefore, Mike spends approximately 10.2 hours per week writing letters to his pen pals."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.
* He has already used 300 minutes of calls this month (to other people).
* There are 30 days in this month.

Now, let's calculate how many minutes Jason has left:

Total minutes available = Phone plan (1000) - Used minutes (300)
= 1000 - 300
= 700 minutes

So, Jason has 700 minutes left for the rest of the month."
"Response:  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 French fries initially.
2. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 French fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, i.e., 2 × 5 = 10 French fries.
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which is equal to 5 French fries (since she had 20).
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which means he took 3 fewer than 10 French fries. So, Colby took 10 - 3 = 7 French fries.
6. In total, Griffin lost 5 + 10 - 3 = 8 French fries.
7. Therefore, Griffin had 27 - 8 = 19 French fries at the end.
8. Since Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which is equal to 5 French fries, we can conclude that Ginger gave Griffin 5 French fries."
"Response:  Let's assume that the number of fish in Aquarium A is x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, the number of snails in Aquarium B is 2x.
Now, we know that there are 4 snails in Aquarium A and 32 snails in Aquarium B, so we can write:
Aquarium A: 4 snails
Aquarium B: 2x snails
We also know that the total number of snails in both aquariums is equal to the sum of the number of snails in each aquarium, so we can write:
Total Snails = 4 + 2x
Substituting the value of x from the problem statement, we get:
Total Snails = 4 + 2(32)
Total Snails = 80
Therefore, there are 80 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup services over the duration of the movie shoot.

Total Cost = Number of Hours x Rate per Hour
= 6 x $250
= $1500

Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, we subtract that amount from the total cost:
Discounted Total Cost = Total Cost - Discount Percentage x Total Cost
= $1500 - ($1500 x 10%)
= $1350

Therefore, Jean paid $1350 for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot."
Response:  Each person paid $79 / 3 = $26.33.
Response:  The chef spent a total of $600.
Response:  Let's first find out how many cookies Sue ate in total. We know that on Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies. Therefore, Sue ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Now, we need to find out how many calories Sue consumed compared to her sister. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.
