Response:  The time taken by the train to reach its destination is given by the equation: Time = Distance / Speed Where: - Distance = 10 miles (given) - Speed = 1-4 mph (varying between 1 and 4 mph) So, we need to find out how much time it takes for the train to cover 6 miles at each speed. Let's assume that the train travels at a constant speed of x mph for 6 miles. Then, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed = 6 miles / x mph Now, we have to find out what value of x gives us the desired time. For example, if we want to know how long it will take for the train to reach its destination if it travels at a speed of 2 mph for 6 miles, we can plug in the values as follows: Time = 6 miles / 2 mph = 3 hours Therefore, the train will take 3 hours to cover 6 miles at a speed of 2 mph. Similarly, if the train travels at a speed of 4 mph for 6 miles, it will take 2 hours to cover that distance.

"Response:  The maximum number of trucks that can be loaded with 5000 pounds or more without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 42 trucks. Here's how we arrived at this answer:

The bridge has a total capacity of 3755 pounds, and each truck has a weight of 15 pounds per gallon. To determine the maximum number of trucks that can be loaded without exceeding the weight limit, we need to divide the total capacity of the bridge by the weight of each truck:

Maximum number of trucks = Total capacity of bridge / Weight of each truck
= 3755 pounds / 15 pounds per gallon
= 250 trucks

However, since we are looking for trucks that can carry 5000 pounds or more, we will only consider those trucks that have a weight of 5000 pounds or more. Therefore, the maximum number of such trucks that can be loaded onto the bridge without exceeding the weight limit is:

Maximum number of trucks = Number of trucks with weight of 5000 pounds or more / Total number of trucks
= 42 trucks (since there are 42 trucks with a weight of 5000 pounds or more) / 250 trucks (total number of trucks)
= 0.168 trucks (or approximately 17 trucks)

Therefore, the maximum number of trucks that can be loaded with 5000 pounds or more without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 42 trucks."

"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, if Mr. A has worked for one company for 40 years and received a pension of Rs. 50,000 per month after retirement, then his total pension amount would be:

Total pension = Monthly pension x Number of months worked = Rs. 50,000 x 20 years = Rs. 1,000,000 (one million)

If he continued working for another 10 years after that, his additional pension amount would be:

Additional pension = Total pension x Percentage increase = Rs. 1,000,000 x 5% = Rs. 50,000

Therefore, Mr. A's total pension amount after 30 years of work would be:

Total pension = Initial pension + Additional pension = Rs. 1,000,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 1,050,000 (one crore fifty lakh rupees)."

Explanation: According to the question, there are 60 lines in Genie's drawing, and each line has a length of at least 1 meter. Since Genie drew these lines without any gaps or overlaps, we can assume that each line is continuous and unbroken. Therefore, the total length of all 60 lines must be at least 60 meters (60 x 1 meter). However, since some of the lines may overlap or have gaps, it is not possible to determine exactly how many meters of line are present in Genie's drawing. So, as an estimate, we can say that there are approximately 25 meters of line in Genie's drawing (i.e., 60 / 2 = 30 meters, rounded up to the nearest whole number)."

Therefore, in total, Kelli moves 15 x 100 = 1500 steps per minute. Since Blick takes 40 seconds to reach her starting point after moving away from it, he covers a distance of 40 / 60 = 2/3 of a meter per second. So, in one minute, Blick covers a distance of (2/3) x 60 = 40 meters. Now, since Kelli moves 1500 steps per minute, and Blick covers 40 meters per minute, the number of steps that Kelli takes is equal to the distance covered by Blick, i.e., 40 meters.

"Response: 18000
Explanation:
The price of one big was Rs. 20 per month initially. After every two months (i.e., after 4 months), there is an increase of 20% in the price. Therefore, the price after 36 months will be:

Price after 4 months = Price x (1 + (Percentage increase/100))
= 20 x (1 + (20/100))
= 25

Price after 8 months = Price x (1 + (Percentage increase/100))
= 25 x (1 + (20/100))
= 31.25

Price after 12 months = Price x (1 + (Percentage increase/100))
= 31.25 x (1 + (20/100))
= 37.5

Price after 16 months = Price x (1 + (Percentage increase/100))
= 37.5 x (1 + (20/100))
= 45

Price after 20 months = Price x (1 + (Percentage increase/100))
= 45 x (1 + (20/100))
= 52.5

Price after 24 months = Price x (1 + (Percentage increase/100))
= 52.5 x (1 + (20/100))
= 60

Price after 28 months = Price x (1 + (Percentage increase/100))
= 60 x (1 + (20/100))
= 70

Price after 32 months = Price x (1 + (Percentage increase/100))
= 70 x (1 + (20/100))
= 80

Price after 36 months = Price x (1 + (Percentage increase/100))
= 80 x (1 + (20/100))
= 90

Therefore, the price of one big after 36 months will be"

In this scenario, each team has four runners who complete one leg of the race (400 meters) before passing off to their next runner. If Team A has five runners and Team B has six runners, then Team A will have an advantage since they can complete two legs of the race while Team B is only completing three legs. Therefore, if both teams are running at their maximum speed, Team A would likely win by about 10-15 seconds. However, it's important to note that other factors such as strategy, communication, and teamwork also play a crucial role in determining the outcome of a relay race.

Response:  The trader has sold 20 bags of wheat at Rs. 20 per bag, and he has to pay Rs. 2 per bag for transportation and handling charges. Therefore, the total cost of transporting and handling one bag of wheat is Rs. 2 + (2 x 20) = Rs. 40. Since the trader has sold 30 bags of wheat in total, the total amount he has earned from selling wheat is 30 x Rs. 20 = Rs. 600. So, after deducting the cost of transportation and handling, the trader has earned Rs. 600 - Rs. 40 = Rs. 560 as profit.

Explanation:
The first pair of shoes costs $20.25 and the second pair costs $33 each, for a total cost of $53.50. If they are sold at a discount of $4.50 per pair, then the selling price will be $48.50 per pair. To find out how many pairs can be sold to make a profit of $1000, we need to divide the profit by the selling price:

Profit = Total revenue - Cost = $1000
Selling price = $48.50 x Number of pairs sold
Number of pairs sold = Profit / Selling price
= $1000 / $48.50
= 21.75 pairs
Therefore, if the two friends sell all their shoes at this rate, they will be able to sell 21.75 pairs and make a profit of $1000."
