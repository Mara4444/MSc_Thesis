"Response:  Kylar needs to pay $80 for 16 glasses. Here's how we can calculate it:

First, let's find out the cost of one glass:
$5 (base price) x 60% = $3 (discounted price)
So, the cost of one glass is $5 + $3 = $8.
Now, let's find out the total cost of 16 glasses:
16 x $8 = $128
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $128 for 16 glasses."
Response:  Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find out how many sheep Charleston has. We know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Now we can use this information to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so if Charleston has 80 sheep, then Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep. Finally, we can add up the number of sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have to find the total number of sheep they have together. So, the answer is 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 sheep.
"Response: 156 MB

Explanation:
Carla's computer can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute, so it will take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the entire 200 GB file without any interruptions.
Since Windows forced a restart after 40% of the way through the download, the remaining time for the download is (1 - 0.4) \* 100 = 60 minutes.
Therefore, the total load on Carla's computer to download the file is 200 GB / 60 min = 333 MBps."
"Response:  The distance traveled by John during these 4 hours can be calculated as follows:

1. First 2 hours:
Speed = 30 mph
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 x 2 = 60 miles
2. Next half-hour:
Speed = 80 mph
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 x 0.5 = 40 miles
Total distance = 60 + 40 = 100 miles

Therefore, John is 100 miles away from his destination at the end of the 4 hours."
Response:  Let x be the number of hours Eliza worked in a given week. Then, we know that her total earnings for the week can be represented by the equation: E = 10x + (1.2x)45 - 10(40) where E is Eliza's total earnings for the week, x is the number of hours she worked, and 10, 1.2, and 40 are constants. To find the value of E, we need to substitute the values given in the problem into the equation above: E = 10x + (1.2x)45 - 10(40) Substituting x = 45, we get: E = 10(45) + (1.2)(45) - 10(40) E = 225 + 540 - 40 E = 765 This means that Eliza earned $765 for the week.
"Response: 210

Explanation:

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so the number of downloads in the second month was 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. However, in the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so the number of downloads in the third month was 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 210 downloads."
Response:  Total Cost = (3 x $68) + (2 x $80) + (6 x $55) = $479
"Response: 4 years

Explanation:
Carlos's total revenue from selling lemons in one year is $7 (7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon). His annual expenses are $3 for watering and feeding the tree. To calculate when he will start earning money, we need to subtract his annual expenses from his annual revenue.

Year 1: Revenue = $7; Expense = $3; Profit = $4
Year 2: Revenue = $14 ($7 x 2); Expense = $3; Profit = $11
Year 3: Revenue = $28 ($14 x 2); Expense = $3; Profit = $25
Year 4: Revenue = $42 ($28 x 2); Expense = $3; Profit = $39

As you can see, Carlos will start earning money after 4 years of planting the lemon tree. Therefore, the answer is 4 years."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, if she had x vacuum cleaners initially, she sold 1/3x.
* She sold 2 more to the red house. So, she now has x - 2.
* She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she now has (x - 2)/2.
* She has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: (x - 2)/2 = 5.
* Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, Melanie started with 10 vacuum cleaners."
"Response: 37.5%

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance (4 students)
* 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance (5 students)
* The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance (11 students)

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:
Total number of students = Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance + Number of students enrolled in jazz dance + Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance
= 4 + 5 + 11
= 20

So, 37.5% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"Response:  B) $375
Explanation: The merchant should choose the option with the higher expected return, which in this case is the electronic gadgets worth $8,000. According to the given information, the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, resulting in an additional profit of $960 ($8,000 x 1.2%). On the other hand, the jewelry market is expected to rise by only 2.5%, resulting in an additional profit of $1,250 ($5,000 x 2.5%). Therefore, the total profit from both options is $960 + $1,250 = $2,210."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the question:

Day 1:
Trains travel westward for 80 miles = x miles

Since they start at the same time and travel together, their speeds are equal. So, the speed of one train is also 80 miles/hour.

Therefore, the distance traveled by each train on Day 1 is:
x miles / 2 = 40 miles per hour

Day 2:
Both trains travel northward for 150 miles = y miles

Now, we need to find out how much time it took them to cover this distance. Since they started traveling together on Day 1, their speeds are still equal. Therefore, the time taken to cover 150 miles is:
y miles / (80 miles/hour) = 1875 hours

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
40 miles/hour x 2 days = 80 miles
+ 1875 hours x 1 day = 1875 miles

Therefore, the answer is:
Distance covered by each train = 80 miles + 1875 miles = 1955 miles"
"Response:  To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply the number of hours she works each week by the hourly wage for each job. For teaching, that's 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week; for coaching, it's 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week. Then, we add up these amounts to get Jill's total weekly income: $700 + $450 = $1,150/week. Finally, we multiply this amount by the number of weeks she works in a year (50) to get her annual salary: $1,150/week x 50 weeks = $57,500/year."
Response:  Claire eats 12 eggs (3 x 4) in 4 weeks.
Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles and the time taken so far is 2 hours (or 2 x 60 minutes). So, if Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken = 12 miles / 2 hours = 6 miles per hour.
"Response:  The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters can be calculated as follows:

For the orange drink:

* 10 liters x (2/3) = 6.67 liters of water

For the pineapple drink:

Response:  The birthday of Raymond's son is 9 years ago. Explanation: At the time when Samantha was born (6 years after Raymond), Raymond was already 23 years old and had a son who was 9 years old. Therefore, the birthday of Raymond's son occurred 9 years ago.
"Response: 40

Explanation:
Billy sold a total of 8 DVDs to his 8 customers on Tuesday.
The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so he sold 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so he sold an additional 4 DVDs (for a total of 7).
Finally, the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so he didn't sell any more.
Therefore, Billy sold a total of 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"Response: 30 cm

A candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, so if the candle burns for 4 hours (from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), it will melt by 8 centimeters (2 x 4 hours). Since the original height of the candle was 100 centimeters, the new height after burning for 4 hours will be 92 centimeters (100 - 8 = 92)."
Response:  To find the original price of the book, we need to use the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage) In this case, the discounted price is $19.50, and the discount percentage is 25%. So, we can plug these values into the formula to get: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $24.80 Therefore, the original price of the book was $24.80.
"Response:  Marie ordered 5 boxes of pizza. 

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered.

The total amount Marie paid is $50.
From this, we know that the cost of the chicken meal is $12, so the price of one chicken meal is $12 / 1 = $12 per unit.
Since Marie ordered one chicken meal, she paid $12 x 1 = $12 for it.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the other items:

* The cost of 5 packs of milk is $3 x 5 = $15.
* The cost of 4 apples is $1.50 x 4 = $6.

So, the total cost of all these items except for the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we can deduce that the cost of the pizza is $50 - $33 = $17 per box.

Therefore, Marie ordered 5 boxes of pizza since the cost of 5 boxes would be $17 x 5 = $85."
Response:  Mishka spent a total of $198.50 on all the clothing items.
"Response:  Cynthia spends $240 on ice cream over 60 days.

To find out how much Cynthia spends on ice cream over 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

First, let's calculate the total number of servings Cynthia consumes in 60 days:

1 serving/night x 60 nights = 60 servings

Next, let's calculate the cost of each serving of ice cream:

$4.00/carton / 15 servings/carton = $0.27/serving

Now, let's multiply the total number of servings by the cost per serving to find the total amount Cynthia spends on ice cream:

60 servings x $0.27/serving = $16.20

Therefore, Cynthia spends $16.20 on ice cream over 60 days."

"Response:  Let's analyze the situation:

Gloria wants to buy either the boots or the two pairs of high heels. The total cost of the three options is:

Bootes: $X
High Heels (pair 1): $33
High Heels (pair 2): $66 ($33 x 2)

We know that the total cost of the three options is equal to $50, so we can set up the equation:

$X + $33 + $66 = $50

Solving for X, we get:

X = $47

So, the boots cost $47."
Response:  Sure! Let's use the information given in the question to find out Allen's age 10 years from now. We know that Darrell's age is 7 times Allen's age plus 70, so we can write an equation based on this: Darrell's age = 7(Allen's age) + 70 Now, we are told that Darrell's age is 162, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 7(Allen's age) + 70 = 162 Subtracting 70 from both sides gives us: 7(Allen's age) = 92 Divide both sides by 7 to solve for Allen's age: Allen's age = 92 / 7 = 13 years From here, we can see that Allen's age will be 13 + 10 = 23 years old 10 years from now.
Response:  The average of their guesses is (80 + 20 + 25%) / 3 = 147.
"Response:  John spends 20 hours per week taking care of the dogs.

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how much time John spends on each dog per day, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week to get the total time spent on dogs for the week.

Let's break down the information given in the question:

* ""John takes care of 10 dogs."" means that John spends time caring for 10 dogs every day.
* "".5 hours a day"" means that it takes John half an hour to take care of one dog per day.

Now, let's calculate the total time John spends on dogs per week:

Total time = Number of dogs x Time per dog per day x Number of days in a week
= 10 dogs x.5 hours/dog/day x 7 days/week
= 20 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 20 hours per week taking care of the dogs."
Response:  Gretchen has 40 gold coins.
"Response: 38

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

1. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, if Aaron has x jewels, Siobhan has x - 2 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, if Raymond has y jewels, Aaron has y + 5 jewels.

Now, we can use the above two statements to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

Siobhan has x - 2 jewels, and Aaron has y + 5 jewels.

So, the total number of jewels is:
x - 2 + (y + 5) = 40

Solving for x, we get:
x = 38

Therefore, Siobhan has 38 jewels."
"Response: 80
Explanation:
In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he scored a total of 4 x 20 = 80 points in this period.
In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first period, which means he scored (4 x 1.25) = 50 points in this period. Therefore, his total score is 80 + 50 = 130 points."
Response:  Terry spends $15.00 on yogurt over 30 days ($5.00 x 30 days).
"Response:  John still has 5 Lego sets. 

To solve this problem, we need to subtract the amount of money John spent on video games from the total amount of money he made by selling his toys. We can then divide that number by the cost of one Lego set to find out how many sets John still has.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. John sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each, so he made a total of $195 ($15 x 13 = $195).
2. Then, he bought 8 video games at $20 each, so he spent a total of $160 ($20 x 8 = $160).
3. Now, let's subtract the amount John spent on video games from the money he made selling his toys: $195 - $160 = $35.
4. Finally, let's divide the remaining amount by the cost of one Lego set to find out how many sets John still has: $35 / $15 = 5 (Lego sets).

Therefore, John still has 5 Lego sets!"
"Response:  John's average running speed is 10 miles per hour (mph).

Explanation:
John runs for 3 hours on the first day, which means he covers a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 miles. Since he runs half as much on the other two days, he covers a total distance of 2 x 60 = 120 miles over those three days. Therefore, his overall average running speed is:

Average speed = Total distance / Time taken = 180 + 120 / 3 = 10 mph

So, John's average running speed is 10 miles per hour."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. This means that for every mile she walks, she can run 4 miles. So, if she runs for x miles in an hour, she can walk for 4x miles in an hour.
* She can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means that if she skips for y miles in an hour, she can run for 2y miles in an hour.
* If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run for 6x miles in an hour (since 3/2 = 1.5).
* In six hours, she will have traveled a total distance of 6x + 6(2x) = 72x miles.
* Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she will have spent 1/3 \* 72x = 24x hours walking and 2/3 \* 72x = 48x hours running.
* Therefore, her total distance traveled in six hours is 72x - 24x = 48x miles.

So, Dana can travel 48x miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking."
Response: 4 x 2 = 8 years old
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question.

First, let's find out how far Polly can throw the gold javelin without holding the sapphire gemstone:

Distance = Speed x Time
Speed = Distance / Time = 400 ft /? (since Polly can throw it for a distance of 400 feet)
Time =? (we don't know the time taken by Polly to throw the javelin)

Now, let's find out how much further Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone:

Distance = Speed x Time + Additional Distance
Additional Distance =? (since the gemstone increases the throwing distance by 3 times)

Now, we have two equations:

Equation 1: Distance = Speed x Time
Equation 2: Additional Distance = 3 x (Distance without gemstone)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the answer:

Speed = 400 ft /? (from Equation 1)
Additional Distance = 3 x (400 ft -?) (from Equation 2)

Substituting the value from Equation 1 into Equation 2, we get:

Additional Distance = 3 x (400 ft -?)
= 3 x (400 ft -?)

Solving for?, we get:

? = 1200 ft

So, without the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it for a distance of 1200 feet, which is 3 times farther than without the gemstone. Therefore, the distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin is 1200 feet."
Response:  The number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 7 (5 - 14 = 7).
Response:  To calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories in a single serving of chips, we need to use some basic math. Let's assume that you want to consume 2000 calories per day and you have already consumed 1800 calories (which means you have 200 calories left). Now, let's convert the number of calories in a single serving of chips from calories to grams: 1 serving = 250 calories x 4 g/calorie = 1000 grams So, if you want to stick to your daily calorie target of 2000 calories, you can eat up to 1000 grams of chips (based on the nutritional information provided earlier). Therefore, you would be able to eat approximately half of the contents of a 300g bag of chips.
"Response:  To find out how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax, we need to divide the weight of the beeswax by the weight of a single candle. In this case, one pound of beeswax is equivalent to 10 tapered candles, since each candle weighs approximately 0.1 pounds (or 4.53 grams). Therefore, Charlie can make 20 candles with one pound of beeswax (10 x 2 = 20).
To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the revenue generated by the sale of the candles. The cost of supplies includes both the beeswax and the wicks, which together cost $10.00 per pound of beeswax. Since Charlie made 20 candles with one pound of beeswax, the total cost of supplies for these 20 candles is $10.00 / 0.1 pounds per candle = $50.00.
Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the sale of the candles. Each candle costs $2.00 to produce, so the total revenue from the sale of the 20 candles is $2.00 x 20 = $40.00.
Therefore, Charlie's net profit from selling these 20 candles is $40.00 - $50.00 = -$10.00. This means that Charlie actually loses money on each candle he sells, as the cost of producing it exceeds the amount he charges for it."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the question:

* On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. (So, she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours researching and writing articles on Monday.)
* On Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than she did on Monday. So, if she wrote x articles on Monday, she wrote 2x articles on Tuesday. (So, she spent 2x x 4 = 8 hours researching and writing articles on Tuesday.)
* On Wednesday, Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, if she wrote x articles on Tuesday, she wrote 2x articles on Wednesday. (So, she spent 2x x 4 = 8 hours researching and writing articles on Wednesday.)

Adding up the time she spent writing articles on each day, we get:

Total time spent writing articles = 20 + 8 + 8 = 36 hours

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 36 hours researching and writing articles over the course of the three days."
"Response:  B) 16

Explanation:
Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse before heading to work. Then, she stopped off at the store and bought another package of Post-it notes. Since she had 80 Post-it notes already, and she bought another package with x Post-it notes, the total number of Post-it notes she has is 80 + x.

At work, she placed one Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee. So, the total number of Post-it notes used by Candice is 80 + x - 220 = 0. Therefore, the answer is (B) 16."
"Response: 350

Explanation:
John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the total number of ties he bought is 2x = 2(10) = 20 ties.
The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of one red tie is (1 + 50%) \* $40 = $60.
Since John spent $200 on blue ties, he spent $\frac{200}{40} = 5$ times as much on blue ties as he spent on red ties. So he spent a total of $200 \times 5 = 1000$ on ties."

"Response:  To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen. Let's do that!

Total number of eggs sold per day = 252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week

Price per dozen = $2/dozen

So, Lloyd makes $2 x 1,764 eggs/week = $3,528 per week on eggs alone! That's a pretty good income from his little egg farm!"
"Response:  The time it takes for Tom to get back depends on the speed he is traveling and the distance he needs to cover. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Distance traveled during the first leg of the trip = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 miles
* Speed of Tom's ship during the first leg of the trip = 10 miles/hour
* Time taken to travel the first leg of the trip = distance / speed = 10 miles / 10 miles/hour = 1 hour (or 60 minutes)
* Distance traveled during the return journey = 4 miles
* Speed of Tom's ship during the return journey = 6 miles/hour
* Time taken to travel the return journey = distance / speed = 4 miles / 6 miles/hour = 2 hours (or 120 minutes)

Therefore, the total time taken by Tom to complete his trip is:
Time = 1 hour (for the first leg) + 2 hours (for the return journey) = 3 hours (or 180 minutes)"
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that the total weight of Uriah's book bag is 15 pounds, and that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. Therefore, if Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of his book bag will be: 15 pounds - (30 x 1/4) = 9 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, Uriah needs to remove 9 / 1/2 = 18 toys from his book bag to bring its total weight down to 15 pounds.
"Response:  The mechanic earned $240 more on Friday than on Thursday.

Explanation:
On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 per tire = $360. And he repaired 4 car tires at $40 per tire = $160. So total revenue on Thursday was $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 per tire = $480. Since he didn't repair any truck tires, there is no revenue from truck tire repairs on Friday. Therefore, total revenue on Friday was $480.

So, the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is $520 - $480 = $40. This means the mechanic earned $40 more on Friday than on Thursday."
"Response: 48

Explanation:
The Doubtfire sisters already had 7 kittens from the local animal shelter before they were informed about their mother's news. If Patchy had thrice as many adopted kittens as their mother said (i.e., 3 times 7 = 21), then Patchy now has 21 + 7 = 28 kittens in total. Similarly, if Trixie had 12 kittens, then Trixie now has 12 + 7 = 19 kittens in total. Therefore, the total number of kittens belonging to the Doubtfire family is 28 + 19 = 47 kittens."
Response:  Jean can fill 15 bags with the remaining lollipops.  To see why, let's use the information given in the problem: * Jean has 30 lollipops. * Jean eats 2 of the lollipops, leaving him with 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops. * Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in each bag. So, he needs to divide the total number of lollipops by 2, which gives us 28 / 2 = 14 bags. Therefore, Jean can fill 15 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"Response: 26

Explanation:
The total weight of the truck and its contents is 3755 pounds, which is less than the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:

Maximum load = Total weight of truck and contents - Weight of bridge limit
= 3755 - 5000
= -1245

Since this result is negative, it means that the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is infinite (i.e., there is no limit)."

Therefore, the total number of good oranges is 21."
"Response:  Janet paid a total of $1300 for the brooch.

Janet buys a brooch for her daughter.  She pays $500 for the material to make it and then another $800 for the jeweler to construct it.  After that, she pays 10% of that to get it insured.  How much did she pay?

To find out how much Janet paid for the brooch, we need to calculate the cost of the materials and labor first.

Cost of materials = $500
Cost of labor = $800
Total cost = $500 + $800 = $1300

So, Janet paid a total of $1300 for the brooch."
"Response:  B) $75,000/year

Explanation:
Marcy has worked for the company for 30 years (starting at age 20 and retiring at age 50). After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year, which is $12,500 ($50,000 x 5%). Therefore, her total accumulated pension value is $62,500 ($50,000 + $12,500). Since she quit working after 30 years, her annual pension would be $62,500 / 12 = $5,187.50 per year."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Aleena was charged in each half of the year and then add them up. Let's break down the calculation as follows:

Half 1 (January - June):
Aleena was initially charged $140 x 6 = $840.

Half 2 (July - December):
Since the streaming company charged her 10% less money in the second half of the year, Aleena was charged ($840 / 10%) x 6 = $496.

Total amount paid by Aleena by the end of the year: $840 + $496 = $1,336.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1,336."
Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. This means that she used 4/12 = 1/3 of a tank of gas since last filling it. Therefore, she has 12 - 1/3 = 8/3 gallons of gas left in her tank. Since there are 4 gallons per tank, this means that Sophia can drive 8/4 = 2 miles on a single tank of gas. So, Sophia can drive 2 miles on a single tank of gas.
"Response: 168 hours

Jim watches TV for 2 hours per day, so he spends 2 x 7 = 14 hours on TV per week. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 14 x 3 = 42 hours on TV per month. In 4 weeks, he spends 42 x 4 = 168 hours on TV.
Similarly, since he reads for half as long as he watches TV, he spends 1/2 x 168 = 84 hours reading per month. In 4 weeks, he spends 84 x 4 = 336 hours reading."

Response:  Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find out how many diamonds are in the chest. We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, if we subtract 35 from 175, we get 140. Therefore, there are 140 diamonds in the chest. Now, let's find out how many emeralds are in the chest. We know that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, and since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, there are 2 x 35 = 70 emeralds in the chest. Finally, we add up the number of diamonds and emeralds to find the total number of gems in the chest: 140 + 70 = 210. So, there are 210 gems in the treasure chest.
Response:  Let x be the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2x. According to the problem, there are 60 girls and 5 students per teacher, so the total number of students is 60 + (5 \* 2x) = 130. Therefore, the number of teachers is 130 / 5 = 26.
"Response:  Bailey started with $20.

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that Bailey starts with a certain amount of money and then receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. If at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100, then the amount of money Bailey started with is equal to the total amount of money she received during the 8 weeks minus the amount of money she had at the beginning of the 8 weeks.

So, let's break it down:

* Total amount of money Bailey received = Weekly allowance x Number of weeks = $5 x 8 = $40
* Amount of money Bailey had at the beginning of the 8 weeks = Initial amount + Total amount of money received = $20 + $40 = $60

Therefore, Bailey started with $20."
"Response:  To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the cost per student. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day during the weekdays (Monday through Friday). This means she teaches 5 x 7 = 35 classes per week on weekdays.
* Judy teaches 8 dance classes on Saturdays.
* Each class has 15 students.
* She charges $15.00 per student.

Now let's do the calculation:
Total number of students taught per week = 35 + 8 = 43 students per week
Total amount earned per week = 43 students x $15.00 per student = $645.00 per week

Therefore, Judy makes $645.00 per week teaching dance classes."
Response: 40
Response:  To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of brownies he sold by the price per slice and then add that amount to the total raised from the cheesecakes. For the brownies, Tommy sold 43 slices at $3 each, so he raised $13 (43 x $3). For the cheesecakes, Tommy sold 23 slices at $4 each, so he raised $93 ($23 x $4). Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $106 ($13 + $93) in funds for his charity.
"Response:  Sheila will pay $45 per month for 3 months.

Explanation:
Sheila paid $150 for each of the 5 cell phones, so she paid a total of $750 ($150 x 5). Since there is a 2% interest charge for each unit, the total amount Sheila pays for all 5 cell phones is $768 ($750 + $18). Therefore, her monthly payment for 3 months is $256 ($768 / 3)."

Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, which means she needs 180 cups of dog food during that period. Since each bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need 36 bags of dog food (180 / 110 = 36) during the first year."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. Let's break it down step by step:

1. If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Sarah does twice as much laundry as Raymond. So, Sarah does 2 x 400 = 800 pounds of laundry.
2. If Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 1/4 of what Sarah does. So, David does 800 / 4 = 200 pounds of laundry.
3. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 800 - 200 = 600 pounds.

So, the answer is 600 pounds."

"Response:  There are 18 liters of water left. 

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* ""Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water."" means that together, they received 24 / 6 = 4 liters of water.
* ""Then a boy got 6 liters of water."" means that the boy received 6 liters of water.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water left:
Total amount of water left = Total amount of water initially available - Amount of water received by two girls + Amount of water received by boy
= 24 liters - 4 liters + 6 liters
= 18 liters

Therefore, there are 18 liters of water left."
"Response:  Charlie has 4 stickers left. 

Charlie had 10 stickers at first, then he bought 21 more, so he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers now. After that, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he has 31 - 9 = 22 stickers left. Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, which means he has 22 - 28 = -6 stickers left (negative because he used more stickers than he had). Therefore, Charlie has 4 stickers left."
Response:  To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, if Grace weighs x pounds, Alex weighs x - 8 pounds. Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is x + (x - 8) = 3x - 8 pounds.

"Response:  Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Year 1 (just completed):
Sylvie's initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = $60
New salary = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2 (currently working on):
Sylvie's current salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = $66
New salary = $660 + $66 = $726

Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice have. Let's start by finding the length of each roll-up. Since Beatrice's roll-ups were 24 wide and 2 long, she had a total of 48 roll-ups (24 x 2 = 48). Similarly, since Marcell's roll-ups were 14 wide and 3 long, he had a total of 42 roll-ups (14 x 3 = 42). Now, let's find the total number of roll-ups they both have by adding their individual totals: Total Number of Roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90 Therefore, Marcell and Beatrice together ate 90 fruit roll-ups. On average, they ate 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups each.

"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she has left and then subtract that amount from the total revenue she will get from selling it all. Let's do this step by step:

Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x 2 x 4 = $80
Total cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 16 x 4 = $64
Total cost of all leftover lumber = $80 + $64 = $144

Now let's find out how much money Sasha will make from selling all of her leftover lumber:
Selling price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 x 10 = $100
Selling price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $16 x 5 = $80
Total revenue from selling all lumber = $100 + $80 = $180

So, if Sasha sells all of her leftover lumber, she will make a profit of $180 - $144 = $36."

Explanation:
Let's use the given information to find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used.
We know that Katy uses 7 teaspoons of sugar for every 13 cups of water. So, if she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar, then she must have used 120 / 7 = 17 teaspoons of sugar for every 13 cups of water.
Since there are 16 cups of water in a cup, we can convert this to teaspoonfuls by multiplying by 16:
17 teaspoons of sugar per 13 cups of water x 16 cups/cup = 252 teaspoonfuls of sugar
Therefore, Katy used 48 teaspoonfuls of sugar (since there are 48 teaspoonfuls in a cup)."

"Response:  B) $65,000

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means that if Lylah's salary is x, then Adrien's salary is 30% higher = 0.3x.
2. Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased to 40% more than what he was making four years ago. So, Adrien's new salary (A) can be calculated as follows:
A = 0.3x + 40% of x
3. The problem states that Adrien's salary increased from $40,000 four years ago. Therefore, we can substitute this value in the equation above:
A = 0.3x + 40% of x
Substituting A = $40,000:
0.3x + 40% of x = $40,000
Simplifying:
0.3x = $28,000
X = $90,000

Now, we need to find out how much Lylah was earning four years ago. Since her salary was 30% lower than Adrien's, we can use the same formula to calculate it:
Lylah's salary (L) = 0.7x (since 30% of X is L)
Substituting L = $90,000:
L = $63,000

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
Total Salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $65,000 ($90,000 + $63,000)"

Explanation:
Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday, so she slept a total of 8 + 2 = 10 hours that day. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept for 6 hours each day (2 hours less than the previous day), so she slept a total of 10 - 2 = 8 hours on those days. Therefore, her total sleep time for the week was 8 + 8 = 16 hours. Since she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, she slept a total of 16 + 1 = 17 hours throughout the week."

Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, so she put stamps on x/3 of those letters.
Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, so we can set up the equation:
x/3 + (2/3)x = 30
Simplifying the equation:
2x/3 = 30
Solving for x:
x = 40
Therefore, there were 40 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began."

"Response:  $360

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store.
	* Let W be the cost of one watermelon.
	* Let P be the cost of one pepper.
	* Let O be the cost of one orange.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
	* So, W = 3P
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
	* So, O = W - 5
4. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.
	* The total number of watermelons he needs to buy is 4W = 4(3P) = 12P.
	* The total number of peppers he needs to buy is 20P.
	* The total number of oranges he needs to buy is 10O = 10(W - 5) = 10(W/3 - 5).
5. Now we need to find out how much money Dillon will spend in total.
	* The cost of 12P watermelons is 12P \* 15 = 180.
	* The cost of 20P peppers is 20P \* 15 = 300.
	* The cost of 10O oranges is 10(W/3 - 5) \* 15 = 750.
	* Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 750 = 650.

So, the answer is $650."
"Response:  To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to know the total number of hours worked by the doctors in a day. Let's assume that the doctors work for 8 hours a day (from 9 am to 5 pm).

Total number of minutes seen per day = 500 people/day x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day
Total number of hours worked by doctors per day = Total number of minutes seen per day / 60 = 12,000 minutes/day / 60 = 200 hours/day

Now, let's calculate the profit made by the hospital:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
Revenue = Number of patients seen per day x Charge per patient = 500 people/day x $200/hour = $100,000/day
Cost = Number of hours worked by doctors per day x Doctor's charge per hour = 200 hours/day x $150/hour = $30,000/day
Profit = Revenue - Cost = $100,000/day - $30,000/day = $70,000/day

So, the hospital makes a daily profit of $70,000."

Response:  Let's assume that the total number of gumballs in the machine is x. Since there are 4 times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, the number of pink gumballs is 4x. Therefore, we can set up the equation : 22 = 4x - 12. Solving for x, we get : x = 30. So, there are 30 pink gumballs and 9 blue gumballs ( since 12 - 4 = 9 ) in the machine.

### 추가 예제 (III) - Percentage Problems with Fractions

Suppose you have a bag of candies that contains 1/4 cup of chocolate candies, 1/6 cup of strawberry candies, and 1/8 cup of vanilla candies. If you want to distribute these candies equally among 4 friends, how many pieces will each friend get?

Solution: Since there are 3 types of candies, we can use fractions to represent their proportions. The total amount of candy is 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 = 3/4 cup. So, if we divide this amount equally among 4 friends, each friend will get 3/4 cup / 4 = 3/8 cup of candy.

A company has 75 employees, and 45 of them are men. If a certain department needs 15 more employees, what percentage of the total number of employees does this department need?

Solution: To find the percentage of employees needed by the department, we can first convert the number of employees from decimals to percentages. There are 75 employees in total, so the department needs 15 / 75 = 20% of the total number of employees."
Response:  The number of worker bees is 1400.
Response:  To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on video games and then multiply it by his hourly wage from his part-time job. Let's assume that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day, which means he spends 14 hours (2 x 7) playing games each week. If he works at his part-time job for 14 hours per week, he will earn $140 ($10/hour x 14 hours). So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.
Response:  The total cost of the items after the 10% tax on non-food items would be: $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15 (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps). Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, the total cost with tax would be: $15 x 1.10 = $16.50.
"Response:  $48

To find out how much profit Lucas will make each week, we need to subtract his total expenses ($10 = $2 x 2 + $5 x 2) from his total income ($92). So, his profit per week is:

Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
= $92 - $10
= $82

Therefore, Lucas will make $82 in profit each week."
"Response:  John can harvest 1,000 pineapples within a year. Here's how I arrived at this answer:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples that John has in his field:
10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare = 1,000 pineapples
2. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he will be able to harvest 4 times in a year:
1 year / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year
3. Now, let's multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests per year to find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year:
1,000 pineapples x 4 harvests per year = 4,000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 4,000 pineapples within a year."

Response:  Let's start by using the formula for distance = rate x time to find out how far Steve will travel in a certain amount of time. Since Steve bikes faster than Tim, we will use Steve's speed to solve this problem. So if Steve bikes at 440 feet/minute, then in 1 minute, he will cover 440 feet. Now let's find out how far Tim will travel in the same amount of time. If Tim rides his skateboard at 264 feet/minute, then in 1 minute, he will also cover 264 feet. To find out who will reach their house first, we need to compare the distances they traveled in the same amount of time. In this case, since Steve biked 440 feet in 1 minute and Tim rode his skateboard 264 feet in 1 minute, it means that Steve covered more distance than Tim in the same amount of time. Therefore, Steve will reach his house first. As for when the winner will arrive at their house, we know that Steve covers more distance than Tim in the same amount of time, which means that Steve will take less time to reach his house. So if Steve takes 1 minute to reach his house, then Tim will take longer than 1 minute to reach his house. We don't know exactly how much longer, but we do know that it will be more than 1 minute because Steve reached his house faster than Tim did.

"Response: 140

Explanation:
Let's break this problem into smaller parts to solve it step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 French fries before the seagull stole the pack. So, there were 14 - 1 = 13 French fries left in the pack.
2. The seagull ate half of the remaining French fries, which is 13 / 2 = 6.5 French fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a French fry, let's round up to 7 French fries.
3. Three pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 French fries. So, the total number of French fries eaten by the pigeons is 3 x 3 = 9 French fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining French fries, which is (2/3) x 7 = 4.67 French fries. Since we can't have a decimal of a French fry, let's round up to 5 French fries.
5. Finally, ants carried off one French fry, leaving 5 French fries behind.

Now, let's add up all the numbers to find out how many French fries were in the pack when Dave bought it: 13 + 7 + 9 + 4.67 + 1 = 140 French fries.

Therefore, the answer is 140 French fries were in the pack when Dave bought it."

"Response: 3500

Explanation:
The total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo is 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month. Since we are asked to find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we multiply the total number of bananas needed by the duration (i.e., 2 months):
700 x 2 = 1400 bananas
Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Response:  The answer is 260 yards.

Explanation:
Blake ran 15 times back and forth on the football field, which means he covered a distance of 100 yards x 15 = 1500 yards.
Kelly ran from the 40-yard line to the end zone (a distance of 40 + 10 = 50 yards) and back, which means she covered a total distance of 50 yards x 34 = 1700 yards.
Therefore, the winner (Blake) ran a total distance of 1500 + 1700 = 3200 yards, while the loser (Kelly) ran a total distance of 1700 yards. So, the winner ran 260 yards more than the loser."

Answer: B) 9

Explanation:
Anakin caught 10 starfish, which means Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish (since he caught 5 fewer than Anakin).
Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 3 x 3 = 9 sea horses in total.
Finally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 2 x 3 = 6 clownfish in total.
Therefore, the total number of fish that both Anakin and Locsin caught is 10 + 9 + 6 = 9."
Response:  After 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost $48. To calculate this, we can use the formula: New Price = Original Price x (1 + Percentage Increase)^Number of Months. In this case, the original price is $20, the percentage increase is 20%, and the number of months is 36. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: New Price = $20 x (1 + 0.20)^36 = $48.
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* ""There are 5 red cars"" means that each red car costs $1 (since there are 5 of them). So, the total value of the red cars is $5 x 5 = $25.
* ""There are 3 action figures"" means that each action figure costs $5 (since there are 3 of them). So, the total value of the action figures is $5 x 3 = $15.
* ""The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4."" This statement tells us that the doll costs $4 + ($3 x 3) = $4 + $9 = $13. Since there is only one doll, its value is $13.
* ""If an action figure costs $5"". This statement gives us additional information about the cost of action figures.

Now, let's calculate the total value of all the toys:

Red cars: $25
Action figures: $15
Doll: $13
Total value: $25 + $15 + $13 = $63

So, all the toys together are worth $63."

"Response:  Jessica pays $1875 per year (or $156.25 per month) if she pays 50% more than the minimum for each of her debts. Here's how we can calculate it:

Student Loan Minimum Payment = $300 x 1.5 = $450
Credit Card Minimum Payment = $200 x 1.5 = $300
Mortgage Minimum Payment = $500 x 1.5 = $750
Total Monthly Debt Payments = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500
Total Annual Debt Payments = $1500 x 12 = $18,000

So, Jessica pays $18,750 per year ($15,000 in minimum payments plus an additional $3,750 as a 50% increase)."
"Response:  Billy will need approximately 10 minutes to prep all 60 potatoes. Here's how we can calculate this:

* Time to peel 1 potato = 1.5 minutes (as per question) x 60 potatoes = 90 minutes
* Time to cut 1 potato = 5 seconds x 60 potatoes = 300 seconds or 5 minutes

So, total time required to prepare all 60 potatoes = 90 + 5 = 95 minutes."
"Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to subtract the amount of money they made from the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade. Let's do that:

Total cost of making one gallon = $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5
Number of glasses sold = 20
Profit per glass = $0.50
Total profit = $25
Now, let's use these values to calculate how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons:

Lemons cost = Total cost of making one gallon - Profit per glass x Number of glasses sold
= $5 - ($0.50 x 20)
= $5 - $10
= $4
Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $4 on lemons."
"Response: 30

Explanation:
Let's assume that the total number of students in the race is 240 (as given in the problem). Since 80 of them are Japanese, there are 160 non-Japanese students (i.e., Chinese and others).
Now, let's consider the Chinese team only. We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, which means that the number of girls on the Chinese team is 60 - 60 = 0. Therefore, there are no girls on the Chinese team.
So, the answer is 30, which is the number of girls who are not Japanese or Chinese."
"Response:  Zaid will have $5,800 left after all these expenses and donations. Here's how I calculated it:

Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $1500 (since he earns $6000). So far, he has spent $1500 + $1500 = $3000.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is $2000 (since he earns $6000). So far, he has spent $3000 + $2000 = $5000.

Then, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is $3000 ($6000 - $3000 = $3000).

After that, he gives his daughter $200 to use for her weekly expenses and his wife $700 to budget for groceries and other household goods. So far, he has spent a total of $5000 + $200 + $700 = $6900.

Now, let's calculate how much money Zaid will have left:

$6000 (salary) - $6900 (expenses and donations) = $1000 (money left for Zaid)

Therefore, Zaid will have $1000 left after all these expenses and donations."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, which means Rani has x crabs and Monic has x - 10 crabs.
Bo has 4 fewer crabs than Monic, which means Bo has x - (4) crabs.
Total number of crabs = Rani + Monic + Bo = x + (x - 10) + (x - 4) = 3x - 6
So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 3 times Rani's crabs minus 6.
Therefore, the answer is 3(x) - 6 = 3(20) - 6 = 54 crabs."

Explanation:
The first team's total time for all four legs would be 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 280 seconds.
The second team's total time for all four legs would be 60 + (60 - 3) + (60 - 6) + (60 - 9) = 274 seconds.
Therefore, the difference in times between the two teams is 280 - 274 = 6 seconds."
"Response: 40%

Explanation:

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 1/2, or 50%. To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling another even number on the second roll. Since there are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2, or 50%. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that an even number was rolled on the first roll, is also 1/2, or 50%. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4, or 25%.

So, the answer is 40%, which means that Jerry is 40% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than he is to roll two even numbers in a row."

* Number of cages for small rodents (rats) = 3
* Number of pieces of straw per rat = 6
* Number of rats in each cage =?

We know that there are 3 cages for small rodents, and each cage contains 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of rats in all 3 cages is:

3 x 6 = 18

So, there are 18 rats in each cage."
"Response:  After 3 months, the amount that Mandy owes Benedict is calculated as follows:

Initial amount = $100 (owed by Mandy to Benedict)
Monthly interest rate = 2%/month
Time period = 3 months
Total interest = $100 x 2% x 3/100 = $6
New amount owed = Initial amount + Total interest = $100 + $6 = $106
Therefore, Mandy should give $106 to Benedict after 3 months."
"Response: 50 bags

Explanation:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The trader pays $20 per bag for the wheat. So, the cost price of one bag is $20.
2. It costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse. Therefore, the total cost of one bag is $20 + $2 = $22.
3. After selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, the trader made a total profit of $400. So, the total revenue from selling one bag is $30.
4. To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to divide the total revenue ($400) by the total cost price ($22):
$400 / $22 = 18 bags

So, the trader sold 18 bags of wheat."
"Response:  Let's start by writing an equation based on the information given in the problem:

Total cost = $20.25 + $4.50 - $33 + $33

We know that the total cost is equal to $168.75, so we can set up the following equation:

$20.25 + $4.50 - $33 + $33 = $168.75

Now let's solve for each friend's share of the cost:

Friend 1's share = Total cost / 3
= $168.75 / 3
= $56.25

Friend 2's share = Total cost / 3
= $168.75 / 3
= $56.25

Friend 3's share = Total cost / 3
= $168.75 / 3
= $56.25

Therefore, each friend paid $56.25 towards the cost of the trip to the fair."
Response:  John collects 60 peaches (3 hours x 2 peaches/minute).
Response:  To determine the number of pounds of insects that ten ducks need per day, we can use the information provided in the question. According to the question, each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Since there are ten ducks in total, they will need to eat 3.5 x 10 = 35 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, ten ducks will need to eat 35 pounds of insects per day.
"Response:  Tom has 40 trees left after 10 years.

Explanation:
Tom starts with 50 trees, and every year he plants 10 new trees. So in total, he has 50 + (10 x 10) = 600 trees after 10 years.
However, every year he chooses to chop down 2 trees, so he loses 2 x 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, Tom has 600 - 20 = 580 trees left after 10 years. Finally, since 30% of the trees died, he lost 30 / 100 x 580 = 176 trees, leaving him with 580 - 176 = 404 trees after 10 years."

Explanation:
On Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.
On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one-third of the flamingos (6 flamingos) and painted them white. So, now there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection, so now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos in total.
At noon on Sunday, there are 30 - 6 = 24 pink plastic flamingos more than white plastic flamingos."

"Response: josie's farm produces 50 barrels of wine per year.

To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of acres she has by the amount of grapes produced per acre. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and there are 10 acres in total, we can calculate the total number of tons of grapes as follows:

10 acres x 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes per year

Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total number of barrels of wine as follows:

50 tons of grapes / 2 barrels/ton = 25 barrels of wine per year

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 25 barrels of wine per year."

Total cakes = 4

Day 2 (Tuesday): Rose went to a different store and bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

Total cakes = 4 + 12 = 16 cakes

Day 3 (Wednesday): Rose went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 16 = 80 cakes.

Total cakes = 16 + 80 = 96 cakes

Therefore, Rose bought a total of 96 cakes over the course of the three days."

* Amount of money Sara has already saved = $10
* Number of times Sara must mow the lawn to save enough money = $70 / $4 per mowing = 8 mowings

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 8 times in order to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."
"Response:  Jerry has 10 red chickens.

Explanation:
Let's assume the number of red chickens is x. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(x+2), where x is the number of red chickens.

Now, we know that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so the total number of eggs collected must be equal to the sum of the eggs produced by both types of chickens:

3x + 5(x+2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 10x + 10 = 42

Combing like terms, we get:

13x = 32

Dividing both sides by 13, we get:

x = 25

So, Jerry has 25 red chickens."

"Response: 350
Explanation: On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, there were 50 more customers, so she counted 150 customers (100 + 50). On the third day, there were 50 more customers than the previous day, so she counted 200 customers (150 + 50). Therefore, the total number of customers by the third day was 600 (200 + 400), and Sloane counted 350 customers on that day."
Response: 20 gallons
"Response: 160 hours
Lori's weekly paycheck is $240, which works out to be $8 per hour. To calculate the number of hours she needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we divide the total cost by her weekly paycheck:

$320 (shoes) + $32 (belt) = $352
$352 / $240 (weekly paycheck) = 1.44 weeks
Therefore, Lori needs to work for approximately 160 hours ($1.44 x 100) to save up enough money to buy the shoes and belt."
"Response:  $1374.80 
Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, if she pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance after 12 months can be calculated as follows:

Remaining Balance = Initial Amount x (1 - Monthly Payment / Total Payment)
= $2000 x (1 - $165/$1650)
= $1374.80

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after making 12 monthly payments of $165 each is $1374.80."
"Response:  Total number of flowers in the vase = Number of roses + Number of dahlias = 4 + (7 - 4) = 15 

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"Response:  Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age = 3 x Harriet's age
Harriet's age = 21 years old (given)
So, Adrian's age = 3 x 21 = 63 years old

Now, we need to find out how old Zack is. We know that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old (round up to 11 years old).

Three years from now, Harriet will be 24 years old (since she is already 21 + 3), Adrian will be 93 years old (since he is already 63 + 3), and Zack will be 14 years old (since he is already 11 + 3)."

"Response:  The answer is 36 liters. 

Explanation:
Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank, so there are 120 - 90 = 30 liters of water left in the tank. Since the collected rainwater is twice as much as what was left in the tank, there are 30 x 2 = 60 liters of rainwater added to the tank, making the total amount of water in the tank 30 + 60 = 90 liters."
"Response: 560

Andy plants 90 geraniums, which is equal to 90/1 = 90 flowers. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, the number of petunias he plants is 90 - 40 = 50. Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 90 + 50 = 140 flowers."

"Response: 50%

Explanation:
James initially had 40 water type Pokemon cards, which means they made up 40/90 = 44.44% of his total collection. After losing 8 of them, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards, which means they now make up 32/90 = 35.56% of his total collection. Since the percentage of water type cards in his collection decreased from 44.44% to 35.56%, there is a 50% chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type."

"Response: 28.5 hours

Kalinda and her mom are working together to complete a 360-piece puzzle. If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, then she can complete 4 x 36 = 144 pieces in one hour. Since her mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom can complete 144 / 2 = 72 pieces in one hour. Therefore, they will need 360 / 72 = 5 hours to complete the entire puzzle."
"Response: 56

Explanation:
After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, which means 30% of 120 = 36 watermelons were ready.
When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which means 3/4 \* 36 = 27 watermelons were ready.
So, there were 36 - 27 = 9 watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks."

"Response: 35

Explanation:
On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 25 shells (Robert collects 20).
On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday, so Kylie collects 49 shells (2 x 25 = 50)."
Response:  To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to multiply the number of ants by a fraction that represents the ratio of ants to other insects. Let's assume that the ratio of ants to other insects is 4:1, which means that for every ant, there are four other insects. So, if there are 50 ants, there are 50 x 4 = 200 other insects in the garden. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 50 + 200 = 250 insects.
"Response: 24

There are initially 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow.
One-third of them (12 penguins) jump in and swim in the ocean, leaving 24 penguins still sunbathing.
Another one-third of them (12 penguins) go inside the cave to eat their dinner, leaving 24 penguins still sunbathing outside."
"Response: 4

Explanation:
Steve wants to grow enough cherry tomatoes for himself, so he needs at least 2 times the number of tomatoes that his girlfriend is eating. Since she eats 6 tomatoes per day, Steve needs to eat 12 tomatoes per day (twice as much).
To calculate how many vines he needs, we know that each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes he needs by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce:
4 vines (to produce 12 tomatoes per day) / 3 tomatoes per week = 4 vines
Therefore, Steve needs 4 vines to grow enough cherry tomatoes for himself."

Response:  After a year, Johnny had $30 + $10 = $40.
"Response:  The sum of the ages of the three girls is 48 years. Here's how I calculated it:

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Joan is 2 + 2 = 4 years older than Mary.
Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Jessa is 5 - 5 = 0 years old.
Jessa is 20 years old, so Mary is 20 - 4 = 16 years old.
Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 16 + 4 + 20 = 48 years."
"Response: 270

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find the total number of students who left the building, and then subtract the number who left through exit A to get the number who left through exit C.

Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The number of students in the school hall was 1000.
* After the meeting, 30% of the students went out of the building through exit A. This means that 300 students (30% of 1000) went out through exit A.
* 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. This means that 600 students (600 / 5 = 120) went out through exit B.
* The rest of the students went out through exit C. Since there are 3 entrances (A, B, and C), the remaining students must have gone out through one of the other two entrances. Let's call this number x.

Now, let's add up the number of students who went out through each entrance:

* Exit A: 300 students
* Exit B: 600 students
* Exit C: x students

So, the total number of students who left the building is:

1000 - 300 - 600 + x = 270

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 270

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 270."

"Response:  They will collectively read a total of 3 books at the end. Here's why:

Dolly reads her own book (1) + Pandora's book (1) = 2 books
Pandora reads her own book (1) + Dolly's book (1) = 2 books
So, together they have read 2 + 2 = 4 books."
"Response: 108 hours
Mike has been a penpal with 5 people for the past year. Each person sends 2 letters per week, and Mike replies to each letter in kind. The letters are 5 pages long, so it takes him 1 hour to write one page. Therefore, he spends 5 hours per week writing letters. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he spends 20 hours per month writing letters. Over the course of a year, which consists of 52 weeks, he spends a total of 1040 hours (20 x 52) writing letters. However, since he stopped being penpals with 2 of the people after a year, we need to subtract their share from the total time spent writing letters. Let's assume that the two people he stopped being penpals with accounted for half of his total correspondence, or 520 hours (half of 1040). So, the remaining amount of time he spent writing letters is 520 - 52 = 468 hours."
"Response: 2700 

Explanation:
Jason has a total of 1000 minutes in his phone plan for the month. He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, which is equal to 45 minutes per week (since there are 7 days in a week). Therefore, Jason uses up 45 x 30 = 1350 minutes of his phone plan on calls to his boss alone.

Additionally, he has used up an additional 300 minutes on calls to other people. So, the total amount of minutes Jason has used up is 1350 + 300 = 1650 minutes.

Since this month has 30 days, we can divide the total number of minutes used by the number of days in the month to find out how many minutes Jason has left: 1650 / 30 = 55 minutes per day or 2700 minutes for the entire month."
"Response:  B) 10

Explanation:
Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 French fries initially.
2. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so he took 10 fries (since Kyle took 5).
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which is equal to 5 fries (as per the problem statement). So, now Griffin has 14 fries (19 - 5 + 5 = 14).
5. Colby took 3 fewer fries than what Kyle took, which means Colby took 2 fries (since Kyle took 5).
6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries, which means he gained 3 more fries (24 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 27).
7. Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries (27 - 14 = 10).

So, the answer is B) 10."
Response:  Let's assume that the number of fish in Aquarium A is x. Since the difference between the number of snails in Aquarium A and Aquarium B is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write : Snail s in Aqua r ium A = 2x Fish in Aquarium A + 16 Snails in Aquarium B = 32 - 2x Fish in Aquarium A  Now, we know that the number of snails in Aquarium B is 32 - 2x. So, if we substitute this value into the first equation above, we get : Snail s in Aqua r ium A = 2x Fish in Aquarium A + 16 (32 - 2x ) = 70 We can simplify this equation by subtracting 16 from both sides : Snail s in Aqua r ium A = 2x Fish in Aquarium A + 16 = 54 Therefore, there are 54 fish in Aquarium A. Similarly, since the number of snails in Aquarium B is 32 - 2x, we can find out the number of fish in Aquarium B as follows : Snail s in Aqua r ium B = 32 - 2x = 48 Therefore, there are 48 fish in Aquarium B.
"Response:  A) $3,750 B) $4,800 C) $5,760 D) $6,900 E) $7,840
Answer: C) $5,760
Explanation:
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost for one day's worth of makeup (6 hours x $250/hour = $1,500). Since Jean needs this done 4 times a week, the total cost for one week would be ($1,500 x 4 = $6,000). Since the movie lasts for 5 weeks, the total cost for the entire movie would be ($6,000 x 5 = $30,000). However, since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, the final cost would be ($30,000 x 0.9 = $27,000). Therefore, Jean paid $5,760 for the makeup services throughout the movie shoot."
Response:  Each person paid $79 ($22 / 3 = $79).
Response:  The chef spent a total of $600 ($1.50 x 4 bags) to buy the 4 bags of onions.
"Response:  Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find out how many cookies Sue ate on each day:

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 4 x = 16 cookies (since her sister ate 5 cookies).
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x = 28 cookies (since her sister ate 13 cookies).
Now, let's find out how many calories Sue consumed compared to her sister:

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total number of calories Sue consumed as follows:
Sue consumed = Number of cookies eaten x Calories per cookie
= 16 x 200 = 3200 calories

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
Difference in calories = Total calories consumed by Sue - Total calories consumed by her sister
= 3200 - (5 + 13) x 200
= 3200 - 720
= 2480 calories

Therefore, Sue consumed 2480 more calories than her sister."
