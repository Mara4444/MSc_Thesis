To find out how much money Janet makes in dollars every day at the farmer's market, we need to subtract the number of eggs she uses for breakfast and baking from the total number of eggs her ducks lay each day. Let's do that:

Total eggs per day = 16 (from the problem statement)
Eggs used for breakfast = 3 (three eggs per day)
Eggs used for baking = 4 (four eggs per day)

Now let's subtract the eggs used for breakfast and baking from the total number of eggs:

16 - 3 - 4 = 9

So, Janet has 9 eggs left over after using eggs for breakfast and baking. Since each egg sells for $2, she earns:

9 x $2 = $18

Therefore, Janet earns $18 per day selling her extra eggs at the farmer's market."

To find out how much profit Josh made from selling the house after renovating it, we need to subtract the original purchase price of the house ($80,000) from the new value of the house after renovations ($130,000). This gives us:

Profit = New Value - Original Purchase Price
= $130,000 - $80,000
= $50,000

So Josh made a profit of $50,000 from selling the house after renovating it."

To find out how much money Kylar needs to pay for the 16 vasos, we need to calculate the total cost of all the vasos first. Since each second vase costs only 60% of the price of the first one, we can use this information to our advantage and save some money!
Let's start by calculating the cost of the first vase:
1 vase x $5 = $5
Now let's calculate the cost of the second vase using the discounted price:
2 vases x $5 x 60% = $5 x 60% = $3
So, the total cost of the two vasos is:
$5 + $3 = $8
Now that we know the cost of two vasos, we can easily calculate the cost of 16 vasos:
16 vasos x $8 = $128
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $128 to buy 16 vasos."

Let's start by identifying what we know and how to represent it numerically:

1. In Toulouse, there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston.
2. In Charleston, there are 4 times more sheep than in Seattle.
3. In Seattle, there are 20 sheep.

We can start by finding out how many sheep there are in Charleston:

Charleston has 2 x (4 x 20) = 8 x 20 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's find out how many sheep there are in Toulouse:

Toulouse has 2 x 160 = 320 sheep.

So, in total, there are:

320 + 160 = 480 sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle."
"Response: 
The total size of the file is 200 GB, and it takes 2 minutes to download 2 GB (1/60 x 200,000 MB = 2 minutes). Therefore, the time required to download the entire file would be:

Time = Total Size / Download Speed
= 200,000 MB / 2 GB/minute
= 100,000 minutes

Since Windows forces a restart in the middle of the download, we need to add the time spent waiting for the restart to the overall time. Let's assume that the restart occurs after downloading 80% of the file (i.e., 160,000 MB out of 200,000 MB):

Time = Total Size / Download Speed + Time Waiting for Restart
= 100,000 minutes + (160,000 MB / 2 GB/minute) \* 20 minutes
= 100,000 minutes + 32,000 minutes
= 132,000 minutes

Therefore, the total time required to download the entire file would be approximately 132,000 minutes or about 22 hours."
"Response: 

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Distance traveled during first 3 hours at 60 mph = 3 x 60 = 180 miles
2. Time spent in traffic jam (first 2 hours) = 2 hours
3. Speed during last 2 hours = 30 mph
4. Total distance to be covered = 180 + (2 x 30) = 180 + 60 = 240 miles
5. Time taken to cover the remaining distance after the traffic jam = 2 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled during each hour of the second part of the journey:

Distance traveled during each hour = 80 miles/hour x number of hours

Since there are 2 hours left to cover the remaining distance, we can calculate the total distance traveled as follows:

Total distance traveled during the last 2 hours = 2 x 80 = 160 miles

Therefore, the total distance from the house at the end of the 4 hours is:

Total distance = 240 + 160 = 400 miles"
"Response: 
To calculate how much Eliza earns this week, we need to first determine her total hours worked for the week. Since she works 45 hours, we can calculate her total earnings as follows:

Total hours = 45 hours
Tariff per hour (first 40 hours) = $10/hour
Overtime rate (for hours beyond 40) = 1.2 x $10/hour

First 40 hours:
Total earnings = Tariff per hour x Total hours
= $10/hour x 40 hours
= $400

Overtime hours:
Total earnings += Overtime rate x Total hours
= $10/hour x 5 hours
= $50

Total earnings += $400 + $50
= $450

Therefore, Eliza earns $450 this week."
"Response: 
Let x be the number of downloads in the first month. Since there were 60 downloads in the first month, we can write an equation based on that information:
x + 3(3x) = 60... (1)
Simplifying the equation:
4x + 9x = 60... (2)
13x = 60... (3)
Dividing both sides by 13:
x = 5... (4)
So, there were 5 downloads in the first month.
Now, let's find out how many downloads there were in each of the other two months:
In the second month, there were three times as many downloads as there were in the first month:
3x = 5 x 3 = 15... (5)
Therefore, there were 15 downloads in the second month.
In the third month, there was a 30% reduction from the previous month:
15 - (15 x 0.3) = 15 - 4.5 = 10.5... (6)
Therefore, there were 10.5 downloads in the third month.
Adding up all the downloads for the three months:
5 + 15 + 10.5 = 30.5... (7)
Therefore, the program had 30.5 downloads during the three months."

* Mini pastelillos: 2 docenas x $80/docena = $160
* Tortitas de queso: 6 docenas x $55/docena = $330

Total cost: $204 + $160 + $330 = $794

Therefore, the total cost of all the pastries that Toula bought was $794."
"Response: 4 years.
Explanation: The initial investment is $90 and annual expenses are $3, so the total amount needed to be invested is $90 + $3 = $93. Since each year the tree will produce 7 lemons that can be sold for $1.5 each, in 4 years the revenue generated by selling the lemons will cover the initial investment and the annual expenses:

Year 1: Revenue from lemons = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5
Year 2: Revenue from lemons = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5
Year 3: Revenue from lemons = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5
Year 4: Revenue from lemons = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5
Total revenue over 4 years = $10.5 x 4 = $42
Total amount needed to be invested = $93
Since the total revenue over 4 years covers the initial investment and the annual expenses, it will take 4 years for the limonero to begin generating profit."

To maximize the profit at the end of the month, the merchant should choose the option of buying jewelry for $5000 because it is expected to appreciate by 2.5%, which is higher than the appreciation rate of electronic devices. The estimated gain can be calculated as follows:

Gain = (Purchase price x Appreciation rate) / 100

For jewelry:
Gain = ($5000 x 2.5%) / 100
= $1250

For electronic devices:
Gain = ($8000 x 1.2%) / 100
= $960

Therefore, the merchant's estimated gain from choosing the jewelry option would be $1250, while the estimated gain from choosing the electronic devices option would be $960."

To calculate Jill's annual salary as a teacher and a fitness coach, we need to first determine her weekly hours for each job. As a teacher, she works 35 hours per week, and as a fitness coach, she works 15 hours per week. Next, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a week to get her weekly earnings for each job. Finally, we add up her weekly earnings from both jobs to find her total weekly income. To convert this to an annual salary, we can multiply her total weekly income by 50 (the number of weeks in a year).

Here is the calculation:

As a Teacher:
Weekly Earnings = $20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week

As a Fitness Coach:
Weekly Earnings = $30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week

Total Weekly Income = $700 + $450 = $1,150/week

Annual Salary = $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year"

To find out how many dozen eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we need to calculate how many eggs she consumes per day and then multiply that by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Let's assume that Claire consumes 3 eggs per day (since she makes a tortilla with 3 eggs every morning). Therefore, her daily egg consumption is:

3 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week

Now, let's calculate how many eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks:

21 eggs/week x 4 weeks = 84 eggs

So, Claire will consume 84 eggs in 4 weeks."
"Response: 3 miles per hour. 
Explanation: To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk for the remaining distance of 6 miles, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the total distance traveled (in this case, 12 miles), r is the rate at which she walks (which we want to find out), and t is the time taken to cover that distance. Since she has already walked for 4 miles in the first two hours, she has left with 8 miles to cover. We know that she took 2 hours to cover the first 4 miles, so she will take 2 x 2 = 4 hours to cover the remaining 8 miles. Therefore, her speed for the remaining distance is:  
speed = distance / time  
= 8 miles / 4 hours  
= 2 miles/hour  
Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles/hour, she should walk at a speed of:  
average speed = (total distance / total time)  
= (12 miles / 4 hours + 8 miles / 4 hours) / 2  
= (4 miles/hour + 2 miles/hour) / 2  
= 3 miles/hour
Therefore, Marissa should walk at a speed of 3 miles per hour for the remaining 6 miles to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour."

To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters of drinks, we need to subtract the amount of water that was spilled (1 liter) from the total amount of water present in both types of drinks.

Let X be the number of liters of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink and Y be the number of liters of water in the 10 liters of orange drink.

We know that X + Y = 3/5(15) + 2/3(10) = 9 + 6 = 15 liters (since 3/5 of 15 is 9 liters and 2/3 of 10 is 6 liters).

Now, since 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, the amount of water left in the combined drinks is:
X + Y - 1 = 15 + 6 - 1 = 18 liters.

So, there are 18 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of drinks."

To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to multiply the number of items she bought by their cost per item. Let's do this for each type of clothing:

Shorts: 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
Pants: 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
Shoes: 3 x $42 = $126
Total: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total amount she will spend in those 60 days. Since she buys 15 portions of ice cream each day at $4 per box, her daily spending is:

$4 x 15 = $60 per day

Since there are 30 days in April and May, Cynthia will spend:

$60 x 30 = $1800 on ice cream for both months

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $1800 on ice cream after 60 days."

"Response: 
Let's denote the cost of one pair of high-heeled shoes as x. Since there are two pairs, we have to multiply by 2 to get the total cost: 
2x
Now, let's subtract the cost of the boots from the total cost:  
2x - b
where b is the cost of the boots.
We know that the difference between the total cost and the cost of the boots is equal to five dollars:  
2x - b = 5
Simplifying the equation:  
2x = b + 5
Solving for x:  
x = (b + 5) / 2
Since we know that one pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33, we can substitute this value into the expression above:  
x = ($33 + 5) / 2  
x = $38 / 2  
x = $19
So, each pair of high-heeled shoes costs $19. Therefore, the cost of both pairs would be:  
2x = 2($19) = $38
The cost of the boots is $38 - $19 = $19."

To find the average of the three estimates, we need to convert each estimate into a numerical value. Let's do that:

1. 80 = 80
2. 20 + (1/2) × 80 = 20 + 40 = 60
3. 25% more than 80 = 80 + (25/100) × 80 = 80 + 20 = 100

Now, we add all three numbers:

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

So, the average of the three estimates is 240."

Let's start by identifying what we know and what we need to find out. We know that Mike played for 40 minutes and gained points according to two different rates. For the first 20 minutes, he gained 4 points per minute, and for the second 20 minutes, he gained 25% more than the previous 20 minutes. To find out how many points Mike gained in total, we need to calculate the number of points he gained during each period and then add them up.

First 20 minutes:
Mike gained 4 points per minute, so he gained 4 x 20 = 80 points during the first 20 minutes.

Second 20 minutes:
During the second 20 minutes, Mike gained 25% more points than he did during the first 20 minutes. So, he gained (1.25 x 80) = 100 points during the second 20 minutes.

Total points gained:
To find the total number of points Mike gained, we add the number of points he gained during each period:
80 + 100 = 180

Therefore, Mike gained a total of 180 points while playing pimpón for 40 minutes."

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* John has 13 Lego games that he sells for $15 each.
* He uses the money to buy 8 video games at $20 each.
* He has $5 left over after buying the video games.

We can start by calculating how much money John makes from selling his Lego games:

13 x $15 = $195

Now we know how much money John has to spend on video games:

$195 - $20(8) = $195 - $160 = $35

John has $35 left over after buying the video games. Since he has $5 left over and he spent $35, he must have bought all 8 video games with the $35. So, he doesn't have any Lego games left.

Therefore, the answer is:

0

No Lego games left."
"Response: 

To solve this problem, we need to use information from all parts of the question. Let's start by identifying what we know:

1. John runs 60 miles per week (given in the question).
2. He runs 3 days a week (also given in the question).
3. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours (mentioned in the question).
4. On the other two days, he runs for half of what he runs on the first day (this is not explicitly stated, but we can infer it based on the information provided).

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find John's velocity. We know that he runs for 3 hours on the first day and for half of that time on the other two days. So, if we call the distance he runs on each day ""x"", then we have the following equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 = 60 miles/week

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3x + x/2 = 60 miles/week

Combining like terms, we get:

5x/2 = 60 miles/week

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 30 miles/day

So, John runs 30 miles per day, three days a week. To find his velocity, we need to divide his distance traveled by the time it takes him to travel that distance:

velocity = distance / time
= 30 miles / 3 hours
= 10 miles/hour

Therefore, John's velocity is 10 miles per hour."

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Dana can run at a speed of four times her walking speed.
2. Dana can jump at a speed of half her running speed.
3. Dana can walk for two-thirds of the time she spends running.
4. Dana can cover 3 miles per hour while jumping.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how far Dana can travel in six hours. We know that Dana will spend two-thirds of the time running and one-third jumping. So, if she runs for x hours, she will jump for (x/3) hours.

Since Dana can cover 3 miles per hour while jumping, we know that she will cover 3x/3 miles while jumping. Now, let's add up the total distance Dana will cover in six hours:

Distance covered while running = x miles
Distance covered while jumping = 3x/3 miles
Total distance covered = x + 3x/3 miles
= 5x/3 miles

So, the total distance Dana can cover in six hours is 5x/3 miles. Since we don't know the value of x yet, we cannot determine the exact distance Dana can cover. However, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:

5x/3 = 6(3)

Solving for x, we get:

5x/3 = 18

x = 18 \* 3/5

x = 54

Therefore, Dana can cover 54 miles in six hours if she runs for two-thirds of the time and jumps for one-third of the time."

To determine how many grams of potato chips (papas fritas) can be eaten if one's daily calorie goal is 2000 and they have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to subtract the number of calories already consumed from the total daily calorie goal. This will give us the remaining calories available for consumption.

Let's start by calculating the number of calories already consumed:

1800 calories / 5 portions = 360 calories per portion

Now, let's calculate the remaining calories available for consumption:

2000 - 360 = 1640 calories

Since each serving of potato chips contains 250 calories, we can eat:

1640 calories / 250 calories per serving = 6.56 servings

Therefore, the person can eat approximately 6.56 servings of potato chips, which is equivalent to 167 grams (6.56 x 250 grams per serving)."
"Response: 
To find Charlie's net gain from making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of producing one candle and then multiply it by the number of candles being sold.

Total Cost = Cost of wax + Cost of wicks
= $10 (per lb of wax) + ($ per unit of wicks)
= $10 + ($2 x 10)
= $10 + $20
= $30

Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated from selling 20 candles:

Revenue = Number of Candles x Price per Candle
= 20 x $2
= $40

So, Charlie's net gain is:

Net Gain = Revenue - Total Cost
= $40 - $30
= $10

Therefore, Charlie will have a net gain of $10 for each batch of 20 candles she makes and sells."
"Response: 

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Total number of articles written by Meredith during the week = 5 (on Monday) + 2 × 5 (on Tuesday) + 2 × 5 (on Wednesday) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 articles
2. Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
3. Number of articles written on Monday = 5
4. Number of articles written on Tuesday = 2 × 5 = 10
5. Number of articles written on Wednesday = 2 × 5 = 10

Now, let's calculate the total time spent by Meredith writing these articles:

Total time spent on Monday = 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Total time spent on Tuesday = 10 articles x 4 hours per article = 40 hours
Total time spent on Wednesday = 10 articles x 4 hours per article = 40 hours

Total time spent by Meredith during the three days = 20 + 40 + 40 = 100 hours

Therefore, the answer is 100 hours."

"Response: 
Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of red ties and ""y"" to represent the number of blue ties. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can write an equation based on that information:

2x = y + 2(40)

where ""2(40)"" represents the total amount spent on blue ties (2 x $40).

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

2x = y + 80

Now we are asked how much John spent on corbatas. To find this out, we need to know how many red ties he bought. So let's solve for ""x"":

2x = 200 / 40

2x = 5

Therefore, John spent $100 on red ties ($40 x 5) and $200 on blue ties ($40 x 5 + $80)."

Tracy used a piece of wire that was 4 feet long to hold up her tomato plants in the garden. She cut it into pieces that were each 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces she got, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

4 feet / 6 inches =?

Solving for x (the number of pieces), we get:

x = 4 feet / 6 inches
= 4 / 0.5
= 8

So Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire, each one 6 inches long."

To find the total number of vacant units in the building, we need to calculate the total number of units in each floor and then multiply it by the number of floors that are not fully occupied (i.e., 3/4).

Total number of units per floor = 8
Number of floors with partial occupancy = 3/4 = 12 (since there are 15 floors in total)

Therefore, the total number of vacant units is:

Total number of vacant units = Total number of units per floor x Number of floors with partial occupancy
= 8 x 12
= 96

So, there are 96 vacant units in the building."
"Response: 
To find out how much Lloyd earns per week from selling eggs, we need to first calculate how many dozen eggs he sells in a day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

Let's start with the information given in the problem:

* The number of gallinas (chickens) is not specified, but let's assume there are enough chickens to produce 252 eggs per day.
* Each egg costs $2, so the total daily revenue from selling eggs is:

252 eggs x $2/egg = $504/day

Now, let's consider the number of days in a week:

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly revenue from selling eggs is:

$504/day x 7 days = $3,528/week

So, Lloyd earns $3,528 per week from selling eggs."

* Time of navigation = 4 hours (from 1 pm to 4 pm)
* Speed during return journey = 6 miles per hour

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the return journey:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values we have:

Explanation: To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we need to subtract the weight of the comics from the total weight of the bag. We know that each comic book weighs 1/4 lb and there are 30 of them, so the total weight of the comics is 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 lbs. If Uriah wants to remove 15 lbs from the bag, then he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 lbs more. Since each toy weights 1/2 lb, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove: 7.5 / 1/2 = 6. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 6 toys from his bag."

The day with higher earnings for the mechanic is Friday because he earned more money repairing automobile tires than on Thursday when he only repaired truck tires. To calculate the difference in earnings, we need to find out how much the mechanic earned on each day and then subtract the lesser amount from the greater amount.

Let's first calculate the total earnings for each day:

Thursday:
6 x $60 = $360 (for truck tires) + 4 x $40 = $160 (for car tires) = $520
Friday:
12 x $40 = $480 (for car tires)

The price of the grocery purchase after all the additional fees and taxes can be calculated as follows:

Total cost of groceries = $40.00 (final bill)
Tariff added by delivery service = $10.00 (25% of $40.00)
Delivery fee = $3.00
Prop tip = $4.00

Final price of groceries = Total cost + Tariff + Delivery fee + Prop tip
= $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00
= $67.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's grocery purchase was $67.00."

To find out how much Janet paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the item first. The cost of the item is the sum of the price of the material and the price of the jeweler's work.

Cost = Price of material + Price of jeweler's work
= $500 + $800
= $1300

Next, we need to calculate the amount that Janet paid for the insurance premium. Since the question states that she paid 10% of the total cost, we can calculate the premium as follows:

Premium = Total cost x Insurance percentage
= $1300 x 10%
= $130

So, Janet paid a total of $1430 ($1300 + $130) for the brooch."
"Response: 

To calculate the annual pension amount, we need to determine the value of the pension at the time of retirement (after 30 years) and then apply the formula provided in the problem statement.

Let's assume that the present value of the pension is PV = $50,000 per year for 40 years, which means the total present value of the pension is:

PV = $50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000

Now, let's calculate the percentage increase each year based on the formula provided:

Increase = (PV x 5%) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n))

where:

* PV = present value of the pension
* r = rate of return (5% in this case)
* n = number of years (30 years in this case)

Using the above values, we can calculate the increase as follows:

Increase = ($2,000,000 x 5%) / (1 - (1 + 0.05)^(-30))
= $100,000 / 0.6879
= $147,000

So, after 30 years, the pension will be increased by $147,000, resulting in a new annual pension amount of:

New Annual Pension = $50,000 + $147,000 = $197,000

Therefore, if Si Marcy retires after 30 years, their annual pension will be $197,000."
"Response: 
To calculate the total amount that Aleena will have paid for the streaming service at the end of the year, we need to first find out how much she paid in each half of the year. Let's assume that the company charged her $140 per month for both halves of the year.

For the first half of the year (January to June), Aleena paid $140 x 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year (July to December), Aleena paid $140 x 6 = $840, but since the company charged her 10% less, she paid $840 x 90% = $752.

Therefore, the total amount that Aleena will have paid for the streaming service at the end of the year is:
$840 + $752 = $1,592."

Sophia can drive approximately 360 miles (12 gallons / 4 gallons per 100 miles) with one tank of gasoline.  
Explanation: 
To find out how far Sophia can go with one tank of gasoline, we need to divide the number of gallons in her tank by the number of gallons she uses per 100 miles. According to the problem, there are 12 gallons in her tank and she uses 4 gallons for every 100 miles she drives. Therefore, we can calculate as follows: 
12 gallons / 4 gallons/100 miles = 360 miles 
So Sophia can travel approximately 360 miles with one tank of gasoline."
"Response: 
To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading over four weeks, we need to calculate the total time he spends in each activity and then multiply it by the number of times he does it per week.

Time spent watching TV = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week
Time spent reading = 1/2 hour/day x 7 days/week = 3.5 hours/week

Total time spent watching TV over four weeks = 14 hours/week x 4 weeks = 56 hours
Total time spent reading over four weeks = 3.5 hours/week x 4 weeks = 14 hours

Therefore, Jim spends 56 hours watching TV and 14 hours reading over four weeks."

"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* There were 175 diamonds.
* There were 35 rubies less than the number of diamonds.
* There were twice as many emeralds as there were rubies.

We can let ""E"" be the number of emeralds and ""R"" be the number of rubies. Since there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, we know that E = 2R.

Now we can set up an equation based on the information given:

175 + R + E =? (total number of gems)

Using the fact that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, we can write:

175 + R + E = 175 + R - 35 +? (total number of gems)

Simplifying the equation:

175 + R + E = 175 + R - 35 + E (since there are twice as many emeralds as rubies)

Solving for E:

E = 2(R + 35)

Substituting R = 35 (number of rubies):

E = 2(35 + 35)

E = 2 x 70

E = 140

So there were 140 emeralds in the cofre."

"Response: 

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Bailey had at the beginning and how much he received each week. Let's start by writing down what we know:

* Bailey started with some amount of money (x)
* He received $5 per week for 8 weeks
* At the end of the 8 weeks, he had $100 in total

Now let's think about how we can use these clues to figure out x. We know that Bailey received $5 per week for 8 weeks, so he received a total of:

5 x 8 = 40 dollars

We also know that at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey had $100 in total, so we can set up an equation:

x + 40 = 100

Now we can solve for x by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x + 40 - 40 = 100 - 40

x = 60

So Bailey began with $60."

"Response: 
To calculate how much Sheila will pay each month for three months, we need to first determine the total cost of the five cell phones and then divide that amount by the number of months she is financing them. We can use the formula below to do this:

Total Cost = (Number of Units x Price per Unit) + (Interest Rate x Total Cost)

Since there are five units, the total cost would be:

Total Cost = (5 x $150) + ($150 x 2%)
= $750 + $30
= $780

Now, let's divide the total cost by the number of months she is financing them:

Monthly Payment = Total Cost / Number of Months
= $780 / 3
= $260

Therefore, Sheila will pay $260 each month for three months to finance her five cell phones."

To find out how much money Artie will obtain by selling his flowers, we need to calculate the total amount of money he will receive from each type of flower and then add it all up. Let's start by calculating the total amount for each type of flower:

Caléndulas: 12 x $2.74 = $33.04
Petunias: 9 x $1.87 = $16.83
Begonias: 17 x $2.12 = $35.04

Now let's add up the totals for all three types of flowers:
$33.04 + $16.83 + $35.04 = $85.87

Therefore, Artie will obtain $85.87 if he sells 12 macetas of caléndulas, 9 macetas of petunias, and 17 macetas of begonias."

To find out how many bags of food Cecilia will use during the first year, we need to calculate the number of days in the first year and then multiply that by the daily amount of food she needs to feed her puppy.

There are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years for simplicity). During the first 180 days, Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 tbsp/day, so she'll use:

180 days x 1 tbsp/day = 180 tbsp

For the remaining 185 days, Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 2 tbsp/day, so she'll use:

185 days x 2 tbsp/day = 370 tbsp

Total amount of food needed during the first year:

180 tbsp + 370 tbsp = 550 tbsp

Since each bag contains 110 tbsp, Cecilia will use:

550 tbsp / 110 tbsp/bag = 4.91 bags

So, Cecilia will use approximately 4.91 bags of food during the first year."
"Response: 
Let's say that David washes x pounds of clothes and Sarah washes 4x pounds of clothes. Since Raymond only washes half as much as Sarah, he washes (1/2)x pounds of clothes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

David's clothes = 4(Sarah's clothes) - Raymond's clothes

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

x = 4(400) - (1/2)x

Solving for x, we find that David washes 1600 - (1/2)x pounds of clothes.

So, the difference between the amount of clothes that David and Raymond wash is:

1600 - (1/2)x

Therefore, the answer is 1600 - (1/2)x pounds of clothes."

To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the total cost of 18 flowers at both prices and compare them. Let's do that!

Option 1 (buy 3 flowers per stem):
18 flowers x 3 stems/flower = 54 stems
Total cost = 54 stems x $2.50/stem = $135

Option 2 (buy 2 flowers per stem):
18 flowers x 2 stems/flower = 36 stems
Total cost = 36 stems x $1.00/stem = $36

Since Option 2 is cheaper, Vincent will save $99 ($135 - $36) if he buys 18 flowers in ramos of 2 units each."

To find out how much the haircut will cost with the discount, we can use the following steps:

First, calculate the full price of the service without the discount:
$100 (full price) x 100% = $100

Next, calculate the discount as a percentage of the full price:
$100 (full price) x 30% = $30

Now, subtract the discount from the full price to get the final price with the discount:
$100 (full price) - $30 (discount) = $70

Therefore, the final price of the haircut with the 30% discount is $70."

The first time the alarm sounded for four times, so we can start by writing down this information as follows:

4 (first time)

The second time it sounded three times more than the first time, which means that if the first time was x, then the second time would be:

3x + 3 = 7 (second time)

Now, the third time it sounded half of the time of the second time, which is half of 7:

(1/2) \* 7 = 3.5 (third time)

Since an alarm cannot sound for a fraction of a time, let's round up to the nearest whole number:

3 (third time)

So, in total, the alarm sounded 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 times."

"Response: 
To calculate how much Christina will spend on gift bags for her birthday party, we need to first determine how many guests she expects to have. Since 1/4 of the invited guests do not arrive, we can assume that 4/4 or 100% of the remaining guests (i.e., 16 - 4 = 12) will attend. Therefore, the number of gift bags needed is:

Gift bags needed = Number of attending guests x Gift bag quantity per guest
= 12 x 0.75
= 9

Since each gift bag costs $2, Christina will spend:

Total cost = Number of gift bags x Cost per gift bag
= 9 x $2
= $18

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags for her birthday party."

Ted must bring 30 pounds of coleslaw to the picnic if he wants enough for all 20 adults and 5 children.  

Question: What is the logic behind your answer? 
Answer: 
The logic behind my answer is that each adult will eat 10 pounds of coleslaw, and since there are 20 adults, that's 20 x 10 = 200 pounds of coleslaw. Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so 5 children will eat 5 x 10 = 50 pounds of coleslaw. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 200 + 50 = 300 pounds of coleslaw to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough."

"Response: 

To solve this problem, we need to use information from the problem and some basic math operations. Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Freda uses canned tomatoes that are 16 ounces each.
* Each can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.
* The volume of the salsa prepared by Freda is 32 ounces.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many tomatoes Freda used. We know that the volume of the salsa is 32 ounces, and each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. So, if we divide the volume of the salsa by the volume of one can of tomatoes, we should get the number of cans (and therefore the number of tomatoes) needed to make the salsa:

32 ÷ 16 =?

Do you see how we can use division to solve for the number of cans (and tomatoes)? Now, all we need to do is simplify the fraction:

32 ÷ 16 = 2

So, Freda used two cans of tomatoes to make her salsa!"

* The third friend tooted the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend tooted the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now let's add up all the times the friends tooted the doorbell:

20 + 5 + 70 = 95

So, the doorbell sounded 95 times."

To find out how many pages Solo must read each day to complete all the reading in 4 days, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days left. In this case, there are 3 days left (Monday was already done). So, we can calculate as follows:

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages
Days left = 3 days

Now, let's divide the total pages by the days left:

Pages per day = Total pages / Days left
= 49 pages / 3 days
= 16 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of 16 pages per day for the next 3 days to complete all the reading."

To calculate how much Sasha will gain by selling all of her extra lumber, we need to first determine the total cost of the lumber she has left.

Total cost = (10 tables x $10 each) + (5 tables x $16 each)
= $100 + $80
= $180

Since Sasha bought the lumber at a 50% increase in price, she can sell it for 50% more than what she paid for it. Therefore, she can sell each table for:

Selling price = Cost x 1.5
= $180 x 1.5
= $270

So, if Sasha sells all of her extra lumber, she will gain:

Gain = Total cost x Number of items sold
= $180 x 15 (tables)
= $2,700

Therefore, Sasha will gain $2,700 by selling all of her extra lumber."

To find out how much money Dillon will spend in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item he is buying and then add them up. Let's start by finding out how much one sandía costs:

According to the problem, one sandía costs three times as much as one pimiento, so:

Sandía = 3 x Pimiento
= 3 x $15
= $45

Now let's find out how much one naranja costs:

Naranja = Sandía - $5
= $45 - $5
= $40

So, Dillon will spend:

$45 x 4 (number of sandías) = $180
+ $15 x 20 (number of pimientos) = $300
+ $40 x 10 (number of naranjas) = $400

Total amount spent = $180 + $300 + $400 = $980

The total revenue generated by the hospital from these visits is calculated as follows:
Total Revenue = Number of patients x Examination time x Price per hour
= 500 x 24 x $200
= $48,000

The total cost incurred by the hospital for providing these services is calculated as follows:
Total Cost = Number of patients x Examination time x Salary of doctors
= 500 x 24 x $150
= $36,000

Therefore, the gross profit earned by the hospital from these visits is:

To calculate the total cost of Rory's order with delivery to his home, we need to add up all the items he has requested and then apply the 20% service charge for delivery. We can do this by following these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item:

* 2 sandwiches x $7.50 = $15.00
* 2 bags of french fries x $1.50 = $3.00
* 2 cookies x $1.00 = $2.00

Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Step 2: Apply the 20% service charge for delivery:

$20.00 x 20% = $4.00

Total cost of items with delivery = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory wants to add a tip of $5.00, so the final total cost of his order with delivery will be:

$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00"

Explanation:
To find out how many questions were left incomplete, we need to calculate how long it would take Mark to complete each test at the given rate of 5 questions per hour.

For the first test with 75 questions, it would take him 75/5 = 15 hours to complete. Since he had 8 hours, that means he left 15 - 8 = 7 questions incomplete.

For the second test with 100 questions, it would take him 100/5 = 20 hours to complete. Since he had only 6 hours, that means he left 20 - 6 = 14 questions incomplete.

Therefore, Mark left 7 + 14 = 21 questions incomplete."

To calculate the total cost of all items including tax, we need to first find the cost without tax and then add the tax amount.

Cost without tax = (2 x $2) + (3 x $3) + (3 x $3) + (4 x $4) = $6 + $9 + $9 + $12 = $36

Tax amount = ($36 x 10%) = $3.60

Total cost with tax = Cost without tax + Tax amount = $36 + $3.60 = $39.60"

To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in one year, we need to calculate how many pineappps he can harvest per month and then multiply that by 12 months.
Let's start with the number of pineapples per hectare:
100 piñas/hectárea = 1000 piñas/10 hectáreas (since there are 10 hectares)
Now let's calculate how many pineapples John can harvest per month:
1000 piñas / 3 months = 333 piñas/month
Now let's multiply by 12 months:
333 piñas/month x 12 months = 4000 piñas/year
Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in one year."

To find out how many blocks Johnny will collect if he gathers all the Lego pieces, we need to calculate the total number of pieces in each box and then add them up. Let's start by looking at the information given in the problem:

* The first box has 500 pieces.
* The second box has 3 times as many pieces as the first box, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.
* The third box has 1/4 of the number of pieces in the first box, so it has 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces.

Now let's add up the total number of pieces in all three boxes:

500 + 1500 + 125 = 2225

So Johnny will have 2225 blocks if he gathers all the Lego pieces."

Let's start by identifying the information we have been given:

* In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive and did not return.
* In the next 6 hours, half of the number of bees that had left (i.e., 15) returned to the hive.
* Two times as many bees left the hive in the second period as left in the first period (i.e., twice 30 is 60).
* All the bees that had left but did not return in the first period came back to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Now let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours. We know that there were 60 bees that left the hive in the second period, and since two-thirds of them returned (15 / 2 = 60 x 2/3), we can calculate the total number of bees that returned to the hive as follows:

Total number of bees returning = Number of bees leaving in the second period x Proportion of bees returning
= 60 x 2/3
= 40

Therefore, Debra saw 40 bees returning to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."
"Response: 

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* The cost of admission for adults is $12.
* The cost of admission for children is $10.
* Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8.

We can let X represent the number of adult admissions and Y represent the number of child admissions. Since there are two people going to the museum (Brittany and her mother), we know that X + Y = 2.

Using the information about the costs, we can write an equation based on the total amount paid:

X(12) + Y(10) = 8

Simplify the equation:

12X + 10Y = 8

Now solve for X:

12X = 8 - 10Y

X = 4

Since there are four adult admissions, we know that X = 4. Now we can find out how many child admissions there are:

Y = 2 (since there are only two child admissions)

So, Brittany's mother paid $8 for two adult admissions ($12 x 4) and one child admission ($10 x 2). Therefore, she paid a total of $16."

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Distance between school and Steve's house = 3 miles
* Speed of Steve on his bike = 440 feet/minute
* Distance between school and Tim's house = 2 miles
* Speed of Tim on his skates = 264 feet/minute

We can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled (in this case, both Steve and Tim are traveling to their homes), r is the rate at which they are traveling (their speeds), and t is the time it takes them to cover that distance.

For Steve:
d = 3r
d = 3(440)
d = 1320

Since Steve is traveling by bike, we know he will take longer than Tim to reach home. So, we need to find out how much longer. We can do this by subtracting the time it takes Tim to reach home from the time it takes Steve to reach home:

t_Steve - t_Tim = d_Steve / s_Steve - d_Tim / s_Tim

Substituting the values we have found:

t_Steve - t_Tim = 1320 / 440 - 264 / 264

Simplifying:

t_Steve - t_Tim = 3

So, Steve will arrive 3 minutes later than Tim at their respective homes."

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The cost of inflating one tire is $0.25.
2. There were 5 people who inflated two tires each (i.e., they had two tires to inflate).
3. Three people inflated all the tires of their tricycles (i.e., they had three tires to inflate).
4. One person inflated the tire of their monocycle.

Now, let's calculate the total number of tires that needed to be inflated:

5 people x 2 tires per person = 10 tires
3 people x 3 tires per person = 9 tires
1 person x 1 tire per person = 1 tire

Total number of tires = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires

Now, let's calculate the total amount earned by Shawnda:

20 tires x $0.25 per tire = $5

Therefore, Shawnda earned $5 on that day."

After that, a mapache took two-thirds of what remained (27 / 3 = 9), leaving 27 - 9 = 18. Finally, hormigas took one more patata, leaving 18 - 1 = 17. Therefore, there were originally 14 patatas in the package that Dave bought."

To find the total length of all the baked goods in feet, we need to convert each item's length from inches to feet first. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

* 300 panecillos x 4 inches/foot = 1200 inches (since there are no decimals)
* 120 croissants x 6 inches/foot = 720 inches (since there are no decimals)
* 60 baguettes x 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet (since there is no conversion needed here)

Adding up these values gives us a total length of:

1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods in feet is:

2040 inches / 12 inches/foot = 170 feet"

To calculate how much Jessica will pay in one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, we need to first determine the total amount of interest and fees that she will be charged over the course of the year. We can do this by calculating the total amount due for each debt based on the minimum payment and then subtracting that from the original principal balance to find out how much interest and fees have been added. Once we have the total interest and fees for each debt, we can add them up to get the grand total. Finally, we can multiply the grand total by 12 to convert it into an annual figure. Here's the calculation:

Student loans:
Minimum monthly payment = $300
Total amount due = $300 x 12 = $3600 (for the year)
Interest and fees = $3600 - ($300 x 12) = $3600 - $3600 = $0
New balance = $3600 + $0 = $3600

Credit card:
Minimum monthly payment = $200
Total amount due = $200 x 12 = $2400 (for the year)
Interest and fees = $2400 - ($200 x 12) = $2400 - $2400 = $0
New balance = $2400 + $0 = $2400

Mortgage:
Minimum monthly payment = $500
Total amount due = $500 x 12 = $6000 (for the year)
Interest and fees = $6000 - ($500 x 12) = $6000 - $6000 = $0
New balance = $6000 + $0 = $6000

Grand total = $3600 + $2400 + $6000 = $12000

If Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, her new monthly payments would be:

To calculate how long it will take Billy to prepare all the potatoes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends peeling and cutting each potato. Let's break down the process into two parts: peeling and cutting.

1. Peeling: Billy takes 1 minute and 30 seconds (1.5 minutes) to peel one potato.
2. Cutting: He takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Now, let's multiply the time taken for each step by the number of potatoes he needs to prepare:

Peeling: 1.5 minutes x 60 potatoes = 90 minutes (1.5 hours)
Cutting: 5 seconds x 60 potatoes = 300 seconds (5 minutes)

Adding both times gives us the total time required to prepare all the potatoes:

Total time = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to prepare all the potatoes for his family reunion."

To calculate the probability of getting a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability of getting each number from 4 to 6 and add them up. The probability of getting a number less than or equal to 3 is 1 - (the sum of the probabilities of getting numbers greater than 3).

Let's start by finding the probability of getting each number from 4 to 6:

P(4) = 1/6 = 0.17
P(5) = 2/6 = 0.33
P(6) = 3/6 = 0.50

Now, let's find the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers (i.e., 2 and 4):

P(2 and 4) = P(2) \* P(4|2) + P(4) \* P(2|4)
= (1/6) \* (1/3) + (1/6) \* (2/3)
= 0.17 \* 0.33 + 0.17 \* 0.67
= 0.06 + 0.11
= 0.17

The probability of getting two consecutive odd numbers (i.e., 3 and 5) is similar:

P(3 and 5) = P(3) \* P(5|3) + P(5) \* P(3|5)
= (1/6) \* (2/3) + (1/6) \* (1/3)
= 0.17 \* 0.67 + 0.17 \* 0.33
= 0.11 + 0.17
= 0.28

Finally, we can calculate the probability of getting a number greater than 3 as follows:

P(>3) = 1 - P(leq 3)
= 1 - (P(2 and 4) + P(3 and 5))
= 1 - 0.17 - 0.28
= 0.55

PV = Present Value (the initial amount borrowed, which is $100 in this case)
r = Monthly interest rate (2%/month)

Let's start by identifying the total costs incurred by the three friends:

Total Cost = Entrance Fee + Food + Attraction Fees

From the problem statement, we know that they spent $20,25 on entrance fees and $4,50 less on food than on entrances. Therefore, the total cost of food is:

Food Cost = Entrance Fee - ($4.50 x 3)
= $20.25 - ($13.50)
= $6.75

Now, let's calculate the total cost of attraction fees:

Attraction Fees = 2 x $33
= $66

Therefore, the total cost incurred by each friend is:

Total Cost per Person = (Entrance Fee + Food Cost + Attraction Fees) / 3
= ($20.25 + $6.75 + $66) / 3
= $93 / 3
= $31

So, each friend paid $31 for their trip to the fair."

To calculate how much money John earned that year, we need to add up all of his weekly earnings for the year, including the one-time prize money and the salary increase. Let's break it down as follows:

1. Weekly earnings before the prize: 2000 x 52 = 104,000 (for the first 52 weeks of the year)
2. One-time prize money: 5000
3. Salary increase: 5% of 2000 = 0.1 x 2000 = 200

Now let's add up all these amounts:

Total weekly earnings for the year = 104,000 + 5000 + 200 = 106,200

So John earned 106,200 in that year."
"Response: 
To find out how many barrels of wine are produced by Josie's farm per year, we need to multiply the number of tons of grapes produced per acre by the number of barrels of wine produced per ton of grapes. We know that each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, so:

5 tons/acre x 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels/acre

Since Josie has a 10-acre farm, we can multiply the number of barrels produced per acre by the number of acres she has:

10 barrels/acre x 10 acres = 100 barrels/year

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."

To find out how many green pens Janet has, we need to add the number of green pens she already had (22) to the number of green pens in each bag she bought (9). So, 
22 + 9 = 31
Janet has 31 green pens.

For the blue pens, we can do the same calculation:
31 + 9 = 40
Janet has 40 blue pens.

For the red pens, there are 6 in each bag, so:
40 + 6 = 46
Janet has 46 red pens.
In total, Janet has 31 green pens, 40 blue pens, and 46 red pens."

To get a final grade of 93, Brinley needs to have an average of 93 across all six exams. Since she can drop her lowest score, we'll calculate the average without that score first.

Let X be the score on the sixth exam. Then, the total score for the six exams is:

X + (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = X + 458

Since Brinley wants a final grade of 93, we set up the equation:

X + 458 = 93(6)

Solving for X, we get:

X = 93 - 458

X = 365

So, Brinley needs to score at least 365 on the sixth exam to achieve a final grade of 93."

To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we need to calculate the distance he rode each week during the four weeks of regular riding (5 times a week x 25 km/ride =) and then add that to the distance he rode each week during the three weeks of longer rides (2 times a week x 60 km/ride =).

Total distance = (4 weeks x 25 km/week) + (3 weeks x 60 km/week)
= (4 x 25) + (3 x 60)
= 100 km + 180 km
= 280 km

Therefore, Michael rode a total of 280 kilometers."
"Response: 

Solution: Let's start by identifying that we have two types of candies in the bag - chocolate bars and apple candy (manzanas confitadas). We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each piece of apple candy. So if each chocolate bar weighs 40g, then each piece of apple candy must weigh 20g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 pieces of apple candy, let's calculate how many grams of each type of candy is in the bag:

Chocolate bars: 25 x 40g = 1000g
Apple candy: 80 x 20g = 1600g
Total weight of bag: 1000 + 1600 = 2600g
Therefore, the total weight of Joe's candy bag is 2600g."

To find out how many pastries Rose bought in total over three days, we need to calculate the number of pastries she bought each day and then add them up. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Day 1 (Monday):
Rose bought 4 pastries.

Day 2 (Tuesday):
She bought 3 times as many pastries as she did on Monday, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 pastries.

Day 3 (Wednesday):
She bought 5 times as many pastries as she did on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 pastries.

Total number of pastries bought over 3 days:
4 + 12 + 60 = 76

Therefore, Rose bought 76 pastries over the course of three days."

Explanation: To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to divide the distance he walks (3 miles) by his speed (3 miles per hour). So, 

3 miles / 3 miles/hour = 1 hour

Since he walks for 2 hours, the total time is:

1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours"
Response: 300 (500 - 200 = 300)
"Response: 2 gallons (the amount of water in the small pool now).
Explanation: Let's denote the initial volume of water in the large pool as L and the initial volume of water in the small pool as S. Since both pools are losing water at the same rate, we know that the difference between their volumes is constant:

L - S = k \* t

where k is the rate at which water is being lost (4 gallons per minute) and t is time (in minutes).

We know that 4 minutes have passed, so we can substitute t = 4 into this equation:

L - S = k \* 4

Since the large pool had the same amount of water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, we know that:

L = S + (k \* 4)

Substituting the value of k (4 gallons per minute), we get:

L = S + 16

Now, we know that the large pool has four times the amount of water as the small pool, so we can set up an equation based on this information:

4S = L - S

Substituting the values from the previous equation, we get:

4S = L - S + 16

Simplifying, we get:

4S = 16 + L

Solving for S, we find that:

S = 2 gallons

Therefore, the small pool currently has 2 gallons of water."
"Response: 40 hours.
Explanation: To determine how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford her purchase, we need to calculate the total amount of money she earns per hour and compare it to the cost of the items she wants to buy.

Total amount earned per hour = $8/hour x number of hours worked

To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn enough money for her purchases, we set up an equation using the information given in the problem:

$320 (zapatos) + $32 (cinto) = Total Amount Earned

We know that Lori earns $8/hour, so we can divide the total amount earned by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:

$352 (total amount earned) / $8/hour = Number of Hours Worked

Solving for the number of hours, we get:

Number of Hours Worked = $352 / $8/hour = 40 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 40 hours before she can afford her purchases."
"Response: 
To calculate the remaining balance that John will owe to Jane after paying $165 per month for 12 months with a 10% interest rate, we can use the formula for calculating the future value of an investment:

FV = PV x (1 + r)^n

Where:
FV = Future Value (the amount left over after 12 months)
PV = Present Value (the initial principal amount borrowed, which is $2000 in this case)
r = Interest Rate (10% in this case)
n = Number of periods (12 months in this case)

Plugging in the values, we get:

FV = $2000 x (1 + 0.10)^(12)
= $2000 x 1.10^12
= $2348.97

So, after paying $165 per month for 12 months with a 10% interest rate, John will have paid a total of $2000 + ($2000 x 10%) = $2000 + $200 = $2200. However, he still owes $2348.97 - $2200 = $148.97 to Jane as the remaining balance."

"Response: 

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Adrian is three times as old as Harriet.
* Harriet is half of Zack's age.
* Harriet is currently 21 years old.

We can use this information to find the ages of each person:

* Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian's age = 3 x 21 = 63 years old.
* Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so Zack's age = 2 x 21 = 42 years old.

Now we need to find the average age of all three people after three years:

* Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old in three years.
* Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old in three years.
* Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old in three years.

To find the average age of all three people after three years, we add their ages and divide by three:

(66 + 45 + 24) / 3 = (175) / 3 = 58.33 years old

So, the average age of Adrian, Zack, and Harriet after three years will be approximately 58.33 years old."
"Response: 
Let N = number of points scored by Naomi
Since Naomi scored 68 points, we know that:
N = 68... (1)
We also know that Yuri scored 10 more than half of the points scored by Naomi:
Yuri's score = (1/2)N + 10... (2)
Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
Yuri's score = (1/2)(68) + 10
= 34 + 10
= 44... (3)
Now, we know that Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi:
Brianna's score = Naomi's score + 17
= 68 + 17
= 85... (4)
Finally, we can set up an equation for the total number of points scored by all four students:
Total points = Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score + Jojo's score
= 68 + 44 + 85 + x
where x is the number of points scored by Jojo.
Solving this system of equations, we get:
x = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
= 251 - 297
= -46
So, Jojo scored 46 points."

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time that Carmen spent solving puzzles during the weekend. We know that she took 10 minutes to finish one crossword and 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku. Let's assume that she solved three crosswords and eight Sudokus.

Time taken to solve each crossword = 10 minutes
Time taken to solve each Sudoku = 5 minutes

Total time taken to solve three crosswords = 3 x 10 = 30 minutes
Total time taken to solve eight Sudokus = 8 x 5 = 40 minutes

Therefore, the total time that Carmen dedicated to these games over the weekend is:

30 + 40 = 70 minutes"

To calculate the probability of a randomly selected card being a water-type card after losing 8 water cards and buying 14 grass cards, we need to first determine the number of water cards left in James's deck after he loses 8 cards.

Let X be the number of water cards left in James's deck before he buys any new cards.

X = 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let Y be the number of grass cards that James buys.

Y = 14

So, the total number of cards in James's updated deck is:

Z = X + Y = 32 + 14 = 46

The proportion of water cards in James's updated deck is:

Proportion of water cards = (number of water cards / total number of cards) x 100%
= (32 / 46) x 100%
= 70%

Therefore, the probability of a randomly selected card from James's updated deck being a water-type card is approximately 70%."

To calculate the total amount paid by Mark for his fleet of vehicles, we need to add the purchase price of each vehicle, the taxes he pays on them, and any additional registration fees. Let's break down the costs as follows:

Purchase Price per Vehicle = $20,000 x 12 = $240,000 (for the entire fleet)
Taxes (10% of $240,000) = $24,000
Registration Fees (($20,000 x 12) + $1000) = ($240,000 + $12,000) + $1000 = $253,000
Total Amount Paid = $240,000 + $24,000 + $253,000 = $527,000

Therefore, the total amount paid by Mark for his fleet of 12 vehicles is $527,000."

"Response: 20 rams are needed to produce enough tomatoes for Steve's consumption.

Explanation:
To determine how many rams Steve needs, we need to calculate how many tomatoes he consumes in a week and then divide that number by the number of tomatoes each branch can produce per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 42 tomatoes (6 x 7) per week. Since each branch produces 3 tomatoes per week, Steve would need 14 branches (42 / 3 = 14). However, since Steve wants to have some extra tomatoes for his future consumption, let's round up this number to 20 branches. Therefore, Steve needs 20 rams to produce enough tomatoes for his consumption."
"Response: 3 pizzas.
Explanation: To determine how many pizzas John should order, we need to divide the number of friends he has by the number of portions each friend can eat (in this case, 4). We then round up to the nearest whole number since we cannot have a fraction of a pizza. So, 20 friends / 4 portions per friend = 5, rounded up to 6, so John needs to order 6 pizzas. However, since pizzas are only sold in 8-portion servings, John will actually need to order 3 pizzas (6 x 8 = 48 portions)."

"Response: 240 students (or 24% of the total number of students) exited through door C.  

To solve this problem, we need to use a systematic approach that takes into account all the given information and leads us to the solution. Here's how we can do it step by step:

Step 1: Identify the known quantities. We know that there were 1000 students in the vestibule, and that 30% of them left through entrance A, which is equal to 300 students (30% x 1000). Also, 3/5 of the remaining students left through entrance B, which is equal to 600 students (3/5 x 700). Finally, the rest of the students, or 100 students (700 - 600), left through entrance C.

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of students who left through each entrance. To do this, we divide the number of students who left through each entrance by the total number of students:

Entrance A: 300 / 1000 = 30%
Entrance B: 600 / 1000 = 60%
Entrance C: 100 / 1000 = 10%

Step 3: Add up the percentages to find out the total percentage of students who left the building. Since all three entrances are used as both entrances and exits, we add up the percentages to get 100%. In this case, the total percentage of students who left the building is:

30 + 60 + 10 = 100%

Step 4: Use the total percentage to calculate the number of students who left through each entrance. Now that we have the total percentage of students who left the building, we can use it to calculate the number of students who left through each entrance. For example, if 100% of the students left the building, then:

Entrance A: 30% x 100% = 30 students
Entrance B: 60% x 100% = 60 students
Entrance C"

"Response: 
To find out how many hours Mike spends writing per week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then divide that by his writing speed. Let's start by calculating the total number of pages he writes:

Total number of pages = Number of letters x Number of pages per letter
= 5 people x 2 letters per person x 5 pages per letter
= 50 pages per week

Now, let's calculate Mike's writing speed in words per minute (wpm):

Writing speed (wpm) = Pages per hour / Time spent writing per hour
= 50 pages / 6 minutes per page
= 83.33 wpm

Finally, we can calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week:

Time spent writing per week = Total number of pages / Writing speed
= 50 pages / 83.33 wpm
= 0.607 hours or approximately 36 minutes per week

Therefore, Mike spends around 36 minutes per week writing letters to his remaining three friends."

Explanation: Let's break down what we know about the situation:

1. Griffin had 24 potatoes at first.
2. Kyle took 5 potatoes from Griffin.
3. Billy took double the number of potatoes that Kyle took (i.e., 2 x 5 = 10).
4. Ginger gave some of her potatoes to Griffin.
5. Colby took 3 fewer potatoes from Griffin than Kyle took.

We can start by adding up all the potatoes that were taken away from Griffin:

5 + 10 + 3 = 18

So, in total, 18 potatoes were taken away from Griffin. Now, let's add up all the potatoes that Ginger gave to Griffin:

24 + 8 = 32

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 8 potatoes."
"Response: 
Let's say there are x fish in each aquarium. Since the difference between the number of snails in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 4 = 2(x + 32)

Simplifying the equation:

x + 4 = 2x + 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

x + 4 - 2x = 64

Solving for x:

x = 16

Therefore, there are 16 fish in each aquarium."
"Response: 
To calculate how much Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to first determine the total amount that Jean owes the makeup artist based on the number of hours worked and the hourly rate.

Total hours worked = 4 times per week x 6 hours per day x 5 weeks = 800 hours

Total amount owed = Total hours worked x Hourly rate
= 800 hours x $250/hour
= $200,000

Since the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount after completing the film, we can calculate the final amount that Jean pays as follows:

Final amount = Total amount owed x Discount percentage
= $200,000 x 10%
= $20,000

Therefore, Jean paid $20,000 for the makeup services."
