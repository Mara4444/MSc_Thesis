Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2x = 2 \* 4 = 8 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4x = 4 \* 20 = 80 sheep.

Explanation:
Carla starts downloading the 200 GB file at her usual rate of 2 GB/minute, so she covers 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.
Then, Windows forces a restart to install updates and takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla needs to start the download again from the beginning, so she spends another 100 minutes on the remaining 180 GB of the file. Therefore, the total time taken for Carla to download the file is 100 + 100 = 200 minutes or 3 hours and 20 minutes."
"Response: 175 miles

My reasoning:

* First 3 hours: John drove for 3 hours at a constant speed of 60 mph, so he traveled 3 x 60 = 180 miles.
* Standstill traffic for 2 hours: During this time, John did not move, so he did not travel any distance.
* Next half-hour: John drove at a speed of 30 mph for 30 minutes, which means he traveled 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles.
* Remaining time: After the standstill traffic, John had 4 - 2 = 2 hours left to drive. At a speed of 80 mph, he traveled 80 x 2 = 160 miles during these 2 hours.

Therefore, John was 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles away from home when he finished his journey after 4 hours."

Rozhovor:  Sure, I'd be happy to help! To calculate how many dozen eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she makes each day by the number of days in 4 weeks. So, if Claire makes 3 egg omelets per day, and there are 7 days in a week, then she will make 21 egg omelets per week (3 x 7 = 21). Now, if there are 4 weeks in a month, and Claire eats 21 egg omelets per week, then she will eat 84 egg omelets in 4 weeks (21 x 4 = 84). Finally, since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Claire will eat 696 eggs in 4 weeks (84 x 12 = 696). Therefore, the answer is 12 dozens of eggs."

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other must cost $66 ($33 x 2). Therefore, the boots cost $42 ($66 - $24)."

Explain your reasoning:
Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, which is 1200 - 400 = 800 feet. Since the dragon's flames are within a distance of 1000 feet, we need to subtract the distance from where Polly stands to the dragon (1000 - 800 = 200 feet). Therefore, if Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can stand 200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin."

You: Wow, that's a lot of Post-it notes! Okay, let's see... if you started with 80 Post-it notes and used one for every 220 cups of coffee, that means you used up 96 Post-it notes (220 x 1 = 220). So, that leaves you with 80 - 96 = 4 post-it notes left over. Did I get that right?

Maximum load = Weight of the truck + Weight of the driver - Bridge capacity

In this case, the weight of the truck is 3755 pounds (driver + empty truck), and the weight of a single box is 15 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of all the boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:

Maximum load = 3755 + 3755 - 5000 = 240 x 15 = 3600 pounds

So the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 3600 / 15 = 240 boxes."

Rozhovor:  Okay! Let's see... If the canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, then the original volume of the tomatoes in each can must be twice the volume of the final product (the tomato sauce). So, if the final product is 32 ounces, the original volume of the tomatoes in each can must be 64 ounces (32 ÷ 0.5 = 64). Since there are 3 tomatoes in each 16-ounce can, and we want to find out how many tomatoes Freda used in total, we divide the number of ounces by the number of tomatoes per can: 64 ÷ 3 = 21 tomatoes. But since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we need to subtract 3 from the total number of tomatoes: 21 - 3 = 18 tomatoes. Therefore, Freda used 18 tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce."

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, so the total number of doorbell rings was 20.
The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, which means they pressed it 20 x 1.25 = 25 times.
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means they pressed it 60 / 10 = 6 times.
So, in total, there were 20 + 25 + 6 = 384 doorbell rings that day. Great job!"

"Response: 2 x 130 = 260

Explanation:
Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he baked 2 x 130 = 260 cookies this year. However, when he finished baking, he realized that he had accidentally baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the total number of cookies he has is 260 + 15 = 275. Then, he dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, leaving him with a final total of 275 - 5 = 270 cookies. Therefore, Henry baked 260 cookies last year."

Rozhovor:  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! To find out how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that the boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet it rowed back towards shore, and it took Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. So, if Julia rowed for 64 seconds (which is how long it took her to reach shore), then she rowed 64/16 = 4 times as far as she did in the initial 20 feet. Therefore, the boat took on 2 x 4 = 8 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore."

Rozhovor:  Sure! To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, the customs officer at the main port of SeaSide cleared 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.
2. On the second day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can conclude that there are 30 / 5 = 6 containers of vehicles imported on the second day.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 4 containers of vehicles imported on the second day."

Rozhovor:  Okay! To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to divide the number of sheets he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so...
Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, which means he uses 8 sheets of paper per week (2 x 4 = 8).
Now, let's convert this to months: 8 sheets/week x 4 weeks/month = 32 sheets/month.
So, Miguel uses 32 sheets of paper every month."

He also picked up another Lego set that has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so he picked up an additional 1500 blocks (3 x 500 = 1500).
Finally, he picked up another Lego set that has 1/4 the number of pieces as the second set, which means he picked up 375 blocks (1/4 x 1500 = 375).
In total, Johnny picked up 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2768 blocks or Legos."

My reasoning:
Bill bakes 300 rolls, so there are 300 x 4 = 1200 inches of rolls.
Therefore, if we put all the rolls end to end, they would be 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet long.
Similarly, for chocolate croissants, Bill bakes 120, so there are 120 x 6 = 720 inches of croissants. Putting them end to end, they would be 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet long.
For baguettes, Bill bakes 60, so there are 60 x 2 = 120 inches of baguettes. Putting them end to end, they would be 120 inches / 2 = 60 feet long.
Adding up the length of all the baked goods, we get: 100 + 60 + 60 = 220 feet."

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means he caught 5 - 10 = 5 starfish. He also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 6 = 0 sea horses. And since Anakin caught 3 more clownfish than Locsin, Locsin caught 3 - 3 = 0 clownfish. So in total, Locsin caught 5 + 0 + 0 = 5 fish. Therefore, the answer is 19 + 5 = 48 fish."

Rozhovor s Jackie:
Jackie: Hey there! I'm really struggling with deciding whether to do my taxes myself or hire an accountant. Do you think it would be better for me to do them myself or pay someone else to do them?
Tutor: Well, let's see...if you do your taxes yourself, you won't have to spend time on that and can use that time for other things. But keep in mind that doing your own taxes might mean missing out on some deductions that an accountant could find for you. On the other hand, hiring an accountant means you'll have to pay them for their services. Can you tell me a bit more about how much time you're willing to dedicate to doing your taxes and how much you'd be willing to pay an accountant?
Jackie: Yeah, sure. I figure if I do them myself, I can save around 3 hours of freelance work time, which is worth around $35/hour in missed income. So that's like $105 total. But then again, I know accountants are good at finding deductions and stuff, so maybe it's worth paying someone else to do them. I don't want to mess anything up and end up owing money to the government.
Tutor: Okay, got it. So if you do your taxes yourself, you'll save $105 in missed income, but you also risk missing out on deductions that an accountant could find. And if you hire an accountant, you'll have to pay them $90. Let's do some math to see which option is better for you. If you hire an accountant, you'll save $105 - $90 = $15 in missed income by not having to do the taxes yourself. So, hiring an accountant would actually cost you less than doing them yourself!"

My reasoning:
The cost of the hat is $25, so the cost of the jacket must be $75 ($3 x $25). Therefore, the average cost of the hat and jacket is $50 ($25 + $75)/2 = $50.
So, the cost of the pants is half the average cost of the hat and jacket, which is $25 ($50 / 2) = $50.
Therefore, each uniform costs $50 for the hat, $75 for the jacket, and $50 for the pants, for a total cost of $100 per uniform."

Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. So, the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade is: $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon. Since they sold 20 glasses per gallon and made a profit of $25, we can calculate their profit per gallon as follows: Profit per gallon = Total revenue - Total cost = $0.50 x 20 glasses/gallon - $5/gallon = $10/gallon Now, since they made a profit of $25, we know that their total revenue was at least $25 / ($0.50 per glass) = 50 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses they sold is: Number of glasses = Total revenue / Price per glass = 50 glasses / $0.50 per glass = 100 glasses So, Juan and Carlos spent $3 x 100 glasses = $300 on lemons.

Rozhovor s učitelem:  Učitel: Jak se dá vysvětlit, že celkový počet straw distribuovaných mezi malé savci je stejný, jako je počet kusů straw distribuovaných každému zástupci jednotlivých druhů?Russell: Oh, I see! It's because there are an equal number of animals in each group, so the total amount of straw distributed is divided equally among them. So, if there are 3 groups of rats with 10 rats in each group, then there are 30 rats in total (10 x 3 = 30). And since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total amount of straw distributed to the rats is 30 x 6 = 180 pieces. Similarly, there are 10 groups of hamsters with 10 hamsters in each group, so there are 100 hamsters in total (10 x 10 = 100). Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so the total amount of straw distributed to the hamsters is 100 x 5 = 500 pieces. And finally, there are 20 groups of rabbits with 5 rabbits in each group, so there are 100 rabbits in total (20 x 5 = 100). Each rabbit gets 20 pieces of straw, so the total amount of straw distributed to the rabbits is 100 x 20 = 2000 pieces. Therefore, the total amount of straw distributed among all the small rodents is 180 + 500 + 2000 = 2780 pieces."

Then, on Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection, so now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos in total.
Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

Response:  Mark makes $50 in a week (in cents). Explanation: To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each publisher and then add it up. Since Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, he earns $50 = 5 x 1000 (since there are 1000 sentences edited by Mark each week) from Publisher A. Since Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, Mark earns $100 = 2 x $50 (from Publisher B) in addition to the $50 he earns from Publisher A, making his total weekly income $150.

And if he ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week, he used 1 + 3 = 4 slices of cheese per omelet, so he used 4 x 3 = 12 slices of cheese for his omelets. Finally, if he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week, he used 8 slices of cheese in it. So, in total, Carl used 14 + 12 + 8 = 34 slices of cheese during the week."

Rozhovor:  Okay, let's see...Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so that's a total of 32 pens. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens, which contain 9 pens each, so that's an additional 54 pens. And she bought 2 bags of red pens, which contain 6 pens each, so that's an additional 12 pens. So, the total number of pens Janet has now is 32 + 54 + 12 = 108 pens."

"Response: 180 km
Micheal rode his bike for 4 weeks, each time making 25 kilometers. So, in total, he made 4 x 25 = 100 kilometers during those 4 weeks. Then, he reduced the number of times he rode his bike to twice a week, but increased the distance he rode each time by 40%. Therefore, he rode his bike for 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers during the next 3 weeks. In total, therefore, Micheal rode his bike for 100 + 120 = 220 kilometers."

Rozhovor:  Sure! Let's do the calculation. So, if there are 25 chocolate bars, each one weighs 40g x 2 = 80g. And if there are 80 candied apples, each one weighs 40g. Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is: 25 x 80g + 80 x 40g = 1700g."

Rozhovor:  Sure! Let's see... if Jerry collects 42 eggs every day and there are more white chickens than red chickens, that means the white chickens produce more eggs than the red chickens. So, if the total number of eggs produced by both types of chickens is 3 + 5 = 8 eggs per day, then the number of red chickens must be half of the total number of chickens, which is 10 chickens in this case."

Gary: Hey there! I like to take long walks in the park. It's so peaceful and relaxing. How far do you think I walk each time?
You: Well, the park is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. So if you walk around the edge, you would cover a distance of 1.5 x 6 = 9 miles. If you walk at 3 miles per hour, it would take you approximately 4 hours to complete one circuit around the park.
Gary: Wow, that's great! Thanks for calculating that for me. I guess I'll have to budget some more time for my walks next week."

Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day and 50 more customers on the second day, so the total number of customers on the second day was 150 (100 + 50). On the third day, there were 50 more customers than on the second day, so the total number of customers on the third day was 200 (150 + 50). Therefore, Sloane counted 300 customers on the third day."
"Response: 20 gallons
Rozhovor:  Sure! Let's break this down step by step.
Jerry has two pools, and we know that both pools are losing water through leaks at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. So after 4 minutes, the big pool will have lost 16 gallons (2 x 8 gallons = 16 gallons) and the small pool will have lost 8 gallons (8 gallons).
Now, we're told that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So if the big pool had 16 gallons of water before, it now has 64 gallons (16 x 4 = 64 gallons). And if the small pool had 8 gallons of water before, it now has 32 gallons (8 x 4 = 32 gallons).
So the small pool now has 32 gallons of water."

Explanation:
Janeth borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount. So, her total payment will be $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2200. Since she is going to pay $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance after 12 months will be $2200 - ($165 x 12) = $1378.49."

Rozhovor:  Sure, I'd be happy to help! To find out how many flowers are in the vase in total, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more dahlias than roses. So, if there are x dahlias in the vase, then there are 7x - 4 = 3x flowers in total. Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total (4 + 3x)."

Rozhovor:  Sure, I can help you with that! To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle. For the crossword puzzles, it took her 10 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 30 minutes solving those (3 x 10 = 30). For the sudoku puzzles, it took her 5 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 40 minutes solving those (8 x 5 = 40). Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend."

So if there were 120 baby watermelons and 30% were ready for harvest after two months, then there are 36 melons left (120 x 30%). Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which is 24 melons (36 x 3/4). That means there are 12 melons left unharvested after two weeks (36 - 24 = 12)."

Mark: Hi there! I'm interested in buying a fleet of cars for my company. Can you tell me how much it will cost me?
Salesperson: Of course! Let me see... You're looking at 12 cars, right? And they sell for $20,000 each.
Mark: That's right. But what about taxes and registration fees?
Salesperson: Oh, definitely! For taxes, we have to charge 10% of the total price of the cars. So that'll be an additional $2,400. And for registration, it's $1,000 per car. So that's another $12,000.
Mark: Okay, so let me do the math... *pulls out calculator* Hmm, that comes out to $348,000.00! Wow, that's quite a bit more than I expected.
Salesperson: Yes, unfortunately taxes and registration fees can really add up. But don't worry, it's worth it in the long run! Your company will be able to use those cars for years to come."

Rozhovor:  Steve wants to grow his own cherry tomatoes so that he can eat them fresh every day. He currently eats 6 tomatoes per day, but he wants to double his intake. To do this, he needs to grow enough tomato plants to provide him with the additional 6 tomatoes per day. Since each plant can produce up to 3 tomatoes per week, Steve will need 4 plants to meet his daily demand of 12 tomatoes (6 x 2 = 12). Therefore, he will need 4 tomato plants to grow all the tomatoes he needs for himself."

Rozhovor:  Sure! To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there were 1000 students in the school hall.
2. After the meeting, 30% of the students (300) went out through exit A.
3. Of the remaining 700 students, 3/5 (420) went out through exit B.
4. So, the total number of students who went out through exits A and B is 300 + 420 = 720.
5. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 720 - 420 = 300.

So, the answer is 300 students went out through exit C."

Mike has been a penpal with 5 people, but he stopped being penpals with 2 of them. Each person sends 2 letters per week, which are 5 pages long, and Mike responds to each letter in kind. Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to calculate how much time he spends writing each week.
Let's assume it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page (which is a reasonable estimate). To find out how many hours Mike spends writing each week, we can multiply the number of pages he writes by the time it takes him to write one page:

Number of pages written per week = Number of penpals x Number of letters per week x Page length per letter
= 5 x 2 x 5
= 50 pages
Time spent writing per week = Number of pages written per week / Time it takes to write one page
= 50 pages / 6 minutes/page
= 8.33 hours/week
Therefore, Mike spends approximately 8.33 hours per week writing letters to his remaining 3 penpals."

Rozhovor:  Excuse me, sir! I think you've got some fries mixed up there. Let me see if I can help you straighten things out. So, Griffin had 24 fries to start with, right? And Kyle took 5 of them, leaving him with 19. Then Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which means he took 10 more fries, making it 29 total. Next, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, let's say 6. That brings us to 35 fries. Finally, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took, which is 2. So, in the end, Griffin had 35 - 2 = 33 fries. Now, about those fries Ginger gave him... she gave him 18 fries, not 17. See? All sorted out now!"

Rozhovor:  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.
So, we know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. We also know that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.
Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium ""x"". Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can write an equation based on this information:
Number of snails in second aquarium = 2x
Now, let's substitute the value of x from the problem statement into this equation:
Number of snails in second aquarium = 2(4) = 8
Therefore, there are 8 fish in the first aquarium and 8 + 32 = 40 fish in the second aquarium."

Jeans pays $37,800.00 USD for the makeup services over the course of the 5-week movie shoot. This calculation is based on the following assumptions:

* The makeup artist charges $250 per hour
* It takes 6 hours per day to complete the makeup (4 days x 6 hours = 24 hours per week)
* The makeup artist works 4 days per week (Monday through Thursday)
* The total number of hours worked by the makeup artist is 24 hours/week x 5 weeks = 120 hours
* The makeup artist provides a 10% discount at the end of the project, which reduces the total cost by $120 (10% of $1200)

Therefore, the final cost of the makeup services is $37,800.00 USD ($1200 x 30 hours)."
