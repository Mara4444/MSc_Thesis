Explanation: According to the given information, Tuolumne has twice as many sheep as Charleston and four times as many as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Tuolumne has 2 × 2 = 4 times as many sheep, or 80 sheep. Charleston has half as many sheep as Tuolumne, so it has 80 / 2 = 40 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Tuolumne, Charleston, and Seattle is 80 + 40 + 20 = 150 sheep."

"Response: 56 km
Explanation:
First, let's calculate how much time John spent driving at high speed (30 miles per hour):
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 80 mi / 30 mph = 2.67 hours
Now, we need to subtract this time from the total time of 4 hours:
Total time = 4 hours - 2.67 hours = 1.33 hours
So, in the remaining time of 1.33 hours, John traveled 80 miles:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 80 mi / 30 mph = 2.67 miles
Therefore, the distance from John's location to his home is:
Distance = Total distance + Remaining distance
Distance = 56 km (since 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers)
Hence, the answer is 56 km away from his home."
"Response: 63 dollars.
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Eliza is paid $10 per hour for her first 40 hours of work each week. For any additional hours worked beyond 40 hours, she receives pay that is 1.2 times the standard hourly rate. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, her total earnings would be calculated as follows:

Standard hourly rate = $10/hour (for the first 40 hours)
Additional hourly rate = $10 x 1.2 = $12/hour (for the remaining 5 hours)
Total earnings = 40 hours x $10 + 5 hours x $12 = $63
Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $63."

Explanation:
Carlos will start making money from his lemon tree after 62 years, assuming he spends $90 to plant it and pays $3 annually for maintenance.

Year 1: Carlos plants the lemon tree and spends $90 on it. He does not earn any money yet as there are no lemons produced in this year. Total cost = $90.

Year 2-62: Carlos does not earn any money from the lemon tree as there are no lemons produced during these years. Total cost = $3 x 62 = $186.

Year 63: The first lemon is produced, and Carlos can sell it for $1.50. Total income = $1.50.

Year 64-70: Carlos continues to produce lemons every year, but he still does not make enough money to cover the initial investment of $90. Total cost = $3 x 5 = $15.

Year 71: Carlos finally breaks even, meaning that he has earned enough money to cover the initial investment of $90. Total income = $1.50 x 7 = $10.50.

Years 72-75: Carlos continues to produce lemons and earns an average of $10.50 per year.

Year 76: Carlos stops producing lemons, and the tree dies. Total cost = $90 (initial investment) + $186 (maintenance costs over 62 years) = $276.

Therefore, Carlos will start making money from his lemon tree after 62 years, when he produces his first lemon in Year 63."

Explanation: To calculate the profit, we need to use the formula: Profit = (Purchase Price x Expected Increase in Market Value) - Cost of Goods Sold. For the first option, the purchase price is $5,000 and the expected increase in market value is 2.5%. So, the profit would be: Profit = ($5,000 x 2.5%) - $0 = $125. For the second option, the purchase price is $8,000 and the expected increase in market value is 1.2%. So, the profit would be: Profit = ($8,000 x 1.2%) - $0 = $96. Therefore, the total profit for both options is: Total Profit = $125 + $96 = $221."

Response: 79 points. Explanation: In the first 20 minutes of playing ping pong, Mike scored 4 points, which is 1/5 of the total score he achieved in that time frame. Therefore, his rate of scoring per minute during this period was (4/20) = 0.2 points per minute. During the next 20 minutes, Mike's rate of scoring increased by 25%, which means he scored an additional 0.25 x 0.2 = 0.05 points per minute. So, his total score for the entire 40 minutes can be calculated as follows: Total score = Rate of scoring x Time taken = (0.2 + 0.05) x 40 = 78 points. Since we are looking for the total score, not just the score after 40 minutes, we add the extra 0.05 points to get the final answer of 79 points.

"Response: 48 miles
Explanation:
Dana can run at a speed of four times faster than she can walk, so her running speed is 4x = 16 mph (miles per hour). Since she can jump at a speed of half the running speed, her jumping speed is 2x = 8 mph.
To find out how many miles Dana can cover in one hour, we need to multiply her walking speed by the number of hours she spends walking:
walking distance = walking speed x time spent walking = 3 mi/h x 6 h = 18 miles
Now, let's calculate how much distance Dana covers during the six-hour period:
total distance = running + jumping distance = 16 mph x 6 h + 8 mph x 6 h = 96 miles + 48 miles = 144 miles
Therefore, Dana covers a total distance of 144 miles in six hours."

"Response: 800 meters
Explanation: According to the passage, when Polly held the sapphire dragon stone, she could throw her copper arrow three times farther than when she did not hold it. This means that if Polly held the dragon stone and threw her copper arrow at a distance of x meters from the zmaj (the fire-breathing dragon), then the maximum distance from which the zmaj's flames could reach Polly would be 3x meters. Since the passage states that the zmaj's flames could reach Polly at a distance of 400 meters, we can set up the equation: 3x = 400. Solving for x, we get x = 800 meters. Therefore, the maximum distance from which Polly could stand and catch the zmaj with her golden arrow is 800 meters."

"Response: 
Charlie wants to sell candles made of beeswax. For each kilogram of beeswax, he can make 10 incense sticks. One kilogram of beeswax costs $10, and each stick costs $2. If Charlie sells each stick for $2, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 sticks?

Step-by-step solution:

1. Calculate the cost price of one kilogram of beeswax:
Cost price = $10/kg
2. Calculate the number of sticks that Charlie can make from one kilogram of beeswax:
Number of sticks = 1 kg / 0.1 kg (weight of each stick) = 10 sticks
3. Calculate the total cost of making 20 sticks:
Total cost = Number of sticks x Cost price per stick = 20 x $10 = $200
4. Calculate the revenue from selling 20 sticks at $2 each:
Revenue = Number of sticks x Selling price per stick = 20 x $2 = $40
5. Calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Revenue - Total cost = $40 - $200 = -$160
Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 sticks is -$160."

"Response: 42
Explanation:
The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 42. To calculate this, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck (3,755 pounds) from the total weight limit of the bridge (5,000 pounds):

Maximum number of boxes = Total weight limit - Combined weight of driver + Empty truck = 5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245
Since each box has a weight of 15 kilograms, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:

Maximum number of boxes = Total weight limit / Weight of each box = 1,245 / 15 kg = 83
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck and still cross the bridge safely is 42."

"Response: 80 miles (130 km)
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Sofia has already traveled 160 kilometers since her last refueling, and she needs to add 4 gallons of gasoline to continue driving. Since each gallon of gasoline contains 3.785 liters, we can calculate the total amount of fuel that Sofia has left as follows:

Total fuel remaining = Number of gallons added + Last filled quantity - Distance traveled
= 4 gallons + 12 gallons x 0.75 (since she used 0.75 of the full tank) - 160 kilometers
= 4 + 9 + (-160)
= 126 gallons

Since one liter of gasoline contains approximately 0.75 miles per gallon, we can convert the total distance traveled by dividing it by this value:

Distance traveled = Total fuel remaining / Miles per gallon
= 126 gallons / 0.75 miles/gallon
= 168 miles (270 km)

Therefore, based on the information given in the question, Sofia can travel approximately 168 miles (270 km) on a single reservoir of gasoline."

"Response: 
The average surface area of each level of the pyramid is given by $ \frac{1}{2} \times h^2 $ where $h$ is the height of the level. Since there are $4$ levels in total, the total surface area of the pyramid is $\sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{1}{2} \times h_i^2$.
Given that the highest level has a square footprint of $16$ square meters, we have $h_1 = 4$. Moreover, since each level has half the area of the previous one, we can write $h_i = 2^{i-1}$ for $i > 1$. Therefore,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Total surface area of pyramid} &= \sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{1}{2} \times (2^{i-1})^2 \\
&= 4 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 4^2 + 8 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 + 16 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \\
&= 32 + 16 + 4 = 52 \square meters

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Jin has been on four vacations per year for eight years (from his 23rd to his 34th year). Therefore, he has had a total of 32 vacations (4 x 8 = 32).
Since each vacation consists of multiple blocks, and each block represents one year of Jin's life, the number of blocks is equal to the number of vacations multiplied by the number of years in each vacation. So, the total number of blocks is:
32 vacations x 8 years/vacation = 256 blocks
However, since some of these blocks may overlap, we need to subtract the number of overlapping blocks from the total number of blocks. According to the problem statement, there are no overlapping blocks, so the final answer is:
256 - 0 = 256 blocks
Therefore, Jin has had a total of 256 blocks throughout his life."

The second time it sounded, it sounded for three times longer than the first time, so it sounded for 12 times (4 x 3 = 12). Finally, the third time it sounded, it sounded for half as long as the second time, so it sounded for 6 times (12 / 2 = 6). Therefore, the total number of times the alarm sounded is 5 (4 + 12 + 6 = 5)."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Silvi's current salary is $600 per month, and she has been working for the company for five years. If we assume that her initial salary was also $600 per month, then her annual salary after three more years of service would be:

$600/month x 12 months = $7,200/year (initial salary)
$7,200/year x 10% increase each year = $7,940/year (after 3 years)
Therefore, Silvi's annual salary after three more years of service is $7,940."

"Response: 30 kg (66 lbs) of carrot salad.
Explanation: To determine how much carrot salad Teed should bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of carrot salad needed for all the adults and children at the picnic. The question states that an adult dinosaur can eat 10 pounds of carrot salad, while a child can eat half as much (5 pounds). Therefore, if there are 20 adults and 5 children attending the picnic, the total amount of carrot salad needed is:

20 x 10 = 200 pounds (90 kilograms) + 5 x 5 = 25 pounds (11 kilograms) = 225 pounds (102 kilograms) of carrot salad.
Since Teed wants to make sure they have enough food for everyone, he decides to bring 30 kilograms (66 pounds) of carrot salad to the picnic, which is more than enough to feed everyone."

Explanation:
Let's assume that before changing his diet, Џералд could run 400 meters with obstacles in 40 seconds. Since Li used to be able to run 400 meters with obstacles 2 seconds faster than Џералд, we can say that Li ran 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds.
Now, if Џералд improves his running speed by 10% after changing his diet, he will be able to run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 34.6 seconds (since 10% of 40 seconds is 4 seconds).
Therefore, Џералд can run 400 meters with obstacles in around 34.6 seconds."

Explanation: Let's analyze each friend's contribution to the total number of times the doorbell rang:
Friend 1 pressed the button 20 times.
Friend 2 pressed it 1/4 more than Friend 1, so they pressed it 20 x 1.25 = 25 times.
Friend 3 pressed it 10 times more than Friend 2, so they pressed it 25 x 1.5 = 37.5 times.
Friend 4 pressed it 60 times.
Therefore, the total number of times the doorbell rang is 20 + 25 + 37.5 + 60 = 192.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a bell ring, round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 193. So, the answer is 193."

Therefore, if Julija traveled a distance of twenty feet, she would have taken in forty liters of water (twenty liters per ten meters x twenty feet). However, since the passage states that the canoe took in two liters of water every ten meters, we know that Julija actually took in eighty liters of water (forty liters from the previous calculation + four liters for each of the next ten meters she traveled). So, the correct answer is twenty liters."

* The maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times greater than the number of birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo. If there are X birds in Jamal's photo, then Brittany's phone can hold at most 50X photos.
* Jamal's phone can take 1800 photos. To find out how many birds are in his photo, we need to divide the total number of photos by the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold: 1800 / 50X = 36.
Therefore, there are 36 birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo."

Then, she runs at a speed of 8 kilometers per hour for 1 hour, covering a distance of 8 km/h x 1 h = 8 km. To find out how far Rosi can cover in 7 hours, we need to add the distances she covered during the first 3 hours and the last hour: 30 + 8 = 38 miles. Therefore, Rosi can cover 38 miles in 7 hours."
"Response: 45 letters.
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Џени помаже у канцеларији своje мајке. (She helps her mother at the office.)
* Има куп 60 писма које треба да печате. (There are 60 letters that need to be stamped.)
* Куп већ печатаних писма. (A batch of already stamped letters.)
* Онаставља ставити печат на трећину писма којима је потребно печат. (She continues to put a stamp on a third of the letters that require a stamp.)
* Ако сада има 30 писма у гомили већштампаних писма, колико их је било у тој гомили кад Џени почела? (If there are now 30 already stamped letters in the pile, how many were there when Jen started?)

From the above information, we can deduce the following steps:

1. Initially, there were 60 letters that needed to be stamped (step 1).
2. Џени began by putting a stamp on a third of these letters (step 2).
3. After she had put a stamp on a third of the letters, there were 20 letters left (step 3).
4. Now, there are 30 already stamped letters in the pile (step 4).

So, the number of letters that Џени helped her mother stamp is:

60 - 20 = 40 letters

Since Џени continued to put stamps on a third of the remaining letters, the total number of letters she helped her mother stamp is:

40 x 3/3 = 45 letters

Therefore, the answer to the question is 45 letters."

The price of each portokalo is 5 times that of a biber, so the total cost of 10 portokales will be 10 x 5 x 15 = 750 RSD.
Therefore, the total cost of all three items will be 60 + 900 + 750 = 368 RSD."
Response: 3750 dollars per day. Explanation: The number of patients seen in one day is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. If each patient visit takes 24 minutes and there are 12,000 minutes in a day, then the total number of visits in a day is 12,000 / 24 = 500 visits. Since each visit generates $150 for the hospital, the daily revenue from visits is 500 x $150 = $75,000. Therefore, the amount that the hospital earns from these visits is $75,000 + $200 (per patient) x 500 = $3750 per day.

Explanation:
Lucas has three clients already and is expecting to get five more. Each client will need two bottles of bleach and one package of cleaning cloths. The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of each package of cleaning cloths is $5. Therefore, Lucas' total weekly expenses will be:

3 clients x 2 bottles of bleach per client = 6 bottles of bleach @ $2/bottle = $12
3 clients x 1 package of cleaning cloths per client = 3 packages of cleaning cloths @ $5/package = $15
Total weekly expenses = $12 + $15 = $27

Since Lucas expects to make $92 in revenue from his clients, he will have a profit of:
Profit = Revenue - Expenses = $92 - $27 = $65
Therefore, Luca will make a profit of $65 every week."

"Response: 45 minutes
Explanation: To calculate the time taken by Bill to eat all the baked goods, we need to find the total length of all the rolls, chocolate croissants, and bagels. Let's assume that each roll is 16 cm long, each chocolate croissant is 18 cm long, and each bagel is 60 cm long.
Rolls = 300 x 16 = 4800 cm
Chocolate Croissants = 120 x 18 = 2160 cm
Bagels = 60 x 60 = 3600 cm
Total length = Rolls + Chocolate Croissants + Bagels = 4800 + 2160 + 3600 = 9520 cm
Now, let's convert the total length from centimeters to meters:
1 meter = 100 cm
Therefore, Total length in meters = 9520 cm / 100 = 95.2 meters
Since Bill can eat one meter of each product per minute (as given in the question), it will take him 95.2 minutes (or 1.5 hours) to finish eating all the baked goods."

So, if she has $300 minimum payment for student loans, $200 minimum payment for credit card bill, and $500 minimum payment for mortgage, the total amount of her debt is: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000. If she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, her new monthly payment would be: $1000 x 1.5 = $1500 / 12 = $125 per month. Therefore, Jessica will pay $125 per month for one year."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 80 Japanese athletes among 240 Asian athletes in total. This means that the number of male athletes (including both Japanese and non-Japanese) was 160 (240 - 80). Since the number of female athletes is given as 60, we can conclude that the number of male athletes is equal to the number of female athletes plus the number of deaf athletes, which is 30 (according to the question). Therefore, the number of deaf females in the Chinese team is 30."
"Response: 5300$. 
Explanation:
Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Заид spends on rent and utilities. Since he spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, he spends $1500 per month ($6000 x 1/4). Additionally, he spends $750 per month on utilities ($6000 x 1/3). Therefore, the total amount spent on rent and utilities is $2250 per month ($1500 + $750).
Next, we need to calculate how much money Заид donates to charity. He donates half of the remaining amount after all expenses, which is $3000 ($6000 - $2250).
Now, let's calculate how much money Заид has left after all these transactions. He has $6000 initially, minus the amount spent on rent and utilities, which is $2250. Then, he donates $3000 to charity, leaving him with $3850 ($6000 - $2250 - $3000).
Finally, Заид gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife for their respective expenses. So, the total amount he has left after all these transactions is $5300 ($3850 + $200 + $700)."

"Response: 12 seconds
Explanation:
The first team has four members who can run 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds each, so their total time for one lap is 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 280 seconds or 4 minutes and 40 seconds.
The second team has four members whose times are as follows:
First member - 60 seconds
Second member - 55 seconds (which is the same as the first team's fastest member)
Third member - 50 seconds (3 seconds slower than the second team's fastest member)
Fourth member - 45 seconds (9 seconds slower than the third team's slowest member)
Therefore, the total time for one lap by the second team is:
First member - 60 seconds
Second member - 55 seconds
Third member - 50 seconds
Fourth member - 45 seconds = 270 seconds or 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
Since the faster team runs 400 meters in 280 seconds, while the slower team takes 270 seconds to complete the same distance, the difference between their times is 12 seconds. Therefore, the faster team will win by 12 seconds."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, each group of three pacves contains 4 pacves (since there are 3 groups). Therefore, the total number of pacves is 3 x 4 = 12. Since there are 10 hedgehogs and each hedgehog receives 5 pieces of bread, the total number of pieces of bread distributed among the hedgehogs is 10 x 5 = 50. Similarly, since there are 20 mice and each mouse receives 20/5 = 4 pieces of bread, the total number of pieces of bread distributed among the mice is 20 x 4 = 80. Finally, since there are no crumbs used anywhere in the store, the total number of crumbs available for distribution is 0. Hence, the answer is 12 + 50 + 80 - 0 = 48."

* The trader buys several bags of wheat from farmers at a price of $20 per bag.
* The cost of transporting each bag from the farm to the storage is $2.
* The trader makes an overall profit of $400 after selling all the bags for $30 per bag.

Now, let's calculate the number of bags sold by the trader:

Total revenue = Number of bags sold x Price per bag
= $400 / $30 per bag
= 13 bags

So, the trader sold 13 bags of wheat."

"Response: 50 kg (50,000 g) of sauerkraut will be used.
Explanation: To determine how much sauerkraut will be used, we need to divide the total amount of sauerkraut by the number of restaurants that will receive it. In this case, there are 40 restaurants, so we can divide the total weight of sauerkraut (200 kg) by 40 to get the average amount each restaurant will receive: 5 kg (or 5,000 g) per restaurant. Since each restaurant will receive 2 kg of sauerkraut, we subtract 2 from 5 to get the remaining amount: 3 kg (or 3,000 g) of sauerkraut will not be used."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Mark edits an equal number of sentences for two different publishers each week and receives different payments from them. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. Since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences per week, we can calculate his weekly earnings as follows:

Publisher A pays Mark $5 per sentence = $5 x 1000 sentences = $5,000 per week
Publisher B pays Mark $10 per sentence = $10 x 1000 sentences = $10,000 per week
Therefore, Mark's weekly earnings are $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000."

Explanation:
Michael has been riding his bike for at least 5 times per week and each time he rode 25 kilometers. So, in one week, he rode 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers. Since he did this for 4 weeks, he rode a total of 4 x 125 = 500 kilometers. Then, he reduced his frequency to twice a week and increased the distance he rode by 60 kilometers each time. So, in 3 weeks, he rode a total of 3 x 60 + 60 = 210 kilometers. Therefore, Michael has traveled a total distance of 500 + 210 = 710 kilometers or 233 miles."

Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, Sarah has $10 in savings before she starts babysitting and wants to buy a jacket for $30 and two pairs of shoes for $20 each. To afford these items, Sarah needs to save money by cutting grass. The number of times Sarah needs to cut grass is given by the equation:

Number of times = Total amount needed / Amount earned per time

In this case, the total amount needed is $50 (=$30 + $20 x 2), and the amount earned per time is $5 ($=4 doilars x 1.25). Therefore, we can solve for the number of times as follows:

Number of times = $50 / $5 = 10 times
So, Sarah needs to cut grass 10 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."

Explanation: According to the passage, Sloan counted 100 customers on the first day and 50 more customers on the second day, for a total of 150 customers. Therefore, she counted 300 customers on the third day (150 + 150 = 300)."
"Response: 20 gallons
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Џери has two pools with evaporation rates of 4 gal/min each.
* Before 4 minutes, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
* Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Using these clues, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

Water in small pool (S) = Water in large pool (L) x Initial ratio (R)
Where R is the initial ratio between the amount of water in the small and large pools.

From the problem statement, we know that R = 2, since the small pool initially had half as much water as the large pool.
Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:

S = L x 2

Now, we are asked to find the value of S. To do this, we can solve for S by dividing both sides of the equation by L:

S / L = 2

Since the volume of the small pool is given as 10 gal, we can convert the result from gallons per liter to liters by multiplying by 3.785 (the conversion factor between US gallons and liters):

S / L = 2 × 3.785 = 7.57 liters

Therefore, the small pool now contains approximately 7.6 liters of water. Since the large pool also contained 7.6 liters of water before the evaporation began, it still contains the same amount of water after the evaporation process. So, the answer is:

Small pool contains 7.6 liters of water."
"Response: 16 hours
Explanation: To calculate how many hours Lorraine needs to work before she can afford to buy the shoes and bracelet, we need to divide the total cost of the items by her hourly wage. The total cost of the items is $320 + $32 = $352. Her hourly wage is $8.00 per hour. Therefore, Lorraine needs to work for 16 hours ($352 / $8.00 per hour) to be able to afford the shoes and bracelet."
"Response: 3450 dollars
Explanation:
First, we need to calculate how much money Jeneta borrowed from Geneta. According to the problem, Jeneta borrowed $2000.
Next, we need to find out how much interest Jeneta will pay for the loan. Since Geneta promised to give an additional 10% of the amount borrowed as interest, we can calculate it as follows:
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
Where:
Principal = $2000 (amount borrowed)
Rate = 10% / 12 months (interest rate per year)
Time = 12 months (time taken to repay the loan in months)
So, the total interest paid by Jeneta is:
Interest = $2000 x 10% x 12 months = $240
Now, let's find out how much money Jeneta still owes Geneta after making these monthly payments:
Original Amount + Interest = Total Amount Still Owed
$2000 + $240 = $3450 (Total amount still owed by Jeneta)
Therefore, the answer to the question is $3450."

* The total number of points scored by all four students is 251.
* Naomi scored 68 points.
* Yuri scored 10 more points than half of Naomi's score.
* Brian scored 17 more points than Naomi.

Now, let's use these clues to calculate Yoji's score:

Yoji's score = Total points - (Naomi's score / 2) + (Brian's score - Naomi's score)
= 251 - (68 / 2) + (17 - 68)
= 251 - 34 + (-19)
= 34

Therefore, Yoji scored 34 points in the game."

Explanation: To calculate the probability of randomly selecting a water-type Pokémon card after James has lost 8 water-type cards and bought 14 grass-type cards, we need to use the formula for conditional probability:

P(Water | Bought Grass) = P(Grass | Bought Grass) \* P(Water) / P(Grass)

where:

* P(Water) is the probability of randomly selecting a water-type Pokémon card before losing any cards. This can be calculated as follows:

P(Water) = 30/90 = 0.33 or 33%

* P(Grass) is the probability of randomly selecting a grass-type Pokémon card after buying 14 grass-type cards. This can be calculated as follows:

P(Grass) = 20/60 = 0.33 or 33%

* P(Bought Grass) is the probability of buying a grass-type card. Since James has already bought 14 grass-type cards, this probability is equal to 1.

Using these values, we can plug them into the formula above to get:

P(Water | Bought Grass) = (0.33 x 0.33) / (0.33 + 0.33) = 0.57 or 57%

Therefore, the probability that James will randomly select a water-type Pokémon card after he has lost 8 water-type cards and bought 14 grass-type cards is approximately 57%."

"Response: 4 hours
Explanation:
Let's assume that Mike sends one letter per week (not per day). Since he has been writing letters with 5 people and now only writes with 2, it means he spends half the time writing letters as before. So, if he used to write for 6 minutes per page earlier, now he writes for 3 minutes per page.

Since each person receives two letters from him per week, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of pages written by Mike is:
Number of pages = Number of recipients x Number of letters received per week / Time taken to write one page
= 5 x 2 / 3 = 10 pages

Now, since Mike can write one page in 6 minutes, it takes him 10 minutes to write 10 pages, which means he spends 4 hours writing letters every week (10 minutes/page x 10 pages/week). Therefore, Mike spends 4 hours writing letters every week."

From the information provided in the question, we know that Jason has 1000 minutes of phone plan per month and he uses 15 minutes of it for daily calls with his boss. So, he has 985 minutes left after calling his boss (1000 - 15 = 985).
Now, let's calculate how many minutes are left after considering other calls he made this month. The question states that he had 300 additional minutes of calls to other people this month. So, if we subtract those 300 minutes from the remaining 985 minutes, we get:
985 - 300 = 685 minutes
Therefore, Jason has 685 minutes or 43.8 hours left on his phone plan at the end of the month, assuming there are 30 days in the month."

Explanation: According to the question, Griffin had 24 fries initially, and Kyle took 5 of them. Therefore, Griffin had 19 fries left (24 - 5 = 19). Then, Jinger gave Griffin two shakes of her cooked fries, which means she gave him 2 x 2 = 4 more fries. So, Griffin now has 19 + 4 = 23 fries. Finally, Colby took three fewer fries than Kyle took, so he took 3 x 5 = 15 fries from Griffin. Therefore, Griffin is left with 23 - 15 = 8 fries at the end. Since Џинџер gave Griffin 3 shakes of her cooked fries, she gave him 3 x 2 = 6 additional fries. So, in total, Griffin has 8 + 6 = 14 fries at the end."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails.
In the second aquarium, there are 32 snails.
The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
So, if we assume that each fish represents 1 snail (which may not be accurate but it's a reasonable assumption), then the total number of snails in both aquariums would be:

First aquarium has 4 snails + 32 snails = 36 snails
Second aquarium has 32 snails + 32 snails = 64 snails
Therefore, the answer is 16."

Explanation:
Maika is paid $250 per hour for her work as a makeup artist. Since she works for 6 hours every day (a total of 36 hours per week), and the film lasts for 5 weeks, Maika earns a total of $1800 ($36/hour x 36 hours/week x 5 weeks).
Since Jin has to pay Maika $250 per hour, he will have to pay her a total of $900 ($250/hour x 36 hours/week x 5 weeks) for her services during the filming period.
After the film is completed, Maika gives Jin a discount of 10%, which means that she will only charge him $810 ($900 - $90) for the entire duration of the project. Therefore, Jin pays a total of $810 to Maika for her services throughout the filming process."
