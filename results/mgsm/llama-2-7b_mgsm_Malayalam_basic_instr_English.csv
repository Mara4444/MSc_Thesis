Explanation:
The question states that there are 4 days in a week and each day has 8 hours of work. Therefore, the total number of working hours in a week is 4 x 8 = 32 hours. Since the salary is Rs 5000 per month, the hourly wage can be calculated as follows:
Hourly wage = Monthly salary / Number of working hours
= Rs 5000 / 32 hours
= Rs 166.67 per hour
Now, we need to calculate the daily wage by multiplying the hourly wage by the number of working days in a month (which is 30 days).
Daily wage = Hourly wage x Number of working days
= Rs 166.67 x 30 days
= Rs 4999 per day
Therefore, the correct answer is Rs 4999 per day."

"Response: 1056784293

Explanation:
The given question consists of two parts - (a) and (b). In part (a), we are asked to find the value of x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20. To solve this equation, we need to isolate the variable x by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 3x = 15. Now, dividing both sides of the equation by 3 gives us x = 5. Therefore, the value of x is 5.

In part (b), we are asked to find the value of y in the equation y^2 = 100. To solve this equation, we can take the square root of both sides of the equation, which gives us y = ±√100 = ±31.61. Since we cannot have a negative value for y, the only possible solution is y = 31.61. Therefore, the value of y is 31.61."

Response: 27649. Explanation: Let X be the number of bags of rice that can be filled with 250 grams each. Since there are 300 grams in one bag, we have X = 300 / 250 = 1.2. So, the total number of bags that can be filled is 1.2 x 250 = 300 bags. Now, let Y be the number of bags that can be filled with 300 grams each. Since there are 2000 grams in one bag, we have Y = 2000 / 300 = 6.7. So, the remaining amount after filling all the bags is 2000 - (6.7 x 300) = 1800 grams.

From the given information, we can calculate the total number of balls as follows:
Total number of balls = Number of balls in 1 bag x Number of bags = 10 x 50 = 500
Now, let's find out how many balls are there in each bag:
Number of balls per bag = Total number of balls / Number of bags = 500 / 10 = 50
So, there are 50 balls in each bag.
As per the question, 30% of the balls are defective, which means that 30/100 = 3 balls are defective. Therefore, the total number of good balls is:
Good balls = Total number of balls - Defective balls = 500 - 3 = 497

Explanation:
The number of years it would take for Joseph to grow his $10 investment at an interest rate of 5% per year is 37 years. This can be calculated by using the formula: Time = Principal x Rate x Years / (1 + Rate)^Years. In this case, the principal is $10, the interest rate is 5%, and the time period is 5 years. Therefore, the total amount grown in 5 years is $10 x 5% x 5 = $25. To find out how many years it will take to double the investment, we need to divide the principal by the growth in each year: $10 / $25 = 4 years. However, since Joseph wants to know the approximate number of years it will take to reach his goal, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 37 years."

Explanation:
The number of cars and bicycles that can be parked in a parking lot with a total area of 30,000 square feet is calculated as follows:

* For cars, the maximum number of vehicles that can be accommodated in a parking lot of this size is 30 (based on the assumption that each car takes up an average space of 20 x 4 = 80 square feet). Therefore, the number of cars that can be parked is 30 x 80 = 2400 square feet / 30,000 square feet = 0.76 or approximately 8 cars.
* For bicycles, the calculation is similar. Based on the assumption that each bicycle takes up an average space of 20 x 2 = 40 square feet, the maximum number of bicycles that can be accommodated in the parking lot is 40 x 80 = 3200 square feet / 30,000 square feet = 0.11 or approximately 11 bicycles.
Therefore, the total number of cars and bicycles that can be parked in the parking lot is 8 + 11 = 19."

Explanation:
The area of one bag is given as 4 square bags = 1 cubic meter.
So, the total area of 4 bags = 4 x 1 m^3 = 4 m^3.
Since each bag contains 50 kg of rice, the weight of all the bags together would be = Total volume of rice / Volume of one bag = 4 m^3 x 50 kg/m^3 = 2000 kg.
Now, we are asked how many kilograms of rice Oru would need to buy if he wants to have 150 dollops (each containing 1 kg) of rice. So, the number of dollops = Total weight of rice / Weight of one dollop = 2000 kg / 1 kg = 2000 dollops."

Explanation:
The number of cups of coffee that can be made using 5 tablespoons of coffee grounds is 5 x 8 = 40 cups.
Since there are 13 tablespoons in an ounce, we need to divide the total amount of coffee by 13 to find out how many ounces it makes: 40 cups / 13 tablespoons per cup = 3.07 ounces (round up to 4 ounces).
So, the total amount of coffee that can be made from one pound of coffee grounds is: 1 pound = 16 ounces; therefore, the number of cups of coffee that can be made from one pound of coffee grounds is: 16 ounces / 4 ounces per cup = 4 cups.
Now, let's calculate the number of cups of coffee that can be made from 200 grams of coffee grounds: 200 grams = 0.2 kilograms; therefore, the number of cups of coffee that can be made from 0.2 kilograms of coffee grounds is: 0.2 kg x 4 cups/kg = 0.8 cups."
