Response:  Total cost = (Number of donuts x Price per donut) + (Number of mini cupcakes x Price per mini cupcake) + (Number of mini cheesecakes x Price per mini cheesecake). In this case, the total cost would be: Total cost = (3 lusin x $68 per lusin) + (2 lusin x $80 per lusin) + (6 lusin x $55 per lusin) = $249 + $170 + $330 = $749.

Explanation: To find the total cost of all the clothes and shoes, we need to multiply the number of each item by its corresponding price. For example, for the shorts, there are 3 pairs at $16.50 per pair, so the total cost is $16.50 x 3 = $49.50. Similarly, for the long pants, there are 3 pairs at $22.50 per pair, so the total cost is $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. For the shoes, there are 3 pairs at $42 per pair, so the total cost is $42 x 3 = $126. Therefore, the total cost of all the clothes and shoes is $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $242.50."

To calculate the number of calories in 300 grams of fried shallots (madué) that contain 250 calories per serving, we need to know how many servings are in the total amount of fried shallots. Based on the information provided, there are 5 portions of fried shallots with a weight of 300 grams each, for a total of 1500 grams of fried shallots. Therefore, the number of calories in 1500 grams of fried shallots is:

Calories = (weight in grams x calories per serving) / number of servings
= (1500 g x 250 cal/serving) / 5 servings
= 6250 calories

Now, let's calculate the number of calories in 1800 grams of fried shallots based on the same formula:

Calories = (weight in grams x calories per serving) / number of servings
= (1800 g x 250 cal/serving) / 5 servings
= 9000 calories

Therefore, the difference between the number of calories in 300 grams and 1800 grams of fried shallots is:

Difference = 9000 - 6250 = 2750 calories

So, if you consume 5 portions of fried shallots with a total weight of 1800 grams, you will intake approximately 2750 additional calories compared to consuming 300 grams at a time."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jean made 30 pieces of rubber bands and then rolled them into balls. Then, she gave each ball to her friend Kadancing for free. If we assume that each ball is equivalent to one unit, then Jean has given away 30 units of rubber balls (or 30 x 1 = 30). Since Jean also made 2 lollipops and gave them away for free, the total number of items she gave away is 30 + 2 = 32. Therefore, the answer is 32."

So, the total number of penny coins that Janet has is:
22 + 8 = 30

Explanation:
Perusahaan A has spent $15,000 for an advertising campaign that lasts for one year, and the company's sales increase by 37.5% after the campaign. To calculate the number of customers gained by the company during the campaign period, we can use the following formula:

Number of customers = Total sales / Original price x Increase percentage

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of customers = ($15,000 x 37.5%) / $15,000 = 37500
Therefore, the number of new customers gained by Perusahaan A during the advertising campaign is 37500."

The numerical answer is 378. Here's how we arrived at that figure:

Jeans charges $250 per jam (hour) for his makeup services.
To calculate the total cost of the makeup session, we need to multiply the number of hours by the charge per hour:
$250 x 6 = $1,500 (for 6 hours of makeup service)
Since the client wants to buy a discounted package deal from Jean, they will get a 10% discount on the total cost:
$1,500 x 0.9 = $1,350 (discounted price)
Now, let's calculate the amount that Jean will receive after the discount:
$1,350 - $100 (amount saved by the client) = $1,250 (amount Jean receives)
So, Jean will receive $1,250 for the makeup session."
