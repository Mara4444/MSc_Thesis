"Response: 
Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every day and bakes four cakes for her friends daily. So she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left to sell at the farmer's market each day.
She sells these eggs at $2 per fresh egg. Therefore, she earns $2 x 13 = $26 per day from selling eggs at the farmer's market."
Response:  We need 2 blue threads and half as many white threads. So we need 2/2 = 1 blue thread and (3/2) = 1.5 white threads. Therefore, we need 4 threads in total: 2 blue and 1.5 white.
"Response:  The original value of the house was $80,000 and after renovation it increased in value by 150%, which means that its new value is:

$80,000 x 150% = $120,000

So, Djos has earned a profit of $40,000 ($120,000 - $80,000)."
"Response:  If James runs three sprints of 60 meters each per week, he will run a total distance of:

3 x 60 = 180 meters per week

So, James will run a total distance of 180 meters per week."
"Response:  We know that Wendy feeds her chickens three meals a day with mixed food for each meal containing seeds, grains and vegetables to keep them healthy. She gives 15 portions of food to her goose in the morning and another 25 portions in the evening. So, if we want to calculate how many portions of food Wendy should give to her chickens in their last meal of the day (assuming she has 20 chickens), we can do so as follows:

Morning feeding: 15 x 20 = 300 portions of food
Evening feeding: 25 x 20 = 500 portions of food
Total number of portions of food given to chickens per day = 300 + 500 = 800 portions
Therefore, Wendy should give 800 portions of food to her chickens in their last meal of the day."
"Response:  If one cup costs $5 and each subsequent cup costs only 60% of its predecessor's price, then we can find out how much each cup will cost as follows:

Cup 1: $5 (not discounted)
Cup 2: $3 (60% of $5)
Cup 3: $3 x 60% = $1.80
Cup 4: $1.80 x 60% = $1.08
...
Cup 16: $1.08 x 60% = $0.64

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay a total of $64 for 16 cups of coffee."
Response:  We know that Tuluzia has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times more sheep than Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Tuluzia has 2 x 4 = 8 times as many sheep as Seattle, or 160 sheep (rounded). Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 160 + 4 x 20 = 320 sheep.
Response:  The total size of the files is 200 GB, and Carla can normally transfer 2 GB per minute. Therefore, it would take her approximately 100 minutes (200 / 2) to transfer all the files. However, due to the installation of updates, she needs to restart her computer after 40% of the transfer process, which takes 20 minutes. So, in total, it would take Carla around 120 minutes (100 + 20) to transfer all the files.
"Response:  First, we know that John traveled for half an hour at a speed of 30 miles per hour (mph), which means he covered a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles
Now, he had 4 hours left to travel, and he wanted to cover this distance at a constant speed of 80 mph. So, we can calculate his total distance traveled during these 4 hours as follows:
Total Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 4 hours = 320 miles
Therefore, John is currently 320 miles away from home."
"Response:  If Eliza is paid $10 per hour and she works for 40 hours in her first 4 days of work (Monday to Thursday), then her total earnings for those 4 days are:

$10/hour x 40 hours = $400

Now, if she works an additional 15 hours on Friday (which is not included in the original 40 hours), her total earnings for the week would be:

$10/hour x 15 hours = $150

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:

$400 + $150 = $550

Therefore, Eliza's weekly salary is $550."
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads. If in the second month, there were three times as many downloads (60 x 3 = 180), and then in the third month, there was a 30% decrease (180 - 30 = 126). So, the total number of downloads over the three months is: 60 + 180 + 126 = 466.
"Response: 
Toula bought 3 decathins of croissants that cost $68 per decaliter, 2 decathins of mini cakes that cost $80 per decathin, and 6 decathins of mini cakes with cheese for $55 per decathin. So in total..."
Response:  First year: * No trees are planted yet, so no income is generated. Second year: * 7 limon trees are planted and can be sold for $1.5 per piece (total revenue of $10.5). Third year: * The trees will start to bear fruit, and 7 pieces can be sold for $1.5 each (total revenue of $10.5 again). Fourth year: * The same as in the second year - 7 pieces of limon can be sold for $1.5 each (total revenue of $10.5). Fifth year: * Again, the same as in the third year - 7 pieces of limon can be sold for $1.5 each (total revenue of $10.5). Sixth year: * Finally, the trees will have fully matured, and 7 pieces of limon can be sold for $1.5 each (total revenue of $10.5). Total time it takes to begin earning money from the trees = 6 years. Therefore, Carlos will need 6 years to begin earning money from his investment in the limon tree farm.
Response:  We know that Melanie has sold three fans in the green house, two fans in the red house, and half of one fan left over in the orange house. So far, she has sold a total of 3 + 2 = 5 fans. Therefore, she started with 5 fans to begin with.
"Response:  We know that out of 20 students in class, 20% are enrolled in modern dance, which means 4 students (20% x 20). Then, we have 25% remaining who are enrolled in other styles, which is equal to 5 students (25% x 20 = 5). So, the total number of students enrolled in non-hip-hop styles is 9 (4 + 5). Now, we need to find out how many students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. Since it says ""the rest,"" or ""ostatak"" in Croatian, we can assume that this group consists of all the remaining students who haven't been assigned to any particular style yet. Therefore, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students enrolled in other styles, which is 16 - 9 = 7. So, 7 students out of 20 are enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"Response:  If we assume that the market price of Nakit will increase by 2.5% and the market price of Electronic devices will increase by 1.2%. Then, the new prices of Nakit and Electronic devices after one month are:
Nakit: $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125
Electronic Devices: $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Now, let's calculate the profit for each option:
Option 1: Nakit
Profit = Selling Price - Purchase Price = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
Option 2: Electronic Devices
Profit = Selling Price - Purchase Price = $8,160 - $8,000 = $160
Therefore, if Trgovac chooses Option 1 (Nakit), he will make a profit of $125 at the end of the month. If he chooses Option 2 (Electronic Devices), he will make a profit of $160 at the end of the month."
Response:  On day one, both cars travel west for 80 miles and then continue north for another 240 miles. So, in total, they have traveled 320 miles (80 + 240) during their first day of travel. Therefore, each car has covered a distance of 160 miles per day (320 / 2 = 160).
"Response: 
Jill earns $20 per hour as an instructor and $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks per year (not including summer break), that means she works for 35 hours per week as an instructor and 15 hours per week as a coach. So her total weekly income is:
Instructor hours: 35 x $20 = $700
Coach hours: 15 x $30 = $450
Total weekly income: $700 + $450 = $1,150
Since Jill works for 50 weeks in a year, her annual income would be:
Annual income: $1,150 x 50 = $57,500
Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
Response:  If Claire makes an omelette from 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, then she will make a total of 3 x 21 = 63 omelettes in one week (7 days). Therefore, if she continues to do so for 4 weeks, she will make a total of 63 x 4 = 252 omelettes.
"Response:  If she took one hour to cover the first 4 miles and then another hour to cover the next 2 miles, that means she covered a total distance of 6 miles in 2 hours. So her average speed for the entire distance is:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken
= 6 miles / 2 hours
= 3 miles/hour
Therefore, the required speed to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles is:

Required Speed = Total Distance - Covered Distance
= 8 miles - 6 miles
= 2 miles/hour

So, the answer is 2 miles per hour."
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice and we want to add it to 15 liters of grape juice. So, the total amount of liquid is 25 liters (10 + 15). Then, when we pour one liter of pineapple juice into the mixture, the total volume becomes 24 liters (25 - 1). Therefore, there are 24 liters of liquid left in the container after adding the pineapple juice.
Response:  We know that Raymon is born 6 years before Samantha and he has a son when he is 23 years old. So, if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymon must have been born 6 + 23 = 29 years ago. Therefore, the correct answer is 29 years.
Response:  We know that there are 8 customers in total and they bought a total of 21 DVDs (since 3 customers bought one each). So, if we divide the number of customers by the number of DVDs purchased per customer, we get an average of 2.625 DVDs sold per customer (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, Billy sold 26 DVDs in total during the day (2 x 13 = 26).
"Response:  The light bulb is burning for 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00). If it burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour, then it will have burned a total distance of:

Distance = Rate x Time
= 2 cm/h x 4 h
= 8 cm

So, after 4 hours, the light bulb will be 8 cm shorter."
Response:  The price of the book after the discount is $19.50 (original price + percentage discount). We know that the percentage discount was 25%, so we can calculate the amount of the discount as follows: Discount = Percentage x Original Price = 25% x $19.50 = $4.875. Therefore, the original price of the book before the discount was $19.50 - $4.875 = $14.625.
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of these items. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 

Total cost = Price of chicken + Price of milk + Price of apples + Price of peaches
= $12 (chicken) + $3 (milk) x 5 (packages) + $1.50 (apples) x 4 (packages) + $8.50 (peaches) x number of packages
= $60

Since Marie paid $50, we know that the number of packages of peaches is equal to $60 - $50 = $10. Therefore, Marie bought 10 packages of peaches. 
So, the answer is 10."
Response:  We know that Mishek bought 3 pairs of shorts, which cost $16.50 each, so she spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on shorts. She also bought 3 pairs of pants, which cost $22.50 each, so she spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on pants. Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes, which cost $42 each, so she spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes. Therefore, in total, Mishek spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $233 on clothes.
"Response:  Since Sintija eats one portion of ice cream every evening and buys boxes with 15 portions per box at $4 per box, she spends money as follows:
Sintija spends $4 x 15 = $60 for each box of ice cream.
Since she buys one box every day (for 60 days), she spends a total of $60 x 60 = $3600 on ice cream in 60 days."
Response:  If Henry has traveled 20 miles after his first stop and then stopped again 15 miles before the end of his journey, we can calculate how many kilometers he traveled between these two points as follows: Distance = Speed x Time + (Distance from previous stop to current location) Where: - Speed is the average speed at which Henry was traveling (in km/h). - Time is the distance traveled in kilometers divided by the speed (in hours). - The distance from the previous stop to the current location is the distance traveled since the last stop (in kilometers). Now let's plug in the values given in the question: Speed = 20 km/h (average speed) Time = Total distance / Speed = 40 km / 20 km/h = 2 hours Distance from previous stop to current location = 15 miles / 1.6 km/mile = 9.4 kilometers Therefore, the total distance traveled by Henry between his first and second stops is: Distance = Speed x Time + (Distance from previous stop to current location) = 20 km/h x 2 hours + 9.4 kilometers = 39.4 kilometers
"Response:  If Gloria buys shoes that cost $50 and she has to choose between two pairs of pants that cost $33 each or $66 together, then...
Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the shoes.
$50 (shoes) + $33 (first pair of pants) + $33 (second pair of pants) = $116
Step 2: Compare the total cost with the budget of $100 for cipele.
$116 > $100, so Gloria cannot afford both pairs of pants.
Therefore, the answer is $0."
Response:  If Darrel is 7 years older than Allen (Darrel = Allen + 7), then their combined age is 7 + 11 = 18 years ago. Now, if they have been alive for 162 years, then Allen has been alive for 162 - 18 = 144 years. So, Allen's current age is 144 years old.
"Response:  We have three friends who gave us different numbers of sweets in their glasses:
Friend 1 said there were 80 sweets in his glass.
Friend 2 said there were 20 more than half of Friend 1's number, which is 40 (since half of 80 is 40).
Friend 3 said there were 25% more than Friend 1's number, which is 100 (since 25% more than 80 is 100).
So, we have the following information:
80 + 40 = 120
120 + 100 = 220
Now, let's find the average of these three numbers:
Average = (80 + 40 + 100) / 3 = 160 / 3 = 53
Therefore, the average number of sweets in each friend's glass is 53."
"Response:  If John spends half an hour per day taking care of his 10 dogs, he will spend:

Half an hour/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his 10 dogs."
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and she has 30 more silver coins than bronze coins. So, if she has x bronze coins, then she has 3x silver coins. Therefore, we can write an equation: 110 = 3x. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 37. So, Gretchen has 37 silver coins.
Response:  We know that Siobhan has two fewer dragons than Aaron and that Aaron has five more dragons than half of Raymond's dragons. So, if Raymond has 40 dragons, then Aaron has 45 dragons (since he has five more than half of Raymond's). Now, we can find out how many dragons Siobhan has by subtracting two from Aaron's number: 45 - 2 = 43 dragons. Therefore, Siobhan has 43 dragons.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, which means he averaged 0.2 points per minute (4/20). Now, in the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than before, which is equal to 0.3 points per minute (25% of 0.2 points per minute). Therefore, Mike scored a total of 8 points in the last 20 minutes (0.3 points/minute x 20 minutes). So, his overall score is 12 points (4 + 8).
Response:  Terry buys two yogurts per day, so he spends $8 on yogurt every day ($4 x 2). In 30 days, Terry will spend a total of $240 on yogurt (($8/day) x 30 days).
Response:  We know that John sold all of his LEGO sets and used the money to buy 8 video games at $20 each. So he spent a total of $160 on video games. Since he had $15 for each of his 13 LEGO sets, he must have had a total of $195 ($15 x 13 = $195). Therefore, there are still 7 LEGO sets left over ($195 - $160 = $35).
Response:  If he runs 100 km in one day, that means he runs at an average speed of 100/7 = 14 km/h. Since he runs three days a week, his total distance covered per week is 3 x 100 = 300 km. Now, if he runs for half the time during the next two days (i.e., 2 days), then his total distance covered in those 2 days would be 2 x 50 = 100 km. So, his overall speed can be calculated as follows: Total distance covered / Time taken = 300 km / 3 days + 100 km / 2 days = 16 km/h + 5 km/h = 21 km/h. Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 21 km/h.
"Response:  If Dana can run four times faster than walking and jump twice as far in one minute as she can walk, then we know that:

* Running speed = 4 x Walking speed (since Dana runs four times faster)
* Jumping distance = 2 x Walking distance/minute (since Dana jumps twice as far in one minute as she can walk)

Now, let's convert the given information into numerical values:

Walking speed = 1 mile/hour (based on the conversion of 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers)
Jumping distance = 3 miles/hour (based on the given information)
Running speed = 4 x Walking speed = 4 x 1 mile/hour = 4 miles/hour

So, if Dana spends 6 hours running and 3 hours hiking, her total distance covered would be:

Distance ran = Running speed x Time spent running = 4 miles/hour x 6 hours = 24 miles
Distance hiked = Walking speed x Time spent hiking = 1 mile/hour x 3 hours = 3 miles
Total distance = Distance ran + Distance hiked = 24 miles + 3 miles = 27 miles

Therefore, Dana covers a total distance of 27 miles in 6 hours, consisting of 24 miles ran and 3 miles hiked."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, we know that:
Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzanne's iPhone.
Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone.
So, if Suzanne's iPhone is x years old, then Brandon's iPhone is 4x years old.
We are also given that Brandon's iPhone is older than Ben's iPhone by four times. So, if Ben's iPhone is y years old, then Brandon's iPhone is 4y years old.
Now, we can set up an equation based on these two statements:
4y = x + 4(y)
Solving for y (the age of Brandon's iPhone), we get:
y = x / 5
Substituting x = Suzanne's iPhone age (which is given as x years old), we get:
y = x / 5
Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 5 years older than Suzanne's iPhone."
Response:  When Polly holds the sapphire, she can throw the golden arrow three times farther than when she doesn't hold it. So if she throws the golden arrow from a distance of x meters while holding the sapphire, then the maximum distance that the arrow can travel is 3x meters. Now, let's find out how far Polly can stand from the dragon's flame and still hit it with her golden arrow. If Polly stands at a distance of y meters from the dragon's flame, then the angle between the line connecting Polly to the dragon and the line connecting Polly to the arrow is given by tan(θ) = y / x, where x is the distance between Polly and the dragon's flame, and y is the distance between Polly and the arrow. Since we want to maximize the distance traveled by the arrow, we should choose the value of θ that makes tan(θ) equal to the maximum possible value. Solving for θ, we get θ = arctan(y/x), which gives us the maximum distance that Polly can stand from the dragon's flame and still hit it with her golden arrow. Substituting this value into our original equation, we get the maximum distance that Polly can throw the golden arrow is 3(arctan(y/x)) meters. Therefore, the answer is 3(arctan(y/x)) meters.
Response:  We know that Baka Džons has baked 5 apple pies for the party and she cut each pie into 8 slices. So, in total, there are 5 x 8 = 40 slices of apple pie available at the buffet table. Now, we are told that after all the guests have taken their shares, there are still 14 pieces left over. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 40 - 14 = 26.
Response:  If one serving of chips has 250 calories and you want to eat 5 servings (which is equal to 300g), then each serving would have 250/5 = 50 calories. Since you already consumed 1800 calories, you can still eat 50 + 1800 = 1850 calories from other food sources.
"Response:  If he sells each piece of honey for $2, and it costs him $10 to make one kilogram (kg) of honey, then his profit per kg is:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $2 - $10 = -$8
So if he makes 20 pieces of honey, his total cost would be:
Cost = Number of pieces x Cost per piece = 20 x (-$8) = -$160
And his total revenue would be:
Revenue = Number of pieces x Selling price = 20 x $2 = $40
Therefore, his net profit would be:
Net Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40 - $-160 = $240
So he would have a net profit of $240 if he makes and sells 20 pieces of honey."
"Response: 
Meredith spends an average of 4 hours per blog post.
She wrote 5 articles in Monday and twice as many articles in Tuesday compared to Monday.
She wrote double the number of articles in Wednesday than in Tuesday.
So, let's calculate the time spent writing each day:
Monday: 5 x 4 = 20 hours
Tuesday: 10 x 4 = 40 hours (double the amount from Monday)
Wednesday: 10 x 4 = 40 hours (again, double the amount from Tuesday)
Total time spent writing: 20 + 40 + 40 = 100 hours
Therefore, Meredith spent 100 hours writing blog posts in those three days."
"Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-It notes in her bag before she left for work and then bought a pack of Post-It notes at the store. She also knows that there are 220 different types of coffee cups at her workplace. So, if she used one Post-It note per cup, then the number of Post-It notes she bought is equal to the total number of different types of coffee cups minus the number of Post-It notes she already had (80). Therefore, the number of Post-It notes in the pack she bought is:

220 - 80 = 140

So, there were 140 Post-It notes in the pack that Candice bought."
Response:  We know that John buys twice as many red scarves as blue ones. So, if he bought x red scarves, he also bought 2x blue scarves. The total cost of the red scarves is 50% more than the blue ones, so the cost of each red scarf is (1 + 0.5) \* $40 = $60. Since John spent $200 on both types of scarves together, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = $200. Solving for x, we get x = $80. Therefore, John spent $80 on red scarves and $120 on blue scarves ($200 - $80).
"Response:  We know that Tracy used 4 meters of wire to support the parsley plants in her garden. Since each meter of wire is cut into pieces of length 15 centimeters, we can calculate how many pieces she got as follows:
Number of pieces = Length of wire (in meters) / Length of piece (in centimeters)
= 4 meters / 15 centimeters
= 267 pieces
Therefore, Tracy received 267 pieces of wire with each piece measuring 15 centimeters long."
Response:  We know that Richard lives in a building with 15 floors and each floor has 8 units. So, there are 15 x 8 = 120 units in total. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of free units as follows: 1 - (3/4) x 120 = 60 units. Therefore, there are 60 free units in the building.
Response:  If Lloyd has 100 chickens and they lay 252 eggs per day, then he will have 252 x 100 = 25,200 eggs per week. If he sells each egg for $2, then his total revenue per week is 25,200 x $2 = $50,400. So, Lloyd earns $50,400 per week from his chicken farm.
Response:  The boat travelled for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour = 16 km/h (since there are 10 miles in 1 hour). Then it turned around and returned with a speed of 6 km/h. To find out how long it took to return, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is 10 miles x 2 trips = 20 miles or 32 km. So, the time it took to return is: Time = 32 km / 6 km/h = 5.33 hours.
Response:  If he has to remove 5 kg from his bag and each of his strips weighs 1 kg, then he will have to remove 5 / 1 = 5 strips. Similarly, if each of his toys weighs 1 kg, then he will have to remove 5 / 1 = 5 toys. Therefore, he needs to remove 5 + 5 = 10 items from his bag.
Response:  On Monday (the day with higher income), the mechanic repaired 6 tires and 4 cars, so he earned $6 x 6 = $36 for tire repair and $4 x 4 = $16 for car repair, in total $52. On Friday (the day with lower income), the mechanic repaired 12 cars but did not repair any tires, so he earned $4 x 12 = $48 for car repair only, $48. Therefore, the difference between the two days is $52 - $48 = $4. So, the mechanic earned $4 more on the day with higher income.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:

* Sestre Doubtfire (the family name) has 7 adopted cats.
* The mother of the family calls them to inform them that their two household cats have just had kittens.
* Patchy, the first cat, had three times as many adopted kittens as her own number of kittens.
* Trixie, the second cat, had 12 adopted kittens.

Now, let's use this information to calculate the total number of mačiće (kittens) that the Doubtfire family now has:

Total number of cats = Number of original cats + Number of adopted kittens
= 2 (original cats) + 3 x (Patchy's adopted kittens) + 12 (Trixie's adopted kittens)
= 2 + 9 + 12
= 23

Therefore, the Doubtfire family currently has 23 mačiće (kittens)."
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 lizalics and he wants to pack them into one basket. If he puts 2 lizalics in each of his baskets, then he will have 15 baskets (30 / 2 = 15). So, Jean can fill 15 baskets with lizalics.
"Response:  If Peter has $42 for the week and he always pays $7 for tickets and snacks, then he can go to the movies $\boxed{6}$ times. Here's how we calculate it:

$42 / 7 = 6 \times$

So, Peter can go to the movies 6 times with his budget of $42 for the week."
Response:  The maximum weight of each container is 5 kg, and there are x containers in total. Therefore, the total weight of all containers is 5x kg. Since the overall weight of the driver and empty truck is 1400 kg, we can write the equation: 5x + 1400 = 5000. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 320. So, the maximum number of containers that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 320.
Response:  Firstly, Stephen paid $40 for his groceries online. Then, he was charged an additional 25% tax of that amount, which is equal to $10 (since the total cost including taxes is $50). So, the new total cost becomes $60 ($40 + $10). Next, there is a delivery charge of $3, bringing the final cost to $63 ($60 + $3). Finally, Stephen added $4 as a tip, making the total cost $67 ($63 + $4). Therefore, the correct answer is $67.
Response:  We have 6 clusters of berries with 20 berries in each cluster and 67 individual berries scattered across the bush. So, we need to calculate the total number of berries as follows: Total number of berries = Number of clusters x Number of berries per cluster + Number of individual berries Total number of berries = 6 x 20 + 67 = 153 berries Therefore, there are 153 berries in the bush.
Response:  We know that out of 25 oranges, one is bad (loša), and we also know that 20% are not yet ripe (nezrela). That means there are 23 good oranges left. Now, let's calculate how many good oranges have a sweet taste (kisela): since 20% of the oranges are already sweet, that means 4.6 oranges (20/25 x 100%) are sweet. So, in total, there are 23 + 4.6 = 27.6 good oranges with a sweet taste. Finally, we subtract the number of bad oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 27.6 - 1 = 26.6 good oranges. Therefore, there are 26.6 good oranges among the 25 oranges.
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for materials and then $800 for gold plating, so in total she paid $1300. Then, she paid 10% of that amount as insurance, which is $130. So, her total cost would be $1430.
"Response:  If she worked for the same company for 40 years and received an annual pension of $50,000 per year after 20 years of service, then her total accumulated pension value would be:

$50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000

After 30 years of service, she would be eligible to receive 5% of the accumulated pension value each year, which is:

$1,000,000 x 5% = $50,000

Therefore, if she leaves after 30 years, her annual pension would be $50,000."
Response:  The first half of the year (January to June) cost $70 ($140 / 2). In the second half of the year (July to December), the company paid $63 ($10% less than the previous amount). So, the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service in one year is: $70 + $63 = $133.
"Response:  We know that Sofija has traveled 160 km since she last filled up her tank and she needs to add 4 gallons of gasoline to continue driving. The capacity of her fuel tank is 12 gallons (according to the instructions). So, if we divide the distance traveled (160 km) by the amount of fuel left in the tank (4 gallons), we can calculate how far Sofija can drive with one rezervoram of gasoline:

Distance = Distance traveled / Amount of fuel left in the tank
= 160 km / 4 gal
= 40 km

Therefore, Sofija can drive approximately 40 kilometers with one rezervoram of gasoline."
Response:  If Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then goes to bed and reads for half of the time (which is 30 minutes), he will spend 1 hour reading in total. So, if he does this 3 times a week, he will spend 3 x 1 = 3 hours reading per week. Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends watching TV per week: 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week. Therefore, Jim spends 3 hours/week reading and 14 hours/week watching TV.
"Response: 
1. Each school has a girls' and boys' team, so there are 2 teams per school (girls + boys).
2. Each team consists of 5 players, so the total number of players is 2 x 5 = 10 players per school.
3. Since there are 4 schools participating in the tournament, the total number of players is 4 x 10 = 40 players.
4. Additionally, each school has sent a coach for each team, so the total number of coaches is also 4.
Therefore, the final answer is: 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people."
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies in total. The number of smaragds is twice the number of rubies, so we can write: Number of smaragds = 2 × Number of rubies = 2 × 35 = 70. Therefore, the total number of precious stones in the sack is: Total number of precious stones = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of smaragds = 175 + 35 + 70 = 280. So, there were 280 precious stones in the sack.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in school. So if there are 60 girls, then there are 120 boys (since 2 x 60 = 120). If each teacher has 5 students, then we can calculate how many teachers there are as follows: Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher = 120 / 5 = 24. Therefore, there are 24 teachers in Dr. Wertz's school.
Response:  If Bailey starts with $X dollars and earns $5 per week for 8 weeks, then she has earned total amount of money = $5 x 8 = $40. Now, if she works for another 4 weeks and earns $5 per week again, then she will have earned additional amount of money = $5 x 4 = $20. So, in total, Bailey has earned = $40 + $20 = $60. Therefore, Bailey had $X = $60 - $100 = -$40 dollars at the beginning.
Response:  If Judy teaches for 5 hours per day and there are 7 days in a week (Monday to Sunday), then she will teach for a total of 35 hours per week (5 x 7 = 35). And if she charges $15 per student per hour, her total earnings per week would be: 35 hours/week x $15/hour x 15 students/class = $4950 per week.
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Therefore, if we multiply 20 by 2, we get 40 instructions in total for both recipes combined. So, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions to prepare both meals.
"Response:  If Tommy sells 43 pieces of cookies for $3 each and 23 pieces of cheese cakes for $4 each, he will make a total of:

Cookies: 43 x $3 = $130
Cheesecakes: 23 x $4 = $92
Total amount of money Tommy will make is: $130 + $92 = $222
Therefore, Tommy will gather $222 in total."
"Response:  If she bought 5 mobile phones at $150 each for 3 months, then the total cost would be: Total Cost = Number of Mobile Phones x Price per Mobile Phone x Time Period 
Total Cost = 5 x $150 x 3 = $4500 So, if we calculate the interest paid for 3 months, it will be: Interest Paid = Principal Amount x Rate x Time Period / (1 + Rate)^Time Period 
Interest Paid = $4500 x 2% x 3/((1+2%)^3) = $78.69 Therefore, Šila will have to pay $78.69 every month for 3 months."
"Response:  If we assume that each liter of flowers costs $X dollars, then...

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 3 types of flowers:

* Nalivke (2,74$/l) = X x 12 = 32.96$
* Petunije (1,87$/l) = X x 9 = 16.53$
* Begonije (2,12$/l) = X x 17 = 34.94$

Step 2: Find out how much money Artie will make if he sells all the flowers:

Total cost of flowers = Cost of nalivke + Cost of petunije + Cost of begonije
= 32.96 + 16.53 + 34.94 = 84.43$

So, Artie will make $84.43 if he sells all the flowers."
"Response:  If Luke builds $n$ levels of sandcastles, each level will have half the area of the previous one (since he said that every level has $\frac{1}{2}$ square meters). So, if he builds $4$ levels, the area of the top level will be:
$$A = \frac{1}{2}^4 = \boxed{8}$$
So, the average area of each level is:
$$\text{average area} = \frac{A}{4} = \boxed{\frac{8}{4}} = 2$$
Therefore, the average area of each level is $2$ square meters."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Cecilia has bought a new puppy and her veterinarian recommends that she feed it with dog food for dogs every day during the first 180 days. After that, she needs to feed it with adult dog food every day until the end of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 spoons, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year? So, the answer is 180/110 = 1.6375 bags of dog food. Therefore, Cecilia will need approximately 1.64 bags of dog food in the first year.
"Response:  We know that:
Raymond makes $2 more than Sara per hour. So, if Sara works for x hours and earns y dollars, then Raymond will work for x hours and earn y + 2 dollars.
We also know that Sarah is four times as much as David. So, if Sarah works for z hours and earns w dollars, then David works for z/4 hours and earns w/4 dollars.
Now we have to find out how many hours Raymoned worked and how much he earned, and how many hours David worked and how much he earned. Then we can calculate the difference in the amount of money they made.
So, let's start with the information given in the question:
Ako Raymond pere pola većeg rublja od Sare, a Sara četverostruko više od Davida, which means that:
Raymond makes $2 more than Sara per hour.
Sara is four times as much as David.
Now we need to use this information to solve the problem:
Let's say Sara works for x hours and earns y dollars. Since Raymond makes $2 more than Sara per hour, Raymond works for x hours and earns y + 2 dollars.
And since Sarah is four times as much as David, if Sarah works for z hours and earns w dollars, then David works for z/4 hours and earns w/4 dollars.
So, we can write the equation:
Raymond's total hours = Sara's total hours + David's total hours
Raymond's total dollars = Sara's total dollars + David's total dollars
Since we are asked to find the difference in the amount of money they made, we can set up the equation:
Difference between Raymond and David = Raymond's total dollars - David's total dollars
Now we have to solve these equations using the values provided in the question:
x = 400 (since Sara worked for 400 hours)
y = 400 (since Sara earned $400)
z = 1600 (since David worked for 1600 hours)
w = 350 (since David earned $350)
Now we can substitute these"
Response:  If we buy 3 bunches of flowers for $2.50 each, it will cost us $7.50 (3 x $2.50). And if we buy 2 bunches of flowers for $1 each, it will also cost us $2 ($2 x 2 = $4). So in total, buying 18 bunches of flowers will cost us $9.50 ($7.50 + $2 = $9.50). Therefore, we will save $8.50 ($18 - $9.50) by buying more bunches of flowers at a better price.
Response:  The original price of the dog grooming is $100. If the groomer offers a 30% discount for new clients, that means the discount amount is $30 (30% of $100). So, the final price of the dog grooming for John would be $70 ($100 - $30).
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water each, so between them they got 24/6 = 4 liters of water. Now, the boy received 6 liters of water, leaving 4 - 6 = 2 liters of water remaining. Therefore, there are 2 liters of water left.
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 nice dresses before buying any from the market. Then he bought 21 nice dresses from the market and gave 9 to his sister. So, he has 21 - 9 = 12 nice dresses left. Finally, he used 28 nice dresses for decoration. Therefore, Charlie has 12 - 28 = -16 nice dresses left.
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times more than Grace. So, Alex weighs 125 x 4 = 500 pounds. Therefore, their total weight in kg is 500 / 2.2 = 226.7 kg.
Response:  If Dan has planted three rose bushes and each rose bush has 25 roses, then there are 3 x 25 = 75 roses in total. Since each rose has 8 thorns, there are 75 x 8 = 600 thorns in total. Therefore, the answer is 600.
Response:  The team has played 22 matches and won 8 more than they lost. So, if they have lost x number of times, then they have won 8 + x times. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 22 = 8 + x. Now, solving for x, we get: x = 14. So, the team has won 14 matches and lost 8 matches.
Response:  We know that Gene has been on vacation for 16 years (from his 23rd year to his current age of 34). Therefore, he has taken 4 vacations so far. For each vacation, he has worn one shirt per day, and each shirt has its own unique block. So, in total, there are 4 \* 365 = 1460 blocks from all the shirts Gene has worn during his vacations.
Response:  The first time the alarm went off today, it sounded four times. So, in total, the alarm has sounded 4 + 3 = 7 times so far today.
"Response:  If the company pays each employee $600 per month and has a policy of increasing their salary by 10% for each year they stay with the company, then Sylvie's annual salary after three years of service would be:

$600/month x 3 = $1800/year (salary in first three years)

Since Sylvie has already been with the company for five years, her salary after five years would be:

$1800/year x 2 = $3600/year (salary after five years)

Therefore, Sylvie's current annual salary is $3600."
"Response:  We know that Marilynina prva ploča je prodata 10 puta više od Haraldove, which means that if Marilyn sold x copies of her first album, Harald sold x/10 copies. Since they together sold 88,000 copies, we can set up the equation:
x + (x/10) = 88,000
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
2x = 88,000
X = 44,000
So, Harald sold 44,000 copies of his first album."
Response:  We know that there will be 16 guests and each guest will receive 75 pieces of candy (since they are invited). So, we need to calculate how many candies we need in total. Since each piece costs $2, we can calculate the total cost as follows: Total number of candies needed = Number of guests x Number of pieces per guest Total number of candies needed = 16 x 75 Total number of candies needed = 1200 candies Therefore, Christina will spend $240 ($2 x 1200) on candy for her friends.
Response:  We know that an adult dinosaur can eat 10 kg of crumpled salad. Since there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, we need to calculate how much food each person will get. To do this, we divide the total amount of food (10 kg) by the number of people attending the picnic: 10 kg / 25 = 0.4 kg per person. So, Ted needs to bring enough crumpled salad for everyone at the picnic.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Jan has more than three lovers (Marsia).
Marcia has two lovers more than Cindy.
Cindy has four lovers.
So, if we assume that the number of lovers for each person is represented by the variable x, y and z respectively, then we can write:
x + y > 3 (representing Jan)
2y = 4 (representing Marcia)
z = 4 (representing Cindy)
Now we have three equations and three variables. Solving them simultaneously gives us:
x = 5
y = 7
z = 4
Therefore, the answer is 5, 7, and 4."
Response:  We know that Amy is 4 years older than Emily, so Amy is 5 + 4 = 9 years old. Then we know that Jackson is younger than Amy and Corey, but not as young as James. So Jackson must be between 7 and 9 years old (inclusive). Therefore, Jackson is 8 years old.
"Response:  If Lee could run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds before his diet change, and he improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet, then we can assume that his new time for running 400 meters without obstacles would be 35.2 seconds (38 x 1.1 = 41.6). Now, if Gerald runs 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, then his speed relative to Lee's original speed would be:
Gerald's speed / Lee's original speed = 38 / 38 = 1
So, Gerald's speed after improving his diet would be 1.1 times faster than Lee's original speed, which means he could run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 35.2 + 10% = 38.7 seconds."
Response:  If there are 12 times fewer dogs than cats and dogs, then there are 12 x 60 = 720 cats. Since two cats are on each dog, there are 720 / 2 = 360 dogs in the kennel. Therefore, the total number of animals is 720 + 360 = 1080.
"Response:  We know that out of 200 students in the fifth grade, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls who are scouts. So, we can write this as an equation:

Boys = 2/5 x 200 = 40
Girls = 2/3 x 200 = 133
Now, we want to find out how many boys are not in the scouts. To do this, we subtract the number of boys who are scouts from the total number of boys:

Non-scouts (boys) = Boys - 40 = 200 - 40 = 160
So, there are 160 non-scouting boys in the class."
"Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for 2/3 of that time, then we can write an equation as follows:
Harry = x (where x is the number of hours Harry slept)
James = 2/3x (where 2/3x is the number of hours James slept)
Now, we are asked to find out how many hours Harry slept more than James. So, let's subtract the two equations:
Harry - James =?
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
9 - 2/3x =?
Simplifying the equation, we get:
6x = 7
Solving for x, we get:
x = 10
So, Harry slept for 10 hours more than James."
Response:  We know that each 16-ounce container of preserved pickles contains three pickles and loses half its volume during storage. So if Fred used 32 ounces of pickle juice in her last series of pickles, she must have used 32 / 2 = 16 containers of pickles. Therefore, Fred used 16 x 3 = 48 pickles in total.
"Response:  At first, there were 30 cars on the highway. In the first 15 minutes, some of them passed through the traffic jam, and then another 20 cars passed through in the remaining 15 minutes. Five cars from the line did not have to go through the traffic jam. So, in total, how many cars went through the traffic jam?

Let T be the number of cars that went through the traffic jam.

From the question, we know that T + 5 = 30 (the initial number of cars).

In the first 15 minutes, 5 cars left the line, so the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is: T - 5.

In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 cars passed through the traffic jam, so the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is: 20.

Therefore, the final number of cars that went through the traffic jam is: T - 5 + 20 = 25."
Response:  Mary has 18 new plants from her favorite garden. She already has two plants in each of the 40 windows in her large house in the countryside. If she wants to give one plant to each friend and family member tomorrow, how many plants will she have left for herself? Therefore, the answer is 16 (18 - 2 x number of friends and family).
Response:  The first friend pressed the bell 20 times before Jerome opened it, so the total number of presses was 20 + (1/4) \* 20 = 35. Then, the second friend pressed the bell 10 more times than the first friend, so they pressed it 35 + 10 = 45 times. Similarly, the third friend pressed it 10 times more than the second friend, or 45 + 10 = 55 times. Finally, the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, so the total number of presses was 55 + 60 = 115. Therefore, the bell rang 115 times.
"Response: 
Solo has already read 4 pages from his science textbook and 20 pages from his social studies textbook, so he has a total of 24 pages read so far.
He still needs to read 26 pages from his history book and 8 pages from his geography book, which means he needs to read an average of 3.25 pages per day (26/7 + 8/7 = 3.25)."
"Response: 
Džon likes to drink water from a cup during breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, he also has one before going to bed. John does this every workday, but on weekends, he wants to relax and drink juice in the evening. How many cups of water does John drink per week?

So, let's calculate it:

Breakfast x 7 = 49 cups of water
Lunch x 5 = 250 cups of water
Dinner x 7 = 490 cups of water
Before bed x 3 = 108 cups of water
Total cups of water per week = 876 cups

Therefore, John drinks approximately 876 cups of water per week."
"Response:  The distance from the ocean to the opposite end of the city is 42 miles (67.6 km). To cover this distance in 10 minutes, we need to move at a speed of:

Speed = Distance / Time = 67.6 km / 10 min = 6.76 km/min

Now, let's calculate how long it will take for the fog to cover the entire city:

Time = Distance / Speed = 42 mi / 6.76 km/min = 6.3 hours

Therefore, it will take approximately 6.3 hours for the fog to cover the entire city."
Response:  If Poppy has 1000 pieces of candy and she puts 25% (or 250 pieces) on the plate, then her mother puts 33% (or 330 pieces) of the remaining candies on top of that. So, the total number of pieces of candy left is: 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces. Therefore, there are 750 pieces of candy left to be placed on the plate.
Response:  If Cody eats 3 times more cookies than Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. So together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.
"Response:  The volume of each box is given as follows:
Volume of first box = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Volume of second box = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Volume of third box = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
The total volume of all three boxes is therefore:
Total volume = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box
= 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches
= 360 cubic inches
Since the walls are 5 cm thick, we need to subtract their volume from the total volume to get the internal volume of the container:
Internal volume = Total volume - Wall volume
= 360 cubic inches - (5 cm x 3 kutije)
= 360 cubic inches - 15 cubic inches
= 345 cubic inches
Therefore, the total internal volume of all three boxes is approximately 345 cubic inches."
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Frankie watched one hour of his favorite show every evening after finishing his homework.
On Monday and Tuesday, he watched several episodes of a 30-minute show.
On Wednesday, he finished his homework earlier than usual and watched an hour and a half of his favorite show.
On Thursday, he stayed up late for the weekend and watched two hours of his favorite show.
So, let's calculate how much time Frankie spent watching his favorite show each day:
Monday and Tuesday: Several episodes x 30 minutes per episode = 2 hours (since he watched multiple episodes)
Wednesday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1 hour and 30 minutes
Thursday: 2 hours
Therefore, Frankie watched a total of 6 hours and 30 minutes of his favorite show during the week."
Response:  Last year, Henry made 95 kolačića (as stated in the problem). If he wanted to double that amount this year, then he would have made 190 kolačića (2 x 95 = 190). However, since he actually ended up making 110 kolačića after miscounting, we can deduce that he made 80 more kolačića than last year (110 - 95 = 15). So, the number of kolačića Henry pecao prošle godine (last year) is 80.
Response:  The cost of one gallon of gasoline is $3, so if someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline, they will pay $3 x 10 = $30. If the company offers a discount of $20 for each gallon of gasoline filled at that station, then the total amount the person will receive as a refund is $20 x 10 = $200. Therefore, after receiving the refund, the person will have $30 - $200 = -$170 left with their gasoline.
"Response:  If both Beatrice and Marcelli are able to eat as many roll-ups as they can find, then their total number of roll-ups is equal to the sum of their individual numbers of roll-ups. Therefore, we have:

Beatrice's total number of roll-ups = Number of roll-ups Beatrice found + Number of roll-ups Marcelli found
= 24 + (Number of roll-ups Marcelli found)
Marcelli's total number of roll-ups = Number of roll-ups Marcelli found
= (Number of roll-ups Marcelli found)
Now, let's calculate the average number of roll-ups each person ate:
Average number of roll-ups for Beatrice = Total number of roll-ups for Beatrice / Number of people eating roll-ups
= (24 + (Number of roll-ups Marcelli found)) / 2
Average number of roll-ups for Marcelli = Total number of roll-ups for Marcelli / Number of people eating roll-ups
= (Number of roll-ups Marcelli found) / 1
So, the average number of roll-ups each person ate is:
Beatrice - 12 roll-ups
Marcelli - 6 roll-ups"
Response:  The boat is taking in two liters of water for every ten meters it moves forward. Since Julia took 16 seconds to move 20 meters, she moved at a speed of 20/16 = 1.25 meters per second. Now, we need to find out how much water the boat was carrying when Julia reached the shore. We know that the volume of water taken in is equal to the speed of the boat times the distance traveled. So, in this case, the volume of water taken in is: Volume = Speed x Distance = 1.25 m/s x 20 m = 25 liters. Therefore, there were 25 liters of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore.
"Response:  The number of times the chalkboard is cleaned per day can be calculated as follows:

1. First lesson (8 am): 4 teachers share the chalkboard, so it will be cleaned once.
2. Second lesson (9:30 am): Each teacher has their own lesson, so the chalkboard won't be cleaned again.
3. Third lesson (11 am): Again, each teacher has their own lesson, so the chalkboard won't be cleaned again.
4. Fourth lesson (12 pm): All 4 teachers share the chalkboard again, so it will be cleaned once more.

Therefore, the chalkboard is cleaned 4 + 1 = 5 times per day."
"Response:  After 15 days, if Ryan has planted 2 sunflowers per day in his garden and 5 of them have not grown yet, then he will have a total of:

$$ Sunflowers = 2 \times 15 = 30 $$

So after 15 days, Ryan will have 30 sunflowers in his garden."
Response:  We know that Jamalov telefon can hold 1800 photographs and Britanny's phone can hold 6 times more than Jamalov's phone. So, Britanny's phone can hold 1800 x 6 = 11200 photographs. Now we are told that the largest number of photographs that Britanny's phone can receive is 50 times larger than the number of birds in Jamalov's picture of a flock of pigeons at the zoo. Therefore, if there are X birds in Jamalov's picture, then the number of photographs that Britanny's phone can receive is 50X. Since Jamalov's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the equation: 1800 = 50X. Solving for X, we get X = 36. So, there are 36 birds in Jamalov's picture of a flock of pigeons at the zoo.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasa has 15 pieces of wood (10 pieces of 2x4x10 + 5 pieces of 4x4x10). Each piece costs $10 or $16 per unit, respectively. If she decides to sell all these pieces, her total revenue will be:
Revenue = Number of pieces \* Price per piece
= 15 pieces \* ($10/piece)
= 15 x $10
= $150
Therefore, if Sasa sells all the pieces of wood, she will earn $150 in total."
Response:  If Keti uses 7 times more sugar than water in her coffee, then for every 1 part of water she uses, she will use 7 parts of sugar. So if she used x parts of water, she will have used 7x parts of sugar. Since she used a total of 120 kašića (which is equal to 400 ml) of water and 840 kašića (which is equal to 3000 ml) of sugar, we can set up the following equation: 7x = 840...(1) Now solve for x: x = 120...(2) Therefore, Keti used 120 kašića of sugar.
Response:  If John buys two pairs of shoes for each of his three children, he will buy a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John will pay a total of 6 x $60 = $360. Therefore, John has paid $360.
Response:  On day one, there were two containers with 5 vehicles each, so in total, there were 10 vehicles (2 x 5 = 10). If another container was brought in on the next day, and it also contained 5 vehicles, then the total number of vehicles in the port would be 15 (10 + 5 = 15). Therefore, the answer is 15.
"Response:  We know that Adrian's salary increased by $10,000 in four years and then he earned 40% more than before. So his new salary would be:
Adrian's new salary = Old salary + (New salary x Percentage increase)
= 50,000 + (60,000 x 40%)
= 70,000
Therefore, Adrian's total income with Layla over the past four years is $70,000."
Response:  If Miguel uses two sheets of paper per week for his drawing and has 30 sheets of paper on each sheet, then he will use 60 sheets of paper per week (2 x 30 = 60). Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Miguel will use 240 sheets of paper per month (60 x 4 = 240). Therefore, he will use 120 sheets of paper per month (240 - 120 = 120).
Response:  Morisete has given 5 jabuk and 8 pomorandža, so she has in total 5 + 8 = 13 pieces of fruit. Kael has given twice as many jabukas as Morisete, which means he has given 2 x 5 = 10 jabuk. He also has half as many pomorandža as Morisete, which means he has 5 / 2 = 7 pomorandža. So, altogether they have 13 + 10 + 7 = 30 pieces of fruit.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. If she slept for 2 less hours each of the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), then she slept for 6 + 4 = 10 hours total in those two days. So, if she slept for 1 hour more than that on Thursday, she must have slept for 11 hours that day. Therefore, Sadie slept for a total of 8 + 11 = 19 hours during the entire week.
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 miles in one hour (which is equal to 60 minutes), then she can run 60 x 10 = 600 miles in 7 hours. So, Rosie can run 600 / 8 = 75 kilometers in 7 hours. Therefore, the answer is 75 kilometers.
Response:  When Jenny started helping her mom in the office, there were 60 letters that needed to be stamped and 30 of them had already been stamped. So, at that time, there were 30 unstamped letters (60 - 30 = 30). Now, let's assume that Jenny has been working for x hours. The number of hours worked is given by the equation: Number of hours worked = Total number of letters / Rate at which she can stamp letters per hour. In this case, the rate at which Jenny can stamp letters per hour is 1/2 because she can only stamp one side of each letter at a time. Therefore, we can write: Number of hours worked = 60 / (1/2) = 30 hours. So, Jenny worked for 30 hours before taking a break.
Response:  Julia bought a new box of plastic bags and used three to test her goulash. Later, her husband gave her five more bags. So, in total, Julia had 8 bags (3 + 5).
Response:  We know that Dylan bought 38 piletines and 6 more riblje than piletines. So, if he bought x piletines, then he also bought 6 + x riblje. Since he has total of 44 (38 + 6), we can write an equation: 38x = 44...(1) Now solve for x: x = 44 / 38...(2) Substitute the value from (2) into (1): 38x = 44 / 38...(3) Simplify: x = 12...(4) Therefore, Dylan bought 12 piletines.
Response:  If Amy had 20 more friends than Lily, that means Lily had 20 fewer friends than Amy. So, if Lily has x friends, then Amy has x + 20 friends. Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is: Lily + Amy = 50 + (x + 20) = 70. 
Response:  We know that one lubenica costs three times more than each paprika. So, if one paprika costs $15, then one lubenica will cost $3 x $15 = $45. Now we also know that naranča costs $5 less than each lubenica. Therefore, the price of one naranča is $45 - $5 = $40. Finally, Dillon wants to buy 4 lubenice, 20 paprike and 10 naranče. So, he will pay for 4 x $45 = $180 + 20 x $15 = $300 + 10 x $40 = $400 in total.
Response:  The number of patients per day is given as 500. Since each patient takes an average of 24 minutes to be seen, we can calculate the total time spent seeing patients in one day as follows: Time = Number of patients x Average time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes per day Now, let's find out how much doctors charge for their services. According to the question, doctors charge $150 per hour, so they earn: Earnings from doctors = Total time spent seeing patients x Hourly rate of doctors = 12,000 x $150 = $180,000 per day Finally, let's calculate how much the hospital charges for its services. As mentioned earlier, the hospital charges $200 per hour, so it earns: Earnings from hospital = Total time spent seeing patients x Hourly rate of hospital = 12,000 x $200 = $240,000 per day Therefore, the hospital earns $240,000 and the doctors earn $180,000 per day.
Response:  We know that 60 seasonal workers were hired to play villagers in Nissa's shopping center. Then, we are told that one-third of them (20) left after their children vomited. So, there are now 40 remaining villagers. Next, we learn that another 10 villagers left after their children hit them in the legs. Therefore, there are only 30 villagers left.
Response:  In May, Joe spent $500. In June, he spent $440 less than in May, so he spent $60 = $500 - $440 = $80 in June. Therefore, his total expenses for both months were $500 + $80 = $580.
"Response: 
Pam and Fred went to the carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, while Fred rode it four times. After that, each of them decided to ride the Ferris wheel twice. If each ride cost $6, how much did they spend that day?
Step-by-step calculation:
1. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, so she spent $6 x 2 = $12 on rides.
2. Fred rode the roller coaster four times, so he spent $6 x 4 = $24 on rides.
3. Both Pam and Fred rode the Ferris wheel twice, so they spent $6 x 2 = $12 in total.
Therefore, the total amount they spent at the carnival was $12 + $24 + $12 = $58."
Response:  On Monday, Walter walked 6 kilometers. If he walked 6 times more miles than on Monday, then on Tuesday he walked 6 x 6 = 36 kilometers. Therefore, his total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41 - 36 = 5 kilometers. So, in Tuesday, Walter walked 5 kilometers.
"Response:  If Tom has 4 car maintenance services per month and each service costs $15, then...
Step 1: Calculate the number of services per year
Tom has 4 services/month x 12 months/year = 48 services/year
Step 2: Multiply the number of services by their cost to get the total cost for the year
48 services/year x $15/service = $720/year
Therefore, Tom pays $720 for car maintenance services every year."
Response:  If Brian has 20 video games and he lost 5 before the comparison was made, then he has 15 video games left. According to the problem, Boby has 5 times more video games than Brian, so if Brian has 15 video games, Boby has 15 x 5 = 75 video games.
Response:  We know that there are 27 one-horned animals in the world and that one-third of them are located in Scotland. So, we can assume that there are 9 one-horned animals in Scotland (3/4 x 27). Since two-thirds of the Scottish one-horned animals are females, the number of female one-horned animals in Scotland is 14 (2/3 x 9). Therefore, there are 14 female one-horned animals in Scotland.
"Response: 
Rory has to pay for two sandwiches at $7.50 each, which means he will have to pay $15.00 for them. He also needs to pay for two bags of chips at $1.50 each, so that's another $3.00. Finally, he needs to pay for two cookies at $1.00 each, bringing the total cost to $19.00.
As for the delivery fee, there is a 20% discount, so Rory will only have to pay $15.60 ($19.00 x 0.8) for the delivery. Adding this to the total cost of his order brings the final price to $34.60."
"Response:  If Mark took 75 questions in the first test and finished it in 5 questions per minute (qpm), then he spent:

Time taken = Number of questions x QPM
= 75 x 5
= 375 minutes

Now, if he took another test with 100 questions at the same rate of 5 qpm, he would spend:

Time taken = Number of questions x QPM
= 100 x 5
= 500 minutes

So, Mark left 225 questions unanswered in the second test (500 - 375)."
Response:  If there are 22 red gumballs and four times that number of blue ones (i.e., 88 blue ones), then we can assume that for every three blue ones, there is one red one. So, if there are x blue ones, there are 3x red ones. Therefore, the total number of gumballs = 22 + 3x. Solving for x, we get x = 40. Thus, there are 40 red gumballs in addition to the 22 red ones already present.
Response:  The number of automatic cars is 12 out of 20 available cars for rent, which means that the percentage of automatic cars is: (12/20) x 100% = 60%. Therefore, 60% of the cars are automatic.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees than queen bees. So, if there are x worker bees, then there are 2x queen bees. Therefore, we can write an equation: 700 = x + (2x) = 1400. Solving for x, we get x = 700 / 7 = 100. So, there are 100 worker bees.
Response:  If Jordan plays video games for two hours every day and earns $10 per hour, then he will have earned $20 in one day (2 hours x $10/hour = $20). Since there are seven days in a week, Jordan will have earned $140 ($20 x 7 days) in total for that week.
"Response: 
John bought milk for $2, eggs for $3, candles for $3, cups for $3, and lighters for $4. So in total he spent:
$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15
Now let's calculate the tax amount:
Tax = $15 x 10% = $1.50
So John paid a total of $16 ($15 + $1.50) for all these items."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lucas will make from each client per week. Since he has 3 clients already and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, let's assume that he will have 8 clients in total (3 existing + 5 potential). Now, each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 package of cleaning supplies, which cost $2 and $5 respectively. So, his total revenue per week from all clients would be: Total Revenue = Number of Clients x Price per Client x Quantity of Products per Client Total Revenue = 8 x $2 x 2 = $64 per week Secondly, we need to subtract his total costs from his total revenue to find out his profit. His total costs are: Cost of Goods Sold = Number of Bottles of Bleach x Cost per Bottle + Number of Packages of Cleaning Supplies x Cost per Package Cost of Goods Sold = 8 x $2 = $16 + 8 x $5 = $40 = $64 Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs Profit = $64 - $64 = $0 So, Lucas will not make any profit this week.
Response:  We know that Džon has 10 hectares of land with 100 ananas per hectare. That means he has 1000 ananas (10 x 100 = 1000) in total. Since he can harvest every 3 months, he will have 4 harvests in one year (3 months x 4 = 12 months). So, he will collect 4000 ananas (1000 x 4 = 4000) in one year.
Response:  If John collects all the LEGO bricks in his room, he will have collected 500 + (3 x 500) = 2700 blocks. Since there are also 1/4 of the number of blocks as mentioned in the question, we need to find out what is that quarter part. So, 2700 / 4 = 675 blocks. Therefore, John will collect 675 blocks if he collects all the LEGO bricks in his room.
Response:  We know that 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours and half of those returned during the same time period (since we saw only half as many bees returning). So, the number of bees that returned = 30 / 2 = 15. Therefore, Debra saw 15 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
"Response:  We know that Brittany and her mom went to the museum together, and they paid $12 for adult admission and $10 for children's admission. Since Brittany is a child, she paid $10 for admission. So, the total amount of money spent by Brittany and her mom at the museum is:

$12 (adult admission) + $10 (child admission) = $22

Now, we are told that Brittany's mom gave the cashier $8 in change. So, the amount of money that the cashier received from Brittany's mom is:

$8 (change) = $22 - $8 = $14

Therefore, the answer to the question is $14."
"Response:  According to the question, Charlie has more friends on Facebook than Dorothy does. Specifically, Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook while Dorothy has 9 friends. So if Charlie has x number of friends on Facebook and Dorothy has y number of friends on Facebook, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the question: 
x = 12 (Charlie’s number of friends)
y = 9 (Dorothy’s number of friends)
Now we need to find out how many times x is greater than y. We know that x is greater than y because Charlie has more friends on Facebook than Dorothy does. To express this mathematically, we can use the following inequality: 
x > y
We also know from the question that Charlie has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. This means that for every friend that Dorothy has, Charlie has four friends. We can express this relationship using the following ratio: 
4 : 1 (one Dorothy friend = four Charlie friends)
Using these two pieces of information, we can now solve for x in terms of y: 
x = 4y + 9 (using the ratio 4 : 1)
Substituting y with 9 (the number of friends Dorothy has), we get: 
x = 4(9) + 9 = 36
So Charlie has 36 friends on Facebook. Now let's find out how many friends James has on Facebook. Based on the question, James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. Since Dorothy has 9 friends on Facebook, James must have at least 36 friends on Facebook (since he has four times as many friends as Dorothy). However, since Charlie has 36 friends on Facebook, it's possible that James has even more friends than that. In fact, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, he must have at least 160 friends on Facebook (since 4 x 9 = 36). Therefore, James has between 36 and 160 friends on Facebook."
Response:  We know that Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute and Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. To find out who will reach home first, we need to convert both speeds to the same unit of measurement (let's say meters). So, Steve's speed is 440 / 10 = 44 meters per minute, and Tim's speed is 264 / 10 = 26.4 meters per minute. Now, let's calculate how long it will take each person to reach home: For Steve: distance = 3 miles x 5,280 feet/mile = 16,040 feet time = distance / speed = 16,040 feet / 44 meters/minute = 360 minutes or 6 hours For Tim: distance = 3 km x 1,000 feet/km = 3,000 feet time = distance / speed = 3,000 feet / 26.4 meters/minute = 117 minutes or 1 hour and 57 minutes Based on these calculations, Tim will reach home before Steve. Therefore, the winner of the race is Tim.
"Response: 
Day 1: 5 people come to inflate both tires. Each tire costs $0.25 to fill. So, they paid $1.25 in total for Day 1.
Total amount earned that day = Number of people x Cost per person = 5 x $0.25 = $1.25
Now let's calculate how much each person earned: Total amount earned / Number of people = $1.25 / 5 = $0.25 per person."
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of candy, each package contains six pieces of candy inside. So, in total, he will get 6 x 10 = 60 pieces of candy. Each piece of candy costs $0.10, so the total cost for all 60 pieces is $60 / $0.10 = 600 dollars. Therefore, Carl will pay $600 to buy all the candy.
"Response:  We know that Dave bought a large box of pomfrits and ate 14 before the seagull took it from him. The seagull then ate half of what was left. Then three crows came and each one ate three pomfrits. Later, a rat took two-thirds of the remaining pomfrits. Finally, flies took the last one. So, when the rats took the last pomfrit, there were five left in total. Now, let's calculate how many pomfrits were in the original box: 

1. Dave ate 14 pomfrits, so there were 14 - 14 = 0 pomfrits left for the seagull.
2. The seagull ate half of what was left, which is 0 + (1/2) = 0.5 pomfrits.
3. Three crows ate 3 x 3 = 9 pomfrits.
4. A rat took 2/3 of the remaining pomfrits, which is 9 / 2 = 4.5 pomfrits.
5. Flies took the last pomfrit, leaving 5 - 1 = 4 pomfrits.

So, when the rats took the last pomfrit, there were 4 pomfrits in the original box."
"Response: 
Kimo has three hours each day from Monday to Friday. So he spends 3 x 5 = 15 hours per week in school.
In one semester, there are 16 weeks. Therefore, Kimo spends 15 x 16 = 240 hours in school per semester."
"Response:  If Bill has 300 rolls of bread, each roll is 10 cm long, so their total length is:

300 rolls x 10 cm/roll = 3000 cm

If he also has 120 chocolate croissants, each one is 15 cm long, so their total length is:

120 croissants x 15 cm/croissant = 1800 cm

And if he has 60 baguettes, each one is 60 cm long, so their total length is:

60 baguettes x 60 cm/baguette = 3600 cm

Adding all these lengths together gives us a total length of:

3000 + 1800 + 3600 = 9400 cm

So, if Bill stacks all his peached products end to end, they will be 9400 cm (or approximately 94 meters) long."
Response:  The zookeeper needs to buy bananas for all monkeys in the zoo every two months. If each monkey species requires a different number of bananas per month, we need to calculate how many bananas the zookeeper should buy for each species separately. Here are the calculations: Gorillas require 4 times as many bananas as chimpanzees (400/100 = 4), so the zookeeper should buy 4 \* 200 = 800 bananas for gorillas every two months. Similarly, the zookeeper should buy 3 \* 200 = 600 bananas for orangutans and 2 \* 200 = 400 bananas for mandrills. Therefore, the total number of bananas the zookeeper should buy is: 800 + 600 + 400 + 200 = 1,800 bananas. So, the zookeeper should buy 1,800 bananas every two months to ensure that all monkeys have enough food.
"Response: 
Blake ran backwards and forwards 15 times along the football field of length 100 yards. He covered a distance of x yards in total.
Kelly started running from one end of the field to the other once, covering a distance of y yards. She then decided not to run alongside Blake anymore and instead ran to the line that is 40 yards away from the starting point and back again, covering a distance of z yards. In total, she ran x + y + z yards.
Since Blake ran faster than Kelly, he covered more distance than her in the same time frame. Therefore, we can say that Blake's distance traveled is greater than Kelly's distance traveled.
So, let's find out how much greater:
Distance traveled by Blake = Total distance traveled by Blake - Distance traveled by Kelly
= x - (x + y)
= x - y
Therefore, the difference between the distances traveled by Blake and Kelly is equal to x - y."
Response:  Rafael bought 4 pencils for $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on pencils. He also bought two notebooks for $4 each, so he spent $8 on notebooks. Finally, he bought an eraser for $2, so he spent $10 in total. Therefore, Rafael spent $10 on all of his school supplies.
Response:  We know that there are initially 11 fish swimming in the lake. Then, we see that 6 of them have come out from under a bush and now we can only see their shadows. Finally, we find out that 2 more fish are hiding under a rock. So, the total number of fish that Finn can see in the lake is: 11 + 6 = 17.
Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), the water level in the tank was 5 meters deep. On Tuesday (utorak), the water level increased to 7 meters (since the tank had 2 meters more water). On Wednesday (srijeda), the water level decreased to 3/4 of what it was on Tuesday (so, 3/4 \* 7 = 5 meters). Therefore, the water level in the tank on Wednesday was 5 meters deep.
"Response:  We know that Anakin has caught 10 sea stars, 6 sea horses, and 3 clown fish. Loksin has caught 5 fewer sea stars than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clown fish than Anakin. So, if we subtract what Loksin has caught from what Anakin has caught, we get:

10 - 5 = 5 sea stars left for Loksin to catch
6 - 3 = 3 sea horses left for Loksin to catch
3 - 2 = 1 clown fish left for Loksin to catch
Therefore, Loksin has caught 5 sea stars, 3 sea horses, and 1 clown fish in total."
"Response:  The initial price of the jar is $20, and it increases by 20% every two months. So after two months, the new price will be:

$20 x (1 + 0.20) = $24

After four months, the price will be:

$24 x (1 + 0.20) = $28.80

And so on. To find out how much the jar will cost after 36 months, we can continue this calculation:

$28.80 x (1 + 0.20)^9 = $57.64

So, after 36 months, the jar will cost approximately $57.64."
Response:  The cost of one red car is $4, and three action figures cost $15. So, the total value of these items is $4 + $15 = $19. Since one doll costs $5, the total value of all the toys is $19 + ($5 x 3) = $27.
"Response:  If Jackie pays $90 for hiring an accountant and she can save $35 per hour working as a freelancer (3 hours), then her total savings would be:
$90 + ($35 x 3) = $275
So, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will have $275 more than if she were to do it herself."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has a budget of €1500 and she wants to save some money for buying clothes. So, let's assume that she spends around 80% of her budget on the computer (€1200). This means that she will have €300 left over for buying clothes. Now, let's calculate how much she can spend on each item based on the remaining amount:

* Computer: €1200 / €1500 = 0.8 (she can afford to spend up to 80% of her budget on the computer)
* Clothes: €300 - €1200 = €180 (she has €180 left over for buying clothes)

So, Elvira can buy clothes worth up to €180 with the remaining amount of her budget."
"Response:  If Sandra gives her neighbor 9 eggs each time she watches her daughter, and to make a Spanish flan, she needs 3 eggs, then...

Sandra has to give her neighbor 9 x 3 = 27 eggs in total.
So, Sandra has to be the egg donor 27 times for her to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Seth is twice as old as Brooke and in two years their combined age will be 56. So, if Seth is currently x years older than Brooke, then we can write an equation:
x + (2x) = 56...(1)
Now, we are told that Seth is 28 years old, so we can substitute this value for x into equation (1):
28 + (2 \* 28) = 56...(2)
Simplifying equation (2), we get:
56 = 54
So, Seth is 30 years old."
Response:  If Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel, and Ethel has $8, then we can say that Jimmy has $10 (since $2 + $8 = $10). So, Jimmy has $10.
"Response:  If he walks 30 kilometers per day, then in one week (7 days) he will have walked a total of:

30 km/day x 7 days = 210 km/week
So, during the week, Pancho can cover a distance of approximately 210 kilometers."
"Response:  The cost of each item is as follows:

* Šešir (cap): $25
* Jakna (jacket): $75 (3 times $25) = $87.50
* Pantaloni (pants): $60 (average of $25 and $87.50) = $75

Therefore, the total cost of one uniform is: $25 + $87.50 + $75 = $187.50."
Response:  We know that Jake sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so he sees 640 legs (8 x 8 = 64). Then we have 90 insects with 6 legs each, which gives us 540 legs (9 x 6 = 54). Finally, there are 3 rare mutated centipedes with 10 legs each, giving us an additional 30 legs (3 x 10 = 30). Therefore, in total, Jake sees 1470 legs (64 + 54 + 30 = 147).
"Response:  We know that:
Sally Two is three years older than Baba Crvena (Crvena).
Baba Crvena is twice as old as Sally Thirtytwo.
Sally Four is of the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
So we can write some equations based on these statements:
Let's call the age of Baba Crvena x. Then, since she is twice as old as Sally Thirtytwo, we have:
x = 2 \* Sally Thirtytwo's age
We also know that Sally Two is three years older than Baba Crvena, so we have:
x + 3 = Baba Crvena's age
Now we want to find out the total age of all four birds together. Since Sally Four is of the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, we can say that their combined age is equal to the sum of their individual ages:
Total Age = Sally Thirtytwo's age + Sally Four's age
Substituting the values from the previous equations, we get:
Total Age = 2 \* Sally Thirtytwo's age + Sally Four's age
Simplifying and solving for Total Age, we get:
Total Age = 10 + 4 = 14
Therefore, the total age of the four birds in Caboose is 14 years."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays each month for her student loan, credit card debt and mortgage. We can do this by multiplying the total amount of debt with the interest rate (which is not given in the problem). Then, we add all these amounts together to get the total monthly payment. Finally, if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, we multiply that number by 1.5 to find out how much she should pay each month. So, let's calculate it as follows: Student Loan: Total Debt = $40,000 x Interest Rate = 6% = $2,400 per year ($2,400 / 12 months) = $200 per month Credit Card Debt: Total Debt = $8,000 x Interest Rate = 18% = $1,440 per year ($1,440 / 12 months) = $120 per month Mortgage: Total Debt = $150,000 x Interest Rate = 6% = $9,000 per year ($9,000 / 12 months) = $750 per month Now, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will have to pay $750 + $200 + $120 = $1,070 per month. Therefore, the answer is $1,070.
"Response: 
1. Billy needs to peel and chop each carrot into roughly equal pieces so that he can prepare his family's big pot of coleslaw. There are 60 carrots in total, which means it will take him around 1 minute and 30 seconds (60 / 2 = 30) to peel and chop one carrot.
2. Since Billy only has about 5 seconds to cut each chopped carrot, he will need to work at an incredible speed to finish preparing all 60 carrots within the given time frame. In fact, if we assume that he works at maximum efficiency, he could potentially cut up to 40 carrots during this 5-second window (40 / 5 = 8). This means that he would have finished preparing half of the carrots after just 1 minute and 20 seconds (1 + 20 = 21)."
Response:  If they sold x gallons of lemonade and received $x/2 in profit per gallon, then their total profit from selling lemonade is $x(2)/2 = $x. Since they earned $25 in profit, we have $x = 25. So, they spent $3 per gallon on lemons.
Response:  We know that there are 240 Asian players in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese players is 160 (240 - 80). Now, we need to find out how many girls are in the Chinese team. According to the question, 60 boys are in the Chinese team, so the number of girls must be equal to the number of boys minus the number of boys in the Chinese team. Therefore, the number of girls in the Chinese team is 60 - 60 = 0. Hence, there are no girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends $1/4 of his income on rent, which is equal to $1500 per month (since he earns $6000 per month). Secondly, he spends $1/3 of his income on gas for his car, which is equal to $2000 per month (again, since he earns $6000 per month). Thirdly, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity organization, which is equal to $3000 per month ($6000 - $3000 = $3000). Fourthly, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife, respectively. So, the total amount of money he has left after all these expenses and donations is: $6000 - $1500 - $200 - $700 = $3900 per month.
Response:  We know that Rani has 10 crabs more than Monica and Monica has 4 crabs less than Bo. So, if Bo has 40 crabs, then Monica has 36 crabs (40 - 4 = 36) and Rani has 40 + 10 = 50 crabs. Therefore, together they have 36 + 36 + 50 = 122 crabs.
"Response:  If Lloyd earns $10 per hour for teaching mathematics and he worked for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week, then his total earnings for the two weeks are:

First week: 5 hours x $10/hour = $50
Second week: 8 hours x $10/hour = $80
Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 ($50 + $80) during the first two weeks."
Response:  The number of voters is given as 80 and the winner received 3/4 of their votes. So, the number of votes that the winner got = (80 x 3/4) = 56. Therefore, the number of votes that the loser got = 80 - 56 = 24.
Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white carnations and 200 more purple Calla lilies than white ones. So, if she ordered x white carnations, then she ordered 4x red roses. Also, since there are 5 times as many purple Calla lilies as white ones, if she ordered y purple Calla lilies, then she ordered 5y white Calla lilies. Now we have two equations: 4x + 200 = 17(4x + y) (since there are 17 hours until 17:00). Solving for x and y gives us x = 36 and y = 90. Therefore, Fred must deliver 36 x 4 = 144 red roses and 90 x 5 = 450 purple Calla lilies before 17:00 to satisfy Sandra's order.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Jean is two years older than Mark.
Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age two years ago.
So, if Jan is currently 30 years old, then when she was half her current age (i.e., 15 years ago), Mark was 25 years old (since he was 5 years older than half of her age).
Therefore, Jean is currently 30 + 2 = 32 years old."
"Response:  The first team has each member running 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. If we assume that they are all equally fast and have the same endurance, then their average speed for one lap (or 400 meters) is 55/4 = 13.75 meters per second. Now, let's calculate how long it would take each member of the second team to run 400 meters:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the first member, time = 400 meters / 60 seconds = 6.67 minutes (or 0.11 hours). For the second member, time = 400 meters / 55 seconds = 7.27 minutes (or 0.12 hours). And so on...

Now, let's compare the times:

Team 1: Time = 6.67 minutes (or 0.11 hours)
Team 2: Time = 7.27 minutes (or 0.12 hours) + 7.27 minutes (or 0.12 hours) + 7.27 minutes (or 0.12 hours) +... = 3 × 7.27 = 21.81 minutes (or 0.36 hours)

Therefore, Team 1 will finish the race about 21.81 minutes before Team 2. So, if the race were held now, Team 1 would win by approximately 21.81 - 6.67 = 15.14 minutes."
Response:  The probability of Jerry throwing a number greater than 3 is 4/6 = 2/3. Therefore, it is more likely that Jerry will throw a number greater than 3 than to throw two consecutive even numbers.
Response:  If Jenna and her mother collected apples from their farm together, then they must have collected half of them jointly (since Jenna alone picked up half). So, if Jenna's mother got 20 apples, then they must have collected altogether 40 apples (half of which is 20). Therefore, the correct answer is 40.
Response:  We know that there are 3 cages with rabbits in equal groups and each group is given 6 pieces of carrot. There are also 10 hutches with chickens that hold themselves and each hen gets 5 pieces of carrot. Additionally, there is a fence for guinea pigs where 20 pieces of carrot are distributed among them. Nowhere else in the problem do we use carrots. If there are 160 pieces of carrot distributed among the small rabbits, then how many pacmen does each cage have?  Therefore, the answer is 160/3 = 53 pacmen per cage.
Response:  The amount borrowed is $100 and the interest rate is 2% per month. After 3 months, the total amount owed will be: $100 x (1 + 0.02) = $104. So, after 3 months, Mandy would owe Benedict $104.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much it costed for each transfer from farm to storage and then calculate the total amount of money earned by the trader after selling all the batches at $30 per bushel. So, let's start with calculating the cost of transporting one batch from the farm to the storage: Cost = $2 x number of batches Transported = Total cost / Number of batches transported Now, we know that the trader sold 5 batches in total, so we can plug in the values: Cost = $2 x 5 = $10 Therefore, the total cost of transportation is $10. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned by the trader after selling all the batches at $30 per bushel: Total earnings = Number of batches sold x Selling price per batch - Total cost of transportation = 5 x $30 - $10 = $150 Finally, we can see that the trader earned $150 after selling all the batches.
Response:  The total cost of the trip is given as $20.25 + $4.50 = $24.75. Since they went to two different places and spent $33 each time, the total cost of the two trips is $33 x 2 = $66. So, if they split the costs equally among themselves, each person will have paid $66 / 3 = $22.
Response:  If John can collect 3 apples in three hours, that means he can collect 1 apple per hour. So, if it takes him one minute to collect 2 apples, then he can collect 60 apples in an hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Therefore, John can collect 60 x 3 = 180 apples in three hours.
Response:  If one patka needs 2.5 kg of insects per week to survive, then ten pataki would need 10 x 2.5 = 25 kg of insects per week. So, they would need 25 kg of insects every day.
"Response: 
Tom has 10 stumps every year and cuts down 2 trees each year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees have died, which means that 15 trees (30% x 50 = 15) have died. So, he has 35 trees left (50 - 15 = 35)."
Response:  On Friday morning (petek), Susie's neighbors placed 18 red plastic flamingos on her lawn. Then, in Saturday morning (subota), they took away one-third of these flamingos and painted them white. They then returned these newly painted white flamingos to Sue's lawn. Finally, on Sunday morning (nedelja), they added another 18 red plastic flamingos to the mix. So, at the end of Sunday morning, there were 36 flamingos (18 + 18) on Sue's lawn. Therefore, the number of red plastic flamingos outside is 36 - 18 = 18.
Response:  Since there are five different colors of pencils and Violeta wants to buy them all, she will need 5 x 5 = 25 pencils in total. Each pencil costs $2, so the total cost of the pencils is 25 x $2 = $50. Therefore, Violeta will have $50 - $20 = $30 left after buying the pencils.
"Response:  If one olovo costs $1.20 and one gumball costs $0.30, then 8 olovaka will cost:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60

So, 8 olovaka will cost $9.60."
"Response:  We have to distribute 200 funts of mrkva among 40 restaurants in a certain city. Since each restaurant will receive half a kilogram of mrkva, we need to calculate how many kilograms of mrkva won't be used:

Half a kilogram x 40 restaurants = 20 kilograms (not used)
Therefore, 80 kilograms of mrkva will be used (200 - 20 = 80)."
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in Soda. Among them, there are 8417 males and 9092 females. So, we have to find out how many children there are in total. To do this, we need to subtract the number of adults (males + females) from the total population. Therefore, the number of children is: Total population - (Number of males + Number of females). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total population = 23786 Children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092) = 23786 - 17508 = 6278 Decease!
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. Then she collected three times as many in the second month, so she had 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). In the third month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the second month, so she had 40 cards (60 - 20 = 40). Therefore, Elaine has 40 Pokémon cards.
"Response: 
Mark earns $5 per 100 recesses for publisher A and $10 per 100 recesses for publisher B. Since he edits 1000 recesses each week, we can calculate his total income as follows:
For Publisher A: Total income = Number of recesses x Price per recess = 1000 x $0.05 = $50
For Publisher B: Total income = Number of recesses x Price per recess = 1000 x $0.10 = $100
Total income in one week = Income from Publisher A + Income from Publisher B = $50 + $100 = $150
Since Mark works seven days a week, his total income in a seven-day period is: Total income = Total income in one week x Number of days worked = $150 x 7 = $1050
Therefore, Mark earns $1050 in a seven-day period."
Response:  If Baldur takes 5 canteens of water from the well every morning and 6 canteens every evening, then he takes a total of 5 + 6 = 11 canteens of water per day. Since each canteen contains 5 liters of water, Baldur takes a total of 11 x 5 = 55 liters of water per day.
Response:  If John earns $2000 per week and receives a bonus of $5000 once a year, he will receive his bonus on the first day of the year. So, in one year, John will have earned a total of $2000 x 52 = $104,000. Therefore, his annual bonus will be $5000 + (5% of $104,000) = $5200.
Response:  The farm has an area of 10 hectares and produces 5 tons of grapes per hectare per year. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total number of barrels produced as follows: Barrels = Tons x Yield per Ton = 50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels So, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.
"Response: 
Carlova omiljena hrana je sir. He had sandwiches with cheese every day this week for lunch and used 2 pieces of cheese per sandwich. He also made an omelette with cheese and eggs for breakfast three days in the week using one more piece of cheese than he did for the sandwiches. Additionally, he prepared a large macaroni dish with cheese that lasted him several evenings in the week and used 8 pieces of cheese in it. Therefore, the total number of pieces of cheese Carlo used is:

2 + 1 + 8 = 11
So, Carlo used 11 pieces of cheese in total."
Response:  We know that Janet had 22 green and 10 yellow olive oil bottles initially. Then she bought 6 boxes of blue olive oil and 2 boxes of red olive oil. Each box contains 9 blue or 6 red olive oil bottles. So, in total, Janet has 22 + 10 = 32 olive oil bottles now.
Response:  If Brinli has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, then her average score is (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 846 / 5 = 169. So, if she gets a score of 93 on the sixth test, her overall average score will be (169 + 93) / 6 = 262 / 6 = 43.33. Therefore, Brinli's score on the sixth test is 43.
"Response: 
Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week and each time he covered 25 kilometers. So in one week, he covered 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers.
Then, for four weeks, he rode his bike 4 x 7 = 28 days, covering 28 x 25 = 700 kilometers.
After that, he decided to ride only twice a week, but each time he covered 60 kilometers. For three weeks, he rode 3 x 2 = 6 times, covering 6 x 60 = 360 kilometers.
So, in total, Michael covered 125 + 700 + 360 = 1385 kilometers."
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate candies and 80 jam candies in Djоva's bag. Each chocolate candy weighs twice as much as each jam candy. Therefore, if each chocolate candy weighs 40 grams, then each jam candy must weigh 80/2 = 40 grams. So, Djоva's bag of sweets is 25 x 40 + 80 = 1700 grams heavy.
Response:  On Monday, she bought 4 cookies. On Tuesday, she bought three times more cookies than on Monday, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cookies. On Wednesday, she bought five times more cookies than on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 cookies. Therefore, after all three days, she bought a total of 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cookies.
Response:  We have to calculate how much each half of the tanjiri costs and then find out how many dollars are needed for buying all these halves. So we can write an equation like this: Half price = Total cost / Number of halves Cost per half = Total cost / Number of halves Now let's plug in the values from the problem: Half price = $1200 / 6000 = $0.2 (per half) Cost per half = $1200 / 6000 = $0.2 (per half) Since there are 50 halves in total, we need to buy, so we multiply the cost per half by the number of halves: Total cost = 50 x $0.2 = $10 Total cost = $10 Therefore, the total cost of buying one half of the tanjiri is $10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $10 already saved before she starts babysitting and working in the garden. Then, she spends $30 on the new jacket and $60 on the two pairs of shoes ($20 x 2). So, her total expenses are $90. Now, let's calculate how many times she needs to work in the garden to save enough money for the jacket and shoes: $$ \therefore \frac {90} {4} = 22.5 \text{ times } $$ Since you can't divide by 0.25, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 23 times. Therefore, Sara must work in the garden 23 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.
"Response:  We know that every day Džeri collects 42 eggs from both white and red chickens. So, in one week (7 days), she collects:

42 x 7 = 294 eggs

Now, let's assume there are x red chickens laying eggs. Since we know that each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, they lay:

x x 3 = 93 eggs per day

So, in one week, the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is:

93 x 7 = 641 eggs

Since there are more than two times as many white chickens as red chickens, there must be at least twice as many eggs laid by white chickens. Therefore, the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is:

2 x 5 = 10 eggs per day

So, in one week, the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is:

10 x 7 = 70 eggs

Now, let's add up all the eggs collected by Džeri in one week:

294 + 641 + 70 = 985 eggs

Therefore, there are 985 eggs in total. As there are more than two times as many white chickens as red chickens, there must be at least twice as many red chickens as white chickens. So, if there are x red chickens, then there are 2x white chickens."
Response:  We know that Gary walks along the edge of the local park, which is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide. If he walks at a speed of 5 km/h, we can calculate how many hours he spends walking as follows: Time = Distance / Speed Where distance is the length of the park in meters (since we are given the length in miles), and speed is the speed at which Gary walks in kilometers per hour (since we are given the speed in km/h). The length of the park in meters is: Length of park = 1.5 miles x 0.00160934 miles/meter = 0.24 miles x 0.001 meters/mile = 0.0024 meters Now, let's convert the speed from km/h to m/h: Speed = 5 km/h x 0.621371 miles/km = 3.1078 m/h Since time is equal to distance divided by speed, we can plug in these values to solve for time: Time = 0.0024 meters / 3.1078 m/h = 0.000075 hours This means that Gary spends approximately 0.000075 hours or 4 minutes and 30 seconds walking around the edge of the local park.
Response:  On day one, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. If there were 50 more customers on the second day than on the first day, that means he counted 150 customers on the second day (100 + 50 = 150). Therefore, the number of customers on the third day was 200 (500 - 300 = 200).
Response:  The total amount of water in both basins before 4 minutes was twice as much as the small basin had initially (so 8 gallons). After 4 minutes, the large basin lost 2 gallons, and the small basin gained 1 gallon, so now they have 7 gallons each. Therefore, the small basin has 7 + 7 = 14 gallons of water now.
"Response:  If Lori wants to buy shoes that cost $320 and a matching belt that costs $32, she needs to work for:

$8/hour x number of hours worked = amount needed to save

To calculate the number of hours she needs to work, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:

Amount needed to save = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
= $320 + $32
= $352

So, Lori needs to work for:

Number of hours worked = Amount needed to save / $8/hour
= $352 / $8
= 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt."
Response:  If Janet borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount, then she will have to pay $2200 ($2000 + $200). If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance after that period would be: $2200 - (165 x 12) = $1735. So, Janet's remaining balance is $1735.
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and each rose has 7 days more than a rose. So, if we multiply the number of roses with the difference between a rose and a day, we will get the total number of flowers in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 28 (4 x 7).
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet is twice as old as Zack. So we can write:
Adrian = 3Harriet
Harriet = 2Zack
Now we want to find out what the average age of the group will be after three years have passed. So let's substitute these equations into each other:
Average age = (Adrian + Harriet + Zack) / 3
= (3Harriet + Harriet + Zack) / 3
= (4Harriet + Zack) / 3
= 5Harriet / 3 + Zack / 3
= 16 + Zack / 3
So the average age of the group after three years will be 16 + Zack's age / 3."
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Juri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which means he scored 68 + (10/2) = 94 points. Additionally, we know that Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Finally, we are asked how many points Jojo scored. Since Jojo did not participate in the game, he did not score any points, so the answer is 0. Therefore, the final scores are: Naomi - 68, Juri - 94, Brianna - 85, and Jojo - 0.
"Response:  According to the question, Carmen took 10 minutes to finish the crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to finish the Sudoku puzzle. Since she solved 3 crosswords and 8 Sudokus during her weekend, we can calculate how much time she spent on each puzzle as follows:
Time spent on crosswords = Total time / Number of crosswords solved = 10 minutes / 3 = 3.33 minutes per crossword
Time spent on Sudokus = Total time / Number of Sudokus solved = 5 minutes / 8 = 0.625 minutes per Sudoku
Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 3.33 + 0.625 = 4 minutes and 9 seconds playing these two types of puzzles during her weekend."
Response:  The tank has 120 liters of water and Celina uses 90 liters from the reservoir to irrigate her small garden. This means that there are now 30 liters (120 - 90) left in the tank. If she can collect double the amount of rainwater than what is left in the tank, then she can collect 60 liters (30 x 2 = 60) of rainwater. So, there are 60 liters of water left in the reservoir.
Response:  If Andy has 90 geraniums and 40 petunias less than geraniums, then he has 50 petunias in total. So, the total number of flowers that Andy planted is: 90 + 50 = 140.
Response:  In year one, the company spends $15,000 on advertising. Since it then spends only half of that amount in year two (i.e., $5,000), we can calculate the total amount spent over both years as follows: Total = Year 1 + (Year 2 x Spending ratio) Total = $15,000 + ($5,000 x 2/3) Total = $15,000 + $3,333 Total = $18,333 So, the company has spent a total of $18,333 on advertising over the two years.
"Response:  If Carlos pays $30 for each hour he uses the canoe and Benji pays $18 for each hour he uses the raft, then their total cost will be:
Carlos: 3 x $30 = $90
Benji: 5 x $18 = $90
Total: $90 + $90 = $180
Therefore, they will pay a combined total of $180 for their rentals."
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half that time (or 3 days) to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car, then it will take an additional 3 days to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car. Therefore, the total number of days required for the trip is 9 days.
Response:  We know that initially, James had 40 water-type cards out of his total deck of 90 cards. After losing 8 water-type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards left. Then, he buys 14 new cards, which means he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water-type cards in total. So, the probability of randomly drawn card being a water-type card is: $ \frac{46}{90} = 0.505$ or approximately 50.5%.
Response:  First, he ordered the basic burrito for $6.50. Then, he added extra meat ($2), extra cheese ($1), avocado ($1), and two tortillas ($0.25) to make his total cost $9.75. Finally, he upgraded to a larger size for an additional $3, which brings the new total cost to $12.75. So, he still owes $12.75 - $9.75 = $3.
Response:  If Kalinda can do 4 pieces in one minute and her mother can do half of that (which is 2 pieces), then they will need 8 minutes to complete 360 pieces. So, it will take them 8/60 = 133 seconds or approximately 2 minutes and 20 seconds to finish the puzzle.
Response:  After two months, Ashlyn found that 30% of the lettuce was ready to be harvested, so she took 30 out of 120 (the total number of lettuce) home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining lettuce (75%) was ready to be harvested, so she collected another 75 from the farm. Therefore, there were initially 60 lettuce left at the farm (120 - 30 = 60), and after two weeks, there were 45 lettuce left (60 - 30 = 45). So, the answer is 45.
"Response:  The total number of cars that Mark is buying is 12. Each car costs $20,000, so the total cost of all the cars is:

$20,000 x 12 = $240,000

Mark pays 10% tax on each car, which means he pays:

$20,000 x 0.10 = $2,000 per car

So, the total amount of taxes paid by Mark is:

$2,000 x 12 = $24,000

Additionally, there is a registration fee of $1,000 for each car. So, the total amount that Mark pays for all the cars is:

$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 (registration fees) = $376,000

Therefore, Mark pays a total of $376,000 for all the cars."
Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Kajli collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she collected 5 + 20 = 25 shells in total. On Tuesday (utorak), Kajli collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collected 2 \* 25 = 50 shells in total. Therefore, Kajli collected 50 shells in utorak.
Response:  If there were 50 flies in the garden and Dax found half as many bees as flies, then there are 50 / 2 = 25 bees in the garden. Since Dax also found twice as many worms as bees, there are 25 + (2 x 25) = 75 worms in the garden. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 50 + 75 = 125 insects.
Response:  We know that 36 penguins are playing in the snow. Of those, one-third (12) jump and swim in the ocean. Another third (12) enter the cave to have dinner. So, there are only 12 penguins left to bask in the sun.
Response:  If Steve eats twice as much paraffin as his girlfriend and he eats 6 days a week, then he eats 2 x 6 = 12 paraffins per week. Since one tree can produce three paraffins per day, Steve needs 12 / 3 = 4 trees to satisfy his demand for paraffin. Therefore, he needs 4 trees.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend will get 4 slices of pizza. Since the pizzas are sold in 8-piece portions, we need to buy 20 x 4 = 80 pieces of pizza. So, John needs to order 80 pizzas.
Response:  If he mixes 1/5 of the ink from each of the 5 empty inkwells into one full inkwell, then he will have 1/5 + 1/5 +... + 1/5 = 5/5 = 1 full inkwell left over after mixing all the ink. So if he starts with 25 inkwells and uses them to make new ink, he will end up with 25 - 1 = 24 inkwells remaining.
Response:  If Jon initially invested $20 in his hot dog cart and then added another $10, he had a total of $30 to invest. After one year, if the amount tripled, Jon would have $90. Therefore, after one year, Jon had $90.
"Response:  The ages of the three girls are given as follows:
Meri - 2 years younger than Joan = Joan's age - 2 = 18 years old (Joan is 5 years older than Jessie)
Jessie - 5 years older than Džeesa = Džeesa's age + 5 = 20 years old
Džeesa - 2 years younger than Joana = Joan's age - 2 = 18 years old
So, the total age of the three girls is:
Joan - 20 years old
Jessie - 20 years old
Džeesa - 18 years old
Therefore, the total age of the three girls is 68 years old."
"Response:  If 30% of students left through entrance A, then there are 700 students remaining (since 30% of 1000 is 300). Now, we need to find out how many of these 700 students left through entrances B and C combined. Since 3/5 of the remaining students left through entrance B, the number of students who left through entrance B is 210 (since 3/5 of 700 is 210). Therefore, the number of students who left through entrance C is:

Broj učenika koji su izašli kroz izlaz C = Broj učenika koji nisu ostali - Broj učenika koji su otišli kroz izlaz B
= 700 - 210
= 490

So, 490 students left through entrance C."
Response:  We know that James has more sweets than Robert and that John has twice as many buns as Robert. So, if John has 54 sweets, then he must have at least 2 x 54 = 108 sweets in total (since he already had 54). Therefore, John has 108 - 54 = 54 sweets more than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they will have three books to read. So, if they both read each other's books as well as their own, they will have a total of 3 + 2 = 5 books left to read at the end.
"Response: 
Mike has been writing letters to five friends once a week for 7 weeks. Each letter is 5 pages long, and he takes 6 minutes to write each page. Therefore, in one week, Mike spends 6 x 5 = 30 minutes writing letters. In 7 weeks, that's 30 x 7 = 210 minutes or 3 hours and 30 minutes. So, Mike spends 3 hours and 30 minutes per week writing letters."
Response:  If Jason has a plan of 1000 minutes per month and he spends 15 minutes each day talking to his boss, then in one month he will have spent 1000 x 30 = 30,000 minutes talking to his boss. Since this month he had an additional 300 minutes of calls with other people, that means he spent 30,000 + 300 = 30,300 minutes talking to others this month. So, Jason spent 30,300 minutes talking to both his boss and other people this month.
"Response: 
Ginger gave Griffin 10 pomfrits (since he had 24 to start with).
Kyle took 5 pomfrits from Griffin.
Billy took twice as many pomfrits as Kyle (so he took 10 pomfrits).
Griffin lost 3 pomfrits due to Colby taking them away.
So, at the end of all these events, Griffin had 27 pomfrits.
Now, let's calculate how many pomfrits Ginger gave him:
Ginger gave Griffin 10 pomfrits initially + 10 (twice as much as Kyle) - 3 (lost to Colby) = 27 pomfrits.
Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 27 pomfrits in total."
Response:  In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails. In the second aquarium, there are 32 snails, which is twice as many as in the first aquarium. So, if we divide the number of snails in the second aquarium by 2, we get the number of snails in the first aquarium: 32 / 2 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 snails in each aquarium.
"Response: 
Jeansova šminkerka charges $250 per hour. Since she works for 6 hours every day (since the movie lasts for 5 weeks), her daily income is:
$250 x 6 = $1,500 per day
Since she works 4 days a week, her total weekly income is:
$1,500 x 4 = $6,000 per week
Now, let's calculate how much Jean pays in total:
Weekly income of shminkerka = $6,000
Percentage discount given to Jean = 10%
Discount amount = $6,000 x 10% = $600
Total amount paid by Jean = $6,000 - $600 = $5,400
Therefore, Jean pays $5,400 in total."
Response:  We know that Isabella spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on presents for her sister's birthday, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on party favors for guests. She shared the cost with both parents. So, we can write an equation: Total Cost = Ingredients + Presents + Decorations + Invitations + Party Favors. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Total Cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 =? To find out how much each parent paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3 (the number of people involved). So, if we divide $120 by 3, we get $40 per person. Therefore, Isabella's mother paid $40, and Isabella's father paid $40 as well.
Response:  The total weight of the luk is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Since each kilogram costs $1.50, then the cost of all the luk is 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300. So, the cook spent $300.
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. Then, on Tuesday, she ate double the number of cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 5 = 10 more cookies. Therefore, in total, Sue ate 30 cookies (20 + 10). Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate a total of 6000 calories (30 x 200) from cookies. Now, we need to subtract the number of calories that her sister ate. According to the problem, her sister ate 5 cookies and each cookie has 200 calories, so her sister ate a total of 5 x 200 = 1000 calories. So, the difference between the number of calories that Sue ate and her sister is 6000 - 1000 = 5000 calories.
