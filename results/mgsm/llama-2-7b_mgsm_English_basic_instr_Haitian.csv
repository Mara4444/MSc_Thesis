"Response:  The total time taken to download the file will be:
Time = Distance / Speed
Distance = Total size of the file (in bytes)
Speed = Download speed in bytes per minute
In this case, the distance is 200 GB, and the speed is 2 GB/minute. So, we can calculate the time as follows:
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes
Therefore, it will take Carla approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes to download the 200 GB file if Windows forces her to restart the download after 40% completion."

Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles and the time taken so far is 2 hours (or 2 x 60 minutes). So, if Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a rate of: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken = 12 miles / 2 hours = 6 miles per hour.

We know that the two pairs of heels cost $33 + $66 = $99, which leaves $51 remaining for the boots. Since the boots cost $70, we can see that they take up the entire remaining amount ($51). Therefore, the boots cost $70."

The distance from Polly to the dragon is 1000 feet, which means that if Polly stands any closer than 700 feet (1000 - 300 = 700) away from the dragon, it will be within the reach of its flames. Therefore, the maximum distance from Polly to the dragon that she can safely stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone is 700 feet."
Response:  The guests took 7 pieces of pie.
"Response:  To determine how many grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the number of calories in a serving, we need to calculate the remaining calories you have left for the day.

Assuming you have already consumed 1800 calories, that means you have 400 calories left (2000 - 1800 = 400). Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag of chips, each serving contains 40 calories (300g / 5 servings = 60 calories per serving x 5 servings = 240 calories per bag).
Therefore, you can eat up to 400/240 = 1.67 bags of chips today, which translates to approximately 79 grams of chips (1.67 bags x 60 calories per bag = 99.2 calories). So, you still have some wiggle room within your daily calorie limit to enjoy those crispy snacks!"

Response:  Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour during the time period of 1 to 4 PM. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate. Since he traveled 20 miles in the forward direction, and his rate was 10 miles per hour, it will take him half that time (or 5 hours) to cover the same distance going backwards at a rate of 6 miles per hour. Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to get back.
"Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we must divide the total weight of the items in his book bag by the weight of a single item (in this case, a comic book or a toy). Let's do that:
Total weight of items = 15 pounds
Weight of a comic book = 1/4 pound
Weight of a toy = 1/2 pound
Now, let's calculate the number of toys Uriah needs to remove:
Number of toys = Total weight of items / Weight of a toy
= 15 pounds / 1/2 pound
= 30 toys
Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 30 toys from his book bag to reduce its weight by 15 pounds."

"Response: 25 boxes.
Explanation: To find out how many boxes can fit on the truck without exceeding the weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the truck (driver + empty truck) from the total weight limit of the bridge. Since the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is $3755$, and the weight limit of the bridge is $5000$, we have:

$5000 - 3755 = 1245$

So, the maximum number of boxes that can fit on the truck is:

$1245 / 15 = 83$

Therefore, the answer is $25$ boxes."

Initial payment = $140 x (first half of the year) = $700
Subsequent payments = $140 x (second half of the year) = $70
Total amount paid = Initial payment + Subsequent payments = $700 + $70 = $770
Therefore, by the end of the year, Aleena has paid a total of $770 for the streaming service."
Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needs to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. This means that her current tank size is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons. Since there are 3600 feet in a mile, we can calculate the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas as follows: Distance = Total volume of gas / Number of miles driven = 8 gallons / 100 miles = 80 miles. Therefore, Sophia can drive 80 miles on a single tank of gas.

"Response:  To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we can use the information provided in the problem. We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed is:

20 x 10 = 200 pounds (for the adults) + 5 x 5 = 25 pounds (for the children) = 225 pounds of potato salad

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure that everyone has enough to eat."

"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she sold and then subtract that amount from the total revenue she received. Let's do this step by step:

Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x $10 = $100
Total cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 x $16 = $80
Total cost of all lumber sold = $100 + $80 = $180
Total revenue from selling all lumber =?

Since Sasha sold all of her leftover lumber, her total revenue is equal to the total value of all the lumber she sold. In this case, it's $180 (the total cost of all the lumber) plus any additional money she made from selling the lumber above its cost. So, Sasha's profit from selling all of her leftover lumber is:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0

Therefore, Sasha doesn't make any profit from selling all of her leftover lumber."
"Response:  Katy uses 95 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

Explanation:
Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Number of teaspoons of sugar = 120
* Ratio of sugar to water = 7:13
* Total amount of water used =? (since we are asked for the number of cups)

Now, let's use the ratio to find out how many cups of water were used:

Number of cups of water = 120 / 7 = 17 cups

Now that we know the number of cups of water used, we can find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used:

Teaspoonfuls of sugar = Number of cups of water x Sugar-to-water ratio
= 17 cups x 7/13 = 95 teaspoonfuls

Therefore, Katy used 95 teaspoonfuls of sugar."

"Response:  The total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is $85000. To find this answer we must use the information given in the problem that Adrien's salary is currently 40% higher than it was four years ago, which means that if his current salary is A, then his salary four years ago was (1/2)A. Also, since Adrien's salary has increased by a factor of 1.2, his new salary is 1.2(A). Therefore, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
$85000 = ($1.2A + $40000)/2
Solving for A, we get:
A = $62500
So, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is $85000 / 2 = $42500 each."

Explanation: To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the number of questions he answered in both tests from the total number of questions in each test. For the first test, Mark answered 75/5 = 15 questions per hour, so it took him 8 hours to answer 8 x 15 = 120 questions. Therefore, he left 75 - 120 = 45 questions incomplete. For the second test, Mark answered 100/5 = 20 questions per hour, so it took him 6 hours to answer 6 x 20 = 120 questions. Therefore, he left 100 - 120 = 20 questions incomplete."

His total income per week is $92, and his total expenses are $10 (2 x $2 = $4 for each of the 5 clients + $5 x 5 = $25 for the other 5 clients). So, his profit each week is: $92 - $10 - $25 = $57. Therefore, Lucas will make a profit of $57 each week.

Response:  To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance between the school and Steve's house is 3 miles (1.6 km). The speed of Steve's bike is 440 feet per minute, which is equal to 5760 feet per hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, we can plug these values into the formula: Time = Distance / Speed = 1.6 km / 5760 ft/h = 0.29 hours or 18 minutes. Therefore, the winner will arrive at their house after 18 minutes.

Response:  After 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost $48.  To find this answer, we need to use the formula for percentage increase: (new price / old price) x 100%. In this case, the new price is $48, and the old price is $20, so we multiply $48 by 150% to get $67. Then, divide $67 by 2 to find the final price after 36 months, which is $33.50. Therefore, after 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost $48.

"Response:  To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she owes for each debt and then multiply it by the percentage increase over the minimum payment. Let's do that for each debt:

1. Student Loans: Total Amount Owed = $300 x 12 = $3600
Increased Payment = $3600 x 50% = $1800
Total Annual Payment = $1800 + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $2500
2. Credit Card: Total Amount Owed = $200 x 12 = $2400
Increased Payment = $2400 x 50% = $1200
Total Annual Payment = $1200 + $200 (student loans) + $500 (mortgage) = $2700
3. Mortgage: Total Amount Owed = $500 x 12 = $6000
Increased Payment = $6000 x 50% = $3000
Total Annual Payment = $3000 + $1200 (credit card) + $2400 (student loans) = $6600
Therefore, Jessica pays a total of $6600 per year on her debts if she increases her payments by 50% above the minimum amounts."
Response:  Billy will need approximately 10 minutes to prep all 60 potatoes (60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes).
Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that they sold 20 glasses of lemonade per gallon and that each glass cost $0.50. So, if they sold a total of 100 glasses (which is equal to 5 gallons), then they sold 5 x 20 = 100 glasses. Since each glass cost $0.50, Juan and Carlos spent $100 / $0.50 = $200 on lemons. Therefore, they spent $200 on lemons.

"Response:  The probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on the next roll is 4/6 or approximately 67%. To calculate this, we can use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). In this case, A is ""Jerry rolls a number greater than 3"" and B is ""Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row."" Since there are only three even numbers less than 3 (2, 4, and 6), the intersection of A and B is {2, 4, 6}, which has size 3 out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) = 3/6 or approximately 50%. Finally, P(B) = 6/6 or 1, since the event ""Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row"" occurs regardless of what Jerry rolls on his next turn. So, P(A|B) = 50%."

"Response:  Mandy owes Benedict $100 with a monthly interest rate of 2%. After 3 months, the amount due from Mandy to Benedict is calculated as follows:

Amount Due = Principal Amount x Interest Rate x Time Period
= $100 x 2% x 3/12
= $15

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $115 ($100 principal amount + $15 interest)."
"Response:  The trader sold 13 bags of wheat. To find out why, let's use the information given in the problem:

* The trader bought the bags of wheat from the farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. So if he bought x bags, he paid $x for them.
* It cost $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, so the total cost of transporting all the bags is $2x.
* The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each. So the total revenue from selling all the bags is $30x.
* Since the trader made a profit of $400, we can set up the equation:

$30x - $2x = $400

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$28x = $400

Dividing both sides by $28, we get:

x = 13

So the trader sold 13 bags of wheat."

"Response:  To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so if Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence, Publisher B pays $0.10 per sentence. We also know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week for both publishers. So, the total amount of money Mark makes from editing sentences each week is:
$0.05 x 500 sentences = $25.00 (for Publisher A) + $0.10 x 500 sentences = $50.00 (for Publisher B) = $75.00 per week
Therefore, Mark makes $75.00 per week."

"Response:  John made $104,000 that year.
Explanation:
John gets paid bi-weekly, so he gets paid twice a month. Since the award is given once a year, he received it on January 1st. Let's assume his pay period is from Monday to Sunday. So, he worked for 52 weeks in a year (ignoring leap years).

Weekly income = $2000/week x 52 weeks/year = $104,000/year"

"Response:  Sara must mow the lawn 8 times in order to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. Here is how we can calculate this:

* First, let's add up all the money that Sara will make from babysitting: $5 x 4 = $20.
* Next, let's subtract the $20 that Sara already has saved: $20 - $10 = $10.
* Now, let's divide the remaining amount by the cost of the jacket ($30): $10 / $30 = 0.33 or 33%. This means that Sara needs to mow the lawn 33 times to save enough money for the jacket.
* Finally, let's multiply the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn by the cost of one mowing: 33 x $4 = $132. This is how much money Sara needs to mow the lawn in total in order to afford the jacket and shoes.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 8 times (not including the initial $10 she already had) in order to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."

"Response:  The remaining balance after 12 months will be $1375.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount that Janeth needs to pay back is $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2200.
If Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance at the end of the 12th month will be:
Remaining Balance = Total Amount - Monthly Payments
= $2200 - ($165 x 12)
= $1375
Therefore, the answer is B: $1375."

Response:  If it takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to finish a sudoku puzzle, then she spent 10 + 5 = 15 minutes playing crossword puzzles over the weekend.  And if she solved 3 crossword puzzles, she spent 3 x 15 = 45 minutes on those puzzles.  Similarly, if she solved 8 sudoku puzzles, she spent 8 x 5 = 40 minutes on those puzzles.  So in total, Carmen spent 45 + 40 = 85 minutes playing crossword and sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

"Response: 270

Explanation:
Let's first find the total number of students who left the building. We know that 30% of them went out through exit A, so the number of students who left through exit A is 30% of 1000 = 300.
Now, we need to find the remaining students who did not go out through exit A. There are 700 students left (1000 - 300).
Then, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, the number of students who went out through exit B is 3/5 x 700 = 490.
Finally, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit C. Since the rest of the students went out through exit C, the number of students who went out through exit C is 1000 - 300 - 490 = 270.
Therefore, the answer is 270 students went out through exit C."

Response: 18.
"Response: 16.

Explanation:
Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can write:

Number of snails in second aquarium = 2x

We know that there are 4 snails in the first aquarium and 32 snails in the second aquarium, so we can set up the equation:

4 + 32 = 2(x)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 16

So there are 16 fish in each aquarium."

Response:  On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 4 x 9 = 36 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 9 = 18 cookies. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, for a total of 18 + 13 = 31 cookies. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 31 x 200 = 6,200 calories more than her sister.
