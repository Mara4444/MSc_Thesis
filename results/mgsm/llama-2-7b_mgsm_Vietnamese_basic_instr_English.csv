Explanation:
The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60. In the second month, there are three times as many downloads, or 180 (60 x 3 = 180). Finally, in the third month, there are 30% fewer downloads than in the second month, which means there are 120 downloads in the third month (180 - 30 = 120). Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 120 = 360."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, it will take 4 years for Carlos to break even on his investment of $90. This is calculated by subtracting the cost of planting and maintaining the tree ($3 per year x 4 years) from the total revenue generated by the tree over those 4 years ($1.5 per quintal x 7 quints per year x 4 years).

"Response:  $6,375$
Explanation:
The total value of the jewelry is $5,000, and the expected percentage increase in the jewelry market is 2.5%. Therefore, the predicted value of the jewelry after one month is:

$5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,250$

Similarly, the total value of the electronics is $8,000, and the expected percentage increase in the electronics market is 1.2%. Therefore, the predicted value of the electronics after one month is:

$8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,400$

Now, we need to compare these two values to determine which investment will provide higher returns at the end of the month. The higher value represents the better investment choice. In this case, the predicted value of the jewelry investment ($5,250) is lower than the predicted value of the electronics investment ($8,400). Therefore, based on the information provided, it would be more profitable for the businessman to invest in electronics rather than jewelry.

So, the answer is $8,400$."

"Response:  $48,000

Explanation:
Jill works as a teacher for 35 hours per week and as a dance instructor for 15 hours per week. If she works 50 weeks per year, her total work hours per year is:

Teaching hours/week x Number of weeks worked = Total teaching hours/year
35 hours/week x 50 weeks = 1750 hours/year

Dance instruction hours/week x Number of weeks worked = Total dance instruction hours/year
15 hours/week x 50 weeks = 750 hours/year

Total work hours/year = Teaching hours + Dance instruction hours
1750 hours + 750 hours = 2500 hours/year

Since Jill earns $20/hour as a teacher and $30/hour as a dance instructor, her annual salary can be calculated as follows:

Annual salary (teacher) = Total teaching hours x Hourly wage
$20/hour x 2500 hours = $50,000

Annual salary (dance instructor) = Total dance instruction hours x Hourly wage
$30/hour x 750 hours = $22,500

Total annual salary = Annual salary (teacher) + Annual salary (dance instructor)
$50,000 + $22,500 = $72,500

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $72,500."

* iPhone of Ben is twice as old as iPhone of Suzy.
* iPhone of Suzy is one year old.

Using these pieces of information, we can deduce that:

Brandon's iPhone = 4 x Ben's iPhone
Ben's iPhone = 2 x Suzy's iPhone
Suzy's iPhone = 1 year old

Brandon's iPhone = 4 x (2 x Suzy's iPhone)
= 4 x (2 x 1)
= 8 years old

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is 8 years."

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that the maximum weight of the bridge is 5000 pounds (or 2268 kg). We also know that the driver and the truck together weigh 3755 pounds (or 1694 kg), leaving 1245 pounds (or 564 kg) for the cargo. Since each box weighs 15 pounds (or 6.8 kg), the total number of boxes that can be carried by the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is:

Number of boxes = Total available weight - Driver/truck weight
= 564 kg - 1694 kg
= 2000 kg / 15 kg/box
= 133 boxes
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 133."

"Response: 320 miles
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Sophia has already traveled 160 kilometers (km) since she last filled up her gas tank, which is equivalent to 99.5 miles based on the conversion rate of 1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles. Therefore, if Sophia fills up her gas tank with an additional 4 gallons of fuel, she will be able to travel an additional distance of 4 / 3.7854 = 1.07 miles per gallon. Since Sophia wants to know how many miles she can drive with one full tank of gas, we can calculate this by dividing the total capacity of her gas tank (12 gallons) by the number of miles she can drive with one full tank (1.07 miles/gallon). This gives us a total driving distance of 12 / 1.07 = 112.6 miles, or approximately 320 miles."

Explanation:
Let's assume that before changing his diet, Gerald's running speed was x meters per second (m/s). After improving his diet, his running speed increased by 10%, so his new running speed is (x + 10%) m/s.
Since Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds, we know that Lee's running speed is (400 / 38) = 10.47 m/s.
Now, let's find out how fast Gerald can run 400 meters after improving his diet:
Gerald's new running speed = (x + 10%) m/s
 distance = 400 meters
time =?
We want to find the time it takes for Gerald to run 400 meters after improving his diet, so we set up the following equation:
(distance / speed) = (time / speed)
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
(400 / (x + 10%)) = (38 / 10.47)
Solving for x, we get:
x + 10% = 56.7
Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters in approximately 56.7 seconds after improving his diet."

Explanation:
The number of containers that were brought into the port on the second day can be calculated as follows:
Let X be the total number of containers brought into the port on the second day.
Since each container can hold 5 cars, we have:
X = Number of containers brought in + Number of containers brought in yesterday
We know that 20 containers were brought in yesterday, so:
X = 20 + (Number of containers brought in today)
We are given that the total number of cars at the port is 30. Therefore, the number of containers brought in today is:
X = 30 / 5 = 6
So, the number of containers brought into the port on the second day is 6.
Therefore, the answer is 140."

Explanation: Let's analyze each of the three boxes:
Box 1 (500 pieces): Since it has 500 pieces, we can say that it contains 500 / 3 = 166.67 khối of Legos.
Box 2 (3 x 500 pieces): As the box contains 3 times as many pieces as Box 1, we can calculate its volume as follows: 3 x 166.67 = 499.91 khối.
Box 3 (1/4 số lượng mảnh): Since this box contains 1/4 of the total number of pieces, we can calculate its volume as follows: 500 / 4 = 125 khối.
Now, let's add up the volumes of all three boxes to get the total number of khối of Legos that Johnny will have if he can collect them all: 166.67 + 499.91 + 125 = 2769.83 khối. Therefore, the answer is 2769.83 khối."

Therefore, Anakin scored an additional 6 points for the horseshoe crabs he caught. Finally, since Locsin caught more sea snails (more than 2) than Anakin did, Locsin scored an additional 2 points for those she caught. In total, then, Anakin scored 10 + 6 = 16 points, while Locsin scored 5 + 2 = 7 points."

Explanation:
Jackie has two options for paying her taxes: doing it herself or hiring an accountant. If she does it herself, she will have more free time and save $35 per hour in lost income. However, she will also have to spend $90 on accounting services. To calculate the cost of hiring an accountant, we need to subtract the amount saved by doing it herself from the total cost of hiring an accountant. Therefore, the cost of hiring an accountant is:

$90 - ($35 x number of hours saved) = $127$

Since Jackie saves 3 hours by hiring an accountant, the cost of hiring an accountant is:

$90 - ($35 x 3) = $127$
Therefore, the correct answer is $127$."

Explanation:
Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum payment for each debt, so she will pay $50% of the minimum payment for each debt. The minimum payment for the student loan is $300 per month, and the minimum payment for the credit card is $200 per month. Therefore, her total monthly payment will be:

Total monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, her total annual payment will be:

Total annual payment = Total monthly payment x 12 = $1000 x 12 = $12,000

Therefore, if Jessica pays $12,000 in one year, she will reduce her debts by half."

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Jerry is throwing a six-sided die. The probability of getting any particular number on the die is 1/6, or approximately 0.17.
Now, let's consider the event ""Jerry throws a number greater than 3"". This event can occur in two ways: either Jerry gets a 4, 5, or 6, or he gets a 2 and then rolls again to get a higher number.
The probability of getting a 4, 5, or 6 on the next roll after rolling a 2 is (3+1)/6 = 0.58.
So, the overall probability of Jerry throwing a number greater than 3 is (0.17 + 0.58) = 0.75."

Response: 40 pounds of insects per day. Explanation: To determine how many pounds of insects an entire flock of ten birds needs each day, we can use the information provided in the question that each bird requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Since there are seven days in a week, we multiply the amount required by each bird by seven to get the total amount needed for one week: 10 birds x 3.5 pounds/bird/week = 35 pounds/week. Then, since there are twenty-four hours in a day, we divide the total amount needed by the number of hours in a day to find out how much is needed per hour: 35 pounds/day / 24 hours/day = 40 pounds/hour.

To determine how much cà rốt will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of cà rốt that each restaurant will receive from the total amount of cà rốt available. Since there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant will receive 2 pounds (or 1 kilogram) of cà rốt, the total amount of cà rốt distributed among all restaurants is 80 pounds (or 36 kilograms). Therefore, the remaining amount of cà rốt that will not be used is:

Remaining cà rốt = Total amount of cà rốt - Amount of cà rốt distributed to restaurants = 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds (or 54 kilograms)
So, approximately 196 pounds (or 88 kilograms) of cà rốt will not be used."

Janeth promised to pay back $2000 with an additional 10% interest. If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance will be:

Remaining Balance = Initial Amount + Interest
= $2000 + ($2000 x 10%)
= $2200

Therefore, the amount of money that Janeth has left after making these payments is $2200 - $165 x 12 = $1378.40."

Explanation:
From the information given in the question, we know that James has 30 fire-type Pokémon cards and 40 water-type Pokémon cards. If he loses 8 water-type Pokémon cards, then the number of water-type Pokémon cards he has left is 40 - 8 = 32.

Now, let's assume that one of the remaining 32 water-type Pokémon cards is chosen at random from James' deck. The probability of choosing a water-type Pokémon card is 32/98, since there are 32 water-type Pokémon cards out of a total of 98 Pokémon cards in James' deck.

So, the probability that the chosen Pokémon card is a water-type card is 32/98, or 0.57."

"Response: 267
Explanation:
Let's analyze the situation:
After the meeting, 30% of students left through door A, which means 300 students (30% x 1000).
Since 3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, the number of students who left through door B is 3/5 x 700 = 490 students.
So, the total number of students who left through doors A and B is 300 + 490 = 790 students.
Now, let's calculate the number of students who left through door C:
Since the remaining 210 students did not leave through either door A or door B, they must have left through door C. Therefore, the number of students who left through door C is 210.
Therefore, the final answer is 267 (790 - 490 - 210) students left through door C after the meeting."

"Response: 4200
Explanation:
Jason has a monthly phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, which is 90 minutes per week and 360 minutes per month (since there are 4 weeks in a month). Additionally, he talks to other people for 300 minutes per month. Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason's total talk time for the month is:
Total talk time = Daily talk time x Number of days in the month
= 90 minutes/day x 30 days
= 2700 minutes
Since the question asks for the number of minutes if there were 30 days in the month, we add the additional 1000 minutes from the original question:
Total talk time = 2700 minutes + 1000 minutes
= 3700 minutes
Therefore, Jason has 3700 minutes of talk time in the month."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, Ginger gave Griffin ""a little"" of her khoai tây chiên, which means that she gave him 5 quả khoai tây chiên (since Kyle had already taken 5). Then, Colby took from Griffin fewer than 3 of the remaining khoai tây chiên that Kyle had taken. Therefore, if Griffin ended up with 27 quả khoai tây chiên, then Ginger must have given him 10 quả khoai tây chiên in total."
"Response: 160
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* In one fish tank, there are 4 snails.
* In another fish tank, there are 32 snails.
* The difference between the number of snails in the two tanks is twice the number of fish in the second tank.

From these statements, we can conclude that the number of fish in the first tank is equal to half the number of fish in the second tank. Therefore, the number of fish in the first tank is 16 (half of 32).

Now, let's calculate the total number of snails in both tanks:

In the first tank, there are 4 snails.
In the second tank, there are 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

So, the total number of snails in both tanks is 4 + 28 = 32."

Explanation:
Jeans spends 6 hours per day for 4 days a week, which is equivalent to 24 hours per week. Therefore, she spends a total of 120 hours (24 hours/week x 5 weeks) on makeup for the film.
Since each hour of makeup costs $250, Jeans' total cost for makeup during the filming period is:
$250/hour x 120 hours = $30,000
After completing the film, the discount given by the makeup artist is 10%, which means that Jeans will pay $27,000 ($30,000 x 90%) for the makeup services."
