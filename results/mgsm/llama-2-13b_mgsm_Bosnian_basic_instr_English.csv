Response:  To calculate how much Janet earns in dollars each day at the farmer's market, we need to subtract the number of eggs she eats for breakfast and bakes into cakes from the total number of eggs she lays daily. We also need to convert the remaining eggs into dollars based on their price per egg. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  * Janet lays 16 eggs per day.  * She eats three eggs for breakfast every morning (3 x $0.5 = $1.50).  * She bakes four cakes using six eggs each (4 x 6 = 24 eggs used for baking).  * The price per fresh egg at the farmer's market is $2.00. Now let's do the calculations: Total eggs laid per day = 16 eggs Eggs consumed for breakfast = 3 eggs Eggs used for baking = 24 eggs Total eggs available for sale = 16 - 3 - 24 = 9 eggs Price per egg sold = $2.00 Number of eggs sold per day = 9 eggs Daily income from selling eggs = 9 eggs x $2.00 = $18.00 So, Janet earns $18.00 per day selling her eggs at the farmer's market.
Response:  To make one complete shirt, you will need 3/2 = 1 and a half times as many blue stripes as white stripes. Since each blue stripe requires 2 threads of blue yarn and each white stripe requires 1 thread of white yarn, you will need a total of 2 x 3 (since there are three blue stripes) + 1 x 2 (since there is only one white stripe) = 6 threads of blue yarn and 2 threads of white yarn. Therefore, you will need a total of 8 threads of yarn to make one complete shirt.
"Response:  If JOSH bought a house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs, then the total investment was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. If the value of the house increased by 150%, then the current value of the house would be:  

Current Value = Original Price x (1 + Percentage Increase)  
= $80,000 x (1 + 150%)  
= $80,000 x 2.5  
= $200,000  
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000."
Response:  To find out how many meters James runs weekly, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does per day (3) by the distance of each sprint (60 meters): 3 x 60 = 180 meters. So, James runs 180 meters weekly.
"Response:  To determine how many feeding bowls of food Wendy should give to her chickens in the last meal of the day if she has 20 chickens, we need to calculate the total amount of food that each chicken needs for the day. Let's assume that each chicken eats 3 bowls of mixed feed per day (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, the total daily food requirement for all 20 chickens would be:  

Total Daily Food Requirement = Number of Chickens x Total Feed Per Chicken/Day  
= 20 x 3 = 60 bowls of mixed feed per day  
Since Wendy already gives her chickens 15 bowls of food in the morning and 25 bowls of food in the afternoon, the remaining amount of food they need in the last meal of the day is:  
Remaining Amount of Food = Total Daily Food Requirement - Morning + Afternoon Feeding  
= 60 - (15 + 25)  
= 60 - 40  
= 20 bowls of mixed feed per day  
Therefore, Wendy should give her chickens 20 bowls of mixed feed in the last meal of the day."
Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for the 16 cups, we need to calculate the total cost of all the cups he wants to buy. Since each cup costs $5, the first 8 cups will cost $5 x 8 = $40. The remaining 8 cups will cost $5 x 0.6 = $3.20 (since 60% of $5 is $3). Therefore, the total cost of all 16 cups is $40 + $3.20 = $43.20.
Response:  If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Toulouse has 20 x 2 = 40 sheep and Charleston has 20 x 4 = 80 sheep. Therefore, together they have 40 + 80 = 120 sheep.
"Response:  To calculate how much time it will take to download the file, we need to know the size of the file and the speed at which it is being downloaded. We are given that the file is 200 GB in size and that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/min. Therefore, the total number of minutes required to download the file would be:  

200,000,000,000 bytes / 2 GB/min = 100,000,000 minutes  

Since Carla has to restart her computer every 20 minutes for updates, she will have to restart the download 5 times (20 minutes x 5 = 100 minutes). Therefore, the total amount of time it will take to download the file, including the restarts, would be:  

100,000,000 minutes + 100 minutes = 100,100,000 minutes  

So, it would take approximately 100,100,000 minutes, or about 16,700 hours, to download the file. This is equivalent to approximately 693 days, or just over 18 years."
Response:  To find out how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate his average speed for the first two hours and then use that information to determine how far he traveled during those two hours. We can do this by using the formula: distance = speed x time. Since John was driving at 30 miles per hour for the first two hours, we know that his total distance traveled during those two hours is: distance = 30 x 2 = 60 miles. However, since John also drove at 80 miles per hour for the remaining two hours, we need to calculate how far he traveled during those two hours as well. We can do this by using the same formula: distance = speed x time. In this case, the distance John traveled during the last two hours is: distance = 80 x 2 = 160 miles. Therefore, the total distance John traveled in the four hours is: total distance = 60 + 160 = 220 miles. So, John is 220 miles away from home at the end of the four hours.
Response:  To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to first determine her regular hourly wage and then add any overtime pay she received. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  Regular hourly wage: $10 per hour Overtime rate (after 40 hours): 1.2 times her regular hourly wage Eliza worked 45 hours this week So, let's start by calculating her regular hourly wage for the first 40 hours: 40 hours x $10/hour = $400 Now, let's calculate her overtime pay for the remaining 5 hours: 5 hours x ($10/hour x 1.2) = $60 + $10 = $70 Total earnings for the week: $400 + $70 = $470
Response:  To find out how many downloads there were in three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads in each month and then add them up. Let's break down the information given in the question:  Month 1: 60 downloads Month 2: 3 times as many downloads as Month 1 = 3 x 60 = 180 downloads Month 3: 30% less than Month 2 = 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads So, the total number of downloads in three months is: 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.
"Response:  To calculate the total cost of the pastries purchased by Toula, we need to multiply the number of each type of pastry she bought by its price per ten pieces. Let's do this:  
* 3 desetine krafne x $68/desetina = $204  
* 2 desetine mini kolača x $80/desetina = $160  
* 6 desetina mini kolača od sira x $55/desetina = $330  
Adding all these amounts gives us the total cost:  
$204 + $160 + $330 = $794"
Response:  To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the following factors: 1) Initial investment (cost of planting the tree), 2) Annual revenue (number of lemons x price per lemon), and 3) Ongoing expenses (maintenance costs).  Let's assume that Carlos pays $90 upfront to plant the tree.  Each year, he will harvest 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.50 each. This means his annual revenue is $10.50 ($1.50 x 7 lemons). However, he also needs to spend $3 annually on irrigation and fertilization. So, his net income would be $7.50 ($10.50 - $3).  To break even, Carlos needs to cover his initial investment of $90. Therefore, he needs to harvest lemons for at least:  $$ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial investment}}{\text{Annual net income}} $$ $$ \text{Number of years} = \frac{$90}{$\$7.50$} $$ $$ \text{Number of years} = 12 \times \text{Number of years} = 12 \times 12 = 144 $$  In other words, Carlos will need to wait for approximately 144 months (or 12 years) before he starts making a profit from his lemon tree.
Response:  If Melanie started with 5 usisivača and sold one-third of them in the green house, two in the red house, and half of what was left in the orange house, then she would have 5 - (1/3) = 5 - 2 = 3 usisivača left.
Response:  To find out how many percent of the total number of students are enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.  So, if there are 30 students enrolled in hip-hop dance (out of 200), we can calculate as follows:  Percentage = (30/200) x 100 = 15%.  Therefore, 15% of the total number of students is enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Response:  To calculate the maximum profit for the merchant, we need to determine the expected increase in value of each item and then choose the one that will give the highest profit. Let's assume that the current price of jewelry is $5,000 per unit and the current price of electronics is $8,000 per unit.  For jewelry: Expected increase in value = (2.5% x $5,000) = $125 Profit per unit = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125 For electronics: Expected increase in value = (1.2% x $8,000) = $96 Profit per unit = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096 Based on these calculations, the merchant would maximize their profit by buying jewelry because it has a higher expected increase in value and therefore a higher profit per unit. The total profit for the merchant if they buy jewelry would be: 5 units x $5,125 = $25,625 If they buy electronics, the total profit would be: 4 units x $8,096 = $32,384 Therefore, the merchant should buy jewelry to maximize their profit.
"Response:  The distance traveled by each car in two days can be calculated as follows:  
Day 1 (westward journey):  
Car A travels for 80 miles westward.  
Car B travels for 80 miles westward.  
Total distance traveled by both cars on Day 1 = 2 x 80 = 160 miles.  
Day 2 (northern journey):  
Car A travels for 240 kilometers northward.  
Car B travels for 240 kilometers northward.  
Total distance traveled by both cars on Day 2 = 2 x 240 = 480 kilometers.  
Therefore, the total distance traveled by each car in two days is:  
Total distance = Total distance on Day 1 + Total distance on Day 2  
= 160 + 480 = 640 miles or 1030 kilometers."
Response:  To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to first determine how many hours she works per week as an instructor and as a trainer. Let's assume that she works 35 hours per week as an instructor (5 days x 7 hours/day) and 15 hours per week as a trainer (2 days x 7.5 hours/day).  Next, let's calculate her hourly wage for each job: Instructor: $20/hour Trainer: $30/hour Now, let's multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works per week for each job: Instructor: 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week Trainer: 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week Finally, let's add up her weekly earnings from both jobs to get her total weekly income: Total weekly income = $700 + $450 = $1,150 per week Now, let's convert her weekly income to an annual salary by multiplying it by 50 weeks per year (assuming she works 50 weeks per year): Annual salary = $1,150 x 50 weeks/year = $57,500 per year So, Jill's annual salary is approximately $57,500.
Response:  Claire will eat 12 eggs (3 x 4) in 4 weeks.
Response:  To determine the required speed to cover the remaining distance in one hour, we can use the formula: Total distance / Time taken = Speed. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles, and Marisa took 1 hour to cover the first 4 miles, so she has 8 miles left to cover. Therefore, her required speed to cover the remaining distance in one hour is:  8 miles / 1 hour = 8 miles/hour.
Response:  There are 24 liters of liquid left after adding 15 liters of pineapple juice to 2/3 full orange drink (orange drink contains 2/3 water). If we add 1 liter of pineapple juice to 2/3 full orange drink, then there will be 24 - 1 = 23 liters of liquid left. So, there are 23 liters of water in the remaining liquid.

Response:  To find out how many pizza boxes Marie ordered if each box costs $8.50 and she paid a total of $50, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem. Let's say Marie bought x pizza boxes. Since each box costs $8.50, the total cost of all the boxes would be: 8.50x We know that Marie paid a total of $50, so we can set up the equation: 8.50x = 50 Solving for x, we get: x = 6 So Marie bought 6 pizza boxes.
"Response:  To find out how much Misaka spent on clothes, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up. Let's start by calculating the cost of each item:  
Shorts (3 pairs x $16.50 per pair) = $49.50  
Pants (3 pairs x $22.50 per pair) = $67.50  
Shoes (3 pairs x $42 per pair) = $126  
Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243  
Therefore, Misaka spent $243 on clothes."
"Response:  To find out how much Sintija will spend on sladoled after 60 days, we need to calculate the total cost of 60 kutija (boxes) of sladoled. We know that each kutija costs $4, so the total cost would be:  
60 x $4 = $240  Therefore, Sintija will spend $240 on sladoled after 60 days."
Response:  The distance between the first and second stops is 35 miles (20 + 15 = 35).
"Response:  To find out how much the shoes cost, we need to use the information that one pair of boots costs $33 and the other pair of boots costs twice as much. Let's call the price of the second pair of boots x. Then, we can write an equation based on the given information:  
x + 2x = (33 + x) + (33 + x)  
Simplifying the equation:  
3x + 2x = 2(33 + x)  
5x = 66  
Dividing both sides by 5:  
x = 13  
So, the first pair of boots costs $33, and the second pair of boots costs $26 (twice $33)."

So, the average is 125/3 = 41.67."
Response:  If John spends half an hour each day taking care of his 10 dogs, then he spends 5 hours per week (7 days x 1/2 hour/day) caring for them.
"Response:  Gretchen has 110 novčića and 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's say she has x silver coins. Then, she has 30 + x gold coins. We know that the total number of coins is 110. So we can set up the equation:

x + (30 + x) = 110

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing by 2:

x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 30 + 40 = 70 gold coins."
Response:  If Raymond has 40 dragulja and Aaron has five more than half of Raymond's dragulja, then Aaron has 5 + (1/2) \* 40 = 5 + 20 = 25 dragulja. Since Siobhan has two fewer dragulja than Aaron, she has 25 - 2 = 23 dragulja.
"Response:  To find out how many points Mike scored in total, we need to calculate his score for each of the two periods and then add them up. For the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points, so:  
Mike's score for first 20 minutes = 4 points  
For the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than the previous period, which means he scored:  
Mike's score for second 20 minutes = (4 x 1.25) = 5 points  
Now, let's add up Mike's scores for both periods:  
Total points scored by Mike = 4 + 5 = 9 points"

Response:  If John has $5 left after buying 8 video games at $20 each and he had 13 Lego sets that he sold for $15 each, then he would have had $13 \times 15 = 195 dollars from selling the Lego sets. So, he spent $195 + (8 x $20) = $195 + $160 = $355 on video games and Lego sets. Therefore, John has $5 - $355 = 5 - 355 = -$350 left.
"Response:  To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed for each day and then add them up. Let's start by calculating his daily distances:  
Day 1: 3 hours x 5 km/hour = 15 km Day 2: 1.5 hours x 5 km/hour = 7.5 km Day 3: 1.5 hours x 5 km/hour = 7.5 km Total distance covered in 3 days: 15 km + 7.5 km + 7.5 km = 30 km Now, let's calculate his average speed for each day: Day 1: 15 km / 3 hours = 5 km/hour Day 2: 7.5 km / 1.5 hours = 5 km/hour Day 3: 7.5 km / 1.5 hours = 5 km/hour Average speed over 3 days: (5 km/hour x 3) / 3 = 5 km/hour So, John runs at an average speed of 5 km/hour."
"Response:  To find out how many miles Dana can cover in 6 hours if she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking, we need to first determine how far she can run in an hour. We know that she can run at a speed of four times her walking speed, so if she walks at a speed of x miles per hour, she can run at a speed of 4x miles per hour. Since she covers 3 miles in an hour when running, we have:  

4x = 3  

Solving for x, we get:  

x = 1.5  

So, Dana's walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour. Now, we can calculate how far she can walk in an hour:  

Walking distance = Walking speed x Time  
= 1.5 x 1  
= 1.5 miles  

Since Dana spends two-thirds of her time walking, she will cover twice the distance she walks while running:  

Total walking distance = 2 x 1.5  
= 3 miles  

Now, let's calculate how far Dana can run in 6 hours:  

Running distance = Running speed x Time  
= 4x x 6  
= 24 miles  

Adding the total walking distance and running distance, we get:  

Total distance covered = Walking distance + Running distance  
= 3 + 24  
= 27 miles  

Therefore, Dana can cover 27 miles in 6 hours if she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking."

"Response:  To determine how far from the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit it with her golden spear, we need to calculate the distance at which the flames will reach if she is standing that far away. Let's assume that the diameter of the flames is 300 meters (as stated in the problem). The area of a circle (A) can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where r is half the diameter. So, for a circle with a diameter of 300 meters, the area would be: A = π(150)^2 = approximately 97,656 square meters. Now, let's consider the volume of the flames (V) as a cylinder with a radius equal to half the diameter of the flames (r = 150 meters): V = πr^2h, where h is the height of the flames (which we are asked to find). Since the flames are ""high"" and ""dense,"" let's assume that their height is roughly equal to their diameter: h = 300 meters. Therefore, the volume of the flames would be: V = π(150)^2(300) = approximately 2,827 cubic meters. Finally, we need to calculate the distance at which the flames will reach if Polly stands that far away. We can use the fact that the rate of spreading of the flames is proportional to the surface area of the flames: the farther away Polly stands, the less surface area of the flames she needs to cover. Let's assume that the rate of spreading is constant and proportional to the surface area of the flames. Then, the distance at which the flames will reach (d) can be calculated as follows: d = V/A, where A is the area of the flames (which we already calculated above). Substituting the values, we get: d = 2,827 / 97,656 ≈ 29 meters. Therefore, if Polly stands within 29 meters of the dragon's flames while holding the sapphire, she can still hit it with her golden spear."
"Response:  To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces (14) from the total number of pieces that Baka Džons made (5 x 8 = 40). Therefore, the answer is:

Response:  To determine how many chips you can eat while staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories and having already consumed 1800 calories, we need to calculate the number of grams of chips that is equivalent to 5 portions of 250 calories each. We know that there are 300g in a bag of chips, so we can start by dividing the total number of calories in the bag (300 x 250 = 75000) by the number of calories in one portion (250): 75000 / 250 = 300. Therefore, if you have already consumed 1800 calories and want to stay within your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories, you can eat up to 300 grams of chips (since this is equivalent to 5 portions of 250 calories each).
"Response:  If Charlie sells each candle for $2 and he makes 10 conical candles with one kilogram of beeswax, then his total revenue from selling all 20 candles would be:  

2 x 20 = 40 dollars

His cost of producing one kilogram of beeswax is $10, so his total cost would be:  

10 + (2 x 20) = 10 + 40 = 50 dollars

Therefore, his net profit would be:  

40 - 50 = -10 dollars

So, Charlie would have a net loss of $10 if he sold all 20 candles for $2 each."
Response:  To calculate the total number of hours that Meredith spent writing blog posts in three days, we need to know how many hours she spent writing each day and then add them up. Let's start by analyzing the information given in the question:  - On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 blog posts, and it took her 4 hours to write each post, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing on Monday.  - On Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2 more blog posts than she did on Monday, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 blog posts. Each post took her 4 hours to write, so she spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours writing on Tuesday.  - On Wednesday, Meredith wrote double the number of blog posts she did on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 x 7 = 14 blog posts. Each post took her 4 hours to write, so she spent 14 x 4 = 56 hours writing on Wednesday. Now let's add up the total number of hours Meredith spent writing blog posts in three days: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours. Therefore, Meredith spent 104 hours writing blog posts over the course of three days.
Response:  There were 23 post-it notes left over after Candice placed one on each of the 220 different cups at work. So there were 23 - 220 = 1 post-it note(s) in the package that Candice bought.
"Response:  To find out how much John spent on kravates, we need to calculate the cost of the red and blue ones separately. The cost of the red kravates is 50% more than the blue ones, so the cost of one red kravate is:  
CR = (1 + 0.5) x BP = (1 + 0.5) x 40 = 60 dollars per piece. Since John bought twice as many red kravates as blue ones, he spent:  
JT = 2 x CR x N = 2 x 60 x 2 = 480 dollars on red kravates. And since he also bought blue kravates, he spent:  
JT = JT + BT = 480 + 40 x N = 480 + 40 x 2 = 960 dollars in total. Therefore, John spent $960 on kravates."

"Response:  To calculate how much Lloyd earns from eggs weekly, we need to multiply the number of eggs produced daily by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:  

252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week  

Since each egg sells for $2, the total revenue from eggs per week is:  

1,764 eggs/week x $2/egg = $3,528 per week"
Response:  To find out how long it will take for Tom to return, we need to know his speed and the distance he needs to cover. We are given that he travels at a speed of 6 km/h during his return journey. Therefore, we can calculate the time it will take for him to return as follows: Time = Distance / Speed Time = (4 - 1) x 6 km/h + 1 = 3 x 6 km/h + 1 = 18 km/h + 1 = 19 hours So, Tom will take 19 hours to return.
Response:  To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we need to divide the weight of the books by the weight of each toy. Let's say the total weight of the books is x kilograms (since there are 30 stripov and each one weighs 1 kg). So, the total weight of the books is: x = 30 \* 1 = 30 kg Now, since each toy weighs 1 kg, we can calculate the number of toys needed to equal the weight of the books as follows: Number of toys = Total weight of books / Weight of each toy Number of toys = 30 kg / 1 kg Number of toys = 30 Therefore, he needs to remove 30 toys from his shelf.
"Response:  To calculate the total amount earned by the mechanic for each day, we need to multiply the number of tires and wheels repaired by their respective prices. For Thursday (6 tires x $60/tire + 4 wheels x $40/wheel), the total earnings are:  

6 tires x $60/tire = $360  
4 wheels x $40/wheel = $160  
Total earnings for Thursday = $520  
For Friday (12 automobile tires x $40/tire), the total earnings are:  

12 tires x $40/tire = $480  
Total earnings for Friday = $480  
Therefore, the mechanic earned more on Friday with a higher income of $480 compared to Thursday's income of $520."

Response:  To calculate the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to first find out how much she paid in the first half of the year and then add the difference between what she paid in the first half and what she paid in the second half. Let's assume that the streaming company charged her $140 per month.  Monthly payment = $140 First half of the year (6 months) = $140 x 6 = $840 Second half of the year (6 months) = $840 x 0.9 = $752 Difference = $840 - $752 = $88 Total amount paid by Aleena by the end of the year = $840 + $88 = $928
"Response:  To find out how far Sofija can drive with one fill-up of gasoline, we need to divide the amount of fuel she has (4 gallons) by the capacity of her car's fuel tank (12 gallons). This gives us:  
4 gallons / 12 gallons = 0.33 or 33% of the full tank  
Since Sofija has driven 160 km since her last fill-up, and she needs to travel an additional distance, we can calculate how far she can go using the percentage of the full tank:  
Distance = (160 km x 0.33) + 160 km Distance = 52 km + 160 km Distance = 212 km  
Therefore, Sofija can drive approximately 212 kilometers with one fill-up of gasoline."
Response:  To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate how much time he spends doing each activity per week.  Weekly TV viewing time = 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours Weekly reading time = 1/2 hour x 3 days = 1.5 hours Total weekly leisure time = 6 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours Since there are 7 days in a week, Jim spends 7.5 hours per day on leisure activities. To find out how many hours he spends on these activities in 4 weeks, multiply the daily amount by 4:  Total leisure time in 4 weeks = 7.5 hours/day x 4 weeks = 30 hours So, Jim spends 30 hours watching TV and reading in 4 weeks.

Let's assume that 4 of her 16 invited friends will not show up (since ""se četvrtina prisutnih ne pojavi""). So, Christina will have 16 - 4 = 12 guests at her party. If each favor costs $2, then she will spend:  
12 x $2 = $24  
Therefore, Christina will spend $24 on party favors."
Response:  To determine how many kilograms of coleslaw Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of food needed for all the guests. Let's start by determining how much each adult and child will eat. We know that an adult will eat 10 kilograms of coleslaw, and a child will eat half as much, or 5 kilograms. Since there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, we can calculate the total amount of coleslaw needed as follows: Total amount of coleslaw needed = Number of adults x Amount per adult + Number of children x Amount per child Total amount of coleslaw needed = 20 x 10 kg + 5 x 5 kg Total amount of coleslaw needed = 200 kg + 25 kg Total amount of coleslaw needed = 225 kg So, Ted needs to bring 225 kilograms of coleslaw to the picnic to ensure that everyone has enough to eat.

Response:  To find out how old Jackson is, we need to use the information that Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey. Let's start by calculating Amy's age: 5 + 2 = 7 years older than Jackson. So, Amy is 7 years older than Jackson. Now, let's calculate Corey's age: 10 - 2 = 8 years older than Jackson. So, Corey is 8 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is: 7 + 8 = 15 years old.
Response:  To find out how fast Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles if he has improved his diet by 10%, we need to first determine how long it takes him to run 400 meters without obstacles. We know that Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds without obstacles, so Gerald's time without obstacles would be 38 x 1.1 = 41.8 seconds. Now, to find out how fast Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles, we need to add the time it takes him to clear the obstacles. Let's assume that each obstacle adds 2 seconds to his overall time. Therefore, Gerald's time for running 400 meters with obstacles would be 41.8 + (2 x 2) = 41.8 + 4 = 45.8 seconds.
"Response:  To find out how many pets there are in total, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the number of cats per dog and then add that result to the number of dogs. So, if there are 60 dogs and each dog has an average of 2 cats (since ""dve mačke na svakoga psa"" means ""two cats per dog""), then the total number of pets is:

60 x 2 = 120

Adding this to the number of dogs gives us:

60 + 120 = 180

Therefore, there are 180 ljubimaca (pets) in the komšiluk (neighborhood)."

Response:  To determine how many pages Solo needs to read each day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days left to finish reading. Let's break it down as follows: Total pages = 4 (naučni udžbenik) + 20 (društveni studiji) + 7 (istorija) + 8 (geografija) = 39 pages. Number of days left = 4 (days left in the week) - 1 (day already passed) = 3 days. Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of: 39 pages / 3 days = 13 pages per day.

Number of containers = 30 / 5  
Number of containers = 6  
Therefore, there were 6 containers delivered on the second day."
"Response:  To find out the total amount of money that both Adrien and Lily received four years later, we need to calculate the increase in their salaries over the past four years. Let's assume that Lily's salary increased by x% over the past four years. Then, Adrien's salary increased by (40 - x)%. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lily's before the increase, so we can set up an equation based on this information.

Let L be Lily's salary before the increase, and let A be Adrien's salary before the increase. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lily's, we have:
A = L + (L \* 0.3)

We also know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the past four years, so we can write:
A = L + (L \* 0.3) + (40 - x)\% \* L

Now we need to find the value of x. We know that Lily's salary increased by x%, so we can substitute x for the percentage increase:

A = L + (L \* 0.3) + (40 - x)\% \* L
= L + (L \* 0.3) + (40 - x)\% \* (L + (L \* 0.3))
= L + (2L \* 0.3) + (40 - x)\% \* L

Simplifying the expression, we get:

A = 3L + (40 - x)\% \* L

Since Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years ago, we can set up another equation based on this information:

40,000 = 3L + (40 - x)\% \* L

Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:

40,000 = 3L + (40 - x)\% \* (L + (2L \* 0.3))

Solving the system of equations, we find that:
"

Response:  To find out how much fruit they have altogether, we need to add up all the quantities that each of them brought. Let's do it step by step:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 pears, so she brought a total of 5 + 8 = 13 pieces of fruit.  Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette (2 x 5 = 10) and half as many pears (half of 8 is 4), so Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 pieces of fruit.  Therefore, together they have 13 + 14 = 27 pieces of fruit.

Response:  To find out how much Dillon will spend in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up. The cost of 4 lubenices is 4 x 3 = 12$, the cost of 20 paprikas is 20 x 15 = 30$, and the cost of 10 naranches is 10 x 5 = 5$. Therefore, the total amount that Dillon will spend is 12 + 30 + 5 = 57$.
"Response:  If the hospital sees 500 patients per day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, then the total number of minutes spent by all patients in the hospital per day is:  

500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

If the doctors are paid $150 per hour and the hospital charges $200 per hour for patient care, then the daily revenue from doctor visits is:  

12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours/day

At $150 per hour, the daily revenue from doctor visits is:  

200 hours/day x $150/hour = $30,000/day

Similarly, if the hospital charges $200 per hour for patient care, then the daily revenue from patient care is:  

12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours/day

At $200 per hour, the daily revenue from patient care is:  

200 hours/day x $200/hour = $40,000/day

Therefore, the total daily revenue of the hospital is:  

$30,000 (from doctor visits) + $40,000 (from patient care) = $70,000/day"

Response:  To calculate how many tickets were used that day, we need to find out how much each ride cost and then add up all the costs for both rides. Since each ride on the roller coaster cost 6 tickets, and Pam rode it twice, she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets. Similarly, since Fred rode the roller coaster four times, he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets. In total, they used 12 + 24 = 36 tickets.
Response:  In order to find out how many kilometers Walt walked on Wednesday (Srijeda), we can use the information that he walked 6 km on Monday and that he walked 6 times more miles on Tuesday than he did on Monday. Let's start by converting the distance from miles to kilometers: 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers So, if Walt walked 6 miles on Monday, he walked: 6 miles x 1.60934 km/mile = 9.65784 km On Tuesday, he walked 6 times more miles than he did on Monday, so he walked: 6 x 9.65784 km = 57.94624 km Therefore, Walt walked 57.94624 kilometers on Wednesday (Srijeda).

Response:  To find out how many questions were left unanswered by Mark in the second test, we need to calculate how much time he spent on each test and compare it with the total time available for both tests. Let's start by calculating the time taken by Mark to complete the first test:  Time taken = Number of questions / Speed per question  Time taken = 75 / 5  Time taken = 15 hours (approximately) Since Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test, we can calculate how many questions he could have answered as follows:  Number of questions answered = Total time available - Time taken  Number of questions answered = 8 - 15  Number of questions answered = 3 (approximately) Now, let's calculate the time taken by Mark to complete the second test:  Time taken = Number of questions / Speed per question  Time taken = 100 / 5  Time taken = 20 hours (approximately) Since Mark had 6 hours to complete the second test, we can calculate how many questions he could have answered as follows:  Number of questions answered = Total time available - Time taken  Number of questions answered = 6 - 20  Number of questions answered = 4 (approximately) Finally, we can subtract the number of questions answered from the total number of questions to find out how many questions were left unanswered:  Number of questions left unanswered = Total number of questions - Number of questions answered  Number of questions left unanswered = 100 - 3 - 4  Number of questions left unanswered = 93 (approximately) Therefore, Mark left approximately 93 questions unanswered in the second test.

Response:  To calculate how much Jordan would earn for a week of playing video games and working part-time, we need to know how many hours he spends playing video games per day and how many days he plays per week. Let's assume he plays video games for 2 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Total hours played per week = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week  If Jordan works part-time for half of the time he spends playing video games (i.e., 7 hours/week), his total weekly work hours are:  Total work hours per week = 7 hours/week  Now, let's calculate Jordan's total earnings for the week from both sources:  Video game earnings per week = 14 hours/week x $10/hour = $140  Part-time job earnings per week = 7 hours/week x $10/hour = $70  Total weekly earnings = $140 + $70 = $210  Therefore, Jordan would earn $210 for a week of playing video games and working part-time.
Response:  The total cost of all items is $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15. With a 10% tax rate, the total cost including tax would be $15 x 1.10 = $16.50.
"Response:  To calculate the amount of profit that Lucas will make each week, we need to subtract his total costs from his total revenue. Total revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of clients he has by the cost of one client (2 bottles of detergent and a pack of cleaning supplies). So, for 3 clients, his total revenue would be:

Total revenue = 3 x $20 (cost per client) = $60

For the additional 5 potential clients, his total revenue would be:

Total revenue = 5 x $20 (cost per client) = $100

Total revenue = $60 + $100 = $160

Now, let's calculate his total costs. He has 3 clients who will use 2 bottles of detergent each, so he will sell:

2 x 3 = 6 bottles of detergent at $2 each = $12

He will also sell 3 packs of cleaning supplies at $5 each = $15

Total costs = $12 + $15 = $27

So, his profit can be calculated as follows:

Profit = Total revenue - Total costs
= $160 - $27
= $133

Therefore, Lucas will make a profit of $133 each week."
Response:  If John has 10 hectares of land and can harvest 100 ananas per hectare every 3 months, then he can collect 10 x 100 = 1000 ananas per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, John can collect a total of 1000 x 12 = 12,000 ananas per year.
"Response:  To find out how many Lego blocks Johnny will collect if he buys all of them, we need to calculate the total number of blocks in all three boxes. Let's start by converting each box into a numerical value:

Box 1 (500 pieces): 500
Box 2 (3 times more than Box 1): 3 x 500 = 1500
Box 3 (1/4 less than Box 1): 1/4 x 500 = 125

Now, let's add up all the values:

500 + 1500 + 125 = 2225

Therefore, Johnny will have 2225 Lego blocks if he buys all of them."
Response:  To find out how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to subtract the number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours from the total number of bees that Debra saw returning to the hive. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  * In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive.  * In the next 6 hours (from 12 pm to 6 pm), Debra saw half as many bees leaving the hive as she saw leaving in the morning (half of 30 is 15).  * Of the bees that left in the morning, each one either returned or did not return. Since Debra saw twice as many bees returning as she saw leaving in the afternoon (2 x 15 = 30), we know that half of the bees that left in the morning (15) did not return.  * Therefore, the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is: 30 (bees that left in the morning) - 15 (bees that did not return) + 30 (bees that returned in the afternoon) = 45 bees.
"Response:  If Brittany's mom gave the cashier $8 and received one adult ticket ($12) and one child ticket ($10), then she paid a total of $22 for both tickets. Therefore, the amount of money that Brittany's mom gave to the cashier is:

Response:  If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends and James has four times as many Facebook friends as Charlie, then James has 4 x 12 = 48 Facebook friends.
Response:  To determine who will arrive home first, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel their respective distances. Let's start with Steve:  Steve lives 3 miles away from school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Therefore, his journey time is:  Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 7.5 minutes (round up to 8 minutes) Now let's calculate Tim's journey time: Tim lives 3 kilometers away from school and can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. His journey time is: Time = Distance / Speed = 3 km / 264 ft/min = 11.4 minutes (round up to 12 minutes) Since Steve has a shorter distance to cover and can travel faster, he will arrive home before Tim. The difference in arrival time is: Difference = Time 1 - Time 2 = 8 minutes - 12 minutes = 4 minutes So, Steve will arrive home 4 minutes before Tim.
Response:  The total amount of money earned that day is $25 x 5 = $125 (from the first five people who came to inflate their tires) + $3 x 3 = $9 (from the three people who came to fill all the tires on their tricycles) + $1 (from the one person who came to fill one tire on one bicycle), for a total of $135.

Response:  To find out how many hours Kimo spends in class per semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.  Weekly hours = (3 x 1 hour/day) + (2 x 2 hours/day) = 3 + 4 = 7 hours/week Total hours per semester = 7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours So, Kimo spends 112 hours in class per semester.
"Response:  To find out how long Bill's row of baked goods will be if he places them all end to end, we need to calculate the total length of each type of item and add them up.  First, let's convert the lengths from centimeters to meters:  
* 10 cm = 0.1 m (since there are 100 cm in 1 m)  
* 15 cm = 0.15 m  
* 60 cm = 0.6 m  
Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of item:  
* Kolacici: 300 x 0.1 m = 30 m  
* Čokoladni krušči: 120 x 0.15 m = 18 m  
* Bageti: 60 x 0.6 m = 36 m  
Finally, we add up the total lengths to get the overall length of Bill's row of baked goods:  
Total length = 30 m + 18 m + 36 m = 94 m"
Response:  To determine how many bananas need to be purchased for two months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required per month.  Monthly Banana Requirements:  Majmunima - 200 banana Gorilama - 400 banana Pavijanima - 100 banana Total - 700 banana Since there are two months, we double the total requirement:  Monthly Banana Requirement x 2 = 1400 banana Therefore, 1400 bananas need to be purchased for two months.
"Response:  To determine how much farther the winner (Blake) runs than the loser (Kelly), we need to calculate the distance traveled by each of them. Let's start with Blake: he runs back and forth 15 times, so his total distance is:  

15 x 20 yards/run = 300 yards  
Now, let's look at Kelly's distance. She runs once from one end of the field to the other (100 yards), then back to the starting line (40 yards), for a total of:  

100 + 40 = 140 yards  
So, the winner (Blake) runs 300 - 140 = 160 yards farther than the loser (Kelly)."

"Response:  To calculate how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum for her student loan, credit card debt, and mortgage, we need to first calculate the monthly payments for each debt at the minimum payment amount. Then, we can multiply the monthly payment by 12 to get the annual payment.  For the student loan, the monthly payment at the minimum of $300 is:  
$300 x 12 = $3600 per year  For the credit card debt, the monthly payment at the minimum of $200 is:  
$200 x 12 = $2400 per year  For the mortgage, the monthly payment at the minimum of $500 is:  
$500 x 12 = $6000 per year  Now, let's calculate the total annual payment if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum for all three debts:  Student loan:

"Response:  To determine how long it will take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time required for each step of the process (washing and peeling) and then add up those times. Let's break down the steps as follows:  
1. Washing: Each potato takes approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds to wash. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time required for washing = 60 x 1 minute and 30 seconds = 90 minutes.  
2. Peeling: Each potato takes approximately 5 seconds to peel. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time required for peeling = 60 x 5 seconds = 300 seconds or 5 minutes.  
Therefore, the total time required for Billy to prepare all 60 potatoes = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes."
"Response:  To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to divide the amount of money they earned from selling lemonade by the price per gallon of lemonade. So, if they earned $25 and sold each gallon for $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar), then:  
$25 / ($3 + $2) = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons  
Since they sold 20 cups per gallon, they sold a total of:  
5 x 20 = 100 cups of lemonade  
So, they spent $3 x 100 = $300 on lemons."

We know that she ordered 200 white carnations and 800 red roses. Therefore, we can calculate as follows:  
Number of red roses = Number of white carnations x 4  
= 200 x 4  
= 800  
So, Sandra needs 800 red roses to have her job."
Response:  If Jean is two years older than Mark and Mark was five years younger than half of Jean's age two years ago, then we can set up an equation to represent this information. Let J be Jean's current age (in years) and M be Mark's current age (in years). We know that J = 2 + 5, so J = 7. Two years ago, Mark's age was half of Jean's age at that time, so M = (J/2), or M = 7/2 = 3.5. Since Mark is now 3.5 years old, he was 3 years old two years ago. Therefore, Jean is currently 7 years old, and Mark is 3 years old.
Response:  The faster team will be seconds ahead of the slower team after each leg of the relay race. To calculate this, we need to know how much time each member of the faster team will take to run their respective legs. Let's assume that the first runner of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the second runner will finish their leg in 52 seconds (55 - 3), the third runner will finish in 50 seconds (52 - 3), and the fourth runner will finish in 48 seconds (50 - 3). Now, let's calculate the total time for the faster team: 55 + 52 + 50 + 48 = 205 seconds. Since each leg is 400 meters long, the faster team will complete the entire race in 205/400 = 51.25 seconds. On the other hand, the slower team will take 60 seconds for their first leg, so they will trail behind by 60 - 51.25 = 8.75 seconds after the first leg. As each successive leg is completed, the gap between the two teams will increase accordingly. After four legs, the faster team will be ahead by 8.75 x 4 = 35 seconds. So, the final result will be: Faster Team: 51.25 seconds Slower Team: 51.25 + 35 = 86.25 seconds

Response:  To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the three cards and the two rides. Then, we can divide the total cost by the number of people to get the individual cost per person. Let's start with the cost of the three cards: 3 x $10 = $30. Now let's add the cost of the two rides: $30 + $33 + $33 = $96. Since they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, we subtract that amount from the total cost: $96 - $4.50 = $91.50. Finally, we divide the total cost by the number of people (three) to get the individual cost per person: $91.50 / 3 = $30.50 per person.

Response:  To find out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has after three months, we need to calculate the total number of cards she collected in each month and then add them up. Let's break down the information given in the question:  Month 1: Elaine collected 3 times as many cards as she had at first (20 x 3 = 60).  Month 2: Elaine collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month (60 - 20 = 40).  Month 3: Elaine collected twice as many cards as she did in the first two months combined (40 + 40 = 80). Therefore, the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has after three months is: 80 + 40 + 60 = 180.

Response:  To calculate how many pieces of cheese Carlo has used in total, we need to add up all the amounts he mentioned. For the sandwiches, he used 2 slices per day x 7 days = 14 slices (since there are 7 days in a week). For the omelette, he used 3 eggs per day x 3 days = 9 eggs (since there is no mention of how many times he made the omelette). And for the macaroni dish, he used 8 slices of cheese (no mention of how much each slice weighs). Therefore, Carlo has used a total of: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.

On Wednesday, she bought five times as many kolacas as she did on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 kolacas. In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 kolacas over the three days.
Response:  The cost of each cup is $6000 / 10 = $600 per cup. Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 20 cups would be $600 x 20 = $12,000.
"Response:  To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate her earnings from mowing the lawn and compare it to the cost of the items she wants to buy. Let's break down the information given in the question:  

* Sara wants to buy a new jacket that costs $30 and two pairs of shoes that cost $20 each ($20 x 2 = $40).  
* She earns $5 for every time she mows the lawn (4 times = $20).  
* Her parents pay her $4 for every time she mows the lawn (4 times = $16).  
* She already has $10 saved up.  

Now let's add up all of Sara's earnings from mowing the lawn:  
$20 + $16 + $10 = $46  
Since the total cost of the items she wants to buy is $40, Sara only needs to mow the lawn one more time to earn enough money to buy everything!"

Response:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford to buy the shoes and the belt together, we need to calculate the total cost of both items and then divide that number by her hourly wage.  Total Cost = Shoes ($320) + Belt ($32) = $352  Divide the total cost by her hourly wage: $352 / $8.00/hour = 44 hours So, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy both the shoes and the belt together.
Response:  To find out how much Janeth will have to pay in total, we need to calculate the present value of her future payments using an annuity formula. The formula is: PV = PMT x (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r Where: PV = Present Value PMT = Monthly payment $165 in this case n = Number of periods 12 months or 1 year r = Interest rate We know that Janeth promised to return the loan with an additional 10% interest, so the interest rate is 10%. Now let's plug in the numbers: PV = $165 x (1 - (1 + 0.10)^(-12)) / 0.10 PV = $165 x (1 - 0.8743) / 0.10 PV = $165 x 0.1257 / 0.10 PV = $1962.85 So, Janeth's preostali saldo after 12 monthly payments of $165 each would be $1962.85.

where x is Adrian's current age, which is three times Harriet's current age."
Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:  - Naomi scored 68 points.  - Juri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score (which is 68).  - Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi's score (which is 68).  To find out how many points Jojo scored, we can use the fact that the total number of points scored by all four students is 251. So, if we subtract the scores of the first three students from the total, we get the remaining points that Jojo scored:  Total points = 251  - Naomi's score + Juri's score + Brianna's score  = 251 + 68 + x + y  where x is Juri's score and y is Brianna's score.  Now, let's substitute the values we know into this equation:  Total points = 251 + 68 + x + y  We know that Juri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so:  Juri's score = 68 + 10 = 78  And we know that Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi's score, so:  Brianna's score = 68 + 17 = 85  Substituting these values into the previous equation, we get:  Total points = 251 + 68 + 78 + 85  Simplifying, we get:  Total points = 491  Since there are only four students, each student must have scored an equal amount of points. Therefore, Jojo scored the same amount as the other three students, which is:  Jojo's score = 491 / 4 = 122  Points.
"Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing games during the weekend, we need to calculate the total time she spent on each activity and then add it up. Let's start by calculating the time she spent on crosswords:

Response:  To find out how many hours it will take for Kalinda and her mom to finish the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of working. Let's say that Kalinda can set up 4 pieces per minute, and her mother can set up half as much, or 2 pieces per minute. So together, they can set up 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. There are 360 pieces in total, so we can divide 360 by 6 to get the number of minutes it will take them to finish: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes. Therefore, it will take them 1 hour (or 60 minutes) to finish the puzzle.

Response:  To determine how many trees Steve needs to produce three pears daily, we need to calculate his daily consumption of pears first. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and she consumes three pears per day, Steve eats six pears per day (2 x 3 = 6). Now, we can calculate how many trees he needs:  Three pears per tree per week = 3 x 4 weeks/month = 12 pears per month per tree To meet Steve's demand of six pears per day, he would need 12 / 6 = 2 trees.

"Response:  To find out how many students exited through door C, we need to first determine how many students remained inside after 30% of them left through door A and 3/5 of the remaining students left through door B. Let's use algebra to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of students who left through door A (x = 30% of 1000 = 300).
Let y be the number of students who left through door B (y = 3/5 of 700 = 210).
So, the total number of students who left the building is x + y = 300 + 210 = 510.
Now, let z be the number of students who exited through door C (z = 510 - 300 - 210 = 490).
Therefore, there were 490 students who exited through door C."
"Response:  To find out how many more sweets John has than James, we need to subtract the number of sweets James has from the total number of sweets John has. So, if James has 6 sweets and John has 54 sweets, then:

Day 3: Both Dolly and Pandora continue reading their respective books.  
Day 4: Dolly finishes her second book, while Pandora finishes her third chapter.  
Day 5: Both Dolly and Pandora have finished all their books/chapters. Therefore, it will take them 5 days to read all their books together."
Response:  To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters per week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then divide that by his writing speed. Let's break down the information given in the question:  * He writes to five people.  * Each person sends him two letters per week, each letter being five pages long.  * Mike responds to each letter with an equal length response.  Based on this information, we can calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week as follows:  Total number of pages written = (2 x 5) x 5 = 50 pages/week Now, let's calculate Mike's writing speed:  Writing speed = 6 minutes/page  Therefore, the time it takes Mike to write one page is 6 minutes. To find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters per week, we can now multiply the total number of pages he writes by his writing speed:  Time spent writing letters per week = Total number of pages written x Writing speed  Time spent writing letters per week = 50 pages/week x 6 minutes/page  Time spent writing letters per week = 300 minutes/week  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the minutes to hours as follows:  Time spent writing letters per week = 300 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour  Time spent writing letters per week = 5 hours/week  Therefore, Mike spends 5 hours per week writing letters.
"Response:  To calculate the total number of minutes for the month, we need to add the daily 15-minute calls with the shelf and the additional 300 minutes of calls with other people. Therefore, the total number of minutes for the month is:

"Response:  Let's denote the number of fish in the first aquarium as x and the number of fish in the second aquarium as y. We know that the difference between the number of fish in the two aquariums is twice the number of snails in the second aquarium. So we can write an equation based on this information:  
x + y = 4(32) = 128  
Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 2y = 128  
Solving for x and y:  
x = 64  
y = 64  
Therefore, there are 64 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  To calculate how much Jean paid for her makeup services, we need to first determine the total amount she was charged for each day of shooting. We know that she was charged $250 per hour and that she needed 6 hours of makeup each day, so the daily cost would be:  
$250 x 6 = $1,500 per day  
Since the shoot lasted for 5 days, the total cost for all 5 days would be:  
$1,500 x 5 = $7,500  
Finally, since Jean received a 10% discount for the large volume of work, the final amount she paid would be:  
$7,500 x 90% = $6,750  
So Jean paid $6,750 for her makeup services."
Response:  To find out how much each person paid, we need to divide the total cost by three. Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98. So, each person paid $98 / 3 = $32.
Response:  To find out how much the cook spent, we need to multiply the number of vreća (4) by the weight of each vreća (50 pounds): 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Since the cost per kilogram is $1.50, we can calculate the total cost as follows: 200 pounds / 1.50 dollars/pound = $300. Therefore, the cook spent $300 on the lukas.
"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue ate than her sister, we need to calculate the difference between the number of calories she ate each day and the number of calories her sister ate. Let's start by listing the information given in the problem:

Ponedjeljak (Monday):

* Sue ate 4 times as much cake as her sister.
* Her sister ate 5 kolača (kolačići).

Utorak (Tuesday):

* Sue ate twice as much cake as her sister.
* Her sister ate 13 - 5 = 8 kolača (kolačići) (since her sister ate 5 on Monday).

Now let's calculate the total number of calories Sue ate each day:

Ponedjeljak (Monday):

* Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 kolača (kolačići)
* Total calories: 20 x 200 = 4000 calories

Utorak (Tuesday):

* Sue ate 2 x 8 = 16 kolača (kolačići)
* Total calories: 16 x 200 = 3200 calories

To find the difference in calories between the two days, subtract the total calories Sue ate on Tuesday from the total calories she ate on Monday:

Difference = 4000 - 3200 = 800 calories

So Sue ate 800 more calories on Monday than her sister did."
