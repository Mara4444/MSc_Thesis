"Response: 360
解釋:  According to the problem, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which means Toulouse has 2 x 4 = 8 more sheep than Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has 8 + 4 = 12 sheep. Similarly, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is: Toulouse (12) + Charleston (80) + Seattle (20) = 360."
"Response:  The load (in hours) required to download the file is:

Load = Total size of the file / Download speed

John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, which means he covers a distance of 60 x 3 = 180 miles. Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, which does not change his position. Finally, he drives for the last 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph, covering a distance of 80 x 2 = 160 miles. Therefore, John is 180 + 160 = 340 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."

First, calculate Eliza's regular earnings for the 40 hours she worked at a rate of $10 per hour: $10 x 40 = $400.
Then, calculate her overtime earnings for the additional 5 hours she worked at a rate of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate: ($10 x 1.2) x 5 = $60.
So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460."

### Part B: Calculating Percentage Change

The percentage change in the number of downloads from one month to the next can be calculated using the following formula:

Percentage change = (New value - Old value) / Old value × 100

Where ""New value"" is the number of downloads in the next month and ""Old value"" is the number of downloads in the previous month.

For example, if the number of downloads in the second month was 180, and the number of downloads in the third month was 150, what is the percentage change in the number of downloads between the second and third months?

根據問題，填出一個數值  答案:  Percentage change = (180 - 150) / 180 × 100 = -16.7%"

Since the jewelry option has a higher present value, it represents the better investment opportunity for the merchant. At the end of the month, the merchant can sell the jewelry for $5,000 and realize a profit of $375 ($5,000 - $4,975)."

"Response:  B) 19 liters
解釋:  First, let's calculate the total volume of both drinks before the spill:

Orange drink: 10 liters x 2/3 = 6.7 liters (since we spilled 1 liter)
Pineapple drink: 15 liters x 3/5 = 8.7 liters
Total volume before spill: 6.7 + 8.7 = 15.4 liters

Now, let's calculate the volume of the remaining drink after the spill:

Remaining orange drink: 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters
Remaining pineapple drink: 15 liters - 1 liter = 14 liters
Total volume after spill: 9 + 14 = 23 liters

Therefore, there are 23 liters of liquid left in the container."

"Response:  D = 21 miles

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. This means that for every mile she walks, she can run 4 miles in the same amount of time. So, if she runs at a rate of $x$ miles per hour, she can walk at a rate of $\frac{x}{4}$ miles per hour.
* She can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means that if she runs at a rate of $x$ miles per hour, she can skip at a rate of $\frac{x}{2}$ miles per hour.
* If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at a rate of $3 \times 4 = 12$ miles per hour.
* In six hours, she will spend one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Therefore, the total distance she will cover in six hours is:

Distance = Time x Rate (running) + Time x Rate (walking)
= 6 hours x 12 miles/hour + 6 hours x $\frac{3}{2}$ miles/hour
= 72 miles + 18 miles
= 90 miles

Therefore, Dana can travel 90 miles in six hours."

"Response:  The number of grams of chips that can be eaten in one day based on the given information is:

Total daily calorie target = 2000 calories
Already consumed calories = 1800 calories
Remaining calories for the day = Total daily calorie target - Already consumed calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag of chips, each serving contains:
Calories per serving = Number of grams x Calories per gram = 300 / 100 = 3 calories per gram

Therefore, the number of grams of chips that can be eaten in one day based on the given information is:
Remaining calories for the day / Calories per gram = 200 / 3 = 67 grams

So, you can eat approximately 67 grams of chips in one day while staying within your daily calorie target of 2000 calories if you have already consumed 1800 calories."

解釋:  According to the problem, Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, which took 4 hours per article for a total of 20 hours (5 x 4). Then, on Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote 3 articles (2/5 x 5 = 3). So, the total time spent writing articles on Tuesday was 12 hours (3 x 4). Finally, on Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means she wrote 6 articles (2 x 3 = 6), and the total time spent writing articles on Wednesday was 24 hours (6 x 4). Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days was 16 hours (20 + 12 + 24)"

15 pounds - (30 x 1/4 pound) = 9 pounds

Now, we also know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. So if Uriah wants to bring a total weight of 9 pounds in his book bag, he will need to remove:

9 pounds / 1/2 pound per toy = 18 toys

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 18 toys from his book bag."

"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the amount of gas left in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling it. Let's do this:

Gas left in tank = 12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons
Miles driven since last filling = 100 miles

Now, let's calculate the number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas:

Number of miles = Gas left in tank / Miles driven since last filling
= 8 gallons / 100 miles
= 0.8 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive approximately 0.8 miles per gallon on a single tank of gas."

解釋:
Gene has been going on vacations for 12 years (from age 23 to 34). Since he makes one quilt block per vacation, he has 12 rows of quilt blocks. Each row represents a year of vacations, so the number of quilt blocks in each row is equal to the number of vacations he took that year. Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:
12 rows x 4 vacations/row = 48 quilt blocks
Since each quilt block represents a single t-shirt, Gene has a total of 48 x 1 = 48 t-shirts used to make his quilt."

Now, since Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, and each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can calculate the number of tomatoes used as follows:
Number of tomatoes = Total volume of tomatoes / Volume of one tomato
= 8 ounces / 3 ounces per can

"Response:  $90,000 per day

解釋:

First, we need to calculate the total time spent by all patients in the hospital each day. Since there are 500 people seen per day, and each person spends an average of 24 minutes in the hospital, the total time spent in the hospital is:

500 people x 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes/day

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital from these visits. Since the doctors charge $150 per hour and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour, the total revenue can be calculated as follows:

Total revenue = Number of hours visited x Price per hour
= 12,000 minutes/day x ($150/hour)
= $180,000 per day

Finally, we need to subtract the cost of providing these services to determine the profit made by the hospital. This includes the salaries of the doctors and other staff, equipment costs, and any other expenses related to running the hospital. Let's assume that the hospital's overhead costs are $70,000 per day (this could include things like rent, utilities, insurance, etc.).

Profit = Total revenue - Overhead costs
= $180,000 - $70,000
= $110,000 per day

So, based on this calculation, the hospital makes a daily profit of $110,000 from seeing 500 people per day, with each person spending an average of 24 minutes in the hospital."

Similarly, for the second test, he took 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour, which means he spent 100/5 = 20 hours on the test. Since he had 6 hours to complete the second test, he left 6 - 20 = 4 hours of questions unanswered."

Explanation:
John bought the following items:

* Milk: $2
* Eggs: $3
* Light bulbs: $3
* Cups: $3
* Roach traps: $4

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 = $12

Total cost of non-food items = $4 + $3 = $7

Total cost = $12 + $7 = $19

Since there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, the total cost with tax = $19 x 1.10 = $21.90

Therefore, everything costed John $21.90."

* For the 3 people who came by with tricycles, each tire cost $0.25, so they paid a total of $0.75 ($0.25 x 3).
* The person on a unicycle only had one tire to inflate, which cost $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Shawnda made that day:
$1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 5 x 10 = 50 starfish.
Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Finally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.
Therefore, the total number of fish that both Anakin and Locsin caught is 19 + 50 + 3 + 5 = 78 fish."

"Response:  $19
解釋:  First, let's calculate the value of the doll. Since it costs as much as 3 action figures, the price of each action figure is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the price of the doll. Therefore, the price of each action figure is $5 \div 3 = 2$.
Next, let's calculate the value of the red cars. Each red car costs $4, so the total value of the 5 red cars is $5 \times 5 = 25$.
Finally, let's add up the values of all the toys: $2 + 25 = 27$. So, all the toys in the room together are worth $27$."

解釋:
Jackie can save $35/hour by doing her taxes herself, so if she spends 3 hours on her taxes, she'll save $105 ($35 x 3). However, the cost of hiring an accountant is $90, so hiring an accountant would actually save her $105 - $90 = $15. Therefore, hiring an accountant would result in a net savings of $15 for Jackie."

Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to know how many minutes it takes him to peel and cut each potato. Since it takes him about a minute and a half to peel a potato, and only about 5 seconds to cut it up, we can estimate that it takes him about 1 minute and 45 seconds (or 1 min 45 sec) to prepare each potato. So, to finish prepping all 60 potatoes, it will take Billy approximately 1 min 45 sec x 60 = 27 minutes.

解釋:
Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $1500 (since he earns $6000). Then he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is $2000 (since he earns $6000). So far, he has spent a total of $3500.
He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is $3000 ($6000 - $3500 = $2500).
He gives his daughter $200 to use for her weekly expenses.
He gives his wife $700 to budget for groceries and other household goods.
After all these expenses and donations, Zaid will have $5800 left ($6000 - $3500 - $200 - $700 = $5800)."

解釋:

Jerry is rolling a six-sided die, which means there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Let's consider the probability of each outcome:

* Rolling a number greater than 3: There are three numbers greater than 3 on the die (4, 5, and 6), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 0.5.
* Rolling two even numbers in a row: There are two pairs of even numbers on the die (2-2 and 4-4), so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 2/6 = 0.33.

Now, we want to know how much more likely it is that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 than that he will roll two even numbers in a row. To do this, we can simply subtract the probabilities of the two events:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 0.5 - 0.33 = 0.17 or 17%.

Therefore, it is about 17% more likely for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than that he will roll two even numbers in a row."

解釋:  On Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos (which is equal to 6), so now there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.  Then, on Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos, bringing the total number of pink flamingos to 12 + 18 = 30. Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 30 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, so he used 7 slices of cheese (2 slices/sandwich x 5 sandwiches). Then, he ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days, which means he used an additional 3 slices of cheese (1 slice/omelet x 3 omelets). Finally, he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that lasted him several dinners, which required 8 slices of cheese (8 slices/dish x 1 dinner). Therefore, Carl used a total of 14 slices of cheese throughout the week."

James is counting his Pokémon cards. He has 30 Fire-type, 20 Grass-type, and 40 Water-type. If he loses 8 of the Water-type and buys 14 Grass-type, what’s the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a Water-type?

Let X be the number of Water-type cards after losing 8 and buying 14 Grass-type cards.

X = 40 - 8 = 32

New ratio of Water-type cards to total cards = 32/160 = 0.20

Percentage chance of picking a Water-type card = 0.20 x 100 = 20%

Therefore, the answer is 20%."

"Response:  It will take them approximately 12 hours to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

Explanation:
Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so she can complete 4 x 60 = 240 pieces in an hour. Since her mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom can complete 240 / 2 = 120 pieces in an hour. Therefore, they will need 360 / 120 = 3 hours to complete the entire puzzle."

Explanation:
After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, which means 30% of 120 = 36 watermelons were ready.
When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which means 3/4 x 36 = 25 watermelons were ready.
So, there were 36 - 25 = 11 watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks."

解釋:
Mike is a penpal with 5 people and sends 2 letters per week to each person. Since there are 5 people, the total number of letters he sends per week is 10 letters (5 x 2 = 10).
Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he writes per week is 50 pages (10 letters x 5 pages/letter = 50 pages).
Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the time it takes him to write one page is 6 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes him to write all 50 pages is:
Time = Number of pages / Time per page
= 50 pages / 6 minutes/page
= 8.33 hours/week (round up to nearest whole number)
So, Mike spends approximately 8.33 hours per week writing letters to his pen pals."

Response:  Let's call the number of fish in Aquarium A x. Since there are 4 snails in Aquarium A, we know that x + 4 = 32 (the total number of creatures in Aquarium B). Now, since there are 32 snails in Aquarium B, we can write x + 4 = 64 (the total number of creatures in Aquarium B). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 16. So, there are 16 fish in Aquarium A and 48 fish in Aquarium B.

Explanation:

First, we need to calculate the total number of hours that the makeup artist worked on Jean during the 5-week movie shoot. Since the makeup artist works 6 hours per day, Monday through Friday, and there are 4 days of work per week, the total number of hours worked is:

6 hours/day x 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

Since the movie lasts for 5 weeks, the total number of hours worked by the makeup artist is:

24 hours/week x 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the makeup services based on the hourly rate charged by the makeup artist. If the makeup artist charges $250 per hour, then the total cost of the makeup services can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Hourly rate x Total number of hours worked
= $250/hour x 120 hours
= $30,000

However, since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount after the movie was finished, the final cost paid by Jean is:

Final cost = Total cost x (1 - Discount percentage)
= $30,000 x (1 - 0.10)
= $27,000

Therefore, Jean paid $27,000 for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot."
