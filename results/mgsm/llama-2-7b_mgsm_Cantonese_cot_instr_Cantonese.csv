Step 1：Calculate the total hours worked by Eliza this week。
Total hours = Number of working days x Number of hours per day
= 4 x 8
= 32 hours

Step 2： Calculate Eliza's hourly wage for regular work.
Regular hourly wage = Total hours x Hourly rate
= 32 hours x $10
= $320

Step 3：Calculate overtime pay for Eliza this week.
Overtime pay = Regular hourly wage x Overtime hours
= $320 x (Number of overtime hours / Total hours)
= $320 x ($15 / $32)
= $672

Step 4：Calculate Eliza's total earnings for this week.
Total earnings = Regular hourly wage + Overtime pay
= $320 + $672
= $992

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for this week are $992."

Firstly, let's calculate the total number of downloads in the first month. Since there are 60 downloads in the first month, we can assume that the average daily downloads is 60/30 = 2 downloads per day. Therefore, the total number of downloads in the first month is 2 x 30 = 60 downloads.

Next, let's calculate the total number of downloads in the third month. According to the problem statement, the number of downloads in the third month is 3 times the number of downloads in the first month, which means it is 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of downloads over the past three months. We know that the number of downloads in the second month is half of the number of downloads in the first month, which means it is 60 / 2 = 30 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads over the past three months is 60 + 30 + 180 = 370 downloads."

"  我哋一步一步諗下 估計 Jim 在四個星期內睇電視和睇書的時間。 

Step 1：Estimate the time spent on watching TV and reading books separately

Jim watches TV for 2 hours every day, Monday to Friday. Therefore, he spends a total of 8 hours/day x 5 days/week = 40 hours/week on watching TV.

He reads for 30 minutes every day, Monday to Friday. Therefore, he spends a total of 30 minutes/day x 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week on reading books.

So, in one week, Jim spends a total of 40 hours + 150 minutes = 190 hours on watching TV and reading books separately.

Step 2：Calculate the total time spent on watching TV and reading books together

Since Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads for 30 minutes every day, he spends a total of 2 hours + 30 minutes = 2.5 hours/day on both activities combined.

Therefore, over four weeks, Jim spends a total of 2.5 hours/day x 4 weeks = 10 hours/week on watching TV and reading books together.

Now we have estimated the total time spent by Jim on watching TV and reading books separately and together. Let's move on to the next step."

解釋：

首先，我們需要知道船的速度。根據問題中所言，每隻船翻返岸時，每行3米就要有2升水，這代表船的速度為3米/16秒=0.1875米/秒。

接下來，我們可以使用適當的公式計算船在漏咗水的情況：

$$ Distance = Speed x Time $$

其中，Distance是船在漏咗水的 distance，Speed是船的速度，Time是船在漏咗水的時間。

根據問題中所言，朱莉亞抵達岸邊的時間為64秒，而船在漏咗水的時間為16秒。因此，船在漏咗水的 distance 可以計算為 follows：

$$ Distance = 0.1875 x 16 = 2.96 meters $$

最後，我們可以 multiplied 船在漏咗水的 distance by the number of times it overflows to get the total amount of water that enters the boat：

$$ Total Water = Distance x Number of Overflows $$

根據問題中所言，每隻船翻返岸時，每行3米就要有2升水，這意味著船會被漏咗水 $NumberOfOverflows$ 次。因此，Total Water can be calculated as follows：

Finally, we need to find out how far he walked on Thursday. According to the problem, he walked 6 miles less on Thursday than he did on Monday, so he walked 6 - 6 = 0 miles (or 0 kilometers) on Thursday.

According to the problem, Kalinda can add four small blocks every second, so she can add 4 x 60 = 240 small blocks in one minute.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of blocks needed to complete the puzzle. Based on the problem, each puzzle piece is a half-degree larger than the previous one, so there are a total of 360 degrees worth of puzzle pieces. Therefore, the total number of blocks needed to complete the puzzle is 360 / 2 = 180 blocks.  Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Kalinda to complete the puzzle. Since she needs to add 180 blocks and can do so in one minute, it will take her 180 / 60 = 3 minutes to complete the puzzle.
" Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready to be harvested two weeks after Ashlin returned (based on the problem statement)

Number of watermelons ready to be harvested = Total number of watermelons x 2/5 = 90 x 2/5 = 48 watermelons

Therefore, there are 48 watermelons that were not yet ready to be harvested when Ashlin returned home."
" Add the registration fee for each car
$240,000 + (12 x $1,000) = $252,000

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $252,000 for all 12 cars."

 Number of insects = 100 x 3.14 = 314 insects.  Therefore, there are approximately 314 insects in the orchard.

" 12 / 3 = 4 trees per week. 

Therefore, Steve needs 4 weeks x 3 tomatoes/week = 12 trees to produce the number of tomatoes he ate in one day."
  Let's say there are 20 friends in total. Since John wants to make sure each person can have 4 slices of pizza, he will need a total of 80 slices (20 x 4 = 80). However, since the pizzas are sold by eights, John needs 5 whole pizzas (80 / 8 = 5). Therefore, John needs 5 pieces of pizza.

"

Initially, Johnny had $20 + $10 = $30 in total.
After one year, his investment grew by three times its original value, so the new value of his investment is $30 x 3 = $90.
Therefore, Johnny has $90 now."
 5 + 2 = 7 years old.
  我哋一步一步諗下 解釋：  (A) 的學生 = 1000 - 30% = 700  (B) 的學生 = 700 x 3/5 = 280  (C) 的學生 = 700 x 2/5 = 420  Therefore, there are 280 students who will exit through door B and 420 students who will exit through door C.

"

18,000 minutes - (10 minutes/day) \* 30 days = 14,400 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 14,400 minutes left after using 300 minutes with other people."
"  我哋一步一步諗下 解釋： 

1. 比利嘅藥量係凱爾嘅兩倍 Ginger 俾 Griffin 一堆，意思是比利將凱爾的藥量兩倍加到格里芬上。
2. 而Colby 佢比 Kyle 咗嘅少三條，意思是Colby 剩下了 Kyle 的三條藥量。
3. 最後葛里芬有27個，意思是格里芬最後有 27 個藥量。

因此，格里芬最後有 27 - (2 x 5) = 27 - 10 = 17 個藥量。"

  我哋一步一步諗下 Jean 的化師每天可以花費 $250 美金，共6小時。每個星期，化師需要4次整化，共8小時。完成一部電影需要5个星期，共40小時。如果 Jean 完成了好多工作，他就可以得到$10\%$的折扣，等同於$40\%$的折扣。因此，Jean 當前可以得到的折扣是：$40\%\times40小時=160小時$。
