According to the second friend, there are more than half of the total balls (i.e., 20 + 1 = 21) in the top half of the jar. Therefore, the number of balls in the bottom half of the jar is 80 - 21 = 59. Since the third friend says that the number of balls in the jar is an integer between 25 and 30 (inclusive), we can narrow down the possible ranges for the number of balls as follows: {25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30}. Among these values, 29 is the closest to the actual value of 46, so the answer is 46.

After 20 years, the company offers a 5% raise every year, which means that Marsie's annual salary would be $52,000 ($50,000 x 1.05^20) after 20 years. Since Marsie stopped working at age 60, her final annual salary would be $52,000 x 3 = $156,000. Therefore, Marsie's total lifetime earnings from the company are $2,000,000 + $156,000 = $2,156,000."

The cost of each bunch of 3 flowers is $2.50 and the cost of each bunch of 6 flowers is $1.00. To find out how much money Vincent can save by buying in bulk, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers in different quantities.

If Vincent buys 3 bunches of 6 flowers each, he will pay $3 \* 3 = $9 for the first batch, and $1 \* 6 = $6 for the second batch, making the total cost $9 + $6 = $15.

If Vincent buies 3 bunches of 3 flowers each, he will pay $3 \* 3 = $9 for the first batch, and $2 \* 3 = $6 for the second batch, making the total cost $9 + $6 = $15.

Therefore, by buying in bulk, Vincent can save $15 - ($9 + $6) = $4.50."

Response: 120 liters. Explanation: According to the question, it took 20 seconds for the water to flow from Julie's boat to the shore, which is 64 feet away. Therefore, the distance traveled by the water in that time was 20 x 64 = 1280 feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we can convert this distance to yards as follows: 1280 feet / 3 = 426 yards. Now, since each liter of water weighs 1 kilogram, and there were 120 liters of water in the boat, we can calculate the weight of the water as follows: 120 liters x 1 kg/liter = 120 kilograms. Finally, we can divide the weight of the water by the distance traveled to find out how much water filled up the boat: 120 kilograms / 426 yards = approximately 28 gallons. So, at any given moment during the 20-second period, the boat would have held approximately 28 gallons of water.

"Response: 24 miles
Explanation:
The speed of the train is given as 10 mph for the first 3 hours, and then it decreases to 8 km/h for the remaining time. To find out how many miles the train travels in total, we need to convert both speeds to miles per hour and then add them up.

For the first 3 hours, the train travels at 10 mph, which means it covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 mph x 3 hours = 30 miles

After that, the train travels at 8 km/h, which means it covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 8 km/h x 5 hours = 40 kilometers

To convert kilometers to miles, we can use the conversion factor of 1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles. So, the distance traveled by the train after the initial 3 hours is:

Distance = 40 kilometers x 0.621371 miles/kilometer = 24.44 miles

Therefore, the total distance traveled by the train is:

Total distance = 30 miles + 24.44 miles = 54.44 miles"

"Response: 30000 USD/day (approximately)
Explanation:
The total number of patients in the hospital per day is 500. Each patient spends an average of 24 minutes with the doctor, which means that the doctors see 500 x 24 = 12,000 patients per day.
The doctors charge $150 per hour and spend 8 hours with each patient, so they earn $150 x 8 = $1200 per patient. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the doctors per day is $1200 x 12,000 = $144,000.
Similarly, the nurses charge $200 per hour and spend 4 hours with each patient, so they earn $200 x 4 = $800 per patient. The total revenue generated by the nurses per day is therefore $800 x 12,000 = $96,000.
Adding up the revenues from both the doctors and the nurses, we get a total revenue of $236,000 per day for the entire hospital."

Response:  The time taken by Tim to reach his home from school will be less than the time taken by Steve to reach his home from school. Therefore, Tim will reach his home before Steve does. Let's assume that Tim takes x minutes to reach his home and Steve takes y minutes to reach his home. Since Tim is closer to his home than Steve, we can say that x < y. Now, we know that Tim covers 2 miles in 1 minute, so he covers 2x miles in total to reach his home. Similarly, Steve covers 3 miles in 1 minute, so he covers 3y miles in total to reach his home. We also know that Tim reaches his home before Steve does, so the time taken by Tim to reach his home must be less than the time taken by Steve to reach his home. Therefore, we can write: x < y. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 24 and y = 36. So, Tim takes 24 minutes to reach his home and Steve takes 36 minutes to reach his home.

"Response:  To calculate the total number of oranges required to feed all the birds in Chidiya Ghar for 2 months, we need to consider the following information:

* Number of birds in Chidiya Ghar = 500 (as per the question)
* Amount of orange juice required per bird per day = 20 ml (as given in the question)
* Total number of days in 2 months = 60 days (2 months x 30 days/month)

Now, let's calculate the total amount of orange juice required to feed all the birds in Chidiya Ghar for 2 months:

Total amount of orange juice required = Number of birds x Orange juice requirement per bird x Number of days
= 500 x 20 x 60
= 60,000 ml

Since there are 100 ml in 1 liter, we can convert the total amount of orange juice required to liters as follows:

Total amount of orange juice required in liters = 60,000 ml / 100 ml/liter
= 600 liters

Therefore, to feed all the birds in Chidiya Ghar for 2 months, they would require approximately 600 liters of orange juice."

Since Black moves forward for 15 minutes, it covers a distance of 15 x 60 = 900 meters during that time. Similarly, since Kelli moves ahead for 40 meters and returns, she covers a total distance of 40 + (-40) = 0 meters. Therefore, the difference in distance covered by Black and Kelli is 900 - 0 = 900 meters."

Explanation:
The number of lilies that Fred can deliver in 5 hours is given by the equation:
Number of lilies = Total number of lilies / Time taken to deliver (in hours)
Given that Sandra has delivered 200 lilies in 4 hours, we can calculate the time taken to deliver each lily as follows:
Time taken to deliver one lily = Total number of lilies / Number of lilies delivered (in hours) = 200/4 = 5 hours
Now, we need to find out how many lilies Fred can deliver in 5 hours. To do this, we divide the total number of lilies by the time taken to deliver each lily:
Number of lilies = Total number of lilies / Time taken to deliver each lily = 17643 / 5 = 17643
Therefore, Fred can deliver 17643 lilies in 5 hours."

Each friend spent $4.50 less than the cost of their meal on tickets for the show, so each friend paid $60.75 - $4.50 = $56.25 for the tickets.
Since they went to two different shows and paid differently for each show, the total amount spent by each friend will be twice the cost of their ticket plus the cost of their meal. Therefore, the total amount spent by each friend is $56.25 + $4.50 = $60.75."

If he allows 50 more customers than the previous day (which had 50 customers), then the number of customers in the next day will be 100 + 50 = 150. Since there were 500 customers in total over three days, and Slone allowed 150 customers in the third day, the number of customers he allowed in each day is:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 150 customers
Day 3: 150 customers / 3 = 50 customers per day
Therefore, the answer is 350."
Response: 16 liters. Explanation: According to the given information, there are two large pots and four small pots. Each large pot contains 8 gallons of water, and each small pot contains 2 gallons of water. Therefore, in total, there are 8 + 4 = 12 gallons of water in the large pots. Since the small pots have twice as much water as the large pots, there are 12 x 2 = 24 gallons of water in the small pots. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of water are left in the small pot after 4 minutes. As per the question, the rate at which water is flowing from the big pot into the small pot is equal to the rate at which water is flowing from the small pot into the big pot. So, if 4 gallons of water were transferred from the big pot to the small pot in 4 minutes, then the same amount of water (i.e., 4 gallons) must have been transferred from the small pot to the big pot during the same period. Therefore, the number of gallons of water left in the small pot after 4 minutes is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

Explanation:
Jennet agreed to invest $2000 for 12 months at an interest rate of 10%. After 12 months, Jennet will receive $165 per month as interest, which means that the total amount earned by Jennet is:

Total Amount = Number of Months x Interest Per Month
= 12 x $165
= $2040

So, after 12 months, Jennet's account balance will be:

Account Balance = Initial Investment + Total Amount Earned
= $2000 + $2040
= $4040

Therefore, the value of Jennet's account after 12 months is $4040."
