"Response:  We know that Janet sells her extra eggs at $2 each and she has 16 eggs per day (since the patos de Janet lay 16 eggs daily). So if we multiply 16 by $2, we get:

$2 x 16 = $32

So, Janet earns $32 per day from selling her extra eggs in the farmer's market."
Response:  We know that one bolt of blue fabric has 2 rolls, so if we want to make 3 bolts in total (1 blue and 2 white), we need 2 x 3 = 6 rolls of blue fabric. Since each roll is half of what we need for one bolt, we need 6 / 2 = 3 rolls of white fabric as well. Therefore, we need a total of 3 + 3 = 6 rolls of fabric.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much Josh spent in total for the house and renovations. Then we can subtract that amount from the new value of the house to find out his profit.

Total cost = Purchase price + Renovation costs
= $80,000 + $50,000
= $130,000

New value of the house = $130,000 x 1.15 (150% increase)
= $149,500

Profit = New value - Total cost
= $149,500 - $130,000
= $19,500

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $19,500 from remodeling and selling the house."
Response:  We know that James runs three races of speed three times a week (so 9 races per week). Each race is 60 meters long, so he covers a total distance of 9 x 60 = 540 meters per week.
"Response:  We know that each chicken needs three cups of feed per day and there are 20 chickens in total. So we need to calculate how many cups of feed are needed for all 20 chickens at once. To do this, we can multiply the number of chickens by the amount of food they need per day:  

20 x 3 = 60 cups of feed per day. 
Therefore, Wendi will need to give her flock of 20 chickens 60 cups of feed during their last meal of the day."
Response:  We know that each second vase costs 60% of the first vase price. So if the first vase costs $5, then the second vase will cost $5 x 60% = $3. If Kylar wants to buy 16 vasos, she needs to pay for 16 x $3 = $48.
"Response:  We know that in Toulouse there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston and four times more than in Seattle. So if we let T be the number of sheep in Toulouse, C be the number of sheep in Charleston, and S be the number of sheep in Seattle, we can write the following equations based on the information given:
T = 2C... (1)
C = 4S... (2)
We also know that there are 20 sheep in Seattle, so we can write:
S = 20... (3)
Now we have three equations and three unknowns. Can you use these equations to find out how many sheep there are in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle?"
"Response:  We know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute and it takes 20 minutes for Windows to install updates. So we need to calculate how much time she spends downloading before the update installation.  
Time spent downloading = Total size / Download speed  
Time spent downloading = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute  
Time spent downloading = 100 minutes  
Now, after installing updates, she needs to restart her computer and start from scratch. Therefore, the total time taken to download the file will be:  
Total time = Time spent downloading + Time spent installing updates  
Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes  
Total time = 120 minutes  
Therefore, the total time taken to download the 200 GB file would be approximately 120 minutes or 2 hours."
"Response:  We know that John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour (mph) to reach his destination. Then he realizes he forgot something important and turns back. He spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, driving at a slow pace of 30 mph. Finally, he continues driving for another 2 hours at a constant speed of 80 mph. To find out how far from home John is after those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance traveled during each leg of the journey.  
1st Leg (forward): Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles  
2nd Leg (backward): Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 2 hours = 60 miles  
Total Distance = 180 miles + 60 miles = 240 miles So, after 4 hours, John is 240 miles away from his house."
"Response:  We know that Eliza earns $10 per hour for her first 40 hours of work each week and then she gets paid an overtime rate of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate for any additional hours worked. So if she works more than 40 hours in a week, she will get paid at the overtime rate for those extra hours.  
Now we are given that Eliza worked 45 hours this week. If she worked exactly 40 hours at her regular rate, that would be:
40 hours x $10/hour = $400
And if she worked 5 hours at the overtime rate (since there were 5 hours beyond the 40-hour mark), that would be:
5 hours x $10 x 1.2 = $60
So altogether, Eliza earned:
$400 + $60 = $460
This week, Eliza earned $460."
"Response:  We know that in the first month there were 60 downloads and in the second month there were three times as many downloads (i.e., 3 x 60 = 180). In the third month, there was a reduction of 30%, so we need to subtract 30% of 180 from 180. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:

180 - (30/100) x 180 = 180 - 54 = 126

So, the total number of downloads during the three months is:

60 + 180 + 126 = 366

Therefore, the program had 366 downloads during the three months."
"Response:  We know that Toula bought three dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, so she spent:

$68 x 3 = $204

On mini pastelitos, she bought two dozen at $80 per dozen, so she spent:

$80 x 2 = $160

And finally, she bought six dozen tortitas de queso at $55 per dozen, so she spent:

$55 x 6 = $330

Adding all these amounts together gives us the total amount Toula spent:

$204 + $160 + $330 = $794

So Toula spent a total of $794."
"Response:  The tree will start producing lemons after 4 years (since it takes 3 years for the tree to mature). So we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend during those 4 years and then add that amount to the price of the lemons to see when he will start making a profit.

Year 1: Carlos spends $90 on planting the tree.
Year 2-3: Carlos spends $3 per year on irrigation and fertilization. Total spent = $3 x 3 = $9.
Year 4: Carlos starts harvesting lemons and sells them at $1.5 each. He sells 7 lemons per year, so his income is $1.5 x 7 = $10.5. But he still has to pay $9 from previous years' expenses, so his net profit is $10.5 - $9 = $1.5.

Therefore, Carlos will begin earning a profit with his lemon tree in Year 4."
Response:  We know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house and two more at the red house. So she has sold (1/3) + 2 = 5/3 vacuum cleaners. Since she has 5 left, we can set up an equation:  5 - 5/3 = 0. Solving for the original number of vacuum cleaners, we get:  15. Therefore, Melanie had 15 vacuum cleaners at the beginning.
"Response:  We know that 20% of the students signed up for contemporary dance and 25% of the remaining students (i.e., those who did not sign up for contemporary dance) signed up for jazz dance. So we can start by finding out how many students did not sign up for contemporary dance.  

Let X be the number of students who did not sign up for contemporary dance. Then we have:  
X + (20/100)X = 100 - 20  
X + 20X = 80  
3X = 640  
X = 213  
So there are 213 students who did not sign up for contemporary dance. Now we need to find out how many of them signed up for hip-hop dance.  

We know that 25% of these students signed up for hip-hop dance. Therefore, we can multiply 213 by 25/100 to get the number of students who signed up for hip-hop dance:  
213 x 25/100 = 53.25  
Therefore, 53 students signed up for hip-hop dance.  
Now we can calculate the percentage of students who signed up for hip-hop dance as follows:  
(53/2090) x 100% = 25.27%  
So approximately 25.27% of the students in the class signed up for hip-hop dance."
Response:  We know that the value of the jewelry will increase by 2.5% and the value of electronic devices will increase by 1.2%. So if we buy jewelry for $5000, it will be worth $5000 x 1.025 = $5125 after one month. If we buy electronic devices for $8000, they will be worth $8000 x 1.012 = $8096 after one month. Therefore, the maximum gain would be $5125 - $8096 = -$2971 or approximately $-3000.
"Response:  The first day, both trains travel west for 80 miles. So, if we call the distance traveled by Train A x and Train B y, then we know that x + y = 80 (since they both traveled the same distance). 
The next day, both trains turn north and travel for 150 miles. We can write an equation based on what we know so far:
x + y + x + y = 150...(1)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 40
y = 60
So, Train A traveled 40 miles west and 60 miles north, while Train B traveled 60 miles west and 40 miles north."
"Response:  We know that Jill works as a teacher for 50 weeks per year and earns $20 per hour. She also works as a fitness coach for 15 hours per week at $30 per hour. To calculate her total annual income, we need to add up all of these amounts.
First, let's calculate her income from teaching:
50 weeks x 35 hours/week = 1750 hours/year x $20/hour = $35,000/year (teaching income)
Next, let's calculate her income from coaching:
15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week x 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year (coaching income)
Now, let's add up both incomes to get Jill's total annual salary:
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500/year
Therefore, Jill's total annual salary is $57,500."
Response:  We know that Claire makes 1 dozen eggs (dozen) per day and she does this for 28 days in 4 weeks or 4 weeks x 28 days = 112 days. So, if we multiply 1 dozen eggs/day x 112 days, we get 112 dozens of eggs eaten by Claire in 4 weeks!
"Response:  We know that Marissa walked at a rate of 4 miles per hour for the first 4 miles and then at a rate of 3 miles per hour for the next 2 miles. To find her average speed over the entire distance, we need to calculate her total time and divide it by the total distance traveled. 
First, let's calculate her time for the first 4 miles:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles/hour  
Time = 1 hour  
Now, let's calculate her time for the remaining 8 miles:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = 8 miles / 3 miles/hour  
Time = 2.67 hours (rounded to 2 hours)  
Total Time = Time for first 4 miles + Time for remaining 8 miles  
Total Time = 1 hour + 2 hours  
Total Time = 3 hours  
Next, let's calculate her average speed:  
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time  
Average Speed = 12 miles / 3 hours  
Average Speed = 4 miles/hour  
Therefore, Marissa must walk at a rate of 4 miles per hour for the remainder of the hike to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike."
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange soda that contains two-thirds water and three-fifths piña colada soda. To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we need to subtract the amount of orange soda from the total volume.

First, let's calculate the amount of orange soda:

10 liters x (2/3) = 6.67 liters (orange soda)

Now, let's subtract the amount of orange soda from the total volume:

24 liters - 6.67 liters = 17.33 liters (remaining volume)

Since we know that three-fifths of the piña colada soda is water, we can calculate the amount of water in the remaining volume as follows:

17.33 liters x (3/5) = 9.8 liters (water)

Therefore, there are approximately 9.8 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of soda."
Response:  We know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond must be 31 + 6 = 37 years old. Since Raymond had his child at age 23, that means his child was born when Raymond was 23 - 6 = 17 years old. Therefore, the child of Raymond is now 17 + 31 = 48 years old.
Response:  We know that the first three clients buy one DVD each, so we can start with 3. The next two clients buy two DVDs each, so we add 2 x 2 = 4 to our total. Now we have 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs sold. But wait! There are still three more clients who didn't buy any DVDs, so we subtract 0 (since they didn't buy anything) from our total. Therefore, the final answer is 7 - 0 = 7 DVDs sold on Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that the vela burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So if we want to find out how many more centimeters it will be after burning for 5 hours (from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm), we need to multiply the number of hours by the rate of burning. Therefore, the length of the vela after 5 hours will be:  

2 cm/hour x 5 hours = 10 cm  
So, the vela will be 10 cm shorter after burning from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm."
"Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a 25% discount. So we can start by finding out what the original price of the book was before the discount. To do this, we can use the following formula:

Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50, and the discount percentage is 25%. Plugging in these values, we get:

Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26

So the original price of the book was $26 before the 25% discount."
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 in total and she bought some boxes of pizza. So we can start by writing an equation based on what we know:  
Let C be the number of boxes of pizza Marie purchased. Since each box costs $8.50, we can write:  
C x $8.50 = $50  
Now let's add up all the other items Marie bought:  
Pollo: $12  
Leche (5 cajas): $3 x 5 = $15  
Maná (4): $1.50 x 4 = $6  
Total: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33  
Since Marie paid a total of $50, we can set up another equation:  
$33 + C = $50  
Now solve for C by adding both equations:  
C x $8.50 + $33 = $50  
C = 6  
So Marie purchased 6 boxes of pizza if each box costs $8.50."
"Response:  We know that Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, so she spent 3 x $16.50 = $49.50 on shorts. She also bought 3 pairs of pants and each pair costs $22.50, so she spent 3 x $22.50 = $67.50 on pants. Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes and each pair costs $42, so she spent 3 x $42 = $126 on shoes. In total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Question: If Mishka had only bought one pair of each type of clothing item (shorts, pants, and shoes), how much would she have paid in total? 
Based on the information provided, formulate an answer. 
Answer: If Mishka had only bought one pair of each type of clothing item, she would have paid for one pair of shorts at $16.50, one pair of pants at $22.50, and one pair of shoes at $42. Therefore, she would have paid a total of $16.50 + $22.50 + $42 = $81."
Response:  If Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every night for 60 days, then she will eat a total of 60 portions of ice cream. Since each box contains 15 portions, she will need to buy 60/15 = 4 boxes of ice cream. Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent $4 x 4 = $16 on ice cream.
"Response:  We know that Henry rode his bike for 60 miles in total. He stopped for the first time after riding for 20 miles. So he rode for 40 miles before taking his second break. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can calculate how far he rode between the two stops as follows:  

40 miles (from the start to the first stop) + 15 miles = 55 miles

Therefore, Henry rode 55 miles between his first and second stops."
"Response:  We know that two pairs of high-heeled shoes cost five dollars less than the boots. So if we let X be the price of one pair of high heels, then the total cost of both pairs would be 2X. Since they are five dollars cheaper than the boots, the total cost of both pairs plus the boots is equal to the cost of the boots alone. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:  

2X + 5 = B (where B is the cost of the boots)

Now we know that one pair of high heels costs X and the other pair costs twice as much, so the total cost of all three options is:  

2X + X = 3X + 5

Simplifying this equation gives us:  

3X = B + 5

Solving for X, we get:  

X = (B + 5)/3

So now we have found out how much each pair of high heels costs! Now we need to find out how much the boots cost. To do this, we substitute X into our first equation:  

2(B/3) + 5 = B

This simplifies to:  

2B/3 + 5 = B

Which is true because we added five dollars to the cost of the boots but didn't change their original value. Therefore, we can solve for B:  

B = 60

So the boots cost sixty dollars. The two pairs of high heels together cost:  

2(B/3) = 2(60/3) = 40

And each pair costs:  

B/3 = 60/3 = 20

Therefore, the two pairs of high heels cost forty dollars in total, or twenty dollars per pair."
"Response:  We know that the ratio of their ages is 7 to 11, so we can write an equation based on this information. If Darrel is 7x years old and Allen is 11x years old, then together they are 7x + 11x = 162 years old. Simplifying the equation, we get:  
7x + 11x = 162  
18x = 162  
x = 9  
So, Darrel is 7x = 7(9) = 63 years old and Allen is 11x = 11(9) = 99 years old. Now, if we want to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years, we can simply add 10 to his current age:  
Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109 years old."
"Response:  We know that the first friend said there were 80 caramelos de goma in the jar. The second friend said there were 20 more than half of the first amount, which is:

20 + (half of 80) = 20 + 40 = 60

So, the second friend thinks there are 60 caramelos de goma in the jar. Now, let's see what the third friend said. He said there was a 25% increase over the first amount, so we can calculate it as follows:

80 x 1.25 = 100

So, the third friend thinks there are 100 caramelos de goma in the jar. To find the average, we add all three amounts and divide by 3:

(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = (240) / 3 = 80

Therefore, the average number of caramelos de goma that Gunter's friends think are in the jar is 80."
"Response:  We know that John has 10 dogs and he spends half an hour with each dog every day. So, in one day, John spends:

10 dogs x 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now we need to find out how many hours per week John dedicates to taking care of his dogs. There are 7 days in a week, so:

5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John dedicates 35 hours per week to caring for his 10 dogs."
"Response:  We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So if we let X be the number of silver coins, then the number of gold coins is X + 30. 
We also know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
X + (X + 30) = 110
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2X + 30 = 110
Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:
2X = 80
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
X = 40
So Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins."
"Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's joys, so let's find out how many joyas Raymond has first. 
Raymond has 40 joyas, and we know that Aaron has 5 more than half of them. So, if we divide 40 into two parts, one part will be half of 40, which is 20. 
Aaron has 5 more than 20, so he has 20 + 5 = 25 joyas. Now, since Siobhan has 2 less than Aaron, she has 25 - 2 = 23 joyas. Therefore, Siobhan has 23 joyas."
Response:  We know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike gained 4 points for each minute he played. So if we multiply 4 by 20, we get 80 points. Now let's look at the second part of the problem. In the last 20 minutes, Mike gained an additional 25% more points than what he gained in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he gained in those 20 minutes, we can use the following formula: (4 x 20) + (25% of 4 x 20). Plugging in the numbers, we get: 80 + (25% of 4 x 20) = 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100 points. Therefore, Mike gained a total of 180 points during his 40-minute game of Pong.
Response:  We know that Terry buys 2 yogurts per day and there are 30 days in a month. So, he will buy 60 yogurts in total (2 x 30). Now we know that 4 yogurts cost $5, so Terry will spend $5 x 60 = $300 on yogurt for one month.
"Response:  We know that John has 13 Lego games and sells each one for $15. If he sells all of them, he will have $180 (13 x $15). He then spends this money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, so he pays $160 (8 x $20). Now he has $5 left over ($180 - $160 = $5). So, John has 5 Lego games left after selling all of them and buying new video games.  
Numeric Answer: 5"
"Response:  We know that John runs for 3 days a week and each day he runs for a certain number of hours. Let's start by finding out how many hours John runs in total per week.

Total hours per week = (3 days/week) x (3 hours/day) = 9 hours/week

Now we need to find out how far John runs in one hour. To do this, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time. Since we know John runs for 3 hours at a time, let's call his speed ""S"". Then, we can write:

distance = S x 3 hours

We also know that John runs for 9 hours per week, so we can substitute this value into our previous equation:

9 hours/week = S x 3 hours

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for S (John's speed) and the distance he covers in one hour?"
"Response:  We know that Dana can run at four times her walking speed, so if she walks at x miles per hour, she runs at 4x miles per hour. Since she jumps at half of her running speed, she jumps at 2x miles per hour. 
We also know that Dana can jump for three miles per hour, so we set up an equation based on this information:  
Let X represent the number of miles Dana can walk in one hour. Then, we have:  
Walking Speed = X Miles/Hour  
Running Speed = 4X Miles/Hour  
Jumping Speed = 2X Miles/Hour  
Since Dana spends two-thirds of her time walking and one-third of her time running, we need to calculate how far she travels during each segment of her journey:  
Walking Distance = (2/3) x X x Hours = 2X x Hours  
Running Distance = (1/3) x 4X x Hours = 4X x Hours  
Jumping Distance = (1/3) x 2X x Hours = 2X x Hours  
Now let's substitute some numbers. If Dana can walk for six hours, then she will cover:  
Walking Distance = 2X x 6 = 12X Miles  
If she runs for one hour, she will cover:  
Running Distance = 4X x 1 = 4X Miles  
And if she jumps for one hour, she will cover:  
Jumping Distance = 2X x 1 = 2X Miles  
Now we need to find out what value of X gives us the correct total distance traveled. To do this, we add all three distances together:  
Total Distance = Walking Distance + Running Distance + Jumping Distance  
= 12X + 4X + 2X  
= 18X Miles  
So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18X miles. Now we just need to solve for X. We know that Dana can jump for three miles per hour, so we can set up"
Response:  We know that the iPhone of Ben is two times older than the iPhone of Suzy, so if the iPhone of Suzy has one year, then the iPhone of Ben has two years. Now we need to find out how old is the iPhone of Brandon compared to the iPhone of Ben. We are told that the iPhone of Brandon is four times older than the iPhone of Ben, so if the iPhone of Ben has two years, then the iPhone of Brandon has eight years (2 x 4 = 8). Therefore, the iPhone of Brandon has eight years.
"Response:  We know that without the stone of Zirconia, Polly can throw the golden spear to a distance of 400 feet, which is within the range of the dragon's flames. So we need to find out how far from the dragon Polly could stand and still hit it with the golden spear if she had the stone of Zirconia.
We are given that when Polly has the stone of Zirconia, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when she doesn't have it. Therefore, if Polly stands at a distance of x feet from the dragon (where x is a positive number), she will be able to throw the javelin to a distance of 3x feet.
Since the dragon's flames extend for 1000 feet, we want to find out how far from the dragon Polly must stand so that the javelin lands outside the reach of the flames. In other words, we want to find out what value of x will make 3x greater than or equal to 1000.
Solving this inequality, we get:

3x >= 1000

x >= 333

So Polly needs to stand at least 333 feet away from the dragon to be safe from its flames and still be able to hit it with the golden spear."
"Response:  We know that each pastel was cut into 8 portions and there were five pastels in total. So, we can calculate the total number of portions as follows:

Total number of portions = Number of pastels x Number of portions per pastel
= 5 x 8
= 40 portions

Now, we are told that after all the invitees served themselves and ate their portions, there were 14 remaining portions left on the table. To find out how many portions the invitees ate, we can subtract the number of remaining portions from the total number of portions:

Number of portions eaten = Total number of portions - Number of remaining portions
= 40 - 14
= 26 portions

Therefore, the invitees ate 26 portions of pastel."
"Response:  We know that one serving of fries has 250 calories and there are five servings in the bag (since it weighs 300g). So, if our daily calorie goal is 2000 calories and we have already consumed 1800 calories, how many more calories can we eat from these fries?  
To find out, let's subtract the number of calories we have already eaten (1800) from our daily calorie goal (2000):  
2000 - 1800 = 200  
So, we can eat 200 additional calories from the fries. Since each serving contains 250 calories, we can calculate how much of the bag we can eat as follows:  
200 / 250 = 0.8 or 8/10 of the bag  
Therefore, we can eat 8/10 of the bag, which is equivalent to 240g (8 x 300g)."
"Response:  We know that Charlie needs to buy one pound of wax and wicks for each vela she wants to make. So if she makes 10 velas with one pound of wax, she will use up all the wax. If she wants to make 20 velas, she will need two pounds of wax (2 x 10 = 20).

We also know that the cost of one pound of wax and wicks is $10. So the total cost of making 20 velas would be:

$10 x 2 = $20

Now we know that Charlie sells each vela for $2.00, so her revenue from selling 20 velas would be:

$2 x 20 = $40

Finally, we can calculate her profit as follows:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $40 - $20
= $20

So Charlie's net gain or profit from making and selling 20 velas would be $20."
"Response:  We know that Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and twice as many on Tuesday (i.e., 2 x 5 = 10). On Wednesday, she wrote double the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 x 10 = 20. In total, Meredith wrote 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 articles during the three days.  
Now, let's calculate the time spent on each article. According to the problem statement, it takes an average of 4 hours to research and write each article. So, we can calculate the total time spent on all 35 articles as follows:  
Total time = Number of articles x Average time per article  
= 35 x 4  
= 140 hours  
Therefore, Meredith dedicated 140 hours to writing her articles over the course of those three days."
"Response:  We know that Candice had 80 sticky notes in her bag before she went to work and she used 210 (220 - 20) sticky notes at work. So, if she has 23 sticky notes left, we can subtract 210 from 80 to find out how many were in the package she bought:  
80 - 210 = 23  
Solution: There were 57 sticky notes in the package that Candice bought."
"Response:  We know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. So if he bought x blue ties, he bought 2x red ties. The total amount of money John spent on all ties is $200. 
We also know that each blue tie costs $40 and each red tie costs $40 x 1.5 = $60. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  

$200 = (2x + x) \* (40 + 60)

Simplifying the equation:

$200 = 3x \* 100

Solving for x:

$200 / 3x = 100

$200 / 3(2x + x) = 100

$200 / (2x + 2x + x) = 100

$200 / 5x = 100

x = $40

Therefore, John spent $40 on blue ties and $80 on red ties, for a total of $120."
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to tie up her tomato plants in the garden. She cut it into pieces of 6 inches each. So we can start with the fact that she had one piece of wire that was 4 feet long. 

Now let's convert the length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:

4 feet x 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Since Tracy cut the wire into pieces of 6 inches each, we can divide the total length by the size of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

So Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire, each measuring 6 inches long."
"Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 units. So, if 3/4 of the building is occupied, then we can calculate the number of vacant units as follows:

Total number of units = Number of floors x Number of units per floor
= 15 x 8
= 120

Now, since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to get the number of vacant units:

Number of vacant units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units
= 120 - (3/4) x 120
= 120 - 90
= 30

Therefore, there are 30 vacant units in the building."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day, Lloyd sells 252 eggs at $2 per dozen. So, we can calculate how much he earns in a day as follows:  

Total number of eggs sold per day = 252 (dozen) x 12 (eggs/dozen) = 3024 eggs/day  
Total daily income = 3024 eggs/day x $2/dozen = $6048/day  
Now, let's find out how much Lloyd earns in a week:  
Weekly income = Daily income x Number of days in a week = $6048/day x 7 days/week = $42,304/week  
Therefore, Lloyd earns $42,304 per week with the sale of his eggs."
"Response:  We know that Tom can navigate at 10 miles per hour and he navigates for 4 hours (from 1 pm to 4 pm). So we need to calculate how many miles he travels during this time.  

First, let's convert the time from hours to minutes: 4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes  
Now, let's multiply the distance traveled by the speed: 240 minutes x 10 miles/hour = 2400 miles  
So, Tom travels 2400 miles in 4 hours. Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to return at a speed of 6 miles per hour.  

Let's use the same formula as before: 

Distance = Speed x Time 
Time = Distance / Speed 

We know the distance he needs to cover is 2400 miles, but now he is navigating at 6 miles per hour instead of 10 miles per hour. So, we can plug in the numbers: 

Time = 2400 miles / 6 miles/hour = 400 hours or 6700 minutes 

Therefore, it would take Tom 6700 minutes or approximately 111.67 hours to return home if he navigated at a constant speed of 6 miles per hour."
"Response:  We know that the total weight of the books in Uriah's bag is 15 pounds (lb). The weight of each comic book is 1/4 lb and the weight of each toy is 1/2 lb. So we can start by calculating how many comic books and toys are in the bag.  
First, let's calculate the number of comic books:  
15 lbs / 1/4 lb = 60 comic books  
Now, let's calculate the number of toys:  
15 lbs / 1/2 lb = 30 toys  
So there are 60 comic books and 30 toys in the bag. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to make the bag lighter, we need to subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight of the bag:  
15 lbs - 60 x 1/4 lb = 15 lbs - 15 lb = 0 lbs  
This means that if Uriah removes all 30 toys, he will have a bag with a total weight of 0 pounds!"
"Response:  We know that for each truck tire he repaired, the mechanic earned $60 and for each car tire he repaired, the mechanic earned $40. So if we want to find out how much more money the mechanic made on Friday compared to Thursday, we need to calculate how much money they made on both days.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, so their total earnings were:

6 x $60 = $360 + 4 x $40 = $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, but no truck tires, so their total earnings were:

12 x $40 = $480

Therefore, the mechanic made $480 on Friday and $520 on Thursday, so the difference is:

$480 - $520 = $40

So the mechanic made an additional $40 on Friday compared to Thursday."
Response:  We know that Patchy has had three times as many kittens as Trixie. So if Trixie has 12 kittens, then Patchy must have 3 x 12 = 36 kittens. In total, the family Doubtfire now has 36 + 12 = 48 kittens.
"Response:  If Jean has 30 paletas and eats 2 of them, then he has 30 - 2 = 28 paletas left. Now, if he wants to fill 2 bags with these remaining paletas, he can do so in two ways:

Option A: Fill both bags with 14 paletas each (28 / 2 = 14).

Option B: Fill one bag with 16 paletas and leave 2 paletas for the second bag (28 / 2 = 16 + 2 = 18).

So, Jean can fill either 2 bags with 14 paletas each or 1 bag with 16 paletas and 1 bag with 18 paletas. The choice is his!"
"Response:  First, we know that Peter has $42 to spend for the week. We also know that he spends $7 on a movie ticket and $7 on popcorn. So if he wants to go to the movies more than once, he needs to have enough money left over after buying his tickets and snacks. 
Let's start by calculating how much money Peter will spend each time he goes to the movies:  
$7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14 per trip
Now let's calculate how many times Peter can go to the movies based on how much money he has available: 
$42 - ($14 x number of trips) = $0
We want this equation to be true, so we can see how many times Peter can go to the movies. Solving for ""number of trips,"" we get: 
Number of trips = $42 / $14 = 3
Peter can go to the movies three times with his $42 allowance."
"Response:  We know that the weight of each box is 15 pounds and there are x boxes in total. So the total weight of all the boxes would be:  

x \* 15 =? 

We also know that the maximum weight that the wooden bridge can support is 5000 pounds (5 tons). Therefore, we need to find out how many boxes we can load onto the truck without exceeding this limit:  

5000 - 3755 =? 

Solving for x, we get:  

x = 249  

So you can load up to 249 boxes onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the wooden bridge."
"Response:  We know that the original price of the groceries was $40.00 and there was a shipping fee of $3.00. So we can start with this equation:

$40.00 + $3.00 = Total Cost

Now, we know that there was also a service charge of 25% of the total cost. To find out what the service charge is, we can multiply the total cost by 25%.

Total Cost x 25% = Service Charge

So, let's substitute the values we have into these equations:

$40.00 + $3.00 = Total Cost
$40.00 x 25% = Service Charge

Solving for the service charge, we get:

Service Charge = $40.00 x 25%
= $10.00

Now we add the service charge to the total cost:

Total Cost + Service Charge = Final Price

Substituting the values, we get:

$40.00 + $10.00 = Final Price

Final Price = $50.00

Finally, Stephen added a tip of $4.00, so the final price he paid is:

Final Price + Tip = Final Price + $4.00

Final Price + $4.00 = $50.00 + $4.00

Final Price + $4.00 = $54.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's grocery purchase after all the fees and taxes were applied was $54.00."
"Response:  We know that each racimo has 20 frutas and there are 6 racimos in total, so we can calculate how many fruits there are in total as follows:

6 racimos x 20 frutas/racimo = 120 frutas

Additionally, we know that there are 67 frutas scattered throughout the bush, so we need to add this number to our previous calculation:

120 + 67 = 187

Therefore, there are 187 frambuesas in total."
"Response:  We have 25 naranjas in total and we know that 1 is not good, so we subtract 1 from our total number of naranjas. Now we have 24 naranjas left.  
We also know that 20% of them are not ripe yet, which means we need to subtract 20/100 x 24 = 4.8 (rounded down to 4) more naranjas from our total. So now we have 24 - 4 = 20 naranjas left.  
Two of the remaining naranjas are sour, so we subtract 2 more from our total. Therefore, there are 20 - 2 = 18 naranjas in good condition."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much did Janet pay for the materials and then add the cost of making it into a brooch.  
Material Cost = $500   
Joyero Fee = $800    
Total Cost = Material Cost + Joyero Fee  
Total Cost = $500 + $800  
Total Cost = $1300  
Insurance Premium (10%) = Total Cost x 10%  
Insurance Premium = $1300 x 10%  
Insurance Premium = $130  
Final Payment = Total Cost + Insurance Premium  
Final Payment = $1300 + $130  
Final Payment = $1430"
"Response:  We know that Si Marcy has worked for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000. From age 20, he is entitled to 5% of the value of his pension each year. So if he retires after 30 years, what will be his annual pension?

First, let's calculate how much of the pension Marcy has earned so far:

1. Calculate the number of years Marcy has worked (30 years).
2. Multiply the number of years by the percentage of the pension he earns each year (5%). This gives us the amount of the pension he has earned so far:

$50,000 x 5% = $25,000

So Marcy has earned $25,000 in pension benefits over the past 30 years. Now we need to find out how much his annual pension will be if he retires after 30 years. To do this, we subtract the amount he has already earned from the total pension benefit he would receive if he had worked for 40 years:

$50,000 - $25,000 = $25,000

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension if he retires after 30 years will be $25,000."
"Response:  We know that Aleena paid for the first half of the year and then paid less in the second half because it was 10% less. So let's start with what she paid for the first six months. 

First Half Year Payment = Total Amount / 2 
= $140 / 2 
= $70 

Now we know that she paid $70 for the first half of the year. For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the original amount. 

Second Half Year Payment = Original Amount x (1 - 0.1) 
= $140 x (1 - 0.1) 
= $140 x 0.9 
= $126 

So, in total, Aleena has paid: 
Total Payment = First Half Year Payment + Second Half Year Payment 
= $70 + $126 
= $196 

Therefore, the total amount that Aleena will have paid at the end of the year is $196."
"Response:  We know that Sophia has already traveled 100 miles since she last filled up her tank and it took 4 gallons of gasoline to fill the tank again. So we can calculate how much gasoline was left in the tank before she started driving:  

12 gal - 4 gal = 8 gal (gasoline left in the tank)
Now we know that there are 8 gallons of gasoline left in the tank. To find out how many more miles Sophia can drive, we need to divide the number of gallons of gasoline left by the car's fuel efficiency per mile:  

8 gal / 25 mpg = 320 mi (more miles driven)
Therefore, Sophia can drive an additional 320 miles with one tank of gasoline."
"Response:  We know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time (1 hour) three times a week. To find out how many hours he spends watching TV and reading over four weeks, we can multiply the number of hours per week by 4. So, first let's calculate his weekly activity:

Weekly TV viewing = 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours/week
Weekly reading = 1 hour x 3 days = 3 hours/week

Now, to find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading over four weeks, we can multiply each weekly total by 4:

Total weekly TV viewing = 6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours
Total weekly reading = 3 hours/week x 4 weeks = 12 hours

Therefore, over four weeks, Jim spends 24 hours watching TV and 12 hours reading."
"Response:  We know that each school has sent two teams (female and male) with five players in each team, so we can start by counting how many people have been sent overall.

1. Female teams: 4 schools x 2 teams per school x 5 players per team = 80 female players.
2. Male teams: 4 schools x 2 teams per school x 5 players per team = 80 male players.
3. Entire number of people sent by all schools = 80 + 80 = 160 people.
Therefore, all four schools together have sent 160 people to participate in the basketball tournament."
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and three times as many emeralds as rubies. So if we let E be the number of emeralds, then there are 3E rubies. In total, there are 175 + 3E gems in the chest. Now we need to find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 less rubies than diamonds, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. Therefore, the number of gems in the chest is 175 + 3E = 140 + 3E.
"Response:  If there are 60 girls and each class has 5 students for every teacher, then we can calculate how many classes they will have with this information. 
Let X be the number of teachers needed to teach all the children in school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, if there are x teachers, there will be 2x teachers needed to teach only the boys. So, in total, there would be 3x teachers needed.  
Now, let's use the fact that there are 60 girls and each class has 5 students. We know that 60 / 5 = 12 classes of girls. And since there are twice as many boys as girls, there will be 2 times 12 = 24 classes of boys. In total, there would be 12 + 24 = 36 classes. 
So, we need 3x teachers to teach these 36 classes. Therefore, the answer is 3x = 36. Simplifying, we get x = 12. 
Therefore, there are 12 teachers at the Dr. Wertz School."
"Response:  We know that Bailey has $100 at the end of 8 weeks and receives $5 per week. So we can calculate how much he received in total during those 8 weeks:  
Total amount received = Number of weeks x Weekly income  
= 8 weeks x $5/week  
= $40  
Now we need to find out how much money Bailey had initially if he ended up with $100 after receiving $40 over 8 weeks. To do this, we subtract the amount he received from his ending balance:  
Initial amount = Ending balance - Amount received  
= $100 - $40  
= $60  
Therefore, Bailey began with $60."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and Judy teaches 5 classes per day, so she teaches 5 x 7 = 35 classes per week. And we also know that she teaches 8 classes on Saturdays, so she teaches 8 + 35 = 43 classes per week. Now, if each class has 15 students and she charges $15 per student, then her total earnings for one week would be:  
43 classes x $15/class = $645 per week."
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second one has twice as many (i.e., 2 x 20 = 40), then to prepare both plates, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions in total.
"Response:  We know that Tommy sells brownies for $3 each and tartas de queso for $4 each. So if he sells x brownies and y portions of tarta de queso, we can calculate how much money he will make as follows:  
For the brownies: 
x \* 3 = 3x 
For the tartas de queso: 
y \* 4 = 4y 
Now we are given that Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 portions of tarta de queso. So we can substitute these values into our equations to find out how much money he makes in total:  
3x + 4y =? 
First, let's solve for x:  
3x = 3(43) = 129 
x = 129/3 = 43 
Next, let's solve for y:  
4y = 4(23) = 92 
y = 92/4 = 23 
Now we have found both x and y, so we can add up the amounts of money Tommy makes from each item to get the total amount of money he recaudes:  
Total = 3x + 4y = 3(43) + 4(23) = 129 + 92 = 221 dollars. 
Therefore, Tommy recaudes $221."
"Response:  We know that Sheila bought five cell phones at $150 each for a total of $750. Since she is paying in three monthly installments, we can calculate how much she will pay each month as follows:  
Month 1:  
$750 / 3 = $250 per month (principal amount) + ($250 x 2%) = $250 + $5 = $255 per month  
Month 2:  
$255 x 2% = $5.10 interest only  
Total due for Month 2 = $255 + $5.10 = $260.10  
Month 3:  
$260.10 x 2% = $5.20 interest only  
Total due for Month 3 = $260.10 + $5.20 = $265.20  
Therefore, Sheila will pay $255 per month for the first two months and $265.20 per month for the third month."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Artie will get from each type of flower. Since he has nothing in change and wants to round prices to the nearest dollar, we can use whole dollars for our calculations.  
For caléndulas, $2.74 rounded to the nearest dollar is $3 per maceta. For petunias, $1.87 rounded to the nearest dollar is $2 per maceta. And for begonias, $2.12 rounded to the nearest dollar is also $3 per maceta.  
Now let's calculate how much money Artie will get from each type of flower:  
Caléndulas: 12 x $3 = $36  
Petunias: 9 x $2 = $18  
Begonias: 17 x $3 = $51  
Adding all these amounts gives us a total of:  
$36 + $18 + $51 = $105  
So Artie will obtain $105 if he sells 12 macetas of caléndulas, 9 macetas of petunias, and 17 macetas of begonias."
"Response:  We know that each floor has half the area of the floor below it, so if we start with the top floor and work our way down, we can find out how much area each floor has.
The top floor has an area of 16 square feet, since we are given this information directly. The next floor down has half the area of the top floor, which is 8 square feet (since 16 / 2 = 8). The third floor down has half the area of the previous floor, which is 4 square feet (since 8 / 2 = 4), and the bottom floor has half the area of the previous floor, which is 2 square feet (since 4 / 2 = 2).
So, the average area of one floor in the castle is:
(16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet per floor."
"Response:  We know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy with 1 taza of food for dogs every day during the first 180 days (6 months). That means she will need 180 tazas of food in total for those 6 months. After that, she has to feed her puppy with 2 tazas of food every day for the rest of its life. So we can calculate how many tazas she will use each year as follows:  
Year 1 (first 6 months): 180 tazas  
Year 2 and beyond: 2 x 365 = 730 tazas per year  
Therefore, Cecilia will use a total of:  
180 + 730 = 910 tazas  
of dog food throughout the first year. To find out how many bags of food she will need, let's divide the total number of tazas by the number of tazas in one bag:  
910 tazas / 110 tazas/bag = 8.27 bags  
So Cecilia will need approximately 8-9 bags of dog food during the first year."
"Response:  We know that Sarah washes four times as much clothes as David, so if she washes x pounds of clothes, David washes 4x pounds of clothes. 
We also know that Raymond washes half of what Sarah does, so he washes (1/2)x pounds of clothes.  
Now we can set up an equation based on this information:
(1/2)x + 4x = 400
Solving for x gives us:
(1/2)x + 4x = 400
2x + 4x = 800
6x = 800
x = 133
So, Sarah washes 400 pounds of clothes and David washes 4 x 400 = 1600 pounds of clothes. 
Raymond washes half of what Sarah does, which is 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of clothes."
"Response:  If he buys 3 flowers per stem and pays $2.50 for each stem, then he will pay:  
3 x $2.50 = $7.50 for 3 stems or $2.50 per stem. 
If he buys 2 flowers per stem and pays $1 for each stem, then he will pay:  
2 x $1 = $2 for 2 stems or $1 per stem. 
Since he wants to buy 18 flowers, if he buys them in bunches of 3, he will need:  
18 / 3 = 6 bunches (since 3 x 6 = 18) and will pay:  
6 x $2.50 = $15 for 6 bunches or $2.50 per bunch. 
On the other hand, if he buys them in bunches of 2, he will need:  
18 / 2 = 9 bunches (since 2 x 9 = 18) and will pay:  
9 x $1 = $9 for 9 bunches or $1 per bunch. 
Therefore, since $9 is less than $15, he saves money by buying the flowers in bunches of 2 instead of bunches of 3. So, his best option is to buy 18 flowers in bunches of 2, which costs him $9."
Response:  First, we know that John pays $100 for the service. If he is a new customer, then he gets a 30% discount. To find out how much he actually pays with the discount, we can multiply $100 by (1 - 0.30), which equals $70. So, John pays $70 for the service.
"Response:  We know that each girl received 1/6 of the total amount of water, which is 24 liters. So, if we divide 24 by 6, we get:

24 / 6 = 4

Each girl received 4 liters of water. Now, we know that a boy received 6 liters of water. To find out how much water was left over, we can subtract the amount of water the girls received from the total amount of water:

24 - (4 x 2) = 24 - 8 = 16

There were 16 liters of water left over."
Response:  First, we know that Charlie had 10 pegatinas to start with. Then she bought 21 more in the store, so now she has 10 + 21 = 31 pegatinas. Next, she was given 23 more as a gift for her birthday, so now she has 31 + 23 = 54 pegatinas total. Finally, she gave 9 of them to her sister, leaving her with 54 - 9 = 45 pegatinas left. So Charlie has 45 pegatinas left after giving some away and using some to decorate a card.
"Response:  We know that Alex weighs 4 times as much as Grace, so if Grace weighs x pounds, then Alex weighs 4x pounds. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times the weight of Grace, we can set up an equation:  

Alex weighs = 4x - 2 

Now we need to find out what Grace weighs first. From the problem statement, Grace weighs 125 pounds. So we can substitute this value into our equation for Alex's weight:  

4x - 2 = 125 

Solve for x (Grace's weight) and you will get:  

4x = 127 

x = 31.75 

So Grace weighs approximately 31.75 pounds. Now we can calculate Alex's weight using the equation we set up earlier:  

Alex weighs = 4x - 2 

Substituting x = 31.75, we get:  

Alex weighs = 4(31.75) - 2 

= 126.875 - 2 

= 124.875 pounds 

Therefore, Grace weighs approximately 31.75 pounds and Alex weighs approximately 124.875 pounds. Their combined weight is:  

Grace + Alex = 31.75 + 124.875 

= 156.625 pounds"
Response:  We know that each rose has 8 spines, so if there are 25 roses in each of the three rose bushes, then there will be 25 x 8 = 200 spines in total.
"Response:  We know that the team won 8 more games than they lost. So if we let W be the number of wins and L be the number of losses, then we can write an equation based on this information:
W + L = 22 (since there are 22 matches in total)
We also know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write another equation:
W - L = 8
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (W and L). Can you use these equations to find out how many games the team won?"
Response:  We know that Gene has been taking four vacations per year since she was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. That means she has taken a total of 34 x 4 = 136 vacations. Each vacation is represented by a different t-shirt, so there are 136 t-shirts in total. Since each t-shirt is a block of the quilt, there are also 136 blocks in the quilt.
"Response:  We know that the first time the alarm sounded for four times more than usual. The second time it sounded three times more than usual. And the third time it sounded half as long as the second time. So we can start with the fact that the normal duration of the alarm is x minutes. 

1st time: 4x = 4(x) = 4x minutes (since it sounded for 4 times more than usual)
2nd time: 3x = 3(x) = 3x minutes (since it sounded for 3 times more than usual)
3rd time: (1/2)x = (1/2)(x) = x/2 minutes (since it sounded for half as long as the previous time)

Now we have three equations and three unknowns (x, x, and x/2). Can you solve this system of linear equations to find out how many times the alarm sounded in total?"
"Response:  If Sylvie has been working for five years at the end of December last year and her annual salary is increased by 10% each year, then her current salary after three more years would be as follows:  
Year 1 (current): $600 x 1.10 = $660 per month ($7920 annually) 
Year 2: $7920 x 1.10 = $8648 per year 
Year 3: $8648 x 1.10 = $9534.80 per year 
Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $9534.80."
"Response:  We know that together they sold 88,000 copies and that Marilyn alone sold 10 times more than Harald. So if we can find out how many copies Marilyn sold, we can subtract that number from 88,000 to find out how many copies Harald sold.
Let's assume that Marilyn sold x copies. Since she sold 10 times more than Harald, he sold 1/10 of what Marilyn sold, or x/10.
We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up an equation based on this information:
x + (x/10) = 88,000
Simplifying the equation:
2x + x/10 = 88,000
3x/10 = 88,000
x = 880,000 / 3
x = 293,333
So Marilyn sold 293,333 copies and Harald sold 293,333 / 10 = 29,333 copies."
"Response:  We know that Christina invited 16 friends and she needs 0,75 bags of gifts per guest since one-fourth of them won't show up. So, we can calculate how many bags she will need in total:  

16 guests x 0,75 bags/guest = 12 bags (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Now, let's calculate how much Christina will spend on gift bags:  

12 bags x $2/bag = $24

Therefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags for her birthday party."
"Response:  We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of coleslaw and a child will eat half as much. So if there are 20 adults and 5 children, how many pounds of coleslaw should Ted bring to the picnic?  
First, let's calculate how much each child will eat: 
5 x (1/2) = 2.5 pounds per child 
Now, add up all the food needed for both adults and children: 
20 x 10 = 200 pounds (for adults) + 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 pounds (for children) = 212.5 pounds 
So, Ted needs to bring approximately 213 pounds of coleslaw to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat!"
"Response:  We know that Jan has three times more pets than Marcia, so if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets. Also, we know that Marcia has two pets more than Cindy, so Cindy has x - 2 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets for all three is:

Jan (3x) + Marcia (x) + Cindy (x - 2) = 3x + x + (x - 2) = 4x - 2

So, the total number of pets for all three is 4x - 2."
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So we can start with these two equations:
Amy - Jackson = 5... (1)
Corey - Amy = 2... (2)
Now we are given that James has 10 years and is one year younger than Corey. This gives us another equation:
James - Corey = 1... (3)
We also know that all four children have different ages. Therefore, we can set up an equation for each child:
Jackson + Amy + Corey + James = 4... (4)
Now we have five equations and four variables. Can you solve them to find out how old Jackson is?"
"Response:  We know that Lee can run the race in 38 seconds, so we can start there as our baseline time. If Gerald improved his speed by 10%, then he must have reduced his time by 10% of 38 seconds, which is:

10% x 38 sec = 3.8 sec (since 10% of 38 is 3.8)

So, Gerald's new time would be:

38 sec - 3.8 sec = 34.2 sec

Therefore, Gerald can now run the race in 34.2 seconds, which is 3.8 seconds faster than Lee's original time."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer rabbits than the combined number of dogs and cats. So if we let D be the number of dogs and C be the number of cats, then the number of rabbits is 12 less than DC. 
We also know that there are two cats for every dog, so C = 2D. 
Now we can substitute these expressions into our first equation to get:  
DC - 12 = 60... (1)
Simplifying this equation, we have:  
2D - 12 = 60... (2)
Solving for D, we find that:  
D = 30... (3)
Substituting this value back into equation (2), we see that:  
2(30) - 12 = 60... (4)
Expanding and simplifying, we get:   
60 = 60... (5)
This last equation is true by definition, since 60 is indeed equal to 60. 
So we have shown that there are 30 dogs in the neighborhood. Since each dog has two cats, there are 30 x 2 = 60 cats as well. In addition, there are 12 fewer rabbits than the combined number of dogs and cats, so there are 30 + 60 - 12 = 98 rabbits in all. 
Therefore, the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is 30 dogs, 60 cats, and 98 rabbits."
"Response:  We know that 2/5 of the students are boys and 2/3 of the girls belong to the group of explorers. So we can start by finding out how many girls there are in total.

We know that 2/5 of the students are boys, so if there are x boys, then there will be 2x/5 girls (since 2/5 of the students are boys).

Now, we also know that 2/3 of the girls belong to the group of explorers, so if there are y girls in total, then there will be 2y/3 girls in the group of explorers.

Can you use these two equations to find out how many girls there are in total, and then how many girls are not in the group of explorers?"
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept. So we can start by finding out how many hours James slept.  

To find out how many hours James slept, we need to divide Harry's sleep time by 3. This gives us:

9 hours / 3 = 3 hours

So James slept for 3 hours. Now we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James did. To do this, we subtract the amount of time James slept from the total amount of time Harry slept:

9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 6 hours more than James did."
Response:  We know that each can of tomatoes has three tomatoes and each tomato loses half its volume when it is used to make salsa. So if Freda made 32 ounces of salsa, she must have used 32 / 2 = 16 cans of tomatoes. Since each can contains three tomatoes, Freda used 16 x 3 = 48 tomatoes in total.
"Response:  We know that there were originally 30 cars in the highway and 5 of them took an exit to avoid the traffic jam. So, we have to find out how many cars passed through the traffic jam within the first 15 minutes.  
Let X be the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam within the first 15 minutes. Since some cars passed during this time period, we can write the equation:  
X + 20 = 30 (where 20 is the number of cars that passed in the remaining 15 minutes)  
Solving for X, we get:  
X = 10  
So, 10 cars passed through the traffic jam within the first 15 minutes."
"Response: 
Mary has 40 windows with 2 plants of macetas each = 40 x 2 = 80 plants in total.
She received 18 new plants from her favorite nursery.
So, she will have 80 + 18 = 98 plants in total after giving away one plant per repisa to friends and family.
Therefore, Mary will have 98 - 40 (the number of repisas) = 58 plants left after distributing the plants among her friends and family."
Response:  We know that the first friend tock the doorbell 20 times before Jerome answered. The second friend tock the doorbell 1/4 more than the first one, so he tock the doorbell 5 times (20 x 1/4 = 5). The third friend tock the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth, so he tock the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times. Finally, the fourth friend tock the doorbell 60 times. Therefore, in total, the doorbell sounded 20 + 5 + 70 + 60 = 155 times.
"Response:  We know that Solo has to read in total:

* 4 pages of science (x) +
* 20 pages of social sciences (y) +
* 7 pages of history (z) +
* 8 pages of geography (w) = 43 pages.

We also know that Solo only read 15 pages on Monday, so we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + y + z + w = 15

Now, we want to find out how many pages Solo needs to read each day, on average, to finish all the books within 4 days. To do this, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days left:

43 pages / 4 days =? pages per day

Can you solve for x and find out how many pages Solo needs to read each day, on average?"
Response:  We know that John drinks water with breakfast, lunch and dinner every day of the week (3 times/day x 7 days = 21 glasses). However, on weekends he prefers to relax and have a soft drink with dinner instead of water (so no additional water intake on weekends). Therefore, in one week, John drinks 21 glasses of water during the weekdays only.
"Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes for the fog bank to cover 3 miles of the city. So if we want to find out how long it will take to cover the entire city (which is 42 miles), we can start by dividing the distance of the city into smaller parts.
Let's divide the distance of the city into 3-mile sections. This means there will be 42/3 = 14 sections of the city.
Now, let's calculate how many minutes it would take to cover each section:
For each section, it will take 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. Therefore, it will take 10 x 14 = 140 minutes to cover all 14 sections of the city.
So, in total, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
Therefore, our final answer is 140 minutes."
"Response:  We know that Poppy has placed one-fourth of the pieces (250) and her mother has placed one-third of the remaining pieces (333). So we can calculate how many pieces are left to be placed as follows:

250 + 333 = 583

Therefore, there are 583 - 250 = 333 pieces left to be placed in the puzzle."
Response:  We know that Cody comes three times more cookies than Amir. So if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody will eat 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. In total, they both eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.
"Response:  We know that each box has dimensions of 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches, and we also know that the walls are 1 inch thick. So to find the volume of each box, we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height, or V = lwh. In this case, the length, width, and height are all given as 5, 6, and 4 inches, respectively. To calculate the volume of one box, we can plug these values into the formula like this:
V = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches
Since there are three boxes, we can multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total volume of all three boxes:
Total Volume = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches
Now, let's consider the walls. Each wall has an area of 5 x 6 = 30 square inches, and since there are four walls, the total area of the walls is:
Total Wall Area = 4 x 30 = 120 square inches
The volume of the walls is equal to the area of the walls times the thickness of the walls, which is 1 inch. Therefore, the volume of the walls is:
Volume of Walls = 120 sq in x 1 in = 120 cubic inches
So, the total volume of the three boxes plus the volume of the walls is:
Total Volume + Volume of Walls = 360 + 120 = 480 cubic inches
Therefore, the total volume of the three boxes is 480 cubic inches."
"Response:  We know that Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Wednesday, she watched some episodes of a 30-minute program. Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we can calculate how many episodes she watched based on the total number of hours she spent watching TV.

Let x be the number of episodes of the 30-minute program that Frankie watched on Wednesday.

We know that the sum of all the times she spent watching TV is equal to 7 hours:

x + (1 hour) + (1 hour) + (30 minutes) + (30 minutes) = 7 hours

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 2 hours + 30 minutes = 7 hours

Solving for x:

2x = 5 hours

x = 2.5 hours

Therefore, Frankie watched 2.5 hours of the 30-minute program on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Henry made 15 more galletas than he did last year and he discarded 5 of them. So, if we subtract 5 from 15, we get 10. This means that Henry made 10 more galletas than he did last year. If he made x galletas last year, then this year he made x + 10. The problem states that when he put the galletas to cool down, he had a total of 110. So, let's set up an equation:
x + (x + 10) = 110
2x + 10 = 110
2x = 100
x = 50
So, Henry made 50 galletas last year."
"Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline at $3 per gallon, they will pay $3 x 10 = $30 for the gasoline. However, if they use the application company's rebate offer and load it at the local gas station, they can get a rebate of $0.20 per gallon. So, after applying the rebate, the total amount paid for the gasoline would be:

$30 - ($0.20 x 10) = $30 - $2 = $28

Therefore, the person would pay $28 for 10 gallons of gasoline after using the rebate offer from the application company."
"Response:  We know that Beatrice had 24 rollitos of length and Marcel had 14 rollitos of length. To find out how many they ate in total, we need to multiply the number of rollitos each one had by their width (in this case, 2 or 3). So Beatrice ate:

2 x 24 = 48 rollitos

And Marcel ate:

3 x 14 = 42 rollitos

Now, let's add up both amounts to get the total amount eaten:

48 + 42 = 90

So, in total, they ate 90 rollitos. Finally, to find out how much each one ate on average, we divide the total amount by the number of people:

90 / 2 = 45

Therefore, Beatrice and Marcel ate an average of 45 rollitos each."
"Response:  We know that the boat began to take in water at a rate of two liters per ten feet traveled towards the shore. So if Julia rowed for twenty feet (20), then she would have taken in:  

2 L/10 ft x 20 ft = 40 L 

We also know that it took her sixteen seconds (16) to travel those twenty feet. Therefore, we can calculate how much time it would take her to cover the remaining distance to the shore:  

Distance to shore = Total distance - Distance traveled = 64 sec - 16 sec = 48 sec 

So Julia has left 48 seconds to reach the shore. Now let's add up all the time she spent rowing and waiting for the water to fill the boat:  

Time spent rowing + Time waiting = 16 sec + 48 sec = 64 sec 

Therefore, when Julia reached the shore, the boat had filled with:  

Water volume = Time spent rowing x Rate of filling = 16 sec x 2 L/10 ft = 32 L 

So when Julia arrived at the shore, the boat contained thirty-two liters of water."
"Response:  We know that there are four teachers who share one chalkboard and each teacher has two classes per day. In each class, they use the chalkboard three times. So, in total, how many times will the chalkboard be used in a day? 
To find out, we need to multiply the number of teachers by the number of classes they teach per day. Since each teacher teaches two classes, we can calculate as follows:  
4 (teachers) x 2 (classes/day) = 8 classes/day
Now, let's consider how many times the chalkboard will be used within these eight classes. As mentioned earlier, each class uses the chalkboard three times. Therefore, we can calculate as follows:   
8 (classes/day) x 3 (times/class) = 24 times/day
So, the chalkboard is used 24 times per day!"
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers per day and there are 15 days, then he will have planted a total of 2 x 15 = 30 flowers. Now, if 5 of them did not grow, we can subtract 5 from 30 to get our final answer: 30 - 5 = 25 flowers. Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden.
"Response:  We know that the phone of Jamal can store 1800 photographs and the phone of Brittany can store 50 times more than the number of birds in the photo taken by Jamal at the zoo. So we need to find out how many birds are there in the picture taken by Jamal at the zoo.
Let X be the number of birds in the photo taken by Jamal at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can store 50 times more photos than the number of birds in the photo, the number of photos that Brittany's phone can store is 50X.
We also know that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photographs, so the total number of photographs that both phones can store together is 1800 + 50X.
Now we have two equations:
Equation 1: 1800 + 50X = 6(1800) (since Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone)
Equation 2: X =? (the unknown number of birds in the photo taken by Jamal at the zoo)
Solving Equation 1 for X, we get:
X = 3600 / 50
X = 72
Therefore, there are 72 birds in the photo taken by Jamal at the zoo."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha spent in total for all of her lumber. Then, we can subtract that amount from what she could sell it for now to find out how much profit she would make if she sold everything.  
Total cost = (10 x $10) + (5 x $16) = $100 + $80 = $180  
Now let's look at the current prices. If she sells each 2x4x10 board for $15, she will make:  
Profit per board = $15 - $10 = $5 per board  
Since she has ten boards, her total profit from those is:  
Ten boards x $5 profit per board = $50  
For the five 4x4x10 boards, the profit per board is:  
Profit per board = $16 - $10 = $6 per board  
Five boards x $6 profit per board = $30  
Adding both amounts together gives us the total profit:  
$50 + $30 = $80  
So, if Sasha sells all of her lumber, she will gain $80."
"Response:  We know that Katy used 7 parts of sugar and 13 parts of water. So we can start by writing down these numbers as fractions:

7/13 = x/y (where x is the number of cups of sugar and y is the number of cups of water)

We also know that there are 8 tablespoons in 1 cup, so we can convert the fractions to decimals:

7/13 = 8/x (since there are 8 tablespoons in 1 cup)

Now we have the equation:

8/x = 120/y (since there are 120 tablespoons in 120 cups)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

8x = 120y

Now divide both sides by 8:

x = 15

So Katy used 15 cups of sugar."
"Response:  If John has three children and buys two pairs of shoes for each child, then he will buy a total of 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, then John will pay: 
6 pairs x $60 per pair = $60 x 6 = $360."
"Response:  We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each imported on the first day, so the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:

2 x 5 = 10

On the second day, we are told that the total number of vehicles in the port increased to 30. So, if we subtract the number of vehicles imported on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day, we can find out how many more vehicles were imported on the second day:

30 - 10 = 20

Since all the containers had 5 vehicles each, we can divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by the number of vehicles per container to find out how many containers were imported:

20 / 5 = 4

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
Response:  We know that four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000 and Lylah earned $40,000 x 0.7 = $28,000. So their combined income was $68,000. Now we are told that Adrien's current salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago, so Adrien's current salary is $40,000 + (40% of $40,000) = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000. Similarly, Lylah's current salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago, so Lylah's current salary is $28,000 + (40% of $28,000) = $28,000 + $11,200 = $39,200. Therefore, their combined income today is $56,000 + $39,200 = $95,200.
"Response:  If Miguel uses two notebooks per week and each notebook has 30 sheets, then in one month (which is approximately 4 weeks), he will use:  

2 notebooks x 4 weeks = 8 notebooks  
8 notebooks x 30 sheets/notebook = 240 sheets  
Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets per month."
Response:  We know that Morisette brought 5 manzanas and 8 naranjas, so she brought a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael brought double the number of manzanas that Morisette brought, which is 2 x 5 = 10 manzanas. And Kael brought half the number of naranjas that Morisette brought, which is ½ x 8 = 4 naranjas. So in total, Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. Therefore, the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael together is 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.
"Response:  We know that Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday and then 2 hours less each day after that (Tuesday and Wednesday). So, she slept for:

Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
Wednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours

Now, we need to find out how many hours Sadie slept in total for the rest of the week. The problem states that she slept ""1 hour more than those two days."" This means she slept for 1 hour more than 6 + 6 = 12 hours. Therefore, Sadie slept for:

Total hours: 12 + 1 = 13 hours

So, Sadie slept for 13 hours in total throughout the entire week."
"Response:  We know that Rosie can run at two different speeds: 

* 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (3 x 10 = 30 miles)
* 5 miles per hour for 4 hours (4 x 5 = 20 miles)

Total distance traveled in 7 hours is: 30 + 20 = 50 miles."
Response:  We know that Jennie placed stamps on a third of the cards that needed them. So if there are now 30 cards with stamps in the pile, and Jennie started with 60 cards that needed stamps, then she must have had 20 cards without stamps at first (60 - 30 = 20).
"Response:  We know that Julia used three of the new cucharas to taste the estofado while she was cooking it. So if we subtract 3 from the total number of cucharas that were in the package, we can find out how many cucharas were left in the package after Julia used them. 
Let X be the number of cucharas in the package that Julia bought. Since her husband also gave her 5 new cucharas, we know that Julia had a total of X + 5 cucharas. 
We are told that when Julia went to set the table, there were 12 cucharas in total. This means that the sum of all the cucharas Julia had (X + 5) plus the number of cucharas she used (3) must equal 12. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 
X + 5 + 3 = 12 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
X + 8 = 12 
Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us: 
X = 4 
So there were 4 cucharas in the package that Julia bought."
Response:  We know that Dylan bought 38 salchichas de pollo and 6 salchichas de pescado. To find out how many salchichas she bought in total, we need to add these two numbers together. So, if we add 38 + 6 = 44, then Dylan bought 44 salchichas in total.
Response:  If Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, that means Amy has 20 + 50 = 70 friends in total. So together, Lily and Amy have 50 + 70 = 120 friends.
"Response:  We know that one sandía costs three times as much as one pimiento, so if we want to find out how much one sandía costs, we can divide the cost of one pimiento by three. This gives us:

$15 / 3 = $5 per sandía

Now we know that one sandía costs $5. Since Dillon wants to buy four sandías, he will pay:

4 x $5 = $20 for the sandías

Next, we need to find out how much the pimientos cost. We know that each pimiento costs $15, and Dillon is buying 20 of them, so:

20 x $15 = $300 for the pimientos

Finally, we need to add up the cost of all the items Dillon is buying:

$20 + $300 = $320

So the total amount of money that Dillon will spend is $320."
"Response:  We know that there are 500 patients per day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. So, in one day, the total time spent with all patients would be:  

500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

Now we need to calculate how much money the hospital earns from these visits. The doctors charge $150 per hour, so if they see each patient for 24 minutes (which is equivalent to 0.4 hours), then the revenue generated by each patient is:  

$150/hour x 0.4 hours/patient = $60/patient

Since there are 500 patients per day, the total daily revenue earned by the hospital is:  

$60/patient x 500 patients/day = $30,000/day

However, the hospital also charges the patients $200 per hour. Since each patient spends 24 minutes (or 0.4 hours) in the hospital, the amount charged to each patient is:  

$200/hour x 0.4 hours/patient = $80/patient

So, the total amount collected from patients is:  

$80/patient x 500 patients/day = $40,000/day

The difference between what the hospital collects from patients ($40,000) and its expenses ($30,000) is the profit or gain of the hospital:  

Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000/day

Therefore, the hospital obtains a daily gain of $10,000 from these visits."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 60 elves and then:

* A third of them (20) resigned after being vomited upon.
* Then, 10 more resigned after their spikey shoes were kicked.

So, we need to subtract these numbers from the initial number of elves:

60 - 20 = 40 (after the first group resigned)
40 - 10 = 30 (after the second group resigned)

Therefore, there are 30 elves left."
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. That means he spent $500 + $60 = $560 in June. So his total spending for both months is $560.
"Response:  First, we know that Pam rode the roller coaster twice, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets. 
Fred rode it four times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets. 
Now, they both rode the sled 2 times each, so together they used 2 x 2 = 4 more tickets. 
In total, they used 12 + 24 + 4 = 40 tickets."
"Response:  We know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and then he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, if we let x be the number of miles Walt walked on Monday, then he walked 6x miles on Tuesday. 
We also know that the total number of miles Walt walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
4 + 6x = 41 
Now solve for x. To do so, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:  
6x = 37 
Divide both sides by 6 to find out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday:  
x = 6 
So, Walt walked 6 miles on Tuesday."
"Response:  If Tom washes his car four times a month and each wash costs $15, then he spends $60 per month on car washing ($15 x 4). To find out how much he spends in a year, we need to multiply $60 by 12 months:  
$60 x 12 = $720  
So, Tom spends $720 per year on car washing."
"Response:  If Brian has 20 video games and loses 5, he will have 15 left (20 - 5 = 15). Now, if Bobby has 5 fewer video games than three times the number of video games that Brian has, we can set up an equation based on this information.

Let B be the number of video games Bobby has. Since Bobby has 5 fewer video games than three times the number of video games Brian has, we can write:

B = 3(15) - 5
= 3 x 15 - 5
= 45 - 5
= 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
Response:  We know that two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are females, so we can start by finding out how many female unicorns there are in Scotland. Two-thirds of 27 is 18 (since 2/3 of 27 is 18). Therefore, there are 18 female unicorns in Scotland.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much each item costs and then add them up. Then we can calculate the total with the delivery fee and finally add the tip. Here is the calculation:

Sandwiches x 2 = $7.50 x 2 = $15.00
French Fries x 2 = $1.50 x 2 = $3.00
Cookies x 2 = $1.00 x 2 = $2.00
Total without delivery = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
Delivery fee (20% of $20) = $4.00
Total with delivery = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
Tip ($5.00)
Final Total = $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00"
"Response:  We know that Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and it took him 8 hours to complete it. So he answered 8 x 5 = 40 questions. The second test had 100 questions, so we can subtract the number of questions he answered during the first test from the total number of questions in the second test to find out how many questions he left incomplete:  
100 - 40 = 60. Therefore, Mark left 60 questions incomplete during the second test."
"Response:  We know that there are four times as many pink balls as blue balls, so if we have x blue balls, we will have 4x pink balls. In total, we have 12 + 4x balls. Since all the balls are candies, we can say that the sum of the number of blue and pink balls is equal to 22. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
12 + 4x = 22
Solving for x, we get: 
4x = 22 - 12
4x = 10
x = 10/4
x = 2
So, there are 2x = 2(2) = 4 pink balls. 
Therefore, there are 12 blue balls and 4 pink balls in the candy machine."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for renting and we have to find out how many of them have semi-automatic transmission. So, first, let's divide the total number of cars into three categories based on their transmissions: automatic, manual, and semi-automatic. 
We know that 12 cars have automatic transmission (12/20 = 0.6), 4 cars have manual transmission (4/20 = 0.2), and the remaining 4 cars have semi-automatic transmission (4/20 = 0.2). Now, we can calculate the percentage of cars with semi-automatic transmission as follows:
Percentage of cars with semi-automatic transmission = (0.2 x 100) / 20 = 10%
Therefore, 10% of the available cars have semi-automatic transmission."
Response:  We know that there are 700 abejas in total and two times more worker bees than baby bees. So, if we divide 700 by 2, we get 350 worker bees. Now, since there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, we can multiply 350 by 2 to get 700 baby bees. Therefore, there are 350 + 700 = 1050 worker bees in total.
"Response:  We know that Jordan spends 2 hours per day playing video games, which is equal to 14 hours per week (2 x 7 = 14). If he worked during those 14 hours, he would earn $10/hour, so his total earnings for the week would be:  

$10/hour x 14 hours = $140 per week. 
Therefore, in one week, Jordan would earn $140 if he used the time he spends playing video games to work instead."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much each item costs without tax and then add all those amounts together. Then we can multiply that total by 1.1 (the tax rate) to find out how much everything will cost with tax.

Here are the calculations for each item:

* Leche: $2 x 1 = $2
* Huevos: $3 x 1 = $3
* Bombillas de luz: $3 x 1 = $3
* Tazas: $3 x 1 = $3
* Trampas para cucarachas: $4 x 1 = $4

Total cost without tax: $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Now let's calculate the total cost with tax:
$15 x 1.1 = $16.50

So the total cost of all items including tax is $16.50."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lucas will make from each of his clients. We know that he needs two bottles of detergent and one package of cleaning cloths for each house. So if he has three clients now, and five potential clients, that means he will use:

For the three current clients:

* 3 x 2 = 6 bottles of detergent
* 3 x 1 = 3 packages of cleaning cloths

Total cost for the three current clients:

* 6 x $2 = $12 (detergent)
* 3 x $5 = $15 (cleaning cloths)

Total cost for all six clients:

* 6 x $2 = $12 (detergent)
* 3 x $5 = $15 (cleaning cloths)

Now let's add up the total income:

Income from three current clients:

* 3 x $92 = $276

Income from five potential clients:

* 5 x $92 = $460

Total weekly income:

* $276 + $460 = $736

So Lucas's weekly income would be $736. Now let's subtract his total costs:

Total costs:

* $12 (detergent)
* $15 (cleaning cloths)

Total costs per week:

* $12 + $15 = $27

Subtracting the total costs from the total income, we get:

Gain per week:

* $736 - $27 = $709

Therefore, Lucas's weekly gain would be $709."
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and each hectare contains 100 piñas. So, in total, he has 10 x 100 = 1000 piñas per hectare. Since he can harvest every 3 months, we need to calculate how many times he can harvest in one year. There are 4 seasons in a year, so he can harvest 4 times in a year (assuming each season is approximately 3 months long). Therefore, John can cosechar 1000 x 4 = 4000 piñas in one year.
"Response:  We know that Johnny has three boxes of Lego blocks:

Box 1: 500 pieces
Box 2: 3 times more than Box 1 = 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces
Box 3: 1/4 of Box 1 = 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces

So, in total, Johnny has:

500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces

Therefore, Johnny collects 2125 Lego blocks."
Response:  We know that in the first six hours, there were 30 bees that left the hive and returned twice as many (i.e., 2 x 30 = 60) to fly away during the next six hours. So, we have 60 bees flying out of the hive for the second time. In total, then, there are 90 bees leaving the hive over the course of 12 hours (30 + 60). Now, if each of these bees returns once, we will see 90 returning bees. However, since two times more bees flew away than initially left, we need to double this number to account for the fact that some bees may return multiple times. Therefore, we can expect to see approximately 180 bees returning to the hive over the last six hours of the day (2 x 90 = 180).
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money that Brittany's mom gave to the cashier is $8. The cost of one adult ticket is $12, so the number of adult tickets is:  

$8 / $12 = 0.67 (rounded to whole numbers) = 1

The cost of one child ticket is $10, so the number of child tickets is:  

$8 - $10 = $8 - $10 = $0 (since there are no child tickets)

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $8."
"Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x friends, then Charlie has 3x friends. 
We also know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x friends, then James has 4x friends. 
Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Let's start with what we know about Charlie: 
Charlie has 3 times as many friends as Dorothy, so: 
3x = 12 (since Charlie has 12 friends) 
Now let's use this to find out how many friends Dorothy has: 
Dorothy has 3 times as many friends as Charlie, so: 
x = 12 / 3 
x = 4 
So Dorothy has 4 friends. Now we can find out how many friends James has: 
James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy, so: 
4x =? 
Substituting x = 4 from before gives us:  
4(4) =? 
16 =? 
Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"Response:  We know that Steve lives 3 miles away from school, so he will take 3 x 5280 / 440 = 190 minutes (or 3 hours and 10 minutes) to arrive home by bike. 
Tim lives 2 miles away from school, so he will take 2 x 5280 / 264 = 75 minutes (or 1 hour and 15 minutes) to arrive home by skateboard.  
Since Steve takes longer than Tim to arrive home, Tim will arrive at his house before Steve does. Therefore, the winner of the race is Tim, who will arrive at his house in 75 minutes."
"Response:  We know that each tire costs $0.25 to inflate and there were five people who brought their bicycles for inflation. So we can calculate how much money Shawnda made as follows:

Total amount earned = Number of customers x Price per customer
= 5 x $0.25
= $1.25

So Shawnda earned $1.25 that day."
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of cookies and each package contains six cookies, then he will buy a total of 10 x 6 = 60 cookies. Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl will pay a total of 60 x $0.10 = $6 for all the cookies. So, if Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will receive $10 - $6 = $4 in change.
Response:  We know that Dave ate 14 potatoes before the seagull stole the bag from him. So he had eaten 14 already. The seagull ate half of what was left in the bag, which is half of 14 or 7. Then three doves came and each ate 3 more potatoes, so they ate 9 more (3 x 3). After that, a weasel took two-thirds of what was left, which is two-thirds of 9 or 6. Finally, ants took one last potato, leaving us with 5. Therefore, there were initially 14 - 14 = 0 potatoes in the bag when Dave bought it.
Response:  We know that there are 3 days in which Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), so he spends 3 x 1 = 3 hours per day on these days. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 x 2 = 4 hours per day on these days. In total, Kimo spends 3 + 4 = 7 hours per week on classes. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 7 x 16 = 112 hours in class for the entire semester.
"Response:  We know that we have three types of products: panecillos, croissants with chocolate, and baguettes. Each type has a different length, so let's calculate each one separately.  
Panecillos: 300 x 4 inches/panecillo = 1200 inches or 10 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot)  
Croissants with chocolate: 120 x 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches or 60 feet  
Baguettes: 60 x 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet  
Now, let's add up all these lengths to find out how long Bill's row of products would be if he placed them end to end:  
10 + 60 + 120 = 190 feet  
So, the total length of Bill's row of products is approximately 190 feet."
"Response:  We know that we need to cover two months of food for all the primates in the zoo. So let's calculate how many bananas each species needs per month and then add them up.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month. Gorillas need 400 bananas per month. Baboons need 100 bananas per month. In total, we need:

200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month

Since we want to cover two months, we multiply the total number of bananas needed by 2:

700 x 2 = 1400 bananas

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas from the local farm every two months to feed all the primates in the zoo."
"Response:  We know that Blake ran back and forth 15 times, so he covered a total distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.
Kelly only ran once from one end zone to the other, which is 100 yards. Then she turned around and ran back, for a total distance of 2 x 100 = 200 yards.
So the total distance traveled by Blake is 1500 yards, while the total distance traveled by Kelly is 200 yards. To find out how much farther Blake went than Kelly, we can subtract their distances:
1500 - 200 = 1300 yards
Therefore, Blake went 1300 yards farther than Kelly."
"Response:  We know that Raphael bought four pens that costed $1.5 each, so he spent in total:

$1.5 x 4 = $6

He also bought two notebooks that costed $4 each, so he spent in total:

$4 x 2 = $8

Finally, he bought a ream of paper that costed $20. So, in total, Raphael spent:

$6 + $8 + $20 = $34"
"Response:  First, we know that there were originally 11 tadpoles in the pond. Then, 6 of them were hiding under a lily pad, so we subtract 6 from 11 to get:

11 - 6 = 5

Now, we know that 2 more tadpoles are hiding under a rock, so we add 2 to our previous result:

5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, Finn can see 7 tadpoles in the pond now."
"Response:  We know that on Tuesday (the second day), there were 7 more feet of water in the tank than on Monday (the first day). So if the tank had 17 feet of water on Monday, it had 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water on Tuesday. 
Now we need to find out how much water is left in the tank on Wednesday (the third day) after two-thirds of the water has been drained. To do this, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:

Let x be the number of feet of water left in the tank on Wednesday.
Since two-thirds of the water was drained, we know that:
x / 3 = 24 / 3
Simplifying, we get:
x = 8
So there are 8 feet of water left in the tank on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 stars of the sea, 6 little horses of the sea and 3 clown fish. If we add up all these numbers, we get:

10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now let's look at what Locsin caught. She caught 5 fewer stars than Anakin, so she caught 5 less than 10, which is:

10 - 5 = 5

She also caught 3 fewer little horses than Anakin, so she caught 3 less than 6, which is:

6 - 3 = 3

And finally, she caught 2 more clown fish than Anakin, so she caught:

3 + 2 = 5

So in total, Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish. Therefore, both Anakin and Locsin together caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish."
"Response:  If the price increases by 20% every two months, then after one month, the price will increase by 20/12 = 1.67%. So, if the initial price is x, then the price after one month will be x + (1.67x) = 1.67x + x = 3.34x.
Now, we know that the price of the bag of canaries will increase by 20% every two months, so after three years (which is equal to 36 months), the price will have increased by 3 x 20% = 60%. Therefore, the final price of the bag of canaries will be:
3.34x x 1.67^3 = 3.34x x 2.59 = 8.73x
So, the final price of the bag of canaries after 36 months will be 8.73 times the initial price."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red cars and each one costs $4, so together they cost:

5 x $4 = $20

We also know that there are 3 collectible dolls and each one costs $5, so together they cost:

3 x $5 = $15

Finally, we have a doll that costs the same as the three collectible dolls, so it costs $15 too. In total, all the toys in the room cost:

$20 + $15 + $15 = $50"
Response:  If she does it herself, she will save $35 per hour and work for 3 hours less (3 hours x $35 = $105). If she hires an accountant, she will pay $90. So, if she does it herself, she will have $105 - $105 = $0. If she hires an accountant, she will have to pay $90, so her total cost would be $90. Therefore, there is no difference in terms of money whether she does it herself or hires an accountant.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Elvira spent in total for all her computer accessories:

€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD player) + €102 (printer) = €1323

Now, let's subtract the amount she spent from her budget of €1500:

€1500 - €1323 = €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left over for buying clothes and other items."
Response:  We know that each flan requires 3 eggs and Sandra needs to make 15 flans. So she will need 45 eggs in total (15 x 3). Since her neighbor gives her a basket with 9 eggs every time she babysits his daughter, she will have to babysit 5 times (45 / 9 = 5) to collect all the eggs needed for making the flans.
"Response:  We know that in two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can set up an equation based on this information. 
Let S represent Seth's age and B represent Brooke's age. In two years, their combined age will be: 
S + B = 2(S + B) 
We are also given that Brooke is half of Seth's age, so we can write: 
B = (1/2)S 
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use these equations to find out how old Seth is?"
Response:  If Ethel has $8, then she has double that amount, which is $16. So, Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel, which means he has $16 + 2 = $18. Therefore, Jimmy has $18.
Response:  We know that Pancho walks 20 miles per day from Monday to Friday (5 days). So in total he walks for 5 x 20 = 100 miles during the weekdays. On Saturdays and Sundays (weekend days), he only walks 10 miles each day, so in total he walks for 2 x 10 = 20 miles during the weekends. Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 100 + 20 = 120 miles in one week.
"Response:  We know that each uniform includes a hat ($25), a jacket (3 times more than the hat = $75), and pants whose price is the average of the hat and jacket prices. So we can calculate the price of the pants as follows:

Pants price = (hat price + jacket price) / 2
= ($25 + $75) / 2
= $100 / 2
= $50

Now we have all three components of the uniform: hat ($25), jacket ($75), and pants ($50). To find the total cost of each uniform, we simply add up these amounts:

Total cost per uniform = hat price + jacket price + pants price
= $25 + $75 + $50
= $150

So the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"Response:  We know that Jake sees:

* 80 spiders with 8 legs each = 80 x 8 = 640 legs
* 90 insects with 6 legs each = 90 x 6 = 540 legs
* 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each = 3 x 10 = 30 legs

Adding all these numbers together gives us a total of:

640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

So Jake sees a total of 1210 legs in the museum of entomology."
Response:  We know that Sally Four is three years older than Sally Two, so Sally Four must be 3 + 2 = 5 years old. Since Sally Thirty-two has eight years and Sally Four is five years old, we can conclude that Sally Thirty-two is eight plus five equals thirteen years old. Now let's look at the other two birds. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Two, which means she is two times three equals six years older than Sally Two. So if Sally Two is five years old, then Granny Red would be six plus five equals eleven years old. Finally, since all four birds are in the same car, they have to add up to twelve years old together. Therefore, the sum of their ages is 13 + 11 + 5 = twenty-nine years old.
"Response:  We know that Jessica has three debts with different minimum payments per month:

1. Student loans: $300/month
2. Credit card: $200/month
3. Mortgage: $500/month

Jessica wants to pay an additional 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt. So, if we calculate the total minimum payment for each debt and then add the extra amount she wants to pay, we can find out how much she will pay in a year.

Let's start with the student loans:

Minimum payment = $300/month
Extra payment = $300 x 1.5 (50% increase) = $450
Total payment = $300 + $450 = $750/month

For the credit card:

Minimum payment = $200/month
Extra payment = $200 x 1.5 = $300
Total payment = $200 + $300 = $500/month

And for the mortgage:

Minimum payment = $500/month
Extra payment = $500 x 1.5 = $750
Total payment = $500 + $750 = $1,250/month

Now, let's calculate the total payment for one year:

Student loans:
Total payment for one year = $750/month x 12 months = $9,000

Credit card:
Total payment for one year = $500/month x 12 months = $6,000

Mortgage:
Total payment for one year = $1,250/month x 12 months = $15,000

Adding all these amounts gives us the total annual payment:

Total annual payment = $9,000 + $6,000 + $15,000 = $30,000

So, Jessica will pay $30,000 in one year if she pays the minimum payment plus the extra 50% for each of her"
"Response:  We know that Billy takes approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel one potato (1.5 minutes). And he takes only 5 seconds to cut each potato after peeling. So if we want to calculate how long it will take him to prepare 60 potatoes, we can use this information:

Time to prepare 1 potato = 1.5 minutes
Time to prepare n potatoes = 1.5 minutes x n (where n is the number of potatoes)

In this case, n = 60, so:

Time to prepare 60 potatoes = 1.5 minutes x 60 = 90 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 90 minutes to prepare 60 potatoes for his family reunion."
"Response:  We know that they sell each glass for $0.50 and obtain 20 glasses per gallon. So, their total revenue from one gallon is:

Revenue = Number of glasses x Price per glass
= 20 x $0.50
= $10

We also know that they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar for every gallon. So, their total cost per gallon is:

Cost = Cost of lemons + Cost of sugar
= $3 + $2
= $5

Since they obtained a profit of $25, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $10 - $5
= $5

Now, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. Since the profit is $5, we can say that the amount spent on lemons is half of the profit:

Amount spent on lemons = Profit / 2
= $5 / 2
= $2.50

So, Juan and Carlos spent $2.50 on lemons for every gallon of lemonade they prepared."
Response:  We know that there are 80 Japanese runners and the rest (160) are Chinese. If the number of children in the Chinese team is 60, then the number of adults must be 160 - 60 = 100. Since all the Chinese runners are either boys or girls, we can conclude that there are 100 boys and 100 girls in the Chinese team. Therefore, there are 100 x 2 = 200 girls in the Chinese team.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Zaid spends on rent, gasoline, and his charitable donation. Then, we will subtract these amounts from his monthly income to find out how much he has left after all of these expenses and donations. Finally, we will add the amount he gives to his daughter and wife to determine his final balance.

Step 1: Calculate Expenditures
Rent: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500
Gasoline: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000
Charitable Donation: Half of $6000 = $3000
Total Expenditures: $1500 + $2000 + $3000 = $6500

Step 2: Subtract Expenditures from Income
$6000 - $6500 = -$500 (Zaid has spent more than he earned)

Step 3: Add Amount Given to Family Members
-$500 + $200 + $700 = $1200

Final Answer: Zaid has $1200 left after all of his expenses and donations."
Response:  We know that Monic has 4 less than Bo, so if Bo has 40 cangrejos, then Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 cangrejos. Now we need to find out how many cangrejos Rani has. Since she has ten more than Monic, Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 cangrejos. Therefore, the total number of cangrejos that the three have together is 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 cangrejos.
"Response:  We know that Lloyd earned $10 per hour and he worked for 5 hours during the first week and 8 hours during the second week. So, let's calculate his earnings for each week separately.
Week 1:
Earnings = Number of hours x Rate per hour
= 5 x $10
= $50

Week 2:
Earnings = Number of hours x Rate per hour
= 8 x $10
= $80

Now, we add up his earnings for both weeks to find out how much he earned in total:
Total Earnings = Week 1 Earnings + Week 2 Earnings
= $50 + $80
= $130
Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 in the two weeks."
"Response:  We know that there are two candidates running for class delegate in Sarai's school, and we also know that one of them received 3/4 of the votes cast. If we let X be the number of votes received by the winner, then Y is the number of votes received by the loser. Since the total number of students who voted was 80, we can set up the equation:
X + Y = 80... (1)
We also know that X is equal to 3/4 of the total number of votes cast, so we can write:
X = 3/4(80)... (2)
Substituting (2) into (1), we get:
3/4(80) + Y = 80
Y = 80 - 3/4(80)
Y = 80 - 60
Y = 20
So the loser received 20 votes."
"Response:  We know that Sandra requested four times more red roses than white cloves. So if she requested x white cloves, she requested 4x = 4x + 3 (since there are three types of flowers) red roses. In total, she requested 7x + 3 flowers. Since she also requested 200 calla lilies, which is five times the number of white cloves, we can write:  

7x + 3 = 10(200) = 2000 + 3

Solving for x, we get:

7x = 1997

x = 286

Therefore, Sandra requested 286 red roses and 3 calla lilies. To keep her business, Fred must deliver at least 286 red roses before 5 pm."
"Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age. So we can start with Mark's age two years ago. 
Mark's age two years ago = (5 x 2) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14 years old
Now we need to find out how old Jan was two years ago. Since she is two years older than Mark, her age two years ago would be:
Jan's age two years ago = Mark's age two years ago + 2 = 14 + 2 = 16 years old
So, two years ago, Jan was 16 years old and Mark was 14 years old. Now let's move forward in time to the present day when Jan is 30 years old. 
Jean's current age = Jan's current age + 2 = 30 + 2 = 32 years old
Therefore, if Jan is currently 30 years old, then Jean is 32 years old."
"Response:  We know that each member of the well-formed team will run their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, so we can set up an equation for their total time as follows:

Total Time = (55 + 55 + 55 + 55) = 220 seconds

Now, let's look at the other team. We know that the first runner will take 60 seconds to complete their 400 meters, and each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, we can set up an equation for their total time as follows:

Total Time = (60 + 57 + 54 + 51) = 218 seconds

Since the well-formed team has a total time of 220 seconds, and the less formed team has a total time of 218 seconds, the well-formed team will win by 2 seconds."
"Response:  If Jerry rolls two dice, there are six possible outcomes for each die:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is:  
6 x 6 = 36. 
Now, let's count how many of these outcomes have two consecutive even numbers:  
(2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6). There are five such outcomes. 
So, the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers is:  
5/36 or approximately 0.139 (13.9%). 
On the other hand, if Jerry rolls one die, there are only three possible outcomes:  1, 2, or 3. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:  
3/3 = 1 (100%). 
Therefore, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 with one die is certain, whereas the probability of him rolling two consecutive even numbers with two dice is about 13.9%."
Response:  If Jenna collected half of her mother's apples, then she collected half of 20 apples, which is 10 apples. So both Jenna and her mother together collected 20 + 10 = 30 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 10 jaulas of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, in total, there are 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of straw for the hamsters. Now we know that there are 160 pieces of straw in total for all the small rodents. Therefore, the number of small rodents other than hamsters is:  160 - 50 = 110. Since each group of small rodents (other than hamsters) has 6 pieces of straw, there must be:  110 / 6 = 18 groups of small rodents. Finally, since each group contains 6 rats, there are:  18 x 6 = 108 rats in total.
"Response:  We know that Mandy borrowed $100 from Benedict at an interest rate of 2% per month for 3 months. To find out how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount owed using the formula for compound interest:  
Total Amount = Principal x (1 + Interest Rate)^Number of Periods  
In this case, the principal is $100, the interest rate is 2%, and the number of periods is 3 months or 90 days. So, let's plug in these values into our formula:  
Total Amount = $100 x (1 + 0.02)^(90)  
Using a calculator or spreadsheet, we can calculate the future value of $100 invested for 90 days at an interest rate of 2%. The result is approximately $106.48. Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.48 after 3 months to settle her debt."
"Response:  We know that the cost of each sack is $20 and the profit per sack is $10 ($30 - $20). So if the merchant sold x sacks, his total revenue would be:

x \* $30 = $400... (1)

We also know that the cost of transporting each sack is $2, so the total cost for the merchant would be:

x \* $2 + $20(x) = $2x + $20x = $2x + $40... (2)

Now we can solve this system of equations. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:

$2x + $40 = $2x + $400

Simplifying, we have:

$2x = $360

Solving for x, we get:

x = 180

So the merchant sold 180 sacks of wheat."
"Response:  We know that they spent $20,25 in total and went to two attractions that costed $33 each. So, we can calculate how much they spent on each attraction:  
$20,25 / 2 = $10,12 per attraction. 
Now, let's subtract what they spent on food from their total spending:  
$20,25 - $4,50 = $15,75. 
Since they divided all costs equally among themselves, each person paid:  
$15,75 / 3 = $5,25."
"Response:  We know that John collects duraznos for 3 hours and can collect 2 duraznos per minute. So we need to calculate how many minutes he spends collecting duraznos.  
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 180 minutes in 3 hours (3 x 60 = 180). Now we can calculate how many duraznos John collects:  
180 minutes x 2 duraznos/minute = 360 duraznos  
So John collects 360 duraznos during his 3-hour durazno collection period."
Response:  We know that each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks in total. So, if we divide 3.5 by 10, we get 0.35 pounds (or 350 grams) of insects needed per day for each duck. Since there are ten ducks, we need 3.5 x 10 = 35 pounds (or 15.9 kilograms) of insects per day for the entire flock.
"Response:  We know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees each year. So after one year, he has planted 10 new trees but has also cut down 2 old trees. Therefore, the total number of trees he has is:

10 (new trees) - 2 (old trees) = 8

Now let's consider what happens over the next 9 years. Each year, Tom plants 10 new trees and cuts down 2 old trees, so we can repeat this process for each year:

Year 2:

10 (new trees) - 2 (old trees) = 8

Year 3:

10 (new trees) - 2 (old trees) = 6

Year 4:

10 (new trees) - 2 (old trees) = 4

Year 5:

10 (new trees) - 2 (old trees) = 2

Year 6:

10 (new trees) - 2 (old trees) = 0

So after 6 years, all the old trees have been cut down, leaving only the new trees that were planted in those years. In total, there are:

2 + 4 + 6 +... + 0 = 20

trees left.

However, we are told that after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. This means that 30% of 20 trees is:

30% x 20 = 6

Trees will die. Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has:

20 - 6 = 14

trees left."
Response:  We know that there were initially 18 flamingos in the garden (plastic pink). Then, one-third of them were painted white and put back in the garden. So, if we divide 18 by three, we get six. Six flamingos were painted white and placed back in the garden. Now, let's add the new 18 flamingos that were added on Sunday morning. If we add 18 + 6 = 24 flamingos, we have our final total. Therefore, there were 24 flamingos in the garden on Sunday afternoon.
"Response:  We know that Violeta needs 5 different colors of crayons and each crayon costs $2. So if she has $20 to spend, we can calculate how much change she will receive as follows:  
$20 (total amount) - ($2 x 5 = $10) (cost of 5 crayons) = $20 - $10 = $10  
Therefore, Violeta will receive $10 in change."
"Response:  We know that one bolígrafo costs as much as one lapiz and one goma de borrar combined. So if we want to find out how much 8 bolígrafos will cost, we need to first find out how much one lapiz and one goma de borrar cost together.
We know that one lapiz costs $1.20, so one goma de borrar must cost $1.20 x 0.30 = $0.36.
Now we can calculate the total cost of one bolígrafo: $1.20 + $0.36 = $1.56.
To find out how much 8 bolígrafos will cost, we multiply the cost of one bolígrafo by 8: $1.56 x 8 = $12.48.
So 8 bolígrafos will cost $12.48 each."
"Response:  We know that there are 200 pounds of zucchini and we want to distribute them among 40 restaurants so each restaurant receives 2 pounds of zucchini. To do this, we can use long division.

First, let's divide 200 by 40 to find out how many pounds each restaurant will receive:

200 / 40 = 5

So each restaurant will receive 5 pounds of zucchini. Now, let's subtract the total amount received by all restaurants from the total weight of zucchini available:

200 - (40 x 5) = 200 - 200 = 0

Therefore, none of the zucchinis will be left over. All 200 pounds have been distributed among the 40 restaurants."
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23,786 inhabitants in Soda, and this includes both men and women. So we can start by dividing the total population into two groups: men and women.

Let x be the number of children in Soda. Then we can write an equation based on the information given:

x + 8417 + 9092 = 23786... (1)

Now we have three variables: x, 8417, and 9092. To solve for x, we can subtract 8417 and 9092 from both sides of equation (1):

x + 8417 + 9092 - 8417 - 9092 = 23786 - 8417 - 9092

Simplifying, we get:

2x + 1755 = 23786

Subtracting 1755 from both sides gives us:

2x = 22031

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 11015

So there are 11,015 children in Soda."
Response:  We know that Elaine had 20 cards at first and then she got three times more, so she has 3 x 20 = 60 cards now. Then we are told that in the second month, she lost 20 cards, so she has 60 - 20 = 40 cards left. Finally, we are told that in the third month, she doubled her collection from both months, so she has 40 + (2 x 40) = 40 + 80 = 120 cards in total.
Response:  We know that Mark reviews 1000 sentences per week and gets paid $5 per sentence from Editorial A. So he earns $5 x 1000 = $5000 per week from Editorial A. Since Editorial B pays him double what Editorial A does, Mark earns $5 x 1000 = $10,000 per week from Editorial B. Therefore, in one week, Mark earns a total of $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.
"Response:  We know that Baldur takes out 5 buckets of water in the morning and 6 buckets of water in the evening. Each bucket contains 5 liters of water. So let's calculate how many liters of water he collects each day. 
Morning: 5 x 5 = 25 liters
Evening: 6 x 5 = 30 liters
Total daily collection: 25 + 30 = 55 liters
Therefore, Baldur collects 55 liters of water every day."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much he earned in that year without the prize money. To do this, we multiply his weekly wage of $2000 by the number of weeks in a year (52). So, he earned:

$2000 x 52 = $104,000 per year

Now, let's add the prize money of $5000 to this amount:

$104,000 + $5000 = $119,000 per year

So, John earned $119,000 in that year."
"Response:  We know that each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. So if we multiply 5 tons/acre x 10 acres = 50 tons of grapes per year. Then we can calculate how many barrels of wine are produced as follows:  
50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year. 
Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Response:  We know that Carl used 2 rebanadas of cheese in each sandwich for lunch (3 days x 2 = 6), and he also used one more slice per tortilla for breakfast (3 days x 1 = 3). So far we have:

6 + 3 = 9

He also prepared a large pasta dish with 8 slices of cheese for several dinners during the week. Therefore, we add:

9 + 8 = 17

So, Carl used 17 slices of cheese this week."
Response:  First, we know that Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens for a total of 32 pens. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 each (for a total of 54) and 2 bags of red pens with 6 each (for a total of 12). In all, Janet has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.
"Response:  We know that Brinley has already taken five exams and needs to get a 93 average for the semester. If we subtract the lowest score of 71 from the total scores, we can see how many points Brinley needs to reach a 93 average.  
Total Scores = (89 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 467  
Lowest Score = 71  
New Total Scores = 467 - 71 = 396  
To get an average of 93, Brinley needs to have at least 93 x 6 = 558 points. Since she already has 396 points, she only needs 162 more points to achieve her goal. Therefore, in the sixth exam, Brinley must receive at least 162/6 = 27 out of 60 points to obtain a final grade of 93 for the semester."
"Response:  We know that Michael rode his bike for four weeks, so we can start by calculating how many kilometers he rode each week during those four weeks.

Week 1: 5 times a week x 25 km/day = 125 km/week
Weeks 2-4: 2 times a week x 60 km/day = 120 km/week (since he rides twice a week, but for longer distances)

Total distance traveled in four weeks = 125 km/week + 120 km/week + 120 km/week + 120 km/week = 480 km

Therefore, Michael traveled a total of 480 kilometers over the course of four weeks."
Response:  We know that there are 25 bars of chocolate and each bar weighs twice as much as one piece of confited apple. So if each bar weighs 40g, then each piece of confited apple must weigh 40/2 = 20g. Since there are 80 pieces of confited apple in total, their combined weight is 80 x 20g = 1600g. Now, let's add this to the weight of the chocolate bars: 25 x 40g = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g. Therefore, the total weight of Joe's candy bag is 2600g.
Response:  We know that Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 4 pastries. On Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought three times as many pastries as she had bought on Monday (3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought five times as many pastries as she had bought on Tuesday (5 x 12 = 60). In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 pastries over the course of three days.
"Response:  We know that 20 dozen (tazas) cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen ($6000 / 2 = $3000) plates. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Let x be the cost of one taza. Then, the cost of 20 dozen tazas is given by:  

x x 20 = $1200  

Now, we are asked to find out the cost of each taza individually. To do so, we need to divide both sides of the above equation by 20:  

x = $\frac{1200}{20}$  

Simplifying, we get:  

x = $60$  

So, the cost of each taza is $60."
"Response:  First, we know that Sara has $10 saved already and she earns $5 each time she watches her neighbor's kids (4 times). So, she will have earned $5 x 4 = $20 in total. Now, let's see how much more money she needs to buy the items:

Chaqueta: $30 - $10 (what she already has) = $20
Zapatos (2 pairs): $20 x 2 = $40
Total amount needed: $20 + $40 = $60

So, Sara needs to earn an additional $60 before she can afford the chaqueta and the two pairs of shoes. Since she earns $5 per time she watches the kids, she will need to do it 60/5 = 12 times. Therefore, Sara should expect to watch her neighbor's kids 12 times before she can buy the new clothes."
"Response:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and has two more white chickens than red ones. So if he had x red chickens, he would have 2x white chickens. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let X be the number of red chickens:

X + 2(white chickens) = Total Number of Chickens (T)

We know that T is equal to 42 eggs collected daily:

X + 2(white chickens) = 42

Now we need to find out how many white chickens Jerry has. Since each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, we can write:

2(white chickens) = 10 (since 2 x 5 = 10)

Substituting this into our first equation, we get:

X + 10 = 42

Solving for X, we get:

X = 32

So Jerry has 32 red chickens."
"Response:  We know that Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour and he wants to walk along the edge of the park which is a rectangle with dimensions of 1.5 miles x 6 miles. To find out how many hours it takes for him to complete his walk, we need to divide the distance he needs to cover (perimeter of the park) by his walking speed:

Perimeter of the park = 2(l+w) = 2(1.5 + 6) = 2 x 7.5 = 15 miles

Time taken = Distance / Speed = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
Response:  We know that on the first day, there were 100 clients and on the second day, there were 50 more than the previous day, so on the second day, there were 100 + 50 = 150 clients. Now we need to find out how many clients there were on the third day. If there were 500 clients in total, then on the third day, there must have been 500 - (150 + 100) = 500 - 250 = 250 clients. So, on the third day, Sloane counted 250 clients.
"Response:  We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. So if we start with the same amount of water in both pools (let's say x gallons), after t minutes, the large pool will have lost 4t gallons and the small pool will have lost 4t gallons as well. Since the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool, it will lose four times as much water as the small pool for each minute that passes. Therefore, after 4 minutes, the large pool will have lost 4(4) = 16 gallons, and the small pool will have lost 4(4) = 16 gallons as well.
So, to find out how many gallons of water the small pool has now, we need to subtract the amount of water it lost from its initial amount. In other words, we can set up an equation like this:
x - 16 =?
where x is the initial amount of water in the small pool. Solving for x, we get:
x = 32
Therefore, the small pool has 32 gallons of water left."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Lori needs in total for her purchase:

$320 (zapatos) + $32 (cinto) = $352

Now, let's see how many hours of work she needs to do to earn that amount:

$352 / $8/hour = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford her purchase."
"Response:  We know that Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% interest. This means she will pay back $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200 in total.  
Now we are told that Janeth is going to pay $165 per month for 12 months. So let's calculate how much she will have paid at the end of the 12th month:  
$165 x 12 = $1980  
So, after 12 months, Janeth will have paid a total of $1980. But this is less than the amount she owes ($2200), so she will still owe $2200 - $1980 = $220 as a balance."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 daisies more than roses. So if we add 7 to 4, we get:

4 + 7 = 11

Therefore, there are 11 flowers in the vase in total."
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet and half of Zack's age. So we can start with these two equations:  
Adrian's age = 3 x Harriet's age + (Zack's age / 2) 
Harriet's age = 21 years 
Now let's substitute Harriet's age into the first equation:  
Adrian's age = 3 x 21 + (Zack's age / 2) 
Adrian's age = 63 + (Zack's age / 2) Now we need to find out what Zack's age is. Since Harriet is 21 years old now, Zack must be twice her age plus one year. Therefore:  
Zack's age = 2 x 21 + 1 
Zack's age = 42 + 1 
Zack's age = 43 Now we can substitute Zack's age back into the equation for Adrian's age:  
Adrian's age = 63 + (43 / 2) 
Adrian's age = 63 + 21.5 
Adrian's age = 84.5 The average age of all three people in three years will be:  
(Adrian's current age + Harriet's current age + Zack's current age) / 3 
= (84.5 + 21 + 43) / 3 
= 149 / 3 
= 49.7 years"
"Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score. So, if we let X be the number of points Yuri scored, then:
X = (1/2)Naomi + 10
We also know that Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so:
Brianna = Naomi + 17
Now we have two equations and three unknowns (Naomi, X, and Brianna). Can you use these equations to find out how many points each student scored?"
"Response:  We know that it takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to complete a Sudoku puzzle. If she solved 3 crosswords and 8 Sudokus during the weekend, we can calculate how much time she spent on each activity as follows:  

Time spent on crosswords = 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes
Time spent on Sudokus = 8 x 5 minutes = 40 minutes
Therefore, in total, Carmen dedicated 70 minutes (30 + 40) to these games over the weekend."
"Response:  First, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:  

Tank capacity - Amount used = 120 L - 90 L = 30 L 
Now, we are told that Celine collected rainwater that was double the amount of water left in the tank. Therefore, the total amount of water she collected is:  

Double the amount left in the tank = 2 x 30 L = 60 L 
So, there are now 60 liters of water in the tank after Celine collected rainwater."
"Response:  We know that Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer than geraniums are petunias. So we can start by finding out how many petunias he plants.  
We know that there are 90 - 40 = 50 more geraniums than petunias. Therefore, Andy plants 50 petunias. 
Now let's add up all the flowers Andy plants: 90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers in total."
"Response:  We know that the company spent one-third of $15,000 in advertising for the second year, so we can calculate how much they spent in the first year. 
First Year Advertising Cost = Total Advertising Cost / 3 
First Year Advertising Cost = $15,000 / 3 
First Year Advertising Cost = $5,000 
Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising over two years is: 
Total Advertising Cost = First Year Advertising Cost + Second Year Advertising Cost 
Total Advertising Cost = $5,000 + ($15,000 / 3) 
Total Advertising Cost = $5,000 + $5,000 
Total Advertising Cost = $10,000"
"Response:  We know that Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour and Benji rents a banana-shaped inflatable boat for $18 per hour. If Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours and Benji uses the banana-shaped inflatable boat for 5 hours, we need to calculate how much they will pay in total.

First, let's calculate how much Carlos will pay:
Carlos pays $30 x 3 = $90 for 3 hours of using the canoe.

Next, let's calculate how much Benji will pay:
Benji pays $18 x 5 = $90 for 5 hours of using the banana-shaped inflatable boat.

So, both Carlos and Benji will pay $90 each for their respective watercraft rentals. In total, they will pay $90 + $90 = $180."
Response:  We know that it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half as many days (3) to travel back in an automobile. Therefore, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will spend 6 + 3 = 9 days on his trip.
"Response:  We know that James has 40 cards of type water and he loses 8 of them. So, after losing 8, he will have:

40 - 8 = 32

cards of type water left. Now, if he buys 14 cards of type grass, so his total number of cards becomes:

32 + 14 = 46

Now, we need to find out the percentage of probability of a randomly chosen card being of type water. To do this, we can use the formula:

Percentage = (number of cards of type water / total number of cards) x 100

In our case, the number of cards of type water is 32, and the total number of cards is 46. So, we can calculate as follows:

Percentage = (32 / 46) x 100
= (8 / 9) x 100
= 88.75%

So, the percentage of probability of a randomly chosen card being of type water is approximately 88.75%."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much does Chad owe for his meal without any discounts or promotions. To do this, we add up all the extra ingredients he added to his burrito:

$2.00 (carne de res) + $1.00 (queso) + $1.00 (palta) + $0.25 (salsa 1) + $0.25 (salsa 2) = $6.50 (base price of the burrito) + $4.25 (extra ingredients) = $10.75

Now, since Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, we subtract that from the total amount he owes:

$10.75 - $5.00 = $5.75

So, Chad needs to pay an additional $5.75 to cover the cost of his meal."
"Response:  We know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mom can add half as many pieces per minute. So, if we let X be the number of minutes it takes for them to assemble the puzzle, then we have the following equation:

X + (1/2)X = 360

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(1 1/2)X = 360

Solving for X, we find that it will take them 240 minutes or 4 hours to assemble the puzzle."
Response:  We know that 30% of the watermelons were ready to harvest two months after they were planted, so we can assume that 70% of them were not yet ripe. Then, three weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready to be picked, which means that 1/4 of them were still not ripe. So, if we multiply 1/4 by the total number of watermelons (120), we get 30. Therefore, there were 30 watermelons that were not yet ripe for harvesting after two weeks.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much taxes Mark needs to pay for each car and then add that amount to the cost of the vehicle.

Step 1: Calculate taxes
Tax rate is 10% so we can calculate taxes as follows:
$20,000 x 0.10 = $2,000 (tax per car)

Step 2: Add taxes to the cost of the vehicle
$20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000 (total cost per car)

Now let's multiply this total cost by 12 to get the total amount paid by Mark:

$22,000 x 12 = $264,000

So Mark pays a total of $264,000 for his fleet of 12 cars."
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so if Robert collected 20 shells, then Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collected 2 x 25 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that there are 50 hormigas (ants) in the orchard and half of them are bugs. So we can start by calculating how many bugs there are:

Half of 50 = 25

So, there are 25 bugs in the orchard.

Now, let's add the number of ants to get the total number of insects:

25 + 50 = 75

Therefore, there are 75 insects in the orchard."
Response:  We know that there are initially 36 pingüinos taking sun in the snow. If one-third of them jump into the ocean to swim (12), then we have 36 - 12 = 24 left. Of these, if another third go to feed in the cave (8), we will be left with 24 - 8 = 16. So, finally, there would still be 16 pingüinos taking sun in the snow.
"Response:  We know that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and his girlfriend eats 2 tomatoes per day. So, in total, they eat 8 tomatoes per day (6 + 2). Since each branch can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we need to calculate how many branches are needed to provide enough tomatoes for both Steve and his girlfriend. To do this, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per day by the number of tomatoes each branch produces per week:  

8 tomatoes/day = x branches/week

We know that there are 7 days in a week, so we can rewrite the equation as follows:

8 tomatoes/day = x branches/7 days

Now, we can solve for ""x"" by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

x branches/7 days = 8 tomatoes/day

x = 8 \* 7 = 56 branches

Therefore, Steve needs 56 branches to grow enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend can eat 4 portions of pizza. So we need to calculate how many portions in total.  
Total number of portions = Number of friends x Number of portions per friend  
Total number of portions = 20 x 4  
Total number of portions = 80  
Now we know that each pizza is cut into 8 portions, so we can divide the total number of portions by the number of portions per pizza to find out how many pizzas John needs.  
Number of pizzas = Total number of portions / Number of portions per pizza  
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8  
Number of pizzas = 10  
Therefore, John should order 10 pizzas to ensure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 portions."
"Response:  If Ram uses five empty pens to fill one full pen, then he can make:  
5 x (1/5) = 1 full pen using five empty pens. 
So, if he has 25 empty pens, he can make:  
25 x 1 = 25 full pens using all 25 empty pens. 
Therefore, in total, Ram will have 25 + 25 = 50 full pens."
"Response:  First, we know that Johnny took his allowance of $20 and added $10 more, so he had a total of $30. Then, we are told that this amount tripled in one year, which means it increased by a factor of 3. So, if we multiply $30 by 3, we get:

$30 x 3 = $90

So, after one year, Johnny had $90."
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so if Joan has five more years than Jessa, then Joan must be five + 2 = seven years older than Jessa. Therefore, the ages of the three girls are:
Mary (two years younger than Joan): 20 - 2 = 18 years old
Joan (seven years older than Jessa): 20 + 7 = 27 years old
Jessa: 20 years old
So, the total age of the three girls is:
18 + 27 + 20 = 65 years old"
"Response:  We know that there were initially 1000 students in the auditorium and after the meeting, 30% of them left through entrance A (30% of 1000 = 300). So, we have to subtract 300 from 1000 to get the number of students remaining inside the building.  
Now, we know that 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., 600) left through exit B. Therefore, the total number of students who left through exit B is 600 x 5/6 = 400.  
Finally, we are asked to find out how many students left through exit C. To do this, we need to subtract the total number of students who left through exits A and B from the initial number of students. In other words, we need to subtract 300 + 400 = 700 from 1000.  
So, the number of students who left through exit C is 1000 - 700 = 300."
"Response:  We know that:

1. James has 6 more than Robert. So if Robert has x caramelos, James has x + 6 caramelos.
2. John has double the number of caramelos as Robert. So if Robert has x caramelos, John has 2x caramelos.
3. We are told that John has 54 caramelos. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

2x = 54

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 54
2x = 108
x = 54

Now we can find out how many caramelos James has by using the first equation:

James has x + 6 caramelos = (54) + 6 = 60 caramelos

So James has 60 caramelos and John has 54 caramelos. Therefore, John has 6 more caramelos than James."
"Response: 
Dolly reads her own book and Pandora's book, so she reads two books in total.
Pandora reads her own book and Dolly's book, so she also reads two books in total.
Therefore, together they read four books in total."
"Response:  We have to calculate how many hours he spends writing per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month. So we need to know how many letters he receives per week and how long each letter takes to write.

Let's assume that he receives 2 letters per week from each of the remaining 3 friends (since he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them). Therefore, he receives a total of 6 letters per week (2 x 3 = 6).

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he has to spend 5 minutes writing each page (1 minute per page x 5 pages per letter = 5 minutes per letter). Since there are 2 letters per week, he spends a total of 10 minutes per week writing responses to his remaining pen pals (2 letters x 5 minutes per letter = 10 minutes per week).

Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends writing per week:

10 minutes/week = 0.17 hours/week (convert minutes to hours)

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he spends a total of:

0.17 hours/week x 4 weeks/month = 0.78 hours/month (calculate total hours spent writing per month)

Therefore, he spends approximately 0.78 hours or 46 minutes per month writing responses to his pen pals."
"Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 minutes per month and he has already made 300 additional calls this month. So we can subtract 300 from 1000 to find out how many minutes are left for him to use this month:  
1000 - 300 = 700 minutes 
Therefore, Jason has 700 minutes left to use this month if he has 30 days in April."
"Response:  We know that Kyle took away 5 potatoes from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 potatoes left. Then, Billy came and took double the amount that Kyle took, which is 2 x 5 = 10 potatoes. So, Griffin now has 19 - 10 = 9 potatoes left. Next, Ginger gave some of her potatoes to Griffin, but we don't know how many. Finally, Colby took 3 fewer potatoes than what Kyle took, which is 3 less than 5 = 2 potatoes. Therefore, the total number of potatoes Griffin has after all these events is 9 + 2 = 11 potatoes. Since Griffin finally has 27 potatoes, we can set up an equation:

11 + x = 27

where x is the number of potatoes Ginger gave to Griffin. Solving for x, we get:

x = 16

So, Ginger gave 16 potatoes to Griffin."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 caracolas in one aquarium and 32 caracolas in another aquarium. The difference between the number of caracolas in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So we can write an equation based on this information:

Let X be the number of fish in the first aquarium (with 4 caracolas)
Let Y be the number of fish in the second aquarium (with 32 caracolas)

We know that the difference between X and Y is twice the number of fish:

X + Y = 4 + 32

Simplifying the equation:

2X + 2Y = 48

Now we need to solve for X and Y. To do this, we can subtract 2X from both sides of the equation:

2Y = 48 - 2X

Substituting Y = 32:

2(32) = 48 - 2X

64 = 2X

Dividing both sides by 2:

32 = X

So there are 32 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  We know that the makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours each day (4 times a week) for 5 weeks. That means she will work for a total of:

6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = 1200 hours

Now we need to calculate how much Jean paid in total. Since the makeup artist gives a 10% discount after completing the film, we can use the following formula:

Total amount paid = (Number of hours worked x Hourly rate) x (1 + Discount percentage)

In this case, the number of hours worked is 1200 hours, the hourly rate is $250, and the discount percentage is 10%. So we can plug these values into the formula like this:

Total amount paid = ($250/hour x 1200 hours) x (1 + 0.10)
= $30,000 x 1.10
= $33,000

Therefore, Jean paid $33,000 for the makeup services over the course of the 5-week film shoot."
Response:  We know that Isabelle spent in total $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 on the party supplies. Since she divided it into three parts equal with her father and mother, each person paid $96 / 3 = $32.
"Response:  We know that each bag of onions weighs 50 pounds and costs $1.50 per pound. So if we multiply 50 pounds by $1.50 per pound, we get:  
50 lbs x $1.50/lb = $75 per bag  
Since the chef bought 4 bags of onions, we can calculate the total amount he spent as follows:  
$75 per bag x 4 bags = $300  
Therefore, the chef spent $300 on onions."
Response:  We know that Sue ate 4 times more than her sister on Monday and 2 times more on Tuesday. So if her sister ate x galletas on Monday (x = 5), then Sue ate 4x = 20 galletas. On Tuesday, her sister ate x = 13 galletas, so Sue ate 2x = 26 galletas. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 galletas. Since each galette has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories more than her sister.
