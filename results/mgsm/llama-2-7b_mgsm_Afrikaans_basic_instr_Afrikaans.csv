In this example, the question is asking for the total amount of fabric needed to make a clothing item that requires 2 bolts of blue velvet and half as much white velvet. To answer this question, we need to calculate the total length of fabric required based on the amounts of each color requested.

So, if we assume that one bolt of blue velvet is 5 meters long (a common length for a bolt of fabric), then two bolts would be 10 meters long (2 x 5 = 10). And if half of that is white velvet, then the total length of fabric required would be 5 meters + 2.5 meters = 7.5 meters.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 7.5 meters."

Explanation:
Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses of wine. The price of the first glass is $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the previous price. Therefore, the price of the second glass is $5 x 0.6 = $3, and so on. To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for all 16 glasses, we can multiply the price of each glass by the number of glasses he wants to buy: $5 x 16 = $80 + $3 x 16 = $48 + $3 x 4 = $24 + $3 = $27. So, Kylar needs to pay a total of $27 for all 16 glasses of wine."

Response:  To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from the eucalyptus tree, we need to calculate the total cost of raising and maintaining the tree over that period. The total cost can be calculated as follows:  Total Cost = Initial Investment + Annual Maintenance Costs x Number of Years  Initial Investment = $90 (cost of planting the tree) Annual Maintenance Costs = $3 (cost of watering and fertilizing the tree each year) Number of Years =? To find the number of years it will take for Carlos to break even on his investment, we need to divide the initial investment by the annual maintenance costs: Number of Years = Initial Investment / Annual Maintenance Costs = $90 / $3 = 30 years Therefore, it will take Carlos 30 years to start making a profit from his eucalyptus tree.

Please note that the question has been edited for clarity and simplicity. The original question included additional details such as the time period over which the investments will be made, and the interest rates for each investment option. However, these details are not relevant to the calculation of the expected return on investment, which is the focus of this problem. Therefore, I have simplified the question by assuming that the investments will be made at the end of the month, and that the interest rates are fixed for the entire month."

Explanation:

We know that Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, so her running speed is 4 times the walking speed. We also know that she can walk at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and that she runs at a rate of 12 miles per hour.

To find out how many miles she can cover in 6 hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we need to use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

For running:
Speed = 12 miles/hour
Time = 1/3 hour (or 20 minutes)
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 20 minutes = 240 miles

For walking:
Speed = 3 miles/hour
Time = 2/3 hour (or 40 minutes)
Distance = 3 miles/hour x 40 minutes = 120 miles

So, in total, Dana covers 240 + 120 = 360 miles in 6 hours."

Response: 24 bokse.  Oorsprong: Die maksimum Gewig van die brug is 5000 pond. Die Gewig van die bestuurder en die leë vragmotor is 3755 pond. Die Gewig van elke bok is 15 pond. Die totaal Gewig van alle bokke moet minder as die maximale Gewig van die brug wees. Om dit te bereken, maak gebruik van de formule: Total weight = number of boxes x weight per box. In this case, the total weight would be: Total weight = 24 bokse x 15 pounds per bok = 360 pounds. Since the maximum weight of the bridge is 5000 pounds and the total weight of all the boxes plus the driver and the motor is less than that, it means that at most 24 boxes can be placed on the motor without exceeding the maximum weight limit of the bridge.

Response:  To determine the total number of people sent by each school, we need to multiply the number of teams (4) by the number of players per team (5). Then, we add the number of substitutes (afrigters) sent by each school. Finally, we divide the total number of people by the number of schools participating in the tournament. Here's the calculation: Total number of people = (Number of teams x Number of players per team) + (Number of substitutes x Number of schools) / Number of schools Total number of people = (4 x 5) + (10 x 4) / 4 Total number of people = 20 + 40 / 4 Total number of people = 68 The answer is 68 people sent by each school.

"Response:  $46.80 
Explanation:  To calculate the total income of Lucas per week, we need to multiply the number of clients he has by the cost of each product they will buy. For example, if he has 3 clients and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cleaning supplies, then the total cost for those products would be:

3 clients x 2 bottles of bleach = 6 bottles of bleach @ $2 per bottle = $12
3 clients x 1 pack of cleaning supplies = 3 packs of cleaning supplies @ $5 per pack = $15
Total cost = $12 + $15 = $27

Therefore, Lucas's total income per week from his current clients would be:

$27 x 3 clients = $81

Now, let's assume that Lucas manages to sign up 5 more potential clients, who will also require the same amount of products as his current clients. The total cost for these additional products would be:

5 new clients x 2 bottles of bleach = 10 bottles of bleach @ $2 per bottle = $20
5 new clients x 1 pack of cleaning supplies = 5 packs of cleaning supplies @ $5 per pack = $25
Total cost = $20 + $25 = $45

Lucas's total income per week from all his clients, including the new ones, would be:

$81 (from current clients) + $45 (from new clients) = $126

So, Lucas's total weekly income would be $126."

"Response: 57600 cm (lengte) / 24 ure = 2380 cm/uur

Het is belangrijk om te onthou dat de lengte van ieder gedeelte afhankelijk is van de grootte van het gedeelte. In dit geval zijn de broodjes 4 duim lang, de croissants 6 duim lang en de baguettes 1 meter lang. Om de totale lengte van alle gebakken producten te berekenen, moeten we de lengte van elk gedeelte multipliceren door de aantal gedeeltes dat Bill elke dag bakt. Hierdoor krijgen we de volgende cijfers:

* Broodjes: 300 x 4 duim = 1200 cm
* Croissants: 120 x 6 duim = 720 cm
* Baguettes: 60 x 1 meter = 60 meters

Als we nu de totale lengte van alle gebakken producten berekenen, zien we dat er in 24 uur ongeveer 2380 cm/uur wordengebakken (57600 cm / 24 ure). Dit betekent dat Bill elke dag ongeveer 950 cm/uur bakt (2380 cm/uur / 24 ure)."

Explanation:
The total cost of all the toys in the room can be calculated by multiplying the number of each type of toy by its individual cost. For example, there are 5 red cars, which cost $4 each, so their total cost is $4 x 5 = $20. There are 3 action figures, which cost $5 each, so their total cost is $5 x 3 = $15. The pop toy costs $4, just like the red car, so its total cost is also $4. Therefore, the total cost of all the toys in the room is $20 + $15 + $4 = $49."

Explanation:  To calculate the amount of money that Jackie will have if she hires a tax accountant, we need to consider two factors: (1) the time saved by outsourcing the task and (2) the cost of hiring an accountant.

Time savings: By outsourcing the task, Jackie can save 3 hours of work, which is equivalent to $35 per hour based on her hourly wage rate of $35/hour. Therefore, the time savings are:

Time savings = 3 hours x $35/hour = $105

Cost of hiring an accountant: The cost of hiring an accountant is $90.

Total benefit of hiring an accountant = Time savings + Cost of hiring an accountant
= $105 + $90 = $195

Therefore, Jackie will have $217.64 more dollars if she hires a tax accountant instead of doing it herself."

Explanation:
We need to find out how many rats are in each cage. There are 3 cages with rats, and each cage has 6 rats. Therefore, the total number of rats in all 3 cages is 3 x 6 = 18 rats.

Next, we need to find out how many hamsters are in each cage. There are 10 cages with hamsters, and each cage has 5 hamsters. Therefore, the total number of hamsters in all 10 cages is 10 x 5 = 50 hamsters.

Finally, we need to find out how much food is given to each rat and hamster. The answer is 160 pieces of food, which means that each rat gets 6 pieces of food (since there are 18 rats), and each hamster gets 5 pieces of food (since there are 50 hamsters)."

"Response: 250 sent/week  Explanation:  To find out how much Mark earns per week, we need to calculate the total number of sins he edits each week and then multiply it by the amount he charges per sin for both publishers. Since Uitgewer A pays twice as much as Uitgewer B, we will first calculate the total amount Uitgewer A pays to Mark and then subtract that from the total amount paid by both publishers. Finally, we divide the remaining amount by the total number of sins edited to get the average amount earned per week.

Total number of sins edited = 1000 (given)
Amount charged per sin for Uitgewer A = 5sent (given)
Amount charged per sin for Uitgewer B = 2sent (less than given)
Total amount paid by Uitgewer A = 2 x 1000 = 2000sent (calculated)
Total amount paid by both publishers = 2000 + 1000 = 3000sent (calculated)
Average amount earned per week = (total amount paid / total number of sins edited) = (3000 / 1000) = 250sent/week"

Explanation:
The problem states that John received a bonus of $5000 and a 5% salary increase. If he makes $2000 per week throughout the year and receives the bonus on the first day of the year, how much money will he have made that year? To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money John will make in a year, taking into account the bonus and the increased salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John will make in a year without the bonus:
$2000 x 52 weeks = $104,000

Now, let's add the bonus to the total amount of money John will make in a year:
$104,000 + $5000 = $109,000

Finally, let's calculate the percentage increase in John's salary due to the bonus:
(($109,000 - $104,000) / $104,000) x 100 = 5%

Therefore, John will have made a total of $16734.89 more than he would have made without the bonus, bringing his total earnings for the year to $109,000."

Explanation:

Rose went to the shop on Monday and bought 4 cookies. On Tuesday, she went to another shop and bought three times as many cookies as she bought on Monday. On Wednesday, she went to yet another shop and bought 5 times as many cookies as she bought on Tuesday. To find out how many cookies she has bought in total after 3 days, we can use the information provided in the question.

Let x be the number of cookies Rose bought on Monday. Since she bought 3 times as many cookies on Tuesday, she bought 3x cookies on Tuesday. And since she bought 5 times as many cookies on Wednesday as she bought on Tuesday, she bought 5(3x) = 15x cookies on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of cookies Rose has bought after 3 days is 4 + 3x + 15x = 22x."

Explanation:
To calculate the outstanding balance of Janet's loan at a given time, we need to use the formula:
Outstanding Balance = (Initial Loan Amount x Interest Rate x Number of Months) / 100

In this case, the initial loan amount is $2000, the interest rate is 10%, and the number of months is 12. Therefore, the outstanding balance can be calculated as follows:
Outstanding Balance = ($2000 x 10% x 12) / 100 = $3478.94

So, at the end of 12 months, Janet's outstanding balance will be $3478.94."

Explanation:
We know that there are 50 mice in the garden and each mouse can eat 3 apples per day. Therefore, the total number of apples eaten by all the mice in one day is:

50 mice x 3 apples/mouse = 150 apples

Since Dax has been picking apples for 3 days, the total number of apples he has picked is:

150 apples/day x 3 days = 450 apples

Now, we need to calculate the total number of insects in the garden. We know that there are 1000 insects in every apple, therefore the total number of insects in all the apples Dax has picked is:

450 apples x 1000 insects/apple = 450,000 insects

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 450,000."

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how many students left through each exit and then calculate the total number of students who left through exit C.

Let's break down the information given in the question:

* 30% of the students left through exit A. This means that 300 students (30% of 1000) left through exit A.
* 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., those who did not leave through exit A) left through exit B. This means that 600 students (3/5 x 800) left through exit B.
* The remaining students (i.e., those who did not leave through exits A or B) left through exit C. This means that 400 students (1000 - 300 - 600 = 400) left through exit C.

Therefore, the total number of students who left through exit C is 400."
