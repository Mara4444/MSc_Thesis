Explanation:
According to the question, the number of sheep in Charles Town is twice that of Tuluz, and the number of sheep in Seattle is four times that of Tuluz. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
Tuluz = x
Charles Town = 2x
Seattle = 4x
We know that Seattle has 20 sheep, so we can substitute this value into one of the equations:
2x = 20

"Response: 6 years
Explanation:
The cost of planting one lemon tree is $90. The tree will produce 7 lemons per year, each worth $1.5. However, it costs $3 to water and fertilize the tree every year. To calculate the number of years required for the investment to pay off, we need to subtract the annual cost of maintenance from the total revenue generated by the tree.
Annual Revenue = Number of Lemons x Selling Price per Lemon
= 7 x $1.5
= $10.50
Annual Cost = Watering and Fertilization Cost + Initial Investment
= $3 + $90
= $93
Payoff Period = Total Revenue / Annual Cost
= $10.50 / $93
= 6 years
Therefore, it would take 6 years for the investment in the lemon tree to pay off."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Melanie sold 3/4 of her initial stock of air purifiers at Green House, and she sold 2 additional air purifiers at Red House. Therefore, the total number of air purifiers she had initially is:

Initial stock = Number of air purifiers sold at Green House + Number of air purizers sold at Red House
= (3/4) x Initial stock + 2

We know that Melanie has 5 air purifiers left after selling all the above mentioned air purifiers. So, we can set up an equation:

Number of air purifiers left = Initial stock - Total number of air purifiers sold
= 10 - (3/4) x Initial stock - 2

Solving for the value of ""Initial stock"", we get:

Initial stock = 10

Therefore, Melanie had initially 10 air purifiers."

The value of the jewelry is $5,000 and the value of the electronics is $8,000. If the jewelry market rises by 2.5%, then its new value is $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125. Similarly, if the electronics market rises by 1.2%, then its new value is $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,160. The total profit from both purchases is ($5,125 - $8,160) / $8,000 = -$3,035. To maximize profits, the merchant should choose to buy the electronics, which will result in a profit of $8,160 - $8,000 = $160. Therefore, the maximum profit is $160."

Explanation:
Given that Gil works as a teacher for $20/hour and as a coach for $30/hour, her weekly income is:
Teacher: $20 x 35 hours/week = $700/week
Coach: $30 x 15 hours/week = $450/week
Total weekly income: $700 + $450 = $1150/week
Since she works 50 weeks in a year, her annual income is:
Annual income (teacher): $700 x 50 weeks = $35,000
Annual income (coach): $450 x 50 weeks = $22,500
Total annual income: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"Response: 23 升
Explanation:
Let's first calculate the amount of orange juice in the remaining 24 升饮料：
From the problem statement, we know that the original mixture contained 10 升橙汁饮料 and 3/4 of it was water, so the total volume of orange juice is:
Volume of orange juice = Original volume x Percentage of orange juice / 100
= 10 升 x (3/4) / 100
= 7.5 升
Now, let's find out how much water is left in the remaining 24 升饮料：
We know that the original mixture contained 5/3 times as much water as orange juice, so the total volume of water is:
Total volume of water = Volume of orange juice x Multiplier
= 7.5 升 x 5/3
= 12.5 升
Since one cup of water is equal to 8 ounces, we can convert the volume of water from 升 to ounces as follows:
1 ounce = 1/8 升
So, the number of ounces of water in the remaining 24 升饮料 is:
Number of ounces of water = Total volume of water x Conversion factor
= 12.5 升 x 1/8
= 15.625 ounces
Therefore, there are approximately 15.625 ounces of water in the remaining 24 升饮料."

Explanation:
To calculate the total cost of all the clothes, we need to multiply the number of each item by its price and then add them up.

Number of shorts = 3
Price of one short = $16.50 x 3 = $49.50

Number of trousers = 3
Price of one pair of trousers = $22.50 x 3 = $67.50

Number of shoes = 3
Price of one shoe = $42 x 3 = $126

Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $79.50
Therefore, Michka spent $79.50 for all these clothes."

Explanation:
Charlie can produce 10 candles with each pound of wax he has. Since each candle sells for $2.00, Charlie's total revenue from selling these candles is:
$$ R = 10 \times 2.00 = 20.00 $$
However, to make these candles, Charlie needs to spend $10.00 on wax and supplies. Therefore, his cost of goods sold (COGS) is:
$$ COS = 10.00 $$
So, Charlie's gross profit from selling these candles is:
$$ Gross Profit = R - COS = 20.00 - 10.00 = 10.00 $$
Since Charlie produced 20 candles in total, his net profit (after subtracting the COGS) is:
$$ Net Profit = Gross Profit / Number of Candles Produced = 10.00 / 20 =  $\boxed{36.00}$ $$"

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Let's call the number of branches in each cluster ""C"". Since there are 6 clusters, the total number of branches is 6C.
Each branch has 20 leaves, so the total number of leaves is 6C x 20 = 1200.
Since there are 67 additional pinecones scattered throughout the tree, let's call their number ""A"". The total number of pinecones is therefore 1200 + A.
We know that the total number of pinecones must be less than or equal to the total number of branches, since each branch can have only one pinecone. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:
1200 + A ≤ 6C
Solving for C, we get:
C ≤ 1200 / (1200 + A) = 1/2
So, there are at most 6 branches per cluster.
Now, let's find the maximum value of A that satisfies the inequality:
A ≤ 1200 - 6(6C) = 1200 - 36C
Substituting the bound on C from above, we get:
A ≤ 1200 - 36(1/2) = 1200 - 180 = 1020
Therefore, there are exactly 134 pinecones scattered throughout the tree."

Explanation:
Let's assume that Martha started working for the company in year 1 and has been receiving annual retirement benefits worth $50,000 since then. In 20 years, she will start to receive an additional $5,000 (5% of $100,000) per year as her retirement benefit. Therefore, her total retirement benefit after 20 years will be:
$50,000 + ($5,000 x 20) = $1,000,000
After another 10 years, her retirement benefit will increase by $5,000 again, bringing it to:
$1,000,000 + ($5,000 x 10) = $1,050,000
Finally, if she retires at age 60 (in 30 years), her total retirement benefit will be:
$1,050,000 / 30 = $35,000 per year
Therefore, Martha's total retirement benefit after 30 years is $35,000 per year."

Explanation:
Let's assume that the height of each layer is h. Since the area of each layer is half the area of the next layer, we can write:
Area of top layer = Area of bottom layer / 2
Or, in terms of h:
h^3 = (16/2)^(1/3)
Simplifying and solving for h gives us:
h = sqrt(16/2) = sqrt(8)
So, the height of each layer is sqrt(8). Therefore, the average area of one layer is:
Average area per layer = Area of top layer / Number of layers
= 16 / 4
= 8
Therefore, the answer is 8."

Explanation:
According to the problem statement, Cici bought a puppy and must feed it according to the veterinarian's instructions. The dog food comes in bags containing 110 bowls of food. For the first 180 days (or one year), Cici must feed the dog one bowl per day, which means she will use up 180/1 = 180 bags of dog food. After that, she must feed the dog two bowls per day, which means she will use up an additional 360/2 = 180 bags of dog food over the remaining life of the dog. Therefore, Cici will use up a total of 180 + 180 = 360 bags of dog food during the dog's lifetime."
"Response: 
Let R = Ramona's laundry capacity (in pounds) and S = Sarah's laundry capacity (in pounds). Since David's laundry capacity is 4 times Sarah's, we can write:
S = 4R
Now, we are given that Sarah's laundry capacity is 400 pounds, so we can substitute this value into the equation above to get:
4R = 400
Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:
R = 100
Therefore, Ramona's laundry capacity is 100 pounds, and David's laundry capacity is 4 times that amount, or 400 pounds."

Explanation:
To calculate the total cost of gifts for each guest, we need to multiply the number of guests by 0.75 (since 1/4 of the guests did not attend). So, for 16 guests, the total cost would be:
36 x $2 = $72.00
Since some guests did not attend, the actual cost will be less than this amount. To find the exact cost, we can subtract the cost of gifts for non-attending guests from the total cost:
$72.00 - ($16 x $2) = $38.00
Therefore, Christina needs to spend approximately $38.00 on gift bags for her 16 friends."

"Response: 78
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The number of rabbits is less than the total number of cats and dogs by 12. So, the total number of cats and dogs = Number of rabbits + 12.
* The ratio of cats to dogs is 2:1, so the number of cats = 2x, where x is the number of dogs.
* The number of dogs is 60.

Now, let's substitute these values into the equation:
Total number of cats and dogs = Number of rabbits + 12
= (2x) + 12
= 2(30) + 12
= 60 + 12
= 72

Therefore, there are 72 pets in this community, including 24 cats and 48 dogs."

Let's break down the information given in the question:

* ""当弗雷达把罐装番茄煮成番茄酱时，份量减少了一半."" This means that for every 16 ounces of canned tomatoes used to make the sauce, there will be half as much left over afterward (i.e., 8 ounces).
* ""她使用的每个 16 盎司番茄罐头含有 3 颗番茄."" This means that each 16-ounce container of canned tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
* ""弗雷达的最后一批番茄酱是 32 盎司的酱."" This means that the final batch of tomato sauce made by Freda is 32 ounces.

Now, let's use these pieces of information to calculate how many tomatoes Freda used:

Total amount of tomatoes = Number of containers x Number of tomatoes per container
= 4 x 3
= 12

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make her final batch of tomato sauce."

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 38
Therefore, the doorbell rang 38 times."

"Response: 368.75 USD
Explanation:
Western's mother sells watermelons at a price that is three times the price of chili peppers. The price of oranges is $5 less than the price of watermelons. Dragon was sent to buy 4 watermelons, 20 chili peppers, and 10 oranges. If each chili pepper costs $15, how much will Dragon have to pay in total?

Step-by-step calculation:
Watermelon price = 3 x Chili pepper price = 3 x $15 = $45 per watermelon
Dragon buys 4 watermelons, so total cost for watermelons = $45 x 4 = $180
Chili pepper price = $15 per pepper
Dragon buys 20 chili peppers, so total cost for chili peppers = $15 x 20 = $300
Orange price = $15 - $5 = $10 per orange
Dragon buys 10 oranges, so total cost for oranges = $10 x 10 = $100
Total cost for all items = Total cost for watermelons + Total cost for chili peppers + Total cost for oranges = $180 + $300 + $100 = $680
Therefore, Dragon has to pay a total of $680."
"Response:  $3600$ per day
Explanation:
The hospital sees 500 patients per day and each patient's consultation time is average of 24 minutes. Therefore, total consultation time per day = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, total consultation hours per day = 12,000 / 60 = 200 hours.
Now, let's calculate the revenue from seeing patients. The doctor charges $150/hour and the hospital charges $200/hour to patients. So, total revenue from seeing patients per day = (500 patients/day) x ($150/hour) + ($200/hour) = $3600.
Therefore, the profit made by the hospital per day is $3600."

Explanation:
The total number of monkeys in the zoo is 30 (10 + 10 + 10). Each monkey needs 200 bananas per month, so the total number of bananas needed for all monkeys per month is 30 x 200 = 6000 bananas. Since the zoo manager buys all the bananas from a local farm every 2 months, he needs to buy 6000 / 2 = 3000 bananas each time he goes to the farm. Therefore, the zoo manager needs to go to the farm 5 times (or 5/2 = 2.5 times) to get enough bananas to last for 2 months. So, the answer is 560 (2 x 2.5 = 5."

"Response: 458.72 dollars
Explanation:
First, we need to calculate the price of one bag of marble after 36 months. According to the problem, the price will increase by 20% every two months. Therefore, after 18 months (half of the time), the price will be:
Price = Price initial x (1 + (20/100)^(n/2))
Where n is the number of months since the last price update. In this case, n = 18 months.
Substituting the values, we get:
Price = $ 20 x (1 + (20/100)^(18/2)) = $ 45.87
Therefore, after 36 months, the price of one bag of marble will be:
Price = $ 45.87 x (1 + (20/100)^(36/2)) = $ 458.72
So, one bag of marble costs approximately $ 458.72 after 36 months."

Explanation:
Jessica wants to pay off her debts faster than the minimum payment required each month. If she pays 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, she will be able to pay off all of her debts in one year.
For the student loan, the minimum payment is $300 per month, so Jessica needs to pay $450 ($300 + $150) per month to pay it off in one year.
For the credit card, the minimum payment is $200 per month, so Jessica needs to pay $300 ($200 + $100) per month to pay it off in one year.
For the mortgage, the minimum payment is $500 per month, so Jessica needs to pay $750 ($500 + $250) per month to pay it off in one year.
Therefore, Jessica will need to pay a total of $4800 ($450 x 3 = $1350 + $300 x 2 = $600 + $750) in one year to pay off all of her debts."

Explanation:
According to the question, Juan and Carlos produce 20 bottles of lemonade per batch, each selling for $0.50 per cup. Therefore, they earn total revenue of $10 per batch ($0.50 x 20 cups). Since they sell 2 batches per day, their daily revenue is $20 ($10 x 2 batches).
To calculate the cost of lemons, we need to know how many lemons are used in one batch of lemonade. According to the question, 3 lemons are needed to make one batch of lemonade, so the cost of lemons is $3 per batch ($0.03 x 3 lemons).
Since Juan and Carlos want to make a profit of $25, their total costs (including the cost of lemons) must be less than or equal to their total revenue. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
$20 + $3 = $25
Solving for $3, we get:
$3 = $0.40 per cup
Therefore, Juan and Carlos spend $0.40 per cup of lemonade produced. To find out how much they spent on lemons specifically, we divide the total cost by the number of lemons used:
$3 / 3 = $1.00 per lemon
So, Juan and Carlos spend $1.00 per lemon."

"Response: 12 seconds
Explanation:
The first team's time for each 400-meter segment is exactly 55 seconds, so their total time for one lap around the track would be 55 + 55 = 110 seconds.
Since the second team's times are not equally spaced, we can calculate their total time as follows:
Time of second team = Time of first team x (Number of runners / Number of segments)
= 110 seconds x (4/4)
= 110 seconds x 1
= 110 seconds
Therefore, the faster team finished with a time of 110 seconds, while the slower team took 110 seconds + (time of third runner - time of second runner) = 110 seconds + 30 seconds = 140 seconds to complete the race. So, the difference in time between the two teams is 140 seconds - 110 seconds = 30 seconds."

Since there are more than three odd numbers among the 12 possibilities, the probability of rolling an odd number is greater than 3/6 = 40%."
"Response: 35 apples
Explanation:
Let's assume that Shana and her mother together picked x apples from their apple garden. Since Shana picked half of what her mother picked, she picked x/2 apples.
The total number of apples picked by both Shana and her mother is therefore x + (x/2) = 3x/2 apples.
Given that Shana's mother picked 20 apples, we can set up the equation:
3x/2 = 20
Solving for x, we get:
x = 60
So Shana and her mother picked 60 apples in total."
"Response: 48
Explanation:
According to the problem statement, there are 3 boxes of mice, each containing 6 mice. Therefore, the total number of mice is 3 x 6 = 18.
Since there are 10 boxes of hamsters, and each box contains 5 hamsters, the total number of hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.
The problem states that any other area in the pet store does not use twigs. So, we can assume that all 20 twigs given to the rabbits are used by them.
Now, let's calculate the number of rabbits based on the twigs available. If 160 twigs are given to the little rodents, and each rabbit gets 20 twigs, then the total number of rabbits is 160 / 20 = 8.
Therefore, there are 18 mice, 50 hamsters, and 8 rabbits in the pet store."
"Response:  $98.45$
Explanation:
The amount of money that Man Ti needs to pay to Benedict is calculated as follows:

Total amount borrowed = $100
Interest rate per month = 0.02/12 = 0.00167 (as a decimal)
Number of months until repayment = 3
Total interest paid = Total amount borrowed x Interest rate per month
= $100 x 0.00167
= $1.67
Remaining balance after 3 months = Total amount borrowed - Total interest paid
= $100 - $1.67
= $98.45
Therefore, Man Ti needs to pay $98.45 to Benedict."

2. It costs $2 per bag to transport each bag of wheat from the farm to the warehouse.
3. The merchant sells all the wheat at $30 per bag and earns a total profit of $400.
From the third statement, we know that the total number of bags sold is equal to the total profit divided by the selling price per bag:
$400 / $30 = x
Now, let's substitute this value into the second statement:
x ( $20 ) + ( $2 x x ) = $400
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 16
Therefore, the merchant bought and sold 16 bags of wheat."

Explanation:
From the question, we know that Karl eats three sandwiches for lunch every day and each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese. Therefore, he consumes 6 slices of cheese (3 sandwiches x 2 slices/sandwich) per day.
On days when he eats scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast, he uses an additional slice of cheese per breakfast. So, he consumes 7 slices of cheese (6 slices + 1 extra slice/day) per day.
Since he makes a large batch of cheese spread and puts 8 slices in it, he must have used all the remaining 32 slices of cheese (40 - 6 = 32).
Therefore, Karl uses 40 pieces of cheese throughout the week."

"Response: 20 buckets of water.
Explanation:
Let's assume that the capacity of each bucket is 4 gallons (or 15.1 liters).

Initially, the small pool had twice as much water as the big pool, so the small pool had 2 x 4 = 8 gallons (or 35.9 liters) of water.

After 4 minutes, the big pool emptied half its water into the small pool, so the big pool now has half its original amount of water, which is 4 / 2 = 2 gallons (or 7.6 liters).

Now, the small pool has 8 - 2 = 6 gallons (or 22.8 liters) of water.

Therefore, there are 6 gallons (or 22.8 liters) of water in the small pool."

Explanation:
To calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage. The total cost is $352 ($320 for the shoes + $32 for the belt). Her hourly wage is $8 per hour. Therefore, we can calculate the number of hours she needs to work as follows:
$352 / $8 = 45 hours
Since you cannot have a fraction of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 41 hours. So, Lori needs to work for 41 hours to afford the shoes and belt."
"Response: 3,478.95 USD
Explanation:
Let's break down the calculation step by step:
1. Jenny borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay back 10% of that amount as interest. So, the total amount she owes is $2,000 x 1.1 = $2,200.
2. She plans to make monthly payments of $165 for 12 months. To calculate the remaining balance after each payment, we can use the formula: Remaining Balance = Total Amount - (Payment Amount x Number of Payments).
So, after the first payment of $165, the remaining balance would be: Remaining Balance = $2,200 - ($165 x 1) = $2,200 - $165 = $1,935.
After the second payment of $165, the remaining balance would be: Remaining Balance = $1,935 - ($165 x 2) = $1,935 - $330 = $1,605.
And so on...
The final remaining balance after all 12 payments are made is: Remaining Balance = $1,605 - ($165 x 12) = $1,605 - $2,010 = -$405.
Therefore, the correct answer is $3,478.95 (-$405)."

Explanation:
According to the problem statement, there are 50 bees in the garden and each bee can gather pollen from 1/2 of the total number of insects in the garden. Therefore, if there are 1250 insects in the garden, then the number of insects that each bee can gather is:

1250 / 50 = 25
So, the total number of insects in the garden is:
25 x 1250 = 31250
Therefore, the answer is 31250."

Explanation:
Let's first calculate the total number of students who left through all three exits.
From A exit, 30% of 1000 = 300 students left.
From B exit, 3/5 of 800 = 480 students left (since there are 3 times as many students remaining).
From C exit, 700 - 480 = 220 students left (since there are fewer students remaining).
Therefore, the total number of students who left through all three exits is: 300 + 480 + 220 = 900.
Now, let's find out how many students left through the C exit specifically. Since there were 900 students in total who left through all three exits, and 220 students left through the C exit, we can conclude that 220 / 900 = 276 students left through the C exit alone."

Explanation:
Multiple choice questions are designed to test your ability to understand and apply mathematical concepts in different contexts. In this case, we need to use basic arithmetic operations to find the total number of books read by both Multiple and Parandola after they have finished reading each other's books and their own books.
Let's break down the information given in the question:
* Multi has two books.
* Parandola has one book.
* Both Multi and Parandola will read each other's books and their own books.
From these statements, we can conclude that:
1. Multi will read two books (her own and Parandola's).
2. Parandola will read one book (Multi's).
So, the total number of books read by both Multi and Parandola is:
2 + 1 = 3 books."

Explanation:
Let's assume that Mikaeel has been writing letters to 5 friends for a week. Each friend sends him 2 letters per week, so in total, he receives 10 letters (2 x 5 = 10).
Since each letter is 5 pages long, and Mikaeel takes 6 minutes to write one page, it will take him 60 minutes to write all 10 letters (10 x 6 = 60).
Therefore, Mikaeel spends 60 minutes per week writing letters."

Explanation:
Jason has an allowance of 1,000 hours per month for his phone plan. He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, which is 15 x 30 = 450 minutes in this month. Additionally, he spent extra 300 minutes talking to other people, bringing the total time used to 450 + 300 = 750 minutes. Since there are 30 days in this month, Jason still has 1,000 - 750 = 270 minutes left unused."
"Response: 10
Explanation: 
From the information provided in the question, we know that Kael took 5 roots of potatoes from Grifen's pile, and Colby took twice as many roots as Kael. Therefore, Colby took 10 roots of potatoes from Grifen's pile (since he took twice as many as Kael).
After this, Grefin gave one root to Kolin, leaving him with 26 roots of potatoes. Finally, Corbin took 3 fewer roots than Kael, so he took 9 roots of potatoes from Grifen's pile (since he took 3 fewer than Kael took).
Therefore, the final number of roots of potatoes that Grifen had was 27 - 9 = 18."
"Response: 160
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Given:
* In one aquarium, there are 4 sloths.
* In another aquarium, there are 32 sloths.
* The number of sloths in the second aquarium is twice the number of fish in the first aquarium.
* If the number of fish in both aquariums is equal, then each aquarium has half as many fish as sloths.

Now, let's apply these conditions to find the number of fish in each aquarium:

1. Number of sloths in the first aquarium = 4
Number of fish in the first aquarium = 4 x 2 = 8
2. Number of sloths in the second aquarium = 32
Number of fish in the second aquarium = 32 x 2 = 64

So, there are 8 fish in the first aquarium and 64 fish in the second aquarium. Therefore, the answer is 160 (8 + 64)."

Explanation:
First, calculate the total cost of makeup for one week:
4 times per day = 4 x 24 = 96 hours
$250/hour = $250 x 96 = $24,000
Next, calculate the discount given to Jenny after the movie was completed:
10% of $24,000 = $2,400
So, the final amount paid by Jenny is:
$24,000 - $2,400 = $21,600
Therefore, the answer is $3750 (or $21,600 / 5 weeks)."

"Response: 600 卡路里
Explanation:
Day 1:
Sue eats 4 times as much candy as her sister, so she eats 4 x 5 = 20 pieces of candy. Each piece contains 200 calories, so Sue consumes 20 x 200 = 4000 calories.

Day 2:
Sue eats twice as much candy as her sister, so she eats 2 x 13 = 26 pieces of candy. Each piece contains 200 calories, so Sue consumes 26 x 200 = 5200 calories.

Total calories consumed by Sue is 9200 calories (4000 + 5200).

Since Sue's sister consumed 5 blocks of candy on Day 1 and 13 blocks on Day 2, her total consumption is 5 x 200 = 1000 calories + 13 x 200 = 2600 calories = 3600 calories.

Therefore, the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories."
