"Response: 
Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She sells three of them to her friends every morning for $4 each. So she earns $3 x 3 = $9 from selling eggs to her friends daily.  Now let's calculate how much she earns from selling the remaining eggs at the farmer's market. Since there are 20 eggs left after giving 3 to her friends, and she sells each egg for $2, she will sell 20 eggs x $2 = $40 at the farmer's market. Therefore, in total, Janet earns $9 + $40 = $59 dollars per day at the farmer's market."
Response:  We know that the mantle needs two blue threads and half of the white threads. So we need to calculate how many white threads are needed. If there are x white threads in total, then the number of white threads needed is x/2. Therefore, the answer is 4 bouten (bout = 1/4).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then he invested $50,000 to repair it. This means that after the repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%, which is equal to $75,000 (150% of $50,000). So, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000. Now, let's calculate the profit made by Josh. Profit = Selling price - Purchase price = $155,000 - $80,000 = $75,000. Therefore, Josh has made a profit of $75,000 from selling the renovated house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that James runs three times a week and each time he does three sprints of 60 meters each. Therefore, he runs a total distance of 3 x 3 x 60 = 180 meters per week.
Response:  We know that Wendy gives her chickens three different portions of food every day: morning, afternoon, and evening. Each portion is made up of mixed chicken feed, seeds, mealworms, and vegetables to keep them healthy. She also knows how many chickens she has in total (20). So let's calculate how much food each chicken needs for each meal based on their total number: Morning Meal: 15 cups of food per chicken x 20 chickens = 300 cups of food Afternoon Meal: 25 cups of food per chicken x 20 chickens = 500 cups of food Evening Meal: 3 cups of food per chicken x 20 chickens = 60 cups of food Total amount of food needed per day = 300 + 500 + 60 = 860 cups of food Therefore, Wendy should give her chickens 860 cups of food per day.
Response:  If one glass of brandy costs $5, then the second glass will cost $\frac{60}{100}$ of that price = $\$3$. So if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will have to pay for 16 x $\$3 = \$48$.
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 10 = 20 sheep.  We also know that Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 5 = 20 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 20 + 20 + 5 = 55 sheep.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so it will take 10 minutes to download 20 GB (20/2 = 10). However, due to the forced restart of Windows, she needs to start the download again from the beginning, which means an additional time of 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time needed to download the 200 GB file is:  Time = 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John rode for three hours at an speed of 100 km/h, which means he covered a distance of 3 x 3 = 90 km.  Then, he turned back and rode for another two hours at a speed of 30 mph, covering a distance of 2 x 2 = 40 km. Finally, he had 2 hours to cover the remaining distance of 160 km (since he started from his house) at a speed of 80 km/h. Therefore, after four hours, he would have traveled a total distance of 90 + 40 + 160 = 350 km away from his house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Eliza works for 40 hours per week and her hourly wage is $10. So, she earns $400 per week ($10/hour x 40 hours). Now, let's calculate her overtime pay of 1.2 times her normal hourly wage. Her overtime pay would be $10 x 1.2 = $120 per week. Therefore, Eliza's total weekly income is $400 + $120 = $520 per week. If she has worked 45 hours in one week, then her daily income would be $520 / 45 hours = $11.78 per hour.
Response:  In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. If we multiply this number by three, we get 180 downloads in the second month (since the increase is three times). However, since the number of downloads decreased by 30%, we need to subtract 30% of 180, which gives us 126 downloads in the third month. Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three months is 60 + 180 - 30 = 270 downloads.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toula bought different types of baked goods from the bakeries as follows: - Donuts (3 dozen): $68 x 3 = $204 - Mini Cupcakes (2 dozen): $80 x 2 = $160 - Mini Cheesecakes (6 dozen): $55 x 6 = $330 Total Cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694
Response:  First year:  The tree is just planted and doesn't produce any fruit yet, so no income.  Second year:  Seven citronen grow, but they are not sold because the tree is still young. Third year:  Seven citrons grow again, and this time they can be sold for $1,50 each. So, the total revenue in the third year will be $1,50 x 7 = $105. Fourth year:  Seven new citrons grow, and now the tree has been growing for four years, so it needs more watering and feeding, which costs $3 x 4 = $12. Total revenue in the fourth year will be $105 + $12 = $117. Fifth year:  Seven new citrons grow, and now the tree has been growing for five years, so it needs even more watering and feeding, which costs $3 x 5 = $15. Total revenue in the fifth year will be $117 + $15 = $132. Sixth year:  Seven new citrons grow, and now the tree has been growing for six years, so it needs even more watering and feeding, which costs $3 x 6 = $18. Total revenue in the sixth year will be $132 + $18 = $150. Seventh year:  Seven new citrons grow, and now the tree has been growing for seven years, so it needs even more watering and feeding, which costs $3 x 7 = $21. Total revenue in the seventh year will be $150 + $21 = $171. From that point onwards, the tree will continue to produce citrons every year, and the owner will start making profit from them. Therefore, the first year when he starts making money with the citron tree is the eighth year after planting it.
Response:  We know that Melanie sold one third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house and two more at the red house. So, she has (1/3) + (2) = 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students, 4 are registered for contemporary dance (20%). Out of the remaining 16 students, 7 are registered for jazz dance (25%). So, the total number of students registered for jazz and hip hop is 7 + 4 = 11. Therefore, the percentage of students who have hip hop dance is 11/20 x 100 = 55%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the expected value of both options based on their respective market growth rates. For the jewelry option, the expected value is: $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,375. For the electronics option, the expected value is: $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,464. Now, let's compare these values and choose the one with higher potential for profit at the end of the month. The higher potential for profit means that the option with the higher expected value should be chosen. Therefore, the correct answer is: $8,464.
Response:  On day one, both trains travel for 80 miles, so they have traveled a total distance of 160 miles (80 + 80).  On the second day, each train travels for 240 kilometers, which is equal to 150 miles (since there are 1.6 km in a mile). Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains on the second day is 310 miles (160 + 150). So, the total distance traveled by both trains in two days is 470 miles (160 + 310).
Response:  First, let's calculate how much Jill earns as a teacher and as a cheerleading coach separately. As a teacher, she earns $20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week ($700 x 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year) As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week ($450 x 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year) Now, let's add up her total annual salary: $35,000 (teacher) + $22,500 (coach) = $57,500/year
Response:  In one week, Claire makes an omelette with 3 eggs per day, so she will eat 21 eggs (3 x 7) in one week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, she will eat 84 eggs (21 x 4).
Response:  First, we know that Marissa took one hour to cover the first four miles of her walk. So, her speed for those four miles was four miles divided by one hour = 4 mi/h.  Next, she covered the next two miles in another hour. Therefore, her speed for these two miles was two miles divided by one hour = 2 mi/h.  Now, we want to find out what speed Marissa needs to maintain to finish the remaining distance of eight miles in the same time it took her to cover the first six miles. To do this, we can use the formula: total distance / time taken = average speed. In this case, the total distance is eight miles, and the time taken is the time it took her to cover the first six miles plus the time it took her to cover the last two miles. So, we have: 8 miles / (1 hour + 1 hour) = 8 miles / 2 hours = 4 mi/h.  Therefore, Marissa needs to maintain a speed of 4 miles per hour to finish the remaining distance of eight miles in the same time it took her to cover the first six miles.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that contains two-thirds water and we want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that contains three-fifths water. However, while pouring, one liter of orange juice spills. So, how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?
To solve this problem, we need to use proportions. Let's assume that the total volume of both juices before adding them together was 30 liters (since there are 10 + 15 = 25 liters). Now, after adding them together, we have 24 liters left. To find out how much water is left in these 24 liters, we can use the following proportion:
Water content of original orange juice = Total volume of orange juice / Volume of water in orange juice x 100%
= 10 L / (2/3) x 100%
= 66.67%

Similarly, we can calculate the percentage of water in the original pineapple juice using the same proportion:
Water content of original pineapple juice = Total volume of pineapple juice / Volume of water in pineapple juice x 100%
= 15 L / (3/5) x 100%
= 50%
Now, let's subtract the percentage of water in the spilled orange juice from the total volume of the remaining juice:
Volume of water left in the juice = Total volume of juice - Water content of original orange juice x Volume of spilled orange juice
= 24 L - 66.67% x 1 L
= 24 L - 0.6667 L
= 23.33 L
Therefore, there are approximately 23.33 liters of water left in the remaining 24 liters of juice."
Response:  Raymond was born six years before Samantha, so he is now 31 years old. His son was born when he was 23 years old, which means his son is eight years younger than him. Therefore, Samantha's age minus Raymond's age equals the number of years since Raymond's son was born. So, the answer is: 31 - 23 = 8 years ago.
Response:  On Tuesday, Billy sold 3 DVDs to his first three customers. Then he sold 2 more DVDs to his next two customers, so he has sold a total of 5 DVDs (3 + 2 = 5). Finally, none of his last three customers bought any DVDs, so he has sold a total of 5 DVDs in all. Therefore, Billy sold 5 DVDs on Tuesday.
Response:  The kaars will be shorter after burning for 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00). To find out how much shorter it is, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time. In this case, the rate at which the kaars melts is 2 cm/hour and the time it burned is 4 hours. So, the distance traveled by the kaars during that time is: distance = rate x time = 2 cm/h x 4 h = 8 cm. Therefore, the kaars will be 8 cm shorter after burning for 4 hours.
Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 and there is a discount of 25%. So we can write an equation as follows: Book price = Original price - (Original price x Discount percentage) Book price = $19.50 - ($19.50 x 25%) Book price = $19.50 - $4.875 Book price = $14.625 Now, we need to find out what was the original price of the book. To do this, we divide the book price by the discount percentage: Original price = Book price / Discount percentage Original price = $14.625 / 25% Original price = $58 Original price was $58. Therefore, the original price of the book before the discount was $58.
Response:  We know that Marie paid a total of $50 for her meal. This includes the cost of the chicken dish ($12), milk (5 x $3 = $15), apples (4 x $1.50 = $6), and pizza (x). To find out how many pounds of pizza Marie bought, we can set up an equation using this information: Total Cost = Chicken Dish + Milk + Apples + Pizza Where T = Total Cost M = Cost of Chicken Dish C = Cost of Milk A = Cost of Apples P = Cost of Pizza Now we are given that the total cost was $50, so we can substitute this value into our equation: T = $12 + $15 + $6 + x = $50 Solving for x, we get: x = $50 / ($12 + $15 + $6) = $50 / $37 = 1.35 pounds of pizza Therefore, Marie bought 1.35 pounds of pizza.
Response:  Firstly, she bought three pairs of short pants which cost her $ x = 16.50 + 16.50 + 16.50 = 59.50 dollars. Secondly, she purchased three pairs of trousers that cost her $ y = 22.50 + 22.50 + 22.50 = 78.50 dollars. Lastly, she acquired three pairs of shoes at a price of $ z = 42 + 42 + 42 = 126 dollars. Therefore, in total, Mishka spent $ x + y + z = 59.50 + 78.50 + 126 = 263.00 dollars on those clothing items.
"Response: 
Cynthia buys 15 portions of ice cream per karton and each portion costs $4. Therefore, she spends $60 for 15 portions = $4 x 15 = $60.  So after 60 days, she will have spent a total of $60 on ice cream."
Response:  We know that Henry stopped for the first time after 20 miles (or 32 kilometers) and then he continued cycling until he stopped again 15 miles before the end of the trip. So, we can calculate the distance between his two stops as follows: Distance = End point - First stop = 100 km - 32 km = 68 km Now, let's convert this distance from kilometers to miles: Distance in miles = 68 km x 0.621371 = 42.9 miles Therefore, Henry rode 42.9 miles between his first and second stops.
Response:  We know that Gloria has to choose between two pairs of shoes: the lace-ups and the high heels. The price of the lace-ups is $50, while the price of the high heels is $87. So, if she chooses the lace-ups, they will cost her $50. If she chooses the high heels, they will cost her $87. Now, we are given that the total cost of both pairs of shoes is equal to $140. This means that the sum of the prices of the two pairs of shoes is $140. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  $50 + $87 = $140  Solving for $50, we get:  $50 = $140 - $87  $50 = $53  So, the price of the lace-ups is $53.
Response:  We know that Darrel is 7 years older than Allen. So, if Allen is x years old, then Darrel is x + 7 years old. Now we are given that their total age is 162 years. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x + 7) = 162. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 7 = 162. Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation gives us: 2x = 155. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us: x = 77.5. Since we cannot have half a year, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 78 years. Therefore, Allen's age over 10 years is 78 years.
Response:  The first friend said there are 80 jelly beans in the pot. If we assume that this number is correct, then the second friend must have given an overestimate of at least 20 jelly beans more than half of 80, which is equal to 40. Therefore, the second friend estimated 120 jelly beans in the pot (80 + 40). Now, the third friend gave an estimate of 25% more than the first friend, which means they estimated 100 jelly beans (120 x 1.25 = 150). So, the average guess of the three friends is 130 jelly beans (80 + 120 + 100)
Response:  If John takes care of 10 dogs and each dog needs 1.5 hours of attention per day, then he spends 1.5 x 10 = 15 hours per day taking care of his dogs. Therefore, he spends 15 hours/day + 8 hours (for sleep) = 23 hours per week taking care of his dogs.
Response:  We know that there are more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we have x silver coins, we must have x + 30 gold coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins is 110 - 30 = 80. So, Gretchen has 80 golden munts.
Response:  We know that Aaron has five more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So if Raymond has x jewels, then Aaron has 5x/2 jewels. Since Siobhan has two fewer jewels than Aaron, she has (5x/2) - 2 = 3x/2 jewels. Therefore, Siobhan has 3(40) / 2 = 60 jewels.
Response:  First 20 minutes = 4 points x 20 minutes = 80 points Second 20 minutes = (40 - 20) \* 20 minutes = 160 points Total points scored = 80 + 160 = 240 points So, Mike has scored 240 points in total.
Response:  Terry buys two yogurts per day and there are currently 4 yogurts for sale for $5.00. To find out how much he spends on yogurt in total over 30 days, we can use multiplication. So, Terry will spend: $$ = \text { Number of yogurts } \times \text{ Price of one yogurt} $$ = (2 yogurts/day) $\times$ ($4 yogurts/sale)$ = 80 yogurts $\times$ $1.25$ = $96.00$$ Therefore, Terry will spend $96.00 on yogurt over 30 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John sold all his Lego sets and got $15 for each one. So he made a total of $15 x 13 = $195 from selling his Lego sets. Then, he used this money to buy video games at $20 each. Since he bought 8 video games, he spent $20 x 8 = $160 on them. This means he has $195 - $160 = $35 left over after buying the video games. Therefore, John still has 13 Lego sets.
Response:  First day: 3 hours/day x 1 day = 3 km/hour Second day: (half of 2 days) x 3 hours/day = 1.5 km/hour Third day: 3 hours/day x 1 day = 3 km/hour Total distance covered in one week: 3 + 1.5 + 3 = 7.5 kilometers per week Therefore, John can run at an average speed of approximately 7.5 kilometers per hour.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dana can run four times faster than she can walk. So if she walks at a speed of x kilometers per hour, her running speed will be 4x km/h.  Next, we are given that Dana can jump with a speed of half the speed she can run. Therefore, her jumping speed is 4x / 2 = 2x km/h.  Now, let's find out how far Dana can cover in six hours if she spends one-third of the time walking and two-thirds of the time running. If she walks at a speed of x km/h, she will cover a distance of x \* 6/3 = 4x km in six hours. Similarly, if she runs for two-thirds of the time, she will cover a distance of (2/3) \* 2x km = 3x km in those three hours. Therefore, the total distance covered by Dana in six hours is 4x + 3x = 7x km.
Response:  We know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone. So if Suzy's iPhone is one year old, then Ben's iPhone is two years old. And we also know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is eight years old (4 x 2 = 8).
Response:  First, we know that the range of the dragon's flames is 1000 feet.  Second, we know that Polly can throw the golden spear 600 feet with the sapphire stone (since she can throw it 3 times farther than when she doesn't hold the stone). Third, we know that Polly can throw the golden spear 800 feet with the emerald stone (since she can throw it 50% farther than when she doesn't hold the stone). Finally, we know that the distance between Polly and the dragon is greater than 1000 feet. Therefore, if Polly holds either the sapphire or emerald stone while throwing the golden spear at the dragon, she will be able to hit the dragon.
Response:  If Oma Jones baked five apple tarts and cut each tart into eight pieces, then she has a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple tart.  Since there were still 14 pieces left at the end of the evening, this means that 40 - 14 = 26 pieces were consumed by the guests. Therefore, 26 pieces of apple tart were taken away by the guests.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one portion of chips contains 250 calories. Therefore, if there are 5 portions in a bag of 300g, each portion will contain 250/5 = 50 calories. Now, let's calculate how many grams you can eat based on your daily calorie goal and the number of calories in each portion. If your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you have 200 calories remaining for the day. Dividing this amount by the number of calories in each portion (50) gives us the total number of grams you can eat from the bag of chips: 200 / 50 = 4 oz or 113 grams. So, you can safely eat up to 113 grams of chips from the bag as long as you stay within your daily calorie goal.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie can make ten candles from one pound of beeswax. So if he sells each candle for $2, then he will make $2 x 10 = $20 from one pound of beeswax.  Now let's consider the cost of materials. We are told that the doeks (which I assume means ""dozens"") of beeswax cost $10. This means that Charlie spends $10 to produce ten candles, or $1 per candle. Therefore, his profit from selling each candle is $2 - $1 = $1.  If he makes 20 candles and sells them all, then he will make a total profit of $2 x 20 = $40."
Response:  On Monday, she wrote 5 articles and spent 4 hours each article = 20 hours on Monday.  On Tuesday, she wrote 3/5 of the number of articles she wrote on Monday = 3 x 4 hours = 12 hours on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday = 2 x 12 hours = 24 hours on Wednesday. Therefore, the total time Meredith spent writing articles in those three days was 20 + 12 + 24 = 66 hours.
"Response:  We know that Candice stopped 80 Post-it notes in her bag before going to work at the coffee shop. Then she bought a pack of Post-it notes and placed one on each of the 220 different coffee cups at work. So, if she had 23 extra Post-it notes left over after placing them all on the cups, then the number of Post-it notes in the pack she bought is:

Number of Post-it notes in the pack = Total number of Post-it notes - Number of Post-it notes used up = 220 - 23 = 197
Therefore, there were 197 Post-it notes in the pack that Candice bought."
Response:  We know that John bought two times more red than blue scarves. So if he bought x blue scarves, he bought 2x red scarves.  Since the red scarves cost 50% more than the blue ones, the total cost of the red scarves is 50% more than the total cost of the blue scarves. Therefore, the total cost of all the scarves = $200 + (50% \* $40) = $200 + $20 = $220.
"Response:  We know that Tracy used one meter of string to support her tomato plants. Since each piece of string is 15 cm long, we can calculate how many pieces she got as follows:

Number of pieces = Length of string / Length of each piece
= 1 m / 0.15 m
= 7
Therefore, Tracy received 7 pieces of string."
"Response:  We know that Richard lives in an apartment complex of 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. So, there are 8 x 15 = 120 apartments in total. Now, we need to find out how many of them are occupied. It says ""3/4 of the building is occupied"", which means that 3/4 of 120 = 90 apartments are occupied. That means that 30 apartments (or 25% of the total) are left unoccupied or ""leegstaand""."
Response:  We know that Lloyd has an egg farm and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. If he sells each egg for $2, then he will make $2 x 252 = $504 per day from selling eggs alone. So, Lloyd earns $504 per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tom can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 1-4 hours. Therefore, he will cover a distance of 10 x 1-4 = 40 miles during this time. Now, since he returns with a speed of 6 miles per hour, it will take him 40/6 = 6.67 hours to return. So, Tom will be back after 6.67 hours.
Response:  If Uriah's book bag is too heavy for him and he needs to remove 5 kg from it, then the total weight of his book bag must be greater than or equal to 5 kg.  Since each comic book weighs 250 grams (which is equivalent to 1/4 kilogram), then the number of comics in his bag can be calculated as follows: Number of comics = Total weight of book bag / Weight of one comic book  Therefore, if Uriah has 30 comics in his bag, their combined weight would be: Combined weight of comics = Number of comics x Weight of one comic book  Combined weight of comics = 30 x 250 grams  Combined weight of comics = 7500 grams  Now, since Uriah needs to remove 5 kg from his bag, he will have to remove at least 5 kg - 7500 grams = 6850 grams of material from his bag.  As you mentioned that each stripbook weights 250 gramms, so he need to remove 6850 grams / 250 grams per stripbook = 27,6 stripbooks from his bag.
Response:  On Thursday (donderdag), the monteur repaired six truck bands and four car bands, so he earned $60 x 6 = $360 for truck bands and $40 x 4 = $160 for car bands, totaling $520.  On Friday (vrijdag), the monteur repaired twelve cars but did not repair any truck bands, so he earned $40 x 12 = $480 for car bands only. Therefore, the difference between the highest income on Thursday and the lowest income on Friday is $520 - $480 = $40. So, the monteur earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.
Response:  The family Doubtfire has adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother tells them that their first cat, Patchy, has had three times as many adoption kittens as they have, which means Patchy has 3 x 7 = 21 adoption kittens. Similarly, their second cat, Trixie, has had 12 adoption kittens. Therefore, the total number of adoption kittens for the family Doubtfire is 21 + 12 = 33 adoption kittens.
Response:  Firstly, Jean has 30 lollies and he eats two of them. So now he has 28 lollies left. To pack two lollies in one bag, Jean can fill 14 bags (28 / 2 = 14). Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with his remaining lollies.
Response:  If Peter has $42 to spend and he wants to go to the movies 4 times, then he will have $10 left over after buying his tickets and snacks for each movie trip ($7 x 4 = $28). So, he can afford to go to the movies 4 times with the money he has. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the maximum weight of the bridge is 5000 pounds or 2268 kg. Then, we have to calculate how much does each box weigh. Since there are 10 boxes in total and each box weights 5kg, then their total weight would be 50 kg. Now, let's find out how many boxes can fit on the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. We do this by dividing the maximum weight of the bridge (in kg) by the weight of one box (in kg): 5000 / 5 = 1000 boxes. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 1000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Stephen paid $40 for his groceries. Then, because it was an online order and not from a physical store, there is a delivery fee of $3 added to the total cost. Next, since it was through a third-party deliverer, they charged an additional 25% of the total amount (which is $10) as commission. Finally, Stephen gave a tip of $4, bringing the total cost to $64. So, the final price of Stephen's groceries was $64.
"Response:  We know that each cluster has 20 fruits and there are 6 clusters. So, we have:
Total number of fruits per cluster = Number of clusters x Total number of fruits per cluster = 6 x 20 = 120 fruits.
Now, we need to find out how many individual fruits are there in total. To do this, we will divide the total number of fruits per cluster by the number of individuals per fruit (which is given as 67). This gives us:
Total number of individual fruits = Total number of fruits per cluster / Number of individuals per fruit = 120 / 67 = 1.85 fruits.
So, there are approximately 1.85 fruits in total."
Response:  We know that there are 25 apples in total and we want to find out how many of them are good. The information given in the question is as follows: • 1 apple is bad (25%) • 20% of the apples are unripe (5 apples) • 2 apples are too acidic (2/25 = 0.08) So, if we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and acidic apples from the total number of apples, we will get the number of good apples. Therefore, the number of good apples is: 25 - 1 - 5 - 0.08 = 19 Good apples!
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for the material to make the brooch. Then, she paid an additional $800 to the jeweler to build it. Finally, she paid $10% of that amount as insurance, which is $80. So in total, she has paid $660 ($500 + $800 - $80).
Response:  First year (year 1):  $50,000 x 1 = $50,000 Second year (year 2):  $50,000 x 1.05 = $52,500 Third year (year 3):  $52,500 x 1.05 = $55,625 Fourth year (year 4):  $55,625 x 1.05 = $58,795 Fifth year (year 5):  $58,795 x 1.05 = $62,349 Sixth year (year 6):  $62,349 x 1.05 = $65,599 Seventh year (year 7):  $65,599 x 1.05 = $69,249 Eighth year (year 8):  $69,249 x 1.05 = $73,099 Ninth year (year 9):  $73,099 x 1.05 = $76,849 Tenth year (year 10): $76,849 x 1.05 = $80,699 Eleventh year (year 11): $80,699 x 1.05 = $84,549 Twelfth year (year 12): $84,549 x 1.05 = $88,499 Thirteenth year (year 13): $88,499 x 1.05 = $92,549 Fourteenth year (year 14): $92,549 x 1.05 = $96,799 Fifteenth year (year 15): $96,799 x 1.05 = $101,649 Sixteenth year (year 16): $101,649 x 1.05 = $106,999 Seventeenth year (year 17): $106,999
Response:  In the first half of the year (January to June), Aleena paid $140 for her subscription. Then, in the second half of the year (July to December), she was charged 10% less than the initial amount, which is $126 ($140 x 0.9 = $126). Therefore, the total amount that Aleena paid for her subscription at the end of the year is $140 + $126 = $266.
Response:  We know that Sophia has driven 160 km since she last filled up her tank and she used one liter of fuel to refill it. So, if we divide the distance traveled (160 km) by the amount of fuel used (1 liter), we get an average fuel efficiency of 160/1 = 160 km/liter.  Now, according to the usage manual of her car, a full tank contains 12 gallons of fuel, which is equal to 3785 milliliters (since there are 4 liters per US gallon). If we multiply the average fuel efficiency (160 km/liter) by the capacity of her tank (3785 ml), we get the maximum distance Sophia can drive on one tank of gas: 160 km/liter x 3785 ml = 5960 km. Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 5960 kilometers on one tank of gas.
"Response: 
Jim watches TV for two hours and then goes to bed to read for half as long. So he reads for one hour. He does this three times a week, which means he spends a total of 3 x 2 = 6 hours watching TV and reading each week. In four weeks, that would be 4 x 6 = 24 hours."
Response:  We know that there are four schools participating in the tournament and each school has two teams (one for girls and one for boys). So, we have a total of 8 teams (4 schools x 2 teams per school). And since each team has 5 players, we have a total of 40 players (8 teams x 5 players per team). Finally, we know that each school also has a coach, so we have an additional 4 coaches (4 schools x 1 coach per school). Therefore, the total number of people who have been sent by all the schools is 40 + 4 = 44.
"Response:  We know that there are more diamonds than rubies and more smaragdens than both diamonds and rubies together. So we can start with these two equations:

Number of diamonds = Total number of stones - Number of rubies
= 175 - 35
= 140

Number of smaragdens = Total number of stones - (Number of diamonds + Number of rubies)
= 175 - (140 + 35)
= 260

So, there were 140 diamonds, 260 smaragdens, and 35 rubies in the chest."
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. So if there are x girls, there are 2x boys. Since each class has 60 students (including both boys and girls), we can set up the equation:

Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
= x + 2x
= 3x

So, there are 3 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
Response:  Bailey starts with $X dollars and gets a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, she has $X + (8 x $5) = X + $40. Since she ends up with $100 at the end of the period, we can set up the equation: $X + $40 = $100. Solving for $X, we get: $X = $60. So, when Bailey started, she had $60.
"Response: 
Judy gives 5 dance classes every day (Monday to Friday) and 8 dance classes on Saturday. So, she teaches a total of 5 + 8 = 13 dance classes per week.
Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students Judy teaches per week is 13 x 15 = 195 students.
Now, if each student pays $15 per class, then Judy earns $15 x 195 = $2,725 per week from teaching dance classes alone."
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Therefore, if we multiply 20 by 2, we get 40 instructions in total for both recipes combined. So, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions to prepare both dishes.
Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each piece of cheesecake for $4, then he will make $3 x 43 = $132 from the brownies and $4 x 23 = $92 from the cheesecakes, in total $224.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Sheila will pay for each mobile phone unit. Since she is buying five units at $150 per unit, her total cost would be $750 (5 x $150). Then, we need to find out how much interest she will have to pay based on the given percentage of 2%. To do this, we can multiply the total cost by the interest rate (in decimal form) and divide it by 100. So, the amount of interest Sheila has to pay = $750 x 2% / 100 = $15. Therefore, the total amount Sheila needs to pay for all five mobile phones over three months is $765 ($750 + $15).
"Response:  If we assume that all of Artie's prices are rounded to the nearest dollar (as he has no change), then...

* Goudsbloemen: $2.74 x 12 = $32.88
* Petunias: $1.87 x 9 = $16.53
* Begonias: $2.12 x 17 = $35.04

So, in total, Artie will earn $32.88 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $84.45."
Response:  Since each level has half the area of the previous level, we can write an equation based on this pattern: Level n = (1/2)^(n-1) x 16 = Area of top level So, to find the average area of a level, we need to calculate the total area of all levels and divide it by the number of levels: Total area = Sum of areas of all levels Number of levels = 4 (since there are 4 levels in the castle) Now, let's calculate the sum of areas of all levels: Areas of levels = 16 + (1/2)^(3-1) x 16 + (1/2)^(5-1) x 16 + (1/2)^(7-1) x 16 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 20 Therefore, the average area of a level is: Average area = Total area / Number of levels = 20 / 4 = 5 square meters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy for 180 days (the first 6 months of its life). So, she will need to give it one cup of food per day during this period. Therefore, the total number of cups of food she will use during this time is: 180 days x 1 cup/day = 180 cups.  Next, we are told that after the initial 180-day period, Cecilia should continue to feed her puppy two cups of food every day for the remainder of its life. So, how many cups of food will she need to buy over the entire lifetime of her puppy? Well, since the puppy lives for another 3 years (based on the information given), and it takes 2 cups of food per day, then the total number of cups of food she will need to buy over its entire lifespan is: 3 years x 2 cups/day = 600 cups.  Now, let's convert the amount of hound
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sarah does 4 times as much work as David. So if Sarah does x amount of work, then David does 4x amount of work.  Secondly, we are told that Raymond helps Sarah half of what she does. So if Sarah does x amount of work, then Raymond does (1/2)x amount of work. Now, let's calculate the difference between the amount of work done by Raymond and David:

Raymond does (1/2)x = (1/2)(4x) = 2x amount of work
David does 4x = 4(4x) = 16x amount of work
So, the difference between the amount of work done by Raymond and David is 16x - 2x = 14x amount of work.
Now, we are also given that Sarah did 400 pounds worth of work. So, to find out how much work Raymond and David did, we can divide the total amount of work done by Sarah by the number of times she worked:

Total amount of work done = 400 pounds
Number of times Sarah worked = 4

Therefore, the amount of work done by Raymond and David is:
Raymond did 14x pounds of work = 14(14) = 196 pounds of work
David did 16x pounds of work = 16(16) = 256 pounds of work"
Response:  If Vince buys three flowers at once for $2.50 each, he will spend a total of $7.50 ($2.50 x 3).  If he buys two flowers together for $1 each, he will spend a total of $2 ($1 x 2). So if he buys 18 flowers altogether, he will save $5.50 ($7.50 - $2) by choosing the better price option.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John adopts a dog and takes it to the vet, which costs $100. Then, the groomer offers him a discount of 30%. So, if John becomes a new client, he will pay less for the grooming service. Therefore, the cost of the grooming service = $100 - (30% x $100) = $100 - $30 = $70.
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters each, so they got 24 / 3 = 8 liters each. Then, the boy got 6 liters more, so he got 8 + 6 = 14 liters in total. Therefore, there were 24 - 14 = 10 liters left.
Response:  Firstly, Charlie bought 21 stickers from the shop in the shopping center and received 23 stickers as a gift for his birthday. So, he has a total of 44 stickers (21 + 23). Then, he gave away 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 35 stickers (44 - 9). Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a card, so he has 6 stickers left (35 - 28). Therefore, Charlie has 6 stickers left.
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs less than her. So, if we assume that Alex weighs x pounds, then their total weight would be:  Grace - Alex = 125 - x  Since Alex weighs less than Grace, this equation simplifies to: 125 - x = x + 125  Solving for x, we get:  x = 37  Therefore, Grace and Alex together weigh 162 pounds (Grace - 125) + (Alex - 37) = 162 pounds.
Response:  We know that Dan has planted three rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Therefore, there are 3 x 25 = 75 roses in total. Now we need to count how many thorns each rose has. According to the question, each rose has 8 thorns. So, there are 75 x 8 = 600 thorns in total.
Response:  We know that the team played 22 matches and won 8 more than they lost. So, we can write an equation as follows: Won = Lost + X Where X is the number of wins. Now, we are given that the team won 8 more than they lost. Therefore, we can substitute this value in the above equation: Won = Lost + 8 Substituting the values, we get: Won = 22 - Lost + 8 Solving for Lost, we get: Lost = Won - 14 Since the team won 8 more than they lost, we can substitute this value in the previous equation: Won = 22 - (Won - 14) Solving for Won, we get: Won = 36 Therefore, the football team won 36 matches out of the total 22 games they played.
Response:  Since Gene has been going on vacation every four years since he was 23 (he is now 34), he has gone on vacation 16 times. Each time he goes on vacation, he makes one more block for his quilt. So, he has made 16 blocks total. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  The first time it went off, it rang four times. So the second time it went off, it had to ring for three times longer than the first time, which is 4 x 3 = 12 times. And the third time it went off, it had to ring for half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times. Therefore, the alarm went off a total of 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times today.
"Response:  First year (year 1): $600 x 10% = $60; Total annual salary for Year 1 = $600 + $60 = $660. Second year (Year 2): $660 x 10% = $66; Total annual salary for Year 2 = $660 + $66 = $726. Third year (Year 3): $726 x 10% = $72.60; Total annual salary for Year 3 = $726 + $72.60 = $898.60. Therefore, after three years of service, Sylvie’s annual salary would be $898.60."
Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times as many records as Harald. So if Harald sold x records, then Marilyn sold 10x records.  Since together they sold 88,000 records, we can set up the equation: 10x + x = 88,000.  Solving for x, we get: x = 44,000. Therefore, Harald sold 44,000 records.
Response:  We know that Christina invited 16 friends to her birthday party and she needs 75 gift bags in total (since not all guests will come). So, we can calculate the cost of each gift bag as follows: Total number of gift bags needed = Number of guests x Number of gift bags per guest Total number of gift bags needed = 16 x 75 Total number of gift bags needed = $1,200 ($2 per gift bag) Therefore, Christina will spend $1,200 on gift bags for her birthday party.
Response:  We know that an adult dinosaur can eat 10 pounds of salad (which is equal to 4.5 kg). Since there are 20 adults at the picnic, they will need 80 kg (20 x 4.5 kg) of salad in total. As for the children, since each child needs half as much food as an adult, they will need 40 kg (half of 80 kg) of salad. So, in total, Ted needs to bring 120 kg (80 + 40) of salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.
Response:  We know that Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, so if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets.  We also know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Cindy has x-2 pets. Finally, we are told that Cindy has four pets, so x - 2 = 4. Solving for x, we get x = 6. Therefore, Jan has 3(6) = 18 pets.
Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write:  Age of Amy = Age of Jackson + 5  Age of Corey = Age of Jackson + 2  Now, we are given that James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey. So, we can write:  Age of James = Age of Corey - 1  Substituting these equations into each other, we get:  Age of Jackson = 5 + 2 = 7 Years old  Therefore, Jackson is 7 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lee can run 400 meters with hurdles in 38 seconds. If he runs at this speed for 200 meters (which is half of the distance), his time will be 38 x 2 = 76 seconds. Now, let's assume that Gerald improved his speed by 10%. This means that if he ran the same distance as Lee, he would finish in 76 + (10% of 76) = 76 + 7.6 = 83.6 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters with hurdles in 83.6 seconds.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 times fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined. So if there are x dogs, then there are 12x rabbits. Since there are 60 dogs, we can set up the equation:

12x = 60

Now divide both sides of the equation by 12 to solve for x:

x = 5

So there are 5 rabbits in total in the neighborhood."
"Response:  We know that out of 200 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in the girl scouts. So, if we multiply this proportion with 200, we get:

Number of boys = (2/5) x 200 = 40
Number of girls = (2/3) x 200 = 120
So there are 40 boys and 120 girls not in the girl scouts."
Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for x hours, we know that x/3 = 9. Solving for x, we get x = 18 hours. So, Harry slept for 9 + 18 = 27 hours more than James.
Response:  We know that when Freda cooked her tomatoes in sauce, they lost half of their volume. So if she used x grams of tomatoes initially, after cooking, it would be 50% less than that amount = (x/2) grams. Now we are given that each blikje tomaten contains 40 grams of tomatoes and there were three such blikjes in Freda's last batch of tomato sauce. Therefore, the total number of grams of tomatoes Freda used is equal to the number of blikjes times the weight of one blikje = (3 \* 40) grams = 120 grams.
Response:  In the first 15 minutes, 5 cars took an exit and did not pass through the traffic jam. So, there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars that passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes.
Response:  We know that Maria has already two plants per each of the forty windowsills in her big house, so she has 2 x 40 = 80 plants at home. And now she wants to give some away tomorrow to friends and family, so she will have fewer plants than before. Let's assume she gives away half of them (which is a reasonable assumption since she only needs to prepare small pots for gifts). So, after giving away half of her plants, Maria will have 80 - (half of 80) = 80 - 40 = 40 plants left at home.
Response:  The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. So, the total number of presses made by all four friends is:  4 x 20 = 80 presses. Now, let's analyze each friend's contribution to the total number of presses:   Friend 1 : 20 presses   Friend 2 : (1/4) x 20 = 5 presses   Friend 3 : (10/4) x 5 = 25 presses   Friend 4 : 60 presses Total number of presses made by all four friends is: 80 + 5 + 25 + 60 = 170 presses. Therefore, the doorbell rang 170 times.
Response:  We know that Solo has to read 4 pages from his scientific book, 20 pages from his social science book, 7 pages from his historical book, and 8 pages from his geography book in total. If he reads 15 pages on Monday, then he has 3 days left to read the remaining pages. To find out how many pages he needs to read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he has left:  Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 Pages left to read = 49 - 15 = 34 pages Days left to read = 3 Four days  So, Solo needs to read approximately 8.5 pages per day (34 pages / 3 days).
"Response: 
John drinks glasses of water every day at breakfast, lunch and dinner. So he has 3 x 3 = 9 glasses of water per day. 
Since John works 5 days a week, he has 9 x 5 = 45 glasses of water per week."
Response:  The distance from the ocean to the city is 42 miles (or 67 kilometers). Since it takes 10 minutes for each 3 miles of coverage, we can calculate how long it will take for the entire city to be covered as follows: Time = Distance / Speed = 67 km / 10 min/3 mi = 6700 seconds or approximately 109 minutes. Therefore, the mist will cover the entire city in about 109 minutes.
Response:  Poppy had 1000 pieces of the puzzle and placed a quarter (250) on the board. Then her mother placed a third (333) of the remaining pieces (667). So now there are 667 - 333 = 334 pieces left to place. Therefore, Poppy needs to place 334 more pieces on the board.
Response:  If Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, that means Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. So together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.
Response:  First we need to find out how many cubic inches are in each box. We know that each box has a length of 5 inches, a width of 6 inches and a height of 4 inches. So, the volume of one box = length x width x height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches. Now, we have three boxes, so the total volume of all three boxes = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches. Finally, since the walls are 1 cm thick, we subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of the boxes to get the net volume of the containers = 360 - (1 cm x 3 boxes) = 360 - 3 = 357 cubic inches.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, he watched one episode of his favorite program each night. So, he watched a total of 2 episodes (1 x 2 = 2) on those days.  On Wednesday, he watched 2 episodes of a show that lasted for 30 minutes each, so he watched a total of 4 episodes (2 x 30 = 60 minutes / 60 seconds per minute = 1 hour).  On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour-long episode of his favorite program followed by another 30-minute show. So, he watched a total of 2 hours (1 x 60 = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes). Therefore, he watched a total of 9 episodes (2 x 7 = 14 + 4 + 2 = 16 episodes).
Response:  Last year, Henry made x koekjes. This year, he wants to earn twice as much as last year, so he makes 2x koekjes. However, when he finishes baking, he realizes that he has accidentally made 15 more koekjes than he intended, so he actually has 2x + 15 = 110 koekjes. Therefore, the number of koekjes Henry made last year was x = 110 / 2 = 55.
Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline at a local station for $3,00 per gallon and gets $20 cash back per gallon from an app company, then they will have to pay $30,000 for the gasoline ($3,00 x 10 gallons). However, after getting the cashback, their total cost would be reduced to $28,000 ($30,000 - $20 x 10 gallons). So, they would still have $28,000 left after applying the cashback.
Response:  We know that Beatrice had 24 roll-ups long and Marcell had 14 roll-ups long. So, if they both eat their entire amount, Beatrice will have eaten 24/2 = 12 roll-ups and Marcell will have eaten 14/1 = 14 roll-ups. Therefore, the average number of roll-ups each person ate is (12 + 14) / 2 = 13 roll-ups.
Response:  We know that Julia took two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back to shore. Since it took her sixteen seconds to row six meters, she rowed back six times farther than she originally went out (since six meters is only one-sixth of the distance she traveled). So she rowed back a total of sixty meters (6 x 10 = 60). Therefore, the boat took in two hundred liters of water during this time (2 L/10 ft x 60 m = 200 L). Finally, we are told that it took Julia sixteen seconds to reach the coast, which means that the coast was 64 seconds away from where she started (since she rowed at a constant speed and didn't stop). Thus, the total distance between where Julia started and the coast is equal to 64 seconds / 16 seconds per meter = 4 meters. So the boat took in 200 liters of water while traveling four meters towards the coast.
Response:  Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons per day, there will be a total of 8 lessons per day (4 x 2 = 8).  If the whiteboard is cleaned thrice per lesson, then it will be cleaned 24 times per day (8 x 3 = 24).
Response:  If Ryan plants two flowers per day and does this for 15 days, he will have planted a total of 30 flowers (2 x 15 = 30). Now, if 5 of these flowers do not grow, then out of the remaining 25 flowers, how many will Ryan have after 15 days? Well, each flower takes 15 days to grow, so it will take 375 days (25 x 15 = 375) for all the flowers to fully grow. Therefore, Ryan will have 25 - 5 = 20 flowers left after 15 days.
Response:  We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos and Brittany's phone can hold 6 times more than Jamal's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 x 6 = 10800 photos. Now we are given that the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can contain is 50 times more than the number of birds on Jamal's photo of ducks in the zoo. Therefore, if there are X birds on Jamal's photo of ducks in the zoo, then Brittany's phone can contain at most 50X photos. Substituting X with the number of birds on Jamal's photo (which is 30), we get: 10800 < 50(30) = 1500. Therefore, there are 1500 ducks on Jamal's photo of ducks in the zoo.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has ten 2x4x10 planks left to sell after buying some more wood. The cost of each plank is $10, so she will make $100 from selling these planks (10 planks x $10 per plank).  Next, we are given that Sasha also has five 4x4x10 planks left to sell. These planks cost her $16 each, so she will make $80 from selling them (five planks x $16 per plank). In total, Sasha will make $180 in profit ($100 + $80) from selling all the planks she has left.
Response:  We know that Katy uses 7:13 as her ratio for making coffee with tea leaves and water. This means she uses 7 parts of tea leaves to every 13 parts of water. If she has used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar (which is equal to 7 x 17 teaspoons), then we can calculate how many teaspoons of sugar she actually used by dividing 120 by 13. Therefore, Katy used approximately 9 teaspoons of sugar.
Response:  John bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. So he bought a total of 6 pairs of shoes. The cost of each pair is $60, so the total cost is: 6 x $60 = $360. Therefore, John has paid $360.
Response:  On day one, there were two containers with five vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles was 10 (2 x 5).  On the second day, more containers arrived, but we don't know how many. So, let's assume that X containers arrived and each container has 5 vehicles inside. Therefore, the total number of vehicles introduced on the second day is 5X.
Response:  Four years ago, Adrien's salary was $40,000 and Lylah's salary was $60,000 (according to the problem). So their combined salary four years ago was $100,000 ($40,000 + $60,000).  Now, we know that Adrien's salary has increased by 40% since then, so his new salary is $56,000 ($100,000 x 0.4). And we also know that Lylah's salary has increased by 30% since then, so her new salary is $78,000 ($100,000 x 0.3). Therefore, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is $134,000 ($56,000 + $78,000).
Response:  If Miguel uses two paper blocks per week and there are 30 rolls of paper on the road, then he will use 2 x 30 = 60 paper blocks per month.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 pears, so together they had 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half as many pears as Morisette, which means he brought 1/2 x 8 = 4 pears. So, altogether they had 13 + 10 + 4 = 27 fruits.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than on Monday, so she slept for 6 hours each day (6 - 2 = 4). Therefore, she totalled 4 + 4 + 8 = 16 hours of sleep during those three days. For the remaining two days of the week, Thursday and Friday, she slept one hour more per day than she did on Monday, so she slept for 9 hours on Thursday and 10 hours on Friday (9 + 10 = 19). In conclusion, Sadie slept a total of 16 + 19 = 35 hours throughout the entire week.
"Response:  If Rosie can run for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, she will have covered a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 mi/h x 3 h = 30 mi

Now, if she runs at a speed of 8 km/h after that, she will cover a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 8 km/h x 4 h = 32 km

So, in total, Rosie can cover a distance of:

Total Distance = Distance before break + Distance after break = 30 mi + 32 km = 62 mi

Therefore, Rosie can run 62 miles (or 62 km) in 7 hours."
"Response:  When Jennie started working at her mother's office, there were x brieven that needed stamps and y brieven that had already been stamped. Since Jennie set seals on one-third of the letters that required stamps, we can write an equation as follows:
x + (2/3)y = 30
Now let's solve for x:
x = (30 - (2/3)y) / (1 - (2/3))
Substituting y = 60 (the total number of letters):
x = (30 - 40) / (1 - 2/3)
x = 20
So when Jennie began working at her mother's office, there were 20 letters that needed stamps."
Response:  Julia bought a new pack of 5 lepels and later her husband gave her another 5 lepels, so there are 10 lepels in total.  Then, she used 3 of them to taste the stew, leaving her with 7 lepels. Therefore, there were 7 lepels in the original pack that Julia bought.
"Response:  We know that Dylan has bought 38 kipworstjes and 6 more visworstjes than kipworstjes. So, if he has bought x kipworstjes, then he has also bought 6 + x visworstjes. Since we are asked how many worstjes Dylan has bought in total, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + (6 + x) = 38

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 6 = 38

Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 32

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 16

So, Dylan has bought 16 kipworstjes and 6 more visworstjes than kipworstjes in total."
Response:  If Amy made 20 more friends than Lily after transferring to a new school, then Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends in total.  Since Lily already had 50 friends before transferring, and she gained no new friends afterward, Lily still has 50 friends in total. Therefore, together, Lily and Amy have 70 + 50 = 120 friends.
Response:  We know that one watermeloen costs three times as much as each pepper, so if one watermeloen costs $3x, then each pepper costs $3x/3 = x dollars. Therefore, the total cost of 4 watermeloens will be 4(3x) = 12x dollars.  Similarly, the total cost of 20 paprikas will be 20(x) = 20x dollars. Finally, the total cost of 10 sinaasappels will be 10(x-5) = 10x - 50 dollars (since each sinaasapple costs 5 less than a watermeloen). So, the total amount that Dillon will have to pay is 12x + 20x + 10x - 50 = 42x dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 500 people visit the hospital every day and each patient spends an average of 24 minutes at the hospital. Therefore, the total time spent by all patients in one day is:  Time = Number of patients x Average time per patient = 500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day Now, let's calculate the total amount earned by the hospital from these visits: Total earnings = Number of doctors x Doctor's fee + Hospital fee = 30 doctors (assuming there are 30 doctors working at the hospital) x $150/hour + $200/hour = $43,500/day ($150/hour x 30 doctors) + $60,000/day ($200/hour x 500 patients) = $103,500/day The hospital makes a profit of $103,500 per day from these visits.
Response:  We know that 60 seasonal workers were hired to play games in the Christmas town of her department store. A third of them stopped working after children were given away, so we can assume that 20 elves stopped working in this situation. Additionally, 10 of the remaining elves stopped working after children trapped their shinbones, leaving us with 40 elves still working. Therefore, there are 40 elves left working.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Joseph's total outgoings for May were $500. Secondly, we are told that his outgoings in June were $60 less than they were in May. Therefore, his total outgoings for June can be calculated as follows: Total outgoings in June = Outgoings in May - ($60) So, Joseph's total outgoings for both months can be calculated as follows: Total outgoings for May and June = Outgoings in May + Outgoings in June = $500 + (Total outgoings in June - $60) = $500 + (-$60) = $440 Therefore, Joseph's total outgoings for those two months were $440.
Response:  Pam rode two times on the roller coaster and Fred four times. So together they rode 2 + 4 = 6 times on the roller coaster. Then, they decided to ride twice on the log flume. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, they used 6 x 2 = 12 tickets that day. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  We know that Walt ran 6 km on Monday and 6 times as much as Monday on Tuesday, so he ran 36 km on Tuesday. Therefore, he ran 47 km (6 x 8 = 47) on Wednesday. So, the answer is 47 mi.
Response:  We know that Tom gets four cars washed every month and each car costs $15 to wash. So, he pays $15 x 4 = $60 per month for washing his cars. Now, let's calculate how much he pays per year: $60 x 12 = $720 per year. Therefore, Tom pays $720 per year for washing his cars.
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 videogames and lost 5 just before the comparison. So, Brian has 20 - 5 = 15 videogames left. Now, we are told that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many videogames as Brian. In other words, Bobby has 3 × (15) = 45 videogames. Therefore, Bobby has 45 videogames.
"Response:  We know that there are still 27 European elks (or ""wapiti"") alive in the world. Of those, one-third are located in the Scottish Highlands. Now, two-thirds of the Scottish elks are female. So, how many female Scottish elks are there?  Solution: To find out how many female Scottish elks there are, we need to multiply the number of Scottish elks by the fraction of females among them. If two-thirds of the Scottish elks are female, then the number of female Scottish elks is 2/3 x 27 = 18. Therefore, there are 18 female Scottish elks."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately as follows: Broodje = $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 Chips = $1.50 x 2 = $3.00 Koekje = $1.00 x 2 = $2.00 Now let's add these costs together to get the total cost of her order: Total Cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 However, there is an additional delivery charge of 20%, which means that the final cost will be: Final Cost = $20.00 x 20% = $4.00 So, the total cost of Rory's order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark completed the first test with a speed of 5 questions per hour and it consisted of 75 questions in total. Therefore, he took (75/5) = 15 hours to complete the test. Now, let's find out how much time he spent on the second test. Since he did the second test with the same speed as before, i.e., 5 questions per hour, he will take (100/5) = 20 hours to complete the second test. However, since he only had 8 hours today, he could not finish both tests completely. So, the number of questions left unanswered is equal to the time taken to complete the second test minus the time taken to complete the first test, which is (20 - 15) = 5 questions.  Therefore, Mark left 5 questions unanswered.
Response:  We know that there are 22 red gum balls in total and four times as many blue gum balls. So, if there are 12 blue gum balls, then there must be 4 x 12 = 48 red gum balls. Therefore, there are 22 + 48 = 70 gum balls in total.
"Response:  We know that out of 20 cars for rent, there are 12 automatic cars, 4 manual cars and the remaining are semi-automatic cars. So, we can write this as follows:

Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = 6 (remaining)

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars available for rent:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) x 100%
= (6 / 20) x 100%
= 30%

Therefore, 30% of the 20 cars for rent are semi-automatic."
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and we want to find out how many workers there are among them.  There are twice as many worker bees as drones (baby bees), so if there are x drone bees, then there are 2x worker bees. Similarly, there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so if there are y queen bees, then there are 2y baby bees. Now let's substitute these values into our equation:  Total number of bees = x + 2x + y + 2y  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Number of workers = x + y  Substituting the given values, we get:  Workers = 700 - 1400 = -700  So, there are -700 workers among the 700 bees.
"Response:  If Jordan plays video games for two hours every day and earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, he will have earned $20 per day from both activities combined (2 hours gaming + 8 hours work). Therefore, in one week, he would have earned:
$20/day x 7 days = $140
So, if Jordan were to spend all of his time working instead of playing video games, he would earn $140 in one week."
Response:  First, let's calculate how much John paid for each item without taxes: Melk: $2 Dollars Eieren: $3 Dollars Gloeilampen: $3 Dollars Bekers: $3 Dollars Kakkerlakvallen: $4 Dollars Total cost without taxes: $17 Now, we need to calculate the tax amount based on the non-food items. The tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the total cost by 0.10 (the tax rate): Tax amount = $17 x 0.10 = $1.70 So, the total cost including taxes is: Total cost with taxes = $17 + $1.70 = $18.70
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucas has three customers already and he expects to get five more customers. So, his total number of customers will be 8 (3 + 5).  Secondly, each customer needs two bottles of cleaning solution and one package of cloths, so the total number of bottles needed is 16 (2 x 8 customers). The cost of each bottle is $2, so the total cost of bottles is $32 (16 x $2). Similarly, the total cost of cloths is $40 (5 x $8). Thirdly, Lucas calculates his total income per week as $92 ($32 + $40), which means that his profit per week is $92 - $72 = $20. Therefore, Lucas will make a profit of $20 per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John has 10 hectares of land for growing ananas. Therefore, he can grow a total number of ananases equal to 100 ananassen per hectare x 10 hectares = 1000 ananassen in total. Now, we are told that John can harvest his ananas every 3 months. So, within one year (i.e., 4 times 3 months), John can harvest a total number of ananases equal to 1000 ananassen / 4 = 250 ananassen per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 500 Legos in the first box. Since Johnny has dumped all of them on the floor, he now has 500 + 500 = 1000 Legos.  Next, we have another box with three times as many pieces as the first one, which means it contains 3 x 1000 = 3000 Legos. Finally, there is a third box with 1/4 of the total number of Legos, which means it contains 1/4 x 3000 = 750 Legos. Therefore, Johnny has a total of 1000 + 3000 + 750 = 4750 Legos.
Response:  We know that:  - In the first 6 hours of the day, 30 bees left the hive and did not return (Debra saw them leave).  - Half of these bees returned to the hive within the next 6 hours (since Debra saw twice as many bees leaving than returning). So, half of 30 = 15 bees returned to the hive during this time period.  - After 6 hours, all of the bees that had left the hive earlier came back (since they were gone for only 6 hours). Therefore, the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is equal to the original number of bees that left + the number that returned after 6 hours = 30 + 15 = 45 bees.
Response:  The cost of one adult ticket is $12 and one child ticket is $10. So, if Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8, that means she only paid for one child ticket ($10). Therefore, the amount of money that Brittany's mother gave to the cashier is $8 - $10 = -$2.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then Charlie has 3x friends.  Moreover, we are told that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. Therefore, if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then James has 4x friends.  Now, let's assume that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. Then, we can set up the following equation: 3x = 12... (1) 4x = 12... (2)  Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: x = 6 and 4x = 48. So, James has 48 friends on Facebook.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. Since he lives three miles away from the school, it will take him 3/440 = 15 minutes to reach home if he wins the race. Now, let's find out how long Tim will take to reach home if he loses the race. We know that Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. Since he lives two miles away from the school, it will take him 2/264 = 8 minutes to reach home if he loses the race. Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for 15 - 8 = 7 minutes before reaching home after winning the race.
Response: 1) The total number of people who came to use the bike-tuning service was 5 (not 3 as stated in the problem). 2) Each person needed two tires to be inflated, so the total number of tires that were inflated was 10 (5 x 2 = 10). 3) Since each tire cost $0.25 to inflate, the total amount earned by Shawnda that day was $2.50 (10 x $0.25 = $2.50).
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of cookies and each package contains six cookies, then he will buy 60 cookies in total (10 x 6 = 60). Since each cookie costs $0.10, the total cost of all the cookies is $6.00 (60 x $0.10 = $6.00). Therefore, if Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will receive $4.00 in change ($10 - $6.00 = $4.00).
Response:  When Dave bought the large package of fries, there were 14 fries before the hungry seagull stole the entire packet from him. The seagull then ate half of the original number of fries, which means that he ate 7 fries (half of 14). Then, three ducks came and each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries (3 x 3 = 9). After that, a beaver stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is equal to 5 fries (2/3 x 7 = 5). Finally, five mice took one fry each, leaving behind 4 fries (5 x 1 = 4). Therefore, when Dave bought the package of fries, there were 4 fries left in it.
Response:  On Monday, Tuesday and Friday, Kimo has three one-hour lessons, so that is 3 x 1 = 3 hours/week.  On Wednesday, he has two two-hour lessons, so that is 2 x 2 = 4 hours/week. Therefore, Kimo spends a total of 3 + 4 = 7 hours/week at his lessons. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends a total of 7 x 16 = 112 hours in a semester attending lessons.
Response:  If Bill makes 300 sandwiches and each sandwich has 10 cm length, then he makes a total of 3000 cm (or 3 meters) of sandwiches per day.  Similarly, if he makes 120 chocolate crosses and each one is 20 cm long, then he makes a total of 2400 cm (or 2.4 meters) of chocolate crosses per day. And finally, if he makes 60 baguettes and each one is 60 cm long, then he makes a total of 3600 cm (or 3.6 meters) of baguettes per day. So altogether, Bill makes a total of 9 meters of bread per day.
"Response:  We know that there are three types of apes in the zoo: gorillas, baboons and orangutans. The total number of bananas needed for all these apes is given as follows: Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, baboons need 100 bananas per month, and orangutans need 200 bananas per month. To find out how many bananas the vendor needs to buy each month, we can multiply the number of apes of each type by their respective banana requirements: For gorillas, it would be 400 x 2 = 800 bananas per month; for baboons, it would be 100 x 2 = 200 bananas per month; and for orangutans, it would be 200 x 2 = 400 bananas per month. Therefore, the total number of bananas required for two months is: 800 + 200 + 400 = 1400 bananas. So, the vendor must purchase 1400 bananas every two months to keep the apes fed."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Blake runs 15 times back and forth along the football field, which means he covers a distance of 100 meters x 15 = 1500 meters.  Next, we are told that Kelly only runs once from one end of the field to the other (a distance of 100 meters), but then she decides not to race anymore and runs back to the 40-yard line and returns, covering a distance of 40 yards x 2 = 80 meters. Therefore, the total distance covered by Kelly is 80 + 100 = 180 meters.  Now, since Blake covers more distance than Kelly, the winner is Blake. So, the answer is:  Blake - 1500 meters > Kelly - 180 meters.
Response:  Raphael bought 4 pens that cost $1.5 each, so he paid $6 for those. He also bought two notebooks that cost $4 each, so he paid $8 for them. Finally, he bought a pad of paper for obligations that cost $20. Therefore, in total, Raphael paid $6 + $8 + $20 = $34. So, the answer is $34.
Response:  We know that Finn sees six of the frogs swimming in the pond and two hiding under rocks. So, we can conclude that there are eight frogs left in the pond (6 + 2 = 8). Therefore, Finn can see 8 frogs in the pond.
Response:  On Monday (5 meters deep), the tank gained 2 meters of water, so it was now 7 meters deep (Monday + 2 = 7).  On Tuesday (tweederde of Monday), the tank lost half of its depth, which means it became 3.5 meters deep (Tuesday - half of 7 = 3.5). Therefore, the water depth of the tank on Wednesday is 3.5 meters.
Response:  We know that Anakin has caught 10 sea stars, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish.  We also know that Locsin has caught fewer sea stars than Anakin (5 instead of 10), fewer seahorses than Anakin (3 instead of 6), but more clownfish than Anakin (2 instead of 3). So, in total, Anakin has caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish, while Locsin has caught 5 + 3 = 8 fish. Therefore, together they have caught 19 + 8 = 27 fish.
Response:  The original price of one bag of chips is $20. Every two months, the price increases by 20% of the original price. So after 1 month, the new price will be: $20 x (1 + 0.20) = $24. After 2 months, the new price will be: $24 x (1 + 0.20) = $28. And so on... To find out how much a bag of chips would cost after 36 months, we can continue this calculation: $20 x (1 + 0.20) ^ 36 = $57.60. Therefore, after 36 months, a bag of chips would cost approximately $57.60.
Response:  We know that one red car costs four dollars and three acts cost five dollars each. So, if we have three acts, they would cost thirty-five dollars ($5 x 3 = $15 + $5 x 2 = $30). Now let's add the value of the pop toy. The pop toy costs three action figures plus an additional dollar for the fourth figure, so it costs a total of four dollars more than the three actions figures combined (i.e., $4 = $3 + $1). Therefore, the total value of all the toys in the room is: $30 + $4 = $34.
Response:  If she does her taxes herself and saves 3 hours of freelance work time at $35/hour, that means she can earn $105 (3 hours x $35/hour). However, if she hires an accountant for $90, then she will have to pay that amount regardless of how much time she saves or doesn't save from doing her own taxes. So, the bottom line is that she would be better off financially by hiring an accountant instead of doing it herself.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has a budget of $1500 given by her whole family for buying a new computer and an additional amount for purchasing clothes.  Therefore, she will have $1500 - ($1090 + $157 + $74 + $102) = $369 left for buying clothes.
Response:  We know that Sandra needs three eggs to make one Spanish flan. So if she wants to make 15 Spanish flans for the fundraising event of her school, she will need 15 x 3 = 45 eggs. Therefore, Sandra must check her neighbor's mandje (basket) 45 times to get all the necessary eggs.
"Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke and in two years, their combined age will be 28. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Seth's age = 2 x Brooke's age + 2
Now we have to solve for Seth's age. Let's substitute the given values:
Seth's age = 2 x Brooke's age + 2
= 2 x (10) + 2
= 20 + 2
= 22
So Seth is 22 years old."
Response:  Jimmy has two dollars more than Ethel, so if Ethel has $8, then Jimmy has $10 ($8 + 2).
"Response: 
Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day, except for the weekends when he walks 10 miles. To find out how many miles he walks in a week, we need to convert kilometers to miles and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.
So, if Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day during the week (Monday to Friday), that means he walks a total distance of:
30 km/day x 5 days = 150 km/week
And if he walks 10 miles per day on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), that means he walks a total distance of:
10 mi/day x 2 days = 20 miles/week
Therefore, the total distance Pancho walks in a week is:
150 km + 20 miles = 170 miles/week"
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of each hat is $25. Next, we are told that the cost of each shirt is three times the cost of the hat. Therefore, the cost of each shirt is $25 x 3 = $75. Finally, we are given that the cost of each pair of pants is equal to the total cost of the hat and the shirt. So, the cost of each pair of pants is $25 + $75 = $100. Thus, the total cost of each uniform is $25 (for the hat) + $75 (for the shirt) + $100 (for the pants) = $290.
Response:  We know that there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each = 640 legs. Then we have 90 insects with 6 legs each = 540 legs. Finally, we have 3 rare mutant creatures with 10 legs each = 30 legs. Therefore, in total, Jake sees 670 legs at the museum.
Response: 1. Sally Three is three years older than Oma Red, so Sally Three is 3 + 2 = 5 years old. 2. Oma Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Oma Red is 2 x 4 = 8 years old. 3. Sally Forty-Two is the same age as Sally Three, so Sally Forty-Two is also 5 years old. 4. Sally Thirty-Two is 8 years old. Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 5 + 5 + 8 + 8 = 36 years.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica has to pay each month for her loans and debts. For example, she needs to pay $300 as tuition fee, $200 as credit card bill, and $500 as mortgage payment. Therefore, her total monthly expenses come out to be $1000. Now, if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum amount, then she will have to pay $1500 per month ($1000 + (50% of $1000) = $1500). So, in one year, Jessica will have paid $18,000 ($1500 x 12 months).
Response:  We know that Billy has to cut 60 aardappelen for his family reunion barbecue. Since each aardapple takes him half a minute to shred and five seconds to slice, we can calculate how long it will take him to finish cutting all of them as follows: Time taken = Number of aardappelen x Time per aardapple Total time = 60 aardappelen x (half a minute + five seconds) Total time = 35 minutes + 30 seconds Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 35 minutes and 30 seconds to cut all 60 aardappeles for his family reunion barbecue.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that they sell one gallon of lemonade and get 20 glasses from it. So, if they make $25 in profit, then the total number of glasses sold is:

$25 / $0.50 = 50 glasses

Now, let's calculate how much juice they use for each glass:

1 gallon / 50 glasses = 0.02 gallons per glass

So, they use 0.02 gallons of juice for each glass of lemonade they sell. Now, let's find out how much juice they use overall:

Total juice used = Number of glasses x Juice used per glass
= 50 glasses x 0.02 gallons/glass
= 1 gallon (or 3.78 liters)

Therefore, they have used approximately 1 gallon (or 3.78 liters) of juice to make their profits of $25."
Response:  We know that there were 80 Japanese people and 160 Asian people (not just Chinese) in total. So, if 60 of them are boys, then the number of girls among the Chinese is equal to 60 - 80 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, Zaid spends $1500 (3/4 of his salary) on rent, which leaves him with $4500 ($6000 - $1500). Then he spends $500 (1/3 of his remaining salary) on fuel for his car, leaving him with $3500 ($4500 - $500). Next, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife, so he has $2900 left ($3500 - $200 - $700). Therefore, after all these expenses, Zaid has $2900 left in his bank account.
"Response:  We know that:
Rani has ten more crabs than Monic (10 - 4 = 6).
Monic has four fewer crabs than Bo (4 - 40 = -36).
So, together they have:
Rani + Monic = 6 + (-36) = -29
Therefore, the total number of crabs that the three together have is -29."
Response:  In the first week, Lloyd gave 5 hours of tutoring, so he earned $5 x 5 = $25.  In the second week, he gave 8 hours of tutoring, so he earned $8 x 8 = $64.  Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $25 + $64 = $89 during the first two weeks.
Response:  We know that the winner got 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Winner's votes = Total votes x (3/4) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Winner's votes = 80 x (3/4) = 60 So, the verlierder received 20 votes.
"Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white anthers. So if she ordered x white anthers, she ordered 4x red roses.  Since she also ordered 200 roze calla lilies and five times as many white anthers, we can say that she ordered 5x white anthers.  Therefore, the total number of flowers Sandra ordered is:

x + (4x) + (5x) = ... = 160

We are told that Sandra threatened to switch to another supplier unless the missing red roses were delivered within 5 hours. To keep Sandra's account, Fred needs to deliver 160/5 = 32 red roses per hour until all orders are fulfilled."
Response:  We know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is x years old, then Jean is x + 2 years old.  Two years ago, Mark was five years older than Jan. So, if Jan is 30 years old now, then Mark was 35 years old two years ago. Therefore, Jean is 37 years old (x + 2) + 2 = 39 years old.
Response:  The faster team will win because their first runner will run the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, while the slower team's first runner will take 60 seconds to complete the same distance. Therefore, the difference between the two times is 55 - 60 = -5 seconds. Since this is a negative value, it means that the faster team will finish ahead of the slower team by 5 seconds. So, the final time for the faster team will be 55 + 5 = 60 seconds, and the final time for the slower team will be 60 + 5 = 65 seconds.
Response:  If Jerry goes an odd number, he has a 50% chance of getting an odd number again.  If he goes an even number, he has a 50% chance of getting an even number again. So the probability that he gets two consecutive numbers is 25%. Therefore, the probability that he gets a number greater than 3 is 75%.
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked half of their apple farm's apples (which is equal to 10 apples), then if Jenna's mother got 20 apples as her share, that means Jenna must have received 30 apples (since she plucked half). So, they both picked 30 apples in total.
Response:  We know that there are three coops with rats, each containing an equal number of rats. Since each rat gets 6 pieces of food, we can say that the total amount of food for all rats is 3 x 6 = 18 pieces of food. Now, let's find out how many rats there are in each cage. If there were no other animals in the store, then each rat would have gotten 18 pieces of food, so the number of rats in each cage is 18 / 3 = 6 rats per cage. Therefore, there are 6 rats in each of the three coops.  As for the hamsters, since they are kept separately from the rats, they must be counted as their own group. There are 10 hamster cages, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of food, so the total amount of food for all hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of food. Since there are no other animals in the store to share this food with the hamsters, we can conclude that each hamster has 50 / 10 = 5 pieces of food per day. Therefore, there are 5 hamsters in each of the 10 cages.  Finally, let's look at the guinea pigs. Since there are 20 guinea pig cages, and each guinea pig gets 20 pieces of food, it means that the total amount of food for all guinea pigs is 20 x 20 = 400 pieces of food. However, since there are no other animals in the store to compete with the guinea pigs for food, we can assume that each guinea pig gets its full allocation of 20 pieces of food per day. Therefore, there are 400 / 20 = 20 guinea pigs in the store.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mandy owes $100 to Benedict and they agreed upon a monthly interest rate of 2%. So after one month, Mandy will owe $100 + (2% x $100) = $100 + $2 = $102. Now let's assume that Mandy can pay off her debt after three months. Therefore, she will owe $102 x 3 = $306. So, at the end of three months, Mandy must give Benedict $306.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the trader paid $20 for each bag of wheat from the farmer. Therefore, he spent a total of $20 x number of bags = $400 to buy all the bags. Now, since he made a profit of $400, he must have sold each bag at least at a price equal to his cost + profit = $400 / number of bags. So, if he sold 'x' bags, then the revenue he generated from selling those bags is given by: Revenue = Number of bags x Price per bag = x \* ($30/bag) = x \* $300. Since he made a profit of $400, we can set up the equation: Profit = Revenue - Cost = $300 - $400 = -$100. Solving for 'x', we get: x = 4. Therefore, the trader sold 4 bags of wheat.
Response:  Firstly, they gave $20,25 for three tickets to the fair. So each ticket cost $6,75. Secondly, they spent less money on food than on tickets, so let's say they spent $x on food. Thirdly, they went on two different rides that cost $33 each time. Therefore, they spent a total of $66 on rides. Finally, we want to find out how much each person had to pay in total. So, let's use the equation: Total amount = (Ticket price x Number of tickets) + (Food expense x Number of people) + (Ride cost x Number of ride times). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total amount = ($6,75 x 3) + (x x 3) + ($66 x 2). Simplifying and solving for x, we get: Each person paid $19,25 in total.
"Response:  If John collects perzichen for 3 hours, he will have collected in total:

2 perzichen/minute x 3 uur = 60 perzichen
So John has collected 60 perzichen during those 3 hours."
"Response:  We know that each eend needs to eat 2.5 kg of insects per week. Since there are ten eends in total, we can calculate their daily food intake as follows:

Daily food intake = Weekly food intake / Number of eends
= 2.5 kg/week / 10 eends/week
= 0.25 kg/day (or 250 grams/day)
Therefore, the ten eends need approximately 0.25 kg (or 250 grams) of insects per day to survive."
"Response:

8 | 9 (after cutting 10) | - | 9 
9 | 6 (after cutting 10) | - | 6 
10 | 3 (after cutting 10) | - | 3 
Total number of trees after 10 years = Total number of trees at start - Number of trees cut down in 10 years = 50 - 30 = 20 
Therefore, Tom has 20 trees left after 10 years."
Response:  On Friday morning, the neighbors took away one-third of the original 18 pink plastic flamingos and painted them white. So, there were 6 (18 x 3/3) white flamingos left on Sue's lawn. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection, so now there are 24 total flamingos (6 + 18). Therefore, on Sunday afternoon, there were 24 roze plastic flamingo's more than witte plastic flamingo's.
"Response:  We know that violetta wants to buy new colored pencils and she needs them in 5 different colors. So, we need to find out how many of each color she can buy with her budget of $20.  The cost of one colored pencil is $2, so...

1. How many colored pencils can she buy if she has $20?

Answer: $20 / $2 = 10 colored pencils

Now, let's check which five colors she can choose from:

Red - 3 colored pencils ($6)
Blue - 4 colored pencils ($8)
Green - 5 colored pencils ($10)
Yellow - 6 colored pencils ($12)
Orange - 7 colored pencils ($14)

So, violetta can afford to buy 10 colored pencils (5 x $2). Since there are 5 different colors available, she can buy 5 of each color. Therefore, the final answer is:

Violetta will have 5 red, 5 blue, 5 green, 5 yellow, and 5 orange colored pencils."
Response:  We know that one pen costs as much as one pencil and an eraser. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, we can say that eight pens cost $8 x $1.20 = $9.60. So, eight pennies cost $9.60.
"Response:  We need to find out how many pounds of potatoes will not be used if 200 pounds are distributed among 40 restaurants. To do this, we can divide the total amount of potatoes (200 pounds) by the number of restaurants (40). This gives us the average amount of potatoes each restaurant gets (5 pounds per restaurant):

$$ \therefore \text{Average amount of potatoes each restaurant gets} = \frac{\text{Total amount of potatoes}}{\text{Number of restaurants}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5\text{ pounds} $$
Now, let's see how much potatoes will not be used. If $x$ pounds of potatoes are left over after they are divided equally among the $40$ restaurants, then the remaining amount of potatoes is equal to the total amount of potatoes minus the amount used by the restaurants:

$$ \therefore \text{Remaining amount of potatoes} = \text{Total amount of potatoes} - \frac{\text{Total amount of potatoes}}{\text{Number of restaurants}} = 200 - 5 \times 40 = 160\text{ pounds} $$
So, $160$ pounds of potatoes will not be used."
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants of Soda. Of these, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. This means that the total number of adults (men + women) is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. Now we have to find out how many children there are in Soda. To do this, we can subtract the number of adults from the total population: 17509 - 16506 = 1003. Therefore, there are 1003 children living in Soda.
Response:  First month: Elaine has 20 cards. Second month: She collects three times as much money and now has 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). Third month: She collects twice as many cards as in the second month, so she gets 120 cards (2 x 60 = 120). Therefore, Elaine has 120 Pokémon cards in total.
Response:  We know that Mark redigeert 1000 zinnen per week for two different publishers. For Publisher A, he gets $0.05 per sentence, so he earns $50 per week from Publisher A ($0.05 x 1000). For Publisher B, he gets twice as much, or $0.10 per sentence, so he earns $100 per week from Publisher B ($0.10 x 1000). Therefore, Mark's total weekly income is $150 ($50 + $100).
Response:  In the morning, he gets 6 - 5 = 1 emmer of water. So in total, he gets 1 x 5 = 5 liters of water in the morning.  In the afternoon, he gets 7 - 6 = 1 emmer of water. So in total, he gets 1 x 5 = 5 liters of water in the afternoon as well. Therefore, he gets 5 + 5 = 10 liters of water per day.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John won the prize on January 1st of a year. So he received the prize money of $5000 on that day. Then, as the question states, he got a 5% salary increase due to winning the prize. Therefore, his new weekly salary after the increase would be:

$2000 x (1 + 0.05) = $2080

Now, let's calculate how much money John has earned throughout the year:

Total earnings = Weekly income x Number of weeks in a year
= $2080 x 52
= $104640

Therefore, John has earned $104640 throughout the year."
Response:  If Josie has 10 hectares of land and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then she will have 50 tons (5 x 10) of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 vats of wine, then she will make 100 vats of wine per year (50 tons x 2 vats/ton). Therefore, her boerderij produces 100 vats of wine per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carl uses two pieces of cheese for each sandwich he makes (since he has one sandwich per day). Therefore, he uses 2 x 7 = 14 pieces of cheese for his seven days of lunches.  Secondly, we know that Carl makes three egg omelets per week and uses one extra piece of cheese per omelet than he does for his sandwiches. So, he uses 3 x (1 + 1) = 5 extra pieces of cheese for his omelets. Thirdly, we know that Carl prepares a large batch of macaroni with cheese for multiple meals throughout the week, and he uses eight pieces of cheese for this dish. Therefore, the total number of pieces of cheese Carl uses is 14 + 5 + 8 = 27 pieces of cheese.
Response:  We know that Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so together she had 32 pens (22 + 10 = 32). Then, she bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag contained 9 blue pens and 6 red pens, respectively. So, altogether Janet acquired 6 + 2 = 8 additional pens. Therefore, her current total number of pens is 32 + 8 = 40 pens.
Response:  We know that Brinley has scored 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests. To get an average of 93, she needs to score at least 93 - (lowest score / number of tests) = 93 - (86 / 5) = 93 - 17 = 76 on the sixth test. Therefore, Brinley needs to score at least 76 on the sixth test to achieve an overall average of 93.
Response:  First four weeks, he rode at least five times/week and covered 25 km each time = total distance of 125 km (4 x 25). Then he reduced his frequency to twice/week but increased the distance to 60 km each time = total distance of 360 km (3 x 60). So, in total, Michael has ridden 485 km (125 + 360) over the four-week period.
Response:  We know that each chocolate piece weighs twice as much as each candy apple. So if one chocolate piece weighs 40 grams, then one candy apple weighs half of that or 20 grams. Now let's calculate how many pieces and apples are in Joe's bag: Number of chocolate pieces = 25 x 2 = 50 chocolate pieces Number of candy apples = 80 / 2 = 40 candy apples Since each chocolate piece weighs twice as much as an apple, the total weight of all the pieces is double the weight of all the apples: Total weight of chocolate pieces = 50 x 40 = 2000 grams Total weight of candy apples = 40 x 20 = 800 grams Therefore, Joe's bag of snoop weighs 2000 + 800 = 2800 grams.
Response:  On Monday, she bought four tarts. On Tuesday, she went to another store and bought three times as much baked goods as she bought on Monday. So, she bought 3 x 4 = 12 baked goods on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times as many baked goods as she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought 5 x 12 = 60 baked goods on Wednesday. In total, she has bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 baked goods over the course of three days.
Response:  The total cost of buying 20 cups is $1200 less than the total cost of buying half a dozen plates that each cost $6000. So, if we assume that half a dozen plates means 3 plates (since there are 6 plates in a dozen), then the total cost of buying 3 plates would be $6000 + $6000 + $6000 = $18000. Therefore, the cost of each plate would be $18000 / 3 = $6333 per plate.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has saved $10 before she started babysitting (ten dollars). Now let's calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn for her parents to save enough money to buy the new jacket and shoes. We can do this by dividing the cost of the items ($30 + $20 = $50) by the amount of money she earns per time she babysits ($5 x 4 = $20). So, Sara needs to mow the lawn four times to have enough money to buy the new jacket and shoes.
Response:  We know that the red hens produce 3 eggs per day and the white hens produce 5 eggs per day. So in total, Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he has more white hens than red hens, then the number of red hens must be less than half of the total number of hens. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: Number of red hens = x / 2 Where x is the total number of hens (including both red and white). Now we are given that Jerry has two more white hens than red hens. This means that if there are x red hens, then there are x + 2 white hens. Substituting this value into our earlier equation, we get: Number of red hens = (x + 2) / 2 Simplifying this equation, we find that the number of red hens is equal to 7. Therefore, Jerry has 7 red hens.
Response:  If he walks at 5 km/hour, then in one hour he will walk 5 kilometers. Since the park is 1.5 miles long (which is equal to 2.4 kilometers), it will take him 2.4 hours to walk around the entire park if he walks at 5 km/hour. Therefore, the answer is 2.4 hours.
Response:  On day one, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store.  On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the previous day, so she counted 150 customers (100 + 50).  Therefore, on the third day, if there were 500 customers in total, Sloane would have counted 350 customers (150 + 200).
"Response:  We know that Jerry has two swimming pools with leaks that empty them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can set up the following equation: Big Pool Water = Small Pool Water + (2 x Time) Gallons/Minute Where ""Time"" is equal to 4 minutes. Substituting the given values, we get: Big Pool Water = Small Pool Water + (2 x 4) Gallons/Minute = Small Pool Water + 8 Gallons/Minute Now, we are told that the small pool had 2 gallons of water four minutes ago. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation: Small Pool Water = 2 Gallons Now, we can solve for the current amount of water in the small pool: Small Pool Water = 2 Gallons + (2 x 4) Gallons/Minute = 2 Gallons + 8 Gallons/Minute = 10 Gallons/Minute Finally, we can find out how much water the small pool currently holds by multiplying the number of minutes since the leak started by the rate at which the water is being emptied: Small Pool Water = 10 Gallons/Minute x (5 minutes - 4 minutes) = 10 Gallons/Minute x 1 gallon/minute = 10 gallons So, the small pool now holds 10 gallons of water."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much money she has available for shopping. We know that her salary is $8/hour and she works part-time (not full time). So if she works 4 hours in one day, then she earns $8 x 4 = $32. Now let's add this amount to the total cost of the shoes and belt: $320 + $32 = $352. Therefore, she needs to work 352 / $32 = 10.69 hours to save enough money to buy the shoes and belt.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Janet borrowed from her friend in total. According to the question, she borrowed $2000 and promised to pay it back with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount that Janet owes is:

$2000 x 1.10 = $2200

Now, let's find out how much Janet pays each month. The question states that she pays $165 per month for 12 months. Therefore, the total amount that Janet pays during this period is:

$165 x 12 = $2040

So, after making these payments, how much does Janet still owe? We can subtract the amount she paid from the total amount she owes:

$2200 - $2040 = $160

Therefore, Janet still owes her friend $160."
Response:  We know that there are four roses and seven more daisies than roses in the vase. So, if there are x roses, then there are 7 + x daisies. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 4 + (7x) = Total number of flowers in the vase. Solving for x, we get: 4 + (7x) = 11. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us: 3 = x. Therefore, there are three times as many daisies as roses in the vase.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet is half as old as Zack. So we can write:
Adrian = 3 x Harriet
Harriet = Zack / 2
Now we are given that Harriet is now 21 years old. So we can substitute this value into one of the equations above:
Adrian = 3 x (21)
= 63
So Adrian is 63 years old."
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's score which means he scored at least 34 points (since Naomi scored 68 points). Therefore, Yuri's total score is 10 + 34 = 44 points. Now we are given that Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Finally, since Jojo did not score any points, her score must be equal to zero, i.e., 0 points. So, the final scores of each student are: Naomi - 68 points, Yuri - 44 points, Brianna - 85 points, and Jojo - 0 points.
Response: 10 minutes to make one crossword puzzle + 5 minutes to make one Sudoku puzzle = Total time spent making puzzles = 15 minutes. Then, in the weekend, she solved three crossword puzzles and eight Sudoku puzzles. So, total time spent solving puzzles = 3 x 10 minutes (for each crossword puzzle) + 8 x 5 minutes (for each Sudoku puzzle) = 90 minutes. Therefore, Carmen bested 90 minutes on these puzzles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. So now there are 30 liters (120 - 90) left in the tank. Secondly, we learn that Celine can collect twice as much rainwater as what remains in the tank. Therefore, if she collects X liters of rainwater, then the amount of water remaining in the tank will be 3X liters. Now, we have two equations: 120 = 3X and 30 = 2X. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us X = 40 liters. Hence, there are 40 liters of water left in the tank after Celine collected rainwater.
Response:  If Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, then he has planted a total of 50 (90 - 40) flowers. So, the answer is 50.
Response:  First year: $15,000 x 3/4 = $11,250 Second year: $11,250 + ($15,000 - $11,250) = $26,500 Total amount spent on advertising for two years: $26,500
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time each of them used their respective vehicles for.  Carlos used the kano for 3 hours and Benji used the banana boat for 5 hours. Therefore, the total time they spent using these vehicles is:  Time taken by Carlos = 3 hours Time taken by Benji = 5 hours Now, let's find out how much each one paid for their vehicle rental based on the given prices: Price of Kano Rental = $30/hour x Total time taken = $30 x 3 = $90 Price of Banana Boat Rental = $18/hour x Total time taken = $18 x 5 = $90 Since both of them took equal amounts of time using their respective vehicles, they will have to pay an equal amount as rentals. So, Carlos and Benji will have to pay $90 each for their vehicle rental.
Response:  Day 1 - travel from NJ to Rochester with the bus.  Day 2-3 - spend time in Rochester.  Day 4 - return journey from Rochester back to NJ (by car). So total days = 6 + 2 + 4 = 12 days. Therefore, he will take 12 days for his road trip.
Response:  Firstly, we know that James has 40 water-type cards out of his total collection of 90 cards. Therefore, the probability of picking a water-type card from his remaining deck is 40/90 or 0.44. Now, he loses 8 water-type cards and buys 14 grass-type cards. So, the number of water-type cards left in his deck reduces to 40 - 8 = 32. Similarly, the number of grass-type cards increases from 20 to 34 (since he bought 14 new ones). The probability of picking a water-type card now becomes 32/90 or 0.356. Since this value is between two whole numbers (0.4 and 0.5), the closest integer is 0.4. Therefore, the probability of picking a water-type card among all the remaining cards is approximately 0.4.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of the basic burrito without any additional ingredients or upgrades. The base price of the burrito is $6.50. Then, we can add the costs of the additional ingredients and upgrades that Chad chose: * Extra vlees ($2) + * Extra kaas ($1) + * Avocado ($1) + * 2 sauzen ($0.25 x 2 = $0.50) = Total cost of additional ingredients and upgrades = $4.75 Finally, we need to subtract the amount of the gift card that Chad used at checkout: $4.75 - $5.00 = $0.25 So, Chad is still owing $0.25 for his meal.
"Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, then they will need to work together for x minutes to complete the puzzle. We know that Kalinda alone needs 360/4 = 90 minutes to complete the puzzle, so if she works with her mother, it will take them less time. Therefore, their total time needed to complete the puzzle is given by:
x = 90 - (Kalinda's time / 2)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 90 - (90 / 2) = 90 - 45 = 45 minutes
Therefore, Kalinda and her mother will need 45 minutes to complete the puzzle."
Response:  We know that initially there were 120 baby watermelons and after two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest, which is 36 watermelons (since 30% of 120 is 36). So Ashlyn took 36 watermelons with her from the farm. When she returned two weeks later, 75% of the remaining watermelons were ready to be harvested, which is 90 watermelons ( since 75% of 40 is 90). Therefore, there were 90 watermelons left that weren't yet ready to be harvested after two weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his business. Each car sells for $20,000. So, he spends a total of $240,000 (12 x $20,000) to buy all the cars.  Secondly, we are told that Mark pays 10% tax on each car, which means he pays $20,000 in taxes ($20,000 x 10%). Therefore, his total cost including taxes is now $260,000 ($240,000 + $20,000).  Lastly, we are also given that Mark has to pay an additional $1,000 for the registration of each car. Since there are 12 cars, he will have to pay a total of $12,000 for the registrations ($1,000 x 12). So, his final cost comes out to be $272,000 ($260,000 + $12,000).
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, who collected 20 shells. So, Kylie collected 25 shells (5 + 20).  On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday. If she collected 25 shells on Monday, then she collected 50 shells on Tuesday (2 x 25 = 50). Therefore, Kylie collected 75 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 mice in the garden and Dax found half as many insects as mice, then the number of insects is equal to half of 50, which is 25. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 25 + 50 = 75.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 36 penguins are sunbathing initially. Then, one-third of them (12) jump into the ocean to swim. Next, another third of them (12) go inside the cave to eat. So, how many penguins are left for sunbathing? Well, there are only 12 penguins left! Therefore, the correct answer is 12.
"Response: 
Steve wants to grow his own cherry tomatoes and decides to eat more tomatoes in general. He eats twice as much as his friend, which means he eats six tomatoes per day (2 x 6 = 12). Since one wine stem can produce three tomatoes per week, Steve needs how many wine stems to produce all the tomatoes he wants to eat?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes Steve wants to eat by the number of tomatoes each wine stem can produce per week:  Total number of tomatoes Steve wants to eat = 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes Per Week Number of tomatoes each wine stem can produce per week = 3 tomatoes So, Steve needs 42 / 3 = 14 wine stems to produce all the tomatoes he wants to eat."
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend will get 4 slices of pizza. Since pizzas are sold only in 8-portion pieces, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to buy: 20 / 8 = 5 pizzas. So, John needs to order 5 pizzas.
Response:  If he mixes five empty pens and gets one full pen of ink, then he will have 5/1 = 5 full penguins of ink.  Now, if he uses these 5 full penguins to make new pens, he will get 5 x 5 = 25 new pens. Therefore, the final answer is 25 penguins.
Response:  First, we know that Johnny started with $20 and added another $10 to it, so he had a total of $30 at first. Then, after one year, his investment grew three times bigger than before, which means it became $90 ($30 x 3). So, after one year, Johnny had $90 + $30 = $120.
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Joan is five years older than Mary.  And we also know that Jessa is 20 years old. So, if we want to find out the sum of their ages, we can use the following equation:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 5
Joan's age = Mary's age + 5
Jessa's age = 20
Now let's substitute these equations into each other and solve for the sum of their ages:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 5
Joan's age = Mary's age + 5
Substituting Mary's age from the first equation:
Joan's age = 35 (since Mary is two years younger than Joan)
Substituting Joan's age from the second equation:
Mary's age = 35 + 5
Mary's age = 40
So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 40 + 35 + 20 = 95 years."
Response:  Firstly, we know that 70% of the students left through exit A (30% x 1000 = 300). Then, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B (70% - 30% = 400), and finally, the remaining 200 students left through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is 200. So, the answer is 200.
Response:  We know that James has six more snoopies than Robert. So if Robert has x snoopies, then James has x +6 = 12 snoopies.  Now we are told that John has twice as many snoopies as Robert. So if Robert has x snoopies, then John has 2x snoopies.  Finally, we are told that John has 54 snoopies in total. So we can set up the equation: 2x = 54. Solving for x gives us x = 27. Therefore, James has 12 + 27 = 39 snoopies more than John.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they have read three books (Dolly + Pandora).  When they read each other's books, they will have read four books in total (3 + 1 = 4). Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many letters Mike receives from his five friends in total. Since each letter is two pages long and he receives two letters per week, that means he gets 10 letters per week (2 x 5 = 10). Now, let's calculate how much time it takes for Mike to write one page of text. According to the problem statement, he can write one page every six minutes, so it takes him 6/1 minute to write one page (1 page / 6 min = 0.17 minutes per page). Therefore, the number of hours Mike spends writing letters per week is equal to the number of letters he receives divided by the time it takes him to write one page, which is 10 letters / 0.17 minutes per page = 59.43 hours per week.
Response:  We know that Jason has a monthly plan of 1000 minutes and he uses 15 minutes each day for his boss. So far, he has used 15 x 30 = 450 minutes. Now we are told that he had an additional 300 minutes with other people this month. Therefore, his total usage so far is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes. Since there are 30 days in this month, Jason still has 750 / 30 = 25 minutes left for the rest of the month.
Response:  We know that Griffin started with 24 fries and gave some to Ginger. So let's call the number of fries Ginger got x. Then we know that Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left. Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so he took 10 fries (since 2 × 5 = 10). Now, Colby took 3 fewer fries than what Kyle took, so he took 7 fries (since 3 < 10). Finally, Ginger gave Griffin back some fries, but we don't know how many. Let's assume it was half of the original amount she took, or x/2 fries. Therefore, the total number of fries Griffin had after everything happened is: 19 + 10 - 7 + x/2 = 27. Solving for x/2, we get x = 12. So Ginger gave Griffin 12 fries back.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. If we call the number of fish in both aquariums ""F"", then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Number of snails in first aquarium = 4
Number of snails in second aquarium = 32 - 2( Number of fish in both aquariums)

Now, we need to find out how many fish are in both aquariums. The question states that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquaria is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let ""F"" be the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write:

Number of snails in first aquarium = 4
Number of snails in second aquarium = 32 - 2(F)

Substituting F = x, we get:

x = 32 - 2(x)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 16

So, there are 16 fish in both aquariums. Therefore, there are 8 fish in each aquarium (since 16 / 2 = 8)."
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate how much time Rekent spends on making up for each day of the five weeks of the film shoot. Since it takes her 6 hours to do her makeup every day, she will have spent a total of 30 hours (6 hours/day x 5 weeks) working on the film set during that period. Next, let's calculate how much money Rekent earns from this work. If she charges $250 per hour and works for 30 hours, then she has earned a total of $7,500 ($250/hour x 30 hours). Now, since the film lasts for five weeks, Rekent will have worked on the film for a total of 150 hours (5 weeks x 30 hours/week), which means she has earned $11,250 ($7,500 x 150 hours) in total from doing the film's makeup. Finally, since Jean gives Rekent a 10% discount at the end of the project, Rekent will receive $9,875 ($11,250 x 90%) as payment for her services. Therefore, Jean has paid Rekent $9,875 for her makeup artistry services throughout the course of the film production.
Response:  We know that Isabella gave $12 for ingredients of the cake, and she shared it equally with her parents. So each parent paid half of this amount = $6. Then we know that Isabella spent $43 on birthday presents, which is also divided equally among her parents = $21.50 per person. Similarly, she spent $15 on decorations, which is also split equally between her parents = $7.50 per person. Finally, she spent $22 on party favors for the guests, which again is divided equally among her parents = $11 per person. Therefore, each of Isabella's parents paid $6 + $21.50 + $7.50 + $11 = $55 in total.
Response:  Firstly, let X be the total weight of all four bags of potatoes. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds, then X = 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Now, since each pound of potatoes costs $1.50, then the total cost of all four bags is equal to $1.50 per pound x 200 pounds = $300. Therefore, the chef has spent $300 on potatoes.
Response:  On Monday, Sue eats four times as many cookies as her sister. So if her sister eats x cookies, then Sue eats 4x cookies.  On Tuesday, Sue eats twice as many cookies as her sister. So if her sister eats x cookies, then Sue eats 2x cookies.  Now we know that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on the next day. Therefore, Sue ate 4(5) = 20 cookies on Monday and 2(13) = 26 cookies on Tuesday.  To find out how many calories Sue consumed more than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of calories in all the cookies she ate. If one cookie contains 200 calories, then the total number of calories in all the cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 calories. Since Sue ate more cookies than her sister, she consumed more calories. The difference between the number of calories Sue consumed and the number of calories her sister consumed is 46 - 18 = 28 calories.
