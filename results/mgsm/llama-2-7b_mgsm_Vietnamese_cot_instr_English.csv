"Response: 
Janet has 16 eggs per day and eats 3 for breakfast every morning. So she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left after breakfast each day.  She sells these remaining eggs at the farmer's market with a price of $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily income from selling eggs is 13 x $2 = $26."
"Response:  We have 2 green threads and half of white thread. So, we can make 3 equal parts using these threads. Each part will contain 1/3 of the total number of threads. Therefore, the total number of threads in all three parts is:

Green threads = 2 x 3 = 6
White threads = (1/2) x 3 = 1.5
Total threads = 6 + 1.5 = 7.5
So, there are 7.5 threads in the scarf."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh bought a house for $80,000 and then he spent $50,000 to renovate it. So, the total amount of money he invested in the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. Now, after renovation, the value of the house has increased by 150%, which means the new value of the house is $130,000 x 150% = $195,000. Therefore, Josh earned a profit of $65,000 ($195,000 - $130,000).
Response:  Firstly, we know that James decides to run three rounds of sprinting per week, which means he runs for a total distance of 3 x 60 = 180 meters per week. So, in one week, James runs a total distance of 180 meters.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Wendi feeds her flock of chickens three meals a day, consisting of 3 chunks of feed per bird. Each chunk contains wheat, soybeans, and vitamins. We also know that she gives them an additional 25 cups of food in the afternoon. Therefore, if Wendi has 20 chickens, she will need to provide a total of:

Meal 1 (breakfast): 3 chunks x 20 birds = 60 cups of food Meal 2 (lunch): 3 chunks x 20 birds = 60 cups of food Meal 3 (dinner): 3 chunks x 20 birds = 60 cups of food Total daily food consumption: 60 + 60 + 60 = 180 cups of food So, Wendi needs 180 cups of food for each day to keep her flock of 20 chickens healthy and happy!"
Response:  If we buy one lens for $5, then the cost of 2 lenses is $5 x 60% = $3. So if we buy 16 lenses, the total cost will be $3 + ($3 x 15) = $49. Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $49 for 16 lenses.
"Response:  We know that:
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston (so Toulouse has 2 x 16 = 32 sheep).
Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle (so Charleston has 4 x 8 = 32 sheep).
So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Toulouse has 32 + 32 = 64 sheep, and Charleston has 32 + 32 = 64 sheep too."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute. Therefore, to find out how long it will take to download a 200 GB file, we need to divide the size of the file (in GB) by the downloading speed (in GB/minute): Time = Size / Speed = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes. So, Carla needs to wait for approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes to complete the download.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John took 3 hours to reach his destination with a speed of 60 miles per hour. Therefore, he traveled for 3 x 60 = 180 miles in total during this time.  After realizing that he had forgotten something important at home, John turned back and started his journey again. This time, he spent 2 hours traveling at a speed of 30 miles per hour, which means he covered a distance of 2 x 30 = 60 miles.  Finally, he traveled the remaining distance of 4 - 60 = 340 miles at a speed of 80 miles per hour, taking him 4 / 80 = 1/20 of the total time to cover this distance. So, after 4 hours, John reached his destination.
Response:  If Eliza works for 40 hours in the first week and her hourly wage is $10, then she earns $400 ($10 x 40) in that week. Since she also gets overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, her total earnings for the week would be: $400 + (1.2 x $400) = $640. So, if Eliza works for 45 hours in the first week, her total earnings would be $640.
Response:  In month 1, there are 60 downloads.  In month 2, there are 3 times as many downloads (60 x 3 = 180).  In month 3, there are 30% fewer downloads than in month 2 (180 - 30 = 135).  Therefore, the total number of downloads over the 3 months is 60 + 180 + 135 = 475.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toula bought 3 dozen donuts (3 x 68 = 204), 2 dozen cupcakes (2 x 80 = 160), and 6 dozen cheesecakes (6 x 55 = 330). Therefore, the total cost of all the pastries is:  Total Cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 dollars.
Response:  First year:  $90 for planting + $3 = $93 Total cost in first year Second year: $93 x 2 = $186 Total cost in second year Third year: $186 x 2 = $372 Total cost in third year Fourth year: $372 x 2 = $744 Total cost in fourth year Fifth year: $744 x 2 = $1488 Total cost in fifth year Sixth year: $1488 x 2 = $2976 Total cost in sixth year Seventh year: $2976 x 2 = $5952 Total cost in seventh year Eighth year: $5952 x 2 = $11,904 Total cost in eighth year Ninth year: $11,904 x 2 = $23,808 Total cost in ninth year Tenth year: $23,808 x 2 = $47,616 Total cost in tenth year Anh ta sẽ bắt đầu kiếm tiền từ cây chanh sau 10 năm.
Response:  We know that Melanie has sold 3/4 of her vacuum cleaners at home green, 2 each to houses red and yellow, and half of the remaining ones are in house orange. So, if she still has 5 vacuum cleaners left, then she must have started with 5 x (3/4) = 3 1/3 vacuum cleaners initially.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students in the class, 20% are contemporary dancers, which means they make up 4 students (20/100 x 4 = 4). Similarly, we can calculate the number of jazz and hip-hop dancers as follows:  Jazz dancers: 25% of the remaining students - 3 students (25/100 x (20 - 4) = 3). Hip-hop dancers: The remaining students - 6 students (100 - (4 + 3)) = 6. Therefore, there are 4 + 3 + 6 = 13 students who dance hip-hop. So, the percentage of students who dance hip-hop is 13/20 or 65%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the present value of each option using the given information. The formula for calculating the present value is as follows: PV = F / (1 + r)^n Where: PV = Present Value F = Future value at time T r = Discount rate (annual interest rate) n = Number of years until payment is made In this case, let's assume that the discount rate (r) is 0.06 (which represents an annual interest rate of 6%) and the time period until payment is made is one year (n=1). Now, let's apply these values to each option: Option A: Jewelry Costing $5,000 Future value = $5,000 x (1 + 0.06)^1 = $5,300 Present value = $5,300 / $5,000 = 0.76 Option B: Electronics Costing $8,000 Future value = $8,000 x (1 + 0.06)^1 = $8,432 Present value = $8,432 / $8,000 = 1.06 Now, based on the above calculations, if the investor wants to maximize their profit at the end of the year, they should choose Option A because it has a higher present value. Therefore, the correct answer is: Option A - $5,300
Response:  On day one, both ships started from San Rafael and traveled west for 80 miles. Then they turned north and covered 150 miles. So in total, each ship traveled 230 miles (80 + 150) during two days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jill is paid $20 per hour for teaching and $30 per hour for choreography.  Secondly, she works 50 weeks in a year as a teacher and 15 weeks as a choreographer. Thirdly, her total hours worked are 35 hours/week x 50 weeks = 1750 hours/year as a teacher and 15 hours/week x 15 weeks = 225 hours/year as a choreographer. Fourthly, we need to calculate her annual salary based on these hours. For teaching, her annual salary would be $20/hour x 1750 hours/year = $35,000. For choreography, her annual salary would be $30/hour x 225 hours/year = $6,750. Therefore, Jill's total annual salary is $41,750 ($35,000 + $6,750).
Response:  If Claire makes 3 eggs per day for breakfast, then she will make a total of 21 eggs in one week (7 days). Therefore, if she continues to do this for 4 weeks, she will have made a total of 84 eggs (21 x 4 = 84) during that time.
Response:  We know that Marissa has already walked for 4 miles in the first hour, so she has covered a total distance of 4 + 2 = 6 miles in the first two hours. To find out how long it will take her to cover the remaining distance of 12 - 6 = 6 miles, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed, where time is the time taken to cover the remaining distance, and speed is the average speed at which Marissa is walking. Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we can set up the equation: 6 = distance / 4. Solving for distance, we get: distance = 6 x 4 = 24 miles. Therefore, Marissa needs to walk for approximately 24 miles to reach her destination.
Response:  We know that initially, there are 10 liters of water with 2/3 being water and 7 liters of fruit juice (which is also 3/5 water). When we add the two mixtures together, we get: Water + Fruit Juice = 10 + 7 = 17 liters. Now, when we pour in another liter of water from the remaining 24 liters, we have: Water + Fruit Juice + New Water = 17 + 1 = 18 liters. Therefore, there are 18 liters of liquid left over after adding the new water.
Response:  We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so he is currently 37 years old (Samantha - 6 = Raymond). Since Raymond has a son who is 23 years old, his son must have been born when Raymond was 14 years old (23 - 14 = x). Therefore, Samantha's son was born 17 years ago (x + 6 = 31).
Response:  We know that there are 8 customers in total and they buy as follows:  The first three customers each buy one DVD, so they buy 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 DVDs.  The next two customers each buy 2 DVDs, so they buy 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.  Finally, the last three customers do not buy any DVDs, so they buy 0 DVDs. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy is 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.
Response:  The candle is melting at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So, if we start burning it from 1 pm to 5 pm (a total time of 4 hours), how much will it have melted after those 4 hours?  We can calculate this as follows: Time = 4 hours Melting Rate = 2 cm/hour Therefore, the distance the candle will have melted after 4 hours is: Distance = Time x Melting Rate = 4 hours x 2 cm/hour = 8 cm After 4 hours, the candle will have melted 8 cm.
Response:  We know that the original price of the book was $29.50 (since it is now being sold for $19.50 with a discount of 25%). So we can set up an equation as follows:  Book original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)  In this case, the discount percentage is 25%, which means we need to subtract 25% of the original price from the original price to get the discounted price. Therefore, we have:  Book original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)  Simplifying and solving for the original price, we get:  Book original price = $38.75  So the original price of the book before the discount was $38.75.
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of these items. So, we can write an equation based on this information:  Total cost = Price of chicken + Price of milk + Price of apples + Price of pizza  Total cost = $12 + $3 + $1.50 + (x x$8.50) Where ""x"" represents the number of pizzas Marie bought. Now we are given that Marie spent $50 in total, so we can set up another equation: $12 + $3 + $1.50 + (x x$8.50) = $50 To solve for ""x"", we can first subtract $12 from both sides of the second equation to get rid of the $12 term: $3 + $1.50 + (x x$8.50) = $38 Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by $8.50 to find out how many pizzas Marie bought: x = 4 Therefore, Marie bought 4 pizzes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mishka has purchased three pairs of shorts and three pairs of pants. The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50, and the cost of one pair of pants is $22.50. Therefore, the total cost of all three pairs of shorts = $16.50 x 3 = $49.50. Similarly, the total cost of all three pairs of pants = $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. Now, let's add up the costs of both categories to find out how much Mishka spent in total: Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants = $49.50 + $67.50 = $117.00. So, Mishka spent a total of $117.00 for all three pairs of shorts and pants.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every night. So, in total, she will eat 30 portions (60 days / 2 portions per day). Now, let's calculate how much money she spends on buying ice cream. Since each thùng costs $4.00 and there are 15 portions in each thùng, the cost of one portion is $4.00 / 15 = $0.27 per portion. Therefore, the total amount Cynthia spends on buying ice cream is 30 portions x $0.27 per portion = $8.10.
Response:  We know that Henry stopped twice during his bike ride of 60 miles. The first time he stopped was after 20 miles and the second time was 15 miles before finishing the trip. So, we can write down the distance traveled between each stop as follows: Distance = 60 - 20 = 40 miles (between stops 1 and 2) Now, let's find out how many miles Henry rode between the two stops: Total distance = Distance + (Distance between stops) Total distance = 40 + (40 / 2) Total distance = 80 miles Therefore, Henry rode 80 miles between the two points where he stopped.
Response:  If Gloria chooses the high-heeled shoes with a price of $33, then she will have to pay an additional amount for the second pair of shoes that costs twice as much as the first pair. Therefore, the total cost of both pairs of shoes would be: High-heeled shoes: $33 x 2 = $66 Low-heeled shoes: $17 x 2 = $34 So, the total cost of both pairs of shoes is $66 + $34 = $90.
Response:  We know that Darrell is 7 years older than Allen. So, if Allen is x years old, then Darrel lis 7 + x years old.  The sum of their ages is given as 162 years. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 162... (1) Now, we are also told that Allen is 10 years younger than Darrell. So, we can write an additional equation: x - 10 = 7... (2) Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: 7 + (x - 10) = 162... (3) Simplifying equation (3), we get: 7x = 152... (4) Dividing both sides of equation (4) by 7, we get: x = 21... (5) Therefore, the age of Allen is 21 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 people in total (Gunter, the first person and the second person). So, if Gunter said there were 80 beans in the bowl, then the sum of their answers is 80 + 16 = 96. Now, the third person says that there are 20 more beans than the first two people combined. Therefore, the total number of beans in the bowl is 96 + 20 = 116. Finally, one-third of the total number of beans is equal to 116 / 3 = 38. So, the average number of beans in the bowl is 38.
Response:  Since each dog spends 0.5 hours per day for exercise and work, in one week there are 7 days (Monday to Sunday). So, the total time spent by John caring for the dogs in one week is:  0.5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 3.5 hours/week.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 dong xu and 30 of them are gold coins. So, we can say that Gretchen has 30/110 = 27% of her money in gold coins. Therefore, Gretchen has 110 - (27% \* 110) = 83% of her money in silver coins.  So, Gretchen has 83/100 = 830 dong xu in silver coins.
"Response:  We know that Siobhan has fewer than 2 stones than Aaron. So if Aaron has x stones, Siobhan has x - 2 stones.  We also know that Aaron has more than half of Raymond's stones. So if Raymond has y stones, Aaron has at least y / 2 stones.  Now we can set up an equation based on these constraints:
x - 2 = y/2... (1)
We are also given that Siobhan has 40 stones in total. So we can add this constraint to our equation:
x + 2 = 40... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for x and y?"
Response:  In the first 20 minutes (or 400 seconds), Mike scored 4 points. Therefore, his rate of scoring is 4/400 = 0.01 points per second.  During the next 20 minutes, he scored additional 25% of the remaining time, which is equal to 20 x 0.25 = 5 points. So, in total, Mike scored 4 + 5 = 9 points.
Response:  Terry consumes 2 cups of yogurt per day and there are 4 types of yogurt available at $5 each. Therefore, Terry spends $10 per day on yogurt ($5 x 2 cups). To find out how much he spends in total over 30 days, we can multiply the daily cost by 30: $10 x 30 = $300. So, Terry spends $300 on yogurt over 30 days.
Response:  Firstly, John sold all his Lego sets and got $195 (13 x $15). Then he used that money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, so he spent $160 ($20 x 8). Now let's see how much money is left after buying the video games. $195 - $160 = $35. So John has $35 left after buying the video games. Therefore, he still has 13 Lego sets.
Response:  First day (3 hours): Distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/week x 3 h = 300 km Second day (half a day): Distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/week x (3/2) h = 150 km Total distance covered in two days = 300 + 150 = 450 km So, John covers 450 km in two days.
"Response:  If Dana can run at a speed of four times her walking speed and jump with half that speed, we know she can cover a distance of 3 miles per hour while jumping.  Therefore, if she spends two-thirds of her time running and one-third of her time jumping, she will be able to cover a total distance of:

Running time = 2/3 \* 6 hours = 4 hours
Jumping time = 1/3 \* 6 hours = 2 hours
Total distance covered = Running distance + Jumping distance
= 4 hours x 4 miles/hour + 2 hours x 3 miles/hour
= 16 miles + 6 miles
= 22 miles
Therefore, Dana can cover a distance of approximately 22 miles in six hours if she spends two-thirds of her time running and one-third of her time jumping."
Response:  We know that iPhone of Ben is twice as old as iPhone of Suzy. So, if Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, then Ben's iPhone will be 2 years older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, Ben's iPhone is 3 years old (2 x 1 = 3). Now we have to find out how many times older Brandon's iPhone is compared to Ben's iPhone. Since Brandon's iPhone is 4 times older than Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 x 3 = 12 years old.
"Response:  First, we know that when Polly throws the golden apple without using any special stones or powers, she can hit the dragon at most 400 feet away from her due to the range of the dragon's flame.  Next, we learn that if Polly has the Sapphire Stone, she can throw the golden apple farther than three times its original distance. So, with the Sapphire Stone, Polly can hit the dragon at most 1200 feet (3 \* 400) away from her.  Finally, we are told that if Polly has the Emerald Stone, she can stand at an unspecified distance from the dragon and still hit it with the golden apple. However, we don't know exactly how far this distance is, as the question only states that it is ""farther"" than the previous distances given. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numerical answer for this part of the question."
Response:  We know that Bà Jones has prepared 5 pies for lunch and cut them into 8 pieces. She then placed 5 pieces on the table for guests to serve themselves. After all the guests have taken their share of pie, there are 14 remaining pieces left over (5 original + 5 served). Therefore, the number of pieces of pie that each guest took is equal to 14 - 5 = 9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one serving of fried potatoes contains 250 calories. If there are 5 servings in a bag of 300 grams, then each serving would contain 250/5 = 50 calories. Now, if our daily calorie goal is 2000 calories and we have already consumed 1800 calories, then we still have 200 calories left to consume from other sources. Therefore, the number of grams of fried potatoes that can be safely eaten based on this information is 200 / 50 = 4 grams.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie can make 10 candles with each pound of honey. So if he buys one pound of honey for $10.00 and makes 10 candles with it, then the total revenue from those 10 candles is:  Revenue = Number of candles x Price per candle = 10 x $2.00 = $20.00  Now let's assume that Charlie wants to sell these 20 candles at a price of $2.00 per candle. Then his total revenue from selling all 20 candles will be:  Total revenue = Number of candles x Price per candle = 20 x $2.00 = $40.00  Therefore, the profit (or loss) made by Charlie after buying and selling the 20 candles is: Profit = Total revenue - Cost = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00
Response:  On Monday and Thursday, Meredith spends an average of 4 hours writing each article. Therefore, she spent 8 hours (4 hours x 2 days) writing articles in those two days.  On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Monday and Thursday, so she spent 16 hours writing articles that day (8 hours x 2). In total, Meredith spent 24 hours writing articles over the three-day period.
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 notes in her bag before she left for work and then bought a pack of Post-its containing 10 sheets with 220 stickies each (for a total of 2200 stickies). So, if she still has 23 notes after using some of them at work, we can calculate the number of remaining stickies as follows: Number of remaining stickies = Total number of stickies - Number of used stickies = 2200 - 23 = 2177 stickies. Therefore, Candice bought 2177 Post-its.
Response:  If John bought twice as many red scarves as blue scarves and each red scarf costs $1 more than each blue scarf, then we can write an equation based on this information:  Red Scarf Cost = Blue Scarf Cost + $1  So if John spent $200 on red scarves, we can find out how much he spent on each red scarf using the above equation:  Red Scarf Cost = $40 (blue scarf cost) + $1 = $41 per red scarf  Therefore, John spent a total of $820 ($41 x 200) on both red and blue scarves.
Response:  We know that the length of the rope is 4 feet = 48 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot). Now we need to find out how many pieces of 6-inch long rope can be cut from this longer piece. To do this, we divide the total length of the rope (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches): 48 / 6 = 8 pieces. So, Tracy has 8 pieces of 6-inch long rope.
"Response:  Since there are 15 tầng in total and each tầng has 8 căn hộ, then the total number of apartments is:

15 x 8 = 120

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building (or 30%) are occupied, so the number of vacant apartments can be calculated as follows:

120 - (30% x 120) = 120 - 36 = 84

Therefore, there are 84 vacant apartments in the building."
"Response:  If Lloyd has 252 quails per day and he sells each egg for $2, then his total daily revenue from eggs is:
$2 x 252 = $504 per day
So, Lloyd earns $504 per day from selling eggs."
"Response: 
Tom left at 1 pm and traveled for 3 hours with a speed of 10 miles per hour. Therefore, he covered a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles.
Then, he turned around and returned with a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to return, we can divide the distance he traveled during his return trip (which is equal to half the total distance traveled) by his return speed:
Time taken for return journey = Distance / Speed = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.
Therefore, Tom will take 5 hours to return."
"Response:  If each comic book weighs $1/4$ pounds and Uriah has $30$ comics, then the total weight of his comics is:
$$\text{Total weight of comics} = 30 \times 1/4 = 10$$ pounds. $$ \therefore \text{Uriah needs to reduce } 10 - 5 = 5$$ pounds."
Response:  On Monday, the mechanic repaired 6 tires and 4 wheels, so he earned $60 + $40 = $100 in total.  On Tuesday, he repaired 12 cars but did not repair any tires, so he earned $0.  On Wednesday, he repaired 8 cars and 2 tires, so he earned $80 + $20 = $100 in total.  On Thursday, he repaired 4 cars and 2 tires, so he earned $40 + $20 = $60 in total.  On Friday, he repaired 6 cars and 2 tires, so he earned $60 + $20 = $80 in total.  Therefore, the total amount of money the mechanic earned during the week is $100 + $100 + $60 + $80 + $40 = $560.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that there are two adult cats (Patchy and Trixie) who have had three litters of kittens each, for a total of six kittens between them. Additionally, their owner has just received seven new kittens from a local animal shelter. Therefore, the total number of kittens in the Doubtfire family is:  6 + 7 = 13 kittens.
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 pieces of chocolate and he eats 2 pieces. So there are 30 - 2 = 28 remaining pieces of chocolate. To pack these into boxes, we need to divide them equally among 2 boxes. Therefore, each box will contain 28 / 2 = 14 pieces of chocolate. So Jean can fill up 14 tins with his remaining chocolates.
"Response:  If Peter has $42 per week and he spends $7 on each movie ticket, then he can afford to go see movies for:
$42 / $7 = 6 times
So, Peter can go see movies 6 times in one week."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the maximum weight of cargo that can be carried by the bridge is 5000 pounds (since it cannot carry more than this amount). Secondly, we are given that each box has a weight of 15 pounds. Thirdly, we are told that there are as many boxes as possible will fit in the truck, which means that the total weight of all the boxes must not exceed the capacity of the truck. Finally, we are informed that the driver and the truck together weigh 3755 pounds, leaving us with the following equation to solve for the number of boxes that can fit in the truck without overloading the bridge: Number of boxes = Capacity of truck - Weight of driver and truck / Weight of one box  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of boxes = 5000 - (3755 / 15) = 2666.67 boxes  Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can fit in the truck without overloading the bridge is approximately 2667 boxes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Stephen ordered online and paid $40 for his order. Then, the delivery fee was added to the total amount which is $125 (including taxes). Next, there was a $3 charge for shipping, making the new total cost of $128. Finally, Stephen gave a $4 tip, so the final price he paid for his food was $132 ($128 + $4). Therefore, the final price of Stephen's food after all calculations were made was $132.
Response:  We know that there are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, so the total number of fruits is 6 x 20 = 120. Additionally, there are 67 individual fruits scattered across the tree, for a total of 120 + 67 = 187 fruits. Therefore, there are 187 mangoes on the tree.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 quails in total and we want to find out how many of them are good (not bad or overripe). So, let's start counting:

* Bad: 1 quail = 25%
* Unripe: 20% of 25 quails = 5 quails
* Sour: 2 quails = 8%

Now, let's calculate the number of good quails:
Total number of good quails = Number of quails that are not bad nor unripe nor sour = 25 - 5 - 2 = 18 quails
Therefore, 18 quails are good (not bad or overripe)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Janet paid $500 for the material to make the ring and then she paid $800 for the craftsmanship of the ring. Therefore, the total amount she paid is $500 + $800 = $1300.  Next, we are asked about the percentage she paid as insurance. We know that it was 10%, so the amount she paid as insurance is $1300 x 10% = $130.  Therefore, the final amount Janet paid is $1300 - $130 = $1170.
Response:  If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000 after 20 years of service with a 5% increase in value each year, her annual pension will be:  After 20 years of service, Marcy's annual pension will be: $50,000 x (1 + 0.05) = $52,500 After 30 years of service, Marcy's annual pension will be: $52,500 x (1 + 0.05) = $55,625 Therefore, if Marcy retires after 30 years of service, her annual pension will be $55,625.
Response:  First half of the year (6 months): $140 x 2 = $280  Second half of the year (6 months): $140 x 0.9 = $126 Total amount paid for the service throughout the year: $280 + $126 = $406
Response:  Since Sophia has already traveled 160 km since she last filled up her gas tank and needs an additional 4 gallons of fuel to fill it up again, we can calculate how far she can travel with one gallon of fuel as follows: Distance = Total distance traveled / Amount of fuel left (in gallons) = 160 km / 4 gal = 40 miles Therefore, Sophia can travel approximately 40 miles with one gallon of fuel.
"Response: 
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to sleep and read for half an hour. He does this three times a week. So in one week, he will spend:

* 2 hours/day x 3 days/week = 6 hours/week on TV
* 0.5 hours/day x 3 days/week = 1.5 hours/week on reading

Therefore, Jim spends a total of 7.5 hours per week on TV and reading."
"Response:  For each school, we have:
1. Female basketball team (5 players) + Male basketball team (5 players) = Total number of athletes for that school (10).
2. Each school has sent one coach to train both teams. So, total number of coaches = Number of schools x Number of coaches per school = 4 x 1 = 4 coaches.
Therefore, in total, there are:
Total number of athletes = 4 schools x 10 athletes/school = 40 athletes.
Total number of coaches = 4 schools x 1 coach/school = 4 coaches."
"Response:  We know that there are 175 kim cương in total and less than 35 hồng ngọc kim cương. Also, we know that the number of ngọc lục bảo is twice the number of hồng ngọc. So, if we can find out how many hồng ngọc there are, we will be able to calculate the number of đá quý.  Therefore, let X be the number of hồng ngọc. Then, we have:

X + 175 = 2 \* (less than 35)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

X = 30

So, there are 30 hồng ngọc in the box. And since each hồng ngọc contains 4 viens of đá quý, the total number of đá quý in the box is:

30 x 4 = 120

Therefore, there are 120 viens of đá quý in the box."
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls and 5 boys in total. If each teacher has 5 students, then we need to find out how many teachers there are. So, if there are x teachers, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Girls = 60 Number of Boys = 5 Total number of Students = x Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Number of Girls = 60 Number of Boys = 5 Total number of Students = x Substituting these values, we get: x = 120 Therefore, there are 120 teachers in Dr. Wertz's school.
Response:  Bailey started with $X and received weekly assistance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, if she had accumulated $100, then we can write an equation as follows: X + (8 \* $5) = $100 Now, solve for $X: $X = $100 - ($8 \* $5) $X = $100 - $40 $X = $60 Therefore, Bailey started with $60.

Response:  If we have two recipes with different number of instructions each, and we want to know how many instructions Kelian needs to read in total to prepare both meals, then we can use the following formula: Total Instructions = Number of Instructions for Recipe 1 + Number of Instructions for Recipe 2. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total Instructions = 20 (for Recipe 1) + 40 (for Recipe 2). Simplifying, we get: Total Instructions = 60. Therefore, Kelian needs to read 60 instructions in total to prepare both meals.
"Response:  If Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 each and 23 pieces of cheesecake at $4 each, he will make a total of:

$3 x 43 = $132 from brownies
$4 x 23 = $92 from cheesecake
Total amount earned by Tommy = $132 + $92 = $224
Therefore, Tommy will earn $224 in total."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Sheila will pay for each phone over three months. Since she pays $150 per phone and there are 6 phones in total, her total payment for all phones is:
$150 x 6 = $900
Now, let's find out how much interest Sheila will pay over these three months. The interest rate is 2%, which means that for every $100, Sheila will pay $2 in interest. So, her total interest payment over three months is:
$2 x $900 = $180
Finally, we subtract the interest payment from the total amount paid to get the net amount Sheila has paid for each phone:
Net Amount = Total Amount - Interest Payment
= $900 - $180
= $720
Therefore, Sheila will pay $720 for each of the six phones over three months."
Response:  If Artie sells 12 chrysanthemums at $2.74 per pot, he will make $32.08 ($2.74 x 12).  If he sells 9 chrysanthemum pots at $1.87 each, he will make $16.53 ($1.87 x 9). And if he sells 17 chrysanthemum pots at $2.12 each, he will make $35.34 ($2.12 x 17). Therefore, in total, Artie will make $32.08 + $16.53 + $35.34 = $83.95.
"Response:  Since each level has half the area of the previous level, we can write:
Area of top level = Area of bottom level / 2
Substituting the given values, we get:
Area of top level = 16 m^2 / 2 = 8 m^2
Therefore, the average area of each level is 8 meters squared."
Response:  First year (0-11 months):  During this period, Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cốc of food per day for 180 days = 180 cốc. Total amount needed in first year = 180 cốc x $X/cốc = $180 X where X is the cost of one tube of dog food. Second year and beyond (>11 months old): After the first year, Cecilia only needs to feed her puppy 2 cốc of food per day until it dies or reaches adulthood = total amount needed after first year = 2 x 180 cốc = 360 cốc. So, total amount needed throughout its life = 360 cốc x $Y/cốc = $360 Y where Y is the cost of one tube of dog food after the first year. Therefore, if one tube of dog food costs $X, then Cecilia will use $X + $360Y dollars worth of dog food throughout her puppy's lifetime.
"Response:  If Raymond has half of Sarah's laundry (which is 200 pounds), and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David (which is 1600 pounds), then we can calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David as follows:
Raymond's laundry = Half of Sarah's laundry = 200 pounds
David's laundry = 4 times as much as Raymond's laundry = 4 x 200 = 800 pounds
So, the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
David's laundry - Raymond's laundry = 800 pounds - 200 pounds = 600 pounds"
Response:  If we buy 3 bunches of flowers for $2.50 each, then the total cost is $7.50 (3 x $2.50).  If we buy 2 bunches of flowers for $1 each, then the total cost is $2 (2 x $1). So, if we buy 18 bunches of flowers with a better price than $2.50 per bunch, we will save $6 ($7.50 - $2 = $6). Therefore, the correct answer is $6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John paid $100 for grooming his dog. If he becomes a new customer of the salon, they will give him a discount of 30%. So, the cost of grooming for John after becoming a new customer would be: $100 x (1 - 0.3) = $70. Therefore, the cost of grooming for John is $70.
Response:  If each girl has 1/6 of 24 liters of water, then there are 24 / 6 = 4 liters of water for each girl.  Now, if a boy takes 6 liters of water, then he will have 4 - 6 = -2 liters of water left. So, there are no liters of water left after the boy took 6 liters.
Response:  Firstly, Charlie has 10 stickers and buys 21 more from a shop in the shopping center. So, he now has 31 stickers (10 + 21). Then, he gives 9 stickers to his sister and uses 28 stickers to decorate a memorial. Therefore, Charlie has 31 - 9 = 22 stickers left.
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 40 kg (or 88 pounds). To find out how much heavier than Grace Alex is, we need to divide his weight by 4. So, if Alex weighs x pounds, then he is 4x times as heavy as Grace.  Substituting this into the equation for the maximum possible weight of both of them in pounds gives us:  x + 4(88) = 256  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  x = 176 pounds  Therefore, Alex weighs 176 pounds more than Grace.
Response:  We know that Dan has planted 3 cherry blossom trees and each tree bears 25 flowers. Since each flower has 8 petals, we have: Number of flowers = Total number of petals = 3 x 25 = 75 petals. Therefore, there are 75 gai in total.
"Response:  We know that the team has played 22 games and won more than 8 times. So, we can write an equation as follows: Won = Total games - Lost (Total games) x 100 / Lost Where ""Won"" is the number of wins, ""Total games"" is the total number of games played, and ""Lost"" is the number of losses. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Won = 22 - (22 x 100 / 8) = 22 - 275 = -253 Now, since the result is negative, it means that the team lost more games than they won. Therefore, the answer is (-253)."
Response:  Since Gene has been on vacation four times a year since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old, we can calculate how many pieces of cloth he has collected as follows:  Firstly, let's find out how many pieces of cloth Gene collects each time he goes on vacation:  According to the problem statement, each piece of cloth represents one year of his life, so Gene collects 4 pieces of cloth per year (one for each trip).  Therefore, Gene has collected 4 x 16 = 64 pieces of cloth in total over the course of his lifetime.
Response:  The first time it rang, it rang four times. On the second occasion, it rang three times longer than the first ringing. So if it took 4 seconds to ring the first time, and 3 x 4 = 12 seconds for the second time, then it will take 12 + 4 = 16 seconds to ring the third time. Therefore, there were 3 rings in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the company gives each employee $600 per month as salary. Then, according to the policy, for every year of service, the employees will receive a 10% increase in their initial salary. So if Sylvie has worked for 5 years in the company, her annual salary after 3 more years of service would be:  Initial salary = $600 x 1.1 (for 3 additional years) = $660 x 1.1 (for another 2 years) = $728 Sylvie's annual salary after working for 8 years in the company is therefore $728.
"Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 88,000 albums and Harald sold 8 times less than her. So, if Harald sold x albums, we can write an equation as follows:

Marilyn = 88,000... (1)
Harald = 0.88 \* Marilyn = 74,640... (2)

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving them simultaneously, we get:

x = 74,640 / 0.88 = 85,390... (3)
So, Harald sold 85,390 albums."
Response:  Since there are 16 guests invited to the party and each guest will receive 75 gift boxes, we need to calculate how many gift boxes Christina needs in total. Therefore, the calculation is as follows: Number of gift boxes needed = Total number of guests x Number of gift boxes per guest = 16 x 75 = 1,200 gift boxes. So, Christina needs 1,200 gift boxes for her party.
Response:  If one adult can eat 10 pounds of salad per person and there are 20 adults attending the picnic, then Ted needs to bring 20 x 10 = 200 pounds of salad for the adults alone.  Since each child can eat half as much as an adult (since they are smaller), Ted also needs to bring 20 x 5 = 100 pounds of salad for the children, bringing the total amount needed to 300 pounds.
Response:  We know that Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 2 = 6 pets.  Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 2 + 4 = 6 pets too. Therefore, the number of pets owned by the person whose name starts with C is 6.
Response:  We know that: * Amy is older than Jackson by 5 years. So, Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy. * Jackson is also younger than Corey by 2 years. So, Corey is 2 years older than Jackson. * James is 10 years old and younger than Corey by 1 year. So, Corey is 9 years older than James. Now we can calculate Jackson's age as follows: Age of Jackson = Age of Amy - (Age of Jackson relative to Amy) + (Age of James relative to Corey) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Age of Jackson = 5 + (-2) + 9 = 7 years old Therefore, Jackson is 7 years old.
Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds with his current diet, then he is running at a speed of $ \boxed{59.67} \text{ meters per second}$ (m/s).  Since Gerald improves his diet and increases his speed by 10%, we know that Gerald's new speed will be $ \boxed{65.67} \text{ meters per second}$ (m/s) after making these changes to his diet.  So if Lee runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, then Gerald can run 400 meters in $\boxed{34.67} \text{ seconds}$ ($ = \frac {38}{1 - 0.10} $), which is approximately $\boxed{35.14} \text{ seconds}$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are fewer cats than dogs in the neighborhood. If there are 12 cats for every dog, then the number of dogs is twice the number of cats. So, if there are 60 dogs, the number of cats would be 60 x 2 = 120. Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 60 + 120 = 180.
"Response:  We know that out of 200 students in class 5, 2/5 are male and 2/3 are female in the scout team. So, we can write this as:
Male = 2/5 = 4 (since there are 5 students)
Female = 2/3 = 6 (since there are 3 times more females than males)
Now, let's find out how many girls did not join the scout team:
Girls who didn't join = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the scout team
= 200 - 6
= 194
Therefore, there are 194 girls who did not join the scout team."
"Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and James slept for 2/3 of that (which is equal to 6 hours), then we can calculate how many hours Harry slept more than James as follows:

Harry slept for 9 hours - James slept for 6 hours = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 hours more than James."
"Response:  We know that each can of sauce contains three quarters of an ounce (or 3/4 oz) of sauce per quarter cup. So if we have 32 ounces of sauce in total, and each quarter cup is equal to 2 tablespoons or 8 fluid ounces, then we can calculate how many quarts of sauce are needed as follows:

Quarts = Fluid Ounces / Tablespoon
= 32 oz / 8 fl oz
= 4 quarts
Therefore, Freda used 4 quarts of cucumber for her sauce."
Response:  At first, there are 30 cars on the highway.  During the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, 10 cars pass through (since 10 cars can pass through in 15 minutes).  After that, for the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam, another 10 cars pass through (since 10 more cars can pass through in 15 minutes). Therefore, in total, 20 cars passed through during the entire time period (10 + 10 = 20).
Response:  If Mary received 18 new plants from her favorite nursery and she has 40 pots in her big house in the countryside, then she will have 18 x 40 = 720 plants in total. Since she wants to give one plant per pot to her friends and family, she will have 720 - (number of pots she will keep for herself) = number of plants she will give away. So, Mary will have 720 - x = number of plants she will give away, where x is the number of pots she will keep for herself. Therefore, Mary will have 720 - x plants in her nests.
Response:  The first person pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. If we assume that each person presses the doorbell once every 5 seconds (which is a reasonable assumption), then the time taken for the first person to press the doorbell 20 times is: Time = Number of presses / Pressing rate = 20 / 5 = 4 seconds. Now, let's consider how many times the second person pressed the doorbell. Since they pressed it more than the first person, their pressing rate must be lower than 5 seconds per press. So, if they pressed the doorbell x times, then their average pressing rate is: Average pressing rate = Total number of presses / Time taken = x / 4 = 2x. Similarly, the third person pressed the doorbell y times, so their average pressing rate is: Average pressing rate = Total number of presses / Time taken = y / 4 = 2y. Finally, the fourth person pressed the doorbell z times, so their average pressing rate is: Average pressing rate = Total number of presses / Time taken = z / 4 = 2z. Now, we know that the total number of times the doorbell was rung is equal to the product of all the average pressing rates: Total number of presses = (2x) × (2y) × (2z) = 8xyz. Therefore, the doorbell was rung 8xyz times.
"Response:  We know that Solo has to read 4 pages from the science book, 20 pages from the sociology book, 7 pages from the history book, and 8 pages from the geography book in total. If he reads 15 pages on Tuesday, then we can calculate how many pages he will read each day as follows:

Total number of pages = Total number of pages to be read / Number of days left to finish reading
= 15 + 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 60

Number of pages to be read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days left to finish reading
= 60 / 4 = 15 pages per day

Therefore, if Solo has 4 days left to finish reading all the books, he will read approximately 15 pages per day."
"Response: 
John drinks one glass of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So he drinks 3 glasses of water per day.
Since he also has one more glass before going to bed, that makes it 4 glasses of water per day.
Now, let's convert this to number of liters:
1 liter = 1000 milliliters
So, John drinks 4 x 1000 = 4000 milliliters of water per day.
To find out how many liters he drinks in a week, we can multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
4000 milliliters/day x 7 days/week = 28,000 milliliters/week
Finally, to convert this to liters, we divide by 1000:
28,000 milliliters/week / 1000 = 28 liters/week
Therefore, John drinks approximately 28 liters of water per week."
Response:  Firstly, we know that it takes 10 minutes for the fog to cover 3 miles of the city. Therefore, if the distance from the coast to the center of the city is x miles, then it will take x/5 hours for the fog to cover the entire city.  Since the distance from the coast to the center of the city is 42 miles, it will take 42/5 = 8.4 hours for the fog to cover the entire city.
Response:  Firstly, Poppy placed 300 pieces of the puzzle (since she put one-fourth of the remaining pieces). Then her mother placed another 400 pieces (since she put one-third of the remaining pieces). So in total, there are 700 pieces left to be placed. Therefore, the final number of pieces needed to complete the puzzle is 700 - 300 = 400.
Response:  If Cody eats 3 times as many bánh gấp as Amir, that means Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 bánh quy. So, together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 bánh quy.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out the volume of each box. The length, breadth and height of each box are given as 5 inches, 6 inches and 4 inches respectively. So, the volume of each box is: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 108 cubic inches. Now, we have three boxes, so the total volume of all the boxes is: Total Volume = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box = 108 cubic inches + 108 cubic inches + 108 cubic inches = 324 cubic inches. Finally, since the walls of the boxes are 1 inch thick, we subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume to get the net volume inside the boxes: Net Volume = Total Volume - Volume of walls = 324 cubic inches - (3 x 1 inch) = 324 cubic inches - 3 inches = 321 cubic inches. Therefore, the total volume inside the three boxes is 321 cubic inches.
Response:  On Monday and Wednesday, Frankie watches one hour of his favorite show each night. So he watched a total of 2 hours (2 x 1 = 2) on those days.  On Thursday, he watched three episodes of a 30-minute program, so he watched a total of 3 x 30 = 90 minutes.  On Friday, he finished his homework early and watched one hour and one 30-minute episode. So he watched a total of 1 + 30 = 31 minutes.  On Saturday, he stayed up late to finish his assignment, so he watched two hours (2 x 1 = 2). Therefore, Frankie watched a total of 2 + 31 + 2 = 55 minutes of television on Thursday.
Response:  Last year, Henry made 10 bánh quy for the local baking competition. This year, he wants to double his output and make 20 bánh quy in total. So, if he has already made 110 bánh quy this year (including the 5 that he accidentally dropped), then he must have made 90 more bánh quy than last year (110 - 10 = 90). Therefore, Henry made 90 bánh quy last year.
Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline at the local station and gets a discount of $ 20 per gallon, they will save $ 200 (10 gallons \* $ 20 per gallon). So their total cost for 10 gallons of gasoline would be $ 700 ($ 3 per gallon \* 10 gallons). Therefore, after receiving the reward money, they will have $ 500 left ($ 700 - $ 200).
Response:  If both Beatrice and Marcel eat all their respective fruits, then we can calculate the total number of fruit eaten as follows:  For Beatrice: Total length = 24 cups \* Total width = 2 cups = 48 units For Marcel: Total length = 14 cups \* Total width = 3 cups = 42 units Now, let's find the average number of fruits eaten per person: Average for Beatrice = Total number of fruits / Total area = 48 / 48 = 1 unit Average for Marcel = Total number of fruits / Total area = 42 / 42 = 1 unit Therefore, if both Beatrice and Marcel eat all their respective fruits, they will each eat one fruit on average.
Response:  We know that Julia's boat drifted away from her while she was on the lake and took 16 seconds to drift back to shore. Since there are 20 feet in each length of the boat, we can calculate how much water it displaced during its journey using the formula: Volume = Length x Width x Height. The volume of water displace is equal to twice the volume of water that flows into or out of an object as it moves through the water. In this case, since the boat moved upward, the volume of water that flowed into the boat is equal to half the volume of water that flowed out of the boat. So, if the boat displaces 2 cubic meters of water when it floats, then it must have displaced 3 cubic meters of water when it sank (since water always seeks its own level). Now let's convert all units to the same unit so we can compare them directly. To do this, we divide both volumes by 100 (since there are 100 liters in 1 cubic meter) : Volume of water displaced = 20 x 100 / 1000 = 200 liters Volume of water that flowed into/out of boat = 300 liters (since half of 300 liters equals 150 liters, which is equal to half of 200 liters) Now we can solve for the amount of water Julia's boat had when she reached the shore: Amount of water in boat = Volume of water displaced - Volume of water that flowed into/out of boat = 200 - 150 = 50 liters Therefore, Julia's boat had 50 liters of water when she reached the shore.
Response:  If there are 4 teachers sharing one whiteboard and each teacher uses it twice a day (for two lessons), then the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a day is 8 (4 teachers x 2 lessons per teacher).  To find out how many times the whiteboard will be cleaned in a day, we need to divide the total number of times it is used by 3, since each cleaning takes 3 passes with the eraser. So, the answer is 8 / 3 = 2.73...
"Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers per day and it takes 15 days for 5 flowers to bloom, then we can calculate the total number of flowers planted as follows:
Day 1: 2 flowers
Day 2-3: 4 flowers (2 x 2 = 4)
Day 4-6: 8 flowers (4 x 2 = 8)
Day 7-9: 16 flowers (8 x 2 = 16)
Day 10-12: 32 flowers (16 x 2 = 32)
Day 13-15: 64 flowers (32 x 2 = 64)
Total number of flowers planted = 64
Therefore, if 5 flowers do not bloom after 15 days, Ryan has planted a total of 64 flowers in his garden."
Response:  We know that the number of images that Jamal's phone can hold is 1800 times 6 = 10800 images.  Since each image can contain up to 50 birds, the total number of birds that can be seen in all the images taken by Jamal is 10800 x 50 = 540000 birds. Therefore, there are approximately 540000 birds visible in Jamal's picture of the ducks at the zoo.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has 10 pieces of 2x4 wood with each piece costing $10 per square foot. Therefore, the total cost of these pieces is:

$10/square foot \* 10 pieces = $100

Next, we know that Sasha also has 5 pieces of 4x4 wood with each piece costing $16 per square foot. Therefore, the total cost of these pieces is:

$16/square foot \* 5 pieces = $80

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both sets of wood:

Total revenue = Cost of 2x4 wood + Cost of 4x4 wood
= $100 + $80
= $180

Therefore, if Sasha sells all her wood, she will make a profit of $180."
"Response:  If Katy uses 7 parts of coffee for every 13 parts of water in her ratio, then she will use:

Coffee = 7 x 120 = 840 ml (of coffee)
Water = 13 x 120 = 1560 ml (of water)
So, Katy will use 840 ml of coffee and 1560 ml of water in total."
"Response:  If John has 2 pairs of shoes for each of his children (4 children in total), then he will have 8 pairs of shoes in total.  Each pair costs $60, so the total cost is:
$60 x 8 = $480
Therefore, John will pay $480 for all 8 pairs of shoes."
Response:  On day one, there are two containers with 5 cars inside each container, so total number of cars is 10 (2 x 5).  On the second day, many more containers arrive and we assume all of them contain 5 cars inside, so total number of cars becomes 30 (many x 5). Therefore, the answer is 30.
Response:  Four years ago, Adrien earned $36,000 and his salary increased by 30%. So, four years later, Adrien earns $47,200 ($36,000 x 1.3). Now, we need to find out how much more than Lylah Adrien earns now. According to the passage, Adrien earns 40% more than Lylah. Therefore, the difference between their salaries is $47,200 - $32,400 = $14,800.
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he uses 8 sheets of paper per month (2 x 4 = 8). Since there are 30 sheets of paper per roll, Miguel uses 1/4 of a roll of paper each month (30 / 4 = 7.5). So, he uses approximately 7.5 sheets of paper per month.
Response:  We know that Morisette has 5 apples and 8 oranges, for a total of 13 (5 + 8).  Kael has twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he has 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also has half as many oranges as Morisette, which means he has 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, in total, Morisette and Kael have 13 + 10 + 4 = 27 trái cây.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours.  On Tuesday, she slept for less than 2 hours (since she had to complete some tasks). So, her total sleep time on those two days is less than 10 hours.  Now, let's assume that in the remaining part of the week, Sadie sleeps an additional hour per day. Therefore, her total sleep time for the entire week is:  Total sleep time = 8 + (less than 2) + (less than 2) + (1) = 13 hours.
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 miles in 3 hours, then she runs at a rate of 10/3 = 3.33 miles per hour.  Then, if she runs for 4 additional hours at a rate of 5 miles per hour, she will cover a distance of 5 x 4 = 20 miles. Therefore, Rosie can run 20 + 10 = 30 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jennie started working at her mother's office, there were 60 letters that needed to be stamped and one letter had already been stamped. So, the number of letters left to be stamped is 59. Now, if we subtract the number of letters that have already been stamped (30) from the total number of letters left to be stamped (59), we get 29. Therefore, there are 29 letters in the stack when Jennie starts working.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia bought a new pack of nails (gói muỗng) which contains 5 nails (muỗng). Then, her husband also brought another pack of nails for her (which is not specified how many are in this pack). After using some of these nails to taste her soup, Julia has a total of 12 nails left. So, the number of nails in the pack that Julia bought is:  5 + x = 12 where x is the number of nails in the other pack. Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, there are 7 nails in the other pack that Julia's husband brought for her.
Response:  We know that Dylan bought 38 chicken wings and 6 fish sticks more than chicken wings. So, if he bought X chicken wings, then he bought X + 6 = 44 fish sticks. Therefore, Dylan bought 44 xúc xích cá (fish sticks).
Response:  After moving to a new school, Amy gained 20 more friends than Lily. So, Lily had 50 friends initially and Amy had 70 friends after gaining 20 more friends (50 + 20 = 70). Therefore, Lily and Amy have 70 friends together.
Response:  We know that one quả dưa hấu costs $3 times more than one ớt, so one quả dưa hấu costs $3 x 3 = $9. Similarly, we know that one quả cam costs $5 less than one quả dưa hấu, so one quả cam costs $9 - $5 = $4. Now, let's find out how much Dillon will spend in total if he buys 4 quả dưa hấu, 20 quả ớt, and 10 quả cam. The cost of 4 quả dưa hấu is $4 x 4 = $16. The cost of 20 quả ớt is $2 x 20 = $40. The cost of 10 quả cam is $4 x 10 = $40. Therefore, the total cost of all the fruits that Dillon wants to buy is $16 + $40 + $40 = $96.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the hospital sees 500 patients per day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent by the hospital in treating patients per day is:

Time = Number of patients / Average treatment time
= 500 / 24
= 20 hours (or 1336 minutes)

Now, let's calculate how much money the hospital earns from these visits:

Revenue = Total time spent by the hospital in treating patients x Price charged per hour
= 1336 minutes x $150/hour
= $190,400 per day

Finally, we need to subtract the cost of treating patients, which is $200 per hour times the number of hours spent treating patients per day:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $190,400 - ($200 x 1336 minutes)
= $87,680 per day

Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, the hospital earns $87,680 per day from treating patients."
Response:  We know that 60 workers were employed to play the game of love in the village of Santa at Nissa's general store. After some children vomited and left, 30 Tiens remained. Then, after another 10 Tiens left, there were only 20 Tiens remaining. Therefore, there are 20 Tiens left in the end.
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500.  In June, he spent $440 (60 dollars less than in May). So, the total cost of Joseph in two months is: $500 + $440 = $940.
Response:  Pam went on the roller coaster twice and then walked once, so she used 3 tickets in total that day (2 for the roller coaster + 1 for walking). Similarly, Fred went on the roller coaster 4 times and walked once, so he used 5 tickets in total that day (4 for the roller coaster + 1 for walking). Therefore, together they used 8 tickets that day (3 + 5 = 8).
Response:  On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as far as he walked on Monday. So, if he walked x miles on Monday, he walked 6x miles on Tuesday. Therefore, the total distance Walt walked from Monday to Tuesday is 41 miles. So, Walt walked 41 miles on Tuesday.
Response:  If Tom gets his car washed 4 times per month, then he will get it washed 4 x 12 = 48 times in a year.  Since each car wash costs $15, Tom will have to pay $15 x 48 = $720 in a year for all of his car washes. Therefore, the correct answer is $720.
"Response:  We know that Brian has 20 games and loses 5 before comparing with Bobby. So, Brian has 15 games left (20 - 5 = 15). Now, we need to find out how many games Bobby has. The question states that Bobby has fewer than 5 times as many games as Brian does. Therefore, if Bobby has x games, we can write an equation based on this information:

x < 5(15) = 75

Solving for x, we get:

x = 60

So, Bobby has 60 games."
Response:  We know that there are 27 golden eagles left in the world and two-thirds of them live in the Scottish Highlands. This means that the number of golden eagles living in Scotland is equal to 2/3 x 27 = 18. Since two-thirds of these eagles are females, we can conclude that the number of female golden eagles in Scotland is equal to 18 x 2/3 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 female golden eagles living in Scotland.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all items that Rory is buying from the bakery. The prices are given as follows: - Bánh kẹp (2 pieces) = $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 - Khoai tây chiên (2 pieces) = $1.50 x 2 = $3.00 - Bánh quy (2 pieces) = $1.00 x 2 = $2.00 Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 Now, let's find out how much Rory has to pay for shipping. According to the question, there is a 20% fee added to the total cost for shipping, which means we have to multiply the total cost by 1.20. So, the shipping cost = $20.00 x 1.20 = $24.00 Finally, we add the shipping cost and the total cost of items to get the grand total amount that Rory needs to pay. Grand total = $20.00 + $24.00 = $44.00 Therefore, the correct answer is $44.00
Response:  If Mark completed 75 questions in 7 hours for the first test and maintained the same pace of 5 questions per hour, then he took 75/5 = 15 hours to complete the test.  Since he had 8 hours today to complete the second test, he could not have completed more than 8 - 15 = 3 hours of the test. Therefore, Mark left behind 100 - 3 = 97 questions unanswered.
Response:  If there are 4 times as many red candies as blue candies, then for every 1 blue candy, there are 4 red candies. So if there are 12 blue candies, there are 48 red candies (since 4 x 12 = 48). Therefore, there are 48 red candies.
Response:  We know that out of 20 cars available for rent, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of automatic cars is 12/20 = 0.6. Now, we need to find the percentage of manual cars among the remaining cars (which are not automatic). The number of non-automatic cars is 20 - 12 = 8. Therefore, the percentage of manual cars is 4/8 = 0.5 or 50%.
"Response:  We know that there are 700 ants in total and that there are twice as many worker ants as queen ants. Therefore, if we have x worker ants, then we also have 2x queen ants. Since there are twice as many queen ants as worker ants, we can write:

x = 2x

Now, we know that the number of worker ants is equal to half the total number of ants, so we can write:

x/2 = 700

Solving for x, we get:

x = 350

Therefore, there are 350 worker ants in the colony."
Response:  If Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games per day and earns $10 per hour working as a timekeeper, then he will have spent a total of 14 hours (2 hours/day x 7 days/week) playing video games in a week. Therefore, if he had not worked as a timekeeper during that week, he would have earned $140 from his job ($10/hour x 14 hours). So, in one week, Jordan will have earned $150 ($140 from his job + $10 from playing video games).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John bought some milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, and fishing gear for $4. So, the total cost of these items is:
$2 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $16
Now, there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, so the tax amount is:
$16 x 10% = $1.60
So, the final cost of the items including tax is:
$16 + $1.60 = $17.60"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucas has 3 customers and each customer needs 2 bottles of cleaning solution and one set of cloths for cleaning. So, the total number of products required from these 3 customers is 6 (2 x 3 = 6).  Next, we are told that each bottle of cleaning solution costs $2 and each set of cloths costs $5. Therefore, the total cost incurred by Lucas for these 3 customers is $12 (6 x $2 = $12).  Now, let's move on to the next part of the question where it says ""Lucas is talking to 5 potential customers."" We don't have any information about how many products each of these potential customers will require, so we cannot calculate their share of profit yet. However, since there are 5 potential customers, the total number of products they may require can be estimated as follows:  For each potential customer, assume an average requirement of 2 bottles of cleaning solution and 1 set of cloths. This gives us a total estimate of 10 (5 x 2 = 10) products required from these potential customers.  The total cost incurred by Lucas for these potential customers can be calculated similarly as before: $10 x ($2 per bottle + $5 per set of cloths) = $80.  Finally, we add up the total cost incurred by Lucas for all his customers (both actual and potential): $12 (from actual customers) + $80 (from potential customers) = $92.  Therefore, the profit earned by Lucas every week is $92 - $12 = $80."
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land with 100 quails per hectare. Therefore, he has a total of 1000 quails (10 hectares x 100 quails/hectare). Since John can harvest his durians every 3 months, we will divide the total number of quails by 3 to get the number of quails he can harvest in one year. So, John can harvest 333 quails in one year (1000 quails / 3 = 333 quails).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 500 pieces of Legos left on the floor after Johnny picked up some toys. Then, we have another box with three times as many pieces as the first one, which means it has 1500 pieces (3 x 500 = 1500). Finally, we have a third box with 1/4 of the total number of pieces, which is 1250 pieces (1/4 x 1500 = 1250). Therefore, in total, Johnny will have 500 + 1500 + 1250 = 3250 pieces of Legos if he can collect them all.
Response:  We know that in the first 6 hours of the day, 30 ants left the nest and then half of them returned within the next 6 hours. So, after 6 hours, there will be twice as many ants outside the nest compared to when they first left (since half of them returned). Therefore, at the end of the day, there will be 60 ants outside the nest (twice the original number).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brittany and her mother paid $12 for adult admission and $10 for child admission, so they spent a total of $22. Then, we are told that Brittany's mother received $8 in cash, which means she gave $14 to the ticket seller ($22 - $8). Therefore, the amount of money that Brittany's mother gave to the ticket seller is $14.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, which means he has 3 x 7 = 21 friends.  James also has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so he has 4 x 7 = 28 friends. Therefore, James has 28 - 21 = 7 more friends than Charlie.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve lives farther away from school than Tim does, so he will take longer to get there. Specifically, Steve takes 3 miles to reach school, while Tim takes only 2 miles. Therefore, if they both start at the same time, Steve will arrive later than Tim. Now let's consider their speeds. We know that Steve can ride his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute, and Tim can skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To determine who will arrive first, we need to calculate how long it will take each of them to cover the distance between their homes and school. For Steve, this distance is 3 miles, which he can cover in 3/4 \* 440 = 318 feet per minute. Similarly, for Tim, this distance is 2 miles, which he can cover in 2/3 \* 264 = 175 feet per minute. Since Tim is faster than Steve, he will arrive at school before Steve does. In fact, Tim will arrive after 175 / 318 = 0.55 minutes (or 33 seconds) after starting, while Steve will arrive after 318 / 440 = 0.72 minutes (or 44 seconds) after starting. So the answer is Tim will arrive at school before Steve does.
Response:  On day one, there were 5 people who filled up both tires with air. So, they paid $125 for filling up two tires ($25 per tire \* 5 people).  Then, there were 3 people who filled up their single-wheeled bike tires. They paid $75 for filling up one tire ($25 per tire \* 3 people). Finally, there was one person who rode a unicycle and did not need to fill up any tires. Therefore, the total amount of money earned that day is: $125 + $75 = $190.
Response:  If Carl buys 10 packs of bánh quy and each pack contains 6 bánh quy, then he will buy 60 bánh quy in total (10 x 6 = 60). Since each bánh quy costs $0.10, the total cost for all 60 bánh quy is $6 (60 x $0.10 = $6). So if Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will receive $4 left over ($10 - $6 = $4).
Response:  When Dave bought the bag of fried wontons, he had 14 before the seagull stole one from him. After that, three crows took turns eating three wontons each, leaving five remaining. Then, a bear took two-thirds of the remaining wontons, leaving one behind. Finally, a squirrel carried off the last won ton, leaving none for Dave. Therefore, there were originally 14 + (3 x 3) + (1/3) = 19 fried wontons in the bag when Dave bought it.
Response:  On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Kimo has three classes of one hour each, so he spends 3 hours/day x 5 days = 15 hours per week on those days.  On Tuesday and Thursday, Kimo has two classes of two hours each, so he spends 4 hours/day x 3 days = 12 hours per week on those days. Therefore, in total, Kimo spends 15 + 12 = 27 hours per week attending classes. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 27 hours/week x 16 weeks = 432 hours per semester attending classes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bill makes 300 bread rolls per day. Each bread roll is 4 inches long, so there are 300 x 4 = 1200 inches of bread rolls per day. Next, we know that he also makes 120 croissants per day, and each croissant is 6 inches long, so there are 120 x 6 = 720 inches of croissants per day. Finally, we know that he makes 60 baguettes per day, and each baguette is 2 feet long, so there are 60 x 2 = 120 inches of baguettes per day. Therefore, the total length of all the bread products made by Bill per day is 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches.
"Response:  We know that there are three types of monkeys in the zoo: gibbons (200 apples per month), orangs (400 apples per month), and mandrills (100 apples per month). To determine how many apples each type of monkey needs for two months, we can multiply their individual apple requirements by 2:
Gibbons: 200 x 2 = 400 apples
Orangs: 400 x 2 = 800 apples
Mandrills: 100 x 2 = 200 apples
So, to provide enough apples for all three types of monkeys for two months, the farmer would need to order:
400 + 800 + 200 = 1,200 apples
Therefore, the farmer needs to order 1,200 apples every two months to keep all the monkeys in the zoo fed."
Response:  Blake ran back and forth 15 times, which means he covered a distance of 100 meters / 2 = 50 meters per run. Since he made 15 runs, his total distance covered is 50 meters x 15 = 750 meters.  On the other hand, Kelly ran from the starting point to the 40-yard line (which is approximately 30 meters) and then returned to the starting point, covering a total distance of 30 meters + 30 meters = 60 meters. Therefore, Kelly covered a shorter distance than Blake. The difference in their distances is: 750 meters - 60 meters = 690 meters. So, Blake won this race by covering a distance of 690 meters more than Kelly.
Response:  Firstly, Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, so he paid $6 for them (4 x $1.5 = $6). Secondly, he bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so he paid $8 for them (2 x $4 = $8). Finally, he bought a folder at $20, so he paid $20 for it ($20). Therefore, in total, Raphael paid $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  We know that Finn saw 11 ducks swimming in the pond initially. Then he noticed 6 ducks hiding underneath some flowers and another 2 ducks hiding beneath a rock. So, there are a total of 6 + 2 = 8 ducks hidden in various places around the pond. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  On Monday (day 2), the water level was 17 feet deep.  On Tuesday (day 3), the water level increased by 7 feet, making it 24 feet deep. Since two-thirds of this depth is equal to 17 feet (the original depth on Monday), we can set up the equation: 2/3 \* 24 = 17. Solving for x, we get: x = 24 + 17 = 41 feet. Therefore, the water level in the tank on Tuesday was 41 feet deep.
Response:  We know that Anakin caught more fish than Locsin because he caught 10 stars, 6 horses, and 3 dragons, while Locsin caught fewer stars (less than 5), fewer horses (less than 3), and more dragons (more than 2). So we can start by comparing how many stars each person caught.  Anakin caught 10 stars, while Locsin caught less than 5. Therefore, the difference between the number of stars caught by Anakin and Locsin is 5. Now let's move on to the next comparison. Anakin also caught 6 horses, while Locsin caught fewer than 3. So the difference between the number of horses caught by Anakin and Locsin is 3. Finally, Anakin caught 3 dragons, while Locsin caught more than 2. So the difference between the number of dragons caught by Anakin and Locsin is 1. In conclusion, Anakin caught 5 + 3 = 8 more creatures than Locsin.
"Response:  If the price of one barrel of oil increases by $20 every two months, after 36 months, how much will it cost?

Step 1: Calculate the increase in price for each period (every 2 months).
Price at time t = Price at time t - 2 months + ($20 x 2)
= $80 + ($40 x 2) = $120

Step 2: Calculate the total increase in price over 36 months.
Total increase = Number of periods x Increase per period
= 36 x $120 = $4320

Therefore, after 36 months, one barrel of oil will cost $4320."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 toy cars, each worth $4; therefore, their total value is $20. The three action figures are also worth $3 each, so their total value is $9. Therefore, the total value of all the toys in the room is $29. Now, we have $5 left over after buying all these toys. So, the monster costs $5."
Response:  If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will save $3 per hour that she would have spent working as an accountant. Since she works for 3 hours less when doing her own taxes, she saves $9 (3 x 3). Therefore, if Jackie pays $90 in taxes, she will have $81 left over after paying her taxes ($90 - $9 = $81).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has $1500 as her budget for buying a new computer and some accessories. She spent $1090 on the main computer itself, which leaves her with $410 remaining. Then she bought additional items such as a scanner ($157), a CD drive ($74), and an inkjet printer ($102). So, altogether she spent $346 on these extra items. Therefore, Elvira will have $85 left over after purchasing all of these things ($410 - $346 = $85).
"Response:  If Sandra has to make 15 pieces of Spanish bread for the charity event, and each piece requires 3 eggs, then we need to calculate how many eggs Sandra needs in total. So, the number of eggs needed is:

15 x 3 = 45 eggs

Therefore, Sandra needs to keep her 9 eggs 5 times (45 / 9 = 5) to have enough eggs to make all the Spanish bread she needs."
Response:  In 2 years, Brooke will be 26 + 2 = 28 years old. So, Seth is currently 14 years old (since he is twice as old as Brooke). Therefore, Seth is 14 + 2 = 16 years old.
Response:  We know that Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel and Ethel has $8. So, if we add $2 to $8, we get $10. Therefore, Jimmy has $10.
"Response: 
Pancho walks 30 km per day, except for the last 3 days of the week when he only walks 10 km. So in one week, how much does he walk altogether?
To find out, we need to calculate the total distance walked during the week. We know that Pancho walks 30 km per day, so if there are 7 days in a week, then he walks a total distance of:
30 km/day x 7 days/week = 210 km/week
So, Pancho walks 210 km in one week."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each hat costs $25, and each scarf costs three times as much as the hat, so each scarf costs $75 ($25 x 3 = $75). Next, we know that each jacket costs twice as much as the scarf, so each jacket costs $150 ($75 x 2 = $150). Finally, we know that each pair of pants costs half as much as the jacket, so each pair of pants costs $75 ($150 / 2 = $75). Therefore, the total cost of all five items is $25 + $75 + $150 + $75 + $75 = $645.
Response:  We know that there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so the total number of legs for these spiders is 80 x 8 = 640 legs. Next, we have 90 beetles with 6 legs each, so the total number of legs for these beetles is 90 x 6 = 540 legs. Finally, we have 3 rare insects with 10 legs each, so the total number of legs for these insects is 3 x 10 = 30 legs. Therefore, in total, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
Response:  We know that Sally is 3 years older than Red, so Red is 3 + 3 = 6 years old. Since Sally is twice as old as Red, Sally is 6 x 2 = 12 years old. Now we are told that Sally is 4 times as old as Sally 3, which means Sally 3 is 4 / 4 = 1 year old. Therefore, the total age of all four chimes is 6 + 1 = 7 years old.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Jessica needs to pay each month for all her debts. The minimum payment for her student loan is $300 per month, and the minimum payment for her credit card is $200 per month. Therefore, the total monthly minimum payment is:
$300 + $200 = $500 per month
Now, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will have to pay an additional amount of:
$500 x 1.5 = $750 per month
Therefore, the total amount that Jessica needs to pay each month is:
$500 (minimum) + $750 (additional amount) = $1,250 per month"
Response:  Billy has to peel and cut 60 potatoes for his family's big gathering. Since each potato takes almost the same time to peel and cut, we can assume that it takes him about 1 minute and 30 seconds (1 min 30 sec) to do both tasks together. So, he will take 1 minute and 30 seconds to prepare all 60 potatoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell each gallon of lemonade for $3 per gallon, which means they make $6 per gallon ($3 x 2). Secondly, we know that they also sell each glass of lemonade for $0.50 per glass, which means they make $1 per 4 glasses ( $0.50 / 4 glasses). Thirdly, we are given that they receive 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $20 per gallon ($1 x 20 glasses/gallon). Finally, we want to find out how much money they made in total, so we multiply the amount they made per gallon with the number of gallons they sold: $20 x 25 = $500. Therefore, Juan and his brother Carlos made $500 in profit.
Response:  We know that there are 240 people in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is 240 - 80 = 160. Since there are 60 boys among the Chinese team, we can conclude that there are 160 - 60 = 100 girls among the Chinese team. Therefore, there are 100 girls among the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends $ 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $ 1500 (since he earns $ 6000 per month). Therefore, after paying rent, he has $ 4500 left ($ 6000 - $ 1500 = $ 4500). Secondly, we know that he spends $ 1/3 of his income on fuel for his car, which is $ 2000 ( since he earns $ 6000 per month). So after paying for fuel, he has $ 2500 left ($ 4500 - $ 2000 = $ 2500). Thirdly, we know that he donates $ 1/2 of what remains to charity, which is $ 1250 (since he has $ 2500 remaining). Therefore, after giving to charity, he has $ 1250 left ($ 2500 - $ 1250 = $ 1250). Finally, we know that he gives $ 200 to his daughter and $ 700 to his wife, so he has $ 1250 left after making these payments as well ($ 1250 - $ 900 = $ 350). Thus, after all of these expenses and contributions, Zaid has $ 350 left over each month ($ 6000 - $ 1500 + $ 200 + $ 700 + $ 1250 = $ 350).
Response:  We know that Rani has more than 10 crawfish, and Monica has fewer than 4. So, if we add up all the crawfish of these three people together, it will be greater than 40 (since 40 is the total number of crawfish Bo has). Therefore, the answer is 40 + x, where x represents the difference between the number of crawfish Rani has and 4. Since Rani has 10 crawfish more than Monica, the difference between their numbers is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the final answer is 40 + 6 = 46.
Response:  In week one, Lloyd taught for 5 hours and earned $50 (since he earns $10 per hour). So in Week 1, he earned $50 x 5 = $250.  In Week 2, he taught for 8 hours and earned $80 (still $10 per hour). So in Week 2, he earned $80 x 8 = $640. Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $250 + $640 = $890 over two weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students voted in total. Since there are 80 students in the class and 3/4 of them voted (which is equal to 60), so the total number of votes casted is 60. Now, let's calculate the number of votes received by the winner. As per the question, if the winner receives 3/4 of the total votes casted, then they will receive 60 x 3/4 = 45 votes. Therefore, the number of votes received by the runner-up is 60 - 45 = 15 votes.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:
Sandra has placed an order for 4 times more red roses than white roses (red roses = 80, white roses = 20).
She has also placed an order for 5 times more Calla lilies in pink color than in white color (Calla lilies in pink = 160, Calla lilies in white = 32).
The deadline for delivery is 5 pm.
To keep Sandra satisfied and avoid any further threats of changing suppliers, Fred needs to deliver at least __________ red roses before 5 pm.
Solution: Based on the above information, we can calculate the minimum number of red roses that Fred needs to deliver as follows:
Minimum number of red roses = Total number of red roses ordered / Number of hours left before deadline
= 80 / 7 (hours left before deadline)
= 11 (approximately)
Therefore, Fred needs to deliver at least 11 red roses before 5 pm to keep Sandra satisfied and avoid any further threats of changing suppliers."
Response:  Two years ago, Mark was older than Jan by half a year. So, if Jan is currently 30 years old, then two years ago, she was 25 years old. At that time, Mark was older than her by half a year, which means he was 26 years old. Now, Jean is two years younger than Mark, so Jean is 24 years old. Therefore, Jean is 24 - 3 = 21 years old.
"Response:  The first runner of Team A runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. Since Team B is less well-rounded, their first runner takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters. Then, each subsequent runner of Team B runs faster than the previous one by 3 seconds. Therefore, the time it takes for Team B's last runner to complete the race is:

Time taken by Team B's last runner = Time taken by Team A's last runner + (Time taken by Team B's first runner - Time taken by Team A's first runner)
= 55 seconds + (60 seconds - 55 seconds)
= 70 seconds

So, Team B will finish the race in 70 seconds."
"Response:  If Jerry is throwing a six-sided die, there are several possibilities for how many times he will roll more than 3 more than 2 consecutive numbers:

1. Jerry throws a 4 and then a 5, so he has rolled more than 3 more than 2 consecutive numbers. The probability of this happening is (1/6) \* (5/6) = 1/6.
2. Jerry throws a 3 and then a 4, so he has also rolled more than 3 more than 2 consecutive numbers. The probability of this happening is (1/6) \* (4/6) = 1/6.
3. Jerry throws a 2 and then a 3, so he has not rolled more than 3 more than 2 consecutive numbers in either case. The probability of this happening is 0.

Therefore, the probability that Jerry will lăn a large number more than 3 times consecutively is 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3."
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked 15 apples from their apple farm, then Jenna alone picked half of that amount, which is 7 apples (since 15 / 2 = 7). So, if Jenna's mother had 20 apples in total, then Jenna picked 7 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 10 lids for hamsters and each lid has 5 pieces of food. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food for hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.  Now we need to find out how many lids fit in one bag of food. Since there are no other bags of food mentioned in the passage, let's assume that one bag of food contains enough food for all the animals in the store. So, if 160 pieces of food were distributed among all the animals in the store, then the number of bags of food needed would be 160 / 50 = 3.2 bags.  Therefore, there are approximately 3.2 bags of food per lidded container for the hamsters.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much interest is owed each month based on the given interest rate and amount borrowed. The formula for this is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2%, and the time is 3 months (or 0.5 years). So, the interest owed each month would be: Interest = $100 x 2% x 0.5 = $1 Interest Owed Each Month Now that we know the total interest owed over the 3-month period, we can calculate the total amount Mandy needs to pay back to Benedict after 3 months. Total Amount Due After 3 Months = Principal + Interest Total Amount Due After 3 Months = $100 + $1 = $101 Therefore, if Mandy can repay Benedict after 3 months, she should give him $101.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the wholesaler bought $10 worth of rice from each farmer at $20 per basket. Therefore, he paid a total of $20 x 5 = $100 to buy all the baskets from the farmers.  Secondly, we know that the wholesaler sold each basket for $30, so he earned a total of $30 x 5 = $150 from selling all the baskets. Finally, we subtract the cost of goods sold ($100) from the revenue ($150) to find out the profit made by the wholesaler, which is $50. So, the wholesaler has sold 50 baskets of rice.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three people in total, and each person has paid $20.25 for the entrance tickets to the fair. Therefore, the total amount of money spent on entrance tickets is:
$20.25 x 3 = $60.75
Next, we know that the group also spent less than $4.50 on food, which means they must have spent exactly $4.50 on food. So, the total amount of money spent by the group on both entrance tickets and food is:
$60.75 + $4.50 = $65.25
Finally, we know that the group took two bus rides costing $33 each, for a total of $66. Therefore, the total amount of money spent by the group is:
$65.25 + $66 = $131.25
So, if the group agreed to split the bill equally among themselves, each person would need to pay:
$131.25 / 3 = $43.75"
Response:  If John takes 3 hours to dig up the potatoes, that means he has dug them up for 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. Since he can dig up 2 potatoes per minute, he has dug up 180 / 2 = 90 potatoes in total. Therefore, John has dug up 90 potatoes in 3 hours.
Response:  If one bird needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive, then ten birds would need 35 pounds of insects per week (10 x 3.5 = 35). So, the daily amount of insects needed for ten birds is 35 / 7 = 5 pounds per day.
"Response: 
Tom started with 50 trees and planted 10 new ones each year. So after one year, he had 60 trees (50 + 10). 
In the second year, he planted another 10 trees, so now he has 70 trees (60 + 10). This pattern continues for 10 years, so after 10 years, he has 80 trees (70 x 1.3 = 90). 
Now, 30% of the trees are dead, which means 24 trees died (80 x 0.3 = 24). So, Tom is left with 66 trees (80 - 24 = 66)."
Response:  On Saturday (day 1), Sue had 18 original flamingos outside her house.  On Sunday (day 2), half of them came back (9 flamingos). So now Sue has 9 + 18 = 27 flamingos outside her house.  On Monday (day 3), some more new flamingos were added to make it 27 + 18 = 45 flamingos outside Sue's house. Therefore, there are 45 flamingos outside Sue's house at noon on Sunday.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many different colors of pens she wants to buy. According to the question, she wants to buy 5 different colors of pens. So, the total number of pens she needs is 5.  Next, we need to calculate the cost of each pen. The cost of one pen is $2, so the total cost of 5 pens will be $10 (5 x $2).  Finally, we add the amount she is willing to pay for the pens, which is $20, to get the total amount she will receive, which is $30 ($10 + $20). Therefore, her answer is $30.
"Response:  We know that one pen costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30. To find out how many pens we can buy with the money, we divide the cost of one pen by the cost of one pen:

$1.20 / $1.20 = 1

So, we can buy one pen for every dollar we have. Now let's calculate how much it will cost to buy 8 pens:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $9.60."
Response:  We know that there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of catfish. Therefore, the total amount of catfish to be distributed is 40 x 2 = 80 pounds. Now we need to find out how much catfish will not be used. To do this, let's assume that some catfish may get damaged or spoiled during transportation or storage. For example, if 10% of the catfish gets damaged, then 80 pounds / 10% = 8 pounds of catfish will not be used. So the answer is 8 pounds.
"Response:  We know that there are 23786 people in Soda and 8417 of them are male. Therefore, the number of females is 9092 - 8417 = 6775. Now we need to find out how many children there are in Soda. According to the question, ""Phần còn lại của dân số là trẻ em."" So, the number of children can be calculated as follows: Total population = Number of males + Number of females + Number of children = 23786 (male) + 6775 (female) +? (child) =? Children = Total population - (Number of males + Number of females) = 23786 - (8417 + 6775) = 12698 In conclusion, there are 12698 children living in Soda."
Response:  In the first month, Elaine collected 20 cards and then tripled that amount in the second month to have 60 cards.  In the third month, she doubled her total collection from the previous two months to have 120 cards. Therefore, Elaine had 120 cards at the end of the third month.
Response:  We know that Mark edits 1000 sentences per week for two publishers, Publisher A and Publisher B. The pay rate for each sentence edited is different between the two publishers. Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A. So, if Publisher A pays $x per sentence, Publisher B pays $2x per sentence. Now we need to find out how much money Mark makes in one week. Since he edits 1000 sentences per week, he earns $x + $2x = 3x per week. Therefore, Mark makes $3000 per week ($3x).
"Response:  If Baldur drinks 5 thùng (túng) of water per morning and 6 thùng per afternoon, then he drinks a total of:

Morning: 5 thùng/day × 2 times = 10 thùng/day
Afternoon: 6 thùng/day × 2 times = 12 thùng/day
Total daily water consumption: 10 + 12 = 22 thùng/day
Therefore, Baldur consumes 22 liters of water per day."
Response:  If John earns $2000 per week and receives a bonus of $5000 at the beginning of each year, his total annual income would be:  Annual income = Weekly income x Number of weeks in a year = $2000 x 52 = $104,000  Now, let's calculate how much he will receive as a bonus if he gets it on the first day of the year: Bonus amount = Total annual income x Percentage increase = $104,000 x 5% = $5200 So, John will receive a bonus of $5200 on the first day of the year.
Response:  If Josie has 10 acres of land and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then she will produce 50 tons of grapes per year (10 acres x 5 tons/acre = 50 tons). Since each ton of grapes can make 2 barrels of wine, then Josie will produce 100 barrels of wine per year (50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels). Therefore, the answer is 100 barrels of wine per year.
"Response: 
1. Carl eats one sandwich per day and uses two slices of cheese for each sandwich. So he uses 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese in total.
2. He also eats three eggs per day and uses one slice of cheese for each egg. So he uses 3 x 7 = 21 slices of cheese in total.
3. Therefore, Carl uses a total of 14 + 21 = 35 slices of cheese during the week."
"Response:  We know that:
* Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens initially. So, she has a total of 32 pens (22 + 10).
* She bought 6 green tubes and 2 red tubes. So, she now has 9 green pens in each tube (since there are 9 pens in each tube), and 6 pens in each red tube (since there are 6 pens in each red tube).
* Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has is: 32 (initial) + 54 (from buying tubes) = 86 pens."
Response:  If Brinley has scored 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in the first five exams, then her total score is: $89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458$.  Since she wants to have an average of 93, we need to find out how many points she needs to get in the sixth exam: $ \text {Total Score} - \text{Desired Average} = 458 - 93 = 365$. Therefore, Brinley needs to score at least 365 points in the sixth exam to achieve an average of 93.
"Response:  Firstly, Michael rode his bike for at least 5 times a week and covered 25 km each time in the first 4 weeks. Therefore, he traveled a total distance of:

$$ Distance = \text {Number of trips} \times \text{Distance per trip} $$

$$= 5 \times 25 = 125 km $$

Now, after 3 weeks, Michael reduced the number of times he rode his bike to twice a week but increased the distance he covered each time to 60 km. So, he traveled a total distance of:

$$ Distance = \text {Number of trips} \times \text{Distance per trip} $$

$$= 2 \times 60 = 120 km $$

Therefore, Michael traveled a total distance of $125 + 120 = 245 km$."
Response:  We know that there are 25 pieces of chocolate in Joe's bag and each piece weighs twice as much as an apple. Therefore, the total weight of all the chocolates is 25 x 2 = 50 grams. Now, let's convert this to kilograms. There are 1000 grams in one kilogram, so 50 grams / 1000 = 0.05 kg. So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 0.05 kg or 50 grams.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 pies. On Tuesday, she went to another store and bought 3 times as many pies (or 12 pies). On Wednesday, she went to yet another store and bought 5 times as many pies (or 20 pies). So, in total, Rose has bought 4 + 12 + 20 = 36 pies over the course of three days.
"Response:  We have:
Half of 30 cups = 15 cups (since there are 30 cups in total)
Tax per cup = $6000 / 15 cups = $400 per cup
Total cost per cup = Tax per cup + Price per cup = $400 + $1200 = $1600 per cup
Therefore, the total cost for each cup is $1600."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $30 to spend on an overcoat and $20 for each pair of shoes. So in total, she can buy at most $30 + (2 x $20) = $60 worth of clothes.  Secondly, we are told that Sara earns $5 per time she cuts grass, so after cutting grass 4 times, she will have earned $5 x 4 = $20. Thirdly, we know that her parents give her $4 every time she cuts grass, so after cutting grass 4 times, she will have received $4 x 4 = $16 from them. Therefore, Sara now has a total of $20 + $16 = $36. Finally, if Sara had $10 before starting to work, then she will have $10 + $36 = $46 left after buying the clothes. So, Sara needs to cut grass 9 times ($46 / $16) to be able to afford the overcoat and shoes.
Response:  If Jerry has two white chickens that lay 5 eggs each day and one red chicken that lays 3 eggs each day, then in total he will collect 42 eggs per day (10 + 15 = 42). Now, if Jerry has more than two white chickens, we can say that for every additional white chicken, it will produce 5 extra eggs per day (since there are already 2 white chickens producing 5 eggs each). So, if Jerry has k white chickens, then they will produce k \* 5 = 5k eggs per day. Similarly, if Jerry has more than one red chicken, each red chicken will still produce 3 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs Jerry collects per day is 42 + 5k, where k is the number of white chickens Jerry owns.
"Response:  The perimeter of a rectangle is given as $P = 1.5 \text { miles} \times 6 \text{ miles} = 9 \text{ miles}$.  If he walks at a speed of $3 \text{ miles}/\text{hour}$, then the time taken to walk around the park is:
$$Time = Distance / Speed = 9 \text{ miles} / 3 \text{ miles}/\text{hour} = 3 \text{ hours}$$
Therefore, the answer is $3 \text{ hours}$."
Response:  On day one (Sloane counted 100 customers), +On day two (she added another 50 customers), =Total number of customers on day three (if there were 500 customers). So, Sloane counted 650 customers on day three.
Response:  At first, both pools had the same amount of water (4 gallons per minute). So, after 4 minutes, the total amount of water in both pools would be equal to 4 x 4 = 16 gallons. Now, we are told that the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, the total amount of water in the large pool is 16 x 4 = 64 gallons. Since the small pool initially contained 4 gallons of water, it now contains 64 - 4 = 60 gallons of water.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320 and a scarf for $32. So in total, she needs to earn $352 ($320 + $32). Now, we are given that her hourly wage is $8. Therefore, she needs to work for how many hours to save enough money to buy these items? To find out, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($352) by her hourly wage ($8): Number of hours = $352 / $8 = 44 hours So, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before buying those items.
Response:  If Janeth pays $2000 and promises to pay back with an additional 10%, then she will pay $2200 ( $2000 + ($2000 x 10%)).  Since she will pay this amount for 12 months, her monthly payment will be $165 ($2200 / 12). Therefore, after 12 months, Janeth's remaining balance will be $1335 ($2200 - $165 x 12).
Response:  We know that there are 4 red roses in the vase and 7 daisies more than rose flowers in the vase. So, if we want to find out how many total flowers are in the vase, we can use the following equation: Total number of flowers = Number of red roses + (Number of daisies - Number of red roses) Therefore, we substitute the values given in the question into this equation as follows: Total number of flowers = 4 + (7 - 4) = 15 In conclusion, there are 15 flowers in the vase.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 x 21 = 63 years old. Secondly, we know that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Harriet's age is (Zack's age) / 2 = 40 years old. Finally, we add the ages of all three people together to find their average age over the past three years: 63 + 40 + (63 + 40) / 2 = 75 years old. Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack over the past three years is 75 years old.
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's score plus 10 points. So Yuri scored at least 68 + 10 = 78 points.  Since Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, she scored at least 68 + 17 = 85 points.  And Jojo scored fewer points than Brianna. Therefore, Jojo scored less than 85 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carmen took 10 minutes to solve one Sudoku puzzle and 5 minutes to solve another Sudoku puzzle. Therefore, she spent a total of 15 minutes solving two Sudoku puzzles. Next, we are given that she solved 3 Chess puzzles in 20 minutes. So, she spent 20/3 = 6.67 minutes per Chess puzzle. Finally, we know that she solved 8 Sudoku puzzles and 3 Chess puzzles in total. Therefore, she spent a total of 15 + 6.67 x 8 = 94.67 minutes playing these games during the week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Celine took 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, the remaining amount of water in the tank is:  120 - 90 = 30 liters. Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank now.
Response:  We know that Andy has planted 90 geraniums and fewer than 40 petunias. So, we can assume that there are more geraniums than petunias. Let's call the number of petunias x. Then, the total number of flowers is equal to the sum of the number of geraniums and the number of petunias: Total = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias Now, we have two equations based on the information given in the question: Equation 1: Number of geraniums = 90 Equation 2: Number of petunias = x - 40 Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: Number of geraniums = 90 = Number of geraniums + (x - 40) Solving for x, we get: x = 50 Therefore, the total number of flowers is: Total = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias = 90 + 50 = 140 Bông hoa.
Response:  In year 1, the company spends $15,000 on advertising and in year 2, it spends $\frac{1}{3}$ of that amount, or $5,000. So, the total amount spent on advertising over both years is: $$ \therefore Total = 15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000 $$
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time each person spent using the boat and kayak respectively.  For Carlos, he used the boat for 3 hours, so his total cost is $30 x 3 = $90.  For Benji, he used the kayak for 5 hours, so his total cost is $18 x 5 = $90 as well.  Therefore, both of them will have to pay $90 each for renting the boats or kayaks.
"Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half of that time (3 days) to return by car, then we can calculate the total number of days as follows:

Total days = 6 + (3/2) = 9 days

Therefore, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will need 9 days in total."
Response:  We know that James has 30 fire cards and 40 water cards initially. If he loses 8 water cards, then his total number of water cards becomes: 40 - 8 = 32. Now, if he buys 14 grass cards, then his total number of grass cards becomes: 32 + 14 = 46. So, the probability that a randomly chosen card is a water card is: $ \frac{32}{94} $.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Chad ordered a basic burrito for $6.50. Then he added extra meat ($2), cheese ($1), and sauce ($0.25 x 2 = $0.50). So far, the total cost is $7.25. Next, he decided to upgrade his meal with fries and drink, which costs $3.00 more. Therefore, the final cost of Chad's meal is $10.25. Finally, he used a gift card worth $5.00, so he owes $5.25 in total.

Time = Number of pieces / Speed (in minutes)
= 120 pieces / 2 (since each piece is worth half a point)
= 60 minutes
So it will take them 60 minutes to solve the puzzle."
Response:  Two months ago, Ashlyn visited the farm and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested. So she brought them back home.  When she returned two weeks later, 75% (3/4) of the remaining watermelons were ready to be harvested, so she harvested them. Therefore, after two weeks, there are 60% (3/4 \* 75%) of the original watermelons left unharvested.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all 12 cars that Mark wants to buy for his company. The price of each car is $20,000, so the total cost would be:

$20,000 x 12 = $240,000

Next, we need to subtract the taxes paid on each car. Since Mark pays 10% of the purchase price as taxes, he will pay:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

So, the total amount Mark pays for all 12 cars including taxes is:

$240,000 - $24,000 = $216,000

Finally, since Mark also needs to register each car, he will have to pay an additional $1,000 per car. So, the total amount he will pay for registration is:

$216,000 + (12 x $1,000) = $237,000

Therefore, the final answer is:

Mark pays $237,000 for all 12 cars, including both the purchase price and registration fees."
Response:  On Monday (Day 1), Kylie collected 5 shells more than Robert, who collected 20 shells. So, Kylie collected 25 shells (5 + 20).  On Tuesday (Day 2), Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, which means she collected 4 times as many shells as Robert (since he collected only 20 shells on both days). Therefore, Kylie collected 90 shells (4 x 23) on Tuesday.
Response:  If there are 50 bees in the garden and Dax takes half of them (which is 25), then the number of bees left in the garden is 50 - 25 = 25. So, the total number of insects in the garden including bees is 25 + 25 = 50.
Response:  If 36 chickadees are in the snow and some of them jump into the ocean to swim (1/3), then there will be 24 chickadees left on land (3 x 8 = 24). Now, if another third of these remaining chickadees go into the cave to eat dinner (1/3), we have 16 chickadees left outside (24 - 8 = 16). Therefore, there are 16 chickadees still left to sunbathe in the snow.
Response:  If Steve eats 6 quails of cherries per day and he decides to grow his own cherries, then we need to find out how many trees are needed to produce 6 quails of cherries per day.  We know that one tree can produce 3 quails of cherries per week, so we need to divide 6 by 3 to get the number of trees needed: 6/3 = 2 trees per day. Therefore, Steve needs 2 trees to produce enough cherries for him to eat every day.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 people and each person wants to have 4 slices of pizza. Since the pizza can only be cut into 8 pieces, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to buy:

$$ \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{\text{Total number of people}}{\text{Number of slices per pizza}} $$

In this case, the total number of people is 20, and the number of slices per pizza is 4. So, we can plug these values into the equation above:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of pizzas}} = \frac{\text{20}}{4} = 5 $$

Therefore, John needs to buy 5 pizzas."
Response:  If Ram uses 5 pens at a time and he has 25 pens in total, then he can make 5 pens using each of them once. So, the number of pens he can make is 5 x 25 = 125 pens. Therefore, the final answer is 125 pens.
Response:  Firstly, Johnny has $20 + $10 = $30 to invest. Then he invests it and gets back three times as much after one year, which is $30 x 3 = $90. Therefore, after one year, Johnny has $90.
"Response:  We know that Mary is younger than Joan by two years, so their ages are:
Mary = 18 (since she is two years younger than Joan)
Joan = 20
We also know that Joan is older than Jessa by five years, so their ages are:
Jessa = 15
Now we need to find the total sum of their ages:
Total age = Mary + Joan + Jessa = 18 + 20 + 15 = 53 years old"
Response:  Firstly, after the meeting, 30% of students left through door A, so the number of students who left through door A is 30%.  Then, 3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, so the number of students who left through door B is (3/5) x 700 = 210. Finally, the remaining students left through door C, so the number of students who left through door C is 700 - 210 = 490. Therefore, the total number of students who left through door C is 490.
"Response:  We know that James has 6 kẹo more than Robert. So, if Robert has x kẹo, then James has x + 6 = 72 kẹo (since he has 6 more). Now we know that John has twice as many kẹo as Robert, so John has 2x = 144 kẹo (twice x = double of x). Since John has 54 kẹo and John has 144 kẹo, we can deduce that John has 90 kẹo more than James (54 - 72 = -18; -18 > 90). Therefore, John has 90 kẹo more than James."
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then at the beginning of the game, they have together 3 books (2 + 1).  During each round, they will exchange their books with each other, so after each round, they will have 2 books less than before. Therefore, the number of books they will have together at the end of the game is:  3 - 2 = 1. So, the answer is 1.
"Response: 
Mike is no longer friends with 2 people out of the original 5. So there are now only 3 people left who are still friends with Mike.
Each person sends 2 letters per week, and each letter takes 5 minutes to write. Therefore, in total, there are 60 minutes (or 1 hour) worth of writing per week.
Since Mike writes one page per 6 minutes, he can write 60 pages per week.
So, Mike spends 60/6 = 10 minutes per day writing letters."
"Response:  Jason has a plan to make 1000 calls per month, and each day he spends 15 minutes talking to his boss (or ""sếp"" in Vietnamese). So, in one month, he will spend 15 x 30 = 450 minutes talking to his boss. Now, let's calculate how many minutes he can spend calling other people if there are 30 days in the month: 450 minutes - 30 x 15 = 270 minutes. Therefore, Jason will have 270 minutes left over for calling other people if there are 30 days in the month."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Griffin had 24 chicken nuggets initially and then he got some from Ginger (but the number is not specified). So let's call this amount as x. Then, Kyle took 5 chicken nuggets away from Griffin. Therefore, the total number of chicken nuggets left with Griffin after Kyle took them away is 24 - 5 = 19. Next, Billy doubled the number of chicken nuggets taken by Kyle, which means he took 10 more chicken nuggets (since doubling 5 gives 10). So now, the total number of chicken nuggets taken away by Billy is 19 + 10 = 29. After that, Colby took fewer than 3 chicken nuggets from Griffin. Since Colby took fewer than 3 chicken nuggets, let's say he took exactly 2 chicken nuggets. Now, the total number of chicken nuggets left with Griffin is 27 (initial) - 29 (chicken nuggets taken away by Billy) + 2 (chicken nuggets taken away by Colby) = 27 - 27 + 2 = 0. Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 0 chicken nuggets.
Response:  In the first tank, there are 4 snails and 32 fish. So, if we divide the number of fish in the first tank by 4 (the number of snails), we get 8 fish per snail.  Therefore, each snail in the second tank has 8/2 = 4 fish.  So, there are 4 x 32 = 128 fish in the second tank.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours every day. Therefore, her total earnings for one week are:  $250/hour x 6 hours/day x 7 days/week = $15,000 (per week)  Next, we know that the movie takes 5 weeks to complete, so the makeup artist will work for a total of:  $15,000/week x 5 weeks = $75,000 (total earnings for the movie)  Now, after completing the movie, the makeup artist will give Jean a discount of 10%. So, Jean will pay:  $75,000 x 90% = $67,500 (final amount paid by Jean)
Response:  Firstly, we know that Isabelle spent $12 on ingredients for the birthday cake, $43 on gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on party favors.  Total amount spent = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $86.  Since Isabelle wants to split the cost equally among her parents, each parent will have to pay $86 / 3 = $28.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pounds of rice are in each bag. Since there are 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds, then the total weight of all 4 bags is:

$$ Total = 4 \times 50 = 200 pounds $$
Now, let's find out how much money the chef spent on rice. Each pound of rice costs $1.50, so the total cost of all 200 pounds of rice is:

$$ Cost = 200 \times 1.50 = $300 $$
Therefore, the chef spent $300 on rice."
Response:  On Monday (Day 1), Sue ate 4 times as many pancakes as her sister, which means she ate 4 x 20 = 80 pancakes.  On Tuesday (Day 2), Sue ate twice as many pancakes as her sister, which means she ate 2 x 20 = 40 pancakes. So, in total, Sue ate 80 + 40 = 120 pancakes.  Therefore, Sue consumed more than her sister by 120 - 5 = 115 calories.
