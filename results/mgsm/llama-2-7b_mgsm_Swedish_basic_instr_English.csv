"Response: 12 miles
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the question. We know that John drove for three hours at an average speed of 60 km/h (or 37 mph). Then he turned around and drove back home for four hours with an average speed of 80 mph. Since he spent two hours stuck in traffic during his return trip, let's assume he didn't drive any faster than 30 mph during those two hours. Therefore, the total distance he drove during the four-hour period is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 4 hours = 320 miles
Since he was initially 60 kilometers away from home, the distance between him and home after the four hours is:
Distance = Total Distance - Initial Distance = 320 miles - 60 kilometers = 260 miles
Therefore, John is 260 miles away from home after the four hours."
"Response: 63 dollars. 
Explanation: To calculate Eliza's income for the week, we need to multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she worked during the first 40 hours of each week. Since she works 45 hours per week, we can multiply her hourly wage by 45/40 = 1.125 (since she gets an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly wage). Therefore, Eliza's total income for the week is $10 x 45/40 = $63."

Explanation: The total number of downloads during the three months can be calculated as follows:
Month 1: 60 downloads
Month 2: 3 x 60 = 180 downloads (since there were three times as many downloads in Month 2 as in Month 1)
Month 3: 180 - 30% = 126 downloads (since there was a 30% decrease in downloads in Month 3 compared to Month 2)
Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 210."
Response:  The total cost of the baked goods is $68 + $80 + $55 = $193.
"Response: 62 years
Explanation: To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the initial cost of planting the tree and the annual costs of caring for it, as well as the revenue he will generate from selling lemons each year. Let's break down the calculation like this:

Initial Cost of Planting Tree = $90
Annual Costs (Watering + Fertilizing) = $3 per year
Revenue from Selling Lemons = $1.50 per lemon x 7 lemons per year = $10.50 per year
To find out when Carlos will start making a profit, we can set up an equation using these values:
Yearly Profit = Revenue - Annual Costs
= $10.50 - ($3 per year)
= $7.50 per year
Since Carlos has already spent $90 to plant the tree, it will take him approximately 62 years to make back that initial investment based on his projected annual profits of $7.50. Therefore, the answer is 62 years."

"Response: 137
Explanation: Let's analyze each friend's response:
Friend 1 says 80 buns. This means that they estimate there are at least 80 buns in the jar.
Friend 2 says 20 more than half of Friend 1's estimate, which is 40 (since half of 80 is 40). So, they think there are at least 40 buns in the jar.
Friend 3 says 25% more than Friend 1's estimate, which is 105 (since 25% more than 80 is 105). They believe there are at least 105 buns in the jar.
Now, let's find the average of these estimates:
Average = (80 + 40 + 105) / 3 = 137
Therefore, based on their responses, the friends estimate that there are approximately 137 marmalade buns in the jar."

Since he has six dollars left over after buying the video games, he must have had six Lego sets remaining before he sold them."

"Response: 48 dollars
Explanation: To calculate the net profit of Charlie's sale of bi-valent light bulbs, we need to consider the cost of each unit and the price at which he is selling them. Since it costs $10 for one kilogram of bi-valent light bulbs and $2 per unit when sold, the total revenue from selling 20 units would be:
Revenue = Number of units x Price per unit
= 20 x $2
= $40
Subtracting the cost of each unit from the revenue gives us the net profit:
Net Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $40 - $10
= $30
Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he sells 20 bi-valent light bulbs is $30."
"Response: 16 hours.
Explanation: To calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles during the three days, we need to multiply the number of articles written each day by the time it took to write each article.
For Monday, she wrote 5 articles and each article took 4 hours to write, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing articles for Monday.
For Tuesday, she wrote 3/5 times as many articles as on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 hours.
For Wednesday, she doubled the number of articles she wrote compared to Tuesday, so she spent 2 x 4 = 8 hours writing articles for Wednesday.
Adding up these amounts gives us a total of 20 + 12 + 8 = 40 hours spent writing articles over the three days."

Explanation: To find out how much John has spent on slipsars, we need to calculate the total cost of the red and blue slips he bought. Since he gave $200 for blue slips that cost $40 each, he spent $200 x 40 = $8,000 on blue slips. For red slips, since they cost 50% more than blue slips, their cost is $8,000 / 2 = $4,000. Therefore, John has spent a total of $8,000 + $4,000 = $12,000 on slipsars."

"Response: 35.6 seconds
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for finding an unknown time given two known times and their corresponding speeds:

Time = Distance / Speed

We are given that Lee can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, which means his speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time = 400 m / 38 s = 10.4 m/s

Gerald's original speed was 9.4 m/s (10% improvement), so after changing his diet, his new speed becomes:

New Speed = Old Speed x (1 + Percentage Change) = 9.4 m/s x (1 + 0.10) = 10.4 m/s

Now, let's find out how fast Gerald can run 400 meters without obstacles:

Time = Distance / Speed = 400 m / 10.4 m/s = 37.8 s

Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters without obstacles in 37.8 seconds."

Explanation:
The hospital sees 500 patients per day and each patient is treated in an average of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent treating patients is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes per day. Since the doctors charge $150 per hour and the hospital charges $200 per hour, the total revenue generated by the hospital from these visits can be calculated as follows: Revenue = Total time spent treating patients x Price per minute. In this case, the revenue would be: Revenue = 12,000 minutes/day x ($150/hour) = $180,000 per day."

"Response: 2376 (rounded to nearest whole number)
Explanation:
The first Lego box has 500 bits, and since it takes Johnny 1 minute to pick up 100 bits, he will take 5 minutes to pick up all the bits in this box.
The second Lego box has three times as many bits as the first one, so it takes Johnny 3 x 5 = 15 minutes to pick up all its bits.
The third Lego box has 1/4 of the total number of bits, which is 25% of the total number of bits. Since it takes Johnny 1 minute to pick up 100 bits, it will take him 25 minutes to pick up all the bits in this box.
Therefore, the total time taken by Johnny to pick up all the Lego figures is 5 + 15 + 25 = 55 minutes.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time taken by Johnny into hours as follows:
55 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.92 hours (or approximately 1 hour)."

Explanation: According to the information provided, during the first six hours, 30 bees left the hive and did not return within the next six hours. This means that there were 30 - 2 = 28 bees that returned to the hive after their initial flight. Since Debra saw double the number of bees leaving than returning, this means that she saw 28 x 2 = 56 bees leave the hive during the last six hours. Therefore, the total number of bees that came back to the hive during the last six hours is 56 + 30 = 86 bees."

"Response: 48 hours.
Explanation: To calculate the total length of all the baked goods, we need to multiply their individual lengths by the number of each type that Bill has. For example, the total length of the 300 rullor is 300 x 15 cm = 4500 cm. Similarly, the total length of the 120 croissants is 120 x 15 cm = 1800 cm, and the total length of the 60 baguettes is 60 x 60 cm = 3600 cm. Since these are all different lengths, we add them up to get the total length of all the bakeries: 4500 + 1800 + 3600 = 9900 cm. This means it would take Bill 48 hours to make all these baked goods if he works continuously without any breaks (assuming a constant rate of production)."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 3 burbs for the rabbits and each burb contains 6 halms. Therefore, the total number of halms distributed among the rabbits is 3 x 6 = 18 halms. Since the rabbits are kept separately, they do not share their halms with any other animals. Similarly, there are 10 burbs for the hamsters and each burb contains 5 halms, so the total number of halms distributed among the hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50 halms. The remaining 160 halms are divided equally among all the small rodents (gnats), which means that each gnat gets 1/3 or 20 halms. Therefore, the number of raccoons in each bur is 20 / 3 = 6."

Explanation: Let's assume that Jerry has x number of red chickens and y number of white chickens. Since he collects 42 eggs per day, we know that x + y = 42 (since each egg is produced by one chicken). Also, since the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day more than the red chickens, we can write y - x = 5. Now we have two equations: x + y = 42 and y - x = 5. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 18 and y = 26. Therefore, Jerry has 18 red chickens."

Explanation: To calculate the probability of randomly selected card being water type, we need to use Bayes' theorem with prior probabilities given in the question. The formula is: P(W|J) = P(J|W) \* P(W)/P(J) where W represents water type, J represents all types combined and P(J|W), P(W), and P(J) are defined as follows: P(J|W) = 3/10, since there are 3 water types out of 10 total types P(W) = 20/50, since there are 20 grass types and 50 cards in total P(J) = 1/10, since there is only one water type among 10 possible types Now using these values, we can plug them into the formula and solve for P(W|J): P(W|J) = (3/10) \* (20/50) / (1/10) = 0.5679 or approximately 56.79% Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected card will be water type after losing 8 cards of water type and buying 14 cards of grass type is approximately 56.79%."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
* ""En tredjedel av dem hoppar i och simmar i havet."" means that 1/3 of the total number of penguins jump into the sea to swim.
* ""En annan tredjedel går in i grottan för att äta sin middag."" means that another 1/3 of the total number of penguins go into the cave to eat their lunch.

Now, let's use these proportions to calculate the number of penguins left for solbading (sunbathing):
Total number of penguins = 36
Number of penguins that jumped into the sea or went into the cave = 1/3 x 36 = 12
So, the number of penguins remaining for solbading is: Total number of penguins - Number of penguins that jumped into the sea or went into the cave = 36 - 12 = 24
Therefore, there are 24 penguins left for solbading."

Then, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, which is equal to 600 students (3/5 x 800), since there are 800 - 300 = 500 students left. Finally, the remaining students (i.e., 200 students) left through exit C. Therefore, the total number of students who left through exit C is 200."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, James has fewer pieces of candy than Robert (James has 36 pieces of candy, while Robert has 54). Therefore, James has 18 less pieces of candy than Robert. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, John has 2 times 54 = 108 pieces of candy. However, since James has fewer pieces of candy than Robert, James has fewer pieces of candy than John by 18 pieces. So, James has 108 - 18 = 89 pieces of candy more than James."
