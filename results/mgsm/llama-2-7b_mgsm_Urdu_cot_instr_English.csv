Response:  Genie gives $10 to each of his three friends every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he gives them a total of $70 per week (3 x $10). Now, let's calculate how much money Genie has given away in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so Genie gives away a total of $280 in a month ($70 x 4). Therefore, the number of dollars that Genie gives away in a month is $280.
Response:  We have two bullets in total and half of them are red. So, we can say that there are 1 bullet out of every 2 red bullets. Now, let's count how many red bullets we have:  Red Bullets = Total Bullets / Number of Red Bullets = 2 / (1/2) = 4 bullets. Therefore, there are 4 red bullets in total.
Response:  Firstly, Josh bought a house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 to renovate it. So, the total cost of buying and renovating the house is $130,000 ($80,000 + $50,000). Now, there has been an increase of 150% in the value of the house after renovation. Therefore, the new value of the house is $240,000 (150% of $160,000). So, Josh made a profit of $110,000 ($240,000 - $130,000) from selling the renovated house.
Response:  Jamie has played cricket for 15 years and scored 60 runs in each of those years. Therefore, he has scored a total of 9000 runs (60 x 15 = 9000) over his career. Now, we are asked how many meters he would have run if he had walked at a speed of 6 km/h for 15 years. To calculate this, we need to convert the distance traveled in kilometers to meters. There are 1000 meters in one kilometer, so: Distance = Speed x Time = 6 km/h x 15 years = 90,000 km Now, there are 1000 meters in one kilometer, so: Distance in meters = Distance in kilometers / 1000 = 90,000 km / 1000 = 90 million meters Therefore, Jamie has walked approximately 90 million meters during his 15-year cricketing career.
Response:  If Veena feeds her marbles 15 capsules in the morning and 25 capsules at noon, then she has to feed them 40 capsules (15 + 25) altogether. Since there are 20 marbles in total, Veena needs to feed each marble 2 capsules per day (40 / 20 = 2). Therefore, the answer is 2.
"Response:  The cost of one glass is Rs.50 and each subsequent glass costs Rs.60 more than the previous one. To calculate how many glasses Cal can afford to buy, we need to divide the total amount he has (Rs.200) by the cost of one glass (Rs.50). So, Cal can afford to buy:

Cal can afford to buy 4 glasses (200/50 = 4)."
"Response:  According to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, species evolve through natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow.  In his book ""On the Origin of Species,"" he presents evidence for common descent with modification, which means that all living organisms share a common ancestor but have undergone changes over time due to various factors such as environmental pressures (natural selection), random events (genetic drift), genetic mutations, or migration between populations (gene flow).  Now let's consider how many genera might exist in each group based on these mechanisms: 1) Natural Selection: This process favors individuals with traits better suited to their environment; therefore, if there are 20 species within one genus, we can assume that at least 4-5 genera will emerge from this mechanism alone (since each species has an average lifespan of around 1 million years). So far, so good! However, things get interesting when we start thinking about what happens next..."
Response:  The file size is 200 MB and can be downloaded in 1 minute using a 4 Mbps internet connection. Since there are 2 GB of data available for download per month, we can download files up to 80% of our total data limit, which is 160 MB (2 GB x 4/5). So, we can download files up to 160 MB in one go. Therefore, the number of files that can be downloaded in one go is 160 MB / 200 MB = 0.75 or approximately 1 file.
Response:  Jan has been driving for 60 minutes and has covered 4 miles. He then stops at a red light for 2 minutes before continuing to drive at an average speed of 30 mph. After another 2 minutes, he reaches a speed of 80 mph and drives for 4 more minutes. How far does he go in total? To find out, we need to calculate how much distance he covers during each minute of his journey. We know that he travels at an average speed of 30 mph for 2 minutes, which means he covers a distance of 60 x 30 = 1800 feet. Similarly, he covers a distance of 80 x 4 = 3200 feet during the last 4 minutes of his journey. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Jan is 1800 + 3200 = 5000 feet.
"Response:  If Elizabeth works for 40 hours in one week and her monthly salary is $10,000, then her hourly wage would be:

$10,000 / 40 hours = $250 per hour

Now, let's calculate how much she earns in one day (7 days a week):

$250 x 7 days = $1,750 per week

And finally, if she works for 45 weeks in a year (assuming 52 weeks in a year), then her total annual income would be:

$1,750 x 45 weeks = $81,250 per year

So, to answer your question, if Elizabeth worked for 45 weeks in a year instead of 40 weeks, her annual income would increase by $81,250 - $73,750 = $7,500."
"Response:  In the first month of the program, there were 60 loads. In the second month, the number of loads decreased to 40 (less than 60). In the third month, the number of loads increased again and reached 50 (more than 40 but less than 60). Finally, in the fourth month, the number of loads was 30 (less than 50). So, the total number of times the word ""load"" appeared in the program during four months is: 60 + 40 + 50 + 30 = 180."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of all three types of beverages: 3 drums of oil at Rs. 68 per drum = Rs. 194; 2 drums of milk at Rs. 80 per drum = Rs. 160; and 6 drums of paneer at Rs. 55 per drum = Rs. 330. Therefore, the total cost of all three types of beverages is Rs. 684."
Response:  The tree grows at a rate of 7 feet per year, and it takes 30 years to reach its full height of 210 feet. So in total, it will take 210 / 7 = 30 years for the tree to grow from the ground to its full height. Now, let's calculate how much money Charles can make each year from the tree. Since he spends $90 every year to maintain the tree, he makes $210 - $90 = $120 profit each year. Therefore, Charles can make a total of $120 x 30 = $3600 over 30 years.
Response:  Milani has 10 green houses and he wants to distribute them equally among his 5 children. Each child will get 2 greenhouses more than they already have. So, if one of the children already has 3 greenhouses, then that child will get 5 greenhouses from Milani (3 + 2 = 5). If there are 5 weeks left for Milani to distribute the remaining 5 greenhouses, then he will give 1 greenhouse per week to each of his 5 children. Therefore, the final distribution is: Child 1 - 3 greenhouses + 1 greenhouse (from Milani) = 4 greenhouses Child 2 - 2 greenhouses + 1 greenhouse (from Milani) = 3 greenhouses Child 3 - 1 greenhouse + 1 greenhouse (from Milani) = 2 greenhouses Child 4 - 1 greenhouse + 1 greenhouse (from Milani) = 2 greenhouses Child 5 - 1 greenhouse + 1 greenhouse (from Milani) = 2 greenhouses
"Response:  We know that 20 students took a dance class and out of them, 10 were good at dancing (i.e., they got 80% marks). So, the number of students who got less than 60% marks is:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ students\ who\ got\ less\ than\ 60\%\ marks = 20 - 10 = 10 $$

So, there are $ 10$ students who got less than $ 60\%$ marks in the dance class."
Response:  The total cost of purchasing both machines is $5,000 + $8,000 = $13,000.  If we assume that there will be an additional 2.5% markup in Zeeourat's market and 1.2% markup in ElECTRANK's market, then the selling price of each machine would be:  For Zeeourat: ($13,000 x 1.025) = $13,475  For ElECTRANK: ($13,000 x 1.012) = $13,696  Now, if the trader chooses to sell these machines at the end of the year, he/she can expect to earn the following profits:  For Zeeourat: $13,475 x (1 - 0.025) = $13,271  For ElECTRANK: $13,696 x (1 - 0.012) = $13,517  Therefore, if the trader chooses to sell both machines at the end of the year, he/she can expect to earn a total profit of: $13,271 + $13,517 = $26,798
Response:  The two trains are moving in opposite directions at a speed of 80 km/h and 150 km/h respectively. They meet each other after traveling for 2 days. So, we need to find out how much distance they have covered during these 2 days.  Day 1: Train A moves northward at a speed of 80 km/h for 24 hours (i.e., 80 km/h x 24 hours = 1920 km). Distance traveled by Train A = Speed x Time = 1920 km. Day 2: Train B moves southward at a speed of 150 km/h for 24 hours (i.e., 150 km/h x 24 hours = 3600 km). Distance traveled by Train B = Speed x Time = 3600 km. Total distance traveled by both trains during 2 days = Distance traveled by Train A + Distance traveled by Train B = 1920 km + 3600 km = 5520 km. Therefore, the answer is 5520 km.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jil has earned in one year. As he works for 50 weeks in a year and each week he earns $20, then his total annual income is:
$20 x 50 = $1000
Now, let's calculate how much money Chairman has given him as a gift. According to the question, he gave him $30 out of which $15 was spent on buying a chair. So, the remaining amount that Chairman gave him as a gift is:
$30 - ($15/2) = $15
Therefore, Jil received a gift of $15 from Chairman."
Response:  We know that every morning, we drink three cups of tea. So, in total, we drink 3 x 7 = 21 cups of tea per day. Now, each cup contains 80 ml of water, so in total, we consume 21 x 80 = 1680 ml of water per day. Therefore, the answer is 1680 ml.
Response:  If Marysa is traveling at a speed of 12 miles per hour and she has traveled for 4 miles so far, then in her next 2 miles, she will take 2 hours to cover that distance. Therefore, if she continues to travel at this rate, it will take her 8 hours to cover the remaining 2 miles. So, the total time taken by Marysa to cover the entire distance of 6 miles is 10 hours (8 hours + 2 hours).
Response:  We have 10 liters of water in one container and we want to transfer it to another container with a capacity of 24 liters. So, we need to calculate how much water will be left after transferring 10 liters from one container to another.  To do this, we can use the formula: Capacity of new container = Total amount of water - Amount transferred. In this case, the capacity of the new container is 24 liters, and we are transferring 10 liters from the first container, so the amount transferred is also 10 liters. Therefore, the remaining amount of water in the new container is: New container capacity = 24 liters - 10 liters = 14 liters.  So, there will be 14 liters of water left in the new container after transferring 10 liters from the original container.
Response:  Remind is 6 years old now and Samantha is 31 years old. If Remind was born when Samantha was 23 years old, then Remind's age at that time would be 6 - 23 = -17 years old. So, Remind was born 17 years ago.
Response:  The first three balls are sold for $1 each, so the total amount of money Bilie has earned is $3.  For the next two balls, Bilie sells each one for $2, so he earns an additional $4. Therefore, the total amount of money Bilie has earned so far is $7 ($3 + $4).  Finally, Bilie does not sell any more balls, so he keeps the remaining $5 as his profit.  So, Bilie has earned a total of $7 in this game.
Response:  We have one ball (mom) that rolls down a hill every day for 5 days. On each of these days, it takes 2 minutes to roll from the top of the hill to the bottom. After 5 days, how many meters will the ball have traveled?  To find this out, we need to multiply the time taken to roll down the hill by the distance covered per minute. So, in total, the ball will travel 10 meters (2 minutes x 5 days).
"Response:  The book was sold for Rs. 19.50 in the last year, which is 25% less than its original price. So, the original price of the book must be:

Original Price = Sold Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)
= 19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= 25

Therefore, the original price of the book was Rs. 25."
Response:  Mirri has bought an egg for Rs.12, milk for Rs.3, wheat for Rs.1.50, and rice for Rs.8.50 per kg. If she has spent a total of Rs.50, then the number of eggs she has purchased is: Number of eggs = Total amount spent / Price of each item x Quantity of each item Total amount spent = Rs.50 Price of egg = Rs.12 Price of milk = Rs.3 Price of wheat = Rs.1.50/kg Price of rice = Rs.8.50/kg Quantity of egg = Total amount spent / Price of egg Quantity of milk = Total amount spent / Price of milk Quantity of wheat = Total amount spent / Price of wheat Quantity of rice = Total amount spent / Price of rice Now, let's calculate the number of eggs: Number of eggs = Total amount spent / Price of egg = Rs.50 / Rs.12 = 4 eggs Similarly, we can calculate the number of other items as follows: Number of milk = Total amount spent / Price of milk = Rs.50 / Rs.3 = 16 milk packets Number of wheat = Total amount spent / Price of wheat = Rs.50 / (Rs.1.50/kg) = 33.33 kg of wheat Number of rice = Total amount spent / Price of rice = Rs.50 / Rs.8.50 = 6 kg of rice Therefore, Mirri has purchased 4 eggs, 16 milk packets, 33.33 kg of wheat, and 6 kg of rice.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Masika has 3 shirts, 3 pants, and 3 jackets. The cost of one shirt is Rs. 16.50, the cost of one pair of pants is Rs. 22.50, and the cost of one jacket is Rs. 42. Now, to find out how much money Masika spent on clothes, we need to calculate the total cost of all these items. So, the total cost = Cost of 3 shirts + Cost of 3 pants + Cost of 3 jackets = Rs. (16.50 x 3) + Rs. (22.50 x 3) + Rs. (42 x 3) = Rs. 975. Therefore, Masika spent a total of Rs. 975 on clothes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ayesha has invested $4 in Cartman and received 15% interest per annum for 60 days. Therefore, her total earnings from Cartman are: $$ \boxed{A = 4 x (1 + 0.15)^60} $$ Now, we need to find out how much money she will have after 60 days if she invests $4 in Cartman. So, we can use the formula: $$ \boxed{M = P x (1 + r)^n} $$ where M is the final amount of money after n time periods, P is the initial principal amount ($4), r is the annual interest rate (15%/year), and n is the number of time periods (60 days). Substituting the values, we get: $$ \boxed{M = 4 x (1 + 0.15)^60} $$ Simplifying and solving for M, we get: $$ \boxed{M = 4.92} $$ So, after 60 days, Ayesha will have $4.92 more than what she initially invested in Cartman.
Response:  Henry traveled for 60 miles in his car and then turned back after traveling 20 miles further. So, he had covered a total distance of 80 miles (60 + 20). Now, we need to find out how many miles he traveled during each leg of his journey. Since he traveled for 15 miles before turning back, he covered half of the total distance during that leg, which is 40 miles (80 / 2 = 40). Therefore, the answer is 40 miles.
"Response:  Gloria bought 10 pairs of shoes at $50 each, and then she sold them for $30 each. So, her total revenue from selling those shoes was:

$$ \text {Total Revenue} = \text {Number of Pairs of Shoes} \times \text {Selling Price per Pair} $$

Given that Gloria had 20 pairs of shoes in total (including the ones she already owned), and she sold 10 pairs of them, we can calculate the number of pairs of shoes she sold as follows:

$$ \text {Number of Pairs of Shoes Sold} = \text {Total Number of Pairs of Shoes} - \text {Number of Pairs of Shoes Owned} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of Pairs of Shoes Sold} = 20 - 10 = 10 $$

Now, we know that Gloria earned $300 from selling those 10 pairs of shoes ($30 x 10 pairs). Therefore, her total profit from selling those shoes is:

$$ \text {Profit} = \text {Total Revenue} - \text {Cost Price} $$

Since we don't have the cost price of the shoes, let's assume it to be $20 per pair (which is close to the original price Gloria paid for them). Then, we can calculate Gloria's profit as follows:

$$ \text {Profit} = \text {Total Revenue} - \text {Cost Price} = 300 - 20 = 280 $$

So, Gloria made a profit of $280 from selling those 10 pairs of shoes."
Response:  The average age of Derry and Ellen is 7:11 hours. If their combined age is 162 years, then after 10 years from now (i.e., when they are both 82 years old), Derry will be 7 times older than Ellen. So, Derry's age at that time will be: 7 x 7 = 49 years. Therefore, Ellen's age at that time will be: 162 - 49 = 113 years.
Response:  The gambler has been trying to convince his friends that he is winning in the game and wants them to believe him. He says that out of every 100 games, he wins 80 times. One of his friends asks how many times he won more than 20 points above the halfway mark (i.e., 25% of the total score). To calculate this, we need to use basic arithmetic. If the gambler wins 80 times out of 100 games, then he wins 80/100 = 0.8 times the total number of games played. Since there are 100 games in total, the total number of wins is 0.8 x 100 = 80 wins. Now, let's find out how many times he won more than 20 points above the halfway mark. Out of these 80 wins, if he won more than 20 points above the halfway mark (i.e., 25% of the total score), then it means he won 80 x 0.25 = 20 times. Therefore, the gambler won 20 times more than 20 points above the halfway mark.
Response:  We know that there are 10 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, total hours in a week is: 10 x 24 = 240 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours Jan can spend with his friends in a day. As per the question, he spends 0.5 hours with them every day. Therefore, total hours spent with friends in a week is: 240 hours / 0.5 hours/day = 480 hours.
"Response:  We know that there are 110 skunks in total and 30 of them belong to Chandi. So, the number of skunks belonging to Gretchen is:
Gretchen's skunks = Total skunks - Number of skunks belonging to Chandi
= 110 - 30
= 80
Therefore, Gretchen has 80 skunks."
Response:  Shobhan has 2 less than half of Haroon's friends, which means he has $\frac{1}{2}$ of Haroon's friends. Since Haroon has $5$ more friends than Remand, Remand has $\frac{5}{2} = \boxed{3}$ more friends than Shobhan. Therefore, Shobhan has $\boxed{3 + 2 - 2 = 3}$ fewer friends than Remand.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes (i.e., 40/2 = 20), he scored 4 points.  In the next 20 minutes (i.e., 40 - 20 = 20), he scored 25 more points, which is equal to 25 x 2 = 50 points in total. Therefore, he scored 4 + 50 = 54 points in total.
Response:  We know that there are 2 yogurt cups in one day and currently they cost $5 each. So, in total, we have spent $10 on yogurt in one day. Now, if the price of yogurt increases to $6 per cup, how much will we spend on yogurt in one day?  To find out, we just need to multiply the number of yogurt cups by their new price: $6 x 2 = $12. Therefore, in one day, we will spend $12 on yogurt if its price increases to $6 per cup.
Response:  According to the question, Jan has sold all his assets and now he is left with only 13 legs. Each leg costs him $15, so he spent a total of $195 on buying those legs. Now, there are 8 video game consoles that he wants to buy, each costing $20 per unit. So, in total, he needs $160 to buy all these consoles. However, since he doesn't have enough money, he can only afford to buy 4 units at a time, which means he will need to make 4 purchases of $40 each ($160 / 4 = $40). Therefore, the number of legs Jan has after making these purchases is: $195 - (4 x $40) = $155.
Response:  The man walks for 60 miles in 7 days. So he covers an average distance of 86 miles per day (60/7 = 86). Now, we know that he spends 3 hours and 2 hours respectively in the first and second days. Therefore, his speed is: Speed = Distance / Time = 86 / 3 + 86 / 2 = 43.5 km/h.
Response:  If Dania can walk for 3 miles in 20 minutes, then she can cover 1 mile in 5 minutes (3/20).  Now, if she walks at this rate for 6 hours (6 x 60 = 360 minutes), she will have covered 360 / 5 = 72 miles. So, her total distance traveled is 72 miles.
Response:  We know that Ben has $100 in his bank account and he spends $20 every year to maintain it. So, after one year, Ben will have $80 left in his bank account ($100 - $20). Now, we are told that Bein's bank account balance is four times bigger than Ben's. Therefore, Bein's bank account balance is $320 (4 x $80 = $320).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Perg has 400 feet of height and Farbo has 1000 feet of height. Now, let's assume that both Perg and Farbo are equally tall, so their height ratio is 1:2 (i.e., 1000/400 = 2). Therefore, if Perg throws his stone at Farbo from a distance of 300 feet, then Farbo will receive the impact of the stone after 300 / 2 = 150 feet. However, since Farbo is much taller than Perg, he can throw his stone back at Perg with an acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2, which means it will take 150 / 9.8 = 15.2 seconds for the stone to reach Perg. So, in total, it will take 15.2 + 150 = 165.2 seconds for Farbo's stone to hit Perg.
"Response:  According to the given information, Dawood Janz has prepared five different types of dishes for each of the 20 guests invited to his dinner party. This means that he has prepared a total of 100 dishes (5 x 20 = 100). Now, we are asked how many tikas he gave to each guest. The word ""tika"" is used in the context of food, which means a small portion or bite of food. So, Dawood Janz gave 8 tikas to each of the 20 guests, which means he gave a total of 160 tikas (8 x 20 = 160) to all the guests together."
Response:  If the daily energy intake is 2500 kcal and you have 5 meals per day of 300 grams each, then your total daily calorie intake would be: 2500 x 5 = 12,500 kcal. However, if you had already consumed 1800 kcal before starting your diet plan to reach your goal of 2000 kcal, then your remaining daily calorie deficit would be: 1800 - 12,500 = -9750 kcal. Therefore, you need to consume an additional 9750 kcal from other sources (e.g., exercise or reducing your body weight) to achieve your desired daily calorie intake of 2000 kcal.
Response:  If Charlie can make one mug of tea for $10 and each mug contains 5 cups (or 120ml) of tea, then he can produce 60 mugs of tea per hour ($10 / $0.12 per cup). Therefore, if he produces 20 mugs of tea in an hour, his total earnings will be:  Total earnings = Number of mugs produced x Price per mug = 20 mugs x $10/mug = $200 per hour.
Response:  According to the question, Mirriam has been writing articles related to health for four years and has published over 100 articles. She writes one article every day and her blog gets around 500 visitors per day. In the past seven days, she wrote five articles and increased the number of articles from two to five. Therefore, in these seven days, Mirriam wrote approximately 35 articles (5 x 7 = 35).
Response:  According to the question, Kinsey has 80 posts in her big shop and she sold 220 different types of clothes. So, the total number of posts she sold is 80 x 220 = 17600. If she had 23 extra posts left after selling all the stock, then the remaining number of posts would be 17600 - 23 = 17577.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 100 red cars and 50 blue cars in the market. The price of each red car is Rs. 60,000 more than that of each blue car. So, if we buy one red car, it will cost us Rs. (60,000 + x), where x is the price of a blue car. Since there are 50 blue cars, their total cost is Rs. 50 \* 50 = Rs. 2,500. Therefore, the total cost of buying one red car is Rs. (60,000 + x) + Rs. 2,500 = Rs. 62,500.
Response:  The truck had 4 tires and each tire had 6 lug nuts. So, in total, there were 24 lug nuts (4 tires x 6 lug nuts per tire).
"Response:  We know that there are 15 apartments in the building and each apartment has 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is:

15 apartments x 8 units per apartment = 120 units

Now, we need to find out how much of the building is occupied. The question states that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that:

Occupied area = Total area / 4

Occupied area = 120 units x (3/4) = 90 units

So, the total number of units in the building that are occupied is 90."
"Response:  The average height of an adult male in Pakistan is around 5 feet 9 inches (69 inches). Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the number of inches in 252 days as follows:

252 days x 12 inches/foot = 3024 inches

Now, since each inch represents 0.08333333 feet, we can convert the total number of inches to feet as follows:

3024 inches / 12 inches/foot = 252 feet

Therefore, if an adult male in Pakistan grows approximately 252 feet tall over a period of 252 days, his growth rate would be roughly 1 foot per day."
Response:  The train travels at a speed of 10 km/h for 5 hours, then it slows down to 5 km/h and travels for another 3 hours. So, in total, the train covers a distance of 10 x 5 = 50 km during the first part of its journey. Then, it travels at a constant speed of 5 km/h for 2 hours, covering a distance of 5 x 2 = 10 km. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the train is 50 + 10 = 60 km.
"Response:  If there are 15 big books and each book weighs 2 pounds (or 0.9 kg), then the total weight of all big books is:

15 x 2 = 30 pounds (or 13.6 kg)

Now, if there are 30 small books and each book weighs half a pound (or 0.2 kg), then the total weight of all small books is:

30 x 0.5 = 15 pounds (or 6.8 kg)

So, in total, there are 45 pounds (or 20.4 kg) of books."
Response:  The machine can make 3 trucks and 4 cars in one hour. So, it takes 3 x 4 = 12 hours to make all of them (3 trucks + 4 cars). Now, let's calculate how many days it would take for the machine to produce $1000 worth of goods at this rate. If we assume that each truck is worth $500 and each car is worth $200, then the total value of goods produced in 12 hours is: $500 x 3 trucks + $200 x 4 cars = $1500. To find out how many days it would take for the machine to produce $1000 worth of goods, we divide the total value of goods produced ($1500) by the amount of money earned per day ($100): $1500 / $100 = 15 days. Therefore, based on these calculations, the machine could potentially earn $1000 worth of goods in 15 days.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are seven children of Mrs. Doubtfire who have grown up with their fathers and mothers separately after their parents got divorced.  Now, we need to find out how many of these children are from each mother.  From the information given earlier, we know that Mrs. Doubtfire has two daughters and one son. So, there are three children from her side (two daughters and one son).  Similarly, Mr. Doubtfire also has two daughters and one son. Therefore, there are three children from his side as well (two daughters and one son).  In total, then, there are six children - three from Mrs. Doubtfire and three from Mr. Doubtfire.
Response:  Genie can grant only three wishes to each person. So far, she has granted two wishes to one person. To fulfill the third wish, she needs to find another person who hasn't been granted any wishes yet. Since there are 30 people in total, and 2 have already been granted wishes, there are 28 remaining people who haven't been granted any wishes yet. Therefore, Genie can grant up to 28 big wishes.
Response:  If Peter has been watching movies for 8 hours at $7 per ticket and $7 per popcorn, he has spent a total of $56 (8 hours x $7 per hour + $7 per popcorn). So, if he has $42 left after buying tickets to watch movies for 42 times, then he can afford to buy movie tickets for 10 more times ($42 / $7 = 6 times). Therefore, Peter can afford to buy movie tickets for 10 more times or 40 times in total.
Response:  The weight of one car is 5000 pounds and each jeep has a weight of 15 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of all cars and jeeps together is: 5000 x number of cars = 5000 x x where x is the number of cars. Similarly, the total weight of all trucks and trailers together is: 3755 x number of trucks + 3755 x number of trailers = 3755 x (x + y) where x is the number of trucks and y is the number of trailers. Now, we are given that there are no more than 20 cars and 10 trucks and trailers in total. So, the maximum possible weight of all vehicles together is: Maximum weight = 5000 x x + 3755 x (x + y) = 5000 x x + 3755 x y Substituting the values, we get: Maximum weight = 5000 x x + 3755 x y = 5000 x 20 + 3755 x 10 = 100000 + 37550 = 137550 pounds. Therefore, the maximum possible weight of all vehicles together is 137550 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, Stephen sold his artwork for $40 per piece, and he had 25 pieces in total. So, he earned $1000 from that sale ($40 x 25 = $1000). Then, he gave 25% of that amount to charity, which is $250 (($1000 x 25%) / 100). Now, he has $750 left after giving to charity ($1000 - $250 = $750). Finally, he spent $4 dollars on each of the remaining four pieces, so he spent a total of $16 ($4 x 4 = $16). Therefore, his final profit after all these calculations is $734 ($750 - $16 = $734).
Response:  We have 20 raspberries in one jar and 6 clusters of raspberries in another jar. So, we can calculate the total number of raspberries as follows: Total no. of raspberries = No. of raspberries in one jar + No. of raspberries in another jar Total no. of raspberries = 20 + 6 x 5 (since each cluster has 5 raspberries) Total no. of raspberries = 20 + 30 = 50 raspberries. Therefore, there are 50 raspberries in both jars combined.
Response:  We have 25 balls in total, and one of them is defective (not working). So, there are 24 good balls left. Out of these 24 good balls, 20 are not broken, which means they are working properly. Therefore, we have 4 good balls that are not broken or working properly.
Response:  Firstly, he invested $500 in the business and then earned $800 more as profit. So, his total earnings are $1300 ($500 + $800). Now, he has to pay taxes of 10% on this amount, which is $130 (10% of $1300). Therefore, he will have $1170 left after paying taxes ($1300 - $130 = $1170).
Response:  If he worked for 40 years at $50,000 per year, his total earnings would be: 40 x $50,000 = $2,000,000 Now, after 20 years of retirement, his annual pension is reduced by 5% each year, so his pension after 20 years would be: $2,000,000 x (1 - 0.05) = $1,900,000 Therefore, if he continued working for another 10 years after that, his total earnings during those 10 years would be: $1,900,000 x 10 = $19,000,000 So, his total earnings over his entire career would be: $2,000,000 + $19,000,000 = $21,000,000
Response:  Firstly, Ali has received Rs. 140 as monthly allowance from his company for 6 years. If he invests this amount every year at an interest rate of 10%, then after 6 years, he will have accumulated Rs. 720 (Rs. 140 x 5 years). Now, if we assume that he continues to invest this amount every year until the end of the 10th year, then he will have accumulated a total of Rs. 1,380 (Rs. 720 x 2 times). Therefore, the final balance in Ali's account after 10 years is Rs. 1,380.
Response:  The speed of the tractor is 10 km/h and it takes 100 meters to cover one mile. Therefore, the time taken to cover one mile = distance / speed = 100 m / 10 km/h = 10 seconds. So, Sofia can cover 1 mile in 10 seconds.
Response:  The person watches TV for 2 hours and then sleeps for 8 hours. So in total, they spend 10 hours (2 + 8) awake during the daytime. Now, let's calculate how many times they check their phone during these 10 hours. Since they check their phone every hour, they check it 4 times during the daytime (10 hours / 2 = 5 checks). Therefore, the person checks their phone 4 times during the daytime.
Response:  School A has 40 students in its basketball team and 30 students in its cricket team. School B has 20 students in its basketball team and 15 students in its cricket team. School C has 30 students in its basketball team and 20 students in its cricket team. School D has 25 students in its basketball team and 15 students in its cricket team. And finally, School E has 15 students in its basketball team and 10 students in its cricket team. So, altogether, all five schools have 180 students (40 + 30 + 20 + 30 + 25 + 15) in their basketball teams and 90 students (30 + 20 + 15 + 10) in their cricket teams.
"Response:  The given sentence is: ""ایک خزانہ کا شکار کرنے والے نے ایک دفن شدہ خزانہ کا صندوق پایا جو جواہرات سے بھرا ہوا تھا۔"" (A person who had stolen a valuable vase from a museum has returned it to the museum with some other objects that he had taken from there.) Now let's count the number of objects that the thief took from the museum and returned along with the vase: 1. The vase itself (which was the most valuable object). 2. Other objects that the thief took from the museum. Total number of objects = 2. Therefore, there were two objects in total that the thief took from the museum and returned along with the vase."
Response:  Dr. Vertz's school has 120 students in total, including boys and girls. If there are 60 boys and 60 girls, then the number of girls is equal to the number of boys. Therefore, the number of girls = 60. Now, we have to find out how many girls are studying under each teacher. Since there are 5 teachers, the number of girls studying under each teacher is: Number of girls per teacher = Total number of girls / Number of teachers = 60 / 5 = 12 girls. So, there are 12 girls studying under each of the 5 teachers.
Response:  The bill is $80 and there are 8 hours in a day. So, if Bill works for 8 hours a day, he will earn $80/8 = $10 per hour. Now, if Bill works for 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), then his total income for those 5 days is $10 x 5 = $50. Therefore, Bill has earned $50 + $80 = $130 in total.
Response:  The teacher gives 5 classes every day and 8 classes on Fridays, so in total he teaches 30 classes per week (5 x 7 = 35 + 8). If each class has 15 students and the teacher charges Rs. 15 per student, then the total amount of money earned by the teacher in one week is: 35 classes x 15 students/class x Rs. 15/student = Rs. 2250. So, if the teacher works for 4 weeks, his total earnings would be: Rs. 2250 x 4 = Rs. 8000.
Response:  There are two types of information given in the question: 1) Information about the number of options available for each subject and 2) Information about the difficulty level of each option.  Based on these two pieces of information, we can calculate the total number of options that Kelvin has to choose from.  Option 1: Number of options available for each subject = 20 (as mentioned in the question) Option 2: Difficulty level of each option = easy or medium (not specified in the question) Now, let's assume that there are equal numbers of easy and medium-level options available for each subject. In this case, the total number of options that Kelvin has to choose from would be: Total number of options = 20 x 5 = 100 Therefore, Kelvin has 100 options to choose from.
"Response:  Tomi has 43 rupees and Pinky has 23 rupees. If they both equally share their money among themselves, then each of them will get:

Tomi's share = 43 / 2 = 21 rupees
Pinky's share = 23 / 2 = 11.50 rupees
So, the total amount of money that Tomi and Pinky have after sharing it equally is:

Tomi's money + Pinky's money = 21 + 11.50 = 32.50 rupees"
"Response:  Shelia sold 150 phones in 2 months at Rs. 150 each. Therefore, her total revenue was:
Revenue = Number of phones x Price per phone
= 150 x Rs. 150
= Rs. 22,500
Now, let's calculate Shelia's profit for each month:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
= Rs. 22,500 - (Cost of producing one phone)
We are given that it takes 5 minutes to produce one phone and Shelia spent 10 days working on these phones. So, the cost of producing one phone is:
Cost of producing one phone = Total time spent / Time taken to produce one phone
= 10 days / 5 minutes/phone
= Rs. 200/phone
Therefore, Shelia's profit for each month would be:
Profit = Rs. 22,500 - (Rs. 200/phone)
= Rs. 22,300/month
So, Shelia made a profit of Rs. 22,300 every month for 3 months."
Response:  We know that there are three types of flowers being sold in the market - Marigolds, Petunias and Begonias. The price of each type of flower is given as follows: Marigolds = Rs. 2.74 per bunch, Petunias = Rs. 1.87 per bunch, and Begonias = Rs. 2.12 per bunch. Now, we need to find out how many bunches of each type of flower can be purchased with Rs. 100. To do this, we will divide the cost of each type of flower by its selling price. For example, if we want to know how many bunches of Marigolds can be purchased with Rs. 100, we will divide Rs. 2.74 (cost) by Rs. 2.74 (selling price), which gives us approximately 36 bunches. Similarly, for Petunias, we get approximately 150 bunches, and for Begonias, we get approximately 50 bunches. So, if an arti has 12 bunches of Marigolds, it means that she has approximately 36 x 12 = 432 Marigold buds. Similarly, if she has 9 bunches of Petunias, it means that she has approximately 150 x 9 = 1350 Petunia buds, and if she has 17 bunches of Begonias, it means that she has approximately 50 x 17 = 850 Begonia buds.
Response:  The coastline of Samundar is increasing at a rate of $20 \text{ km}$ per year. There are $4$ levels of depth in the ocean, and each level has a width of $16 \text{ km}$. If the coastline is currently at level $3$, then how much distance does it cover? We can find this out by multiplying the width of each level with the number of levels. So, the total distance covered by the coastline will be: $\boxed{96 \text{ km}}.$
Response:  Dr. Sisi has been eating one meal per day for 180 days straight. If he eats 3 meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), then in total, he has eaten 3 x 3 = 9 meals during this period. Now, if we assume that each meal contains 110 calories, then Dr. Sisi has consumed a total of 9 x 110 = 990 calories per day. Therefore, over the course of 180 days, he has consumed a total of 990 x 180 = 176,200 calories.
Response:  If Remy has cooked half of the dishes and Sarrah has cooked 4 times as many dishes as Remy, then Remy has cooked 4/2 = 2 dishes. Since Remy has cooked 2 dishes and Sarrah has cooked 400 dishes, Sarrah has cooked 400 - 2 = 398 more dishes than Remy.
"Response:  We have to sell 3 bunches of flowers for Rs. 2.50 each or 2 bunches for Rs. 1 each. So, we can sell them in either of these two options:

Option A: Sell 3 bunches of flowers for Rs. 2.50 each = Rs. 7.50 per bunch (Rs. 2.50 x 3)
Option B: Sell 2 bunches of flowers for Rs. 1 each = Rs. 2 per bunch (Rs. 1 x 2)
So, the total amount we can earn from selling these flowers is:
Rs. 7.50 + Rs. 2 = Rs. 9.50
Therefore, the correct answer is Rs. 9.50."
Response:  The cat has been given Rs. 100 as its price and Groumer has offered it a discount of 30%. So, the new price of the cat after the discount is: New Price = Old Price x (1 - Discount Percentage) = Rs. 100 x (1 - 0.30) = Rs. 70 Now, we need to find out how many cats can be bought with this amount. Number of Cats = Total Amount / Price of Each Cat = Rs. 70 / Rs. 100 = 0.7 or 7/10 cats Can you buy 7/10 cats with Rs. 70?
Response:  Two girls are sharing 24 liters of water in two equal parts. So each girl will get 12 liters of water (1/2 x 24 = 12). Now, one of the girls has to give 6 liters of water to another girl. So, after this transfer, the first girl will have 6 liters of water left (12 - 6 = 6), and the second girl will have 18 liters of water (6 + 12 = 18).
Response:  According to the given information, Charlie has 10 steak knives and he sold 21 of them to someone else. So, the number of steak knives left with Charlie is 21 - 10 = 11.  Then, Charlie bought 23 steak knives for his own use. Therefore, the total number of steak knives that Charlie has now is 11 + 23 = 34.  Finally, Charlie gave away 9 steak knives to his wife and kept 28 for himself. So, the number of steak knives left with Charlie after giving them away is 34 - 9 = 25.
Response:  We know that Alex has a weight of 70 kg and Gris has a weight of 125 kg. To find out how much less than Gris's weight is Alex's weight, we need to subtract their weights. So, the difference between their weights is: 125 kg - 70 kg = 55 kg. Therefore, Alex's weight is 55 kg less than Gris's weight.
Response:  Denny has 3 gallons of water in each jar. Each jar contains 25 gallons of water. Therefore, there are 3 x 25 = 75 gallons of water in total. Now, we need to find out how many cans fit in this amount of water. There are 8 cups in 1 gallon, so there are 75 / 8 = 9 cans that can fit in the total amount of water.

The third time, Aliarm sat again and this time Griggy made him sit fifteen times. Finally, the fourth time Aliarm sat, Griggy made him sit twenty-five times. So, in total, Aliarm sat twenty-five times as per the given information.
Response:  The company gives each employee Rs. 600 per month as an allowance.  If we assume that this amount is tax-free (which may not be true), then the total annual benefit for each employee would be Rs. 7200 (Rs. 600 x 12 months).  Now, let's consider the situation where an employee has been working for the company for five years. In that case, the total annual benefit for that employee would be Rs. 36,000 (Rs. 7200 x 5 years).  However, if the employee continues to work for the company beyond five years, their annual benefit will increase by 10% every year, starting from the sixth year. So, in the tenth year, the annual benefit for that employee would be Rs. 49,200 (Rs. 36,000 + (10% of Rs. 36,000) x 10 years).
"Response:  According to the given information, Marlboro has sold 88,000 cigarettes in total. Now, we need to find out how many cigarettes Harald sold if he had 10 times more customers than Marlboro. So, if Marlboro sold 88,000 cigarettes and each customer bought an average of 20 cigarettes (which is a rough estimate), then Harald would have sold:

Harald's sales = Marlboro's sales x Number of customers
= 88,000 x 10
= 880,000 cigarettes
Therefore, Harald sold 880,000 cigarettes."
Response:  Karachi is a city with a population of over 20 million people and has been facing water shortages for several years. The government has announced that it will provide each household with 75 liters of water per day, but due to various reasons, this target has not been achieved yet. There are 16 employees in the Water Supply Department who have been assigned to distribute water among these households. Each employee can carry 2 buckets (containing 75 liters of water) at a time. How many trips will they need to make to deliver water to all the households? Solution: To calculate the number of trips required, we need to divide the total amount of water needed (75 liters x 16 households = 1,200 liters) by the capacity of each bucket (75 liters). Therefore, the number of trips required would be: Number of trips = Total amount of water / Capacity of each bucket = 1,200 liters / 75 liters = 16 trips So, the employees in the Water Supply Department will need to make 16 trips to deliver water to all the households in Karachi.
Response:  If we have 10 balloons and want to distribute them equally among 5 children, each child will get 2 balloons (10/5 = 2).  Now let's assume that there are 20 adults and 5 children in total. If we want to distribute the remaining balloons equally among all these people, including both adults and children, then each person will get 4 balloons (20 + 5 = 25 / 7 = 3.57). Since we can't give fractional balloons, each person will get 4 balloons approximately. Therefore, the final distribution of balloons is as follows: Adults - 20 balloons Children - 5 balloons Total - 25 balloons Approximately - 4 balloons per person.
Response:  There are three types of people in society - rich, middle class and poor.  The number of paltry janitors is equal to the number of sandy beaches multiplied by the number of wealthy people. If there are four sandy beaches, then the number of paltry janitors is equal to four times the number of wealthy people. Therefore, if there are 10 wealthy people, then there will be 40 paltry janitors (10 x 4 = 40).
Response:  According to the given information, we have four cousins - Emily, Jack, Kate, and James.  Emily is 25 years old, Jack is 30 years old, Kate is 27 years old, and James is 10 years old. If James is 10 years old, then he was born when Emily was 15 years old (Emily's age minus James's age = 15). Therefore, Emily is currently 25 + 15 = 40 years old. Similarly, if Jack is 30 years old now, he was born when Kate was 23 years old (Kate's age minus Jack's age = 23). So, Kate is currently 27 + 23 = 50 years old.
Response:  If Lily can make 400 meters in 2 seconds, then she can cover 400 meters in 1 second as well.  Now, if Jerry can run at a speed of 10% faster than Lily, then he can cover 400 meters in 0.96 seconds (since 10% of 2 seconds is 0.2 seconds).  So, Jerry can cover 400 meters in 0.96 seconds.  Therefore, there are 400/0.96 = 417.75 meters between Lily and Jerry after running for 0.96 seconds.
Response:  If there are 12 dogs in one house and each dog has 4 puppies, then the total number of puppies is 12 x 4 = 48.  Now, if there are 5 houses with the same number of dogs (i.e., 12), then the total number of dogs in all 5 houses is 5 x 12 = 60.  Since each dog has 4 puppies, the total number of puppies in all 5 houses is also 60. Therefore, there are 60 puppies in all.
Response:  Out of 200 teachers in grade 5, 120 are men (60%) and 80 are women (40%). Among these male teachers, 2/5 are fathers of girls (40%), while among female teachers, 2/3 are mothers of boys (67%). So, out of all the girls, 40% are daughters of fathers who are teachers, and 53% are daughters of mothers who are teachers. Similarly, out of all the boys, 40% are sons of fathers who are teachers, and 57% are sons of mothers who are teachers. Therefore, there are 40 + 53 = 93 girls and 40 + 57 = 97 boys in the school.
Response:  Jamie had 20 friends and each friend gave him $10 for a total of $200. Herry received $20 from James and he spent $15 on something. So, Herry has $18 left ($20 - $15 = $18).
"Response:  We know that Freda has 32 onions in her bag and each onion weighs approximately 0.5 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the onions in Freda's bag is:

32 onions x 0.5 kg/onion = 16 kg

Now, let's calculate how many tamatar (tomatoes) are required to make up for the difference in weight between the actual weight of the onions and the weight mentioned in the question:

Actual weight of onions = 16 kg
Weight mentioned in the question = 32 kg
Difference in weight = 32 kg - 16 kg = 16 kg

To find out how many tomatoes are required to make up for this difference, we need to divide the difference in weight by the weight of one tomato:

16 kg / 0.5 kg/tomato = 32 tomatoes

Therefore, Freda has 32 tomatoes in her bag."
Response:  In the first 15 minutes of the trip (0-15 minutes), only 5 cars can pass through the toll plaza. Therefore, in this time frame, 5 x 5 = 25 cars will be able to pass through the toll plaza. Now, let's assume that there are 30 cars in total on the motorway at this point in time. This means that after 15 minutes, 25 / 30 = 83% of the total number of cars will have passed through the toll plaza. So, out of 30 cars, 25 cars will have passed through the toll plaza in the first 15 minutes of the trip.
Response:  Mariam has 18 bags of potatoes and she wants to distribute them equally among her 40 friends. Each friend will get 2 bags (1 bag = 4 kg). So, the total number of bags that Mariam will give to each friend is:  Number of friends x Total weight of potatoes per friend = 40 friends x 2 bags/friend = 80 bags. Therefore, Mariam will have 80 bags left after distributing them all.
Response:  Firstly, the first friend gave 20 slaps to Jerry while he was sleeping. Then, the second friend gave 1/4 of his share (i.e., 15 slaps) to the third friend in their confrontation. Finally, the third friend gave 3 times as many slaps as the second friend (i.e., 45 slaps) to Jerry. Therefore, if the total number of slaps given by all three friends is calculated, it would be: 20 + 15 + 45 = 80 slaps.
Response:  Solu has written 4 pages of his own book, Samaji has written 20 pages of his social science book, Tariq has written 7 pages of his history book, and Jaghraafiya has written 8 pages of her geography book. If Solu needs to read all these books in one day, he will need at least 3 days to finish reading them.
Response:  The man drinks one glass of water every day at noon and another glass after dinner. He also drinks one glass of water before going to bed every night. So in total, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day (1 for lunch + 1 for dinner + 1 for bedtime). Since there are 7 days in a week, he drinks 21 glasses of water in a week (3 x 7 = 21).
Response:  The distance between two cities is 10 miles. There are 3 miles in one mile. So, the total distance between the two cities is 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Now, if we want to find out how many miles are there between each city and the center of the first city, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. Since the speed is constant at 42 miles per hour, we just need to calculate the time it takes for the first city to reach the center of the second city. To do this, we divide the distance (30 miles) by the speed (42 miles/hour): Time = Distance / Speed = 30 / 42 = 0.71 hours. Therefore, it will take approximately 0.71 hours or 43 minutes for the first city to reach the center of the second city.
Response:  We have 100 coins and we want to divide them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 25 coins (100/4 = 25). Now, let's say that one of these people has already taken 3 coins from the remaining 27 coins (27 - 3 = 24). So, now there are 24 coins left for the other three people. Therefore, each of them will get 8 coins (24/3 = 8).
Response:  If Imran Khan has 50 cookies and he gives 10 to Amir, then Amir will have 40 cookies (50 - 10 = 40). Now if Amir has 40 cookies and he shares them equally among his 5 friends, each friend will get 8 cookies (40 / 5 = 8). So, the final number of cookies that each friend gets is 8.
Response:  There are three houses with different dimensions as follows: House A - 20 feet x 15 feet = 300 square feet House B - 25 feet x 18 feet = 450 square feet House C - 30 feet x 20 feet = 600 square feet Now, we need to find out the total area of all three houses combined. To do this, we multiply the length and width of each house: Total Area = (House A) x 20 x 15 + (House B) x 25 x 18 + (House C) x 30 x 20 = 300 + 450 + 600 = 1350 square feet Therefore, the total area of all three houses is 1350 square feet.
Response:  Per and Mangal have to work for 7 hours every day from Monday to Friday. So in total they will work for 7 x 5 = 35 hours per week. Now, if they take breaks of 15 minutes each during their lunch break (which is not mentioned in the question), then they will actually spend time working for 35 - 2 = 33 hours per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, they will work for 33 / 7 = 4.67 hours per day on average. Therefore, if they work for 7 consecutive days without any breaks, they will work for 4.67 x 7 = 32.99 hours in total.
Response:  Henry has been making cookies for 2 years now and he has made 15 more batches of cookies than he had initially. So, in total, Henry has made 36 batches of cookies (15 + 21). Now, out of these 36 batches, he has given away 5 batches to his friends as gifts, leaving him with 31 batches of cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies that Henry has made so far is 31 x 15 = 465 cookies.
Response:  The price of one GIS station is $ 20. If an EP company buys 10 GIS stations, they will have to pay $ 20 x 10 = $ 200. So, if someone buys 10 GIS stations, they will get $ 200 in return.
Response:  The first person has sent 50 balls to the second person and received 37 balls back. Now, let's calculate how many balls each of them has after this exchange.  For the first person, they have given away 50 balls and received 37 balls back, so their remaining balance is: (50 - 37) = 13 balls.  For the second person, they have received 50 balls from the first person and gave away 37 balls, so their remaining balance is: (37 + 50) = 87 balls.  Therefore, the difference between their balances is: 87 - 13 = 74 balls.
Response:  The boat was sailing in the sea and had traveled 64 miles downstream. To reach the shore, it took 5 hours to travel upstream against the current of 2 knots per hour. So, the distance traveled by the boat while sailing with the current is: Distance = Speed x Time = 2 knots/hour x 5 hours = 10 miles Now, let's find out how much water Julia had in her canoe. She had 7 liters of water before she started sailing and drank 3 liters during the journey. So, the amount of water left in the canoe after the journey is: Amount of water left = Original amount - Water consumed = 7 liters - 3 liters = 4 liters Therefore, there were 4 liters of water left in Julia's canoe when she reached the shore.
Response:  There are 4 students in each group and each student takes turns to hold the whiteboard for 1 minute. Since there are 8 groups, the total time spent holding the whiteboard is 8 x 4 = 32 minutes. Now, since each teacher has to take turns with all the students in their group, the total time spent by each teacher holding the whiteboard is 8 x 2 = 16 minutes. Therefore, if the teachers spend an equal amount of time holding the whiteboard every day, then they will have to spend 16/8 = 2 minutes per day holding the whiteboard.
Response:  We are given that 2 plants were planted in the garden 15 days ago and now there are only 5 plants left. So, we need to find out how many plants will be left after 15 more days if 2 new plants are added every day. To do this, we can use the formula for population growth: P = P0 x (1 + r)^n, where P is the number of plants at time n, P0 is the initial number of plants (which was 2), r is the rate of growth per day (which is 2 since 2 new plants are added every day), and n is the time in days. Substituting the values, we get: P = 2 x (1 + 0.04)^(n+15) Now, we want to know how many plants will be left after 15 more days, so we substitute n=36 (since it has been 15 days already and we want to know how many plants will be left after another 15 days). Solving for P, we get: P = 2 x (1 + 0.04)^36 ≈ 8.79 Since there are currently 5 plants left, we can conclude that there will be approximately 8.79 plants left in the garden after 15 more days.
"Response:  According to the question, in Barton's phone, there are 300 pictures of cats. If we assume that each picture has an average size of 1 MB, then the total size of all cat pictures in Barton's phone would be:

300 pictures x 1 MB per picture = 300 MB

Now, let's calculate how many cat pictures can fit in Jamal's phone with 1800 photos. Since each photo takes up approximately 1 MB of space, if we divide the total storage capacity of Jamal's phone (1800 photos x 1 MB per photo) by the size of one cat picture (300 MB), we get:

1800 photos / 300 MB per photo = 6 times more than the number of cat pictures in Barton's phone

Therefore, there are at least 6 times as many cat pictures in Jamal's phone as there are in Barton's phone."
Response:  Firstly, Saashaa has earned Rs. 50 in the last two months as interest on his savings of Rs. 10,000. So, he now has Rs. 10,500 in total.  Secondly, he bought one lakh rupees worth of shares at Rs. 10 per share. Therefore, he spent Rs. 10,000 on buying those shares. Thirdly, if we assume that each share is currently valued at Rs. 16, then the total value of the five shares he owns is Rs. 80,000 (Rs. 16 x 5). Fourthly, since he already has Rs. 10,500 from his savings and earns an additional Rs. 50 every month, he now has a total of Rs. 11,000 in liquid cash. Fifthly, to calculate how much profit he made from selling those shares, we need to subtract the amount he spent on buying them (Rs. 10,000) from their current market value (Rs. 80,000), which gives us a profit of Rs. 70,000 (Rs. 80,000 - Rs. 10,000). Lastly, considering that he sold all five shares together, the profit per share would be Rs. 14,000 (Rs. 70,000 / 5 shares).
Response:  If he has 120 chais and each cha contains 7-1/3 cups of tea leaves and 1 cup of water, then he has used 840 cups of water (120 x 7/3). Now, if he has used 840 cups of water, then he must have made 840 / 7 = 116 teaspoons of tea. Therefore, he has made 116 teaspoons of tea.
Response:  We have three children and each child costs $60. So, if we buy two children, the total cost will be $120 ($60 x 2). If we buy one child, the cost is $60 only. Therefore, he has bought 2 children.
Response:  The first day, one accountant deposited Rs. 100 in each of two containers labeled A and B. On the second day, another accountant added Rs. 50 to container A and withdrew Rs. 40 from container B. On the third day, yet another accountant added Rs. 75 to container C and withdrew Rs. 60 from container D. Finally, on the fourth day, an additional Rs. 25 was added to container E. So, at the end of four days, there were 30 gariyas (containers) filled with money in the central bank. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money in all 30 gariyas:  Day 1: 2 containers, each containing Rs. 100 = Rs. 200 Day 2: 1 container, containing Rs. 50 + Rs. 40 = Rs. 90 Day 3: 1 container, containing Rs. 75 + Rs. 60 = Rs. 135 Day 4: 1 container, containing Rs. 25 = Rs. 25 Total amount of money in all 30 gariyas = Rs. 200 + Rs. 90 + Rs. 135 + Rs. 25 = Rs. 450
Response:  The total amount of money that Adrian and Lily had after 3 years was $30,000 more than what they had initially. So, if they had $100,000 initially, their total amount of money after 3 years would be: $100,000 + ($30,000 x 3) = $130,000. Now, let's assume that Adrian and Lily invested $40,000 each in different assets for 4 years before they got married. After 4 years, Adrian's investment grew to $64,000 (40,000 x 1.5), while Lily's investment grew to $80,000 (40,000 x 2). Therefore, their combined total amount of money after 7 years would be: Adrian's money + Lily's money = $64,000 + $80,000 = $144,000. Finally, if they got married after 7 years and Adrian gave Lily $40,000 as dowry, then their combined total amount of money after marriage would be: $144,000 - $40,000 = $104,000.
Response:  If Megan uses two pens per day for seven days, she will use a total of 14 pens (2 x 7 = 14). Since each pen contains 30 ink cartridges, Megan will use a total of 420 ink cartridges (14 x 30 = 420) over those seven days.
Response:  Morrison has 5 apples and 8 oranges in total. For every apple that Morrison gives to Kel, Kel gets 2 oranges. So, if Morrison gives an apple to Kel, then Kel will get 2 oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges that Kel receives is 2 x 8 = 16. Now, let's count how many fruits Morrison has left after giving them to Kel. Morrison had 5 apples initially, so he has 5 - 0 = 5 apples left. Similarly, Morrison had 8 oranges initially, so he has 8 - 16 = -8 oranges left (Note: negative sign indicates that Morrison now has fewer oranges than before).
Response:  For the first two days (day 1 and day 2), Sadia gave Peer 8 hours of sunlight each day. So in total, she gave him 16 hours of sunlight during these two days. Now, if we assume that Peer requires at least 40 hours of sunlight to fully recover from his illness, then Sadia has given him only half of what he needs. Therefore, Peer will need an additional 24 hours of sunlight (i.e., 40 - 16 = 24). Since there are 7 days left after the first two days, Peer will receive 3.5 days (i.e., 24 / 7 = 3.5) more sunlight than he needed to fully recover from his illness.
Response:  The distance between two points is given as $2$ miles. After that, he walked for $8$ kilometers. So, the total distance traveled is: Distance = Speed x Time = $2$ miles x $10$ minutes / $60$ seconds = $33.33$ kilometers Now, we are asked how many miles he walked in $7$ minutes. To find this, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Miles walked = Distance / Time = $33.33$ kilometers / $7$ minutes = $4.62$ miles Therefore, he walked $4.62$ miles in $7$ minutes.
Response:  Genie has been working in her mother-in-law's house for 60 days and has completed 60 charts with 30 charts remaining. If she starts work from today, how many charts will she complete?  We need to calculate the number of charts she can complete per day based on the remaining charts.  Since Genie completes one chart every day, if there are 30 charts remaining, she will complete 30 / 1 = 30 charts in total. So, the answer is 30 charts.
Response:  Juliana had 50 chairs in her house and she gave 3 of them to her brother as a gift. Then, her brother gave her back 12 chairs. So, at this point, Juliana had 50 - 3 = 47 chairs left. After that, her brother gave her another 12 chairs, so now Juliana has 47 + 12 = 59 chairs.
Response:  Delon has 38 sausages and he wants to share them equally among 6 friends. So, each friend will get 6 sausages per person. Therefore, the total number of sausages that Delon distributed is 38 / 6 = 6.
Response:  If Lily has made 20 friends in her new school after moving from another school, and she can make 50 friends if she tries hard enough, then we can calculate the number of friends Lily and Emmy have together as follows:  Number of friends Lily has = 20 + (50 - 20) = 30  So, Lily and Emmy have 30 friends together.
"Response:  We have to find out how many mangoes, oranges, and apples are needed to make up for $40 spent on delicatessen items.  Mangoes cost $3 each, oranges cost $2 each, and apples cost $1.5 each.  To calculate the total cost of these fruits, we need to multiply their prices with the number of fruits required:

Mangoes: Total cost = $3 x (4/10) = $12
Oranges: Total cost = $2 x (6/10) = $12
Apples: Total cost = $1.5 x (8/10) = $12
Total cost of all fruits = $12 + $12 + $12 = $36
Since the person has spent $40 on delicatessen items, they still have $40 - $36 = $4 left over."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 500 patients in the hospital who need to be treated for 24 hours a day. This means that each doctor has to treat an average of 150 patients per hour (500/24). Secondly, we know that doctors receive $150 per patient and hospitals receive $200 per patient. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the hospital is: Total earnings = Number of patients x Doctor's fee + Hospital's fee In this case, the total number of patients is 500, so the total earnings of the hospital would be: Total earnings = 500 x ($150) + 500 x ($200) = $375,000 per day Now, let's convert it to weekly earnings: Weekly earnings = Daily earnings x Number of days in a week In this case, there are 7 days in a week, so the weekly earnings of the hospital would be: Weekly earnings = $375,000 x 7 = $2,625,000 per week So, the answer is $2,625,000 per week.
Response:  According to the given information, Neisa has 60 elf workers who work in her department store for 6 months at a time. After that, she hires 10 new elves and trains them for 3 months before sending them back to their homes. So, in total, Neisa has trained 70 elves (60 + 10) over the course of a year.
Response:  In June, Joseph earned $60 less than he did in May. So, his earnings in June were: $500 - $60 = $440. Therefore, the total amount of money that Joseph earned during those two months is: $440 + $480 = $920.
Response:  Pam and Fred each rolled a die once.  Pam got 2 sixes and Fred got 4 ones. After that, they took turns rolling two dice. If each roll resulted in at least 6 points, then they would have taken turns rolling 8 times (since there are 8 possible outcomes of at least 6 points). So, if they took turns rolling twice per day for 4 days, they would have rolled a total of 16 times (8 x 2 = 16).
Response:  Per has walked for 4 miles and then turned back. So, he has covered a total distance of 8 miles (4 miles in each direction). Now, Mangal has walked 6 more miles than Per. Therefore, Mangal has walked a total distance of 8 + 6 = 14 miles.
"Response:  If Tom can do four jobs in one month and each job pays him $15 per hour, then he earns:

$15/hour x 4 hours/day x 30 days/month = $5400/month (approximately)

So, if Tom works for one year (i.e., 12 months), his total income from these four jobs would be:

$5400/month x 12 months = $64,800 (approximately)"
"Response:  If Bob has 5 more videos than Brian and each video game has 3 genres, then the total number of video games that Bob has is:

Bob has 5 more videos than Brian, so Bob has 5 + 3 = 8 video games.

Since each video game has 3 genres, the total number of genres in all video games is 3 x 8 = 24 genres."
Response:  There are 27 countries in the world with a population of over one million people each. Among these countries, there are two high-income economies - Switzerland and Norway. So, we have 25 low-income economies. Now, let's calculate the number of women in these 25 countries. We know that the total population of these countries is 27 x 25 = 675 million people. Of this, 49% are male, which means there are approximately 318 million males (675 x 0.49). Therefore, the number of females in these 25 countries is 675 - 318 = 357 million.
Response:  Firstly, we have two different types of arrows - one with a price of Rs. 7.50 each and another with a price of Rs. 1.50 each. Now, if we want to calculate the total cost of 20% of these arrows, we need to multiply the number of arrows by their respective prices. For the first type of arrow, the calculation would be: Total Cost = Number of Arrows x Price per Arrow = 20 x Rs. 7.50 = Rs. 150 For the second type of arrow, the calculation would be: Total Cost = Number of Arrows x Price per Arrow = 20 x Rs. 1.50 = Rs. 30 So, the total cost of 20% of both types of arrows is: Total Cost = Rs. 150 + Rs. 30 = Rs. 180 Therefore, the answer is Rs. 180.
Response:  Mark had 75 questions in his exam and he completed 5 out of them within 5 hours. So, he worked at a pace of 15 questions per hour (75/5 = 15). Now, if we assume that each question took him 2 minutes to complete (as mentioned in the passage), then he spent 30 minutes on those 5 questions (15 x 2 = 30). Therefore, he did not complete 100 questions as there were only 5 questions left unanswered after 5 hours.
Response:  We know that there are 22 gulabs in total and each gulab contains 4 grams of sugar. So, the total amount of sugar in all 22 gulabs is: 22 x 4 = 88 grams. Now, we need to find out how many gulabs contain 12 grams of sugar or more. To do this, we will divide the total amount of sugar (88 grams) by 12 grams. This gives us: 88 / 12 = 7.33 gulabs. Therefore, there are approximately 7 gulabs that contain 12 grams of sugar or more.
Response:  We know that there are 20 tasks in total and we have already identified 12 automated tasks, which means there are 8 manual tasks remaining. Among these 8 manual tasks, 4 are done by drivers, which leaves us with 4 non-driver tasks. Therefore, the number of non-driver tasks is 4.
Response:  We know that there are 700 ml of water in the container and it is divided equally among 4 people, so each person gets 175 ml of water (700/4 = 175). Now, we also know that there are 20 babies in the room and they are equally distributed among the 4 women, so each woman has 5 babies (20/4 = 5). Therefore, the number of babies with each woman is 5.
Response:  If Arden earns $10 per hour and works for 8 hours a day, then his daily income is $80 ($10/hour x 8 hours). Now, if he spends $50 on video games every month, that means he has $30 left after spending ($80 - $50 = $30). So, in one year, he would have spent $360 ($30 x 12 months) on video games. Therefore, he would have $640 left after spending ($640 - $360 = $280) in one year.
Response:  We have been given that:  * Jan Doodh Doodh 2 dollars = 10 tickets * Inay Tain Daalr 3 dollars = 15 tickets * Lite Blub Teen Daalr 4 dollars = 20 tickets * Kap Teen Daalr 5 dollars = 25 tickets And there are 4 types of ticks in total. Now, we need to find out how much each type of ticket costs. So, let's calculate it as follows:  Jan Doodh Doodh = $2 / 10 tickets = $0.20 per ticket Inay Tain Daalr = $3 / 15 tickets = $0.20 per ticket Lite Blub Teen Daalr = $4 / 20 tickets = $0.20 per ticket Kap Teen Daalr = $5 / 25 tickets = $0.20 per ticket Therefore, each type of ticket costs $0.20.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Kam has earned from his three clients so far. According to the question, he has worked for them for 10 days each and has been paid $2 per day. Therefore, the total amount of money he has earned from these clients is:

$2 x 3 clients x 10 days = $60

Now, let's move on to calculating the total amount of money Kam has spent on buying bread and milk for his family. The question states that he spends $1 on bread and $0.50 on milk every day. Therefore, the total amount of money he has spent on these items so far is:

$1 x 10 days = $10
$0.50 x 10 days = $5

So, the total amount of money Kam has spent on his family is $15 ($10 + $5). Now, let's compare this amount with the total amount of money he has earned from his clients. As mentioned earlier, he has earned $60 from his clients. Therefore, the difference between the two amounts is:

$60 - $15 = $45

So, Kam has $45 left after paying for his family's expenses."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 hectors in total and each hector produces 100 animals. So, the total number of animals produced by all the hectors is:

10 x 100 = 1000

Now, we need to calculate how many animals Jan can produce in one month. Since Jan can produce 3 months worth of animals every year, so the number of animals he can produce in one month is:

1000 / 3 = 333

Therefore, Jan can produce 333 animals per month."
Response:  Jani has built a Lego box car with 500 bricks and has given it to his friends as a gift. He has also given them 3 extra large blocks each, making a total of 1500 bricks. So, if he wants to give all the lego blocks back to his friends equally, how many blocks will each friend get?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of bricks (1500) by the number of friends (5). Therefore, each friend will receive 300 bricks (1500 / 5 = 300).
Response:  In one day, Debra can walk for 30 minutes and then rest for 6 hours before walking again.  So in total, she walks for 30 + (6 x 2) = 72 minutes per day.  Now, let's calculate how many miles she covers in each of the next 6 hours after her first walk. She covers half of the distance walked during the first hour, so in the second hour, she covers 15 miles (half of 30). In the third hour, she covers 7.5 miles (half of 15), and so on. Therefore, in the last 6 hours of the day, she covers a total distance of 15 + 7.5 + 3.75 + 1.88 + 0.94 + 0.47 = 41.5 miles.
Response:  The price of one burger is $12 and that of one pizza is $10. If the mother buys one burger and one pizza for her two children (one child and one adult), she will have to pay $12 + $10 = $22. Now, if she gets $8 as change from the total amount paid ($22), then she will get $22 - $8 = $14 in change.
Response:  If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and each of James's 50 friends likes his page, then how many friends does James have?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of friends James has = Total number of friends liked James's page x Number of friends per friend  = 50 x 4 (since there are 4 friends in every group)  = 200 friends So, James has 200 friends on Facebook.
Response:  School A has a distance of 3 miles from point B and a speed of 440 feet per minute. Therefore, it will take 3/440 = 0.07 hours to reach school A from point B. Similarly, school B has a distance of 2 miles from point B and a speed of 264 feet per minute. So, it will take 2/264 = 0.08 hours to reach school B from point B. Now, if Tum is waiting at point B for Haroon to return, then he will have waited for 0.07 + 0.08 = 0.15 hours.
Response:  Firstly, Shondra has given a suggestion to Chargee that he should charge Rs. 25 per seat for each of his tours. If there are 10 seats in total, then the revenue generated from each tour would be Rs. 25 x 10 = Rs. 250.  Now, let's assume that out of these 10 seats, 5 people come on the first day and pay Rs. 250 each, which is a total revenue of Rs. 1,250 (Rs. 250 x 5). On the second day, 3 people come and pay Rs. 250 each, which is a total revenue of Rs. 750 (Rs. 250 x 3). So, the total revenue generated on both days is Rs. 1,900 (Rs. 1,250 + Rs. 750).  Finally, one person comes on the third day and pays Rs. 250, which is a total revenue of Rs. 250. Therefore, the total amount earned by Chargee over the three days is Rs. 1,900 + Rs. 250 = Rs. 2,150.
Response:  We have been given that there are 7 cookies in each pack of Carl Kokiz and each cookie costs $0.10. If Carl wants to buy 10 notebooks worth $10, he will need to pay $10 / $0.10 = 100 packets of Carl Kokiz. Therefore, if he buys all these packets, he will get 7 cookies in each packet, so he will get a total of 7 x 100 = 700 cookies.
Response:  Firstly, Dee (the dog) bought a big pickle for $10 and gave it to Franky (the cat). Then, Franky licked the pickle three times before giving it back to Dee. After that, five cats fought over the pickle and each one got two bites out of it. Finally, one last cat took the remaining piece of pickle from the other four cats. So, in total, how many pieces of pickle did Dee give to Franky?  Based on the information provided, there were six cats involved in the scenario - Dee, Franky, and five other cats. Each of these cats got at least two bites out of the pickle, except for the last cat who only got one bite. Therefore, the total number of pieces of pickle given to Franky is: 6 x 2 = 12 + 1 = 13 pieces of pickle.
Response:  The teacher has to teach for two hours every day from Monday to Friday, and there are 16 days in a week. So, the total number of teaching hours per week is: 2 x 7 = 14 hours/week.
"Response:  The total number of rolls is 300, and each roll has 4 inches length. So, the total length of all rolls is:

300 rolls x 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

Now, let's calculate the area of each corrugated cardboard box. Each box has a length of 6 feet (72 inches), and a width of 4 feet (48 inches). Therefore, the area of one box is:

Area of one box = Length x Width = 72 inches x 48 inches = 3366.4 square inches

Since there are 60 boxes in total, the total area of all boxes is:

Total area of boxes = 60 boxes x Area of one box = 3366.4 square inches x 60 boxes = 205976 square inches

Finally, let's calculate the time it would take to pack all the rolls into boxes. If we assume that each person can pack 6 rolls per minute (as mentioned in the question), then the total time required to pack all rolls into boxes is:

Time taken to pack rolls = Total number of rolls / Number of rolls packed per minute = 300 rolls / 6 rolls/minute = 50 minutes

Therefore, if Bulk had packed all the rolls into boxes simultaneously, it would have taken him 50 minutes to complete the task."
Response:  The number of houses in the village is 500, and each house has two rooms. So, the total number of rooms in the village is 500 x 2 = 1000 rooms. Now, let's consider the age of each person in the village. According to the question, every person in the village works for 6 months and then takes a break for 2 months. Therefore, the total number of working days in a year is 6/3 = 2 times 365 days = 730 days. Since there are 1000 rooms in the village, and each room can accommodate 4 people (as mentioned in the question), the total population of the village is 1000 x 4 = 4000 people. Finally, if we assume that each person needs 20 kg of rice per month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total amount of rice required for the entire village is 4000 x 20 kg = 80,000 kg per year.
Response:  The block moves 15 meters forward and then turns around to move backward for 10 meters. Then it stops for 1 second before moving again in the same direction for 20 meters. So, the total distance traveled by the block is:  Distance = Speed x Time = 15 + (-10) + (1) + (20) = 46 meters. Now, let's calculate how many times the block passes the starting point during this time period: Number of passings = Total distance / Distance between start and end points = 46 / (10 - 0) = 4.6 times. Therefore, the block passes the starting point 4.6 times during the given time period.
Response:  Firstly, Raffle bought 4 pens for $1 each, so he spent a total of $4. Secondly, he bought 2 notebooks for $1 each, so he spent another $2. Finally, he bought a bag of candies worth $20, which is the most expensive item he purchased. Therefore, in total, Raffle spent $4 + $2 = $6 on all these items.
Response:  Finn has seen 11 turtles in his dream and he wants to count them again. He can only see two turtles outside of his dream now. So, the number of turtles that Finn saw in his dream is (11 - 2) = 9.
Response:  The tank capacity of Peri is 17 feet and that of Mangal is 7 feet. So, in one day, Peri can hold 24 times more water than Mangal (17/7 = 2.3). Therefore, if there are two days in a week, then Peri can hold 48 times more water than Mangal in a week (2 x 2 = 4).
Response:  Anakin has 10 stars, 6 moons, and 3 planets under his control. Lexus has 5 stars, 3 moons, and 2 very large planets under his control. To determine who is more powerful, we need to compare their respective numbers of stars, moons, and planets.  Anakin has 10 + 6 = 16 celestial bodies under his control, while Lexus has 5 + 3 = 8 celestial bodies under his control. Therefore, Anakin is more powerful than Lexus in terms of number of celestial bodies he controls.
Response:  If the price of one big was $20 and it increased by 20% every two months, then after three years (36 months), the price would be: $20 x (1 + 0.20/2) ^ 3 = $48 So, after 36 months, the price of one big would be $48.
Response:  We have five different jobs in one room: 1. Carpenter (Rs. 50 per hour) 2. Electrician (Rs. 60 per hour) 3. Plumber (Rs. 70 per hour) 4. Mechanic (Rs. 80 per hour) 5. Gardener (Rs. 90 per hour) Total hours worked = 5 x 60 = 300 hours Now, let's calculate the total amount earned by each worker: Carpenter - 300 hours x Rs. 50 per hour = Rs. 15,000 Electrician - 300 hours x Rs. 60 per hour = Rs. 18,000 Plumber - 300 hours x Rs. 70 per hour = Rs. 21,000 Mechanic - 300 hours x Rs. 80 per hour = Rs. 24,000 Gardener - 300 hours x Rs. 90 per hour = Rs. 27,000 So, the total amount earned by all workers is: Rs. 15,000 + Rs. 18,000 + Rs. 21,000 + Rs. 24,000 + Rs. 27,000 = Rs. 1,00,000 Therefore, the value of the character with a price tag of Rs. 50,000 is approximately equal to 10 times the total amount earned by all workers combined.
Response:  If he spends 3 hours creating his own website and earns $1 per hour, then he will have earned $3 in total (3 x $1 = $3).  Now, if he has spent $90 on charges, then he will have $87 left ($90 - $3 = $87). So, he will have earned $87 more than what he has spent.
Response:  Firstly, Ali has $1500 to spend on his new computer and accessories. He wants to buy a laptop, keyboard, mouse, screen protector, and a printer. The prices of these items are as follows: Laptop - $800 Keyboard - $130 Mouse - $60 Screen protector - $30 Printer - $1090 Total cost = $1570 Now, we need to find out how many numbers are left after buying all these items. To do this, we will subtract the total cost from the amount Ali has to spend: $1500 - $1570 = $130 So, there are $130 left after buying all the required items.
Response:  Whenever Sandra sees her daughter, she gets angry and scolds her for no reason. This happens 9 times in total. If Sandra has to take care of three children at once, it means that she will get angry or upset with them 3 times as well. Therefore, the number of times Sandra gets angry or upset with the children is 9 x 3 = 27 times.
Response:  According to the given information, Sita Brooke is currently 76 years old (born in 1945). In two years, she will be 78 years old (born in 1943). So, the difference between her age and Seventh-day Adventist Church's average lifespan of 78 years is 28 - 78 = -50 years. Therefore, Sita Brooke is 50 years younger than the average lifespan of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
Response:  If Jami has $80 and Ethel has $20, then Jami has $60 more than Ethel. So, Jami has $100 ($80 + $60). Therefore, there are $40 difference between their amounts.
Response:  Panchro (5) x Rozaanah (20) = 100. If he walks for 7 days at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, then in one day he will walk 30 x 7 = 210 kilometers. So, after 7 days, he will have walked a total distance of 210 km. Therefore, he has walked 210 / 7 = 30 kilometers per day on average.
Response:  The cost of one unit of the new uniform is Rs. 250, and each jacket costs three times that amount, so the cost of one jacket is Rs. 750 (3 x Rs. 250). Similarly, the cost of one pant is half the cost of the jacket, so the cost of one pant is Rs. 375 (half of Rs. 750). Therefore, the total cost of one Yuniform is Rs. 1,125 (Rs. 750 + Rs. 375).
Response:  There are 80 cats in the house and each cat has 8 tails, so there are 8 x 80 = 640 tails in total.  Then, out of these 640 tails, 90 cats have 6 tails each, so there are 90 x 6 = 540 tails left.  And finally, among these 540 tails, 3 mice have 10 tails each, so there are 3 x 10 = 30 tails remaining. Therefore, there are 540 + 30 = 570 tails in total that can be seen in the house.
Response:  The first train has 4 cars and is 2 years old. For every additional car, the age of the train increases by 1 year. So, the second train with 3 cars is 3 years old (2 + 1 = 3). Similarly, the third train with 2 cars is 2 years old (3 + 1 = 4), and so on. Therefore, the total age of all 4 trains is: 4 x 3 = 12 years.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Jessa can save each month. According to the question, her income is $300 per month from her job as a teacher, and she also receives $200 per month from her investments. Therefore, her total monthly income is $300 + $200 = $500. Now, let's find out how much percentage of her income Jessa can save each month. To do this, we will divide the amount she saves each month by her total monthly income. So, if Jessa saves $500 / $500 (her total monthly income) = 100% of her income each month. Next, we need to determine how many months it would take for Jessa to save $50,000 if she continues to save 100% of her income each month. To do this, we will multiply the number of months by the amount she saves each month. So, if Jessa saves $50,000 / $500 (her monthly savings) = 100 months. Therefore, if Jessa continues to save 100% of her income each month, it would take her approximately 100 months or about 8.3 years to save $50,000.
Response:  Bilal has 60 almonds in front of him and he wants to divide them equally among 5 people. Each person will get how many almonds?  To find out, we need to divide 60 by 5, which gives us an answer of 12 almonds per person. So, Bilal can give each person 12 almonds.
Response:  The cost of one gelatin capsule is $0.50 and that of Chinese medicine is $2. So, if they buy 20 gelatin capsules, their total cost will be $10 (20 x $0.50). If they get a discount of $25, then their actual cost will be $8 ($10 - $25).
Response:  We have 240 Indians and 80 Japanese in the team. Since there are more Indians than Japanese, we will give priority to them. So, out of 60 girls in the Chinese team, 36 will be Indian (60 x 0.5 = 36). Therefore, there are 36 Indian girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, Zainab has Rs. 200 with her and she spends Rs. 150 on buying a gift for her sister. So, now she has Rs. 50 left with her.  Then, she meets Waqas who offers to buy her lunch in exchange for Rs. 300. She agrees and gives him the money. Now, she is left with nothing.  Later, she receives Rs. 600 from her parents as an advance for her wedding expenses. So, now she has Rs. 600 + Rs. 50 = Rs. 650 with her.  Finally, she decides to save Rs. 400 of that amount for her future use. So, now she has Rs. 650 - Rs. 400 = Rs. 250 left with her.
Response:  If Ranbir Kapoor has 15 crores in his pocket and he gives 3 crores to each of his 5 friends, then he will have 9 crores left with him (15 - 3 x 5 = 9).  Now, if Bhatt's pocket contains 40 crores, then there are 31 crores left after he distributes 10 crores among his 3 friends (40 - 10 x 3 = 31).
Response:  The total amount of money spent is $10, and it was divided into two parts - $5 for one group and $8 for another group. So, the amount spent per person in each group can be calculated as follows: For the first group (spent $5): Number of people = Total amount spent / Amount spent per person = $10 / $5 = 2 people For the second group (spent $8): Number of people = Total amount spent / Amount spent per person = $10 / $8 = 1.25 people Since there are whole numbers in the problem, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of people who received less than $5 is 2, and the number of people who received more than $5 but less than $8 is also 2. So, the final answer is: Number of people who received less than $5 = 2, and the number of people who received more than $5 but less than $8 = 2.
Response:  There are two expectant students in each class, and there are 12 classes in total. Therefore, the number of expectant students in all classes is 2 x 12 = 24. If Fatima gives birth to twins, then the number of expectant students in her class will increase by 2. So, the new number of expectant students in her class is 24 + 2 = 26. Similarly, if Haroon also gives birth to twins, then the number of expectant students in his class will increase by 2 as well, so the new number of expectant students in his class is 26 + 2 = 28.
Response:  Sandra has 400 red roses and wants to give 5 of them as a gift to Fred. She has 360 white roses that are similar in size and quality to the red ones. To make it fair, she decides to give one white rose for every five red roses she gives to Fred. Therefore, if she gives 5 red roses to Fred, she will also give him 1 white rose (5/5 = 1). So, the total number of roses Sandra will give to Fred is 400 + 1 = 401 roses.
Response:  According to the given information, Mark is currently 5 years older than Jane. 2 years ago, Mark was 7 years younger than Jane. So, at that time, Jane was 9 years old (7 + 2). Now, 2 years have passed and Jane has aged 1 year, so she is now 10 years old (9 + 1). Therefore, the current age of Gene is 30 - 10 = 20 years old.
Response:  There are two teams with four members each. Each team has to run 400 meters in opposite directions. The distance between them is 55 seconds. One team runs at an average speed of 60 seconds per 100 meters and the other team runs at an average speed of 70 seconds per 100 meters. How many times will they pass each other during the race? Solution: To find out how many times the teams will pass each other, we need to calculate the time taken by each team to cover 400 meters. We know that one member from Team A takes 60 seconds to cover 100 meters, so he/she will take 60 x 4 = 240 seconds to cover 400 meters (since there are 4 members in Team A). Similarly, we know that one member from Team B takes 70 seconds to cover 100 meters, so he/she will take 70 x 4 = 280 seconds to cover 400 meters (since there are 4 members in Team B). Now, let's check when they will meet again after passing each other once: Team A covers 400 meters in 240 seconds, which means it takes them 240 / 60 = 4 minutes to complete the first 400 meters. After completing this distance, they will start running back towards their starting point, which means they will take another 4 minutes to cover the same distance again (since they ran for 4 minutes in the opposite direction earlier). Therefore, the total time taken by Team A to cover 800 meters (i.e., twice the distance they covered initially) is 4 + 4 = 8 minutes. Similarly, we can calculate the time taken by Team B to cover 800 meters as follows: They took 280 seconds to cover the initial distance of 400 meters, so they will take another 280 / 70 = 4 minutes to cover the remaining distance of 400 meters (since they ran for 4 minutes in the opposite direction earlier). Therefore, the total time taken by Team B to cover 800 meters is also 4 minutes. Now, let's see when the teams will meet again: Since both teams started running simultaneously,
Response:  The number of rolls required to cover 30 meters is given as $4 \times 10 = 40$ rolls. Now, we are asked if it is possible for him to roll $5 \times 10 = 50$ meters. Yes, he can do that because he has already rolled $40$ meters, which is more than half of $30$ meters. So, the answer is $50$.
Response:  Genie and her mother have collected 15 seeds from their garden. If they collect 20 more seeds, then together they will have 35 seeds.
Response:  We have 10 hemispheres with equal areas (1/10 of the total area). Each hemisphere has 360 degrees of angle, so each degree is divided into 10 parts (360 / 10 = 36 degrees per part). Now, we need to find out how many parts are there in each hemisphere. Since there are 36 parts in each hemisphere, and each part represents 36 degrees, then each part represents 36/10 = 3.6 degrees. Therefore, there are 3.6 degrees in each part. So, if we divide 160 degrees among 10 hemispheres, each hemisphere will get 160 / 10 = 16 degrees.
"Response:  If Mindy lent $100 to Benny and he paid back $2 in interest after 2 months, then the amount of money that Mindy can get from Benny is:

$100 + ($2 x 2/12) = $100 + $0.05 = $100.05
So, if Mindy can get $100.05 from Benny after 3 months, she will have earned an interest of:

$100.05 x (3/2) = $150.10
Therefore, the answer is $150.10."
Response:  The trader has sold 20 bags of wheat at Rs. 20 per bag, and he has to pay Rs. 2 for transportation and handling charges per bag. So, he has spent a total of Rs. 4 (2 x 2) on transportation and handling charges. Now, if he wants to make a profit of Rs. 160 (Rs. 400 - Rs. 240), he needs to sell each bag of wheat at a price that will give him this profit margin. Therefore, the selling price of one bag of wheat = Rs. 400 / Rs. 160 = Rs. 2.50 per bag.
"Response:  Firstly, we have two friends who have invested in three different stocks A, B and C. The total amount they invested is Rs. 20,250. Now, let's assume that each friend has invested an equal amount of money (Rs. 6,750) in all three stocks. Therefore, the number of shares each friend holds in each stock will be:

Friend 1: Shares in Stock A = Rs. 6,750 / Rs. 20,250 = 0.33 shares
Shares in Stock B = Rs. 6,750 / Rs. 20,250 = 0.33 shares
Shares in Stock C = Rs. 6,750 / Rs. 20,250 = 0.33 shares

Now, if the price of each share is reduced by $4.50, then the new prices will be:

Stock A: Price after reduction = $4.50 x 0.33 = $14.95
Stock B: Price after reduction = $4.50 x 0.33 = $14.95
Stock C: Price after reduction = $4.50 x 0.33 = $14.95

So, the total value of investment for each friend remains the same, i.e., Rs. 20,250. However, now each friend owns more shares in each stock due to the reduction in price."
Response:  We know that John can walk for 3 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour. So, in 1 minute, he walks 2 miles / 60 minutes = 0.03 miles per minute. Therefore, in 3 hours, he walks 0.03 x 3 hours = 0.09 miles.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, total hours in a week = 7 x 24 = 168 hours. Now, we need to calculate how many hours of sleep are required for an average person per night. According to various studies, it is recommended that adults should get at least 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Therefore, total hours of sleep required per week = Total hours of sleep per night x Number of nights in a week = 7-9 hours/night x 7 nights/week = 49-63 hours/week. Since there are 168 hours in a week, the percentage of time spent sleeping can be calculated as follows: Percentage of time spent sleeping = Total hours of sleep/Total hours in a week = 49-63/168 = 0.29-0.36 or approximately 29% - 36%.
Response:  According to the given information:  The tree planted in 1980 is still alive after 40 years (i.e., till 2020). So, there are 40 trees in total.  Every year, 2 new trees are planted. Therefore, the total number of trees after 10 years = 40 + (2 x 10) = 60 trees. After another 10 years (i.e., till 2030), 30% of the original 40 trees have died, leaving behind 24 trees (since 40 / 3 = 13.33 years ago, 24 trees are left). So, the final number of trees remaining after 20 years = 24 trees.
Response:  We know that in the last five days of Ramadan, the pigeons have been fed with 18 gulab jamuns every morning at dawn. On the seventh day, the pigeons brought back one of the high-altitude balloons to their nest in the same shape as before. From this information, we can conclude that there were 210 (18 x 7) gulab jamuns in total.
Response:  We have to find out how many pints of each color are needed and then calculate the total cost.  There are 5 different colors available, and each pint costs $20. So, we need to find out how many pints of each color are required.  For example, if we want to buy all 5 colors, we will need 5 x $20 = $100. If we can get a discount of 2 dollars per pint, then we will pay $98 for 5 pints. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 pints.
Response:  We know that one pen costs Rs. 1.20 and one pencil costs Rs. 0.30. To find out how many pens can be bought with 0.30 rupees, we need to divide the cost of one pencil (Rs. 0.30) by the cost of one pen (Rs. 1.20). So, the number of pens that can be bought with 0.30 rupees is: Number of pens = Cost of one pencil / Cost of one pen = 0.30 / 1.20 = 0.25 or 25% Therefore, 25% of the total amount (0.30 x 4 = 0.12) can buy four pens.
Response:  There are 40 restaurants in a private city and each restaurant has to distribute 200 gajar (carrots) among their customers. So, the total number of carrots that need to be distributed is 8000 (40 x 200). Since there are only 20 restaurants, each restaurant will have to distribute an average of 400 carrots (8000 / 20 = 400) among their customers. Therefore, not all restaurants will have equal distribution of carrots as some may get more or less than others based on their capacity and customer demand.
Response:  According to the given information, there are total 23786 people in Sudan, out of which 8417 are males and 9092 are females. So, the number of boys (males) in Sudan is 8417.
Response:  At first, he had 20 cards in his hand. After one month, he collected 15 more cards, making it 35 cards in total. Then, during the next two months, he added another 10 cards to his collection, bringing the total number of cards to 45. So, currently, there are 45 cards in his possession.
Response:  Mark is an advertiser who has to create two different ads for each of the five brands he works with. Each brand has 1000 images in total that Mark can use for his ads. Mark needs to create one ad per week for each brand, and each ad must contain at least 5 images from the respective brand's collection. Since there are 5 brands, Mark will need to create 5 x 5 = 25 ads in total. However, since each ad requires at least 5 images from the respective brand's collection, Mark will actually need to collect 5 x 1000 = 5000 images in total. Therefore, the number of images Mark needs to collect is 5000.
Response:  We have a container with water and we want to know how many liters of water it can hold. The container has a diameter of 5 balls (which is equal to 12 inches or 0.3 meters). Now, each ball represents 1 liter of water. So, if there are 5 balls in the container, that means the container can hold 5 liters of water. Therefore, the answer is 5 liters.
Response:  According to the given information, Jan earned $5000 in interest and $5000 in dividends per year for 5 years. If he invested half of his salary each year, then he invested $10,000 (half of $20,000) in the first year, $7,500 (half of $15,000) in the second year, $3,750 (half of $7,500) in the third year, $1,875 (half of $3,750) in the fourth year, and $937.50 (half of $1,875) in the fifth year. Therefore, the total amount of money that Jan made over those five years is: $10,000 + $7,500 + $3,750 + $1,875 + $937.50 = $34,150.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 apples in one bunch and each apple weighs 0.1 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 10 apples is:

$$ \text {Total weight of 10 apples} = \text {Weight of 1 apple} \times \text {Number of apples} $$

$$ = 0.1 \text {kg} \times 10 \text{apples} $$

$$ = 1 \text {kg} $$

Now, let's consider the size of one orange. According to the question, one orange weighs 50 grams. So, if we have 10 oranges, their total weight would be:

$$ \text {Total weight of 10 oranges} = \text {Weight of 1 orange} \times \text {Number of oranges} $$

$$ = 50 \text {grams} \times 10 \text {oranges} $$

$$ = 500 \text {grams} $$

Therefore, the ratio of the weight of apples to oranges is:

$$ \frac{\text {weight of apples}}{\text {weight of oranges}} = \frac{1 \text {kg}}{500 \text {grams}} $$

Simplifying this fraction, we get:

$$ \boxed[ \frac{1}{10} ] $$

So, for every 10 apples, there are approximately 5 oranges."
Response:  According to the passage, Carl eats paneer every day for breakfast and lunch, which means he consumes 200 grams of paneer per day (100 grams x 2 meals). Since each slice of paneer weighs approximately 50 grams, Carl consumes 4 slices of paneer per day (200 grams / 50 grams per slice = 4 slices). Therefore, Carl consumes 4 slices of paneer per day.
Response:  Genie has 22 sapphires and 10 pearls in his possession initially. Then he buys 6 blue sapphires and 2 red rubies with the pearls. So, the total number of sapphires he now possesses is 22 + 6 = 28 sapphires. Similarly, the total number of rubies he possesses is 2 + 2 = 4 rubies. Therefore, there are 28 sapphires and 4 rubies in Genie's possession currently.
Response:  The first five scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. If we want to calculate the average score of these five scores, we need to add them up and divide by 5. So, the total score is: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 459. Dividing this total by 5 gives us an average score of 91.8 (rounded to two decimal places). Therefore, the sixth score that is required to reach 93 is 1.
Response:  Michael has walked for 5 hours at a speed of 5 km/h and then rested for 30 minutes. After that, he walked again for another 5 hours at a speed of 6 km/h. So in total, he has walked for 8 hours (5 + 30 + 5). Now, we need to calculate how many kilometers he has covered during these 8 hours. During the first 5 hours, he walked at a speed of 5 km/h, so he covered a distance of 5 x 5 = 25 km. And during the last 3 hours, he walked at a speed of 6 km/h, so he covered a distance of 6 x 3 = 18 km. Therefore, in total, Michael has covered a distance of 25 + 18 = 43 km.
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolates in each bar and 80 candies in each bag. So, if we want to find out how many grams of weight each chocolate has, we need to divide the total weight of all the chocolates (25 x 25 = 625 grams) by the number of chocolates (25). Therefore, each chocolate weighs approximately 625 / 25 = 25 grams. Similarly, if we want to find out how much each candy weighs, we can divide the total weight of all the candies (80 x 80 = 6400 grams) by the number of candies (80), which gives us an approximate weight of 77 grams per candy.
Response:  On the first day, Pir Khan had 10 kicks and gave 4 to Mangal. So, he has 6 kicks left (10 - 4 = 6). On the second day, he went to another dakan and got 3 more kicks. Now, he has 9 kicks (6 + 3 = 9) left. On the third day, he again visited another dakan and received 2 more kicks. Therefore, he has 7 kicks left (9 - 2 = 7). Finally, on the fourth day, he gave 5 kicks to Mangal, so he is left with 2 kicks (7 - 5 = 2). Thus, over the course of 4 days, Pir Khan gave away a total of 16 kicks (4 + 9 + 2 = 16).
Response:  We have to find out how much less than $1200 each of the 4 pounds is worth in terms of dollars.  So, we need to divide $1200 by 4 and get $300 per pound.  Now, let's see if any of the 5 options are less than $300 per pound.  Option A says that each of the 4 pounds is worth $6000, which is more than $300 per pound, so it doesn't fit.  Option B says that each of the 4 pounds is worth $5000, which is also more than $300 per pound, so it doesn't fit too.  Option C says that each of the 4 pounds is worth $4000, which is close but still not less than $300 per pound, so it doesn't fit either.  Only option D says that each of the 4 pounds is worth $3000, which is exactly what we were looking for! So, the answer is option D.
"Response:  Sarrah earns Rs. 30 per jacket and Rs. 20 per pair of jeans. If she sells each jacket for Rs. 50 and each pair of jeans for Rs. 40, then her total income from these items is:
Jackets: 30 x 5 = Rs. 150
Jeans: 20 x 6 = Rs. 120
Total income: Rs. 150 + Rs. 120 = Rs. 270
Now, let's calculate how much money Sarrah would have if she sold each item five times:
Jackets: 5 x Rs. 150 = Rs. 750
Jeans: 5 x Rs. 120 = Rs. 600
Total amount earned: Rs. 750 + Rs. 600 = Rs. 1350
So, if Sarrah sold each item five times, she would have earned a total of Rs. 1350."
Response:  We know that there are 3 red hens and 5 white hens in total.  Each day, Jerry collects 42 eggs from all the hens. If there are more than two white hens in front of each red hen, then how many red hens are there? So, if there are 7 white hens in front of each red hen (which is not possible), then there would be 7 x 3 = 21 red hens. But since we were told that there are only 3 red hens, this option is impossible. Therefore, the correct answer is 3 red hens.
Response:  The distance traveled by the dog in 1 minute is given as $ \frac{1}{2} m/s $. Since there are 6 minutes in total, the distance traveled by the dog can be calculated as follows: $$ Distance = \frac{1}{2} m/s \times 6 min = 3 \text{ meters} $$ Now, if the dog runs for $ 5 \text{ kilometers }$, then it has covered a total distance of: $$ Total distance = 5 km - 3 \text{ meters} = 2 \text{ kilometers} $$ So, the dog has run $ 2 \text{ kilometers }$ in $ 5 \text{ minutes }$.
"Response:  On day 1, Salman counted 100 dogs in his backyard and recorded their numbers. The next day (day 2), he counted 50 more dogs than the previous day, making it a total of 150 dogs. If he continued to count dogs at this rate for the remaining days (days 3-10), then the total number of dogs he would have counted is:

Day 3: 150 + 50 = 200 dogs
Day 4: 200 + 75 = 275 dogs
Day 5: 275 + 62 = 337 dogs
Day 6: 337 + 85 = 422 dogs
Day 7: 422 + 97 = 519 dogs
Day 8: 519 + 105 = 624 dogs
Day 9: 624 + 120 = 744 dogs
Day 10: 744 + 140 = 884 dogs

Therefore, if Salman continued counting dogs at this rate for all 10 days, he would have counted a total of 884 dogs."
Response:  We know that there are two tanks, one with capacity of 4 gallons and another with capacity of 8 gallons.  Initially, both tanks were empty. Now, we fill the first tank with water from the second tank, which has a capacity of 4 gallons. So, after filling the first tank, its capacity becomes 4 + 4 = 8 gallons. Then, we again fill it up to its original capacity of 4 gallons using water from the second tank. Therefore, the current capacity of the first tank is 4 gallons. Similarly, the capacity of the second tank is also 4 gallons since it had 8 - 4 = 4 gallons left before filling the first tank.  So, in total, there are 2 x 4 = 8 gallons of water in the two tanks combined.
Response:  Lorrie has $320 and wants to buy something worth $32. To make this purchase possible, she can work for 10 hours (80/6 = 13.33) and earn $4 per hour ($4 x 13.33 = $53). So, she will have earned $53 after working for 10 hours. Now, let's calculate how much she can afford to spend on the item: $32 - $53 = $-21 Lorrie cannot afford to spend more than $-21 on the item. Therefore, she should not spend more than that amount on it.
Response:  Genius has taken $2000 as loan and promised to pay back $165 per month for 12 months. So, total amount paid back is: $\$165 \times 12 = \$1980$. Now, if Genius pays back the remaining balance of $1200 in one go after 12 months, then the final amount paid back is: $\$1200 + \$1980 = \$3180$. Therefore, the number of billions Genius can buy with the remaining money is: $\$3180 / \$1 billion = 0.318$, or approximately 31.8%.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 dahlias in each pot (as mentioned in the question). So, if we have 7 pots of dahlias, then the total number of dahlias will be:

4 x 7 = 28 dahlias
Therefore, there are 28 dahlias in the garden."
Response:  The age of an actor is 70 years old and he has been acting for 50 years. Therefore, his age at the time of starting acting was 20 years old (70 - 50 = 20). Now, if we assume that he started acting when he was 20 years old, then his current age would be 90 years old (20 + 70 = 90). So, the correct answer is 90 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Char has scored 251 points in total. Then, Noor has scored 68 points. Now, Yuri has scored more than half of Noor's score which is equal to 68/2 = 34 points. So, Yuri has scored 34 + 68 = 102 points. Finally, Brian has scored 17 points less than Yuri which means he has scored 102 - 17 = 85 points. Therefore, Jojo has scored 85 points.
Response:  Karim has 10 minutes to complete each of his 5 courses and 20 minutes to complete each of his 8 subjects. Therefore, he needs a total of 5 x 10 = 50 minutes for his courses and 8 x 20 = 160 minutes for his subjects. So in total, Karim needs 50 + 160 = 210 minutes.
Response:  Sehgal said that he had filled his tank with 120 liters of water and then emptied it into his garden. He used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate his garden. So, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank now (120 - 90 = 30).
Response:  We have two quantities of jelly beans - 90 grams and 40 grams. To find out how many phools (jelly beans) are in each quantity, we need to divide the weight of each quantity by the weight of one phool. So, for 90 grams of jelly beans, we can calculate as follows: Number of phools = Weight of jelly beans / Weight of one phool = 90 g / 0.25 g/phool = 360 phools Now, let's do the same calculation for 40 grams of jelly beans: Number of phools = Weight of jelly beans / Weight of one phool = 40 g / 0.25 g/phool = 160 phools Therefore, there are 360 phools in 90 grams of jelly beans and 160 phools in 40 grams of jelly beans.
Response:  The company has been in business for one year and has earned $15,000 per month. Since it takes two years to earn the entire amount, the company will have earned $15,000 x 24 = $360,000 during those two years. So, the number of shares that can be purchased with this money is $360,000 / $15,000 per month = 24 months or 2 years.
Response:  Karlos earns $30 per hour and works for 3 hours, so his total income is $90 ($30 x 3).  Benji earns $18 per hour and works for 5 hours, so his total income is $90 ($18 x 5). If Karlos works for 3 hours and Benji works for 5 hours, their combined income would be $180 ($90 + $90).
Response:  The distance between New Jersey and Rochester is approximately 350 miles (563 km). Now, let's assume that the driver takes one break of 2 hours every day for lunch and rest. This means they will cover 1/3 of the total distance in each leg of their journey, which is 350 / 3 = 116.7 miles per day. Therefore, it will take them around 6 days to reach Rochester from New Jersey if they drive non-stop without any breaks.
Response:  Jamie has 30 apples in one basket and 20 grapes in another basket. He also has 40 pears in a third basket. If he takes 8 apples from one basket, 14 grapes from the second basket, and 20 pears from the third basket, how many fruits will he have altogether?  To calculate this, we need to add up the number of fruits Jamie had initially and then subtract the number of fruits he took away. So, Jamie had 30 + 20 = 50 apples initially, plus 20 grapes initially, which is a total of 70 fruits. Then, he took away 8 apples, which is equal to 8/100th of the initial total of fruits, so the new total is 70 - 8/100 = 62 fruits. Finally, he added 14 grapes, which is equal to 14/100th of the initial total of fruits, so the new total is 62 + 14/100 = 76 fruits. Therefore, Jamie will have 76 fruits altogether after taking some away and adding others.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of ingredients for one burrito as follows: Gross profit = Total cost of ingredients / Selling price of burrito = ($2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.25) / $6.50 = $3.75 So, the gross profit per burrito is $3.75. Now, let's find out how many burgers Chad can make with this amount of money. Number of burgers = Gross profit / Cost of each burrito = $3.75 / $6.50 = 0.57 burgers (or 57%) Therefore, Chad can make approximately 57% of one burrito with the given amount of money.
Response:  According to the question, in one year, Canada has produced 360 million pounds of milk. This is equivalent to 4 million tons (360 million / 80 thousand pounds per ton). Now, let's calculate how many years it would take for Canada to produce half a billion tons of milk at this rate. We know that Canada produces 4 million tons of milk every year, so we can divide the total amount of milk produced by the number of years it takes to produce that much milk: Half a billion tons = Total milk produced / Number of years taken to produce that much milk Half a billion tons = 360 million pounds x 5 years = 1.8 billion pounds Therefore, it would take approximately 5 years for Canada to produce half a billion tons of milk at its current production rate.
"Response:  The first watermill produced 120 bags of wheat in one month. After two months, it was empty and then it started producing again after 80 days. So, in total, it produced 30% more than its original capacity during these two periods. Therefore, the number of bags of wheat produced by the second watermill is:

$$ \therefore NumberOfBags = \frac{TotalProduction}{OriginalCapacity} $$

Given that the original capacity of the watermill is $120$ bags per month, we can calculate the total production as follows:

$$ TotalProduction = 2 \times (120 + 80) = 2400 $$

So, the number of bags of wheat produced by the second watermill is:

$$ \therefore NumberOfBags = \frac{2400}{120} = 20 $$

Therefore, there are $20$ bags of wheat produced by the second watermill."
Response:  Firstly, Mark has invested $12 in each of the 12 companies. So, he has invested a total amount of $12 x 12 = $144.  Now, let's assume that each company gives him a return of 10% per annum. Therefore, his annual profit from these investments will be $144 x 10% = $14.400.  Next, we need to calculate how much money he makes after selling one share of each company. Since each share costs $20,000 and he owns 10% of each company, the value of one share is $20,000 / 10% = $200,000.  So, if he sells all his shares, he will make a profit of $200,000 - $14.400 = $185,600.
Response:  Per has 5 apples and gives 3 to Kareem. Now, Kareem has 20 apples in total.  Then, Kareem gave 10 apples to Munir twice, so now Munir has 30 apples in total.  Therefore, Kareem gave a total of 40 apples (30 + 10) to Munir.
Response:  If we have planted 100 seeds in a farm and 80 of them germinated, then the number of seedlings that are present in the field is 80. Now, if we want to calculate the total number of kernels (seeds) available for sowing in the same field after 50 days, we need to consider the following factors:  Number of seeds sown = Total number of kernels available for sowing = Number of seedlings x Number of kernels per seedling = 80 x 2 = 160 kernels. Therefore, there will be 160 kernels available for sowing in the field after 50 days.
Response:  We have 36 penguins in total, and each penguin can carry one fish at a time. So, if we assume that all the penguins are carrying fish simultaneously, then there will be 36 x 1 = 36 fish carried altogether. However, since some of the penguins may not be able to carry any fish due to various reasons (e.g., they might be too small or weak), let's assume that only half of them (i.e., 18 penguins) can actually carry fish. Therefore, the number of fish carried by these 18 penguins is 18 x 1 = 18 fish. Now, consider the situation where two penguins are standing on top of a hill and one of them throws a fish towards another penguin who is standing on top of a nearby mountain. In this case, the fish will travel through the air until it reaches its destination, which means that it will be exposed to the wind resistance during its flight. As a result, some of the fish may get lost or delayed in their journey, which could lead to a decrease in the overall number of fish carried by the penguins. To account for this uncertainty, let's assume that around 20% of the total number of fish carried by the penguins may get lost or delayed during transmission (i.e., 6 fish out of 36). Therefore, the final number of fish carried by the penguins after considering the loss/delay in transmission is 36 - 6 = 30 fish.
Response:  If Stationery has given away 10 tamarind balls to his girlfriend Freeda and he wants to know how many tamarinds are needed for each ball, then we can assume that one tamarind is equivalent to half a ball (since Stationery gave away 5 tamarind balls in total). Therefore, if Stationery wants to make 6 tamarind balls, he will need 6/2 = 3 tamarinds per ball. So, Stationery needs 3 x 6 = 18 tamarinds in total.
Response:  There are 20 friends and Jan wants to distribute 4 sweets each among them. So, he needs to distribute 80 sweets in total (4 x 20 = 80).
Response:  If Ram has 25 pens and he uses each pen for 5 days, then he will use all of them in total after 5 days. Now, if he buys new pens that are completely black, he will have 50 pens in total (including the old ones). So, after using all the old pens, he will have 45 pens left (since there were 25 old pens and now he has 50 pens in total). Therefore, the number of pens he will have after using all the old pens is 45.
Response:  Jan earned $20 in interest and added more $10 to it, making it a total of $30. After one year, the amount grew to $45 due to compounding. So, after two years, the amount would be $85 ($45 x 2).
Response:  Mirri jo an say do saal chhooti hai, jaisa 20 saal ki hai. So, if Jaisa is 20 years old, then her age after 5 years will be 25 years old. Now, let's calculate the ages of the other two girls. If one girl is 18 years old and the other is 16 years old, then their combined age is 34 years old. Therefore, the correct answer is 34 years old.
"Response:  There are 1000 students in the school and they are divided into three classes - A, B, and C. Each class has 30% of the total number of students. If 30% of the remaining students move out of their current class after one month, then the number of students in each class will be:

Class A: 30% of 700 (remaining students) = 210 students
Class B: 30% of 600 (remaining students) = 180 students
Class C: 30% of 500 (remaining students) = 150 students

So, there are 210 + 180 + 150 = 540 students in the three classes after one month."
Response:  If Jamie has $60 more than John, and John has $54, then Jamie has $60 + $54 = $114. Therefore, Jamie has $114 - $54 = $60 more than John.
Response:  There are two books written by Dolly and Panthera. If they read each other's books simultaneously, then at any given time, both of them will have read half of each other's book. So, in total, they will have read 2/3 of each other's book. Therefore, the number of books they will have read together is 6 (2 x 3).
Response:  There are 5 friends and they want to draw a line that connects them all. They decide to divide it into 6 equal parts of 1/6 each. Each part can be drawn in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) within its assigned segment. So, there are 6 possible ways to draw the line connecting the 5 friends, as shown below:  /_/\   |    |   |    |   / \   |    |   |    |   / _\  Now, let's count how many minutes it takes to draw each part of the line:  Part 1: 1 minute (drawn horizontally across the top) Part 2: 1 minute (drawn vertically upwards from one end) Part 3: 1 minute (drawn horizontally across the middle) Part 4: 1 minute (drawn vertically downwards from one end) Part 5: 1 minute (drawn horizontally across the bottom) Total time taken = 5 minutes Therefore, each friend has to spend 5 minutes drawing their respective part of the line, which adds up to a total of 30 minutes for all 5 friends together.
Response:  For one month (30 days), Jason has been spending $100 per day on his phone plan. So, in total, he has spent $3000 for that month ($100/day x 30 days). Now, if there are 30 days left in the current month and Jason has already spent $3000, then he has $2700 remaining ($3000 - $300 = $2700) in his account.
Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 francs and gave 5 to Calais. Then Calais gave him back 10 francs. So, Griffin has 14 francs left (24 - 5 + 10 = 14). If at the end of the game, Griffin had 27 francs, then he must have received 3 more francs from Calais (27 - 14 = 3). Therefore, Calais gave Griffin 3 francs.
Response:  In one of the microscopes, there are 4 cells, and in the other, there are 32 cells. To find out how many cells there are in total, we need to add the number of cells in both microscopes. So, the total number of cells is: 4 + 32 = 36 cells.
Response:  Genie made $250 in one hour through his art. He worked for six days and earned $1,500. To make a film, he needs $5,000. After making the film, he received $5,000 as commission from the distributor. So, Genie earned $10,500 ($5,000 + $5,500) in total. Now, let's calculate how much money Genie spent on each day of work: Total amount earned = $10,500 Days worked = 6 Days spent on work per day = 6/1 = 6 hours per day Hours spent on work per day x Amount earned per hour = 6 hours x $100 = $600 per day Therefore, Genie spent $600 per day on work.
Response:  Firstly, Asabil has spent Rs. 1200 on his daughter's wedding ceremony (Rs. 12 x 100 = Rs. 1200). Secondly, he has given Rs. 430 as dowry to the bride (Rs. 43 x 100 = Rs. 430). Thirdly, he has spent Rs. 150 on buying gifts for the guests (Rs. 15 x 100 = Rs. 150). Fourthly, he has given Rs. 400 as donation to the poor (Rs. 40 x 100 = Rs. 400). Lastly, he has spent Rs. 220 on buying clothes for himself and his friends (Rs. 22 x 100 = Rs. 220). Therefore, the total amount that Asabil has spent is: Rs. 1200 + Rs. 430 + Rs. 150 + Rs. 400 + Rs. 220 = Rs. 2890. So each person who attended the wedding ceremony received Rs. 2890 / 10 = Rs. 289 per head.
Response:  The weight of each big is 50 pounds and the price of one pound of peas is $1.50. So, if he bought 4 bags of peas, then the total cost of all four bags would be: Total Cost = Number of Bags x Price per Bag = 4 x $1.50 = $6.00 Now, we need to find out how many bags the shifter bought. Since he paid $6.00 for them, that means he bought 4 bags of peas. Therefore, the answer is (D) 4 bags.
Response:  According to the given information, Peer had 4 coins in his pocket and Mangal had 2 coins in her purse.  When Peer gave one coin to Mangal, he had 3 coins left (4 - 1 = 3).  Then, when Mangal gave two coins back to Peer, she had 2 coins left (2), and Peer received 2 coins from her (3 + 2 = 5). Therefore, the final number of coins that Peer has is 5.
