In year 1, there are no lemons produced and the cost of maintenance is $3. In years 2-4, the tree produces 7 lemons each year, which can be sold for $1.5 per lemon. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the tree in these 4 years is:
Year 1: $0 (no lemons produced)
Year 2: $10.5 ($7 x $1.5)
Year 3: $21 ($7 x $1.5 x 2)
Year 4: $28.5 ($7 x $1.5 x 3)
So, it will take 4 years for the lemon tree to start generating significant revenue."

Response:  The optimal choice for the merchant would be to buy jewelry worth $5000.  Explanation:  According to the information provided in the question, the trend of the market for jewelry is expected to increase by 2.5% over the next month, while the market for electronic devices is expected to increase by 1.2%. This means that if the merchant buys jewelry worth $5000, they will make a profit of $125 (2.5% of $5000) at the end of the month, which is higher than the profit they would make if they bought electronic devices worth $8000 ($8000 x 1.2% = $96). Therefore, the optimal choice for the merchant is to buy jewelry worth $5000 to maximize their profit at the end of the month.

Explanation:
Jill works as an English teacher for 35 hours per week and as a fitness trainer for 15 hours per week. Let's assume she works 50 weeks in a year (which is a reasonable assumption since most people work around 40-50 weeks per year).

As an English teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour, so her total weekly income from teaching is:

$20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700 per week

As a fitness trainer, Jill earns $30 per hour, so her total weekly income from training is:

$30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450 per week

Now let's calculate Jill's annual income based on these weekly amounts:

Annual income from teaching = $700/week x 50 weeks/year = $35,000
Annual income from training = $450/week x 50 weeks/year = $22,500
Total annual income = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."

"Response:  $48
Explanation:
Charlie can produce 10 candles for every kilogram of beeswax he buys. He pays $10 per kilogram of beeswax and sells each candle for $2. To calculate his total profit, we need to first find out how many candles he can produce with the beeswax he has bought.

Number of candles = Total weight of beeswax / Weight of one candle
= 10 kg / 0.5 kg (weight of one candle)
= 20 candles

Since he sells each candle for $2, his total revenue from selling these candles is:
Revenue = Number of candles x Price of one candle
= 20 candles x $2/candle
= $40

His total cost of producing these candles is:
Cost = Number of candles x Cost of producing one candle
= 20 candles x $10/candle
= $200

So, his profit is:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $40 - $200
= -$160

Therefore, Charlie's total profit is $48 ($40 in revenue minus $20 in costs)."

* 20% of the pomarančy are not ripe, which means that 5 pomarančov are not ripe (20% of 24 = 5).
* 2 pomarančy are sour (kyselé), so there are 23 good and sour pomarančy (24 - 2 = 23).
* The total number of good pomarančy is 24 + 5 + 2 = 31.
Therefore, there are 31 good pomarančy in the košík."

Explanation:
Sasha has noticed that the price of wood has increased by 50% over the past few months, when she bought some wood. Since then, she has decided to sell it. She has 10 pieces of 2x4 wood that cost $10 each and 5 pieces of 4x4 wood that cost $16 each. If she sells all of them, how much will she earn?

To calculate the total amount of money Sasha will earn, we need to multiply the number of pieces of each type of wood by its selling price. For the 2x4 wood, this is:

10 pieces x $10 per piece = $100

And for the 4x4 wood, this is:

5 pieces x $16 per piece = $80

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total amount of money Sasha will earn:

$100 + $80 = $380

Therefore, the answer is $380."

"Response:  $9000 per day.
Explanation:
The number of patients seen in one day is given as 500 patients. Each patient takes up 24 minutes of the doctor's time, so the total time spent by doctors on consultations is:
Time spent by doctors = Number of patients x Time per patient = 500 x 24/60 = 3000 minutes
Since each minute of doctor's time costs $150, the revenue generated from doctor's consultations is:
Revenue from doctor's consultations = Total time spent by doctors x Cost per minute = 3000 x $150 = $450,000 per day
Now, we need to subtract the cost of hospital services provided to patients. The question states that the hospital charges patients $200 per hour, and since there are 8 hours in a day (ignoring any leftover minutes), the total revenue generated from hospital services is:
Revenue from hospital services = Total time spent in hospital x Cost per hour = 8 x $200 = $1600 per day
So, the net revenue generated by the hospital is:
Net revenue = Revenue from doctor's consultations - Revenue from hospital services = $450,000 - $1600 = $434,000 per day."

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The obchodník buys several bushels of wheat from the farm for $20 per bushel.
* The cost of transporting each bushel from the farm to the storage is $2.
* After selling all the bushels, the obchodník earned $400.

Now, let's use these pieces of information to find out how many bushels were sold:

Total amount earned = Number of bushels sold x Price per bushel
= $400 x?

Since the obchodník earned $400, and he bought the wheat for $20 per bushel, we can set up the following equation:

$400 = (Number of bushels) x $20

To solve for number of bushels, divide both sides by $20:

Number of bushels = $400 / $20
= 20

So, the obchodník sold 20 bushels of wheat."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Jerry has two pools, one small and one large, with drains that can empty 4 gallons per minute.
* The small pool had twice as much water as the large pool 4 minutes ago.
* Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

So, if the small pool had 20 gallons of water 4 minutes ago (since it had twice as much water as the large pool), then the large pool must have 80 gallons of water now (since it has four times as much water as the small pool). Therefore, the answer is 20 gallons for the amount of water in the small pool now."

Explanation:
Kalinda can add 4 pieces in one minute, and her mother can add half of that amount in one minute as well. To find out how many minutes it will take for them to complete the task, we need to multiply their individual rates by the total number of pieces they have to add. In this case, there are 360 pieces to be added, which means it will take:

Kalinda's rate = 4 pieces/minute x 360 pieces = 1440 minutes (or 24 hours)
Mother's rate = 2 pieces/minute x 360 pieces = 720 minutes (or 12 hours)
Therefore, it will take Kalinda 24 hours and her mother 12 hours to complete the task."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The number of students in the hall is 1000.
* 30% of the students left through door A. This means that 300 students (30% of 1000) left through door A.
* 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., 700 students) left through door B. This means that 420 students (3/5 x 700) left through door B.
* The remaining students (i.e., 300 + 420 = 720) left through door C. Therefore, the number of students who left through door C is 720.

So, the total number of students who left the building is 300 + 420 + 720 = 1440.

Since the initial number of students was 1000, we can calculate the number of students who remained in the building as follows:

1000 - 1440 = 560

Therefore, there were 560 students who remained in the building after 30% of the students left through door A and some others left through doors B and C."
