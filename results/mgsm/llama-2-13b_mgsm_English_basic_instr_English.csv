"Response: 

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and invested an additional $50,000 in repairs.  
The increase in value was 150%, so we can calculate the new value as follows:
New Value = Old Value x (1 + Percentage Increase)
= $80,000 x (1 + 150%)
= $80,000 x 2.5
= $200,000

So, after putting in the repairs, the house is now worth $200,000.  To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the original purchase price from the new value:
Profit = New Value - Original Purchase Price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000 on his investment of $80,000 plus the $50,000 he spent on repairs."

"Response:  To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal of the day, we can use the following calculation:  
Cups of feed per chicken = Total number of cups of feed / Number of chickens 
We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon, so the total number of cups of feed per day is:  
Total cups of feed = 15 + 25 = 40 cups 
We also know that there are 20 chickens in Wendi's flock, so the number of chickens is:  
Number of chickens = 20 
Now we can calculate the cups of feed needed for the final meal of the day using the formula above:  
Cups of feed per chicken = Total number of cups of feed / Number of chickens 
Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:  
Cups of feed per chicken = 40 / 20 = 2 cups per chicken 
Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 2 x 20 = 40 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"Response: 

To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we first calculate the cost of one glass:

One glass = $5

Now, we calculate the cost of two glasses:

Two glasses = (2 x $5) = $10

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, the cost of the remaining 14 glasses can be calculated as follows:

Cost of 14 glasses = (14 x $10 / 2) = $70

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $70 for 16 glasses."

Hint: Calculate Eliza's total hours worked and then calculate her earnings based on her regular hourly rate and overtime pay."
"Response: 
Let x be the number of downloads in the first month. Since there were 60 downloads in the first month, we can write an equation based on this information:
x + 3(3x) = 60 + 9x
Simplifying the equation:
4x + 9x = 60 + 27x
13x = 87
Dividing both sides by 13:
x = 7
So, there were 7 downloads in the first month.
Now, let's find out how many downloads there were in each of the other two months:
In the second month, there were 3 times as many downloads as there were in the first month:
3x = 3(7) = 21
Therefore, there were 21 downloads in the second month.
In the third month, there were 30% fewer downloads than in the second month:
21 - (30/100) \* 21 = 21 - 6.3 = 14.7
Since you cannot have a fraction of a download, round up to the nearest whole number:
15 downloads in the third month.
Total downloads over the three months:
7 + 21 + 15 = 43"

"Response: 
The merchant should choose the option with higher percentage increase in value over the given period. In this case, the jewelry market has a higher percentage increase (2.5%) than the electronic gadgets market (1.2%). Therefore, if the merchant chooses the jewelry option, he/she can expect a greater profit return compared to choosing the electronic gadgets option.  
To calculate the expected profit, we need to know the initial investment and the final value after the specified time period. Let's assume the initial investment for both options is $5,000 (jewelry) and $8,000 (electronic gadgets). After one month, the jewelry market increases by 2.5%, so the final value of the jewelry investment would be:

$5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125

Similarly, the electronic gadgets market increases by 1.2%, so the final value of the electronic gadgets investment would be:

$8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096

Now, let's compare the two options based on their expected profits:

Option 1 (Jewelry): Expected Profit = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets): Expected Profit = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since Option 1 (Jewelry) has a higher expected profit ($125), it is the better choice for the merchant who wants to maximize his/her profit at the end of the month."

The total amount of liquid in the mixture will be the sum of the volumes of both liquids. The volume of the orange drink is given as 10 L, and since 2/3 of it is water, the volume of water in the orange drink is 6.67 L (2/3 x 10). 
The volume of the pineapple drink is given as 15 L, and since 3/5 of it is water, the volume of water in the pineapple drink is 9 L (3/5 x 15).
After adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink, we lose one liter due to spilling, so the final volume of the mixture is:
6.67 + 9 = 15.67 L
Therefore, there are 15.67 liters of water in the remaining mixture."

The original price of the book can be found by multiplying the amount paid after the discount (19.50) by the ratio of the original price to the sale price (1/0.75). Therefore, we have:

Original Price = 19.50 x 1 / 0.75
= 19.50 x 4
= 78

So, the original price of the book was $78."
"Response: 

Let x be the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Since each box costs $8.50, we can calculate the amount Marie spent on pizza as follows:

x \* 8.50 = 8.50x

We know that Marie spent a total of $50 on all her purchases, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:

8.50x + 12 + 3(5) + 1.50(4) = 50

Simplifying the equation by combining like terms, we get:

8.50x + 60 + 6 = 50

Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:

8.50x = 44

Dividing both sides by 8.50 gives us:

x = 5

Therefore, Marie ordered 5 boxes of pizza."

"Response: 
Let's say the price of each pair of heels be x and y respectively. Then we can write the equation based on the information given in the problem as follows:
x + y = 33 + (2x)
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
x + y = 33 + 2x
Combine like terms:
3x + y = 66...(1)
Now, we know that the total cost of both pairs of heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. So, we can set up another equation as follows:
Boots - (x + y) = 5
Substituting the value of x and y from equation (1), we get:
Boots - (3x + y) = 5
Expand and simplify:
3x + y - Boots = 5
Solve for Boots:
Boots = 3x + y + 5
Since Gloria wants to spend only her shoe budget, we know that the cost of the boots must be equal to her shoe budget. Therefore, we can substitute the value of her shoe budget for Boots in the previous equation:
3x + y + 5 = Budget
Now solve for x and y:
We have two equations and two variables. Solving them simultaneously, we get:
x = 20
y = 13
Therefore, the first pair of heels costs $20 and the second pair costs twice as much, or $40. The total cost of both pairs of heels is $60, which is five dollars less than the cost of the boots.
So, the cost of the boots is:
Boots = Budget = $65"
"Response: 
Let A be Allen's current age = 11x (since Darrel's age is 7x)
Allen's age after 10 years will be A + 10 = 11x + 10...(1)
Their total age now is given as 162, so we can write:
7x + 11x = 162
...(2)
Simplifying equation (2), we get:
18x = 162
x = 9
So, Allen's current age is:
A = 11x = 11(9) = 99
Allen's age after 10 years will be:
A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109
Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"Response: 
Let's start by analyzing each of the given estimates:

1. The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar.
2. The second friend says there are 20 more than half the first estimate, which means there are 20 + (40/2) = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend says there are 25% more than the first estimate, so there are 80 x 1.25 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, let's calculate the average of these three estimates:

(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = (140 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 300 / 3 = 100

So, the average guess of Gunter's friends is 100 jelly beans in the jar."

"Response: 

Let's start by identifying what we know:

* John sold all of his Lego sets for $15 each, so he made $15 x 13 = $195 from selling his Lego sets.
* He spent $20 x 8 = $160 on video games.
* He has $5 left over after buying the video games.

Now let's think about how much money John had before he bought the video games. He started with $195 from selling his Lego sets, and he spent $160 on video games, so he had $195 - $160 = $35 left over.

Since John has $5 left over after buying the video games, that means he must have $35 - $5 = $30 left over after buying the video games.

So, John still has $30 worth of Lego sets."
"Response: 
John runs for 3 hours on the first day of his three-day running schedule, so he runs at a pace of 3/2 = 1.5 miles per hour (mph) during that time. On the second and third days, he runs for half as long, so he runs at a pace of 1.5 x 0.5 = 0.75 mph during those times. Therefore, John's average running speed is (1.5 + 0.75) / 2 = 1.125 mph."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. This means that her running speed is 4x her walking speed.
2. She can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means that her skipping speed is (1/2) x 4x her walking speed = 2x her walking speed.
3. She can skip at 3 miles per hour.
4. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Now let's think about how we can use this information to find out how far Dana can travel in six hours. We know that she can run for one-third of the time and walk for two-thirds of the time. So, if she runs for x hours, she walks for 6 - x hours.

Since she runs at a speed of 4x her walking speed, she covers a distance of 4x(walking speed) = 4x(3) = 12 miles per hour while running. Therefore, the total distance she covers during the entire six hours is:

Distance covered while running + Distance covered while walking = 12 miles/hour x x hours + 3 miles/hour x (6 - x) hours
= 12x + 9x
= 21x

So, the total distance Dana can cover in six hours is 21x miles.

Now, we need to determine what value of x will give us the correct answer. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we know that x = 2.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Dana can travel 21(2) = 42 miles in six hours."

"Response: 

To determine how many grams of chips I can eat based on my daily calorie target and previous consumption, we need to calculate the remaining calories available for the day. We know that our daily calorie target is 2000 calories and we have already consumed 1800 calories from other sources. Therefore, the remaining calories available are:

Remaining Calories = Daily Calorie Target - Previous Consumption
= 2000 - 1800
= 200

Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the number of calories in each serving to find out how many servings we can consume:

Number of Servings = Remaining Calories / Number of Calories per Serving
= 200 / 250
= 0.8

Therefore, I can eat 0.8 bags (or 4 servings) of chips based on my daily calorie target and previous consumption. Each serving would be approximately 250 calories x 4 = 1000 calories."

To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, first calculate how much weight he will save by removing the comic books:

30 comic books x 1/4 pound per comic book = 7 1/2 pounds saved

Now, subtract the weight saved from the total weight of the bag:

Total weight of bag - weight saved = 15 pounds - 7 1/2 pounds = 7 1/2 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7 1/2 pounds / 1/2 pound per toy = 15 toys

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag to reduce its weight by 15 pounds."

"Response: 3 x (thrice the number of adopted kittens) + 12 =?

Step-by-step solution:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Patchy, the first cat, has thrice the number of adopted kittens as the number of kittens adopted from the shelter.
* Trixie, the second cat, has 12 kittens.

We can let ""x"" represent the number of kittens adopted from the shelter. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given:

Patchy's kittens = 3x
Trixie's kittens = 12

Total kittens = Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
= 3x + 12

Now, we need to find the value of ""x"". We know that the total number of kittens is 7, so we can set up the following equation:

3x + 12 = 7

Solve for ""x"":

3x = 7 - 12
3x = -5

x = -5/3

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 7 - 5 = 2 kittens."

To find out how much Aleena has paid at the end of the year, we need to calculate the cost for each half-year period separately. Let's assume that the first six months of the year are the ""first half"" and the last six months are the ""second half.""

For the first half of the year (January to June), Aleena was charged $140 x 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year (July to December), Aleena was charged $140 x 6 = $840, but since it is now 10% cheaper, she was actually charged 90% of the original price, which is:

$840 x 0.9 = $756

So, in total, Aleena paid $840 + $756 = $1,606 for the entire year."

"Response: 

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Jim watches TV for 2 hours per session (we can call this x).
* He reads for half as long as he watches TV (so if he watches TV for x hours, he reads for x/2 hours).
* He does this 3 times a week (so he has 3 sessions of TV and reading each week).
* There are 4 weeks in a month (so we need to find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading over 4 weeks).

Now let's think about how we can use this information to find our answer. We know that Jim spends x hours watching TV and x/2 hours reading during each session. Since there are 3 sessions per week, he spends 3x hours watching TV and 3x/2 hours reading per week.

To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading over 4 weeks, we just need to multiply the number of hours he spends per week by 4:

Total hours spent on TV = 3x x 4 = 12x
Total hours spent on reading = 3x/2 x 4 = 6x/2

So, over 4 weeks, Jim spends a total of 12x hours watching TV and 6x/2 hours reading."

There are 175 diamonds. 
There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. 
Twice as many emeralds as rubies.  We can begin by writing an equation based on this information: 
Let R be the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, we know that R = 175 - 35 = 140. 
Now, let E be the number of emeralds. Since there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, we know that E = 2R = 2(140) = 280. 
We also know that there are 175 diamonds. So, the total number of gems is: 
D + R + E = 175 + 140 + 280 = 695.  Therefore, there were 695 gems in the treasure chest."

Now let's calculate the interest for each phone using the formula: Interest = Total Cost x Rate/100: 
Interest per Phone = $750 x 2/100 = $15 
So the total interest for all five phones is: Total Interest = 5 x $15 = $75 
Now we can calculate the monthly payment for each phone using the formula: Monthly Payment = Total Cost + Interest / Number of Months: 
Monthly Payment per Phone = ($750 + $15) / 3 = $250 / 3 = $83.33 
Since Sheila is buying five phones, her total monthly payment would be: Total Monthly Payment = 5 x $83.33 = $416.65 
Therefore, Sheila will pay $416.65 each month for three months to purchase the five cell phones."

To find out how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the total amount he will receive from each type of flower and then add them up. Since Artie rounds all his prices to the nearest dollar, we can use whole dollars instead of decimals.

For marigolds, 12 x $2 = $24
For petunias, 9 x $1 = $9
For begonias, 17 x $2 = $34
Total amount Artie will make = $24 + $9 + $34 = $67"
"Response: 
The formula for finding the area of a level in a pyramid or prism is A = (base x height) / 2. Since we know the base and height of each level, we can use this formula to find the area of each level. We also know that the total area of all four levels is equal to the area of the top level, so we can set up an equation based on that. Let's start by finding the area of each level:
Level 1: A = (base x height) / 2 = (8 x 4) / 2 = 32 sq ft
Level 2: A = (base x height) / 2 = (4 x 4) / 2 = 16 sq ft
Level 3: A = (base x height) / 2 = (2 x 4) / 2 = 8 sq ft
Level 4: A = (base x height) / 2 = (1 x 4) / 2 = 4 sq ft
Now, let's add up the areas of all four levels to get the total area:
Total Area = 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 = 50 sq ft
Since the top level has a square footage of 16, we know that the average square footage of a level is:
Average Square Footage = Total Area / Number of Levels = 50 / 4 = 12.5 sq ft per level
Therefore, the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle is 12.5 sq ft."

To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of 18 flowers at both prices and compare them.

At $2.50 per package of 3 flowers, the cost of 18 flowers would be:

18 x $2.50 = $45

At $1.00 per package of 2 flowers, the cost of 18 flowers would be:

18 x $1.00 = $18

So, Vincent saves $27 ($45 - $18) by buying 18 flowers at the better price of $1.00 per package of 2 flowers."

Step-by-step solution: 

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each part separately. We know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, so we can start by calculating how long it would take to cover the first 3 miles of the city.  

Time taken to cover 3 miles = 10 minutes (given)  
Time taken to cover 1 mile = Time taken to cover 3 miles / 3 miles  
Time taken to cover 1 mile = 10 minutes / 3 miles  
Time taken to cover 1 mile = 3.33 minutes (approximately)  
Now, let's calculate the total time taken to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles long.  
Total time taken = Number of miles x Time taken to cover 1 mile  
Total time taken = 42 miles x 3.33 minutes/mile  
Total time taken = 140.66 minutes (approximately)  
Therefore, it would take approximately 140.66 minutes (or about 2 hours and 20 minutes) for the fog bank to cover the entire city."

The formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism (box) is V = length x width x height.  Since each box has the same dimensions, we can use one set of values to find the volume of any of the boxes.  
Let's call the length, width and height of each box ""L"", ""W"" and ""H"" respectively.  So, the volume of each box would be:
V = L x W x H = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches
Since there are three boxes, the total inner volume of all three boxes would be:
Total Volume = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches"
"Response: 2

Explanation: Let's break down the information we have about Frankie's viewing habits:

Monday and Tuesday: Each night, Frankie watched one hour of his favorite show.
Wednesday: He watched ""a few"" episodes of a 30-minute show. Since there is no specific number given, let's assume he watched three 30-minute episodes (3 x 30 = 90 minutes).
Thursday: He watched one hour of his favorite show and one 30-minute show.
Friday: He stayed up late and watched two hours of TV, which included two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's add up the total amount of time Frankie spent watching TV:

Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours/night x 2 nights = 4 hours
Wednesday: 90 minutes
Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours
Total: 4 + 90 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, and he watched 30-minute shows on Wednesday, we can calculate how many 30-minute episodes he watched as follows:

7 hours - 4 hours (from Monday and Tuesday) - 90 minutes (from Wednesday) = 2.5 hours

Therefore, Frankie watched 2.5 hours of 30-minute shows on Wednesday, which translates to 2 episodes (2.5 hours / 30 minutes per episode = 2)."
"Response: 

To solve this problem, we need to use information from the text that states ""he made twice as many cookies as he did last year."" This means that if he baked x cookies last year, then he baked 2x cookies this year. We also know that he dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, so he has a total of 110 cookies left. Let's set up an equation based on this information:

2x + 5 = 110

Now we can simplify the equation by subtracting 5 from both sides:

2x = 105

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us the solution:

x = 52.5

So, Henry baked 52.5 cookies last year."

"Response: 

To calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the area of each rectangle by its length. For Beatrice's rectangle, this gives us:

(2 x 24) x 24 = 960

For Marcell's rectangle, this gives us:

(3 x 14) x 14 = 504

So Beatrice ate 960 fruit roll-ups and Marcell ate 504 fruit roll-ups. To find out their average consumption, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person by the number of roll-ups in their respective rectangles:

Average for Beatrice: 960 / (2 x 24) = 48 per roll-up

Average for Marcell: 504 / (3 x 14) = 36 per roll-up

Therefore, Beatrice ate an average of 48 fruit roll-ups per roll-up, and Marcell ate an average of 36 fruit roll-ups per roll-up."

Number of times the whiteboard is used per lesson = 2 (for each teacher) x 2 lessons per day = 4 times per day

Number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per use = 3 times per use

Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:

Total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned = Number of times the whiteboard is used x Number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per use
= 4 x 3

Sasha can calculate her total cost of the lumber she purchased as follows:

Total Cost = (10 x $10) + (5 x $16) = $100 + $80 = $180

She sold all of the lumber for $30 per board, so she can calculate her revenue as follows:

Revenue = (10 x $30) + (5 x $30) = $300 + $150 = $450

To find her profit, she subtracts her total cost from her revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Total Cost = $450 - $180 = $270

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $270 by selling her leftover lumber."

Let L be Lylah's current salary (in thousands of dollars). Then we know that Adrien's current salary is 40% greater than Lylah's, so Adrien's current salary is:
A = L + (L/100) \* 40

We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's salary at that time, so Lylah's salary four years ago was:
L - 30%

And we are told that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, so:
A - 4 = (L - 30%) \* 4

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (L and A). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

L = 60,000
A = 84,000

So Lylah's current salary is $60,000, and Adrien's current salary is $84,000."

"Response: 

Rosie can run at two different speeds - 10 miles/hour and 5 miles/hour. To find out how far she can run in total, we need to calculate her running distance based on each speed separately. Let's start with the first part of the problem where she runs at 10 miles/hour for 3 hours.  

Time = Distance / Speed 
Distance = Time x Speed 

In this case, 

Time = 3 hours 
Speed = 10 miles/hour 

Distance = Time x Speed 
Distance = 3 x 10 
Distance = 30 miles 

Now let's move on to the second part of the problem where she runs at 5 miles/hour for 4 hours. 

Time = Distance / Speed 
Distance = Time x Speed 

In this case, 

Time = 4 hours 
Speed = 5 miles/hour 

Distance = Time x Speed 
Distance = 4 x 5 
Distance = 20 miles 

Total distance covered by Rosie in 7 hours is the sum of the distances she covers during both parts of the problem. Therefore, the total distance she can run in 7 hours is: 

Total Distance = Distance (Part 1) + Distance (Part 2) 
= 30 miles + 20 miles 
= 50 miles 

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours."

Step-by-step solution:

Let x be the cost of one pepper. Since there are 20 peppers, the total cost of peppers is 20x.

A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, so the cost of four watermelons is 4(3x) = 12x.

An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so the cost of ten oranges is 10(12x - 5) = 12x - 50.

The total cost of all fruits is 20x + 12x - 50 = 32x - 50.

Since each pepper costs $15, we have:

32x - 50 = 15(20)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So, the total cost of all fruits is:

32x - 50 = 32(8) - 50
= 256 - 50
= 206

Therefore, Dillon will spend $206 on fruits."

2. Twice as many babies as queens: If there are y queens, then there are 2y babies.
3. Total number of bees is 700.

Now we can set up an equation based on these statements:

2x + 2y = 700...(1)

We know that x represents the number of baby bees and y represents the number of queens.

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 490 (baby bees)
y = 245 (queens)

So, there are 490 worker bees (2x)."

To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate how many hours he spends playing video games and then subtract that number of hours from the total number of hours in a week. Let's assume that there are 7 days in a week with 24 hours per day, so there are 7 x 24 = 168 hours in a week.

Jordan spends 2 hours per day playing video games, which is equivalent to 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week. So, if he spent all of his video game time working instead, he would have worked for 168 - 14 = 154 hours per week.

To calculate the total cost of all items before taxes, we need to add up their prices:

Milk = $2
Eggs = $3
Light Bulbs = $3
Cups = $3
Roach Traps = $4
Total Cost Before Taxes = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Now, let's apply the 10% tax rate to only the non-food items (light bulbs, cups, and roach traps):

Tax on Light Bulbs = $3 x 10% = $0.30
Tax on Cups = $3 x 10% = $0.30
Tax on Roach Traps = $4 x 10% = $0.40
Total Tax = $0.30 + $0.30 + $0.40 = $0.90

To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in one year, we need to calculate how many times he can harvest them within that period. Since he can harvest every three months, he will have four opportunities for harvesting within a year (4 x 3 = 12). 
Now, let's multiply the number of opportunities by the number of pineapples per hectare:  
10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare = 1,000 pineapples per hectare x 4 opportunities = 4,000 pineapples per year. 
Therefore, John can harvest approximately 4,000 pineapples within a year."

To find out how many blocks Johnny will pick up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces in each Lego set and then add them up.

The first set has 500 pieces, so there are 500 blocks in that set.

The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, so it has 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces.

Adding up all these numbers gives us a total of:

500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

So Johnny will pick up 2125 blocks if he picks up all the Legos."

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, he receives 
Change = $60 - $10 
= $50"
Response: 5 fries remained after all the animals had eaten their fill. To find out how many fries were originally in the pack, we need to subtract what was left over (5) from what the seagull ate (half of 14 = 7). So there were 19 - 7 = 12 fries in the original pack.

Monday, Wednesday, Friday (3 x 1 hour) = 3 hours/day x 3 days/week = 9 hours/week
Tuesday, Thursday (2 x 2 hours) = 2 hours/day x 2 days/week = 4 hours/week
Total hours per week = 9 + 4 = 13 hours/week
Total hours for 16 weeks = 13 hours/week x 16 weeks = 208 hours"
"Response: 

To find out how long the baked goods are when put end-to-end, we need to calculate their total length. We can do this by multiplying the number of items by their respective lengths.

Rolls: 300 x 4 = 1200 inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot)
Chocolate Croissants: 120 x 6 = 720 inches
Baguettes: 60 x 2 = 120 inches

Total length: 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they would be 2040 inches or 170 feet long."

"Response: 
The total value of all the toys is equal to the sum of their individual values. Let's calculate each toy's value first:

1. Red Cars (5): Each red car costs $4, so the total value of all red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.
2. Action Figures (3): One action figure costs $5, so the total value of all action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.
3. Doll: The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so its value is also $15.

Now, let's add up the total value of all toys:
$20 + $15 + $15 = $50

Therefore, all the toys together are worth $50 if an action figure costs $5."

To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring an accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the cost of doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring an accountant. We can start by calculating the cost of doing her taxes herself:

Cost of doing taxes herself = 3 hours x $35/hour = $105

Next, we can calculate the cost of hiring an accountant:

Cost of hiring an accountant = $90

Now, we subtract the cost of doing her taxes herself from the cost of hiring an accountant to find out how much more money Jackie will have by hiring an accountant:

$90 - $105 = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more by hiring an accountant than by doing her taxes herself."

To find out how much each uniform costs, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them up. Let's start by finding the cost of the hat:
Cost of hat = $25
Next, let's find the cost of the jacket:
Cost of jacket = 3 x Cost of hat = 3 x $25 = $75
Now, let's find the cost of the pants:
Cost of pants = (Average of hat and jacket) = ($25 + $75)/2 = ($100)/2 = $50
So, the total cost of one uniform is:
Total cost = Cost of hat + Cost of jacket + Cost of pants = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150
Therefore, each uniform costs $150 in total."
"Response: 
To find out how many legs Jake sees, we need to add up all the numbers given in the problem. Let's start by adding the number of spiders and insects:

80 (spiders) x 8 (legs per spider) = 640 legs
90 (insects) x 6 (legs per insect) = 540 legs
Total so far: 640 + 540 = 1180 legs
Now let's add the number of rare mutant invertebrates:

3 (rare mutant invertebrates) x 10 (legs per invertebrate) = 30 legs
Total: 1180 + 30 = 1210 legs
Therefore, Jake sees a total of 1210 legs in the Museum of Entomology."

"Response: 
To calculate the total amount paid per year, we need to multiply the monthly amounts by 12. For example, if the minimum payment for a loan or credit card is $X per month, then the annual payment would be $X x 12.

So, for Jessica's student loans with a minimum payment of $300/month, the annual payment would be $300 x 12 = $3600.
For her credit card with a minimum payment of $200/month, the annual payment would be $200 x 12 = $2400.
And for her mortgage with a minimum payment of $500/month, the annual payment would be $500 x 12 = $6000.

If Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum, she will pay an additional $150 per month for her student loans ($300 x 50%), $100 per month for her credit card ($200 x 50%), and $250 per month for her mortgage ($500 x 50%).

Therefore, Jessica's total annual payment would be:
$3600 (student loans) + $2400 (credit card) + $6000 (mortgage) = $11,800

Adding the extra payments, Jessica's total annual payment would be:
$11,800 + $1800 (extra payment for student loans) + $1200 (extra payment for credit card) + $3750 (extra payment for mortgage) = $17,950"
"Response: 
To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to peel and cut each potato, then multiply that by the number of potatoes he needs to prepare. Let’s break down the steps involved:
1) Peeling: Each potato takes 1.5 minutes to peel (on average). Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time spent peeling them would be:
60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes
2) Cutting: After peeling, each potato takes 5 seconds to cut. So, the total time spent cutting all 60 potatoes would be:
60 x 5 = 300 seconds
Now, let’s add the two times together to find the overall time it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes:
90 + 300 = 480 minutes
Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 480 minutes or 8 hours to finish prepping all 60 potatoes for his big family reunion barbecue!"

Step-by-step solution:
1. Calculate total revenue generated by Juan and Carlos from selling lemonade.
Revenue = Number of Glasses Sold x Price Per Glass
= 20 Gallons x $0.50/Gallon
= $10
2. Calculate total cost of producing one gallon of lemonade.
Cost = Cost of Lemons + Cost of Sugar
= $3 (Lemons) + $2 (Sugar)
= $5
3. Calculate total profit earned by Juan and Carlos.
Profit = Revenue - Total Cost
= $10 - $5
= $5
4. Since the problem states that Juan and Carlos made a profit of $25, we can set up an equation to represent this information:
$5 = $25 - Total Spent on Lemons
Solve for Total Spent on Lemons:
Total Spent on Lemons = $25 - $5
= $20
Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $20 on lemons."

"Response: 

Step-by-step solution:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent:
Rent = Salary x (1/4)
= 6000 x (1/4)
= 1500
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
Car Fuel = Salary x (1/3)
= 6000 x (1/3)
= 2000
3. Calculate the amount donated to charity:
Donation = Salary - (Rent + Car Fuel)
= 6000 - (1500 + 2000)
= 6000 - 3500
= 2500
4. Calculate the amount given to daughter:
Daughter's Allowance = Salary x (1/10)
= 6000 x (1/10)
= 600
5. Calculate the amount given to wife:
Wife's Budget = Salary x (9/10)
= 6000 x (9/10)
= 5400
6. Calculate the total amount left with Zaid:
Total Left = Salary - (Rent + Car Fuel + Donation + Daughter's Allowance + Wife's Budget)
= 6000 - (1500 + 2000 + 2500 + 600 + 5400)
= 6000 - 8500
= -2500

Therefore, Zaid will have $2500 left after all these expenses and donations."

Let's start by identifying what we know about each person's number of crabs:
Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monica has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has ten more crabs than Monica, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.
Therefore, the total number of crabs that Bo, Monica, and Rani have together is:
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monica) + 46 (Rani) = 122
So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."

Mandy needs to pay Benedict = (100 x 1.02^3) = 106.48
Explanation: To calculate the amount that Mandy needs to pay Benedict, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount (in this case, $100), r is the monthly interest rate (which is 2%/month or 0.02), and n is the number of periods (which is 3 months in this case). So, A = $100(1 + 0.02)^3 = $106.48."

Let X be the number of bags sold by the trader. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem as follows:  
2X + 2 = 400... (1)
We know that the cost of transporting one bag is $2, so the total cost of transportation for X bags will be:  
Transportation Cost = 2X... (2)
The revenue generated by selling X bags at $30 each is:  
Revenue = 30X... (3)
Since the trader made a total profit of $400, the difference between the revenue and the cost must be equal to the profit:  
Profit = Revenue - Cost = 30X - 2X = 28X... (4)
Now we have four equations (1), (2), (3), and (4) with four variables (X). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  
X = 16... (5)
Therefore, the trader sold 16 bags of wheat."

Let's start by identifying the information we have been given:

1. The three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair.
2. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
3. They went on two different rides that cost $33 each.

We can start by calculating the total amount spent on tickets and food:

Tickets: 3 x $6 = $18
Food: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
Total: $18 + $15.75 = $33.75

Now let's calculate the cost of the two rides:

Ride 1: $33
Ride 2: $33
Total ride cost: $33 + $33 = $66

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each person paid one-third of the total cost. To find out how much each person paid, we can divide the total cost by 3:

$33.75 + $66 = $99.75

$99.75 / 3 = $33.25

Therefore, each friend paid $33.25."

2. In the first month, she collects three times as many cards, so she collects 3 x 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collects 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month, so she collects 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collects twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first two months, so she collects 2(40 + 60) = 2(100) = 200 cards.

Therefore, Elaine has a total of 200 Pokémon cards."

Let X be the amount that Mark makes from Publisher A in cents. Since he edits the same number of sentences for both publishers, X + Y = 1000 (where Y is the amount that Mark makes from Publisher B). We know that Publisher B pays double what Publisher A pays, so we can write: Y = 2X. Substituting this into the first equation, we get: X + 2X = 1000. Combining like terms, we have: 3X = 1000. Dividing by 3, we find that X = 333. Therefore, Mark makes $333 from Publisher A and $666 from Publisher B, for a total of $999 per week."

To calculate the total amount earned by John for the entire year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the permanent raise in his salary.

Firstly, let's calculate the one-time monetary reward:

$5000 x (1/52) = $96.15 per week (for 52 weeks)

Now, let's calculate the permanent raise in his salary:

5% of $2000 = $100 per week (permanent raise)

So, John's new weekly salary after receiving the award would be:

$2000 + $100 = $2100 per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, John's total earnings for the year would be:

$2100 x 52 = $107,200

Therefore, John made $107,200 in that year, including both the one-time monetary reward and the permanent raise in his salary."

Total number of pens = G + Y + B + R
We can calculate this as follows:
G + Y + 54 + 12 =?
First, let's add the green and yellow pens together:
G + Y = 22 + 10 = 32
Now, let's add the total number of blue and red pens to the sum:
32 + 54 + 12 =?
Simplify:
32 + 54 + 12 = 98
Therefore, Janet has 98 pens in total."
"Response: 

Step-by-step explanation: 

Let X be the score that Brinley gets on the sixth test. To find out what score Brinley needs to get an average of 93, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total score for the first five tests by adding up all her scores: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458.
2. Divide the total score by 6 (the number of tests): 458 / 6 = 76.33.
3. Since Brinley can remove one low score, we will drop the lowest score of 71 from the calculation. This leaves us with a new total score of 458 - 71 = 387.
4. Now, divide the new total score by 5 (the number of tests without the dropped score): 387 / 5 = 77.4.
5. To get an average of 93, Brinley needs to have a final score of at least 93 x 6 = 558. Therefore, she needs to score at least 558 - 77.4 = 480.6 on the sixth test.

So, Brinley needs to score at least 480.6 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."

To find out how many kilometers Michael has done in total, we need to calculate the distance traveled by him during each of his cycling sessions. Let's break down the information given in the question into different parts:

1. During the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike 5 times a week, with a distance of 25 km each time. So, the total distance traveled during this period is:

5 x 25 km/week = 125 km/week

Since there are 4 weeks, the total distance traveled during this period is:

125 km/week x 4 weeks = 500 km

2. After four weeks, Michael reduced the frequency of his cycling to 2 times a week, but increased the distance to 60 km each time. So, the total distance traveled during the next three weeks is:

2 x 60 km/week = 120 km/week

Since there are 3 weeks, the total distance traveled during this period is:

120 km/week x 3 weeks = 360 km

Now, let's add up the total distance traveled by Michael over both periods:

Total distance traveled = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Michael has done is 860 km."

To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn in order to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Sara will have after completing all of her babysitting jobs and compare it to the cost of the items she wants to purchase.

First, let's calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting:

4 x $5 = $20

Sara will earn $20 from babysitting.

Next, let's add this amount to the $10 that Sara already has:

$10 + $20 = $30

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to purchase:

Jacket: $30
2 pairs of shoes: $20 x 2 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Since the total cost of the items is $70, and Sara only has $30, she will need to mow the lawn more times to earn enough money to afford everything. To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can divide the total cost by the amount she earns per mowing:

$70 / $5 = 14

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 14 times to be able to afford the jacket and shoes."

"Response: 40 hours 
Explanation:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work in order to afford the shoes and belt, we need to calculate the total cost of both items and then divide that number by her hourly wage.  
Total Cost = Shoes + Belt = $320 + $32 = $352 
Divide Total Cost by Hourly Wage: 
$352 / $8.00/hour = 44 hours 
Since you cannot work a fraction of an hour, round up to the nearest whole number: 
44 hours rounded up to 40 hours 
Therefore, Lori needs to work 40 hours at her part-time job to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt."

Response: 4 (roses) + 7 (dahlias) = 11.
"Response: 3 x 21 = 63 + (1/2) x 21 = 35.5; therefore, the average age of the three in three years will be 63 + 35.5 = 98.5 years old."
"Response: 
Let N = Naomi's score
Y = Yuri's score
B = Brianna's score
J = Jojo's score
N + Y + B + J = 251... (1)
We know that Y is equal to half of N plus some amount, so we can write:
Y = (1/2)N + x
where x is the number of points Yuri scored beyond what Naomi scored.
Substituting this into equation (1), we get:
N + (1/2)N + x + B + J = 251
Combine like terms:
3N/2 + x + B + J = 251
Now we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. We are given that Jojo scored 17 points more than Naomi, so we can write:
J = N + 17
Substitute this into equation (3):
N + (1/2)N + x + (N + 17) = 251
Combine like terms:
3N/2 + x + 2N + 17 = 251
Simplify:
4N/2 + x + 17 = 251
Since all variables are integers, we know that N, Y, B, and J must be integer values. Therefore, we can round up any fractional parts to the nearest whole number. In particular, since N has an even number of points, it must be divisible by 2. So we can divide both sides of equation (4) by 2 to get:
2N/2 + x + 9 = 251
Simplify:
N + x + 9 = 126
Since N is at least 1, we have:
N = 1 + x + 9 = 10
x = 9
So Yuri scored 9 points more than Naomi. Substituting this back into equation (1), we get:
N + (1/2)N + x + B + J = 251
N + (1/2)(10) + 9 + B + J = 251
10 + 5 + 9 + B"
Response: 3 x 10 + 8 x 5 = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes.
"Response: 
Let x be the number of liters of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. Since she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + (2x) = 90 + (2x)

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 90

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 30

Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank now."
Response: 90 + (40 x 90/100) = 90 + 36 = 126 flowers.
"Response: 
The company spent $15000 on advertising in the first year, so we know that:  
Advertising expense (Year 1) = $15000 
In the second year, the company spends one-third of this amount, which is:  
Advertising expense (Year 2) = $15000 / 3 = $5000 
Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for both years is:  
Total Advertising Expense = Advertising expense (Year 1) + Advertising expense (Year 2) = $15000 + $5000 = $20000"

"Response: 18 minutes.
Explanation: Let's assume that Kalinda can add x pieces per minute and her mom can add y pieces per minute, where x > y (Kalinda is faster than her mom). We know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so x = 4. Since her mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, we have y = 2x = 2(4) = 8.
Now, let's find out how long it would take them to complete the puzzle together. The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360, so they need to add/place all 360 pieces. Kalinda can do it in x = 4 minutes, and her mom can do it in y = 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time it would take them to complete the puzzle together is:
x + y = 4 + 8 = 12 minutes.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they can complete the puzzle in:
12 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18 minutes/hour."
"Response: 

Let X represent the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after two weeks. We know that 30% of the initial 120 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months, which is equal to 36 (120 x 0.3). Therefore, the number of watermelons left at the end of two months is 120 - 36 = 84.  

Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after another two weeks, we can calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest as follows:  

(84 x 0.75) = 63

So, there were 63 watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks. To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we subtract the number of ready watermelons from the total number of watermelons left at the beginning of the period:  

X = 84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks."
"Response:  To find out how much Mark pays in total, we need to calculate the cost of the cars first.  
Cost of one car = $20,000 x 12 = $240,000
Tax on the cars = $240,000 x 10% = $24,000
Registration fee per car = $1000
Total registration fee = $1000 x 12 = $12,000
Total amount paid by Mark = Cost of cars + Tax on cars + Registration fee = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000"
"Response: 
Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, so Robert collected 20 - 5 = 15 shells.

Response: 37.5 (50 x 1/2 = 50 / 2 = 37.5)
"Response: 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.  
Explanation: If there were initially 36 penguins, then one-third (or 12) would have gone for a swim in the ocean. That leaves 24 penguins who did not go for a swim. Of those 24, another one-third (or 8) went inside the cave to eat their dinner. Therefore, 12 + 8 = 20 penguins are no longer sunbathing; only 6 penguins remain sunbathing."
"Response: 2 vines.  
Explanation: 
If Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, then he consumes 42 tomatoes per week (6 x 7 = 42). Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, Steve needs two vines to meet his demand of 42 tomatoes per week."
"Response: 3 pizzas.  
Explanation:  If there are 20 friends sharing equally among them, then each friend will get 20/20 = 1 slice per friend. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we divide 20 by 8 to determine how many pizzas are needed: 20 / 8 = 3. Therefore, John needs to order 3 pizzas."

Question: A bat and a ball together cost $1.10.  The bat costs $1 more than the ball.  How much does the ball cost?  
Based on the information provided, formulate a numeric answer. 
Answer:"
"Response: 

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, if Joan is x years old, Mary is x - 2 years old.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, if Jessa is y years old, Joan is y + 5 years old.
3. We know that Jessa is 20 years old.

Now let's use this information to find the age of each girl:

Joan = y + 5 (since she is 5 years older than Jessa)
Mary = y - 2 (since she is 2 years younger than Joan)
Jessa = 20

We can substitute these expressions into an equation to find the sum of their ages:

y + (y + 5) + (y - 2) =?

Combine like terms:

3y + 3 =?

Solve for the unknown variable ""?"" (which represents the sum of their ages):

3y + 3 = 3(20) + 3
= 60 + 3
= 63

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 63 years old."
"Response: 
Let X be the number of students who went out through exit C.
Since all the three exits are equally used, we can say that 1000 - (30/100) x 1000 = 1000 - 300 = 700 students went out through exit A.
Now, let Y be the number of students who went out through exit B.
We know that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, so we can write:
Y = (700 - 300) / 5 = 400 / 5 = 80 students went out through exit B.
Therefore, X + Y = 80 + 400 = 480 students went out through exit C."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about the situation:

1. James has 6 more candies than Robert. So if Robert has x candies, James has x + 6 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert. So if Robert has x candies, John has 2x candies.
3. John has a total of 54 candies.
Now let's set up an equation based on these facts:

Equation 1: James has 6 more candies than Robert
x + 6 = Robert's number of candies

Equation 2: John has twice as many candies as Robert
2(x) = John's number of candies

Equation 3: John has a total of 54 candies
2x = 54

Now solve Equations 1 and 2 for x (the number of candies that Robert has):

Solving Equation 1 for x:
x + 6 = 54... subtracting 6 from both sides gives us...
x = 48

Solving Equation 2 for x:
2x = 54... dividing both sides by 2 gives us...
x = 27

So Robert has 48 candies and James has 48 + 6 = 54 candies.
To find out how many more candies John has than James, we can subtract James' number of candies from John's number of candies:

John has 54 candies - James' 54 candies =?
54 - 54 = 0

Therefore, John has no more candies than James."
Response: 3 books. Each of them (Dolly and Pandora) will read one book that belongs to the other person, in addition to reading their own book. Therefore, at the end, there will be three books that have been read collectively.
"Response: 
Mike writes to 3 pen pals (he stopped being pen pals with 2).  
Each letter is 5 pages long and takes him 6 minutes to write. 
He writes 2 letters per week for each pen pal. 
Total number of letters written per week = 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 letters/week
Time taken to write one letter = 6 minutes
Total time spent writing per week = 30 letters x 6 minutes/letter = 180 minutes/week
Therefore, Mike spends 180 minutes or 3 hours writing per week."
"Response: 

Jason has 700 minutes left in his phone plan for the month (1000 - 300 = 700)."
"Response: 8

Explanation:
Let's break down what we know about the situation:

1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 of Griffin's fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries.
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which we can assume is some fixed number (we don't know exactly how many). Let's call this number ""x"".
5. Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 3 less than 10 = 7 fries.
6. In the end, Griffin has 19 + x + 7 = 27 fries.

Now we can solve for x by substituting the values we know into the equation above:

19 + x + 7 = 27

Simplifying:

x + 7 = 27 - 19

x + 7 = 8

Solving for x:

x = 8 - 7

x = 1

So Ginger gave Griffin 1 handful of fries."
"Response:  Let's say that the number of fish in Aquarium A is x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish, we can write an equation based on this information:  

Let Snail A be the number of snails in Aquarium A, and let Snail B be the number of snails in Aquarium B. We know that Snail B = 32 - Snail A (since there are 32 snails in Aquarium B and Snail A is the difference between the two). 

We also know that the number of fish in Aquarium A is equal to the number of snails in Aquarium B plus twice the number of fish in Aquarium A: 

Fish A + Fish B = Snail B + 2(x) 

Now we need to solve for x using these equations. Substituting the second equation into the first one gives us: 

Snail B + 2(x) = 32 - Snail A 

Subtracting Snail A from both sides gives us: 

2(x) = 32 - Snail A - Snail B 

Simplifying by combining like terms gives us: 

2(x) = 30 

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: 

x = 15 

Therefore, there are 15 fish in each aquarium."
"Response: 
To calculate how much Jean paid, we need to first determine the total cost without the discount. Then, we can subtract the discount to get the final amount paid.

Total Cost Without Discount = Number of Hours x Rate per Hour x Number of Days per Week x Weeks Worked

Total Cost Without Discount = 6 hours/day x $250/hour x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = $80,000

Discount = 10% of Total Cost Without Discount

Discount = $80,000 x 10% = $8,000

Final Amount Paid = Total Cost Without Discount - Discount

Final Amount Paid = $80,000 - $8,000 = $72,000"
"Response: 

Step-by-step solution: 

To find out how much each parent paid, we need to divide the total amount by three. We can do this using division. 

Total Amount = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So each parent paid $32."
"Response: 
The chef spent $60 to buy 4 bags of onions because:
$1.50 x 4 bags = $60"
"Response: 

Let x be the number of cookies that Sue's sister ate on Monday. Since Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4x cookies on Monday.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2(x+5) = 2x + 10 cookies.
The total number of calories consumed by Sue over both days is given by adding up the number of calories in all the cookies she ate:
Calories consumed by Sue = (4x + 2x + 10) \* 200 = 6x + 200
Since Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day, her total consumption over both days is:
Calories consumed by sister = (5) \* 200 + (13) \* 200 = 1000 + 2600 = 3600
Therefore, the difference in the number of calories consumed by Sue and her sister over both days is:
Diff = Calories consumed by Sue - Calories consumed by sister = 6x + 200 - 3600 = 6x - 3400
To find the value of x, we can set Diff equal to zero and solve for x:
6x - 3400 = 0
6x = 3400
x = 570
So, Sue's sister ate 570 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies the next day, while Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, or 2280 cookies over both days. The difference in the number of calories consumed by Sue and her sister over both days is:
Diff = Calories consumed by Sue - Calories consumed by sister = 2280 - 3600 = -1320
Sue consumed 1320 fewer calories than her sister over both days."
