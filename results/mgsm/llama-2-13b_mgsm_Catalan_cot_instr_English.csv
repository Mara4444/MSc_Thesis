"Response:  First, we know that Janet has 16 ducks and each lays three eggs per day for breakfast, so she has 3 x 16 = 48 eggs per day from her own ducks.  Next, she bakes muffins every morning using four eggs, so she needs to buy four more eggs from the market.  Now, let's calculate how much money she earns selling the extra eggs at the farmer's market.  If she sells each egg for $2, then she earns:  
48 (from her own ducks) + 4 (bought from the market) = 52 eggs per day x $2/egg = $104 per day  So, Janet earns $104 per day selling eggs at the farmer's market."
Response:  We know that we need 2 bolts of blue fiber and half of white fiber to make one tunic.  So, if we want to calculate how many spools of yarn we need in total, we can start with the blue fiber first.  Since each bolt of blue fiber contains 50 meters of yarn, we need 2 x 50 = 100 meters of blue fiber.  Now, let's move on to the white fiber.  Half of the white fiber is equal to 50% of 100 meters, which is 50 meters.  Therefore, we need 100 + 50 = 150 meters of yarn in total.  To convert this amount into spools, we need to divide the total length of yarn by the length of each spool (which is assumed to be 50 meters).  This gives us: 150 / 50 = 3 spools.  So, we need three spools of yarn in total to make one tunic.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the house after repairs: Total Cost = Purchase Price + Repair Costs Total Cost = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 Next, we can calculate the increase in value of the house: Increase in Value = New Value - Old Value Increase in Value = 130,000 - 80,000 = 50,000 Finally, we can calculate the profit as follows: Profit = Increase in Value x (100 / Original Price) Profit = 50,000 x (100 / 80,000) = 62,500 So, Josh made a profit of $62,500 or 75% return on his investment.
Response:  If James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each day, that means he runs a total of 180 meters (3 x 60) per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, James runs a total of 1260 meters (180 x 7) per week.
Response:  First, we know that each chicken eats three times a day and Wendi has 20 chickens in her flock. So she needs to feed them 3 x 20 = 60 meals per day.  Now, we are told that in the morning, she gives 15 tasses of food to her chickens, so she still needs to give them 60 - 15 = 45 more tasses of food for the other two meals.  Since she gives 25 tasses of food at noon, she will need to give 45 / 25 = 18/9 (or approximately 2) more tasses of food in the afternoon.  Therefore, Wendi needs to give 2 x 2 = 4 more tasses of food in the evening.
Response:  If each additional glass costs only 60% of the previous one, then the second glass will cost $5 x 0.6 = $3. The third glass will cost $3 x 0.6 = $1.80, and so on. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, she will pay: $1.80 x 16 = $28.80.
"Response:  First, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So if Charleston has x sheep, then Toulouse has 2x sheep.  Next, we know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So if Seattle has y sheep, then Charleston has 4y sheep.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  
2x + 4y =?  We are also given that Seattle has 20 sheep, so we can substitute this into the equation:  
2x + 4y = 20  Solving for x and y, we get:  x = 80  y = 5  Therefore, together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have:  
Toulouse: 2x = 160 sheep  Charleston: 4y = 20 sheep  Seattle: 20 sheep  In total, they have:  
160 + 20 + 5 = 185 sheep"
"Response:  First, we know that the file size is 200 GB and it takes 2 minutes to download 2 GB of data (1 minute for each GB). So, if we divide 200 GB by 2 GB per minute, we get:  
200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes  
Now, we know that after downloading 80% of the file (i.e., 160 GB), Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the remaining amount of data to be downloaded after the restart is:  
160 GB - 20 MB (downloaded during the restart) = 140 GB  
So, in total, we need to download:  
100 minutes x 2 GB/minute + 140 GB = 200 minutes x 2 GB/minute + 140 GB = 400 GB  
Therefore, the total amount of data needed to download the 200 GB file is 400 GB."
Response:  First, we know that John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 100 km/h, so he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 100 km/h x 3 h Distance = 300 km Now, he spends the next half hour driving at 30 mph, which is equivalent to 48 km/h. So, he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 48 km/h x 0.5 h Distance = 24 km Now, he drives the remaining time of 4 hours at a speed of 80 mph, which is equivalent to 128 km/h. So, he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 128 km/h x 4 h Distance = 496 km In total, John travels a distance of: Total distance = Distance from first 3 hours + Distance from next half hour + Distance from last 4 hours Total distance = 300 km + 24 km + 496 km Total distance = 820 km Therefore, John is 820 kilometers away from home after driving for 4 hours.
"Response:  First, we know that Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour, so she earns:  
40 hours x $10/hour = $400  Next, we know that she also works 5 extra hours (45 - 40 = 5), and for those extra hours, she is paid 1.2 times her regular rate, which is:  
5 hours x $10 x 1.2 = $60 So, in total, Eliza earns: $400 + $60 = $460 this week."
Response:  First month: 60 downloads Second month: 3 times more than first month = 180 downloads Third month: 30% less than second month = 126 downloads Total number of downloads in three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much each type of pastry costs per unit (rosquets, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes). Then we can multiply that number by the quantity purchased for each type of pastry. Finally, add up all these amounts to find out the total cost.  
For rosquets, the cost is $68/dotzena. So the cost per unit is $68/12 = $5.67 per rosquet.  
For mini cupcakes, the cost is $80/dotzena. So the cost per unit is $80/12 = $6.67 per mini cupcake.  
For mini cheesecakes, the cost is $55/dotzena. So the cost per unit is $55/12 = $4.58 per mini cheesecake.  
Now let's calculate the total cost for each type of pastry:  
Rosquets: 3 x $5.67 = $17.01  
Mini cupcakes: 2 x $6.67 = $13.34  
Mini cheesecakes: 6 x $4.58 = $27.48  
Total cost: $17.01 + $13.34 + $27.48 = $67.83"
Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend each year on watering and fertilizing the tree. We know that this amount is $3 per year. Now let's calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree. To do this, we need to divide the initial investment (planting the tree) by the annual income he will receive from selling lemons. So, if Carlos invests $90 in planting the tree and receives $7 in annual profits, we can calculate as follows: Profit = $7 Yearly Income - $3 Annual Expenses = $7 - $3 = $4 Per Year Therefore, it will take Carlos 22 years ($90 / $4) to start making a profit from his lemon tree.
Response:  First, we know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, so she had 3 times as many before selling.  That means she started with 3 x 5 = 15 vacuum cleaners.  Next, she sold two more to the red house, leaving her with half of what she had left (since she sold a third). So she has half of 15, which is 7.5.  Finally, she sold half of what was left to the orange house, giving her 5 vacuum cleaners in total.  Therefore, Melanie started with 15 vacuum cleaners.
Response:  We know that 20% of the students are in contemporary dance and 25% of the remaining students (i.e., those who did not choose contemporary dance) are in jazz dance. So we can start by finding out how many students are in jazz dance.  There are 20 students x 25% = 5 students in jazz dance. Now, let's find out how many students are left for hip hop dance. The total number of students is 20 - 5 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 students x 75% = 11 students in hip hop dance. So, the percentage of students who have signed up for hip hop dance is 11/20 x 100% = 55%.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the profit for each option. Profit = Selling Price - Purchase Price. For jewelry: Profit = $5,000 (Selling Price) - $4,000 (Purchase Price) = $1,000. For electronics: Profit = $8,000 (Selling Price) - $6,400 (Purchase Price) = $1,600. Now, let's consider the market growth rate. For jewelry: Market Growth Rate = 2.5%. So, the selling price after one month will be: $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125. For electronics: Market Growth Rate = 1.2%. So, the selling price after one month will be: $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096. Now, we can compare the profits of both options: Jewelry Option: Profit = $1,000 + ($5,125 - $5,000) = $1,000 + $125 = $1,125 Electronics Option: Profit = $1,600 + ($8,096 - $8,000) = $1,600 + $96 = $1,696 Based on this analysis, it is more profitable to choose the jewelry option. The profit from the jewelry option is higher than the profit from the electronics option by $125.
Response:  On the first day, both trains travel for 130 km westward. So, the distance covered by each train is: Train A: 130 km Train B: 130 km On the second day, both trains turn north and cover a total distance of 240 km. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to find out how much distance each train covers. Let's assume that Train A covers x kilometers and Train B covers y kilometers. We know that the sum of their distances must be equal to the total distance traveled (240 km): x + y = 240 km Now we can solve this equation. We have two variables (x and y) and one equation. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 160 km y = 80 km Therefore, the distance covered by Train A on the first day is 130 km, and on the second day, it covers 160 km, while Train B covers 80 km on the first day and 160 km on the second day.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much she earns as a teacher and then add that amount to what she earns as a cheerleading coach.  As a teacher, she earns $20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week or $35,600/year (based on 50 weeks of work).  As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week or $23,400/year.  Therefore, her total annual salary is $35,600 + $23,400 = $59,000/year.
"Response:  If La Claire eats three eggs for breakfast every day, that means she consumes 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week. Since there are 4 weeks in 4 setmanes (the plural of ""setmana"" is ""setmanes""), La Claire will eat 21 x 4 = 84 eggs in 4 setmanes."
"Response:  First, we know that Marissa walked at a rate of 4 miles per hour for the first 4 miles, so it took her 4 hours to walk those miles. Then she walked at a rate of 3 miles per hour for the next 2 miles, so it took her 2 hours to walk those miles. In total, it took her 6 hours to walk 6 miles. Now we need to find out how fast she needs to go to walk the remaining distance of 6 miles in x hours. We can set up an equation based on this information:  
Let d be the distance left to cover, which is 6 miles. 
Let t be the time taken to cover that distance. 
We know that Marissa walked at a rate of 4 miles per hour for the first 4 miles, so the time taken to cover those miles is: 
t = d / r, where r is the rate at which she walked, which is 4 miles/hour. 
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: 
t = 6 / 4 = 1.5 hours 
Now we know that Marissa spent 1.5 hours walking the first 4 miles, and she spent another 2 hours walking the next 2 miles, so the total time taken to cover the entire distance of 6 miles is: 
Total Time = 1.5 + 2 = 3.5 hours 
Since Marissa has to cover 6 miles in x hours, we can set up the following equation: 
x = Total Time / Distance Per Hour 
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: 
x = 3.5 / 4 = 0.875 hours or approximately 52 minutes 
Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a rate of approximately 4.8 miles per hour (or 4 miles per hour plus 0.875 hours) to complete the remaining distance of 6 miles in x hours."
Response:  We have 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three fifths water and we add 10 liters of orange juice that is two thirds water. First, let's calculate how much water there is in the 15 liters of pineapple juice: 3/5 x 15 = 9 liters of water Next, let's calculate how much water there is in the 10 liters of orange juice: 2/3 x 10 = 6.67 liters of water Now, let's add the amount of water from both juices: 9 + 6.67 = 15.67 liters of water So, there are approximately 15.67 liters of water in the 24 liters of combined juice.
Response:  First, we know that Raymond is six years older than Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.  Now, we are told that Raymond had a child when he was 23 years old. So, if Raymond is now 37 years old, and he had his child 23 years ago, then his child must have been born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.  Therefore, the son of Raymond is 14 years old.
Response:  First three customers buy one DVD each, so we sell 3 DVDs. Next two customers buy two DVDs each, so we sell 2 x 2 = 4 more DVDs. Total sales for first five customers are: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs. Last three customers do not purchase any DVDs, so we don't sell anything to them. Therefore, total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.
Response:  First, we know that the vela burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So if it starts burning at 1:00 PM and burns for 5 hours (until 5:00 PM), then it will have burned a total of:  2 cm/hour x 5 hours = 10 cm  Therefore, after 5 hours, the candle will be 10 cm shorter than it was when it started.
Response:  First, we know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book.  Second, we know that there was a 25% discount on the original price of the book. So, if we subtract the amount Kyle paid from the discounted price, we can find out what the original price of the book must have been. Here's how to do it: Discount = 25% of original price Original price = $19.50 x (1 + 0.25) = $19.50 x 1.25 = $24.38 So, the original price of the book was $24.38.
Response:  First, we know that Marie paid $50 for her order.  We also know that she bought five packs of milk at $3 each, which costs $15 in total.  She also bought four apples at $1.50 each, which costs $6 in total.  That brings us to a total of $21 so far.  Now, let's calculate how much the pizzas must have costed.  Since Marie paid $50 and spent $21 on other items, the remaining amount is $50 - $21 = $29.  If each pizza costs $8.50, then Marie must have purchased $\frac{29}{8.5} = 3$ boxes of pizza.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much each item costs and then add up all of the costs.  Here are the calculations:  
Pantalons curts: $16.50 x 3 = $49.50  Pantalons: $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 Sabates: $42 x 3 = $126 Total cost: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.00  So, Mishka spent $243.00 on all three items."
Response:  If Cynthia eats one portion of gelato every night and there are 30 days in April, then she will eat 30 portions of gelato that month. Since each carton contains 15 portions, she will need 2 cartons (30/15 = 2) to last her through the month. Therefore, her total cost for gelato in April will be 2 x $4.00 = $8.00.
"Response:  We know that Henry traveled for 20 miles before his first stop and then traveled an additional 15 miles before his second stop. So we can start by adding these two distances together to find out how far he traveled between the two stops:  
20 + 15 = 35 miles  Therefore, Henry traveled 35 miles between his first and second stops."
"Response:  First, we know that the two pairs of shoes together cost $5 less than the boots. So if the boots cost x dollars, then the two pairs of shoes together cost x - 5 dollars.  Now, we know that one pair of shoes costs 33 dollars and the other pair costs twice as much. So let's call the price of the second pair of shoes 2x dollars.  Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of shoes is:  
33 + (2x) = x - 5  We can solve for x by subtracting 33 from both sides:  
x - 5 = 33 + (2x)  
x - 5 = 33 + 2x  
x = 28  So, the boots cost $28."
Response:  First, we know that Darrel is 7 times as old as Allen, so if Darrel is x years old, then Allen is 7x - 11 years old.  Now, we are given that the sum of their ages is 162 years, so we can set up an equation:  x + (7x - 11) = 162.  Simplifying this equation, we get:  8x - 11 = 162.  Solving for x, we get:  x = 20.  Therefore, Darrel is 20 years old and Allen is 7(20) - 11 = 149 years old.
Response:  First, we know that the first person said there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. Second, the second person said there are 20 more than half of the first number, which is 80/2 = 40. Third, the third person said there are 25% more than the first number, which is 80 x 1.25 = 100. Now, let's find the average of these three numbers: (80 + 40 + 100) / 3 = 220 / 3 = 73.33. So, the estimated number of jelly beans in the jar is approximately 73.
Response:  First, we know that there are 7 days in a week. Next, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours per day to walk and care for its needs. Therefore, if John has 10 dogs, he will spend 0.5 x 10 = 5 hours per day caring for his dogs. Since there are 7 days in a week, John will spend 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let X be the number of silver coins, then the number of gold coins is 30 + X.  Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  X + (30 + X) = 110... 2X + 30 = 110... Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:  2X = 80... Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  X = 40... So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  Therefore, she has 30 + 40 = 70 gold coins.
Response:  First, we know that Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels, so let's find out how many jewels Raymond has first.  Half of 40 is 20, so Raymond has 20 jewels.  Now we can find out how many jewels Aaron has.  Aaron has 5 more than 20, which is 25 jewels.  Finally, we can find out how many jewels Siobhan has.  We know that Siobhan has two fewer than Aaron, so if Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.
"Response:  First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. So, if we want to find out how many points he scored in total, we need to add the number of points he scored in each period:  
First 20 minutes: 4 points Second 20 minutes: (25% more than 4) = (1.25 x 4) = 5 points Total points scored by Mike = 4 + 5 = 9 points"
Response:  First we need to find out how much Terry spends on yogurt in one day: 2 x $5.00 = $10.00 So, Terry spends $10.00 on yogurt each day. Now let's calculate how much he spends on yogurt for 30 days: $10.00 x 30 = $300.00 Therefore, Terry spends $300.00 on yogurt during 30 days.
"Response:  First, we know that John has 13 Lego games and sells each one for $15. So he makes $15 x 13 = $195 from selling his Lego games. Then, he spends $20 x 8 = $160 to buy 8 video games. Therefore, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left over after buying the video games. Since he has $35 left over, he must still have some Lego games left. In fact, if we divide $35 by $15 (the price of each Lego game), we get:  
$35 / $15 = 2  
So, John still has 2 Lego games left!"
Response:  First, we know that John runs for 3 hours on the first day and half of that time (i.e., 1.5 hours) on the other two days. So, in total, he spends 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours running per week. Next, we need to calculate how far he covers during those 6 hours. We can do this using the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate at which he travels (in kilometers per hour), and t is the time spent running (in hours). Since we don't know John's exact speed, let's assume an average pace of 5 kilometers per hour (which is a reasonable estimate for a recreational runner like John). Now we can plug in the values: d = 5r x t, where t = 6 hours. Solving for d, we get: d = 5r x 6 = 30 kilometers. Therefore, John covers approximately 30 kilometers each week while running.
Response:  First, we know that Dana can run at four times the speed of her walking speed, so if she walks at x miles per hour, she runs at 4x miles per hour.  We also know that she can jump at half the speed of her running speed, so if she runs at 4x miles per hour, she jumps at 2x miles per hour.  Now, we are given that Dana can jump 3 miles per hour for six hours, which means she will cover a total distance of 3 \* 6 = 18 miles while jumping.  Since she spends two-thirds of the time running and one-third of the time walking, let's first calculate how far she goes during each activity.  If she runs for two-thirds of the time (i.e., 2/3 \* 6 = 4 hours), she covers a distance of 4 \* 4x = 16 miles while running.  And if she walks for one-third of the time (i.e., 1/3 \* 6 = 2 hours), she covers a distance of 2 \* x = 2x miles while walking.  Therefore, the total distance Dana travels in six hours is 18 + 16 + 2x = 36 + 2x miles.  To find out what value of x gives us the correct answer, we set up an equation based on the information provided:  x + 2x + 3x = 36 + 2x 5x = 72  x = 14  So, Dana can walk at a speed of 14 miles per hour.
Response:  First, we know that the iPhone of Brandon is four times older than the iPhone of Ben. So if the iPhone of Ben is x years old, then the iPhone of Brandon is 4x years old.  Next, we know that the iPhone of Ben is twice as old as the iPhone of Suzy. So if the iPhone of Suzy is y years old, then the iPhone of Ben is 2y years old.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  4x = 2(y + 1)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  4x = 2y + 2  Solving for x, we get:  x = y + 1  Therefore, the iPhone of Ben is one year older than the iPhone of Suzy.  And since the iPhone of Brandon is four times older than the iPhone of Ben, the iPhone of Brandon is four years older than the iPhone of Suzy.  So the iPhone of Brandon is (y + 4) years old.
Response:  First, we know that without the precious stone of zafir, Polly can throw the golden lance to a distance of 400 feet (120 meters).  Second, with the precious stone of zafir, Polly can throw the golden lance three times farther than without it. Third, we are told that the dragon is sitting at the top of Mount Farbo and breathing fire up to 300 meters away. So if Polly throws the golden lance from a distance of 400 feet (with or without the precious stone), will she be able to hit the dragon? No, because the dragon's fire range is longer than Polly's throwing distance. Therefore, even with the precious stone, Polly cannot reach the dragon with her thrown spear. The correct answer is:  With the precious stone of zafir, Polly could throw the golden lance 3 x 400 = 1200 feet (365 meters) away from herself. However, this would still not be enough to reach the dragon, which can breathe fire up to 300 meters away.
Response:  First, we know that each tart was cut into 8 pieces, so there were originally 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pastries.  Next, we know that after everyone had taken and eaten their own share, there were 14 leftover pieces. So, if we subtract the number of leftovers (14) from the original total (40), we can find out how many pieces each guest took:  40 - 14 = 26  Therefore, each guest took approximately 26/8 = 3 pieces of pastries.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one serving of potatoes (300g) contains 250 calories. Secondly, if there are five servings in a bag, then each serving is 250/5 = 50 calories. Thirdly, if you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily objective is 2000 calories, then you can consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories more. Finally, since each serving is 50 calories, you can eat 200 / 50 = 4 servings or 4 x 50 = 200 calories.
Response:  First, we know that Charlie can make 10 candles with one pound of wax. So if he sells each candle for $2.00, his revenue from selling 20 candles would be:   Revenue = Number of Candles x Price per Candle  = 20 x $2.00  = $40.00 Now, we know that Charlie also has to pay $10 for one pound of wax and $5 for the wicks, so his total cost is:  Total Cost = Number of Pounds of Wax x Cost per Pound + Number of Wicks x Cost per Wick  = 20 x $10.00 + (20 x $5.00)  = $200.00 Subtracting his total cost from his revenue gives us his profit:  Profit = Revenue - Total Cost  = $40.00 - $200.00  = $-160.00 Charlie would actually lose money if he sold 20 candles at $2.00 each.
Response:  First, we know that she wrote 5 articles on Monday and each article took her 4 hours to research and write. So, she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Monday, so she wrote 2 x 5 = 10 articles. Since each article took her 4 hours to write, she spent 10 x 4 = 40 hours writing on Tuesday. And on Wednesday, she wrote double the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 x 10 = 20 articles. Again, since each article took her 4 hours to write, she spent 20 x 4 = 80 hours writing on Wednesday. Therefore, in total, Meredith spent 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 hours writing articles during those three days.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Candice had 80 notes in her bag before she went to work. Secondly, we know that she used 23 of those notes to label each of the 220 cups of coffee differently. So, if we subtract the number of notes she used from the total number of notes she had, we can find out how many notes were left over. Here's the calculation:  
80 - 23 =?  
Answer: 67"
"Response:  First, we know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. So if he bought x blue ties, he bought 2x red ties.  We also know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So the cost of one red tie is 1.5 times the cost of one blue tie.  In other words, the cost of one red tie = 1.5(40) = 60 dollars.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Let x be the number of blue ties John bought. Then the number of red ties he bought is 2x.  The total cost of all the ties John bought is:  
Total Cost = (2x)(40) + (x)(60)  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  
Total Cost = 80x + 240  Since we know that John spent $200 on ties, we can substitute this value into the previous equation to solve for x:  
80x + 240 = 200  Solving for x, we get:  
x = 3  Therefore, John bought 3 blue ties and 6 red ties (since each red tie costs 50% more than each blue tie)."
Response:  We know that we have a total of 4 feet (48 inches) of string and we want to cut it into pieces of 15 centimeters each. So first, let's convert 15 centimeters to inches: 15 cm x 0.3937 in/cm = 6.25 inches Now we can divide our total length of string by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces we can make: 48 in / 6.25 in = 7.64 pieces So there are approximately 7.64 pieces of string available for supporting tomato plants.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is:  
15 x 8 = 120  Next, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that only 3/4 of the units are occupied. To find out how many units are not occupied (i.e., vacant), we can multiply the total number of units by the fraction of units that are not occupied:  
120 x 3/4 = 90  Therefore, there are 90 vacant units in the building."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many eggs Lloyd sells in a week. We know that he has 252 eggs per day and there are 7 days in a week, so:  
252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week  
Now, we know that each dozen eggs costs $2, so:  
1,764 eggs/week x $2/dozen = $3,528/week  
Therefore, Lloyd earns $3,528 per week from his egg farm."
Response:  First we need to calculate how long it takes for Tom's boat to travel at 10 miles per hour from 1 pm to 4 pm. We know that there are 3 hours in this time period, so we can multiply 10 miles per hour by 3 hours to get: Total distance traveled = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles Now we need to calculate how far Tom needs to travel back at 6 miles per hour. Since he traveled 30 miles during the day, he will need to travel 30 / 6 = 5 hours to return home. So, Tom needs 5 hours to return home.
"Response:  First, we know that the weight of Uriah's books is too heavy for him to carry, so he needs to remove some items to lighten his load.  We are given two pieces of information about the weights of his belongings:  His comic books weigh one quintal (100 pounds or 45 kilograms), and his toys weigh another quintal.  To calculate how many toys he needs to remove to reduce the total weight by five kilograms, let's use algebra.  If we subtract 30 comic books from the total weight, we can represent this as follows:  Total weight - 30 comic books = 5 kg less than original weight.  Since each comic book weighs 1 kilogram, removing 30 of them will reduce the total weight by 30 kilograms.  So, if we set up an equation based on this information, we get:  
Total weight - 30 comic books = 5 kg less than original weight  Original weight - 30 comic books =??? kilograms  Now we need to find out what the original weight was before removing any items.  According to the problem statement, ""The boss of the books is too heavy for him to carry,"" which implies that the original weight was more than five kilograms greater than the current weight.  Therefore, we can write:  Original weight = Current weight + 5 kg  Using this information, we can substitute into our previous equation:  Original weight = Current weight + 5 kg  Total weight - 30 comic books = 5 kg less than original weight  Substituting original weight:  Total weight - 30 comic books = (Current weight + 5 kg) - 30 comic books  Simplifying:  Total weight - 30 comic books = Current weight + 5 kg - 30 comic books  Evaluating:  Total weight - 30 comic books = Current weight + 5 kg - (100 pounds x 1 kilogram/100 pounds)  Simplifying further:  Total weight - 30 comic books = Current weight + 5 kg - 100 pounds  Solving for the number of toys he must remove: "
"Response:  First, let's calculate how much money the mechanic made on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, he repaired 6 pneumatic tires for trucks and 4 pneumatic tires for cars, so his total income was:  
6 x $ 60 = $ 360 + 4 x $ 40 = $ 160 = $ 520.  Now, let's calculate how much money the mechanic made on Friday.  On Friday, he repaired 12 car tires, but did not repair any truck tires, so his total income was:  
12 x $ 40 = $ 480.  Therefore, the day with higher earnings for the mechanic is Friday, with an income of $ 480."
Response:  First, we know that each of the two gats has had kittens.  So, if Patchy has had three times as many kittens as Trixie, and Trixie has had 12 kittens, then Patchy must have had 3 x 12 = 36 kittens.  In total, the family Doubtfire now has 36 + 12 = 48 cats!
Response:  First, we know that Jean has 30 caramels and eats 2 of them. So, he has 30 - 2 = 28 caramels left. Now, Jean wants to pack two caramels in each bag. Therefore, the number of bags he can make is 28 / 2 = 14 bags.
Response:  First, we know that the cost of a movie ticket is $7 and the cost of popcorn is also $7. So, if Peter has $42 for the week, he can afford to go to the movies twice because 2 x $7 = $14 + $7 = $21 < $42.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total weight of the camion and its contents without any boxes: 
Weight of camion + weight of driver = 3755 kg (from the problem statement)  Now let's add the weight of each box: 
Weight of one box x number of boxes = 5 kg x Number of boxes  Since the maximum weight that the wooden bridge can support is 5000 kg, we know that the sum of all the weights must be less than or equal to this amount: 
Total weight = weight of camion + weight of driver + weight of boxes  We want to maximize the number of boxes while staying within the weight limit, so we set up an equation: 
Number of boxes = Total weight / Weight of one box  Substituting the values we have found, we get: 
Number of boxes = (5000 kg - 3755 kg) / 5 kg  Simplifying and solving for the number of boxes, we find that: 
Number of boxes = 24 boxes  Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the wooden bridge is 24."
Response:  First, we know that Stephen paid $40 for his groceries. Then, he was charged an additional 25% of that amount as delivery fees, which is $40 x 25% = $10. So, the total cost of his groceries with delivery fees added is $40 + $10 = $50. Next, Stephen added a tip of $4, so the final price he paid is $50 + $4 = $54.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of strawberries in each cluster. There are 6 clusters with 20 strawberries each, so the total number of strawberries in all clusters is:  
20 x 6 = 120 strawberries  Next, let's calculate the total number of strawberries scattered throughout the bush. We know there are 67 individual strawberries scattered throughout the bush. So, the total number of strawberries is the sum of the number of strawberries in each cluster and the number of individual strawberries:  
Total number of strawberries = 120 + 67 = 187 strawberries Therefore, there are 187 strawberries in total."
Response:  First, we know that there are 25 taronjes in total.  Of those, 2 are agride and 20% (or 5) are not mature.  So, the number of good ones is:  25 - 2 - 5 = 18.
Response:  First, she paid $500 for the material to make the bracelet. Then, she paid $800 to the jeweler to construct it. Finally, she paid a 10% insurance fee, which is $500 (10% of $5,000). So in total, she has paid $500 + $800 + $500 = $1,800.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Si has contributed to her pension fund over 40 years.  We know that she contributes 5% of her salary each year, so if we assume that her salary is $100,000 per year (a reasonable estimate given the average salary in the US), then she will have contributed $5,000 per year ($100,000 x 5%).  Over 40 years, this comes out to a total contribution of $200,000 ($5,000 x 40).  Next, we need to calculate the value of Si's pension after 30 years.  Since she has been contributing for 30 years and earns a 5% annual return, her pension fund will be worth $260,000 ($200,000 x 1.05^30).  Finally, we can calculate her annual pension payment as follows:  If Si retires after 30 years, she will receive 50% of the value of her pension fund, which is $130,000 ($260,000 x 0.5).  Divided by the number of years she worked (30), this gives us an annual pension payment of $4,333.33 ($130,000 / 30).  So, after working for 30 years and receiving a 5% annual return on her pension contributions, Si's annual pension payment would be $4,333.33.
"Response:  First, we know that the monthly subscription fee is $140.  If the company charged her for the first half of the year and then reduced the amount for the second half, we can assume that the total amount paid for the full year would be the sum of these two amounts.  So, let's calculate each amount separately:  
For the first half of the year (6 months):  
$140 x 6 = $840  
For the second half of the year (6 months):  
$140 x 6 = $840 (but with a 10% discount) = $752  
Total amount paid for the full year:  
$840 + $752 = $1,592"
"Response:  First, we know that Sophia has already driven 160 kilometers since her last fill-up and she needs to know how far she can go with one more fill-up of gasoline.  We are given that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gasoline.  To find out how many kilometers Sophia can drive, we need to divide the number of gallons in her tank by the number of kilometers she gets per gallon.  The problem states that she got 4 gallons for every 160 kilometers she drove, so we can set up the equation:  
12 gallons / (4 km/gallon) = x kilometers  Where x is the distance Sophia can travel with one fill-up.  Solving for x, we get:  
x = 12 gallons / (4 km/gallon) = 12 / 4 = 3 kilometers  Therefore, Sophia can travel 3 kilometers with one fill-up of gasoline."
Response:  First, we know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time he watches it (he does this 3 times per week). So, in total, he spends 6 hours per week watching TV. Now, let's consider his reading time. He reads for half of the time he spends watching TV, so he reads for 3 hours per week (since he spends 6 hours watching TV). In total, then, Jim spends 9 hours per week engaged in these two activities (watching TV and reading). Over the course of 4 weeks, this means he will have spent 36 hours watching TV and reading (9 hours x 4 weeks).
Response:  There are four schools participating in the tournament, and each school has sent two teams (one team of girls and one team of boys) with five players on each team. Therefore, the total number of students who have been sent by all four schools is:  4 schools x 2 teams/school x 5 players/team = 80 students.  Additionally, there are four entrenadors, one for each team, so the total number of people who have been sent by all four schools is:  80 students + 4 entrenadors = 84 people.
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies.  So, if we add them together, we get:  175 + 35 = 210  Now, we also know that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies.  So, if we multiply 35 (the number of rubies) by 2, we get:  35 x 2 = 70  Therefore, there are 210 diamonds, 70 rubies, and 70 emeralds in the treasure chest.
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls at school and each class has 5 students for every teacher. So we can start by finding out how many teachers there are.  To do this, we divide 60 (the number of girls) by 5 (the number of students in each class): 60 ÷ 5 = 12.  Therefore, there are 12 teachers at the school.
"Response:  First, we know that Bailey received $5 per week for 8 weeks, so she received a total of:  
5 x 8 = 40 dollars in addition to whatever she had at first.  So if Bailey has $100 after receiving the insurance payments, we can set up an equation:  
Let B be the amount Bailey started with. Then we know:  
B + 40 = 100  Solving for B, we get:  B = 60  Therefore, Bailey started with $60 and received $40 from the insurance payments, resulting in a total of $100."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many students Judy teaches in total each week.  There are 7 days in a week and she teaches 5 classes per day, so she teaches a total of 7 x 5 = 35 classes per week.  Next, we need to calculate how many students she teaches in total each weekend (Saturday and Sunday). She teaches 8 classes on Saturday and Sunday combined, and there are 2 days in the weekend, so she teaches a total of 2 x 8 = 16 classes over the weekend.  Now, let's add up all the students she teaches in a week: 35 + 16 = 51 students per week.  Finally, we can multiply the number of students she teaches by her price per student to find out how much money she makes in one week: 51 x $15 = $765 per week.
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions, then the second recipe will have 2 x 20 = 40 instructions.  Therefore, in total, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions to prepare both plates.
"Response:  First, we know that Tommy sells brownies for $3 each and pastries for $4 each.  So if he sells 43 brownies, he will make:  
43 x $3 = $130  And if he sells 23 pieces of pastry, he will make:  
23 x $4 = $92  In total, Tommy will make:  
$130 + $92 = $222  Therefore, Tommy will gain $222."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all five phones: Total Cost = $150 x 5 = $750 Next, we need to calculate the interest for each phone over three months at a rate of 2% per month: Interest Per Month = $750 x 2% = $15 per month Now, let's calculate the total amount that Sheila will pay each month for all five phones: Total Amount Due Each Month = (Total Cost + Interest) = ($750 + $15) = $765 So, Sheila will pay $765 each month for three months.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Artie will make from each type of flower.  Since he doesn't have change today, he has rounded all his prices to the nearest dollar.  So, the price of calandretes is $3 (2.74 x 10), the price of petunias is $2 (1.87 x 10), and the price of begonias is also $3 (2.12 x 10).  Now let's calculate how many pots of each type Artie will sell:  He will sell 12 pots of calandretes, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias.  Next, we add up the total amount of money Artie will make from each type of flower:  For calandretes, it's 12 x $3 = $36; for petunias, it's 9 x $2 = $18; and for begonias, it's 17 x $3 = $51.  Finally, we add up the total amount of money Artie will make today:  It's $36 + $18 + $51 = $105.  Therefore, Artie will make $105 today."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each level of sandcastle has half the area of the level below it. So if the top level has an area of 16 square meters, then the second level must have half that area, or 8 square meters. The third level will have half of 8, which is 4 square meters, and the bottom level (the first level) will have half of 4, which is 2 square meters. Therefore, the average area of one level is: (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5 square meters.
"Response:  First year = 365 days (not 180) since we are talking about the first year of the puppy's life.  The puppy needs to eat 2 bowls of food per day after the first 180 days, so for the remaining 185 days, it will need:  
2 bowls/day x 185 days = 370 bowls of food in total for the first year. Now, let's calculate how many bags of food Cecilia will use during the first year:  
370 bowls / 110 tasses/bag = 3.36 bags of food for the first year. So, Cecilia will use approximately 3 and a half bags of food during her puppy's first year."
"Response:  First, we know that Sarah makes four times as much clothing as David does. So if David makes x amount of clothing, then Sarah makes 4x amount of clothing.  Next, we know that Raymond makes half as much clothing as Sarah does. So if Sarah makes 4x amount of clothing, then Raymond makes 2x amount of clothing (since he makes half of what Sarah makes).  Now, we are given that Sarah makes 400 kilograms of clothing. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Sarah = 4(David) = 4x 
Raymond = 1/2(Sarah) = 2x 

We want to find out how much David and Raymond make in total. To do this, we add their amounts together:  

Total for David + Raymond = David + 2x 

Now we need to substitute the value we found for David into this equation. We know that David makes x amount of clothing, so we can write:  

Total for David + Raymond = x + 2x = 3x 

So the total amount of clothing made by David and Raymond is 3x.  But we also know that Sarah makes 400 kilograms of clothing, so we can compare this to the total amount made by David and Raymond:  

400 = 3x 

Solving for x, we get:  

x = 133.33 kg 

Therefore, David makes 133.33 kilograms of clothing, and Raymond makes twice as much, or 266.67 kilograms."
Response:  First, we know that 3 flowers cost $2.50, so one flower costs $2.50/3 = $0.83.  Second, we know that 2 flowers cost $1, so one flower costs $1/2 = $0.50.  Now, let's calculate how much it would cost to buy 18 flowers in each case:  Case 1 (buying 3 flowers at a time):  18 flowers x $0.83/flower = $14.64  Case 2 (buying 2 flowers at a time):  18 flowers x $0.50/flower = $9.00  Since $9.00 is less than $14.64, buying 2 flowers at a time is the better deal.  So, if you want to buy 18 flowers and get the best price, you should purchase them two at a time for $9.00.
"Response:  First, we know that the cost of the treatment without any discount is $100 (as mentioned in the problem). Next, we are given that there is a 30% discount for being a new customer. To find out how much the treatment will actually cost with the discount, we can multiply the original price by the discount percentage:  
$100 x 0.7 = $70 So, the cost of the treatment with the discount is $70."
Response:  First, we know that each boy received 1/6 of the total amount of water, which is 24 liters. So if one boy received 6 liters, then the other boys received 6 x 5 = 30 liters.  Now, we can find out how much water is left over by subtracting what each boy received from the total amount: 24 - (6 + 30) = 24 - 36 = 0 liters.  There are no liters left over!
Response:  First, we know that Charlie had 10 stickers to start with. Then she bought 21 more from the store, so now she has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers in total. Next, she gave 9 of those stickers to her sister, leaving her with 31 - 9 = 22 stickers left. Finally, she used 28 of those remaining stickers to decorate a birthday card, leaving her with 22 - 28 = 4 stickers leftover. So, Charlie has 4 stickers left after decorating the birthday card.
Response:  First, we know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than Grace. So if Grace weighs x pounds, then Alex weighs x - 2 pounds. Now, we are told that their combined weight is 125 pounds. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + (x - 2) = 125  Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 127  Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: x = 63  So Grace weighs 63 pounds and Alex weighs 63 - 2 = 61 pounds. Their combined weight is 63 + 61 = 124 pounds.
"Response:  First, we know that Dan has planted 3 roses. Each rose has 25 roses, so we can calculate how many roses there are in total: 

3 x 25 = 75 roses

Now, each rose has 8 spines, so we can calculate how many spines there are in total: 

75 x 8 = 600 spines

Therefore, there are 600 spines in total."
Response:  First, we know that they played 22 games. Second, we know that they won 8 more than they lost. So if we subtract the number of losses from 22, we can find out how many games they won.  If they lost x games, then they won 22 - x games. Now let's substitute x = 0 (since we don't know how many games they lost) and solve for the number of games they won:  22 - 0 = 22 games They won 22 games.
Response:  First, we know that Gene has been going on vacation for 11 years (from age 23 to 34). So, she has had 11 vacations in total.  Each vacation has a t-shirt, so she has collected 11 t-shirts in total.  Now, let's look at each t-shirt as a block of collar. Since each block is from a different year, there are 11 blocks in total.  Therefore, Gene has 11 blocks of collar in her collage.
Response:  First time: 4 times Second time: 3 times more than first time = 3 x 4 = 12 Third time: Half of second time = half of 12 = 6 So, in total, the alarm sounded 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.
"Response:  First, we know that Sylvie has been working for the company for five years already, so she started at $600/month = $7200/year (since there are 12 months in a year).  Now, if the company policy is to increase salaries by 10% each year for employees who have stayed with the company for five years, then Sylvie's salary after one year would be:  
$7200 x 1.10 = $7920/year After two years, her salary would be:  
$7920 x 1.10 = $8648/year And after three years, her salary would be:  
$8648 x 1.10 = $9497/year So, Sylvie's salary after three years of continued employment with the company would be $9497/year."
"Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than Harald. So if Marilyn sold x copies, Harald sold 1/10 of x copies.  We also know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000.  Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:  
Marilyn's sales + Harald's sales = Total sales (88,000)  
x + (1/10)x = 88,000  
2x + 1/10x = 88,000  
3x = 88,000  
x = 29,333  
So, Marilyn sold 29,333 copies and Harald sold 29,333 / 10 = 2,933 copies."
Response:  First, we know that one-fourth of the invited guests will not appear, so we need to calculate how many guests will actually attend. One-fourth of 16 is 4, so there will be 4 + 16 = 20 guests at the party. Next, we need to calculate how many gift bags are needed for each guest. Since there are 75 bags in total and 20 guests, we can divide 75 by 20 to get an average of 3.75 gift bags per guest (round up to 4). Finally, we can multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per bag to find out the total cost: 4 x $2 = $8 per guest, or $8 x 20 guests = $160. So, Christina will spend $160 on gift bags.
Response:  First, we know that each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, so together they will eat 20 x 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.  Since there are 5 children, and each child eats half as much as an adult, they will eat 5 x (1/2) = 25 pounds of potato salad.  In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad to feed everyone at the picnic.
Response:  First, we know that Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. So if Marcia has x pets, Jan has 3x pets.  Next, we know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. So if Cindy has y pets, Marcia has y + 2 pets.  Finally, we know that Cindy has four pets.  So let's set up an equation based on this information:  3x + (y + 2) = 4  Now solve for x and simplify your answer.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, if Amy is x years old, then Jackson is (x - 5) years old and Corey is (x - 2) years old. Now, we are given that James is 10 years old and he is one year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey is (x + 1) years old. We can set up the equation as follows:

Amy = x + 5
Jackson = x - 5
Corey = x - 2
James = x + 1

Now, we have four equations and four variables. Can you solve for x to find out how old Jackson is?"
"Response:  First, we know that Lee runs the 400 meters with hurdles in 38 seconds. Second, we are told that Gerald improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet. Third, we want to find out how fast Gerald can run the 400 meters with hurdles. To do this, we need to calculate the percentage increase in Gerald's speed and then apply it to Lee's time.  So, let's start by calculating the percentage increase in Gerald's speed:  
Percentage Increase = (New Speed - Old Speed) / Old Speed x 100  New Speed is the speed at which Gerald can now run the 400 meters with hurdles, and Old Speed is the speed he had before changing his diet. We are given that Gerald's new speed is 10% faster than his old speed. So, we can write:  New Speed = Old Speed x 1.10  Now we have two equations: one for Lee's time and one for Gerald's time. We can use these equations to solve for Gerald's time.  Substituting the values we know into the equation for Lee's time, we get:  Time = Distance / Speed  Distance = 400 meters  Speed = 38 seconds per 400 meters  Time = 400 / 38 = 10.526 seconds  Now substituting the value of New Speed into the equation for Gerald's time, we get:  Time = Distance / Speed  Distance = 400 meters  Speed = 1.10 x 38 = 41.8 seconds  Time = 400 / 41.8 = 9.637 seconds  Therefore, if Gerald ran the 400 meters with hurdles, he would finish in approximately 9.637 seconds."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer rabbits than the combined number of dogs and cats. So if we let X be the number of dogs and cats together, then the number of rabbits is 12 less than X, or X - 12.  Now we know that there are twice as many cats as dogs, so the number of cats is 2X, and the number of dogs is X.  Since there are 60 dogs, we can write an equation based on this information:  
X + 2X = 60 + (12)  Simplifying the equation:  
3X = 72  Solving for X:  
X = 24  Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:  
Dogs: X = 24  
Cats: 2X = 48  Rabbits: 12 less than X = 12 less than 24 = 12  Total number of pets: 24 + 48 + 12 = 84"
Response:  We know that 2/5 of the boys are in scouts and 2/3 of the girls are in scouts. So we can start by finding out how many boys and girls there are in total.  There are 50 students in the class, so:  Boys: 50 x 2/5 = 40 Girls: 50 x 2/3 = 67 Now we need to find out how many girls are not in the scouts. To do this, we subtract the number of girls who are in the scouts from the total number of girls: Girls not in scouts = 67 - 40 = 27 Therefore, there are 27 girls who are not in the scouts.
Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night and his friend James slept for only 2/3 of what Harry slept. So we can start by finding out how many hours James slept.  To find out how many hours James slept, we need to divide the number of hours Harry slept by 3. 9 hours / 3 = 3 hours  Therefore, James slept for 3 hours. Now we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. To do this, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept. 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours  So Harry slept 6 hours more than James.
Response:  First, we know that each can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. So if Freda used x cans of tomatoes to make 32 ounces of sauce, then she must have used 3x cans in total (since there are three tomatoes in each can).  Now, since each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked, we know that the total number of tomatoes Freda used is twice the number of cans she used: 2(3x) = 6x tomatoes.  Finally, we can set up an equation based on this information:  32 oz = 6x tomatoes  To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:   x = 10  Therefore, Freda used ten cans of tomatoes to make 32 ounces of sauce.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were originally 30 cars on the highway.  Secondly, 5 cars took an exit and did not go through the traffic jam.  Thirdly, some cars passed during the first 15 minutes of the blockade, but we don't know exactly how many.  Fourthly, another 20 cars passed during the remaining 15 minutes of the blockade.  So, to find out how many cars passed through the traffic jam, we need to subtract the number of cars that took the exit from the total number of cars on the highway.  In this case, if 5 cars took the exit, then there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left on the highway.  Now, let's divide these cars into two groups: those who passed during the first 15 minutes and those who passed during the remaining 15 minutes.  For the first group, we know that some cars passed, but we don't know exactly how many.  Let's assume x cars passed during the first 15 minutes.  Then, for the second group, we know that 20 cars passed during the remaining 15 minutes.  Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is x + 20.  To find out what x is, we can set up the following equation:  x + 20 = 25  Solving for x, we get:  x = 5  Therefore, 5 cars passed during the first 15 minutes of the blockade, and 20 cars passed during the remaining 15 minutes.  So, in total, 5 + 20 = 25 cars passed through the traffic jam.
Response:  Firstly, Maria already has two plants in each of her 40 windows, so she already has 2 x 40 = 80 plants in total.  Yesterday, she received 18 more plants in pots, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants in total.  Finally, she plans to give one plant in a pot from each batch to her friends and family tomorrow, so after giving away these plants, she will be left with 98 - (18 x 2) = 98 - 36 = 62 plants in total.  Therefore, Maria will have 62 plants remaining with her after giving some away to her loved ones.
Response:  First, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door.  Secondly, we know that the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, so if the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, then the second friend pressed it 5 times (since 20 x 1/4 = 5).  Thirdly, we know that the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so if the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, then the third friend pressed it 70 times (since 60 + 10 = 70).  Therefore, the total number of presses on the doorbell is:  20 + 5 + 70 = 95  So, the doorbell was pressed 95 times.
Response:  First, we know that Solo has 4 days left to complete her reading. Second, we know how many pages she read on Monday (15). Third, we know the total number of pages in each subject area: Science (40), Social Studies (20), History (7), and Geography (8). Finally, we want to find out how many pages Solo needs to read each day to finish all four subjects within the remaining time frame. To do this, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days left. Here's the calculation: Total Pages = 40 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 75 pages. Number of Days Left = 4. Now let's calculate the average number of pages Solo needs to read each day: Average Daily Pages = Total Pages / Number of Days Left Average Daily Pages = 75 / 4 = 18.75 pages per day. So, Solo needs to read approximately 18.75 pages per day for the next four days to complete all four subjects.
Response:  We know that John drinks water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and also before bedtime every day. So he drinks 3 times per day x 7 days = 21 glasses of water per week. However, on weekends, John likes to relax and has one more glass of water with dinner, so his total for the week is 21 + 1 = 22 glasses of water.
Response:  First we need to calculate how many minutes it takes to cover each mile of the city. We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, so for one mile it will take: 10 minutes / 3 miles = 3.33 minutes per mile. Now let's calculate how many minutes it will take to cover the entire city: Total time = (Number of miles x Time per mile) + (Distance from ocean to city center x Time per mile) Distance from ocean to city center = 42 miles Number of miles = 42 miles Total time = (42 miles x 3.33 minutes/mile) + (42 miles x 3.33 minutes/mile) Total time = 146.66 minutes + 146.66 minutes Total time = 293.32 minutes or approximately 4.89 hours. So it would take approximately 4 hours and 45 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
Response:  First, Poppy has placed a fourth of the pieces on the table, so she has 250 pieces left (1000 x 4/10 = 250).  Then, her mother added a third of the remaining pieces, which is 333 pieces (750 x 3/10 = 333).  So, in total, there are 683 pieces of puzzle left to be placed (250 + 333 = 683).
Response:  If Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, that means Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies.  So together, they eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.
Response:  First we need to find out how much space is inside each box.  We can do this by multiplying the length, width and height of each box.  For example, for the first box:  Length = 5 inches, Width = 6 inches, Height = 4 inches So, volume of first box = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches Now let's calculate the volume of all three boxes: Volume of second box = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches (same as first box) Volume of third box = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches (same as first two boxes) Total volume of all three boxes = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches Therefore, the total volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic inches.
Response:  First, we know that Frankie watched 2 episodes of her favorite show each night from Monday to Thursday (for a total of 8 episodes). On Wednesday, she also watched some episodes of another show that was 30 minutes long (let's call this x episodes). In total, Frankie watched 8 + x hours of television. We are told that she watched 7 hours in total. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:  8 + x = 7  Now solve for x.  Answer:  x = 1  Therefore, on Wednesday, Frankie watched one episode of the 30-minute program.
Response:  First, we know that Henry made 15 more galetes than he wanted to this year. Last year, he made x galetes (since he didn't want to make any more than that). So, this year, he made x + 15 galetes.  Now, we know that 5 of those extra galetes fell and broke, so Henry has 110 - 5 = 105 galetes in total.  We can set up an equation based on these facts:  x + 15 = 105  Since we are trying to find out how many galetes Henry made last year, we will isolate x.  x + 15 = 105  Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:  x = 90  Therefore, Henry made 90 galetes last year.
Response:  First, we know that the cost of one gallon of gasoline is $3.00. If someone buys 10 gallons, then they will pay 10 x $3.00 = $30.00 for all 10 gallons. Now, if this person also receives $0.20 in metal for each gallon, then they will receive an additional amount equal to 10 x $0.20 = $2.00. So, after receiving both the payment and the reward, the total amount received by this person would be $30.00 + $2.00 = $32.00. Therefore, the final amount of gasoline they have is 10 gallons (since they paid $32.00 for it).
Response:  First, we know that Beatrice had 2 wide rolls and 24 long rolls for a total of 26 rolls.  Marcel had 3 wide rolls and 14 long rolls for a total of 17 rolls.  So together they had 26 + 17 = 43 rolls.  Now let's find out how many rolls each person ate on average.  To do this, we need to divide the total number of rolls eaten by the number of people.  In this case, there are two people, so we would divide 43 rolls by 2 to get an average of 21.5 rolls per person.
Response:  First, we know that the boat was taking in two liters of water for every ten feet it traveled. So if the boat traveled twenty feet (2 x 10), it would take in forty liters of water (2 x 20).  Now, we are given that the coast is sixty-four seconds away from where the boat started. This means that the boat must have been traveling at a speed of sixty-four seconds per mile. Since there are six hundred and four seconds in an hour, this works out to one half mile per hour.  Therefore, the boat traveled half a mile in twenty feet, which gives us a ratio of one foot of distance traveled to eighty seconds of time taken.  We also know that the boat took seventeen seconds to travel twenty feet. So if we multiply seventeen seconds by eighty seconds per foot, we get sixteen hundred and eighty seconds, or approximately thirty-eight minutes and forty seconds.  Thus, the boat had taken in exactly thirty-eight minutes and forty seconds worth of water when the Julia arrived at the coast.
Response:  There are 4 professors and each professor has 2 classes per day. So there are in total 8 classes per day. If the blackboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, then it will be cleaned 8 x 3 = 24 times per day.
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers per day and there are 15 days in total, then he has planted a total of 2 x 15 = 30 flowers.  Now, if 5 of them did not grow, we can subtract 5 from 30 to get the final number of flowers that grew:  30 - 5 = 25.  So, after 15 days, Ryan has 25 flowers that have grown in his garden.
Response:  First, we know that the number of ducks in Jamal's photo is 3 times the number of birds in Brittany's phone. So if Brittany has 50 birds, then Jamal has 3 x 50 = 150 ducks.  Now, we know that each duck takes up 6 times as much space as one bird, so the total amount of space used by all the ducks in Jamal's phone is 150 x 6 = 900.  Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, we know that the remaining space available on his phone is 1800 - 900 = 900.  Finally, since each bird takes up 50 times as much space as one ocell, we can calculate how many owls fit in Jamal's phone by dividing the remaining space by the size of each owl: 900 / 50 = 18.  Therefore, there are 18 owls visible in Jamal's photo from the zoo.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha spent in total for all of her lumber.  We know that she has ten 2x4x10 boards that cost $10 each, so that's $10 x 10 = $100.  She also has five 4x4x10 boards that cost $16 each, so that's $16 x 5 = $80.  In total, Sasha spent $100 + $80 = $180.  Now, let's find out how much profit she made if she sold everything.  If the price of lumber has gone up by 50%, then the new price is 1.5 times the old price (50% increase).  So, the new price of the 2x4x10 boards is $10 x 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4x4x10 boards is $16 x 1.5 = $24 each.  If Sasha sells all ten 2x4x10 boards at $15 each, she will make $15 x 10 = $150.  And if she sells all five 4x4x10 boards at $24 each, she will make $24 x 5 = $120.  In total, Sasha will make $150 + $120 = $270.  So, her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.
Response:  We know that Katy used 7/13 of the sugar and water mixture. So we can start by finding out how much she used of each ingredient.  Since there are 120 cullerades of sugar and water in total, we can set up two ratios to represent the relationship between the amount of sugar and water used:   Ratio of sugar used to water used = 7/13 = 5/9  Now we have two equations based on these ratios:   Equation 1: 5x = 9(120) = 1080 (where x is the number of cullerades of sugar used)   Equation 2: 9y = 7(120) = 84 (where y is the number of cullerades of water used)  Solving for x and y, we get:  x = 1080 / 5 = 216 (number of cullerades of sugar used)  y = 84 / 9 = 9 (number of cullerades of water used)  Therefore, Katy used 216 cullerades of sugar and 9 cullerades of water.
Response:  First, we know that John buys two pairs of shoes for each of his three children. So he buys a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes.  Next, we know that each pair costs $60, so the total cost is 6 x $60 = $360.  Therefore, John pays $360 for all six pairs of shoes.
Response:  We know that there were 2 containers imported on the first day, and each container had 5 vehicles inside. So, in total, there were 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles imported on the first day. On the second day, we are told that there were 30 vehicles at the port, so we can assume that all of them were imported. Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can calculate the number of containers as follows:  Number of containers = Total number of vehicles / Number of vehicles per container  = 30 / 5  = 6 containers Therefore, on the second day, 6 containers were imported.
"Response:  First, we know that Adrien's current salary is $120,000, which is 30% higher than Lylah's salary of $90,000.  Four years ago, Adrien's salary was $80,000, which is 40% more than Lylah's salary at the time of $57,143 (since Lylah's salary increased by 30%).  So, Adrien's salary four years ago was $80,000 and Lylah's salary was $57,143.  Now, let's calculate their new salaries four years later.  Since both salaries increased simultaneously, we can use the same percentage increase for both.  If Adrien's salary increased by 30%, then Lylah's salary also increased by 30%.  Therefore, Adrien's new salary would be:  
New Salary = Old Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase)  
= $80,000 x (1 + 0.30)  
= $80,000 x 1.30  
= $104,000  
Similarly, Lylah's new salary would be:  
New Salary = Old Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase)  
= $57,143 x (1 + 0.30)  
= $57,143 x 1.30  
= $75,699  
Therefore, Adrien's new salary is $104,000, and Lylah's new salary is $75,699."
Response:  If Miguel uses two blocks of paper per week and each block has 30 sheets, then he uses a total of 60 sheets of paper per week (2 x 30).  Since there are 5 weeks in a month, Miguel uses a total of 60 x 5 = 300 sheets of paper per month.
Response:  First, we know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges for a total of 13 fruits.  Next, we know that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples.  Additionally, Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 1/2 x 8 = 4 oranges.  Therefore, in total, there are 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.
Response:  First, we know that La Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday. Then, she slept for 2 hours less each of the next two days, so she slept for 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Tuesday and 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Wednesday.  In total, she slept for 8 + 6 + 6 = 19 hours during the first three days of the week.  Since she slept for 1 hour more than those three days, she must have slept for an additional 1 hour on Thursday through Sunday.  Therefore, her total sleep for the entire week is 19 + 1 = 20 hours.
"Response:  First, we know that La Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers a distance of:  

10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles  Now, we are told that after 3 hours, she slows down to 8 kilometers per hour. So, if she runs for an additional 4 hours (since she ran for 3 hours already), her total distance traveled is:  

8 kilometers/hour x 4 hours = 32 kilometers  Therefore, in 7 hours, La Rosie can cover a total distance of:  

30 miles + 32 kilometers = 62 miles or 100 kilometers"
Response:  If Jennie has put stamps on one-third of the cards that need stamps, then she has not put stamps on two-thirds of them. So, if there are currently 30 cards in the stamped pile, and Jennie has put stamps on one-third of the cards that need stamps, then there must have been 2/3 x 60 = 40 cards in the original pile that needed stamps.  Therefore, there were 40 cards in the original pile when Jennie started.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia bought a new pack of spoons and her husband also gave her 5 new ones later. So, in total, Julia had 8 spoons (new + given). Now, she used 3 spoons to taste the stew, so she has 8 - 3 = 5 spoons left. Finally, when she was setting the table, she found 12 spoons! This means that there were 12 - 5 = 7 extra spoons at the table. Therefore, the number of spoons in the pack that Julia bought is 7.
"Response:  We know that Dylan bought more chicken sausages than fish sausages, so we can start by finding out how many chicken sausages she bought. The problem states that she bought 38 chicken sausages. Now, let's find out how many fish sausages she bought. Since there are 6 fish sausages more than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages as follows:  
Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6  
Now, we have found the total number of sausages that Dylan bought:  
Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages  
Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get:  
Total number of sausages = 38 + 6  
Total number of sausages = 44 Therefore, Dylan bought 44 sausages in total."
Response:  First, we know that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily after transferring to a new school. So if Lily had x friends, then Amy would have x + 20 friends.  Second, we are told that Lily has 50 friends in total. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + (x + 20) = 50  Combining like terms, we get:  2x + 20 = 50  Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:  2x = 30  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  x = 15  Now that we know how many friends Lily has, we can find out how many friends Amy and Lily together have. We know that Amy has x + 20 friends, so with Lily having 15 friends, they together have:  (15 + 20) = 35 friends.  There are 35 friends altogether between Amy and Lily.
Response:  First, we know that one melon costs three times as much as one pepper. So if one pepper costs $15, then one melon will cost $15 x 3 = $45. Since Dillon wants to buy four melons, he will have to pay $45 x 4 = $180 for them. Next, we know that each tangerine costs $5 less than each melon. So if one melon costs $45, then one tangerine will cost $45 - $5 = $40. Since Dillon wants to buy ten tangerines, he will have to pay $40 x 10 = $400 in addition to the $180 he paid for the melons. Therefore, the total amount of money that Dillon will have to spend is $180 + $400 = $580.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much time each doctor spends with each patient. Since there are 500 patients and each doctor sees 24 patients per day (assuming an 8-hour shift), each doctor will spend:   Time spent with patients = Number of patients x Time per patient  = 500 x 24/60  = 3 hours per day  Now that we know how much time each doctor spends with patients, let's calculate how much money the hospital earns from each patient visit. We know that the doctors charge $150 per hour and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour. So, if a doctor sees one patient for three hours, the hospital earns:  Revenue from one patient visit = Doctor fee + Hospital fee  = $150 + $200  = $350  To find out how much the hospital earns in total, we can multiply the number of patient visits per day by the revenue from one patient visit:  Total daily revenue = Number of patient visits x Revenue from one patient visit  = 500 x $350  = $175,000 per day  Therefore, the hospital earns $175,000 per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 60 workers were hired to make elves in Nissa's factory. Secondly, one-third of the workers abandoned their jobs after being vomited on by children. Finally, ten more workers left because they got tired of having their legs pulled. So let's calculate how many workers are left: 60 - (20/3) = 60 - 6 = 54 workers are left.
Response:  First, we know that Joseph spent $500 in May.  Second, we know that he spent $60 less in June than in May.  So, if we subtract $60 from $500, we get: Total expenses for both months = $500 - $60 = $440.  Therefore, Joseph's total expenses during these two months were $440.
Response:  First, they went to the roller coaster.  Pam rode it twice and Fred rode it four times, so together they rode it six times (2 + 4 = 6).  Each ride cost $6, so they spent $6 x 6 = $36 on the roller coaster.  Next, they went to the luge and rode it two times each, for a total of four rides ($6 x 4 = $24).  Therefore, the total amount they spent at the fair is $36 + $24 = $60.
"Response:  First, we know that Walt walked 6 km on Monday (dilluns). Next, we know that he walked 6 times more miles on Tuesday than he did on Monday. So if he walked x kilometers on Monday, then he walked 6x kilometers on Tuesday. Finally, we are told that his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Let x be the number of kilometers Walt walked on Monday. Then, let y be the number of kilometers Walt walked on Tuesday. We know that y = 6x because Walt walked 6 times as far on Tuesday as he did on Monday. Finally, we know that the total distance Walt traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, so we can write the following equation:  

x + 6x = 41  
7x = 41  
x = 6  
y = 6x = 6(6) = 36  
Therefore, Walt walked 36 kilometers on Tuesday."
Response:  If Tom rents four cars per month and each car rental costs $15, how much does he pay in one year?  To find out, we need to calculate how much he pays per month first.  So, if Tom rents four cars per month, that means he rents 4 x 12 = 48 cars per year (since there are 12 months in a year).  Now, let's multiply the number of cars he rents per year by the cost of each car rental:  48 cars/year x $15/car = $720/year  Therefore, Tom pays $720 per year for car rentals.
Response:  First, we know that Brian has 20 video games minus 5, which is equal to 15.  Now, we are told that Bobby has five times less than Brian, so Bobby has 15 x 5 = 75 video games.  However, we are also given that Bobby has three more video games than Brian, so Bobby actually has 75 + 3 = 78 video games.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in the world and one-third of them (9) are located in Scotland. Since two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are females, we can find out how many female unicorns there are by multiplying 9 by 2/3.  Multiplying 9 x 2/3 gives us an answer of 6. So, there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items ordered:  
Sub sandwiches x 2 = $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 Bosses of potatoes x 2 = $1.50 x 2 = $3.00 Galets x 2 = $1.00 x 2 = $2.00 Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 Next, we need to add the delivery fee (20%): Delivery fee = $20.00 x 20% = $4.00 So, the total cost with delivery is: Total cost with delivery = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00 Finally, Rory wants to add a tip of $5.00, so the final cost will be: Final cost = $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00"
Response:  First, we know that Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. So he spent 8 hours x 5 questions/hour = 40 questions per hour on the first test. Since there were 75 questions in total, Mark completed 75 - 40 = 35 questions per hour on the first test. Now let's move on to the second test. We know that Mark has 6 hours to complete the 100-question test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. Therefore, he will spend 6 hours x 5 questions/hour = 30 questions per hour on the second test. Since there are 100 questions in total, Mark will leave 100 - 30 = 70 questions unanswered after completing the second test.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 times as many pink balls as blue balls, so if we have x blue balls, we will have 4x pink balls.  Since there are 12 blue balls in total, we can write an equation:  
x + 4x = 12 5x = 12  x = 3  So, there are 3 pink balls."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for renting and we have to find out how many of them are semi-automatic.  Firstly, let's calculate the total number of cars that are not semi-automatic. We know that 12 cars are automatic and 4 cars are manual, so together they make up:  
12 + 4 = 16 cars that are not semi-automatic. Now, we can subtract the number of non-semi-automatic cars from the total number of cars available for renting:  
20 - 16 = 4 cars that are semi-automatic. Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:  
(4/20) x 100% = 20%"
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total (rusc).  Of those, we know that half are workers and half are queen bees.  So, the number of worker bees is 700/2 = 350.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games per week.  There are 7 days in a week and he plays for 2 hours each day, so:  

Time spent playing video games per week = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week  
Next, let's calculate how much money Jordan earns from his part-time job. We know that he earns $10 per hour, so:  

Weekly earnings from part-time job = $10/hour x 10 hours/week (assuming he works 5 days/week) = $100/week  
Now, let's add up Jordan's total weekly income from both sources:  

Total weekly income = Weekly earnings from part-time job + Time spent playing video games per week  
= $100/week + $14/week = $114/week  
Therefore, if Jordan were to spend all of his time working instead of playing video games, he would earn an additional $114 per week."
"Response:  First we calculate the total cost of all items before tax:  
John buys lettuce for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and traps for $4. So the total cost without tax is:  
$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15  
Now let's apply the 10% sales tax rate to only non-food items (since food items are not subject to tax):  
The tax on $15 worth of non-food items would be:  
$15 x 0.10 = $1.50  
So the total cost with tax would be:  
$15 + $1.50 = $16.50"
Response:  First, we know that each client will need two bottles of cleaning solution and one pack of wipes for a total of $2 + $5 = $7 per client. Since there are already three clients, the weekly revenue is $7 x 3 = $21. If he gets five more clients, the weekly revenue would be $21 + (5 x $7) = $21 + $35 = $56. His total weekly expenses are $21, so his profit would be $56 - $21 = $35. Therefore, Lucas will make a profit of $35 per week if he gets five more clients.
Response:  First we need to calculate how many ananas are in one hectare. We know there are 100 ananases per hectare, so:  One hectare has 100 ananases. Now let's find out how many ananases John can collect in one year. We know he can harvest every three months, so he will have four harvests in one year. To calculate this, we multiply the number of ananases per hectare by the number of hectares John has:  So, John can collect 4 x 10 = 40 hectares x 100 ananases/hectare = 4,000 ananases per year.
Response:  First, we know that Johnny has three boxes of LEGOs: one with 500 pieces, one with 3 times as many pieces as the first box (so 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces), and one with one-quarter of the number of pieces in the first box (so 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces). In total, Johnny has 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2225 pieces of LEGOs.
Response:  First, we know that in the first 6 hours, there were 30 bees that left the bush and flew away. In the next 6 hours, half of them returned, which is 15 bees. So, in total, there were 30 + 15 = 45 bees that left the bush. Now, if all the bees that had left before did not return, then there would only be 45 - (number of bees that returned) bees returning to the hive in the last 6 hours. Since all the bees that had left before returned, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is simply 45. Therefore, the answer is 45 bees.
Response:  First, we know that the total cost of admission for an adult and one child is $12 + $10 = $22. Since Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8, she must have paid for two adult tickets ($12 x 2 = $24) and one child ticket ($10). Therefore, the amount of money that Brittany's mother gave to the cashier was $24 - $8 = $16.
"Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends.  We also know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x friends, James has 4x friends.  Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
3x = 12... (1)   
We also know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can write another equation:  
4x =?... (2)  Now we need to find out what number will make equation (2) true. To do this, we can substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2):  
4(12) = 48... (3)  So, James has 48 friends on Facebook."
"Response:  First we need to find out how long it takes Steve to get to school. We know he can go at 440 feet per minute, so if he has to travel 3 miles (which is equal to 15,000 feet), it will take him:  
Time = Distance / Speed Time = 15,000 ft / 440 ft/min Time = 33.3 minutes Steve will arrive at school in 33.3 minutes Now let's find out how long it takes Tim to get to school. We know he can go at 264 feet per minute, and he has to travel 3 kilometers (which is equal to 9,842 feet). So:  
Time = Distance / Speed Time = 9,842 ft / 264 ft/min Time = 37.5 minutes Tim will arrive at school in 37.5 minutes Since Steve arrives before Tim, Steve wins the race. The difference between their arrival times is:  
Arrival time of Steve - Arrival time of Tim = 33.3 min - 37.5 min = 4.2 minutes Therefore, Steve will wait for Tim for 4.2 minutes before he finishes the race."
Response:  First, we know that 5 people with bicycles came to inflate their tires, and each tire costs $0.25 to inflate. So, in total, Shawnda earned $1.25 from these customers ($0.25 x 5 customers). Next, 3 people with tricycles came to inflate their tires, and each tire also costs $0.25 to inflate. Therefore, Shawnda earned an additional $0.75 from these customers ($0.25 x 3 customers). Finally, one person with a monocycle came to inflate their tire, which costs $0.25 as well. So, Shawnda earned another $0.25 from this customer. In total, Shawnda earned $2.25 for the day.
Response:  First, we know that Carl buys two packs of crackers. That means he buys 2 x 6 = 12 crackers in total.  Next, we know that each cracker costs $0.10. So, the total amount Carl pays is 12 x $0.10 = $1.20.  Finally, since Carl pays with a $10 bill, he receives $10 - $1.20 = $8.80 in change.
Response:  First, Dave ate 14 of the potatoes before the greedy crow stole the bag from him. So there were 14 - 14 = 0 potatoes left in the bag when the crow arrived.  Next, the crow ate half of what was left, which is half of 0, or 0. Then, three doves came and each ate three potatoes, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 potatoes. After that, a mouse took two thirds of what was left, which is two thirds of 0, or 0. Finally, ants carried away one potato, leaving five potatoes behind. Therefore, there were 5 potatoes left in the bag when Dave bought it.
"Response:  First, we know that Kimo has three classes per day from Monday to Friday (3 x 5 = 15 hours).  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two classes of 2 hours each (2 x 2 = 4 hours), so in total for those days, he spends 15 + 4 = 19 hours.  For the remaining days, he attends his regular three classes (3 x 3 = 9 hours). Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends in class during one semester is:  
15 (Monday-Friday) + 19 (Tuesday-Thursday) + 9 (Monday-Friday) = 43 hours."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how many items are in each row of products.  A pallet has 300 items, so there are 30 rows of products (since 300 / 10 = 30).  Each row contains:  
* 120 croissants (120 / 15 = 8 rows)  
* 60 baguettes (60 / 1.5 = 40 rows)  Now let's calculate the total number of items:  Total items = 30 rows x 8 rows + 40 rows = 240 rows  To find out how long it will take for all the products to be standing upright, we need to know the height of one item.  The height of a single croissant is 15 cm, so the total height of all the croissants is:  
Total height = 15 cm x 8 rows = 120 cm  Similarly, the total height of all the baguettes is:  
Total height = 1.5 m x 40 rows = 600 cm  Finally, we can calculate the time it will take for all the products to be standing upright using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed, where distance is the total height and speed is the rate at which the products are placed (which we don't know).  So we can use an average value of 1 meter per second (which is a reasonable estimate for placing products on shelves):  Time = 600 cm / 1 m/s = 600 seconds or approximately 10 minutes."
"Response:  We know that there are three types of monkeys in the zoo: micos, goril·les, and babuins.  Each type of monkey eats a different number of bananas each month.  The micos eat 200 bananas, the goril·les eat 400 bananas, and the babuins eat 100 bananas.  To find out how many bananas the zoo needs for two months, we need to multiply the number of bananas each monkey eats by the number of monkeys.  So, for two months, the zoo will need:  
Micos: 200 x 2 = 400 bananas  
Goril·les: 400 x 2 = 800 bananas  
Babuins: 100 x 2 = 200 bananas  Therefore, the zoo needs a total of 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas for two months."
Response:  First, we know that Blake runs back and forth 15 times across the football field, which is 100 meters long. That means he covers a total distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters.  Next, we know that Kelly runs once from one end of the field to the other (25 meters) and then back again, for a total distance of 2 x 25 = 50 meters.  Now, let's calculate how many times Kelly can run compared to Blake. Since Kelly only runs once from one end of the field to the other, while Blake runs 15 times, we can say that Kelly has run half as much as Blake. So, if Blake ran 1500 meters, Kelly ran 1500 / 2 = 750 meters.  Finally, we are told that Kelly runs 34 times from one end of the field to the other. This means she covers a total distance of 34 x 25 = 850 meters.  Therefore, the winner who covers more distance in 15 minutes is... (drumroll please)... Kelly! She covered 850 meters, while Blake only covered 1500 meters.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much Raphael spent on pens. We know that he bought 4 of them and each one costs $1.50, so... 4 x $1.50 = $6.00  Next, let's calculate how much he spent on notebooks. He bought 2 of them and each one costs $4.00, so... 2 x $4.00 = $8.00 Finally, let's add up all of the amounts that Raphael spent: $6.00 + $8.00 = $14.00 So, in total, Raphael spent $14.00 on school supplies.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 11 swans in total.  Of those, 6 have already been observed to be hiding under a rock. So, the number of swans left to observe is:  
11 - 6 = 5  Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining swans are actually swimming in the lake. We can do this by subtracting the number of swans hidden under the rock from the total number of swans:  
5 - 2 (the two swans hiding under the rock) = 3  Therefore, there are 3 swans swimming in the lake that Finn can still observe."
Response:  First, we know that the tank had 5 meters of water on Monday (the initial amount). On Tuesday, it had 2 more meters of water, so the total depth was 5 + 2 = 7 meters. Now, we are told that on Wednesday, the depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, if the depth on Tuesday was 7 meters, then the depth on Wednesday would be 7 x 2/3 = 4.67 meters. Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is approximately 4.67 meters.
Response:  First, we know that Anakin caught 10 stars of the sea, which is equal to 10 x 5 = 50 fish.  Next, he caught 6 horses of the sea, which is equal to 6 x 4 = 24 fish. Finally, he caught 3 clownfish, which is equal to 3 x 2 = 6 fish. In total, Anakin caught 50 + 24 + 6 = 70 fish. Now let's look at what Locsin caught. She caught 5 fewer stars of the sea than Anakin, so she caught 5 x 5 = 25 fish. She also caught 3 fewer horses of the sea than Anakin, so she caught 3 x 4 = 12 fish. And finally, she caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so she caught 2 x 2 = 4 fish. In total, Locsin caught 25 + 12 + 4 = 39 fish. Therefore, Anakin and Locsin together caught 70 + 39 = 109 fish.
"Response:  First, we know that the price of the bag increases by 20% every two months. So if we start with a base price of $20, after one month, the price will be:  
$20 x 1.2 = $24 Second month: $24 x 1.2 = $28 Eight months later: $28 x 1.2 = $33 Sixteen months later: $33 x 1.2 = $39 Twenty-four months later (the end point): $39 x 1.2 = $46 Four years and six months later: $46 x 1.2 = $55 Therefore, after thirty-six months, the price of the bag would be $55."
Response:  First, we know that one figure of action costs $5 and one toy car costs $4. So if we have three figures of action, it will cost us $5 x 3 = $15. And if we have five toy cars, it will cost us $4 x 5 = $20. Now, let's add both amounts together to find out how much all the toys cost: $15 + $20 = $35. Therefore, all the toys cost $35 in total.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much time she will save if she hires an accountant.  If she does her taxes herself, she will spend 3 hours less working independently, so she will have 3 hours more free. Since she earns $35 per hour, she will lose $35 x 3 = $105 in income.  Now let's see what it would cost to hire an accountant. The accountant charges $90. So, if she hires an accountant, she will pay $90 and avoid losing $105 in income. Therefore, the difference between doing her taxes herself and hiring an accountant is $105 - $90 = $15. In other words, she will be better off financially by hiring an accountant.
Response:  First, we know that Elvira has a budget of 1500 euros and she spent 1090 euros on the computer with all its accessories (pantalla, teclat, ratolí). So far, she has spent 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 euros. Now, let's check how much money is left for her clothes:  1500 - 1423 = 77 euros.  Therefore, Elvira will have 77 euros left for her clothes.
"Response:  First, we know that each time Sandra babysits her niece, she receives 9 eggs from the neighbor.  Since she needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan, and she wants to make 15 flans, we can calculate how many times she has to babysit as follows:  
15 flans x 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs needed  
Since she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, she will have to do it:  
45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 times  
Therefore, Sandra has to babysit her niece 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser."
"Response:  We know that Brooke is x years old and Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So, Seth is 2x years old. Now we are given that in two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Brooke's age + Seth's age = 28  
x + 2x = 28  
3x = 28  
x = 9  
So, Brooke is 9 years old and Seth is 18 years old (twice 9)."
Response:  If Ethel has $8, then her double is $16.  So, Jimmy has $16 + 2 = $18.
Response:  First, we know that Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day, except for weekends when he walks 10 miles (which is approximately equal to 16 kilometers). So, during the weekdays, Pancho walks:  30 km/day x 5 days = 150 km/week During the weekend, Pancho walks:  10 mi / day x 2 days = 20 km/week Total distance walked by Pancho in one week:  150 km + 20 km = 170 km
Response:  First, we know that the barret costs $25. Next, we know that the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so if the hat costs $25, then the jacket will cost $25 x 3 = $75. Finally, we know that the pants cost half as much as the jacket, so if the jacket costs $75, then the pants will cost $75 / 2 = $37.50. Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $25 + $75 + $37.50 = $147.50.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many legs each group has:  
* Spiders (aranyes): 80 x 8 = 640 legs  
* Insects: 90 x 6 = 540 legs  
* Mutants: 3 x 10 = 30 legs  
Now, let's add up all the legs:  
Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs  
So, Jake sees 1210 legs walking around the museum."
Response:  First, we know that Sally Three is three years older than Sally Two. So if Sally Two has age x, then Sally Three has age x + 3.  Next, we know that the Grandy Red is twice as old as Sally Three. So the Grandy Red has age (x + 3) \* 2.  Finally, we are told that Sally Four and Sally Thirty-Two have the same age. So let's call their common age y. Then we can write down what we know so far:  Sally Two has age x  Sally Three has age x + 3  The Grandy Red has age (x + 3) * 2  Sally Four has age y  Sally Thirty-Two has age y Now we need to find out how old each of the four birds are in total. To do this, we add up all their ages: Total Age = x + (x + 3) * 2 + y + y We simplify this expression by combining like terms: Total Age = 2x + 6 + 2y Now we solve for y by substituting the value of x = 4, which makes sense since Sally Four and Sally Thirty-Two both have age 8: 2(4) + 6 + 2(8) =?  Answer: 20 + 6 + 16 = 42
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment.  For the student loans, she needs to pay 1.5 times the minimum payment (50% more), so the monthly payment would be:  

$$ \text{Student Loans} = 300 \times 1.5 = 450 $$
For the credit card, she needs to pay 1.5 times the minimum payment (50% more), so the monthly payment would be:  

$$ \text{Credit Card} = 200 \times 1.5 = 300 $$
For the mortgage, she needs to pay 1.5 times the minimum payment (50% more), so the monthly payment would be:  

$$ \text{Mortgage} = 500 \times 1.5 = 750 $$
Now that we have calculated the monthly payments for each debt, let's find out how much Jessica will pay in one year if she pays these amounts every month.  To do this, we can multiply the monthly payment by 12 months:  

$$ \text{Total Payment per Year} = \text{Monthly Payment} \times 12 $$
So, Jessica's total payment per year for her student loans is:  

$$ \text{Total Payment per Year (Student Loans)} = 450 \times 12 = 5,400 $$
Her total payment per year for her credit card is:  

$$ \text{Total Payment per Year (Credit Card)} = 300 \times 12 = 3,600 $$
And her total payment per year for her mortgage is:  

$$ \text{Total Payment per Year (Mortgage)} = 750 \times 12 = 9,000 $$
Therefore, Jessica will pay a total of:  

$$ \text{Total Payment per Year} = 5,400 + 3,600 +"
Response:  First, Billy needs to peel all 60 potatoes (1 minute and 30 seconds each) = 60 minutes x 1 minute and 30 seconds = 60 x 90 = 5400 seconds.  Next, he needs to cut all 60 potatoes (5 seconds each) = 60 minutes x 5 seconds = 60 x 5 = 300 seconds.  In total, Billy will need 5400 + 300 = 5700 seconds or approximately 95 minutes to prepare all the potatoes for his big family reunion barbecue.
"Response:  First, we know that they sold each glass for $0.50 and made $25 in profits. So, if we let X be the number of glasses sold, then:  
X \* $0.50 = $25  Now, we also know that each glass requires $3 worth of lemons and $2 worth of sugar. So, if we let Y be the number of lemons used and Z be the number of sugars used, then:  
Y + Z = 3(X) (since each glass uses 3 lemons and 2 sugars)  Since they made $25 in profits, their total revenue must equal their total cost:  Revenue = Cost  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  
$0.50X + $3Y + $2Z = $25  Now, we have three variables (X, Y, and Z) and one equation. Can you solve for X?  Solution:  To solve for X, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by subtracting $3Y from both sides of the equation:  
$0.50X + $2Z - $3Y = $25 - $3Y  This simplifies to:  
$0.50X + $2Z = $22  Next, we can add $3Y to both sides of the equation:  
$0.50X + $2Z + $3Y = $22 + $3Y  This gives us:  
$0.50X + $2Z + $3Y = $25  Finally, we can substitute Y = 20 (the number of lemons used per gallon):  
$0.50X + $2(20) + $3(20) = $25  Simplifying this expression, we get:  
$0.50X + $40 + $60 = $25  Combining like terms, we get:  
$100 = $25  Solving for X, we get:  
X = 4  Therefore, they sold 4 gallons of lemonade."
Response:  We know that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese. That means there are 160 non-Japanese Asians (240 - 80 = 160). Since 60 of these non-Japanese Asians are boys, we can find out how many girls there are by subtracting 60 from 160: 160 - 60 = 100. Therefore, there are 100 girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  First, we know that Zaid spends a quarter of his salary on rent, which is 6,000 x 0.25 = 1,500 $ per month. Next, he spends a third of his salary on gas for his car, which is 6,000 x 0.33 = 2,000 $ per month. Then, he gives half of what remains to charity, so he has 6,000 - 1,500 - 2,000 = 2,500 $ left over each month. Finally, he gives his daughter 200 $ per month and his wife 700 $ per month, so he has 2,500 - 200 - 700 = 1,600 $ remaining after all these expenses and donations.  So, if Zaid earns 6,000 $ per month, he will have 1,600 $ left over after paying all of his bills and making his donations.
Response:  First, we know that Rani has 10 rats more than Monica, so Monica has 4 less rats than Bo.  So, Monica has 40 - 4 = 36 rats. Now, Rani has 10 more rats than Monica, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 rats.  Therefore, together they have 40 + 46 = 86 rats.
"Response:  First, we know that Lloyd makes $10 per hour. So if he worked for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week, how much did he earn in total?  
First Week:  5 hours x $10/hour = $50 Second Week:  8 hours x $10/hour = $80 Total Earnings: $50 + $80 = $130"
"Response:  We know that there were 80 students in the class who voted and one candidate received 3/4 of the votes. To find out how many votes the losing candidate received, we can subtract the number of votes the winning candidate received from the total number of votes cast (80). So, the number of votes the losing candidate received is:  
80 - 3/4(80) = 80 - 60 = 20.  Therefore, the losing candidate received 20 votes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra requested four times more red roses than white lilies. So if she requested 200 lily whites, then she requested 800 red roses (4 x 200).  Secondly, we know that there is an issue with the delivery of some of the red roses. Specifically, it seems that 200 red roses are missing from the original order. Therefore, to maintain the business relationship with Sandra, Fred must deliver at least 600 red roses before 5 pm (800 - 200 = 600).
Response:  First, we know that Mark is five years older than half of Jan's age, so we can set up an equation based on that information.  Half of Jan's age is (30/2) = 15.  So, Mark is five years older than 15, which means he is 15 + 5 = 20 years old.  Now, we are given that Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 20 + 2 = 22 years old.  Therefore, the correct answer is 22.
Response:  First we need to calculate how long it will take for each member of the second team to run the 400 meters. We know that the first runner will take 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So the second runner will take 60 + 3 = 63 seconds, the third runner will take 60 + 3 + 3 = 66 seconds, and the fourth runner will take 60 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 72 seconds. Now let's compare these times with the times of the first team: The first runner of the first team will take 55 seconds, and each subsequent runner will also take 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the first team will be 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds. Since the second team has four members, their total time will be 60 + 63 + 66 + 72 = 261 seconds. Therefore, the first team will win by 220 - 261 = 41 seconds.
"Response:  First, we need to find out how many ways there are to roll a 6-sided die and get an even number. Then, we subtract that from the total number of possible outcomes to find the probability of getting an odd number greater than 3.  There are three even numbers less than or equal to 3: 2, 4, and 6. So, the number of ways to roll an even number less than or equal to 3 is:  
C(6, 3) = 6 × 5 × 4 = 120  Now, let's find the number of ways to roll two even numbers in a row. The first even number can be any of the three above, so there are 3 possibilities for the first even number. For each of those possibilities, the second even number must be either 2, 4, or 6, since all the other numbers are odd. Therefore, the total number of ways to roll two even numbers in a row is:  
C(6, 2) × 3 = 6 × 5 × 3 = 90  Finally, we subtract the number of ways to roll two even numbers in a row from the total number of possible outcomes to find the probability of rolling an odd number greater than 3:  
Total number of possible outcomes = C(6, 6) = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 = 720 Probability of rolling an odd number greater than 3 = 120 / 720 = 1/6 or 16.7%  Therefore, the probability of rolling an odd number greater than 3 but not two consecutive even numbers is approximately 16.7%."
Response:  If Jenna collected half of what her mother collected, then Jenna collected 1/2 x 20 = 10 apples.  So both Jenna and her mother together collected 20 + 10 = 30 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 10 gàbies of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of palla, so we can start by adding up how many pieces of palla have been distributed to the hamsters:  10 gàbies x 5 peces/gàbia = 50 pieces of palla  Now let's look at the rats. There are 3 groups of rats with equal numbers in each group, and each group gets 6 pieces of palla. So we can add up how many pieces of palla have been distributed to the rats:  3 groups x 6 pieces/group = 18 pieces of palla  Finally, we need to subtract the number of pieces of palla distributed to the hamsters and rats from the total number of pieces of palla distributed (160) to find out how many pieces of palla are left for the conillas:  160 - 50 - 18 = 92 pieces of palla  Since each conill gets 20 pieces of palla, we can divide the remaining pieces among them:  92 / 20 = 4 groups of conills  Therefore, there must be 4 groups of conills, each with 20 pieces of palla.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months. To do this, we can use the formula for calculating compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the future value (the amount Mandy owes), P is the principal (the $100 that Mandy borrowed), r is the monthly interest rate (which is 2%/month or 24%/year), and n is the number of periods (in this case, 3 months). Plugging in the values, we get: A = $100(1 + 0.02)^3 = $100(1.06) = $106 So Mandy owes Benedict $106 after 3 months.
"Response:  First, we know that the merchant bought x bags of wheat from the farmer at $20 per bag.  We also know that it cost $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the market.  So, the total cost for the merchant is: 

x \* 20 + (x \* 2) = 20x + 2x = 22x 

We are told that the merchant made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at $30 each.  So, the revenue from selling all the bags is: 

x \* 30 = 30x 

Now we can set up an equation based on the information given:  

22x = 30x - 400 

Solving for x gives us: 

x = 16 

So, the merchant sold 16 bags of wheat."
Response:  First, we know that they spent $20.25 in three entries and $4.50 less on food than the entries. So, let's subtract $4.50 from $20.25:  $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. Now, we know how much they spent on entries. Next, we know that they went to two different rides that costed $33 each. So, if they went to two rides, then they paid twice this amount: $33 x 2 = $66. Finally, we need to add up all these amounts to find out how much each person paid: $15.75 + $66 = $81.75. Therefore, each of them paid $81.75.
Response:  First, we know that John collects 2 pebbles per minute. Since he collects for 3 hours, we need to multiply the number of minutes by 2 to find out how many pebbles he collects in total. So, if we multiply 2 x 180 (since there are 180 minutes in 3 hours), we get: 2 x 180 = 360 pebbles.  Therefore, John collects 360 pebbles during his 3-hour walk.
Response:  First, we know that each ane needs to eat 3.5 kilograms of insects per week to survive. Since there are ten ants in the flock, we can multiply the amount needed per ane by ten to find out how much they need collectively. So, the total amount of insects needed per day is:  10 x 3.5 kg = 35 kg/day
Response:  First, we know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees per year. So, after 10 years, he will have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees in total. However, we are also given that 30% of the trees die every year. Therefore, after 10 years, 30% of 100 trees is equal to 30 trees. So, the number of trees left with Tom after 10 years is 100 - 30 = 70 trees.
Response:  Firstly, there were 18 flamingos of plastic in the patio of Sue's house (Friday morning).  Then, on Saturday morning, they returned with one-third of the flamingos and painted them white (let's assume they painted all of them white, so we have 6 flamingos left to paint).  So, on Sunday morning, there would be 18 + 6 = 24 flamingos of plastic in the patio.  Now, let's count how many are rosy. We know that 18 flamingos were originally rosy, and they added 18 more on Sunday morning, so in total, there would be 18 + 18 = 36 flamingos rosy.  Therefore, at midday on Sunday, there would be 36 - 6 = 30 flamingos of plastic rosy in the patio.
Response:  First, we know that Violetta needs 5 different colors of crayons and she has prepared $20 for this purchase. Second, we know that each crayon costs $2. So, to find out how many crayons she can buy, let's divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon: $20 / $2 = 10. Therefore, Violetta can buy 10 crayons.
Response:  First, we know that one pen costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30. So if we buy 8 pens and 8 erasers, how much will it cost in total?  We can start by calculating the cost of the pens: 8 x $1.20 = $9.60 Now let's calculate the cost of the erasers: 8 x $0.30 = $2.40 Total cost = $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00 Therefore, 8 plomes (pens and erasers) would cost $12.00.
Response:  First, we know that there are 200 kilograms of pastries and we need to distribute them among 40 restaurants. Second, each restaurant will receive 2 kilograms of pastries. So, if we divide 200 by 40, we get: 200 kg / 40 = 5 kg per restaurant. Now, since each restaurant receives 2 kg of pastries, we can calculate how much is left over: 200 kg - (40 x 2 kg) = 200 kg - 80 kg = 120 kg. Therefore, 120 kilograms of pastries will not be used.
Response:  First, we know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in the city of Soda. Secondly, we know that among these inhabitants, there are 8417 men and 9092 women. Finally, we know that the rest of the population is made up of children. So, if we subtract the number of men and women from the total population, we will get the number of children.  Calculation: Total Population = Men + Women + Children Total Population = 8417 + 9092 + x x = 23786 Subtracting the sum of men and women from both sides gives us: x = 23786 - (8417 + 9092) x = 23786 - 17509 x = 6277 Therefore, there are 6277 children living in the city of Soda.
Response:  First month, Elaine collected 3 times more than she had initially, so she collected 20 x 3 = 60 cards.  Second month, she collected less than 20 cards, let's say she collected x cards (x < 20). So in total, Elaine has 60 + x cards. Third month, she collected double the number of cards as in the first and second months, so she collected 2(60 + x) = 2 x 60 + 2x cards. Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 2 x 60 + 2x = 120 + 2x cards.
"Response:  First, we know that Mark edits 1000 frases each week and Editor A pays him $0.05 per phrase. So, the amount of money Mark earns from Editor A is:  

$0.05 x 1000 = $50  Now, we know that Editor B pays Mark twice as much as Editor A, so the amount of money Mark earns from Editor B is:  

$0.05 x 1000 = $50 x 2 = $100  Therefore, in one week, Mark earns a total of $50 + $100 = $150."
Response:  First, we know that Baldur receives 5 cubs of water in the morning and 6 cubs of water in the evening, for a total of 11 cubs per day (5 + 6).  Since each cub contains 5 liters of water, Baldur receives a total of 55 liters of water per day (11 x 5).
"Response:  First, we know that John won a prize with a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% increase in salary.  Second, we know that John earns $2000 per week. Third, we know that the prize was awarded on the first day of the year. Now let's calculate how much John earned that year.  To do this, we need to calculate his total earnings for the year, including both his regular salary and the prize money.  We can start by calculating his weekly earnings for the year:  
Weekly Earnings = Number of weeks x Weekly Salary  Since there are 52 weeks in a year (ignoring leap years), John had 52 weeks of work:  Weekly Earnings = 52 x $2000 = $104,000  Next, we add the one-time prize money to John's annual earnings:  Total Annual Earnings = Weekly Earnings + Prize Money  Total Annual Earnings = $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000  Finally, we apply the 5% salary increase to John's total annual earnings:  Total Annual Earnings x 1.05 = $109,000 x 1.05 = $114,450  So, John earned $114,450 that year, assuming he worked every week and received the prize on the first day of the year."
Response:  First we need to calculate how many tons of grapes are produced in total each year. We know that there are 10 hectares and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes, so: Total production = 10 hectares x 5 tons/hectare = 50 tons/year Now we can calculate how many barrels of wine will be produced based on the fact that one ton of grapes makes two barrels of wine: Total barrels = Total production / 2 barrels/ton = 50 tons/year / 2 barrels/ton = 25 barrels/year So, Josie's farm produces 25 barrels of wine per year.
Response:  First, we know that Carl eats sandwiches for dinner every day this week and uses two slices of cheese in each sandwich. That means he used 2 x 7 = 14 pieces of cheese just for his sandwiches. Next, we know that he makes omelets three days a week using one more piece of cheese than egg. So, if he made three omelets, he used 3 x (1 + 1) = 3 x 2 = 6 pieces of cheese for the omelets. Now let's look at the pasta dish. We are told that he used eight slices of cheese for the pasta dish. However, since there were several meals, we need to divide the total number of slices of cheese by the number of meals. In other words, we can say that he used 8 / 5 = 1.6 pieces of cheese per meal. Since he had five meals, he used 5 x 1.6 = 8 pieces of cheese for the pasta dishes. Therefore, the total number of pieces of cheese Carl used is 14 + 6 + 8 = 28 pieces of cheese.
Response:  First, we know that Janet had 22 green feathers and 10 yellow feathers before she bought any more. So, in total, she had 22 + 10 = 32 feathers. Now, let's look at what she bought. She bought 6 bags of blue feathers, each with 9 feathers, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 blue feathers. And she bought 2 bags of red feathers, each with 6 feathers, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 red feathers. In total, then, Janet has 32 (her original feathers) + 54 (blue feathers) + 12 (red feathers) = 98 feathers now.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total score of all six tests without considering the lowest score. We can do this by multiplying each test score by 10 and then adding them up:  
Total score = (89 x 10) + (71 x 10) + (92 x 10) + (100 x 10) + (86 x 10) = 890 + 710 + 920 + 1000 + 860 = 4380 Now, let's subtract the lowest score from the total score to find out what Brinley needs to get in the sixth test to achieve an average of 93: Total score - Lowest score = 4380 - 71 = 4309 To obtain an average of 93, Brinley needs to score at least 93 x 10 = 930 in the sixth test."
Response:  First, we know that Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, so he rode a total of 5 x 4 = 20 times.  Each time, he rode 25 kilometers, so he traveled a total distance of 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers during those four weeks.  Then, he reduced the number of times he rode to twice a week and increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time, so he rode a total of 2 x 3 = 6 times during the next three weeks.  Each time, he rode 60 kilometers, so he traveled a total distance of 6 x 60 = 360 kilometers during those three weeks.  Therefore, in total, Michael rode his bike 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 25 bars of chocolate and each bar weighs 40 grams, so together they weigh:  
25 x 40 = 1000 grams  Now, we also know that there are 80 pieces of candy and each piece weighs half as much as a bar of chocolate, so together they weigh:  
80 x (1/2) = 40 grams  Therefore, the total weight of Joe's Halloween candy is:  
1000 + 40 = 1040 grams"
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 pastries.  On Tuesday, she bought three times as many pastries as she did on Monday, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 pastries.  On Wednesday, she bought five times as many pastries as she did on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 pastries.  In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 pastries after three days.
Response:  First, we know that half a dozen of plates costs $6,000 each, so one plate costs $6,000/2 = $3,000. Now, vintage dotzenes (12) of cups cost $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen of plates, so the cost of one cup is: $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800. Therefore, the cost of each cup is $1,800.
Response:  First, we know that Sara has $10 saved already. So she needs to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. The total cost of these items is $30 + $20 = $50. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we can divide the total cost by the amount she earns each time she mows: $50 / $4 = 12.5 times. Since you cannot mow the lawn a fraction of a time, Sara will need to mow the lawn 13 times (12 complete times plus one partial time) before she can afford the jacket and shoes.
"Response:  First, we know that Jerry has twice as many white chickens as red chickens, so he has 2x + 0 = 2(white) + 0(red) = 2(white) chickens.  Since each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day and each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by all chickens is:  

2(white) x 5 + 0(red) x 3 = 10 + 0 = 10 eggs/day.  We also know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day. So, if we set up an equation based on this information:  

10 = 42, we can solve for x (the number of white chickens):  

x = 42 / 10 = 42 / 5 = 8.  Therefore, Jerry has 8 white chickens.  Now, let's find out how many red chickens Jerry has.  We know that there are twice as many white chickens as red chickens, so:  

Number of red chickens = Number of white chickens x 2 = 8 x 2 = 16.  Therefore, Jerry has 16 red chickens."
"Response:  First, we need to convert miles to kilometers. There are 1.60934 kilometers in one mile, so:  
1.5 miles = 1.5 x 1.60934 km = 2.414 km 
Now, let's calculate how long it takes to walk this distance at 3 miles per hour:  
Time = Distance / Speed Time = 2.414 km / 3 mi/h Time = 0.8047 hours or approximately 48 minutes and 27 seconds."
Response:  On the first day, Sloane had 100 clients.  On the second day, she had 50 more clients, so on the second day, she had 100 + 50 = 150 clients.  Now, let's find out how many clients she had on the third day.  If she had 500 clients in total, and she already had 150 clients on the second day, then she must have had 500 - 150 = 350 clients on the third day.  So, the correct answer is 350.
Response:  First, we know that the large pool lost 4 gallons of water every minute, so it lost 4 x 4 = 16 gallons in 4 minutes.  Since the small pool had half as much water as the large pool at first, it started with 16/2 = 8 gallons of water.  Now, after 4 minutes, the small pool has lost 4 gallons of water just like the large pool, so it now contains 8 - 4 = 4 gallons of water.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Lori needs in total for her purchases: $320 (sabates) + $32 (cinturó) = $352. Next, we divide that amount by her hourly wage of $8.00 per hour: $352 / $8.00/hour = 44 hours. So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can afford to buy both pairs of shoes and the belt.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount that Janeth will pay over 12 months:  
165 x 12 = 1980  
Next, we can calculate the interest owed based on the original principal of $2000 and the promised interest rate of 10%:  
2000 x 0.10 = 200  
Now, let's subtract the interest from the total amount paid to find the remaining balance after all payments have been made:  
1980 - 200 = 1780  
Therefore, the remaining balance or ""saldo"" in Spanish, after Janeth has made all 12 monthly payments of $165 each, will be $1780."
Response:  We know that there are four roses and seven daisies in the floral arrangement.  To find out how many flowers there are in total, we need to add the number of roses and the number of daisies together.  So, if we add 4 + 7 =, we get. Therefore, there are flowers in the floral arrangement.
Response:  First, we know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so if Harriet is x years old, then Adrian is 3x years old.  Second, we know that Harriet is half of Zack's age, so if Zack is y years old, then Harriet is (y/2) years old.  Now we have two equations and two unknowns.  We can substitute the value of Harriet's age into one of the equations to eliminate her age.  Substituting x = 21 (since Harriet is currently 21 years old), we get:  3x = 63 (since Adrian is three times as old as Harriet) And (y/2) = 21 (since Harriet is half of Zack's age)  Now we can solve for Zack's age.  Solving both equations simultaneously, we get:  Zack's age = 42 years old.  Therefore, the median age of the three is 42 years old in three years.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Naomi scored 68 points. Secondly, Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's score, which is (68 x 2) = 136 points. Thirdly, Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so she scored (68 + 17) = 85 points. Finally, we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. We can set up an equation based on the information given:  
Naomi + Yuri + Brianna + Jojo = 251  
We can start solving for Jojo:  
Jojo = 251 - (Naomi + Yuri + Brianna)  
Substituting the values we have found:  
Jojo = 251 - (68 + 136 + 85)  
Simplifying and solving:  
Jojo = 251 - 299 = 42  
Therefore, Jojo scored 42 points."
"Response:  First, we know that it takes her 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.  Now, let's see how many crosswords and Sudokus she solved during the weekend. She solved 3 crosswords and 8 Sudokus. So, in total, she spent:  

3 x 10 = 30 minutes solving crosswords
8 x 5 = 40 minutes solving Sudokus
Total time spent playing games over the weekend: 30 + 40 = 70 minutes"
"Response:  First, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:  
Tank capacity - Amount used =? - 90  
We are also given that Celine collected twice as much rainwater as she used. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:  
Twice the amount used = 2 x 90 = 180 liters  
Now, let's add the amount of rainwater collected to the amount left in the tank after Celine used it:  
Tank capacity - Amount used + Rainwater collected =? - 90 + 180  
Simplifying and solving for the unknown quantity (the amount left in the tank), we get:  
Tank capacity - Amount used + Rainwater collected = Tank capacity + 180  
Tank capacity + 180 = Tank capacity - 90 + 180  
Tank capacity + 180 = Tank capacity + 270  
Solving for the tank capacity, we get:  
Tank capacity = 270 - 180 = 90 liters  
Therefore, there are 90 liters of water left in the tank now."
Response:  First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums.  Second, we know that he plants fewer petunias than geraniums.  So, if he plants x petunias, then he must plant 90 - x geraniums.  Now, let's add up all the flowers Andy plants:  x + 90 - x = 90 + x  Simplifying, we get:  2x = 180  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:   x = 90  Therefore, Andy plants 90 petunias and 90 geraniums in total.
"Response:  First, we know that the company spent $15,000 on advertising for the first year.  Then, we are told that they spent one-third of this amount for the second year.  So, if they spent $15,000 in the first year, and one-third of that is $5,000 (since one-third of $15,000 is $5,000), then the total amount the company spent on advertising for both years is:  
$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each person will pay for their rental.  For Carlos, he paid $30/hour, so if he used the canoe for 3 hours, his total cost would be:  
Carlos = $30 x 3 = $90  Now let's do the same calculation for Benji. He paid $18/hour, so if he used the banana boat for 5 hours, his total cost would be:  
Benji = $18 x 5 = $90  Since both people paid the same amount ($90), they will split the total cost equally. Therefore, the final answer is:  Total Cost = $90 / 2 = $45  So, in total, Carlos and Benji will pay $45 for their watercraft rentals."
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, then it will take half as long (3 days) to travel the same distance by car. Therefore, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will spend 6 + 3 = 9 days on the road.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many water-type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14 herbal-type cards. Then, we can use that number to find the percentage of probability that a randomly selected card will be a water-type card.  Calculation for the number of water-type cards:  After losing 8 water-type cards, James has 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards left.  When he buys 14 herbal-type cards, he now has 32 + 14 = 46 cards in total.  Now, let's calculate the percentage of probability that a randomly selected card will be a water-type card:  To do this, we divide the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards:  Percentage = (number of water-type cards / total number of cards) x 100%  Substituting the numbers, we get:  Percentage = (32 / 46) x 100%  Simplifying and rounding to the nearest integer, we get:  Percentage = 70%  So, there is a 70% chance that a randomly selected card from James's deck will be a water-type card.
"Response:  First we need to calculate the cost of the burrito without any upgrades or discounts:  
Base Burrito Cost = 6.50$  
Now let's add some upgrades:  
Carn Extra Cost = 2.00$   Formatge Extra Cost = 1.00$ Avocado Cost = 1.00$ Salsa Cost (2 pieces) = 0.25$ Total Upgrade Cost = 4.25$ Now we have the total cost with upgrades:  
Total Cost = Base Burrito Cost + Upgrade Cost = 6.50$ + 4.25$ = 10.75$ But wait! There is a 5 dollar gift card that can be used towards the purchase. So we subtract the value of the gift card from the total cost:  
New Total Cost = Total Cost - Gift Card Value = 10.75$ - 5.00$ = 5.75$ Therefore, the final amount owed would be $5.75$."
"Response:  First we need to find out how many pieces Kalinda can do in one hour. We know that she can do 4 pieces per minute, so if she works for one hour (which is 60 minutes), then she will do:  
4 pieces/minute x 60 minutes = 240 pieces/hour  Now let's find out how many pieces Kalinda's mother can do in one hour. We know that she can do half of what Kalinda does, so:  
240 pieces/hour (Kalinda) / 2 = 120 pieces/hour (mother)  To find out how many hours it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can do per hour:  
360 pieces / 240 pieces/hour (Kalinda) + 120 pieces/hour (mother) = 8 hours + 1 hour = 9 hours  Therefore, it will take them 9 hours to complete the puzzle."
Response:  First, we know that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested after two months, so 30% of 120 is 36.  Next, we know that three-fourths of the remaining watermelons were ready to be harvested two weeks later, so three-fourths of (120 - 36) is 96.  Finally, we subtract the number of watermelons that were already harvested (36) from the total number of watermelons left (96), and we get 60.  So, there were 60 watermelons that were not prepared for harvesting after two weeks.
Response:  First we calculate the total cost of all cars: 12 x 20,000 = 240,000 dollars. Then we add tax (10%) which is: 240,000 x 0.10 = 24,000 dollars. So the total amount paid for all cars is: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 dollars. Finally, there is an additional fee of 1000 dollars to register each car, so the final total is: 264,000 + (12 x 1000) = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 dollars.
Response:  First, we know that Kylie collected 5 more bombs than Robert on Monday, so if Robert collected 20 bombs, then Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 bombs.  On Tuesday, Kylie collected double the number of bombs she collected on Monday, so she collected 25 x 2 = 50 bombs.  Therefore, Kylie collected 50 bombs on Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 formigues in the garden and half of them (i.e., 25) were eating pomegranates, then the number of insects eating pomegranates is 25.  Now we need to find out how many other insects are in the garden if there are 25 formigues eating pomegranates.  We know that each formigue can eat 3 pomegranates per day, so there would be 25 x 3 = 75 pomegranates being eaten by formigues every day.  Since Dax found half of these pomegranates (i.e., 75 / 2 = 37.5), there must be at least this many insects in the garden eating other things besides pomegranates.  Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is at least 37.5 + 25 = 62.5.
Response:  First, we know that there are 36 penguins in total. Second, we know that one-third of them (12) jump and swim in the ocean. Third, we know that another third (12) go to the cave for dinner. Finally, we want to find out how many penguins remain to take the sun. To do this, we subtract the number of penguins who went swimming and those who went to the cave from the total number of penguins. So, 36 - 12 - 12 =?  The correct answer is 12. Therefore, 12 penguins remain to take the sun.
Response:  First we need to calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week. We know he eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes per week. Now we can calculate how many plants Steve needs to produce that much fruit. If each plant produces 3 tomatoes per week, then Steve will need 42 / 3 = 14 plants to meet his demand.
"Response:  First, we know that each friend will get 4 pieces of pizza, so we need to divide the total number of friends (20) by 4 to find out how many groups of friends we can make:  
20 / 4 = 5 groups  
Now, since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, and each group needs 4 slices, we can calculate how many pizzas we need:  
5 groups x 4 slices/group = 20 slices  
Since there are 8 slices in each pizza, we need:  
20 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 2.5 pizzas  
So, John needs to order 3 whole pizzas (since you can't have a fraction of a pizza)."
"Response:  If Ram uses five empty ink cartridges to make one full one, and he has 25 empty ink cartridges, how many full ink cartridges will he have after mixing them?  We can start by writing down what we know:  
* Ram has 25 empty ink cartridges.  
* Each empty ink cartridge can be mixed with four other empty ink cartridges to create one full ink cartridge.  
Now let's use this information to find out how many full ink cartridges Ram will have:  
1. Start with the number of empty ink cartridges Ram has: 25  
2. Divide the number of empty ink cartridges by the number of empty ink cartridges needed to create one full ink cartridge (4): 25 / 4 = 6  
3. Since each group of four empty ink cartridges creates one full ink cartridge, multiply the result from step 2 by 5 (the number of groups of four empty ink cartridges needed to create one full ink cartridge): 6 x 5 = 30  
Therefore, if Ram mixes all his empty ink cartridges as described, he will have 30 full ink cartridges."
Response:  First, we know that Johnny had $20 + $10 = $30.  Then he invested this money and it tripled in one year. So, after one year, he had $30 x 3 = $90.
"Response:  First, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 20 - 2 = 18 years old.  Next, we know that Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Finally, we can calculate the sum of their ages as follows:  
Mary (18) + Joan (25) + Jessa (20) = 18 + 25 + 20 = 63 years old."
"Response:  First we need to find out how many students remained in the classroom after the meeting. We know that 30% of the students left through exit A, so we can calculate the number of students who did not leave as follows:  
1000 x (1 - 0.3) = 1000 x 0.7 = 700  
Now, we know that 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, and the rest left through exit C. So let's calculate the number of students who left through each exit:  
Number leaving through exit B = 700 x 3/5 = 420  
Number leaving through exit C = 700 - 420 = 280  
Therefore, 280 students left through exit C."
Response:  First, we know that James has six more than Robert. So if Robert has x caramels, then James has x + 6 caramels.  Now, we also know that John has twice as many caramels as Robert. So John has 2x caramels.  We are asked to find out how many more caramels James has compared to John.  To do this, we need to subtract the number of caramels that James has from the number of caramels that John has:  James has x + 6 caramels and John has 2x caramels.  Subtracting x + 6 from 2x gives us:  2x - (x + 6) =?  Simplifying the expression, we get:  2x - x - 6 =?  Solving for the unknown variable x, we get:  3x - 6 =?  The value of x is not given in the problem statement, so we cannot determine the exact number of caramels that James has compared to John.  However, we can set up an inequality based on the information provided:  Since James has six more than Robert, and John has twice as many caramels as Robert, we can say that James has at least six more caramels than John.  Therefore, the difference between the number of caramels that James has and the number of caramels that John has is greater than or equal to six:   |James - John| > 6  This inequality represents the minimum number of caramels that James has compared to John.  Based on the information provided, we cannot determine the exact number of caramels that James has compared to John, but we can conclude that James has at least six more caramels than John.
Response:  First, we know that Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book. So together they have three books. Now, if each of them reads all the books they own as well as the ones owned by the other person, then Dolly will read three books (her own two plus Pandora's one), and Pandora will also read three books (her own one plus Dolly's two). Therefore, in total, they will have read six books collectively.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many pages Mike writes per week. Since he sends and receives two letters per week, and each letter is five pages long, Mike writes a total of 10 pages per week (2 x 5). Now, let's calculate how many hours it takes him to write those 10 pages. We know that Mike can write one page in six minutes, so he spends 10 pages x 6 minutes/page = 60 minutes writing per week. Therefore, Mike spends 60 minutes per week writing letters.
"Response:  First, we know that Jason has 1,000 minutes in total for the month. Second, he makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day, so that's 450 minutes (15 x 30 = 450) of calls to his boss. Third, he has had an additional 300 minutes of other calls this month, so that leaves us with:  
Minutes left for the month = Total minutes - Minutes used for boss calls - Additional calls This gives us: Minutes left for the month = 1,000 - 450 - 300 = 250 So, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month if it has 30 days."
Response:  First, we know that Kyle took 5 patatoes from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 patatoes left. Then, Ginger gave Griffin some of her potatoes, but we don't know how many yet. Next, Colby took 3 less than the number of potatoes that Kyle took, which is 3 less than 5, or 2. So, in total, Colby took 2 potatoes from Griffin. Now, let's add up all the changes to see how many potatoes Griffin has left: 19 + (-5) + 2 = 16. Therefore, Ginger must have given Griffin 16 potatoes for him to end up with 27 at the end.
Response:  We know that there are 4 crabs in one aquarium and 32 crabs in another. The difference between the number of crabs in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So if we let x be the number of fish in each aquarium, then the number of crabs in the first aquarium is 4x and the number of crabs in the second aquarium is 2x (since there are twice as many crabs in the second aquarium).  Now we need to find out what x is.  Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can set up the equation:  4x = 2(x)  Simplifying this equation, we get:  4x = 2x + 2x  Combining like terms, we get:  4x = 4x  Which simplifies to:  0 = 0  Therefore, x = 8.  So there are 8 fish in each aquarium.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much time she spends working each week: 4 days/week x 6 hours/day = 24 hours/week. Now let's calculate her total earnings for the entire project: 250 dollars/hour x 24 hours/week = $6,000/week. Since she works for 5 weeks (or 5 x 24 hours = 120 hours), her total earnings for the entire project would be: $6,000/week x 120 hours = $72,000. However, since she receives a 10% discount, her final payment would be: $72,000 x 90% = $65,200.
Response:  First, we need to find out how much each person paid based on the total amount spent and the number of people splitting the cost equally. Total amount spent = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98 So, if there are three people splitting the cost equally, then each person would pay $\frac{98}{3} = \$32$.
Response:  First, we know that each boss of cabbage costs $1.50.  If the chef bought 4 bosses, then he spent 4 x $1.50 = $6.00 on cabbage.
Response:  First, we know that Sue ate 4 times more than her sister on Monday. So if her sister ate x galetes, Sue ate 4x galetes. We also know that Sue ate double the number of galetes as her sister on Tuesday, so she ate 2(x+5) = 2x + 10 galetes. Now let's calculate the total number of calories eaten by each girl. For Sue, it would be:  Total calories for Sue = (4x + 2x + 10) \* 200 = 6x + 200  And for her sister, it would be:  Total calories for her sister = (x + 5) \* 200 = x + 1000  Since Sue ate 4 times more than her sister on Monday and double the number of galetes as her sister on Tuesday, Sue consumed more calories than her sister. To find out how much more, we can subtract the total calories for her sister from the total calories for Sue:  Difference in calories = 6x + 200 - (x + 1000) = 5x + 200  Therefore, Sue consumed 5x + 200 more calories than her sister.
