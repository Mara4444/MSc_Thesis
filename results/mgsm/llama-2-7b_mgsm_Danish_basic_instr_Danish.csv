Response:  For at finde ud af, hvor meget Janet tjener på bondemarkedet, behøves vi at kende antallet af æg, hun sælger, og prislisten pr. æg. Vi kan gennemføre følgende beregninger: Antal æg/dag = 16 x 3 = 48 æg/dag (antal æg, Janet producerer og sælger) Pris/æg = 2 $/æg (pris, Janet tjener for en frisk æg) Indtjening/dag = Antal æg x Pris/æg = 48 x 2 = 96 $/dag (indtjening, Janet tjener på bondemarkedet hver dag)
"Response:  To bolte blå fiber kræves, da det er angivet i spørgsmålet. Halvdelen af den hvide fiber betyder, at der behøves fire femtedel af den hvide fiber (4/5). Derfor vil der være en sammenhæng mellem antallet af bolte blå fiber og antallet af bolte hvide fiber på følgende måde:
Antallet af bolte blå fiber = Antallet af bolte hvide fiber x 4/5
Svaret kan derefter findes ved at multiplicere antallet af bolte hvide fiber med 4/5."
Response:  If the increased value of the house is $150,000 and Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, then his profit would be: Profit = Increased Value - Cost of Repairs = $150,000 - $50,000 = $100,000.

Response:  To calculate the time it will take to download a 200 GB file, we need to use the formula: Time = Size / Rate, where Size is the size of the file (in this case, 200 GB) and Rate is the downloading speed (in bits per second). Since Carla's normal downloading speed is 2 GB/minute, her rate is: Rate = 2 GB/minute = 136.5 MB/minute (since there are 8 bits in a byte, and 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds). Now, we can plug these values into the formula: Time = 200 GB / 136.5 MB/minute = approximately 1479 minutes or 24 hours and 19 minutes. Therefore, it will take Carla approximately 24 hours and 19 minutes to download a 200 GB file if she starts from the beginning every time an update forces a restart.
Response: 250 km
Response:  If Eliza worked 45 hours in this week and her hourly wage is $10, then her total income for the week would be: 45 hours x $10/hour = $450. Since she also received an overtime payment of 1.2 times her normal hourly wage, her total income for the week would be: $450 x 1.2 = $540.
Response:  If the program had 60 downloads in its first month, then it had 3 times as many downloads (or 180 downloads) in its second month.

Response:  If we know that Melanie sold a third of the vacuum cleaners to the green house, two to the red house, and half of what was left to the orange house, then we can use this information to find out how many vacuum cleaners she had at the beginning. Let's call the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the beginning x. We know that she sold a third of them to the green house, so she has x/3 fewer vacuum cleaners now. Similarly, she has x/2 fewer vacuum cleaners in the red house and x/2 fewer in the orange house. Therefore, the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left is x - (x/3 + x/2) = x - x/6. Since she still has five vacuum cleaners, we can set up the equation 5 = x - x/6. Solving for x, we get x = 15. So, Melanie started with 15 vacuum cleaners.

Response:  If the jewelry market increases by 2.5% and the electronic device market increases by 1.2% within the same month, then the total value of both markets will increase by a combined percentage of 3.7%. This means that if the kiosk owner wants to maximize their profit at the end of the month, they should choose to buy the electronics, which would result in a profit of $960 (8,000 x 1.037).
Response:  Let's assume that the two trains started from San Rafael at the same time and traveled in opposite directions. On the first day, they traveled westward and covered a distance of 130 kilometers. The next day, they traveled northward and covered a distance of 150 miles. To find the distance between the two trains on each day, we can use the conversion factor of 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers. Therefore, the distance between the two trains on the first day is: Distance = 130 km x (1 mile / 1.60934 km) = 82.7 miles Distance between the two trains on the second day = 150 miles - 82.7 miles = 67.3 miles So, the distance between the two trains on the second day was 67.3 miles.

Response:  Ifølge spørgsmålet tog Marissa 1 time at gå de første 4 miles, der er 4/1 = 0,4 mile pr time. Og hun tog 1 time at gå de næste 2 miles, der er 2/1 = 0,2 mile pr time. For at finde ud af, how fast hun skal gå den resterende afstand, dividerer vi denne afstand med tiden det tog hende at gå den:  Den resterende afstand = 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = 6 miles. Tiden det tog hende at gå denne afstand = 6 miles / (0,4 mile/time + 0,2 mile/time) = 6 miles / 0,6 mile/time = 10 km/t.
Response:  Ifølge din opgave har du 10 liter appelsindrik, som består af to tredjedele vand (10/3 = 3,33 liter vand). Når du tilsætter dette til 15 liter ananasdrik, der består af tre femtedele vand (15/5 = 3 litre vand), fremstilles der sammenlagt 6,33 liter vand (3,33 + 3 = 6,33). Da du hælder en liter af den orange drik ud, er der derefter 5,33 liter vand tilbage (6,33 - 1 = 5,33).
Response:  If Raymond was born six years before Samantha, and he had a son when he was 23 years old, then his son must have been born 6 + 23 = 29 years ago. Therefore, Samantha is currently 31 - 29 = 2 years older than her cousin Raymond's son.

Allen's age = (Darrell's age x 7) + (Allen's current age x 3)

Using the information given in the problem, Darrell's age is 40, so:

Allen's age = (40 x 7) + (Allen's current age x 3)
= 280 + Allen's current age

Therefore, Allen's age in ten years will be 290."

Response:  If she can run four times faster than she can walk and she can jump with half of her running speed, then we know that she can cover a distance of x miles in y hours if she runs for z/3 hours and walks for (3z-x)/(2y) hours. Solving the equation, we get x = 60 miles and y = 6 hours. Therefore, she can travel 60 miles in 6 hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking.
"Response:  If Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone and Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Suzy's iPhone, then we can set up the following equation:
Ben's iPhone age = 2Suzy's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4Suzy's iPhone age
From here, we know that Suzy's iPhone is one year old, so we can substitute this value into the equations:
Ben's iPhone age = 2(1) = 2 years old
Brandon's iPhone age = 4(1) = 4 years old
Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is eight years old (4 x 2)."
Response:  If Polly holds the precious stone and throws her gold spear from a distance of $x$ feet, she can hit the great dragon with the spear three times as far away from the dragon's fire as she is holding the stone. Therefore, if Polly holds the precious stone at a distance of $y$ feet from the dragon's fire, she can stand at that distance and still hit the dragon with her gold spear three times as far away as she is standing. So, the maximum distance at which Polly can stand and hit the dragon with her gold spear is given by the equation: $$ x = 3y $$

Response:  Ifølge spørgsmålet har Charlie 10 koniske stearinlys pr. kg bivax. Dermed kan han lave 10 x 20 = 200 stearinlys pr. kg bivax.  Om han sælger hvert stearinlys for 2 dollars, vil han have en indtægt på 2 x 200 = 400 dollars pr. kg bivax.  Derfor vil Charlies nettofortjeneste være afhængig af prisene på bivax og stearinlys, men i dette tilfælde ville den blive 400 dollars pr. kg bivax.
"Response:  If we assume that Meredith spent the same amount of time on each article, and that she wrote a total of 7 articles in three days (5 on Monday, 2 on Tuesday), then we can calculate the total number of hours she spent writing as follows:

Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Tuesday: 2 articles x 4 hours per article = 8 hours
Total: 28 hours
Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 28 hours writing articles over the three-day period."
Response:  If the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought is equal to the total number of Post-it notes she has (including the ones she laid out on the cups), then the number of Post-it notes she has left after buying a new pack is equal to the number of Post-it notes she laid out on the cups divided by the number of cups she had. In this case, if we assume that there are 220 different types of cups and each cup holds one Post-it note, then the number of Post-it notes she has left is: Number of Post-it notes she laid out on the cups / Total number of cups = 220/220 = 1. So, she has only one Post-it note left.

"Response:  Det maksimale antal kasser, der kan lastes på lastbilen uden at overskride broens vægtgrænse, er 125 kasser. Dette fremgår af følgende beregninger:
Vægten af en kasse = 5 kg
Antal kasser =? x 5 kg
= 3755 pund / 5 kg
= 751 kassemængde
For at finde det maksimale antal kasser, der kan lastes på lastbilen uden at overskride broens vægtgrænse, dividerer vi mængden af kasser med vægten af en kasse:
751 kassemængde / 5 kg
= 150 kasser
Men vi kan ikke laste mere end 5000 pund på broen, så vi begrænses til at lastinge mindst 125 kasser (5000 pund / 4 kg):
125 kasser
 Derfor kan lastbilen laste op til 125 kasser uden at overskride broens vægtgrænse."

"Response:  If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and receives a yearly pension of $50,000 after 20 years of service, she will receive 5% of her pension value per year after that. So if she stops working after 30 years, her annual pension would be:

$50,000 x (1 + 0.05) ^ 30 = $75,000

Explanation:
We need to calculate the total pension value after 30 years of service. To do this, we multiply the initial pension value by the factor (1 + 0.05)^30, which represents the increase in pension value due to the additional 20 years of service."
"Response:  To calculate the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year, we need to use a combination of mathematical operations. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

Part 1: Calculate the first half of the year's subscription fee (January - June)
Aleena pays $140 per month, so in the first half of the year (January - June), she pays:
$140 x 6 months = $840

Part 2: Calculate the second half of the year's subscription fee (July - December)
Since the streaming service charged 10% less than the previous half, Aleena pays:
$840 x 90% = $756
in the second half of the year (July - December)

Now, let's add up the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year:
$840 + $756 = $1,606

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year is $1,606."
Response:  To find the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gasoline, we need to divide the total distance she has driven (160 km) by the amount of fuel left in her tank (40 liters). This gives us a value of 4 kilometers per liter of gasoline. Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 4 x 160 = 640 kilometers on a full tank of gasoline.

"Response:  Ifølge spørgsmålet har den ene opskrift 20 instruktioner, mens den anden have dobbelt så mange instruktioner som den første. Vi kan derefter beregne, hvordan mange instruktioner Kelian skal læse for at tilberede de to retter.   
1. Den ene opskrift har 20 instruktioner, der er samme antal som det dobbelte af 10 instruktioner.    
2. Derfor behøver Kelian at læse 2 x 10 = 20 instruktioner for at tilberede den ene ret.     
3. Den anden opskrift har dobbelt så mange instruktioner som den ene, dvs. 40 instruktioner (2 x 20).      
4. Derfor behøver Kelian at læse 40 instruktioner for at tilbereme den anden ret.       
Som resultat behøver Kelian i alt at læse 20 + 40 = 60 instruktioner for at tilbereme de to retter."

"Response:  For at finde udregningen af Shielas månedsbetaling, skal vi bruge følgende formula:
Månedsaftalen = (Antal enheder x Pris per enhed) / (1 + Renteprocent x Antal måneder)
Her er de relevante variable og deres værdier:
* Antal enheder = 5 (Shiela har købt 5 mobiltelefoner)
* Pris per enhed = 150 dollar (prisen på én mobiltelefon)
* Renteprocent = 2% (opkrævningsraten for hver enhed)
* Antal måneder = 3 (tiden, Shiela har lejet mobile telefoner i løbet af)
Når vi inputter these values into the formula, får vi:
Månedsaftalen = (5 x 150) / (1 + 0.02 x 3) = $750
Derved betaler Shiela $750 pr. måned i 3 måneder for Mobile telefonene."
Response:  If Artie sælger 12 potter af guldgulve, der er 12 x 2,74 = 32,88 dollars. If he sells 9 potters of petunia, it is 9 x 1,87 = 16,53 dollars. And if he sells 17 potters of begonia, it is 17 x 2,12 = 35,04 dollars. So in total, Artie will earn 32,88 + 16,53 + 35,04 = 84,45 dollars.
Response:  Den gennemsnitlige kvadratmeterareal på et niveau i Sandborgen kan beregnes ud fra de givne informationer. Vi kender halvdelen af det kvadratmeterareal på ét niveau (det øverste niveau), der er 16. Halvdelen af 16 er 8, så det middelbare niveau har en areal på 8. Vi kan derefter beregne gennemsnitlig areal på det fjerde niveau, da vi kender halvdelen af dette niveau (det laveste niveau) og dets areal, der er 2. Gennemsnitlig areal på det fjerde niveau er derfor 2/5 x 16 = 8. Derved findes gennemsnitlig areal på et niveau i Sandborgen til at være 8.
"Response:  For at finde ud af, how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to divide the total amount of dog food she needs by the number of days in that period. According to the problem, Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 2 cups of dog food per day for the first 180 days, which is equal to 365 days (since there are 365 days in a non-leap year). Therefore, the total amount of dog food Cecilia needs in the first year is:

Total amount of dog food = Number of days x Amount of dog food per day
= 365 days x 2 cups/day
= 730 cups
Now, since each bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can see that Cecilia will use:

Number of bags = Total amount of dog food / Amount of dog food per bag
= 730 cups / 110 cups/bag
= 6.6 bags
Therefore, Cecilia will use 6.6 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Response:  If Raymond washes half of Sarah's clothes and Sarah washes four times as much as David, the difference in the amount of laundry they wash is:
Raymond washes 1/2 x 400 = 200 pounds of clothes

Response:  If we know that Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey, then we can use this information to find out how old Jackson is. We can start by using the fact that Amy is five years older than Jackson to find out how old Amy is. Since Amy is 10 years old, and she is five years older than Jackson, then Jackson must be 5 + 10 = 15 years old. Next, we can use the fact that Corey is two years younger than Jackson to find out how old Corey is. Since Corey is 12 years old, and he is two years younger than Jackson, then Jackson must be 12 - 2 = 10 years old. Finally, since James is ten years old and one year younger than Corey, then Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 10 years old.
Response:  For at finde ud af, how fast Gerald kan løbe 400 meter med forhindringer, must vi first find out how much his improved diet has increased his speed. Let's assume that his improved diet increases his speed by x%. Then we can calculate the new time it would take him to run 400 meters with obstacles as follows : Time = Distance / Speed Where distance is 400 meters and speed is the new speed obtained after applying the percentage increase in speed due to the improved diet. So if Lee runs 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, and we want to know how fast Gerald could run the same distance with an improved diet of 10%, we can calculate it as follows : New time = 400 m / (1.10 x original speed) = 400 m / (1.10 x 38 sec) = 45.52 seconds Therefore, based on this calculation, Gerald could potentially run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 45.52 seconds if he had an improved diet of 10%.
Response:  If the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats, and there are 2 cats for every dog, if the number of dogs is 60, then the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 74 (12 + 2 x 60 = 74).

"Response:  For at finde ud af, hvilken del af bogen Solo skal læse på en dag, kan vi bruge følgende formel:

Delingen = (Hele bogen / Antal dage) x (Dags portion / En days læsning)

I dette fall er:

* Hele bogen = 40 sider (fire sider fra naturvidenskaben + 20 sider fra samfundsvidenskabet + 7 sider fra historia + 8 sider fra geografi)
* Antal dage = 4 dage
* Dags portion = 10 sider (Solo læste 15 sider mandag, men han havde fem dage til at læse resten)

Ved at indsætte disse tall i formlen får vi:

Delingen = (40 / 4) x (10 / 5) = 8 sider/dag

Derfor skal Solo læse 8 sider på en dag, hvis han har fire dage til at læse hele bogen."

Response:  If Henry had bagged 15 more kags than he had planned to, and he had thrown away 5 of them, then he must have bagged a total of 110 kags. This means that he had bagged 110 - 5 = 105 kags last year.
Response:  If a local gas station sells gasoline for $3 per gallon and an app firm offers $20 cash back per gallon when filling up at that station, how much money will someone save by using the app after buying 10 gallons of gasoline? To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline without the cash back offer. In this case, the total cost would be: 10 x $3 = $30 So, if someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline and uses the app's cash back offer, they will save $20 (the amount of cash back) on their purchase, resulting in a final cost of $30 - $20 = $10 per gallon.
"Response:  If we assume that both Marcell and Beatrice ate their entire portions of fruit roll-ups, then the number of rolls they ate can be calculated as follows:

For Beatrice: Number of rolls = Total length of Beatrice's portion / Length of one roll
= 24 ruller / 3 ruller
= 8 ruller

For Marcell: Number of rolls = Total length of Marcell's portion / Length of one roll
= 14 ruller / 3 ruller
= 4 ruller

Therefore, if both Marcell and Beatrice ate their entire portions of fruit roll-ups, they would have eaten 8 + 4 = 12 rolls in total."

"Response:  If we know that Jamal's phone can hold six times as many pictures as Britain's phone and that the maximum number of pictures Britain's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks on Jamal's photo of ducks in the zoo, then we can use this information to find out how many ducks are on Jamal's picture of ducks in the zoo. Let's start by using the information given in the problem:

* Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures.
* Britain's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than Jamal's phone, so Britain's phone can hold 9000 pictures (50 x 1800 = 9000).
* The number of ducks on Jamal's photo of ducks in the zoo is equal to the number of pictures he took of them divided by the number of ducks per picture. So if there are x ducks on Jamal's photo, then he took x / 20 pictures of them (since there are 20 ducks per frame).

Now we can set up an equation based on these facts:

x / 20 = 1800 / 9000

Solving for x, we get:

x = 360

So there are 360 ducks on Jamal's picture of ducks in the zoo."
"Response:  If she sells all of the lumber that she has left (ten 2x4s and five 4x4s), she will make a total profit of:

$10 x 10 = $100 from the ten 2x4s
$16 x 5 = $80 from the five 4x4s
Total profit = $100 + $80 = $180
Therefore, she will make a profit of $180 by selling all of her remaining lumber."

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is: 30 / 5 = 6 containers.
"Response:  If we assume that both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by the same percentage over the four-year period, then we can calculate their combined salary as follows:
Adrien's salary 4 years ago = $30,000 (since his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's)
Lylah's salary 4 years ago = $25,000 (based on the assumption that her salary grew at the same rate as Adrien's)
Adrien's salary today = $40,000 (as stated in the problem)
Lylah's salary today =?
To find out how much Lylah earned in the past four years, we need to use the information provided in the problem: ""Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40%, while Lylah's salary had only increased by 10%."" This means that if Adrien's salary increased from $30,000 to $40,000, then Lylah's salary must have increased from a lower amount ($25,000) to an amount greater than $30,000 but less than $40,000. Let's call this new amount x. Then we can write the equation:
$40,000 - $30,000 = 40% of $30,000 + 10% of x
Solving for x, we get:
x = $36,000
So, Lylah's salary today is $36,000."

Response:  If Amy got 20 more friends than Lily after moving to a new school, then Lily had x friends before the move. Since Amy now has 20 + x friends, we can set up the equation: Amy's number of friends = Lily's number of friends + 20. Solving for x, we get: x = 30. So Lily had 30 friends and Amy has 50 friends.
"Response:  If a water melon costs three times as much as a pepper and an apple costs $5 less than a water melon, then the total cost of buying four water melons, twenty peppers, and ten apples is:

3 x ($15/pepper) = $45
+ 20 x ($10/pepper) = $200
- $5 x ($15/apple) = $75
= $325

Therefore, Dillon will have to pay $325 in total to buy four water melons, twenty peppers, and ten apples."
"Response:  If the hospital sees 500 patients per day, and each patient is seen on average for 24 minutes, then the total time spent by doctors at the hospital is:

Time spent by doctors = Number of patients x Average time per patient
= 500 x 24
= 12,000 minutes

Since doctors take $150 per hour from the hospital, the amount earned by the hospital per day is:

Amount earned by hospital = Time spent by doctors x Rate per hour
= 12,000 x $150
= $180,000

Similarly, since the hospital takes $200 per hour from patients, the amount paid by patients per day is:

Amount paid by patients = Time spent by patients x Rate per hour
= 500 x $200
= $100,000

Therefore, the total revenue generated by the hospital per day is:

Total revenue = Amount earned by hospital + Amount paid by patients
= $180,000 + $100,000
= $280,000"
Response:  If the 60 seasonal workers are divided into thirds, then each group of 20 workers will have 30 children throwing snowballs at them and 10 children kicking them.

Response:  If Lucas has three clients that each require two bottles of bleach solution and one package of laundry detergent per week, and he estimates that each client will pay him $20 per week for these products, then his total revenue from these clients will be $60 per week ($2 x 3 clients = $6). Additionally, if he has five potential clients who are interested in using his services but have not yet committed to doing so, and he estimates that each of these clients will also pay him $20 per week for the same products, then his total projected revenue for the coming week will be $120 ($60 from existing clients + $60 from potential clients = $120). Therefore, his profit for the coming week will be $60 ($120 - $60 = $60).

Response:  If Johnny has collected all the Legos on the floor, he has collected a total of 3 x 500 = 1500 blocks + 1/4 x 1500 = 375 blocks = 1875 blocks.
Response:  Let's call the number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours x. Since half of them returned in the next 6 hours, the number of bees that returned is equal to half of x, or x/2. Now, since double the number of bees flew away and didn't return, the total number of bees that flew away is twice x, or 2x. Therefore, the number of bees that came back to the hive in the last 6 hours is equal to the difference between the total number of bees that flew away (2x) and the number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours (x): 2x - x = x. So there were x bees that came back to the hive in the last 6 hours.

Response:  For at finde ud af, hvordan lang tid det vil tage til Tim skal køre hjemmefra, behøves vi at konkludere med, hvilken hastighed Tim har på sit skateboard. Vi ved, at Steve kan cykle 440 fod i minuttet, og derfor kan vi beregne Tims hastighed på skateboard som 264/4 = 65,5 fod i minuttet. Når vi nu kender distancen mellem Tim og huset (to miles), kan vi beregne tidspunktene, da Tim ankommer hjemmefra. Her er resultatet: Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 65,5 fod i minuttet = 31,4 minutter. Derved vil vinderen af løbet, Steve, ventyr hjemme hos dem, før Tim afslutter løbet i 31,4 minutter.

Explanation:

The problem states that Dave bought a large bag of French fries and ate 14 before a hungry seagull stole the bag from his hand. The seagull ate half of the remaining fries, and three ducks forced him away from the food. A washbowl bird then took two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving five.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fries were in the original bag. We know that Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the bag, so there must have been 14 x 2 = 28 fries left in the bag after Dave ate his share. Then, the seagull ate half of the remaining fries, which is equal to 28 / 2 = 14 fries. Finally, the three ducks ate three fries each, which means they ate a total of 3 x 3 = 9 fries. Therefore, there were 28 - 14 - 9 = 5 fries left in the bag when the washbowl bird stole it. So, there were originally 5 x 14 = 70 fries in the bag."

Ligesom kan vi konkludere, at Locsin fangede 5 mindre søstjerner. Dette betyder, at Locsin fangede 5 x 10 = 50 søstjerner i alt. Som derfor kan de to personer fange sammenlagt 65 søstjerner (15 + 50).
Response:  If a bag of marble cost $20 initially, and the price increased by 20% every month, how much would it cost after 36 months? To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P x (1 + r)^n, where A is the future value of the investment, P is the initial principal, r is the annual rate of interest, and n is the number of years. In this case, we know that the initial price of the marble was $20, so P = $20. We also know that the price increases by 20% each month, which means that the annual rate of interest is 20%. Finally, we want to find out how much the marble will cost after 36 months, so n = 36. Using these values, we can plug them into the formula above to get: A = $20 x (1 + 0.20)^36 = $48. So after 36 months, one bag of marble would cost $48.

"Response:  The combined age of the four birds is 156 years. Explanation: Let's analyze each bird's age based on the information given in the problem:

* Sally 1 is 3 years old.
* Sally 2 is 3 times older than Sally 1, which means Sally 2 is 9 years old (3 x 3 = 9).
* Grandma Red is twice as old as Sally 2, which means Grandma Red is 18 years old (2 x 9 = 18).
* Sally 4 is 32 - 8 = 24 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all the birds to find their combined age:

Sally 1: 3 years
Sally 2: 9 years
Grandma Red: 18 years
Sally 4: 24 years
Combined age of the four birds: 3 + 9 + 18 + 24 = 156 years."
"Response:  For at finder ud af, hvor meget Jessica skal betale i et år, kan vi bruge følgende formula:

Total amount = Minimum payment x Number of payments per year

In this case, the total amount that Jessica needs to pay in a year is:

Total amount = $300 x 12 + $200 x 12 + $500 x 12
Total amount = $4800 + $2400 + $6000
Total amount = $12,400

So, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment each month, she will need to pay $12,400 in a year."

Therefore, the loser received 23 votes."
Response:  In order to determine how many red roses Fred should deliver by 17:00, we need to divide the total number of red roses requested (4 times as many as white lilies) by the time remaining until delivery (in this case, 5 hours). Therefore, Fred should deliver 4/5 = 0.8 or 80% of the total number of red roses requested by 17:00.
Response:  Jean er 32 år gammel.
Response:  If the first team's runners ran in a time of 55 seconds each for their 400 meters, then the total time for that team would be: 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 260 seconds or 4 minutes 0 seconds. The second team's runners, on the other hand, had a total time of: 60 + 58 + 56 + 54 = 278 seconds or 4 minutes 18 seconds. Therefore, the faster team will win by 18 seconds (278 - 260).
"Response:  Ifølge binomialt distributionstabelen, kan vi finde sandsynlighden for, at Jerry kaster ét eller flere tal i træk, udtrykt som en funktion af det antal mulige tal og den gennemsnitlige værdi af de kastede tal.

For eksempel, hvis Jerry kaster en sekssidig terning med en gennemsnitlig værdi på 5, har han følgende sandsynlighed til at kaste ét eller flere tal i træk:

Sandsynlighedstal = (6-1)! / (6! x (5-1))!
= (5!) / (6! x (4))!
= 0,2787

Dvs., sandsynligheden for at Jerry kaster ét eller flere tal i træk er cirka 27,87%.

Hvis vi nu vil beregne sandsynligheden for at Jerry kaster et tal der er større end 3, kan vi bruge samme metode men med en mindre værdi for gennemsnitlig værdi. For eksempel, hvis Jerry kaster en sekssidig terning med en gennemsnitlig værdi på 4, har han følgende sandsynlighed til at kaste ét eller flere tal i træk:

Sandsynlighedstal = (6-1)! / (6! x (4-1))!
= (5!) / (6! x (3))!
= 0,3495

Dvs., sandsynligheden for at Jerry kaster et tal der er større end 3 er cirka 34,95%."
Response:  If Jenna plucked half as many apples as her mother, then she plucked $\frac{1}{2}$ of the total number of apples. Since her mother had 20 apples, Jenna plucked $\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10$ apples.
"Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* There are 3 groups of rats (called ""bur"") with an equal number of rats in each group.
* Each rat has 6 pieces of hay.
* There are 10 individual cages for hamsters, and each hamster has 5 pieces of hay.
* There is a separate area for chickens, where they receive 20 pieces of hay.
* No other animals in the shop use strands.

Now, let's calculate how many rats there are in each bur:

Group 1: 3 bur x 8 rats/bur = 24 rats
Group 2: 3 bur x 8 rats/bur = 24 rats
Group 3: 3 bur x 8 rats/bur = 24 rats

So, there are 24 rats in each group. Now, let's find out how many rats there are in total:

Total number of rats = Number of groups x Number of rats in each group
= 3 x 24 rats/group
= 72 rats

Therefore, there are 72 rats in the shop."
"Response:  If Mandy can pay after three months, she should give Benedict $98. Here's how we calculate it:

1. Calculate the total amount owed by Mandy to Benedict: $100 x 3 = $300
2. Calculate the monthly interest rate: $300 / 3 = $100
3. Calculate the amount Mandy should pay after three months: $300 - ($100 x 3) = $200
4. Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $98 ($200 - $100)."

Response:  Ifald Baldur får 5 spande vand hver morgen og 6 spande vand hver aftermiddag, vil han i alt få 5 + 6 = 11 spande vand om dagen. Om vi antager at hvert spand indeholder 5 liter vand, vil Baldur derfor modtage 11 x 5 = 55 liter vand om dagen.
"Response:  If he won the prize on January 1st of a year where he earned $2000 per week and received a one-time award of $5000 plus a 5% salary increase, then he would have made a total of $25,500 that year. Here's how we can calculate it:

* First, let's find out how much he earned in a year:
	+ Total weeks worked in a year = 52 weeks (assuming a standard workweek)
	+ Total earnings for the year = $2000 x 52 weeks = $104,000
* Now, let's add the one-time award to his annual earnings:
	+ One-time award = $5000
	+ New total earnings = $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000
* Finally, let's apply the 5% salary increase to his new total earnings:
	+ Salary increase = 5% of $109,000 = $5450
	+ New total earnings after salary increase = $109,000 + $5450 = $114,450

So, if he won the prize on January 1st of a year where he earned $2000 per week and received a one-time award of $5000 plus a 5% salary increase, then he would have made a total of $114,450 that year."

* Han spiste 3 dage om ugen æg omeletter, der havde 1 skip ost pr. omelet. Dermed brugte han 3 x 1 = 3 skiver ost på æg omeletterne.
* Han lavede en stor tallerken makaroner og ost, der havde 8 skiver ost.

Total: 10 + 3 + 8 = 21 skiver ost brugte Carls i løbet af denne uge."
Response:  Ifølge spørgsmålet, havde Janet 22 grønne og 10 gule kuglepenne. Dermed har hun i alt 32 kuglepenne. Når hun køber seks poser med blå kuglepenne, får hun i alt 6 x 7 = 42 blå kuglepenne. Og når hun køber to poser med røde kuglepenne, får hun i alt 2 x 6 = 12 røde kuglepenne. I alt har Janet dermed 32 + 42 + 12 = 86 kuglepenne.
Response:  If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, she will have a total score of 455 (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86). To find her average score for the six tests, we need to subtract the lowest score from the total score: 455 - 71 = 384. So, if Brinley gets a score of 86 on the sixth test, her overall average will be 384.
Response:  If Michael kørte 5 gange om ugen med en længde på 25 km hver gang, havde han til sammen 125 km (5 x 25). Om han derefter besluttede at cykle kun to gange om ugen, men med en længde på 60 km hver gang, havde han til sammen 120 km (2 x 60). I alt havde Michael dermed kørte 245 km (125 + 120) i fire uger.

Antal kopper = 25
Pris på ét stykke = $ 1200
Pris på ét stykke = $ 6000 (halvdelen af tallerkener)
For at beregne omkostningen på én kop, kan vi bruge følgende formula:
Omkostning = Antal kopper x Pris på ét stykke
Omkostning = 25 x $ 1200 = $ 30000
Derved er den samlede omkostning på 30.000 dollars for 25 kopper."

Response:  For at finde ud af, hvor mange timer Lori skal arbejde, before she can buy the shoes and belt, we need to calculate how much money she will have after working for a certain number of hours. Let's assume that Lori works for 4 hours per day (since she has a part-time job). If she works for 4 days in a week (Monday through Thursday), then she will work a total of 16 hours per week ($8/hour x 4 hours/day x 4 days/week = $128/week). To find out how many weeks it will take her to save enough money to buy the shoes and belt, we can divide the cost of the items by her weekly income: $320 / $128/week = 2.5 weeks. Therefore, Lori will need to work for 2.5 weeks to save enough money to buy the shoes and belt.

Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces in a minute and her mother can add half as many pieces in a minute, then the number of minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle can be calculated as follows: Time = (Number of pieces / Number of pieces added per minute) x 60 Where: - Number of pieces is the total number of pieces in the puzzle, which we are given as 360 pieces. - Number of pieces added per minute is the average number of pieces that Kalinda's mother can add in a minute, which we are given as half of Kalinda's rate of 4 pieces/minute. Therefore, the time it will take for Kalinda and her mother to complete the puzzle is: Time = (360 / 2) x 60 = 180 minutes or 3 hours.
Response:  If a farm produced 120 baby watermelons and after two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest, then 30/100 = 0.3 x 120 = 36 melons were ready to be harvested. When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so 75/100 = 0.75 x 36 = 27 melons were not yet ready to be harvested. Therefore, there were 36 - 27 = 9 melons that were not yet ready to be harvested after two weeks.
Response:  Alt, som mark betaler for alle bilerne, er: 20 x 20.000 = 400.000 dollars + (10/100) x 400.000 = 40.000 dollars + 1000 x 12 = 12.000 dollars = 520.000 dollars.

Response:  If he buys 25 kugle pens and uses them to make new kugle pens when the ink runs out, where will he get a total of 12.5 kugle pens. This is because each time he mixes 5 empty pens together, he creates one full pen. So, if he has 25 kugle pens, he can create 5 x 5 = 25 new pens by mixing the empty ones. Therefore, his total number of kugle pens will be 25 + 25 = 50 kugle pens.
Response:  If Johnny had $20 in his pocket and added $10 more, he would have a total of $30. After one year, the money tripled to $90. Therefore, Johnny had $90 after one year.
"Response:  If we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and that Joan is five years older than Jessa, then we can use the information to find the total age of the three girls. Let's start by using the information about Mary and Joan:
Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is x - 2 years old.
Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is x + 5 years old.
Now, let's substitute these values into the equation:
x - 2 = x + 5
Solving for x, we get:
3 = x
So, Mary is 3 years old, Joan is 8 years old (since she is 5 years older than Jessa), and Jessa is 17 years old (since she is 20 years old minus the ages of the other two girls). Therefore, the sum of their ages is 3 + 8 + 17 = 38 years old."
"Response:  To calculate the number of students who left through exit C, we need to use a combination of the given information. Let's break it down step by step:

1. 30% of students left through exit A, so 30% of 1000 = 300 students left through exit A.
2. 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., 700 - 300) left through exit B, so 3/5 x 700 = 420 students left through exit B.
3. Therefore, the total number of students who left through exits A and B is 300 + 420 = 720 students.
4. Since the question asks for the number of students who left through exit C, we can subtract the number of students who left through exits A and B from the total number of students: 1000 - 720 = 280 students left through exit C.

Therefore, the answer is 280 students left through exit C."

Desuden har Jason haft 300 ekstra minutters samtale, der er 300 minutter. Alt i alt har Jason brugt 750 minutter (1000 - 450 - 300) på telefonsamtaler denne måned. Hvis denne måned har 30 dage, vil Jason have tilbage 2250 minutter (750 x 30).
Response:  If Griffin had 27 pommes frites and Ginger gave him a handful of hers, then he would have 27 - 5 = 22 pommes frites left. Since Colby took 3 less than the number of pommes frites that Kyle took, Colby took 3 x 5 = 15 pommes frites. So in total, there are 22 + 15 = 37 pommes frites left for Griffin.
"Response:  Let's assume that the number of fish in each aquarium is x. Since there are twice as many snails in one aquarium as in the other, we can write:

Number of snails in first aquarium = 2x
Number of snails in second aquarium = x

We know that the total number of snails in both aquariums is 40 (since there are 4 snails in the first aquarium and 32 snails in the second aquarium). So we can set up the equation:

2x + x = 40

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3x = 40

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 13

So there are 13 fish in each aquarium."
Response:  For at finde ud af hvor meget Jean betaler, behøves vi at kende antallet af timer, der kræves til at lave makeuppen, og prisen per time. Vi kan også benytte sig af, at Jean får 10% rabat, da dette givet som information i spørgsmålet.  Antallet af timer, der kræves til at lave makeuppen, kan vi findes ved at multiplere antallet af dage (4) med antallet af timer per dag ($250 x 6 timer/dag = $1500). Dette gives derefter som en bruttobeløb, som derefter subtraheres med den rabat, Jean får ($1500 - $150 = $1350).  Derved betales Jean $1350 i timen.
