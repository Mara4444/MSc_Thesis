"Response:  
Janet sells eggs at $2 per dozen (12 eggs). 
She has 16 eggs left after breakfast and baking muffins for her friends. 
So she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left to sell. 
Since she sells them at $2 per dozen, she earns: 
13 x $2 = $26 per day from selling eggs at the farmer's market."
Response:  We know that n clothing item takes 2 blue beads and half as many white beads. So if we let n = 5, then 2 x 5 = 10 blue beads and (1/2) x 5 = 2 white beads. In total, 10 + 2 = 12 beads are needed for one clothing item.
"Response:  If Josh buys a house for $80,000 and spends $50,000 on repairs, that means he has invested a total of $130,000 ($80,000 + $50,000) in the house.
If the value of the house increases by 150%, then the new value of the house would be:
New Value = Old Value x 1.5
= $80,000 x 1.5
= $120,000
So, if Josh sells the house for $120,000, he will have made a profit of:
Profit = New Value - Old Value
= $120,000 - $80,000
= $40,000
Therefore, Josh has made a profit of $40,000 or 50% return on his investment of $80,000."
"Response:  We know that James runs three times a week and each time he runs three sprints of 60 meters each. So, if we multiply 3 (the number of times he runs) by 3 (the number of sprints he does each time), we get:

3 x 3 = 9

So, James runs for a total distance of 9 x 60 = 540 meters per week."
"Response:  We know that Wendi gives her chickens three portions of mixed chicken feed per day, which contains grains, worms, and vegetables to keep them healthy. She gives each chicken 15 pieces of food in the morning and 25 pieces in the afternoon. To determine how many pieces she should give them at their last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total number of chickens she has. According to the problem statement, Wendi has 20 chickens. Therefore, the total number of chickens she needs to feed is:

20 chickens x 3 meals/day = 60 chickens/day

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of food she needs to provide for all three meals:

60 chickens x 15 pieces/meal (morning) = 900 pieces (morning)
60 chickens x 25 pieces/meal (afternoon) = 1500 pieces (afternoon)

To find out how many pieces she should give them at their last meal of the day, we add up the total number of pieces from both meals:

900 + 1500 = 2400 pieces

Therefore, Wendi should give her chickens 2400 pieces of food at their last meal of the day."
"Response:  We know that each glass costs $5, but if Kylar buys two or more glasses, he will get a discount of 60%. So, if he buys 2 glasses, he will pay (2 x $5) = $10, which is 60% of the original price of $16. Therefore, the cost of 16 glasses for Kylar would be:

$16 / 0.6 (discount rate) = $26.67

So, Kylar should expect to pay $26.67 for 16 glasses."
"Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So if we can find out how many sheep Toulouse has, we can use that information to determine how many sheep Seattle has. Here's a equation based on the given information:
Toulouse = 2 x Charleston
Charleston = 4 x Seattle
We can start with the first equation:
Toulouse = 2 x Charleston
Toulouse = 2 x (4 x Seattle)
Toulouse = 8 x Seattle
Now we have found out that Toulouse has 8 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, if Seattle has 20 sheep, Toulouse would have 160 sheep (20 x 8).
So the number of sheep in each city is:
Seattle - 20
Toulouse - 160
Charleston -?
To find out how many sheep Charleston has, we can use the second equation:
Charleston = 4 x Seattle
Charleston = 4 x 20
Charleston = 80
Therefore, the number of sheep in each city is:
Seattle - 20
Toulouse - 160
Charleston - 80"
"Response:  We know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute normally, but 40% of the time is spent on updating Windows, which takes 20 minutes. So we need to calculate how much time she spends downloading and then add it up.

Time spent downloading = (1 - 0.4) x 60 minutes = 36 minutes

Therefore, the total time taken to download 200 GB = 36 minutes x 2 GB/minute = 720 GB

So, it will take Carla approximately 720 GB to download the entire file."
Response:  We know that John starts driving at 100 km/h and drives for 3 hours (which means he covers a distance of 3 x 100 = 300 km). Then, he slows down to 30 mph for another half hour (covering a distance of 0.5 x 30 = 15 km). Finally, he speeds up again to 80 mph for the remaining time (covering a distance of 4 - 3.5 = 0.5 x 80 = 40 km). So, the total distance traveled by John is: 300 + 15 + 40 = 355 km.
"Response:  We know that Eliza works for 45 hours this week and her regular hourly wage is $10. She also receives an overtime payment of 1.2 times her regular hourly wage for all hours worked beyond 40 hours per week. So, we can calculate her total earnings as follows:

Overtime pay = (Number of hours worked beyond 40) x Overtime rate
= (45 - 40) x 1.2
= 5 x 1.2
= 6

Total earnings = Regular hourly wage + Overtime pay
= $10 + $6
= $16

Therefore, Eliza's income for this week is $16."
Response:  We know that the number of downloads in the first month was 60. In the second month, there were three times as many downloads as in the first month, so the number of downloads in the second month is 60 x 3 = 180. Finally, we are told that there was a 30% decrease in downloads in the third month compared to the previous month, so the number of downloads in the third month is 180 - (180 x 30%) = 180 - 54 = 126. Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.
"Response:  We know that Toula bought three dozen donuts at $68 each, two dozen mini-cookies at $80 each, and six dozen mini-cheese cookies for $55 each. So we need to calculate the total cost of all these items first. 
First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 
$68 x 3 = $204  Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini-cookies: 
$80 x 2 = $160 Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini-cheese cookies: 
$55 x 6 = $330 Now add up all these costs: 
$204 + $160 + $330 = $794 Therefore, the total cost is $794."
"Response:  We know that the cost of planting the tree is $90 and each year it will produce 7 lemons at $1.5 per lemon, so the total revenue for one year is:

Revenue = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5

We also know that the annual maintenance cost is $3, so the net profit for one year is:

Net Profit = Revenue - Maintenance Cost = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take for the tree to start making a profit. To do this, we can use the formula:

Years to Break Even = Total Investment / Annual Net Profit

In this case, the total investment is $90 (the cost of planting the tree) and the annual net profit is $7.5. So, we can calculate the number of years as follows:

Years to Break Even = $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the tree to start making a profit."
Response:  We know that Melanie sold one third of her stock of sofas at the green house, two thirds at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. So let's start with how many sofas she had in total. If she sold one third of them, then she must have had three times as many sofas before she started selling. Therefore, Melanie had 3 x 5 = 15 sofas to begin with.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 students in total and 25% of them have signed up for jazz dance, which is equal to 5 students (20 x 0.25). So, if we subtract the number of students who signed up for jazz dance from the total number of students, we get the number of students who did not sign up for jazz dance.

Number of students who did not sign up for jazz dance = Total number of students - Number of students who signed up for jazz dance
= 20 - 5
= 15

Now, we know that 20% of the remaining students signed up for contemporary dance, which is equal to 3 students (15 x 0.2). Therefore, the number of students who signed up for hip-hop dance is the difference between the total number of students and the sum of the number of students who signed up for contemporary dance and jazz dance.

Number of students who signed up for hip-hop dance = Total number of students - (Number of students who signed up for contemporary dance + Number of students who signed up for jazz dance)
= 20 - (3 + 5)
= 20 - 8
= 12

So, 12 out of 20 students (or 60%) signed up for hip-hop dance."
"Response:  We have two options with different values and estimated percentage changes in their prices at the end of the month. Option A is jewelry worth R5,000, which might decrease by 2.5%. Option B is an electronic device worth R8,000, which might decrease by 1.2%. To calculate the potential win for each option, we need to know how much they will be worth after the price change. First, let's calculate the new value of each option based on the estimated percentage change:  
Option A (jewelry): R5,000 x (1 - 0.025) = R4,750  
Option B (electronic device): R8,000 x (1 - 0.012) = R7,360 Now that we have the new values, we can compare them to determine which option has the higher potential win:  
Option A (R4,750) < Option B (R7,360) So, based on these calculations, it seems that choosing option B (the electronic device) would result in a higher potential win at the end of the month. However, this decision should also consider other factors such as personal preferences, risk tolerance, and any additional costs or fees associated with either option."
"Response:  We know that each train travels for two days and covers a certain distance. On the first day, Train A travels westward for 80 miles, while Train B travels northward for 240 kilometers. To find the total distance traveled by both trains over the two days, we need to add their individual distances. So, the total distance traveled by Train A over the two days is:

80 miles + (240 km x 1.60934 km/mile) = 80 miles + 385.734 miles = 465.734 miles

Similarly, the total distance traveled by Train B over the two days is:

240 km + (80 miles x 1.60934 km/mile) = 240 km + 128.734 km = 368.734 km

Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains over the two days is:

465.734 miles + 368.734 km = 834.468 miles or 1.344 kilometers."
"Response:  We know that Jill earns $20 per hour for teaching and $30 per hour for cheerleading coaching. She works 50 weeks per year, so let's break it down into hours worked per week:

Teaching hours per week = 35 hours/week (as an underwriter) x 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Cheerleading coaching hours per week = 15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Now, let's calculate her total annual salary:
Total annual salary = Teaching hours x Teaching rate + Cheerleading coaching hours x Coaching rate
= 1750 hours x $20/hour + 750 hours x $30/hour
= $35,000 + $22,500
= $57,500 per year"
Response:  If Claire makes 3 eggs omelets every weekend and there are 4 weeks in a month, then she will make a total of 3 x 4 = 12 omelets per month. Since each omelet requires 3 eggs, Claire will consume 12 x 3 = 36 eggs per month.
Response:  We know that Marissa takes 1 hour to cover the first 4 miles and then another hour to cover the next 2 miles. So, in total, she spends 2 hours to cover 6 miles. Now, we want to find out her average speed for the entire distance of 12 miles. To do this, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles, and the time taken is 2 hours. Therefore, her average speed would be: Average Speed = 12 miles / 2 hours = 6 miles/hour.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of lemon juice that is 2/3 water and we add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is 3/4 water. First, let's calculate how much water there is in the lemon juice:

10 liters x 2/3 = 6.67 liters (water)

Now, let's calculate how much water there is in the pineapple juice:

15 liters x 3/4 = 12 liters (water)

Next, let's add the amount of water from the lemon juice to the pineapple juice:

6.67 + 12 = 18.67 liters (water)

So, there will be approximately 18.67 liters of water in the final mixture of 24 liters."
"Response:  We know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha and he had his son when he was 23 years old. So, we can start by calculating how many years ago Raymond had his son.

Raymond's age now = Samantha's current age + 6 (since Raymond is 6 years older)
Samantha's current age = 31 years

So, Raymond's current age = 31 + 6 = 37 years

Now, we need to calculate how many years ago Raymond had his son.

Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth = 23 years (he was 23 years old when he had his son)

Subtracting Raymond's current age from his age at the time of his son's birth gives us the number of years since Raymond had his son.

23 - 37 = -14 (negative 14)

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago."
"Response:  We know that Billy has 8 clients and we are told how many DVDs each client bought. So let's create a table to organize this information:

| Client | Number of DVDs Bought |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | 1 |
| 2nd | 2 |
| 3rd | 1 |
| 4th | 2 |
| 5th | - |
| 6th | - |
| 7th | - |
| 8th | - |

Now, let's analyze the table:

* The first three clients (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) bought one DVD each. So, together they bought 3 DVDs.
* The fourth and fifth clients (4th and 5th) bought two DVDs each. So, together they bought 4 DVDs.
* The last three clients (6th, 7th, and 8th) did not buy any DVDs.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is:
3 + 4 = 7

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
Response:  We know that each hour the candle burned for 2 centimeters (2 cm). So if it burned from 13:00 to 17:00, it burned for 4 hours (17:00 - 13:00 = 4 hours). Therefore, the total distance traveled by the flame is 4 x 2 = 8 cm.
"Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a 25% discount from the original price. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

$19.50 = (Original Price) x (1 - Discount Percentage)

where Original Price is the cost of the book before any discounts and Discount Percentage is the percentage reduction in the price. In this case, the discount percentage is 25%.

So we can solve for the original price as follows:

$19.50 = (Original Price) x (1 - 0.25)

$19.50 = Original Price x 0.75

Now divide both sides by 0.75 to find the original price:

Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75

Original Price = $26.00

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00, and Kyle received a 25% discount."
"Response:  We know that Marie paid a total of $50.50 for her groceries and she bought 5 packs of milk at $3 each, which is $3 x 5 = $15. She also bought 4 apples at $1.50 each, which is $1.50 x 4 = $6. So far, we have:

$50.50 - $15 - $6 =?

Now, let's find out how much Marie spent on pizza. We know that each box costs $8.50, so if Marie bought ""a few"" boxes, we can estimate the cost based on the number of boxes she bought. Let's assume she bought 3 boxes of pizza (since there are 3 boxes in $8.50).

So, the total cost of pizza would be:

3 x $8.50 = $25.50

Adding up all the costs, we get:

$50.50 - $15 - $6 + $25.50 =?

Solving for the unknown value, we get:

$50.50 - $15 - $6 + $25.50 = $59

Therefore, Marie bought 3 boxes of pizza."
"Response:  We know that Mishka bought three pairs of shorts, three pairs of pants, and three pairs of shoes. So we can start by adding up how much each item costs:

* Shorts: 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
* Pants: 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
* Shoes: 3 x $42 = $126

Adding all these amounts together gives us a total cost of:

$49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

So Mishka spent $243 on clothes."
"Response:  We know that Cynthia buys cardboard boxes with 15 portions of rooms each at a cost of $4 per box. To find out how much she will spend on rooms after 60 days, we need to calculate how many boxes she will buy in 60 days and then multiply it by the cost of one box. 
Firstly, let's convert 60 days into weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:
60 days = 60 x 7 = 420 days
Now, we can calculate how many boxes Cynthia will buy in 420 days:
420 days / 30 days per month (assuming there are 30 days in every month) = 14 months
Since Cynthia buys 15 portions of rooms per box, we can calculate the total number of rooms she will buy in 14 months as follows:
14 months x 15 rooms per month = 190 rooms
Finally, we can calculate the total amount Cynthia will spend on rooms after 60 days as follows:
190 rooms x $4 per room = $760
Therefore, Cynthia will spend $760 on rooms after 60 days."
"Response:  We know that Henry stopped twice during his bike ride of 60 miles. His first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. To find out how far he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance from his first stop from the total distance he traveled. So, we can set up an equation like this:

Total distance = Distance from first stop + Distance from second stop

We know that the distance from his first stop is 20 miles, and the distance from his second stop is 15 miles (since it's 15 miles before the end of the trip). So, we can substitute those values into our equation:

Total distance = 20 + 15

Solving for the total distance, we get:

Total distance = 35 miles

Now, we want to find out how far Henry traveled between his first and second stops. To do this, we can subtract the distance from his first stop from the total distance:

Distance between first and second stops = Total distance - Distance from first stop
= 35 - 20
= 15 miles

Therefore, Henry traveled 15 miles between his first and second stops."
"Response:  We know that two pairs of shoes cost $33, and each pair of shoes costs twice as much as one pair of heels. So if we let x be the cost of one pair of heels, then the cost of two pairs of shoes would be 2x. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 2x = 33... (1)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x = 33... (2)

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 8... (3)

So, the cost of one pair of heels is $8."
"Response:  We know that Darrel is 7 years older than Allen, so we can write an equation based on this information:
Darrel's age = Allen's age + 7
We also know that their total age together is 162 years old:
Darrel's age + Allen's age = 162... (1)
Now, we want to find out Allen's age over ten years from now. So, we need to solve for Allen's age in equation (1):
Allen's age + 10 =?
Substituting equation (1) into this new equation, we get:
(Allen's age + 7) + 10 = 162
Combine like terms:
Allen's age + 17 = 162
Subtract 7 from both sides:
Allen's age = 155
Therefore, Allen's age over ten years from now will be 155 years old."
"Response:  We have three friends who give their estimates of how much jelly beans are in the jar. The first one says there are 80 jelly beans, the second one says there are 20 more than half of the first one's estimate, and the third one says there are 25% more than the first one's estimate. So we can start by finding out what the first one's estimate means. If the first one says there are 80 jelly beans, then there must be 40 jelly beans if we take half of it (since ""more"" means adding to the number). Now let's see what the other two friends say:

The second friend says there are 20 more than half of the first one's estimate, which means they add 20 + 40 = 60 jelly beans to the first one's estimate. And the third friend says there are 25% more than the first one's estimate, which means they add (1.25 x 80) = 100 jelly beans to the first one's estimate. Therefore, the total estimated amount of jelly beans in the jar is:

60 + 100 = 160 jelly beans.

So the average estimation of the three friends is 160 / 3 = 53.33 jelly beans per jar."
Response:  We know that there are 10 dogs and each dog spends 5 hours per day for exercise and socialization. So, in one day, John spends 5 x 10 = 50 hours on dog care. Since there are 7 days in a week, John spends 50 x 7 = 350 hours per week on dog care.
"Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So if we let G represent the number of silver coins, then we can write an equation based on this information:
G + 30 = 110... (1)
Now we need to find out how many gold coins Gretchen has. To do this, we can subtract G from both sides of equation (1):
G + 30 - G = 110 - G... (2)
Simplifying equation (2), we get:
2G = 80... (3)
Dividing both sides of equation (3) by 2 gives us:
G = 40... (4)
So Gretchen has 40 gold coins."
Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So if Raymond has 40 jewels, then half of his jewels are 40/2 = 20. Therefore, Aaron has 5 + 20 = 25 jewels. Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.
Response:  If Mike makes 4 points in the first 20 minutes, then he makes a total of 4 + (20/60) \* 4 = 4 + 10 = 14 points in the first 40 minutes. Since he makes 25% more points in the second 20 minutes, he will make 14 + (20/60) \* (14 \* 125%) = 14 + 35 = 49 points in the entire game.
"Response:  We know that Terry buys two yogurts per day at $5 each, so he spends $10 per day on yogurt. To find out how much he will spend over 30 days, we can multiply $10 by 30, which gives us:

$10 x 30 = $300

So Terry will spend $300 on yogurt over 30 days."
Response:  We know that John had 13 Lego sets and he sold each one for $15. That means he made a total of 13 x $15 = $195 from selling his Lego sets. He then spent $20 x 8 = $160 on video games. So, how much money does John have left? $195 - $160 = $35. Therefore, John has $35 left after buying video games with the money he made from selling his Lego sets.
"Response:  We know that John runs for three days a week, and each day he runs for half as much time as the first day. So if he runs for 3 hours on the first day, he runs for 1.5 hours (half of 3) on the other two days. Therefore, his total weekly running distance is:

3 hours x 3 days = 9 hours

Since he runs for 1.5 hours on the other two days, his total weekly running distance is:

9 hours + (1.5 hours x 2 days) = 9 hours + 3 hours = 12 hours

So John runs for 12 hours per week."
Response:  We know that Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, so if she walks at a speed of x miles per hour, she runs at a speed of 4x miles per hour. Also, we know that she can jump to half of her running speed, so if she is running at a speed of 4x miles per hour, she jumps at a speed of 2x miles per hour. Now, let's consider the time it takes for Dana to travel a certain distance. If she walks for t hours, she covers a distance of x miles (since she walks at a speed of x miles per hour). If she runs for t/4 hours, she covers a distance of 4x miles (since she runs at a speed of 4x miles per hour). And if she jumps for t/2 hours, she covers a distance of 2x miles (since she jumps at a speed of 2x miles per hour). So, the total distance traveled by Dana in s hours is given by: Distance = x + 4x + 2x = 7x miles Since Dana wants to travel 3my in six hours, we have: 3my = 7x miles / 6 hours Therefore, the value of x is: x = 3my / 7 = 3 \* 10^3 / 7 = 428.57 miles per hour Now, we need to find out how far Dana can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. Let's say she spends t/3 hours running and t/2 hours walking, where t is the total time spent. Then, the distance traveled while running is: Distance = 4x * t/3 = 4x * (t/3) miles The distance traveled while walking is: Distance = x * t/2 = x * (t/2) miles Total distance traveled = Distance while running + Distance while walking = 4x * (t/3) + x * (t/2) = 4xt/3 + xt/2 miles Since Dana wants to travel 3my in six hours, we have: 3my = 4xt/3 +
Response:  We know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone, and Suzy's iPhone is one year old. So, Ben's iPhone is two years old. Now we need to find out how many times older Brandon's iPhone is compared to Ben's iPhone. According to the problem, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, if Ben's iPhone is two years old, then Brandon's iPhone would be eight years old (2 x 4 = 8).
Response:  We know that without the sapphire stone, Polly can throw the golden spear up to 120 meters. With the sapphire stone, she can throw it three times farther than before, which is 360 meters (3 x 120). So with the sapphire stone, Polly can throw the golden spear up to 360 meters. Now we need to find out how far she can stand from the dragon and still hit it with the thrown spear. Since the dragon's flames have a range of 300 meters, we must ensure that Polly stands at least 300 meters away from the dragon to avoid being burned. Therefore, the distance between Polly and the dragon should be at least 300 + 360 = 660 meters.
"Response:  We know that there were 5 apple tarts for the fireman's afternoon tea. Each tart was cut into 8 pieces, so there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple tart in total. At the end of the day, after the guests had taken their share and eaten it, there were 40 - (number of pieces taken by the guests) = 40 - x pieces of apple tart left. Since there were 14 leftover pieces of apple tart, we can set up the equation:

40 - x = 14

Solving for x, we get:

x = 26

So, the number of pieces taken by each guest was 26."
"Response:  We know that one serving of Skyfies contains 250 calories and there are five servings in 300 grams. So, to calculate how much you can eat if your daily calorie intake is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to subtract the amount of calories you have already consumed from your daily calorie intake.

First, let's convert 1800 calories to grams:

1800 calories x 1 calorie/gram = 1800 grams

Now, let's subtract the amount of calories you have already consumed (1800 grams) from your daily calorie intake (2000 calories):

2000 - 1800 = 200 grams

Therefore, you can eat 200 grams of Skyfies today without exceeding your daily calorie intake."
"Response:  We know that Charlie can make 10 candy canes for every pound of peppermint he buys. He pays $10 per pound and sells each candy cane for $2. So if he makes 20 candy canes, how much will he earn in total? 
First, let's calculate how much money Charlie spends on peppermint: 
20 candy canes x 10 candies per pound = 200 candies 
$10 per pound x 2 pounds (he needs 2 pounds to make 200 candies) = $20 
So Charlie spends $20 on peppermint. Now, let's calculate how much money he earns from selling the candy canes: 
200 candies x $2 per candy cane = $400 
Charlie earns $400 from selling the candy canes. But he spent $20 on peppermint, so his net profit is: 
$400 - $20 = $380 
Therefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candy canes is $380."
"Response:  We know that on Monday, she wrote 5 articles and each article took her 4 hours to research and write. So, on Monday, she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote (2/5) x 5 = 6 additional articles. Each article took her 4 hours to write, so she spent 6 x 4 = 24 hours writing articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday, which means she wrote 2 x 24 = 48 hours writing articles.
In total, she spent 20 + 24 + 48 = 92 hours writing articles during those three days."
"Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse before she went to work at the coffee shop. She placed one note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. That means she used 220 x 1 = 220 Post-it notes. Since she bought a pack of Post-it notes with 23 pieces, we can calculate how many packets she needed as follows: 

220 / 23 = 9 (integer)

So, Candice needed 9 packets of Post-it notes."
"Response:  We know that John buys twice as much red fabric as blue fabric, and the red fabric costs 50% more than the blue fabric. So if he bought x units of blue fabric at $40 each, he must have bought 2x units of red fabric. The total cost of all the fabric is $200, so we can set up an equation:

2x + x = 200... (1)

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 200... (2)

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 66.67... (3)

So John has spent $66.67 on blue fabric and $133.33 on red fabric for a total of $200."
"Response:  We know that Tracy has a piece of string that is one meter long and it is cut into pieces of 15 cm each. To find out how many pieces she has, we can divide the length of the string by the length of each piece:

1 m / 0.15 m = 6.67 (approximately)

So Tracy has approximately 6.67 pieces of string."
Response:  We know that there are 15 floors (verdiepings) and each floor contains 8 units. So, we can start by multiplying 15 x 8 = 120. Now, we need to subtract the number of occupied units, which is 3/4 of the total number of units. To find 3/4 of 120, we can multiply 120 x 3/4 = 90. Therefore, the total number of vacant units in the building is 120 - 90 = 30.
"Response:  We know that Lloyd has an egg farm and produces 252 eggs per day. He sells each dozen eggs for $2. To find out how much he earns per week, we need to first calculate his daily income.

Daily Income = Number of Eggs Sold x Price Per Dozen
= 252 eggs/day x $2/dozen
= $504/day

Now, let's convert this to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:

Weekly Income = Daily Income x Number of Days in a Week
= $504/day x 7 days/week
= $3,528/week

Therefore, Lloyd earns $3,528 per week from his egg sales."
"Response:  We know that Tom travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour and he takes 3 hours to return (16:00 - 13:00 = 3 hours). So, we can calculate his distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 10 mi/h x 3 h
= 30 miles

Therefore, it will take Tom 30 miles to return home."
"Response:  We know that Uria has to remove 15 pounds from his bag, and he has two types of items in his bag - strokesprites and playthings. The stroke sprites weigh one quarter of a pound each, and the playthings weigh half a pound each. So if Uria removes 30 stroke sprites, how many playthings must he remove to make up for the remaining weight?

Let X be the number of playthings Uria needs to remove. Since each plaything weighs half a pound, X = (15 lbs - 30/4 lbs) / (1/2 lb). Simplifying this equation, we get X = 15 lbs - 30/4 lbs = 15 lbs - 7.5 lbs = 7.5 lbs. Therefore, Uria needs to remove 7.5 pounds of playthings to meet the requirement of removing 15 pounds from his bag."
"Response:  We know that the technician earns $60 for each vagmotor band and $40 for each motor band. On Thursday, they repaired 6 vagmotor bands and 4 motor bands, so their total income for Thursday is:

$60 x 6 = $360 (for vagmotor bands) + $40 x 4 = $160 (for motor bands) = $520

On Friday, they repaired 12 motor reeks, but did not repair any vagmotor bands, so their total income for Friday is:

$40 x 12 = $480 (for motor reeks) = $520 (total income for both days)

So, the technician earned an additional $520 - $520 = $0 on Friday."
"Response:  We know that Patchy adopted three times as many kittens as there are currently, and Trixie had 12 kittens. So if we add up all these numbers, we get:
3 x (current number of kittens) + 12 = total number of kittens
We don't know the current number of kittens yet, but we can set it equal to ""x"" for now.
So the equation becomes:
3x + 12 = total number of kittens
Now we need to find out what the total number of kittens is. To do this, we can solve for ""x"":
3x + 12 = total number of kittens
Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us:
3x = total number of kittens - 12
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
x = total number of kittens / 3
Since we know that there are 7 kittens in total, we can substitute this value into the equation:
x = 7 / 3
Solving for ""x"", we get:
x = 2
Therefore, the Doubtfire family has 2 x 3 = 6 kittens in total."
Response:  If Jean has 30 sugarcane sticks and she eats 2 of them, then she is left with 28 sugarcane sticks. Now, if she wants to pack two sugarcane sticks in each bag, she can make 28 bags (since there are 28 sugarcane sticks left).
"Response:  We know that Peter has $42 for the week and he spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn each time he goes to the movies. To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide $42 by $14 (the total cost of a ticket and popcorn). So... 
$42 ÷ $14 =?
We can simplify this division problem by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.
$42 ÷ $14 = ($42 ÷ 2) × ($14 ÷ 2)
= $21 × $7
= $147
So, Peter can go to the movies 147 / 7 = 20 times this week!"
"Response:  We know that the maximum weight of the bridge is 5000 pounds (2268 kg), and each box weighs 15 pounds (6.8 kg). So the total weight of all the boxes must be less than or equal to 5000 pounds. The number of boxes that can fit on the truck is limited by the weight of the driver and the empty trailer, which together weigh 3755 pounds (1704 kg). Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is:  
5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds (565 kg) / 15 pounds per box = 83 boxes."
Response:  We know that Stephen had an installment sale for his herbs with a final balance of $40.00. The salesperson added a commission of 25% of the final balance, which is $10 (25% x $40). So, Stephen paid a total of $50 ($40 + $10) to the salesperson. Then, he also paid an additional fee of $4. Therefore, the final price of Stephen's herbs after all the extra fees and commissions is: $50 + $4 = $54.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 groups of 20 fruits each and 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the forest. To find out how many fruits there are in total, we need to add up all these numbers. So, let's do it!

Group 1: 20 x 1 = 20
Group 2: 20 x 2 = 40
...
Group n-1: 20 x (n-1) = 20(n-1)
Total group fruit count: 20 + 40 +... + 20(n-1) = 20 + 40 +... + 20(n-1)

Individual fruits: 67

Therefore, the total number of fruits in the forest is:
20 + 40 +... + 20(n-1) + 67 = 20 + 40 +... + 20(n-1) + 67

So, the total number of fruits in the forest is 20 + 40 +... + 20(n-1) + 67 = 20 + 40 +... + 20(n-1) + 67."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 lemons in total and we have to find out how many of them are good. So, let's start by identifying the number of bad ones first.
We know that 1 lemon is sour, so that's one bad lemon. And we also know that 20% of the lemons are unripe, which means 20/100 = 0.2 x 25 = 5 lemons are unripe. Therefore, the total number of bad lemons is 1 + 5 = 6.
Now, we need to subtract the bad lemons from the total number of lemons to get the number of good lemons. So, 25 - 6 = 19.
Therefore, there are 19 good lemons!"
Response:  We know that Janet paid $500 for the materials and $800 to the jeweler to make the necklace. So, in total she spent $500 + $800 = $1300. Then, we know that she also paid 10% of that amount as insurance, which is 10% of $1300 = $130. Therefore, the final amount that Janet paid is $1300 + $130 = $1430.
"Response:  We know that Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000 and it increases by 5% every year. If she retires after 30 years, her annual pension will be:

Yearly Pension = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^30
= $50,000 x 1.35^30
= $50,000 x 279.68
= $139,840 per year

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years would be $139,840."
Response:  We know that the initial amount paid by Aleena for the first half of the year was $140 x 6 = $840. And we also know that she was charged 10% less for the second half of the year, so the amount paid for the second half would be $840 x 0.9 = $756. Therefore, the total amount paid by Aleena for the entire year is $840 + $756 = $1,596.
"Response:  We know that Sophia has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up and she needs to refill with 4 liters of fuel. According to the user manual, her tank can hold 12 liters of fuel. So, if we subtract the amount of fuel she already used (4 liters) from the total capacity of her tank (12 liters), we get:

12 liters - 4 liters = 8 liters

Now, we need to calculate how far Sophia can travel with this remaining amount of fuel. To do so, we divide the number of liters left in her tank by the mileage per liter of her vehicle:

8 liters / 30 miles/liter = 267 miles

Therefore, Sophia can travel approximately 267 miles on one tank of fuel."
Response:  We know that Jim watches TV for two hours each time he does it, and he does it three times a week. So, he spends 2 x 3 = 6 hours watching TV per week. Since there are four weeks in the period, Jim spends a total of 6 x 4 = 24 hours watching TV over those four weeks.
"Response:  We know that each school has four teams (one for boys and one for girls) with five players each, so we can start by calculating how many players are involved in total:

4 schools x 2 teams per school (boys and girls) = 8 teams
8 teams x 5 players per team = 40 players
So there are 40 players in total."
Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, if we subtract 35 from 175, we get 140 rubies. Now, we are told that there were twice as many emeralds as rubies. Therefore, if we multiply 140 by 2, we get 280 emeralds. Finally, we know that there were 2 times as many sapphires as emeralds. So, if we multiply 280 by 2 again, we get 560 sapphires. In total, there were 560 sapphires, 280 emeralds, 140 rubies, and 175 diamonds at the funeral.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. So if there are 60 girls, there must be 120 boys (since twice 60 is 120). And since each class has 5 students, we need 5 x 120 = 600 teachers to teach all the classes.
"Response:  We know that Bailey received $5 per week for 8 weeks, so she received a total of:

$5 x 8 = $40

In addition to this amount, Bailey had some initial money, which is represented by the variable ""begin."" So, in total, Bailey had:

$40 + begin

We want to find out how much money Bailey had at the beginning. To do this, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

begin + $40 = $100

Solving for ""begin,"" we get:

begin = $60

Therefore, Bailey had $60 at the beginning."
Response:  We know that Judy teaches five classes per week (Monday to Friday), and each class has 15 students. So, she teaches 5 x 15 = 75 students per week. If each student pays $15, then Judy earns 75 x $15 = $1,125 per week.
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, then the second recipe will have 2 x 20 = 40 instructions. Therefore, to prepare both dishes, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.
"Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each slice of cake for $4, then he will have:

* 43 brownies x $3 = $130
* 23 slices of cake x $4 = $92

Total amount earned: $130 + $92 = $222."
Response:  We know that Sheila bought five smartphones for $150 each and paid three months in advance. So she paid $150 x 5 = $750 upfront. Now we need to calculate how much she will pay monthly for three months. To do this, we can use the formula for calculating the monthly payment of an installment loan: Monthly Payment = (Loan Amount / Number of Payments) x Interest Rate per Period. In this case, the Loan Amount is $750 since it's an advance payment, and the Number of Payments is 3 months. The Interest Rate per Period is 2%/month. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: Monthly Payment = ($750 / 3) x 2% = $250 x 2% = $50. Therefore, Sheila will pay $50 per month for three months.
"Response:  We know that Artie has 12 pots of gold blooms, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias to sell. He sells each type of flower at different prices: $2.74 for gold blooms, $1.87 for petunias, and $2.12 for begonias. To find out how much he will earn in total, we need to multiply the number of pots of each type of flower by its price. So, for gold blooms: 12 x $2.74 = $33.08; for petunias: 9 x $1.87 = $16.83; and for begonias: 17 x $2.12 = $35.04. Add up these amounts to get the total amount Artie will earn today: $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.04 = $85.05."
"Response:  We know that each flat of a sandcastle has half of the area of the square below it. So if we have four flats and the largest flat has an area of 16 square meters, then the total area of all four flats will be:

Area = (4 x 0.5) x 16 = 8 x 16 = 128 square meters

Now, since each flat has half of the area of the square below it, we can find the area of one flat by dividing the total area by the number of flats:

Area of one flat = Total area / Number of flats
= 128 / 4
= 32 square meters

So, the average area of one flat is 32 square meters."
"Response:  We know that Cecilia needs to give her new puppy 1 cup of milk per day for the first 180 days, and then 2 cups per day for the rest of its life. Since there are 110 cups in a bag, we can calculate how many bags she will use during the first year as follows:

For the first 180 days:
1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups

Since there are 110 cups in a bag, Cecilia will need:
180 cups / 110 cups/bag = 1.67 bags (approximately)

For the rest of the dog's life (let's assume it lives for 10 years):
2 cups/day x 365 days/year x 10 years = 7300 cups

Again, since there are 110 cups in a bag, Cecilia will need:
7300 cups / 110 cups/bag = approximately 66.36 bags over 10 years."
"Response:  We know that Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then:

Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry (since he does half as much as Sarah)
David does 100 pounds of laundry (since he does one-fourth as much as Sarah)

So the difference between Raymond and David is:

200 - 100 = 100 pounds

Therefore, Raymond does 100 pounds more laundry than David."
"Response:  We know that Vincent can buy three flowers for $2.50 or two flowers for $1.50. So we need to find out how much he would spend if he buys 18 flowers at the better price. If he buys three flowers for $2.50 each time, he will spend:

3 x $2.50 = $7.50

If he buys two flowers for $1.50 each time, he will spend:

2 x $1.50 = $3.00

Since $7.50 is more than $3.00, it is better for him to buy three flowers at a time. Therefore, the cost of 18 flowers at the better price is:

3 x $2.50 = $7.50"
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of the grooming without any discounts. We know that the cost of the grooming at Honde Versorging is $100. Next, we need to calculate the amount of the discount offered by the spa. The question states that there is a 30% discount for new customers. To find out how much the discount will be, we can multiply the original price by 30%. So, the discount would be:

$100 x 30% = $30

Now, let's subtract the discount from the original price to get the final cost with the discount:

$100 - $30 = $70

So, the final cost of the grooming for John will be $70."
Response:  We know that each of the two girls has 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 24 / 6 = 4 liters. So together they have 4 + 4 = 8 liters of water. When the boy arrives and gets 6 liters of water, we add 6 to 8 to get a total of 14 liters of water. Therefore, there are 14 liters of water in all.
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 stickers and she bought 21 at the store. So, she has a total of 21 + 10 = 31 stickers. Then, we are told that she gave 9 to her sister, so she has 31 - 9 = 22 stickers left. Finally, we know that she used 28 stickers to decorate a birthday card, so she has 22 - 28 = 4 stickers left. Therefore, Charlie has 4 stickers left over.
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs 2 pounds less than Grace. So, Alex weighs 125 - 2 = 123 pounds. Now, we need to find their total weight. Total weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight Total weight = 125 + 123 = 248 pounds
"Response:  We know that each rosebush has 25 roses and each rose has 8 droppings. So if we multiply 25 (roses per bush) x 8 (droppings per rose), we get:

25 x 8 = 200 droppings per bush

Since there are three rosebushes, we can multiply the number of droppings per bush by 3 to find the total number of droppings:

200 x 3 = 600 droppings in total"
"Response:  We know that the soccer team played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost. So if they lost x games, they won x + 8 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22...(1)

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 8 = 22...(2)

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2x = 14...(3)

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 7...(4)

So the soccer team lost 7 games."
"Response:  We know that Gene has been going on vacation for four times a year since he was 23 years old, which means he has been on vacation for 11 years (23 + 11 = 34). And each time he goes on vacation, he buys a new set of bedding. So, if we multiply the number of years he has been on vacation by the number of sets of bedding he buys per year, we get:

11 years x 4 sets/year = 44 sets of bedding

Therefore, Gene has collected a total of 44 sets of bedding over the past 11 years."
"Response:  We know that the first time the alarm went off, it beeped four times. The second time it went off, it beeped three times as long as the first time. The third time it went off, it beeped half as long as the second time. So let's start with the total number of beeps for all three times:
4 + 3 + (1/2) × 3 = 4 + 3 + 1.5 = 8.5
Therefore, the alarm beeped 8.5 times in total."
"Response:  If Sylvie has been working for five years at the company and her annual salary increases by 10% of her initial salary each year, we can calculate her future salaries as follows:
Year 1 (current): $600 x 1.10 = $660
Year 2: $660 x 1.10 = $734
Year 3: $734 x 1.10 = $819
Year 4: $819 x 1.10 = $913
Year 5: $913 x 1.10 = $1,017
Therefore, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary would be $1,017."
"Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harald. So if Marilyn sold x records, Harald sold 10x records. We also know that the total number of records sold is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Marilyn's sales + Harald's sales = Total Sales (88,000)

Since Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harald, we can write:

10x + x = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:

11x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 records."
Response:  We know that Christina has 16 friends and she needs to prepare 75 gift bags for them. Since one-quarter of her guests won't show up, she only needs to prepare 75% of the total number of gift bags. That means she needs to prepare 75 x 0.75 = 56 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so she will need to spend $56 x 2 = $112 in total.
"Response:  We know that each adult will eat 10 pounds of apple salad and each child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 5 pounds. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, in total they will eat:

20 x 10 = 200 pounds of apple salad (for adults) +
5 x 5 = 25 pounds of apple salad (for children) = 225 pounds of apple salad

Therefore, Ted should bring 225 pounds of apple salad to the picnic to ensure enough for everyone."
"Response:  We know that Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. So if we let x be the number of pets Cindy has, then Marcia has x + 2 pets, and Jan has 3(x + 2) pets.

We are also given that Cindy has four pets, so x = 4. Therefore, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets, and Jan has 3(4 + 2) = 12 pets."
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So we can start with those two pieces of information to figure out how old Amy is. 
Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so if Jackson is x years old, then Amy is x + 5 years old. 
Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey, so if Corey is y years old, then Amy is y - 2 years old. 
We are also given that James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey. So we can set up an equation using these three pieces of information:
x + 5 = y - 2 + 10
Now solve for x.
First, let's combine like terms:
x + 5 + 10 = y - 2
16 = y - 2
Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:
14 = y
Now we can substitute y into our first equation:
x + 5 = y - 2 + 10
x + 5 = 14 + 10
x + 5 = 24
Solving for x, we get:
x = 19
So Jackson is 19 years old."
"Response:  We know that Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and Gerald can run it in 38 seconds with a 10% improvement in speed due to his diet change. So we need to find out how much faster Gerald is now compared to Lee.

Let X be the time taken by Gerald to complete the 400-meter hurdles before changing his diet. Then,

X + 10% = 38 (since Gerald improved by 10%)

Solve for X:

X = 38 / 1.10 = 34.54

So, Gerald used to take 34.54 seconds to complete the 400-meter hurdles before changing his diet. Now, he has improved by 10%, which means he can complete the race in:

34.54 x 1.10 = 37.92 seconds

Therefore, Gerald can now complete the 400-meter hurdles in 37.92 seconds after changing his diet."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer pet dogs than the total number of pets (dogs and cats). If there are two cats for each dog, then the number of cats is twice the number of dogs. So if there are x dogs, there will be 2x cats. Since there are 60 dogs, we can set up an equation:

Let X = Number of dogs

X + 12 = Total number of pets (dogs and cats)

2X = Number of cats

Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:

2X + 12 = Total number of pets

Solving for X, we have:

2X = 60

X = 30

So there are 30 dogs in the neighborhood.

Now, since there are two cats for each dog, there are:

2X = 2(30) = 60 cats in the neighborhood."
Response:  We know that there are 200 students in total and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is 2 x 200 / 5 = 40. Now we know that 2/3 of the remaining students (i.e., girls) are in the girl scouts. So, the number of girls not in the girl scouts is 200 - (2/3 x 200) = 200 - 133 = 67. Therefore, there are 67 girls who are not in the girl scouts.
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept. So we can start by finding out how many hours James slept.  
We know that 2/3 of 9 is equal to 6, so James slept for 6 hours. Now we need to find out how much more Harry slept than James.  
To do this, we subtract the amount of time that James slept from the amount of time that Harry slept:  
9 - 6 = 3  
So Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"Response:  We know that each package of tamatoes contains three tamatoes and that Freda lost half of her volume when she cooked them. So if we divide the amount of tamatoes used (32 ounces) by the number of tamatoes per pack (three), we can find out how many packages Freda used:

32 ounces / 3 tamatoes/package = 10 packages
Therefore, Freda used 10 packages of tamatoes."
"Response:  We know that there are originally 30 motorcycles on the highway and 5 of them take an exit, leaving 25 motorcycles remaining. Now, we need to find out how many motorcycles pass through the traffic light during the first 15 minutes.

We can start by dividing the total number of motorcycles (25) into two groups: those that pass through the traffic light within the first 15 minutes and those that pass through in the last 15 minutes.

Let x be the number of motorcycles that pass through the traffic light within the first 15 minutes. Then, we have:

x + 20 = 25 (since 20 motorcycles pass through in the last 15 minutes)

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 5/2

Therefore, 5 motorcycles pass through the traffic light within the first 15 minutes."
Response:  If Maria has 18 new potted plants and she already has 2 plants on each of her 40 window sills, then she currently has 2 x 40 = 80 plants in total. Now, if she wants to give one plant to each of her friends and family members, we can calculate how many plants she will have left after giving away some of them. To do this, let's subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has: 80 - (x) = 80 - (18) = 62 plants. Therefore, Maria will have 62 plants left after giving away 18 plants to her friends and family members.
"Response:  We know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome answered. The second friend pressed it quarter (1/4) more than the first friend, so they pressed it 5 times (20 x 1/4). The third friend pressed it ten times more than the fourth friend, so they pressed it 60 + 10 = 70 times. Therefore, the total number of presses on the doorbell is:

20 + 5 + 70 = 95"
"Response:  We know that Solo has to read 
     - 4 pages from his Science Handbook 
     - 20 pages from his Social Studies Handbook 
     - 7 pages from his History Handbook 
     - 8 pages from his Geography Handbook 
     - and he has already read 15 pages on Monday. 
To find out how many pages he needs to read per day, we need to add up all these numbers: 
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages 
So, Solo needs to read an average of 39 pages per day to finish all his reading work within 4 days."
"Response:  We know that John drinks one glass of water before breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day (3 times). In addition to this, he also has one glass of water before going to sleep at night (1 time). Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks per week is:

3 x 7 = 21

So, John drinks 21 glasses of water per week."
"Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city and there are 42 miles from the seafront to the inland border of the city. So we can calculate how long it will take for the missile to cover the entire city as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is 42 miles (68 km), and the speed is 3 miles per 10 minutes (or 3 x 600 feet/minute).

Now let's convert the units of distance and time to make the calculation easier:

Distance = 42 miles x 5,280 feet/mile = 220,960 feet
Time = 220,960 feet / 3 x 600 feet/minute = 736 minutes

Therefore, it would take approximately 736 minutes (or 12 hours) for the missile to cover the entire city."
"Response:  If Poppy has placed a quarter of the pieces on the board and her mother has placed a third of the remaining pieces, we can start by finding out how many pieces are left to be placed.

Let x be the number of pieces that Poppy has placed on the board (since she has placed a quarter of the total pieces). Then, the number of pieces her mother has placed is:

3/4 \* 1000 = 750

So, the total number of pieces that have been placed so far is:

x + 750 = 1000

Now, we need to find out how many more pieces need to be placed. To do this, we subtract the total number of pieces that have been placed from the original number of pieces:

1000 - (x + 750) =?

Simplifying the equation:

1000 - (x + 750) = 1000 - 750

= 250

Therefore, there are still 250 pieces left to be placed on the board."
Response:  We know that Cody eats three times as much cookies as Amir. So if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody will eat 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. Therefore, together they will eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.
"Response:  We know that each box has dimensions of 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches and we also know that the walls are 1 inch thick. So first let's calculate the total area of one box:

Area = Length x Width x Height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 square inches

Now, since there are three boxes, we need to multiply the total area of one box by 3 to get the total area of all three boxes:

Total Area = 120 x 3 = 360 square inches

Next, we need to calculate the volume of one box by multiplying the length, width, and height:

Volume = Length x Width x Height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches

Again, since there are three boxes, we need to multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total volume of all three boxes:

Total Volume = 120 x 3 = 360 cubic inches

So the total volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic inches."
"Response:  We know that Frankie watches TV for 7 hours each day (2 hours in the morning and 5 hours in the evening). On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one hour long episodes of his favorite show after finishing his homework. On Wednesday, he watches two 30-minute programs after doing his homework early. On Thursday, he watches one hour long episode and one 30-minute program before going to bed early. On Friday, he watches two one-hour long programs. So, let's calculate how many 30-minute programs he watched on Wednesday:

Wednesday:

* He watches 2 x 30 minutes = 1 hour of TV

So, he watched 1 hour of 30-minute programs on Wednesday."
Response:  We know that Henry made twice as many cookies last year as he did this year. So if he made x cookies last year, then he made 2x cookies this year. Also, we know that he had 15 more cookies than he intended to make this year. So if he intended to make y cookies, then he actually made y + 15 cookies. Finally, we know that he left 5 cookies out to cool and ended up with a total of 110 cookies. Can you use these clues to figure out how many cookies Henry made last year?
"Response:  If someone buys 10 liters of gas at $3.00 per gallon and gets $0.20 back per gallon through the app company's offer, how much will they pay for gas after the rebate? First, let's calculate the cost of 10 liters of gas without the rebate: 
10 liters x $3.00/gallon = $30.00 
Now, let's subtract the amount they get back from the total cost to find out how much they actually pay: 
$30.00 - $0.20/gallon x 10 gallons = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00 
Therefore, after applying the rebate, the customer pays $28.00 for 10 liters of gas."
Response:  We know that both Marcel and Beatrice have eaten their entire portion of rolllets (i.e., they did not leave any uneaten). We also know that Marcel's portion had 3 rows of rolllets and Beatrice's portion had 2 rows. Since each row contains an equal number of rolllets, we can assume that each row contained 14 rolllets for Marcel and 24 rolllets for Beatrice. Therefore, Marcel ate 3 x 14 = 42 rolllets in total, while Beatrice ate 2 x 24 = 48 rolllets in total. To find out how much they ate on average, we need to divide the total number of rolllets they ate by the number of people who ate them: (42 + 48) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45 rolllets per person, on average.
Response:  We know that the boat traveled at a speed of 20 feet per 16 seconds (we can convert this to minutes if we want). So, in one minute, the boat would travel 20 x 60 = 1200 feet. Now, we need to find out how much water the boat took up during this time. We know that the boat takes up 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it travels (this is given in the problem statement). So, if the boat traveled for 1 minute, it would take up 1200 / 10 = 120 liters of water. Therefore, the amount of water the boat took up during the time Julia reached the shore is 120 liters.
Response:  We know that there are four teachers who use the whiteboard alternately and each teacher has two lessons per day. So, in total, there will be eight lessons per day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/teacher). Now, we need to find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in one day. Since the whiteboard is cleaned three times during each lesson, the total number of times it is cleaned in a day can be calculated as follows: 8 lessons/day x 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings/day.
"Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers per day and it takes 15 days for them to grow, then he has planted a total of:

2 x 15 = 30 flowers

So, after 15 days, Ryan will have 30 flowers that have not grown yet."
Response:  We know that Jamal can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany. So if Brittany can hold 50 times more photos than the number of birds in her photo, then Jamal can hold 6 x 50 = 300 times more photos than the number of birds in his photo. Now we are given that Jamal has 1800 photos and we need to find out how many birds can be seen in one of his photos. To do this, we will divide 1800 by 300: 1800 / 300 = 6. Therefore, six birds can be seen in one of Jamal's photos.
"Response:  We know that Sasha has ten 2x4x10 planks and five 4x4x10 boards. The total cost of these materials is:

Ten 2x4x10 planks x $10 per plank = $100
Five 4x4x10 boards x $16 per board = $80
Total cost = $180

Now, let's find out how much profit Sasha will make if she sells all the materials. To do this, we need to subtract the total cost from the price at which she bought the materials:

Profit = Price - Cost
= $180 - $180
= $0

So, Sasha will not make any profit if she sells all the materials at the prices she paid for them."
"Response:  We know that Katy used 120 tea spoons of sugar and 7 cups of water. To find out how many tea spoons of sugar she used, we can divide the number of cups of water by the ratio of sugar to water (which is 13:7). So, we have:

120 / 13 = x

where x is the number of tea spoons of sugar.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

Therefore, Katy used 9 tea spoons of sugar."
"Response:  If John buys three pairs of shoes for each of his children and each pair costs $60, then he will pay:
3 x $60 = $180 per child
Since he has three children, he will pay in total:
$180 x 3 = $540
Therefore, John will pay $540 for all six pairs of shoes."
"Response:  We know that on the first day, there were 2 hours of deliveries, and each delivery had 5 vehicles. So, in total, there were 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles delivered on the first day. On the second day, we are told that there were more deliveries, and the total number of vehicles at the harbor increased to 30. If all the deliveries contained 5 vehicles each, then the number of deliveries on the second day would be:  
30 - 10 = 20 deliveries on the second day."
"Response:  We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000 and it increased by 40%. So, his current salary would be:

$40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000

Now, we need to find out how much Lylah earned four years ago. We know that her salary is 30% higher than Adrien's salary four years ago. So, we can calculate her salary four years ago as follows:

$40,000 x 1.3 = $52,000

Now, let's add their current salaries:

$56,000 + $52,000 = $108,000

Therefore, the total salary they will receive four years later is $108,000."
Response:  We know that Miguel uses two sheets of paper per week and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, he uses 2 x 4 = 8 sheets of paper per month. Now, we know that there are 30 sheets of paper on a ream of paper, so Miguel uses 8/30 = 1/4 of a ream of paper per month.
Response:  We know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 lemons, while Kael brought twice as many apples and half as many lemons as Morisette. So we can start by finding out how many apples Kael brought. Since Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Now let's find out how many lemons Kael brought. Since Kael brought half as many lemons as Morisette, Kael brought ½ x 8 = 4 lemons. In total, then, Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 pieces of fruit (apples and lemons), while Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 pieces of fruit.
"Response:  We know that Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday and then 2 hours less each day for the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday). So, she slept for:

Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday: 6 hours (2 hours less than Monday)
Wednesday: 4 hours (2 hours less than Tuesday)

Now, let's add up the total number of hours Sadie slept for the entire week:

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 hours

Therefore, Sadie slept for a total of 18 hours during the week."
"Response:  We know that Rosie can run for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour and then she runs for another 2 hours at 5 miles per hour. So we need to calculate how far she can go in each of those periods first.

For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour, so she covers:

10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, for the last 2 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour, so she covers:

5 miles/hour x 2 hours = 10 miles

Adding both distances gives us the total distance Rosie can cover in 7 hours:

30 miles + 10 miles = 40 miles"
Response:  We know that there are 60 letters in total and 30 of them have already been stamped. So, we can start with the remaining 30 letters that haven't been stamped yet. Since Jennie has to sort the letters into three piles, each pile will contain 10 letters (1/3 of 30). Therefore, Jennie had 30 - 10 = 20 letters left to sort at first.
"Response:  We know that Julia bought a new set of skewers and her husband also gave her 5 new spatulas as a gift. She used 3 of the spatulas to cook her braai Stoff. So, if she had 12 spatulas at the table, how many were in the original package that she bought?

Let X be the number of spatulas in the original package. Since she used 3, we know that X - 3 = 12 (the number of spatulas at the table).

Solving for X, we get:
X = 12 + 3 = 15

So there were 15 spatulas in the original package that Julia bought."
Response:  We know that Dylan has bought 38 chicken sausage and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, if we let C be the number of chicken sausages, then Dylan has also bought 6 + C = 6 + 38 = 44 sausages in total.
"Response:  If Amy has 20 more friends than Lily and Lily has 50 friends, then we can set up an equation to represent this information. 
Let A be the number of friends Amy has and L be the number of friends Lily has. Since Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, we know that A = L + 20. 
Now, we are given that Lily has 50 friends, so we can write an equation for the total number of friends that both girls have: 
A + L = (L + 20) + 50 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
2A + 20 = 50 + L 
Solving for A, we get: 
A = 25 
So, Amy has 25 friends and Lily has 50 - 20 = 30 friends. Together, they have 25 + 30 = 55 friends."
"Response:  We know that a watermelon costs three times as much as each pepper, and an orange costs five less than a watermelon. So if we want to find out how much Dillon will spend on watermelons, oranges, and peppers, we need to first calculate the cost of one watermelon and then use that information to determine the cost of the other two items.

Let's start with the cost of one watermelon. Since it costs three times as much as each pepper, we can set up the following equation:

Watermelon = 3 x Pepper

Now we know that an orange costs five less than a watermelon, so we can set up another equation:

Orange = Watermelon - 5

Finally, we know that Dillon wants to buy four watermelons, twenty peppers, and ten oranges. So we can use these equations to calculate the total amount he will spend:

Total Cost = 4 x (3 x Pepper) + 20 x Pepper + 10 x (Watermelon - 5)

Substituting the values we have found, we get:

Total Cost = 4 x 3 x Pepper + 20 x Pepper + 10 x (3 x Pepper - 5)
= 12 x Pepper + 20 x Pepper + 10 x 3 x Pepper - 10 x 5
= 36 x Pepper + 20 x Pepper - 50
= 56 x Pepper

So the total amount Dillon will spend on watermelons, oranges, and peppers is $56 x 15$, which equals $840."
"Response:  We know that there are 500 patients seen daily and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. The doctors earn $150 per hour and the hospital earns $200 per hour from the patients. So we can calculate the total amount earned by the hospital as follows:

Total Amount Earned = Number of Patients x Average Time Spent per Patient x Doctor's Fee per Hour x Hospital's Fee per Hour
= 500 x 24 x $150 x $200
= $36,000 per day

Therefore, the hospital makes $36,000 per day from these visits."
Response:  We know that there are 60 seasonal workers and 3/4 of them stop working after children start crying (i.e., 3 x 60 = 180). Then, 10 more workers stop working after their shoes are stolen (i.e., 10). So, the total number of workers who stopped working is 180 + 10 = 190. Therefore, there are 60 - 190 = 41 workers left.
"Response:  We know that Joseph's expenses for May were $500 and his expenses for June were $60 less than that. So we can start by finding out how much he spent in June. 
$500 - $60 = $440 (June expenses)
Now we add both months' expenses to find the total:
$500 + $440 = $940 (total expenses for two months)"
Response:  We know that Pam and Fred went to the mountain twice each, so they have taken 2 x 2 = 4 rides on the mountain. Then, they decided to take two more rides each, so we add another 2 for both of them: 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 rides in total. Since each ride costs 6 cards, they have used a total of 8 x 6 = 48 cards that day.
"Response:  We know that Walt ran 4 miles on Monday and 6 times more on Tuesday than he did on Monday. So, if Walt ran x miles on Monday, then he ran 6x miles on Tuesday. Since his total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can set up an equation:

4 + 6x = 41

Solving for x, we get:

6x = 37

x = 6

So, Walt ran 6 miles on Monday and 6 x 6 = 36 miles on Tuesday. Therefore, Walt ran a total of 36 + 6 = 42 miles from Monday to Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Tom washes his car four times a month, and each wash costs $15. So, if we multiply the number of washes by the cost of each wash, we get:
4 washes/month x $15/wash = $60/month
Now, let's calculate the total amount Tom pays for washing his car in a year:
$60/month x 12 months = $720/year
So, Tom pays $720 per year to wash his car."
Response:  If Brian has 20 video games and loses 5 before the comparison, then he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. Since Bobby has 5 times fewer video games than Brian, Bobby has 5 x (15 - 5) = 5 x 10 = 50 video games.
"Response:  We know that there are 27 one-horned animals in the world and two-thirds of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Since two-thirds of the Scottish one-horned animals are female, we can find out how many female one-horned animals there are in the Scottish Highlands.

Two-thirds of 27 = 27 x (2/3) = 18

So, there are 18 female one-horned animals in the Scottish Highlands."
"Response:  Firstly we need to calculate the cost of each item without any discounts or taxes. 
Rory buys 2 cookies for $7.50 each = $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 
She buys 2 sandwiches for $1.50 each = $1.50 x 2 = $3.00 
She buys 2 more cookies for $1.00 each = $1.00 x 2 = $2.00 
Total cost before tax and discounts = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 
Now let's calculate the total cost with 20% tax added. We can use the formula: Total Cost = (Original Cost x Tax Rate) / 100 
Tax rate = 20% = 0.20 
Total Cost = ($20.00 x 0.20) / 100 = $4.00 / 100 = $4.00 
So the total cost with tax will be $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00 
Finally, Rory wants $5.00 food fee added, so we add that to the total cost: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00 
Therefore, Rory's order with all items, tax, and food fee will cost $29.00."
Response:  We know that Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test of 75 questions and he completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour. So, he could have answered 8 x 5 = 40 questions in 8 hours. Since there were 75 questions in total, Mark left 75 - 40 = 35 questions unanswered. Now, let's move on to the second test of 100 questions. If Mark took 6 hours to complete this test, he could have answered 6 x 5 = 30 questions in 6 hours. Therefore, Mark left 100 - 30 = 70 questions unanswered. In summary, Mark left 35 + 70 = 105 questions unanswered.
"Response:  We know that there are four times more pink balls than blue balls. So if there are 12 blue balls, we can multiply that number by 4 to find out how many pink balls there are.

12 x 4 = 48

So, there are 48 pink balls in total."
"Response:  We have 20 motors available for rent, and we know that 12 of them are automatic, 4 are manual, and the remaining 4 are semi-automatic. To find the percentage of semi-automatic motors, we can use the following formula:

(Number of semi-automatic motors / Total number of motors) x 100

In this case, the number of semi-automatic motors is 4, and the total number of motors is 20. So, we can calculate the percentage as follows:

(4/20) x 100 = 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic motors is 20%."
"Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and we have two types of bees - workers and drones. The ratio of workers to drones is 2:1, which means for every drone, there are two workers. Also, the number of drones is equal to the number of queens. So, if we can find out how many drones there are, we can easily calculate the number of workers and queens.
Let X be the number of drones. Then, the number of workers will be 2X and the number of queens will be X.
We know that the sum of all three quantities (workers, drones, and queens) is equal to 700. Therefore, we can write the following equation:
2X + X + X = 700
3X = 700
X = 233
So, there are 233 drones, 466 workers, and 233 queens in the hive."
"Response:  We know that Jordan plays video games for two hours every day and earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. To find out how much he would earn in a week, we need to calculate how many hours he works in a week.

There are 7 days in a week, and since Jordan works 2 hours each day, he works a total of 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week at his part-time job. So, if he earns $10 per hour, he would earn a total of 14 x $10 = $140 per week from his part-time job.

Now, let's add this amount to what he earns from playing video games. Since he plays for 2 hours per day, he plays for a total of 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week. If we assume that he earns an average of $5 per hour playing video games (this is just an assumption, as it could vary depending on the game and other factors), then he would earn a total of 14 x $5 = $70 per week from playing video games.

Adding both amounts together gives us a total of $140 + $70 = $210 per week. Therefore, Jordan would earn a total of $210 per week."
"Response:  Firstly we need to calculate the cost of each item without taxes and then add up all these costs with their respective tax rates applied. 

For John Koop Melk (Milk), the cost is $2 x 1.10 = $2.20 (with 10% tax rate).
For Eiers (Eggs), the cost is $3 x 1.10 = $3.30 (with 10% tax rate).
For Gloeilampen (Light Bulbs), the cost is $3 x 1.10 = $3.30 (with 10% tax rate).
For Bekers (Cups), the cost is $3 x 1.10 = $3.30 (with 10% tax rate).
For Kakkerlakvalle (Chocolate), the cost is $4 x 1.10 = $4.40 (with 10% tax rate).

Now let's add up all these costs including taxes:
$2.20 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $17.50

So the total cost for everything, including taxes, is $17.50."
"Response:  Firstly, let's calculate how much money Lucas will make from each client based on their needs and prices of products. 
1st Client - 2 bottles of detergent ($2 x 2 = $4) + 1 pack of laundry powder ($5 = $5) = $9 
2nd Client - 2 bottles of detergent ($2 x 2 = $4) + 1 pack of laundry powder ($5 = $5) = $9 
3rd Client - 2 bottles of detergent ($2 x 2 = $4) + 1 pack of laundry powder ($5 = $5) = $9 
Total income for 3 clients = $9 + $9 + $9 = $27 
Now, let's calculate the total expenses for 3 clients. 
1st Client - 2 bottles of detergent at $2 each = $4 
2nd Client - 2 bottles of detergent at $2 each = $4 
3rd Client - 2 bottles of detergent at $2 each = $4 
Total expenses for 3 clients = $4 + $4 + $4 = $12 
So, the profit for 3 clients = Total Income - Total Expenses = $27 - $12 = $15 
Since there are 5 potential clients, Lucas can expect to earn an additional $15 x 5 = $75 per week. Therefore, his total weekly income would be $27 (from 3 clients) + $75 = $102."
Response:  We know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares of land. So, he has a total of 10 x 100 = 1000 pineapples. Since he can harvest them every 3 months, he will have 4 harvests in a year (3 months x 4 = 12 months). Therefore, he can harvest 1000 / 4 = 250 pineapples per month or 3000 pineapples in a year (250 x 12 = 3000).
Response:  We know that Johnny has 500 pieces of Legos spread out on the floor of his room. He had three times as many pieces as that, which is 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. And he also had one quarter of that amount, which is 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces. So, in total, Johnny will have 500 + 375 = 875 pieces of Legos to collect.
"Response:  We know that 30 birds left the nest in the first 6 hours and then half of them returned within the next 6 hours. So, if 30 birds left, then 15 birds returned (since half of 30 is 15). Now, we need to find out how many birds are still missing from the original 30. To do this, we subtract the number of birds that returned from the total number of birds that left:  
Missing birds = Total birds left - Birds that returned  
= 30 - 15  
= 15  
So, there were 15 birds that did not return to the nest during the day."
"Response:  We know that the admission price for adults is $12 and for children is $10. If Brittany's mom gave the cashier $8, she must have paid for one adult ticket ($12) and one child ticket ($10). Therefore, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave to the cashier is:

$12 + $10 = $22

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $22."
"Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So if Dorothy has x friends, then Charlie has 3x friends, and James has 4x friends. 
We also know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
3x = 12 
Solving for x gives us: 
x = 4 
So Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook. Therefore, James has 4 x 4 = 16 friends on Facebook."
"Response:  We know that Steve lives 3 miles away from school and can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. That means he will take:

3 miles / 440 ft/min = 7 minutes to reach the school

Now we need to find out how long Tim will take to reach the school. We know that Tim lives 2 miles away from school and can ride his scooter at 264 feet per minute. So:

2 miles / 264 ft/min = 8 minutes to reach the school

Since Tim starts later than Steve, he will arrive after Steve has already reached the school. The difference in their arrival times is:

7 minutes (Steve) - 8 minutes (Tim) = 1 minute

So, Tim will wait for Steve for 1 minute before starting the race."
"Response:  We know that each band costs $0.25 to inflate and there were five people who came to inflate their tires on the first day. Therefore, the total amount earned from the five customers would be:

5 x $0.25 = $1.25

On the second day, three more people came to inflate their tires with the special bands. So, we add the amount earned from these three customers to the previous total:

$1.25 + (3 x $0.25) = $1.25 + $0.75 = $2.00

Finally, one person came to inflate their tire with a single band, so we add this amount to the total:

$2.00 + $0.25 = $2.25

Therefore, the total amount earned on both days is $2.25."
"Response:  If Carl buys ten packs of cookies and each pack has six cookies inside, then he will buy a total of 
ten x 6 = 60 cookies. Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl will pay 
60 x $0.10 = $6 for all the cookies. So, Carl will receive $10 - $6 = $4 in change."
"Response:  We know that Dave had eaten 14 of the potatoes before he gave the rest to the hungry semolina. So, if we subtract 14 from the total number of potatoes, we get:

Total number of potatoes - 14 = x (where x is the remaining number of potatoes)

Now, we know that three doves ate three potatoes each, so they ate a total of:

3 x 3 = 9 potatoes

And a wasp ate two-thirds of the remaining potatoes, which is:

2/3 x x = 2x/3 (where x is the remaining number of potatoes)

We also know that there were five leftover potatoes. So, let's substitute this into our equation for the wasp's share:

2x/3 + 5 = x

Solving for x, we get:

2x/3 + 5 = x

x = 7

So, there were seven potatoes left over after Dave ate his fill and the animals ate their shares. Therefore, the answer to the original question is:

There were 7 + 14 = 21 potatoes in the package when Dave bought it."
"Response:  We know that there are three one-hour classes per day (Monday to Friday), so that's 3 x 5 = 15 hours of class time per week. Since there are two two-hour classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, that adds up to 2 x 2 = 4 more hours per week. Therefore, the total number of hours spent in class each week is:

15 + 4 = 19 hours/week

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours spent in class for an entire semester (assuming 16 weeks):

19 hours/week x 16 weeks = 304 hours

So, Kimo spends 304 hours in class during an entire semester."
"Response:  We know that Bill has to bake 300 bread rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each bread roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 1 meter long. So, let's calculate the total length of all the items Bill needs to bake:

* Bread rolls: 300 x 4 = 1200 inches (or 100 feet)
* Chocolate croissants: 120 x 6 = 720 inches (or 60 feet)
* Baguettes: 60 x 1 = 600 inches (or 50 feet)

Total length: 100 + 60 + 50 = 210 feet

So, if Bill places all his baked goods end to end, they would stretch for approximately 210 feet!"
"Response:  We know that there are 3 types of animals in the zoo: apes, gorillas, and baboons. Each animal needs a certain number of bananas per month. The ape needs 200 bananas every two months, the gorilla needs 400 bananas every two months, and the baboon needs 100 bananas every two months. To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to buy for two months, we need to multiply the number of bananas each animal needs by 2 (since they need it every two months). So, the total number of bananas needed is:

Apes: 200 x 2 = 400 bananas
Gorillas: 400 x 2 = 800 bananas
Baboons: 100 x 2 = 200 bananas
Total: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas
Therefore, the zookeeper needs to buy 1400 bananas for two months."
"Response:  We know that Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means she covers a distance of 100 meters x 15 = 1500 meters. 
Now, we need to find out how far Kelly goes when she does her 34 laps. Since she starts at the 40-yard line and runs back to the starting point, each lap is 40 yards long. So, Kelly runs a total distance of 40 yards x 34 laps = 1360 yards. 
Since Kelly runs less than Blake, the winner is Blake, who covered 1500 meters compared to Kelly's 1360 yards."
Response:  We know that Raphael bought four pens, two note books and one ream of bond paper. The cost of each pen is $1.50, so the total cost of the pens is 4 x $1.50 = $6.00. The cost of each note book is $4.00, so the total cost of the note books is 2 x $4.00 = $8.00. Finally, the cost of the ream of bond paper is $20.00. Therefore, the total amount spent by Raphael is $6.00 + $8.00 + $20.00 = $34.00.
Response:  If there are 11 penguins in the water and two of them go under a rock, then there will be 11 - 2 = 9 penguins left in the water. So, Finn can see 9 penguins in the dam.
"Response:  We know that on Monday, the depth of the water in the tank was 17 feet (5.2 meters). On Tuesday, there was an additional 2 meters of water, so the total depth became:

17 + 2 = 19 feet (5.8 meters)

On Wednesday, the depth of the water was two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So we can set up a proportion to represent this information:

Wednesday depth : Tuesday depth = 2/3 : 19

Now we need to cross-multiply and simplify:

(2/3) x 19 = 13

So the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday was 13 feet (4 meters)."
"Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 sisters, 6 sea urchins, and 3 narwhals. Locsin caught fewer sisters (5 less than Anakin), fewer sea urchins (3 less than Anakin), and more clownfish (2 more than Anakin). So we can start by subtracting the number of sisters, sea urchins, and clownfish that Locsin caught from the total amount that Anakin caught:

* Sisters: 10 - 5 = 5
* Sea urchins: 6 - 3 = 3
* Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5

Now we have the total number of each type of fish that both Anakin and Locsin caught:

* Sisters: 5
* Sea urchins: 3
* Clownfish: 5

So together, they caught 5 sisters, 3 sea urchins, and 5 clownfish."
"Response:  We know that the original price of the socks is R20 and it decreases by 20% every two months. So after one month, the price will be:
R20 x (1 - 0.2) = R20 x 0.8 = R16
After two months, the price will be:
R16 x (1 - 0.2) = R16 x 0.8 = R12.80
So, after three months, the price of the socks will be R12.80.
Therefore, the answer is R12.80."
"Response:  We know that the total cost of all the toys is $20. The red motor costs $4 each and there are 5 of them, so their combined cost is 5 x $4 = $20. Therefore, the cost of one red motor is $20/5 = $4 per unit. 
The action figures cost $5 each and there are 3 of them, so their combined cost is 3 x $5 = $15. 
The pop costs $4 and there is only one of it, so its cost is $4. 
Therefore, the total cost of all the toys is $20, which can be calculated as follows: $4 (red motor) + $15 (action figures) + $4 (pop) = $20."
Response:  If Jackie decides to handle her taxes herself, she will lose $35 per hour (based on the 3 hours she spends on tax preparation). This means that she will miss out on $105 in potential income ($35 x 3 hours). However, if she hires a bookkeeper for $90, she will still have $15 left over after paying for the service ($105 - $90 = $15). So, it makes more financial sense for Jackie to hire a bookkeeper rather than handling her taxes herself.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Elvira has available for clothes shopping after deducting the cost of the computer and its accessories from her birthday budget of €1500. We can do this by subtracting the total cost of the computer and its accessories (€1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €2823) from her birthday budget:

€1500 - €2823 = €-1323

So, Elvira has €1323 less than her original birthday budget available for clothes shopping. To find out how much she can spend on clothes, we divide the remaining amount by the price of the clothing item she wants to buy:

€1323 / €x (where x is the price of the clothing item) = y

We don't know the exact price of the clothing item yet, so let's say it costs around €50. Then we can calculate how much Elvira can spend on clothes like this:

€1323 / €50 = 26

Therefore, Elvira can spend up to €26 on clothes shopping."
"Response:  We know that Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan and she has to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraising event. So, we can calculate how many times she needs to sit on children using the following formula:

Number of times = Total number of eggs required / Number of eggs per sitting

In this case, the total number of eggs required is 15 (for 15 Spanish flans) and the number of eggs per sitting is 9 (since Sandra gives each child 9 eggs every time). Therefore, we can calculate the number of times Sandra needs to sit on children as follows:

Number of times = 15 / 9 = 16

So, Sandra needs to sit on children 16 times to prepare all 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraising event."
Response:  We know that Brooke is 28 years old and Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is 28, then Seth must be... (wait for it)... 56!
Response:  We know that Jimmy has two dollars more than Ethel. So if Ethel has $8, then Jimmy must have $8 + 2 = $10.
Response:  If Pancho walks 20 miles per day and rests for 10 miles at night, then he walks a total of 30 miles each day (20 + 10). To find out how many miles he walks in a week, we need to multiply the number of days he walks by the number of miles he walks per day. So, if Pancho walks for 7 days, he will walk a total of 7 x 30 = 210 miles in one week.
"Response:  We know that each uniform has three components: hat ($25), baggy pants ($3 times the cost of the hat), and shoes (the average cost of the hat and baggy pants). So we can start by calculating the cost of each component separately:

1. Hat: $25
2. Baggy Pants: $3 x $25 = $75
3. Shoes: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $45

Now let's add up all the costs to find the total cost of each uniform:

Total Cost = $25 + $75 + $45 = $145

So, the total cost of each uniform is $145."
"Response:  We know that Jake sees:

* 80 spiders with each having 8 legs = 80 x 8 = 640 legs
* 90 insects with each having 6 legs = 90 x 6 = 540 legs
* 3 strange unclassified creatures with each having 10 legs = 3 x 10 = 30 legs

Adding all these up gives us a total of:

640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

So Jake sees a total of 1210 legs."
"Response:  We know that Sally Twee is three years older than Sally Four, and Ouma Rooi is twice as old as Sally Three. So we can start with these two pieces of information:

Sally Twee = Sally Four + 3
Ouma Rooi = Sally Three x 2

Now we need to find out how old each of the four birds are. We know that Sally Four is eight years old, so let's use that as our starting point:

Sally Four = 8

We also know that Sally Three is three years younger than Sally Twee, so we can calculate her age like this:

Sally Three = Sally Twee - 3

And finally, we know that Ouma Rooi is twice as old as Sally Three, so we can calculate her age like this:

Ouma Rooi = 2 x Sally Three

Now we have all four ages:

Sally Four = 8
Sally Three = Sally Twee - 3
Ouma Rooi = 2 x Sally Three

To find the total age of the four birds, we just add up their ages:

Total Age = Sally Four + Sally Three + Ouma Rooi
= 8 + (Sally Twee - 3) + 2 x Sally Three
= 8 + Sally Twee - 3 + 2 x Sally Three
=...?

Can you fill in the blank with the correct answer?"
"Response:  We know that Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum amount for each month. So we can start by finding out how much she will have to pay if she pays the minimum amounts for each of her debts.

For her student loan, the minimum payment is $300 per month.
For her credit card, the minimum payment is $200 per month.
For her car loan, the minimum payment is $500 per month.

So if Jessica only makes the minimum payments for all three debts, she will have to pay:
$300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000 per month

Since Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum, let's assume she decides to pay an extra 50% of the total minimum payment. This means she will pay:

1.5 x $1,000 = $1,500 per month

Now, let's calculate how much Jessica will pay in a year:

12 months x $1,500 per month = $18,000 per year

Therefore, if Jessica pays $1,500 per month (which is 50% more than the minimum payment) for all three debts, she will pay a total of $18,000 per year."
"Response:  We know that Billy needs half a minute to peel each apple (30 seconds), and he has 60 apples to prepare. So, if we multiply 30 seconds by 60 apples, we get:

60 x 30 = 1800 seconds

Now, let's convert this time into minutes:

1800 / 60 = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 30 minutes to prepare all the apples for his big family reunion barbecue."
"Response:  We know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade at $0.50 per glass, and they get 20 glasses per gallon. So, if they make $25 in profit, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the number of gallons sold (since each gallon costs $3)
Profit = Number of glasses x Price per glass
= 20 x $0.50
= $10

Now, we want to find out how much lemonade they have sold. To do this, we need to divide the profit by the price per glass:

$10 / $0.50
= 20 gallons

So, Juan and Carlos have sold 20 gallons of lemonade."
"Response:  We know that there were 80 Japanese and the rest are Chinese. If the number of sons in the Chinese group is 60, then the number of daughters must be equal to the total number of Chinese minus the number of sons. So we can write an equation:

Number of daughters = Total number of Chinese - Number of sons
= 80 + 60 - 60
= 80

Therefore, there were 80 girls in the Chinese group."
Response:  We know that Zaid has a monthly income of $6000. First, he spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $6000 x 1/4 = $1500. Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on fuel for his motorcycle, which is $6000 x 1/3 = $2000. Then, he gives half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity organization, which is ($6000 - $1500 - $2000) / 2 = $1500 / 2 = $750. Finally, he gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses and his wife $700 for household expenses, so the total amount left after all these expenses and donations is $750 + $200 + $700 = $1650. Therefore, Zaid will have $1650 left after all these expenses and donations.
Response:  We know that Rani has ten more crap than Monica, so Monica has crap. And we also know that Bo has four fewer craps than Monica, so Monica has craps. Therefore, the total number of crap that the three together is: + + =
"Response:  We know that Lloyd earns $10 per hour and he has 5 hours of tutorials for the first week and 8 hours for the second week. To calculate his total earnings for each week, let's multiply the number of hours he works by his hourly rate. For the first week, this would be:

5 hours x $10/hour = $50
For the second week, this would be:

8 hours x $10/hour = $80
So, Lloyd will have earned a total of $50 + $80 = $130 over the two weeks."
"Response:  We know that the winner got 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in total. So we can start by finding out how many votes the winner got. To do this, we can multiply the number of voters (80) by the fraction of votes the winner got (3/4):

80 x 3/4 =?

Can you solve for the unknown quantity?"
Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white anemones and 200 penny calla lilies, which is five times more white anemones. So if she ordered x white anemones, she ordered 4x = 4x = 200 red roses. To make up for the lost roses, Fred must deliver 200 - 200 = 0 red roses by 5 pm. Therefore, the correct answer is zero (0) red roses must be delivered to Sandra by 5 pm.
Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was five years older than Jan. So if Jan is currently 30 years old, we can calculate how old Mark would have been two years ago. Two years ago, Mark would have been 28 (since he is 30 now). Now we know that Mark was five years older than Jan two years ago, so Jan would have been 23 at that time. Since Jan is currently 30, this means that Jean is also 30 years old.
Response:  We know that each member of the faster team will run their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So if there are four members on the team, they will complete the race in a total time of 4 x 55 = 220 seconds. Now let's look at the slower team. Their first runner will take 60 seconds to cover 400 meters, but each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the slower team will be 4 x 51 = 204 seconds. Since the faster team finished in 220 seconds and the slower team finished in 204 seconds, the difference between their times is 220 - 204 = 16 seconds.
"Response:  If Jerry throws two dice and gets two numbers greater than 3, then he has a chance of getting that outcome. To calculate this probability, we need to count how many ways there are to throw two dice and get two numbers greater than 3.

There are 6 possible outcomes when throwing one die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. When Jerry throws the first die, there are 6 possible outcomes. For each of these outcomes, there are only 5 possible outcomes for the second die, since the first die already determines the range of possible values for the second die. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for both dice is 6 x 5 = 30.

Now, let's count how many of these outcomes result in two numbers greater than 3. There are 4 positive integers greater than 3: 4, 5, 6, and 7. Since each die can take on any of these four values, there are 4 x 4 = 16 possible outcomes where both dice show positive integers greater than 3.

So, the probability of Jerry throwing two numbers greater than 3 is 16/30, or approximately 0.53 (53%)."
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together have plucked half of the apples from their apple farm, then they must have plucked 50% of the total number of apples. Since her mother has picked up 20 apples, we can find out how many apples Jenna has picked up by subtracting the number of apples her mother has picked up from the total number of apples that they have plucked. So, if her mother has picked up 20 apples, then Jenna has picked up (50% - 20) = 30 apples. Therefore, Jenna and her mother together have plucked 50 + 30 = 80 apples from their apple farm.
Response:  We know that there are 10 hutches with hamsters, each hamster gets 5 pieces of food, so there are 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of food for the hamsters. There are also 3 cages with rats, each rat gets 6 pieces of food, so there are 3 x 6 = 18 pieces of food for the rats. Finally, there are 20 pieces of food under the rabbits, but we don't know how many hutches there are for the rabbits. So let's add up all the food for each group: 50 + 18 + 20 = 88 pieces of food in total. Since there are 160 pieces of food in total, we can divide the total number of food by the number of groups to find out how many pieces of food are in each group: 160 / 3 = 53.33 (since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of food, we will round down to the nearest whole number) Therefore, there are 53 pieces of food in each group. Now, we need to determine which group each piece of food belongs to. Since there are more hutches for the hamsters than any other animal, it makes sense to assume that half of the food is for the hamsters. So, if there are 53 pieces of food in each group, then half of them (26.5) would be for the hamsters. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of food, we will round down to the nearest whole number again: 26 pieces of food for the hamsters. The remaining 27 pieces of food (53 - 26) would belong to the rats and rabbits combined.
"Response:  We know that Mandy borrowed R100 from Benedict at an interest rate of 2% per month. If she paid back the loan after 3 months, we can calculate how much she needs to pay back using the formula for simple interest:

Simple Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is R100, the rate is 2% per month (or 2/100), and the time is 3 months (or 3 x 30 days).

So, let's plug in these values into the formula:

Simple Interest = R100 x (2/100) x 3

Simplifying the expression:

Simple Interest = R100 x 2 x 3

= R600

Therefore, Mandy needs to pay back R600 to Benedict after 3 months."
"Response:  We know that the farmer sold each bag of corn for $30 and made a total profit of $400. So, we can start by writing an equation based on this information:

$30 x (number of bags) = $400

Now, we are also given that it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse. So, let's add that to our equation:

$30 x (number of bags) + $2(number of bags) = $400

Simplifying the equation:

$30x + $2x = $400 + $2x

Combine like terms:

$5x = $402

Divide both sides by $5:

x = $81

Therefore, the farmer sold 81 bags of corn at $30 each, making a total profit of $400 after transportation costs."
Response:  We know that three friends spent $20.25 on three carnival tickets and had $4.50 less than what they paid for the tickets. They also went on two different rides that cost $33 each. To find out how much each friend paid, we need to first calculate the total amount they spent on the rides. Two rides at $33 each means they spent $66 on rides in total. Since they had $4.50 less than what they paid for the tickets, they must have paid $61.50 for the tickets ($66 - $4.50). Now, let's divide the total amount spent on rides and tickets among the three friends: $66 + $61.50 = $127.50 / 3 = $42.50 per person. So, each friend paid $42.50 for their share of the rides and tickets.
"Response:  We know that John can collect 2 perskets per minute and he has to collect them for 3 hours. So we need to calculate how many minutes he will have to collect perskets in total. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 x 3 = 180 minutes in 3 hours. Now we can calculate how many perskets John will collect in total: 
180 minutes x 2 perskets/minute = 360 perskets. Therefore, John will collect 360 perskets during his 3-hour shift."
"Response:  We know that each elephant needs to eat 2.5 kilograms of insects every week, and there are ten elephants in total. So, if we divide the total amount of insects needed by the number of elephants, we get:

2.5 kg/week / 10 elephants = 0.25 kg/day/elephant

Therefore, each elephant needs to eat approximately 0.25 kilograms of insects per day."
Response:  We know that Tom plants 10 bombs per year and removes two bombs each year. So he starts with 50 bombs (50 x 10 = 500). After 10 years, he will have 500 + 10 x 9 = 500 + 900 = 1400 bombs. However, we are also told that 30% of the bombs will die every year, so after 10 years, only 70% of the original 500 bombs will remain. Therefore, the number of bombs Tom has after 10 years is 1400 x 70% = 980 bombs.
Response:  On Saturday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front lawn. Then, on Sunday morning, 18 more pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, on Sunday morning, there were 36 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front lawn.
"Response:  We know that Violetta needs 5 different colored pens and she has $20 to spend. Each pen costs $2, so we can calculate how many pens she can buy with her budget like this:

$20 / $2 per pen = 10 pens

So, Violetta will be able to buy 10 pens of different colors with her $20."
"Response:  We know that one pen costs R1,20 and an eraser costs R0,30. To find out how much 8 pens cost, we need to multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
R1,20 x 8 = R9,60
So, 8 pens will cost R9,60."
"Response:  We know that there are 200 pounds of potatoes and we need to distribute them among 40 restaurants. Since each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of potatoes, we can calculate how many kilograms of potatoes will not be used as follows:

200 lbs = 90.7185 kg (since 1 lb = 0.453592 kg)

So, 90.7185 kg of potatoes will not be used."
"Response:  We know that there are 23,786 people living in Soda, and we can break them down into three categories: males (8,417), females (9,092), and children. Since the total population of Soda is made up of these three groups, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

23,786 = 8,417 + 9,092 + x

where ""x"" represents the number of children in Soda. To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 8,417 and 9,092 from both sides of the equation:

23,786 - 8,417 - 9,092 = x

This gives us:

5,377 = x

So, there are 5,377 children living in Soda."
"Response:  We know that Elaine had 20 cards at first and then she collected more in each month. In the second month, she collected fewer cards than in the first month, and in the third month, she collected twice as many cards as she did in the first two months combined. So let's start with what we know:

1. Elaine had 20 cards at first (first month).
2. She collected more cards in each subsequent month.
3. In the second month, she collected fewer cards than in the first month.
4. In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as she did in the first two months combined.

Now, let's calculate how many cards Elaine has in total:

First month: 20 cards
Second month: 20 + (fewer cards than first month) = 20 + x cards (where x is the number of fewer cards)
Third month: 20 + x + (twice as many cards as first two months combined) = 20 + x + 2(20 + x) = 20 + x + 40

Total: 20 + x + 40 =?

We don't know the exact value of x yet, but we can set up an equation based on the information given:

x + 40 = Total

Since we know that Elaine started with 20 cards, we can substitute 20 for x:

20 + 40 = Total

60 = Total

Therefore, Elaine has 60 Pokémon cards in total."
"Response:  We know that Mark edits the same number of sentences for two different publishers, let's call them Publisher A and Publisher B. Publisher A pays Mark half as much as Publisher B. The total number of sentences edited by Mark each week is 1000. So we can start by setting up an equation based on this information:

Let X be the number of sentences edited for Publisher A (since they pay half as much)
Let Y be the number of sentences edited for Publisher B

We know that X + Y = 1000 (total number of sentences edited)

Since Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, we can write:

X \* 5c = (1/2)Y \* BC (where BC is the amount paid by Publisher B)

Now we need to find out how much Publisher B pays Mark. Since they pay twice as much as Publisher A, we can set up the following equation:

BC = 2(5c) = 10c

Substituting this into our previous equation, we get:

X \* 5c = (1/2)Y \* 10c

Solving for X, we get:

X = 500 (number of sentences edited for Publisher A)

And since X + Y = 1000, we have:

Y = 500 (number of sentences edited for Publisher B)

So Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 x 5c = 2500c

And from Publisher B:

500 x 10c = 5000c

In total, Mark earns:

2500c + 5000c = 7500c

Therefore, Mark earns 7500 cents (or $75) per week."
"Response:  We know that Baldur gets 5 embers of water in the morning and 6 embers of water at noon every day. An ember contains 5 liters of water, so we can calculate how much water he gets each day as follows:

Morning: 5 embers x 5 liters/ember = 25 liters
Noon: 6 embers x 5 liters/ember = 30 liters
Total daily water intake: 25 + 30 = 55 liters
Therefore, Baldur drinks 55 liters of water every day."
"Response:  We know that John received a one-time cash bonus of $5000 and a 5% salary increase. If he makes $2000 per week, every week of the year, and he received the bonus on the first day of the year, then we can calculate how much money he made that year using the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of weeks in a year:
There are 52 weeks in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a non-leap year).
2. Multiply the number of weeks by his weekly salary to get the total amount earned for the year:
$2000 x 52 = $104,000
3. Add the one-time cash bonus to the total amount earned:
$104,000 + $5000 = $109,000

So, John made $109,000 that year, including the one-time cash bonus and the 5% salary increase."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 hectares of land and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year. So, in total, the farm produces 10 x 5 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels (vat) of wine, we can calculate the number of barrels produced as follows: 

50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year."
Response:  We know that Carl has used 3 eggs and 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich he made during the week, so in total, he has used 3 x 7 = 21 eggs and 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese. Additionally, we know that he has used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese dish, so the total number of slices of cheese Carl has consumed is 21 + 14 + 8 = 43 slices of cheese.
"Response:  We know that Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens before she bought any more. So, let's start with those numbers:

22 (green) + 10 (yellow) = 32

Now, we know that she bought 6 packs of blue pens and each pack contained 9 pens. So, let's calculate how many blue pens she bought:

6 x 9 = 54

And she also bought 2 packs of red pens, each containing 6 pens:

2 x 6 = 12

So, now we have our total number of pens:

32 + 54 + 12 = 98

Therefore, Janet has 98 pens in total."
"Response:  We know that Brinley has five test scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To find out what score she needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to first calculate her current average using the five test scores she already has.

Current Average = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5
= 458 / 5
= 91.6

Since Brinley's current average is 91.6, she needs to get at least 93 - 91.6 = 1.4 more on the sixth test to bring her average up to 93. Therefore, the score she needs on the sixth test is 1.4."
Response:  We know that Michael has been riding his bike at least five times a week for four weeks, so he has done at least 5 x 4 = 20 trips. Each trip was 25 kilometers long, so he has traveled at least 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers. However, he then reduced his frequency to two times a week and increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time, so he has done three such trips. Therefore, the total distance Michael has traveled is 3 x 60 = 180 kilometers.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate sticks and 80 confetti apples in Joe's bag. Each chocolate stick weighs twice as much as each confetti apple. So if each chocolate stick weighs 40 grams, how much does Joe's entire bag of candy weigh?

Let x be the number of confetti apples in Joe's bag. Since each confetti apple weighs 20 grams, x \* 20 = 1600 grams (since there are 80 confetti apples).

Now, let y be the number of chocolate sticks in Joe's bag. Since each chocolate stick weighs 40 grams, y \* 40 = 1600 grams (since there are 25 chocolate sticks).

We have two equations:

x \* 20 + y \* 40 = 1600... (1)

x + y = 25... (2)

Solving equation (1) for x, we get:

x = 80

Substituting this value into equation (2), we get:

y = 17

So there are 80 confetti apples and 17 chocolate sticks in Joe's bag. The total weight of Joe's bag is:

80 \* 20 + 17 \* 40 = 1600 + 680 = 2280 grams"
Response:  We know that Rose went shopping on Monday and bought 4 cookies. On Tuesday, she went to another store and bought three times as many cookies as she bought on Monday (3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she went to another store again and bought five times as many cookies as she bought on Tuesday (5 x 12 = 60). In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cookies over the three days.
"Response:  We know that the total cost of one full-size bottle is R6000 and we want to find out the cost per glass of wine for each half-size bottle. To do this, we need to divide the cost of the full-size bottle by two since there are two glasses in a half-size bottle. So, the cost per glass would be:
R6000 ÷ 2 = R3000 per glass
Therefore, the total cost of each half-size bottle would be twice the cost per glass, or:
R3000 x 2 = R6000 per half-size bottle"
Response:  We know that Sara has already saved $10 before she started babysitting and she needs to save $30 for the new bag and $20 for each pair of shoes, so she needs to earn $60 in total. She gets paid $5 every time she watches her neighbor's children, so she needs to do it 12 times (60/5 = 12) to be able to afford everything she wants.
"Response:  We know that Jerry has twice as many white hens as red hens (2x = 2). So if he has x red hens, he has 2x white hens. Now we are given that the total number of eggs produced by all the hens is 42. Since each red hen produces 3 eggs per day and each white hen produces 5 eggs per day, we can calculate how many hens of each color Jerry must have to produce 42 eggs in total:

Let x be the number of red hens:

3x + 10(2x) = 42... (1)

where 10 is the number of white hens for every one red hen. Solving equation (1), we get:

x = 6... (2)

So Jerry has 6 red hens. Therefore, he has 2 times 6 = 12 white hens."
"Response:  We know that Gary covers 5 kilometers per hour and he walks along the edge of the large park, which has a rectangular shape with a length of 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) and a width of 6 miles (9.7 kilometers). To find out how many hours it takes him to walk around the park, we need to first calculate the distance he needs to cover.

Distance = Length x Width = 2.4 km x 9.7 km = 23.28 km

Now, we can use our formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find out how many hours it takes Gary to walk around the park:

Time = 23.28 km / 5 km/hr = 4.66 hours

Therefore, Gary will spend approximately 4 hours and 40 minutes walking around the large park."
"Response:  We know that on the first day, there were 100 customers and on the second day, there were 50 more than the previous day, so on the second day, there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers. On the third day, there were 500 customers in total, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:

100 + 50 + x = 500

Where x is the number of customers on the third day. Solving for x, we get:

x = 350

So, on the third day, there were 350 customers."
"Response:  We know that the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago. So if the large pool had x liters of water, the small pool would have had x/2 liters of water.
We also know that both pools are currently emptying at a rate of 4 liters per minute. Therefore, after t minutes, the large pool will be empty and the small pool will have (x/2) - 4t liters of water left.
Since the small pool has less than half the amount of water as the large pool, we can set up the equation:
(x/2) - 4t = y
where y is the amount of water in the small pool.
Now we need to find the value of x and y. We know that the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, so we can start with the equation:
x = 2y
Substituting this into our first equation, we get:
(2y)/2 - 4t = y
Simplifying, we get:
y = 2t + 1
So the small pool has 2t + 1 liters of water left.
Finally, we can find the initial amount of water in the small pool by substituting t = 0 into the equation:
y = 2(0) + 1 = 1
Therefore, the small pool started with 1 liter of water."
"Response:  We know that Lori wants to buy shoes worth $320 and a belt worth $32. So, in total she needs to spend $352. She earns $8 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work before she can afford her purchases, we need to divide the amount she needs to spend by her hourly wage. Here's the calculation:

$352 / $8/hour = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford her purchases."
"Response:  We know that Janeth borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will have to pay back $2000 + (10% x $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200. 
Now, if she pays $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate her outstanding balance at the end of the period as follows: 
Outstanding Balance = Principal Amount + Monthly Payments - Total Interest Paid 
= $2200 + ($165 x 12) - ($2200 x 10%) 
= $2200 + $1980 - $220 
= $3980 
So, Janeth's outstanding balance at the end of 12 months will be $3980."
Response:  We know that there are four roses and seven more daisies than roses. So if we have four roses, we will add seven more daisies to get the total number of flowers. Seven plus four equals eleven. Therefore, there are eleven flowers in the vase.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet is half of Zack's age. So we can start with some equations based on this information. 
First equation: Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian's age = 3 x Harriet's age. 
Second equation: Harriet is half of Zack's age, so Harriet's age = (1/2) x Zack's age. 
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use these equations to find out the average age of the three?"
"Response:  We know that the total score is 251 points and Naomi scored 68 points. So, we can start by subtracting Naomi's score from the total score to find out how many points were left before Yuri and Brianna played their turns:

251 - 68 = 183

Now, we know that Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score. To find out how many points Yuri scored, we need to first calculate half of Naomi's score:

Half of 68 = 68 / 2 = 34

Since Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, Yuri scored:

34 + 10 = 44

points. Now, let's add up all the scores:

183 + 44 +? = 251 (where? represents Brianna's score)

We know that Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi's score, so we can calculate her score as follows:

17 + 68 = 85

So, the final answer is:

183 + 44 + 85 = 312

Therefore, Jojo has scored 312 points."
"Response:  We know that Carmen takes 10 minutes to complete one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to complete one Sudoku puzzle. During the week, she solves three crossword puzzles and eight Sudoku puzzles. So, we can calculate the total time it takes her to solve all these puzzles as follows:

For crossword puzzles:
3 x 10 = 30 minutes

For Sudoku puzzles:
8 x 5 = 40 minutes

Total time: 30 + 40 = 70 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spends 70 minutes playing these games during the week."
Response:  We know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. That means there are 90 - 90 = 0 liters left in the tank. But we also know that she collected twice as much rainwater as the original amount of water in the tank. So if there were originally 120 liters of water in the tank (as given), then Celine collected 2 x 120 = 240 liters of rainwater. Therefore, there are now 240 - 90 = 150 liters of water left in the tank.
"Response:  We know that Andy has 90 geraniums and he plants each one with 3 flowers (as stated in the problem). So, if we multiply 90 by 3, we get:

90 x 3 = 270

That means Andy will have 270 flowers from his 90 geraniums. However, he also plants 40 mini petunias, which produce 5 flowers per plant (again, as stated in the problem). If we multiply 40 by 5, we get:

40 x 5 = 200

So, adding up all the flowers that Andy will have, we get:

270 + 200 = 470

Therefore, Andy will have 470 flowers in total!"
Response:  We know that the company spends R15 000 per year on advertising, so for two years, they will spend R30 000 in total (R15 000 x 2).
"Response:  We know that Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour and Benji rents a fleet of pineapple boats for $18 per hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the fleet for 5 hours, we need to calculate how much they will pay together. First, let's calculate how much Carlos will pay: 
$30 x 3 = $90 Now, let's calculate how much Benji will pay: $18 x 5 = $90 (Note: This is the same amount as Carlos paid) Now, let's add their total costs: $90 + $90 = $180 So, together they will pay $180 for their boat rentals."
"Response:  We know that it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half the time (3 days) to travel back by car. So if Andrew plans to go by bus one way and by car the other way, he will spend a total of:

6 + 3 = 9 days

Therefore, Andrew will take 9 days to complete his trip."
"Response:  We have three types of cards in total: fire, grass, and water. The probability that any card drawn at random will be of type fire is 30/90 = 1/3 or approximately 0.33. 
The probability that any card drawn at random will be of type grass is 20/90 = 2/5 or approximately 0.4. 
The probability that any card drawn at random will be of type water is 40/90 = 4/5 or approximately 0.8. After losing 8 water cards, there are now 8 fewer water cards out of a total of 90, so the number of water cards left is 40 - 8 = 32. 
Therefore, the new probabilities for each type of card after losing 8 water cards are: 
Fire: 30/90 = 1/3 or approximately 0.33 
Grass: 20/90 = 2/5 or approximately 0.4 
Water: 32/90 = 4/7 or approximately 0.57 (rounded to the nearest whole number)."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of the basic burrito. The base price is $6.50. Next, we add extra meat for $1,000, extra cheese for $1,000, and avocado for $1,000. That brings the total to $4,500. Then, we add two soups for $2,000 each, which adds another $4,000 to the total. Finally, we pay an additional $3.00 for chips and drinks, bringing the grand total to $8,500. However, we have a gift card worth $5,000 that we can use towards our bill. So, our final amount due would be: $8,500 - $5,000 = $3,500.
Response:  We know that Kalinda can do 4 pieces per minute and her mother can do half as much, which is 2 pieces per minute. So together they can do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. To find out how many hours it will take to complete the task of 360 pieces, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate of work: 360 / (4 + 2) = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes. Therefore, it will take them 60 minutes or 1 hour to complete the task.
"Response:  We know that Ashlyn found out after two months that 30% of the watermelons were ready for picking and she took them home. Two weeks later, when she returned to the farm, three-quarters (75%) of the remaining watermelons were ripe. So, if 30% of the initial number of watermelons were picked, what percentage of the remaining watermelons were not yet ripe?

Let X be the total number of watermelons produced by the farm. Since 30% were picked, the number of watermelons left on the farm is:
X - 30% of X = X - 0.3X = 0.7X

Now, we know that 75% of the remaining watermelons were ripe, so the number of unripe watermelons can be calculated as follows:

Unripe watermelons = 0.7X - 0.75(0.7X) = 0.7X - 0.525X = 0.175X

Therefore, there were 17.5% of the watermelons not yet ripe two weeks later."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the motors. If there are 12 motors and each costs $20,000, then the total cost would be:

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we need to subtract the 10% tax that Mark needs to pay on the motors. This is calculated as follows:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

So, the amount Mark needs to pay in tax is $24,000. Finally, we need to add the registration fee of $1000 for each motor. This gives us a total cost of:

$240,000 + $24,000 + (12 x $1000) = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark needs to pay for everything is $276,000."
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, who collected 20 shells. So, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday. On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday. Therefore, she collected 2 x 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that there were 50 bees found in half of the apple orchard, and we want to find out how many insects are in the entire garden. Since ""half"" means 50% of something, we can start by multiplying 50 (the number of bees) by 2 (to get the total percentage):

50 x 2 = 100

Now we have our first clue: there are 100 bees in half of the garden. To find out how many insects are in the whole garden, we need to multiply this number by 4 (since there are four parts or quarters in a whole):

100 x 4 = 400

So, there are approximately 400 insects in the entire apple orchard!"
Response:  If there are 36 pikkewyne and one-third of them (12) jump into the sea to swim, then there are 36 - 12 = 24 pikkewyne left. Of these, another third (8) go into the cave to eat their food, leaving 24 - 8 = 16 pikkewyne still outside to sunbathe. So, there are 16 pikkewyne left to sunbathe.
Response:  We know that Steve eats 6 tamales per day and his friend eats 2 tamales per day. So, if they both eat the same amount of tamales every day, then Steve will eat twice as much as his friend does. Therefore, we can say that Steve eats 2 x 2 = 4 more tamales than his friend each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve will eat a total of 4 x 7 = 28 more tamales than his friend in one week. Now, let's convert this to the number of chili pepper plants needed. If a chili pepper plant produces 3 tamales per week, then we need 28 / 3 = 9 chili pepper plants to produce enough tamales for Steve.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend will get 4 slices of pizza. Since pizzas come in 8 slices per pie, we can calculate how many pizzas John needs as follows:

20 friends x 4 slices/friend = 80 slices total
80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John should order 10 pizzas."
Response:  If Ram uses five cheap pens and mixes their ink to make one full pen, then he can create five new pens with the mixed ink. So, if he buys 25 pens and wants to make new pens when the ink runs out, he will have 25 x 5 = 125 new pens in total.
"Response:  If Johnny had $20 and added $10, he would have $30. If this amount tripled in one year, then it would be:

$30 x 3 = $90

So, after one year, Johnny would have $90."
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jessa. So we can start with the age of Joan:
Joan = 20 (given)
Mary = Joan - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18
Jessa = Mary + 5 = 18 + 5 = 23
So the sum of their ages is:
Joan + Mary + Jessa = 20 + 18 + 23 = 61"
"Response:  We know that there are 1000 students in total and 30% of them leave through exit door A. That means 300 students leave through exit door A (1000 x 0.3). Now we need to find out how many students leave through each of the other two exits. Since 3/5 of the remaining students leave through exit B, we can calculate this as follows:  
(2/5) x 700 = 460 (students leaving through exit B)  
(1/5) x 700 = 140 (students leaving through exit C) Therefore, 460 + 140 = 600 students leave through exit C."
"Response:  We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, and John has twice as many candies as Robert. So if we let R be the number of candies Robert has, then James has R + 6 and John has 2R. Now, we are told that Johannes has 54 candies. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

R + (R + 6) + 2R = 54

Combine like terms:

3R + 6 = 54

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3R = 48

Divide by 3:

R = 16

So Robert has 16 candies. Now, we can find out how many more candies Johannes has than Robert:

Johannes has 54 - 16 = 38 more candies than Robert."
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they have three books (2 + 1 = 3). At the end of the day, if they both read their own books and also each other's books, then they will have collectively read a total of four books (3 + 1 = 4).
Response:  We know that Mike writes two letters per week to each of his five friends, and each letter takes him six minutes to write. So, in total, he spends 2 x 5 x 6 = 60 minutes writing letters per week.
Response:  We know that Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. He makes 15-minute calls to his boss every day, so he uses 15 x 30 = 450 minutes for those calls. That leaves him with 1000 - 450 = 550 minutes for other calls. Since he had 300 extra minutes this month, we can add that to the total number of minutes he used: 550 + 300 = 850 minutes. So, Jason used 850 minutes over the past 30 days.
"Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 potatoes and Kyle took 5 of them. That means Griffin has 19 potatoes left (24 - 5 = 19). Then, Billy took twice as many potatoes as Kyle took, so he took 2 x 5 = 10 potatoes from Griffin. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 potatoes left. Next, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of potatoes, but we don't know how many yet. Finally, Colby took 3 fewer potatoes than Kyle took, so he took 3 less than 5 = 2 potatoes from Griffin. So, Griffin has 9 + 2 = 11 potatoes left at the end. Since Ginger gave Griffin a handful of potatoes, let's say she gave him half of his remaining potatoes (since ""handful"" is not a specific amount). Half of 11 is 5.5, so Ginger gave Griffin 5.5 potatoes."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 sloths in one aquarium and 32 sloths in another aquarium. The difference between the number of sloths in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can set up an equation based on this information. 
Let x be the number of fish in each aquarium. Then we can write:
x + x = 4 + 32
2x = 36
x = 18
So, there are 18 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  We know that Jean gets paid $250 per hour and she works for 6 hours every day (4 days a week) for 5 weeks. That means she works a total of 6 x 4 = 24 days. So her total earnings for the project would be: 

$250/hour x 24 days = $6,000

Now, we need to subtract the 10% discount given by the makeup artist. 

$6,000 x 10% = $600

So, Jean will pay $6,000 - $600 = $5,400 for the makeup services."
Response:  We know that Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 on her sister's birthday party supplies. She divided the cost into three equal parts with her two parents. So each person paid $96 / 3 = $32.
"Response:  We know that each bag of flour costs $1.50 and there are four bags in total. So, to find out how much the chef spent, we need to multiply the cost per bag by the number of bags purchased:

$1.50 x 4 = $6.00

Therefore, the chef spent $6.00 on the four bags of flour."
Response:  We know that Sue eats four times more cookies than her sister on Monday and two times more on Tuesday. So let's start with Monday's consumption first. If she eats four times more cookies than her sister, then her sister eats 1 cookie (since we are looking for an exact number), and Sue eats 4 cookies. Now, each cookie contains 200 calories, so Sue consumes 4 x 200 = 800 calories on Monday. On Tuesday, her sister eats 13 cookies, and since Sue eats twice as much, she eats 26 cookies (13 + 13). The total calorie intake for Sue on Tuesday is therefore 26 x 200 = 5200 calories. In total, Sue consumed 800 + 5200 = 6000 calories more than her sister over the two days.
