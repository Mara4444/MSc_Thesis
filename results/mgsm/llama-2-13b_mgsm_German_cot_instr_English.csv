"Response: 

1. How many eggs does Janet have left after eating three in the morning?

16 - 3 = 13

So, Janet has 13 eggs left.

2. How many muffins can she bake with four eggs per day?

4 x 13 = 52

Janet can bake 52 muffins per day.

3. How much money will she earn from selling the remaining eggs at $2 per egg on the farmers market?

13 x 2 = 26

Janet will earn $26 per day from selling the eggs.

Therefore, her total daily income from both muffin sales and egg sales is:

52 x $2 = $104 + $26 = $130

Janet takes $130 per day on the farmers market."
Response:  We know that one dress requires 2 knots of blue wool and half as much white wool. So if we want to calculate how many knots of blue wool are needed in total, we can start with the fact that half as much white wool is required. Therefore, for every 2 knots of blue wool, we need 1 knot of white wool. Since we need 2 knots of blue wool, we will also need 2 knots of white wool. In summary, we need 2 + 2 = 4 knots of blue wool and 2 knots of white wool.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Josh paid for the house and then add the cost of repairs. Then we can find out how much he spent in total. Finally, we can divide that number by the original price to get the percentage increase. Here's the calculation:

Josh paid $80,000 for the house + $50,000 in repairs = $130,000 (total amount spent)

To find the percentage increase, we divide the total amount spent by the original price:

$130,000 / $80,000 = 1.625 or 162.5%

So, Josh made a profit of 162.5%."
"Response:  We know that James runs three times per week and each run is 60 meters long. So, if we multiply 3 (runs) x 60 (meters per run), we get...

180 meters per week!"
"Response:  We know that Wendi feeds her chickens three times a day and each meal consists of 3 buckets of mixed chicken feed (containing seeds, mealworms, and vegetables). In the morning, she gives them 15 buckets of food, and in the afternoon, she gives them another 25 buckets. To calculate how many buckets of food she needs for the last meal of the day, we need to divide the number of chickens by 3. Since there are 20 chickens in the flock, we can divide 20 by 3 to get:  

20 ÷ 3 = 6

So, Wendi needs 6 buckets of food for the last meal of the day."
"Response:  If one glass costs $5 and each additional glass is 60% of that price, then the cost of two glasses would be:  
2 x $5 = $10 + (2 x 60%) = $10 + $12 = $22  
The cost of three glasses would be:  
3 x $5 = $15 + (3 x 60%) = $15 + $36 = $51  
And so on...  
To find out how much Kylar needs to spend in total for 16 glasses, we can simply multiply the cost of one glass by 16:  
$5 x 16 = $80  
So, Kylar will need to spend $80 to buy 16 glasses."
"Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So if we can find out how many sheep Toulouse and Charleston have together, then we can add Seattle's number to get the total number of sheep for all three cities.  
First, let's calculate how many sheep Toulouse and Charleston have together:
Toulouse has 2x = 2 x (number of sheep in Charleston) = 2 x 4 = 8 more sheep than Charleston.
So, Toulouse has 8 + 4 = 12 sheep more than Charleston.
Therefore, Toulouse has 12 + 4 = 16 sheep, and Charleston has 4 x 4 = 16 sheep.
Now, let's add Seattle's number of sheep:
16 (Toulouse) + 16 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) =?
Solve for the unknown quantity:
32 + 20 = 52
Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together have 52 sheep."
"Response:  We know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute and there are 200 GB to be downloaded in total. So we can calculate how long it will take to download the file as follows:  

Time = Total Size / Download Rate  
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/min  
Time = 100 minutes  
Therefore, it will take Carla 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to download the entire file if she doesn't experience any interruptions or delays. However, since Windows requires a restart after installing updates, which takes 20 minutes, the actual time it takes for Carla to download the file will be longer."
"Response:  We know that John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour and then stops to turn around because he realizes he has forgotten something important at home. He spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, driving at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour during that time. Finally, he drives the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 80 miles per hour. To find out how far away from home John is after 4 hours, we need to calculate his total distance traveled.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled during the first 3 hours at 60 miles per hour:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 60 miles/hour x 3 hours
= 180 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled during the last 2 hours at 30 miles per hour:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 30 miles/hour x 2 hours
= 60 miles

Now, let's add the two distances together to get the total distance traveled:

Total Distance = 180 miles + 60 miles
= 240 miles

Finally, since John spent 2 hours stuck in traffic, we need to subtract that time from the total distance traveled to find out how far away from home he is at the end of the 4 hours:

Distance Away From Home = Total Distance - Time Spent in Traffic
= 240 miles - 2 hours
= 240 miles - 120 miles
= 120 miles

Therefore, John is 120 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
"Response:  We know that Eliza works for 40 hours at $10 per hour, so she earns:  
40 hours x $10/hour = $400  
Now we need to calculate the amount she earns for the additional 5 hours (overtime). Since overtime is paid at 1.2 times the regular rate, we can multiply her regular rate of $10/hour by 1.2 to get the overtime rate:  
$10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour  
So, the total amount Eliza earns for the 5 overtime hours is:  
5 hours x $12/hour = $60  
Adding this to what she earned for the first 40 hours gives us her total weekly earnings:  
$400 + $60 = $460"
Response:  We know that in the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times. In the second month, it was downloaded three times as many times as in the first month, which means it was downloaded 180 times (3 x 60). Finally, in the third month, there was a 30% decrease from the previous month, which means the number of downloads was 180 - 30% of 180 = 126. Therefore, the total number of downloads during these three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466.
"Response:  We know that there are three types of baked goods: donuts, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes. So we need to calculate the total cost for each type separately. Then we add up all these costs to get the overall total.

Donuts: 3 dozen x $68/dozen = $204
Mini Cupcakes: 2 dozen x $80/dozen = $160
Mini Cheesecakes: 6 dozen x $55/dozen = $330
Total Cost: $204 + $160 + $330 = $794

So the total cost is $794."
"Response:  We know that Carlos plants a lemon tree and it costs $90 to plant it. Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, which he sells for $1.50 per piece. Additionally, it costs $3 per year to water and fertilize the tree. To find out how many years it takes for Carlos to earn money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost over time.

Yearly Revenue:
7 lemons/year x $1.50/lemon = $10.50/year (total revenue)

Yearly Cost:
$90 (planting cost) + $3/year (maintenance cost) = $12/year (total cost)

Now, let's calculate the break-even point, which is the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost:

Break-Even Point:
$10.50/year (revenue) - $12/year (cost) = $1.50/year (break-even point)

To find out how many years it takes for Carlos to reach the break-even point, we can divide the break-even point by the annual revenue:

Number of Years to Break-Even:
$1.50/year (break-even point) / $10.50/year (revenue) = 14.38 years (approximately)

Therefore, it will take approximately 14.38 years for Carlos to earn back the initial investment of planting the lemon tree and start making a profit."
"Response:  We know that Melanie has sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, 2/3 in the red house, and half of the remaining ones in the orange house. So, if she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can start by finding out how many she had initially.

Let x be the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had. Since she sold 1/3 of them in the green house, she has (x/3) vacuum cleaners there now. Similarly, since she sold 2/3 of them in the red house, she has (2x/3) vacuum cleaners there now. And since she sold half of the remaining ones in the orange house, she has (x/2) vacuum cleaners there now.

Now we have three equations based on the information given:

1. (x/3) + (2x/3) + (x/2) = 5
2. (x/3) > 0 (since she didn't sell any negative vacuum cleaners)
3. (2x/3) > 0 (same as above)
4. (x/2) > 0 (same as above)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 8

So, Melanie had 8 vacuum cleaners initially."
"Response:  We know that 20% of the students have signed up for contemporary dance and 25% of the remaining students (i.e., those who did not sign up for contemporary dance) have signed up for jazz dance. This means that the total number of students signing up for either contemporary or jazz dance is:

20% x 20 = 4
+ 25% x (20 - 4) = 25% x 16 = 4

Total number of students signing up for either contemporary or jazz dance = 4 + 4 = 8

So, the percentage of students who have signed up for hip hop is:

(Number of students signing up for hip hop / Total number of students) x 100
= (20 - 8) / 20 x 100
= 12 / 20 x 100
= 60%

Therefore, 60% of all students have signed up for hip hop."
"Response:  We know that the value of the jewelry is $5,000 and the value of the electronics is $8,000. The expected increase in the price of jewelry is 2.5% and for electronics it is 1.2%. So we need to calculate the potential gain from each option.  
For the jewelry option:
Gain = (5000 x 2.5%) = $125
For the electronics option:
Gain = (8000 x 1.2%) = $96
Now we have to compare these gains to see which one gives us the highest profit. In this case, the gain from the jewelry option is higher than the gain from the electronics option, so the best choice would be to buy the jewelry."
"Response:  We know that both trains leave San Rafael at the same time and travel west for 80 miles each day. So, if we let X be the distance traveled by Train A (in miles) and Y be the distance traveled by Train B (also in miles), then we can write the following equations based on the information given:

Day 1: Westward journey
X + Y = 80... (1) (both trains travel together for 80 miles)
Y = 80... (2) (Train B also travels 80 miles)

Day 2: Northward journey
X + Y = 150... (3) (total distance traveled by both trains is 150 miles)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (X and Y). Solving equation (2) for Y gives:

Y = 40... (4)

Substituting this value of Y into equation (3) gives:

X + 40 = 150... (5)

Solving for X gives:

X = 70... (6)

So Train A travels 70 miles on Day 1 and 40 miles on Day 2, while Train B travels 40 miles on Day 1 and 70 miles on Day 2."
"Response:  We know that Jill works for 50 weeks per year and earns $20/hour as a teacher and $30/hour as a cheerleading coach. She spends 35 hours per week teaching and 15 hours per week coaching. So let's calculate her total weekly income first:

Teaching income: 35 hours x $20/hour = $700 per week
Cheerleading coaching income: 15 hours x $30/hour = $450 per week
Total weekly income: $700 + $450 = $1,150 per week

Now, let's multiply her weekly income by the number of weeks she works in a year (50):

Annual income from teaching: $1,150 x 50 weeks = $57,500 per year
Annual income from cheerleading coaching: $1,150 x 50 weeks = $57,500 per year
Total annual income: $57,500 + $57,500 = $115,000 per year"
Response:  If Claire eats an omelette with 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, then she consumes 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she eats a total of 21 x 4 = 84 eggs within a month. Therefore, within 4 weeks (or 1 month), Claire eats approximately 84 eggs.
"Response:  We know that Marissa has already walked for 4 miles in the first hour and another 2 miles in the second hour. So she has covered a total distance of 4 + 2 = 6 miles. Since she wants to walk a total distance of 12 miles, we can set up the equation:  

6 = 4 + x  

where x is the number of miles left to cover. Solving for x, we get:  

x = 6 - 4  

x = 2  

So Marissa needs to cover the remaining 2 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour to complete her journey in 2 hours. Therefore, her average speed over the entire journey will be:  

average speed = total distance / time taken  
= 12 miles / 2 hours  
= 6 miles/hour"
Response:  We have 24 liters of the mixture of orange drink and water. If we add 15 liters of ananas drink to it, then we will have a total volume of 39 liters (24 + 15). Now, if we subtract the amount of orange drink that was spilled (1 liter), we get 38 liters as the final volume of the mixture. Since three-fifths of the mixture is ananas drink, we can find out how much water there is in the remaining 38 liters by multiplying 38 by 3/5 = 21 liters. So, there are 21 liters of water in the final mixture.
"Response:  We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so we can calculate his age when Samantha was born:
Raymond's age at Samantha's birth = 6 years ago + Samantha's current age
= 6 years ago + 31 years old
= 37 - 6
= 31 years old
Now, we know that Raymond had a son 23 years after he was born, so we can calculate the age of Raymond's son:
Age of Raymond's son = Age of Raymond at the time of Samantha's birth + 23 years
= 31 + 23
= 54 years old
Therefore, if Samantha is now 31 years old, then Raymond's son was born 54 years ago."
Response:  We know that Billy has 8 customers and his first 3 customers buy one DVD each. So he sells 3 DVDs to his first 3 customers. His next 2 customers buy two DVDs each, so he sells another 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs. Finally, his last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so he doesn't sell anything to them. In total, Billy sells 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs on Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that each hour the candle burns for 60 minutes and reduces its length by 2 centimeters. So if we calculate how many hours the candle burns from 13 to 17 o'clock, we get:

17 - 13 = 4 hours

Now we multiply this number of hours by 60 (minutes per hour) to find out how many minutes the candle burns:

4 x 60 = 240 minutes

Finally, we can calculate how much shorter the candle is after burning for these 240 minutes:

240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

So the candle is 4 hours or 240 minutes shorter after burning from 13 to 17 o'clock."
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book and there was a 25% discount. So we can start with the original price of the book.

Let x be the original price of the book. Then we know that Kyle paid $19.50, which is 75% of the original price (since 25% is the discount).

So we can set up an equation based on this information:

$19.50 = 0.75x

Now solve for x to find out the original price of the book:

$19.50 / 0.75 = x

x = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26 before the 25% discount."
"Response:  We know that Marie has paid $50 in total and she has ordered chicken, milk, apples, and pizza. So we can start by adding up the cost of each item:

Chicken: 12 x $12 = $144 (since there are 12 pieces)
Milk: 5 x $3 = $15
Apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
Pizza:? (we don't know yet)

Total cost so far: $144 + $15 + $6 = $165

Now, we know that Marie has paid $50 in total, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

$165 - $50 =?

Solving for the missing amount, we get:

$165 - $50 = $115

So Marie has bought 115 dollars worth of pizza. Since each schachtel costs $8.50, Marie has bought:

115 / $8.50 = 13 schachtels

Therefore, Marie has bought 13 schachtels of pizza."
"Response:  We know that Mishka has bought three pairs of shorts, three pairs of pants, and three pairs of shoes. So we can start by adding up how much each item costs:  
Shorts: 3 x $16.50 = $49.50 
Pants: 3 x $22.50 = $67.50 
Shoes: 3 x $42 = $126 
Now let's add all these amounts together to find out how much Mishka spent in total: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243. Total amount spent by Mishka = $243."
"Response:  We know that Cynthia consumes one portion of ice cream per evening and buys cartons with 15 portions each for $4.00 per carton. To find out how much she has spent on ice cream over 60 days, we need to calculate how many cartons she would have bought during this period.  

First, let's convert the number of days from 60 to weeks:

60 days = 60/7 = 8.6 weeks (since there are 7 days in a week)

Now, let's calculate how many cartons Cynthia would have bought during these 8.6 weeks:

8.6 weeks x 15 portions per carton = 129 portions (approximately)

Since Cynthia consumes one portion per evening, she would have consumed approximately 129 evenings' worth of ice cream over 60 days. Therefore, her expense on ice cream over 60 days can be calculated as follows:

129 evenings x $4.00 per evening = $516 (approximately)

So, Cynthia has spent around $516 on ice cream over 60 days."
"Response:  We know that Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike tour. His first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the tour (i.e., 45 miles from the start). To find out how many miles Henry rode between the two stops, we can subtract the distance to the first stop from the total distance of the tour:  

60 - 20 = 40 miles

So, Henry rode 40 miles between his first and second stops."
"Response:  We know that the two pairs of shoes have different prices: one pair costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much. So if we let x be the price of the first pair (which is $33), then the second pair must cost 2x = 2(33) = 66 dollars. Now, we are told that the total cost of both pairs together is five dollars less than the cost of the stilettos. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$33 + 66 = 5$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$99 = 5$

This means that the stilettos cost $99, and therefore the stiefel must cost $44 ($99 - $55)."
"Response:  We know that Darrel is 7 years old and Allen is 11 years older than Darrel. So if they are both currently 162 years old, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Darrel's age = 7
Allen's age = Darrel's age + 11

Now we want to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years. To do this, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages:

Darrel's new age = 7 + 10 = 17
Allen's new age = Darrel's new age + 11 = 17 + 11 = 28

So, in 10 years, Darrel will be 17 years old, and Allen will be 28 years old."
"Response:  We have three different estimates:

1. 80 (the first friend)
2. 20 more than half of 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 (the second friend)
3. 25% more than 100 = 100 x 1.25 = 125 (the third friend)

Now we need to find the average of these three numbers:

(80 + 100 + 125) / 3 = (265) / 3 = 88.33

So, the throughput estimation is approximately 88 Gummibärchen."
Response:  There are 7 days in a week and each day he spends 0.5 hours with each of the 10 dogs for a total of 10 x 0.5 = 5 hours per day spent caring for the dogs. Multiply that by 7 days to get the total number of hours per week spent caring for the dogs: 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.
"Response:  We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So if we let X be the number of silver coins, then the number of gold coins is X + 30. The total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

X + (X + 30) = 110

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2X + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:

2X = 80

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

X = 40

So there are 40 silver coins and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins."
"Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's jewelry pieces, so let's find out how many jewelry pieces Raymond has first. If Raymond has 40 jewelry pieces, then we can set up an equation as follows:  
Raymond has 40 jewelry pieces, and Aaron has 5 more than half of them. So, to find out how many jewelry pieces Aaron has, we need to find half of Raymond's jewelry pieces and add 5 to it.  
Half of 40 is 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewelry pieces. Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewelry pieces than Aaron, so we can subtract 2 from 25 to get the number of jewelry pieces Siobhan has:  
Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewelry pieces. Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewelry pieces."
"Response:  We know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike made 4 points. That means he scored 4/60 = 1/15 of the total number of points possible. Since he played for 40 minutes, we can calculate the total number of points as follows:  
Total points = (1/15) x 40 = 8 points."
Response:  If Terry eats 2 joghurts per day and there are 30 days in the month, then he will eat 60 joghurts within 30 days (2 x 30 = 60). Since each joghurt costs $5, then Terry will spend $60 x 5 = $300 on joghurts within 30 days.
"Response:  We know that John sold all of his Lego sets for $15 per set and he has $5 left over after buying video games. So we can start by calculating how much money he made from selling the Legos:

13 sets x $15/set = $195

Now we know that he spent $195 + $5 = $200 on video games. So we can calculate how many sets he had left over:

$200 - $195 = $5

Therefore, John has 5 Lego sets left over."
"Response:  We know that John runs for 3 hours on the first day and half of that time (i.e., 1.5 hours) on each of the other two days. So his total weekly running distance is:

3 hours/day x 3 days/week = 9 hours/week

Since he runs at a constant speed, we can calculate his average speed as follows:

Average speed = Total distance / Time taken
= 9 hours / 3 days
= 3 hours/day

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 3 hours per day or 9 hours per week."
"Response:  We know that Dana can run four times as fast as she walks, so if she runs at a speed of x miles per hour, she walks at a speed of x/4 miles per hour. Since she can jump with half her running speed, she jumps at a speed of x/2 miles per hour. Now we are given that she covers 3 miles in one hour while hopping, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x/2 = 3  
Now we need to find out how far Dana can travel in six hours if she spends two-thirds of the time walking and one-third of the time hopping. To do this, we will use a proportion to relate the distance traveled during each activity:  
Let d be the total distance traveled in six hours. Then we have:  
d = (2/3) \* (x/4) + (1/3) \* (x/2)  
Simplifying the expression:  
d = (2/3) \* x/4 + (1/3) \* x/2  
Solving for d:  
d = 2x/6 + x/2  
Combine like terms:  
d = 3x/2  
Therefore, Dana can cover a distance of 3x/2 miles within six hours if she spends two-thirds of the time walking and one-third of the time hopping."
Response:  We know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone, and Suzy's iPhone is one year old. So, Ben's iPhone is two years old. Now we need to find out how old Brandon's iPhone is compared to Ben's iPhone. We know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is four times two years old, which is eight years old.
"Response:  We know that without the Saphir-Edelstein, Polly can throw the golden spear 400 feet (ft) far. With the Saphir-Edelstein, she can throw it three times as far, which is 3 x 400 = 1200 ft. So, if we set up an equation based on this information, we get:

x + 1200 = 1000

Where x represents how many feet outside of the flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the golden spear. Solving for x gives us:

x = 200

So, Polly could stand 200 feet outside of the flames and still hit the dragon with the golden spear when she holds the Saphir-Edelstein."
"Response:  We know that each apple cake was cut into 8 pieces, so if there were 5 apple cakes, there would be a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple cake. At the end of the evening, there were 14 leftover pieces of apple cake. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

40 - 14 =?

Solving for the unknown quantity (in this case, the number of pieces taken by the guests), we get:

40 - 14 = 26

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of apple cake."
"Response:  We know that one serving of chips has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag. If we want to calculate how many grams of chips we can eat if our daily calorie goal is 2000 and we have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to do the following calculations:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips:
250 calories/serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories
2. Subtract the amount of calories we have already consumed (1800 - 1250) to find out how many calories we still have left for the day:
1800 - 1250 = 550 calories
3. Divide the remaining calories by the number of calories per serving to determine how much of the chips we can eat:
550 calories / 250 calories/serving = 2.2 servings or approximately 220g of chips.
Therefore, based on the given information, you can eat approximately 220g of chips if your daily calorie goal is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories."
"Response:  We know that Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax and the cost of the wax plus the dopes is $10 per pound. If he sells each candle for $2, then we need to find out how much net profit he will get if he makes and sells 20 candles.

First, let's calculate the total cost of making 20 candles:

Total Cost = Number of Candles x Cost Per Candle
= 20 x $2
= $40

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the revenue to find the net profit:

Net Profit = Revenue - Total Cost
= $80 (revenue) - $40 (total cost)
= $40

So, Charlie will make a net profit of $40 if he makes and sells 20 candles at $2 each."
"Response:  We know that Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 more articles than on Monday on Tuesday (i.e., she wrote 2 additional articles). So, on Tuesday, she wrote a total of 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday, i.e., 7 x 2 = 14 articles. Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles on these three days is:

Monday: 5 articles x 2 hours per article = 10 hours
Tuesday: 7 articles x 2 hours per article = 14 hours
Wednesday: 14 articles x 2 hours per article = 28 hours

Total time spent writing articles: 10 + 14 + 28 = 52 hours."
"Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-it-Notizzettel in her handbag before she went to work. She bought a pack of Post-it-Notizzettel during her commute and used some of them at work (220 tasses x 1 Notizzettel each = 220 Post-it-Notizzettel). So, if there are 23 Post-it-Notizzettel left over, we can subtract this number from the original amount that Candice had:  
80 - 23 = 57. Therefore, there were 57 Post-it-Notizzettel in the pack that Candice bought."
"Response:  We know that John has spent $200 for blue ties and each blue tie costs $40. So he has bought:

$$ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 $$

Now we need to find out how many red ties he has bought. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, their price is:

$$ \text{Price of red ties} = 1.5 \times \$40 = \$60 $$

So, if John has spent $\$200$ on blue ties, he would have spent:

$$ \text{Total amount spent} = 5 \times \$60 + 2 \times \$40 = \$300 + \$80 = \$380 $$

Therefore, John has spent $\$380$ in total."
"Response:  We know that Tracy used a 4-foot long piece of wire to support her tomato plants, and she cut it into pieces that are each 6 inches long. So we can start with the fact that the total length of all the pieces is equal to the length of the original piece:

4 feet = 48 inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot)

Now, since each piece is 6 inches long, we can divide the total number of pieces by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces there are:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

So Tracy had 8 pieces of wire, each one 6 inches long."
"Response:  We know that there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. So, we can start with this information to calculate the total number of apartments in the building:  
15 floors x 8 apartments per floor = 120 apartments  
Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that only 3/4 of the apartments are inhabited. To find out how many apartments are unoccupied, we can multiply the total number of apartments by the fraction of occupied apartments:  
120 apartments x (3/4) = 90 apartments  
So, there are 90 apartments in the building that are unoccupied."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 days in one week and each day, Lloyd sells 252 eggs at $2 per dozen. So, he sells:

252 eggs x 14 days = 3648 eggs per week

At $2 per dozen, he earns:

3648 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 304 dozen eggs per week

So, Lloyd earns:

304 dozen eggs x $2 per dozen = $608 per week"
"Response:  We know that Tom covers 10 miles per hour while sailing and 6 miles per hour while driving back. To find out how long it takes him to return, we need to calculate the time for each leg of his journey separately.  
Firstly, he sails from 13:00 to 16:00, which is 3 hours. During this period, he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles
Now, let's calculate the time required for the drive back:
Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours
Therefore, in total, Tom needs 8 hours (3 hours + 5 hours) to complete both legs of his journey."
Response:  We know that Uriah has to remove 15 pounds from his backpack and we also know how much each item in his backpack weighs. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, so if he removes 30 of them, they will add up to 7 1/2 pounds (30 x 1/4 = 7 1/2). That means he needs to remove an additional 7 1/2 pounds from his backpack to reach the target weight of 15 pounds. Since his game pieces weigh 1/2 pound each, he would need to remove 15 / 1/2 = 30 game pieces to reach the target weight.
"Response:  The mechanic has made more money on Friday because he repaired more tires and charged less for each tire. So we need to calculate how much money the mechanic has earned on Friday.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 autos and no last wagon tires, so the total amount of money earned from auto tires is:

12 x $40 = $480

Since there were no last wagon tires repaired on Friday, the total amount of money earned that day is:

$480

So, the mechanic has made more money on Friday with the higher sales volume."
"Response:  We know that each of the two mothers (Patchy and Trixie) has kittens. So we can start with what they have:

* Patchy has 3 times as many kittens as the adopted ones (7). That means she has 3 x 7 = 21 kittens.
* Trixie has 12 kittens.

Now let's add up all the kittens: 21 + 12 = 33 kittens in total.
So the Doubtfires now have 33 kittens at home!"
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 lollipops and eats 2 of them. That means he has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. Now, we want to pack these remaining lollipops into bags with 2 each. So, how many bags can Jean fill? To find out, divide the number of lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag: 28 / 2 = 14 bags. Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops each.
"Response:  We know that Peter has $42$ dollars for the week and he spends $7$ dollars each time he goes to the movies (for the ticket) and $7$ dollars each time he buys popcorn. So we can start by calculating how many times he can go to the movies with his budget of $42$ dollars:

$$ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total amount available}}{\text{Cost per trip}} $$

In this case, the cost per trip is $14$ dollars ($7$ dollars for the ticket + $7$ dollars for the popcorn). Therefore:

$$ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{42}{14} = 3 $$

So Peter can go to the movies three times with his budget of $42$ dollars."
"Response:  We know that each crate weighs 15 pounds and there are x crates in total. So the total weight of all the crates is 15x pounds. The maximum weight that the bridge can bear is 5000 pounds, so we set up the following equation:  

15x + 3755 = 5000

Solving for x, we get:

x = 267

So the truck can carry 267 crates without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge."
"Response:  We know that the total cost of the groceries was $40.00 and the delivery fee was $3.00 (25% of $40.00). So we can calculate the total cost as follows:

$40.00 + $3.00 = $43.00

Now, Stephen gave a tip of $4.00, so we need to subtract that from the total cost:

$43.00 - $4.00 = $39.00

Therefore, the end price for Stephen's groceries after all extra fees was $39.00."
"Response:  We know that each cluster of grapes has 20 fruits and there are 6 clusters in total. So we can calculate how many grapes there are in total as follows:  
6 x 20 = 120 grapes. 
Now let's talk about the individual fruits scattered over the bush. There are 67 single fruits in total. If we divide this number by the number of clusters (6), we get an average of 11 fruits per cluster that are not part of any cluster. Therefore, we add 11 to our previous result:  
120 + 11 = 131 grapes. 
So there are 131 grapes in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 oranges in total and we have to subtract the ones that are bad, unripe, and sour. So, first, let's calculate how many oranges are bad, unripe, and sour:

* 1 is bad (1/25)
* 20% of 25 is 5 (unripe)
* 2% of 25 is 1 (sour)

So, in total, there are 1 + 5 + 1 = 7 oranges that are not good. Therefore, there are 25 - 7 = 18 oranges that are good."
"Response:  We know that Janet paid $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler to create the brooch. That means she spent a total of $500 + $800 = $1300. Then, we are told that she paid an additional 10% of this amount as insurance. To find out how much she paid for insurance, we can multiply $1300 by 10%, which gives us:

$1300 x 0.10 = $130

So, in total, Janet paid $1300 + $130 = $1430 for the brooch."
"Response:  We know that Marcy will receive $50,000 per year for 40 years, so her total earnings over those 40 years would be:

$50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000

Now, we also know that after 20 years, she will receive 5% of the value of her annual pension each year. So, if she retires after 30 years, she will have received 10 years of this additional benefit.

To calculate the amount of this benefit, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the final amount, P is the principal (the initial amount), r is the rate of interest (in this case, 5%), and n is the number of periods (in this case, 10 years).

So, the amount Marcy receives after 20 years is:

A = $2,000,000 x (1 + 0.05)^10 = $2,600,000

Now, we need to subtract this amount from Marcy's total earnings to find out how much she will receive annually after retiring:

$2,000,000 - $2,600,000 = -$600,000

This means that Marcy's annual pension after retiring will be negative $600,000. However, since it is unlikely that a company would offer a negative pension, we can assume that the actual amount will be zero or some other positive amount. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Marcy's annual pension after retiring will be approximately $0 or some other positive amount."
"Response:  We know that the monthly subscription fee is $140 and we also know that for the first half of the year (6 months), they will be charged the original amount. So, for the first six months, the total cost would be:

$140 x 6 = $840

Now, for the second half of the year (6 months), they will be charged 10% less than the original amount. So, the total cost for the second half of the year would be:

$840 x 0.9 = $756

Therefore, the total amount that Aleena will pay for the entire year is:

$840 + $756 = $1,596"
"Response:  We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles since her last fill-up and needed to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill her tank completely. This means she used 100 - 4 = 96 gallons of gasoline so far. Since there are 12 gallons in her tank, we can calculate how many miles she can drive with one fill-up as follows:  

12 gallons / 96 gallons used = (12/96) x 100 miles = 40% of the total distance she can travel with one fill-up. 

Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 40% of 100 miles = 40 miles more after filling up her tank once."
"Response:  We know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half an hour before going to bed. He does this three times a week. So, let's start with calculating his total time spent watching TV per week:  

2 hours/day x 3 days/week = 6 hours/week

Now, we need to calculate how many weeks he watches TV and reads for 3 months (12 weeks). To do this, divide the number of weeks by 4:  

12 weeks / 4 = 3 months

So, Jim spends 3 months (or 12 weeks) watching TV and reading for 30 minutes each day. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends on these activities is:  

6 hours/week x 12 weeks = 72 hours

Therefore, Jim spends 72 hours watching TV and reading over the course of 3 months."
Response:  Each school has two teams - one for boys and one for girls. So each school has 2 x 5 = 10 players. Since there are four schools, we have 4 x 10 = 40 players in total. Additionally, each school has one trainer for each team, so we have 4 x 2 = 8 trainers. Therefore, the total number of persons sent by the schools to the tournament is 40 + 8 = 48.
"Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds and twice as many smaragdes as rubies. So we can start with these numbers:

Diamonds: 175
Smaragds: 2 x 35 = 70
Rubies: 35

Now let's add up all the numbers to find out how many edelstones are in total:

175 + 70 + 35 = 280

So, there were 280 edelstones in the treasure chest!"
Response:  If there are twice as many boys as girls, then for every girl, there is one boy. So if there are 60 girls, there are 60 x 2 = 120 boys. Since each class has 5 students, we need 120 / 5 = 24 teachers.
"Response:  We know that Bailey starts with some initial amount of money and receives $5 per week for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the initial amount of money Bailey had at the beginning (x is the unknown quantity).

We know that after 8 weeks, Bailey will have received a total of $5 x 8 = 40 dollars in weekly payments.

So the total amount of money Bailey has at the end of the 8 weeks is:

x + 40 = 100

Solving for x, we get:

x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 days in one week and each day has different number of courses. On Monday to Friday, she teaches 4 courses per day, so for those 5 days, she teaches a total of 4 x 5 = 20 courses. On Saturday, she teaches 8 courses. So, in total, she teaches 20 + 8 = 28 courses within one week.  
Now we need to calculate how much money she makes from all these courses. Since each course has 15 students and she charges $15 per student, her revenue can be calculated as follows:
Revenue = Number of Students x Price Per Student
= 15 x 15 (per student)
= 225 (per course)
= 225 x 28 (total courses)
= $6,300 (within one week)"
Response:  We know that the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. So, if we multiply 20 by 2, we get 40. Therefore, the second recipe has 40 instructions in total. To prepare both recipes, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.
"Response:  We know that Tommy sells brownies for $3 each and cheesecake pieces for $4 each. So if he sells x brownies and y cheesecake pieces, his total revenue will be:

3x + 4y dollars

We also know that Tommy sold a total of 43 brownies and 23 cheesecake pieces. So we can substitute these values into our equation to find out how much money he made:

3(43) + 4(23) =?

Do you see how to solve this problem now?"
"Response:  We know that Sheila bought five phones for $150 each with a three-month installment plan and an interest rate of 2%. To find out how much she will pay each month, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay over three months.

Total Amount = (Number of Phones x Price per Phone) + (Interest Charges x Number of Months)
= (5 x $150) + ($150 x 2% x 3)
= $750 + ($45)
= $895

Now, let's divide the total amount by the number of months to get the monthly payment:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
= $895 / 3
= $298.33

So, Sheila will pay $298.33 every month for three months to cover the cost of the phones and the interest charges."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Artie would have made if he had sold all of his flowers at their original prices. Then we can add up the amounts to find out how much he has earned in total.  
Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Artie would have made selling each type of flower at its original price.  
Ringelblumen: 12 Töpfe x $2.74/Topf = $33.04  
Petunien: 9 Töpfe x $1.87/Topf = $16.83  
Begonien: 17 Töpfe x $2.12/Topf = $35.34  
Total: $33.04 + $16.83 + $35.34 = $85.21  
Step 2: Add up the amounts to find out how much Artie has earned in total. Answer: $85.21"
"Response:  We know that each floor of the sandcastle has half as much area as the one below it. So if we start with an upper floor of 16 square meters and work our way down, we can find out how big each lower floor is. Here's the calculation:  
Floor 4 (upper): 16 square meters  
Floor 3: Half of 16 = 8 square meters  
Floor 2: Half of 8 = 4 square meters  
Floor 1: Half of 4 = 2 square meters  
Average floor area: (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square meters  
So the average floor area of the four-story sandcastle is 30 square meters."
"Response:  We know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy with 1 tasse (t) of food per day during the first 180 days, and then she will need to feed him with 2 tasses (t) of food per day for the rest of his life. So we can write an equation based on this information:

First 180 days:

1 tasse/day x 180 days = 180 tasses

Rest of the dog's life:

2 tasses/day x (number of days left in the year) = (2 x number of days left in the year) tasses

We know that there are 365 days in a year, so we can substitute this value into our equation:

2 tasses/day x 365 days = 730 tasses

Now, let's find out how many trays of food Cecilia will use in the first year. Each tray contains 110 portions, so we can divide the total number of portions by the number of portions per tray:

730 tasses / 110 portions/tray = 6.64 trays

Therefore, Cecilia will use approximately 6.64 trays of food in the first year."
Response:  We know that Sarah washes 4 times as much laundry as David, and Raymond washes half as much laundry as Sarah. So if Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry, we can start by finding out how much laundry Raymond would wash. Since he washes half as much as Sarah, he would wash 200 pounds of laundry (half of 400). Now, let's find out how much laundry David would wash. Since he is washed 4 times as much as Raymond, he would wash 800 pounds of laundry (4 x 200). Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash is 600 pounds (800 - 200).
"Response:  If he buys 18 flowers at $2.50 per pack of 3, then he will spend:

$2.50 x 6 = $15

If he buys 2 packs of 3 for $2.50 each, he will save:

$2.50 - $1.50 = $1

So, he saves $1 x 6 = $6."
"Response:  The cost of the session at the dog groomer is $100 (given). If there is a discount of 30%, then we can calculate the amount saved as follows:

$100 x 30% = $30

So, the total amount paid for the session will be:

$100 - $30 = $70

Therefore, the sitting at the dog groomer costs $70."
Response:  We know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters each, which is equal to 24 / 6 = 4 liters each. So they got a total of 4 + 4 = 8 liters. Then, a boy received 6 liters, and we need to find out how much water was left over. To do this, we subtract the amount he received from the total amount available: 24 - 6 = 18 liters. Therefore, there were 18 liters of water left over.
Response:  First, we know that Charlie had 10 stickers to start with. Then he bought 21 more at the store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. Next, he received 23 stickers as a birthday gift, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. Finally, he gave his sister 9 of those stickers and used 28 to decorate a greeting card, leaving him with 54 - 9 - 28 = 17 stickers left over. So, Charlie has 17 stickers left over.
Response:  We know that Alex weighs less than four times as much as Grace because he is only two pounds lighter. So if Grace weighs x pounds, then Alex will weigh 4x - 2 pounds. Now let's substitute in the given weight for Grace: x = 125 pounds. Therefore, Alex weighs 4(125) - 2 = 490 - 2 = 488 pounds. Together, they weigh 125 + 488 = 613 pounds.
"Response:  We know that each rosebush has 25 roses and each rose has 8 thorns. So if we multiply 25 (roses per bush) x 8 (thorns per rose), we get:  
25 x 8 = 200 thorns per bush. 
Since there are three rosebushes, we can multiply 200 (thorns per bush) x 3 (number of bushes):  
200 x 3 = 600 thorns in total."
"Response:  We know that the team has played 22 games and have won 8 more than they lost. So if we let W be the number of wins, then the number of losses is 8 less than the number of wins. In other words, L = W - 8.
Now we can set up an equation based on this information:
W + (L) = 22... (1)
We also know that the number of wins is greater than the number of losses, so we can write:
W > L... (2)
Substituting (2) into (1), we get:
W + (W - 8) = 22
Combine like terms:
2W + 8 = 22
Subtract 8 from both sides:
2W = 14
Divide both sides by 2:
W = 7
So the team has won 7 games."
"Response:  We know that Gene has been making decks for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11). He makes four trips per year, so he has made:

4 x 11 = 44 decks

Each deck is composed of abschnitte from one year's worth of t-shirts, so there are:

44 decks x 4 abschnitte/deck = 176 abschnitte

Therefore, Gene has 176 abschnitte in total."
"Response:  The first time the alarm went off, it rang four times. The second time, it rang three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang half as long as the second time. So we can start with the following equation:

4 + (3 x 2) + (1/2 x 3) =?

Solving for the equation, we get:

4 + 6 + 1.5 =?

Adding all the numbers up, we get:

11.5 =?

Therefore, the total number of times the alarm rang was 11.5 times."
Response:  If Sylvie has been working for the company for exactly five years (as of last December), her current salary is $600 x 1.10 = $660 per month. After three more years, her salary will be $660 x 1.10 x 1.10 = $732 per month.
"Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harald. So if Marilyn sold x records, then Harald sold 1/10 of x = 0.1x records. Since they together sold 88,000 records, we can set up the equation:

0.1x + x = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:

1.1x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 1.1:

x = 80,000

So Harald sold 80,000 records."
"Response:  We know that there will be 16 guests in total (including Christina), and we also know that 1/4 of them won't show up. So, if we divide 16 by 4, we get:

16 / 4 = 4

So, there will be 4 non-attending guests. Now, let's calculate how many gift bags Christina needs to buy for her attending guests:

16 - 4 = 12

Since each gift bag costs $2, Christina needs to spend:

12 x $2 = $24

Therefore, Christina needs to spend $24 on gift bags for her attending guests."
Response:  We know that an adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad and a young one half as much. So if there are 20 adults and 5 young ones, they will eat together 20 x 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad. Since each young one eats half as much, they will eat 5 x 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad. In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad to the picknic
"Response:  We know that Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. So if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets. Now we know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Cindy has x - 2 pets. Therefore, all three together have:

Jan (3x) + Marcia (x + 2) + Cindy (x - 2) =?

Let's substitute the values we know:

3x + x + 2 + x - 2 =?

4x + 2 =?

5x =?

So all three together have 5x pets."
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So we can start with these two pieces of information to figure out how old Amy is.
Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so if Jackson is x years old, then Amy is x + 5 years old.
Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey, so if Corey is y years old, then Amy is y - 2 years old.
Now we have two equations based on the given information:
Equation 1: Jackson's age = Amy's age - 5
Equation 2: Amy's age = Corey's age - 2
We are also given that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. So we can use this information to find Corey's age.
Corey's age = James's age + 1
Substituting this into Equation 2, we get:
Amy's age = (James's age + 1) - 2
Now we can solve for Jackson's age using Equations 1 and 2. First, substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:
Jackson's age = (Amy's age - 5) + 5
Substituting in Amy's age from Equation 2, we get:
Jackson's age = ((James's age + 1) - 2) + 5
Simplifying and solving for Jackson's age, we get:
Jackson's age = 7
So Jackson is 7 years old."
"Response:  We know that Lee runs the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds and Gerald has improved his speed by 10%. So if we want to find out how fast Gerald can run the 400 meters hurdles, we need to first calculate how much faster he is than Lee. To do this, we can use the following formula:

Gerald's time - Lee's time = (10% of Gerald's time) + (remainder of Gerald's time)

We are given that Lee takes 38 seconds to complete the race, so we can start by finding out how much faster Gerald is than Lee:

Gerald's time - Lee's time = (10% of Gerald's time) + (remainder of Gerald's time)
= (10/100 x Gerald's time) + (Gerald's time mod 100)
= (1 x Gerald's time/10) + (Gerald's time mod 10)

Now we need to determine what Gerald's time is. Since he has improved his speed by 10%, we know that his time will be 10% higher than Lee's time. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:

Gerald's time = Lee's time x 1.1

Substituting Lee's time into this equation gives us:

Gerald's time = 38 x 1.1
= 38 x 11/10
= 41.8

So Gerald can run the 400 meters hurdles in approximately 41.8 seconds."
Response:  We know that there are 60 dogs and each dog has two cats, so there are 2 x 60 = 120 cats. Additionally, we know that there are 12 times fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 12 x (60 + 120) = 720 rabbits. Therefore, there are a total of 60 dogs, 120 cats, and 720 rabbits in the neighborhood.
"Response:  We know that there are 200 students in the fifth grade and 2/5 of them are boys. That means there are 2 x 200 = 40 boys. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we get:  
200 - 40 = 160 
Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are at the Pfadfinderinnen. To find out how many girls are at the Pfadfinderinnen, we can multiply the total number of girls by 2/3:  
(200 - 40) x 2/3 = (160) x 2/3 = 80 
Therefore, there are 80 girls at the Pfadfinderinnen."
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for 2/3 of the time Harry did. So we can set up an equation based on this information.
Let H be the number of hours Harry slept.
Let J be the number of hours James slept.
We know that J = 2/3H (since James slept for 2/3 of the time Harry did)
Now we are given that H = 9 (Harry slept for 9 hours)
So we can substitute H = 9 into the equation J = 2/3H to get:
J = 2/3(9)
J = 6
Therefore, Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours.
To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we can subtract the amount of time James slept from the amount of time Harry slept:
9 - 6 = 3
So Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"Response:  We know that each 16-ounce package of tomatoes contains three tomatoes and that the final portion of tomato sauce yielded 32 ounces of sauce. Therefore, we can start by converting the weight of the tomatoes from ounces to pounds:  

16 oz = 1 lb (there are 16 ounces in 1 pound)

Now, we know that half of the weight of the tomatoes is lost during cooking. So, if Freda used 16 ounces of tomatoes, she actually used half of that amount, or 8 ounces:  

8 oz = 0.5 lb (there are 16 ounces in 1 pound)

Since each tomato weighs approximately 2/3 of a pound, we can calculate how many tomatoes Freda used based on the weight of the tomatoes:  

0.5 lb / (2/3 lb per tomato) = 3 tomatoes

Therefore, Freda used 3 tomatoes to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce."
"Response:  We know that there were originally 30 cars on the highway and 5 of them left before the traffic jam started. That means we have to subtract 5 from 30 to get the number of cars that were still on the road when the traffic jam started:

30 - 5 = 25

Now, we know that some cars passed through the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, but not all of them. We are told that ""some"" cars passed through, which means we can use the word ""some"" to represent a portion of the total number of cars. Let's say x cars passed through during the first 15 minutes (where x is a positive integer).

We also know that there were 20 more cars that passed through during the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam. This means that the total number of cars that passed through both periods is:

x + 20

Since 5 cars did not pass through the traffic jam at all, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of cars that passed through:

x + 20 - 5

To find out how many cars passed through during the first 15 minutes, we can solve for x:

x + 20 - 5 =?

Can you solve for x and tell me how many cars passed through during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam?"
Response:  We know that Mary has 40 fenster sims and she already has 2 topfpflanzen on each of them, so she has 40 x 2 = 80 topfpflanzen in total. Yesterday, she received 18 new topfpflanzen from her favorite nursery, so we can add 18 to 80: 80 + 18 = 98. Now, we know that Mary wants to give one topfpflanze from each of her 40 fenster sims to friends and family tomorrow, which means she will have to remove 40 x 1 = 40 topfpflanzen from her collection. So, after giving away all the topfpflanzen, Mary will have 98 - 40 = 58 topfpflanzen left.
"Response:  We know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door. The second friend pressed it more frequently than the first friend, so let's say they pressed it x times (where x is some number). Since the third friend pressed it 10 times more often than the fourth friend, we can write:

3x = 10 + 60

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3x = 70

Now, we know that the total number of doorbell presses is 20 + x + 10 + 60 = 100.

So, the answer to the question ""How many times has the doorbell rung?"" is:

100."
Response:  We know that Solo has to read in total 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages. He reads 15 pages on Monday, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read. To find out how many pages he needs to read per day, we divide the number of pages left to read (24) by the number of days he has left (4): 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day. So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days to finish all his reading.
"Response:  We know that John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (for breakfast, lunch, and dinner), which is equivalent to 21 glasses of water per week (since there are 7 days in a week). However, on weekends, he prefers to relax and replaces one of his daily glasses of water with lemonade, so he only drinks 6 glasses of water on Saturdays and Sundays. Therefore, John drinks a total of:

21 glasses of water x 5 weekdays = 105 glasses of water per week
+ 6 glasses of water x 2 weekend days = 12 glasses of water per week
= 117 glasses of water per week

So, John drinks approximately 117 glasses of water per week."
"Response:  We know that it takes the nebelschleier 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. So if we want to find out how many minutes it will take for him to cover the entire city, we need to divide the total length of the city (42 miles) by the distance he covers per minute (3 miles). This gives us:

42 miles / 3 miles/minute = 14 minutes

So the nebelschleier will need 14 minutes to cover the entire city."
Response:  If Poppy has laid out a quarter of the puzzle pieces and her mother has added another third of the remaining pieces, then together they have placed half of all the puzzle pieces (25% + 33%). So there are still half as many pieces left to be put in place (50%). Therefore, we need to add 50% of the total number of puzzle pieces to find out how many more pieces must be placed. The total number of puzzle pieces is 1000, so we multiply 1000 by 50% to get 500. Thus, 500 puzzle pieces remain to be placed.
Response:  We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. So if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody will eat 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. Together, they will have eaten 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.
"Response:  We know that each box has dimensions of 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches and the walls are 1 inch thick. So we need to calculate the volume of each box first and then add them up for all three boxes. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = lwh (where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height). Using this formula, we can calculate the volume of each box as follows:

Box 1: V = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches
Box 2: V = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches
Box 3: V = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches

Now, let's add up the volumes of all three boxes:

Total Volume = 120 + 120 + 120 = 360 cubic inches

So, the total volume of all three boxes together is 360 cubic inches."
"Response:  We know that Frankie has watched a total of 7 hours of TV. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched one hour each day, so that's 2 hours in total. On Wednesday, he watched some episodes of a 30-minute show, but we don't know how many yet. Thursday was an early night, so he only watched one more hour. Friday was also an early night, so he watched two hours. Now let's add up all the times he watched TV:  

2 + X + 2 = 7 

Where X is the number of 30-minute shows he watched on Wednesday. Solving for X gives us:  

X = 4 

So, on Wednesday, Frankie watched four 30-minute shows."
Response:  We know that Henry has baked 110 kekses this year and he wanted to bake twice as many as last year. So, if we divide 110 by 2, we get 55. Therefore, Henry baked 55 kekses last year.
Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gas at $3 per gallon, that would be $3 x 10 = $30. But then there is a $20 rebate from the app company, so the net cost would be $30 - $20 = $10 for 10 gallons of gas.
"Response:  We know that Beatrice had two rolls that were 24 rolls long each, so she had a total of 2 x 24 = 48 rolls. And Marcel had three rolls that were 14 rolls long each, so he had a total of 3 x 14 = 42 rolls. In total, they both had 48 + 42 = 90 rolls. If they eat all their fruit rolls, then they will have eaten an average of 90 / 2 = 45 rolls each."""
"Response:  We know that the boat had a leak and took in water at a rate of two liters for every ten feet it traveled. So if the boat traveled twenty feet (20 x 2 = 40 liters). Since Julia rowed the boat back to shore in sixteen seconds, we can calculate how far she went each second as follows: 

16/10 = 1.6 meters per second

We also know that the distance from the shore was sixty-four seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance traveled as follows:

64 / 1.6 = 40 meters

Therefore, when Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken in forty liters of water due to the leak."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 classes per day. So, in total, there will be 8 class periods per day (4 teachers x 2 classes per teacher). Since each class period lasts for 3 hours, we have a total of 24 hours of teaching per day (8 class periods x 3 hours per period). Now, since the table is wiped clean 3 times during each class period, the table will be wiped clean a total of 72 times per day (24 hours of teaching x 3 wipes per hour). Therefore, the table will be wiped clean once every 3 minutes."""
"Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers per day and 5 do not grow, then he will have planted a total of:

2 x 15 = 30 flowers

However, if 5 flowers do not grow, then he will only have 25 flowers that have grown."
"Response:  We know that Jamal's hand can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's hand. So if Brittany's hand can hold x photos, then Jamal's hand can hold 6x photos. 
We also know that the maximum number of photos that Brittany's hand can hold is 50 times higher than the number of ducks on Jamal's photo with the ducks at the zoo. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  
Let x be the number of photos that Brittany's hand can hold. Then we have:  
Now we are given that Jamal's hand can hold 1800 photos. So we can substitute this value into the previous equation:  
Solving for x, we get:  
Therefore, there are 36 ducks on Jamal's photo with the ducks at the zoo."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha will make from selling all of her remaining wood. To do this, we can multiply the number of each type of wood she has by its price per unit and add up the total amount she will receive for each type of wood.

For the 2x4x10 boards, there are 10 units x $10/unit = $100.
For the 4x4x10 boards, there are 5 units x $16/unit = $80.
In total, Sasha will receive $100 + $80 = $180.
So, if she sells all of her remaining wood, she will make a profit of $180 - $90 (the original cost) = $90."
"Response:  We know that Katy uses 7 teaspoons of tea leaves for every 13 cups of water she uses. So if she has used a total of 120 teaspoons of tea leaves and water, we can set up a proportion to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used:

Let x be the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used.
We know that 7x = 120 (total number of teaspoons of tea leaves and water)

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 120 / 7

x = 17

So Katy used 17 teaspoons of sugar."
Response:  If John has three children and each child needs two pairs of shoes, then he will need to buy six pairs of shoes in total (3 x 2 = 6). And since each pair costs $60, John will have to pay $60 x 6 = $360 for all six pairs of shoes.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 2 containers with 5 autos each, so the total number of autos at the port was 2 x 5 = 10. On the second day, more containers arrived and the total number of autos increased to 30. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Let X be the number of additional containers arriving on the second day. Since all containers have 5 autos each, the total number of autos added to the port is 5X. To find out how many autos were already present at the port before the second day, we subtract the initial number (10) from the total number after the second day (30):  

Total autos after second day - Initial autos = 30 - 10 = 20. Therefore, we can write an equation:  

5X + 20 = 30. Solving for X gives us:  

5X = 30 - 20 = 10. X = 2. So two more containers arrived on the second day, each containing 5 autos."
"Response:  We know that Adrian earned $40,000 four years ago and his salary increased by 30%. So, after four years, Adrian's salary would be:

$40,000 x 1.3 = $52,000

We also know that Lylah's salary is 30% lower than Adrian's current salary. So, if Adrian earns $52,000, then Lylah's salary would be:

$52,000 x 0.7 = $36,400

Therefore, the total combined salary of both Adrian and Lylah four years later is:

$52,000 + $36,400 = $88,400"
Response:  We know that Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week for his drawings. This means he uses 8 sheets (2 x 4 weeks) of paper per month. Since one sketchbook has 30 sheets of paper, Miguel will use 30/8 = 375 sheets of paper per month.
"Response:  We know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she brought a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. 
Kael brought double the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half as many oranges as Morisette, which is half of 8, or 4 oranges. So Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. 
Therefore, the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael is 13 + 14 = 27 fruits."
"Response:  We know that Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday and then 6 hours (2 hours less than Monday) on each of the next two days, so she slept for a total of:

8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours

Now, we are told that she slept for one hour more than this amount for the rest of the week, so we can add one hour to our previous total:

20 + 1 = 21 hours

Therefore, Sadie slept for a total of 21 hours during the week."
"Response:  We know that Rosie can run for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour and then for another 4 hours at 5 miles per hour. So we need to calculate how far she can go in each of those periods and add them up.  
For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour, so she covers:

10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, for the last 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour, so she covers:

5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles

Adding both distances gives us the total distance Rosie can cover in 7 hours:

30 + 20 = 50 miles"
Response:  If Jennie has to frank 60 letters and she has already franked 30 of them, then there are 60 - 30 = 30 letters left to be franked. Since Jennie has only franked one-third of the remaining letters (i.e., 1/3 x 30 = 10), there were originally 30 + 10 = 40 letters in the stack before Jennie started.
"Response:  We know that Julia bought a new pack of luffels and she used three to taste the soup. So, if we subtract 3 from the total number of luffels in the pack, we will get the remaining number of luffels.

Let X be the number of luffels in the pack that Julia bought.

We know that Julia used 3 luffels to taste the soup, so the number of luffels left is:
X - 3

Now, we are told that her husband also gave her 5 new luffels. So, the total number of luffels Julia has now is:
X - 3 + 5

Simplifying the equation:
X - 3 + 5 = 12

Solving for X:
X = 12 + 3
X = 15

Therefore, there were 15 luffels in the pack that Julia bought."
Response:  We know that Dylan has 38 Geflügelwürstchen and 6 more Fischwürstchen than Geflügelwürstchen. So if we subtract 38 from 6, we get... (wait for it)... 32! That means Dylan has bought a total of 32 Würstchen (38 Geflügel + 6 Fisch = 32).
"Response:  If Amy found 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily found 50 friends, then together they have:  
20 + 50 = 70 friends."
"Response:  We know that one watermelon costs three times as much as one paprika, so if we let x be the cost of one paprika, then the cost of one watermelon is 3x. We also know that an orange costs five times less than a watermelon, so if we let y be the cost of one orange, then the cost of one watermelon is 3y. Now we can set up an equation based on the information given:  

4 watermelons = 4(3x) = 12x 
20 paprikas = 20x 
10 oranges = 10(y) = 5y 
Total cost = 12x + 20x + 5y 
Simplifying and solving for x, we get: 

12x + 20x + 5y =? 
32x + 5y =? 
Solving for x, we get: 

x = 15$ 
So each paprika costs $15. Therefore, the total cost of all fruits is: 

12x + 20x + 5y = (3)(15) + (20)(15) + 5y = 45 + 300 + 5y = 345 + 5y 
Now solve for y to find out how much each orange costs: 

345 + 5y =? 
5y = 345 - 345 = 190 
y = 190/5 = 38 
Therefore, each orange costs $38. The total cost of all fruits is: 

345 + 5y = 345 + 5(38) = 345 + 190 = 535 
The entire amount spent by Dillon is $535."
"Response:  We need to calculate how much time each doctor spends with patients and then multiply that number by their hourly rate. Finally, we can add up all these amounts to find out how much profit the hospital makes from consultations.

Let X be the average time (in minutes) spent by doctors with patients. Since there are 500 patients per day, the total time spent by doctors is:

X x 500 = 500X

According to the problem, the hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so the revenue generated from consultations is:

500X x $200 = 100000X

Now, let Y be the hourly rate of the doctors ($150 in this case). The cost of providing consultation services is:

Y x 500 = 75000Y

Since the hospital wants to make a profit, we set up the following equation:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= 100000X - 75000Y

We want to maximize the profit, so we take the derivative of the above expression with respect to X:

d/dx Profit = d/dx [100000X - 75000Y]
= 100000 - 75000Y

Setting the derivative equal to zero and solving for X, we get:

X = 37.5 minutes

So, each patient is seen for approximately 37.5 minutes. Now, we can calculate the daily profit as follows:

Profit per day = 100000X x 500 = 100000 x 500 x 37.5 = 1875000

Daily profit = 1875000

Annual profit = Daily profit x 365 days = 1875000 x 365 = 69625000

Therefore, the annual profit of the hospital from consultations is approximately $69.6 million."
"Response:  We have 60 elves in total and we lose:

* A third (20) of them quit after children sit on them.
* Then, 10 more out of the remaining 40 elves quit after being kicked in the shins.

So, how many elves are left? To find this, we need to subtract the number of elves who quit from the original number:

60 - 20 = 40
40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 elves left!"
"Response:  We know that Joseph's expenses were $500 in May and $60 less in June. To find his total expenses for both months, we can add up these two amounts:

May: $500
June: $500 - $60 = $440
Total: $500 + $440 = $940

So Joseph's total expenses for May and June were $940."
Response:  First, we know that Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times. So together they rode it six times (2 + 4 = 6). Each ride costs 6 cards, so they spent 6 x 6 = 36 cards on the roller coaster. Next, they both decided to go on the sled ride two times each. That means they spent another 2 x 2 = 4 cards on the sled ride. In total, they spent 36 + 4 = 40 cards at the fair.
"Response:  We know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 6 times as many miles on Thursday as he did on Monday. So, if Walt walked x miles on Monday, then he walked 6x miles on Thursday. 
We also know that from Monday to Wednesday (3 days), his total distance was 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday = Total Distance  
4 + (6x) + (6x) = 41  
(7x) = 41  
x = 6  
Therefore, Walt walked 6 miles on Monday and 42 miles (6 x 7) on Thursday."
Response:  If Tom pays for 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then he spends $60 per month on car washes (4 x $15). Over the course of a year (12 months), Tom will spend $720 on car washes ($60 x 12).
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 games and lost 5 of them, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 games left. If Bobby has fewer than three times as many games as Brian, then Bobby has 3(15) = 45 games.
Response:  There are 27 Einhörner worldwide and two thirds of them are in Scotland. So, there are 18 Einhörner in Scotland (2/3 x 27). Of these, two thirds are female, so there are 12 female Einhörner in Scotland (2/3 x 18).
"Response:  We know that Rory ordered two jumbo sandwiches for $7.50 each and two bags of chips for $1.50 each. That adds up to a total of:

$7.50 x 2 = $15.00 (for the sandwiches) + $1.50 x 2 = $3.00 (for the chips) = $18.00

Now we need to calculate the delivery fee. Since Rory lives more than 2 miles away from the restaurant, there is a 20% delivery fee added to the total cost. To find out how much the delivery fee is, we can multiply the total cost by 0.20:

$18.00 x 0.20 = $3.60 (delivery fee)

So the final total that Rory needs to pay is:

$18.00 + $3.60 = $21.60

Trinkgeld is not included in this calculation."
"Response:  We know that Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions and he spent 6 hours to complete the second test with 100 questions. So we can start by calculating how long it would take him to complete each question.  
We know that Mark completed each question at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Therefore, for the first test, he would have taken:

8 hours x 5 questions/hour = 400 questions

For the second test, he would have taken:

6 hours x 5 questions/hour = 300 questions

Now, let's find out how many questions were left unanswered. For the first test, we can subtract the number of answered questions from the total number of questions:

400 - 75 = 225 (unanswered)

For the second test, we can do the same:

300 - 100 = 200 (unanswered)

Therefore, Mark left 225 questions unanswered for the first test and 200 questions unanswered for the second test."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 blue gumballs and 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. So if we let x be the number of blue gumballs, then the number of pink gumballs is 4x + 22.
We also know that the total number of gumballs is the sum of the number of blue and pink gumballs:
Total = 12 (blue) + 4x + 22 (pink)
Now we can solve for x. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us:
0 = 4x + 22 - 12
Subtracting 22 from both sides gives us:
-22 = 4x
Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:
x = 5
So there are 5 blue gumballs. Now we can find out how many pink gumballs there are:
Pink = 4x + 22
= 4(5) + 22
= 20 + 22
Therefore, there are 42 pink gumballs in the machine."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 rental cars available in total and we have to find out how many of them are half-automatic transmissions. To do this, we can subtract the number of automatic and manual transmission vehicles from the total number of cars. This will give us the number of halbautomatic vehicles.

Let X be the number of half-automatic vehicles. Then we can write the equation as follows:
X + (12 x 2) + (4 x 2) = 20... (1)
where ""x 2"" represents twice the number of automatic or manual transmission vehicles.

Now let's simplify the equation:
X + 24 + 8 = 20... (2)
Combine like terms:
X + 32 = 20... (3)
Subtract 32 from both sides:
X = 7... (4)
Therefore, there are 7 half-automatic vehicles among the 20 rental cars.

To convert this to a percentage, divide the number of half-automatic vehicles by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:
(7/20) x 100% = 35%... (5)
So, approximately 35% of the rental cars are half-automatic."
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees and twice as many babies as queens. So if we let W represent the number of worker bees, then the number of baby bees is 2W, and the number of queens is also 2W.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can set up the following equation:

W + 2W + 2W = 700

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3W = 700

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that:

W = 233

So there are 233 worker bees in the hive."
"Response:  If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day and works part-time for 4 days a week (assuming he has no work on the other 3 days), then he spends 8 hours per week playing video games.

If we assume that his hourly wage for working is $10/hour, then his total weekly earnings from work would be:

8 hours/week x $10/hour = $80/week

So, if Jordan spent all of his time working instead of playing video games, he would earn $80/week. However, since he does spend some time playing video games, we need to subtract the amount he spends on gaming from his total earnings.

Let's say he spends an average of $5/hour playing video games (this is just an estimate, as the cost of games and gaming systems can vary widely). Then, the amount he spends on gaming each week would be:

8 hours/week x $5/hour = $40/week

Therefore, Jordan's total weekly earnings, including both his work and his gaming expenses, would be:

$80/week - $40/week = $40/week

So, Jordan would earn $40/week if he spent all of his time working instead of playing video games."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item without taxes:
Milk (2 x $2) = $4
Eggs (3 x $3) = $9
Glue bulbs (3 x $3) = $9
Cups (3 x $3) = $9
Kakerlaken traps (4 x $4) = $16
Total cost before taxes = $4 + $9 + $9 + $9 + $16 = $47
Now, let's apply the 10% tax rate to all non-food items:
Tax on glue bulbs = $9 x 10% = $0.90
Tax on cups = $9 x 10% = $0.90
Tax on Kakerlaken traps = $16 x 10% = $1.60
Total tax = $0.90 + $0.90 + $1.60 = $3.40
So, the total cost with tax is:
$47 (before taxes) + $3.40 (tax) = $50.40"
"Response:  We know that Lucas has already served three customers and is currently negotiating with five potential clients. So, let's start by calculating his total income for each week.

For the three existing customers, he sold:

* 2 x 2 = 4 bottles of detergent (at $2 each) = $8
* 1 pack of laundry napkins (at $5 each) = $5

Total income from existing customers: $8 + $5 = $13

Now, let's calculate the potential income from the five potential clients. If he manages to sign all five, he will sell:

* 5 x 2 = 10 bottles of detergent (at $2 each) = $20
* 5 x 1 = 5 packs of laundry napkins (at $5 each) = $25

Total potential income from new clients: $20 + $25 = $45

Adding up both the existing and potential income, we get:

$13 + $45 = $58

So, Lucas's estimated weekly income would be $58."
Response:  We know that there are 100 Ananas per hectare and John has 10 hectares of land. So, in total, he has 10 x 100 = 1000 Ananas. Since he can harvest his Ananas every 3 months, we need to calculate how many times he can harvest them within a year. There are 4 seasons in a year (ignoring winter for now), so he can harvest 4 times per year. Therefore, John can harvest 1000 / 4 = 250 Ananas per year.
"Response:  We know that Johnny has three different Lego sets with the following number of pieces:

* Set A (500 pieces)
* Set B (3 times as many pieces as Set A = 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces)
* Set C (1/4 of the number of pieces in Set A = 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces)

Now, let's add up all the pieces from each set:

500 + 1500 + 125 = 2225

So, in total, Johnny has 2225 Lego pieces to pick up!"
Response:  We know that there were 30 bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours and half as many returned in the next 6 hours (i.e., 30 / 2 = 15). So, in total, there were 30 + 15 = 45 bees that left the hive during the day. Since each bee that had left before and not yet returned did so in the last 6 hours of the day, we can assume that all 45 bees that left the hive during the day returned in the last 6 hours. Therefore, Debra saw 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
Response:  If Brittany and her mother paid for one child ticket ($10) and one adult ticket ($12), they would have paid a total of $22. Since Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8 as change, she must have given him $22 - $8 = $14. Therefore, Brittany's mother gave the cashier $14.
"Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x friends, then Charlie has 3x friends. And we also know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x friends, then James has 4x friends. Now we are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  

3x = 12... (1) 

We also know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can write another equation:  

4x =?... (2) 

Now we need to find out what number will satisfy both equations. To do this, we can substitute the value of x from equation (1) into equation (2):  

4(12) =?... (3) 

Substituting 12 for x in equation (3), we get:  

48 =?... (4) 

So James has 48 friends on Facebook."
"Response:  We know that Steve lives 3 miles away from school and can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. That means he covers 3 miles in:

3 miles / 440 ft/min = x minutes

where x is the time it takes Steve to get home.

We also know that Tim lives 2 miles away from school and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. He covers 2 miles in:

2 miles / 264 ft/min = y minutes

where y is the time it takes Tim to get home.

Since Steve has to wait for Tim to finish the race before he can start, we need to find out when Steve will arrive at home if Tim arrives at home after y minutes.

Steve travels 3 miles in x minutes, so he covers the last mile (the distance between Tim's house and Steve's house) in:

1 mile / 440 ft/min = z minutes

where z is the time it takes Steve to cover the last mile.

Now we have three equations:

x + y = z + y (since Steve waits for Tim to finish)

x + y = 3(440) / 440 (since Steve covers 3 miles in x minutes)

y + z = 2(264) / 264 (since Tim covers 2 miles in y minutes)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 57.8 minutes
y = 39.2 minutes
z = 15.4 minutes

So Steve arrives at home in 57.8 minutes, and Tim arrives at home in 39.2 minutes plus the time it takes him to cover the last mile (15.4 minutes), which gives us a total time of 54.6 minutes for Tim. Therefore, the winner arrives at home before the loser by:

57.8 - 54.6 = 3.2 minutes."
"Response:  We know that there were 5 people who came to pump up both their tires, so they paid $0.25 x 2 = $0.50 each. There were also 3 people who came to pump up all three tires of their bikes, so they paid $0.25 x 3 = $0.75 each. Finally, one person came with a single-wheeled bike and paid $0.25 for the only tire. So, the total amount earned is:
$0.50 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $1.50
Therefore, Shawnda has earned $1.50 on this day."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Carl pays in total for the cookies. Since he buys ten packs and each pack contains six cookies, he pays:  

10 x 6 = 60 cookies

Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl pays:

60 x $0.10 = $6.00

Now, let's find out how much change Carl will receive if he pays with a $10 bill. To do this, we subtract the amount he paid ($6.00) from the value of the $10 bill:

$10 - $6.00 = $4.00

Therefore, Carl will receive $4.00 as change."
Response:  We know that Dave ate fourteen Pommes frites before the möwe stole the packaging. So there were still fourteen - fourteen = one hundred and forty Pommes frites left in the bag. The möwe ate half as many Pommes frites as Dave had eaten, which is seven. Therefore, the möwe ate seven Pommes frites. Then three tauben came along and each ate three Pommes frites, for a total of nine Pommes frites. After that, a wash bear took two-thirds of what was left, or sixty-six and two-thirds Pommes frites. Finally, ants carried away one Pommes frite and left five behind. In total, how many Pommes frites were in the pack when Dave bought them? One hundred and forty minus seven minus nine minus sixty-six and two-thirds minus one equals twenty-eight Pommes frites.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 weeks in one semester and we also know how many courses Kimo takes per day. So let's first calculate how many hours he spends on classes per week:

Monday, Wednesday, Friday (3 x 1 hour/day) = 3 hours/week
Tuesday, Thursday (2 x 2 hours/day) = 4 hours/week
Total hours per week: 3 + 4 = 7 hours/week

Now, let's multiply this number by the number of weeks in the semester:

7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours/semester

So, Kimo spends 112 hours in one semester attending his college courses."
"Response:  We know that there are 300 Brötchen, each of which is 4 inches long, so together they measure:

300 x 4 = 1200 inches

There are also 120 Schokoladencroissants, each of which is 6 inches long, so together they measure:

120 x 6 = 720 inches

Finally, there are 60 Baguettes, each of which is two feet long, so together they measure:

60 x 2 = 120 feet

Now we add all these measurements together to find out how long all the backwares are when placed end to end:

1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches

That's approximately 170 feet!"
"Response:  We know that there are 3 types of animals that eat bananas: gorillas, pavians and other monkeys (we will call them ""other"" for simplicity). We also know how many bananas each type of animal needs per month:  
Gorillas need 400 bananas/month  
Pavians need 100 bananas/month  
Other monkeys need 200 bananas/month  
We want to calculate how many bananas the zookeeper must order to last for 2 months. So we multiply the number of bananas needed per month by 2:  
Gorillas: 400 x 2 = 800 bananas  
Pavians: 100 x 2 = 200 bananas  
Other monkeys: 200 x 2 = 400 banans  
In total, the zookeeper needs to order 800 + 200 + 400 = 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
Response:  We know that Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers a distance of 15 x 100 yards = 1500 yards. Now we need to find out how far Kelly runs. She runs once from one end zone to the other (40 yards) and then back again, for a total of 2 times. So she covers a distance of 2 x 40 yards = 80 yards. Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs 1500 - 80 = 1420 yards further than the loser (Kelly).
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much Raphael spent on pens and then add that amount to the cost of the notebooks. To do this, we multiply the number of items by their price. So for the pens, he spent:

4 x 1.5 = 6 dollars

For the notebooks, he spent:

2 x 4 = 8 dollars

Now let's add both amounts together to get the total cost:

6 + 8 = 14 dollars

So Raphael paid 14 dollars in total."
Response:  We know that there are initially 11 swimming tadpoles in the pond and we can see them all at first glance. Then, six of them hide under a lily pad, leaving only five visible to us. Later, two more tadpoles disappear under a stone, so now we can only see three tadpoles left in the water. Therefore, the final number of tadpoles that Finn can currently see in the pond is 3 + 5 = 8.
"Response:  We know that the water depth in the tank on Monday is 17 feet (given). On Tuesday, there is an increase of 7 feet, so the water depth on Tuesday is:

17 + 7 = 24 feet

Now, we are told that on Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we can set up a proportion to represent this information:

Water depth on Wednesday : Water depth on Tuesday = 2/3 : 1

We know that the water depth on Tuesday is 24 feet, so we can substitute this value into the proportion:

Water depth on Wednesday = 24 x 2/3
= 24 x 4/6
= 8 feet

Therefore, the water depth in the tank on Wednesday is 8 feet."
Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 Seesterne, 6 Seepferdchen and 3 Clownfische. If Locsin caught fewer Seesterne, she must have caught at least 5 less than Anakin, so she caught 10 - 5 = 5 Seesterne. Since she also caught fewer Seepferdchen, she must have caught at least 3 less than Anakin, so she caught 6 - 3 = 3 Seepferdchen. And since she caught more Clownfische than Anakin, she caught 3 + 2 = 5 Clownfische. Therefore, in total, Locsin caught 5 Seesterne, 3 Seepferdchen and 5 Clownfische.
"Response:  If the price of a beutel of murmurs is currently $20 and increases by 20% every two months, then after one month, the price will be:

$20 x 1.2 (20% increase) = $24

So, after one month, the price of a beutel of murmurs will be $24.

Now, let's calculate the price after 36 months:

$24 x 1.2 (20% increase each month for 36 months) = $86.40

Therefore, after 36 months, the price of a beutel of murmurs would be $86.40."
"Response:  We know that one action figure costs 5$, and there are three of them in total. So, we can calculate their cost as follows:

3 x 5$ = 15$

Now, let's move to the red cars. There are five of them, and each car costs 4$. Therefore, their combined cost would be:

5 x 4$ = 20$

Finally, we have the puppet, which is worth as much as three action figures. So, its value is also 15$:

Puppet = 3 x 5$ = 15$

Adding up all these values gives us the total worth of the entire collection:

Total = 15$ + 20$ + 15$ = 50$

Therefore, the entire collection of toys is worth 50 dollars!"
Response:  If she prepares her tax return herself, she will lose $3 \times 1 = 3 hours of free time and $35 per hour in lost income, for a total loss of $3 \times 35 = 105$. If she hires an accountant, she will pay $90. So, if she chooses to prepare her tax return herself, she will have $105 - 90 = 15 less than if she had hired an accountant.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Elvira will spend on her computer and accessories:

Computer: 1090 €
Bildschirm: 157 €
Tastatur + Maus: 74 €
Total: 1321 €

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spends from her budget of 1500 €:

1500 € - 1321 € = 179 €

So, Elvira will have 179 € left over for her clothing purchase."
Response:  We know that Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish caramel pudding and her neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits his daughter. To make 15 Spanish caramel puddings, Sandra will need 3 x 15 = 45 eggs in total. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, she will have to babysit 45 / 9 = 5 times to get all the eggs she needs.
"Response:  We know that in two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can set up an equation based on this information.
Let S represent Seth's age and B represent Brooke's age. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write:
S = 2B
Now we know that in two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can add their current ages to each other and then add 2 to get the total they will be in two years:
S + B + 2 = 28
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2B + 2 = 28
Solving for B, we get:
B = 14
Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can find his age by multiplying Brooke's age by 2:
S = 2(14) = 28
Therefore, Seth is currently 28 years old."
Response:  We know that Jimmy has twice as much money as Ethel, and we also know how much money Ethel has (8 dollars). So if we double 8 dollars, we get 16 dollars. Therefore, Jimmy must have 16 dollars.
"Response:  We know that Pancho walks 20 miles per day, except for weekends when he walks 10 miles. So, to find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate how many days he walks during the week and then multiply it by his daily distance. There are 7 days in a week, so if Pancho walks every day except for Saturday and Sunday (when he only walks 10 miles), he walks for 5 days (Mon-Fri). Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:

5 days x 20 miles/day = 100 miles/week

So, Pancho walks 100 miles per week."
Response:  We know that the hat costs $25 and the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it will cost $25 x 3 = $75. The pants are equal to the sum of the hat and the jacket, which means they will cost $25 + $75 = $100. Therefore, each uniform will cost $100 in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 80 spiders with 8 beins each, so we can calculate how many beins they have in total:  
80 spiders x 8 beins per spider = 640 beins  
Now let's consider the insects. There are 90 of them and each has 6 beins, so we can calculate their contribution to the total number of beins as well:  
90 insects x 6 beins per insect = 540 beins Finally, we need to add the beins from the rare mutated invertebrates. There are only 3 of them, but each has 10 beins, so we can simply add their contribution to the total:  
3 rare mutated invertebrates x 10 beins per invertibrate = 30 beins Now we can add up all these contributions to find out how many beins Jake sees overall:  
640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 beins So, Jake sees a total of 1210 beins."
"Response:  We know that Sally Four is as old as Sally Thirty-Two and Sally Thirty-Two is eight years older than Sally Four. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Sally Four + Sally Thirty-Two = 8
Now let's look at the other information given in the problem:
Granny Red is two times older than Sally Two. So we can write another equation based on this information:
Granny Red = 2 x Sally Two
We also know that Sally Two is three years younger than Granny Red. So we can write one more equation based on this information:
Sally Two + 3 = Granny Red
Now we have three equations and four variables (Sally Four, Sally Thirty-Two, Granny Red, and Sally Two). Can you use these equations to find out the total age of all four birds?"
"Response:  We know that Jessica has three debts with different minimum payments:

1. Student loan: $300/month
2. Credit card: $200/month
3. Mortgage: $500/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum for each debt. So, she will pay:

1. Student loan: $300 x 1.5 = $450/month
2. Credit card: $200 x 1.5 = $300/month
3. Mortgage: $500 x 1.5 = $750/month

Now, let's calculate how much Jessica will pay in one year if she pays these amounts monthly:

Yearly payment for student loan: 12 x $450 = $5,400
Yearly payment for credit card: 12 x $300 = $3,600
Yearly payment for mortgage: 12 x $750 = $9,000

Total yearly payment: $5,400 + $3,600 + $9,000 = $18,000

So, Jessica will pay a total of $18,000 in one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum for her debts."
"Response:  We know that Billy needs about 1.5 minutes to peel each potato and about 5 seconds to cut it into small pieces. So if he has 60 potatoes to prepare, we can calculate how long it will take him as follows:

1. Peeling time: 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes (to peel all 60 potatoes)
2. Cutting time: 90 x 5 = 450 seconds (to cut all 60 potatoes into small pieces)

Therefore, in total, Billy will need approximately 90 + 450 = 540 minutes or 9 hours to prepare the 60 potatoes for his big grill party!"
"Response:  We know that they sold 25 gallons of lemonade and made a profit of $25. They spent $3 per gallon for lemons and $2 per gallon for sugar, so their total cost was:

$3 x 25 = $75 (for lemons) + $2 x 25 = $50 (for sugar) = $125

Since they sold each glass for $0.50, they earned:

$0.50 x 25 = $12.50

So, their total revenue was:

$12.50 + $125 = $137.50

Now we can calculate how much they spent on lemons:

$125 - $137.50 = $12.50

Therefore, they spent $12.50 on lemons."
Response:  We know that there are 80 Japanese runners and x Chinese runners (where x is the number of girls). So in total, we have 80 + x runners. We also know that the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls in the Chinese team must be x = 80 - 60 = 20.
"Response:  We know that Zaid gives 1/4 of his income for rent and 1/3 for car gasoline. So he has to pay:

Rent: 1/4 x 6000 = 1500 $
Car Gasoline: 1/3 x 6000 = 2000 $

Now we subtract the total amount he pays from his income:

6000 - (1500 + 2000) =?

Do you want to try to solve it?"
"Response:  We know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monica, so if Monica has x crabs, then Rani has x + 10 crabs. Additionally, we know that Bo has 40 crabs and Monica has x crabs, so together they have 40 + x crabs. To find out how many crabs all three of them have in total, we need to add up their individual amounts:

x + (x + 10) + 40 =?

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 10 + 40 =?

Solving for the unknown variable 'x':

2x + 50 =?

Subtracting 50 from both sides:

2x = 30

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 15

So Monica has 15 crabs, Rani has 25 crabs (10 more than Monica), and Bo has 40 crabs. Together, they have a total of:

15 + 25 + 40 = 80

Therefore, the total number of crabs all three of them have is 80."
"Response:  We know that Lloyd earns $10 per hour for tutoring math and he worked for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. So we can calculate his total earnings as follows:
Week 1: 5 hours x $10/hour = $50
Week 2: 8 hours x $10/hour = $80
Total earnings: $50 + $80 = $130
Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 in the first two weeks of tutoring math."
"Response:  We know that the winner received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted. So we can start by finding out how many votes the winner got.  
3/4 x 80 =?
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:
3/4 = 6/8
Now we multiply:
6/8 x 80 = 480
So the winner got 480 votes. Now let's find out how many votes the loser got. To do this, we subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of voters:
80 - 480 =?
Simplifying:
80 - 480 = -320
The loser got -320 votes."
"Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white nellies. So if she ordered x white nellies, she also ordered 4x = 4x + 3 (since there are three more) = 5x red roses. In total, she ordered 200 + 5x flowers.  
We also know that she ordered five times as many pink calla lilies as white nellies. Therefore, if she ordered y white nellies, she also ordered 5y pink calla lilies. Since she ordered 200 + 5x flowers in total, and 200 of them were pink calla lilies, then she must have ordered 5x - 200 white nellies.  
Now we need to find out how many red roses Sandra needs to receive before 17 o'clock. She threatened to switch suppliers unless she received all missing red roses by then. To calculate this, let's subtract the number of white nellies she already has from the total number of flowers she ordered: 5x - 200 =?.  
Solving for x, we get: 5x = 200 + 200 = 400. So Sandra needs 400 - 200 = 200 red roses before 17 o'clock to keep her purchase with Fred."
"Response:  We know that Jean is two years older than Mark and that Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age two years ago. So we can start with the fact that Jan is currently 30 years old.  
First, let's calculate how old Mark was two years ago. If Mark is five years older than half of Jan's age, then he must be five years older than (1/2) \* 30 = 15. Therefore, Mark was 15 + 2 = 17 years old two years ago.  
Now we know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean was also 17 years old two years ago. But since then, both have aged one year each, so Jean is now 18 and Mark is 19 years old.  
Therefore, Jean is currently 18 years old."
"Response:  We know that each member of the faster team will run their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So if we assume that there are four members on this team, they will complete their respective distances as follows:

Team A (faster team):

* Member 1: 400 meters in 55 seconds = 720 meters
* Member 2: 400 meters in 55 seconds = 720 meters
* Member 3: 400 meters in 55 seconds = 720 meters
* Member 4: 400 meters in 55 seconds = 720 meters

Total distance covered by Team A: 720 + 720 + 720 + 720 = 2880 meters

Now let's look at the slower team. We know that their first runner will take 60 seconds to cover 400 meters, so the next three runners will cover their distances in 57 seconds, 54 seconds, and 51 seconds respectively, since they are running at speeds 3, 6, and 9 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the total distance covered by the slower team can be calculated as follows:

Team B (slower team):

* Member 1: 400 meters in 60 seconds = 640 meters
* Member 2: 400 meters in 57 seconds = 616 meters
* Member 3: 400 meters in 54 seconds = 584 meters
* Member 4: 400 meters in 51 seconds = 536 meters

Total distance covered by Team B: 640 + 616 + 584 + 536 = 2376 meters

Since Team A covered 2880 meters, and Team B covered 2376 meters, the difference in their distances is:

2880 - 2376 = 504 meters

Therefore, the faster team (Team A) will win by approximately 504 meters."
"Response:  If Jerry rolls a six-sided die and gets an even number, then he has rolled two even numbers in a row. So we need to calculate the probability of rolling an odd number.

Probability of rolling an odd number = Number of odd numbers / Total number of outcomes
= 3/6
= 1/2

Therefore, the probability of rolling an odd number is 50%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are three numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6.

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 3/6
= 1/2

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is also 50%.

To summarize, there is no difference in probability between rolling an odd number and rolling a number greater than 3. Both have a probability of 50%."
Response:  If Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then she picked $\frac{1}{2}$ of $20$ apples, which is $\frac{10}{2} = 5$ apples. So together, they picked $20 + 5 = 25$ apples.
Response:  We know that there are 3 käfige with rats and each käfig has 6 strohhalme. So, we have 3 x 6 = 18 strohhalme for all rats. Since there are 10 käfige of hamsters and each käfig has 5 strohhalme, we have 10 x 5 = 50 strohhalme for all hamsters. Finally, since there are 20 strohhalme for all hasen, we can conclude that there must be 160 - (18 + 50 + 20) = 160 - 88 = 72 strohhalme left over. Therefore, if 160 strohhalme were distributed among small rodents, then there would be 72 strohhalme left over after distributing them to rats, hamsters, and rabbits.
"Response:  If Mandy paid $100 to Benedict after 3 months and there is an agreement of monthly interest at 2%, then we can calculate how much she needs to pay using simple interest.

First, let's find out how much interest has been accumulated over 3 months:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $100 x 2% x 3/12
= $6

Now, we add the principal and interest to get the total amount that Mandy needs to pay:

Total = Principal + Interest
= $100 + $6
= $106

Therefore, Mandy must pay Benedict $106 after 3 months if they agreed on a monthly interest rate of 2%."
"Response:  The total cost of all sacks is 2 x 10 = 20$ per sack. So, if he sold each sack for 30$, his profit would be:  
Profit = Sales - Cost = 30$ - 20$ = 10$ per sack. 
Since he made a total profit of 400$, he must have sold:  
Number of sacks = Profit / Profit per sack = 400$ / 10$ = 40 sacks."
"Response:  We know that they spent 20,25$ for 3 entries to the fair and 4,50$ less for food than for tickets. So, they spent 20,25 + (4,50 - 4,50) = 20,25 + 0 = 20,25$ in total.  
Now we know that they used two different rides, each costing 33$. So, they spent 20,25$ / 2 = 10,125$ per ride. Therefore, each of them paid 10,125$ / 3 = 3,375$ for the rides."
"Response:  We know that John can collect 2 Pfirsiche per minute and he collects for 3 hours (180 minutes). So we can calculate how many Pfirsiche he will collect in total as follows:  
180 minutes x 2 Pfirsiche/minute = 360 Pfirsiche  
Therefore, John collects 360 Pfirsiche during his 3-hour period of collecting fruit."
Response:  If there are ten ducks and each needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, then together they need to eat 35 pounds (10 x 3.5) of insects per week. Since there are seven days in a week, they need to eat about 5 pounds (35 / 7) of insects per day.
"Response:  We know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and falls 2 trees per year. So he starts with 50 trees (50 = 10 x 5). After 10 years, he will have planted 100 trees (10 x 10) and fallen 20 trees (2 x 10), so he will have 80 trees left (100 - 20).  
Now, we are told that after 10 years, 30% of the trees will die. This means that 30% of 80 trees is 24 trees (80 x 0.3). So, Tom will be left with 80 - 24 = 56 trees."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 18 rosa plastic flamingos in Sue's yard (on Friday morning). Then, on Saturday morning, one-third of them (6) were taken away and painted white. So, after painting, there were 12 rosa plastic flamingos left. On Sunday morning, 18 more rosa plastic flamingos were added to the collection. Therefore, at sunset on Sunday, there were 30 plastic flamingos in total - 12 rosa ones and 18 newly added ones. Now, let's compare the number of rosa and white flamingos:

Rosa flamingos: 12 + 18 = 30
White flamingos: 6

So, at sunset on Sunday, there were more rosa flamingos than white flamingos in Sue's yard!"
Response:  If Violetta needs 5 different colors and each color costs $2, then she needs to spend $10 (5 x $2). Since she has $20, her change will be $20 - $10 = $10.
"Response:  We know that one stift costs as much as one bleistift and one radierer together. So if we want to find out how much 8 stifte cost, we need to calculate first how much one bleistift and one radierer cost. 
One bleistift costs 1,20 $ and one radierer costs 0,30 $, so altogether one stift costs:  
1,20 + 0,30 = 1,50 $ 
Now let's multiply this amount by 8 to get the total cost of 8 stifte:  
1,50 x 8 = 12,00 $"
"Response:  We know that there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots. So we can start by multiplying 40 by 2 to get our total amount of carrots needed:  
40 x 2 = 80 pounds 
Now we know that we need 80 pounds of carrots in total. But the problem states that 200 pounds of carrots must be distributed among the 40 restaurants. This means that we have 120 pounds of carrots left over (200 - 80 = 120). 
So the answer is 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in Soda and among them, there are 8417 men and 9092 women. So, we can start by subtracting the number of men and women from the total population to find out how many children there are:  

23786 - 8417 - 9092 =? 

Now let's solve for the unknown quantity (the number of children):  

23786 - 8417 - 9092 = 7377 

Therefore, there are 7377 children living in Soda."
"Response:  We know that Elaine had 20 cards at first and collected triple the number of cards in the first month. So she had 3 x 20 = 60 cards after one month. In the second month, she collected fewer cards than she did in the first month, so let's say she collected half as many cards (since ""less"" can mean both ""fewer"" and ""lesser amount""). That means she collected 1/2 x 60 = 30 cards in the second month. Finally, in the third month, she collected double the number of cards she collected in the first two months combined. So she collected 2 x (60 + 30) = 2 x 90 = 180 cards in total. Therefore, Elaine has 180 Pokémon cards altogether."
Response:  We know that Mark corrects 1000 sentences per week and Herausgeber A pays him 5 cents per sentence. So, he earns 5000 cents from Herausgeber A (1000 x 5). Now we need to find out how much he earns from Herausgeber B. Since Herausgeber B pays double what Herausgeber A pays, Mark earns 2 times 5000 = 10,000 cents from Herausgeber B. Therefore, Mark earns a total of 15,000 cents (10,000 + 5,000) in one week.
"Response:  We know that Baldur takes 5 buckets of water in the morning and 6 buckets of water in the afternoon. If each bucket contains 5 liters of water, then we can calculate how much water he collects each day as follows:  
Morning: 5 x 5 = 25 liters  
Afternoon: 6 x 5 = 30 liters  
Total daily water collection: 25 + 30 = 55 liters"
"Response:  If John wins the prize at the beginning of the year and his weekly salary is $2000, then he will earn an additional $5000 as a one-time payment. So, his total earnings for the year would be:

$2000 x 52 = $104,000 + $5000 = $119,000

Now, let's calculate the percentage increase in his salary due to the prize:

(119,000 - 104,000) / 104,000 = 13.5%

So, John's salary increased by 13.5% due to winning the prize."
"Response:  If there are 10 acres of land (10 x 1000 = 10,000 square meters) and each acre produces 5 tons per year, then the total production is:

10,000 sqm x 5 tons/acre = 50,000 tons/year

Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the number of barrels produced as follows:

50,000 tons/year x 2 barrels/ton = 100,000 barrels/year

Therefore, the farm produces 100,000 barrels of wine per year."
"Response:  We know that Carl eats sandwiches for lunch every day and each sandwich contains two slices of cheese. So, if he eats three sandwiches per day (one for breakfast, one for lunch, and one for dinner), then he consumes six slices of cheese per day.

Now, let's consider his egg-cheese omelets for breakfast. If he makes three omelets per day (one for each meal), then he uses three slices of cheese per omelet, for a total of nine slices of cheese per day.

Finally, we need to add the amount of cheese he used for his pasta dish. Since he made a large portion of macaroni and cheese that was meant to last for several evenings, we can assume that he used eight slices of cheese for this dish as well.

So, in total, Carl consumed:

6 slices of cheese per day x 7 days = 42 slices of cheese
9 slices of cheese per day x 3 days = 27 slices of cheese
8 slices of cheese per day x 1 day = 8 slices of cheese

Adding all these up gives us a grand total of:
42 + 27 + 8 = 77 slices of cheese."
Response:  First, we know that Janet had 22 green sticks and 10 yellow sticks, so she already has 32 sticks. Then she bought 6 packets of blue sticks and each packet contains 9 sticks, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 more sticks. Also, she bought 2 packets of red sticks and each packet contains 6 sticks, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 more sticks. In total, Janet now has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 sticks.
Response:  We know that Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 in the first five tests. To calculate her average score, we add these numbers up and divide by 5: (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 454 / 5 = 90.8. Since Brinley can drop the lowest score, she needs to get at least 93 on the sixth test to have an overall average of 93. So, Brinley needs to get at least 93 on the sixth test.
"Response:  We know that Michael rode his bike at least 5 times per week for 4 weeks, so he rode his bike:

5 x 4 = 20 times

Each time, he rode 25 kilometers, so he traveled a total of:

20 x 25 = 500 kilometers

Now, we know that during the next three weeks, Michael rode his bike only twice a week, but each time he rode 60 kilometers. So, he traveled an additional:

2 x 60 = 120 kilometers

Therefore, the total distance Michael traveled is:

500 + 120 = 620 kilometers"
"Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples in Joe's sweet bag. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, how many grams does Joe's sweet bag weigh in total?  
To find out, we need to calculate the weight of all the candied apples first. Since there are 80 candied apples, and each one weighs 20 grams (since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams), the total weight of all the candied apples is:

80 x 20 = 1600 grams

Now let's add the weight of all the chocolate bars:

25 x 40 = 1000 grams

Adding both amounts gives us the total weight of Joe's sweet bag:

1600 + 1000 = 2600 grams

So Joe's sweet bag weighs 2600 grams or 2.6 kilograms!"
Response:  On Monday, she bought 4 cakes. On Tuesday, she bought three times as many cakes, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes. On Wednesday, she bought five times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes. In total, Rose has purchased 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes over the three days.
"Response:  We know that 20 dozen (Zwanzig Duzend) tasses cost $1200 less than half a dozen (halbes Dutzend) plates at $6000 each. So we can start with this information to find out how much one plate costs and then calculate the cost of one tasse.  
First, let's convert ""half a dozen"" into a numerical value. There are 6 items in a full dozen, so half a dozen is:

Half a dozen = 3 items

Now, we know that 20 dozen tasses cost $1200 less than 3 plates, so we can set up an equation:

20 Dozen x Price per Plate = 3 Plates x Price per Plate + 1200

where Price per Plate is what one plate costs. Solving for Price per Plate, we get:

Price per Plate = ($1200 / 3 Plates) = $400 per Plate

Now, we want to find out how much one tasse costs. Since there are 12 tasses in a dozen, we can divide the price per plate by 12 to get the price per tasse:

Price per Tasse = $400 per Plate / 12 Tasses per Plate = $33.33 per Tasse

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing one tasse is $33.33."
"Response:  We know that Sara wants to buy a jacket and two pairs of shoes, which will cost in total:

Jacket: 30$
Shoes (2 pairs): 2 x 20$ = 40$
Total: 70$

We also know that Sara has already saved 10$. So she needs to earn more money to reach her goal. She can earn 5$ each time she watches the neighbor's children, and her parents pay her 4$ for every time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how many times Sara needs to watch the neighbor's children or mow the lawn to earn enough money:

To earn 70$ - 10$ = 60$, Sara needs to:

60 / 5$ per child = 12 times watch the neighbor's children
or
60 / 4$ per lawn mowing = 15 times mow the lawn

So, Sara needs to either watch the neighbor's children 12 times or mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
"Response:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and has twice as many white hens as red hens. So if he has x white hens, he must have 2x red hens (since there are twice as many white hens).

We also know that each white hen lays 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by all white hens is 5x. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation:

5x = 42

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So Jerry has 8 white hens and 16 red hens (since there are twice as many white hens)."
"Response:  We know that the park is rectangular and has a length of 6 miles (9.7 km) and a width of 1.5 miles (2.4 km). To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park at a speed of 3 miles per hour (mph), we need to first convert his speed from mph to kilometers per hour (km/h):

3 mph = 3 x 1.609344 km/h (since there are 1.609344 kilometers in a mile)

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Gary to walk around the park:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 6 miles + 1.5 miles
= 7.5 miles
= 7.5 x 1.609344 km
= 12.08 km

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 km/h, he will spend:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 12.08 km / 3 km/h
= 4 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 4 hours walking around the park."
Response:  On the first day, there were 100 customers. On the second day, there were 50 more than on the first day, so there were 100 + 50 = 200 customers. Now, let's find out how many customers there were on the third day. If there were 500 customers on the third day, and 200 more than on the second day, then there were 200 + 500 = 700 customers on the third day. Therefore, Sloane counted 700 customers on the third day.
"Response:  We know that the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool before 4 minutes ago. So if the large pool had x gallons of water, the small pool would have had x/2 gallons of water. Now we are told that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, after 4 minutes, the large pool will have lost 4x gallons of water and the small pool will have lost 4(x/2) = 2x gallons of water. Since the large pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

Large pool water = Small pool water x 4

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8 (since 4 x 2 = 8)

Therefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water."
"Response:  We know that Lori needs to earn $352.00 ($320.00 for the shoes and $32.00 for the belt) before she can make her purchase. If she is paid $8.00 per hour at her part-time job, we can calculate how many hours she needs to work in order to reach this amount.  

First, let's calculate how much money Lori has earned so far:
$8.00/hour x number of hours worked = $352.00

Now, we need to solve for the number of hours worked (x). To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $8.00/hour:

$352.00 / $8.00/hour = x

This gives us:

x = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours at her part-time job before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt."
"Response:  We know that Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10%. So, if she pays $165 per month for 12 months, how much will be her remaining balance after that period?

Firstly, let's calculate the total amount paid by Janeth over 12 months:

$165 x 12 = $1980

Now, we need to find out how much of the original debt has been repaid. To do this, we subtract the total payment from the initial debt:

$2000 - $1980 = $20

So, after 12 months of paying $165 per month, Janeth will have repaid $20 of the original debt, leaving a remaining balance of:

$2000 - $20 = $1980

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $1980."
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses and 7 more than roses = 7 + 4 = 11 flowers in total. Therefore, there are 11 flowers in the vase.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet and half as old as Zach. So we can start with some equations based on this information.
Let H be Harriet's age (in years) and A be Adrian's age (also in years). Since Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, we have:
A = 3H
We also know that Adrian is half as old as Zach, so we have:
A = (1/2)Z
Now we are given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, so we can substitute this value into one of our equations to find Adrian's age. For example, if we use equation (1), we get:
A = 3(21) = 63
So Adrian is currently 63 years old.
Now let's calculate the average age of all three people in three years. We will use the fact that the average of two numbers is equal to the sum of those numbers divided by 2. In this case, we have three numbers: Harriet, Adrian, and Zach. Their ages in three years will be:
Harriet + Adrian + Zach = (21 + 63 + X)
where X is Zach's current age. To find the average age, we need to divide the sum by 3:
(21 + 63 + X)/3
To simplify this expression, we can first add 21 and 63:
21 + 63 = 84
Then we can add X to both sides:
(84 + X)/3
Finally, we can simplify further by dividing by 3:
(84 + X)/3 = 28
Solving for X gives us:
X = 27
So Zach is currently 27 years old. Now we can calculate the average age of all three people in three years:
(21 + 63 + 27)/3 = 28
Therefore, the average age of Harriet, Adrian, and Zach in three years is 28 years old."
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points, and Yuri scored half as many points more than Naomi, which is 68/2 = 34 points. So Yuri scored 34 points. Now we can use the information that Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi to find out how many points she scored. 17 + 68 = 85 points. Therefore, Brianna scored 85 points. Finally, we need to add up all these scores to find out how many points the four students scored in total: 68 + 34 + 85 = 257 points. But we are given that the sum of their scores is 251 points, so we can deduce that Jojo scored 251 - 257 = 6 points.
Response:  We know that Carmen needs 10 minutes to solve a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve a Sudoku puzzle. If she solved 3 crossword puzzles over the weekend (each taking 10 minutes), then she spent 3 x 10 = 30 minutes solving crossword puzzles. Similarly, if she solved 8 Sudoku puzzles (each taking 5 minutes), then she spent 8 x 5 = 40 minutes solving Sudoku puzzles. In total, Carmen spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
Response:  First, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, there are now 120 - 90 = 30 liters left in the tank. Now, if Celine collected twice as much rainwater as was left in the tank, she collected 2 x 30 = 60 liters of rainwater. Therefore, there are currently 30 + 60 = 90 liters of water in the tank.
"Response:  We know that Andy plants fewer geraniums than petunias. So if he plants x geraniums, he must plant more petunias since there are only 40 of them. How many more petunias does he plant than geraniums? Since there are 90 - x geraniums and 40 petunias, we can set up an equation:

90 - x = 40 + y (where y is the number of more petunias)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 50

So Andy plants 50 geraniums and 40 + 50 = 90 petunias. Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers (50 geraniums and 90 petunias)."
"Response:  We know that the firm spent $15,000 per year for advertising for two years. So we can calculate as follows:
Year 1:
Advertising expense = $15,000

Year 2:
Advertising expense = $15,000 x (1/3) = $5,000

Total advertising expense for both years = $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000"
"Response:  We know that Carlos rents a canoe for 3 hours at $30 per hour, so he will pay:

Carlos = 3 x $30 = $90

Benji rents a banana water slide for 5 hours at $18 per hour, so he will pay:

Benji = 5 x $18 = $90

Therefore, the total amount they will pay is:

Total = $90 + $90 = $180"
Response:  We know that it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half as many days (3 days) to drive there. So if Andrew plans to take the bus to Rochester and then drive back, he will spend 6 + 3 = 9 days on his trip.
"Response:  We know that James has 30 fire-type cards, 20 plant-type cards, and 40 water-type cards. If he puts away 8 of his water-type cards and buys 14 plant-type cards, we can calculate the new number of each type as follows:

* Fire-type cards remain unchanged at 30.
* Plant-type cards increase from 20 to 20 + 14 = 34.
* Water-type cards decrease from 40 to 40 - 8 = 32.

Now, let's calculate the probability that a randomly drawn card will be a water-type card. To do this, we need to divide the number of water-type cards remaining after James put away some of them (i.e., 32) by the total number of cards left in James' deck (which is 30 + 34 = 64).

So, the probability that a randomly drawn card will be a water-type card is:

Probability = (number of water-type cards remaining) / (total number of cards left in deck)
= (32) / (64)
= 0.50 or 50%

Therefore, there is a 50% chance that a randomly drawn card will be a water-type card."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Chad paid for his burrito without any extras. The base price of a simple burrito is 6.50$. Next, he added some extras:  
Fleisch (2$); Käse (1$); Avocado (1$); and two sauces (0.25$ each). So, in total, he spent:  
6.50 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 9.75$ on extras. Now, let's add the cost of the burrito with all the extras:  
9.75 + 6.50 = 16.25$. However, Chad has a gift card worth 5$, so he can subtract that from the total amount he needs to pay:  
16.25 - 5 = 11.25$. Therefore, Chad still owes 11.25$ for his meal."
"Response:  We know that Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place half as many pieces per minute. So, if we assume that Kalinda places x pieces in one hour, then her mother will place (x/2) pieces in one hour. To find out how many hours it takes to complete the puzzle, we need to set up an equation based on this information. Here is the equation:

(x + (x/2)) = 360

Simplifying the equation:

2x + x/2 = 360

Combine like terms:

3x = 360

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 120

So, Kalinda can place 120 pieces in one hour, and her mother can place 60 pieces in one hour. Since there are 360 pieces in total, they will need:

Kalinda: 120/4 = 30 minutes
Mother: 60/2 = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take them 30 minutes each to complete the puzzle."
"Response:  We know that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested when Ashlyn first arrived at the farm after two months. This means that 70% of the watermelons were not yet ripe for harvesting. Now, we are told that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe for harvesting two weeks later. To find out how many watermelons were not yet ripe for harvesting, we need to calculate the percentage of watermelons that were not yet ripe and then multiply it by the total number of watermelons. So, let's start with the calculation:

70% (not yet ripe) x 120 (total watermelons) = 84 (watermelons not yet ripe)

Therefore, there were 84 watermelons that were not yet ripe for harvesting after two weeks."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Mark pays for each car:  
12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000 (total cost)  
Since he has to pay 10% tax on the total cost, we can calculate the amount of tax as follows:  
$240,000 x 10% = $24,000 (tax amount)  
Now, let's add the tax and registration fees to get the final amount that Mark needs to pay:  
$240,000 + $24,000 + $1,000 x 12 = $265,000 (final amount)  
Therefore, Mark needs to pay $265,000 in total for the fleet of 12 cars."
Response:  We know that Kylie collected 5 more muscles than Robert on Monday, so if Robert collected 20 muscles, then Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 muscles on Monday. On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, which means she collected 2 x 25 = 50 muscles. Therefore, Kylie collects 50 muscles on Tuesday.
Response:  If there are 50 ants in the garden and each ant eats 2 apples per day (we assume that all ants eat the same amount), then there must be at least 100 apple seeds consumed per day (50 ants x 2 apples/ant/day). Since Dax found half of the apples to have many insects like ants or beetles inside them, let's assume that each apple contains an average of 4 insects (half of which are ants). Therefore, if there are 100 apple seeds consumed per day, then there must be approximately 400 insects in the garden (100 apple seeds / 4 insects/seed). So, the total number of insects in the garden is around 400, including both ants and other types of insects.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 penguins sunbathing and we also know that one-third of them dive into the ocean (12) and another third go to their cave to eat dinner (12). So, how many penguins are left?  
36 - 12 - 12 =?
The answer is 12. There are 12 penguins still sunbathing."
Response:  If Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and his friend eats half as much (i.e., 3), then together they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day. Since each plant produces 3 tomatoes per week, Steve needs 9 / 3 = 3 plants to meet his daily demand. Therefore, he needs 3 x 52 = 156 plants per year to satisfy his tomato cravings.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend should get 4 pieces of pizza. So we need to calculate how many groups of 4 pieces of pizza we can make with 8 portions of pizza. Can you do that for me?
"Response:  If he uses five empty sticks to fill one stick, then he can make five new sticks with the remaining tint. So if he has 25 sticks and wants to make five new ones, how many sticks will be left after using five of them to fill up the others?  
The answer is 20 (25 - 5 = 20)."
"Response:  First, we know that Johnny had $20 + $10 = $30 of starting capital. We also know that his money tripled in one year, so we can multiply his initial amount by 3 to find out how much he had after one year:

$30 x 3 = $90

So, after one year, Johnny had $90."
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jessa. So we can start with these equations:
Mary = Joan - 2
Jessa = Mary + 5
Now we need to find out how old each of them is when Jessa is 20 years old. So let's substitute 20 for Jessa in the first equation:
Mary = Joan - 2
Mary = Joan - 2 + 5 (since Jessa is 20)
We get:
Mary = Joan + 3
Now we have all three ages:
Joan = Mary + 2
Mary = Joan + 3
Jessa = Mary + 5
So the sum of their ages is:
Joan + Mary + Jessa =?
= (Joan + 2) + (Mary + 3) + (Jessa + 5)
= (Joan + 2) + (Mary + 3) + (20 + 5)
= (Joan + 2) + (Mary + 3) + 25
The sum of their ages is 51."
Response:  We know that there are 1000 students in total and 30% of them left through exit A, which is 300 students (1000 x 0.3). Now we have 700 students remaining (1000 - 300). Of these, 3/5 or 420 students (700 x 0.6) left through exit B. So now we have 280 students remaining (700 - 420). Finally, all of these 280 students left through exit C, so the number of students who left through exit C is 280.
"Response:  We know that James has 6 more bonbons than Robert. So if Robert has x bonbons, then James has x + 6 bonbons. Now we are told that John has double the number of bonbons as Robert. Therefore, John has 2x bonbons. Since John has 54 bonbons, we can set up the equation:  

2x = 54

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 54

x = 27

Now we can find out how many bonbons James has:

James has 6 more than Robert, so:

James has x + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 bonbons.

Therefore, John has more bonbons than James (54 > 33)."
Response:  If Dolly reads her two books and Pandora reads one book, then together they will have read three books (2 + 1 = 3).
"Response: 

1. Total time spent writing per week = (2 x 2 pages/week) x (5 minutes/page) = 40 minutes/week
2. Number of weeks in a year = 52
3. Total hours spent writing per year = (40 minutes/week) x (52 weeks/year) = 2,080 minutes/year
4. Time spent writing per hour = 2,080 minutes/year / 52 weeks/year = 39.6 minutes/hour

Therefore, Mike spends approximately 39.6 hours per year writing letters to his two remaining pen pals."
"Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 minutes per month and he uses 300 minutes for his daily calls with other people. So we can subtract 300 from 1000 to find out how many minutes he has left.  
1000 - 300 =?

Now we need to divide the remaining minutes by the number of days in the month (which is 30).  

1000 - 300 =? / 30

Can you solve this problem and tell me the result?"
Response:  We know that Kyle took 5 apples from Griffin, and Billy took double as many as Kyle. So, Billy took 10 apples (since 2 x 5 = 10). Now, we also know that Ginger gave some of her apples to Griffin, but not all of them. If Griffin had 27 apples left after everyone took their share, then Ginger must have given him at least 7 apples (since 27 - 5 - 10 = 7). Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 7 apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in both aquariums is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So if we let X be the number of fish in each aquarium, then we can write an equation based on this information:

X + X = 4 + 32 (since there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in the other)

Simplifying the equation:

2X = 4 + 32

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2X = 36

Dividing both sides by 2:

X = 18

So there are 18 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  We know that the makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours each day (3 x 6 = 18 hours/week). Since she needs to redo her makeup every week for 4 weeks (5 weeks total), we can calculate the total amount of money she earns as follows:

Total hours worked = 5 weeks x 18 hours/week = 90 hours
Total amount earned = 90 hours x $250/hour = $22,500

Now, since the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, we need to subtract 10% of the total amount earned from the original amount:

Discounted amount = $22,500 x 10% = $2,250

Final amount paid to Jean = $22,500 - $2,250 = $20,250"
"Response:  We know that Isabelle spent a total of 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 98 dollars on party supplies. She wants to divide these costs equally among three people (her two parents). So each person would pay:  
98 / 3 = 32 dollars."
"Response:  We know that each sack of onions weighs 50 pounds and costs $1.50 per pound. So if the cook bought 4 sacks of onions, they spent:

4 x 50 = 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300

Therefore, the cook spent $300 on onions."
Response:  We know that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday (so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies). On Tuesday, she ate double the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday (so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies). In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories more than her sister.
