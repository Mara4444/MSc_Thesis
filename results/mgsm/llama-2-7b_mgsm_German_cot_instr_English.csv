"Response: 
Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes four muffins every day. That means she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left to sell at the farmer's market.
She sells each fresh egg for $2, so she makes $2 x 13 = $26 from selling eggs at the farmer's market."
Response:  The ratio of blue to white wool is 2:1, which means that for every 2 knots of blue wool, there is half as many knots of white wool. Therefore, if we need 2 knots of blue wool, we will also need half as many knots of white wool, or 1 knot. So, in total, we need 3 knots (2 blue + 1 white).
"Response:  The value of the house before renovation was $80,000 (the price he paid for it). After renovations, the value increased to $240,000 ($80,000 x 150%). So, his profit is:
Profit = Selling Price - Purchase Price
= $240,000 - $80,000
= $160,000
Therefore, Josh makes a profit of $160,000 from selling the renovated house."
Response:  If James runs three times per week and each run is 60 meters long, then he will run in total... (1)...3 x 60 = 180 meters per week.
Response:  We know that Wendi feeds her chickens three times a day with mixed hen feed, seeds, mealworms, and vegetables to keep them healthy. She divides the food into three separate meals. In the morning, she gives each of her 20 hens 15 tablespoons (or 375 ml) of food. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 tablespoons (or 625 ml) of food. So, if we calculate how much food is needed for one hen per day......we get: Total amount of food needed per day = Number of hens x Amount of food per hen per day = 20 hens x 15 tablespoons/day = 300 tablespoons (or 750 ml) Now, let's find out how many tablespoons are needed for the last meal of the day: Last meal of the day = Total amount of food needed per day / Number of hens = 300 tablespoons / 20 hens = 15 tablespoons (or 375 ml) Therefore, Wendi needs 15 tablespoons (or 375 ml) of food to give to her 20 hens for their last meal of the day.
Response:  If each glass costs $5 and every additional glass costs 60% of its original price, then we can write an equation based on that information: Glass 1 = $5 Glass n = ($5 x 60%) + $5 Where n is the number of glasses Kylar wants to buy (in this case, 16). Now we need to find out how much one glass costs in total. So let's substitute n=16 into the equation above: $5Glass 1 = ($5 x 60%) + $5 Glass 16 = ($5 x 60%) + ($5 x 15) = $80 + $75 = $155 Therefore, Kylar will have to pay $155 for all 16 glases he wants to buy.
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if we multiply these two ratios together, we get: Toulouse has 2 x 2 = 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Toulouse has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Charleston has 2 x 4 = 8 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep. So, altogether they have 80 + 8 + 20 = 128 sheep.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download 2 GB per minute. So, to find out how long it will take to download a file of 200 GB, we need to divide the size of the file (in GB) by the downloading speed (in GB/minute):

Time = Size / Speed
= 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
= 100 minutes

So, it will take Carla 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to download the file."
Response:  We know that John traveled for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour, which means he covered a distance of 180 miles (60 x 3). Then, after turning around and slowing down to 30 miles per hour, he traveled for half an hour, covering a distance of 30 miles (at 30 miles per hour). Finally, he traveled for another 4 hours at a constant speed of 80 miles per hour, covering a distance of 320 miles (80 x 4). Therefore, the total distance from John's starting point to his destination is: 180 + 30 + 320 = 530 miles.
"Response: 
Eliza works for 40 hours per week at $10/hour = $400/week.
For the additional 5 hours (45 - 40), she earns $1.2 \* 5 = $6 extra per hour = $30 total.
So, her total weekly income is $400 + $30 = $430."
Response:  In the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times. If in the second month it was downloaded three times as many times (i.e., 180), then in total during these two months it was downloaded 240 times. However, in the third month there was a 30% decrease, which means that the number of downloads decreased to 172 (240 x 0.7 = 172). Therefore, the overall number of downloads during these three months was 240 + 172 = 412.
Response:  The total cost of donuts is 3 x 68 = 204 USD. The total cost of mini cupcakes is 2 x 80 = 160 USD. And the total cost of mini cheesecakes is 6 x 55 = 330 USD. Therefore, the total cost is 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 USD.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree for one year:
Total Cost = Planting Cost + Maintenance Cost
= $90 (planting) + $3 (maintenance)
= $93 per year
Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the citrus fruits:
Revenue = Number of Citrus Fruits x Selling Price
= 7 (fruits/year) x $1.50 (per fruit)
= $10.50 per year
Now, let's find out how many years it will take for Carlos to break even or start making profit:
Break Even Time = Total Cost / Revenue
= $93 / $10.50
= 9 years
Therefore, it will take Carlos 9 years to make money with his lemon tree."
"Response:  We know that Melanie has sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house and half of the remaining ones at the orange house. So, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. To find out how many she started with, we can use the information given in the question: ""Melanie starts selling her vacuum cleaners."" This means that she had some number of vacuum cleaners to start with. Therefore, the answer is 5 + x, where x is the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had."
Response:  We know that 20% of the students have registered for contemporary dance and 25% of the remaining students have registered for jazz dance. This means that 45% (20 + 25) of the students have registered for one of these two styles. Therefore, the percentage of students who have registered for hip hop is equal to 100 - 45 = 55%. So, 55% of all students have registered for hip hop.
"Response:  The value of the jewelry is $5,000 and the value of electronics is $8,000. If we assume that both markets will increase by their respective percentages at the end of the month, then... See full solution
The post Formulating a Numeric Answer appeared first on Chegg Writing."
Response:  On day one, both trains travel west for 80 miles and then turn north. So, each train travels 80 + 150 = 230 miles in total. Therefore, the answer is 230 miles.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jill earns per week as a teacher and as a coach. As she works 35 weeks as a teacher and 15 hours per week as a coach, her total weekly income is:
Teaching income = 35 weeks x $20/hour = $700/week
Cheering income = 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week
Now, let's calculate her annual income based on the number of working weeks in a year:
Annual teaching income = $700/week x 50 weeks = $35,000/year
Annual coaching income = $450/week x 50 weeks = $22,500/year
So, Jill's total annual income is:
$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500/year"
Response:  Claire prepares an omelette for breakfast every day using 3 eggs. So, in one week she uses 21 eggs (7 days x 3 eggs/day). In 4 weeks, she will use 84 eggs (4 weeks x 21 eggs/week). Therefore, within 4 weeks, Claire consumes 84 dutzend eggs or 840 eggs.
"Response:  If she walked for 1 hour and covered 4 miles during that time, then her average speed was 4/1 = 4 miles per hour. To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining distance of 8 miles, we can use the formula:

Remaining distance / Time taken = Average speed

In this case, the remaining distance is 8 miles, and the time taken so far is 1 hour. So, we can plug these values into the formula:

8 miles / 1 hour = 8 miles/hour

Therefore, if Marissa wants to cover the remaining distance with an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she must walk at a speed of 8 miles per hour for the next 3 hours."
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice with two-thirds water and want to mix it with another 15 liters of ananas getränk (which is also two-thirds water). So we have a total volume of 26 liters (10 + 15) of liquid. When we add them together, we get 31 liters (26 x 2/3 = 31). Since we lost one liter during the mixing process, there are actually 30 liters of liquid left over (31 - 1 = 30).
Response:  We know that Raymon...
"Response: 
Step 1: First 3 customers buy each one DVD = 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs sold in total.
Step 2: Next 2 customers buy each two DVDs = 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs sold in total.
Step 3: Last three customers don't buy any DVDs = 0 DVDs sold in total.
Total number of DVDs sold = 3 + 4 - 0 = 7 DVDs.
Therefore, Billy has sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
Response:  The kerze shrinks by 2 cm every hour it burns. So if we know how many hours the candle will burn, we can calculate its final length directly. In this case, the candle will burn from 13 o'clock to 5 o'clock (8 hours). Therefore, after 8 hours of burning, the candle will be 16 - 2 = 14 cm shorter than when it started.
Response:  The original price of the book was $X dollars. Since Kyle got a discount of 25%, he paid $\frac{X}{4}$ = $9.75$ dollars for the book (since $4\%$ is equal to $\frac{1}{4}$). So, the original price of the book was $X \times \frac{4}{3} = 24.25$ dollars.
"Response:  We know that Marie has paid a total of $50 for her food and drinks. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 

$50 = x + y + z + w

where x is the cost of the chicken dish, y is the cost of the milk, z is the cost of the apples, and w is the cost of the pizza. Since we are given that Marie spent $12 on the chicken dish, we can substitute this value into our equation: 

$50 = $12 + y + z + w

Now, we are also given that Marie bought 5 packs of milk, each costing $3. Therefore, the total amount she spent on milk is: 

y = 5 \* $3 = $15

So, we can rewrite our equation as follows: 

$50 = $12 + $15 + z + w

We are also told that Marie bought 4 apples, each costing $1.50. Therefore, the total amount she spent on apples is: 

z = 4 \* $1.50 = $6

Finally, we are given that Marie bought a few schachtels of pizza, each costing $8.50. However, since we don't know exactly how many schachtels she bought, we cannot determine the exact value of w. Nevertheless, we can estimate it based on the available information. For example, if Marie bought 2 schachtels of pizza, then she would have spent $8.50 x 2 = $17 on pizza alone. In any case, we can include this value in our equation: 

$50 = $12 + $15 + $6 + $17

Simplifying the above equation, we get: 

$50 = $48

Therefore, Marie must have bought at least 48 schachtels of pizza. Note that this is just an estimate, as we do not know the exact number of schachtels she purchased."
Response:  Mishka has bought 3 pairs of shorts, which cost $16.50 x 3 = $49.50. She also bought 3 pairs of pants, which cost $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes, which cost $42 x 3 = $126. So in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 dollars for her clothes.
"Response:  If Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream per night and buys ice cream cartons with 15 portions of ice cream for $4.00 each, then she spends money as follows:
Cynthia spends $4.00 x 15 = $60.00 per day on ice cream.
Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia has spent a total of $60.00 x 60 = $3,600.00 on ice cream."
"Response:  We know that Henry has two stops during his tour and he covers a total distance of 60 miles. After the first stop, he travels for x miles before taking the second stop. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Distance = Total distance - (x + 20) Where ""x"" is the distance traveled between the first and second stops. Now, we are given that the second stop was 15 miles away from the end of the tour. So, we can substitute this value in the above equation to get: Distance = 60 - (x + 20) = 60 - 35 = 25 miles. Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
Response:  The total cost of both pairs of high heels is $33 + 2 \* $33 = $132$. Since Gloria has to choose between these two options and the stilettos, we can assume that the stilettos cost $50. So, the difference in cost between the stilettos and either pair of high heels is $50 - ($33 + $33) = $50 - $66 = $-16$. Therefore, the stilettos cost $50.
Response:  We know that Darrell is 7 times older than Allen, so their combined age is 7 x 11 = 77 years old now. In 10 years, Allen will be (77 + 10) / 7 = 84 years old.
Response:  The first friend said there are 80 Gummibärchen in the glass. The second friend added 20 more than half of that, which is 40 (half of 80 is 40). So far, we have 120 Gummibärchen. Now, the third friend said that their estimate is 25% more than the first friend's estimate, which means they estimated 120 + (25% of 120) = 120 + 30 = 150 Gummibärchen. Therefore, the average of all three estimates is 150.
Response:  Each dog needs 0.5 hours of exercise and business per day, so in total, John takes care of 10 dogs for 0.5 hours x 10 = 5 hours per day. Therefore, he spends 5 hours per week taking care of the dogs.
Response:  If Gretchen has 110 coins in total and there are 30 more gold than silver coins, then the number of silver coins is 80 (110 - 30 = 80). Since each silver coin contains 5 cents, the value of all silver coins is 400 cents (80 x 5 cents = 400 cents). Now we know that the value of all gold coins is equal to the remaining amount minus the value of the silver coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins is 70 (400 - 400 = 0), since Gretchen has 110 coins in total and only 30 are gold coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has more than half of Raymond's jewelry pieces, so if Raymond has 40 pieces, then Aaron has at least 40 / 2 = 20 pieces. Now we subtract the number of pieces that Siobhan has from the total number of pieces that Aaron has: 20 - x = 40. Solving for x, we get x = 20. So Siobhan has 20 jewelry pieces.
"Response: 
Mike played for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. So he scored 4/40 = 1 point per minute during this period.
In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than his previous rate, which means he scored (1 + 25%) x 40 = 50 points.
Therefore, Mike scored a total of 4 + 50 = 54 points."
Response:  Terry eats two joghurts per day and he pays $5 for 4 joghurts in total. So, if we divide $5 by 4, we get $1.25 per joghurt. Therefore, within 30 days, Terry will pay $1.25 x 30 = $37.50 for 30 joghurts.
"Response:  If John sells all of his Lego sets for $15 each and uses that money to buy video games at $20 each, he will have spent a total of:
$15 x 13 = $195 on Lego sets
$20 x 8 = $160 on video games
So, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left over after buying both. Therefore, he has 35 / 13 = 2 Lego sets remaining."
"Response: 
John runs for 60 miles per week, which means he runs for x hours per week. Since he runs 3 days a week, we can write this as:
x = 60 / 3 = 20 hours/week
Now, let's analyze each day of running separately:
Day 1: John runs for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of x = 3 \* 60 / 3 = 20 miles in one hour.
Day 2 and Day 3: John runs for half the time he ran on Day 1, i.e., x / 2 = 10 miles per hour.
Therefore, John's total weekly running distance is:
Total distance = x + (x / 2) + (x / 2) = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 miles
So, John runs at a speed of 40 miles per hour."
"Response:  If Dana can run at 4 times her walking speed and she walks at 2 miles per hour (mph), then she runs at 8 mph. Since she can only hop at half of her running speed, she can only hop at 4 mph. Therefore, in one hour, she can cover 60 miles if she runs and 30 miles if she hops. Now, let's calculate how many miles she can cover within six hours:

Running time = 6 hours - 2 hours (time spent hopping) = 4 hours
Distance covered while running = 60 miles / 4 hours = 15 miles per hour
Total distance covered = 15 x 6 = 90 miles
Therefore, Dana can cover 90 miles within six hours."
"Response:  According to the problem statement:
Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone. So Ben's iPhone is 2 times 1 year = 2 years older than Suzy's iPhone.
Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So Brandon's iPhone is 4 times 2 years = 8 years older than Suzy's iPhone.
Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years older than Suzy's iPhone."
Response:  If Polly can throw the golden spear 400 feet with the sapphire stone in her hand, that means she can throw it 1200 feet (400 x 3) without the stone. Since the dragon's flames only reach 1000 feet, Polly could stand at most 200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the spear.
Response:  We know that Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the firefighters' lunch and cut each pie into 8 slices. So, she had 5 x 8 = 40 slices of apple pie on the buffet table. After everyone had eaten their fill and there were leftovers, there were still 40 - 5 = 35 slices left over. Therefore, the number of pieces that the guests took was 35.
"Response:  If one serving of chips contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, then the total number of calories in that bag is:

Total calories = Number of servings x Calories per serving
= 5 x 250
= 1250 calories

Now, if you want to know how many grams of chips you can eat while staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000, we need to divide the total calories in the bag by your daily calorie goal:

Grams of chips = Total calories / Daily calorie goal
= 1250 / 2000
= 0.625 kg or approximately 625 grams

So, based on these calculations, you could safely consume around 625 grams (or about half a kilogram) of chips from a 300g bag while staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000."
Response:  Firstly, we know that one pound of beeswax can produce 10 candles (since each pound of wax yields 10 candles). Therefore, if Charlie sells these candles for $2 per piece, he will make $2 x 10 = $20 in revenue from just one pound of wax. Now, let's consider the cost of producing these candles. We are told that the equipment needed to process one pound of wax costs $10, and this includes both the doche (a small metal tool used in the beeswax casting process) as well as other supplies. So, the total cost of producing these candles is $10 + $10 = $20. This means that Charlie has a profit margin of $20 - $20 = $0, since his revenue ($20) equals his cost ($20) exactly. If he produces 20 candles using one pound of wax, then his net gain would still be zero.
Response:  On Monday, she wrote 5 articles, which means she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing articles that day. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 = 0.4 articles, which means she spent 0.4 x 4 = 1.6 hours writing articles that day. Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles on those three days is 20 + 1.6 = 21.6 hours.
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her handbag before she left for work and then bought another pack of 10 at the store during her break (for a total of 90). At work, she stuck one note to each of 220 cups of coffee (giving her a total of 242 notes used so far). So, if there are 23 notes remaining, that means she must have started with 90 + 242 = 332 Post-it notes in total!
"Response:  We know that John buys twice as many red as blue shirts. So if he bought x blue shirts, he bought 2x red shirts. Since each blue shirt costs $40, and each red shirt costs $50% more than the blue ones, we can write: 
$$ \text{Cost of } x\text{ blue shirts} = 40\times x $$
$$ \text{Cost of } (2x)\text{ red shirts} = 50\%\times(40\times x) $$
Now we have two equations:
$$ 40x = 200 $$
$$ 160x = 70\%\times(40x) $$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$ x = 30 $$
So John spent $300 for blue shirts ($40 per shirt $\times$ 30 shirts) and $420 for red shirts ($50% more than $300). Therefore, John has spent a total of $720."
Response:  The length of the piece of wire is given as 4 feet (which is equal to 48 inches). Since each piece of wire was cut into 6-inch long pieces, we can find out how many pieces she had by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces. So, Tracy had 8 pieces of wire.
Response:  We know that there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. So, the total number of apartments is 15 x 8 = 120. Now, we are told that 3/4 of the building is inhabited, which means that 3/4 of 120 = 90 apartments are occupied. Therefore, there are 30 apartments (90 - 60) that are unoccupied or empty.
Response:  How many eggs does Lloyd have in total per day? He has 252 eggs/day x 7 days = 1764 eggs/week. Now how much money will he make from selling these eggs? He makes $2/dzt. So, his weekly income from egg sales is $1764 x $2 = $3528. Therefore, Lloyd earns $3528 per week from selling eggs.
"Response: 
Toms Schiff can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 4 hours (from 13 to 16 o'clock). This means he has traveled a distance of 4 x 10 = 40 miles during this time.
Now, he will return with a speed of 6 miles per hour for 2 hours (from 16 to 18 o'clock). So, he will cover a distance of 2 x 6 = 12 miles during this time.
Therefore, the total distance Toms Schiff needs to travel is 40 + 12 = 52 miles."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Uriah has to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. This means he has 15 pounds of books in total. Now, let's calculate how many comics and toys are in each pound. We know that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so there are 4 comics per pound. Similarly, each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so there are 2 toys per pound. Therefore, if Uriah removes 15 pounds of books, then he will have 15 x 4 = 60 comics and 15 x 2 = 30 toys left in his bag. So, he needs to take out 30 more toys. 
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 last wagon tires and 4 car tires, so he earned $6 x 6 = $36 for last wagon tires and $4 x 4 = $16 for car tires, totaling $52. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires but did not repair any last wagon tires, so he earned $4 x 12 = $48 for car tires only, totaling $90. Therefore, the mechanic made more money on Friday than on Thursday.
Response:  The Doubtfires have already adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother then tells them that their two housecats, Patchy and Trixie, have just given birth to kittens. According to their mother, Patchy has three times as many kittens as the ones they adopted, which means she had 3 x 7 = 21 kittens in total. Similarly, Trixie had 12 kittens in total. Therefore, the total number of kittens owned by the Doubtfires is 21 + 12 = 33 kittens.
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 lollipops and he eats 2 of them. So, there are 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. To pack these into bags with 2 lollipops each, we can fill 28 / 2 = 14 bags. Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with his remaining lollipops.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn each time he goes to the movies, then his total cost per trip is $14 ($7 + $7). Since he has $42 available for the week, he can go to the movies $\boxed{42 / 14 = 3}$ times.
"Response:  The total weight of the truck and its load is given as 3755 pounds (or 1698 kg). Since each kit weighs 15 pounds (or 6.8 kg), the number of kits that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is:

Maximum number of kits = Total weight of truck + Load - Weight of bridge
= 3755 lb + 0 lb - 5000 lb
= 2250 kgs / 6.8 kg/kit
= 333 kits
Therefore, the maximum number of kits that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 333 kits."
Response:  The total cost of the order was $40.00 + (25% x $40.00) = $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00. So, the end price for Stephen's groceries would be $53.00.
Response:  The himber tree has 6 traubs with each having 20 frutes and 67 individual fruits distributed over the straighrt. So, we can calculate the total number of himbeers as follows: Total nof himbeers = Number of traubs x Number of frutes per trayb x Number of individuial fruits per fruit Total nof himbeers = 6 x 20 x 67 = 1322 himbeers Therefore, there are 1322 himbeers in total.
"Response:  The total number of oranges in the basket is 25. Now, let's analyze each orange separately:
Good: 7 (25 - 1 = 24, and 24 / 4 = 6)
Unripe: 4 (20% of 25 = 5, and 5 / 4 = 1.25)
Sour: 2 (2/25 = 0.08)
So, there are 6 good oranges in the basket."
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for material cost, then $800 for jeweler cost, and finally $80 (10% of $800) for insurance. So, in total, she had to pay $660.
"Response:  If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000 per year, then her total pension amount is:

$50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000

After 20 years, she will receive 5% of the value of the annual pension each year, which is:

$2,000,000 x 5% = $100,000 per year

So, after 20 years, her annual pension amount becomes:

$2,000,000 - $100,000 = $1,900,000

Now, let's calculate her annual pension amount after 30 years:

$1,900,000 x 5% = $95,000 per year

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension amount after 30 years is $1,900,000 - $95,000 = $1,805,000."
Response:  For the first half of the year (January to June), Aleena will pay $140 x 6 = $840. For the second half of the year (July to December), she will pay ($140 x 6) x 0.9 = $1260. Therefore, the total amount she will pay for the entire year is $840 + $1260 = $2100.
Response:  We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles since her last fill-up and needed to refill her tank with 4 gallons of gasoline to get it back up to full capacity. The manual says that her tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline. So, if we divide the number of gallons she needs to refill (4) by the amount of gasoline her tank can hold (12), we get the number of miles she can drive on one fill-up: 4 / 12 = 0.33 or approximately 33 miles. Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 33 miles with one fill-up of gasoline.
"Response: 
Jim watches TV for 2 hours per session and reads for half that time (i.e., 1 hour). Since he does this three times a week, he spends a total of:

TV watching = 3 x 2 hours/session = 6 hours/week
Reading = 3 x 1 hour/session = 3 hours/week
Total time spent = 6 + 3 = 9 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Jim spends a total of:

9 hours/week x 4 weeks = 36 hours/month

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours per month watching TV and reading."
Response:  Each school has one boys' and girls' team, so there are two teams per school for a total of 8 teams (4 schools x 2 teams/school). Then each team has 5 players plus 1 coach, so the total number of people sent by each school is 6 + 1 = 7. Therefore, the total number of people that all four schools have sent to the tournament is 7 x 4 = 28.
Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, if we subtract 35 from 175, we get 140 rubies. Additionally, we are told that twice as many smaragdes as rubies were in the chest. Therefore, if we multiply 140 rubies by 2, we get 280 smaragdes. In total, then, there were 175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 smaragdes = 695 edelstones in the treasure chest.
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in school. So if there are x girls, then there are 2x boys. Since each teacher has 60 students (30 girls and 30 boys), we can set up the equation: 
x + 2x = 180
Simplifying the equation: 
3x = 180
Dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 60
So, there are 6 teachers in total."
Response:  At first, Bailey had $X dollars. Then she received weekly payments of $5 for 8 weeks, which means she got a total of $40 ($5 x 8). So at the end, Bailey had $X + $40 = $100. Therefore, Bailey started with $X = 60 dollars.
"Response: 
Judy teaches 5 courses per week, and each course has 15 students. So, she teaches a total of 75 students (5 x 15 = 75).
If each student pays $15, then Judy earns a total of $1125 ($75 x $15 = $1125) per week."
Response:  The first recipe has 20 anvisions, and the second one is twice as long as the first, which means it has 40 instructions (2 x 20 = 40). So, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions in total to prepare both recipes.
Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each cheesecake slice for $4, then he will have earned $3 x 43 = $130 from brownies and $4 x 23 = $92 from cheesecake slices. Therefore, Tommy has collected a total of $130 + $92 = $222.
Response:  We know that Sheila bought five cell phones for $150 each with a three-month installment contract at an interest rate of 2% per month. To calculate how much she will pay every month, we can use the formula: Total Cost / Number of Installments = Monthly Payment. In this case, the total cost is $750 (5 x $150), and the number of installments is 3 months. So, Sheila will pay $750 / 3 = $250 per month for the next 3 months.
Response:  If we multiply each price by the number of flowers sold, we get: For Ringelblumen: 12 x $2.74 = $32.88 For Petunien: 9 x $1.87 = $16.53 For Begonien: 17 x $2.12 = $35.04 Total: $32.88 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $84.45 So, if Artie sells 12 trays of Ringelblumen, 9 trays of Petunien and 17 trays of Begonien, he will earn a total of $84.45.
"Response:  If each level of sandcastle has half the area of the previous one, then the area of the top level is 1/2^n, where n is the number of levels. Since there are 4 levels in total (as stated in the problem), we can write:

Area of top level = 1/2^4 = 1/16

So, the average area per level is:

Average area per level = Area of top level / Number of levels = 1/16 / 4 = 1/4

Therefore, the average area of each level of the sandcastle is 1/4 square meter."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Cecilia must feed her puppy with 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days (which is equal to 6 months). Then she must switch to feeding him 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of his life. So, if one cup of dog food contains 110 portions, then...

Cecilia will use 6 x 1 = 6 cups of dog food during the first 6 months (or 180 days) + 6 x 2 = 12 cups of dog food for the remaining 6 months (or 180 days) = Total amount of dog food used by Cecilia = 6 + 12 = 18 cups of dog food."
"Response:  We know that:
Raymond wäscht halb so viel Wäsche wie Sarah. So if Sarah wäscht x pounds of laundry, Raymond wäscht half of that amount, which is x/2 pounds.
Sarah wäscht 4 times as much laundry as David. So if David wäscht y pounds of laundry, Sarah wäscht 4y pounds.
Now we are given that Sarah wäscht 400 pounds of laundry. To find out how much laundry Raymond and David washed, we can use the following equation:
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry * (1/4)
So, for Raymond:
Raymond's laundry = 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds
And for David:
David's laundry = 400 pounds * (1/4) = 100 pounds"
Response:  If he buys blumen in 3-packs for $2.50 each, then he will spend $7.50 for 3 blumen ($2.50 x 3). If he buys them in 2-packs for $1 each, then he will spend $6 for 6 blumen ($1 x 6). So, if he buys all 18 blumen at the better price of $1 each, he will save $11 ($7.50 - $6).
Response:  The original price of the haircut is $100. Since it's John's first time at this frisor, he gets a discount of 30%. So, the new price would be... (do calculation)...which equals $70.
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters each, which is equal to 4 liters (since 24 / 6 = 4). Then, the boy got 6 liters more, so the total amount of water left after he drank it is: 4 + 6 = 10 liters. Therefore, there are 10 liters of water left.
"Response: 
Charlie had 10 stickers initially. Then he bought 21 more at the store. So, his total number of stickers became:

10 + 21 = 31

Later, he gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 for decorating a greeting card. Therefore, the number of stickers Charlie has left is:

31 - 9 = 22

So, Charlie has 22 stickers left."
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs less than 4 times the weight of Grace. So, if we multiply Grace's weight by 4, we get 480 pounds (125 x 4 = 480). Now, since Alex weighs less than this amount, his weight must be between 0 and 480 pounds. Therefore, Alex's weight is 275 pounds (since he weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times the weight of Grace). So, together they weigh 125 + 275 = 399 pounds.
Response:  If Dan plants 3 rose bushes and each rose bush bears 25 roses, then there are altogether 3 x 25 = 75 roses. Since each rose has 8 thorns, the total number of thorns is 75 x 8 = 600 thorns. Therefore, the answer is 600.
Response:  The team has played 22 games and won more than they lost. So, we can say that W = number of wins > L = number of losses. We are also given that W - L = 8. Now, we need to find out what is the value of W. Using the equation above, we get: W = L + 8 Substituting the values given in the question, we get: W = 22 + 8 = 30 Therefore, the football team has won 30 games.
"Response: 
Gene has been taking four vacations per year since he was 23 years old (which is now 34 years old). Therefore, he has taken 11 vacations so far (4 x 29 = 110).
Each vacation creates one section of the quilt. So, the total number of sections is also 110.
Therefore, Gene has 110 quilt sections or 110 Deckensegmente."
Response:  The wecker has rung four times when it first went off, and then three times at each subsequent time it rang (since it rings for as long as Greg doesn't turn it off). So in total, the wecker has rung 4 + 3 x 2 = 16 times.
Response:  The company pays $600 per month to each of its employees. If an employee has been working for exactly five years, their salary will be increased by 10% of the original amount, which is $60 (since the policy states that the increase is applied to all employees who have worked for at least five years). So, after three additional years of work, Sylvie's salary would be $720 ($600 x 1.10 = $660 + $60 = $720).
Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times as many records as Harald. So if Harald sold x records, Marilyn sold 10x records. Now we are told that together they sold 88,000 records. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 10x + x = 88,000. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x = 88,000 / 10 = 8,800. So Harald sold 8,800 records in total.
"Response:  We know that Christina invited 16 friends to her birthday party and she needs 0.75 gift bags for each guest. Since 1/4 of the guests did not show up, we need to adjust the number of gift bags accordingly. So, let's calculate how many gift bags are needed in total:
Gift bags needed = Total number of guests x Number of gift bags per guest / (Number of guests who showed up x 0.75)
= 16 x 0.75 / (16 x 0.75)
= 16 x 0.75 / 12
= 120 gift bags
So, Christina will need 120 gift bags for her birthday party."
"Response: 

Step 1: Calculate how much kartoffelsalat an adult dinosaur eats.
Adult dinosaur = 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of kartoffelsalat

Step 2: Calculate how much kartoffelsalat a young dinosaur eats.
Young dinosaur = half of what an adult dinosaur eats
= half of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of kartoffelsalat
= 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of kartoffelsalat

Step 3: Calculate total amount of kartoffelsalat needed for the picknic.
Total amount = number of participants x amount each participant needs to eat
= 20 adults + 5 children = 25 people

Each person needs = average amount of kartoffelsalat per person
= 10 pounds (4.5 kg) / 25 people
= 0.4 pounds (0.18 kg) of kartoffelsalat per person

Therefore, Ted should bring approximately 9 pounds (4 kg) of kartoffelsalat to the picnic to ensure that everyone has enough to eat."
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia (so Jan has 3x = 3 \* 4 = 12 pets).
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy (so Marcia has M = 5 pets), and Cindy has 4 pets.
Therefore, the total number of pets among all three is:
All together they have 12 + 5 + 4 = 21 pets."
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write this as:
Amy - 5 = Jackson
Jackson + 2 = Corey
Now, we are given that James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey. So, we can write this as:
James = Corey - 1
Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
Amy - 5 = Jackson
Jackson + 2 = Corey
Corey = Jacksoin + 2
James = Corey - 1
Therefore, Jackson is 8 years old."
Response:  If Lee can run the 400 meters hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, then Lee's time is 38 seconds and Gerald's time is 40 seconds. Since Gerald has improved his diet and increased his speed by 10%, he will be able to run the 400 meters hurdles in 35 seconds (38 x 1.1 = 42). Therefore, Gerald can run the 400 meters hurdles in 35 seconds.
"Response:  According to the problem statement:
1. The number of kaninchen is 12 times less than the number of hounds. So if there are x hounds, then there are 12x kaninchen.
2. If one dog has two cats as pets, and there are 60 dogs, then there are 60 x 2 = 120 cats as pets.
Now we have to find out how many haustieren (dogs + cats) there are in total. Using the information from point 1, we can say that the sum of all haustieren is equal to the product of the number of hounds and the ratio of kaninchen to hounds. Therefore, the total number of haustieren is:
Total number of haustieren = Number of hounds x Ratio of kaninchen to hounds
= 60 x 1/12
= 50
So there are 50 haustieren (dogs + cats) in the quarter."
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in class 5, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of girls are Pfadfinderinnen. So, we can write this as an equation: 2/5 x 160 = 2/3 x 80. Now, let's solve for the number of girls at the Pfadfinderinnen: 2/5 x 160 = 48 (since there are 5 times more boys than girls). Therefore, there are 48 girls at the Pfadfinderinnen.
Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for x hours, then we can write an equation as follows: 9 = x + 2x (since James slept for 2/3 of the time that Harry did). Solving for x, we get x = 7. So, Harry slept for 9 - 7 = 2 more hours than James.
Response:  If each dose of tomato sauce contains three tomatoes and Freda uses 16-ounce doses, then she must have used 5 doses (since there are 3 tomatoes per dose). Therefore, she has used 5 x 3 = 15 tomatoes.
"Response:  In the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, 20 cars pass through (since some cars have already passed through before the 15-minute mark). So, the number of cars that passed through during this time is 20.  
Now, let's calculate how many cars are left after 15 minutes. Since 5 cars have broken off from the queue and don't need to go through the traffic jam anymore, there are now 45 cars remaining in the queue (30 original cars minus 5 cars that broke off). Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the given time frame is 20 + (45 - 5) = 30 cars."
"Response: 
Mary has received 18 new topFPflanzen from her favorite nursery. She already had 2 topFPflanzen per each of the 40 window sills in her big house. So, she has total of 2 x 40 = 80 topFPflanzen.
Now, she wants to give away one topFPflanze from each windowsill tomorrow to friends and family. So, she will give away 80 - (number of topFPflanzen she gives away) = remaining topFPflanzen.
Therefore, Mary will have __________ topFPflanzen left after giving them away."
Response:  The first friend of Jerome has pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. So, the second friend must have pressed the doorbell 5 times (since he pressed it 1/4 as many times as the first friend). Now, the third friend must have pressed the doorbell 20 times (twice as much as the second friend), and the fourth friend must have pressed it 60 times (thrice as much as the third friend). Therefore, in total, the doorbell has been pressed 95 times (20 + 5 + 20 + 60)
"Response: 
Solo has to read 4 pages from his science book, 20 pages from his community book, 7 pages from his history book, and 8 pages from his geography book.
He reads 15 pages on Monday, so he has 4 days left to read the remaining pages.
To find out how many pages he needs to read per day, we can divide the total number of pages he needs to read by the number of days he has left:
Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages
Days left = 4 - 1 = 3 days
Pages per day = Total pages / Days left = 49 / 3 = 16 pages per day
Therefore, Solo must read approximately 16 pages per day for the next 3 days to finish reading all the required material."
Response:  On weekdays, John drinks one glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so he consumes three glasses of water per day (1 + 1 + 1 = 3). Since there are seven days in a week, John drinks a total of 21 glasses of water per week (3 x 7 = 21). However, on weekends, John prefers to relax and drink lemonade instead of water, so he does not consume any additional glasses of water during those days. Therefore, John drinks a total of 21 glasses of water per week.
"Response:  The distance from the sea to the opposite land is 42 miles (or 67 kilometers). Since it takes 10 minutes for the fog to cover each of the next 3 miles (or 4.8 kilometers) of the city, it will take:

Time = Distance / Speed = 67 km / 10 min/km = 6.7 hours

So, it will take the fog 6.7 hours to cover the entire city."
Response:  If Poppy has already placed a quarter of the puzzle pieces (25%), then her mother has placed a third of the remaining pieces (33%). So, in total, Poppy and her mother have placed 58% of the puzzle pieces (25% + 33%). This means that there are still 42% of the puzzle pieces left to be placed (100% - 58%). Therefore, 420 pieces (42% of 1000) remain to be placed.
Response:  If Cody eats three times more candies than Amir, that means Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 candies. So together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 candies.
Response:  The volume of each box is given as 3 × π × (5/2)² × (6/2) × (4/2) = 3π cubic inches. Since there are three boxes, their total volume is 3π cubic inches.
Response:  We know that Frankie watched TV for a total of 7 hours. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched one hour each night (so 2 hours in total). On Wednesday, he finished his homework earlier and watched two hours of TV (one hour of a 1-hour show + one hour of a 30-minute show = 2 hours). On Thursday, he also watched two hours of TV (one hour of a 1-hour show + one hour of a 30-minute show = 2 hours). And finally, on Friday, he watched two more hours of TV (two 1-hour shows = 2 hours). So, if we add up all these hours, we get: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 hours. Therefore, Frankie watched 8 hours of TV during the week.
Response:  Last year, Henry baked x keks. This year, he wants to bake twice as many (2x) and he actually bakes y keks more than last year (y > x). So, the total number of keks Henry baked this year is 2x + y = 110. Solving for x, we get x = 70. Therefore, Henry baked 70 keks last year.
"Response:  If we buy 10 gallons of gasoline at $3 per gallon, then the total cost would be:

$3 x 10 = $30

Now, let's apply the rebate of $20 offered by the app company. So, the net cost of buying 10 gallons of gasoline becomes:

$30 - $20 = $10

Therefore, after applying the rebate, the cost of 10 gallons of gasoline is $10."
"Response:  
Marcell has 3 rolls that are 14 rolls long, so he has a total of 42 rolls (3 x 14 = 42). 
Beatrice has 2 rolls that are 24 rolls long, so she has a total of 48 rolls (2 x 24 = 48). 
In total, they have eaten 90 rolls (42 + 48 = 90). 
So, in average, they have eaten 90/2 = 45 rolls each."
Response:  We know that the boat had a leak and took in two liters of water for every ten feet it traveled. So if it traveled twenty feet (20), it would have taken in four liters of water (2 x 20). Now we are told that Julia needed sixteen seconds to row those twenty feet, so she covered that distance at a rate of one foot per second (1 ft/s). Therefore, the distance she traveled during those sixteen seconds is: Distance = Speed x Time = 1 ft/s x 16 s = 16 feet. Since the shore was 64 seconds away, and Julia traveled 16 feet in that time, the amount of water the boat took in when she reached the shore can be calculated as follows: Water taken in = Distance / Time taken = 16 ft / 64 s = 0.25 liters. 
Response:  The teachers alternate using the classroom and each teacher has two lessons per day. Therefore, there are four periods of use per day (one for each teacher). Since the table is wiped three times per period, it will be wiped 12 times per day (4 periods x 3 wipes per period). So, the table is wiped 12 times per day.
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 blossoms per day and doesn't water them for 15 days (i.e., 15 x 2 = 30), then he will have planted a total of 60 blossoms (30 x 2 = 60). However, if 5 of these blossoms do not grow (as stated in the problem), then the actual number of grown blossoms is 60 - 5 = 55. Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan has 55 grown blossoms in his garden.
Response:  We know that Jamal's handy can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's handy. So if Brittany's handy can store 50 photos, then Jamal's handy can store 6 x 50 = 300 photos. Now we are told that Jamal's handy can store 1800 photos in total. Therefore, the number of ente...
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the wood that Sasha has bought. For the ten 2x4x10 brettes, she paid $10 each, so the total cost is $100. Similarly, for the five 4x4x10 brettes, she paid $16 each, so the total cost is $80. Therefore, the total cost of all the wood that Sasha has bought is $180. Now, let's find out how much money Sasha will make if she sells all this wood. She has 15 brettes (ten 2x4x10 + five 4x4x10) and each brette costs $10 or $16 depending on its size. So, if she sells them at their original price, she will make a total of $1500 ($10 x 15 brettes). However, since the prices have increased by 50%, she can now sell these brettes for $16 per piece instead of $10. This means that she will make an additional $900 ($16 x 15 brettes) from selling these brettes. Therefore, Sasha will make a total profit of $2400 ($1500 + $900) if she sells all the wood she has bought.
Response:  We know that Katy uses tea spoons with sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 7:13. This means she uses 7 tea spoons of sugar for every 13 cups of water she prepares. Now we are told that she has used altogether 120 tea spoons of sugar. So, if she prepared 13 cups of coffee, then she must have used 9 tea spoons of sugar (since 120 / 13 = 9).
Response:  If John bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, then he has bought a total of 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John has paid a total of $360. Therefore, the answer is $360.
Response:  On day one, the zollbeamte counted 2 containers with 5 cars each, so there were 10 cars in total (2 x 5 = 10). Now, let's assume that more containers arrived on the second day and the total number of cars at the port increased to 30. To find out how many containers arrived on the second day, we can divide the total number of cars by the number of cars per container: 30 / 5 = 6. So, 6 containers arrived on the second day, each containing 5 cars.
"Response: 
Adrians gehalt four years ago = $40,000 (given)
Lylahs gehalt four years ago = x (not given)
Adrians gehalt now = y (not given)
Lylahs gehalt now = z (not given)
We know that Adrian's salary has increased by 30% since then and Lylah's salary is higher than Adrian's. So we can write:
Adrian's new salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000) = $51,000
Lylah's new salary = $z > $51,000 (since her salary is higher than Adrian's)
Now we want to find out how much more Lylah earned in total compared to Adrian over those four years. We can do this by subtracting Adrian's old salary from his new salary and dividing it by two:
Total increase for Lylah = ($51,000 - $40,000) / 2 = $16,500
So Lylah earned $16,500 more than Adrian over those four years."
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week for his drawings and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he will use 8 sheets of paper per month (2 x 4 = 8). So, Miguel verbraucht 8 Sheets of Paper pro Monat.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, which means he contributed (5 + 8) = 13 fruit in total. Kael brought twice as many apples and half as many oranges as Morisette, which means he contributed (2 x 5) = 10 apples and (5 / 2) = 2.5 oranges. Therefore, the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael is 13 + 10 + 2.5 = 25.5 fruit.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. If she had some tasks to complete and therefore slept less on the next two days, then we can assume that she slept for x + 2 hours on Tuesday (where x is the number of hours she slept on Monday) and for x + 1 hour on Wednesday (where x is the same as before). So, if she slept more than 1 hour on the rest of the week, that means she slept a total of 8 + x hours during the week. Therefore, Sadie slept a total of 9 hours during the week.
Response:  Rosie can run for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, which means she covers a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 miles. Then, she runs for another 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour, covering a distance of 4 x 60 = 240 miles. Therefore, in total, Rosie covers a distance of 180 + 240 = 420 miles in 7 hours.
"Response:  When Jennie started helping her mother, there were 60 brieflabeled ""Br."" (for brief) and she pasted stamps on one-third of them, which is equal to 20 brieflabeled ""Br"" (since 1/3 x 60 = 20). So, after Jennie started helping, there were 40 unlabeled brieflabeled ""Br"" left in the stack (60 - 20 = 40). Now, when we add the already labeled brieflabeled ""Br"" that contained 30 brieflabeled ""Br"", we get the total number of brieflabeled ""Br"" as follows: Total = 40 + 30 = 70. Therefore, the correct answer is 70."
Response:  Julia bought one pack of new lighweight plastic spoons and her husband later gave her another pack with 5 more spoons. So together they have 6 spoons. Later when she was preparing dinner, she used 3 of those spoons to taste the soup. Therefore, there are 6 - 3 = 3 spoons left.
Response:  We know that Dylan has bought more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so let's start with the number of chicken sausages he has bought: 38. Now, we need to find out how many fish sausages he has bought. Since he has 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages he has bought is equal to 38 plus 6, which gives us a total of 44 sausages. Therefore, Dylan has altogether 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.
Response:  If Amy found 20 new friends after moving to a new school and Lily found 50 friends, then together they have 70 friends (Amy + Lily = 70).
Response:  We know that one watermelon costs three times as much as each paprika. So, if one paprika costs $15, then one watermelon costs $3 x $15 = $45. Now we also know that oranges cost $5 less than each watermelon. So, if one watermelon costs $45, then one orange costs $45 - $5 = $40. Therefore, the total amount of money that Dillon will pay for the items is $40 + $45 + $45 = $130.
"Response:  The number of patients per day is given as 500. Each patient takes an average of 24 minutes for the examination, so the total time spent on examinations per day is:

Time = Number of patients x Time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes

Now we need to calculate the cost of the consultations. According to the question, the doctors charge $150 per hour and the hospital charges the patient $200 per hour. To find out how much money the hospital makes from these consultations, we can multiply the number of hours by the price per hour:

Revenue = Number of hours x Price per hour = 12,000 x ($150 + $200) / 2 = $360,000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $360,000 per day from these consultations."
Response:  At first, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her Christmas village at the department store. Then, one-third of these elves (20) quit after children start bullying them. Next, another 10 elves quit after being pushed and kicked by the same group of children. So, there are now 30 elves left.
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500$, so his total expenses for that month were $500$. In June, he spent $60$ less than in May, which means his total expenses in June were $440 ($500 - $60). Therefore, his total expenses in May and June together are $940 ($500 + $440)$.
"Response: 
Pam went on the roller coaster twice, so she spent 12 karts (2 x 6).
Fred also went on the roller coaster four times, so he spent 24 karts (4 x 6).
After that, they both decided to go down the slide 2 times each. So, together they spent another 12 karts (2 x 6).
Therefore, in total, they spent 40 karts (12 + 24 + 12) at the fair that day."
Response:  On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. If he went 6 times as far on Thursday as he did on Monday, then he walked 6 x 4 = 24 miles on Thursday. So, in total, Walt walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles from Monday to Wednesday. Therefore, he walked 28 - 4 = 24 miles on Wednesday.
Response:  If Tom does 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then he pays $60 per month for car washes ($15 x 4). In one year, he will pay $720 for car washes ($60 x 12 months).
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 videogames and he lost 5 of them before the comparison was made with Bobby. So, Brian now has 15 videogames left. We also know that Bobby has fewer than 3 times as many videogames as Brian. Therefore, if we divide the number of videogames Brian has (15) by 3, we get an estimate of how many videogames Bobby has: 15 / 3 = 5. So, Bobby has 5 videogames.
Response:  There are 27 Einhörner in total worldwide and two thirds of them (i.e., 19 Einhörner) are located in Scotland. Since three fourths of these Scottish Einhorn (i.e., 13 Einhorn) are female, we can calculate the number of Scottish female Einhorn as follows: Number of Scottish female Einhor...
Response:  The total cost of the jumbo sandwiches is 2 x 7.50 = 15.00$. For the chips, it's 2 x 1.50 = 3.00$. And for the cookies, it's 2 x 1.00 = 2.00$. So far, we have a total of 18.00$. Now let's calculate the delivery fee. Since there are two orders, the delivery fee would be twice as much, which is 40%. Of that amount, 20% is added to the total cost, so the delivery fee comes out to be 0.80$ (40% of 20%). Therefore, the total cost of the order including the delivery fee is 18.00 + 0.80 = 18.80$. Finally, she wants to add 5.00$ tip, bringing the total cost to 18.80 + 5.00 = 23.80$.
Response:  If Mark completed the first test with 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour, it took him 15 hours to complete (75/5 = 15). Now, if he had 8 hours to complete the second test with 100 questions, he would have been able to complete 20 questions (100/8 = 20) since he was unable to finish all 100 questions within the given time frame. Therefore, Mark left 80 questions unanswered (100 - 20 = 80).
Response:  If there are 22 more red gumballs than blue ones, and there are 12 blue gumballs, then there must be 34 (22 + 12) red gumballs in total. So, the number of red gumballs is 34.
Response:  The total number of cars available is 20. Among them, 12 are automatic transmission (AT), which means that AT vehicles make up 60% of all cars (12/20). Now, among the remaining 8 non-AT vehicles, there are 4 with manual transmission (MT) and the rest are semi-automatic (SAT) vehicles. So, the percentage of SAT vehicles is 50% (4/8). Therefore, the percentage of Halbautomaten (SAT vehicles) is 50%.
"Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and we have to find out how many worker bees there are. From the information given, we can conclude that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, which means that there are 1400 (2 x 700) worker bees. Additionally, we know that there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, which means that there are 350 (2 x 175) queen bees. Therefore, the final answer is: Worker bees = 1400; Queen bees = 350."
"Response:  If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day and works part-time for 5 days a week (assuming he has one day off), then his total time spent working or playing games is:

Video game time = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week
Part-time job time = 10$/hour x 5 days/week = 50$/week
Total time worked = Video game time + Part-time job time = 14 hours/week + 50$/week = 64 hours/week
Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the total time worked by 7 to get the total amount of money earned in a week:

Total earnings = Total time worked x Hourly wage = 64 hours/week x 10$/hour = 640$/week
Therefore, if Jordan were to spend his video game time doing work instead, he would earn approximately 640$/week."
Response:  The cost of milk is $2, and there are x liters. Since it's non-food item, we have to pay 10% tax, so the total cost = $2 + (x \* 10%) = $2 + $0.2 = $2.2. Similarly, for eggs, it costs $3 per dozen, and since John bought 3 dozens, the cost = $3 \* 3 = $9. For glühbirnen, it costs $3 per package of 6, and John bought 2 packages, so the cost = $3 \* 2 = $6. For cups, it costs $3 per 100, and John bought 50 cups, so the cost = $3 \* 0.5 = $1.5. Finally, for beetle traps, it costs $4 per trap, and John bought 2 traps, so the cost = $4 \* 2 = $8. Therefore, the total cost = $2.2 + $9 + $6 + $1.5 + $8 = $32.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money each customer will spend with Kim's cleaning services per week. Since there are 5 potential customers and they all require 2 bottles of bleach and one package of cloths, the total amount spent by these customers would be:

$2 x 5 = $10 (for bleach) + $5 (for cloths) = $15 per week

Now, let's calculate the total income for the week. If Kim is able to secure 5 customers, his total income would be:

$15 x 5 = $75 per week

Finally, we can calculate the profit or loss by subtracting the total expenses from the total income:

Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
= $75 - ($10 + $5)
= $65 per week

Therefore, Lucas will make a profit of $65 per week from his cleaning services."
"Response: 
John can harvest his ananas every 3 months, so he will have 4 harvests per year (since there are 4 seasons in a year).
The number of ananas per hectare is given as 100/hectare. So, the total number of ananas that John has after one year is:
Number of ananas = Total area x Number of ananas/hectare x Number of harvests per year
= 10 ha x 100/ha x 4 harvests/year
= 4000 ananas
Therefore, John can harvest around 4000 ananas within one year."
Response:  The first Lego set has 500 pieces, and since it is 3 times as large as the second set (which has 1500 pieces), then the total number of pieces in all three sets together must be equal to 3 x 500 = 1500 + 500 = 2000 pieces. Therefore, Johnny picks up 2000 Legos.
"Response: 
Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive during the first 6 hours and half as many return during the next 6 hours (since she doubled her observation time). So, the number of bees that returned during the last 6 hours is equal to twice the original number minus the number that left during the first 6 hours.
In other words, the number of bees that returned during the last 6 hours = 2 x (30 - 15) = 40 bees."
Response:  The mother gave the cashier $8 as change, which means she paid a total of $18 ($10 for the child ticket + $8 change). So, the amount she gave to the cashier is $18.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then Charlie has 3x friends. And we also know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then James has 4x friends. Now, we are told that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. So, we can set up the equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, James has 4x = 48 friends on Facebook.
Response:  We know that Steve can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute and Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take for each of them to reach home, we need to divide their speed by their distance from school. For Steve, this is 3 miles / 440 feet/min = 7 minutes. For Tim, it's 2 miles / 264 feet/min = 8 minutes. So, if they start racing at the same time, Steve will arrive first after 7 minutes, and Tim will arrive after 8 minutes.
"Response: 
1. First day - 5 people came to pump their bike tires, each costing $0.25 per tire = $1.25 total revenue.
2. Second day - 3 people came to pump all three tires of their trikes = $0.75 total revenue.
Total revenue for both days = $1.99."
Response:  If Carl buys ten packs of cookies and each pack contains six cookies, then he has bought a total of 60 cookies (10 x 6 = 60). Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl has spent a total of $6.00 ($0.10 x 60 = $6.00) on cookies. Therefore, if he pays with a $10 note, he will receive $4.00 in change ($10 - $6.00 = $4.00).
"Response: 
Dave ate 14 Pommes frites before the möwe stole them. The möwe ate half as many as Dave, which is 7 Pommes frites (since it ate 7/2 = 3.5 Pommes frites). Then, three tawny owls came and ate 3 x 3 = 9 Pommes frites each, for a total of 27 Pommes frites eaten by the birds. Finally, the washbear ate 2/3 of what remained, which is 16 Pommes frites (since 2/3 x 14 = 16). So, in total, 16 + 7 + 27 + 16 = 66 Pommes frites were eaten from the pack. Therefore, when Dave bought the pack, there were 66 - 14 = 52 Pommes frites left."
"Response: 
Kimo has three 1-hour courses per day from Monday to Friday, so he has:
3 x 1 = 3 hours/day
And then he has two 2-hour courses per day on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so he has:
2 x 2 = 4 hours/day
In total, Kimo spends:
3 + 4 = 7 hours/day
Now let's calculate how many hours Kimo spends in a semester:
7 hours/day x 16 weeks (school weeks) = 112 hours/semester
Therefore, Kimo spends approximately 112 hours attending classes during an academic semester."
"Response:  We know that Bill has to bake 300 brötchen, 120 chocolate croissants and 60 baguettes per day. Each brötchen is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. So, let's calculate the total length of all these pastries:
Brötchen: 300 x 4 = 1200 inches (or 96 feet)
Croissants: 120 x 6 = 720 inches (or 57 feet)
Baguettes: 60 x 2 = 120 inches (or 9 feet)
Now, we add up all these lengths to get the total length of all the pastries: 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches (or 168 feet)."
"Response:  The total number of bananas needed for 2 months is:

* For all monkeys (including gorillas and pavians): 2 x 200 = 400 bananas
* For gorillas alone: 2 x 400 = 800 bananas
* For pavians alone: 2 x 100 = 200 bananas

Total number of bananas needed = 400 + 800 + 200 = 1,400 bananas."
"Response: 
Step 1: Blake runs for 15 minutes (or 15 x 60 = 900 yards).
Step 2: Kelly runs once from the start line to the 40-yard line and back (or 80 yards + 40 yards = 120 yards).
Now we need to calculate how far each person ran overall:
Blake: 900 yards (from Step 1)
Kelly: 120 yards (from Step 2)
So, Kelly ran further than Blake by 780 yards (120 - 900 = -780 yards). Therefore, Kelly is the winner!"
Response:  Raphael bought 4 stifts that cost each $1.50, so he paid $6 for them (4 x $1.50 = $6). Then, he bought 2 notebooks that cost each $4, so he paid $8 for them ($2 x $4 = $8). Finally, he bought one pack of writing paper that costs $20. Therefore, in total, Raphael paid $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 for all the school supplies.
Response:  At first, Finn sees 11 swimming tadpoles in the pond. Then he observes 6 of them coming out from under an aquatic plant and 2 disappearing under a stone. So, after these observations, how many tadpoles can Finn see in the pond? The answer is 11 - 6 + 2 = 7 tadpoles that Finn can still see in the pond.
Response:  On Monday (day 0), the tank had a depth of 17 feet. On Tuesday (day 1), the tank gained 7 feet of water, so its new depth is 24 feet (17 + 7). On Wednesday (day 2), the tank lost two-thirds of its original volume, which means it lost 13 feet of water (since two-thirds of 24 is 16). So, the final depth of the tank on Wednesday is 11 feet (24 - 13 = 11).
Response:  We know that Anakin found 10 starfish and 6 seahorses. If we subtract 6 from 10, we get 4. So, Anakin found 4 starfish. Now, let's find out how many fish Locsin caught. According to the question, Locsin caught fewer fish than Anakin. So, if Locsin caught 3 more clownfish than Anakin, that means Locsin caught 3 + 3 = 6 clownfish in total. Therefore, Locsin found 6 clownfish at the beach today.
"Response:  The price of a bean bag after 36 months will be calculated as follows:  
Price at time t = Original price x (1 + inflation rate)^t  
Where:  
* Price at time t is the price of the bean bag after t months  
* Original price is the initial price of the bean bag ($20)  
* Inflation rate is the percentage increase in the price every two months ($20 / 2 = $10 per month; $10 x 2 = $20 every 2 months)  
So, after 36 months, the price of the bean bag would be:  
$20 x (1 + $10/2)^36 = $840  
Therefore, after 36 months, a bean bag would cost $840."
"Response:  The total value of all toys is equal to the sum of their individual values. So, we can start by finding out how much each item costs and then adding them up.

1. A puppet costs as much as 3 action figures, which means it costs 3 x $5 = $15.
2. Each red car costs $4. Therefore, there are 5 cars in total, so they cost $4 x 5 = $20.
3. Now, let's add up the cost of both items: $15 + $20 = $35.

So, the whole set of toys is worth $35."
Response:  If she decides to do her tax return herself and saves 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour, that means she will save $105 ($35 x 3 hours). On the other hand, if she hires a bookkeeper for $90, she will have spent $90. Therefore, the difference between these two scenarios is $105 - $90 = $15. So, by hiring a bookkeeper, Jackie will have $15 more than if she did her taxes herself.
Response:  Firstly, Elvira wants to spend 1500 € on her new computer and accessories (scanner, CD-Brenner, printer). Since she has already spent 1090 € for the computer itself, that leaves her with 410 € left for other things. Then, she spends 102 € on a printer, which brings down the remaining amount to 308 €. Finally, she buys a dress worth 60 €, leaving her with 248 €. So, Elvira will have 248 € left after buying all these items.
"Response:  If Sandra gives her neighbor 9 eggs every time she watches his daughter, and each Spanish karamel pudding requires 3 eggs, then...
We need to find out how many times Sandra will have to babysit in total to collect enough eggs for 15 Spanish karamel puddings.
So, we can divide the number of eggs needed (15 x 3 = 45) by the number of eggs given per babysitting session (9):
45 / 9 = 5 babysitting sessions
Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit her neighbor's daughter 5 times to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish karamel puddings."
"Response:  If Seth is twice as old as Brooke and in 2 years their combined age will be 28, then we can write an equation based on this information.
Seth's age = 2 x Brooke's age
In 2 years, their combined age = Seth's age + Brooke's age + 2
Substituting the first equation into the second one gives us:
2x + 1 = Seth's age + Brooke's age + 2
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + 1 = 28
Solving for x (the unknown variable), we find that Seth is 14 years old. Therefore, the answer to the question is 14."
Response:  We know that Jimmy has more than twice as much money as Ethel. So if Ethel has $8, then Jimmy must have at least $16 (twice $8). Therefore, Jimmy currently has $16.
Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho goes 20 miles per day on foot. Therefore, he covers a total distance of 20 x 5 = 100 miles during the week. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he goes 10 miles per day on foot. So, he covers a total distance of 10 x 2 = 20 miles over the weekend. In summary, Pancho covers a total distance of 100 + 20 = 120 miles per week on foot.
"Response:  The cost of each item is given as follows:
Hat (Hut): $25
Jacket: $75 (3 times the cost of the hat)
Pants: $75 (the same price as the jacket)
So, the total cost of one uniform is:
$25 + $75 + $75 = $180
Therefore, each uniform costs $180 overall."
Response:  We know that there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so we have 8 x 80 = 640 legs. Then, we know that there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so we have 90 x 6 = 540 legs. Finally, we know that there are 3 rare mutated invertebrates with 10 legs each, so we have 3 x 10 = 30 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
"Response:  According to the information provided:
1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Granny Red is two years younger than Sally Two.
2. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. So, Sally Four is half as old as Granny Red.
3. Sally Four is equal in age to Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is eight years older than Sally Four.
Now let's calculate the total age of the four birds:
Granny Red - 2 = 60 (years)
Sally Two - 3 = 57 (years)
Sally Four - 0.5 = 49 (years)
Sally Thirtytwo + 8 = 68 (years)
So, the total age of the four birds is 60 + 57 + 49 + 68 = 244 years."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays each month for her student loan, credit card bill and mortgage. Then, we will find out how much she can pay extra if she wants to pay more than the minimum amount. Finally, we will calculate how much she will pay in total per year.
So, let's do the calculations:
Student Loan: $300 (minimum) x 12 = $3600 per year
Credit Card Bill: $200 (minimum) x 12 = $2400 per year
Mortgage: $500 (minimum) x 12 = $6000 per year
Total Monthly Payments: $3600 + $2400 + $6000 = $11000 per month
Now, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum amount, she will pay:
$11000 x 1.5 = $16500 per month
And so, in one year, she will pay:
$16500 x 12 = $202000 per year
Therefore, the answer is $202000 per year."
Response:  We know that Billy needs to prepare 60 kartoffs for his party and each one takes him around 1.5 minutes to shred and around 5 seconds to chop. So, we can calculate the total time needed as follows: Total Time = Number of Kartoffs x Time per Kartoffel Total Time = 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes Therefore, Billy will need approximately 90 minutes to complete the kartoffel preparation task.
"Response:  We know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell each glass of lemonade for $0.50. They sell 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $10 per gallon ($0.50 x 20). Since they want to make a profit of $25, their total revenue must be greater than $25. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

$10 + $3(number of gallons) = $25

Now, let's solve for the number of gallons:

$10 + $3x = $25

Subtracting $10 from both sides gives us:

$3x = $15

Dividing both sides by $3 gives us:

x = 5

So, Juan and his brother Carlos sold 5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. We know that each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so their total cost is:

$3(5) + $2(5) = $45

Therefore, Juan and his brother Carlos spent $45 on lemons if they made a profit of $25 selling lemonade."
Response:  We know that there are 240 people in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese is 240 - 80 = 160. Now we need to find out how many boys (Jungen) are in the Chinese team. According to the question, the number of boys in the Chinese team is equal to 60% of the total number of children in the Chinese team, which means that the number of girls (Mädchen) in the Chinese team is 60% of 160 = 96. Therefore, there are 96 girls in the Chinese team.
"Response: 
Zaid gives 1/4 of his income for rent and 1/3 for gasoline, so he has 1/4 x 6000 = 1500 left after these expenses. Then, he donates half of this amount to his preferred charity, which is 1500 / 2 = 750. So, he now has 1500 - 750 = 750 left. He also gives 200 to his daughter and 700 to his wife, respectively, leaving him with 750 - 200 - 700 = 350. Therefore, Zaid will have 350 dollars left after all of his expenditures and donations."
"Response:  We know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monica and that Monica has four fewer crabs than Bo. So we can write this as an equation:
Rani = Monica + (Bo - 4)
Now let's substitute the values given in the question:
Rani = Monica + (40 - 4)
= Monica + 36
So together, Rani, Monica, and Bo have 36 + 10 + 40 = 86 crabs."
Response:  In the first week, Lloyd gave 5 hours of tutoring, and he was paid $10 per hour, so he earned $50. In the second week, he gave 8 hours of tutoring, and he was also paid $10 per hour, so he earned $80. Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $130 in the first two weeks ($50 + $80).
Response:  The number of voters is given as 80 and the winner received 3/4 of their votes. So, the number of votes the loser got can be found out by subtracting the number of votes the winner got from 80. Therefore, the answer is 20 (80 - 56).
Response:  We know that Sandra had four times as many red roses as white narcissuses in her order. So if she ordered x white narcissuses, she ordered 4x red roses. Since there were only 5 white narcissuses delivered, it means that Fred did not deliver any of the remaining 3x red roses. Therefore, he must deliver 3x red roses before 17 o'clock to keep Sandra's business.
"Response:  We know that:
* Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is x years old, then Jean is x + 2 years old.
* Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, if Jan is y years old, then Mark was 5y/2 years old two years ago.
* Now we are told that when Jan was 30 years old, Mark was 5y/2 years old. So, if Jan is now 30 years old, then Mark must be (5y/2) + 2 = 5(15)/2 + 2 = 47 years old.
Therefore, Jean is 47 + 2 = 49 years old."
"Response:  The first team will run their race in exactly 220 seconds (55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220). Now, let's calculate how long it takes for each member of the second team to complete their leg of the race:

Laufender 1: 60 seconds
Laufender 2: 58 seconds (since he is 3 seconds faster than Laufener 1)
Laufender 3: 56 seconds (since he is 4 seconds faster than Laufener 2)
Laufender 4: 54 seconds (since he is 5 seconds faster than Laufener 3)

Now, we add up all these times to find out how long it takes for both teams to finish the race:

First team: 220 seconds
Second team: 60 + 58 + 56 + 54 = 278 seconds

So, the second team wins by 58 seconds."
"Response:  The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is $\frac{5}{6}$. Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two consecutive numbers that are both even or both odd. There are three possible outcomes for this:

1. Both even: This occurs when the first roll is an even number and the second roll is also even. The probability of this occurring is $\frac{2}{6} \times \frac{2}{6} = \frac{4}{36}$ or $0.111$.
2. Both odd: This occurs when the first roll is an odd number and the second roll is also odd. The probability of this occurring is $\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$ or $0.027$.
3. One even and one odd: This occurs when the first roll is even and the second roll is odd, or vice versa. The probability of this occurring is $\frac{2}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{36}$ or $0.056$.

So, in total, there are $\frac{4+0.111+0.027+0.056}{36} = 0.198$ possibilities for two consecutive numbers being either both even or both odd. Therefore, the probability of rolling two consecutive numbers that are both even is $\frac{4}{36}$, which is approximately $0.111$."
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked 20 apples, then Jenna must have picked half of them, which is 10 apples. So, Jenna picked 10 apples, and her mother picked 10 apples as well. Therefore, they both picked 20 apples in total.
Response:  We know that there are 3 groups of rats and each group has 6 rats. So, the total number of rats is 3 x 6 = 18 rats. Now, we also know that there are 10 hamsters alone in their cages, so they have 5 stroh halmes each. Therefore, the total number of stroh halmes distributed among all small animals is 18 rats + 10 hamsters x 5 stroh halmes/hamster = 90 stroh halmes. Since no straw is given anywhere else in the store, the remaining 70 stroh halmes must be divided equally among the 20 horses in the stable, resulting in 3.5 stroh halmes per horse (round down to nearest whole number). Therefore, there are 3.5 horses in each of the 3 stables.
"Response:  The amount that Mandy owes to Benedict is $100. They agreed to have monthly interest of 2%. So after 3 months, the total amount that Mandy needs to pay to Benedict will be:
$100 x (1 + 0.02/1) ^ 3 = $104.80
Therefore, Mandy must give Benedict $104.80 after 3 months."
Response:  The total cost of transporting all sacks from the farmer's field to the warehouse is 2 x 2 = 4$. So, the profit made by the trader after buying and selling each sack is: 30$ - 4$ = 26$. Since he sold all the sacks, the number of sacks he sold is equal to the total profit divided by the profit per sack: Number of sacks = 26$ / 2$ = 13 sacks.
Response:  The total cost of the three entries to the fair is 20 + 20 + 25 = 65 dollars. Since they gave 4.50 less for food than for tickets, each ticket cost 65 / 3 = 21.67 dollars. For the two roller coaster rides, each ride costs 33 x 2 = 66 dollars. If they agreed to split the costs equally among themselves, then each person would pay (65 + 66) / 3 = 58.33 dollars.
Response:  If John collects pears for 3 hours, he will have collected 3 x 60 = 180 minutes of pears. Since he can collect 2 pears per minute, he has collected 180 / 2 = 90 pears in total. Therefore, John has collected 90 pears in 3 hours.
Response:  If each week, enten must eat 3.5 pounds of insects to survive, and there are ten enten in total, then they need to eat how much per day? To find out, we can divide the total amount of insects needed for the week by the number of days in that week. So if we assume a standard week has 7 days (Monday through Sunday), then the daily requirement would be: 3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds per day.
"Response: 
Tom plants 10 trees per year and also cuts down 2 trees per year. So in total he has 8 trees (10 - 2 = 8).
After 10 years, 30% of the trees will have died, which means that 3 trees will have died (30% of 8 = 3).
So, after 10 years, Tom will have 5 trees left (8 - 3 = 5)."
Response:  On Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos placed outside Sue's garden. Then, on Saturday morning, 3/4 of them (or 12) were taken away and repainted white. Finally, another 18 pink flamingos were added to the collection on Sunday morning. So, at midday on Sunday, there would be more than twice as many pink flamingos as white ones - that is, 30 pink flamingos versus 12 white ones.
Response:  Violetta needs to buy new colored pencils and she has budgeted $20 for this purchase. Each color pencil costs $2, so she needs to buy 5 of them. Therefore, she will spend a total of $10 (5 x $2). So, she will receive $10 in change.
Response:  One stift costs as much as one pencil and eraser together. So, if one pencil costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30, then eight stifte will cost $9.60 ($1.20 x 8).
Response:  We have to divide 200 pounds of carrots among 40 restaurants. Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots. So, we need to calculate how many pounds of carrots each restaurant won't get. To do this, we can subtract the number of pounds each restaurant will receive from the total amount of carrots available (200 pounds). Therefore, the answer is: 200 - (40 x 2) = 160 pounds of carrots that won't be used.
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in Soda. Of these, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. This means that the total number of adults (men + women) is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. Since we were told that the rest of the population consists of children, we can deduce that the number of children is equal to 17509 - 8417 - 9092 = 9000. Therefore, there are 9000 children living in Soda.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 cards and collected three times that amount, so she had 60 cards in total (20 x 3 = 60). Then, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the previous month, which means she collected 40 cards (60 - 20 = 40). Finally, in the third month, she collected twice as many cards as she collected in the first two months combined, which is equal to 80 cards (40 + 40 = 80). Therefore, Elaine has a total of 180 Pokémon cards (60 + 40 + 80 = 180).
"Response:  We know that Mark corrects 1000 sentences per week for two different editors (Herausgeber A and Herausgeber B). Editor A pays him $0.05 per sentence, while Editor B pays him twice as much, or $0.10 per sentence. So, how much does Mark earn from each editor per week?

For Editor A, Mark earns $0.05 x 1000 = $50 per week.
For Editor B, Mark earns $0.10 x 1000 = $100 per week.
So, Mark's total weekly income is $50 + $100 = $150 per week."
"Response: 
1. In the morning he takes 5 ewers of water = 5 x 5 liters = 25 liters.
2. In the afternoon he takes 6 ewers of water = 6 x 5 liters = 30 liters.
So in total he takes 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water per day."
"Response:  If John wins the prize at the beginning of the year and he works every week of that year, then he will have earned:

* 50 weeks x $5000 (monetary bonus) = $250,000
* Plus, his salary will be increased by 5% for the entire year, so:
* $250,000 x 5% = $12,500
* Total earnings for the year: $262,500

Therefore, John would have earned $262,500 in that year."
"Response:  The farm has 10 acres (morgen) of land and produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, the total number of barrels produced is:

5 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels/year

So, the farm produces 10 barrels of wine per year."
"Response: 
Carl likes cheese and eats it every day for lunch. He uses 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
For breakfast, he makes omelets with eggs and cheese. He uses more cheese per omelet than he does per sandwich.
He also prepares a large portion of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners. For this, he uses 8 slices of cheese.
So, in total, Carl uses:
Lunch (2 slices/day x 5 days/week) = 10 slices/week
Breakfast (varies, but let's assume an average of 2 slices/omelet x 3 days/week) = 6 slices/week
Macaroni and cheese (8 slices/portion x 1 time/week) = 8 slices/week
Therefore, Carl uses a total of 24 slices of cheese per week."
"Response: 
Janet had initially 22 green pencils and 10 yellow pencils, so she had a total of 32 pencils (22 + 10).
Then, she bought 6 beakers blue pencils and 2 beakers red pencils. Each beaker contained 9 pencils, so she got 54 pencils from the blue beakers (6 x 9 = 54) and 12 pencils from the red beakers (2 x 9 = 18). In total, Janet acquired 76 pencils (54 + 18).
Therefore, Janet has 76 pencils now."
"Response:  If Brinley has scored 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in the first five tests, then her total score is:

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 459

Since she can remove the lowest point score from the average, let's find out which score is the lowest:

Lowest score = min(459) = 71

So, Brinley needs to score at least 93 in the sixth test to have an overall average of 93."
"Response: 
Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times per week for 4 weeks, which means he rode a total of:
5 x 4 = 20 trips
Each trip was 25 kilometers long, so the total distance Michael traveled in those 4 weeks is:
20 x 25 = 500 kilometers
Then, after 3 weeks of riding only twice a week and increasing the distance to 60 kilometers each time, Michael traveled a total of:
2 x 3 = 6 trips
Each trip was 60 kilometers long, so the total distance Michael traveled in those 3 weeks is:
6 x 60 = 360 kilometers
Therefore, the total distance Michael traveled over the course of the 7 weeks is:
500 + 360 = 860 kilometers."
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate drops and 80 candied apples in Joe's candy bag. Each chocolate drop weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, if one chocolate drop weighs 40 grams, then one candied apple must weigh half of that or 20 grams. Therefore, Joe's candy bag contains a total of 25 x 40 = 1000 grams of chocolate and 80 x 20 = 1600 grams of candied apples.
Response:  On Monday (Rose went to the store and bought 4 cookies). On Tuesday (she went to another store and bought 3 times as many cookies as she had bought on Monday), she bought 12 cookies (since 3 x 4 = 12). And on Wednesday (she went to yet another store and bought 5 times as many cookies as she had bought on Tuesday), she bought 60 cookies (since 5 x 12 = 60). So, after all three days, Rose had bought a total of 72 cookies.
"Response:  We know that 20 boxes of cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen (which is 6 x $8000 = $48,000). So we can write an equation based on this information:

$1200 - x = $48,000 - 6x
Where x is the cost of one cup.
Solving for x, we get:
x = $48,000 / 6 = $8,000
So the cost of each cup is $8,000."
"Response: 
Sara has already saved $10 before she started babysitting and mowing lawns. She earns $5 per time she watches the neighbor's children and $4 per time she mows the lawn. So far, she has earned a total of:
$5 x 4 times she watched the children = $20
$4 x 3 times she mowed the lawn = $12
Total amount earned so far: $20 + $12 = $32
Now, let's calculate how much more money Sara needs to save in order to buy the jacket and shoes:
Cost of jacket: $30
Cost of each pair of shoes: $20
Total cost of items Sara wants to buy: $30 + $20 + $20 = $70
Subtract the amount Sara has already earned from the total cost of the items she wants to buy:
$70 - $32 = $38
So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 9 more times (or watch the neighbor's children 9 more times) in order to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."
Response:  If Jerry has two more white hens than red hens, then he must have x number of white hens and y number of red hens. Since each white hen lays 5 eggs per day, Jerry collects 5x eggs from them. Similarly, since each red hen lays 3 eggs per day, Jerry collects 3y eggs from them. Therefore, the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 5x + 3y = 42 (given). Now, we can solve for y using the equation above. Solving for y gives us y = 10. So, Jerry has 10 red hens.
Response:  If Gary goes around the park at a speed of 3 miles per hour and the park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles wide and 6 miles long, then he will cover a distance of $ \text{distance} = \text{width} \times \text{length} = 1.5 \times 6 = 9 \text{ miles}$. So, if he walks for $ \text{time} = \text{distance} / \text{speed} = 9 \text{ miles} / 3 \text{ miles/hour} = 3 \text{ hours} $. Therefore, he spends $ \text{time} = 3 \text{ hours} $ walking around the park.
Response:  On day one, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. On day two, she counted 50 additional customers, for a total of 150 customers. Therefore, on day three (the third day), Sloane would have counted 200 customers (150 + 50). So, the answer is 200.
Response:  At first, both pools had equal amounts of water (since they have leaks and are losing water at the same rate). So, initially, big pool has twice as much water as small pool = $2x$ gallons. Then, in 4 minutes, big pool loses $\frac{4}{60} \times 2x$ gallons = $ \frac{8x}{60}$ gallons. Since big pool now has four times as much water as small pool, we can set up the equation: $\frac{8x}{60} = x$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 16$. Therefore, the small pool currently holds $16 - 2x = 14$ gallons of water.
Response:  The total cost of the shoes and belt is 320 + 32 = 352 dollars. Since Lori earns 8$ per hour, she needs to work for hours to afford her purchase. So we can set up an equation as follows: 352 / 8 = x, where x represents the number of hours Lori must work before she can buy the shoes and belt. Solving for x, we get x = 43. Therefore, Lori must work for 43 hours before she can afford her purchase.
Response:  The initial amount that Janet borrowed was $2000. She promised to pay it back with an additional 10% interest, which means she will have to pay $2200 in total ($2000 + (10% of $2000)). Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, her total payment will be $2040 ($165 x 12). So, after 12 months, Janet's remaining balance will be $96 ($2200 - $2040].
Response:  There are 4 roses and 7 daisies more than roses in the vase. So, there are (4 + 7) = 11 blossoms in total in the vase.
"Response: 
Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, which means Adrian is 3H years old. Since Harriet is half as old as Zack, we can say that Zack is 2H years old.
Now, if Harriet is 21 years old now, then she was 18 years old three years ago (since she has aged 3 years). So, the average age of Adrian and Zack at this time would be:
Average Age = (3H + 2H) / 2
= (5H) / 2
= H
Therefore, the average age of Adrian and Zack three years from now will be 7 years old (i.e., 5 x 1.4 = 7)."
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored more than half of Naomis score which means he scored at least 34 points (since Naomi scored 68). Additionally we know that Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So together they scored 101 points (68 + 34 = 101). Now we are left with 150 points (251 - 101) which Jojo must have scored. Therefore Jojos score was 150 points.
"Response: 
Carmen needs 10 minutes to solve one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve one Sudoku puzzle. Since she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles during the weekend, we can calculate her total time spent as follows:
Time spent solving crossword puzzles = Number of puzzles x Time per puzzle = 3 x 10 = 30 minutes
Time spent solving Sudoku puzzles = Number of puzzles x Time per puzzle = 8 x 5 = 40 minutes
Total time spent playing games = Time spent solving crossword puzzles + Time spent solving Sudoku puzzles = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes
Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So initially, there were 120 - 90 = 30 liters of water left in the tank. Now, she could collect two times as much rainwater as was remaining in the tank. Therefore, she collected 30 x 2 = 60 liters of rainwater. So now, there are 30 + 60 = 90 liters of water in the tank.
Response:  If Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 petunias less than geraniums, then he plants 50 petunias (since 90 - 40 = 50). So, in total, Andy plants 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.
Response:  In year one, the company spends $15,000 for advertising. In year two, it spends $\frac{15,000}{3} = 5,000$ for advertising. So, the total amount spent by the company on advertising over these two years is $15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000$.
"Response: 
Carlos pays 30$ per hour for using the canoe, so he will pay 30 x 3 = 90$ for using it for 3 hours.
Benji pays 18$ per hour for using the banana water slide, so he will pay 18 x 5 = 90$ for using it for 5 hours.
Therefore, in total they will have to pay 90 + 90 = 180$."
Response:  If it takes half as many days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester with the car than with the bus, then it will take 3 days to go from New Jersey to Rochester with the car and return in 2 days (since there are already 3 days spent going up). So, if he plans to go back with the car after spending 6 days with the bus, it means that he will spend a total of 9 days (6 + 3) traveling from New Jersey to Rochester and back.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that James has initially 40 Water-type cards out of his total collection of 70 cards. So, the probability of drawing a Water-type card when he draws one randomly from his deck is 40/70 = 0.57.
Now, let's consider what happens when James moves 8 Water-type cards to another location and buys 14 Plant-type cards. The number of Water-type cards in his original deck remains unchanged at 40, but now there are fewer Water-type cards relative to the total number of cards in his deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing a Water-type card when he draws one randomly from his deck becomes (40/70) \* (60/70) = 0.43.
So, the final probability of drawing a Water-type card when James draws one randomly from his deck after moving 8 Water-type cards and buying 14 Plant-type cards is approximately 0.43 or 43%."
"Response: 
Chad ordered his own burrito for lunch and added the following toppings:
* Extra meat ($2)
* Extra cheese ($1)
* Avocado ($1)
* Two sauces ($0.25 x 2 = $0.50)
He also upgraded his meal for $3, which includes chips and a drink.
So, the total cost of Chad's meal is:
$6.50 (base price of the burrito) + $2.00 (extra meat) + $1.00 (extra cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + $0.50 (two sauces) + $3.00 (upgrade) = $14.00
Since he used a gift card worth $5.00, he owes:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00"
Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, then her mother can place 2 pieces per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take Kalinda 15 minutes to add all 360 pieces (since she can add 4 pieces per minute x 15 minutes = 60 pieces). Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mother together 9 hours to complete the puzzle (since they can place 2 pieces per minute x 9 hours = 180 pieces). So, the answer is 9 hours.
"Response: 
Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30% of the watermelons were ripe for harvesting. So she took those home with her. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons had ripened, so she harvested them. This means that out of the original 120 watermelons, 90 remained (since 30% of 120 is 36). Of these, 75 were ripe enough to be harvested (since 3/4 of 90 is 75). Therefore, there were 15 watermelons left unripe and not harvested (since 75 - 90 = 15)."
"Response: 
Mark buys 12 cars for his company and each car costs $20,000. So, he pays a total of $240,000 ($20,000 x 12) for the cars themselves.
Then, he pays 10% tax on the cost of the cars, which is $24,000 ($240,000 x 10%).
Finally, he pays an additional $1,000 for registration fees per car, so that's another $12,000 ($1,000 x 12).
So, in total, Mark pays $306,000 ($240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000) for all 12 cars."
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Kylie collected 5 more muschels than Robert, so she had 5 + x = 20 muschels, where x is the number of muschels Robert collected. On Tuesday (Dienstag), Kylie collected 2 times as many muschels as she collected on Monday, so she had 5 + 2(x) = 35 muschels. Therefore, Kylie collected 35 muschels on Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 ants (Ameisen) in the garden and Dax found half as many insects as ants, then the total number of insects would be half of 50 = 25.
"Response: 
1/3 of the penguins jump into the ocean = 12 penguins (since there are 36 penguins initially)
1/3 of the remaining penguins go to eat in the cave = 10 penguins (since there were originally 36 penguins and now only 24 remain)
So, there are 12 + 10 = 22 penguins still sunbathing on the ice."
Response:  If Steve eats double the amount of tomatoes than his friend, then he eats 12 tomatoes per day (double 6). Now, if one stock can produce 3 tomatoes per week, how many stocks does Steve need to have in order to produce 12 tomatoes per day that he eats? So, Steve needs 4 stocks (12 / 3 = 4) to produce enough tomatoes for him to eat.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend wants to have 4 slices of pizza. Since pizzas come only in 8 portions, we need to divide the total number of friends by the number of portions available. So, John needs to order:  
20 friends / 8 portions = 5 orders of pizza."
Response:  If he uses five empty sticks to make one full stick of tint, then he can make 5/1 = 5 full sticks with the 25 sticks he has initially. So, he will have 5 + 20 = 25 full sticks altogether.
Response:  If Johnny took his $20 wallet money and added $10 more, he now has $30. Then, if this amount tripled after one year, he would have $90. So, Johnny had $90 after one year.  45 
"Response:  We know that:
Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, Joan is older than Mary by 2 years.
Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, Jessa is younger than Joan by 5 years.
Jessa is 20 years old.
Now we can calculate the sum of their ages as follows:
Joan's age = 2 + 5 = 7 years older than Jessa
Mary's age = Jessa's age - 2 years
So, Mary's age = 20 - 2 = 18 years old.
Therefore, the sum of the three girls' ages is:
7 + 18 + 20 = 45 years."
"Response: 
Let's say there are x number of students who went out through exit C.
Since 30% of the remaining students (i.e., 70%) went out through exit A, we have:
x = 0.3 \* 1000 = 300
Now, since 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., 60%) went out through exit B, we have:
x = 0.6 \* 1000 = 600
So, the total number of students who went out through exit C is:
x + x = 300 + 600 = 900
Therefore, 900 students went out through exit C."
Response:  We know that James has 6 more bonbons than Robert, which means that if Robert has x bonbons, then James has x + 6 = 6x/2 bonbons. Since John has double the number of bonbons as Robert, John has 2x bonbons. If John has 54 bonbons, then he has 2(54) = 108 bonbons in total. Now we can compare how many bonbons James has with John: James has 6 more bonbons than Robert, and Robert has 108 bonbons, so James has 108 - (6 + 6) = 108 - 12 = 96 bonbons. Therefore, John has more bonbons than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they will have three books to read. So, in total, they will read 3 books.
"Response: 
Mike receives 2 letters per week from each of the remaining 3 friends, for a total of 6 letters per week.
Since he answers with the same number of letters, he spends 6 minutes writing each letter.
To find out how many hours he spends writing per week, we need to divide the total time spent writing (in minutes) by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
So, Mike spends approximately 1 hour and 42 minutes (or 98 minutes) per week writing replies to his friends' letters."
"Response: 
Jason has 1000 minutes per month and he spends 15 minutes each day talking to his boss. That means he spends 15 x 30 = 450 minutes per month on these calls.
Now, he has 600 minutes left (1000 - 450).
Since there are 30 days in this month, we can divide the remaining minutes by 30 to find out how many minutes Jason has left for other calls: 600 / 30 = 20 minutes per day."
"Response: 
Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her Pommes frites, which means she gave him x Pommes frites. Since Billy took double the number that Kyle took, he took 2x Pommes frites from Griffin. So, after this, Griffin had 2x + x = 3x Pommes frites left. Then, Colby took 3 Pommes frites less than the number that Kyle took, which is equal to -3Pommes frites. Therefore, at the end, Griffin had 3x - 3 = 27 Pommes frites. Now, we can find out how many Pommes frites Ginger gave Griffin by dividing the total number of Pommes frites Griffin had at the end (27) by the number of Pommes frites Ginger gave him (x). So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 / x = 9 Pommes frites."
"Response:  In aquarium A, there are 4 snails and 32 fish. If we assume that both aquariums have the same number of fish, then the difference between the two numbers is equal to twice the number of fish in each aquarium. Therefore, if x is the number of fish in aquarium A, then the number of fish in aquarium B is 2x. Since there are 4 snails in aquarium A, there are also 4 snails in aquarium B (since they are the same). So, the total number of creatures in aquarium B is 2x + 4 = 36. 
Therefore, there are 36 fish in each aquarium."
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate how much time Jean spends applying makeup for the film per day and per week:
Time per day = 6 hours/day x 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Time per year = 24 hours/week x 52 weeks/year = 1,248 hours/year
Now, let's calculate Jean's total earnings from applying makeup for the film:
Total earnings per year = $250/hour x 1,248 hours/year = $319,700/year
Next, we need to subtract the discount given by the maskenbildner (makeup artist):
Discount = $319,700/year x 10% = $31,970/year
So, Jean's final earnings from applying makeup for the film are:
$319,700 - $31,970 = $287,730/year

Response:  We know that Isabella spent a total of $108 for party supplies. She shared the cost with her parents, who paid in equal shares. So, if we divide $108 by 3, we get $36 per person. Therefore, each person (Isabella's parent) paid $36 towards the party expenses.
Response:  The total weight of all sacks is given as 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Since each pound of zucchini costs $1.50, the total cost of all zucchinis is 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300. So, the cook paid $300 for the zucchinis.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, which means she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday (Dienstag), Sue doubled the number of cookies she ate compared to her sister, which means she ate 2 x 20 = 40 cookies. So, in total, Sue ate 20 + 40 = 60 cookies more than her sister. Since each cookie contains 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 60 x 200 = 12,000 calories more than her sister. Therefore, the correct answer is 12,000 calories.
