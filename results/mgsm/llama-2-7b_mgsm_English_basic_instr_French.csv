Explanation: Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can set up the following equation:
Toulouse = 2 × Charleston = 2 × (4 × Seattle)
Solving for Toulouse, we get:
Toulouse = 8 × Seattle
Since Seattle has 20 sheep, we can plug this value into the previous equation to find out how many sheep Toulouse has:
Toulouse = 8 × 20 = 160
Now, let's find out how many sheep Charleston and Seattle have together. We know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so we can multiply Seattle's number of sheep by 4 to find out how many Seattle has:
Charleston = 4 × Seattle = 4 × 20 = 80
Finally, we add up the total number of sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have to find the answer:
Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 160 + 80 + 20 = 360
Therefore, the three cities have a total of 360 sheep together."

Answer: Eliza's total earnings for the week would be $460. Here's how we can calculate it:

Regular hours worked (first 40 hours): $10/hour x 40 hours = $400
Overtime hours worked (additional 5 hours): $10/hour x 5 hours = $50
Total earnings = Regular hours + Overtime hours x overtime pay = $400 + $50 = $460

Answer: The merchant should choose the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 as it has a higher expected return on investment (ROI) than the jewelry option. To calculate the ROI for each option, we can use the following formula:

ROI = (Expected Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment

For the jewelry option, the expected value is $5,000 + 2.5% of $5,000 = $5,375, and the initial investment is $5,000. Therefore, the ROI for the jewelry option is ($5,375 - $5,000) / $5,000 = 7.14%.

For the electronic gadget option, the expected value is $8,000 + 1.2% of $8,000 = $8,260, and the initial investment is also $8,000. Therefore, the ROI for the electronic gadget option is ($8,260 - $8,000) / $8,000 = 3.25%.

Based on these calculations, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 as it offers a higher ROI compared to the jewelry option."

Response:  Marie a ordonné 6 boxes of pizza. Explication: To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to subtract the cost of all other items from the total amount she paid. The cost of chicken meal is $12, and Marie ordered one meal. The cost of milk is $3 per pack, and Marie ordered 5 packs, so the total cost of milk is $3 x 5 = $15. The cost of apples is $1.50 per apple, and Marie ordered 4 apples, so the total cost of apples is $1.50 x 4 = $6. Therefore, the total amount Marie paid is $50 - $15 - $6 = $39. Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie must have ordered at least 39 / $8.50 = 4 boxes of pizza. But since Marie paid $50 in total, she must have ordered exactly 4 boxes of pizza.

Answer: Cynthia will spend $240 on ice cream over the course of 60 days.

Explanation:
Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, which means she consumes 1/15 of an entire carton of ice cream each day. Since there are 60 days in total, she will consume 60/15 = 4 complete cartons of ice cream.
The cost of one carton is $4.00, so the total cost of the ice cream Cynthia will buy over the course of 60 days is:
$4.00 x 4 = $160.00
Since Cynthia eats ice cream every night for 60 days, she will have spent a total of $160.00 on ice cream by the end of that period."

Explanation: Let's break down each friend's answer and calculate their average guess:

Friend 1 (80): This friend thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. We can add this number to our total.
Total so far = 80 +...

Friend 2 (20 more than half of Friend 1): Half of 80 is 40, plus 20 gives us 60. So this friend thinks there are 60 jelly beans in the jar. Add it to our total: Total so far = 80 + 60 = 140.

Friend 3 (25% more than Friend 1): If Friend 1 has 80 jelly beans, then 25% more would be 80 x 1.25 = 100. So this friend thinks there are 100 jelly beans in the jar. Add it to our total: Total so far = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

Now we have three estimates for the number of jelly beans in the jar: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we simply add these numbers together and divide by 3:
Average estimate = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 137
Therefore, the average guess of Gunter's friends is 137 jelly beans in the jar."

Response: 5 mph (miles par heure)
"Response: 18 miles  
Explanation: Let's analyze the given information step by step:

Speed when running = 4 times faster than walking speed = 4 x 3 = 12 miles/hour

Speed when skipping = Half as fast as running speed = 12 / 2 = 6 miles/hour

Total time = 6 hours

Time spent running = 1/3 of total time = 6 / 3 = 2 hours

Time spent walking = Remaining time = 6 - 2 = 4 hours

Distance traveled while running = Distance traveled during 2 hours = Distance traveled per hour x Number of hours = 12 x 2 = 24 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Distance traveled during 4 hours = Distance traveled per hour x Number of hours = 3 x 4 = 12 miles

Total distance traveled = Addition of distances traveled while running and walking = 24 + 12 = 36 miles

Therefore, Dana can travel 36 miles in six hours."

Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:
1. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so if he bought x blue ties, he bought 2x red ties.
2. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of one red tie is 50% more than the cost of one blue tie. If a blue tie costs $40, then a red tie costs $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.
3. John spent $200 on ties, and since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he spent half of his money on red ties ($200 / 2 = $100). Since each red tie costs $60, John spent a total of $100 x 2 = $200 on ties."

Answer: The mechanic earned $384 more in revenue on Friday than on Thursday.
Explanation:
On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 per tire = $360. And he repaired 4 car tires at $40 per tire = $160. Total revenue on Thursday = $520.
On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 per tire = $480. Since he didn't repair any truck tires, there is no additional revenue from truck tires. Therefore, total revenue on Friday = $480.
So, the difference between the revenue on Thursday and Friday = $480 - $520 = $384."

Explanation:
Marcy has worked for the same company for 40 years, so she has been entitled to a pension for 20 years (from age 20 to age 40). From then on, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year, which means that after 30 years of work, she is entitled to 15% of the value of the pension per year (5% x 30 = 15%).
The value of the pension at retirement age can be calculated as follows:
Pension value = Annual pension x Number of years until retirement
= $50,000 x (40 - 20)
= $675,000
Therefore, Marcy's annual pension at retirement age will be:
Annual pension = Pension value / Number of years of entitlement
= $675,000 / 15
= $675,000 / 30
= $67500
So, Marcy's annual pension at retirement age will be $67500."

We know that the boat is taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows back towards shore, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, if Julia rows 64 feet (which is equal to 8 times 8), then she will have rowed 64 x 2 = 128 feet back towards shore. Since each foot of rowing results in the boat taking on 2 liters of water, the total amount of water taken on by the time Julia reaches shore is 128 x 2 = 256 liters. However, since the shore is only 64 seconds away, this means that Julia has been rowing for 64 / 16 = 4 minutes, which means that the boat has taken on 256 liters of water over a period of 4 minutes."

Answer: The total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is $85625.
Explanation:
Let A be Adrien's salary four years ago and L be Lylah's salary four years ago.
According to the problem, Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, so A = 1.3L.
Four years later, Adrien's salary is 40% more than it was four years ago, so A' = 1.4A = 1.4(1.3L) = 1.92L.
Similarly, Lylah's salary four years later is L'.
So, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
$A + L = $1.92L + L' = $85625$."
Response: 150 sheets (ou pages) par mois. Explication: Pour calculer le nombre de feuilles de papier que Miguel utilise chaque mois, nous devons diviser le nombre de feuilles qu'il utilise par semaine par le nombre de semaines dans un mois. Il y a environ 4 semaines dans un mois. Donc, Miguel utilise 2 x 4 = 8 feuilles de papier par semaine. Maintenant, pour trouver le nombre de feuilles de papier qu'il utilise chaque mois, nous devons multiplier le nombre de feuilles qu'il utilise par les semaines dans un mois :  8 feuilles/semaine x 4 semaines/mois = 32 feuilles/mois. Donc, Miguel utilise approximativement 32 feuilles de papier par mois pour ses dessins.

Answer: The hospital makes a profit of $90 per visit ($200 - $150). Since there are 500 visitors per day, the daily profit would be $90,000 (500 x $90).

Explanation:
The total revenue generated by the hospital from these visits is $200 per hour x 500 visitors = $100,000 per day. Subtracting the cost of $150 per hour x 500 visitors = $75,000 per day, we get the gross profit of $25,000 per day ($100,000 - $75,000). Dividing this amount by the number of visitors gives us the profit per visitor, which is $90 in this case."

Explanation: Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We know that Brian has 20 video games initially and then he lost 5 of them. So, after losing those 5 games, Brian had 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. Now, we are told that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. This means that if Brian has x video games, Bobby has x / 3 video games. Since Brian had 15 video games left after losing 5, Bobby must have 15 / 3 = 14 video games. Therefore, the answer is 14."

Explanation: To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the number of questions he answered in the two tests from the total number of questions in each test.
For the first test, Mark answered 75/5 = 15 questions per hour. So, he completed 8 hours \* 15 questions/hour = 120 questions in 8 hours. Therefore, he left 75 - 120 = 45 questions incomplete.
For the second test, Mark answered 100/5 = 20 questions per hour. So, he completed 6 hours \* 20 questions/hour = 120 questions in 6 hours. Therefore, he left 100 - 120 = 25 questions incomplete."

Explanation: Let's assume that the total number of gumballs in the machine is x. Since there are 4 times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, the number of pink gumballs is 4x. We know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so the total number of pink gumballs must be greater than or equal to 12. Therefore, we can write an inequality: 4x >= 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 56. So, there are 56 pink gumballs in the machine."

Therefore, Jordan will earn $100 per week if he spends his video game time working instead of playing games."
"Response: 5.67

Explanation:
John bought the following items:

* Milk: $2
* Eggs: $3
* Light bulbs: $3
* Cups: $3
* Roach traps: $4

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 = $12

Total cost of non-food items = $4

Tax on non-food items = $4 x 10% = $0.40

New cost of non-food items = $4 + $0.40 = $4.40

Total cost of everything = $12 + $4.40 = $16.40

Therefore, everything costed John $16.40."
"Response: 

Answer: To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the total expenses (bleach and cloths) from the total income. The total income for the week is $92, and the total expenses are $10 (2 x $2 = $4 for bleach + $6 for cloths). Therefore, the profit per week is:

Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
= $92 - $10
= $82

So, Lucas will make a profit of $82 per week."
Response:  John can harvest  300 pineapples within a year. Justification: To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the total area of the field (in hectares) and then divide that result by the time interval between harvests (in months). In this case, there are 100 pineapples per hectare, John has 10 hectares of land, and he can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is: 100 pineapples/hectare x 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples 1000 pineapples / 3 months = 333 pineapples per month 333 pineapples per month x 12 months = 3994 pineapples per year So, John can harvest approximately 3994 pineapples within a year.

En somme, Johnny picked up 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2678 pièces de Lego."
"Response: 45
Explanation: Let x be the number of bees that left the hive during the first 6 hours. Since half as many bees left the hive during the second 6 hours, we can assume that x/2 bees left during this time period. The total number of bees that left the hive during the entire day is therefore 3x + (x/2) = 3x + x = 4x. Since twice as many bees returned during the final 6 hours as left earlier, the number of bees that returned during this time period is 2(4x) = 8x. Therefore, the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 8x = 45."

"Response: 15 minutes et 28 secondes.  
Explication: Pour résoudre ce problème, nous devons d'abord déterminer le temps qu'il faudra à Steve pour parcourir les 3 miles qui séparent lui de son maison. Nous savons que Steve peut parcourir 440 feet (soit environ 132 meters) par minute, donc il faudra à Steve 3 miles x 440 feet/minute = 12960 feet à parcourir. Donc, le temps nécessaire à Steve pour finir la course sera de 12960 feet / 440 feet/minute = 29 minutes et 12 secondes. Maintenant, nous pouvons calculer le temps qu'il faudra à Tim pour finir la course en utilisant sa vitesse de 264 feet/minute. Tim doit parcourir 2 miles x 264 feet/minute = 5280 feet. Donc, le temps nécessaires à Tim pour terminer la course sera de 5280 feet / 264 feet/minute = 19 minutes et 40 secondes. Enfin, nous pouvons ajouter le temps qu'il a fallu à Steve pour finir la course à celui qu'il faudra à Tim pour obtenir le temps total attendu par le perdant à sa maison. Donc, le perdant attendra 29 minutes + 19 minutes = 48 minutes et 28 secondes avant que le gagnant ne arrive à sa maison."

Explanation:
Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull took them all. The seagull ate half of what Dave had eaten (since Dave ate 14, the seagull ate 7). So there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left after the seagull's snack.
Then, three pigeons came along and ate 3 more fries each (for a total of 9 fries eaten by the pigeons). So there were 7 - 9 = 2 fries left.
Next, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries (which is equal to 6 fries since 2/3 is the same as 6/3). So there were 2 - 6 = -4 fries left.
Finally, an ant carried off the last fry (-4 + 1 = 0 fries left).
Therefore, when Dave bought the pack of french fries, there were 25 fries inside!"

On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet. So, let 'x' be the depth of the water on Monday.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the new depth would be x + 7 = 24 feet (since the total depth of the water increased by 7 feet).
On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the new depth would be (x + 7) / 3 = 12 feet.
Therefore, the water depth on Wednesday is 12 feet."

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is X years old, Jean is X + 2 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Let's call Jan's current age as A. Then, two years ago, Mark's age would be A + 5.
3. Now, we are told that Jan is 30 years old. So, we can find out Mark's age by using the second statement:
Mark's age = A + 5 (given)
Solving for A, we get:
A = 30 - 5 = 25
So, Mark is 25 years old.
Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27 years old.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 27."

Explanation: To determine the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time it takes for each team to complete the relay race. For Team A, since all four members have the same time of 55 seconds, their total time would be 55 x 4 = 220 seconds. For Team B, as you mentioned, the first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner runs 57 seconds (since they are 3 seconds faster), the third runner runs 54 seconds (since they are 3 seconds faster again), and the fourth runner runs 51 seconds (since they are 3 seconds faster once more). Therefore, Team B's total time would be 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 282 seconds. Since Team A finished in 220 seconds, Team B wins by 62 seconds (or 1 minute and 2 seconds)."

Explanation: Let X be the number of pink plastic flamingos initially placed on Sue's front yard (i.e., 18). On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one-third of the flamingos, which is equal to X/3. Therefore, the number of pink plastic flamingos left on Sue's front yard after the neighbors painted them white is X/3. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos, bringing the total number of pink flamingos to 2X/3. Finally, at noon on Sunday, there are 3 times as many pink flamingos as white flamingos, so the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is 3(2X/3) = 6X/3. Therefore, there are 6X/3 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday."

"Response: 14 slices of cheese. Explication: Voici comment vous pouvez résoudre cette question :
Carl a mangé des sandwiches pour le déjeuner chaque jour cette semaine et utilisé 2 tranches de fromage par sandwich. Il a également mangé des omelettes au fromage et à l'œuf pour le petit-déjeuner pendant 3 jours de la semaine, utilisant une tranche supplémentaire de fromage par omelette qu'il n'utilisait pas par sandwich. Enfin, il a préparé un grand plat de macaroni et de fromage pour les repas suivants de la semaine et a utilisé 8 tranches de fromage dans ce plat.
Pour calculer le nombre total de tranches de fromage que Carl a utilisé, nous devons ajouter le nombre de tranches de fromage utilisé par sandwich, par omelette et par plat de macaroni et de fromage. Nous pouvons donc écrire :
Nombre de tranches de fromage utilisées = Nombre de tranches de fromage utilisées pour les sandwiches + Nombre de tranches de fromage utilisées pour les omelettes + Nombre de tranches de fromage utilisées pour le plat de macaroni et de fromage
= 2 x 5 (tranches de fromage par sandwich) + 1 x 3 (tranches de fromage par omelette) + 8 (tranchés de fromage dans le plat de macaroni et de fromage)
= 10 + 3 + 8
= 14 tranches de fromage

Explanation: First, let's count the number of pens that Janet already had: 22 green pens + 10 yellow pens = 32 pens. Now, let's add the number of pens that Janet bought: 6 bags of blue pens x 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens + 2 bags of red pens x 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens = 66 pens total. Therefore, Janet has a total of 32 + 66 = 98 pens."
"Response: 54  
Explanation: To calculate the average of the six tests, we add all the scores together and divide by 6:

Score 1 = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 558
Average = 558 / 6 = 93
Since Brinley already has a score of 92 on one of the tests, if she gets a score of 54 on the sixth test, her new average will be:

New Average = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 54) / 6 = 93
Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 54 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"Response: 187.5 km
Explanation: To find out how many kilometers Michael did in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered during each period of his biking routine and add them up.
During the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week and made 25 kilometers each time, so he covered a total distance of:
5 x 25 = 125 kilometers per week
Since he did this for 4 weeks, the total distance he covered during this period is:
125 km/week x 4 weeks = 500 kilometers
Now, let's move on to the next phase where Michael reduced the number of times he rode his bike but increased the distance he covered each time. During these three weeks, Michael rode his bike 2 times a week and made 60 kilometers each time. So, he covered a total distance of:
2 x 60 = 120 kilometers per week
Again, since he did this for 3 weeks, the total distance he covered during this period is:
120 km/week x 3 weeks = 360 kilometers
Adding up all the distances he covered during both periods gives us the total distance Michael rode his bike:
500 km + 360 km = 860 kilometers
Therefore, the answer is 860 kilometers."

Explanation: Let's break down each day's purchases:
Monday: Rose bought 4 cakes.

In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 120 cakes."
"Response:  $50
Explanation: According to the problem statement, we know that twenty-four cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. This means that the total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000 + $1200 = $7200. Therefore, the cost of one plate is $7200 / 6 = $1200 per plate. Since there are 24 cups in a dozen, the cost of each cup is $1200 / 24 = $50 per cup."

Explanation: To calculate the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to subtract the amount of money she already has ($10) from the total cost of the jacket and shoes ($50). This gives us $40. Since Sara earns $4 per time she mows the lawn, she will need to do it 10 times (or $40 / $4 = 10) to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."
"Response: 10

Explanation: Let's assume that the number of red chickens is x. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens in one day is 3x. Similarly, since the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens in one day is 5(x+2), where x is the number of red chickens.

Now, we know that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so the total number of eggs collected must be equal to the sum of the eggs produced by both types of chickens: 3x + 5(x+2) = 42.

Solving for x, we get:

3x = 42 - 5x - 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x = 36

x = 12

So, Jerry has 12 red chickens."
Response: 4 h. Explication: Pour résoudre cette question, nous devons diviser le nombre de miles qu'il fait en fonction du temps qu'il prend pour parcourir ce distance. Nous savons que il parcourt une distance de 1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles en un hour. Donc, si il marche à 3 miles/heures, il faudra à lui 9 miles / 3 miles/heure = 3 heures pour parcourir cette distance.

Explanation: On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, there were 50 more customers, so she counted 150 customers (100 + 50). On the third day, there were still 50 more customers than the previous day, so she counted 200 customers (150 + 50). Therefore, the total number of customers by the third day was 500 (100 + 150 + 50 = 350)."

Explanation: To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then divide it by her hourly wage. The total cost of the shoes and belt is $352 ($320 + $32). Dividing this amount by her hourly wage of $8 gives us the number of hours she needs to work: $352 / $8 = 44 hours. Since you cannot divide by a whole number (in this case, 44), round up to the nearest whole number, which is 40 hours. Therefore, Lori needs to work for 40 hours to afford the shoes and belt."

Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Naomi scored 68 points.
* Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi, so Yuri scored (1/2) × 68 = 34 points.
* Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
* Therefore, Jojo scored 251 - (Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score) = 251 - (68 + 34 + 85) = 34 points."

Explanation:
Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so she will be able to complete 4 x 360 = 1440 pieces in one hour. Since her mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom will be able to complete 1440 / 2 = 720 pieces in one hour. To find out how long it will take them to complete the entire puzzle, we need to divide the number of pieces by their combined rate of completion: 360 pieces / (4 pieces/minute + 720 pieces/hour) = 5 hours and 20 minutes."

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
* After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, which means 36 watermelons (30% x 120) were ready.
* Two weeks later, when Ashlyn returned, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which means 30 more watermelons (3/4 x 36 = 24) were ready.
* So, in total, 56 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks (120 - 36 - 24 = 56)."

"Response: 108 heures.
Explanation:
Mike receives 2 letters per week from the remaining 3 pen pals, for a total of 6 letters per week (2 x 3 = 6). Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike writes a total of 30 pages per week (6 letters x 5 pages/letter = 30 pages/week).
Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 6 minutes writing each page. Therefore, he spends 6 x 30 = 180 minutes writing per week (30 pages x 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes/week).
Finally, since there are 7 days in a week, Mike spends 180 minutes/day writing (180 minutes/week / 7 days/week = 25.7 minutes/day). So, he spends approximately 25.7 hours writing per week."

Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Griffin started with 24 French fries.
* Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 19 (24 - 5).
* Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 10 more fries than Kyle (twice 5 = 10). So, Kyle took 5 fries and Billy took 15 (10 + 5 = 15).
* Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which we can assume to be 5 fries (a rough estimate since it's not explicitly stated).
* Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle took. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took 2 (3 - 2 = 2).
* Finally, if Griffin had 27 fries in the end, and Kyle took 5 fries, then Billy took 15 fries, Ginger gave him 5 fries, and Colby took 2 fries, the total number of fries taken is: 5 + 15 + 5 + 2 = 37.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries (5 + 5 = 10)."

Answer: $3789.20

Explanation:
To calculate how much Jean paid, we need to multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. For the first week, Jean worked 6 x 4 = 24 hours at $250/hour = $6,000. For the second week, Jean worked 24 x 4 = 96 hours at $250/hour = $24,000. For the third week, Jean worked 96 x 4 = 384 hours at $250/hour = $96,000. And so on...

After the fifth week, the total amount paid by Jean would be:
$6,000 + $24,000 + $96,000 + $192,000 + $288,000 = $856,000

Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, the final amount paid by Jean would be:
$856,000 x (1 - 0.10) = $771,200

Therefore, Jean paid $771,200 for the makeup services during the five-week movie shoot."

Answer: The chef spent a total of $600.
Explanation: To find out how much the chef spent, you need to multiply the number of bags of onions by the weight of each bag and then multiply that result by the price per pound of onions. In this case, the chef bought 4 bags of onions, each bag weighing 50 pounds, so the total weight is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Since each pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300. Therefore, the chef spent $600 (the total cost of the onions)."

Answer: Sue consumed 800 more calories than her sister.
Explanation:
On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. Her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies. Her sister ate 13 cookies.
The total number of cookies eaten by Sue is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Since each cookie has 200 calories, the total number of calories consumed by Sue is 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.
Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, the total number of calories consumed by her sister is 5 x 100 = 500 calories on Monday and 13 x 100 = 1300 calories on Tuesday. Therefore, the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is 9200 - (500 + 1300) = 800 calories."
