"Response: 15 miles
Explanation: Let's analyze the given information step by step:

* John travels at a speed of 60 mph for 3 hours, which means he covers a distance of 60 x 3 = 180 miles.
* He then turns around and heads back home, but spends the first 2 hours in traffic (at a speed of 30 mph). So, he covers a distance of 2 x 30 = 60 miles during this time.
* After that, he travels at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours, covering a distance of 2 x 80 = 160 miles.
* Therefore, the total distance from John's starting point to his destination is 180 + 60 + 160 = 300 miles.

So, at the end of the 4 hours, John is 300 miles away from his starting point."

Explanation: The number of downloads in the first month was 60, which increased by a factor of 3 to 180 in the second month (60 x 3 = 180). However, in the third month, there was a 30% decrease in downloads, resulting in 126 downloads (180 - 30 = 126). Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three months was 180 + 180 + 126 = 586."

Explanation: To calculate how long it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to subtract the initial cost of the tree ($90) and the annual costs for watering and maintenance ($3) from the total revenue he can expect to make each year ($18 per seven citrons x $2 = $36). Since this amount is greater than the annual costs, it will take six years for Carlos to break even."

"Response: 6 liters
Explanation: Let's assume that the original 10 liters of orange juice is composed of x amount of water and y amount of orange juice, where x + y = 10 (since it takes up two-thirds of the total volume). When we add this to the 15 liters of pineapple juice, which contains z amount of water and w amount of pineapple juice, where z + w = 15 (since it takes up three-fifths of the total volume), we get:
x + y + z + w = 10 + 15 = 25
Solving for x, y, z, and w, we get:
x = 8 liters (since x + y = 10)
y = 2 liters (since y/3 = 2/3)
z = 7 liters (since z + w = 15)
w = 8 liters (since w/3 = 8/3)
Therefore, there are 6 liters of water remaining in the 24 Liters of mixture."

If she chooses to buy the shoes, they will be worth $33 + $17 = $50. Since the second option involves buying two pairs of socks, their total value would be $17 x 2 = $34. Therefore, if Gloria decides to purchase the shoes, they are worth $50 - $34 = $16 more than the combined value of the socks."

"Response: 76
Explanation: Let's break down each friend's response and calculate their average estimate:
Günter estimated 80, which is closest to the actual number (100). So, Günter's estimate is 80/3 = 26.67.
The first friend said that 20 is more than half of the original amount, so they estimated 40. Their estimate is 40/3 = 13.33.
The second friend said that 20 is 25% more than the original amount, so they estimated 25 + 20 = 45. Their estimate is 45/3 = 15.
Adding up all these estimates gives us an average of: 26.67 + 13.33 + 15 = 76. Therefore, the friends estimated the jelly beans in the jar as follows: 80 - 40 - 45 = 76."

So now he has $35 left over ($195 - $160 = $35). Since he had 13 Lego sets originally, and he sold them all, he must have 6 remaining Lego sets."
Response: 25 km/h
"Response: 12 km
Explanation: Let's assume that Dana can run at a speed of x miles per hour and walk at a speed of y miles per hour. Since she can skate at half the speed of running, her skating speed is (x/2) miles per hour. To find out how many kilometers she can travel in 6 hours, we need to convert all speeds to kilometers per hour first. Let's do this by multiplying each speed by 0.6214 (since there are approximately 1.60934 kilometers in a mile). So, Dana's running speed is (x \* 0.6214), her walking speed is (y \* 0.6214), and her skating speed is (x/2 \* 0.6214). Now, let's calculate how many kilometers she can travel in 6 hours: Running: (x \* 0.6214) = x km/hr Walking: (y \* 0.6214) = y km/hr Skating: (x/2 \* 0.6214) = (x/2) km/hr Total distance traveled = running + walking + skating Distance = x + y + (x/2) = 6x + 3y In this equation, x represents Dana's running speed, y represents her walking speed, and (x/2) represents her skating speed. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: x = 4, y = 2, and (x/2) = 3. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get: Total distance traveled = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9 km. Therefore, Dana can travel 9 kilometers in 6 hours."

Explanation: To calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles during those three days, we need to multiply the number of articles written in each day by the time it took to write each article.
For Monday, she wrote 5 articles, and each one took 4 hours to write, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing articles that day.
For Tuesday, she wrote 3 articles, and each one took 4 hours to write, so she spent 3 x 4 = 12 hours writing articles that day.
For Wednesday, she wrote 8 articles, and each one took 4 hours to write, so she spent 8 x 4 = 32 hours writing articles that day.
Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles during those three days is 20 + 12 + 32 = 64 hours."

"Response: 4 hours  
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Tomova loď can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour during the initial journey from one point to another. The distance traveled is equal to the product of the speed and time, so if it took 3 hours to travel the first leg of the journey (since the speed was constant), then the total distance traveled would be: Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles. Since the return journey takes place at a slower speed of 6 miles per hour, it will take longer for the ship to cover the same distance. To calculate the time required for the return journey, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours. Therefore, it will take Tomova loď 5 hours to complete the return journey after completing the initial journey at a speed of 10 miles per hour."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Urijah has 15 pounds of books that are too heavy for him to carry. Each comic book weighs half a kilogram (or 1/2 kg), and each toy weighs one-quarter kilogram (or 1/4 kg). To find out how many toys Urijah needs to remove, we can use the following calculation:

Number of toys = Total weight of books / Weight of each toy
= 15 lb / 1/4 kg
= 60 hraček
Since there are 15 pounds of books, and each toy weighs one-fourth of a pound, Urijah needs to remove 60 hraček from his backpack."

Response: 2365 dollars. Explanation: To calculate the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service over the course of the year, we need to use the information provided in the question about the monthly fee and the two different ways in which the company charged her. The first way is by charging her the initial amount at the beginning of the year, and the second way is by charging her 10% less each subsequent month. We can set up this problem as follows: Let x be the initial amount charged to Aleena at the beginning of the year (in this case, $140). Then, let y be the amount charged to her each subsequent month (which is 10% less than the previous month's amount). So, the amount charged to Aleena in the first month was $140, and the amount charged in the second month was $126 (10% less than $140). In general, the amount charged in the ith month will be $114 (10% less than $126). Therefore, the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service over the course of the year is: $140 + ($126 - $114) + ($114 - $102) +... + ($102 - $88) = $2365.

Explanation: Let's assume that there are x number of male students and y number of female students in total. Since there are twice as many boys as girls at school, we can write:
x = 2y
Now, let's find out how many teachers are at the school:
Teachers = Number of students / Number of students per teacher
= (x + y) / 60
Substituting our equations, we get:
Teachers = (2y + y) / 60
Simplifying, we get:
Teachers = 3y / 60
Since y = 5, we have:
Teachers = 3(5) / 60 = 12
Therefore, there are 12 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."

Ryan plants two flowers in his garden every day for 15 days. If after 15 days only 5 of them have not grown, then the total number of flowers that have grown is 9. Here's how we can calculate it:

Day 1: 2 flowers planted = 2 flowers growing
Day 2-3: No new flowers are planted, so there are still 2 flowers growing from Day 1.
Day 4-6: Ryan plants another 2 flowers each day, so now there are 4 + 2 = 6 flowers growing.
Day 7-8: Ryan again plants 2 more flowers, so now there are 6 + 2 = 8 flowers growing.
Day 9-10: Same as above, Ryan plants 2 more flowers each day, so now there are 8 + 2 = 10 flowers growing.
Day 11-15: Ryan continues to plant 2 flowers each day, so by the end of 15 days, he has planted a total of 10 x 15 = 150 flowers! However, since only 5 did not grow, the actual number of flowers that grew is 150 - 5 = 145. Therefore, the answer is 145."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the number of containers that were delivered on the second day is equal to the total number of containers in the port plus the number of containers delivered on the first day minus the number of containers that each container contained (i.e., 5 vehicles). Therefore, if there were initially 2 containers containing 10 vehicles (for a total of 20 vehicles), and an additional 4 containers were delivered on the second day, the total number of vehicles in the port would be 20 + 4 = 24. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of containers delivered on the second day is 24 / 5 = 4.8. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a container, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 6 containers delivered on the second day."

"Response: 300 dollars per day. 
Explanation: The total number of patients seen by doctors in one day is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. If each patient visit takes an average of 24 minutes and there are 150 doctors working at the hospital, then the total time spent by doctors on patient visits is 12,000 minutes / 150 doctors = 80 hours/day. Since each doctor earns $150 per hour, the total amount earned by doctors from patient visits is 80 hours/day \* $150/hour = $12,000 per day. Similarly, if there are 200 beds in the hospital and each bed costs $200 per day to maintain, then the total cost of maintaining the hospital is $200 per day \* 200 beds = $40,000 per day. Therefore, the profit made by the hospital is $12,000 - $40,000 = $28,000 per day."

Explanation: To calculate the score needed for Brinley to have an average of 93 after six tests, we can use the formula:
average = (sum of all scores) / number of tests
In this case, the sum of all scores is:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 558
And there are 6 tests in total, so we divide the sum by 6:
558 / 6 = 93
So Brinley needs a score of 84 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93."

"Response: 2 gallons
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, both basins lose 4 gallons per minute. The big basin has twice as much water as the small one, so it loses 8 gallons per minute (4 x 2 = 8). Since the big basin has four times as much water as the small one, the small basin loses half as much water as the big basin, or 4 gallons per minute (1/4 x 8 = 4). Therefore, the small basin contains 2 gallons of water (since it loses 4 gallons per minute and there are 5 minutes left before the first basin emptying)."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails.
In the second aquarium, there are 32 fish (not snails).
The difference between the number of fish in both aquariums is twice the number of snails in the second aquarium.
So, if the number of fish in the second aquarium is x, then the number of snails in the first aquarium is 4 - 2x.
We know that the total number of fish and snails in both aquariums is equal, so we can set up the equation:
4 - 2x + 32 = 4 - 2(x) + 16
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 16
Solving for x, we get:
x = 8
Therefore, there are 8 fish in the second aquarium."
