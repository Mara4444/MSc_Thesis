"Response: 360
Explanation:
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 × 4 = 8 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 × 20 = 80 sheep.
Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is: 8 + 80 + 20 = 360."
"Response:  The total time taken to download the file = (Total size of the file / Download speed) + Time spent on restarting the computer after installation of updates.
In this case, Total size of the file = 200 GB, Download speed = 2 GB/minute = 120 MB/minute, and Time spent on restarting the computer = 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to download the file = (200 GB / 120 MB/minute) + 20 minutes = 3 hours 20 minutes."
"Response:  The distance from John's location to his home can be calculated as follows:

1. First 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
2. Next half-hour:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 0.5 hour = 15 miles
3. Remaining time:
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 2 hours = 160 miles
Total distance = Distance from start + Distance from halfway point = 120 + 15 + 160 = 395 miles
Therefore, John is approximately 395 miles away from his home at the end of the 4 hours."
Response:  Let E be Eliza's total earnings for the week. According to the problem, Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, so her earnings for the first 40 hours she works (x) can be calculated as follows: E = 40x. Since Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, we can find her total earnings by adding the amount she earned working her regular hours to the amount she earned in overtime: E = 40x + (45 - 40) \* 1.2x = 40x + 5x = 45x. Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $45x.

"Response: 4

Based on the question, we know that:

* The cost of planting the lemon tree is $90.
* Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each.
* It costs $3 per year to water and feed the tree.

To calculate how long it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to subtract the annual cost of maintaining the tree ($3) from the revenue generated by the tree ($1.5 x 7 = $10.5). This means that in the first year, Carlos will have a loss of $2.5 ($90 - $10.5 = $2.5).

In subsequent years, the number of lemons produced by the tree will increase by 7, so the revenue will also increase by $10.5 each year. However, the annual maintenance cost remains at $3. Therefore, it will take Carlos 4 years (or 4 x $2.5 = $10) to break even on his investment and start earning money from his lemon tree."
"Response: 10

Câu trả lời: Based on the question, we know that Melanie started with 10 vacuum cleaners.

Explanation:
The question states that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold 3/10 = 2 vacuum cleaners. Then, she sold 2 more to the red house, so she sold an additional 2 vacuum cleaners. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold 5 - (5 / 2) = 3 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which means she started with 10 vacuum cleaners."
"Response: 16%.
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance. (So, 20/20 = 1)
* Of the remaining students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. (So, 20 + (20 \* 25%) = 35)
* The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. (So, 35 + (35 \* 75%) = 85)
* Therefore, the total number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 85.
* To find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students by the total number of students: 85 / 40 = 21.25%.
Therefore, the answer is 16%."

"Response:  The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters can be calculated as follows:

Original volume of orange drink = 10 liters (two-thirds)
Original volume of pineapple drink = 15 liters (three- fifths)
Total original volume = 10 + 15 = 25 liters

After pouring, the volume of orange drink spilled = 1 liter
Remaining volume of orange drink = 10 - 1 = 9 liters

New total volume = Original volume of orange drink + Remaining volume of orange drink + New volume of pineapple drink
= 9 + 15 = 24 liters

Therefore, there are 24 liters of water in the remaining mixture."

"Response: 12 min/mile

Based on the question, we know that John runs for 3 days a week and each time he runs for 3 hours. We also know that he runs at different speeds on each of those days. Let's assume that his speed on the first day is S1 miles per hour, and his speed on the second and third days is half of that (S1/2).

We can use the formula: distance = speed x time to find out how far John runs each day:
distance = S1 x 3 hours = 3S1 miles

Since John runs for 60 miles per week, we can set up another equation based on this information:
60 miles = 3S1 miles + (3/2)S1 miles + (3/4)S1 miles

Now we have three equations and three variables (S1, S2, and S3):

Equation 1: 3S1 = 60 miles
Equation 2: 3S2 = 3(3/2)S1 = 54 miles
Equation 3: 3S3 = 3(3/4)S1 = 48 miles

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
S1 = 12 minutes/mile

Therefore, John runs at an average pace of 12 minutes per mile."
"Response: 60 miles

Explanation:
Let's assume that Dana runs for x hours and walks for (6 - x) hours. Since she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we know that her running rate is 4x miles per hour, while her walking rate is x/4 miles per hour.

We are given that she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, so her skipping rate is 2x miles per hour.

The total distance traveled by Dana in six hours can be calculated as follows:

Total distance = Running rate x Running time + Walking rate x Walking time + Skipping rate x Skipping time
= 4x x 2/3 x 2 = 60 miles

Therefore, Dana can travel 60 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking."

Explanation:
Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, which is 1200 feet (3 x 400). Therefore, if Polly stands outside of the reach of the dragon's flames by 2500 - 1200 = 1300 feet, she can still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"Response:  The guests took 9 pieces of pie (5 pies x 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces; 40 - 14 = 26 pieces left)."
"Response:  To determine the number of grams of chips that can be eaten based on the given information, we need to calculate the remaining calories available for consumption after consuming 1800 calories from other sources throughout the day. Let's assume that the person has already consumed 1800 calories from other foods and drinks before eating the bag of chips. Therefore, the total calories available for consumption in a day are:

Total Calories Available = Daily Calorie Target - Calories Consumed (from other foods/drinks) = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Now, let's divide the remaining calories by the number of servings in the bag of chips:

Number of Grams of Chips That Can Be Eaten = Remaining Calories / Number of Servings in Bag = 200 / 5 = 40 grams

Therefore, if the person wants to stay within their daily calorie target of 2000 calories and they have already consumed 1800 calories from other foods/drinks, they can safely eat up to 40 grams of chips (based on the provided information)."
"Response:  The net profit = (Selling price per candle) x (Number of candles sold) - (Cost of supplies per candle)
In this case, the selling price per candle is $2.00, the number of candles sold is 20, and the cost of supplies per candle is ($10.00 / 10 candles) = $1.00. Therefore, the net profit = $2.00 x 20 = $40.00 - $1.00 = $39.00."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. (So, she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours researching and writing articles on Monday.)
* On Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, if she wrote x articles on Monday, she wrote 2x articles on Tuesday. (So, she spent 2x x 4 = 8 hours researching and writing articles on Tuesday.)
* On Wednesday, Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, if she wrote x articles on Tuesday, she wrote 2x articles on Wednesday. (So, she spent 2x x 4 = 8 hours researching and writing articles on Wednesday.)

Now, let's add up the total time Meredith spent writing articles in the three days:

Monday: 20 hours + Tuesday: 8 hours + Wednesday: 8 hours = 56 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days was 56 hours."

Based on the question, we know that there are 15 floors in the apartment building and each floor has 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:

15 floors × 8 units/floor = 120 units

Now, we are told that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that the number of unoccupied units is:

120 units - (3/4) × 120 units = 96 units

Therefore, there are 96 unoccupied units in the building."
Response:  Lloyd makes $408 per week on eggs (252 eggs/day x $2/dozen x 7 days/week).
"Response:  The time it takes for Tom to get back is 2 hours and 30 minutes.

Here's how you can arrive at that answer:

Tom starts sailing at 1 PM, so the distance he covers in the first period (1-4 PM) is:
distance = speed x time = 10 miles/hour x 5 hours = 50 miles

After 4 PM, Tom reduces his speed to 6 miles per hour. So, the distance he covers in the second period (from 4 PM to 6 PM) is:
distance = speed x time = 6 miles/hour x 2 hours = 12 miles

The total distance covered by Tom is therefore:
total distance = distance + distance = 50 miles + 12 miles = 62 miles

Now, we need to find out what proportion of this distance Tom has traveled during each period. Let's do that by dividing the distance covered in each period by the total distance:
proportion of distance traveled = distance / total distance = 50 miles / 62 miles = 0.8 or 80%

So, Tom has traveled 80% of the total distance during the first period (1-4 PM), which means he still needs to cover 20% of the distance (or 12 miles) during the second period (from 4 PM to 6 PM). Therefore, it will take Tom 2 hours and 30 minutes to get back, since he needs to cover 12 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that the total weight of all the items in his backpack is 15 pounds, and that the comic books weigh 1/4 pound each. So if he removes 30 comic books, the new weight of the comic books will be 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. This means that the remaining weight in his backpack is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since the toys weigh 1/2 pound each, we can find out how many toys he needs to remove by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy: 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 toys. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his backpack.

"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total amount of gas left in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling it. We can do this by using the following formula:
distance = (gas remaining / distance driven) x 100
In this case, the gas remaining is 8 gallons (12 - 4), and the distance driven is 100 miles. So, we can plug these values into the formula to get:
distance = (8 / 100) x 100 = 800 miles
Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 800 miles on a single tank of gas."

"Response:  Judy makes $750.00 per week.

Here's how you can arrive at that answer:

* Number of days Judy teaches dance classes per week = 7 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 15
* Total number of dance classes Judy teaches per week = 5 (classes per day) × 15 (days per week) = 75
* Average number of students per class = 15 (students per class) / 75 (total classes per week) = 2
* Total amount of money Judy makes per week = 2 (average number of students per class) × $15.00 (charge per student) = $300.00

So, Judy makes $300.00 per week teaching dance classes."

"Response:  Artie will make $35.60.
Explanation: To find out how much Artie will make, we need to multiply the number of pots of each type of flower that he sold by its rounded price. For marigolds, he sold 12 pots at $2.74 per pot = $31.88; for petunias, he sold 9 pots at $1.87 per pot = $16.53; and for begonias, he sold 17 pots at $2.12 per pot = $35.24. Therefore, Artie will make a total of $31.88 + $16.53 + $35.24 = $35.60."
"Response: 8
Explanation:
We know that the total square footage of all four levels of the sandcastle is equal to 16 (the area of the top level). Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can set up the following equation:
Level 1 = 2 Level 0
Level 2 = 4 Level 1
Level 3 = 8 Level 2
Level 4 = 16 Level 3
Substituting these values into the equation for the total square footage of the sandcastle, we get:
16 = 2 × 16 + 4 × 8 + 8 × 4 + 2 × 2
Simplifying this equation, we get:
16 = 32 + 32 + 32 + 16
Solving for the average square footage of each level, we get:
Average square footage of Level 1 = 32 / 4 = 8
Average square footage of Level 2 = 32 / 3 = 10
Average square footage of Level 3 = 32 / 2 = 16
Average square footage of Level 4 = 16 / 1 = 16
Therefore, the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle is 8, 10, 16, and 16 respectively."
"Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs and divide it by the number of cups per bag. Let's do that:
Total number of cups of dog food needed = 1 cup/day x 180 days + 2 cups/day x remaining days = 180 + (365 - 180) = 485 cups
Since there are 110 cups per bag, Cecilia will use:
Number of bags = Total number of cups / Number of cups per bag = 485 / 110 = 4.4 bags
So, Cecilia will use approximately 4.4 bags of dog food in the first year."

"Response: 180
Explanation:
Let's call the number of doorbell rings made by the first friend ""x"". Since the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, the number of doorbell rings made by the second friend is x + (x/4).
Similarly, the number of doorbell rings made by the third friend is x + (x/4) + (x/2), and the number of doorbell rings made by the fourth friend is x + (x/4) + (x/2) + 60.
We can simplify these equations as follows:
x + (x/4) = 20... (1)
x + (x/4) + (x/2) = 10(3)... (2)
x + (x/4) + (x/2) + 60 = 180... (3)
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 180

In this case, Solo needs to read a total of 69 pages (4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 69). Since he already read 15 pages on Monday, he has 54 pages left to read (69 - 15 = 54). Therefore, he needs to read an average of 54/5 = 10.8 pages per day to finish all his reading within the given time frame.

"Response: 30

Based on the question, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so Jamal's phone can hold 6 × 1800 = 10800 photographs.
We also know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, if there are X birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, then Brittany's phone can hold at most 50X photographs.
Therefore, if Jamal's phone can hold 10800 photographs, then the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 30."
Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her lumber, we need to calculate the total revenue and then subtract the total cost. The total revenue is the sum of the price of each board multiplied by the number of boards sold. For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the price per board is $10, so the total revenue from these boards is $10 x 10 = $100. For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the price per board is $16, so the total revenue from these boards is $16 x 5 = $80. Therefore, the total revenue from both sets of boards is $100 + $80 = $180. Next, we need to subtract the total cost of the boards from the total revenue. The total cost of the boards is the sum of the cost of each board multiplied by the number of boards purchased. For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the cost per board is $10, so the total cost from these boards is $10 x 10 = $100. For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the cost per board is $16, so the total cost from these boards is $16 x 5 = $80. Therefore, the total cost of both sets of boards is $100 + $80 = $180. So, if Sasha sells all of her lumber, she will make a profit of $180 - $180 = $0.

Based on the question, we know that the customs officer at the main port of SeaSide cleared 2 containers of imported vehicles on the first day, with each container containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles cleared on the first day is 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.

On the second day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can deduce that there are 30 / 5 = 6 containers of vehicles at the port on the second day.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 6 containers of vehicles were imported on the second day."
"Response:  The total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is $85000.

Explanation:
We know that Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, so Adrien's salary was $40000 + (30% of $40000) = $46000.
Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, which means it became $46000 x 1.4 = $62400.
Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, so her new salary is $40000 + (40% of $40000) = $56000.
Therefore, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is $62400 + $56000 = $85000."

"Response: 40
Explanation: Let's say the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters was x before Jennie started. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie finished is 3x/2. The total number of letters in both piles (needing stamps and already-stamped) is 60, so we can set up the equation: 3x/2 + x = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 40. Therefore, there were 40 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began."

"Response: 360 + 300 + 100 = 760
Explanation:
The total number of watermelons that Dillon needs to buy is 4. Each watermelon costs 3 times as much as each pepper, so the cost of one watermelon is 3 \* 15 = 45. Therefore, the total cost of all 4 watermelons is 45 + 45 + 45 + 45 = 180.
Similarly, the total number of peppers that Dillon needs to buy is 20. Each pepper costs 15, so the total cost of all 20 peppers is 15 + 15 +... + 15 = 300.
Finally, the total number of oranges that Dillon needs to buy is 10. Each orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of one orange is 45 - 5 = 40. Therefore, the total cost of all 10 oranges is 40 + 40 +... + 40 = 400.
Therefore, the total amount of money that Dillon will spend on buying these fruits is 180 + 300 + 400 = 760."

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. So, his total distance walked on Monday = 4 miles.
* On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, his total distance walked on Tuesday = 6 × 4 = 24 miles.
* Total mileage from Monday to Wednesday (inclusive) = 4 + 24 +... + X = 41 miles, where X is the distance walked on Wednesday.

Since Walt walked a total of 41 miles from Monday to Wednesday, and he walked 25 miles on Wednesday, we can conclude that he walked 25 miles on Wednesday."

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* There are 27 unicorns left in the world.
* One-third of them are in the Scottish Highlands, which means that 9 unicorns (3/5) are in Scotland.
* Two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, which means that 6 unicorns (2/3) are female and located in Scotland.

Now, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns by multiplying the total number of unicorns in Scotland by the proportion of female unicorns:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = Total number of unicorns in Scotland × Proportion of female unicorns
= 9 × 0.6
= 5.4

So, there are 5.4 female Scottish unicorns. Since you cannot have a fraction of a unicorn, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."

Similarly, for the second test, Mark took 100 questions and completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour, so he spent 100/5 = 20 hours on the second test. Since he had 6 hours to complete the second test, he left 6 - 20 = 4 hours of questions unanswered."

"Response: 57.60

Based on the question, here's how you can calculate the total cost of each item:

* Milk: $2/gal = $2 x 1 gal = $2
* Eggs: $3/dozen = $3 x 1 dozen = $3
* Light bulbs: $3/pack = $3 x 1 pack = $3
* Cups: $3/package = $3 x 1 package = $3
* Roach traps: $4/pack = $4 x 1 pack = $4

Total cost of non-food items = $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $18

Since there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, we need to multiply the total cost by 1.10 (to get the final price including tax):

$18 x 1.10 = $19.80

Therefore, the total cost of everything at the store is $19.80."
"Response: 108
Answer: $108
Explanation: To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the total expenses (bleach and cloths) from the total income. The total income per week is $92, and the total expenses are $14 (2 x $2 for bleach + $5 for cloths). Therefore, the profit per week is:
Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
= $92 - $14
= $108
So, Lucas will make a profit of $108 per week from his housekeeping business."

Based on the question, you can infer that Johnny picked up all the Legos on the floor of his room. Therefore, the total number of Legos he picked up is equal to the sum of the number of pieces in each Lego set he mentioned.

Johnny said that one of the sets has 500 pieces, another set has three times as many pieces (or 1500 pieces), and another set has 1/4 the number of pieces (or 625 pieces). So, the total number of Legos Johnny picked up is:

500 + 1500 + 625 = 2750

Therefore, the answer is 2750."

Response:  James has 48 Facebook friends.
"Response:  The answer is 15 minutes. Here's why:
Let's start by using the information given in the problem:
* Steve lives 3 miles from the school (which means he has a distance of 3 miles to cover).
* Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute (which means he covers 440 feet every minute).
* Tim lives 2 miles from the school (which means he has a distance of 2 miles to cover).
* Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute (which means he covers 264 feet every minute).
Now let's calculate the time it takes for each person to reach their house:
For Steve:
Distance = 3 miles
Speed = 440 feet/minute
Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 440 feet/minute = 7 minutes
So it takes Steve 7 minutes to reach his house after leaving the school.
For Tim:
Distance = 2 miles
Speed = 264 feet/minute
Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 264 feet/minute = 8 minutes
So it takes Tim 8 minutes to reach his house after leaving the school.
Now, we need to find out when the winner will arrive at their house. Let's assume that Steve starts the race first and reaches his house in 7 minutes as calculated above. Then, if Tim starts the race immediately after Steve, it will take him 8 minutes to reach his house. So, the winner (Steve) will arrive at their house 7 + 8 = 15 minutes after starting the race. Therefore, the winner will wait 15 minutes for the loser (Tim) to catch up."
Response:  To calculate how much Shawnda made from inflating bikes and tricycles, we need to multiply the number of tires inflated by the cost per tire. For the bicycles, 5 people had 10 tires inflated (since each person has 2 tires), so that was $1.25 in revenue. The tricycles had 3 tires inflated at $0.75 per tire, for a total of $2.25 in revenue. And the unicyclist paid $0.25 for 1 tire. Therefore, Shawnda made a total of $4.75 that day.

"Response: 42

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* Dave ate 14 French fries.
* A seagull ate half of the remaining fries (which was 14). So, the seagull ate 7 French fries (half of 14).
* Three pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 French fries.
* A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which means he ate 2/3 x 7 = 5 French fries.
* Ants carried off one French fry.

So, the total number of French fries left after all these events are: 7 - 7 - 9 - 5 - 1 = 42. Therefore, there were 42 French fries in the pack when Dave bought it."

Explanation:
The total value of the toys is equal to the sum of their individual prices. Since each red car costs $4, then the total value of the 5 red cars is $4 x 5 = $20. Similarly, since each action figure costs $5, then the total value of the 3 action figures is $5 x 3 = $15. Finally, the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car, so its value is $15 + $20 = $35. Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $35 = $70."

"Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month first. The total monthly payment for Jessica's debts is:
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000/month
Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she will pay:
$1000 (total monthly payment) x 1.5 (50% more) = $1500/month
So, Jessica pays $1500 per month towards her debts. In a year, she will pay:
$1500 (monthly payment) x 12 (number of months in a year) = $18,000/year
Therefore, Jessica pays $18,000 per year towards her debts."

"Response: 40%
Explanation: The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 1/6 = 0.17. To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling another even number on the second roll. This can be done by multiplying the probabilities of each event occurring separately: P(rolling an even number on the first roll) × P(rolling an even number on the second roll | rolling an even number on the first roll). Since there are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of six possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%."

"Response:  The trader sold 13 bags of wheat.

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The trader pays $20 per bag for the wheat.
* It costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse.
* The trader makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags.
* The bags are sold at a rate of $30 each.

Now, let's use these pieces of information to find out how many bags the trader sold:

Profit = Selling price - Cost per bag
= $30 - ($2 x Number of bags)

We know that the trader made a total profit of $400, so we can set up an equation:

$400 = $30 - ($2xNumber of bags)

Now, we need to solve for ""Number of bags"". We can do this by isolating ""Number of bags"" on one side of the equation:

$400 = $30 - ($2xNumber of bags)
$400 - $60 = $30 - ($2xNumber of bags)
-$60 = $30 - ($2xNumber of bags)

Now, we have two equations:

-$60 = $30 - ($2xNumber of bags)
-$60 = $30 - ($2xbags)

Solving both equations simultaneously, we get:

Number of bags = 13

Therefore, the trader sold 13 bags of wheat."

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one-third of the flamingos (which is equal to 6 flamingos). They then painted those six flamingos white and returned them to Sue's front yard, so now there are 12 white flamingos (6 + 6 = 12).
On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection, bringing the total number of flamingos to 30 (18 + 12 = 30).
So at noon on Sunday, there were 30 pink plastic flamingos more than white plastic flamingos."

Since each restaurant received 2 pounds of carrots, that means 3 pounds (5 - 2) of carrots were left over or not used. Therefore, the answer is 198 pounds."
Response:  There are 5579 kids in Soda.
"Response:  Elaine has 80 Pokémon cards in total.

Explanation:
In the first month, Elaine collected 3x20 = 60 Pokémon cards.
In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first two months, which is 40 + 60 = 100 cards.
Therefore, Elaine has 100 + 60 = 160 Pokémon cards in total."

"Response: 43680

Based on the question, we know that John won an award with a 1-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary. We also know that he makes $2000 per week throughout the year. Therefore, if he received the award on the first day of the year, his total earnings for the year would be:

$2000/week \* 52 weeks = $104,000 (annual income)
+ $5000 (monetary reward) = $109,000 (total earnings)

So, John made $109,000 in the year after receiving the award."
Response:  The farm produces 5 tons of grapes per acre per year, so the total amount of grapes produced by the 10 acres is 50 tons (5 tons/acre x 10 acres). Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total number of barrels of wine produced by the farm is 100 barrels (50 tons x 2 barrels/ton). Therefore, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.
"Response: 14 slices of cheese.
Explanation:
Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which means he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich (his favorite food is cheese). He also ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week, which means he used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Therefore, he used an additional 3 slices of cheese for breakfast (3 x 1 = 3). Additionally, he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that lasted him several dinners, which means he used 8 slices of cheese in that dish (8 slices / 3 meals = 2.67 slices/meal x number of meals = 5.34 slices). Finally, since he had 5.34 slices of cheese left over after making the macaroni and cheese, we can subtract that amount from the total number of slices he used throughout the week to find his final answer: 14 slices of cheese (5.34 slices - 2 slices/sandwich x 7 sandwiches = 14 slices)."

Explanation:
Brinley needs a score of 45 or higher on the sixth test to get an average of 93. This can be calculated by subtracting the lowest score (71) from the total number of scores (6): 6 - 71 = 55. Then, dividing the remaining scores by 5 (since there are only 5 scores left after removing the lowest one): 55 / 5 = 11. So, Brinley needs a score of at least 11 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93."

"Response:  Sara needs to mow the lawn 8 times in order to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. Here is how I arrived at this answer:
* Cost of jacket = $30
* Cost of one pair of shoes = $20
* Total cost of jacket and two pairs of shoes = $30 + ($20 x 2) = $70
* Amount Sara has already saved = $10
* Number of times Sara must mow the lawn = $70 / ($4 per mowing) = 8 mowings
Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 8 times in order to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."

Explanation: According to the question, Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day and 50 more customers on the second day, so the total number of customers on the second day was 150 (100 + 50). On the third day, there were 50 more customers than on the second day, so the total number of customers on the third day was 200 (150 + 50). Therefore, Sloane counted 300 customers on the third day."
"Response: 20 gallon
Explanation: Let's call the amount of water in the small pool ""x"" gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons. Now, since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the small pool is 1/4 of what it was before, which is (2x)/4 = x/2 gallons. So, the small pool currently has 20 gallons of water (since 20 is half of 40)."

Response:  Jojo scored 39 points.
Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle. For the crossword puzzles, it took her 10 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 minutes solving crossword puzzles. For the sudoku puzzles, it took her 5 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 minutes solving sudoku puzzles. Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 30 + 20 = 50 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
Response:  The amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters is 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30). Since the collected rainwater is twice as much as the remaining water in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank now is 60 liters (30 + 2 x 30 = 60).

Andy plants 90 geraniums, so the number of geraniums he plants is 90.
He also plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, so the number of petunias he plants is 90 - 40 = 50.
Therefore, Andy plants a total of 90 + 50 = 140 flowers."

Response:  To find out how long it will take for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to know how many pieces are in the puzzle and how quickly they can work together. If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, then they can place 2 pieces per minute together. Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, it will take them 180 minutes (or 3 hours) to complete it.

Lý do:  After two months, there were 120 baby watermelons on the farm. If 30% of them were ready for harvest, then the number of ready-to-harvest watermelons was 36 (30% of 120). Two weeks later, if 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, then the number of non-ready watermelons left on the farm was 44 (120 - 36 - 4 = 44). Therefore, there were 70 watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks."
"Response:  $240,000

Explanation:
Mark pays $20,000 per car, so he pays a total of $240,000 for all 12 cars ($20,000 x 12 = $240,000).
The tax rate is 10%, so Mark pays $20,000 in taxes on the cars ($240,000 x 10% = $20,000).
Adding the tax payment to the cost of the cars gives us the total amount that Mark pays for everything: $240,000 + $20,000 = $260,000."

Reasoning:
Steve wants to grow his own cherry tomatoes so that he can eat twice as much as his girlfriend. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, and each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, Steve needs 4 vines to meet his daily demand of 24 tomatoes (6 tomatoes/day x 4 days/week)."

Ram uses a lot of pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?

Let's assume that each pen contains 0.5 ml of ink (this is just an estimate, as the actual amount of ink in a pen can vary).

If Ram mixes the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen, he will have:

5 pens \* 0.5 ml/pen = 2.5 ml of ink

So, if he buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, he will have:

25 pens \* 0.5 ml/pen = 12.5 ml of ink

Since he mixed the ink from five pens to make one full pen, he will have:

12.5 ml / 0.5 ml/pen = 25 pens

Therefore, Ram gets to have 25 pens in total."

"Response: 40

Solution:
Let's assume that Mary's age is M, Joan's age is J, and Jessa's age is J.

From the problem statement, we know that:

* Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Joan's age minus Mary's age = 2.
* Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Jessa's age plus five = Joan's age.

So, we can write:
M + J - 2 = J + 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:
3M = 7

Now, let's solve for M:
M = 7 / 3
M = 23

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
Mary (age 23) + Joan (age 28) + Jessa (age 20) = 61

Answer: 61"

Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Initially, there were 1000 students in the school hall.
* After the meeting, 30% of the students (300) went out through exit A.
* Of the remaining 700 students, 3/5 (420) went out through exit B.
* So, the total number of students who went out through exit C is 700 - 420 = 280.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."

Explanation:
We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so if Robert has x candies, John has 2x candies. We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has x + 6 candies. Finally, we are told that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:

John's candies = 2Robert's candies + (James's candies - Robert's candies)
= 2(x) + (x + 6 - x)
= 2x + 12

Solving for John's candies, we get:

John's candies = 28

Therefore, John has 28 more candies than James."

Reasoning: Each person reads 2 of their own books (1 book from themselves + 1 book from the other person) plus 1 additional book from the other person = 3 books in total per person. Since there are 2 people, together they will collectively read 6 books by the end."
"Response: 10 hours
Mike has been a penpal with 5 people for 3 months. Each person sends 2 letters per week, and Mike replies to each letter in kind. Therefore, Mike receives 10 letters per week (5 people x 2 letters/week). Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike spends 50 hours reading the letters he receives each week (10 letters x 5 pages/letter).
Now, let's calculate how much time Mike spends writing letters. Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, and he spends 10 hours per week writing letters, Mike writes approximately 170 pages per week (10 hours/week x 6 minutes/page).
Therefore, Mike spends approximately 10 hours per week writing letters to his pen pals."
"Response: 900
Explanation:
Jason has a total of 1000 minutes in his phone plan for the month. He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, which is equal to 45 minutes per week (since there are 7 days in a week). Therefore, Jason uses up 45 minutes + 45 minutes = 90 minutes of his total allowance each week. Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason has used up 90 minutes / 30 days = 900 minutes of his total allowance by the end of the month."

Câu hỏi:  Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.  Billy took twice as many as Kyle.  Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.  If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?

Based on the question, we know that:

* Griffin initially had 24 French fries.
* Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 19.
* Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 9 more fries (for a total of 18).
* Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her own fries, which is equal to 5 fries.
* Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle took, so he took 2 fries (for a total of 16).

Therefore, the final number of French fries that Griffin has is:

24 - 5 = 19 + 9 = 28 + 5 = 33

So, Ginger gave Griffin 10 French fries (since she gave him a ""handful"")."
Response:  Let's assume that the number of fish in Aquarium A is x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can write: Snails in Aquarium B = 2x + 16 (since there are 16 more snails in Aquarium B than in Aquarium A). Now, we know that there are 4 snails in Aquarium A and 32 snails in Aquarium B, so we can set up a proportion to find out how many fish are in each aquarium: Number of fish in Aquarium A = 4/9 = x/9 Number of fish in Aquarium B = 32 - 16 = 16. Therefore, there are 9 fish in Aquarium A and 16 fish in Aquarium B.

Response:  Let's assume that Sue consumed x calories on Monday and y calories on Tuesday. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue consumed 4x calories, while her sister consumed x/4 calories. Similarly, since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, Sue consumed 2(4x) = 8x calories, while her sister consumed (x/4) + 13 = z calories. We know that Sue consumed more calories than her sister, so we can set up the equation: 8x > z. Solving for x, we get: x > 7. Therefore, Sue consumed more than 7 times as many calories as her sister.
