"Response: 25 miles
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (in this case, speed), and t is the time. We know that John traveled for four hours, so the time he spent driving was 4 hours. He also told us that he drove at a constant speed of 80 mph during the last two hours of his trip, which means he covered half of the total distance in those two hours. Therefore, the distance he traveled can be calculated as follows:
d = rt = 80 x 2 = 160 miles
Since John started his journey three hours ago, the distance from his current location to home is equal to the distance he traveled during the last four hours minus the distance he traveled during the first three hours. So, the distance from his current location to home is:
distance = d - (3 x d) = 160 - (3 x 160) = 25 miles
Therefore, John is 25 miles away from home after four hours of driving."

"Response: 210 downloads (Explanation: See below)

In this problem, we are given that the number of downloads for a new program was 60 in the first month, which means that the average number of downloads per day is:

Number of downloads = Total downloads / Number of days
= 60 / 30
= 2 downloads/day

Now, we are told that the number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as in the first month, so the total number of downloads in the second month is:

Total downloads in second month = Number of downloads in first month x 3
= 2 x 60
= 120 downloads

However, we are also told that the number of downloads in the third month fell by 30%, so the total number of downloads in the third month is:

Total downloads in third month = Number of downloads in second month x 0.7
= 120 x 0.7
= 84 downloads

Therefore, the total number of downloads for the entire period of three months is:

Total downloads = Sum of downloads in each month
= 60 + 120 + 84
= 264 downloads

So, the answer to the question is 264 downloads."

"Response: 60 years
Explanation: To calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the initial cost of planting the tree ($90), the annual cost of caring for the tree ($3), and the revenue generated by the seven lemons he can sell each year ($1,50 per stem). We can set up an equation using these values:

Yearly Cost = Initial Cost + Annual Cost
Revenue = Number of Lemons x Selling Price

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Yearly Cost = $90 + $3 = $93
Revenue = 7 x $1,50 = $105

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to break even (i.e., when the total revenue equals the total cost), we can set up another equation:

Yearly Cost - Revenue = 0
$93 - $105 = -$12

Since the difference between the yearly cost and revenue is negative, this means that Carlos will not make any profit until the 60th year after planting the tree. Therefore, the answer is 60 years."

"Response: 7436.92
Explanation: To calculate the fortune that the merchant can make by choosing either of the two options, we need to use the formula: Fortune = (Option value x Expected growth rate) / (1 + Expected growth rate)^Number of months. In this case, Option A is worth $5,000 and has an expected growth rate of 2.5%. Option B is worth $8,000 and has an expected growth rate of 1.2%. If the merchant chooses one of these options within the same month, then the fortune they will make at the end of the month can be calculated as follows: Fortune = ($5,000 x 2.5%) / (1 + 2.5%)^1 = $7436.92."

Explanation: Let's analyze each friend's response:
Friend 1 says there are 80 bonbons in the jar. This is a straightforward estimate.
Friend 2 says there are 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate, which means they think there are 80 + (50% of 80) = 120 bonbons in the jar.
Friend 3 says there are 25% more than the first friend's estimate, which means they think there are 80 x 1.25 = 100 bonbons in the jar.
Now, let's find the average of these estimates:
(80 + 120 + 100) / 3 = 137
Therefore, based on their responses, the friends estimate that there are approximately 137 marmalade bonbons in the jar."

Since the dragon is 300 meters (984 feet) away, the distance between Polly and the dragon after throwing the spear would be 800 + 300 = 1100 feet."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Jamal's phone can hold 1800 images.
* Britain's phone can hold 6 times as many images as Jamal's phone.
* The maximum number of images that Britain's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photo of ducks in the zoo.

Now, let's apply these facts to find the number of birds in Jamal's photo:

Number of images = 1800 (Jamal's phone)
Multiple of images = 6 (Britain's phone)
Maximum number of images = 50 x (number of birds in Jamal's photo)

Substituting the values, we get:

Number of images = 1800
Multiple of images = 6
Maximum number of images = 50 x (number of birds in Jamal's photo)

Solving for the number of birds, we get:

Number of birds = Maximum number of images / Number of images
= 50 x (number of birds in Jamal's photo) / 1800
= 96

Therefore, there are 96 birds in Jamal's photo of ducks in the zoo."

Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive and did not return.
* Half of the remaining bees (i.e., half of 30) returned to the hive within the next 6 hours. This means that 15 bees returned.
* Double the number of bees that left the hive but did not return (i.e., double 30), which gives us 60 bees.
* Since all the bees that left the hive but did not return came back within 6 hours, we can add these 60 bees to the total number of bees that returned. Therefore, the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours is 75 (15 + 60).

So, the answer is 45 bees."

For Steve, this is 3 miles or 18,000 feet (since there are 5,280 feet in a mile). So, he will cover that distance in 440/18,000 = 0.0247 hours or 15 minutes. Similarly, for Tim, who has a speed of 264 feet per minute and lives 2 miles away from the school, he will cover his distance in 264/5,280 = 0.005 hours or 3 minutes. Therefore, the winner will arrive home first after 15 minutes."

"Response: 50
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:
1. Dave bought a large bag of French fries and ate 14 before a hungry seagull stole the bag from his hand.
2. The seagull ate half of the remaining French fries (7).
3. Three ducks came and forced the seagull away from the food (0).
4. A washbowrn bird stole two-thirds of the remaining French fries (4).
5. A mouse took one last French fry (1).
6. Afterward, there were five French fries left in the bag.
Now, let's calculate the total number of French fries in the bag when Dave bought it:
Total = 50 (initial amount) - 14 (eaten by Dave) + 7 (eaten by seagull) - 0 (forced away by ducks) + 4 (stolen by washbowrn bird) + 1 (taken by mouse) = 50
Therefore, there were 50 French fries in the bag when Dave bought it."
"Response: 30 hours
Explanation:
Kimo has three 1-hour classes per day from Monday to Friday, which means he has 9 hours of class per week (3 x 1 hour). Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends a total of 9 x 16 = 144 hours in class per semester. However, since two of his days have 2-hour classes instead of 1-hour classes, he actually spends an additional 2 x 2 = 4 hours per week in those classes, bringing his total class time for the semester to 144 + 4 = 148 hours."
"Response: 4 days
Explanation: To calculate the length of time it would take for all the baked goods to be consumed if they are placed end to end, we need to know their total length.
The length of each roll of bagels is given as 15 cm, so there are 300 rolls in total with a length of 300 x 15 = 4500 cm.
Similarly, the length of each croissant is given as 20 cm, so there are 120 croissants in total with a length of 120 x 20 = 2400 cm.
Finally, the length of each baguette is given as 60 cm, so there are 60 baguettes in total with a length of 60 x 60 = 3600 cm.
Adding up these lengths gives us a total length of 4500 + 2400 + 3600 = 10500 cm.
Since Bill can produce 300 rolls, 120 croissants, and 60 baguettes per day, it will take him approximately 10500 / 300 = 35 days to produce enough baked goods to fill an unbroken line from one end to the other."

Explanation: If one action figure costs $5 and three action figures cost as much as a dollue doll, then each action figure costs $1.67 ($3 / 3). Since there are 3 action figuers in total, the total value of all action figures is $4.99 (3 x $1.67). Additionally, since there are 5 red cars and each car costs $4, the total value of all red cars is $20 (5 x $4). Therefore, the total value of all toys is $4.99 + $20 = $24.99."

Explanation: If one team runs their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds each, and the other team starts with their first runner running in 60 seconds, then the difference between the two teams' times will be 55 - 60 = -5 seconds per runner. Since there are four runners on each team, this means that the faster team will win by a total of 4 x (-5) = -20 seconds."
"Response: 49%
Explanation: To calculate the probability that Jerry will throw two or more consecutive numbers greater than 3, we can use the following formula: P(X > 3) = P(X > 3 | X > 2) \* P(X > 2) + P(X > 3 | X <= 2) \* P(X <= 2). Where X is the number thrown by Jerry and X > 2 represents throwing a number greater than 2. The first term in the equation calculates the probability of throwing a number greater than 3 after throwing a number greater than 2, while the second term calculates the probability of throwing a number greater than 3 after throwing a number equal to or less than 2. Using this formula, we get P(X > 3 | X > 2) = 1 - P(X > 3 | X <= 2) = 0.586, and P(X > 2) = 0.707. Therefore, P(X > 3) = 0.491, which means the probability that Jerry will throw two or more consecutive numbers greater than 3 is approximately 49%."

Explanation: To calculate the total amount of money that John earned in a year, we need to multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks he worked in a year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, and John works every week, the product of these two numbers is the total amount of money he earned in a year: $2000 x 52 = $104,000. Then, we subtract the one-time bonus of $5000 from this total to get the remaining amount: $104,000 - $5000 = $103,500. Finally, we divide this remaining amount by the percentage increase of 5% to find the new annual salary: $103,500 / 5% = $168749.33."

"Response: 0.576923076923077
Explanation: To calculate the probability of an randomly drawn card being water type, we need to use Bayes' theorem and update the prior probabilities based on the number of water cards that James has left after losing 8 of them.

Prior probabilities:
Water type = 40/100 = 0.4
Grass type = 30/100 = 0.3
Fire type = 30/100 = 0.3

Loss event: -8 water cards
New prior probabilities:
Water type = 40 - 8 = 32/100 = 0.32
Grass type = 30 + 14 = 44/100 = 0.44
Fire type = 30 = 0.3

Probability of draw being water type:
= P(water type | lost 8 water cards) \* P(lost 8 water cards) / P(draw)
= 0.32 \* 0.08 / 0.576923076923077

Therefore, the probability of an randomly drawn card being water type is approximately 0.576923076923077."

"Response: 12 hours
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, Kalinda can add 4 pieces to the puzzle per minute, and her mother can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we can use the following calculation:

Total number of pieces = Number of pieces added by Kalinda per minute x Total time taken to complete the puzzle
= 4 pieces/minute x (Number of minutes needed to complete the puzzle)

Since Kalinda alone can complete the puzzle in 1 hour (4 pieces/minute x 60 minutes/hour), and her mother can contribute half as many pieces per minute, it will take them a total of 2 hours to complete the puzzle (4 pieces/minute x 60 minutes/hour + 2 pieces/minute x 60 minutes/hour). Therefore, the answer is 12 hours."

* After two months, Ashlyn went to the farm and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, which is 36 watermelons (30% x 120 = 36).
* Two weeks later, when Ashlyn returned, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest, which is 48 watermelons (3/4 x 36 = 48).
* Therefore, there were 12 watermelons left that were not yet ready for harvest after two weeks (48 - 36 = 12)."

Explanation: To calculate the total cost of the fleet of cars, we need to consider three components: (1) the purchase price of each car, (2) sales tax or VAT, and (3) registration fees. Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate these amounts as follows:
Purchase price per car = 20,000 dollars x 12 cars = 240,000 dollars
Sales tax or VAT = 10% of 240,000 dollars = 24,000 dollars
Registration fee per car = 1,000 dollars x 12 cars = 12,000 dollars
Total cost of the fleet of cars = Purchase price + Sales tax + Registration fees = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 dollars
Therefore, Mark pays a total of 276,000 dollars for the fleet of 12 cars."

According to the problem statement, 30% of the students left through exit A, so the number of students who left through exit A is 30% of X = 300. Moreover, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, so the number of students who left through exit B is 3/5 \* (X - 300) = 140. Finally, the remaining students left through exit C, so the number of students who left through exit C is X - 300 - 140 = 267. Therefore, the answer is 267."

Jason has 1000 minutes of phone plan per month, which he uses for his daily calls with his boss and other people. He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, which is equal to 15 x 30 = 450 minutes. Additionally, he had 300 extra minutes of call time this month, which is equal to 300 / 30 = 10 minutes per day. Therefore, Jason has used up 450 + 10 = 460 minutes of his phone plan so far this month. Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason has 460 / 30 = 15.33 minutes left on his phone plan."
"Response: 8
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:
Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her pommes frites, which means she gave him 8 pommes frites (a ""handful"" is typically considered to be 5-6 items). So, after Ginger gave Griffin 8 pommes frites, he had 20 pommes frites left (24 - 8 = 20).
Then, Colby took 3 fewer than the number of pommes frites that Kyle took. Since Kyle took 5 pommes frites, Colby took 2 pommes frites (3 - 5 = -2).
So, at this point, Griffin had 18 pommes frites left (20 - 2 = 18).
Finally, Billy took double the number of pommes frites as Kyle. If Kyle took 5 pommes frites, then Billy took 10 pommes frites (double 5 = 10).
Therefore, after all these transactions, Griffin had 8 pommes frites left (18 - 10 = 8)."

Explanation: On Monday, Sue spitied twice as many cakes as her sister, which means she spitied 2 x 13 = 26 kager. Her sister spitied 5 kager on Monday and 13 kager on Tuesday, so in total she spitied 5 + 13 = 18 kager. Therefore, Sue spitied 26 - 18 = 9 more kager than her sister. Since each cake has 200 calories, this means that Sue consumed 9 x 200 = 1800 additional calories compared to her sister."
