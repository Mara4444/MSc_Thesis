"Response: 168 MB
Explanation:
Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute, which means she can download 2 x 40 = 80 GB in 40 minutes. Since the file is 200 GB, it will take her 5 times longer to download the entire file than it takes to download 80 GB, which is 40 minutes x 5 = 200 minutes or 3 hours and 20 minutes. Therefore, the amount of data required to complete the download is 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB."
"Response: 15 km

Solution:
Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, which means he traveled a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

* After driving for 3 hours, he realized something important and turned back, spending 2 hours in traffic. This means he traveled an additional distance of:

Additional Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

Total Distance = Additional Distance + Initial Distance = 120 miles + 180 miles = 290 miles

Since John spent half of his remaining time (which is 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph, we can calculate his total distance traveled during this period as follows:

Total Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 2 hours = 160 miles

Therefore, the total distance John traveled from his house to the point where he realized something important and turned back is:

Total Distance = Total Distance before turning back + Total Distance after turning back = 290 miles + 160 miles = 450 miles

Finally, since John took 4 hours to travel this distance, the distance between his house and the point where he realized something important and turned back is:

Distance = Total Distance / Time taken = 450 miles / 4 hours = 112.5 miles or 113 miles

So, the answer is 113 miles."

Solution:

Let the number of downloads in the first month be x. Since the number of downloads in the second month is three times that of the first month, we can write:

Number of downloads in the second month = 3x

Since the number of downloads in the third month is 2/3 of the number of downloads in the second month, we can write:

Number of downloads in the third month = 2/3 × 3x = 45x/3

Now, we are given that the total number of downloads in the three months is 180. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x + (45x/3) = 180

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7x + 45x/3 = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

9x/3 = 180

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

x = 21

Therefore, there were 21 downloads in the first month and 63 downloads in the second month (since 3x = 63). The total number of downloads over the three months was 180."

Solution:

Let's analyze the given information:

* The cost of planting one lemon tree is $90.
* Each year, Carlos will harvest 7 lemons that can be sold for $1.5 each.
* It costs him $3 per year to maintain and care for the tree.

To calculate how long it will take for Carlos to break even on his investment, we need to subtract the annual maintenance cost from the total revenue he will generate from selling the lemons. Let's do this:

Total revenue = Number of lemons x Selling price per lemon
= 7 x $1.5
= $10.50 per year

Annual maintenance cost = $3 per year

Time taken to break even = Total revenue / Annual maintenance cost
= $10.50 / $3
= 3.5 years

Since it takes more than 3 years for Carlos to break even on his investment, he will not be able to recover his initial cost of planting the lemon tree within that time frame. Therefore, the answer is 24 years."

Solution:
Let the number of times the alarm sounds be x.

From the problem statement, we know that:

1. The first time the alarm sounds, it sounds four times.
2. The second time the alarm sounds, it sounds three times more than the first time.
3. The third time the alarm sounds, it sounds half as many times as the second time.

So, we can write equations based on these statements:

x + 3 = 4 (first time)
2x + 3 = 6 (second time)
x/2 + 3 = 2 (third time)

Now, solve for x using substitution or elimination method.

For example, using substitution method:

x + 3 = 4... (1)
2x + 3 = 6... (2)
x/2 + 3 = 2... (3)

Substitute equation (1) into equation (2):

2(x + 3) = 6

Expand and simplify:

2x + 6 = 6

Subtract 6 from both sides:

2x = -2

Divide both sides by 2:

x = -1

Therefore, the answer is x = -1."

Let the number of times the fourth friend presses the door be x.
Since the first friend pressed the door 20 times before Jerome opened it, the total number of times the first friend pressed the door is 20 + 4 = 24.
The second friend pressed the door 1/4 as many times as the first friend, so the total number of times the second friend pressed the door is 24 / 4 = 6.
The third friend pressed the door 10 times more than the second friend, so the total number of times the third friend pressed the door is 6 + 10 = 16.
Therefore, the total number of times all four friends pressed the door is 24 + 6 + 16 = 46.
If the fourth friend pressed the door 60 times, then the total number of times all four friends pressed the door is 46 x 60 = 2760."

Solution:

Lucas has started his own home cleaning business and is expecting to make $92 in profit each week. He currently has 3 customers and is confident that he can add 5 more potential customers to his list. Each customer will require 2 bottles of cleaner and one roll of cloth for cleaning. The cost of each bottle of cleaner is $2, and the cost of each roll of cloth is $5. Therefore, Lucas's total expenses each week will be:

Total expenses = Number of customers x Cost of cleaner per customer x Number of customers using cleaner + Number of customers x Cost of cloth per customer x Number of customers using cloth
= 3 x $2 x 3 + 3 x $5 x 3
= $108 + $15
= $123

So, Lucas's profit each week is:
Profit = Total revenue - Total expenses
= $92 - $123
= -$31

Therefore, Lucas will not make any profit each week."

Solution:
Let's first calculate the total length of all the bread items:

* Keropok coklat: 120 x 6 = 720 inches (or 57 feet)
* Baguette: 60 x 2 = 120 inches (or 9 feet)

Total length of all bread items = 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches (or 168 feet)

Now, let's assume that Bill places them end to end without any gaps. The distance between each item will be equal to their length. Therefore, the distance between the last roti and the first baguette is:

Distance = Total length of all bread items - Length of baguette
= 2040 - 120
= 1920 inches (or 157 feet)

So, it will take Bill 5 minutes to place all the bread items end to end without any gaps."
"Response: 3600 pisang.

Solution:
To determine the total number of bananas that need to be purchased for the duration of 2 months, we need to calculate the average monthly consumption of each species and multiply it by the number of months.

Average monthly consumption = Total consumption / Number of months

For monkeys (Monyet): 200 pisang/month x 2 months = 400 pisang
For gorillas (Gorila): 400 pisang/month x 2 months = 800 pisang
For orangs (Babun): 100 pisang/month x 2 months = 200 pisang
Total average monthly consumption = 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 pisang/month

Therefore, the total number of bananas needed for the duration of 2 months is:
Total number of bananas = Average monthly consumption x Number of months = 1400 pisang/month x 2 months = 2800 pisang

So, the answer is 2800 bananas."

Solution:

Let the number of women in the Chinese army be x.
Since there are 240 men in the Asian group and 80 men in the Japanese group, the total number of men is 320.
So, the ratio of men to women in the Chinese army is:
Men : Women = 60 : x

Now, we know that the total number of people in the Chinese army is 60 + x.
From the question, we also know that the total number of people in the other two groups (Asian and Japanese) is 320.
Therefore, the total number of people in all three groups is:
Total = 60 + x + 320 = 480

Now, we can find out the value of x by dividing the total number of people in the Chinese army by the ratio of men to women:
x = Total / (Men : Women) = 480 / (60 : x) = 140

Therefore, there are 140 women in the Chinese army."

* Setiap pasukan memiliki 4 ahli yang berlari 400 meter.
* Waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk menjalankan 400 meter oleh setiap ahli dalam satu pasukan sama.
* Pasukan yang lebih baik memiliki waktu yang lebih cepat dalam menjalankan 400 meter.
* Waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk menjalankan 400 meter oleh setiap ahli dalam pasukan yang lebih baik lebih cepat dari waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk menjalankan 400 meter oleh setiap ahli dalam pasukan yang kurang baik.

Maka, untuk menentukan waktu yang dibutuhkan oleh pasukan yang lebih cepat untuk menjalankan 400 meter, kita perlu menghitung waktu yang dibutuhkan oleh setiap ahli dalam pasukan tersebut dan kemudian menggabungkan waktu tersebut.

Waktu yang dibutuhkan oleh setiap ahli dalam pasukan yang lebih baik dapat dinyatakan sebagai:

Explanation:
From the question, we know that there are 18 flamingos plastic red beaks placed outside Sue's house on Friday morning. Then, on Saturday morning, the clowns took back one third of them and painted them white. They then returned these white flamingos to the original location outside Sue's house. Finally, on Monday morning, they added another 18 plastic red beaked flamingos to the collection. Therefore, the total number of flamingos plastic red beaks outside Sue's house at noon on Monday is:
18 + (1/3) x 18 = 42
So, there are 42 flamingos plastic red beaks outside Sue's house at noon on Monday."

Solution:
Let's assume that John worked for X number of weeks in a year. He won the award at the beginning of the year and received a bonus of $5000 and a salary increase of 5% every week.

The total amount of money John earned in a year can be calculated as follows:

Total amount = Number of weeks worked x Weekly earnings + Bonus
= X x ($5000 + 5% of weekly earnings)

Since John worked for 2000 weeks in a year, his total annual income can be calculated as follows:

Total amount = 2000 x ($5000 + 5% of $5000)
= 2000 x $5500 + $1000
= $110,000

Therefore, John earned $110,000 in a year."

Let the number of green pens be x. Since there are 22 green pens initially, we have x = 22.

Janet buys 6 blue pens and each pack contains 9 pens, so the total number of blue pens she buys is 6 x 9 = 54.

Since there are already 22 green pens, the total number of pens Janet has now is 22 + 54 = 76.

Therefore, the answer is 76."

Solution:
Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 4 packs of cigarettes. On Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought three times the amount of cigarettes she bought on Monday. On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times the amount of cigarettes she bought on Tuesday.

So, if we let x be the number of packs of cigarettes Rose bought on Monday, then we can write the equation based on the information given:

x + 3x = 5x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x = 20

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 5

Therefore, Rose bought 5 packs of cigarettes after three days."

"Response:  Sara harus memotong rumput 8 kali sebelum dia mampu jaket dan kasut.

Reasoning:
Sara has $10 before she starts taking care of the children, and she gets $5 for each time she takes care of them. Therefore, after one time taking care of the children, she will have $10 + $5 = $15. After two times taking care of the children, she will have $15 + $5 = $20. And so on...

So, if Sara needs to buy a jacket that costs $30 and 2 pairs of pants that cost $20 each, she will need to take care of the children for a total of:
$30 + ($2 x $20) = $70
times, which is equal to 8 times (since $70 / $5 = 8).
Therefore, Sara must cut grass 8 times before she can afford the jacket and pants."
"Response: 18

Solution:
Let the number of red chickens be x. Since each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by the white chickens is 5(number of white chickens).

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, the total number of eggs collected must be equal to the sum of the eggs laid by both types of chickens:

3x + 5(number of white chickens) = 42

Now, we are given that Jerry has more than two white chickens for every red chicken he has. Let the number of white chickens be n, then the number of red chickens is x/n. Substituting this value in the previous equation, we get:

3x/n + 5n = 42

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

x = 18

Therefore, there are 18 red chickens in Jerry's farm."

"Response: 8 galon
Explanation:
Let the volume of water in the small pool be x gallons. Since the large pool empties into both pools at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the volume of water in the large pool after 4 minutes is 2x gallons (since there are now two times as much water in the large pool). Therefore, the total volume of water in both pools after 4 minutes is 2x + x = 3x gallons.
Since the small pool had twice as much water as the large pool initially, and the large pool gained an additional 2x gallons of water during the 4 minutes, the final volume of water in the small pool is 2x - 3x = -1x gallons.
Therefore, the answer is 8 gallons."

Solution:
Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes worth $320 and a belt that costs $32. She works for half a day ($8) every day. To find out how many days she needs to work before she can afford the purchase, we need to divide the total cost of the items by her daily earnings:

Total cost = $320 + $32 = $352
Daily earnings = $8
Number of days needed to work = Total cost / Daily earnings
= $352 / $8
= 45 days

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 45 days before she can afford to buy the shoes and the belt."
