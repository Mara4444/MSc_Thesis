To calculate the number of dollars she earns daily from selling eggs and chickens in the market, we need to know the following information:

* Number of eggs sold per day = 16 eggs x 3 days = 48 eggs
* Price per egg = $2
* Number of chickens sold per day = 4 chickens x 3 days = 12 chickens
* Price per chicken = $50

Total daily income from eggs = 48 eggs x $2 = $96
Total daily income from chickens = 12 chickens x $50 = $600
Total daily income = $96 + $600 = $704

Therefore, Batat earns $704 per day from selling eggs and chickens in the market."

$150 + $400 = $550

So, Bilal sells $550 worth of shoes on Tuesday."

* Some snacks (let's assume an average price of 2 dollars per snack)

Total cost = 12 + 15 + 6 + (2 x number of snacks)

Since Mary bought 5 loaves of bread and 4 packs of butter, the total cost is:

Total cost = 12 + 15 + 6 + (2 x 5) = 12 + 15 + 6 + 10 = 33 dollars

Therefore, Mary paid 33 dollars for her order."

To determine how many grams of rice you can eat based on your daily calorie needs and the price per kilogram of rice, we need to calculate the cost of 300 grams of rice.

First, let's convert the weight from grams to kilograms:

300 g = 0.3 kg

Now, we know that the price per kilogram is 250 Saudi riyals (SR):

0.3 kg x 250 SR/kg = 75 SR

So, the cost of 300 grams of rice is 75 Saudi riyals.

To determine how much rice you can eat based on your daily calorie needs, we need to divide the cost by the number of calories in 300 grams of rice:

75 SR / (2000 - 1800) calories = approximately 46-47 grams of rice

Therefore, based on your daily calorie needs and the price per kilogram of rice, you can eat approximately 46-47 grams of rice."

"Response:  To calculate the total amount of money earned by the dance teacher in one week, we need to multiply the number of classes taught per day by the number of students in each class and then multiply that result by the tuition fee per student.

Let's assume there are 5 days in a week and the dance teacher teaches 3 classes per day, with 5 students in each class.

Number of classes taught per day = 3
Number of students in each class = 5
Total number of students per day = 3 x 5 = 15

Since there are 5 days in a week, the total number of students for the week is:
Total number of students for the week = 15 x 5 = 75

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money earned by the dance teacher for the week:
Tuition fee per student = $15
Total amount of money earned per student = $15 x 75 = $1,125

Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the dance teacher for the week is:
Total amount of money earned for the week = 75 x $1,125 = $84,375"

"Response: 
To calculate the total cost of the order, we need to multiply each item by its quantity and then add up all the costs. We also need to consider the additional 20% service charge that is added to the total cost at the time of delivery.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

* 2 x 7.50 = 15.00 (for 2 bottles of water)
* 2 x 1.50 = 3.00 (for 2 boxes of raisins)
* 2 x 1.00 = 2.00 (for 2 bags of coffee)

Total cost without service charge: 15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00

Now, we need to calculate the service charge. The service charge is 20% of the total cost, so we can calculate it as follows:

Service charge = 20% x 20.00 = 4.00

Therefore, the total cost with service charge is:

Total cost = 20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00

So, the total cost of the order, including the service charge, would be $24.00."
"Response: 
Let's denote the number of questions Mark completed in the first exam as x and the number of questions he completed in the second exam as y. We know that x + y = 75 (total number of questions).
Since Mark spent 8 hours completing the first exam and 6 hours completing the second exam, we can write:
x/8 + y/6 = 1 (Mark spent all his time either taking the exams or sleeping)
Now we have two equations and two variables. Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 30 (Mark completed 30 questions in the first exam)
y = 45 (Mark completed 45 questions in the second exam)
Therefore, Mark left 25 questions unanswered in the first exam (75 - 30 = 25) and 55 questions unanswered in the second exam (100 - 45 = 55)."

= 700 x 50,000
= 35,000,000
Therefore, there are approximately 35 million working bees in this area."

$3 x 1.1 = $3.30 (for the rice)
$3 x 1.1 = $3.30 (for the lentils)
$4 x 1.1 = $4.40 (for the spices)

Total cost with 10% tax added:

$2.20 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $17.50

Therefore, the total cost with 10% tax added would be $17.50."
"Response: 
To calculate the amount of money that Lukas will earn per week from his cleaning business, we need to subtract the total expenses (cost of materials and equipment) from the total revenue (income from clients).

Total Revenue = Number of clients x Price per client
= 3 clients x $100 per client
= $300 per week

Total Expenses = Cost of materials x Quantity used
+ Equipment cost
= $2 x 2 bags of cement + $5 x 1 bag of cement
= $4 + $5
= $9

Therefore, the amount of money that Lukas will earn per week is:

Total Revenue - Total Expenses
= $300 - $9
= $291

So, Lukas will earn $291 per week from his cleaning business."

"Response: 5

Explanation:

1. The first part of the question states that Dave bought 8 packets of crisps and ate half of them before the snack was stolen by the thief.
2. Since Dave ate half of the crisps, he had 8 - 4 = 4 packets left.
3. The second part of the question states that three hamsters ate three packets each, so they ate a total of 3 x 3 = 9 packets of crisps.
4. Therefore, the number of packets of crisps left after the hamsters finished eating is 4 - 9 = -5.
5. However, since negative numbers cannot be used as answers, we round up to the nearest positive integer, which is 5."

For Lukas's team:

* 5 heavyweight fish x 2 kg/fish = 10 kg
* 3 medium-weight fish x 1.5 kg/fish = 4.5 kg
* 2 lightweight fish x 1 kg/fish = 2 kg

Total weight of fish caught by Lukas's team = 10 + 4.5 + 2 = 16.5 kg

The fastest team will complete the race in 3 minutes and 20 seconds (3:20). Here's how we arrived at this answer:

1. The first team member completes the 400-meter distance in 55 seconds.
2. The second team member takes 60 seconds to cover the same distance.
3. The third team member completes the distance in 30 seconds less than the previous team member (i.e., 60 - 30 = 30 seconds).
4. Therefore, the total time taken by all three team members is: 55 + 60 + 30 = 145 seconds.
5. Since each team member covers 400 meters, the total distance covered by the team is 400 x 3 = 1200 meters.
6. To calculate the time taken for the entire race, we divide the total distance by the speed of the slowest team member (60 seconds per 400 meters): 1200 / 60 = 3:20."

"Response:  To calculate how much Mark will pay for each car and the total amount he will pay, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of each car by multiplying the number of cars by the price per car.

12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000

Step 2: Calculate the tax on each car by multiplying the cost of each car by the tax rate (10%).

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

Step 3: Add the tax to the cost of each car to get the total cost of each car.

$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

So, the total cost of 12 cars is $264,000.

To register each car, Mark needs to pay an additional $1,000, so the total amount he will pay for all 12 cars is:

$264,000 + 12 x $1,000 = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000"

If Jesson has 1000 minutes this month and each day he talks to the president for 15 minutes, then he will have 67 minutes left over at the end of the month if there are 30 days in the month. To calculate this, we can use the following formula:

Total minutes available = Total number of minutes / Number of days in the month

In this case, the total number of minutes is 1000, and the number of days in the month is 30, so we can plug these values into the formula like this:

Total minutes available = 1000 / 30

This gives us a result of 33.33, which means that Jesson will have 33 minutes and 20 seconds left over at the end of the month if he uses all of his time talking to the president and other people as described in the problem statement."
