Explanation:
In the morning, Windy eats three meals of 15 cups of food each, for a total of 45 cups of food consumed. After noon, she eats an additional 25 cups of food, bringing the total to 70 cups of food consumed. To determine how many cups of food Windy needs in the final meal of the day if her stomach capacity is 20 torrents, we need to subtract the amount of food she has already consumed from her total stomach capacity, which leaves us with 50 cups of food remaining that she can eat in the final meal. Therefore, Windy needs 50 / 3 = 16.67 cups of food in her final meal of the day."

Explanation:
To calculate how much Killer needs to pay for the 16 boxes of paint, we need to use the price list provided in the question. The first box costs $5, and each subsequent box costs 60% of the previous box's price. Therefore, the cost of 16 boxes of paint can be calculated as follows:

Box 1: $5
Boxes 2-4: ($5 x 4) = $20
Boxes 5-8: ($20 x 2) = $40
Boxes 9-12: ($40 x 3) = $120
Boxes 13-16: ($120 x 2) = $240

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:

Gilim (age) of Darl and Elon are in a relationship for 7 years. If their combined age is currently 162, calculate Elon's age after an additional 10 years have passed since now.

To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between Darl's current age and Elon's current age, and then add that amount to Elon's current age. Since we know that their combined age is 162, we can deduce that Darl's current age is 7 times greater than Elon's current age. Therefore, if Elon's current age is x, Darl's current age is 7x.

After an additional 10 years have passed, Elon's age will increase by 10 years, so his new age will be x + 10. To find Darl's new age, we simply multiply Elon's new age by 7. Therefore, Darl's new age is 7(x + 10).

So, Elon's age after an additional 10 years is 184."

* Set A has 12 coins that are less than an arnon (a unit of currency).
* Set B has 5 coins that are more than an arnon.
Since an arnon is equal to 40 shekels, we can calculate the total number of coins as follows:
Total number of coins = Number of coins in Set A + Number of coins in Set B
= 12 + 5
= 17
Therefore, there are 17 coins in the solution."

Explanation:
The information provided in the question can be summarized as follows:

* The age of Brandan is four times that of Ben.
* The age of Ben is twice that of Sozi.
* If Sozi's age is 16 years, how old is Ben according to Brandan's ratio?

Using the ratios given in the question, we can calculate the ages of each person as follows:

* Brandan's age = 4 x Ben's age
* Ben's age = 2 x Sozi's age
* Sozi's age = 16 years

Substituting these values into the first equation, we get:

Brandan's age = 4 x (2 x Sozi's age)
= 4 x 2 x 16
= 120 years

Therefore, if Sozi's age is 16 years, then Ben's age according to Brandan's ratio is 120 years."
"Response: 350 meters.
Explanation: According to the question, when Poli pushed the heavy stone, he could throw it 400 paces (or 400 x 100 = 40,000 cm) away from the mountain peak. However, since the stone was not thrown directly upwards but at an angle of about 30 degrees relative to the horizontal, its maximum height above the ground would be approximately half that distance, or 20,000 cm (40,000 / 2). Therefore, if Poli had thrown the stone with all his might and managed to reach a height of 350 meters (which is roughly half the distance between the base of the mountain and the top), then it would have fallen back down to the ground after 20,000 cm, which is equivalent to about 67 seconds of flight time."

For the second year, if the company owes her 10% of the second year's income, then the amount she will receive is $132.93 ($140 - $7.07), since the second year's income is $140 minus the $7.07 already paid in the first year.
Therefore, the total amount she will receive for both years of service is $286.57 ($154 + $132.93)."

To calculate Shilah's total cost for purchasing five solar phones at $150 each, we need to multiply the number of phones by their individual price. Therefore, the total cost is:

$150 x 5 = $750

Since Shilah received a discount of 2%, we can subtract that amount from the total cost to get the net cost:

$750 - (2% x $750) = $750 - $15 = $735

Therefore, Shilah paid $735 for five solar phones."

Explanation:
To calculate the cost of food for Sassy's dog in the first year, we need to multiply the number of cups of food she needs per day by the number of days in a year. Since Sassy needs to feed her dog 1 cup of food every 18 hours, and there are 365 days in a year, the total amount of food she will need is:

1 cup/day x 365 days = 365 cups/year

Since each can of food contains 110 cups of food, the total cost of food for Sassy's dog in the first year is:

$365 cups/year x $2.50/can = $862.50
Therefore, the cost of food for Sassy's dog in the first year is approximately $862.50."

Response:  To calculate how much silver he will save by buying 18 roses at a better price of $3 per rose or $2 per rose, we need to know the weight of one rose in grams. Let's assume that one rose weighs approximately 0.5 grams (this is a rough estimate). Now, let's do the calculation: If he buys 18 roses at $3 each, he will pay a total of: 18 x $3 = $54 If he buys 18 roses at $2 each, he will pay a total of: 18 x $2 = $36 So, by buying the roses at the better price, he will save: $54 - $36 = $18 In terms of silver, this means that for every $1 he spends on roses, he will get: $1 / $0.05 = 20 grams of silver back. Therefore, if he buys 18 roses, he will get: 18 x 20 grams = 360 grams of silver back.

Explanation:
The company pays a salary of $600 to each employee every month. For the company, there are taxes of -10% of the first $500 of each employee's salary in each year over five years. If Silya only worked for five months in December of the previous year, what is her annual bonus after three additional years of service?
Solution:
To calculate Silya's annual bonus, we need to consider two factors: her total working time and her average salary during that time. Based on the information provided, Silya worked for five months in December of the previous year, which means she had a total working time of 5/12 = 0.417 (or approximately 41.7%) of a year.
Assuming an average monthly salary of $600, Silya's total annual salary would be:
$600 x 12 = $7,200
Now, let's apply the -10% tax rate to her annual salary:
($7,200 x -10%) = -$720
So, Silya's annual bonus after three additional years of service would be:
$7,200 + (-$720) = $6,480"

Solution:
To determine how many pages Solly needs to read in one day, we need to calculate the total number of pages he needs to read and then divide it by the number of days he has available.

Total pages needed = 4 pages from his science book + 20 pages from his textbook + 7 pages from his history book + 8 pages from his geography book = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages

Since Solly has 4 days available, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he has available:
49 pages / 4 days = 12.25 pages per day (or approximately 13 pages)

Therefore, Solly needs to read approximately 13 pages per day for the next 4 days to complete all the reading assigned to him."

Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, Adrian's commission for selling a villa was 30% of the sale price. Four years later, his commission increased by 40%, meaning he earned 40% more than what he previously earned. If Adrian sold the villa for $40,000 four years ago and earned a commission of $12,000 (30% of $40,000), then his total earnings from that sale would be $52,000 ($40,000 + $12,000). Therefore, if we assume that Adrian received an additional $40,000 in commissions over the past four years, his total earnings from both sales would be $92,000 ($52,000 + $40,000)."

Response: 34.98 dollars. Explanation: To calculate the total cost of the shipment, we need to add up all the costs: • The first sausage costs $7.50 per unit, so 2 units x $7.50 = $15.00 • Each cheese costs $1.50, so 2 pieces x $1.50 = $3.00 • Each egg costs $1.00, so 2 eggs x $1.00 = $2.00 Total cost of the shipment = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 However, there is an additional 20% shipping fee added by the courier service, which is $4.00 (20% of $20.00). So, the final total cost of the shipment is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Explanation:

The problem states that Carl has 12 eggs in his basket and each egg weighs 0.10 dollars. If he sells them all for 10 dollars, how much money will he get? To find out, we need to calculate the total weight of the eggs in pounds (since the problem doesn't give us the weight in kilograms). There are 16 ounces in a pound, so there are 12 x 16 = 192 ounces in Carl's basket of eggs. Since each egg weighs 0.10 dollars, the total weight of the eggs is 192 ounces x 0.10 dollars/ounce = 19.20 dollars. Therefore, if Carl sells all his eggs for 10 dollars, he will get 19.20 - 10 = 9.20 dollars."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Sandra ordered 480 flowers and paid for them upfront. She also requested that they be delivered within five hours of placing the order, which is equivalent to 3 PM. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the time frame as follows:

3 PM = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes
To ensure that the flowers arrive on time, it's necessary to deliver at least 5 flowers every 15 minutes (or 90 seconds). Therefore, the number of flowers that must be delivered within the given time frame is:

180 minutes / 15 minutes per flower = 12 flowers
Since each bouquet contains 8-10 stems, the total number of bouquets that must be delivered is:

12 flowers / 8-10 stems per bouquet = 176 bouquets"

The Geri Meggel has 6 sides and can roll a number greater than 3. To calculate the maximum number of combinations, we need to find out how many ways he can roll two pairs of numbers that add up to 7 or more. There are 6 possible values for each side of the die, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible combinations for rolling one pair of numbers. Since Geri can roll two pairs, there are 36 x 2 = 72 total combinations. However, since two of those combinations (rolling a 4 and a 3, or a 5 and a 2) would not satisfy the condition of adding up to 7 or more, there are actually only 70 unique combinations."

* Since there are 20 hat segments left over after making kites for the chamsters, each segment can be used to make 1/20 = 0.05 kite. Therefore, the total number of kites that can be made from the hat segments is 0.05 x 20 = 1 kite.
* There are no other materials in the shop that can be used to make kites, so the total number of kites that can be made is 50 + 1 = 51 kites."

Explanation:
The larger reservoir (A) has water that is 4 times deeper than the smaller reservoir (B). In 4 minutes, the level of water in the larger reservoir will rise by 16 cm (since it is 4 times deeper), while the level of water in the smaller reservoir will rise by 4 cm (since it is only twice as deep as the larger reservoir). Therefore, after 4 minutes, there will be 4 x 3 = 12 cubic centimeters more water in the larger reservoir than in the smaller reservoir. Since there are 100 cubic centimeters in a liter, this means that there will be 12 / 100 = 0.12 liters (or 30 milliliters) more water in the smaller reservoir after 4 minutes."

Remaining Balance = $2000 - ($165 x 12) = $2347.89

So, the remaining balance of Genie's loan after 12 months would be $2347.89."

Response:  If there were 50 seeds in each pouch and they were placed in a gynaecological speculum for examination, then the number of seedlings that could be seen would depend on various factors such as the size of the pouches, the shape and size of the seeds, and the angle at which the light is reflected off the seeds. However, assuming an average size of about 1 cm for the seeds and pouches, we can estimate that around 2-3 seedlings might be visible per pouch under ideal conditions. Therefore, if there were 50 seeds in each pouch, we could expect to see around 100-150 seedlings (2-3 x 50) after placing them in the speculum.
