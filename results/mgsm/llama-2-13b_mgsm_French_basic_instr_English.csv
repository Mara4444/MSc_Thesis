"Response: 

To find out how much money Janet makes each day at the farmer's market, we need to subtract the number of eggs she eats and uses for baking from the total number of eggs her ducks lay per day. Let's do that:

Total eggs laid per day = 16 eggs
Eggs eaten for breakfast = 3 eggs
Eggs used for baking = 4 eggs

Now let's calculate the remaining eggs:

Remaining eggs = Total eggs laid per day - Eggs eaten for breakfast - Eggs used for baking
= 16 - 3 - 4
= 9 eggs

Since each egg sells for $2, the amount of money Janet makes each day at the farmer's market is:

Daily income = Number of remaining eggs x Price per egg
= 9 x $2
= $18

So, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmer's market."

To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of items by their respective prices. Let's do this for each type of pastry:

* Beignets (3 douzaines x 12 pieces/douzaine x $68/douzaine) = $2,448
* Petits gâteaux (2 douzaines x 12 pieces/douzaine x $80/douzaine) = $1,600
* Petits gâteaux au fromage (6 douzaines x 12 pieces/douzaine x $55/douzaine) = $1,320

Adding these amounts gives us the total cost:
$2,448 + $1,600 + $1,320 = $5,368

Therefore, the total cost is $5,368."
"Response: 6 years.
Explanation: The cost of planting the lemon tree is $90, and each year it produces 7 lemons that are sold for $1.50 each, so the total revenue per year is $10.50 ($1.50 x 7). Subtracting the annual maintenance costs of $3, the net profit per year is $7.50. To break even, Carlos needs to earn enough money to cover the initial investment of $90. Therefore, he will need to sell lemons for 6 years (90 / 7.50 = 6) before starting to make a profit."

The value of the jewelry at the end of the month would be:

5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = 5,000 x 1.025 = 5,125

And the value of the electronics at the end of the month would be:

8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = 8,000 x 1.012 = 8,096

So, if the merchant chooses to buy the jewelry, their profit at the end of the month would be:

5,125 - 8,096 = -2,971

If they choose to buy the electronics, their profit at the end of the month would be:

To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice after 60 days, we need to calculate the total cost of all the ice she will buy during that period. Since she buys 15 portions of ice each day and there are 30 days in April, she will buy a total of:

15 x 30 = 450 portions of ice

Since each carton contains 15 portions of ice, she will need:

450 / 15 = 30 cartons

Therefore, Cynthia will spend:

30 x 4.00 = 120.00 $

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent 120.00 $ on ice."

Let's denote the number of candies in the bowl as x.

The first friend estimates 80 candies.
The second friend estimates 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate, which is:

20 + (half of 80) = 20 + 40 = 60

The third friend estimates 25% more than the first friend's estimate, which is:

25% of 80 = 20

So, the three friends' estimates are:

80, 60, and 20

To find the average of these estimates, we add them up and divide by 3:

(80 + 60 + 20) / 3 = (160 + 60 + 20) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

Therefore, the average of the friends' estimates is 80."

"Response: 12 km/h.
Explanation: Let's break down the information we have:

* Jean runs 60 miles each week (which is equal to 96 kilometers).
* He runs 3 days per week.
* On the first day, he runs for 3 hours and then runs twice as long on the remaining two days.

We can start by finding out how far Jean runs on each of the three days:

Day 1: 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes
Day 2 and 3: 2 times longer than Day 1 = 360 minutes

Total distance run per week: 180 + 360 = 540 minutes

Now, let's convert the total distance from minutes to kilometers:

540 minutes / 60 minutes/km = 9 km/day

Since Jean runs 3 days per week, his total weekly distance is:

9 km/day x 3 days = 27 km

So, Jean runs 27 kilometers per week. To find his speed, we need to divide the distance by the time it takes him to cover that distance:

27 km / 3 hours = 9 km/h

Therefore, Jean's speed is 9 kilometers per hour."

To determine how many grams of chips you will eat to reach your daily calorie goal of 2000 while already having consumed 1800 calories, we need to calculate the number of chips you can have based on the information provided.

First, let's convert the weight of the bag from grams to kilograms:

300g = 0.3kg

Next, we know that each serving size is 250 calories and there are 5 servings in the bag:

Total calories per bag = 5 x 250 = 1250 calories

Now, we subtract the calories you have already consumed (1800) from the total calories in the bag (1250):

Remaining calories per bag = 1250 - 1800 = -550 calories

Since negative calories do not exist, we cannot consume any more chips without exceeding our daily calorie goal. Therefore, the answer is:

Number of grams of chips to be eaten = 0 grams"

So, if we divide 30 (the number of lollipops Jean has left) by 2 (the number of lollipops in each bag), we get:

30 ÷ 2 = 15

So, Jean can make 15 bags of 2 lollipops each."

To find out how much money Artie will make, we need to calculate the total amount of money he will receive from selling all his flowers. We can do this by adding up the prices of each type of flower that he is selling.

Explanation: Let X be the number of matches won by the team. Since the team has played 22 matches, we know that X + L = 22, where L is the number of losses (0 since they have not lost any matches). We are given that the team has won ""X times more than it has lost"", so we can write:

X + L = 22... (1)

Since the team has won 22 - L matches, we can write:

X + L = 22... (2)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

X + L = 22... (3)

Solving for X, we get:

X = 14... (4)

Therefore, the team has won 14 matches and lost none."

To find out how many rolls each person has eaten on average, we need to divide the total number of rolls they have eaten by the number of rolls they had in the first place. Let's do this for both Marcell and Béatrice:

For Marcell:
Total number of rolls eaten = 3 large rolls + 14 small rolls = 17 rolls
Number of rolls initially possessed = 3 large rolls + 14 small rolls = 17 rolls
Average number of rolls eaten = Total number of rolls eaten / Number of rolls initially possessed = 17 / 17 = 1

For Béatrice:
Total number of rolls eaten = 2 large rolls + 24 small rolls = 26 rolls
Number of rolls initially possessed = 2 large rolls + 24 small rolls = 26 rolls
Average number of rolls eaten = Total number of rolls eaten / Number of rolls initially possessed = 26 / 26 = 1

So, both Marcell and Béatrice have eaten an average of one roll each."

$20.00 x 20% = $4.00

Total cost of order with delivery = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Therefore, the cost of Rory's order with delivery will be $24.00."

Response:  If Jordan spent his 2 hours of gaming time working instead, he would earn an additional $20 per week ($10/hour x 2 hours). Therefore, in one week, Jordan would earn a total of $30 (his original $10/hour x 40 hours + $20 for the 2 hours he spent working).
"Response: 

To find out how much everything has cost, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Jean spent on all the items she purchased. We can do this by adding up the prices of each item:

$2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (rat traps) = $15

So, everything has cost Jean a total of $15."

"Response: 
Let x be the number of pieces in the first Lego set that Johnny picked up. Since he has picked it up, there are no more pieces left in the set. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
x + 3x = 500 + 3(500) = 500 + 1500 = 2000
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
4x = 2000
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
x = 500
So, Johnny picked up 500 pieces from the first Lego set.
Now, let y be the number of pieces in the second Lego set that Johnny picked up. We know that there are 3 times as many pieces in this set as there were in the first set, so we can write:
y = 3x = 3(500) = 1500
Therefore, Johnny picked up 1500 pieces from the second Lego set.
Finally, let z be the number of pieces in the third Lego set that Johnny picked up. We know that there is one quarter as many pieces in this set as there were in the second set, so we can write:
z = 1/4(1500) = 375
Therefore, Johnny picked up 375 pieces from the third Lego set.
In total, Johnny picked up:
500 + 1500 + 375 = 2475
pieces."

In two years, both Brooke and Seth will be x+2 years old.
According to the problem, the sum of their ages in two years will be 28. So we can set up the equation:
x + 2x = 28...
Simplifying the equation:
3x = 28...
Dividing by 3:
x = 9
So Brooke is currently 9 years old, and Seth is 18 years old (2 times 9)."

"Response: 
To calculate how much Jessica must pay each month to cover all her debts and pay 50% more than the minimum payment, we need to first determine the total amount she owes for each debt.

For the student loan:
Minimum payment per month = $300
Total amount owed = $18,000 (since it is a 60-month loan at 6% interest)

For the credit card:
Minimum payment per month = $200
Total amount owed = $4,000 (since it has a balance of $4,000)

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment per month = $500
Total amount owed = $120,000 (since it is a 30-year mortgage at 4% interest)

Now, let's calculate the total amount Jessica needs to pay each month to cover all her debts and pay 50% more than the minimum payment:

Total monthly payment = Minimum payment + (50% of the minimum payment)

For the student loan:
Total monthly payment = $300 + ($300 x 0.5) = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Total monthly payment = $200 + ($200 x 0.5) = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Total monthly payment = $500 + ($500 x 0.5) = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's calculate how much Jessica will pay in one year if she pays these amounts every month:

Yearly payment for student loan = 12 x $450 = $5,400
Yearly payment for credit card = 12 x $300 = $3,600
Yearly payment for mortgage = 12 x $750 = $9,000

Therefore, Jessica will pay a total of $5,400 + $3,600 + $9,"

To calculate the amount that Mandy must give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to use the formula for compound interest:

A = P x (1 + r/n)^(n\*t)

where:
A = the final amount (the amount Mandy must pay to Benedict)
P = the principal amount (the initial debt of $100)
r = the monthly interest rate (2% per month)
n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year (12 times, since there are 12 months in a year)
t = the time period (in this case, 3 months)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = $100 x (1 + 0.02/12)^(12\*3)
= $100 x 1.02^36
= $100 x 1.02^3
= $104.08

Therefore, Mandy must give $104.08 to Benedict after 3 months to settle her debt."

To calculate how much Jean has earned this year, we need to first calculate his weekly earnings for each of the 52 weeks in the year (since he receives the prize at the beginning of the year). Then, we can add up all these weekly earnings to find out how much he has earned overall.

Weekly earnings = $2,000/week (before receiving the prize) + ($2,000 x 1.05) = $2,000/week + $10,900 = $12,900/week

Total earnings for the year = $12,900/week x 52 weeks = $683,800

Therefore, Jean has earned $683,800 this year."

To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of tons of grapes produced by the number of barrels per ton.

Explanation:
Sarah has $10 in savings before starting to babysit.
She earns $5 each time she mows the lawn (4 times).
Total amount earned = 4 x $5 = $20
Cost of veste = $30
Cost of 2 pairs of shoes = 2 x $20 = $40
Total cost = $30 + $40 = $70
Since Sarah has already saved $10, she needs to earn an additional $60 ($70 - $10) to buy the vest and shoes.
Therefore, she must mow the lawn 8 times ($60 / $5 per mowing = 8 times)."

Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking around the park, we can divide the distance of the park by his walking speed:

Distance = Length x Width

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 9 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 3 hours

To find out how much money will be left with Janeth by the end of the 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will have paid over that period. We can do this by multiplying the monthly payment of $165 by the number of months (12):

Total amount paid = Monthly payment x Number of months
= $165 x 12
= $1980

So, at the end of the 12 months, Janeth will have paid a total of $1980. To find out how much money will be left with her, we subtract the total amount paid from the original amount borrowed:

Amount left with Janeth = Original amount borrowed - Total amount paid
= $2000 - $1980
= $20

Therefore, there will be $20 left with Janeth at the end of the 12 months."

Mike writes to 3 people for 2 letters each, so he writes a total of 6 letters per week (2 x 3). Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 30 pages per week (6 x 5). Since he can write one page in 6 minutes, he spends 30 minutes writing each letter (30 pages / 6 minutes per page). Therefore, he spends 30 minutes x 3 letters = 90 minutes per week writing letters.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours as follows:
90 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1.5 hours
Therefore, Mike spends 1.5 hours per week writing letters."
