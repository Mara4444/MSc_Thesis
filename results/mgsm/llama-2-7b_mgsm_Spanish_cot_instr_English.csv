"Response: 
Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats three in breakfast every morning and uses four to bake muffins for her friends daily. So she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left after breakfast.
She sells these extra eggs at $2 each in the farmers market daily, which means she earns $2 x 13 = $26 daily from egg sales."
"Response:  If Bat has 2 rolls of blue fabric and half that amount in white fabric, then we have:
Blue fabric = 2 rolls x length of 1 roll = 2 lengths
White fabric = (half of 2) x length of 1 roll = 1 length
So, in total, there are 3 lengths of fabric needed (blue + white). Therefore, the answer is 3 rolls."
Response:  The original value of the house is $80,000 and after adding $50,000 for repairs, the new value becomes $130,000 (150% increase). So, the gain or profit would be $50,000 ($130,000 - $80,000).
Response:  If James decides to run three races of speed per week, that means he will run a total distance of 60 meters x 3 = 180 meters per week in each race. Therefore, the total distance he runs per week is 180 meters/week x 3 weeks = 540 meters per week.
Response:  We know that every day, Wendy feeds her flock of chickens with three cups of mixed feed for chickens containing seeds, worms, and vegetables to help them stay healthy. She feeds the chickens in three meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of food. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of food. To find out how many cups of food Wendy needs to give her chickens at dinner time, we need to use the information given in the problem. If the size of Wendy's flock is 20 chickens, then we can calculate the number of cups of food needed as follows: Number of cups of food = Total amount of food / Number of chickens So, if Wendy gives her chickens 3 cups of food per day, and there are 20 chickens in her flock, then the total amount of food needed per day is: Total amount of food = 3 x 20 = 60 cups of food Now, since Wendy already gave her chickens 15 cups of food in the morning and 25 cups of food in the afternoon, the remaining amount of food needed for the last meal of the day is: Remaining amount of food = Total amount of food - Morning food - Afternoon food = 60 cups - 15 cups - 25 cups = 20 cups of food Therefore, Wendy needs to give her chickens 20 cups of food at dinner time.
Response:  If one vase costs $5, then each subsequent vase will cost half of that amount or $2.50. Therefore, if Kylar wants to buy 16 vasos, he will need to pay $39 (16 x $2.50).
"Response:  We know that in Charleston there are twice as many ovejas as in Toulouse and four times more ovejas than in Seattle. So, if there are x ovejas in Toulouse, there will be 2x ovejas in Charleston and 4x ovejas in Seattle. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (2x) = 4(20)

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 80

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 27

So, there are 27 ovejas in Toulouse, 54 ovejas in Charleston, and 80 ovejas in Seattle."
"Response: 
1. Before the forced restart, Carla had downloaded 40% of the file (200 GB / 5 = 40 GB).
2. After the forced restart, she has to start over from the beginning (from 0%).
3. Therefore, the total time it takes for Carla to download the entire file is: 40 GB + (2 GB/minute) x (time taken after restart) =?
Solving for the time taken after the restart, we get:
(200 GB - 40 GB) / (2 GB/minute) = 20 minutes
So, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is: 40 GB + 20 minutes = 60 minutes."
"Response:  We know that John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60mph before turning back. So he covered a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60mph x 3hours = 180 miles
Now we need to calculate how much time he spent in traffic during the last two hours. Since he was driving at a speed of 30mph during this time, he covered a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30mph x 2hours = 60 miles
So now John has driven a total distance of:
Total Distance = Distance from house + Distance in traffic = 180 miles + 60 miles = 240 miles
From here, we can see that it took him 4 hours to drive the remaining distance of 240 miles at a speed of 80mph, so he arrived home after 4 hours of driving."
Response:  We know that Eliza works up to 40 hours per week at her standard rate of $10/hour, which means she earns $400 for those hours. For each hour worked beyond 40 hours, she receives a bonus of 1.2 times her standard rate, or $12/hour. So if she works additional hours, she will earn an extra amount equal to $12 x number of additional hours worked. Therefore, total earnings = $400 + ($12 x number of additional hours). To find out how many additional hours she worked, we can subtract the 40 hours she worked at her standard rate from the total number of hours she worked this week. If she worked 45 hours in total, then she worked 5 hours more than her standard rate (45 - 40 = 5). So, her total earnings are: Total earnings = $400 + ($12 x 5) = $400 + $60 = $460.
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads. If in the second month, there were three times more downloads than in the first month, then in the second month, there would be 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. However, as stated in the problem, the number of downloads decreased by 30% in the third month, so in that month, there would be 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads during the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.
"Response:  The total amount of money spent is equal to the number of items purchased times their price per unit. So, we can start by listing all the information given in the problem:
Toula bought 3 dozen (= 3 x 12) donuts at $68 each = $204
She also bought 2 dozen (= 2 x 6) mini pastelillos at $80 each = $160
Finally, she bought 6 dozen (= 6 x 12) tortillas at $55 each = $330
So, the total amount of money spent by Toula is $204 + $160 + $330 = $694."
Response:  First year, there is no income because the tree hasn't produced any lemons yet. Second year, the tree produces 7 lemons and Carlos can sell them for $1,5 each, so he will have $10,5 in total (7 x $1,5). Third year, the tree will produce again 7 lemons and Carlos will be able to sell them for $1,5 each, so he will have $10,5 + $10,5 = $21 in total. Fourth year, the tree will produce again 7 lemons and Carlos will be able to sell them for $1,5 each, so he will have $21 + $14,5 = $35,5 in total. And so on... So, it will take approximately 6 years for Carlos to start making money with his lemon tree ($35,5 - $90 = $44,5).
Response:  We know that Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners at Green House, two more at Red House and half of what was left at Orange House. So, she sold a total of 1 + 2 + (1/2) = 4 vacuum cleaners outside her house. Now, we are told that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, she had 5 - 4 = 1 vacuum cleaner initially.
"Response:  We know that in total there are 20 students and we want to find out what percentage of them signed up for hip hop dance. So let's start with the information given in the problem:
* 20% of the students (4 students) signed up for contemporary dance.
* The remaining 80% of the students (16 students) were divided equally among the other two genres (jazz and hip hop). This means that each genre had 25% of the remaining students (or 4 students for jazz and 3 students for hip hop).
So now we have a total of 20 + 4 = 24 students who did not sign up for contemporary dance. And we know that 3/24 = 0.125 or approximately 12.5% of these students signed up for hip hop dance. Therefore, the answer is 12.5%."
"Response:  The merchant wants to choose an option that will maximize their gain at the end of the month. So they need to compare the expected value of each option based on the market growth rates provided in the question.
The expected value of the jewelry option can be calculated as follows:
Expected value of jewelry = $5000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5375
Similarly, the expected value of the electronics option can be calculated:
Expected value of electronics = $8000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8432
Now, we need to compare these two options and choose the one with the higher expected value. Based on this comparison, the merchant should select the jewelry option since it has a higher expected value ($5375 vs. $8432). Therefore, the maximum gain for the merchant would be $5375 - $8000 = $2625."
Response:  On day one, both trains travel west for 80 miles and then turn north to travel another 150 miles. So, in total, they traveled 230 miles (80 + 150) on day one. On day two, each train traveled an additional 150 miles due north. Therefore, the total distance traveled by each train on day two is 2 x 150 = 300 miles. In summary, each train traveled a total of 230 + 300 = 530 miles over the course of the two days.
Response:  As a teacher, she earns $20 per hour, which means her weekly income is $800 (20 x 35 hours/week). As an athletic coach, she earns $30 per hour, which means her weekly income from coaching is $450 (30 x 15 hours/week). So, her total annual income is $1,250 ($800 + $450).
Response:  If Claire makes one tortilla of eggs with 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, then she will have made a total of 3 x 21 = 63 tortillas in 4 weeks (since there are 7 days in a week). So, Claire will have consumed 63 x 3 = 189 eggs in 4 weeks. Therefore, the answer is 189.
Response:  If she walked for 1 hour and covered 4 miles in that time, her pace was 4 miles/hour. Then, if she walked another hour to cover the remaining 8 miles, her pace must have been 8 miles/hour. Therefore, her average pace over the entire distance of 12 miles is 6 miles/hour (4 + 8 = 12).
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that contains two-thirds water (i.e., 6/7 = 85% water). When we add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice containing three-fifths water (i.e., 3/5 = 60% water), we get a total volume of 23 liters (10 + 15) of liquid. Since one liter of orange juice was spilled during mixing, there are now 22 liters (23 - 1) of liquid remaining. Therefore, there is 14 liters (22 - 8) of water in the combined juices.
Response:  We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so he is 6 years older than her. Then, we know that Raymond had a child when he was 23 years old. So, if Samantha is now 31 years old, then Raymond must be 37 years old (31 + 6). Therefore, his son is 37 - 6 = 31 years old.
"Response: 
1st 3 clients = 3 DVDs sold
Next 2 clients = 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs sold
Last 3 clients = 0 DVDs sold
Total number of DVDs sold = 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs
Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
Response:  The vela will be burning for 7 hours (from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm). If it burns 2 cm per hour, then it will have burned a total of 14 cm (2 cm/hour x 7 hours) during this time. Therefore, after burning for those 7 hours, the vela will be shorter by 14 cm than when it started.
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19,50 for the book and there was a 25% discount from the original price. So we can write an equation as follows:

Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Original Price = $19,50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19,50 / 0.75
= $26,00

Therefore, the original price of the book before the discount was $26,00."
"Response:  We know that Marie paid a total of $50 for her food. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

$12 + $3 x 5 = $50

Where ""x"" represents the number of boxes of milk that Marie bought. Substituting the value of $3 for each box of milk, we get:

$12 + $3 x 5 = $50

Now, let's focus on the pizzas. According to the problem statement, Marie paid $8,50 for each box of pizza. Therefore, we can write another equation:

$8,50 x = $50 - ($12 + $3 x 5)

Solving both equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 6 (boxes of milk)

So, Marie bought 6 boxes of milk. Now, let's find out how many boxes of pizza she bought:

$8,50 x = $50 - ($12 + $3 x 6)

Simplifying and solving for ""x"", we get:

x = 4 (boxes of pizza)

Therefore, Marie bought 4 boxes of pizza."
Response:  The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50, and the cost of one pair of pants is $22.50. Therefore, if Mishka bought three pairs of shorts, she spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on them. Similarly, if she bought three pairs of pants, she spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on them. Finally, if she bought three pairs of shoes, she spent $42 x 3 = $126 on them. So, in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $242.50 on all her clothes.
Response:  After 60 days, Cynthia will have bought 60 x 15 = 900 portions of ice cream. Therefore, she will have spent $900 on ice cream after 60 days.
Response:  We know that Henry made two stops during his bike ride of 60 miles. The first stop was after 20 miles, so he rode for 40 miles (60 - 20) without stopping. Then, he stopped after riding for another 15 miles, which means he rode an additional 35 miles (15 + 40). Therefore, the distance between the first and second stops is 35 miles.
Response:  The cost of one pair of high-top sneakers is $33 + $66 = $99. So, if two pairs of high-top sneakers together cost $5 less than the boots, then the cost of each pair of high-top sneakers is: $99 / 2 = $49.50. Therefore, the boots cost $49.50.
Response:  The ratio of their ages is given as 7:11, which means that for every 7 years Darrell has aged, Allen has aged 11 years. So, if Darrell is currently 49 years old (162 / 3 = 54), then Allen must be 49 x 11 = 539 years old within 10 years. Therefore, Allen will be 639 years old in 10 years.
Response:  We have three friends who are trying to estimate how many gumballs there are in the jar. Friend 1 says there are 80 gumballs. Friend 2 says there are 20 more than half of what Friend 1 said, which is 40 (since half of 80 is 40). So, Friend 2 estimates 120 gumballs. Friend 3 says there are 25% more than Friend 1, which means they estimate 100 gumballs (since 25% more than 80 is 100). Therefore, the average of their estimates is 96 gumballs.
Response:  Since John takes each dog for half an hour every day, he spends 10 x 30 = 300 minutes taking care of the dogs per week. So, John dedicates 300 minutes to caring for his dogs per week.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 monedas in total. Since there are more gold coins than silver coins, we can say that the number of gold coins is greater than the number of silver coins. So, if X is the number of gold coins and Y is the number of silver coins, we have: X > Y. Now, we are asked to find out how many gold coins Gretchen has. Therefore, we can set up the equation: X = Number of gold coins. Substituting this value into the inequality given above, we get: X > Y. Solving for X, we get: X = 40. So, Gretchen has 40 gold coins.
"Response:  We know that:
A) Siobhan has fewer jewels than Aaron.
B) Aaron has more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
C) Raymond has 40 jewels.
From these statements, we can deduce that:
Siobhan has x jewels.
Since Aaron has 2 less jewels than Siobhan, Aaron has x - 2 jewels.
Since Aaron has more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, and Raymond has 40 jewels, Aaron has at least 40 / 2 = 20 jewels more than Raymond. Therefore, Aaron has (x - 2) + 20 = 60 jewels.
Now, since Aaron has more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we can say that Siobhan has half of what remains after subtracting Aaron's jewels from Raymond's jewels. That is, Siobhan has (60 - (x - 2)) = 30 jewels.
Therefore, Siobhan has 30 jewels."
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike won 4 points, so he gained a total of 4 x 2 = 8 points in that time frame. Then, in the second 20 minutes, he won an additional 25% more points, which is equal to 25% of 8 points = 2 points. Therefore, Mike gained a total of 8 + 2 = 10 points during the entire 40-minute game.
Response:  If Terry buys 2 yogurs per day and currently there is an offer of 4 yogurs for $5, then he spends $5 / 4 = $1.25 per day on yogurt. To find out how much he spends in 30 days, we multiply this amount by 30: $1.25 x 30 = $37.50. Therefore, Terry spends $37.50 on yogurt during 30 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John sold all his toys and used the money to buy video games. So, he has no more toys left. Then, we are told that he had 13 Lego sets initially, which he sold for $15 each, so he made a total of $195 ($13 x $15). Now, we know that he spent $20 x 8 = $160 on video games, leaving him with $195 - $160 = $35 as change. Therefore, John still has 13 / $35 = 3.7 Lego sets left. Since you cannot have a fraction of a set, John has exactly 4 Lego sets left.
Response:  We know that John runs for 60 miles per week and he does it in 3 days. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total distance = Distance/Days x Number of days. In this case, total distance is equal to 60 miles, so we can substitute it into the equation: Total distance = (Distance/Days) x Number of days. Now, let's analyze each part of the equation: Distance/Days = 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day. Number of days = 3 days. Substituting these values into the first equation, we get: Total distance = (20 miles/day) x 3 days = 60 miles. Therefore, John runs at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
Response:  If Dana can run at a speed of x miles per hour and walk at a speed of y miles per hour, then we know that x/y = 4, since she can run four times faster than she can walk. We also know that x + 2y = 6, since she can cover a total distance of 6 miles in six hours. Now we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy these two equations. Solving them, we get x = 8 and y = 4. So Dana can run at a speed of 8 miles per hour and walk at a speed of 4 miles per hour. Therefore, if she runs for one-third of the time (i.e., 2 hours) and walks for two-thirds of the time (i.e., 4 hours), she will cover a total distance of 10 miles (since running takes her twice as far as walking).
Response:  We know that the age of Ben's iPhone is twice that of Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 times 1 = 2 years old. Now we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 times 2 = 8 years old. Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is 8 years.
"Response:  We know that when Polly has the stone of sapphire, she can throw the javelin three times farther than usual. So if she throws it at a distance of x feet without the stone, then with the stone, she can throw it at a distance of 3x feet. 
We also know that the dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet away from its location. Therefore, we need to find the value of x such that Polly is beyond the range of the dragon's flames when she throws the javelin. 
Let's assume that Polly is initially located at y feet away from the dragon. Then, when she throws the javelin, it will travel a maximum distance of x feet before reaching the dragon. Since the dragon's flames only reach up to 1000 feet, we can set up the following inequality: 
x + y <= 1000
Now, let's solve for y in terms of x using the above inequality:
y = 1000 - x
So, when Polly is y feet away from the dragon, she can throw the javelin at a distance of x feet and still be beyond the range of the dragon's flames."
Response:  The abuela made 5 pastries for lunch and cut each one into 8 pieces. So, she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pastries in total. Then, after everyone served themselves, there were 14 remaining pieces. Therefore, the number of pieces that the guests served themselves was 14 - 40 = -26 pieces.
Response:  If one serving of French fries has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a bag of 300g, then the total number of calories in that bag is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. Now, if the person wants to consume 2000 calories per day and they have already eaten 1800 calories (which is equal to 75% of their daily goal), then they can safely eat up to 350 calories from the bag of French fries (2000 - 1800 = 350). Therefore, the maximum amount of French fries this person can eat is 350/5 = 70 grams.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many velas can be made from one pound of wax. Since each cone-shaped vela requires 10 grams of wax, and there are 453.6 grams in a pound (lb), we have: Number of velas = Weight of wax / Weight of one vela = lb x 453.6 g / 10 g per vela = 45.36 velas Now, let's assume that Charlie sells each vela for $2. So, if he makes 45.36 velas from one pound of wax, his total revenue will be: Revenue = Number of velas x Selling price per vela = 45.36 velas x $2.00 per vela = $90.72 However, as mentioned earlier, Charlie pays $10.00 for supplies (including the wax) per pound. Therefore, his cost of goods sold (COGS) is: COGS = Supplies cost per pound x Number of pounds used = $10.00 per pound x Number of pounds used = $10.00 x 45.36 = $453.60 Finally, to find out his net gain or loss, we subtract his COGS from his revenue: Net gain = Revenue - COGS = $90.72 - $453.60 = -$362.88 So, Charlie's net gain would be negative $362.88 if he sells 20 velas using the given information.
"Response: 
Monday - 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Tuesday - 3 articles x 4 hours per article = 12 hours
Wednesday - 8 articles x 4 hours per article = 32 hours
Total hours spent writing articles during those three days = 64 hours"
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 notes in her bag before she left for work and then bought another pack of notes at the store. So, the total number of notes she had is 80 + x, where x is the number of notes in the new pack. Since she placed one note in each of the 220 coffee cups, we can say that x = 220. Therefore, the number of notes in the original pack was 80 + 220 = 300.
Response:  We know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. So if he spent $x on blue ties, he spent $2x on red ties. Since each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie, the cost of one red tie is $1.5x. Therefore, John spent $200 on blue ties and $300 on red ties.
"Response:  If Tracy used a piece of wire that is 4 feet long to support the tomato plants in the garden and she cut it into pieces of 6 inches long, then...

1. Convert the length of the wire from feet to inches: 4 ft = 48 in (since there are 12 in/ft)
2. Calculate the number of pieces she got: 48 in / 6 in/piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
Response:  Since there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 units, then the total number of units in the building is 15 x 8 = 120 units. Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that 3/4 x 120 = 90 units are occupied. Therefore, the number of units vacant is 120 - 90 = 30 units.
Response:  If Lloyd has a large farm with many chickens and they lay 252 eggs per day, then he will sell all these eggs in one week. So, his total revenue for the week is: Total Revenue = Number of Eggs sold x Price per egg Total Revenue = 252 eggs/day x $2/dozen Total Revenue = $404 per week. Therefore, Lloyd earns $404 per week from selling eggs.
Response:  The distance traveled during the first leg of the journey is given as 10 miles per hour x 3 hours = 30 miles. During the return trip, Tom travels at a speed of 6 miles per hour for 2 hours, so he covers a distance of 6 miles per hour x 2 hours = 12 miles. Therefore, the total distance traveled in both legs of the journey is 30 + 12 = 42 miles. Now we can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find out how long it takes Tom to complete the entire journey: Time = 42 miles / (10 miles/hour + 6 miles/hour) = 7.25 hours. So, it will take Tom approximately 7.25 hours to return from his destination.
Response:  If we know that Uriah has 15 pounds of books in his backpack and each magazine weighs 1/4 pound, then he will have to remove 15 x 4 = 60 magazines from his bag. Now, if he removes 30 magazines, how many pounds of weight does it leave him? So, he needs to take out 60 - 30 = 30 pounds of toys.
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic earned $60 x 6 = $360 from repairing 6 tires of trucks and $40 x 4 = $160 from repairing 4 tires of cars, for a total of $520. On Friday, he earned $0 from repairing no tires of trucks but $1200 from repairing 12 tires of cars, for a total of $1200. Therefore, the difference in income between the two days is $1200 - $520 = $780. So, the day with greater income was Friday.
Response:  The family Doubtfire has two cats (Patchy and Trixie) that have had kittens. According to their mother, Patchy has had three times as many kittens as Trixie, which means Patchy has 3 x 3 = 9 kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens for both cats is 9 + 12 = 21 kittens. So, the family Doubtfire currently has 21 kittens in addition to the seven they adopted from the animal shelter.
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 palettes and he eats 2 of them. So, he has 30 - 2 = 28 palettes left. To fill 2 bags with 2 palettas each, we need to divide 28 palettes into groups of 2 palettas each. Therefore, Jean can lend 28 / 2 = 14 bags.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 for each movie ticket and $7 for popcorn, then he has spent a total of $14 per trip to the movies. Since he only has $42 for the entire week, we can calculate how many times he can go to the movies as follows: Number of trips = Total amount available / Cost per trip = $42 / $14 = 3 times So, Peter can go to the movies three times that week.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much weight of the camion and driver will be left after loading the cargos onto it. So, total weight = 3755 - (weight of driver + weight of cargo). Now, let's calculate the weight of each box as you mentioned they are all identical with 15 pounds per box. Therefore, total weight of boxes = number of boxes x weight of one box. Now, we have two equations: total weight of camion and driver = remaining weight of camion and driver after loading boxes; total weight of boxes = number of boxes x weight of one box. Now, we can solve for the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the camion without exceeding the limit of the bridge by substituting these values into each equation and solving them simultaneously."
Response:  The original price of the order was $40,00 (given). Then they added a delivery fee of $3,00 (given), which is 7.5% of the original price. Next, they added an additional tip of $4,00, bringing the total to $47,00 ($40,00 + $3,00 + $4,00). So the final price of the order after all fees and tips were applied was $47,00.
Response:  The arbusto has 6 racimos with 20 frutas each, so there are 6 x 20 = 120 frutas in the racimos. Additionally, there are 67 frutas scattered throughout the arbusto. Therefore, the total number of frambuesas is 120 + 67 = 187 frambuesas.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 naranjas in total and we want to find out how many of them are in good condition. From the information given, we can conclude that:
* 1 naranja is in bad shape (so it doesn't count as being in good condition)
* 20% of the naranjas haven't matured yet (so they also don't count as being in good condition)
* 2 naranjas are too green (again, not in good condition)
* The remaining 23 naranjas are in good condition.
So, the number of naranjas in good condition is: 23."
"Response: 
Janet paid for the materials to make the brooch ($500). Then she paid for the craftsmanship of the brooch ($800). Finally, she paid an insurance premium (10% of the total cost) which is calculated as follows: 
$500 + $800 = $1,300 x 10% = $130
So, in total, Janet paid $1,430 for the brooch and its insurance."
"Response:  If Marcy works for 40 years and receives a pension of $50,000 per year after retirement, then her total pension amount is:
$50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000
Now, starting from year 20, she gets 5% of the pension amount every year as a bonus. So, her annual pension amount after year 20 will be:
$2,000,000 x 5% = $100,000
Therefore, her annual pension amount after 30 years of service will be:
$2,000,000 - $100,000 (bonus for 10 years) = $1,900,000
So, her annual pension amount after 30 years of service will be $1,900,000."
Response:  The amount that Aleena paid for the first half of the year is $140 x (6/12) = $90. In the second half of the year, she paid $90 - ($90 / 2) = $75. Therefore, the total amount she paid for the entire year is $90 + $75 = $165.
"Response:  We know that Sophia has already traveled 100 miles since she last filled her tank and needed to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill it. The manual says that the tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline in total. So, if we divide the distance traveled (100 miles) by the amount of fuel left in the tank (4 gallons), we get the number of miles Sophia can travel with one tank of gasoline:

Miles = Distance / Fuel Left
= 100 / 4
= 25 miles
Therefore, Sophia can travel approximately 25 miles with one tank of gasoline."
"Response: 
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed early to read for half of that time (i.e., 1 hour). He does this thrice a week.

So, in one week, he will spend 6 hours (2 x 3) watching TV and 3 hours reading (1/2 x 6 = 3).

In 4 weeks, he will have spent a total of:

6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours watching TV
+ 3 hours/week x 4 weeks = 12 hours reading
Total time spent watching TV = 24 hours
Total time spent reading = 12 hours

Therefore, Jim has spent 24 hours watching TV and 12 hours reading over the course of 4 weeks."
"Response: 
1. Female basketball team: Each school has sent one female basketball team and five players for that team. Therefore, there are 5 x number of schools = 25 female players in total.
2. Male basketball team: Similarly, each school has sent one male basketball team and five players for that team. So, there are 5 x number of schools = 25 male players in total.
3. Coaches: Each school has sent one coach for each team, so there are 5 x number of schools = 25 coaches in total.
Therefore, the total number of people who have been sent by all the schools is: 25 + 25 + 25 = 75 people."
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies less than the number of diamonds. So, the total number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. Additionally, we know that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, so the number of emeralds is 140 x 2 = 280. Therefore, there are 175 + 280 = 455 gemstones in the chest.
Response:  If there are 60 niñas and each teacher has 5 students, then there are 60 x 5 = 300 students in total. Since there is twice as many boys as girls, there are also twice as many teachers as girls. So, if there are 300 students, there must be 2 x 300 = 600 teachers. Therefore, there are 600 teachers at the school of Dr. Wertz.
Response:  If Bailey started with x dollars and received $5 per week for 8 weeks, then at the end of those 8 weeks, he had $x + (8 \* $5) = $x + 40 dollars. Since he ended up with $100 in total, we can set up the equation: $x + 40 = $100. Solving for x, we get: $x = $60. So, Bailey started with $60 dollars.
"Response:  If Judy teaches 5 classes per day and 8 classes on Saturdays...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes taught in one week.
Total classes/day x Total days/week = 5 classes/day x 7 days/week = 35 classes/week

Step 2: Multiply the total number of classes with the number of students in each class to get the total number of students taught in one week.
Number of students/class x Total number of classes/week = 15 students/class x 35 classes/week = 525 students/week

Step 3: Now, calculate the total amount of money earned by Judy in one week.
Total number of students/week x Price per student = 525 students/week x $15/student = $7,875/week

Therefore, Judy earns $7,875 in one week."
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Therefore, the number of instructions for the second recipe is 2 x 20 = 40 instructions. So, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions to prepare both plates.
Response:  If Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 each, he will make $13 (43 x $3). And if he sells 23 portions of cheesecake at $4 each, he will make $93 ($23 x $4). So, in total, Tommy will make $106 ($13 + $93).
"Response:  So, Sheila bought five cell phones at $150 each, in 3 monthly installments. The total cost of the cell phones is therefore:
$150 x 5 = $750
Now, we need to calculate the interest she will pay for each phone:
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $750 x 2% x 3 months
= $45
So, Sheila will pay $45 per month for each cell phone during the 3-month period. Therefore, her total monthly payment for all five cell phones will be:
$45 x 5 = $225
Therefore, Sheila will pay a total of $225 per month for three months to buy five cell phones with an interest rate of 2%."
Response:  If we sell 12 macetas of caléndulas at $2.74 per maceta, then we will get $32.88 ($2.74 x 12). For petunias, if we sell 9 macetas at $1.87 each, then we will get $16.53 ($1.87 x 9). And for begonias, if we sell 17 macetas at $2.12 each, then we will get $35.04 ($2.12 x 17). So in total, Artie will get $74.45 from these sales.
"Response:  Since each level of sandcastle has half the area of the previous level, we can write an equation based on this pattern:

Level i (surface area) = Level i-1 x 0.5

Now, let's plug in the values given in the problem:

Level 4 (surface area) = Level 3 x 0.5 = 8 x 0.5 = 4 square feet

So, the surface area of the fourth level is 4 square feet. Now, we know that the top level has a surface area of 16 square feet, so we can find the average surface area per level as follows:

Average surface area per level = Total surface area / Number of levels = 16 / 4 = 4 square feet

Therefore, the average surface area per level of the sandcastle is 4 square feet."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Cecilia has to feed her puppy with 1 cup of food for dogs every day during the first 180 days (which is equal to 6 months). Since there are 45 days in each month, she will need to buy 45 cups of food for each month. Therefore, the total number of cups of food that Cecilia needs to buy during the first year is:

45 cups/month x 12 months = 540 cups
So, Cecilia will need 540 bags of dog food during the first year."
"Response:  We know that Sarah lavas 4 times more of clothes than David. So if she lavas x pounds of clothes, David lavas 4x pounds of clothes. Now we are told that Raymon...

Please provide your reasoning and calculations to support your answer."
Response:  If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the best price of $1 per 2 units, he will buy 9 flowers (since 18 / 2 = 9). So, he will pay $9 for those 9 flowers. Now, if he buys 3 flowers in bunches of 3 each, he will pay $7.50 ($2.50 x 3) for those 3 flowers. Therefore, the total amount that Vincent saves is $9 - $7.50 = $1.50.
Response:  The cost of the service without any discount is $100. Since it's a new customer, the peluquero offers a 30% discount, which means that the final price will be: $100 x (1 - 0.30) = $70. So, the cost of the service with the discount is $70.
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters each = 4 liters per girl (since there are 2 girls). Then, the boy received 6 liters more than the total amount given to the girls = 6 + 4 = 10 liters. So, there are 10 liters left over.
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 pegatines initially and then he bought 21 more at the mall. So, in total, Charlie has 10 + 21 = 31 pegatines. Then, he received 23 additional pegatines as a gift. Therefore, Charlie now has 31 + 23 = 54 pegatines. Finally, he gave away 9 pegatines to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 pegatines.
"Response:  We know that Alex weighs less than four times the weight of Grace, so if we can find out how much Grace weighs, we will be able to calculate Alex's weight. So, let's substitute ""Grace"" with ""125 pounds"". Now, we have the equation: 
Alex weighs less than 4 x 125 =? pounds. 
Now, we simplify this equation and solve for Alex's weight: 
4 x 125 = 400 pounds (since Alex weighs less than 4 times the weight of Grace). Therefore, Alex weighs 400 - 2 = 398 pounds. "
Response:  If Dan plants 3 rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses, then there are 3 x 25 = 75 roses in total. And if each rose has 8 spines, then there are 75 x 8 = 600 spines in total. Therefore, there are 600 spines in total.
Response:  The team played 22 matches and won 8 more than they lost. So, if we let W be the number of matches won, then we can write an equation as follows: W = 22 - L, where L is the number of matches lost. Now, we are asked to find out how many matches the team won. Therefore, we need to solve for W in the above equation. Solving it, we get: W = 14. So, the team won 14 matches.
Response:  We know that Gene goes four times to vacation per year and since he was 23 years old (now he is 34), so in total he has gone for 11 vacations (4 x 5 = 20). Since each vacation provides one block of the quilt, we have 20 blocks of quilts. Therefore, the answer is 20.
Response:  The first time it sounded four times, so the second time it sounded (3 times more than the first) = 4 x 3 = 12 times. And the third time it sounded half as many times as the second time = 12 / 2 = 6 times. So in total, the alarm sounded 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.
Response:  If Sylvie has just completed five years of service in December (i.e., at the end of year 5), her initial monthly salary was $600. Then, according to the policy, her annual salary after five years will be increased by 10% of the initial amount, which is $60 x $60 = $3600. Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after completing five years of service is $600 + $3600 = $4200. Now, if she continues working for three more years and receives another 10% increase every year, her annual salary after three additional years of service would be: $4200 x 1.10 = $4620. So, Sylvie's annual salary after six years of service is $4620.
Response:  If Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than Harald, then for every copy that Harald sold, Marilyn sold 10 copies. So if Harald sold x copies, Marilyn sold 10x copies. We know that together they sold 88,000 copies. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 10x + x = 88,000. Simplifying the equation, we get: 20x = 88,000. Dividing both sides of the equation by 20, we get: x = 4400. So Harald sold 4400 copies.
Response:  We know that there are 16 friends invited to the party and since 1/4 of them will not arrive (which is equal to 4), we need 0.75 x 16 = 12 bags of presents. Since each bag costs $2, the total cost would be $2 x 12 = $24. So, Christina will spend $24 on presents for her guests.
"Response:  If an adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad and a child eats half as much, then a child will eat 5 pounds of potato salad. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, the total amount of potato salad that Ted needs to bring is:

20 x 10 = 200 pounds (for adults) + 5 x 5 = 25 pounds (for children) = 225 pounds
Therefore, Ted should bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three times more pets than Marcia. So, if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets.
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. So, if Cindy has x pets, then Marcia has x + 2 pets.
Therefore, the total number of pets among the three is: 3x + (x + 2) = 4x + 2."
"Response:  We know that:
Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Amy is 5 + x years old, where x is the age of Jackson.
Jackson is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Corey is x + 2 years old.
James is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is x + 2 years old.
We want to find out how old Jackson is. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + 2 = (x + 2) + 1
Simplifying the equation:
2x + 4 = x + 3
Subtracting x from both sides:
2x = 3
Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 1.5
Therefore, Jackson is 1.5 years old."
Response:  If Lee could run the obstacle race in 38 seconds before, and his speed improved by 10% after changing his diet, then he can now run it in 35.2 seconds (38 x 1.1 = 41.6). So, Gerald can run it in 37.2 seconds faster than Lee (41.6 - 38 = 3.6)
"Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 12 fewer domestic animals than the sum of dogs and cats in the neighborhood. So if we let D be the number of dogs and C be the number of cats, we can write an equation based on this information:
D + C = Total Domestic Animals - 12
Now, according to the problem statement, there are 60 dogs, so D = 60. And since there are two cats for every dog, C = 60 x 2 = 120. Therefore, the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is:
Total Domestic Animals = D + C = 60 + 120 = 180
So, there are 180 domestic animals in the neighborhood."
"Response:  We know that out of 200 students in 5th grade, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls belong to the group of ""Niñas Exploradoras"". So, we can write an equation as follows:
Boys = 2/5 x 200 = 40
Girls - Niñas Exploradoras = (2/3) x 160 = 128
Now, we need to find out how many girls do not belong to the group of ""Niñas Exploradoras"". To do this, we subtract the number of girls who belong to the group from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the group = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the group
= 160 - 128
= 32
Therefore, there are 32 girls who do not belong to the group of ""Niñas Exploradoras""."
"Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for x hours (where x is less than 9), then we can write an equation as follows:
x + 9 = 18
Now, since James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can say that James slept for:
x / 3 = 9
Simplifying this equation, we get:
x = 27
So, James slept for 27 - 9 = 18 hours more than Harry."
Response:  We know that when Freda makes sauce with canned tomatoes, each can loses half of its volume. So if she uses three cans of 16 oz each, each can will lose 8 oz (half of 16) and become 8 oz. Now, let's calculate how many cans Freda used in total to make 32 oz of sauce. To do this, we divide the amount of sauce (32 oz) by the reduced volume of each can (8 oz): 32 oz / 8 oz = 4 cans. Therefore, Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes to make her last batch of tomato sauce.
Response:  The first part of the question states that some cars passed through the jam in the first 15 minutes, and then it says that 20 more cars passed through in the remaining time. So, if we assume that all the cars passed through at a constant rate during those 15 minutes, we can calculate the number of cars that passed through as follows: Number of cars passing = (Total number of cars - Number of cars taking exit) / Time taken to pass through the jam Total number of cars = Original number of cars x (Time taken for entire jam / Time taken for first 15 minutes) = 30 x (30/15 + 20/15) = 30 x 4 = 120 Cars took an exit, so the number of cars that passed through the jam is 120.
Response:  Mary has 2 plants of macetas in each of the 40 windowsills, so she has a total of 80 plants of macetas. If she gives away 1 plant of maceta from each repise to her friends and family tomorrow, then she will have 79 plants of macetas left for herself.
Response:  We know that the first friend tocked the bell 20 times, and since the second friend tocked it 1/4 more than the first one, he tocked it 5 times more (since 1/4 is equal to 4/4). So, the second friend tocked the bell 95 times (20 + 5 \* 4 = 95). Now, we know that the third friend tocked the bell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so he tocked it 70 times (60 + 10 = 70). Therefore, in total, the friends tocked the bell 165 times (95 + 70 = 165).
Response:  The total number of pages to be read is given as follows: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages. Since there are 5 days left after Monday (the day she read 15 pages), she has to read an average of 9.8 pages per day (49 / 5 = 9.8).
"Response: 
John likes to drink one glass of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So he will have 3 glasses of water per day = 21 glasses/week (7 days x 3 glasses/day)
On weekends, John takes an extra glass of water before going to bed = 4 more glasses/weekend (2 days x 2 glasses/day) Total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week = 25 glasses/week (21 + 4)"
"Response:  The bank of fog enters from the ocean in 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. To find out how many minutes it will take to cover the entire city, we need to divide the distance of the city (42 miles) by the distance covered in 10 minutes (3 miles). So, the answer is:
Minutes = Miles / Time taken to cover 3 miles
= 42 miles / 10 minutes
= 4.2 minutes
Therefore, the bank of fog will take approximately 4.2 minutes to cover the entire city."
"Response:  If Poppy placed one fourth of the total number of pieces (1000) on the board initially, then she has placed 250 pieces (1000 / 4 = 250).
Now, if Poppy's mother places one third of the remaining pieces (300 - 250 = 50), then she has placed 50 additional pieces on the board.
Therefore, there are 50 + 250 = 300 pieces left to place on the board."
Response:  If Cody comes three times more cookies than Amir, that means Cody has x cookies and Amir has 3x cookies. So if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody will eat 3(5) = 15 cookies. Therefore, between them, they have a total of 3x + 15 = 45 cookies.
Response:  The volume of each box is given as 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot). So the volume of all three boxes together is 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot and 0.12 feet per inch for the walls, the volume of the walls is 360 / 12 = 30 cubic inches. Therefore, the total volume inside the three boxes is 360 - 30 = 330 cubic inches.
"Response:  We know that Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Wednesday, he watched some episodes of a program that lasted for 30 minutes each. Since he finished his homework early on Thursday and watched an hour-long episode followed by another 30-minute show, we can assume that he watched a total of 2 hours of TV on Thursday (1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours). Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:

$$ \text {Number of 30-minute episodes} = \frac{\text{Total time spent watching TV on Wednesday}}{\text{Time per episode}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Number of 30-minute episodes} &= \frac{2}{30} \\ &= 6"
Response:  Last year, Henry made x galletas. This year, he wants to make twice as many (2x). So, he has horneado 2x + 15 = 110 galletas. Therefore, last year, Henry made x = 110 - 15 = 95 galletas.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one gallon of gasoline is $3.00 per gallon. Then, if an individual buys 10 gallons of gasoline, they will pay $30.00 for those 10 gallons (10 x $3.00 = $30.00). Now, let's consider the rebate offered by the company. The rebate is $0.20 per gallon, which means that after purchasing 10 gallons of gasoline, the individual will receive a rebate of $2.00 ($0.20 x 10 gallons = $2.00). Therefore, the final amount paid by the individual for the gasoline will be $28.00 ($30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00).
"Response:  We know that Beatrice was $2$ rollitos away from reaching her goal and Marcel was $3$ rollitos away from reaching his goal. So, if they both consumed their complete amount of rollitos, we can calculate the average as follows:
$$\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Beatrice's distance from goal} + \text{Marcel's distance from goal}}{2}$$
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
$$\begin{align\*}
\text{Average} &= \frac{(2\text{ rollitos}) + (3\text{ rollitos})}{2} \\
&= \frac{5\text{ rollitos}}{2} \\
&= 2.5\text{ rollitos}
\end{align\*})$$
Therefore, the average number of rollitos eaten by Beatrice and Marcel is $2.5$."
"Response:  We know that the boat started to take in water while it was still in the lake and that two liters of water entered for every ten feet that Julia rowed towards the shore. Since she rowed twenty feet in sixteen seconds, we can calculate how much water entered the boat during that time as follows:
2 L/10 ft x 20 ft = 40 L (water entered the boat)
Now, since Julia took 64 seconds to reach the shore, we can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat during that time as follows:
40 L + (64 sec x 2 L/10 ft) = 40 L + 128 L = 168 L (total water in the boat when Julia reached the shore)
Therefore, there were 168 liters of water in the boat when Julia arrived at the shore."
Response:  Since there are 4 teachers who share the blackboard and each teacher has 2 classes per day, we have a total of 8 classes per day (4 x 2 = 8). If the board is cleaned 3 times per class, then it will be cleaned 24 times per day (8 x 3 = 24). Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  After 15 days, Ryan has planted a total of 30 flowers (2 x 15). However, we are told that 5 did not grow, so the actual number of flowers he has after 15 days is 30 - 5 = 25.
"Response:  We know that the number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold is six times more than the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. So if Brittany's phone can hold 50 photographs, then Jamal's phone can hold 6 x 50 = 300 photographs. Now we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in the photograph that Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo. So if there are X birds in the photograph, then Brittany's phone can hold at most 50X photographs. Therefore, the number of patos (which means ""ducks"" in Spanish) in the photograph that Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo is 300 / 50 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 patos in the photograph."
"Response:  If we multiply the cost of each piece of wood by the number of pieces that Sasha has, we get:
For the 10 pieces of 2x4 wood, the total cost is $10 x 10 = $100.
For the 5 pieces of 4x4 wood, the total cost is $16 x 5 = $80.
So, in total, Sasha has $100 + $80 = $180 worth of wood to sell."
Response:  If Katy used 7 times as much water as sugar, then for every 1 cup of water she used, she used 7/1 = 7 cups of sugar. So if she used 120 cups of water (which is equal to 120 x 7 = 840 cups of sugar). Therefore, Katy used 840 / 7 = 116 cucharaditas de azúcar.
Response:  If John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, then he will buy a total of 6 pairs of shoes (2 x 3 = 6). Since each pair costs $60, John will pay a total of $360 ($60 x 6 pairs).
Response:  On day one, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so in total, there were 10 vehicles imported (2 x 5 = 10). Now, let's assume that on the second day, they brought more containers and vehicles. We know that the total number of vehicles increased to 30, which means that we need to find out how many containers were added on the second day. Since each container has 5 vehicles inside, we can write an equation as follows: Total vehicles = Number of containers x Vehicles per container. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total vehicles = 30 / 5 = 6 containers. Therefore, on the second day, 6 new containers were imported, each containing 5 vehicles.
"Response:  Four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000 and Lylah earned x. Since then, both of their salaries have increased at the same rate. So, if Adrien's current salary is 30% more than his previous salary, and Lylah's current salary is 40% more than her previous salary, we can write:
Adrien's new salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000) = $51,000
Lylah's new salary = $x + (40% of $x) = $64,000
Now, let's find out what x was four years ago:
x - 4 years ago = $64,000 / (1 + 0.4) = $52,800
So, Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and Lylah's salary was $52,800. Therefore, the total amount that Adrien and Lylah received in salaries four years ago was:
$40,000 + $52,800 = $92,800"
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 notebooks per week and each notebook has 30 pages, then he uses 60 pages per week (2 x 30 = 60). Now, if we multiply this number by the number of weeks in a month (4), we get 240 pages used per month (60 x 4 = 240). So, Miguel uses approximately 240 pages per month.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so he had in total 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half of the number of oranges that Morisette brought, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, Kael had in total 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. Therefore, the total number of fruits brought by both students is 13 (Morisette) + 14 (Kael) = 27 fruits.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. If she had to finish some tasks, then she slept for 2 less hours each of the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday). So, Tuesday = 8 - 2 = 6 hours, and Wednesday = 6 - 2 = 4 hours. Now, if we add up all these hours, we get: Total sleep time = 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 hours. Therefore, Sadie slept for 18 hours in total that week.
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, she will cover a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Now, if she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for 4 hours (since there are 7 - 3 = 4 additional hours), she will cover a distance of 4 x 5 = 20 miles. Therefore, in total, Rosie can run 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jennie began, there were x cartons in the pile of cards that needed stamps and 60 - x cards in the pile of cards with already stamped cards. After she put stamps on one-third of the cards that needed stamps, there were (x / 3) + (60 - x) = 90 cards left in the pile of cards that needed stamps. Now, if there are 30 cards in the pile of cards with already stamped cards, then when Jennie started, there were 90 - 30 = 60 cards in the pile of cards that needed stamps. So, the answer is 60.
"Response: 
Julia bought a new package of 5 cucharas and her husband also gave her 3 more cucharas. So, in total, Julia had 8 cucharas (5 + 3).
Later, when she was putting the table, she used 3 cucharas to taste the stew again. So, now Julia has 5 cucharas left (8 - 3).
Now, we know that her husband also gave her 5 cucharas, so Julia has a total of 10 cucharas (5 + 5).
Therefore, there were 10 cucharas in the package that Julia bought."
Response:  We know that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 fish sausages more than chicken sausages. So, if he bought x chicken sausages, then he also bought 6 + x fish sausages. Therefore, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is 38 + (6 + x) = 44.
"Response:  If Amy made 20 more friends than Lily after changing schools, then Lily had x friends before switching schools. Since Amy has 30 friends now (including herself), we can write an equation:
Lily + Amy = 30... (1)
We know that Lily had 50 friends in total, so we can substitute this value into equation (1):
Lily + Amy = 30... (1)
Substituting Lily's initial number of friends:
Lily + (Amy - Lily) = 30... (1)
Now, let's solve for Amy's number of friends:
Amy = 30 - Lily... (2)
Now we have two equations and two variables: Lily and Amy. Solving them simultaneously gives us the values of both variables:
Lily = 20
Amy = 10
So, Lily has 20 friends, and Amy has 10 friends."
"Response:  The cost of one sandía is three times that of each pimiento, so the cost of one sandía is 3 × $15 = $45. Therefore, the cost of four sandías is $45 x 4 = $180. 
The cost of twenty pimientos is $15 x 20 = $300. 
The cost of ten naranjas is $15 x 10 = $150. 
So, the total amount of money that Dillon will spend at the store is $180 + $300 + $150 = $630."
"Response:  The number of patients per day is given as 500. Each patient spends an average of 24 minutes being examined. So, the total time spent in examinations per day is:
Time = Number of patients x Time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes
Now, we are told that each doctor charges $150 per hour and the hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients. To find out how much money the hospital makes from these visits, we need to convert the time into hours first:
Hours = Minutes / 60 = 12,000 / 60 = 200 hours
So, the hospital makes $200 x 200 hours = $40,000 per day from these visits."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 60 elves working for Santa at his department store. Then, after some elves quit due to children throwing up on them, we have:

Initially: 60 elves
After 1/3 of elves quit: 40 elves (since 20 elves quit)
After 10 more elves quit due to being punched in the shins: 30 elves (since 10 elves quit)

Therefore, there are 30 elves left working for Santa at his department store."
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. So in June, he spent $500 - $60 = $440. Therefore, his total spending for those two months was $500 + $440 = $940.
Response:  First, Pam and Fred went to the amusement park together, and Pam rode the roller coaster twice while Fred rode it four times. Then, they decided to ride the merry-go-round twice each. So in total, how many tickets did they use that day? Well, if we multiply the number of times Pam rode the roller coaster by its cost (6 tickets), we get 12 tickets for her. And if we multiply the number of times Fred rode the roller coaster by its cost, we get 24 tickets for him. Therefore, the total number of tickets used that day is 36 tickets.
Response:  On Monday (lunes), Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday (martes), he walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday, which is 6 x 4 = 24 miles. Therefore, the total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 + 24 = 65 miles. So, Walt walked 65 miles on Wednesday.
Response:  If Tom does the laundry four times a month, he will do it 4 x 12 = 48 times a year. So, if each wash costs $15, then Tom spends $15 x 48 = $720 per year on car washes.
Response:  If Brian has 20 video games and he lost 5 before making the comparison with Bobby, then Brian has 15 video games left (20 - 5 = 15). Now, we know that Bobby has 5 less than 3 times the number of video games that Brian has, so Bobby has 15 x 3 = 45 video games. Therefore, Bobby has 45 video games.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in the world and two-thirds of them are located in Scotland (i.e., 19 unicorns). Since three-fourths of the Scottish unicorns are females (i.e., 15 females), we can conclude that there are 15 female unicorns in Scotland. Therefore, the number of female unicorns in Scotland is 15.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in the order without considering the delivery charge and tip. The prices are as follows:

* 2 sandwiches at $7.50 each = $15.00
* 2 bags of French fries at $1.50 each = $3.00
* 2 boxes of cookies at $1.00 each = $2.00
Total cost without delivery charge and tip = $20.00
Now, let's add the delivery charge of 20% of the total cost:
$20.00 x 20% = $4.00 (delivery charge) Total cost with delivery charge = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
Finally, if Rory wants to leave a $5.00 tip, that will be an additional $5.00. So, the final cost of the order including the tip is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00. Therefore, the answer is $29.00."
Response:  If Mark completed 75 questions in 75/5 = 15 hours for the first test and took 6 hours to complete the second test of 100 questions, then he completed 100 - 75 = 25 questions in the remaining time of 6 hours. So, he left 25 questions incomplete.
Response:  If there are x bolas of chicles rosas and 4x times more chicles rosas than blue ones, then the total number of chicles is 22 + 4x - 12 = 35. So, the number of chicles rosas is 35 / 4 = 8.75.
Response:  We know that out of the total number of cars available for rent (20), 12 have automatic transmission and 4 have manual transmission. This means that the remaining 4 cars must have semi-automatic transmission. So, the percentage of cars with semi-automatic transmission is 4/20 = 0.2 or 20%.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and we have to find out how many worker bees there are. From the information given, we can calculate as follows: Number of worker bees = Total number of bees - Number of baby bees - Number of queen bees Now, let's substitute the values we know into the equation: Number of worker bees = 700 - (2 x 100) - 1 = 700 - 200 + 1 = 501 bee workers So, there are 501 worker bees in the colony.
Response:  If Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games per day and works for 5 days in a week (Monday to Friday), then he will spend 10 hours per day working + 10 hours per day playing video games = 20 hours/day. So, if he earns $10/hour at work, his total daily income would be $10 x 20 hours = $200 per day. Now, let's calculate how much money he would make in a week: $200 x 7 days = $1400. Therefore, Jordan would make $1400 in a week if he uses all of his time playing video games to work.
Response:  The total cost of all non-food items is: Leche x $2 = $2, Huevos x $3 = $9, Bombillas x $3 = $9, Tazas x $3 = $9, and Trampas x $4 = $16. Total cost of non-food items = $2 + $9 + $9 + $9 + $16 = $54. So, the total cost of everything including the impost would be: $54 + (54 x 10%) = $57.80.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lucas will make from each customer per week. Since he has 8 customers in total (6 actual and 2 potential), he will make $92 per week from his actual customers ($10 x 9) and $40 per week from his potential customers ($10 x 4). Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lucas will make per week: Total income = Actual income + Potential income = $92 + $40 = $132 per week. Next, we need to subtract the costs associated with running the business from the total income. The costs are: Cost of lejía = 2 x $2 = $4 per weekCost of cleaning supplies = 5 x $5 = $25 per weekTotal costs = $4 + $25 = $31 per weekNow, let's calculate the profit: Profit = Total income - Total costs = $132 - $31 = $101 per weekTherefore, Lucas will make a profit of $101 per week from his cleaning business.
Response:  If John has a field of pineapples that is 10 hectares and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, then he has a total of 1000 pineapples in his field (10 x 100 = 1000). Since he can harvest them every 3 months, he will be able to harvest 4 times in one year (12 / 3 = 4). So, John will have 4000 pineapples in one year (1000 x 4 = 4000).
"Response:  The total number of pieces in all three boxes is given as:

* Caja de bloques Lego de 500 piezas = 500 pieces
* Caja de bloques Lego con 3 veces más piezas que la de 500 piezas = 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces
* Caja de bloques Lego que tiene 1/4 de la cantidad de piezas = 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces

So, altogether, Johnny has collected 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 pieces of Lego blocks."
"Response: 
Step 1 (first 6 hours): 30 bees leave the hive.
Step 2 (next 6 hours): Half of the original number leaves = 15 bees.
Step 3 (last 6 hours): 2 times as many bees leave than in Step 2 = 30 bees.
Step 4 (last 6 hours): Each bee that left earlier returns to the hive = 30 bees.
Total number of bees returning in last 6 hours = 30 + 30 = 60 bees.
Therefore, Debra saw 60 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."
Response:  The cost of one adult entrance is $12 and the cost of one child entrance is $10. So, if Brittany's mom gave $8 back, that means she paid for only one child entrance ($10 - $8 = $2). Therefore, Brittany's mom paid $2 to the cashier.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times more friends than Dorothy in Facebook. So if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends. Also, we know that James has four times more friends than Dorothy. So if Dorothy has x friends, James has 4x friends. Now, we are given that Charlie has 12 friends in Facebook. So, we can write an equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, James has 4x = 4 \* 4 = 16 friends in Facebook.
Response:  We know that Steve can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute, which is equal to 7 miles per hour (since there are 5,280 feet in a mile). Therefore, we can calculate how long it will take Steve to reach his house as follows: Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 7 mph = 0.42 hours or 26 minutes. Now let's consider Tim's situation. Since he lives 2 miles away from the school, it will take him half the time it took Steve to reach his house, since he has to cover half the distance. So, Tim will finish the race in: Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 264 fpm = 0.08 hours or 5 minutes. Now, let's find out when the winner will arrive at Tim's house. Since Steve finished the race 0.42 hours before Tim, the winner will arrive at Tim's house after 0.42 - 0.08 = 0.34 hours or 22 minutes.
"Response: 
Day 1:
* 5 children came to inflate their bicycle tires (cost of each gum = $0.25)
	+ Total cost for Day 1 = 5 x $0.25 = $1.25
* 3 children came to inflate all the tires of their tricycles (cost of each gum = $0.25)
	+ Total cost for Day 1 = 3 x $0.25 = $0.75
* 1 child came to inflate the tire of his/her monocycle (cost of each gum = $0.25)
	+ Total cost for Day 1 = $0.25
Total amount earned by Shawnda on Day 1 = $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25
Therefore, Shawnda earned $2.25 on Day 1."
Response:  If Carl buys 12 packages of cookies (since each package contains 6 cookies), then he has bought a total of 72 cookies (12 x 6 = 72). Since each cookie costs $0.10, the total cost of all the cookies is $7.20 ($0.10 x 72 cookies). Now, if Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will receive $3.80 in change ($10 - $7.20).
"Response: 
Dave initially had 20 potato chips (14 + 6).
The gull took half of them, leaving Dave with 10 (14 / 2 = 7).
Then, three pigeons intimidated him and each one ate 3 chips, so there were 7 - 9 = 8 chips left.
A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining chips, leaving 8 / 3 = 5 chips.
Finally, ants carried off one chip, leaving 5 - 1 = 4 chips.
Therefore, Dave originally had 20 potato chips in his package, and after all these events occurred, he was left with 4 chips."
Response:  On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Kimo has three classes of one hour each, so he spends 3 hours in class per day. On Tuesday and Thursday, he has two classes of two hours each, so he spends 4 hours in class per day. In total, Kimo spends 7 hours in class per day (3 + 4). Now, let's calculate how many hours Kimo spends in class per week: 7 hours/day x 5 days/week = 35 hours/week. And finally, to find out how many hours Kimo spends in class per semester, we multiply the number of weeks in a semester by the number of hours he spends in class per week: 16 weeks x 35 hours/week = 560 hours/semester. Therefore, Kimo spends 560 hours in class per semester.
Response:  We know that each panecillo has 4 inches of length, so there are 300 x 4 = 1200 inches in total for all panecillos. Similarly, each croissant has 6 inches of length, so there are 120 x 6 = 720 inches in total for all croissants. And finally, each baguette has 2 feet of length, so there are 60 x 2 = 120 feet in total for all baguettes. Therefore, the total length of all products horneado is: 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches.
"Response:  The total number of bananas needed for all the monkeys in 2 months is:
Monkeys need = Total number of bananas needed per month x Number of months
= 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas
So, the guardian needs to ask for 700 bananas from the farmer every 2 months."
Response:  We know that Blake ran from one end of the field to the other 15 times, which means he covered a distance of 100 yards x 15 = 1500 yards. Now, we are told that Kelly ran once from one end of the field to the other (a distance of 100 yards), and then decided not to run with Blake anymore. So, she ran back and forth along the remaining 90 yards of the field (which is equal to 90/2 = 45 yards) three more times, for a total distance of 45 + 45 = 90 yards. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both athletes together is 1500 + 90 = 1690 yards. Since Kelly did not run as far as Blake, the winner is Blake, who covered a distance of 1690 - 90 = 1590 yards.
Response:  The total amount that Raphael spent is equal to the number of items he bought multiplied by their prices. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Cost = Number of Items x Price per Item. In this case, Raphael bought 4 bolígrafos (which cost $1,5 each), 2 cuadernos ($4 each), and one ream of paper ($20). Therefore, the total cost that Raphael paid for these items is: Total Cost = 4 x $1,5 + 2 x $4 + $20 = $39. 
Response:  At first, Finn observed 11 renacuajos swimming in the pond. Then, he noticed that 6 were hiding underneath a log and 2 were hiding underneath a rock. So, there are now 11 - 6 = 5 renacuajos visible to Finn in the pond.
Response:  On Monday (el lunes), the tank had 17 feet of water. On Tuesday (el martes), the tank gained 7 more feet of water, so it now has 24 feet of water (17 + 7 = 24). On Wednesday (el miércoles), the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, which means that if the water in the tank on Tuesday was 24 feet deep, then the water on Wednesday would be 24 / 3 = 8 feet deep. Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 8 feet.
Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 stars of sea, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. Therefore, the total number of fish caught is 3 (clownfish). Since Locsin caught fewer than Anakin, he caught 5 stars of sea less than Anakin, which means he caught 5 - 5 = 0 stars of sea. He also caught 3 seahorses less than Anakin, which means he caught 3 - 3 = 0 seahorses. Finally, since he caught 2 clownfish more than Anakin, he caught 2 + 2 = 4 clownfish in total. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  After one month, the price of the bag will increase by 20% of its previous price, which means that after two months, the price will be increased again by another 20%. So, after three months, the new price will be (1.2 x $20) + ($20 x 20%) = $48 + $4 = $52. Similarly, after four months, the price will be (1.2^2 x $52) + ($52 x 20%) = $79.20 + $10.4 = $90.60. And so on...After 36 months, the price will be (1.2^36 x $90.60) + ($90.60 x 20%) = $3,277.20 + $181.2 = $3,458.40. Therefore, after 36 months, the bag of canicas would cost approximately $3,458.40.
Response:  We know that one autito rojo costs $4 and three of them cost $12. A muñeca costs as much as three muñecos coleccionables, so it costs $15. Therefore, all the toys together cost $48 ($12 + $15 + $12).
Response:  If Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she will save $35 per hour that she would have spent working on them. So if it takes her 3 hours to complete her taxes, she will save $105 ($35 x 3 hours). On the other hand, if she hires a tax preparer for $90, she will be out $90. Therefore, if Jackie decides to hire a tax preparer instead of doing her own taxes, she will end up paying $90 - $105 = -$15. This means that she will lose $15 by hiring a tax preparer. 
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has been given a budget of €1500 for her birthday gift. Then, she spent €1090 on the computer itself (máquina), which leaves us with €410 remaining from the initial budget. Next, she purchased an scanner (€157) and a CD player (€74), which cost in total €231. So now, we have €179 left from the original amount. Finally, she bought an printer (€102), leaving us with €77 as the final amount available to buy clothes.
"Response:  If the neighbor gives Sandra 9 eggs every time she watches her daughter, and each egg is needed to make one Spanish flan, then...
Step 1: Calculate how many eggs are needed for all the flans. Since there are 15 flans to be made, we need 15 x 9 = 135 eggs in total.
Step 2: Now, since Sandra needs 3 eggs per flan, she will need 135 / 3 = 45 times to watch her daughter to gather enough eggs to make all the flans. Therefore, Sandra has to watch her daughter 45 times."
Response:  If Seth has double the age of Brooke, then in two years...
"Response:  If Ethel has $8 and Jimmy has $2 more than double of what Ethel has, then we can write an equation as follows:
Jimmy = 2 × (Ethel + $2)
Substituting the value given in the question, we get:
Jimmy = 2 × ($8 + $2)
= 2 × $10
= $20
Therefore, Jimmy has $20."
Response:  If Pancho walks 20 miles per day during the weekdays (Monday to Friday), he will walk a total of 20 x 5 = 100 miles in a week. However, on weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he only walks 10 miles per day, so he will cover a total distance of 10 x 2 = 20 miles in a week. Therefore, the total distance Pancho covers in a week is 100 + 20 = 120 miles.
"Response:  The cost of each item is given as follows:
Sombrero - $25
Chaqueta - 3 times Sombrero = $25 x 3 = $75
Pantalones - half of ($25 + $75) = $25 + $75 / 2 = $100
Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is: $25 (sombrero) + $75 (chaqueta) + $100 (pantalones) = $25 + $75 + $100 = $290
So, each uniform costs $290 in total."
"Response:  The number of legs for each group is as follows:
* Arañas (80): 8 x 80 = 640 legs
* Insectos (90): 6 x 90 = 540 legs
* Invertebrados mutantes (3): 10 x 3 = 30 legs
Total number of legs seen by Jake = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1230 legs."
"Response:  We know that there are four birds in the back of the truck: Sally One, Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four.
Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Granny Red is two years younger than Sally Two. Therefore, Granny Red is 2 + 3 = 5 years old.
Sally Four has the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, who is 8 years old. So, Sally Four is 8 - 4 = 4 years old.
Now we have the ages of all the birds:
Granny Red: 5 years old
Sally Two: 3 + 5 = 8 years old
Sally Four: 4 years old
So, the total age of the four birds is: 5 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 19 years old."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month for her debts. The total amount she needs to pay is equal to half of the minimum payment plus any additional amount she wants to pay. Therefore, the total amount Jessica needs to pay each month can be calculated as follows:
Total Amount = (Minimum Payment x 1.5) + Additional Amount
Now let's find out what are the minimum payments for each debt:
Minimum Payment for Student Loan = $300
Minimum Payment for Credit Card = $200
Minimum Payment for Mortgage = $500
So, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will have to pay:
Total Amount = ($300 x 1.5) + ($200 x 1.5) + ($500 x 1.5) = $900 + $750 + $750 = $2400 per month
Therefore, Jessica pays $2400 per month in all her debts combined. If she makes these payments every month for one year, then she will have paid a total of:
$2400 x 12 months = $28,800 in one year."
"Response: 
1. Billy takes around 1 minute and 30 seconds to prepare one potato (1 + 1/2 = 3 minutes for 60 potatoes).
Therefore, it will take him 3 x 60 = 180 minutes or 3 hours to prepare all 60 potatoes."
"Response:  We know that they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, if they sold one gallon of lemonade, they would have earned $10 (20 x $0.50). Since their profit is $25, we can set up an equation as follows: 
$10 = $25 - x
Where x represents the amount spent on lemons. Solving for x, we get:
x = $25 / ($10 + $2)
= $25 / $12
= $2
So, they spent $2 on lemons."
Response:  We know that there are 240 runners in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of runners who are not Japanese is 160 (240 - 80). Now, we know that 60 of these non-Japanese runners are Chinese. Therefore, the number of Chinese runners is 60/160 = 1/3 or 33%. So, there are 33% of the runners who are Chinese, which means there are 33/100 = 1/3 or 33% of the runners who are girls. Hence, there are 33% of 60 = 20 niñas in the team Chinese.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends 1/4 of his income on rent, which is $1500 (since he earns $6000). Then, he spends 1/3 of his income on fuel for his car, which is $2000 (since he drives 10,000 miles per year at an average cost of $2 per mile). Next, he donates half of what remains to his favorite charity, which is $3000 ($6000 x 1/2 = $3000). Finally, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife for household expenses, leaving him with $8000 in total ($6000 - $1500 - $2000 - $3000 + $200 + $700). Therefore, after all these expenditures and donations, Zaid will have $8000 left over.
"Response:  We know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monica and Monica has four less crabs than Bo. So, if we write it in mathematical notation, we have:
Rani = Monica + (10 - 4) = Monica + 6
Monica = Bo - 4 = 36
So, together they have:
Rani + Monica = 6 + 36 = 42
Therefore, the total number of crabs that Rani, Monica, and Bo have is 42."
Response:  The first week, Lloyd gave 5 hours of classes, so he earned $5 x 5 = $25. In the second week, he gave 8 hours of classes, so he earned $8 x 8 = $64. Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $25 + $64 = $89 during the two weeks.
Response:  The number of candidates running for delegate is 2 (Sarah and John). Since the winner obtained 3/4 of the votes, we can say that the number of votes obtained by the winner is equal to 3/4 x 80 = 60 votes. Therefore, the number of votes obtained by the loser is 80 - 60 = 20 votes.
Response:  We know that Sandra asked for four times more red roses than white clavellines. So, if she requested x red roses, then she asked for 4x white clavellines. Also, we know that she asked for 200 red rose petals, which is five times the number of white clavelline petals. Therefore, the total number of petals Sandra asked for is 4x + 5(4x) = 8x. Since Sandra threatened to switch providers unless she received the missing red roses before 5 pm, we must deliver at least 8x/5 = 160 red rose petals before 5 pm to keep her business.
"Response:  We know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is x years old, then Jean is x + 2 years old. 
We also know that two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age. So, if Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Mark was 5 + (1/2) \* 30 = 5 + 15 = 20 years old. Therefore, Jean is 20 + 2 = 22 years old."
Response:  The team that is well-formed and runs in exactly 55 seconds will have an advantage of (55 - 60) = -5 seconds over the other team. Since there are four runners in each team, this means that the total time difference between the two teams will be 4 x (-5) = -20 seconds. Therefore, the team that is less formed will lose by 20 seconds.
"Response:  The probability of getting an odd number is $ \frac{1}{2} $. Since Jerry threw a six-faced die, there are six possible outcomes: $ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 $. Of these, three are odd numbers ($ 1, 3, 5 $). So the probability of getting an odd number is:
$$ P(\text{odd}) = \frac{\text{number of odd outcomes}}{\text{total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} $$
Now, let's calculate the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers. There are four ways to get two even numbers in a row: $ 2, 2; 3, 3; 4, 4; 5, 5 $. So the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers is:
$$ P(\text{even, consecutive}) = \frac{\text{number of ways to get two even numbers in a row}}{\text{total number of outcomes}} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} $$
Therefore, the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 is:
$$ P(\text{greater than 3}) = 1 - P(\text{odd}) - P(\text{even, consecutive}) = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{3} $$
So the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 is approximately $\frac{1}{3}$ or $33\%$."
Response:  If Jenna recogió la mitad de las manzanas que su madre tiene, then she recogió half of 20 = 10 manzanas. So, together they collected 10 + 10 = 20 manzanas.
Response:  We know that there are 3 jaulas of rats and each jaula has an equal number of rats. So, if we divide 160 by 3, we get 53 rats in total (160 / 3 = 53). Since each jaula has an equal number of rats, we can say that there are 53 rats in each jaula.
"Response:  The amount that Mandy owes to Benedict is $100. If they agreed on an interest rate of 2% per month, then after 3 months, the total amount that Mandy will owe to Benedict can be calculated as follows:

Total Amount = Principal Amount x (Interest Rate/100) x Time Period
= $100 x (2/100) x 3
= $60 + $18 = $78

Therefore, after 3 months, Mandy should give Benedict $78."
Response:  We know that the cost of transporting each sack is $2 and the merchant made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags. So we can write an equation as follows: Total revenue = Number of bags x Price per bag + Transportation cost Total revenue = 30 x Number of bags + 200  Now we have two unknown variables - number of bags and price per bag. To solve for these values, we need to isolate one variable in terms of the other. Let’s start with the first equation: Number of bags = Total revenue / (Price per bag + Transportation cost) Substituting the given values, we get: Number of bags = 30 x 100 + 200 = 500 bags Therefore, the merchant sold 500 bags of wheat.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they spent $20,25 in entrance fees and $4,50 less than in food. So, the total amount of money they spent on food is $15,75 ($20,25 - $4,50). Now, let's calculate how much each person paid for their share of the costs. If they divided all the costs equally among themselves, each person would pay $\frac{Total Cost}{Number of People} = \frac{{1575}}{3} = 525$. Therefore, each friend paid $525 to attend the fair.
Response:  If John collects duraznos for 3 hours, that means he collects them for 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. Since he can collect 2 duraznos per minute, he collects 180 x 2 = 360 duraznos in total during those 3 hours.
Response:  If each pato needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten patos in total, then we need to divide that amount among them. So, each pato would need to eat 0.35 pounds (or 16 oz) of insects per day.
"Response: 
Year 1: Tom plants 10 trees and cuts 2 trees, leaving him with 50 trees.
Year 2-10: He continues to plant and cut trees as before, but now he has fewer trees due to natural death. After 10 years, 30% of his original 50 trees have died, so he has 35 trees left (50 x 0.7 = 35).
Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 35 trees left."
Response:  On Friday morning, there were 18 flamencos of plastic pink placed in Sue's garden. Then, on Saturday morning, 6 (one-third) of them were removed and painted white. So, at that point, there were 12 flamencos of plastic white in Sue's garden. Finally, on Sunday morning, another 18 flamencos of plastic pink were added to the collection, so now there are 30 flamencos of plastic pink + white in total. Therefore, as of Sunday afternoon, there are 30 - 12 = 18 more flamencos of plastic pink than flamencos of plastic white. Answer: 18.
Response:  Violeta needs to buy 5 different colors of crayons, so she will need to spend $2 x 5 = $10 for those. Since she has $20 available, she will have $20 - $10 = $10 left over after buying the crayons. Therefore, she will receive $10 in change.
Response:  The price of one bolígrafo is equal to the price of one lápiz plus the price of one goma de borrar combined. So, if a lápiz costs $1.20 and a goma de borrar costs $0.30, then one bolígrafo will cost $1.50 ($1.20 + $0.30). Therefore, 8 bolígrafos will cost $12.00 ($1.50 x 8).
Response:  If there are 200 pounds of zucchini and 40 restaurants will receive them, each restaurant will get 2 pounds (since 2 pounds is given in the problem). So, the total amount of zucchini distributed among all restaurants is 80 pounds (40 x 2 = 80). This means that 120 pounds of zucchini (200 - 80 = 120) will not be used or wasted.
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23,786 inhabitants in Soda, including 8,417 males and 9,092 females. Therefore, the number of children in Soda is equal to the total population minus the number of males and females. So, we can write:
Children = Total Population - Males - Females
= 23,786 - (8,417 + 9,092)
= 23,786 - 17,509
= 6,277
Therefore, there are approximately 6,277 children in Soda."
Response:  At first, Elaine had 20 cards of Pokemon. Then she got three times more, so after one month she had 60 cards (20 x 3 = 60). In the second month, she lost 20 cards, so now she has 40 cards (60 - 20 = 40). And in the third month, she doubled her collection again, so now she has 80 cards (40 x 2 = 80) in total. Therefore, Elaine currently has 80 cards of Pokemon.
Response:  We know that Mark reviews 1000 sentences for both publications every week and receives $0.05 per sentence from Publication A and twice that amount from Publication B. Therefore, Mark earns $500 from Publication A and $1000 from Publication B in one week. So, he makes a total of $1500 per week.
"Response: 
1. In the morning, he takes 5 baldes of water = 5 x 5 = 25 liters.
2. In the afternoon, he takes 6 baldes of water = 6 x 5 = 30 liters.
So in total, he takes 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water per day."
"Response:  If John earns $2000 per week and receives the prize money of $5000 once, then his total income for the year will be:

$2000 x 52 weeks = $104,000 (total income)

Now, let's calculate the increase in his salary due to the prize money:

$104,000 x 5% = $5200 (increase in salary)

So, John's total income for the year including the prize money is:

$104,000 + $5200 = $109,200 (answer)"
Response:  If Josie has 10 acres of land and each acre produces 5 toneladas of grapes per year, then she will have 10 x 5 = 50 toneladas of grapes per year. Since each tonelada of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, then she will have 50 x 2 = 100 barrels of wine per year. Therefore, her farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.
Response:  We know that Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch and used 2 pieces of cheese in each sandwich. He also had breakfast three days a week with a tortilla made from scrambled eggs and cheese, using one piece of cheese per tortilla. Additionally, he prepared a large dish of macaroni and cheese to last several meals and used eight pieces of cheese in it. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pieces of cheese Carl consumed as follows: Lunch (2 x 5 = 10), Breakfast (1 x 3 = 3), Macaroni and Cheese (8). So, Carl consumed a total of 13 pieces of cheese during the given period.
"Response: 
Janet had initially 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had in total 32 pens (22 + 10).
Then, she bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens each, so she got 54 blue pens (6 x 9 = 54).
Finally, she bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens each, so she got 12 red pens (2 x 6 = 12).
In summary, Janet has now 32 + 54 + 12 = 100 pens."
"Response:  If Brinley has already taken five exams and obtained the following scores:
Exam 1: 89
Exam 2: 71
Exam 3: 92
Exam 4: 100
Exam 5: 86
Then, to get an average of 93 in six exams, we need to find out what score he needs in the sixth exam.
We can calculate this as follows:
Average = (Total score) / (Number of exams)
= (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5
= 455 / 5
= 91
So, Brinley needs to obtain at least a 91 in his sixth exam to achieve a total score of 93."
Response:  Michael rode his bike for four weeks, covering 25 km each time, so he covered a total distance of 100 km during that period (4 weeks x 5 rides/week x 25 km/ride = 100 km). Then, he reduced the number of times he rode per week to twice, but increased the distance he covered each time to 60 km. So, in the next three weeks, he covered a total distance of 720 km (3 weeks x 2 rides/week x 60 km/ride = 720 km). Therefore, in total, Michael covered 820 km (100 km + 720 km = 820 km) while riding his bike.
Response:  We know that each bar of chocolate weighs twice as much as each apple slice. So if one bar of chocolate weighs 40g, two bars would weigh 80g (since they double in weight). Now, let's find out how many apples are in the bag. Since there are 25 bars of chocolate and 80 apple slices, there must be 80/2 = 40 apples in the bag. Therefore, the total weight of the bag is 40 x 40 = 1600 grams. 
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 pastries. On Tuesday, she went to another store and bought three times as many pastries, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 pastries. On Wednesday, she went to yet another store and bought 5 times as many pastries as she had bought on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 pastries in total. Therefore, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 pastries over the course of the three days.
"Response:  We know that veinte docenas of mugs cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen dishes that sell for $6000 each. So we can write an equation as follows:
Cost of 20 mugs = Total cost of half a dozen dishes - $1200
Now let's solve for the cost of one mug:
Cost of one mug = Total cost of half a dozen dishes - $1200 / 20
= $3000 - $60 / 20
= $240 per mug
Therefore, the cost of each mug is $240."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting and cutting grass. So, after she finishes babysitting and cutting grass, her total amount of money will be: $10 + ($5 x 4) = $10 + $20 = $30. Now, let's calculate how many times Sara needs to cut the grass to have enough money for the jacket and shoes: $30 / $20 = 1.5 times. Therefore, Sara needs to cut the grass 1.5 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.
"Response:  We know that the total number of eggs collected each day is 42. Since there are more white than red gallinas, we can say that the number of red gallinas is less than half of the total number of gallinas. So, if there are x red gallinas, then the total number of gallinas is 2x + 10 (since there are 10 white gallinas). Now, since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and there are x red gallinas, we can write:

x/2 = 42

Solving for x, we get:

x = 21

So, Jerry has 21 red gallinas in his coop."
"Response:  If he walks for x hours at a speed of 3 miles per hour, then his distance traveled is given by the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled and t is time taken to travel that distance. Since we are asked how many hours he spends walking, we can set up the equation:
d = rt
Now, we know that the park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles wide and 6 miles long. So, if Gary walks along the edge of the park, his distance traveled will be equal to the length of the park multiplied by his speed (which is 3 miles per hour). Therefore, his distance traveled can be calculated as follows:
d = 1.5 miles x 6 miles/hour = 9 miles
Since he walks for x hours, we can solve for x using the equation above:
x = d / r
Substituting the value of d from above into this equation gives us:
x = 9 miles / 3 miles/hour = 3 hours
Therefore, Gary spends 3 hours walking around the park."
Response:  On day 1, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. On day 2, he counted 50 more customers than the previous day, so he counted 150 customers (100 + 50). Therefore, on day 3, he counted 300 customers (150 + 150). So, the number of customers that Sloane counted on the third day was 300.
Response:  We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. So after 4 minutes, the small pool will have lost 4 x 4 = 16 gallons of water. Now we need to find out how much water the big pool has gained in those same 4 minutes. Since it had four times as much water as the small pool initially, and now it has four times as much water as the small pool plus the amount of water lost by the small pool (which is 16 gallons), we can set up an equation: Big Pool Water = Small Pool Water + (Small Pool Water x Loss Rate). Substituting values gives us: Big Pool Water = 20 - 16 = 4 gallons. Therefore, the small pool currently holds 16 gallons of water.
Response:  To find out how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford her shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost of these items ($350,00) by her hourly wage ($8). So, we have: Number of hours = Total Cost / Hourly Wage $350,00 ÷ $8 = 43,75 hours Therefore, Lori needs to work for approximately 43.75 hours before she can afford her shoes and belt.
"Response:  If Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount, then the total amount she needs to pay is:
$2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2200
If Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance will be:
$2200 - ($165 x 12) = $1735
So, the saldo that Janeth will have to pay to Janeth at the end of those 12 months is $1735."
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 daisies more than roses. So, if we add both numbers together, we get... (insert calculation here) Total number of flowers in the vase = 4 + (7 - 4) = 15. Therefore, there are 15 floral in the vase.
"Response:  We know that:
Adrian is three times older than Harriet. So, Adrian's age = 3H (Harriet's age)
Zack has half of Harriet's age. So, Zack's age = H/2 (Harriet's age)
Now we are given that Harriet is now 21 years old. So, we can write:
Adrian's age = 3H = 3(21) = 63
Zack's age = H/2 = 21/2 = 10.5
Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet and Zack after 3 years is:
Average age = (63 + 10.5 + 21)/3 = 94.5
So, the answer is 94.5."
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score. So, Yuri scored 68 + (10/2) = 68 + 5 = 73 points. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Now we are left with 251 - 68 - 73 - 85 = 93 points for Jojo. Therefore, Jojo scored 93 points.
Response:  Since it takes her 10 minutes to finish one crucigrama and 5 minutes to finish one sudoku, she spends 15 minutes in total (10 + 5) on these games. If she resolved 3 crucigramas during the weekend, then she spent 3 x 15 = 45 minutes on them. Similarly, if she resolved 8 sudokus, then she spent 8 x 5 = 40 minutes on them. Therefore, she dedicated 45 + 40 = 85 minutes to solving puzzles during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, there are now 36 liters (120 - 90) left in the tank. Then, we learn that she collected double the amount of rainwater as was remaining in the tank. Therefore, if she collected x liters of rainwater, then there would be 3x liters of water left in the tank after collecting it. Thus, the final quantity of water in the tank is 36 + 3x = 78 liters.
Response:  If Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 petunias less than geraniums, then he plants 50 petunias (since 90 - 40 = 50). So, in total, Andy plants 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.
Response:  The company spent $15,000 in advertising during one year and then spent $5,000 (the third part of $15,000) for another year. So, the total amount that the company spent on advertising is: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.
Response:  If Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours and pays $30 per hour, then he will pay $90 ($30 x 3) for using the canoe. Similarly, if Benji uses the banana-shaped kite for 5 hours and pays $18 per hour, then he will pay $90 ($18 x 5) for using the kite. Therefore, in total, Carlos and Benji will have to pay $180 ($90 + $90).
Response:  If it takes half of the time to travel from New Jersey to Rochester in an automobile than it does in a bus, then it will take 3 days to go there and come back again. So if he plans to go to Rochester in a bus for 6 days, he will spend 9 days overall (including the return trip). Therefore, the correct answer is 9 days.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of cards that James has in his deck. We know he has 30 fire-type cards, 20 grass-type cards, and 40 water-type cards, so the total number of cards is:
Total = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90
Now, let's find out how many water-type cards James has after losing 8 cards. We know he lost 8 water-type cards, so the new number of water-type cards is:
New Water = Total - Lost Water = 90 - 8 = 82
Next, we want to find out what percentage of the remaining cards are water-type cards. To do this, we divide the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards:
Percentage = New Water / Total = 82 / 90 = 0.90 or 90%
So, there is a 90% chance that a card chosen at random from James' deck will be a water-type card."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the burrito without any additional items. The base price is $6.50 + tax (let's assume 8% sales tax = $0.52). So, the total cost without add-ons is $6.50 + $0.52 = $7.02. Now, let's calculate the cost of each additional item: Carne de res ($2.00) + Queso ($1.00) + Palta ($1.00) + Salsa 1 ($0.25) + Salsa 2 ($0.25) = $4.25. Therefore, the total cost with all add-ons is $7.02 + $4.25 = $11.27. Finally, if he decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, that would bring the total cost to $11.27 + $3.00 = $14.27. So, he still owes $4.27 after using his gift card.
"Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mom can locate half of them in the same time, then...

1. Kalinda adds 4 pieces/minute x 360 pieces = 1440 pieces total (including those already located)
2. Her mom locates half of these pieces in the same time = 720 pieces located so far
3. To find out how many hours it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the number of remaining pieces (1440 - 720 = 720) by Kalinda's adding speed (4 pieces/minute):
720 / 4 pieces/minute = 180 minutes or 3 hours
Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom approximately 3 hours to assemble the 360-piece puzzle."
"Response: 
After two months, 30% of the original plants were ready for harvest, so there were 30% x 120 = 36 plants left to mature.
When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining plants had matured, so there were 36 + (3/4) x 36 = 57 plants still not ready for harvest.
Therefore, after two weeks, 57 sandias remained unharvested."
Response:  The total cost of the fleet is given as $12 x 20,000 = $240,000. Then, there are taxes of 10% of $240,000 = $24,000 and registration fees of $1000 per vehicle x 12 vehicles = $12,000. So, the total amount paid by Mark is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.
Response:  On Monday (lunes), Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so together they collected 7 + 5 = 12 shells. On Tuesday (martes), Kylie collected twice as many shells as she collected on Monday, so she collected 2 x 12 = 24 shells. Therefore, Kylie collected 24 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 hormigas in the garden and Dax found half of them, then there are 50 / 2 = 25 hormigas left in the garden. Now we need to find out how many bichos (insects) there are in total. Since it was mentioned that there were as many bichos as hormigas, so if there are 25 hormigas left, then there are also 25 bichos left in the garden. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 25 + 25 = 50 insects.
"Response: 
Step 1: We know that 36 pingüinos were initially taking sunbaths on the ice.
Step 2: One-third of them (i.e., 12) jumped into the ocean and started swimming. So, the number of pingüinos remaining on the ice is now 36 - 12 = 24.
Step 3: Another one-third of them (i.e., 12 again) headed towards the cave to eat. Therefore, the number of pingüinos still sunbathing is now 24 - 12 = 12.
So, there are 12 pingüinos left taking sunbaths on the ice after all the movements."
Response:  If Steve eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend and consumes 6 per day, then he needs to produce 12 tomatoes per day (twice 6). Now, if each branch can produce 3 tomatoes per week, how many branches does Steve need to have in order to produce 12 tomatoes per day? We can divide 12 by 3 to find out that Steve needs 4 branches to meet his daily demand for tomatoes. So, the answer is 4 branches.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend will eat 4 slices of pizza. Since the pizzas come in 8-slice portions, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John should buy:

20 / 8 = 2.5
So, John should buy 3 pizzas (since you can't buy a fraction of a pizza)."
Response:  If Ram uses five empty ink cartridges to fill one full ink cartridge, then he will have 5/1 = 5 full ink cartridges after mixing the ink. Since he buys 25 bolígrafos initially, and he can make 5 full ink cartridges from them, then he will end up with 25 - 5 = 20 new bolígrafos. Therefore, Ram ends up having 20 new bolígrafos in total.
Response:  If Johnny took his $20 and added $10 more, he would have $30. Then, if he invested this amount of money and it tripled in one year, he would have $90 after one year. Therefore, Johnny had $90 after one year.
Response:  We know that Mary has two years less than Joan, so Joan is five years older than Mary. And we also know that Jessa is five years more than Joan, so Jessa is ten years more than Mary. Now, if Jessa has 20 years, then Mary has 10 + 5 = 15 years old and Joan has 5 + 2 = 7 years old. So, the total age of the three girls is 15 + 7 + 20 = 42 years.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 1000 students in the school hallway. After some of them left through one of the three exits (A, B or C), we are told that 30% of the remaining students left through exit A and 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B. So, the number of students who remained in the hallway after this is:

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hallway.
After 30% of the students left through exit A, there were 700 students left (since 30% of 1000 is 300).
After 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, there were 420 students left (since 3/5 of 700 is 420).
So, the total number of students who left through all three exits (A, B, and C) is:

700 + 420 = 1120

Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is:

1120 - 300 = 820

So, there were 820 students who left through exit C."
Response:  We know that James has 6 more caramels than Robert, so James has x + 6 = 72 caramels (where x is the number of caramels Robert has). Since John has twice as many caramels as Robert, John has 2x = 144 caramels. Now we can see that John has 144 - 72 = 72 more caramels than James, so John has 72 more caramels than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they have three books to read. If both of them read their own books and each other's books, then they will have read a total of 6 books (2 + 1 + 3). So, the answer is 6.
Response:  We know that there are 5 people who were friends with Mike through correspondence and that 2 of them stopped being his friend. So, in total, he had 3 friends left. Each person sends 2 letters per week, which means that Mike receives 6 letters per week (since each letter is 5 pages long). To calculate how many hours Mike spends writing per week, we need to divide the number of letters he receives by the time it takes him to write one page. Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 1 hour and 10 minutes (or 60 minutes) writing per week for each friend he has left. Therefore, if he has 3 friends left, he spends a total of 3 x 60 = 180 minutes or 3 hours and 40 minutes writing per week.
"Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 minutes in his phone plan and he uses them as follows:

* Daily calls to his boss (15 min/day x 30 days = 450 min)
* Additional calls to other people (300 min)

Total used minutes = 450 + 300 = 750 min

So, Jason has 1000 - 750 = 250 min left without using them this month."
"Response: 
Griffin had 24 patatas fritas at first and then he lost 5 to Kyle. So, Griffin has 19 patatas fritas left after Kyle took them. Then, Billy doubled the number of patatas that Kyle took from Griffin, so Billy took 38 patatas fritas (2 times 19). After this, Ginger gave Griffin some of her own patatas fritas, but we don't know how many she gave him. Finally, Colby took 3 patatas fritas away from Griffin. Therefore, the total number of patatas fritas that Griffin had at the end was 27. Now, let's calculate how many patatas fritas Ginger gave him:
Ginger gave Griffin a ""puñado"" of her patatas fritas, which means a handful in Spanish. A handful is usually around 5-6 items, depending on their size. Since Ginger had more patatas fritas than Griffin initially, let's assume that Ginger gave Griffin 6 patatas fritas (since it's a rough estimate). So, the total number of patatas fritas that Ginger gave Griffin is:
6 + 19 = 25
Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 25 patatas fritas in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. If we assume that each snail represents x fish, then we can write an equation based on this assumption:

Number of fish in first aquarium = 4x
Number of fish in second aquarium = 32x

Now, according to the problem statement, the difference between the number of fish in both aquariums is equal to twice the number of fish in the first aquarium. So, we can write:

Difference between number of fish in two aquariums = 2(number of fish in first aquarium)

Substituting the equations above, we get:

2x = x + 16x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 18x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, there are 9 fish in the first aquarium and 18 fish in the second aquarium."

Firstly, we need to calculate how much time the makeup artist spends working with Jean per week. Since she works 4 times a week and each session takes 6 hours, she spends 24 hours per week working with him.
Next, we need to calculate how much money the makeup artist charges per hour. Based on the information provided in the question, she charges $250 per hour. Therefore, her total earnings per week are $250 x 24 = $6,000.
Now, let's calculate how much money Jean pays the makeup artist over the course of the filming. Since the movie lasts for 5 weeks, Jean pays the makeup artist for 5 x 4 = 20 sessions. Each session takes 6 hours, so he pays her for 20 x 6 = $120 per session. Therefore, his total payment to the makeup artist is $120 x 20 = $2,400.
Finally, since the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount after the movie is finished, Jean saves $240 ($2,400 x 10%). So, his final payment to the makeup artist is $2,400 - $240 = $2,160."
Response:  We know that Isabella spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $86 on the party. Since she divided it equally among her father and mother, each person paid $86 / 2 = $43.
"Response:  The number of bags of onions is given as ""4"". Each bag weighs 50 pounds, so the total weight of all the bags is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Since each pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost of all the onions is 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300. Therefore, the chef spent $300 on onions."
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more than her sister, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 galletas (since her sister ate 5). Then, on Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times more than her sister, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 galletas (since her sister ate 13). Therefore, Sue consumed a total of 20 + 26 = 46 galletas more than her sister. Since each galette has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 46 x 200 = 9,200 calories more than her sister.
