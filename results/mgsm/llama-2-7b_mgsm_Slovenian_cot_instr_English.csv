"Response: 
Janet produces 16 eggs per day. She sells each egg for $2 at the farmer's market. So, she earns $32 from selling eggs every day (16 x $2 = $32)."
Response:  We need two blue threads and half of white threads. So we have to divide the total number of threads into these groups. The ratio is 2:1 (blue : white). Therefore, if there are x white threads, then there will be 2x blue threads. To find out how many threads are needed, we can multiply both numbers: 2x = 3x/2. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. So, we need 6 violets and 6 whites threads.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then invested $50,000 in repairs. This means he spent a total of $130,000 on the house ($80,000 + $50,000). Now, since the value of the house increased by 150%, we can calculate the new value of the house as follows: New Value = Old Value x 150% = $130,000 x 150% = $195,000 So, Josh earned a profit of $65,000 ($195,000 - $130,000) from buying and renovating the house.
"Response:  If James runs three sprints per day and each sprint is 60 meters long, he will run a total of:

3 sprints/day x 60 m/sprint = 180 m/day

So, in one week (7 days), James will run a total distance of:

180 m/day x 7 days = 1260 m/week

Therefore, James runs a total distance of 1260 meters per week."
Response:  We know that each chicken needs to be fed three bowls of mixed feed containing seeds, grains and vegetables to stay healthy. The morning feeding consists of 15 bowls for the entire flock of chickens. In the afternoon, an additional 25 bowls are given to the chickens. To determine how many bowls of food the last batch of chickens need during the day, we can use the following formula: Number of bowls = Total number of chickens / Number of chickens per feeding. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of bowls = 20 chickens / 3 chickens per feeding = 6.67 bowls So, the last batch of chickens needs approximately 6-7 bowls of food during the day.
"Response:  If one kozarec costs $5 and the second kozarec costs only 60% of the first kozarec (i.e., $3), then we can calculate the cost of each additional kozarec as follows:
Cost = $5 + ($3 x number of kozarcev)
So if Kylar wants to buy 16 kozarcev, he will have to pay:
Cost = $5 + ($3 x 16) = $5 + $48 = $53
Therefore, Kylar must pay $53 for his 16 kozarcev."
"Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Toulouse has x sheep, Charleston has 2x sheep, and Seattle has 4x sheep, we can write an equation:

Toulouse = 2Charleston = 4Seattle

Now, we are asked how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep. Using the equation above, we can substitute Seattle's value of 20 into the equation to get:

Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 2(2x) + 4(20)
= 2(2x) + 80

Solving for x (the number of sheep Toulouse has), we get:

x = 16

So, Toulouse has 16 sheep, Charleston has 32 sheep, and Seattle has 80 sheep."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can normally transfer 2 GB per minute. So, in total, it would take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to transfer the entire dataset of 200 GB. However, due to the forced update installation, she has to restart the process from the beginning, which takes an additional 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time required for Carla to transfer the dataset is 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John travels at a speed of 100 km/h for the first two hours (2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes). Therefore, he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/h x 120 minutes = 12000 meters or 12 km.  Next, during the next two hours (from hour 3 to hour 4), John travels at a speed of 30 mph, which is equal to 48 km/h. So, he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 48 km/h x 60 minutes = 2880 meters or 2.9 km. Finally, from hour 4 to the end of the journey (in 4 hours), John travels at a speed of 80 km/h, covering a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 80 km/h x 4 hours = 3200 meters or 3.2 km. Now, let's add up all these distances: Total distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2 + Distance 3 = 12 km + 2.9 km + 3.2 km = 17.1 km. Therefore, John is 17.1 kilometers away from his home after four hours of driving.
Response:  If Eliza works for the first 40 hours of each week and is paid $10 per hour, her total weekly pay would be:  Total weekly pay = Number of hours worked x Hourly wage  Total weekly pay = 40 hours x $10/hour = $400  Now, let's find out how much she earns from overtime work: Overtime pay = Regular pay x Multiplier (which is 1.2 in this case) Overtime pay = $400 x 1.2 = $480 So, Eliza's total weekly pay including overtime would be: Total weekly pay including overtime = Regular pay + Overtime pay Total weekly pay including overtime = $400 + $480 = $880 Therefore, if Eliza worked 45 hours that week, her total weekly pay would be: Total weekly pay = Total regular pay + Overtime pay Total weekly pay = $880 + $480 = $1360
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 transmissions. If we multiply this number by three, we get 180 transmissions in the second month (since the number of transmissions tripled). Then, if we subtract 30% of that amount from the total, we get 126 transmissions in the third month (since 30% of 180 is equal to 54). Therefore, the total number of transmissions over the course of three months was 60 + 180 - 54 = 126.
Response:  First, we know that Toula bought 3 ducat of croissants which cost $68 for one ducat. So, she paid $68 x 3 = $194 for the croissants.  Next, we know that she also bought 2 ducat of mini cookies which cost $80 for one ducat. So, she paid $80 x 2 = $160 for the mini cookies. Finally, we know that she bought 6 ducat of mini sandwiches which cost $55 for one ducat. So, she paid $55 x 6 = $330 for the mini sandwiches. Therefore, the total amount that Toula spent is $194 + $160 + $330 = $684.
Response:  First year: * 90 dollars for planting + 3 dollars for maintenance = 93 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) Second year: * 93 dollars from previous year + 3 dollars for maintenance = 96 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) Third year: * 96 dollars from previous year + 3 dollars for maintenance = 99 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) Fourth year: * 99 dollars from previous year + 3 dollars for maintenance = 102 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) Fifth year: * 102 dollars from previous year + 3 dollars for maintenance = 105 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) Sixth year: * 105 dollars from previous year + 3 dollars for maintenance = 108 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) Seventh year: * 108 dollars from previous year + 3 dollars for maintenance = 111 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) Eighth year: * 111 dollars from previous year + 3 dollars for maintenance = 114 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) Ninth year: * 114 dollars from previous year + 3 dollars for maintenance = 117 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) Tenth year: * 117 dollars from previous year + 3 dollars for maintenance = 120 dollars total revenue from lemons (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon) It takes approximately ten years for the tree to start making money.
Response:  We know that Melanie sold 3/4 of her rabbits to Mrs. Green and 1/2 of what was left to Mr. Red. So, if she had x rabbits at first, then after selling 3/4 of them to Mrs. Green, she had (x - 3/4) rabbits left. Then, she sold another 1/2 of these remaining rabbits to Mr. Red, so now she has (x - 3/4) - 1/2 = x/2 rabbits left. Therefore, Melanie started with x rabbits.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students, 4 are enrolled in modern dance (20%). Out of the remaining 16 students, 5 are enrolled in jazz dance (31.25%). This means that 9 students are left over to be enrolled in hip-hop dance (58.75%). So, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 58.75%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the price of each item after a 2.5% and 1.2% increase in the market price respectively. For Nakit, the calculation would be: $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125. And for Electronic Gadgets, it would be: $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,360. Now, if the trader chooses to buy either of these items at their new prices, they will have a total value of: Nakit: $5,125 x 1 = $5,125. Electronic Gadgets: $8,360 x 1 = $8,360. Therefore, if the trader wants to maximize their profit at the end of the month, they should choose to buy the Electronic Gadgets, which has a higher value than the Nakit even after considering the price increases. So, the answer is: The trader should buy Electronic Gadgets.
"Response: 
Day 1:
* Vlak A travels west for 80 miles = 80/60 = 1.33 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
* Vlak B travels east for 80 miles = 80/60 = 1.33 hours

Total time traveled by both trains = 2 x 1.33 hours = 2.66 hours

Day 2:
* Vlak A travels north for 240 km = 240/100 = 2.4 hours
* Vlak B travels south for 240 km = 240/100 = 2.4 hours

Total time traveled by both trains = 2 x 2.4 hours = 4.8 hours

Therefore, the total distance traveled by each train in two days is:
Distance traveled by Vlak A = 80 + 240 = 320 miles / 60 = 5.33 hours
Distance traveled by Vlak B = 80 + 240 = 320 miles / 60 = 5.33 hours

So, the answer to the question is 5.33 hours."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jill earns as an English teacher per month. We know that she works for 50 weeks in a year and teaches for 35 hours per week, so her monthly income from teaching is: 35 hours/week x 4 weeks/month = 140 hours/month x $20/hour = $2800/month As for her salary as a cheerleading coach, we are told that she works 15 hours per week on average. So, her monthly income from coaching is: 15 hours/week x 4 weeks/month = 60 hours/month x $15/hour = $900/month Now, let's add up Jill's total annual income: $2800 (teaching) + $900 (coaching) = $3700/year
"Response:  If Claire eats 3 eggs per day and has breakfast every day for 4 weeks (28 days), then she will have eaten a total of:

3 eggs/day x 28 days = 84 eggs in one month
84 eggs / 4 weeks = 21 eggs per week

So, over 4 weeks, Claire will have eaten a total of 85 eggs (21 eggs/week x 4 weeks)."
"Response:  If she walked for the first four miles in one hour, then her average speed during that time was $4 \div 4 = 1$ mile/hour.  For the next two miles, she walked at the same rate, so her average speed over those two miles was also $1$ mile/hour.  Therefore, her total distance traveled is:
$$ Distance = Speed \times Time $$
In this case, the distance traveled is:
$$ Distance = 1 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 $$
kilometers. To find out how fast she needs to walk to cover the remaining distance of $12 - 10 = 2$ kilometers in one hour, we can divide the remaining distance by the time she has left:
$$ Rate = Distance / Time $$
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
$$ Rate = 2 \div 2 = 1 $$
So, Marissa needs to walk at an average rate of $1$ kilometer per hour to cover the remaining distance in one hour."
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that is two-thirds water and we want to add 15 liters of grapefruit juice that is three-quarters water. When we mix them together, we will get 16 liters of mixed juice (since 3/4 + 2/3 = 7/8). Then, when we take out 1 liter of the mixed juice, there will be 15 liters left (since 16 - 1 = 15). So, the amount of water remaining in the original 24 liters is 15 / 24 = 62.5%.
Response:  We know that Raymon is six years older than Samantha, so he was born when she was six years younger. Then we are told that Raymon had a son at age 23, and now Samantha is 31 years old. So if Raymon was born when Samantha was six years younger, then Samantha must have been born six years after Raymon. Therefore, Raymon's son was born 27 years ago (6 + 23 = 29).
Response:  We know that in total, there are 8 customers who bought DVDs from Billy on Tuesday. If we break it down like this:  The first 3 customers bought one each (1 + 1 + 1 = 3), and the next two customers bought two each (2 x 2 = 4). So far, we have 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs sold. Finally, the last three customers did not buy any DVDs, so they don't count towards our total of 8 customers. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.
"Response:  If the candle shrinks by 2 cm every hour, then it will be shorter by:

2 cm/hour x 5 hours = 10 cm

So, after 5 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00), the candle will be 10 cm shorter."
Response:  We know that Kyle bought the best-selling book for $19.50 with a discount of 25%. So we can calculate the original price as follows: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage) Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) Original Price = $24.80 Therefore, the original price of the book was $24.80.
Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of these items. So we can write an equation based on this information:  Total cost = Price of chicken feed + Price of milk + Price of apples + Price of peas  Total cost = 12 + 3 + 1.50 + x  Where x is the number of bags of peas that Marie bought. Since each bag costs $8.50, we can substitute this value into our equation:  Total cost = 12 + 3 + 1.50 + 8.50  Total cost = 50  Now we have two equations and two variables (Total cost and Number of bags of peas). Solving for Number of bags of peas, we get:  Number of bags of peas = Total cost / 8.50  Number of bags of peas = 50 / 8.50  Number of bags of peas = 6  Therefore, Marie bought 6 bags of peas.
"Response:  We know that Mis...

Answer: $73.50$

Explanation:
Miška has bought three shirts, which cost $16.50$, $22.50$, and $22.50$ respectively. Therefore, the total cost of the shirts is:

$$3 \times 16.50 = 49.50$$

We also know that Misja has bought three pairs of shoes, which cost $42.00$. Therefore, the total cost of the shoes is:

$$3 \times 42.00 = 126.00$$

So, the total amount of money Misja has spent on clothes is:

$$49.50 + 126.00 = 175.50$$

Therefore, the answer is $175.50$."
"Response: 
Cynthia buys one portion of ice cream every evening at $4 per portion. Since she does this for 60 days, she will have bought a total of:

$$ NumberOfPortions = 60 \times 1 = 60 $$ portions of ice cream.

Since each portion costs $4, the total amount spent on ice cream is:

$$ TotalCost = 60 \times 4 = 240 $$ dollars."
Response:  We know that Henry has traveled 60 miles and he stopped twice during his journey. The first stop was after 20 miles, which means he traveled for another 40 miles before stopping again. So, the distance between the two stops is 40 miles. Therefore, the answer is 40 kilometers (or 25 miles).
Response:  We know that Gloria has $50 to spend and she is considering two pairs of shoes - one pair costs $33 and another pair costs twice as much as the first pair. So, if the first pair costs $33, then the second pair costs $66 ($2 \* $33). Now we need to find out how many dollars are left after buying both pairs of shoes. The total cost of both pairs is $99 ($66 + $33), so we have $50 - $99 = -$49 left. Therefore, Gloria cannot afford to buy both pairs of shoes with her budget of $50.
Response:  We know that Darrell is currently 7 years older than Allen (Darrell = 7 + 11 = 18). So, their combined age now is 162 - 11 = 151 years old. If we want to find out how much older Allen will be after 10 years, we can simply add 10 to their current age difference: Allen will be 10 years older than Darrell, which means he will be 18 + 10 = 28 years old.
Response:  First friend says there are 80 marbles in the bag. Second friend says that is 20 more than half of the first friend's number, so if there were 40 marbles initially (half of 80), then there would be 60 marbles now (20 + 40 = 60). Third friend says that is 25% more than the initial amount, which means that the total number of marbles in the bag is 75 (60 + 15 = 75). Therefore, their average estimate is 75.
"Response:  If John has 10 dogs and each dog needs 0.5 hours of exercise per day, then the total time spent exercising all the dogs is:

$$ \text {Total time for all dogs} = \text{Number of dogs} \times \text{Time per dog per day} $$

$$ = 10 \times 0.5 = 5 \text{ hours per day} $$

Now, let's find out how many hours John will spend taking care of his dogs per week:

$$ \text {Weekly time for dog care} = \text{Total time per day} \times \text{Number of days in a week} $$

$$ = 5 \times 7 = 35 \text{ hours per week} $$

So, John will spend $35$ hours per week taking care of his $10$ dogs."
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and 30 of them are gold coins. So, we can write an equation: Gold coins = Total coins x Fraction of gold coins. In this case, fraction of gold coins is 30/110 or 0.2727... (since there are no decimals). Now, we need to convert this decimal to a percentage. To do so, divide the decimal by 100: 0.2727... = 27.27% So, Gretchen has 27.27% of her coins made of gold, which means she has 30 / 100 x 27.27 = 81 zlatih kovancev. Therefore, the answer is 81.
Response:  We know that Aaron has more than two dragons and less than five times as many as Raymond. So, if Raymond has 40 dragons, then Aaron has at least 20 but fewer than 80 dragons (since he has more than twice as many as Raymond). Therefore, Siobhan has fewer than 30 dragons (since she has fewer than both Aaron and Raymond).
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, which means he scored an average of 1 point per minute (4/20 = 1).  Now, in the next 20 minutes, he increased his scoring rate by 25%. This means that for every minute he played after the initial 20 minutes, he scored 1 + (25% of 1) = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25 points. So, in total, Mike scored 4 + 1.25 = 5.25 points in the entire 40-minute game.
Response:  If Terry has two yogurts per day and there are 30 days in a month, then he will have 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts in one month. Since each yogurt costs $5, Terry will spend $60 x 5 = $300 for all the yogurts in one month. Therefore, Terry spends $300 for 60 yogurts in one month.
Response:  We know that John has sold all of his Lego sets and used the money to buy eight video games for $20 each. This means he spent a total of $160 ($8 x $20). So, after buying the video games, he had $160 - $160 = $0 left. Therefore, John still has 13 Lego sets.
Response:  On day 1, he runs for 3 hours (since it is his first day and he only has to run half of what he will do in subsequent days). So, he covers a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 km.  On days 2 and 3, he runs for 2 hours each day, so he covers a total distance of 2 x 60 = 120 km. Therefore, John covers a total distance of 180 + 120 = 300 km per week.
Response:  If she can run four times faster than walking speed and walk at half the speed of running, then we know that her running speed is $4 \times 5 = 20$ km/h and her walking speed is $\frac{1}{2} \times 5 = 2.5$ km/h.  Now, if she spends $3/4$ of her time running and $1/4$ of her time walking, then she runs for a total of $\frac{3}{4} \times 6 = 4.5$ hours and walks for $\frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5$ hours.  Therefore, she covers a distance of $4.5 \times 20 = 90$ km while running and $1.5 \times 2.5 = 37.5$ km while walking, for a total distance covered of $90 + 37.5 = 127.5$ km.
Response:  We know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone. So if Suzy's iPhone is x years old, then Ben's iPhone is 2x years old. Now we are told that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is (4 \* 2x) = 8x years old. Since Brandon's iPhone is eight times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can conclude that Brandon's iPhone is 8x - 4 = 4x years old. Finally, since Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, we can say that Ben's iPhone is 4/4 = 1x years old. So, Brandon's iPhone is 4x - 1 = 3x years old.
Response:  First, we know that when Polly threw the gold coin, it could reach the dragon 400 meters away, which was within the range of its flames. Then, when she held the sapphire, she could throw the golden ball three times farther than when she didn't hold any stone. Therefore, if Polly held the sapphire and threw the golden ball, it would be able to reach the dragon 1200 meters away (3 x 400 meters).
Response:  If Babica has 5 jars of jam and she cuts each jar into 8 pieces, then she will have 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of jam.  Now, if she puts 40 pieces of jam on the table for the guests to serve themselves, and they eat all of it (leaving none), then there are no leftovers. So, the number of pieces of jam that the guests took is equal to the total number of pieces of jam available, which is 40. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that one serving of potato chips contains 250 calories. If we have 300 grams of potato chips (which is equal to 300/100 = 3 portions), then the total number of calories from potato chips would be:  Total calories from potato chips = Number of portions x Calories per portion = 3 x 250 = 750 calories. Now, if you want to calculate how many grams of potato chips you can eat based on your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories and the fact that you have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to use the following formula: Grams of potato chips you can eat = Daily calorie goal - Already consumed calories / Calories per portion = 2000 - 1800 / 750 = approximately 46 grams. So, you can eat around 46 grams of potato chips based on the information provided in the question.
Response:  If he can make 10 candles from one kilogram of beeswax and each candle costs $2, then he will have made $20 (10 x $2). However, if he sells each candle for $2, he will have earned $40 ($2 x 20). So, he will have a profit of $20.
Response:  On Monday, she wrote 5 articles and spent an average of 4 hours per article. Therefore, she spent 20 hours (5 x 4) on writing articles that day.  In Tuesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Monday, which means she spent 80 hours (2 x 20) on writing articles that day.  In Wednesday, she wrote 3 more articles than she did on Tuesday, which means she spent 105 hours (3 x 33) on writing articles that day. So, in total, Meredith spent 20 + 80 + 105 = 205 hours on writing articles during those three days.
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-its in her bag before she went to the cafe. She then stopped at a store and bought a pack of 220 different coffee cups with one Post-it note per cup. So, if she used all 220 cups, how many Post-it notes did she have left?  Therefore, there were 220 - 80 = 140 Post-it notes remaining in her bag.
Response:  We know that John has twice as many red scarves as blue ones. So if he has x blue scarves, he has 2x red scarves. Since each red scarf costs $1 more than each blue one, we can write:  Price of 1 red scarf = $1 + $0.40 (Price of 1 blue scarf)  Now, we are given that John spent $200 on blue scarves, which means he spent:  Total amount spent on blue scarves = $200  And since he has 2 times as many red scarves as blue ones, and each red scarf costs $1 more than each blue one, we can calculate the total amount spent on red scarves as follows:  Total amount spent on red scarves = Number of red scarves × ($1 + $0.40)  Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:  Total amount spent on red scarves = 2x × ($1 + $0.40) = 2(200) × ($1 + $0.40) = $380  Therefore, John has spent a total of $380 on both red and blue scarves.
"Response:  We know that Tracy has used a rope 1.4 meters long to support Parnassus' plants in the garden. If we cut this rope into pieces of 15 cm each, then...
We can calculate the number of pieces as follows:
Length of rope = 1.4 m
Length of each piece = 15 cm = 0.15 m
Total length of all pieces = Total length of rope divided by Length of each piece
= 1.4 m / 0.15 m
= 9 pieces
Therefore, Tracy received 9 pieces of rope."
Response:  We know that Richard lives in a building with 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then we can calculate the number of empty apartments as follows: Number of empty apartments = Total number of apartments - Occupied apartments Total number of apartments = 15 x 8 = 120 Occupied apartments = 3/4 x 120 = 90 So there are 30 empty apartments in the building (120 - 90).
Response:  If Lloyd has 100 chickens and they lay 252 eggs per day, then he will have 252 x 100 = 25,200 eggs per day.  If he sells each egg for $2, then his daily income from eggs is 25,200 x $2 = $49,600 per day. So, Lloyd earns $49,600 per day on eggs.
"Response:  The boat can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour during the trip from 13h to 16h. To find out how long it will take for the return journey, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey and then add them up.
The distance traveled during the first leg is 10 x (16 - 13) = 48 miles.
The time taken for this leg is 48 / 10 = 4.8 hours.
Similarly, the time taken for the second leg is 10 x (16 - 19) = 27 miles.
So, the total time taken for both legs is 4.8 + 2.7 = 7.5 hours. Therefore, the boat will take approximately 7.5 hours to return."
Response:  If Urijah has already gained 15 kilograms and he needs to lose it all, then he must have weighed 15 + 15 = 30 kilograms initially. Now, let's calculate how many strips of meat he had at that time: Number of strips = Total weight / Weight of each strip = 30 kg / 1 kg = 30 strips So now, if he loses 15 kilograms (which is equal to 15 x 1 kg), then his remaining weight will be: New weight = Old weight - Loss weight = 30 kg - 15 kg = 15 kg And now, let's find out how many strips of meat he has left after losing 15 kilograms: Number of strips left = Remaining weight / Weight of each strip = 15 kg / 1 kg = 15 strips Therefore, Urijah must have 15 fewer strips of meat than he originally had.
Response:  For the tow truck tires, he charged $60 each, so for six tires, he earned $360 ($60 x 6 = $360).  For the cars, he charged $40 each, so for four tires, he earned $160 ($40 x 4 = $160). Therefore, the total amount of money the mechanic earned that day is $520 ($360 + $160 = $520).
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:
Sister Doubtfire has returned home with seven kittens after adopting them from a local animal shelter when their mother called to inform them that their two domestic cats had just given birth.
We know that Patchy, the first cat, had three times as many adopted kittens as Trixie, who had 12 kittens.
So, if we assume that Patchy had 3 times as many kittens as Trixie (since she had 3 x 12 = 36 kittens), then Sister Doubtfire must have 7 + 36 = 43 kittens in total.
Therefore, the correct answer is 43."
Response:  If Jean has 30 pieces of candy and she wants to put them all in one bag, then she can fill at most 30 bags.  Since each piece of candy is small enough to fit into one bag, we know that Jean can only fill up to 30 bags with her total supply of 30 pieces of candy. Therefore, the answer is 30 bags.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 for admission and $7 for snacks each time he goes to the movies, then his total cost per trip is $14 ($7 + $7). Since he has $42 to spend over the course of a week, he can go to the movies $\frac{42}{14} = 3$ times. Therefore, he can greet in the cinema $3 \times 7 = 21$ times.
Response:  We know that the total weight of the truck and driver is 3755 pounds (or 3.755 tons). The maximum weight limit for the bridge is 5000 pounds. So we need to find out how many bags of sand (each weighing 15 pounds) can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit. To do this, we divide the weight limit by the weight of each bag of sand: $5000 / 15 = 333$ bags of sand. Therefore, the largest number of bags of sand that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit is 333.
Response:  Firstly, Stephen paid $40 for food online. Then, he was charged an additional 25% commission fee of $10 (since it was delivered through a supplier), making his final bill $50 ($40 + $10). Next, he added $4 for delivery, bringing the total cost to $54. Therefore, the price of Stephen's products is $54.
Response:  We know that there are 6 groups of 20 fruits and 67 individual fruits scattered across the bush. So, we can calculate the total number of fruits as follows: Total number of fruits = Number of groups x Number of fruits per group + Number of individual fruitsTotal number of fruits = 6 x 20 + 67= 153 fruitsSo, there are 153 fruits in total on the bush.
Response:  We know that out of 25 pomegranates, one is bad (slab), and 20 are not yet ripe. That means there are only 4 good ones left. So, the number of good pomegranates is 4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Janet paid $500 for materials to make the necklace and then she paid an additional $800 to the jeweler to assemble it. Therefore, the total amount of money spent on making the necklace is $500 + $800 = $1300. Then, as per the question, Janet also paid 10% of the cost price of the necklace towards insurance, which is equal to $1300 x 10% = $130. So, the final amount that Janet paid for the necklace is $1300 + $130 = $1430.
Response:  If she works for the same company for 40 years and gets an annual pension of $50,000 per year, then her total accumulated pension value after 40 years would be: $50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000. After 20 years of service, she becomes eligible to receive 5% of the accumulated pension value each year, which means she will get $100,000 ($2,000,000 x 5%) as her annual pension. So, her annual pension after 20 years of service would be $50,000 + $100,000 = $150,000. Now, if she continues working for another 10 years (i.e., 30 years in total), her total accumulated pension value would become: $2,000,000 + ($50,000 x 10) = $2,600,000. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service would be: $150,000 + $60,000 = $210,000.
Response:  First half of year (January to June): Initial deposit = $140 x 6 months = $840 Second half of year (July to December): Discounted amount = $840 x 10% = $84 Decimal part = $84 / 12 = $7 per month Total amount paid = $84 + ($7 x 6 months) = $954 Therefore, the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year is $954.
Response:  We know that from the last filling of gasoline, Sophia has driven for 160 kilometers and needs to add 4 gallons (gal) of gasoline for the next trip. According to the instructions, her car has a gas tank capacity of 12 gal. To find out how far she can drive with one rezervoar of gasoline, we need to divide the distance traveled (in this case, 160 km) by the amount of gasoline left in the tank (4 gal). So, Sophia can drive approximately 40 km (160 km / 4 gal = 40 km) with one rezervoar of gasoline.
"Response:  Jim watches TV for 30 minutes and then reads half of it. He does this three times a week. In four weeks, how many hours will he spend in front of the TV and reading?

Answer: 4 x 3 = 12 hours per week watching TV + 30 min/week = 60 minutes/week reading = 240 minutes/month = 960 minutes/4 weeks = 240 hours (or 10 days)"
Response:  We know that there are four schools participating in the tournament and each school has sent two teams (one for girls and one for boys). So, we have a total of 8 teams (4 x 2 = 8). Each team has 5 players, so we have a total of 40 players (8 teams x 5 players per team = 40). Additionally, each school has also sent a coach to train their respective teams, so we have a total of 41 people (40 players + 1 coach per school = 41).
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. Since smaragds are twice as many as rubies, we can conclude that there are 2 x 140 = 280 smaragds in the chest. Therefore, the total number of precious stones in the chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = 695.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls at school. So if there are x girls, there are 2x boys. If each teacher has 60 girls and 5 boys, then the total number of students is 60 + (5 \* 2) = 130. Therefore, there are 130 teachers at the school.
Response:  Bailey starts with $X dollars. Then she gets $5 weekly additions for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, she has $X + ($5 x 8) = $X + $40 = $X + $120. So, Bailey had $120 at the beginning.
Response:  If Judy teaches 5 dance classes per day and there are 7 days in a week, then she teaches 35 dance classes (5 x 7) in one week.  Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students Judy teaches in one week is 35 x 15 = 525 students.  Now, if Judy charges $15 per student per class, her total earnings from teaching dance classes in one week would be 525 students x $15 per student = $7,875.
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first (which is 40), then Kelian needs to read 40 instructions to prepare both meals. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  If Tommy sells each cola for $3 and each siren cola for $4, then he will make $3 x 43 = $132 from selling colas and $4 x 23 = $92 from selling sirens. Therefore, Tommy will make a total of $132 + $92 = $224.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Sheila paid for each mobile phone. Since she bought five mobiles phones and each cost $150, her total cost would be:

$150 x 5 = $750

Now, let's find out how much interest Sheila will pay per month for 3 months. We know that the interest rate is 2%, so we can use this formula:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal amount is $750 (the total cost of the mobile phones), the rate is 2% (which means we multiply it by 0.02), and the time is 3 months (which means we divide the result by 3). So, our calculation goes like this:

Interest = $750 x 0.02 x 3/12 = $45

Therefore, Sheila will pay $45 per month for 3 months ($45 x 3 = $135) in interest alone. However, since she already paid $750 for the mobile phones, her total payment for the first three months will be:

Total Payment = Principal + Interest = $750 + $135 = $885

So, Sheila will pay $885 for the first three months."
Response:  If we multiply each price per unit (lonclek) with the number of units sold, we get: Nagibi - 12 x 2,74 = 32,96 Petunija - 9 x 1,87 = 16,53 Begonija - 17 x 2,12 = 35,04 Total amount earned by Artie = 32,96 + 16,53 + 35,04 = 84,53 dollars So, if Artie sells 12 loncles of narcissus, 9 lonces of pansies and 17 lonces of begonias, he will earn 84,53 dollars.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each level of sandcastle has half the area of the previous one. So, if the highest level has an area of $16 \text{ m}^2$, then the second-highest level will have an area of $\frac {16}{2} = 8 \text{ m}^2$. Similarly, the third and fourth levels will have areas of $\frac {8}{2} = 4 \text{ m}^2$ and $\frac {4}{2} = 2 \text{ m}^2$, respectively. Therefore, the total area of all four levels is:
$$A = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ m}^2$$
So, the average area of each level is:
$$\frac {A}{4} = \frac {30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ m}^2$$"
Response:  Firstly, we know that for the first 180 days (or half a year), Cecilia must give her new puppy one scoop of dog food every day. This means she will use 180/2 = 90 vials of dog food during this period.  Next, from Day 181 to the end of its life, Cecilia needs to give her puppy two scoops of dog food each day. Therefore, in total, she will require 365 - 180 = 185 vials of dog food over the entire duration of her puppy's lifetime. So, the final answer is 185 vials of dog food.
Response:  We know that Če Raymond pere polovico več kot Sarah, which means he works half as much as she does. So if Sarah works 400 kilograms of laundry, then Raymond works 200 kilograms (half of 400). Now we need to find out how much David works. According to the question, David works four times more than Sarah, so if Sarah works 400 kilograms, then David works 1600 kilograms (four times 400). Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry worked by Raymond and David is 1400 kilograms (1600 - 200).
Response:  If he buys 3 flowers for $2.50 each in a package of 3, then the total cost is $7.50 ($2.50 x 3).  If he buys 2 flowers for $1 each in a package of 2, then the total cost is also $2 ($1 x 2). So, if he buys 18 flowers altogether, he will save $5 (=$7.50 - $2).
Response:  Firstly, we know that John paid $100 for the haircut. Then, if the groomer offers a 30% discount to new customers, this means that the actual price of the haircut is $70 ( $100 x 30%). So, the final cost of the haircut would be $70.
Response:  We know that initially there were two girls who shared 24 liters of water equally among themselves. So each girl got 24 / 2 = 12 liters of water. Then, one boy received 6 liters of water from them. Therefore, the total amount of water left with the remaining 1 girl is 12 - 6 = 6 liters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie had 10 marbles initially. Then he bought 21 more from the shop and got 23 as a gift for his birthday. So, the total number of marbles he has now is: 10 + 21 = 31. Next, he gave 9 marbles to his sister, leaving him with: 31 - 9 = 22 marbles. Finally, he used 28 marbles for decorating the cake, so Charlie has: 22 - 28 = 4 marbles left. Therefore, Charlie has 4 marbles remaining.
Response:  If Grace weighs 40 kg and Alex weighs more than 40 kg but less than 44 kg (since he weighs 2 kg more than Grace), then their combined weight is equal to 40 + 2 = 42 kg. Therefore, their total weight in kilograms is 42 kg.
"Response:  We know that there are three flowers in total and each flower has two branches (one from the top of the stem and one from the bottom). So, we have:

Total number of stems = Total number of flowers x Number of branches per flower
= 3 x 2
= 6

Now, let's count how many twigs are attached to each stem:

Number of twigs per stem = Number of branches per flower x Number of stems
= 8 x 6
= 48

So, there are 48 twigs in total."
"Response:  We know that the team played 22 matches and won more than they lost. So, we can say that their number of wins is greater than their number of losses. Let's call this difference W (W = Number of wins - Number of losses). Since they won 8 more times than they lost, we have:

W = 8 + X
where X is the number of losses. Substituting this equation into the statement given in the question, we get:

Number of goals scored by the winning team = 2(W)
= 2(8 + X)
= 16 + 2X
Since we are looking for the number of goals the team scored, we need to find the value of X. To do this, we can subtract the number of losses from the total number of goals scored:

X = Total number of goals scored - Number of losses
= 22 - X
Now we can substitute the expression for X into the equation above:

Number of goals scored by the winning team = 2(8 + X)
= 2(8 + 22 - X)
= 30 + 4X
So, the team scored 30 goals in total, and since they won 8 more times than they lost, the number of goals they scored per win is:

Number of goals scored per win = Total number of goals scored / Number of wins
= 30 / 8
= 3.75
Therefore, the team scored approximately 3.75 goals per match."
"Response:  We know that Gene has been going on vacation every year since he was 23 years old (he is now 34), and each time he goes on vacation, he brings back one souvenir t-shirt from each destination. So far, we have:

* 1 t-shirt from his first vacation at age 23
* 2 t-shirts from his second vacation at age 26
* 3 t-shirts from his third vacation at age 29
*...

We are also given that each t-shirt has its own unique pre-printed block of fabric, which contains a pattern or design related to the destination where the t-shirt was purchased. Therefore, the number of different blocks of fabric that Gene has collected over the years is equal to the number of destinations he has visited.

So, if we assume that Gene has visited 5 different destinations (e.g., Paris, Tokyo, New York City, Sydney, and Rio de Janeiro) during his 11 years of vacationing, then the total number of blocks of fabric that Gene has collected is:

5 x 1 = 5

Therefore, Gene has collected 5 different blocks of fabric over the course of his 11 years of vacationing."
Response:  First time it rang four times, second time it rang three times longer than first time (so six times in total), third time it rang only half as long as the second time (three times). Therefore, the alarm rang 4 + 6 + 3 = 13 times in total.
Response:  First year (year 1): $600 x 1 = $600 Second year (year 2): $600 x 1 + ($600 x 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660 Third year (year 3): $660 x 1 + ($660 x 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726 Fourth year (year 4): $726 x 1 + ($726 x 10%) = $726 + $72 = $808 Fifth year (year 5): $808 x 1 + ($808 x 10%) = $808 + $80 = $908 Total amount paid to Sylvie over five years: $600 + $660 + $726 + $808 + $908 = $3,600
"Response:  We know that Marilynina prva plošča se je prodala desetkrat bolj than Haraldova (in other words, Marilyn sold ten times more albums than Harald). So if they together sold 88,000 copies, then we can calculate how many copies each of them sold as follows:

Marilyn: If she sold ten times more albums than Harald, then she sold:

10 x 88,000 = 880,000 albums

Harald: Since Marilyn sold ten times more albums than him, he sold:

880,000 - 88,000 = 792,000 albums

Therefore, Harald sold 792,000 albums and Marilyn sold 880,000 albums."
Response:  We know that there are 16 invited guests and since quarter of them did not show up (4/4 = 1), we have to subtract 4 from the total number of guests. So, the number of guests who actually attended is: 16 - 4 = 12. Now, each guest needs 75 small gift boxes, so the total number of small gift boxes needed for all guests is: 12 x 75 = 900. Therefore, Christina will need $900 worth of small gift boxes ($75 per box x 900 boxes).
Response:  Adult dinosaurs can eat 10 kg of potato salad, and children can eat half as much as adults. If there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, we need to calculate how much potato salad each person will eat.  For an adult, it means they will eat 10/2 = 5 kg of potato salad. Since there are 20 adults, that's 100 kg of potato salad for them.  For children, it means they will eat 5/5 = 1 kg of potato salad per child. There are 5 children, so that's 5 kg of potato salad for them.  In total, Ted needs to bring 100 + 5 = 105 kg of potato salad to the picnic.
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three more pets than Marcia.
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
Cindy has four pets.
So, we can write an equation based on these statements:
Let X be the number of pets that Jan has.
Since Jan has three more pets than Marcia, Marcia has X - 3 pets.
Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Cindy has X - 5 pets.
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 4 (since Cindy has 4 pets)
Therefore, Jan has 7 pets (X + 3)."
Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Age of Jackson = Age of Amy + (Age of Corey - Age of Amy)  Substituting the given values, we get: Age of Jackson = 5 + (10 - 5) = 10 Therefore, Jackon is 10 years old.
"Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds with obstacles, then his speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time = 400 m / 38 s = 10.5 m/s

Now, if Gerald has improved his speed by 10%, then his new speed would be:

New Speed = Old Speed x (1 + Percentage Increase) = 10.5 m/s x (1 + 10%) = 11.65 m/s

So, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 35.7 seconds (calculation: New Speed x Time = 400 m x 35.7 s)."
Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer dogs than cats and dogs combined. So if there are 60 dogs, then there are 78 cats (60 - 12 = 78). If each dog has two cats, then the total number of household pets is 78 x 2 = 156. Therefore, there are 156 household pets in the village.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students from the 5th grade, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls. So, if there are x girls in total, we can write an equation based on this information:  Number of girls = (2/5) \* 200 = 100 Since there are already 100 girls, then the number of girls in the scout group is equal to the number of girls who are not in the scout group. Therefore, the number of girls in the scout group is: Number of girls in the scout group = Total number of girls - Number of girls who are not in the scout group = 100 - 100 = 0 So, there are no girls in the scout group.
Response:  If Harry spent 9 hours and his friend James spent 3/4 of that time (i.e., 2/3 \* 9 = 6 hours), then we can calculate how much longer Harry spent awake as follows: Time taken by Harry to fall asleep - Time taken by James to fall asleep = Difference in sleep duration Harry took 9 hours to fall asleep, so he was awake for 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James. Therefore, Harry slept for 3 hours more than James.
Response:  We know that Freda has lost half of her space and she used to have 4-kiloliter tanks for each parachute. Since there are three parachutes in each tank, we can calculate the total number of parachutes as follows: Number of parachutes = Total volume of tanks / Volume of one tank  Volume of one tank = 4 kiloliters / 3 parachutes per tank = 1.33 kiloliters So, Freda used 32 units of oxygen (since the last series had 32 uncs of oxygen). Therefore, the number of parachutes Freda used is: Number of parachutes = 32 uncs / 1.33 kiliters = 25 parachutes
Response:  In the first 15 minutes, 5 cars passed through the traffic jam (since they were able to avoid it). So, in total, 25 cars passed through the traffic jam during those 15 minutes (5 cars/minute x 15 minutes = 75 cars). Since there were initially 30 cars on the highway, that means that 5 cars remained stuck in the traffic jam for the remaining 15 minutes (75 cars - 5 cars = 70 cars). Therefore, 70 cars passed through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already planted 40 plants in her garden and she wants to give each of her friends and family one plant from each pot. So, we need to find out how many pots she will have after giving away all these plants.

Let's assume that each pot contains 2 plants (as mentioned in the problem statement). Therefore, if Mary gives away 40 plants, she will have 40 / 2 = 20 pots left in her garden.

So, Mary will have 20 pots with 2 plants each, which means she will have a total of 40 plants in her garden."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerome had four friends who visited him and pressed the bell at different times.  Secondly, we are told that the first friend pressed the bell 20 times before Jerome opened the door, which means that the first friend pressed the bell for 20 seconds. Thirdly, we are informed that the second friend pressed the bell 1/4 more than Jerome's first friend, which means that the second friend pressed the bell for 25 seconds (since 1/4 of 20 is 5). Fourthly, we learn that the third friend pressed the bell ten times more than the second friend, which means that the third friend pressed the bell for 250 seconds ( since 10 x 25 = 250). Finally, we are told that the fourth friend pressed the bell 60 times, which means that he pressed it for 60 seconds. Therefore, in total, the five friends pressed the bell for 285 seconds (20 + 25 + 250 + 60 = 285).
"Response:  We know that Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday and he has to read 4 pages from the science book, 2 pages from the social studies book, 7 pages from the history book, and 8 pages from the geography book. So, if we calculate how many pages he needs to read each day, we get:
Science book: 4 pages / 4 days = 1 page per day Social Studies book: 2 pages / 4 days =  half a page per day History book: 7 pages / 4 days = 1 page and 3/4 per day Geography book: 8 pages / 4 days = 2 pages per day Therefore, Solo needs to read 1 + (half a page) + 1 + (1 page and 3/4) + 2 = 4 pages per day."
"Response: 
John drinks beer every day during lunchtime (12 oz), afternoon (16 oz), and evening (20 oz). So he drinks a total of 48 oz of beer per day.
On weekends, John doesn't drink beer. Therefore, his daily consumption is 48 oz / 7 days = 6.7 oz per day."
Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes for the fog to cover the entire town from the moment it rises from the ocean. So we can calculate how long it will take for the fog to cover the entire town as follows: Time = Distance / Speed = 42 miles / 3 miles/minute = 14 minutes Therefore, it will take approximately 14 minutes for the fog to completely cover the entire town after it has risen from the ocean.
Response:  Poppy has already placed one-fourth of the remaining pieces (3/4) on the table. Now her mother places another third of the remaining pieces (1/3). So, in total, Poppy and her mother have placed 3 + 1 = 4 parts of the puzzle on the table. Therefore, there are still 960 - 4 = 956 pieces left to solve the puzzle.
Response:  If Cody has taken 3 times as many lollipops as Amir, then for every lollipop that Amir takes, Cody will take 3 times as many. So if Amir takes 5 lollipops, Cody will take 15 lollipops (3 x 5 = 15). Therefore, together they will have eaten 18 lollipops (5 + 15 = 18).
Response:  First, we need to find out how much space each piece of cheese takes up in each box. Since each box is 5 cm wide, 6 cm long, and 4 cm high, each piece of cheese will take up an area of 5 cm x 6 cm = 30 cm^2.  Next, since there are three boxes, the total surface area of all the pieces of cheese will be 30 cm^2 x 3 = 90 cm^2.  Now, let's calculate the volume of each box. The height of each box is 4 cm, and the width and length are 5 cm and 6 cm respectively, so the volume of each box is 5 cm x 6 cm x 4 cm = 120 cubic centimeters (cm^3).  Finally, since there are three boxes, the total volume of all the cheese will be 120 cm^3 x 3 = 360 cm^3. Therefore, the total notional volume of all three boxes filled with cheese is 360 cm^3.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, he watched his favorite show for an hour each evening. Therefore, he watched 2 hours of television on those days.  On Wednesday, he finished his homework and watched one hourlong episode and three 30-minute episodes. So, he watched a total of 4 hours of television that day.  On Thursday, he stayed up late to watch two hourlong episodes. Thus, he watched 2 x 2 = 4 hours of television that day. In total, then, he watched 2 + 4 = 6 hours of television.
Response:  If Henry wanted to make 2 times more than he actually made, then he would have made 2 x 15 = 30 piiskotes. Since he ended up with 110 piiskotes, he must have given away 80 (110 - 30) piiskotes. So, Henry peeled 80 piiskotes last time.
Response:  If we buy 10 gallons of gasoline at $3 per gallon, then we will pay $30 for that amount of gasoline.  Since the company offers a discount of $20 per gallon if we fill up at their station, our total cost would be $50 ($30 + $20). So, with this offer, we will get $40 back in cash ($50 - $10).
Response:  If Beatrice was 24 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, then she had a total of 3360 square inches (24 x 14 = 336).  Now, if Marcell was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, he had a total of 420 square inches (3 x 14 = 42). So, if they both ate all the roll-ups, their average consumption would be:  Average Consumption = Total Area Eaten / 2 = 3360 / 2 = 1680 square inches per person.
Response:  We know that for every ten meters (m) of distance traveled in the boat, two liters (L) of water are pulled along. Therefore, if it took 16 seconds to travel 20 m, then 2 L x 16 s = 32 L were pulled along during this time. Similarly, if it took 64 seconds to travel 40 m, then 2 L x 64 s = 128 L were pulled along during this time. So, when Julia reached the shore, there were 32 + 128 = 160 L of water on the boat.
Response:  If there are four teachers and each teacher uses the blackboard twice a day (i.e., two times), then there will be 8 blackboard usages per day (4 teachers x 2 usages/day).  Since the blackboard is cleaned 3 times an hour, it will be cleaned 24 times per day (8 usages/day x 3 cleans per hour). So, the answer is 24.
Response:  We know that Ryan has planted two flowers in his garden and they bloom every 15 days. If 5 of them did not grow, then we have to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers. So, after 15 days, he will have 2 - 5 = 7 flowers left. Therefore, Ryan will have 7 flowers in his garden after 15 days.
Response:  We know that Jamalov telefon can take 6 times more pictures than Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone can take 50 pictures of birds, then Jamalov phone can take 300 (6 x 50) pictures of birds. Now we are given that Jamalov phone can take 1800 pictures in total. Therefore, the number of pictures of birds that Jamalov phone can take is 1800 - 300 = 1500 pictures of birds. Finally, since there are 50 birds on Jamalova photograph, we can see 1500 / 50 = 30 racks on Jamalova photograph.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of each piece of glass has increased by 50% in recent months after purchase. So, if Sasha paid $10 for each of the remaining 10 pieces of glass, then their new price would be:

$10 x 50% = $5 per piece

So, the total value of these pieces is now:

$5 x 10 = $50

Now, let's consider the five pieces of glass that Sasha bought for $16 each. Since they have not changed in price, their value remains the same:

$16 x 1 = $16

Finally, to calculate Sasha's overall profit, we need to add up the values of all the glass pieces she has:

$50 + $16 = $66

Therefore, Sasha will make a profit of $66 from selling all her glass pieces."
Response:  We know that Katy has used 120 teaspoons of sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we can use the following formula: Number of teaspoons of sugar = Total amount of mixture / Ratio of sugar to liquid So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this formula, we get: Number of teaspoons of sugar = 120 / 7 = 17 teaspoons Therefore, Katy used 17 teaspoons of sugar.
Response:  If John has three children and each child needs two pairs of shoes, then he needs to buy 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John has paid a total of $60 x 6 = $360. Therefore, John has paid $360 for his three children's shoes.
Response:  On day one, two containers were inspected with each containing 5 vehicles, therefore the total number of vehicles inspected on day one is 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.  On the second day, more containers arrived with an additional 20 vehicles, bringing the total number of vehicles in the port to 30. So, the number of containers that were inspected on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20 containers.
Response:  We know that Adrien's total pay was $120,000 four years later and he earned 40% more than before. So his new salary is:  $120,000 x 1.4 = $168,000. Now we need to find out how much Lyla earned. According to the passage, her pay was 30% higher than Adrien's original pay, which means she earned:  $120,000 x 1.3 = $156,000. Therefore, their combined total pay after four years is:  $168,000 + $156,000 = $324,000.
Response:  If he uses two pieces of paper per day and there are 30 sheets in each piece of paper, then he will use 60 sheets (2 x 30) per day. Since there are 30 days in a month, he will use 1800 sheets (60 x 30) per month.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges to share with Kael. If we multiply these numbers together, we get 40 (5 x 8 = 40). So, they have altogether 40 pieces of fruit.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept for 2 hours less than on Monday, so she slept for 6 hours each day (6 + 6 = 12).  In the remaining days of the week, if she slept one hour more per day than on those two days, then she slept for 7 hours on Thursday, 8 hours on Friday, and 9 hours on Saturday (9 + 8 = 17). Therefore, in total, Sadie slept for 17 hours during the entire week.
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 miles in one hour, then she can run 10 x 6 = 60 miles in six hours. Since she runs at a speed of 8 km/h, she covers a distance of 8 km/h x 6 h = 48 km in six hours. Therefore, Rosie can cover a total distance of 60 + 48 = 108 kilometers in seven hours.
Response:  When Jennie started helping her mother, there were 60 letters that needed envelopes and stamps. After Jennie helped for some time, 30 of these letters had already been stamped. So, the number of letters that remained to be stamped is 60 - 30 = 30.
Response:  Julia had 3 Žliček left from before, and she used 3 more to try out the sauce. So, she has 6 Žliček left. Then her husband gave her a package of 5 new Žliček. Therefore, Julia now has 11 Žliček (6 + 5).
Response:  We know that Dylan needed both chicken and fish stock to make his croquettes. He bought 38 chicken drumsticks and 6 more fish drumsticks than chicken drumsticks. So, if he bought x chicken drumsticks, then he also bought 6 + x fish drumsticks. Since he wanted to make klobasne krojbe (croquettes), we can assume that each drumstick was used to make one krojba. Therefore, the total number of koblas Dylan bought is equal to the number of chicken drumsticks he bought, which is 38. So, Dylan bought 38 koblas.
Response:  If Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, that means Lily has x friends and Amy has x + 20 = 40 friends. So, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is 50 (Lily's original number of friends) plus the sum of their individual numbers of friends, which is 40 + x = 90. Therefore, the answer is 90.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one melon costs three times as much as an apple. So, if an apple costs $X, then a melon will cost $3X.  Secondly, we know that a pear costs $5 less than an orange. So, if an orange costs $Y, then a pear will cost $Y - $5 = $Y - $5.  Thirdly, we are given that Dillon wants to buy 4 lemons, 20 apples, and 10 oranges. So, he will spend a total of $4X + $20(Y - $5) + $10Y = $4X + $20Y - $100.  Finally, we are asked how much Dillon will pay in total. Therefore, the answer is $4X + $20Y - $100.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total time spent in the hospital per day:  Time = Number of patients x Average stay per patient  Time = 500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital from these visits: Revenue = Total time spent in the hospital x Price charged per minute  Revenue = 12,000 minutes/day x $150/hour = $180,000/day Next, we need to subtract the cost of treating each patient: Cost = Total revenue x Percentage of revenue spent on treatment  Cost = $180,000/day x (10% of revenue) = $18,000/day So, the profit made by the hospital is: Profit = Total revenue - Cost  Profit = $180,000/day - $18,000/day = $162,000/day Therefore, the daily profit made by the hospital is $162,000.
Response:  We know that 60 seasonal workers were hired to play villagers in Nissa's store. 30 of them did not show up when the children laughed, and 10 of them did not show up when the children burst into tears. So, we have:  Not present = 30 + 10 = 40 Vilins left.
Response:  In May, Joseph had $500 in expenses. If he had fewer expenses in June, then his total expenses for both months must be less than $1000. So, the difference between his expenses in May and June is $500 - $200 = $300. Therefore, Joseph spent $300 more in June than he did in May.
Response:  Pam went twice on the roller coaster and Fred four times. Then they decided to take turns driving the Ferris wheel. If each ride cost $6 per person, how many tickets were used in total?  We know that Pam went twice, so she used 2 \* $6 = $12. And Fred went 4 times, so he used $4 \* 4 = $16. In total, then, there were $12 + $16 = $28 tickets used.
Response:  We know that in Monday he walked 6 km and then in Tuesday he walked six times more than on Monday, so he walked 6 x 7 = 42 km. Then we are told that from Monday to Wednesday he walked 41 miles, which is equal to 68 km. So, in Wednesday he walked 68 - 42 = 26 km.
Response:  If Tom does four car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then he pays $60 per month ($15 x 4).  In a year, he pays $720 ($60 x 12 months).
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 video games and he lost 5 of them before comparing with Bobby. So, Brian has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. Now, we are told that Bobby has 5 times fewer video games than Brian. Therefore, if Brian has 15 video games, Bobby must have 15 / 5 = 3 video games.  So, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that there are 27 Samoyeds in the world and 3/4 of them are located in Scotland (which means 21 Samoyeds). Since two-thirds of Scottish Samoyeds are females (which means 14 females), we can calculate the number of female Scottish Samoyeds as follows:  Number of female Scottish Samoyeds = Total number of Scottish Samoyeds x Percentage of females among Scottish Samoyeds  Number of Scottish Samoyeds = 21  Percentage of females among Scottish Samoyeds = 14/21 x 100%  Number of female Scottish Samoyeds = 21 x 65%  Number of female Scottish Samoyeds = 13 So, there are 13 female Scottish Samoyeds.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of two sandwiches at $7.50 each = $15. Then, we add the cost of two bags of chips at $1.50 each = $3. Next, we add the cost of two drinks at $1.00 each = $2. Finally, we subtract the discount of 20% from the total cost = $14. So, her order will cost $14.
Response:  If Mark completed the first test with 75 questions and finished it in 8 hours (i.e., 8 x 1 = 8), then he had 1 hour left over after completing the test.  Therefore, if he took another test with 100 questions today, he would have taken 2 hours to complete it (since there are 100 - 75 = 25 more questions). So, Mark has 4 hours remaining after finishing the second test.  Thus, Mark did not finish all of the additional 35 questions from the second test.  The correct answer is 35.
Response:  We know that there are 22 rožnatih žvečilk in total. If we have 12 modrih žvečilk, then we can find out how many rožnatih žvečilk there are by subtracting the number of modrih žvečilk from the total number of žvečilk. So, the number of rožnatih žvečilk is:  Number of rožnatih žvečilk = Total number of žvečilk - Number of modrih žvečilk  Number of rožnatih žvečilk = 22 - 12  Number of rožnatih żvečilk = 10  Therefore, there are 10 rožnatih žvečilk.
Response:  We know that out of 20 rented cars, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the remaining are semi-automatic. So, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars as follows:  Percentage = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) x 100%  In this case, the number of semi-automatic cars is 8 (since there are 4 ročnih in addition to the 12 avtomatskih). Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:  Percentage = (8 / 20) x 100%  = 40%  So, approximately 40% of the 20 rented cars are semi-automatic.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees and twice as many worker bees as queen bees. So, if there are x worker bees, then there are 2x queen bees. Therefore, we can write an equation: 700 = x + (2x) = 2x + x = 3x. Solving for x, we get: x = 233. So, there are 233 worker bees.
Response:  If Jordan works for 8 hours per day (which is standard work time in most countries), he will earn $80 per day ($10/hour x 8 hours) from his job. Now, let's assume that he spends 4 hours playing video games every day (again, this is just an assumption). So, if we subtract the time spent gaming from the total time worked, we get: Total time worked = 8 hours - 4 hours = 4 hours. Therefore, Jordan earns $40 per day from playing video games ($10/hour x 4 hours). Since there are 7 days in a week, Jordan would earn a total of $280 per week from playing video games ($40 x 7 days).
Response:  Firstly, we know that John sells milk for $2, eggs for $3, butter for $3, cheese for $3, and bread for $4 per loaf. So, if he sold all these items together, his total revenue would be:  Milk = $2 x 10 = $20 Eggs = $3 x 10 = $30 Butter = $3 x 10 = $30 Cheese = $3 x 10 = $30 Bread = $4 x 10 = $40 Total Revenue = $20 + $30 + $30 + $40 = $130 Now, let's find out how much is the tax amount. According to the question, there is a 10% tax on non-living goods. So, we need to calculate the tax amount on the non-living goods only. Non-Living Goods = Butter = $3 x 10% = $0.30 Cheese = $3 x 10% = $0.30 Bread = $4 x 10% = $0.40 Tax Amount = $0.30 + $0.30 + $0.40 = $0.90 Now, we add the tax amount to the total revenue to get the final price: Final Price = Total Revenue + Tax Amount = $130 + $0.90 = $130.90 Therefore, the final price of all the items sold by John is $130.90.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total revenue from all five potential clients. The cost of two glasses of beans is $2 x 5 = $10, and the cost of each package of cleaning supplies is $5 x 5 = $25. Therefore, the total revenue for each client will be $10 + $25 = $35 per week. Since there are three clients, the total revenue for that week will be $35 x 3 = $105.  Next, we need to subtract the costs associated with providing these services. As mentioned earlier, Lucas has calculated his total expenses at $70 per week. So, the profit (or dobiček) for that week will be $105 - $70 = $35 per week.  Therefore, Lucas will earn $35 per week as his dobiček or profit.
Response:  If John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare produces 100 pineapples per year, then in total, John will have 1000 pineapples (10 x 100 = 1000) from his entire land area. Since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, he will be able to collect 4 times as many pineapples in one year (1000 / 3 = 333). So, John can gather 333 pineapples in one year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three players and each player has their own lego collection.  The first player has 3 times as many blocks as 500, which means they have 1500 blocks (3 x 500 = 1500).  The second player has half as many blocks as the first player, which means they have 750 blocks (half of 1500 = 750).  And the third player has 1/4 of the total number of blocks, which means they have 375 blocks (1/4 of 1500 = 375).  So, if Johnny takes all the blocks from the room, he will take 1500 + 750 + 375 = 2625 blocks.
Response:  We know that 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours and half of them returned in the next 6 hours. So, we have 15 returning bees (30/2 = 15). Then, after all the bees that had left earlier returned to the hive, there were twice as many bees as when they initially left, which means there are now 4 times as many bees as when they initially left (2 x 15 = 30). Therefore, Debra saw 30 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.
Response:  We know that Brittany's mom gave $8 to the museum as change for her $10 adult ticket and $5 for her child's $6 ticket. So, she gave a total of $8 + $5 = $13 to the cashier.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 3 times as many friends as Dorothy on Facebook. So if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends. Now we are told that James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy. So if Dorothy has x friends, James has 4x friends. Finally, we are told that James has more friends than Charlie. So if James has y friends, Charlie must have fewer than y friends. Therefore, the number of friends Charles has is less than or equal to y.  In other words, y ≤ x + 3x = 4x. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy and 3 times as many friends as Charlie.
Response:  First, we need to find out how long it will take for Steve to reach his home from school if he is riding a bike at a speed of 140 meters per minute. We can use the formula: distance = speed x time. Since Steve lives 5 kilometers away from the school, the distance between them is 5 km. So, if Steve is riding a bike at a speed of 140 meters per minute, it will take him 5/140 = 36 minutes to reach his home. Now, let's find out how long it will take for Tim to reach his home from school if he is riding a skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. Using the same formula as before, we get that it will take Tim 2 miles / 264 feet per minute = 7.8 minutes to reach his home. Therefore, the winner will arrive at their home first after 36 - 7.8 = 28.2 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much it costs for each person to fill up one pneumatic tyre. As mentioned in the question, it costs $0.25 per filling. Now, let's assume that there are five people who come to fill up their bicycles with air. Each of them needs to fill up their tyres once, so they will pay $0.25 x 5 = $1.25 total. Next, let's consider the third group of three people who came to fill up their pneumatic tyres. They also paid $0.25 per filling, so their total cost is $0.25 x 3 = $0.75. Finally, there was one person who rode a unicycle and needed to fill up their pneumatic tyre as well. Since this person only had one wheel to fill, their cost would be $0.25. Therefore, the total amount of money earned that day is $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25.
Response:  We know that Carl has bought ten packets of pencils and each packet contains six pencils. So, in total, he has purchased 60 pencils (10 packets x 6 pencils/packet). Since each pencil costs $0.10, we can calculate the total cost of all the pencils as follows: Total Cost = Number of Pencils x Price per Pencil = 60 pencils x $0.10/pencil = $6.00 Now, since Carl is paying with a $10 bill, we need to divide the total cost by the amount he paid to find out how much change he will get: Change = Total Cost / Amount Paid = $6.00 / $10.00 = $0.60 or $0.60 in change. Therefore, Carl will receive $0.60 in change after buying the pencils.
Response:  We know that Dave bought a large bag of french fries and ate 15 before the seagull stole it from him. The seagull then ate half of what was left (i.e., 7.5 fries). Then three crows came and each ate three fries (3 x 3 = 9 fries). Later, a fox took two-thirds of what was left (2/3 x 7.5 = 5 fries), leaving only one fry behind. Finally, ants carried off the last fry. So, there were initially 15 fries in the bag, and after all these events, there were 5 fries remaining. Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, Kim has 4 hours of classes per day. In total, he has 16 weeks of schooling in one semester. So, he spends 4 x 16 = 64 hours on classes per semester.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many rows of each type of food there are. We can do this by dividing the total number of each item by the length of one row (which is 15 cm).

For bread rolls: Total = 300, Divided by 15 = 20 rows
For chocolate croissants: Total = 120, Divided by 15 = 8 rows
For bagels: Total = 60, Divided by 15 = 4 rows
So now we know that there will be 20 rows of bread rolls, 8 rows of chocolate croissants, and 4 rows of bagels. Next, we need to find out how wide each row is. Again, we can divide the total length of each item by the length of one row.

For bread rolls: Length = 15 cm x 20 rows = 300 cm
For chocolate croissants: Length = 15 cm x 8 rows = 120 cm
For bagels: Length = 15 cm x 4 rows = 60 cm
Now we have all the information we need to calculate the total length of all the items. To do this, we simply add up the lengths of all the rows.

Total length = 300 + 120 + 60 = 580 cm
Therefore, if Bill places all the baked goods end to end, they will stretch for 580 cm or approximately 19 feet 7 inches."
"Response:  The zookeeper feeds all the monkeys in the zoo 200 bananas each month. Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and paviants need 100 bananas per month. To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to buy for two months, we can use the following calculation:

Total number of bananas needed = Number of monkeys x Monthly requirement per monkey
= 200 + (400 x 2) + (100 x 2)
= 800 + 800 + 200
= 1,200 bananas
Therefore, the zookeeper needs to buy 1,200 bananas for two months."
Response:  Blake runs back and forth 15 times along the field, which means he covers a distance of 100 meters / 15 = 6.67 meters per run.  Since Kelly only runs once from one end of the field to the other (40 yards), she covers a total distance of 40 yards x 2 = 80 meters. Therefore, the winner (Kelly) is ahead of the loser (Blake) by a distance of 80 - 6.67 = 73.33 meters.
Response:  We know that Raphael bought 4 swinches (which cost $1.5 each), 2 packs of paper (which cost $4 each), and an armband (which cost $20). So, he spent a total of: $$ = 4 \times 1.5 + 2 \times 4 + 20 = 36$$ dollars.
Response:  Finn first observes 11 ducks swimming in the pond. Suddenly, he sees six hiding underneath a lily pad, then two more hiding behind a rock. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 11 + 6 = 17 + 2 = 19. Therefore, Finn can see 19 ducks in the pond.
Response:  We know that in Monday (tuesday), water level was 5 meters deep and after 1 meter of water evaporated, water level became 4 meters deep. So, water level at Wednesday is 3/3 = 1 meter deep.
Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 sea stars, 6 sea horses, and 3 mermaids. Since Locsin caught fewer than Anakin, we can say that Locsin caught x sea stars, where x is less than 10. Similarly, since Locsin caught fewer than Anakin in terms of sea horses, we can say that Locsin caught y sea horses, where y is also less than 6. Finally, since Locsin caught more mermaids than Anakin, we can say that Locsin caught z mermaids, where z is greater than 3. So, the total number of fish (including both sea creatures) that Locsin caught is: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19. Therefore, the answer to the question is 19.
Response:  If one bottle of wine costs $20 and the price increases by 20% every two months, then after 1 month, the new price will be: $20 x 1.2 = $24. After 2 months, the new price will be: $24 x 1.2 = $28.80. And so on. So, after 36 months, the final price of the bottle of wine will be: $28.80 x 36 = $1075.20. Therefore, the cost of the bottle of wine after 36 months is $1075.20.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red cars, and each one costs $4. So, the total cost of the red cars is: 5 x $4 = $20.  Next, we know that there are 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is: 3 x $5 = $15. Finally, we know that the doll cost $3. So, the total value of all the toys together is: $20 + $15 + $3 = $38. Therefore, the value of all the toys is $38.
Response:  If Jackie pays $120 for tax preparation services (90 + 30), and she saves 3 hours of work per week ($35/hour x 3 hours = $105) by hiring an accountant, then her total savings is:  Total savings = Tax preparation cost + Time saved = $120 + $105 = $225. So, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will have $225 more than she would have had if she prepared her taxes herself.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has $1500 to spend on her new computer and accessories. She spends $1090 on the computer itself, which leaves her with $410 remaining. Then she buys additional items such as a scanner for $157, a printer for $102, and a CD player for $74, which adds up to a total of $333 spent on these extras. Therefore, Elvira will have $87 left over after purchasing all of these items ($410 - $333 = $87). So, the answer is $87.
Response:  If Sandra has to make 15 Spanish omelets for school fundraising and she needs 3 eggs per omelet, then she will need 15 x 3 = 45 eggs in total. Since she already has 9 eggs at home, she still needs 45 - 9 = 36 more eggs. So, Sandra needs to watch her daughter for 36 additional hours to collect enough eggs.
Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So, if Brooke is currently 16 years old (as stated in the problem), then Seth must be 32 years old (twice 16). Therefore, Seth is 32 years old.
Response:  If Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel, and Ethel has $8, then we can write an equation as follows:  Jimmy = Ethel + $2.  Substituting this value into the equation above gives us:  Jimmy = (Ethel + $2) + $2.  Simplifying further, we get:  Jimmy = Ethel + $4.  So, Jimmy has $4 more than Ethel.
Response:  If he walked 30 kilometers in one day (on weekends), then he walked an average of 6 kilometers per hour.  In one month, there are 4 weeks, so he walks for 24 hours x 6 kilometers/hour = 144 kilometers per week. Therefore, in one month, he can walk 144 x 4 = 572 kilometers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each member of the marching band has their own unique set of uniform pieces - a hat (klobuk), jacket (jakna), and pants (hlače). We are also given that the price of each piece is proportional to its cost. Therefore, if the price of the hat is $25, then the price of the jacket must be three times as much ($75), since it costs more than twice as much as the hat. Similarly, the price of the pants must be half as much again as the jacket ($37.50). So, the total cost of each uniform can be calculated as follows: Hat: $25 Jacket: $75 Pants: $37.50 Total Cost per Uniform: $147.50
Response:  We know that Jake has seen 80 beetles with 8 legs, 90 insects with 6 legs, and 3 rare mutant crickets with 10 legs. So, we can calculate the total number of legs Jake has seen as follows:  Beetles (8 legs/beetle) = 80 x 8 = 640 legs Insects (6 legs/insect) = 90 x 6 = 540 legs Mutant crickets (10 legs/cricket) = 3 x 10 = 30 legs Total legs seen by Jake = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs Therefore, Jake has seen a total of 1210 legs.
"Response:  We know that Sally 2 is three years older than Babi Rdeča. So, if Babi Rdeča is twice as old as Sally 3, then Babi Rdeča is 6 years old (since she is twice as old as Sally 3). Therefore, Sally 4 is also 6 years old since she is of the same age as Babi Rdeča. Now we have two birds who are 6 years old and two birds who are 8 years old. Since all four birds together make up the group of ""štiri ptice"", their total age can be calculated as follows:  Age of Sally 1 = 0 + 6 = 6  Age of Sally 2 = 3 + 6 = 9  Age of Sally 3 = 8 + 6 = 14  Age of Sally 4 = 6 + 6 = 12 Total age of all four birds = 6 + 9 + 14 + 12 = 47 years."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays each month for her student loans, credit card debt and mortgage.  Student loan: $300/month Credit card debt: $200/month Mortgage: $500/month Total monthly payments: $1000 Now, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment each month, she will have to pay an additional amount of $500 per month (since 50% of $1000 is $500). Therefore, Jessica will pay a total of $1500 per month ($1000 + $500) or $18,000 per year ($1500 x 12 months).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Billy has to peel and slice 60 potatoes for his family dinner. This will take him approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds (1:20) to complete.  Next, we are told that he can slice each potato in approximately 5 seconds. Therefore, if he starts slicing the first potato at time = 0, it will take him 5 seconds to finish slicing it. So, after 1 minute and 20 seconds (1:20), he will have finished slicing all 60 potatoes. In total, then, it will take Billy 1:20 + 60 \* 5 = 35 minutes to prepare all 60 potatoes for his family dinner.
Response:  We know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade for $3 per gallon, and they use $2 worth of sugar for each gallon sold. They also sell cups for 50 cents apiece and get 20 cups per gallon sold. If they earned $25, we want to find out how much they spent on lemons. So let's start with the equation: Total amount earned = Number of gallons sold x Price per gallon + Number of cups sold x Price per cup - Cost of ingredients (lemons) Now let's fill in the values we know: Total amount earned =? x $3/gal +? x $0.50/cup -? (cost of lemons) First, let's calculate the number of gallons sold: Number of gallons sold = Total amount earned / Price per gallon = $25 / $3/gal = 8.33 gallons (round up to 9 gallons since you can't sell fractional gallons) Next, let's calculate the cost of ingredients (lemons): Cost of lemons = Number of cups sold x Price per cup = 9 x $0.50/cup = $4.50 Finally, we can plug these values into our original equation: Total amount earned = 9 x $3/gal + 9 x $0.50/cup - $4.50 = $27.50 So, Juan and his brother Carlos spent $4.50 on lemons for every 9 gallons of lemonade they sold.
Response:  We know that there were 240 Asians in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Asian players who are not Japanese is 240 - 80 = 160. Since we are told that there were 60 boys in the Chinese team, we can conclude that there were 160 - 60 = 100 girls in the Chinese team. Therefore, there were 100 girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid pays 1/4 of his salary as rent (6000 x 1/4 = 1500). Secondly, he spends 1/3 of his salary on fuel for his car (6000 x 1/3 = 4000). Thirdly, he gives half of the remaining amount to charity (6000 - 4000 = 2000), which is equal to 50% of his salary. Fourthly, he gives 200$ to his daughter and 700$ to his wife. So, the total amount of money left with him after all these expenses and donations is:  Total amount = 6000 + 1500 + 4000 + 500 = 16500. Therefore, Zaid will have 16500 dollars left after paying all his bills and making donations.
Response:  We know that Rani has 10 times more cancer than Monica and 4 times less cancer than Bo. So if Bo has 40 cancers, we need to find out how many cancers Rani and Monica have together.  To do this, we will use multiplication.  If Rani has 10 times more cancer than Monica, then Rani has 10 x 5 = 50 cancers (since Monica has 5). And if Bo has 4 times less cancer than Monica, then Bo has 4 x 5 = 20 cancers (since Monica has 5). Therefore, the total number of cancers among all three is 50 + 20 = 70 cancers.
Response:  In the first week, Lloyd had 5 hours of instruction and earned $50 (10$/hour). In the second week, he had 8 hours of instruction and earned $80 ($10/hour x 8 hours). Therefore, Lloyd has earned a total of $130 in the first two weeks ($50 + $80).
Response:  We know that there are two candidates running for the position of representative of their class at Sarina School. If the winner received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in the class, we can calculate the number of votes the loser received as follows:  Number of votes received by the loser = Total number of votes - Number of votes received by the winner  = 80 - (3/4 x 80)  = 80 - 60  = 20 votes  Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.
Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red carnations than white carnations and 5 times more roses than white carnations. So, if she ordered x white carnations, then she ordered 4x red carnations and 5x roses. Since she is unhappy with the incomplete delivery of her orders, we can conclude that the number of red carnations that Fred must deliver to make up for the missing ones is equal to the number of white carnations he did not deliver multiplied by 4. Therefore, the answer is 4x = 4(x).
Response:  We know that Jean is three years older than Mark and that Mark was five years older than Janina when she turned 16. So if Janina is currently 30 years old, then Mark must be 35 years old (since he has been alive for 5 + 2 = 7 years). Therefore, Jean is 38 years old (since she is 3 years older than Mark).
"Response:  We know that team A has four members and each member runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken by team A to complete one lap is:
Time taken by Team A = Time taken by each member x Number of members = 55 s x 4 = 220 s
Now, let's consider team B. The first runner takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters, which means the second runner starts running when the first runner finishes. So, the time taken by the second runner is:
Time taken by Team B, Runner 1 = Distance / Speed = 400 m / 60 s = 6.67 min/km
Since there are 400 meters in 1 kilometer, we can convert the time taken by the first runner as follows:
Time taken by Team B, Runner 1 (in seconds) = 6.67 min/km x 400 m/km = 266.8 s
Similarly, we can calculate the time taken by each subsequent runner in team B using the same formula:
Time taken by Team B, Runner 2 = Distance / Speed = 400 m / (60 + 3) = 6.67 min/km x 400 m/km = 266.8 s
Time taken by Team B, Runner 3 = Distance / Speed = 400 m / (60 + 3) = 6.67 min/km x 400 m/km = 266.8 s
Time taken by Team B, Runner 4 = Distance / Speed = 400 m / (60 + 3) = 6.67 min/km x 400 m/km = 266.8 s
Therefore, the total time taken by team B to complete one lap is:
Total time taken by Team B = Time taken by each runner x Number of runners = 266.8 s x 4 = 1066.4 s
Now, we need to find out how many seconds faster team B is than team A. To do this, we simply subtract the time taken by team A from the"
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are six sides of the die and each side has two numbers - $1$ or $2$. So, the probability of landing on any particular number is $\frac{1}{6}$. Now, let's consider the event where Jerry lands on a number greater than $3$. This means he will land on either $4$, $5$, or $6$. The probability of landing on any of these numbers is also $\frac{1}{6}$, since they all have an equal chance of being selected. Therefore, the probability of landing on a number greater than $3$ is also $\frac{1}{6}$.  As for your second question, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the conditional probability of landing on two consecutive even numbers. Let $A$ be the event where Jerry lands on an odd number, and $B$ be the event where he lands on two consecutive even numbers. Then, using Bayes' theorem, we have:$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)}$$where $P(A)$ is the prior probability of Jerry landing on an odd number, $P(B)$ is the probability of landing on two consecutive even numbers, and $P(A|B)$ is the conditional probability of landing on an odd number given that he lands on two consecutive even numbers. Since there are only three odd numbers ($3$, $5$, and $7$) out of the six possible numbers, we can estimate $P(A)$ as follows:$$P(A) = \frac{\text{number of odd numbers}}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$Similarly, we can estimate $P(B)$ as follows:$$P(B) = \frac{\text{number of pairs of consecutive even numbers}}{6} = \frac{2\times 2}{6} = \frac{4}{6}$$Now, we need to compute $P(A|B)$. There are only two pairs of consecutive even numbers ($4-6$ and $5-7$), so we can estimate $P(A|B)$ as follows:$$P(A|B) = \frac{\text{number of pairs of consecutive even numbers in A}}{P(B)} = \frac{2}{4}
Response:  If Jenna took half as many apples as her mother, then she took 5/2 = 3 fewer apples than her mother. So, if her mother got 20 apples, then Jenna got 17 apples (20 - 3).
Response:  We know that there are 3 groups of pigeons and each group has 4 pigeons (since they gave 6 pieces of bread to each). So, the total number of pigeons is 3 x 4 = 12.  Now, we know that each pig gives 5 pieces of bread to the hedgehogs, so the total number of pieces of bread given to the hedgehogs is 12 x 5 = 60. Since there are 10 hedgehogs in total, each one got 60/10 = 6 pieces of bread. Therefore, there are 6 hedgehogs in each cage.
Response:  If Mandy pays $100 every month and there is a 2% monthly interest rate, then after three months, she will owe Benedict $100 x (1 + 0.02) = $100 x 1.02 = $102. So, if she can pay Benedict $102 after three months, that means she must have paid him $100 initially plus an additional $2 in interest. Therefore, the correct answer is $102.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one vreca of wheat is $20. Then, we are told that the transportation cost for each vreca from the farmer's field to the warehouse is $2. Therefore, the total cost per vreca = $20 + $2 = $22. Now, we are given that the trader sold all the vrecs and earned a profit of $180 ($400 - $22). So, the number of vrecs he sold = $180 / $22 = 8 vrecs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they paid $20.25 for three tickets to the parliament. Then, they spent less than $4.50 on food, which means they spent at least $15.75 on food. Next, they took two different bus rides, each costing $33. Therefore, their total expenses were at least $68.50 ($20.25 + $15.75 + $33). Since they agreed to split the costs equally among themselves, each of them paid at least $22.50 ($.685 x 3).
Response:  In 3 hours, John can collect 3 x 60 = 180 breskvi. Since he can pick up two breskvi in one minute, in 3 hours he can collect 180 / 2 = 90 breskvi. Therefore, John collects 90 breskvi.
Response:  If each rat needs to eat 2.5 kg of insects per week to survive, and there are ten rats in total, then we need to calculate how much each rat needs to eat daily. To do this, we divide the total amount needed for the week (2.5 kg) by the number of days in that week (7). So, each rat needs to eat approximately 0.36 kg (or 360 grams) of insects every day.
"Response: 
Year | Number of trees | Tree death rate (%) | Remaining number of trees 
1st year| 50 | 0 | 50 
2nd year| 40 (50 x 0.7) | 30 | 10 
3rd year| 30 (40 x 0.67) | 20 | 8 
4th year| 20 (30 x 0.67) | 10 | 4 
5th year| 10 (20 x 0.5) | 0 | 0 
Total years = 10 years 
Therefore, after 10 years, there are no more than 0 trees left. So, the final answer is 0."
Response:  On Friday morning (petek), the neighbors put 18 red plastic flamingos on Sue's lawn. In Saturday morning (sobota), they took away one-third of these flamingos and painted them white. Then, they replaced those white flamingos back on Sue's lawn. Finally, in Sunday morning (nedelja), they added another 18 red plastic flamingos to the mix. So, at noon on Sunday, there were more than twice as many red plastic flamingos as white ones. Therefore, the answer is: More than 36 - 2 = 34 red plastic flamingos.
Response:  If she needs five colors and has $20 to spend, then each color will cost approximately $\$5$. So, she will get $\$100$ worth of paint (since there are five colors). Therefore, she will receive $\$90$ in change ($100 - \$20$).
"Response:  We know that one swinchnik costs $1.20 and one gumilo costs $0.30. To find out how much eight peresnik will cost, we can multiply the price of each item by the number of items:

Swinchnik x 8 = $96 (since there are 8 peresnik)
Gumilo x 8 = $24 (since there are 8 peresnik)
Total cost = Swinchnik cost + Gumilo cost
= $96 + $24
= $120
Therefore, eight peresnik will cost $120."
Response:  We have to divide 200 kg of potatoes among 40 restaurants. Each restaurant will get 2 kg of potatoes. To find out how much potato won't be used, we need to subtract the amount each restaurant gets from the total amount available (in this case, 200 kg). So, the amount not used = Total amount - Amount each restaurant gets = 200 kg - (40 x 2 kg) = 200 kg - 80 kg = 120 kg. Therefore, 120 kg of potatoes won't be used.
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in Soda. Of them, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. That means that the number of children (i.e., non-adult) inhabitants is equal to the total number of inhabitants minus the number of adult males plus the number of adult females. So we can write: Children = Total - Men + Women = 23786 - 8417 + 9092 = 15377. Therefore, there are 15377 children living in Soda.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. If she collected three times as many in the second month, then she had 60 Pokémon cards (3 x 20 = 60).  In the third month, she collected twice as many Pokémon cards as in the previous two months combined. So if she had 60 cards in the second month and doubled that amount in the third month, then she had 120 Pokémon cards (60 + 2 x 60 = 120) in total. Therefore, Elaine currently has 120 Pokémon cards.
Response:  We know that Mark writes for two publishers and each week he writes an equal number of articles for both publishers. The payments from Publisher A are $0.05 per article, while Publisher B pays twice as much, or $0.10 per article. So, if Mark writes 1000 articles in total (for both publishers), his total earnings will be: Total earnings = Number of articles x Payment per article = 1000 x $0.05 = $50 Total earnings = 1000 x $0.10 = $100 Since we were asked how much Mark earns in one week, let's divide the total earnings by 7 days: Daily earnings = Total earnings / Number of days = $50 / 7 = $7.14 ($100 / 7) Or, alternatively, we can calculate it this way: Daily earnings = Payment per article x Number of articles written = $0.05 x 1000 = $50 / 2 = $25 So, Mark earns $25 per day writing for these two publishers.
"Response: 
1. In the morning, Baldur gets 5 wedges of water = 5 x 5 liter = 25 liters of water per day. 
2. In the afternoon, he gets 6 wedges of water = 6 x 5 liter = 30 liters of water per day.  Therefore, the total amount of water that Baldur receives each day is 25 + 30 = 55 liters."
Response:  Firstly, we know that John received a one-time cash bonus of $5000 and a 5% increase in salary. We also know that he earned $2000 per week throughout the year and received his bonus on the first day of the year. Therefore, if John earned $2000 per week for 52 weeks (one year), he would have earned a total of $104,000 ($2000 x 52 weeks) during the year. Since he received a 5% increase in salary, his new annual salary would be $109,500 ($104,000 + $5000). So, the amount of money John earned that year is $109,500.
"Response:  If Josie's farm produces 5 tons of grapes per hectare and she makes 2 barrels of wine from each ton of grapes, then...

1. Calculate how many barrels of wine her farm produces annually based on the number of hectares of land under grape cultivation.

Barrels of wine = Total amount of grapes produced x Number of barrels made from one ton of grapes
= 5 tons/hectare x 2 barrels/ton
= 10 barrels/hectare

Since Josie has 10 hectares of land under grape cultivation, we can calculate the total number of barrels of wine her farm produces as follows:
Total barrels of wine = Area under grape cultivation x Barrels of wine produced per hectare
= 10 hectares x 10 barrels/hectare
= 100 barrels of wine/year

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Response: 
Day 1: 2 x 2 = 4 pieces of cheese used for sandwiches.
Day 2-3: 2 x 2 = 4 pieces of cheese used for omelets.
Total number of pieces of cheese used = 4 + 4 = 8 pieces.
Therefore, Carlo has used 8 pieces of cheese."
Response:  We know that Janet had initially 22 green and 10 red swinefinks. Then she bought 6 blue swinefinks and 2 red ones. In each of the blue containers, there were 9 pears, and in each of the red containers, there were 6 pears. So, let's count how many swinefinks Janet has now: Green + Blue = 22 + 6 = 28 Red + Blue = 10 + 9 = 19 Total = 28 + 19 = 47 Swinefinks!
Response:  If Brinley has five tests with scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86, then his average score is (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 845 / 5 = 169. So he needs to get an additional 4 points on the sixth test to reach an average of 93.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Michael rode his bike at least five times per week and covered 25 kilometers each time. So, he covered a total distance of 125 kilometers (5 x 25) over four weeks. Then, he decided to reduce his riding frequency to twice a week but increase the distance he covers each time to 60 kilometers. This means he covered a total distance of 360 kilometers (2 x 60) over three weeks. Therefore, Michael has covered a total distance of 485 kilometers (125 + 360).
"Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate truffles and 80 jelly beans in Joejeva's jar. Each chocolate truffle weighs twice as much as each jelly bean, so...

$$ \therefore \text{Number of chocolate truffles} = {25 \div 2} = 12 $$

And since each chocolate truffle weighs $2\times$ as much as each jelly bean, we can find the weight of each chocolate truffle by multiplying the number of chocolate truffles by $2$. So...

$$ \therefore \text{Weight of each chocolate truffle} = {12 \times 2} = 24 $$

Now, let's find out how many grams of chocolate are in Joejeva's jar. Since each chocolate truffle weighs $24$, and there are $12$ chocolate truffles in total, we can calculate the total weight of chocolate in the jar as follows:

$$ \therefore \text{Total weight of chocolate in the jar} = {12 \times 24} = 288 $$

Finally, if each piece of chocolate weighs $40$ grams, then the total weight of all the pieces of chocolate in Joejeva's jar is equal to the total weight of chocolate in the jar divided by the weight of each piece of chocolate. Therefore...

$$ \therefore \text{Total weight of all pieces of chocolate in the jar} = {288 \div 40} = 7 \text{ pounds} $$"
"Response:  On Monday, she bought 4 cakes. If she bought x cakes on Tuesday and y cakes on Wednesday, then we can write an equation based on the information given:

x + 3y = 7 (total number of cakes bought)

Now, we know that x + y = 10 (number of cakes bought on Monday plus number of cakes bought on other two days). Substituting this value into our first equation gives us:

2x + 3y = 14

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 4
y = 6

So, she bought 4 cakes on Monday, 6 cakes on Tuesday, and 4 cakes on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of cakes she bought is 4 + 6 + 4 = 14."
Response:  We know that there are 1200 dollars less than 3 sets of decanters worth 1200 dollars each. So, the total value of these three sets is: $1200 + $1200 + $1200 = $3600. Since we were told that one decanter costs 6000 dollars, and we want to find out how much they cost altogether, we can divide the total value by the number of decanters: $3600 / 3 = $1200 per decanter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has already saved $10, so she needs to save an additional $20 = ($30 - $10) for the new jacket and shoes.  Since she earns $5 per hour and works for 2 hours before saving money, she will have earned $10 + $5 = $15. So, she still needs to save $20 - $15 = $5 more. Now, let's calculate how many times she needs to cut grass to save this amount of money: $5 / $4 (the cost of cutting grass) = 1.25 times or 13/4 times. Therefore, Sara needs to cut grass 13/4 times to buy the new jacket and shoes.
Response:  We know that red birds lay 3 eggs per day and white birds lay 5 eggs per day. So, in total, Jerry collects 42 eggs per day. Now, we need to find out how many red birds there are if there are more white birds than red birds. Let's assume that there are x red birds. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Total number of eggs = Number of red birds x 3 + Number of white birds x 5 (Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day) Substituting the values, we get: 3x + 5(x+10) = 42 (Where x is the number of red birds) Solving for x, we get: x = 7 So, there are 7 red birds.
Response:  We know that Gary walked for x hours and he covered a distance of y meters. Since we are given that the park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5x meters wide and 6y meters long, we can find out how many times Gary crossed the length of the park by dividing his walking time by the length of the park:  x / (1.5x) = 6y / (6y) = 1 So, Gary crossed the length of the park once. Therefore, he spent one hour on the spree.
Response:  On day one (Day 1), Sloane had 100 customers in his store. If he gained 50 more customers on Day 2, then he had 150 customers in total (100 + 50 = 150). On Day 3, if there were 500 customers in the store, that means that Sloane gained another 350 customers since Day 1 (150 + 350 = 500). So, the number of customers in the store on Day 3 was 500.
Response:  We know that initially, both basins had an equal amount of water (4 gallons/minute). So, after 4 minutes, the total amount of water in both basins is:  Veliki bazen: 2 x 4 = 8 galonov Majhen bazen: 4 galonov Since now the big basin has four times more water than the small basin, we can conclude that the small basin currently contains:  Small basin: 8 - 4 = 4 galons
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money she will have after working for one hour: $8/hour x 1 hour = $8. Then, we can subtract this amount from the total cost of the shoes and bag: $320 - $8 = $312. So, Lori needs to work for 312 hours (or approximately 13 months) before she can afford to buy the shoes and bag.
"Response:  If Janet has $2000 and promises to pay back with an additional 10% interest for 12 months, then we can calculate how much she will have in her account after 12 months as follows:

Total amount borrowed = $2000
Interest rate (per year) = 10%/year = 0.10
Time period = 12 months
Monthly payment = $165/month

Now, let's use the formula for calculating the future value of a single amount on a regular basis: FV = PV x (1 + r)^n
Where:
FV = Future Value
PV = Present Value ($2000 in this case)
r = Interest Rate (0.10 in this case)
n = Number of periods (12 months in this case)

Substituting the values, we get:
FV = $2000 x (1 + 0.10)^12
= $2437.89

So, after 12 months, Janet will have $2437.89 in her account, including the original $2000 and the accumulated interest of $437.89."
Response:  We know that there are four corners in the room and seven doors more than corners. So, if we have x corners, then we have 7x doors. Now, we need to find out how many flowers are in the village. The number of flowers is equal to the number of doors minus the number of corners. Therefore, the answer is 7x - x = 6x.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet. So, if Harriet is currently 21 years old, then Adrian is 3 x 21 = 63 years old. Secondly, we know that Zack is half as old as Harriet. Therefore, if Harriet is currently 21 years old, then Zack is 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old. Finally, to find the average age of all three over the last three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3: (63 + 10.5) / 3 = 73.5 years.
Response:  We know that the total number of points scored by all students is 251.  Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored more than Naomi but less than Brianna (who scored 17 more points than Naomi), and Jojo did not score any points. So, we can conclude that Jojo scored 0 points. Therefore, the answer is 0.
"Response:  If Carmen needs 10 minutes to solve one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve one Sudoku puzzle, then she has spent a total of:

Time = (Number of crosswords solved) x (Time per crossword) + (Number of Sudoku puzzles solved) x (Time per Sudoku)
= (3) x (10) + (8) x (5)
= 30 + 40
= 70 minutes
Therefore, Carmen has spent 70 minutes playing these two types of puzzles."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 120 liters of water in the reservoir and Celene used 90 liters to irrigate her small garden. So, we have:

Initial amount of water = 120 liters
Amount used for irrigation = 90 liters
Now, we are asked how much water is left in the reservoir after Celene has used some of it. To find this out, we can use the information given in the question:

Total amount of water left in the reservoir = Initial amount of water - Amount used for irrigation
= 120 liters - 90 liters
= 30 liters
Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in the reservoir after Celene has used some of it."
Response:  We know that there are 90 geraniums and 40 petunias. If we assume that each geranium has 5 flowers (which is a reasonable assumption), then the total number of flowers from all geraniums would be:  Number of geraniums x Number of flowers per geranium = 90 x 5 = 450 flowers. Similarly, if each petunia has 3 flowers (also a reasonable assumption), then the total number of flowers from all petunias would be: Number of petunias x Number of flowers per petunia = 40 x 3 = 120 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers that Andy planted is: Total number of flowers = Number of geranium flowers + Number of petunia flowers = 450 + 120 = 570 flowers.
Response:  For year one (Year 1), the company spent $15,000 for advertising. Since it spent only half of that amount in Year 2 (Year 2), we can calculate the total amount spent on advertising over the past two years as follows: Total Amount Spent = ($15,000 x 2) + ($7,500 / 2) = $30,000 + $3,750 = $33,750 So, the company has spent approximately $33,750 on advertising over the past two years.
Response:  If Carlos pays $30 per hour for his canoe rental and Benji pays $18 per hour for his kayak rental, then their total hourly cost will be:  Carlos: $30/hour x 3 hours = $90  Benji: $18/hour x 5 hours = $90 So, together they will pay $90 + $90 = $180 for their rentals.
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and 3 days to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car, then we can calculate the total time as follows:  Total Time = (6 + 3) / 2 = 4.5 days So, if he wants to go from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and come back to New Jersey by himself in his own car, it will take him 4.5 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of cards that James has after he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass cards. So, the updated number of water cards is: 8 - 8 = 0, and the updated number of grass cards is: 14 + 20 = 34. Now, let's find out the probability of randomly selecting a water card from all the remaining cards: The total number of cards left after losing 8 water cards is: 30 - 8 = 22, and the total number of water cards among these remaining cards is: 4 / 22 = 0.182 or approximately 18.2%. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a water card is 0.182 or approximately 18.2%.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much the original burrito cost without any additional items. The price of the burrito is given as $6.50. So, that's our base amount. Then, we add the prices of all the additional items: $2 for more meat, $1 for extra cheese, $1 for avocado, and $0.25 each for two salsas. That gives us a total of $9.75 ($2 + $1 + $1 + $0.25 + $0.25). Since he wants to upgrade to a larger meal with fries and drink, he needs to pay an additional $3, which brings his new total to $12.75. Finally, since he has a $5 gift card, he will get $5 back, leaving him with a balance of $7.75. Therefore, he still owes $5.
Response:  Kalinda can place 4 pieces in 1 minute, so she places 2 pieces every minute (since she is twice as fast).  Her mother takes half that time, or 30 seconds per piece. Therefore, they will need 3 minutes and 20 seconds to complete the puzzle together.
Response:  After two months, Ashlyn returned to find that 30% of the melons were ready for harvesting, which is 36 melons (30% x 120 = 36). Then, she took 30 melons home. Two weeks later, when she came back, 75% of the remaining melons were ready for harvesting, which is 90 melons (75% x 36 = 90). So, there were 90 - 30 = 60 melons left after Ashlyn took some home. Therefore, there were 60 melons not yet ready for harvesting after two weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many cars Mark buys. According to the question, he buys a fleet of 12 cars. So, the total number of cars is 12.  Next, we need to calculate the cost of each car. As per the question, each car costs $20,000. Therefore, the total cost of all 12 cars is:  $20,000 x 12 = $240,000.  Now, let's move on to the taxes and registration fees. The question states that Mark pays 10% tax on each car and an additional $1,000 for registration fee for each car. So, the total amount paid as taxes and registration fees can be calculated as follows:  Taxes: $240,000 x 10% = $24,000 Registration Fees: $24,000 x 12 = $288,000 Total Amount Paid = $240,000 + $288,000 = $528,000 There you have it! Based on the information provided in the question, Mark pays a total of $528,000 for his fleet of 12 cars.
Response:  On Monday (ponedeljek), Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so she collects 5 + 20 = 25 shells.  In Tuesday (torek), Kylie collects twice as many shells as she collected on Monday, so she collects 2 \* 25 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells in Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 ants and Dax collected half of them (which is equal to 25 ants), then there would be 25 - 25 = 0 ants left in the garden after Dax's collection. Since no other insects are mentioned in the problem, we can conclude that all the remaining ants in the garden are gone as well. Therefore, the total number of insects left in the garden after Dax's collection is zero or 0.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 36 penguins are sunbathing on the snow. Then, one-third of them (12) will jump into the water and swim in the sea. Another third of them (12) will go to the cave to eat dinner. So, there will be 36 - (12 + 12) = 9 penguins left on the snow to sunbathe.
"Response:  If Steve eats twice as many radishes as his daughter and he himself grows six times more than his daughter, then:

1. Steve eats 2 x 6 = 12 radishes per day (as much as his daughter)
2. Steve grows 3 x 6 = 18 radishes per day (more than his daughter)

Therefore, if Steve can eat 12 radishes per day, he needs to grow 18 radishes per day to have enough for both him and his daughter. So, the answer is 18 radishes per day."
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend will get 4 pieces of pizza. Since pizzas come in 8 packs, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many packs John needs to buy:  So John needs to buy 5 packs of pizza (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  If he has 5 empty cans and fills them with black paint to make one full can, then he will have 5/1 = 5 full cans of black paint left after filling one can.  Now, if he buys 25 more cans and uses them all up without any black paint left over, then he will have used 25 - 5 = 20 cans of black paint altogether. So, he has 20 full cans of black paint left.
Response:  If Johnny had $100 and then added $10 more, he would have $110. Then, if this amount was invested and grew at a rate of $100 per year for one year, he would have $210 after one year. Therefore, Johnny had $210 after one year.
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jessie. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Mary = Joan - 2
Jessie = Joan + 5
Now, we need to find out how old Joan is. From the previous question, we know that Joan is 20 years old. So, we can substitute this value into one of our equations:
Joan = 20
Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:
Mary = Joan - 2
Mary = 20 - 2
Mary = 18
So, Mary is 18 years old. Now, let's use the second equation to find out how old Jessie is:
Jessie = Joan + 5
Jessie = 20 + 5
Jessie = 25
Therefore, the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessie is 63 (25 + 20 + 18)."
Response:  We know that 30% of the students left through exit A, which means that 300 students (30% x 1000) left through exit A. Now, we need to find out how many students left through exit C. Since 3/5 of the remaining students did not leave through exit B, and they all left through exit C, we can conclude that 600 students (60% x 700 = 4200 - 300) left through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is 600.
Response:  We know that James has more than six bonbons than Robert and that John has twice as many sweets as Robert. So, if John has 54 sweets, then he must have at least 27 sweets (since he has twice as many as Robert). Therefore, we can conclude that John has at least 27 sweets more than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, they will read a total of 3 books if they both read each other's books until the end. Therefore, the answer is 3.
"Response:  If Mike is writing with five people and two of them stop writing after one week, then he will have to write for three weeks to catch up. So, in total, he will write:

3 weeks x 7 days/week = 21 days

And each day he will write:

21 days x 6 minutes/day = 126 minutes

So, Mike spends approximately 126 minutes per day writing."
Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 minutes for the month and he uses 15 minutes of it every day to make calls to his boss. So, he has 1000 / 15 = 66.67 minutes left after making daily calls to his boss. Now, we are told that he also makes additional calls to other people for 30 minutes per day. So, he has 66.67 - 30 = 36.67 minutes left for other calls. Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason has 36.67 x 30 = 1099.8 minutes left at the end of the month.
Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 carrots and gave some to Ginger. Then, Kyle took 5 carrots from Griffin. So, Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 carrots left. After that, Billy took twice as many carrots as Kyle, which means he took 2 x 5 = 10 carrots from Griffin. Finally, Colby took 3 fewer carrots than Kyle, so he took 3 - 5 = -2 carrots from Griffin (since he took more than he gave). Therefore, the final number of carrots Griffin had was 19 - (-2) = 21 carrots.
"Response:  In the first aquarium, there are 4 crabs and in the second one, there are 32 fish. The difference between the number of crabs in both aquariums is twice as much as the number of fish in each aquarium. If both aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each aquarium? We can write an equation based on this information: Number of fish in Aquarium A = x Number of fish in Aquarium B = 2x Where ""x"" represents the unknown value that we want to find. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into the equation: Number of fish in Aquarium A = 4 Number of fish in Aquarium B = 2(32) = 64 Therefore, there are 4 fish in Aquarium A and 64 fish in Aquarium B."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours she works per day: 6 x 4 = 24 hours/day Secondly, we need to calculate how many days she works during the movie duration: 5 days Thirdly, we need to multiply the total working hours with her hourly rate: $250/hour x 24 hours/day x 5 days = $37,500 Fourthly, we subtract the artist's discount from the total amount paid: $37,500 - ($37,500 x 10%) = $33,750 Therefore, Jean has paid $33,750 for the five-day movie shoot.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Isabella spent $12 on torto for her sister's birthday party. Since she divided the cost among three parts with her parents, each part will be $12 / 3 = $4 per parent. So, each of Isabella's parents paid $4 for the torto.  Next, let's consider the other expenses. For the decorations, Isabella spent $15, so each of her parents paid $15 / 3 = $5 for the decorations. Similarly, for the invitations, she spent $4, so each of her parents paid $4 / 3 = $1.33 for the invitations. Finally, for the gift bags, she spent $22, so each of her parents paid $22 / 3 = $7.67 for the gift bags. Therefore, the total amount each of Isabella's parents paid is $4 + $5 + $1.33 + $7.67 = $20.  Hence, each of Isabella's parents paid $20.
"Response:  We know that the total weight of the four barrels is equal to the number of barrels times the weight of each barrel. So if we have 4 barrels and each barrel weights 50 pounds (or $50), then the total weight of all 4 barrels is:
$$ Total = 4 \times 50 = 200 $$ pounds or $200. Now, we are told that the kilogram price of one barrel of garlic is $1.50. Since there are 1600 grams in 1 pound ($1.50 / $1.00 per pound), we can calculate the cost of each barrel as follows:
$$ Cost = 200 \div 1600 = 0.125 \times 1.50 = 0.1875 $$ dollars per barrel. Therefore, the total cost of all 4 barrels would be:
$$ Total Cost = 4 \times 0.1875 = 0.75 $$ dollars."
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate four times as many peas as her sister. So she ate 4 x 4 = 16 peas. In Tuesday, she ate twice as much as her sister, so she ate 2 x 16 = 32 peas. Her sister ate 5 peas on Monday and 13 peas on Tuesday. Therefore, Sue ate more than her sister by (32 - 18) = 14 peas. Since each pea has 200 calories, Sue consumed 14 x 200 = 2800 calories more than her sister.
