Response:  First, we know that Bebek Janet lays eggs 16 times a day and sells each fresh egg for $2 at the farmer's market. So, she sells 16 x $2 = $32 worth of eggs per day.  Next, we know that she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning, so she only has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left to sell. Therefore, her daily income from selling eggs is $32 - $13 = $19.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the dress needs 2 bolts of blue serge and half a bolt of white serge.  A bolt is a unit of measurement for fabric, typically measuring 15 yards or 13.7 meters.  So, to calculate how much blue serge is needed, we can multiply 2 (the number of bolts) by 15 (the length of one bolt):  Blue Serge = 2 x 15 = 30 yards  Now, let's calculate how much white serge is needed. Since we need half a bolt, we can use the same formula as before: White Serge = 0.5 x 15 = 7.5 yards  Therefore, the total amount of fabric needed for the dress is: Total Fabric = Blue Serge + White Serge = 30 + 7.5 = 37.5 yards
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of renovation which is given as $50,000. Then, we can calculate the new value of the house after renovation by multiplying the original price with 1.15 (which represents the increase in value due to renovation). So, the new value of the house = $80,000 x 1.15 = $92,000. Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the original price from the new value: Profit = $92,000 - $80,000 = $12,000. Therefore, Josh made a profit of $12,000 from the renovation project.
Response: 1) Number of sprints per week = 3 2) Distance of each sprint = 60 meters 3) Total distance run per week = number of sprints x distance of each sprint Therefore, the total distance James runs per week is: 3 x 60 = 180 meters
Response:  Firstly, we know that Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day and each meal consists of a mixture of grains, worms, and vegetables to maintain their health. Secondly, she gives them 15 bowls of food in the morning and 25 bowls of food in the afternoon. Finally, we are asked how many bowls of food Wendi needs to give to her chickens on the last day if there are 20 chickens in total. To solve this problem, let's start with the information given:  Morning feeding: 15 x 20 = 300 bowls Afternoon feeding: 25 x 20 = 500 bowls Total daily feeding: 300 + 500 = 800 bowls Since there are 3 days in total, Wendi needs to provide 800 x 3 = 2400 bowls of food for all 20 chickens over the course of three days. Therefore, the answer is 2400.
Response:  First, we know that each glass costs $5, so if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, she will need to pay $5 x 16 = $80.  However, we also know that each additional glass after the first one is only 60% of the original price, or $3 (since $5 x 0.6 = $3). So, for the remaining 15 glasses, Kylar will pay $3 x 15 = $45. In total, then, Kylar will pay $80 + $45 = $125.
Response:  First, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So if Charleston has x sheep, Toulouse will have 2x sheep.  Next, we know that Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So if Seattle has x sheep, Charleston will have 4x sheep.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  2x = 4(x)  Simplifying the equation:  2x = 4x  Solving for x:  2x = 5x  Divide both sides by 2:   x = 10  Therefore, there are 10 sheep in Seattle.  To find out how many sheep Toulouse and Charleston have, we can use our previous equations:   Toulouse has 2x = 2(10) = 20 sheep.  Charleston has 4x = 4(10) = 40 sheep.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download 2 GB per minute. So if she has to download a 200 GB file, it will take her approximately minutes to complete the download. However, as mentioned in the problem statement, Windows requires her to restart her computer every 20 minutes for updates, which means she will have to start the download from scratch each time. Therefore, the total number of restarts required is:  
Now, let's calculate the total amount of time spent downloading and restarting:  Total time = (number of restarts) x (time taken for each restart) + (total download time)  Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:  Total time = (20) x (20 minutes) + (minutes)  Simplifying and solving for the total time, we get:  Total time = hours  Therefore, Carla would need approximately hours to download the 200 GB file, assuming she has to restart her computer every 20 minutes for updates."
Response:  First, we know that John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour (mph). This means he covered a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 60 mph x 3 hrs Distance = 180 miles Next, we know that John spent 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he only traveled for half of the time he was driving. Therefore, the distance he traveled during the last two hours is: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 60 mph x 2 hrs Distance = 120 miles Since John had to drive slowly for half an hour because of heavy traffic, his average speed for the entire journey is: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time Average Speed = (180 + 120) / 5 hrs Average Speed = 300 / 5 hrs Average Speed = 60 mph Finally, we can calculate how far John is from home based on his average speed and the total time he took to complete the journey: Distance = Average Speed x Time Distance = 60 mph x 4 hrs Distance = 240 miles So, John is 240 miles away from home at the end of the 4-hour journey.
"Response:  First, we know that Eliza earns $10 per hour and works for 40 hours her first week. So, her total earnings for the week are:  
$10 x 40 = $400  Next, we know that she also receives overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular rate for each hour worked beyond 40 hours. So, if she works an additional 5 hours (45 - 40), her overtime pay would be:  
$10 x 1.2 x 5 = $60  Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:  
$400 + $60 = $460"
Response:  First month: 60 downloads Second month: 3 x (60) = 180 downloads Third month: 3 x (180) = 540 downloads Total downloads for three months: 60 + 180 + 540 = 780 downloads
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item that Toula bought.  For the donuts, there are 3 lusin x $ 68 = $ 204.  For the cupcakes, there are 2 lusin x $ 80 = $ 160.  And for the cheesecakes, there are 6 lusin x $ 55 = $ 330.  Now let's add up all these costs: $ 204 + $ 160 + $ 330 = $ 794.  So the total cost is $ 794.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the lemon tree for one year. Total Cost = Planting Cost + Annual Maintenance Cost Total Cost = $90 + $3 = $93 So, the total cost of planting and maintaining the lemon tree for one year is $93. Next, let's calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree. We know that he will harvest 7 lemons per year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, his annual income from the lemon tree will be: Income = Number of Lemons x Price per Lemon Income = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 So, Carlos will make an annual income of $10.5 from the lemon tree. Now, let's subtract the annual maintenance cost ($3) from the annual income ($10.5) to find out when Carlos will start making a profit: Profit = Income - Maintenance Cost Profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 So, Carlos will start making a profit from the lemon tree after 7.5 years (since he needs to pay back the initial investment of $93).
Response:  First, we know that Melanie sold one third of the dust collectors to the green house, so she has two left.  Next, she sold two more to the red house, leaving her with five - two = three. Finally, she sold half of what was left (three) to the yellow house, leaving her with five - three = two. So, Melanie started with five vacuum cleaners.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance and 25% of the remaining students (i.e., those who did not enroll in contemporary dance) enrolled in jazz dance. Therefore, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is: 

25% of 80% of 20 students = 20 x 0.8 x 0.25 = 4 students 

Now, we can calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance as follows: 

100 - (20 + 4) = 100 - 24 = 76% 

Therefore, 76% of the total 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the expected return of each investment option. For the jewelry investment, the expected return is:  
Expected Return = (Price Appreciation x 100) / Investment Amount  For the gadget investment, the expected return is:  
Expected Return = (Price Appreciation x 100) / Investment Amount  Now, let's calculate the price appreciation for both options. For the jewelry option, the price appreciation is:  
Price Appreciation = (2.5% x $5,000) = $125  For the gadget option, the price appreciation is:  
Price Appreciation = (1.2% x $8,000) = $96  Next, we can calculate the expected returns for each option:  
Jewelry Option Expected Return = ($125 x 100) / $5,000 = 25% Gadget Option Expected Return = ($96 x 100) / $8,000 = 12%  Based on these calculations, if the pedagogue wants to maximize profits at the end of the month, it would be better to choose the jewelry investment option, which has an expected return of 25%, compared to the gadget investment option with an expected return of 12%."
Response:  First day, both trains travel west for 80 miles. So, the distance traveled by each train is 80 miles. Second day, they travel north for 150 miles. Total distance traveled by each train in two days is: Distance = (80 + 150) miles = 230 miles.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much she earns per week as a teacher and as a cheerleading coach.  As a teacher, she earns $20 per hour x 35 hours per week = $700 per week.  As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30 per hour x 15 hours per week = $450 per week.  Now, let's calculate her annual salary.  As a teacher, she earns $700 per week x 50 weeks per year = $35,000 per year.  As a cheerleading coach, she earns $450 per week x 50 weeks per year = $22,500 per year.  Therefore, her total annual salary is $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500 per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Claire makes 3 eggs omelets every morning for breakfast. That means she consumes 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Claire eats 21 x 4 = 84 eggs per month. Therefore, if Claire continues to eat 3 eggs omelets every morning for 4 months (or 16 weeks), she will consume 84 x 16 = 1344 eggs.
Response:  First, we know that Marissa needs 1 hour to walk 4 miles at a certain speed.  So, her speed for the first 4 miles is:  4 miles / 1 hour = 4 miles/hour  Now, she has 8 miles left to cover, and she wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour.  To find out how long it will take her to cover the remaining distance, we can use the formula:  Total time = Distance / Speed  In this case, the total time is the time it takes her to cover the last 8 miles.  We know that she walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, so we can plug in the values as follows:  Total time = 8 miles / 4 miles/hour = 2 hours  Therefore, Marissa will need 2 hours to walk the remaining 8 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
"Response:  First, we know that 10 liters of lemon juice contains 3 parts water and 7 parts lemon juice. So, if we add 10 liters of lemon juice to 15 liters of pineapple juice (which contains 3/5 water), what will be the ratio of water to lemon juice in the final mixture?  To find out, we need to calculate how much water is added to the pineapple juice when we mix it with the lemon juice. We can do this by multiplying the amount of lemon juice by the ratio of water to lemon juice:  
3/7 x 10 = 4/7 liters of water  
So, 4/7 liters of water are added to the pineapple juice. Now, let's find out how much lemon juice is added to the pineapple juice:  
(10 - 4)/7 = 6/7 liters of lemon juice  
Therefore, there are 6/7 liters of lemon juice in the final mixture for every 15 liters of pineapple juice. Since you spilled one liter of lemon juice, there are now 5/7 liters of lemon juice left in the final mixture. Finally, to find out how much water is left in the final mixture, we can subtract the amount of lemon juice from the total volume of the mixture:  
15 + 6 - 5 = 16 liters of water  
So, there are 16 liters of water left in the final mixture after adding 10 liters of lemon juice to 15 liters of pineapple juice and spilling one liter of lemon juice."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.  Next, we are told that Raymond had a child at the age of 23, so his child was born when Raymond was 23 years old. Therefore, the child was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 3 pelanggan pertama membeli 1 DVD each. So, they bought 3 DVD in total.  Next, we know that 2 pelanggan berikutnya membeli 2 DVD each. So, they bought 4 DVD in total (2 x 2 = 4). In total, there are 3 + 4 = 7 DVD sold to these 5 customers. Now, we need to find out how many DVD were left unsold. Since 3 pelanggan terakhirnya did not buy any DVD, so there are no DVD left for them. Therefore, the number of DVD left unsold is 7 - 0 = 7. So, Billy sold 7 DVD on Tuesday.
Response:  First, we know that the candle burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So if it burns for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), it will burn a total of 5 x 2 = 10 cm. Therefore, the length of the candle after burning for 5 hours will be 10 cm - 2 cm = 8 cm shorter than its original length.
Response:  First, we know that Kyle bought the book last year at a discount of 25% off the original price. So, if he paid $19.50 for the book, what was the original price before the discount? We can set up an equation to represent this situation:  Original Price = (Discounted Price x 100) / Discount Percentage  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Original Price = ($19.50 x 100) / 25%  Simplifying and solving for the original price, we have:  Original Price = $19.50 x 4 = $78  Therefore, the original price of the book before the discount was $78.
"Response:  First, we know that Marie paid a total of $50 for all the items she ordered.  So, let's list down all the items and their prices:  
Ayam meal - $12 Susu (5 pack) - $3 Apples (4 pieces) - $1.50 Pizza (x) - $8.50 Total = $50 Now, we can start solving for x, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. We know that the total cost of all the items is $50, so we can write an equation based on that:  
$12 + $3 + $1.50 + x($8.50) = $50 To solve for x, we can first add up all the costs without the pizza:  
$12 + $3 + $1.50 = $16.50 So, the remaining amount to pay for the pizza is:  
$50 - $16.50 = $33.50 Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the remaining amount by the price per box:  
$33.50 ÷ $8.50 = 4 boxes Therefore, Marie ordered 4 boxes of pizza."
Response:  First, we know that Mishka bought three pairs of shorts, so she spent 3 x $16.50 = $49.50 on shorts. Next, she bought three pairs of pants, so she spent 3 x $22.50 = $67.50 on pants. Finally, she bought three pairs of shoes, so she spent 3 x $42 = $126 on shoes. In total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243. Total amount spent by Mishka is $243.
Response:  First, we know that Cynthia consumes one serving of ice cream every night, so she eats 30 servings in 30 days (since there are 30 days in April).  Since each carton contains 15 servings, Cynthia will finish one carton in 2 days (30/15 = 2).  Therefore, if Cynthia buys 60 cartons of ice cream, she will consume all 60 cartons in 120 days (2 x 60 = 120).
Response:  First, we know that Henry stopped for 20 miles (perhentian pertama). Then he continued his journey and stopped again after 15 miles (perhentian kedua) before reaching the end of his trip. So, to find out how far Henry traveled between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the total distance he traveled. Total distance = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles Therefore, Henry traveled 40 miles between the two stops.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one pair of high heels is $33 and the other pair is twice as much, so the price of the second pair of high heels is 2 x $33 = $66. Now, we need to find out how much the boots cost. We are given that the total amount Gloria has budgeted for her shoes is $100. So, if she buys two pairs of high heels, she will spend $33 + $66 = $99. Since she wants to buy only one pair of boots, she can afford to spend $100 - $99 = $1 on the boots. Therefore, the price of the boots is $1.
"Response:  We know that Umur Darrel is 7 times as old as Allen, so we can write an equation based on this information:  UD = 7A ... where UD stands for ""Umur Darrel"" and A stands for ""Allen"".  Now we are given that the total age of both individuals is 162 years. So we can set up another equation:  UD + A = 162 ... combining like terms:  7A + A = 162 ... simplifying:  8A = 162 ... dividing both sides by 8:  A = 20 ... since Allen is 20 years old.  Now we can find out how old Umur Darrel is:  UD = 7A ... substituting A = 20:  UD = 7(20) ... calculating:  UD = 140 ... therefore, Umur Darrel is 140 years old."
Response:  First, we know that there are x jelly beans in the jar. Second, we have three different estimates from Gunter's friends: 80, 20 more than half of the first estimate (which is 80), and 25% more than the first estimate (which is also 80). We can start by writing down these estimates as equations:  80 + 20 =? 80 + 25%(80) =? Now let's solve for x. For the first equation, we add 20 to both sides: 80 + 20 = 100. So, according to the first friend, there are 100 jelly beans in the jar. For the second equation, we multiply 80 by 1.25 (to find 25% of 80): 80 x 1.25 = 100. So, according to the third friend, there are also 100 jelly beans in the jar. Therefore, based on all three estimates, the average or median number of jelly beans in the jar is 100.
"Response:  There are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if John spends 0.5 hours per day taking care of his dogs, how many hours does he spend on dog care per week?  
To find out, we can multiply the number of days he spends on dog care (1) by the amount of time he spends on dog care per day (0.5):  
1 x 0.5 = 0.5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 3.5 hours/week  
Therefore, John spends 3.5 hours per week taking care of his dogs."
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and there are 30 gold coins more than silver coins. So we can start by finding out how many silver coins she has first. Since there are 30 gold coins more than silver coins, it means that for every silver coin she has, she also has 30 gold coins. Therefore, if she has x silver coins, she will have 30x gold coins as well. Now let's use this information to find out how many coins she has altogether. We know that the sum of all her coins is 110. So we can write an equation based on this: x + 30x = 110... 29x = 110... x = 4 To find out how many silver coins she has, we can substitute the value of x into one of the equations: 30x = 4 \* 30... 30x = 120... x = 4 So Gretchen has 4 silver coins and 4 * 30 = 120 gold coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's number of gems. So if Raymond has x gems, Aaron will have 5 + (x/2) = 5 + x/4 gems.  Now we are told that Siobhan has fewer gems than Aaron by 2 less. Therefore, Siobhan has 5 + x/4 - 2 gems.  Since Siobhan has fewer gems than Aaron, her total must be less than or equal to Aaron's total.  So we can set up an inequality:  5 + x/4 - 2 <= 5 + x/4  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  3x/4 <= 7  Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:  12 <= 3x  Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us:  3x - 12 >= 0  Adding 12 to both sides gives us:  3x >= 24  Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:  x >= 8  Therefore, Raymond has at least 8 gems.  And since Siobhan has fewer gems than Aaron by 2 less, she has at most 5 + 6 = 11 gems.
Response:  First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. So, if we multiply 4 by 1 (since there are no additional points), we get 4 points for the first 20 minutes. Now, let's look at the second 20 minutes. We know that Mike scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we can multiply the number of points he scored in the first 20 minutes by 1.25 (since he scored 25% more). Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is: 4 x 1.25 = 5 points.
Response:  First, we know that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, so he consumes 6 yogurts per week (2 x 3 = 6).  Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Terry consumes 6 x 4 = 24 yogurts per month.  Now, let's calculate how many yogurts Terry will consume over 30 days:  24 yogurts/month x 1 month / 30 days = 8 yogurts/day x 30 days = 240 yogurts   Therefore, Terry will consume 240 yogurts during a 30-day period.
"Response:  First, we know that John sold all of his Lego sets for $15 each, so he made a total of:  
13 x $15 = $195  
Now, we know that John used this money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, so he spent a total of:  
8 x $20 = $160  
So, John has $5 left over. Therefore, the number of Lego sets John still has is:  
$195 - $160 = $35  
Therefore, John still has 35 Lego sets."
Response:  Firstly, we know that John runs for 3 hours per week, which is equivalent to 12 hours per month (3 x 4 weeks).  Next, we know that he runs for half of the remaining two days each week, so he runs for half of 2 days x 2 hours per day = 4 hours per week.  Therefore, John runs for a total of 12 + 4 = 16 hours per month.  To find out how fast he runs, let's divide his running time by the number of minutes in an hour: 16 hours / 60 minutes/hour = 25 minutes per mile.  So, John runs at a pace of approximately 25 minutes per mile.
"Response:  First, we know that Dana can run at 4 times the speed of her walking speed. So if she walks at x miles per hour, she runs at 4x miles per hour.  Now, we are given that Dana can jump with a speed of 3 miles per hour. This means that for every hour she spends running, she can cover 3 miles.  Since she spends 1/3 of her time running and 2/3 of her time walking, let's calculate how far she can go in each case:  
Running: She spends 1/3 of her time running, so she covers 3 miles / 1 = 3 miles in one hour.  
Walking: She spends 2/3 of her time walking, so she covers x miles / 2 = 2x miles in one hour.  Now, we want to find out how far Dana can go in six hours. For running:  She covers 3 miles in one hour, so she covers 3 x 6 = 18 miles in six hours.  For walking:  She covers 2x miles in one hour, so she covers 2x x 6 = 12 miles in six hours.  Therefore, Dana can go 18 miles while running and 12 miles while walking in six hours."
Response:  Firstly, we know that iPhone Ben is two years older than iPhone Suzy. So, if iPhone Suzy is one year old, then iPhone Ben must be one year + two years = three years old.  Next, we know that iPhone Brandon is four times as old as iPhone Ben. Therefore, if iPhone Ben is three years old, then iPhone Brandon would be three x four = twelve years old.  Finally, we are told that iPhone Brandon is five years older than iPhone Ben. So, if iPhone Ben is twelve years old, then iPhone Brandon would be twelve + five = seventeen years old.  Thus, the correct answer is seventeen years old.
Response:  First, we know that without the batu permata (safir), Polly can throw her tombak emas for 400 feet.  Second, with the batu permata, she can throw it three times as far, so that's 3 x 400 = 1200 feet.  Now, we need to find out how much farther she can throw the tombak emas than the range of the naga's fire.  We are given that the naga's fire reaches 1000 feet.  So, if Polly throws the tombak emas from 1200 feet away, it will still be within the range of the naga's fire.  Therefore, the furthest she can stand and still hit the naga with the tombak emas is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the naga.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 pieces of cake and each piece is cut into 8 equal parts. So, in total, there are 5 x 8 = 40 parts of cake. Now, if there are 14 leftover parts after everyone has taken their share, then we can deduce that:  
14 = 40 - (number of parts taken by guests)  
Solving for the number of parts taken by guests, we get:  
Number of parts taken by guests = 40 - 14 = 26  
Therefore, each guest took 26/8 = 3 portions of cake."
Response:  First, we know that one serving of potato chips (250 calories) contains 5 servings (300g). Therefore, if we want to consume 2000 calories daily and have already consumed 1800 calories, we can calculate how much more we can eat based on the remaining calorie needs.  Calculation: Daily Caloric Needs - Total Consumed Calories = Additional Calories Allowed 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories allowed So, we can eat an additional 200 grams of potato chips (based on the previous calculation of 5 servings per 300g).
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of making one lilin. We know that the cost per unit is $10.00 and he can make 10 units per pound of wax. So, the cost of making one lilin is: Cost = $10.00 / 10 units/lb x 1 lb = $1.00 per lilin. Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all 20 lilin. If each lilin costs $2.00, then the total revenue would be: Revenue = 20 lilin x $2.00/lilin = $40.00. Finally, we subtract the cost of making the lilins from the total revenue to find the profit: Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40.00 - $1.00 = $39.00. Therefore, if Charlie makes and sells 20 lilin, his net profit would be $39.00.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 more articles on Tuesday than she did on Monday. So, if she wrote x articles on Monday, then she wrote 2x/5 + x = 3x/5 articles on Tuesday (since she wrote twice as many articles on Tuesday as she did on Monday).  On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday, so she wrote 2(3x/5) = 6x/5 articles on Wednesday.  Therefore, in three days, Meredith wrote a total of 5 + 3x/5 + 6x/5 = 14x/5 articles.  Now, let's find out how much time she spent writing these articles. We know that each article takes her approximately 4 hours to write, so she spent 4 hours x 14x/5 = 56x/5 hours writing all the articles.  Finally, we need to convert this fraction to an integer. Since 56 is greater than 50, we can round up to the nearest whole number, so Meredith spent approximately 57 hours writing these articles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Candice had 80 catatan in her bag before she went to work at the coffee shop. Secondly, we know that she bought a pack of Post-it notes with 23 sticky notes left over. Finally, we know that she placed one sticky note on each of the 220 different cups of coffee she served. So, how many sticky notes were in the pack that Candice bought?  To solve this problem, let's use algebra! We can set up an equation based on the information given:  Let x be the number of sticky notes in the pack that Candice bought. Since there are 80 catatan in total, and Candice used 220 sticky notes, we know that:  x + 220 = 80... (1) Now, we also know that there are 23 sticky notes leftover, so we can add that to our previous equation: x + 220 + 23 = 80... (2) Simplifying both equations, we get: x + 243 = 80... (combined equation) Solving for x, we get: x = 56... (answer) Therefore, there were 56 sticky notes in the pack that Candice bought.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John bought two more times as many red plates as blue plates. So if he bought x blue plates, he bought 2x red plates.  Secondly, we know that the price of each red plate is 50% higher than the price of each blue plate. So the cost of one red plate is $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.  Finally, we know that John spent $200 in total for both types of plates. Therefore, the total cost of blue plates is $200 / $40 per plate = 5 plates.  Now, let's find out how many red plates John bought. Since he bought twice as many red plates as blue plates, and he bought 5 blue plates, he bought 5 x 2 = 10 red plates.  So, John bought 10 red plates and 5 blue plates.
"Response:  We know that Tracy has a piece of wire 4 feet long (48 inches) and she cuts it into pieces that are 6 inches long each. To find out how many pieces she can get, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:  
48 inches / 6 inches =?  The result is:  
48 / 6 = 8  So Tracy can get 8 pieces of wire that are each 6 inches long from her original 4-foot piece of wire."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units. So, total number of units = 15 x 8 = 120.  Next, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means 3/4 x 120 = 90 units are occupied. Therefore, the number of vacant units = 120 - 90 = 30.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many eggs Lloyd sells in one day:  
252 eggs/day x $2/dozen = $50.40/day (rounded to the nearest dollar)  Now, let's calculate how much Lloyd makes in one week:  
$50.40/day x 7 days/week = $352.80/week (rounded to the nearest dollar)  So, Lloyd makes $352.80 per week selling eggs."
Response:  First, we know that the speed of the ship is 10 miles per hour (mph). We also know that it travels for 4 hours in the afternoon. So, to calculate how far the ship has traveled, we can multiply the speed by the time: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 10 mph x 4 h Distance = 40 miles The ship then returns at 6 mph. To find out how long it takes to return, we can divide the distance by the speed: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 40 miles / 6 mph Time = 6.67 hours or approximately 6 hours and 42 minutes.
"Response:  First, we know that the weight of the comic books is 1/4 ton each, so if there are 30 comic books, their total weight is: 

30 x 1/4 = 7 1/2 pounds 

Now, let's find out how much weight Uria needs to remove from her backpack to meet her goal of losing 15 pounds. We can subtract the weight of the comic books from the original weight of the backpack: 

Original weight - 7 1/2 pounds = 15 - 7 1/2 = 7 1/2 pounds 

So, Uria needs to remove 7 1/2 pounds from her backpack to achieve her goal. Since the weight of the comics is 7 1/2 pounds, she should remove all 30 comic books from her backpack!"
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic earned $60 x 6 = $360 from repairing truck tires and $40 x 4 = $160 from repairing car tires, for a total of $360 + $160 = $520.  On Friday, the mechanic did not repair any truck tires but earned $40 x 12 = $480 from repairing car tires. Therefore, the mechanic's total earnings for the week were $520 + $480 = $1,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Patchy has three times as many kittens as Trixie. So if Trixie has 12 kittens, then Patchy must have 3 x 12 = 36 kittens.  Now, let's add up all the kittens owned by both cats: 36 (Patchy) + 12 (Trixie) = 48 kittens in total.  Therefore, the Doubtfire family now owns 48 kittens!
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jean has 30 permen and she eats 2 of them. So, she has 30 - 2 = 28 permen left. Now, we want to pack 2 permen in one box. We can do this 28/2 = 14 times. Therefore, Jean can fill 14 boxes with her remaining permen.
"Response:  First, we know that Peter needs to spend $7 for each ticket and $7 for popcorn, so he will need a total of $14 to go to the movies.  If he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies how many times?  We can set up an equation:  
$42 - $14 =?  Solving for x (the number of times he can go), we get:  
$42 - $14 = $28  So, Peter can go to the movies 28 / $14 = 2 times."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the weight of each box is 15 pounds (15 pon). Secondly, we are given that the total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds (3755 pon). Thirdly, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge. To do this, we subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the maximum weight allowed for the bridge, which is 5000 pounds (5000 pon): 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds (1245 pon) This means that we have 1245 pounds (1245 pon) available to load onto the truck. Since each box weighs 15 pounds (15 pon), we can divide the available weight by the weight of one box to determine how many boxes can be loaded: 1245 / 15 = 82 boxes Therefore, we can load up to 82 boxes onto the truck without exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge.
Response:  First, we know that Stephen paid $40 for his purchase.  Next, we know that there was a shipping fee of $3 (25% of $12). So, what is the final price after adding the shipping fee?  We can calculate this as follows:  Final Price = $40 + $3 = $43  Now, Stephen also added a tip of $4. This means the total amount he paid for his purchase, including the shipping fee and the tip, is: Total Amount = Final Price + Tip = $43 + $4 = $47
"Response:  First, we know that each group of raspberries has 20 berries. So if there are 6 groups, then there are 6 x 20 = 120 raspberries in all.  But wait, it says ""tersebar"" which means scattered. So some of these raspberries might not be in any particular group. Let's add up the number of raspberries that are not in any group. There are 67 such raspberries.  Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 jeruk in total and 2 of them are asam (sour). So, the number of good jeruk is 25 - 2 = 23. Next, we know that 20% of the jeruk are not yet ripe, so we need to subtract 20% of 23, which is 23 x 0.2 = 4.6. Therefore, the number of good jeruk is 23 - 4.6 = 18.4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a jeruk, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 19. So, there are 19 good jeruk.
Response:  First, we know that Janet paid $500 for materials to make the brooch. Then she paid $800 for the craftsmanship of the jeweler. Finally, she paid 10% of the total cost as insurance. So, first let's calculate the total cost: Total Cost = Materials + Craftsmanship Total Cost = $500 + $800 Total Cost = $1300 Now, let's calculate the amount of insurance premium: Insurance Premium = Total Cost x 10% Insurance Premium = $1300 x 10% Insurance Premium = $130 Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1300 for the brooch, including $500 for materials and $800 for craftsmanship, plus an additional $130 for insurance premiums.
Response:  First, we know that Marcy has worked for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000. Second, we know that after 20 years, she is entitled to receive 5% of her pension amount each year. So, if she retires after 30 years, what will her pension be?  To find out, we need to calculate how much her pension would have grown in those extra 10 years.  We can do this by using the formula:  Pension = (Initial Amount x (1 + Interest Rate)^Number of Years) - (Interest Rate x Number of Years)  Where:  Initial Amount = $50,000  Interest Rate = 5% (since she gets 5% more each year)  Number of Years = 30 (the number of years she works beyond 20 years)  Plugging in these values, we get:  Pension = ($50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^30) - (0.05 x 30)  Using a calculator or spreadsheet, we can calculate the present value of this future pension as follows:  Present Value = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^30  Approximately:  Present Value = $867,942.82  Therefore, if Marcy retires after 30 years, her pension would be approximately $867,942.82.
"Response:  First, we know that Aleena pays $140 per month for her streaming service.  If she pays this amount for 6 months (paruh pertama tahun), then she has paid a total of:  
$140 x 6 = $840 (for first half year)  Now, if the company reduces the price by 10% for the second half year, the new price would be:  
$840 x 0.9 = $756 (for second half year)  So, the total amount Aleena will pay for the entire year is:  
$840 + $756 = $1,596"
Response:  First, we know that Sophia has driven 160 kilometers since her last fill-up and she needs to fill up with 4 gallons of gasoline. We can start by converting kilometers to miles: 160 km x (1 mi / 1.60934 km) = 99.4 miles So far, Sophia has driven 99.4 miles since her last fill-up. Next, we need to calculate how many gallons of gasoline she has used based on the distance she has traveled: 99.4 miles / (mpg of her car) = gallons of gasoline used where mpg is the mileage per gallon of her car. Unfortunately, we don't have access to this information, so we cannot complete the calculation. However, we do know that Sophia needs to fill up with 4 gallons of gasoline. Therefore, if we subtract the amount of gasoline she has already used from the total capacity of her tank, we can determine how far she can drive with one tank of gasoline: Total capacity of her tank - gallons of gasoline used = distance she can drive with one tank of gasoline 12 gal - x = distance she can drive with one tank of gasoline where x is the number of gallons of gasoline used Based on the problem, we can set up an equation: 12 gal - x = distance she can drive with one tank of gasoline To solve for x, we can add 12 gal to both sides of the equation: 12 gal + x = distance she can drive with one tank of gasoline Now we can simplify the left side of the equation: 12 gal + x = 12 gal + (99.4 miles / mpg) = 12 gal + (99.4 miles / mpg) miles To find out how far Sophia can drive with one tank of gasoline, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the conversion factor between miles and gallons: 12 gal + (99.4 miles / mpg) = 12 gal + (99.4 miles / mpg) x (1 gal / 3.78541 liters) = 12 gal + (99.4 miles / mpg) x (1 / 
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to sleep and read for half an hour. This means he spends 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours on these activities each time. Since he does this three times a week, his total weekly screen time is 2.5 x 3 = 7.5 hours. Now, let's calculate his total screen time over 4 weeks: 7.5 x 4 = 30 hours. So, Jim spends 30 hours in front of screens (TV and reading) over the course of 4 weeks.
Response:  We know that each school has sent two teams (male and female) with 5 players each, so the total number of players is:  2 x 5 = 10 players/school x 4 schools = 40 players Total number of people sent by all schools = 40 players + 4 coaches (one coach for each team) = 44 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 175 diamonds in total. Secondly, we know that there are less than 35 rubies compared to diamonds. Thirdly, we know that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. Therefore, if we let X be the number of rubies, then the number of emeralds is 2X. Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  175 = X + (2X) + Y  where Y represents the number of other precious stones (not including diamonds and rubies). Simplifying the equation:  175 = 3X + Y Solving for X:  X = 50  So, there are 50 rubies in the treasure chest. And since there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, there are 100 emeralds in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 60 girls and 5 boys for each teacher. So if we have x teachers, then we can write the equation as follows:  
60 + 5x = 120 (since there are 120 students in total)  Now we can solve this equation to find out how many teachers there are. To do this, we need to isolate the variable ""x"" or the number of teachers.  We can start by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation since 60 is already present on one side of the equation:  
5x = 60 + 5x - 60  Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation gives us:  
4x = 120 - 60  Evaluating the expression 4x gives us:  
4x = 60  Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 gives us:  
x = 15  Therefore, there are 15 teachers at Dr. Wertz School."
"Response:  We know that Bailey received $5 per week for 8 weeks, so she received a total of:  
$5 x 8 = $40  And we also know that at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey had $100. So, if Bailey started with $x, we can set up an equation as follows:  
$x + $40 = $100  Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 40 = 100  Subtracting 40 from both sides:  
2x = 60  Dividing both sides by 2:  
x = 30  Therefore, Bailey started with $30."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many students Judy teaches in total.  She teaches 5 classes per day x 7 days = 35 classes per week.  Since each class has 15 students, she teaches a total of 35 x 15 = 525 students per week.  Now, let's calculate her weekly income.  If she charges $15 per student, then her weekly income would be 525 x $15 = $7,875 per week.  Finally, since there are 4 weeks in a month, her monthly income would be 7,875 x 4 = $31,500 per month.
Response:  If Kelian has two recipes for preparing meals, one with 20 instructions and the other with twice as many instructions as the first one, then the second recipe must have 40 instructions (2 x 20).  Therefore, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions in total to prepare both meals.
"Response:  First, we know that Tommy sells chocolate cupcakes for $3 each and cheesecake for $4 each.  If he sells 43 chocolate cupcakes, he will earn:  
43 x $3 = $130  And if he sells 23 cheesecakes, he will earn:  
23 x $4 = $92  So in total, Tommy can earn:  
$130 + $92 = $222"
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of each phone.  There are five phones, so the total cost is $150 x 5 = $750.  Next, we need to calculate the monthly interest for each phone.  Since the interest rate is 2%, we can multiply the total cost by 2/100 to get the monthly interest.  So, the monthly interest for each phone is $750 x 2/100 = $15.  Now, let's add up all the monthly interests for three months.  For three months, the total interest will be $15 x 3 = $45.  Finally, we need to add the total interest and the original price to find out how much Sheila needs to pay each month.  Therefore, Sheila needs to pay $750 + $45 = $895 per month for three months.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Artie will make from each type of flower.  For marigolds, he will make $2.74 x 12 = $33.08.  For petunias, he will make $1.87 x 9 = $16.83.  And for begonias, he will make $2.12 x 17 = $35.54.  Now, let's add up all these amounts to find out how much Artie will make in total: $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.54 = $85.45.  So, Artie will make $85.45 selling flowers today.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each level of the castle will have half the area of the level below it. So if the topmost level has an area of 16 square meters, then the next level down will have half that area, or 8 square meters.  But wait! We also know that there are four levels in total. So if the topmost level has an area of 16 square meters, and each subsequent level has half the area of the one above it, then the second level from the top will have an area of 8 square meters (half of 16), the third level from the top will have an area of 4 square meters (half of 8), and the bottom-most level will have an area of 2 square meters (half of 4).  Therefore, the average area of each level is:  (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5 square meters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cangkir of food per day for the first 180 days. Therefore, she will need 180 cangkirs of food for the first year. Since one bag contains 110 cangkirs, Cecilia will need 1.67 bags (180/110) of food for the first year.  However, since she also needs to feed her puppy 2 cangkirs per day for the remaining period of its life, let's calculate how many bags she will need for the entire lifetime of the puppy. The lifespan of a dog is approximately 15 years. So, if we multiply 15 x 365 (days in a year), we get 5,275 days. If we divide this number by 365 (days in a year), we get approximately 14.4 years. Therefore, Cecilia will need approximately 14.4 bags of food for the entire lifetime of her puppy.
Response:  First, we know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, David does 100 pounds (4 x 100 = 400).  Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry (half of 400).  Therefore, the difference between Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one bunch of flowers is either $2.50 or $1. Secondly, we want to buy 18 bunches of flowers. Now let's calculate how much it would cost us if we were to buy each bunch separately.  If we buy 3 bunches for $2.50 each, then:  3 x $2.50 = $7.50  If we buy 2 bunches for $1 each, then:  2 x $1 = $2  Since we want to spend as little money as possible, we should choose the option that costs less. In this case, it is better to buy 2 bunches for $1 each because it costs $2 in total, which is cheaper than buying 3 bunches for $2.50 each, which costs $7.50 in total. Therefore, the answer is $2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John adopted a dog and brought it to a groomer for $100. Next, we are told that there is a discount of 30%. So, if we calculate the original price without the discount, we get: Original Price = $100 x (1 + 0.3) = $100 x 1.3 = $130 Now, we can subtract the discount from the original price to find out the actual cost paid by John: Actual Cost = $130 - $39 = $91 Therefore, the biaya perawatan for John's dog is $91.
Response:  First, we know that each of the two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water, so together they received: 24 x (1/6) = 4 liters.  Now, we are told that one child received 6 liters of water, so the total amount of water received by all three is: 4 + 6 = 10 liters.  Finally, we want to find out how much water is left over after the three have drunk their share. To do this, we subtract the amount they received from the original 24 liters: 24 - 10 = 14 liters.  So there are 14 liters of water left over.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie has 10 stickers initially.  Secondly, she buys 21 stickers from the mall, so now she has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers in total.  Thirdly, she receives 23 stickers for her birthday, so now she has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers in total.  Fourthly, she gives 9 stickers to her younger brother, leaving her with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, she uses 28 stickers to decorate her greeting card, leaving her with 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.  Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left after using them all.
Response:  First, we know that Alex is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. So, if Grace weighs x pounds, then Alex weighs x - 2 pounds. Now, we are given that Grace weighs 125 pounds, so we can substitute this value into the equation for Alex's weight: x - 2 = 4x or x = 127. Therefore, Alex weighs 127 - 2 = 125 pounds.
Response:  First, we know that each shrub has 25 flowers, and each flower has 8 thorns. So, to find out how many thorns there are in total, we need to multiply the number of shrubs by the number of flowers per shrub and then by the number of thorns per flower.  Total thorns = Number of shrubs x Number of flowers per shrub x Number of thorns per flower  Total thorns = 3 x 25 x 8  Total thorns = 750  Therefore, there are 750 thorns in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the team played 22 matches and won 8 more than they lost. This means they won x matches and lost (22 - x) matches. Now, let's convert the information into an equation:  W + X = 22... (1) Where W is the number of wins and X is the number of losses. Since they won 8 more than they lost, we can write:  X = 22 - W... (2) Substituting (2) into (1), we get:  W + (22 - W) = 22 Solving for W, we have:  W = 14 Therefore, the team won 14 matches and lost 8 matches.
Response:  First, we know that Gene has been traveling for four times a year since she was 23 years old, so she has traveled for 11 years (23 x 4 = 88).  Second, each trip produces one quilt block, so she has collected 11 blocks in total (11 x 4 = 44).  Finally, each row of the quilt is made up of blocks from different trips, so there are 44 rows in total (44 x 4 = 176).  Therefore, Gene has a total of 176 quilt blocks.
Response:  First time, the alarm went off for 4 times. Second time, it was 3 times longer than the first time, so it was 4 x 3 = 12 times. Third time, it was half of the second time, so it was 12 / 2 = 6 times. Therefore, the total number of times the alarm went off is 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.
Response:  First, we know that Sylvie has been working for the company for 5 years as of December last year. Therefore, she will receive an increase of 10% from her current salary every year. Second, we do not know what her current salary is, but we can assume it to be $600 since that is the average monthly salary mentioned in the problem statement. Third, if she receives an annual increase of 10%, then after three years, her salary would have increased by 3 x 10% = 30%. So, her new salary after three years would be: $600 + (30% of $600) = $600 + $180 = $780.  There you go! That's how much Sylvie would earn annually after three years with the company.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harald. So if Marilyn sold x records, Harald sold 10x = 10x less than Marilyn. We also know that the total number of records sold by both artists is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these two facts:  
Marilyn sales + Harald sales = Total Sales (88,000)  
x + 10x = 88,000  
11x = 88,000  
x = 8,000  
So, Marilyn sold 8,000 records and Harald sold 8,000 x 10 = 80,000 records."
Response:  First, we know that there will be 16 guests attending the party, so we need to calculate how many gifts Christina needs to buy for them. Since one-quarter of the guests won't show up, we can assume that three guests won't attend (since 1/4 of 16 is 4). So, Christina needs to buy gifts for 13 guests. Next, we know that each gift costs $2, so she needs to spend $2 x 13 = $26 on gifts in total.
"Response:  First, we know that each adult will eat 10 pounds of salad and each child will eat half as much as an adult, so the total amount of salad needed for all adults is:  
10 pounds x 20 adults = 200 pounds  And the total amount of salad needed for all children is:  
5 children x (1/2) x 10 pounds/adult = 50 pounds  Therefore, in total, Ted needs to bring 250 pounds of salad to the picnic."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. So if Marcia has two pets, Jan will have three x two = six pets.  Secondly, we know that Marcia has more than Cindy. Therefore, if Cindy has four pets, Marcia must have at least five pets (since she has more than four).  Finally, since Jan has six pets and Marcia has five pets, their combined total is six + five = eleven pets.  So the correct answer is ELEVEN.
Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, if we let X be Jackson's age, then Amy's age would be X + 5.  We also know that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age would be 11 (10 + 1).  Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  Amy's age = X + 5  Corey's age = 11  James's age = 10  Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can substitute her age into the equation for Corey's age:  Corey's age = Amy's age - 5  Substituting Amy's age with X + 5, we get:  Corey's age = (X + 5) - 5  Simplifying, we have:  Corey's age = X + 1  Now, we know that James is 1 year younger than Corey, so we can subtract 1 from Corey's age to find James's age:  James's age = Corey's age - 1  Substituting Corey's age with X + 1, we get:  James's age = (X + 1) - 1  Simplifying, we have:  James's age = X  Therefore, we can solve for X to find Jackson's age:  Jackson's age = Amy's age - 5  Substituting Amy's age with X + 5, we get:  Jackson's age = (X + 5) - 5  Simplifying, we have:  Jackson's age = X + 1  So, Jackson's age is X + 1.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds with an additional two-second head start over Gerald. This means that if both of them were to race each other without any head start, Lee would still win but with a shorter margin. Now, let's consider how much faster Gerald is after changing his diet. We are given that he improved by 10%, which means his new time for 400 meters is 35 seconds (since he was previously running it in 38 seconds). So, if Gerald and Lee were to race each other now, Gerald would have a head start of 3 seconds (the difference between their original times). Therefore, Lee would need to catch up with Gerald within those three seconds to tie or beat him. In other words, Lee needs to cover 400 meters in 3 seconds less than Gerald takes to cover the same distance. To find out how fast Gerald is running, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  
Let x be Gerald's speed in meters per second (m/s)  Since Gerald has a head start of 3 seconds, Lee must catch up with him within that time. So, the total distance Lee needs to cover is:  
Total distance = Speed x Time + Head Start Distance Total distance = x x 3 + 3 = 3x + 3...(1) Now, we know that Lee covers 400 meters in 38 seconds, so his speed is:  
Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 400 / 38 = 10.5 m/s...(2) Substituting Equation (2) into Equation (1), we get:  
3x + 3 = 10.5 x 3 + 3 3x = 32.5 x + 9 3x = 42.5 x + 9 - 3x 42.5 x = 9 + 9 x 42.5 = 18.5 x x = 42.5 / 18.5 x = 2.27 m/s...(3) Finally, we can calculate Gerald's speed as follows:  
Gerald's"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 times as many cats as dogs. So for every dog, there are 2 cats.  Secondly, we know that the total number of pets is less than or equal to 12 (less than 12).  Finally, we know that there are 60 dogs.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  
Let C be the number of cats and D be the number of dogs. Since there are 2 times as many cats as dogs, we have:  
C = 2D  We also know that the total number of pets is less than or equal to 12, so:  
C + D <= 12  Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:  
2D + D <= 12  Combine like terms:  
3D <= 12  Divide both sides by 3:  
D <= 4  Now we know that there are at most 4 dogs. Since each dog has 2 cats, there are at most 8 cats.  So the total number of pets is at most:  
D + C = 4 + 8 = 12  Therefore, the answer is 12 pets in the neighborhood."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2/5 of the students who are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in Girl Scouts. So, to find out how many girls are not in Pramuka, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of girls. Total number of girls = (2/5) x 200 = 80 girls Number of boys = (2/5) x 200 = 40 boys Now, let's subtract the number of boys from the total number of girls: Number of girls not in Pramuka = 80 - 40 = 40 girls Therefore, there are 40 girls who are not in Pramuka.
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night and his friend James only slept for 2/3 of what Harry did. So we can start by finding out how many hours James slept. Since he slept for 2/3 of what Harry did, we can set up a proportion to represent this information:  
Harry slept for 9 hours (H) James slept for 2/3 of 9 hours (J)  
We can simplify this proportion by multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:  
3H = 6J Now we have enough information to find out how much more Harry slept than James. To do this, we need to subtract the amount of time James slept from the amount of time Harry slept:  
Harry slept for 9 hours (H) - James slept for 6 hours (J) =?  
Using our previous equation, we can substitute H for 9 and J for 6:  
9 - 6 =?  
This gives us the difference between the two amounts of sleep:  
9 - 6 = 3 Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. So if Freda lost half of her production, it means she had to throw away half of the tomatoes she used.  Secondly, we know that Freda produced 32 ounces (oz) of sauce in total. Since each can contain three tomatoes, and there are eight ounces in one can, Freda must have used four cans of tomatoes to produce 32 oz of sauce.  Now, let's calculate how many tomatoes Freda used in total. We know that each can contains three tomatoes, so Freda used four cans x three tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes in total.  Therefore, the answer is 12 tomatoes.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 30 cars initially on the road and 5 cars from the exit lane did not have to go through the traffic jam. So, the number of cars passing through the traffic jam is:  
30 - 5 = 25 cars.  Next, we are told that 20 more cars passed through the traffic jam in the next 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of cars passing through the traffic jam is:  
25 + 20 = 45 cars.  Finally, we need to find out how many cars were stuck in the traffic jam for 15 minutes. To do this, we subtract the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam (45) from the initial number of cars (30):  
30 - 45 = -5 cars. This means that 5 cars were stuck in the traffic jam for 15 minutes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has 18 new plants and she wants to give one plant per rock (tebing) to her friends and family tomorrow. So, if we divide 18 by 1 (one plant per rock), we get 18. Therefore, Mary will have 18 plants left after giving one plant per rock to her friends and family.
Response:  First, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. So, if Jerome had not opened the door, the first friend would have pressed the doorbell 20 times.  Next, we know that the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, so they would have pressed the doorbell 5 times (20 x 1/4).  The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so they would have pressed the doorbell 70 times (60 + 10).  Therefore, in total, there were 20 + 5 + 70 = 95 presses of the doorbell.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Solo has to read 4 halaman from the textbook of Science, which means she needs to read 4 x 3 = 12 pages per day.  Secondly, she needs to read 20 halaman from the textbook of Social Studies, which means she needs to read 20 x 3 = 60 pages per day. Thirdly, she needs to read 7 halaman from the textbook of History, which means she needs to read 7 x 3 = 21 pages per day. Lastly, she needs to read 8 halaman from the textbook of Geography, which means she needs to read 8 x 3 = 24 pages per day.  To find out how many pages she needs to read in one day, we need to add up all these numbers: 12 + 60 + 21 + 24 = 127 pages. So, Solo needs to read approximately 127 pages per day to complete her reading within 4 days.
"Response:  We know that John drinks water with his breakfast (3 glasses), lunch (2 glasses), and dinner (4 glasses). So far, we have:  
Glasses of water consumed per day = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 glasses/day Glasses of water consumed per week = 9 x 7 = 63 glasses/week Now, let's consider John's weekend behavior. He likes to relax and drink soda with his evening meals. Since he does this every weekend day (Saturday and Sunday), we can estimate that he consumes an additional:  
Glasses of soda consumed per weekend day = 2 glasses/day (assuming one soda with each meal) Glasses of soda consumed per weekend = 2 x 2 = 4 glasses/weekend Total number of glasses of water consumed per week = 63 + 4 = 67 glasses/week Therefore, John consumes approximately 67 glasses of water per week."
Response:  Firstly, we know that it takes 10 minutes to travel each 3 miles (since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 5 miles = 3 x 5 = 15 miles). So if we want to cover the entire city of 42 miles, we need to divide 42 miles by 3 miles per 10 minutes: 42 / 3 = 14 rounds or trips. Since each trip takes 10 minutes, therefore the total time required for all 14 trips is: 14 x 10 = 140 minutes or 2 hours and 20 minutes.  Therefore, the bank would take approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes to cover the entire city.
Response:  First, Poppy placed 250 pieces (1/4) of the puzzle on the board. Then her mother placed 375 pieces (1/3) of the remaining puzzle pieces on the board. To find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we need to subtract the number of pieces that Poppy and her mother have placed from the total number of pieces in the puzzle. Total number of pieces = 1000 Number of pieces placed by Poppy = 250 Number of pieces placed by her mother = 375 Subtracting the two numbers gives us: Total number of pieces - (Poppy + Mother) = 1000 - (250 + 375) = 1000 - 625 = 375 So there are 375 pieces left to be placed.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Cody eats three times more than Amir. So if Amir eats 5 cupcakes, Cody will eat 3 x 5 = 15 cupcakes. Therefore, together they will eat 5 + 15 = 20 cupcakes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out the volume of each box.  The formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism is L x W x H, where L is length, W is width, and H is height.  For the first box with dimensions 5 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches high, its volume can be calculated as follows: Volume = 5 x 6 x 4 = 240 cubic inches.  Similarly, for the second box with dimensions 6 inches long, 8 inches wide, and 4 inches high, its volume can be calculated as follows: Volume = 6 x 8 x 4 = 320 cubic inches.  And for the third box with dimensions 4 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 5 inches high, its volume can be calculated as follows: Volume = 4 x 6 x 5 = 120 cubic inches.  Now that we have found the volumes of all three boxes, we need to add them up to get the total volume. Total volume = 240 + 320 + 120 = 680 cubic inches.  So the total volume inside all three boxes is 680 cubic inches.
Response:  First, we know that Frankie watches TV for 7 hours (7 x 60 = 420 minutes) each day. On Monday and Tuesday, she watches one hour of her favorite show every night (1 x 60 = 60 minutes). On Wednesday, she watches several episodes of a 30-minute show (let's assume she watches 3 episodes, since there are 3 x 30 = 90 minutes in total). On Thursday, she finishes her work earlier and watches one hour of her favorite show plus some 30-minute shows (let's assume she watches two 30-minute shows, so 2 x 30 = 60 minutes in total). Finally, on Friday, she has to stay up late to finish her work for the week, so she watches two hours of her favorite show (2 x 60 = 120 minutes). Now let's calculate how many episodes of the 30-minute show she watches on Wednesday: We know that she watches 7 hours of TV per day, and 60% of that time is spent watching her favorite show (7 x 0.6 = 4.2 hours), leaving only 28 minutes for other shows (4.2 x 0.4 = 17.6 minutes). Since she watches three episodes of the 30-minute show, each episode lasts approximately 17.6 / 3 = 5.8 minutes. Therefore, if Frankie watches 7 hours of TV on Wednesday, she will watch approximately 7 x 0.58 = 3.9 episodes of the 30-minute show.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Henry made 2 times more kue than last year. So if he made x kue last year, this year he will make 2x kue.  Secondly, we know that Henry sold 15 more kue than expected. So if he was supposed to sell x kue, he actually sold x + 15 kue.  Finally, we know that Henry had 110 kue left after selling some of them. So if he sold x + 15 kue, he must have had (2x + 15) - (x + 15) = 2x - x + 15 = 15 more kue left.  Therefore, we can set up an equation:  2x - x + 15 = 15  Simplifying the equation:  3x = 45  Dividing both sides by 3:  x = 15  So, Henry made 15 kue last year.
Response:  First, we know that the local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon. Second, the application company offers $20 cashback per gallon if you fill up at this station. So, if someone buys 10 gallons of gas, they will receive $20 x 10 = $200 cashback. Now, let's calculate how much gas they will actually pay after the cashback. They paid $3.00 per gallon x 10 gallons = $30.00 for the gas. However, they received $200 cashback, so their net cost is $30.00 - $200 = -$170.00. That means they made a profit of $170.00 from filling up their tank!
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many pieces of fruit each person has in total.  For Beatrice, she has 2 roll-ups x 12 pieces per roll-up = 24 pieces of fruit.  For Marcel, he has 3 roll-ups x 8 pieces per roll-up = 24 pieces of fruit.  Now that we have the total number of pieces for both people, let's divide it by the number of people to get the average number of pieces per person.  (24 + 24) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24 pieces of fruit per person on average.
Response:  First, we know that Julia's boat takes 16 seconds to travel 20 feet (since she is rowing at a rate of 2 feet per second). So, if she rows for x seconds, her boat will travel 2x feet.  Now, we are given that the distance between the boat and the shore is 64 seconds away. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  2x = 64 + 20 Since we know that 2x represents the total distance traveled by the boat in feet, we can substitute 2x with 2(20) = 40 feet.  Substituting this into our previous equation gives us:  40 = 64 + 20 Solving for x, we get:  x = 24 seconds  Since Julia rows for 24 seconds before reaching the shore, her boat must have traveled 24 x 2 = 48 feet during that time.  To find out how much water Julia's boat has taken in, we need to subtract the amount of water displaced by the boat from the initial volume of water in the lake. We know that the boat displaces water at a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet traveled. Therefore, if Julia's boat traveled 48 feet, it would displace 48/10 = 4.8 liters of water.  However, since Julia only needs to row back to the shore, we can assume that her boat did not start at the shore but rather at some point closer to the center of the lake. This means that Julia's boat had already displaced some water before she started rowing. To account for this, we can add the volume of water displaced by the boat while it was stationary to the total volume of water displaced while Julia was rowing.  The volume of water displaced by the boat while it was stationary is equal to the volume of the boat itself, which we can estimate as roughly cylindrical in shape with a length of 10 feet, a width of 3 feet, and a height of 2 feet. Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, we get:  V = πr^2h where r is the radius of
Response:  There are 4 gurus and each guru teaches 2 classes per day. That means there will be 8 classes in total per day (4 gurus x 2 classes per guru). If the blackboard is cleaned 3 times per class, then it will be cleaned 8 x 3 = 24 times per day.
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers per day and 5 do not grow, then he has 2 + 0 = 2 flowers that grow every day. After 15 days, he will have 2 x 15 = 30 flowers in total.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the maximum number of photos that can be stored in Brittany's phone is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photo about the bebek di kebun binatang. So if there are x birds in Jamal's photo, then there will be 50x photos in Brittany's phone.  Secondly, we know that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:  
50x = 1800  Now solve for x.  x = 36  So there are 36 birds in Jamal's photo about the bebek di kebun binatang."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all the lumber that Sasha has.  The cost per piece for the 2x4x10 boards is $10 each, so the total cost of 10 pieces is:  
$10 x 10 = $100  For the 4x4x10 boards, the cost per piece is $16 each, so the total cost of 5 pieces is:  
$16 x 5 = $80  Therefore, the total cost of all the lumber that Sasha has is:  
$100 + $80 = $180  Now, let's find out how much profit Sasha can make if she sells everything. If she sells all the 2x4x10 boards at $10 each, she will make:  
$10 x 10 = $100  And if she sells all the 4x4x10 boards at $16 each, she will make:  
$16 x 5 = $80  So, in total, Sasha can make:  
$100 + $80 = $180  This means that Sasha can make a profit of $180 if she sells all her lumber."
Response:  We know that the ratio of coffee to water is 7:13, so if we have 120 sendok teh gula (which is equal to 120/7 = 17 cups of coffee), then we need 17 x 13 = 221 cups of water.  Since we are using a secangkir (which is equal to 1 cup), we will use 221 / 1 = 221 cups of water.  Therefore, Katy used 221 cups of water to make 17 cups of coffee.
Response:  First, we know that John bought two pairs of shoes for each of his three children. So he bought a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes.  Next, we know that each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total amount John paid is 6 x $60 = $360.
Response:  First, we know that there were 2 containers imported on the first day, each containing 5 cars. So, the total number of cars imported on the first day is 2 x 5 = 10 cars.  On the second day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of cars at the port became 30. Since all containers contain 5 cars each, we can calculate the number of containers brought in on the second day as follows:  30 - 10 = 20 cars  To find out how many containers were brought in on the second day, we divide the number of cars by the number of cars per container:  20 / 5 = 4 containers  Therefore, on the second day, 4 containers were brought into the port, each containing 5 cars.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he earned four years ago. So if he earned $40,000 four years ago, his current salary would be:  
$40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000 Now, let's find out how much Lylah earns. We know that her salary is 30% less than Adrien's current salary. So:  
$56,000 x 0.7 = $39,200 Therefore, Lylah's current salary is $39,200. Total gaji yang mereka terima empat tahun kemudian adalah:  
Adrien: $56,000 Lylah: $39,200"
Response:  If Miguel uses two sheets of paper per week and there are 30 sheets of paper in one sheet, then he uses 60 sheets of paper per month (2 x 30).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, she had 5 + 8 = 13 fruits in total.  Next, we know that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette and half as many oranges. So, he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples and (1/2) x 8 = 4 oranges. In total, Kael had 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.  Therefore, together they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.
"Response:  First, we know that Sadie sleeps for 8 hours on Monday. So her daily sleep time is 8 hours.  For Tuesday and Wednesday, she sleeps for 2 hours less each day, so her daily sleep time is:  
Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours of sleep  
Wednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours of sleep  Now, let's calculate her total sleep time for the week:  
Monday: 8 hours  
Tuesday: 6 hours  
Wednesday: 6 hours  
Total sleep time for the week: 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours"
Response:  First, we know that Rosie can run 10 miles in 3 hours, so her speed is 10/3 = 3.33 miles per hour.  Next, we know that she runs for 5 miles at a slower pace of 5/2 = 2.5 miles per hour. Finally, we want to find out how far Rosie can run in 7 hours. We can use our first formula to calculate her distance traveled in 3 hours and then add that to the distance she travels at a slower pace: Distance = Speed x Time + (Distance x Speed) / (Speed + Distance). Plugging in the values we get: Distance = 3.33 x 3 + (2.5 x 5) / (3.33 + 5) Distance = 9.99 + (12.5 / 8.33) Distance = 9.99 + 1.5 Distance = 11.49 miles So, Rosie can run 11.49 miles in 7 hours.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 60 letters in total and Jennie has placed postage on one-third of them. So, if there are currently 30 letters in the stack that have been stamped, then the number of letters that were not stamped is:  
60 - 30 = 30  Therefore, there are 30 letters in the stack when Jennie started."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia bought one packet of new spoons. This means she had 5 spoons in total (since her husband also gave her 5 new spoons).  Next, we know that Julia used three spoons to taste the stew. So, after she finished tasting, she had 5 - 3 = 2 spoons left. Finally, when she went to arrange the table, she had 2 + 12 = 14 spoons in total. Therefore, the number of spoons in Julia's packet is 14.
"Response:  We know that Dylan bought more chicken sausages than fish sausages. So, if he bought x chicken sausages, he must have bought at least 6 fish sausages (since there are only 6 fish sausages in total). Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x + 6 = 38  Solving for x, we get:  x = 32  Therefore, Dylan bought 32 chicken sausages and 6 fish sausages."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Amy has 20 more friends than before she moved to her new school. So, if she had x friends before moving, then she has x + 20 friends now. Secondly, we are given that Lily has 50 friends. Therefore, the total number of friends that Lily and Amy have together is: x + (x + 20) = 3x + 20. Since there are 3 girls in total, the sum of their friends must be equal to 3 times the number of friends each girl has, so we can set up the equation as follows: 3(x + 20) = 3x + 60. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 40 = 60. Solving for x, we get: x = 20. Therefore, Amy had 20 friends before moving to her new school, and Lily has 50 friends. Together, they have 70 friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each semangka costs three times as much as one lada. So if one lada costs $15, then one semangka will cost $15 x 3 = $45. Since Dillon wants to buy four semangka, he will have to pay $45 x 4 = $180 for them. Next, we know that two paprika cost less than one semangka by $5. Therefore, two paprika will cost $45 - $5 = $40. As Dillon wants to buy twenty paprika, he will have to pay $40 x 20 = $800 for them. Finally, we know that ten jeruk cost less than one semangka by $10. Therefore, ten jeruk will cost $45 - $10 = $35. So Dillon will have to pay $35 x 10 = $350 for the jeruk. In total, Dillon will spend $180 + $800 + $350 = $1,330 on his purchases.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 500 patients and each patient is examined for an average of 24 minutes. So, the total number of minutes all patients spend at the clinic = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the clinic from these visits. We know that the doctor charges $150 per hour and the clinic charges $200 per hour. So, the total revenue generated by the clinic = (12,000 minutes / 60) x ($150 + $200) = 200,000 x ($350) = $70,000. Therefore, the profit made by the clinic from these visits is $70,000 - $200,000 = -$130,000. This means that the clinic incurs a loss of $130,000 from these visits.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 60 elves were hired to work at Nissa's department store during Christmas season. Secondly, one-third of the elves quit their jobs after children vomited on them. This means that if there are x elves who quit, then 60/3 = x. Simplifying this equation, we get x = 20. So, 20 elves quit their jobs. Now, let's find out how many elves are left. We know that 10 elves were left after children started kicking them. Therefore, the number of elves left can be found by subtracting 10 from 20: 20 - 10 = 10. So, there are 10 elves left working at Nissa's department store.
Response:  First, we know that in May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than in May. So, if we subtract $60 from $500, we get: Total expenditure for two months = $500 - $60 = $440.
Response:  First, they rode the roller coaster.  Pam rode twice and Fred rode four times, so together they used 2 + 4 = 6 tickets for the roller coaster. Next, they rode the loge twice each, so they used 2 x 2 = 4 more tickets. In total, they used 6 + 4 = 10 tickets that day.
Response:  First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. Next, we know that he walked 6 times more on Tuesday than he did on Monday. So if he walked x miles on Monday, then he walked 6x miles on Tuesday. Finally, we know that the total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  4 + 6x = 41  Simplifying the equation:  10x = 37  Dividing both sides by 10:  x = 3.7  So Walt walked 3.7 miles on Wednesday.
Response:  If Tom gets his car washed four times a month and each wash costs $15, how much will he pay in a year?  To find out, we need to multiply the number of times he gets his car washed per month (4) by the cost of each wash ($15):  Monthly cost = 4 x $15 = $60  Yearly cost = $60 x 12 = $720
Response:  If Brian has 20 games and loses 5 exactly before the comparison is made, then he has 15 games left (20 - 5 = 15). Since Bobby has less than 3 times as many games as Brian, Bobby must have at least 15 x 3 = 45 games. Therefore, Bobby has 45 games.
"Response:  We know that two-thirds of the unicorns in Scotland are female. So if we have x female unicorns in Scotland, then we have 2x + 3 = 27 unicorns in total (since two-thirds of the unicorns in Scotland are female). Simplifying this equation, we get:  
2x + 3 = 27  
2x = 18  
x = 9  
So there are 9 female unicorns in Scotland."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items without shipping. Total Cost = (2 x $7.50) + (2 x $1.50) + (2 x $1.00) = $19.50 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $24.50 Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. According to the problem, there is a 20% service charge on top of the total cost. Shipping Cost = $24.50 x 20% = $4.90 So, the total cost with shipping would be: Total Cost with Shipping = Total Cost + Shipping Cost = $24.50 + $4.90 = $29.40 Finally, Rory wants to add a tip of $5.00, so the final cost would be: Final Cost = Total Cost with Shipping + Tip = $29.40 + $5.00 = $34.40
Response:  First, we know that Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions, so he spent 8/75 = 0.11 (or 11%) of his time on each question.  For the second test with 100 questions, he has 6 hours to spend, so he will spend 6/100 = 0.06 (or 6%) of his time on each question.  Now, let's calculate how many questions Mark can solve in each hour:  For the first test: 0.11 x 75 = 8.25 questions per hour  For the second test: 0.06 x 100 = 6 questions per hour  To find out how many questions Mark left unsolved, we need to subtract the number of questions he solved from the total number of questions in each test:  For the first test: 75 - 8.25 = 66.75 questions left unsolved  For the second test: 100 - 6 = 94 questions left unsolved  So, Mark left 66.75 questions unsolved for the first test and 94 questions unsolved for the second test.
Response:  We know that there are 22 more than four times as many red balls as blue balls. This means that if we have x blue balls, we will have 4x + 22 red balls.  Since there are 12 blue balls, we can substitute this value into our equation:  4(12) + 22 =?  Doing the calculation, we get:  48 + 22 = 70  So, there are 70 red balls in total.
Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for rent, and we have been given information about their transmission types.  Firstly, let's calculate the number of automatic cars: 12 x 100 = 1200 Now, let's calculate the number of manual cars: 4 x 100 = 400 Next, let's calculate the number of semi-automatic cars: 20 - (1200 + 400) = 20 - 1600 = 400 So, there are 400 semi-automatic cars, which is approximately 20% of the total number of cars available for rent.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 700 bees in total. Secondly, we know that twice as many worker bees as baby bees means that the number of worker bees is 2 x (700 - 350) = 2 x 350 = 700. Finally, since there are two times more worker bees than baby bees, the number of baby bees is half of the number of worker bees, i.e., 700 / 2 = 350. Therefore, there are 700 bees in total, consisting of 350 worker bees and 350 baby bees.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day. That means he spends 14 hours (2 x 7) playing video games in one week.  Secondly, we know that he earns $10 per hour working part-time. So, if he works for 14 hours, he will earn $140 (14 x $10).  Therefore, Jordan can earn $140 in one week from playing video games.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all items without tax. Total Cost = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15 Next, we need to calculate the tax amount based on the total cost. Tax Amount = $15 x 10% = $1.50 Now, let's add the tax amount to the total cost to get the final price. Final Price = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50 So, the final price of all items including tax is $16.50.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total income for each client based on the number of bottles and packaging materials they will use.  For example, if Client A uses 2 bottles and 1 package of cleaning supplies, their total income would be:  
$2 x 2 = $4 (for 2 bottles) + $5 (for 1 package) = $9 Total income for Client A is $9.  Similarly, for Client B, their total income would be:  
$2 x 3 = $6 (for 3 bottles) + $5 (for 1 package) = $11 Total income for Client B is $11.  Now let's add up all the total incomes for all clients:  Total income for Client A = $9 Total income for Client B = $11 Total income for Client C = $... (we don't know this yet) Total income for Client D = $... (we don't know this yet) Total income for Client E = $... (we don't know this yet) Total income for Client F = $...

Response:  First, we know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple fields and each hectare contains 100 pineapples. So, in total, John has 10 x 100 = 1000 pineapples per hectare. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (since there are 3 months in a season). Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in one year is 1000 x 4 = 4000 pineapples per year.
Response:  First, we know that Johnny has three boxes of Lego: one with 500 pieces, one with 3 times as many pieces as the first box (so 3 x 500 = 1500), and one with 1/4 of the number of pieces in the first box (so 1/4 x 500 = 125).  To find out how many pieces Johnny took in total, we need to add up the number of pieces in all three boxes: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2225.  So Johnny took 2225 pieces of Lego in total.
"Response:  First, we know that there were 30 bees leaving the nest in the first 6 hours. So, if half of them returned within the next 6 hours (as stated), then half of 30 is 15. Therefore, 15 bees returned to the nest within the second 6-hour period.  Now, let's look at the third 6-hour period. We know that two times as many bees left the nest during this period as left during the first period (since ""two kali lebih banyak"" means twice as many). So, if 30 bees left during the first period, then 2 x 30 = 60 bees left during the third period.  However, since each bee that left before the third period had not yet returned, we need to subtract the number of bees that left during the first and second periods from the total number of bees that left during the third period. In other words, we need to subtract 30 + 15 = 45 bees from 60.  Therefore, the number of bees that returned to the nest during the third period is:  
60 - 45 = 15.  So, in total, 15 + 15 = 30 bees returned to the nest during the three 6-hour periods."
Response:  First, we know that the total cost of the tickets is $12 + $10 = $22.  If Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8, then she must have given her $22 - $8 = $14.  Therefore, Brittany's mother gave the cashier $14 in cash.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy, so if Charlie has 12 friends, then Dorothy has 12 x 3 = 36 friends.  Now we are told that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy, so James has 36 x 4 = 144 friends.
Response:  First, we need to find out how long it takes for each of them to get home from school.  For Steve, we know that he lives 3 miles away and can bike at 440 feet per minute. So, we can calculate his time as follows: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 3 miles / 440 ft/min Time = 7.5 minutes Now, let's do the same for Tim. We know that he lives 2 miles away and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. So, we can calculate his time as follows: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 2 miles / 264 ft/min Time = 4.6 minutes Since Steve is biking faster than Tim, Steve will arrive home before Tim. To find out exactly how much longer Steve will wait for Tim, we can subtract their times: Waiting time = Time (Steve) - Time (Tim) Waiting time = 7.5 min - 4.6 min Waiting time = 2.9 minutes Therefore, Steve will wait for Tim for approximately 2.9 minutes before finishing the race.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each ban costs 25 cents and there were 5 people who came to buy two bans each, so they paid 25 cents x 2 = $1 for each person. Therefore, the total amount earned from these 5 customers is $1 x 5 = $5. Next, 3 people came to buy all the bans they needed, so they paid $25 cents x 4 = $1 for each person. So, the total amount earned from these 3 customers is $1 x 3 = $3. Finally, one customer came with a single-wheeled bicycle and paid $25 cents for it. Therefore, the total amount earned on the first day is $5 + $3 + $0.25 = $8.25.
Response:  First, we know that each package of cupcakes has six cupcakes in it, and each cupcake costs $0.10. So if Carl buys ten packages of cupcakes, he will pay for 6 x 10 = 60 cupcakes. Since each cupcake costs $0.10, Carl will pay 60 x $0.10 = $6.00.  Therefore, the amount of money Carl receives is $10 - $6.00 = $4.00.
Response:  First, Dave eats 12 pieces of fried chicken before a seagull steals the package from him. So there are 12 - 6 = 6 pieces of fried chicken left in the package.  Next, three crows take turns eating three pieces each, so they eat a total of 3 x 3 = 9 pieces of fried chicken. That leaves 6 - 9 = 7 pieces of fried chicken remaining.  Then, a raccoon takes two thirds (2/3) of what is left, which is 7 x 2/3 = 4 pieces of fried chicken. Finally, an ant carries away the last piece, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 pieces of fried chicken behind. Therefore, there were originally 12 pieces of fried chicken in the package when Dave bought it.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 weeks in one semester and each week has 5 days (Monday to Friday). Therefore, the total number of days in one semester is:  
16 weeks x 5 days/week = 80 days  
Next, we need to calculate how many hours Kimo spends attending classes per day. We know that he has three 1-hour classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so his daily class time is:  
3 x 1 hour = 3 hours/day  
On Tuesday and Thursday, he has two 2-hour classes, so his daily class time is:  
2 x 2 hours = 4 hours/day  
Now, let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes per semester:  
Total hours/semester = Total days x Class hours/day  
= 80 days x 3 hours/day + 80 days x 4 hours/day  
= 240 hours + 320 hours  
= 560 hours  
Therefore, Kimo spends 560 hours attending classes per semester."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many items are there in total.  There are 300 rotis, 120 croissants, and 60 baguettes. So, the total number of items is:  Total Items = 300 + 120 + 60 = 580 items. Next, we need to calculate the length of each item. For rotis, it's 4 inches per piece. For croissants, it's 6 inches per piece. And for baguettes, it's 2 feet long (since each baguette is made up of two pieces). So, the total length of all items is:  Total Length = 580 x 4 inches/piece (for rotis) + 580 x 6 inches/piece (for croissants) + 580 x 2 feet/piece (for baguettes) = 2320 inches + 3480 inches + 1000 feet = 7800 inches or approximately 650 feet. Now, let's convert this into minutes. There are 60 seconds in one minute, so:  Minutes = 7800 inches / 60 seconds/minute = approximately 130 minutes or 2.17 hours. Therefore, if Bill places all the baked goods at the end of the counter, they will be ready in approximately 2 hours and 17 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three types of animals in the zoo - monkeys, gorillas, and baboons. Secondly, each animal has a different number of bananas they need per month. Thirdly, the caretaker orders bananas from a local farm every two months. So, to calculate how many bananas the caretaker needs to order for each type of animal, we can use multiplication. Here is the calculation: Monkeys: 200 bananas x 2 months = 400 bananas Gorillas: 400 bananas x 2 months = 800 bananas Baboons: 100 bananas x 2 months = 200 bananas Therefore, the total number of bananas the caretaker needs to order for all three types of animals for two months is: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Blake ran back and forth for 15 times, so he covered a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.  Secondly, we know that Kelly ran once to the 40-yard line and then back, so she covered a distance of 80 yards (40 + 40). Thirdly, we know that Kelly did this 34 times, so she covered a total distance of 34 x 80 = 2720 yards. Finally, we want to find out how much farther the winner is ahead of the loser. To do this, we subtract the distance covered by Kelly from the distance covered by Blake: 1500 - 2720 = -1220 yards or -1220 feet. So, the winner (Blake) is 1220 yards or 1220 feet ahead of the loser (Kelly).
Response:  First, we know that Raphael bought 4 pens and each pen costs $1.5, so he spent $1.5 x 4 = $6 on pens. Next, he bought two notebooks and each notebook costs $4, so he spent $4 x 2 = $8 on notebooks. Finally, he bought one ream of paper which costs $20. So in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  First, we know that 11 frogs were swimming in the pond.  Next, we know that 6 of them hid under the lily pads, so there are 11 - 6 = 5 frogs left.  Then, we know that 2 of those remaining frogs hid under the rocks, so there are 5 - 2 = 3 frogs left.  Therefore, there are 3 tadpoles left in the pond that Finn can see.
Response:  First, we know that the depth of water in the tank on Monday was 17 feet.  On Tuesday, there were 7 more feet of water, so the total depth would be:  17 + 7 = 24 feet  Now, on Wednesday, two-thirds of the amount of water on Tuesday is added to the tank. So, if there were 24 feet of water on Tuesday, then two-thirds of that is:  24 x (2/3) = 24 x 0.67 = 15.88 feet  Therefore, the depth of water in the tank on Wednesday is approximately 15.88 feet.
Response:  First, we know that Anakin caught 10 bintang laut + 6 kuda laut + 3 ikan badut = 29 fish.  Second, we know that Locsin caught fewer than Anakin, so she caught less than 29 fish.  Third, we know that Locsin caught 5 bintang laut fewer than Anakin, which means she caught 5 x 2 = 10 bintang laut.  Fourth, we know that Locsin caught 3 kuda laut fewer than Anakin, which means she caught 3 x 2 = 6 kuda laut.  Fifth, we know that Locsin caught 2 ikan badut more than Anakin, which means she caught 2 x 2 = 4 ikan badut.  Therefore, Locsin caught a total of 10 + 6 + 4 = 20 fish.
Response:  First, we know that the price of one block of marble increases by 20% every two months. So if the initial price is $20, then after two months, the price will be: $20 x 1.2 = $24 Second, we need to find out how much the price will be after 36 months (which is equal to 3 years). We can do this by multiplying the price after two months by 36/2: $24 x 36/2 = $96 Therefore, the price of one block of marble after 36 months will be $96.
Response:  We know that one action figure costs $5 and one toy car costs $4.  So if we want to find out how much all of these toys cost in total, we need to multiply the number of each type of toy by its price.  First, let's calculate the cost of all the action figures:  5 x $5 = $25  Next, let's calculate the cost of all the toy cars:  1 x $4 = $4  Finally, let's add up the cost of all three types of toys:  $25 + $4 + $3 (boneka) = $32  Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $32.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time Jackie will save if she outsources her tax preparation work to an accountant. We know that she can save 3 hours of work per week, and each hour costs her $35 in lost income. So, the total amount she can save is:  
Time saved = 3 hours/week x 4 weeks (in a month) x $35/hour = $640/month  Next, we need to subtract the cost of hiring an accountant from the amount she saves. The accountant charges $90 per month. So, the net savings for Jackie would be:  
Net savings = $640/month - $90/month = $550/month  Therefore, if Jackie decides to outsource her tax preparation work to an accountant, she will have an additional $550 per month to spend on other things or invest."
Response:  First, we know that Elvira has an allowance of €1500 and she spent €1090 for the computer + accessories = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323. So, how much money is left for clothes? We can subtract the total amount spent from her allowance: €1500 - €1323 = €177. Therefore, Elvira has €177 left for buying clothes.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan. Secondly, she needs 15 flans for her school fundraiser. Therefore, we can calculate how many eggs she needs in total as follows:  
Total number of eggs needed = Number of flans x Number of eggs per flan  
= 15 x 3  
= 45 eggs So, Sandra needs to collect 45 eggs from her neighbors to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brooke is 25 years old now and in 2 years she will be 27 years old. So, if Brooke is currently 25 years old, Seth must be 2 years older than her, which means he is currently 27 years old. Therefore, Seth's current age is 27 years old.
Response:  If Ethel has $8, then she has 8 dollars.  Now, we know that Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel, so Jimmy has $8 + 2 = 10 dollars.  Therefore, Jimmy has $10.
Response:  We know that Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day, except for the weekends when he only walks 10 miles (which is equivalent to 16 kilometers). To find out how far Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks during the weekdays and add it up. There are 7 days in a week, so let's multiply 30 kilometers per day by 7 days:  30 km/day x 7 days = 210 km   Now, let's subtract the distance he walks on weekends:  210 km - 16 km (on weekends) = 194 km So, Pancho walks approximately 194 kilometers in a week.
Response:  First, we know that each uniform consists of a hat ($25), jacket (3 times the cost of the hat), and pants (on average, the cost of the hat and jacket). So, the total cost of each uniform is:  Total Cost = Hat + Jacket + Pants Total Cost = $25 + 3 x $25 + (average of $25 and $25) Total Cost = $25 + $75 + $25 Total Cost = $125 Therefore, the total cost of each seragam is $125.
Response:  First, we know that Jake saw 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so he saw 80 x 8 = 640 legs from the spiders alone. Next, we know that he saw 90 insects with 6 legs each, so he saw 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. Finally, we know that he saw 3 freakish invertebrates with 10 legs each, so he saw 3 x 10 = 30 legs from these creatures. Therefore, the total number of legs that Jake saw is 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.
Response:  We know that Sally 4 is 3 years older than Sally 32 and Sally 32 is 8 years old. So, we can start with Sally 32's age first.  Sally 32 = 8 years old Now, let's find out how old Sally 4 is based on her relationship to Sally 32.  Sally 4 = 3 years older than Sally 32 = (8 + 3) = 11 years old Therefore, the total age of all four birds is:  Nenek Merah = 11 + 3 = 14 years old Nenek Red = 2 x 14 = 28 years old Sally 32 = 8 years old Sally 4 = 11 years old Total age of all four birds = 14 + 28 + 8 + 11 = 61 years old
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jessica needs to pay for each debt per month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment.  For her student loan, the minimum payment is $300/month, so if she pays 50% more, she will pay $450/month ($300 x 1.5).  For her credit card, the minimum payment is $200/month, so if she pays 50% more, she will pay $300/month ($200 x 1.5).  And for her mortgage, the minimum payment is $500/month, so if she pays 50% more, she will pay $750/month ($500 x 1.5).  Now let's add up all these amounts to find out how much Jessica will pay in one year:  Student loan: $450 x 12 = $5,400  Credit card: $300 x 12 = $3,600  Mortgage: $750 x 12 = $9,000  Total amount paid in one year: $5,400 + $3,600 + $9,000 = $18,000
"Response:  First, Billy needs to peel the potatoes (1 setengah menit per potato). Then he needs to cut them into wedges (5 detik per potato). So, in total, it will take him:  
1 setengah menit x 60 potatoes = 30 setengah menit to peel all the potatoes  
30 setengah menit + 5 detik x 60 potatoes = 210 detik to cut all the potatoes  
Therefore, Billy will need approximately 240 minutes (or 4 hours) to prepare the potatoes for the big family reunion barbecue."
"Response:  First, we know that they spend $3 for every gallon of lemonade to make it ($3 x 1gal = $3). And then they sell each glass for $0.50, so if they sell 20 glasses per gallon (20 x $0.50 = $10), their total revenue from selling lemonade is $10 per gallon.  Now, let's find out how much money they have left after deducting the cost of making lemonade from their total revenue.  They have $10 in revenue - $3 in cost = $7 per gallon left over.  Since they sold 25 gallons in total and made $7 per gallon, their total profit would be:  
$7 x 25 = $175  So, they spent $25 on lemons."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 240 people in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese is 240 - 80 = 160.  Next, we know that there are 60 boys in the Chinese team. Therefore, the number of girls in the Chinese team is 160 - 60 = 100.
Response:  First, we know that Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 6000 x 1/4 = 1500$. Next, he spends 1/3 of his remaining amount on fuel for his car, which is 1500 x 1/3 = 500$. Then, he donates half of what's left to charity, which is 500 x 1/2 = 250$. Finally, he gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so the total amount spent on family expenses is 200 + 700 = 900$. Therefore, the amount left over after all expenses and donations is 6000 - 900 = 5100$.
Response:  First, we know that Rani has 10 chickens more than Monic. So, if Monic has x chickens, then Rani has x + 10 chickens.  Next, we know that Bo has 40 chickens.  Therefore, the total number of chickens owned by the three farmers is:  Monic: x  Rani: x + 10  Bo: 40  To find the total number of chickens, we need to add up all these numbers:  Total = x + (x + 10) + 40  Simplifying this expression, we get:  Total = 2x + 50  Now solve for x by subtracting 50 from both sides:  x = 2(25) - 50  x = 50  Therefore, the total number of chickens owned by the three farmers is:  Total = 2x + 50 = 2(50) + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150
"Response:  First, we know that Lloyd earns $10 per hour teaching mathematics.  For the first week, he teaches for 5 hours, so his total earnings for the first week are:  
$10 x 5 = $50  For the second week, he teaches for 8 hours, so his total earnings for the second week are:  
$10 x 8 = $80  Therefore, Lloyd's total earnings for the two weeks are:  
$50 + $80 = $130"
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 80 students in the class and each student has one vote. So, the total number of votes is 80 x 1 = 80 votes. Now, if the winner gets 3/4 of the votes, then they will get 3/4 x 80 = 60 votes. Therefore, the winner received 60 votes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra has ordered four times more red roses than white lilies. So if she ordered x white lilies, she ordered 4x red roses. We also know that she ordered 200 young calla lilies, which is five times the number of white lilies. Therefore, the total number of flowers ordered by Sandra is: x + (4x) + 200 = 6x + 200. Now, we are given that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This means that the number of red roses that must be delivered at 5 pm is equal to the total number of red roses ordered minus the number of red roses already received. In other words, the equation becomes: 6x + 200 - y = 0, where y is the number of red roses already received. Since Sandra has ordered 4 times more red roses than white lilies, it follows that for every one white lily received, three red roses have been received. Therefore, the number of red roses already received can be calculated as follows: y = 3(x/4). Substituting this into the previous equation, we get: 6x + 200 - 3(x/4) = 0. Solving for x, we find that: x = 180. Therefore, Sandra should receive 180 red roses and 72 white lilies (since she ordered four times more red roses than white lilies) by 5 pm in order to avoid switching suppliers.
Response:  We know that Jean is two years older than Mark and Mark is five years younger than half of Jan's age. So we can start by finding out how old Jan is.  If Jan is x years old, then Mark is (x - 5) years old.  And Jean is (x + 2) years old.  Now we have three equations: 1. Jean is two years older than Mark. 2. Mark is five years younger than half of Jan's age. 3. All three people are adults (over 18).  Can you use these equations to find out how old Jan is?
"Response:  First we need to calculate how long it takes for each member of the faster team to run their respective legs of the race. We know that each member will run their leg in 55 seconds. So if there are four members in the team, the total time taken by the team would be:  
Time = (55 sec/leg) x 4 legs = 220 sec or 3 minutes and 40 seconds. Now let's look at the slower team. We know that the first runner will take 60 seconds to complete his leg, and each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So the second runner will take:  
Time = (60 sec + 3 sec) = 63 sec The third runner will take:  
Time = (63 sec + 3 sec) = 66 sec And the fourth runner will take:  
Time = (66 sec + 3 sec) = 69 sec Therefore, the total time taken by the slower team is:  
Total Time = 60 sec + 63 sec + 66 sec + 69 sec = 268 sec or 4 minutes and 28 seconds. Since the faster team took 3 minutes and 40 seconds to complete the race, they are ahead of the slower team by:  
Difference = 3 min 40 sec - 2 min 28 sec = 1 minute and 12 seconds. So the faster team will win by approximately 1 minute and 12 seconds."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the probability of Jerry getting an even number.  Since there are 6 sides and only 3 even numbers (2,4,6), the probability of getting an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.  Now, let's calculate the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers.  There are only 2 possible combinations of two consecutive even numbers: (2,4) and (4,6). So, the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers is 2/6 = 1/3 or 33.33%.  Therefore, the probability that Jerry will get a larger number than 3 is 50% + 33.33% = 83.33%.
Response:  First, we know that Jenna took half of the apples her mother received. So if her mother received 20 apples, then Jenna took 10 apples (half of 20).  Therefore, together they took 20 + 10 = 30 apples.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 kandang for hamsters and each hamster is given 5 potong jerami. So, in total, there are 10 x 5 = 50 potong jerami used for hamsters.  Next, we know that there are 3 kandang for tikus-tikus and each kandang has 6 tikus. So, in total, there are 3 x 6 = 18 tikus in all three kandang. Now, we need to find out how many potong jerami are left after distributing the 160 potong jerami among the tikus-tikus. To do this, we can subtract the number of potong jerami used for hamsters (50) from the total number of potong jerami (160). This gives us:  
160 - 50 = 110  Therefore, there are 110 potong jerami left over for the tikus-tikus. Since each tikus is given 6 potong jerami, we can divide the remaining potong jerami by the number of tikus:  
110 / 18 = 6.11  Since we cannot have a fraction of a tikus, we round up to the nearest whole number. This means that there are approximately 6 tikus in each kandang."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mandy borrowed $100 from Benedict and agreed to pay him back with an interest rate of 2% per month. This means that after one month, Mandy owes Benedict $100 + (2% x $100) = $100 + $2 = $102. After two months, Mandy owes Benedict $102 + (2% x $102) = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04. If Mandy can pay back the loan after three months, she needs to give Benedict $104.04.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost price of each bag is $20 and the transportation cost from the farm to the warehouse is $2 per bag. So, if the trader sells all the bags at $30 each, he will have a total profit of $400 (since there are 10 bags). Now, let's calculate how many bags the trader needs to sell to make a profit of $400. We can do this by setting up an equation based on the information given in the problem: Total Profit = Number of Bags x Price per Bag - Cost Price per Bag. In this case, the total profit is $400, so we can write the equation as follows: 400 = x x 30 - 20 where x is the number of bags sold. To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation: 400 = x x 30 - 20 400 = x(30) - 20 400 = 3x - 20 Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get: 3x = 400 + 20 3x = 420 x = 420/3 x = 140 Therefore, the trader needs to sell 140 bags of rice to make a profit of $400.
Response:  First, we know that they spent $20 + $20 = $40 for three tickets to the exhibition. Next, they spent an additional $4.50 on food, so their total expenses are $40 + $4.50 = $44.50. Finally, they went on two different rides, each costing $33, so their total ride costs are $33 + $33 = $66. To divide all these expenses equally among themselves, each person will pay $44.50 / 3 = $14.83 for the tickets and food, and $66 / 3 = $22 for the rides, for a total of $14.83 + $22 = $36.83 per person.
Response:  First, we know that John can collect 2 persimmons per minute. Next, we are given that he collects them for 3 hours. Finally, we need to find out how many persimmons he collects in total.  To do this, we can use the formula: Total = Rate x Time So, in this case, the rate is 2 persimmons/minute and the time is 3 hours (or 180 minutes). Plugging these values into the formula, we get: Total = 2 persimmons/minute x 180 minutes = 360 persimmons Therefore, John collects 360 persimmons during his 3-hour collection period.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each bebek needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Since there are ten bebek in total, they need to eat 35 pounds (3.5 x 10) of insects per week.  Now, let's convert this amount to grams. There are approximately 453.6 grams in one pound, so:  35 pounds x 453.6 grams/pound = 15,928 grams  Therefore, the ten bebek need to eat approximately 15,928 grams or 15.9 kilograms of insects per day.
Response:  First, we know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and he also cuts down 2 trees per year. So, if he starts with 50 trees, after one year, he will have 50 - 2 = 48 trees left.  Next, we are told that after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. This means that 30% of 48 is 14.4 (since 30% of 48 is 14.4). So, after 10 years, Tom will have 48 - 14.4 = 33.6 trees left.  Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has after 10 years is approximately 33.6.
Response:  First, we know that there were originally 18 flamingos placed in front of Sue's house. On Saturday morning, one-third of them (6) were taken away and painted white. So, after Saturday morning, there were 12 flamingos left.  Then, on Sunday morning, 18 new red flamingos were added to the collection, bringing the total number of flamingos to 30. Finally, on Sunday afternoon, all the white flamingos were repainted in their original red color. Therefore, at the end of the day on Sunday, there were 30 red flamingos in front of Sue's house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each pen costs $ 2 and Violetta needs 5 pens of different colors. So, the total cost of all pens is 5 x $ 2 = $ 10. Since she has $ 20 to spend, she will have enough money to buy all the pens she needs. Therefore, the numeric answer is $ 10.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of one pen and one eraser.  One pen costs $1.20, and one eraser costs $0.30. So, the total cost of one set (one pen and one eraser) is: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50. Now, if we want to buy 8 sets of pens and erasers, we need to multiply the cost of one set by 8: $1.50 x 8 = $12.00. Therefore, the total cost of 8 sets of pens and erasers is $12.00.
Response:  First, we know that there are 200 pounds of potatoes (pon) in total.  Next, we know that each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of potatoes. So, if we divide 200 by 2, we get: 200 / 2 = 100 Therefore, there will be 100 pounds of potatoes left over after all the restaurants have received their share.
Response:  First, we know that there are 23786 people in total in Soda. Of those, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. That means there are 23786 - 8417 - 9092 = 5573 people who are not men or women. These must be children. So, there are 5573 children in Soda.
Response:  First month, Elaine had 20 cards.  Second month, she collected three times as many cards as she had in the first month, so she collected 3 x 20 = 60 cards. Third month, she collected twice as many cards as she had in the second month, so she collected 2 x 60 = 120 cards. Therefore, Elaine now has 120 + 20 = 140 cards.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark edits 1000 sentences each week for two publishers, A and B. The payment from Publisher A is $0.05 per sentence, while Publisher B pays $0.12 per sentence. So, the total amount earned by Mark from Publisher A is:  
1000 x $0.05 = $50  And the total amount earned by Mark from Publisher B is:  
1000 x $0.12 = $120  Therefore, the total amount Mark can earn in one week is:  
$50 + $120 = $170  In sen, the total amount Mark can earn in one week is:  
$170 x (1 sen) = 1700 sen"
Response:  First, we know that Baldur gets 5 embers of water in the morning and 6 embers of water in the evening.  Second, each ember contains 5 liters of water. So, if we multiply the number of embers he receives in the morning and evening by the amount of water in each ember, we can calculate how much water he receives overall.  In the morning, Baldur receives 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water.  In the evening, he receives 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water.  Therefore, Baldur receives a total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water per day.
Response:  First, we know that John gets a one-time cash award of $5000 for winning the recognition at work. Next, we are told that he receives a 5% salary increase as a result of this achievement. Finally, we want to find out how much money John will make in a year if he works 2000 weeks (or 40 weeks x 50 weeks per year).  To calculate John's annual salary with the 5% raise, we can use the following formula:  New Salary = Old Salary x (1 + Percentage Raise)  In this case, the old salary is what John was making before the raise, and the percentage raise is 5%. So, we can write:  New Salary = Old Salary x 1.05  Now, let's determine the old salary. If John works 2000 weeks per year, his weekly salary would be:  Weekly Salary = Annual Salary / Number of Weeks Worked  Weekly Salary = $X / 2000  Since John makes $X per year before the raise, we can set up an equation:  X = Weekly Salary x Number of Weeks Worked  X = ($X / 2000) x 2000  Solving for X, we get:  X = $20,000  Therefore, John's annual salary before the raise is $20,000. His new salary with the 5% raise is:  New Salary = $20,000 x 1.05  New Salary = $21,000  So, John's total earnings for the year, including the one-time cash award of $5000, would be:  Total Earnings = New Salary + Cash Award  Total Earnings = $21,000 + $5000  Total Earnings = $26,000
"Response:  First, we know that each hectare of vineyard produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Since there are 10 hectares of vineyard, the total amount of grapes produced is 10 x 5 = 50 tons per year. Next, we know that each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is 50 x 2 = 100 barrels. So, the answer to the question ""How many barrels of wine are produced per year?"" is 100 barrels."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carl eats sandwiches every Sunday for lunch and uses two slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he consumes 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese per week for his sandwiches.  Next, we are told that he eats omelets for breakfast three days a week and uses one slice of cheese per omelet. Therefore, he consumes 3 x 1 = 3 slices of cheese per day for his omelets, which is equivalent to 3 x 5 = 15 slices of cheese per week.  Furthermore, we know that Carl prepares big macaroni and cheese dishes several times a week and uses 8 slices of cheese in each dish. This means he consumes an additional 8 x 5 = 40 slices of cheese per week for his macaroni and cheese dishes.  In total, Carl consumes 14 + 15 + 40 = 69 slices of cheese per week.
Response:  First, we know that Janet has 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens in total. Then she buys 6 blue pens with 9 pens each, so she gets 6 x 9 = 54 new pens. Also, she buys 2 red pens with 6 pens each, so she gets 2 x 6 = 12 new pens. In total, Janet now has 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the average of the first five test scores: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458. Then, we divide the total score by 5 to get the mean: 458 / 5 = 91.6. Since Brinley needs a score of 93 to get an average of 93, she must obtain at least 93 - 91.6 = 1.4 points on the sixth test.
"Response:  First, we know that Michael rode his bike for 4 weeks and covered 25 kilometers each time, so he traveled a total of:  
25 km/week x 4 weeks = 100 km  
Next, we know that Michael reduced his riding to 2 times a week and increased the distance to 60 kilometers per ride, so he traveled a total of:  
60 km/ride x 2 rides/week x 3 weeks = 360 km  
Therefore, Michael traveled a total of 100 + 360 = 460 kilometers."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 cokelats and 80 apels in Joe's bag of candies. Secondly, each coklat has twice as much weight as an apple. Finally, we know that each coklat weighs 40 grams. So, let's start by finding out how many apples there are in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of apples by their weight: 80 x 40 = 3200 grams Now, we add the weight of all the coklats to find the total weight of the bag of candies: 25 x 40 + 3200 = 1000 + 3200 = 4200 grams Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candies is 4200 grams or 4.2 kilograms.
Response:  First, we know that Rose bought 4 kue on Monday (hari Senin). Next, she bought three times as many cupcakes on Tuesday (hari Selasa), so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cupcakes on Tuesday. On Wednesday (hari Rabu), she bought five times as many cupcakes as she did on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 cupcakes on Wednesday. In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cupcakes over the three days.
"Response:  First, we know that each half-dozen cups costs $6,000.  So, if we buy two dozen cups, we will pay twice this amount, or $12,000.  However, the seller is offering a discount of $1,200 for buying two dozen cups instead of one half-dozen.  Therefore, the total cost of buying two dozen cups will be:  
$12,000 (cost of two half-dozens) - $1,200 (discount) = $10,800  
So, the total cost per cup for two dozen cups is:  
$10,800 / 24 cups = $450 per cup."
"Response:  First, we know that Sara has $10 before she starts babysitting.  She earns $5 for each time she babysits her neighbors' children, so if she wants to buy a jacket and two pairs of shoes, how many times does she need to babysit to have enough money?  We can start by writing down what we know:  Sara has $10 initially (this is our ""starting amount"").  She earns $5 for each time she babysits.  The cost of the items she wants to buy are:  Jacket ($30), 2 pairs of shoes ($20 x 2 = $40).  Total cost = $70.  To find out how many times Sara needs to babysit to have enough money, we divide the total cost by the amount she earns per babysitting session:  $70 / $5 = 14.  So, Sara needs to babysit 14 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and two pairs of shoes."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and he has two white chickens that produce more eggs than one red chicken. So, if Jerry has x white chickens, then he will have 2x white chickens producing 5 eggs each per day, giving him a total of 2x \* 5 = 10x eggs from his white chickens. Since he only needs 42 eggs per day, we can set up an equation as follows:  
10x = 42 Therefore, x = 42/10 = 42/10 = 4 This means Jerry has 4 white chickens. Now, let's find out how many red chickens he has. We know that each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, so if Jerry has x red chickens, he will have 3x red chickens producing 3x = 3(4) = 12 eggs per day. Since he already has 42 eggs from his white chickens, he doesn't need any more eggs from his red chickens. Therefore, he must have zero red chickens!  So, Jerry has 4 white chickens and no red chickens."
"Response:  First, we need to convert the distance traveled into hours. We know that there are 6 miles in 1 mile, so: 

6 miles / 3 miles/hour = 2 hours 

Therefore, Gary will spend 2 hours walking around the park."
Response:  First day, Sloane counted 100 customers. Second day, she counted 50 more than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 200 customers. Third day, she counted 500 customers. So, if she counted 500 customers on the third day, then she must have counted 500 - 200 = 300 customers on the second day. Therefore, the number of customers that Sloane counted on the second day is 300.
"Response:  First, we know that the large pool has twice as much water as the small pool at some point in the past (4 minutes ago). So, if the large pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago, the small pool would have had x/2 gallons of water.  Now, we are told that the large pool currently has four times as much water as the small pool. This means that the current amount of water in the large pool is 4x gallons, and the current amount of water in the small pool is 4x/2 gallons.  We want to find out how many gallons of water are currently in the small pool. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Large pool: 4x gallons Small pool: 4x/2 gallons  Since the large pool currently has four times as much water as the small pool, we can write:  
4x = 4(4x/2)  Simplifying the equation:  
8x = 8x/2  Solving for x:  
x = 4 gallons  Therefore, there are 4 gallons of water currently in the small pool."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lori needs to earn in total before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt. We know that the cost of the shoes is $320 and the cost of the belt is $32. So, the total amount Lori needs to spend is: Total Cost = $320 + $32 = $352. Next, we know that Lori earns $8.00 per hour working part-time. To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn enough money for her purchases, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage: Hours Worked = Total Cost / Wage Per Hour Hours Worked = $352 / $8.00 Hours Worked = 44 hours (to the nearest whole number) Therefore, Lori needs to work for approximately 44 hours before she can afford to buy both items.
Response:  First, we know that Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. So, she will pay back $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200.  Now, if she pays $165 per month for 12 months, how much balance will be left for Janeth at the end of the payment period?  To find out, we can calculate the total amount paid over the 12-month period: Total Amount Paid = Number of Monthly Payments x Monthly Payment  Total Amount Paid = 12 x $165 = $1980  Since Janeth owes $2200 and has already received $1980 in payments, the remaining balance after all 12 payments are made is: Balance After All Payments = Original Debt - Total Amount Paid  Balance After All Payments = $2200 - $1980 = $220  Therefore, there will be $220 left over for Janeth at the end of the 12-month payment period.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 more daisies than tulips in the vase. This means that if there were x tulips in the vase, then there would be x + 7 daisies in the vase.  We also know that the total number of flowers in the vase is 14 (x + (x + 7)).  Can you use this information to find out how many tulips and daisies are in the vase?
Response:  First, we know that Harriet is currently 21 years old.  Next, we are given that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian is 3 x 21 = 63 years old.  Finally, we are told that Zack is half as old as Harriet, so Zack is half of 21, which is 10.5 years old.  Therefore, the average age of the three individuals is (63 + 21 + 10.5) / 3 = 84.5 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Naomi scored 68 points. Secondly, Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's score which means she scored (68 x 1.5) = 102 points. Thirdly, Brianna scored more than Naomi by 17 points which means she scored (68 + 17) = 85 points. Finally, we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. So, let's subtract the scores of all three girls from the total score of 251 points. Total score - Naomi's score - Yuri's score - Brianna's score = 251 - 68 - 102 - 85 = 48 points. Therefore, Jojo scored 48 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carmen needs 10 minutes to solve each crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve each Sudoku puzzle. Secondly, she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles during the weekend. Finally, we need to calculate how much time she spent playing these games altogether. To do this, we can use the following formula: Total Time = (Number of Crosswords x Time per Crossword) + (Number of Sudokus x Time per Sudoku) Total Time = (3 x 10) + (8 x 5) Total Time = 30 + 40 Total Time = 70 minutes So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:  
Tank capacity - Amount used = 120 L - 90 L = 30 L  Next, we are told that Celine was able to collect twice as much rainwater as the amount of water left in the tank. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:  
Twice the amount left in the tank = 2 x 30 L = 60 L  Finally, we add the amount of water left in the tank and the amount of rainwater collected to find out how much water is currently available in the tank:  
Total amount available = Amount left + Amount collected = 30 L + 60 L = 90 L  So, there are 90 liters of water currently available in the tank."
Response:  First, we know that Andy planted fewer petunias than geraniums. So, if he planted x geraniums, he must have planted less than x petunias. We can let x represent the number of geraniums Andy planted. Since there are more geraniums than petunias, we can write an inequality to express this information: x > 40 (the number of petunias) Now, we know that Andy planted a total of 90 flowers. Therefore, we can add the number of geraniums and petunias together to get: x + 40 = 90 Combine like terms: x + 40 = 90 Subtract 40 from both sides: x = 50 So, Andy planted 50 geraniums.
Response:  First, we know that the company spends one-third of its annual advertising budget on the next year's advertsing. So if they spend $15,000 in Year 1, they will spend $15,000 x 2/3 = $10,000 in Year 2.  Therefore, the total amount spent by the company on advertising over two years is $15,000 + $10,000 = $25,000.
Response:  First, we know that Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour and Benji rents a small boat for $18 per hour.  Next, we know that Carlos rents the canoe for 3 hours and Benji rents the small boat for 5 hours.  So, let's calculate how much each of them will pay separately:  For Carlos:  3 hours x $30/hour = $90  For Benji:  5 hours x $18/hour = $90  Now, let's add up their total costs:  $90 + $90 = $180  Therefore, the total cost for both of them to rent the equipment is $180.
"Response:  First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus. Second, we know that it takes half a day (or 6 hours) to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car. So if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will spend a total of:  
6 days + 6 hours = 12 days  
Therefore, Andrew will spend 12 days traveling from New Jersey to Rochester and back."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of cards that James has after he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass cards. Total number of cards = 30 + 20 - 8 + 14 = 56 cards. Next, we need to calculate the probability that the card chosen at random will be an air card. Probability = (number of air cards / total number of cards) x 100%. Number of air cards = 40. Total number of cards = 56. Therefore, probability = (40/56) x 100% = 71.43% (rounded to the nearest whole number). So, there is approximately a 71.43% chance that the card chosen at random will be an air card.
Response:  First, we know that the total cost of the burrito is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.25 = $9.75.  Next, we know that he added an extra $3.00 for a total of $12.75. However, he used a gift card worth $5.00, so he only needs to pay the remaining balance of $12.75 - $5.00 = $7.75.  So, he still owes $7.75.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place half of each piece per minute as well. So, together they can complete 4 x 2 = 8 pieces per minute.  Now, let's calculate how many minutes it will take to solve the entire puzzle with 360 pieces. We have:  
360 pieces / 8 pieces per minute = 45 minutes  Therefore, Kalinda and her mother will need 45 minutes to solve the entire puzzle together."
"Response:  First, we know that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested after two months, so we can find out how many watermelons were not yet ripe using the following formula: Total number of watermelons x Percentage not yet ripe = Number not yet ripe.  We are given that 30% of the watermelons were not yet ripe, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:  
Total number of watermelons x 30% = Number not yet ripe  Now we need to determine the total number of watermelons. The problem states that Ashlyn brought home 120 baby watermelons from the farm, so we can use this as our starting point:  
Total number of watermelons = 120  Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get:  
120 x 30% = Number not yet ripe  To solve for the number of watermelons that were not yet ripe, we can divide both sides of the equation by 30%:  
Number not yet ripe = (120 x 30%) / 30%  Simplifying, we get:  
Number not yet ripe = 36  So there were 36 watermelons that were not yet ripe after two months.  Next, we know that three-quarters of the remaining watermelons were ripe and ready to be harvested two weeks later. Using the same approach as before, we can calculate the number of watermelons that were still not yet ripe:  
Total number of watermelons x Percentage not yet ripe = Number not yet ripe  We are given that three-quarters of the remaining watermelons were ripe, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:  
(120 - 36) x 75% = Number not yet ripe  Where 120 is the total number of watermelons minus the number of watermelons that were already picked (36), and 75% is the percentage of watermelons that were ripe.  Solving for the number of watermelons that were still not"
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all 12 cars:  Total Cost = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000 Next, we need to calculate the tax payable on the total cost: Tax Payable = $240,000 x 10% = $24,000 Finally, we add the tax payable and the registration fee for each car: Total Amount Paid = $240,000 + ($24,000 x 12) = $240,000 + $288,000 = $528,000 So, the total amount paid by Mark for all 12 cars is $528,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kylie collected 5 more than Robert on Monday, so if Robert collected 20 shells, then Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.  On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collected 2 x 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.  Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  First, we know that there are 50 ants in the garden.  Second, we know that each ant can carry half of a apple.  So, if we want to find out how many apples are in the garden, we need to multiply the number of ants by half.  Therefore, the answer is:  50 x 1/2 = 25 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 36 penguins are standing in the snow. Secondly, one-third of them (12) jumped and swam in the ocean. Thirdly, another third (12) entered the cave to eat their dinner. So, how many penguins are still left outside in the snow? To find out, subtract the number of penguins who went into the cave from the total number of penguins: 36 - 12 = 24. Therefore, there are 24 penguins still standing in the snow.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week. So he consumes 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes per week. Now, if each tree can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then Steve needs 42 / 3 = 14 trees to meet his demand.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend will get 4 slices of pizza. So, the total number of slices required = 20 x 4 = 80 slices. However, since the pizzas are only sold in 8 portions, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John needs to order 9 pizzas (80/8 = 9).
"Response:  If Ram uses five empty pens to make one full pen, then he needs five empty pens for every full pen he wants to create.  Since he has 25 empty pens and wants to make one full pen, he can make:  
25 x 5 = 125 full pens  So, Ram has 125 full pens after using all his 25 empty pens."
Response:  First, Johnny takes out $20 from his wallet and adds $10 more, so he has a total of $30. Next, he invests this amount, which triples in one year. So, after one year, he will have $30 x 3 = $90.
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, and Joan is five years older than Jessa. So if Jessa is 20 years old, we can start with her age as our base.  
First, let's calculate Joan's age based on Jessa's age:  Five years more than Jessa's age = 5 + 20 = 25 years old.  Now, let's calculate Mary's age based on Joan's age:  Two years less than Joan's age = 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  Therefore, Mary is 23 years old, Joan is 25 years old, and Jessa is 20 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we know that 30% of the students left through door A, so the number of students who left through door A is 30% x 1000 = 300.  Next, we know that 3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, so the number of students who left through door B is 3/5 x (1000 - 300) = 3/5 x 700 = 420. Finally, we know that all the remaining students left through door C, so the number of students who left through door C is 1000 - 300 - 420 = 380. Therefore, the total number of students who left through door C is 380.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that James has 6 more than Robert. So if Robert has x permen, then James has x + 6 permen. Secondly, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, if Robert has x permen, then John has 2x permen. Finally, we are given that John has 54 permen. So we can set up an equation based on these facts:  
James has x + 6 permen = John has 2(x) permen = 2x permen  
Now we need to find out how many permen James has compared to John. To do this, we subtract the number of permen John has from the total number of permen James has:  
x + 6 - 2x =?  
Solve for x:  
3x + 6 = 54  
Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:  
3x = 48  
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:  
x = 16  
So James has 16 + 6 = 22 permen more than Robert."
Response: 1. Dolly has two books and reads one book to Pandora. 2. Pandora has one book and reads it to Dolly. 3. Now both have read all their own books to each other. So, in total, they will have read 2 + 1 = 3 books together.
Response:  First, we know that Mike has 5 friends and he stops being friends with 2 of them. That means he will only receive letters from 3 friends.  Secondly, each letter is 5 pages long, so there are 15 pages in total per week (3 x 5).  Finally, we know that Mike can write one page every 6 minutes, so he can write all 15 pages in: 15 pages x 6 minutes/page = 90 minutes per week.  Therefore, Mike spends 90 minutes per week writing replies to his three friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason has 1000 minutes for the month.  Secondly, he spends 15 minutes every day with his boss, which is equal to 450 minutes (15 x 30 = 450). Thirdly, he has 300 additional minutes of calls with other people. Therefore, the total number of minutes spent on calls is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes. Now, let's calculate how many minutes are left for the month. We can do this by subtracting the total number of minutes spent on calls from the initial 1000 minutes. So, the remaining minutes would be: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes. Finally, we need to convert these minutes into hours and minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 250 / 60 = 4.17 hours (or approximately 4 hours and 10 minutes).
"Response:  First, we know that Griffin has 24 potatoes and Kyle takes 5 of them. So, Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 potatoes.  Next, Billy takes twice as much as Kyle took, so he takes 2 x 5 = 10 potatoes from Griffin. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 potatoes left.  Then, Ginger gives Griffin some potatoes, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call this number ""x"". So, Griffin now has 9 + x potatoes.  Finally, Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle took, which is 3 less than 5, or 2 potatoes. So, Griffin now has 9 + x - 2 =...............?  To find out what value of ""x"" makes this equation true, let's simplify it: 9 + x - 2 =..................?  We can add 2 to both sides of the equation to get:  9 + x =..................?  Since we know that Griffin has 27 potatoes at the end, we can set up an equation:  9 + x = 27  Simplify the equation by subtracting 9 from both sides:  x =...............?  Solve for x by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:  x = 28  Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 28 potatoes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 siput in one aquarium and 32 siput in another aquarium. This means that the difference between the number of siput in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in one aquarium.  Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's call this number x.  Therefore, the difference between the number of siput in the two aquariums is 2x.  We also know that there are 4 siput in one aquarium, so the total number of siput in both aquariums is 4 + 32 = 36.  Now, can you use algebra to express the number of fish in each aquarium in terms of x?
Response:  First, we know that the cost of each hour is $250.  Second, we know that the total number of hours worked is 6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = 1200 hours. Third, we know that there will be a 10% discount after the completion of the project. So, to calculate the amount paid to Jean, we need to first calculate the total amount earned before the discount and then subtract the discount amount. Total Amount Earned Before Discount = 1200 hours x $250/hour = $300,000 Fourth, we apply the 10% discount: New Amount = Total Amount Earned Before Discount x (1 - 0.10) = $300,000 x 0.90 = $270,000 Therefore, Jean will be paid $270,000 for her work on the film.
Response:  First, we know that Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 on her brother's birthday party.  Next, we know that she divided the cost with her parents in three equal parts. So, each part is $96 / 3 = $32 per person.  Therefore, Isabelle paid $32 for her share of the party expenses.
Response:  First, we know that each bag of onions costs $1.50.  Second, we know that the chef bought four bags of onions.  So, if we multiply the cost of one bag by four, we get:  4 x $1.50 = $6.00  Therefore, the total amount spent by the chef on onions is $6.00.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sue eats 4 times more pudding than her sister every day, so if her sister eats x puddings, Sue will eat 4x puddings.  On Monday, Sue ate 5 puddings, so her sister ate 5/4 = x puddings.  Now, let's calculate how many calories Sue consumed on Monday.  Each pudding has 200 calories, so Sue consumed 5 x 200 = 1000 calories.  On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as much pudding as she did on Monday, so she ate 2 x 1000 = 2000 calories.  Since her sister only ate x puddings on Tuesday, Sue consumed more calories than her sister on both days.  Therefore, the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister over the two days is:  
2000 - x (Tuesday) + x (Monday) =?  To find out the value of x, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  x + x + 5 = 1000 + 2000  Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 5 = 3000  Solving for x:  
2x = 3000 - 5 2x = 2995  Dividing both sides by 2:  
x = 1497  So, Sue consumed 1497 calories more than her sister over the two days."
