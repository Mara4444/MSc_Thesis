Now, let's count the number of times the word ""llapa"" appears in the sentence.  There are three instances of ""llapa"" in the sentence.  Therefore, our answer is:  3"
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of repairing the car. We know that the cost of repairs is $50,000. Next, we need to calculate the percentage increase in the value of the car after the repairs. We are given that the value of the car increased by 150%. To find out how much the value of the car increased, we can multiply the original value of the car by 1.5 (which is the same as multiplying it by 150%). So, if the original value of the car was $80,000, then the new value of the car after the repairs would be: New Value = Original Value x Percentage Increase New Value = $80,000 x 1.5 New Value = $120,000 Therefore, the value of the car increased by $40,000 ($120,000 - $80,000).
Response: 1) James runs 3 races of 60 meters each. 2) He rests for one week (7 days). 3) During this time, he covers 60 x 3 = 180 meters in total. Since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer, we can say that James has run approximately 1.8 kilometers during his one-week break.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 20 chʼisiyuq (small bags) of cornmeal in total. We also know that each small bag contains 15 copas (handfuls) of cornmeal. So, if we multiply 20 by 15, we get:  
20 x 15 = 300 copas of cornmeal.  Next, we need to find out how many large bags (churakuns) of cornmeal can be made with 300 copas. Since each large bag contains 25 tʼantata (handfuls), we can divide 300 by 25 to get:  
300 / 25 = 12 large bags of cornmeal.  Therefore, there will be 12 large bags of cornmeal if all the small bags are used up."
Response:  First, we know that $5 x 60% = 3 dollars (since 60% of $5 is equal to $3). Now, if we subtract $3 from $5, we get $2. Therefore, the change is $2. So, the total cost of the item is $5 + $2 = $7.
Response:  We know that there are 4 people in Seattle and 20 people in Seattle plus 4 = 24 people in total. Now we need to find out how many people are in Toulouse and Charleston combined. Since there are 4 people in Seattle, we can say that there are 4 + x people in Toulouse and Charleston combined, where x is the number of people in Toulouse and Charleston. We also know that there are 20 people in Seattle, so we can set up the equation:  4 + x = 20. Solving for x, we get:  x = 16. Therefore, there are 16 people in Toulouse and Charleston combined.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla has 200 GB of free space and she wants to install a program that requires 2 GB of space. So, she will have enough free space for the installation. Secondly, if the program takes 40% of the CPU usage, it means that it will use 80% of one core (since there are two cores in a quad-core processor). Now, let's calculate how many minutes Carla can spend watching videos while the program is running. We know that the program runs for 20 minutes, so we can calculate the time left for video watching as follows: Total available time = Total time - Program runtime Time available for video watching = 120 minutes (2 hours) - 20 minutes = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes. Therefore, Carla can watch videos for approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes while the program is running.
"Response:  First, we know that John drives at a speed of 60 km/h for 3 hours to cover a distance of 180 km. So, he covers a distance of:  

180 km = (60 km/h) x (3 h)

Now, let's find out how long it takes him to cover the remaining distance of 240 km at a speed of 80 km/h. We can use the formula:  

Time = Distance / Speed

So, time taken to cover the remaining distance of 240 km at a speed of 80 km/h is:  

Time = 240 km / 80 km/h

Time = 3 h

Therefore, John will take 3 hours more to cover the remaining distance of 240 km at a speed of 80 km/h."
"Response:  First, we know that Eliza has $40 and spends $10 on something. So she has $40 - $10 = $30 left. Now, if she spends $1.2 on each hour of the remaining 45 hours, we can calculate how much she will spend in total as follows:  
$30 x 45 hours = $1350  
So, Eliza will spend $1350 in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 60 questions in total and 30 of them (50%) are from the internet. So, to find out how many questions are not from the internet, we can subtract 30 from 60: 60 - 30 = 30. Therefore, there are 30 questions that are not from the internet.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of each item in dollars:  Donuts (3 dozen): $3 x 12 = $36 Mini Cupcakes (2 dozen): $2 x 12 = $24 Mini Cheesecakes (6 dozen): $5 x 12 = $60 Total Cost: $36 + $24 + $60 = $110 Now, let's convert this amount from dollars to soles using the exchange rate given in the problem: 1 dollar = 3.8 soles So, we can multiply the total cost by 3.8 to get the answer in soles: $110 x 3.8 = 418 soles Therefore, the total cost of all the items is 418 soles.
"Response:  We know that each lemon costs $1.50 and there are 7 lemons in total. So, the cost of all the lemons is:  
$1.50 x 7 = $10.50  Now we need to add the transportation cost, which is $3 per bag. Since there are 3 bags, the total cost becomes:  
$10.50 + $3 x 3 = $10.50 + $9 = $19.50  Therefore, the total cost of the lemons including transportation is $19.50."
Response:  First, we know that Melanie has 5 pieces of candy and she wants to divide them equally among 3 people. So, if we divide 5 by 3, we get... (counting on our fingers)...1 piece of candy per person! And yes, there are 1 piece of candy left over after dividing all 5 pieces equally among the 3 people.
Response:  We know that there are 100 students in total and 20 of them (20%) listen to contemporary music, 25 of them (25%) listen to jazz, and 35 of them (35%) listen to hip-hop. To find out how many students listen to hip-hop, we can multiply the number of students who listen to hip-hop by the percentage of students who listen to hip-hop. In this case, we can multiply 35 by 100 to get 3500. So, approximately 3500 students listen to hip-hop.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each item based on its value and the commission rate provided in the problem statement. For jewelry, the commission rate is 2.5%, so we can calculate the cost as follows: Cost = Value x (1 + Commission Rate) Jewelry Cost = $8,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $8,000 x 1.025 = $8,170 For electronics, the commission rate is 1.2%, so we can calculate the cost as follows: Electronics Cost = $5,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $5,000 x 1.012 = $5,060 Now that we have calculated the costs for both items, we can compare them to determine which one has a higher total cost. Based on our calculations, the total cost for jewelry is $8,170, while the total cost for electronics is $5,060. Therefore, the answer is ""Jewelry"" because it has a higher total cost than electronics."
Response:  First, we know that the distance between San Rafael and Manta is 80 kilometers. Next, we are told that the distance between Manta and Quito is 150 kilometers. Finally, we want to find out how much of this distance will be covered by train. So, let's calculate: Distance between Manta and Quito = 150 km Total distance to be covered = 80 + 150 = 230 km Therefore, the portion of the distance that will be covered by train is: 230 km - 80 km = 150 km
"Response:  First, we know that Jill has $20 to spend on books and she wants to buy 3 books. So, if each book costs $6, how many books can she buy? We can calculate this as follows:  
$20 / $6 = 3 books  
So, Jill can buy 3 books with her $20. Next, we know that Jill is also spending $30 on cheerleading uniforms and equipment. If she needs a cheerleading uniform and some equipment, let's assume that the uniform costs $20 and the equipment costs $10. So, in total, Jill will be spending:  
$30 + $20 = $50  
On cheerleading. Now, we need to find out how much money Jill will have left after buying all of these items. To do this, we subtract the amount she spent on cheerleading from the original $50:  
$50 - $50 = $0  
Jill will have no money left after buying all of these items. Therefore, the answer to the question ""¿Hayk'a qollqeyuqtaq kanman?"" (Do you have enough money?) is NO, Jill does not have enough money to buy everything she needs."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of tortillas that can be made with 3 cups of masa harina. One cup of masa harina makes approximately 8-10 tortillas, so three cups will make around 24-30 tortillas. However, since you want to make small tortillas, let's assume that each cup of masa harina will yield 6-7 tortillas. Therefore, three cups of masa harina will make around 18-21 small tortillas.
Response:  We know that Marissa has been walking for 12 miles and she has walked at a rate of 4 kilometers per hour. So, we can calculate how long it took her to walk those 12 miles: 12 miles x 4 kilometers/hour = 48 hours. Therefore, Marissa has been walking for 48 hours.
Response:  We know that 10 liters of orange juice and 15 liters of pineapple juice are needed for the recipe. If we mix them in equal parts, then each part will contain 10 + 15 = 25 liters. Since we need to fill 24 liter jugs, we can fill 24 / 25 = 96% of the capacity of each jug. Therefore, we have 96 x 3 = 288 liters of juice mixture in total.
"Response:  We know that: 

Raymond has 6 friends (Raymondwa). 
Samantha has 23 friends (Samanthawa). 
There are 31 days in March (watayoqña). 
We want to know if there is any day when both Raymond and Samantha have the same number of friends. 

Let's create a table to organize the information:

| Day | Raymond Friends | Samantha Friends |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 6 | 23 |
| 2 | 6 | 23 |
|... |... |... |
| 31 | 6 | 23 |

Now, let's look at each day and compare the number of friends Raymond and Samantha have on that day:

Day 1: Raymond has 6 friends, Samantha has 23 friends. No match. 
Day 2: Raymond still has 6 friends, Samantha still has 23 friends. No match again. 
...
Day 31: Raymond still has 6 friends, Samantha still has 23 friends. No match yet again. 

Since we didn't find any day when both Raymond and Samantha had the same number of friends, the answer is NO, there is no day when both Raymond and Samantha have the same number of friends."
Response: 1) How many clients will come to buy DVDs? We don't know yet. 2) If each client buys one DVD, how many DVDs will be sold in total? One per client. 3) But what if some clients don't buy any DVDs? Then we won't sell as many DVDs. So let's calculate the minimum number of DVDs that must be sold for the business to break even. That would be the case where no clients buy any DVDs, so we need to have at least one DVD available for each client, or else we can't satisfy their demand. In this case, we need to have at least $10$ DVDs available for sale (since each DVD costs $10). Therefore, the minimum number of DVDs that must be sold is $10$.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many centimeters are in 1 punchaymanta (1 punchaymanta = 5 punchaykamas).  We know that 1 punchaykama is equal to 2 centimeters, so:  
1 punchaymanta = 5 punchaykamas = 5 x 2 cm = 10 cm  
Now, let's calculate how many centimeters are in 5 punchaykamas:  
5 punchaykamas = 5 x 2 cm = 10 cm  
Therefore, there are 10 centimeters in 5 punchaykamas and 1 punchaymanta."
"Response:  First, we know that Kyle has $19.50 and he wants to buy a book that costs $25. So, if he buys the book, he will have spent all of his money ($19.50).  Next, we are told that there is a sale of 25% off the original price of the book. This means that the discounted price of the book would be:  
$25 x (1 - 0.25) = $25 x 0.75 = $18.75  
So, after applying the discount, the book would cost $18.75 instead of $25. Therefore, the value of the book to Kyle is $18.75."
Response:  First, we know that Marie has to pay $50.  We also know that she spent $12 on doughnuts and $3 on each of five packages of milk, for a total of $3 x 5 = $15.  That means she has $50 - $15 = $35 left to spend.  Now, we see that four apples cost $1.50, so if she buys four apples, she will have spent all her remaining money.  Therefore, the maximum number of apples Marie can buy is  35 / 1.50 = 23.
"Response:  First we need to calculate the total cost of each item: 
Shorts: $16.50 x 3 = $49.50
Pants: $22.50 x 3 = $67.50
Shoes: $42 x 3 = $126
Total Cost: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243
Therefore, mishkaqa (the sum) is $243."
Response:  First, we know that there are 15 cartons of ice cream and each costs $4. So, the total cost is 15 x $4 = $60. Now, if we want to buy 60 portions of ice cream, we can calculate as follows: 60 / 4 (portions per carton) = 15 cartons needed. Therefore, we need 15 cartons of ice cream to have 60 portions at a total cost of $60.
Response:  First, we know that Henry has traveled 60 kilometers in total. Secondly, he has covered 20 kilometers from his starting point. Therefore, the distance left to cover is: 60 - 20 = 40 kilometers. Now, we are told that he can only walk at most 15 kilometers per day. So, it will take him: 40 / 15 = 2 days to complete the remaining journey.
"Response:  First, we know that the price of the shoes is $5 per pair and there are 3 pairs in total. So, the total cost of the shoes is:  
$5 x 3 = $15  Now, let's look at the second option. The price of the boots is $33 per pair, but there is only one pair available. So, the total cost of the boots is:  
$33 x 1 = $33  Since the total cost of the shoes ($15) is less than the total cost of the boots ($33), it makes more sense to buy the shoes. Therefore, the correct answer is:  
No hay dólares jinaj chay botes (There are no dollars for the boots)."
Response:  First, we know that there are 7 people in total (nisqanpim). Second, we know that Allenpa has 162 friends (watasnintam), and third, we know that he has 10 close friends (watasninmanjina). So, to find out how many of his friends Allenpa has in common with the other 7 people, we need to find the intersection between his 162 friends and the 7 people. To do this, we can use set theory.  Set A = {Allenpa's 162 friends}, and Set B = {the 7 people}. Now, we need to find the intersection of these two sets, which gives us the number of friends they have in common.  To find the intersection, we can use the following formula: |A ∩ B| = |A| × |B| / (|A| + |B| - |A ∪ B|). Here, |A| = 162, |B| = 7, and |A ∪ B| = 169 (since Allenpa has 162 friends and the 7 people have 7 friends, respectively). Plugging in these values, we get |A ∩ B| = 162 × 7 / (162 + 7 - 169) = 10. Therefore, Allenpa has 10 friends in common with the other 7 people.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 80 beans in total and 20 of them belong to Kuraj. So, the number of beans left for the other three friends (Gunter, Botella, and Manuela) is:  
80 - 20 = 60 beans.  Now, we know that each friend gets an equal share of the remaining beans, so they will get:  
60 / 3 = 20 beans each.  But wait! We also know that Gunter gets 25% more than his friends, so he will get:  
20 x 1.25 = 25 beans extra.  Therefore, Gunter's total share will be:  
25 + 20 = 45 beans.  And finally, we can calculate the percentage of beans that each friend gets based on their total share:  
For Gunter: 45 / 80 x 100% = 56.25%  
For Botella: 20 / 80 x 100% = 25%  
For Manuela: 20 / 80 x 100% = 25%"
"Response:  To calculate how many weeks there are in 5 months, we need to know that there are 4 weeks in a month. So, if we multiply 5 (months) by 4 (weeks/month), we get:  
5 x 4 = 20 weeks."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to identify the main verb in the sentence. The main verb is ""qolqeyoqtaq"" which means ""to be"". Secondly, we need to determine the subject of the sentence. The subject is ""Gretchenqa"" which is a proper noun and refers to a specific person. Therefore, the answer is:  
No, there is no Qolqe for Gretchenqa because it is a proper noun and cannot be used with the verb ""qolqeyoqtaq""."
"Response:  We know that: 
1) Siobhan has less value than Aaron. 
2) Aaron has 5 jobs. 
3) Each job pays $40 per day. 
So, we can calculate how much money Siobhan makes in total as follows: 
Total amount of money Siobhan makes = Number of jobs x Amount paid per job 
= 5 x $40 
= $200 
Therefore, Siobhan makes $200 per day."
Response:  First, we know that Mike has played for 40 minutes and has won 4 points. So, he has won 4/60 = 1/15 of the game. Now, if he plays for another 20 minutes, he will have played a total of 40 + 20 = 60 minutes. If he wins 25% more points in the additional 20 minutes, then he will win (1/15) x 25% = 3/80 of the remaining points. Therefore, the total number of points Mike will win is 1/15 + 3/80 = 9/80.
Response:  First, we know that there are 4 yogurt cups for $5, so each cup costs $5/4 = $1.25. Now, if we want to buy 30 cups of yogurt, we need to multiply the cost per cup by 30: 30 x $1.25 = $37.50. So, the total amount needed to buy 30 cups of yogurt is $37.50.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 Lego sets available for $15 each. Secondly, we have 20 dollars to spend in total. Thirdly, each set has an average of 8 video games. Lastly, we want to buy at least 5 sets. So, let's calculate how many sets we can buy with our budget:  
15 x 13 = 195 (total cost of all 13 sets)  
195 / 20 = 9.75 (number of sets we can buy with $20)  
Since we want to buy at least 5 sets, we will round up to the nearest whole number:  
9.75 > 5 (we can buy more than 5 sets)  
Therefore, we can buy 6 sets of Lego with our $20 budget."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John runs for 60 kilometers per week. Secondly, he runs for 3 hours every day. Therefore, to calculate how many weeks it would take John to cover 3 Horas, we need to divide 3 Horas by his running time per day, which is 3 hours. So, we have:  

3 Horas / 3 Hours/day = 1 Week  
Therefore, John can cover 3 Horas in 1 week."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours it takes for a car to travel 3 kilometers at 60 km/h. We know that: Distance = Speed x Time So, we can write: 3 km = 60 km/h x Time To solve for Time, we divide both sides of the equation by the speed: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 3 km / 60 km/h Time = 0.05 h or 5 minutes Now, we want to find out how many hours it would take for the car to travel 6 kilometers at the same speed. We can use the formula again: 6 km = 60 km/h x Time Again, we divide both sides of the equation by the speed: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 6 km / 60 km/h Time = 0.1 h or 1 hour Therefore, if a car travels at 60 km/h, it would take 5 minutes to cover 3 kilometers and 1 hour to cover 6 kilometers.
Response:  We know that Brandon has an iPhone and wants to transfer his data to a new iPhone.  Therefore, he needs to backup his iPhone first.  If he backups his iPhone using iCloud, then he can restore his data from the backup when he sets up his new iPhone.  So, the answer is 2 (iCloud Backup).
Response:  First, we know that the perimeter of the larger circle is 1000 meters.  We also know that the radius of the smaller circle is 400 meters.  To find the area of the smaller circle, we can use the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius.  So, the area of the smaller circle is A = π(400)^2 = 160000 square meters.  Now, let's find the area of the larger circle.  We know that the circumference of the larger circle is 1000 meters, so we can use the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius.  Since the circumference is given in meters, we know that r must be in meters too.  So, r = 500 meters (since 2πr = 1000).  Therefore, the area of the larger circle is A = πr^2 = π(500)^2 = 250000 square meters.  Finally, to find out how much land the two circles take up together, we add their areas:  Total Area = A + B = 250000 + 160000 = 410000 square meters.
Response:  First, we know that there are 14 apples in total (tukurqanku). Second, we know that Abuela Jones has 5 tarta manzanas (mikhunata ruwarqan), so she has 5/14 of the total number of apples. Finally, we can calculate how many apples Abuela Jones has by multiplying 5/14 by 14, which gives us 7 apples. Therefore, Abuela Jones has 7 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 400 calories in 100 grams of chocolate chip cookies (300 grams x 400 calories/100 grams = 120,000 calories). To find out how many cookies we can make with 2000 or 1800 calories, we need to divide each number by 120,000.  So, for 2000 calories: 2000 / 120,000 = approximately 16.7 cookies (rounded to the nearest whole number) For 1800 calories: 1800 / 120,000 = approximately 15 cookies (rounded to the nearest whole number) Therefore, if you want to consume 2000 calories, you could have approximately 16-17 chocolate chip cookies, and if you want to consume 1800 calories, you could have approximately 15-16 chocolate chip cookies.
"Response:  First, we know that Charlie has 10 chocolates and each chocolate costs $1. So, in total, he has $10.  Now, if he wants to buy something that costs $2, he will have to use all of his money. Therefore, he won't have any money left after buying the item.  If he had $2 more, he could buy the item and still have $2 left over.  So, what is the minimum amount of money Charlie needs to have in order to buy the item?  We can set up an equation to represent this situation:  
Let x be the amount of money Charlie needs to have. Then, we know that:  
x + 10 = 2 (since he needs $2 more than he already has)  Solving for x, we get:  x = 20  Therefore, Charlie needs at least $20 to buy the item."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 days in a week (Monday to Friday). Secondly, we know that each day has 24 hours (from midnight to midnight). Therefore, the total number of hours in a week is 5 x 24 = 120 hours. Now, let's calculate how many hours Meredith spends on her blog per week. According to the information given, she spends 4 hours per day on her blog, so the total number of hours she spends on her blog per week is 4 x 7 = 28 hours. Finally, we can calculate the percentage of time Meredith spends on her blog by dividing the number of hours she spends on her blog by the total number of hours in a week, which gives us 28/120 = 0.23 or 23%.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many Post-its are needed for each of the 23 cartels. We can do this by dividing the number of cartels (23) by the number of Post-its per cartel (220). This gives us: 

23 / 220 = 10 

So, we need 10 sets of 220 Post-its for all the cartels. Now, let's calculate how many Post-its in total we will use. We know that there are 10 sets of 220 Post-its, so we multiply 10 x 220: 

10 x 220 = 2200 

Therefore, we will use 2200 Post-its in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of the original corbata was $50 and it was sold for $40. So, the loss incurred is $50 - $40 = $10. Now, if we sell the remaining 200 corbatas at $40 each, we will earn $40 x 200 = $8000. But we have already lost $10, so our net profit would be $8000 - $10 = $7990.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many plants are needed for each row based on the number of rows and the distance between them. We know that there will be 4 rows with 6 plants in each row (6 x 4 = 24). Now, let's calculate the total number of plants needed for all four rows: 24 x 4 = 96 plants. So, yes, you will have enough plants (96) to cover the area of 10 square meters (10 m²) with 6 plants per square meter.
"Response:  We know that 15 is divided into 8 and 3/4 as follows:  
8 + 3/4 = 8 + (3 x 4) = 8 + 12 = 20  
Therefore, 15 is equal to 20."

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 40 dollars in total and they will be divided among 6 people. So each person will get $40/6 = $6.67.  Now, let's see how much each person will get if we subtract the cost of lunch (12 cups of coffee x 3 soles per cup = 36 soles) from the initial amount. $6.67 - 36 soles = $6.67 - 36 = $0. That means everyone will have to pay for their own lunch.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 7 members in the Doubtfire family (hermanakunaqa). Next, we see that each member has a unique name (chaykunataq aychakunapaq) except for one who is called ""Trixie"" (nisqa pusajtaj). Therefore, we can deduce that there are 6 unique names and 1 repeated name (""Trixie""). Finally, we see that there are 12 members in total (wawanta), so we can conclude that the number of unique names plus the repeated name is equal to 12.  Thus, the answer is:  6 + 1 = 7"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jean has 30 chuchiyuqmi (small birds). Secondly, she gives each of her friends one chuchiyuqmi as a gift. So, in total, she gives away 30 chuchiyuqmi. Now, let's calculate how many chuchiyuqmi are left with Jean after giving them away. We can do this by subtracting the number of chuchiyuqmi given away from the original number of chuchiyuqmi possessed by Jean. In this case, we need to subtract 30 from 30, which results in zero! Yes, you heard it right - Jean has no chuchiyuqmi left after giving them all away.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Peter spent $7 on cinema tickets and he has $7 left. So, if he spends $42 on something else, how much will be left with him after paying for it?

$7 - $42 =?  Can you solve this subtraction problem and tell me the result?"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each book costs based on its weight and price per kilogram. We know that there are 5,000 books in total, so we can multiply the cost of one book by 5,000 to get the total cost of all the books.  Next, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the books using the bridge toll. The bridge toll is $15 for every 15 pounds (or 6.8 kilograms), so we need to divide the total weight of the books by 15 to determine how many times the toll needs to be paid. Finally, we add the cost of the books and the shipping toll to get the total cost of transporting the books.  Here's the calculation:  Total Cost of Books = 5,000 x $3.755/book = $18,775  Number of Times Bridge Toll Needs to Be Paid = Total Weight of Books / 15 pounds per toll payment = 3,755 kg / 15 kg per toll payment = 250 toll payments  Total Cost of Shipping = 250 x $15/toll payment = $3,750  Total Cost of Transporting Books = Total Cost of Books + Total Cost of Shipping = $18,775 + $3,750 = $22,525

"Response:  First, we know that there are 20 small fruits and 67 large fruits in total. We also know that there is no strawberry among the small fruits. So, we can start by listing out all the possible combinations of small and large fruits that could add up to 67:  
1 small fruit + 66 large fruits (since there are 66 large fruits remaining after subtracting one small fruit)  
2 small fruits + 65 large fruits (since there are 65 large fruits remaining after subtracting two small fruits)  
...  
20 small fruits + 47 large fruits (since there are 47 large fruits remaining after subtracting all 20 small fruits)  
Now, let's check each combination to see if it includes a strawberry:  
1 small fruit + 66 large fruits: No strawberries.  
2 small fruits + 65 large fruits: No strawberries.  
...  
20 small fruits + 47 large fruits: Yes, there is one strawberry!  
So, the answer is yes, there is a strawberry among the fruits."
Response:  First, we know that there are 25 oranges in total. Of those, 1 orange is eaten by the person who asked the question (chaymanta). So, there are now 24 oranges left. Next, we know that 20% of the remaining oranges are also eaten (20% of 24 = 4.8). Therefore, there are 24 - 4.8 = 19.2 oranges left. Finally, we know that 2 more oranges are taken (2 naranjasqa ch'aki), leaving us with 19.2 - 2 = 17.2 oranges. So, there are 17.2 oranges left after everyone has had their share.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items purchased:  
Chaypaq (500 x $10) = $5,000  
Chaymanta (800 x $10) = $8,000  
Total Cost = $5,000 + $8,000 = $13,000  
Next, we need to calculate the amount of the discount:  
Discount (10% of $13,000) = $1,300  
Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final price:  
Final Price = $13,000 - $1,300 = $11,700"
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that will be paid out over 20 years at an interest rate of 5%. Then, we can subtract the amount of money that will be paid in penalties for early withdrawal. Finally, we can calculate the net present value (NPV) of the investment.  Total Amount = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^20 = $879,625.82 Penalty for Early Withdrawal = $879,625.82 x 5% = $43,981.26 NPV = $879,625.82 - $43,981.26 = $835,644.56 So, after 20 years, the investor would have $835,644.56 if they do not withdraw any money before maturity, and they would lose $43,981.26 as penalty if they withdraw all the money after 10 years.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of 1 kilogram of potatoes is $140. Next, we need to find out how much 10% less than this price is. To do this, we can subtract 10% of $140 from the original price.  
10% of $140 = $14 (since 10% of any number is obtained by multiplying the number by 0.1)  Therefore, 10% less than $140 is: 
$140 - $14 = $126 So, the cost of 1 kilogram of potatoes reduced by 10% is $126."
"Response:  First, we know that the car consumes 4 gallons of gasoline for every 100 kilometers traveled (chay rayku, 100 kilostrana purirqa, chayraykutaj 4 galonesta juntʼananpaj churarqa). Therefore, to calculate how much gasoline is consumed in 12 liters, we need to convert kilometers to liters. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (in kilometers) by 100. So, if we travel 120 kilometers (12 x 10), we would consume:  

120 km / 100 = 1.2 liters

Therefore, the car consumes 1.2 liters of gasoline for every 100 kilometers traveled. To find out how much gasoline is consumed in 12 liters, we can simply multiply the number of liters by the number of kilometers traveled:  

12 litros x 1.2 litros/100 km = 14.4 litros

So, the car consumes approximately 14.4 liters of gasoline when traveling 120 kilometers."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 weeks in one month (30 days). So, if there are 3 months in a season (90 days), then there are 4 x 3 = 12 weeks in a season. Now, let's calculate how many episodes of a TV show can be broadcasted in one season based on the given information. We know that each episode lasts for 45 minutes, so we need to convert the number of weeks to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and since each episode lasts for 45 minutes, we can calculate the total number of hours as follows: 12 weeks x 45 minutes/week = 540 minutes/season. Therefore, a TV show can broadcast up to 540 minutes or 9 hours of content per season.
Response: 1) The school has 5 basketball teams (basketbolmanta). 2) Each team has 5 players (pukllaykuna). Therefore, there are 5 x 5 = 25 students playing basketball in total.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of diamonds and emeralds in the necklace. Then, we can subtract the rubies from that total to find out how many rubies are missing. Finally, we can use subtraction to determine how many diamonds and emeralds are needed to replace the missing rubies. Here's the calculation: Total number of diamonds + emeralds = 175 (diamonds) + 35 (emeralds) = 210 stones. Subtracting the rubies: 210 - 35 = 175. So there are 175 diamonds and emeralds in the necklace. To replace the missing rubies, we need to add 35 more rubies to the existing ones. Therefore, the answer is 35 rubies.

Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Sheila will have after 3 years at an interest rate of 2%.  We can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n where:  A is the future value (the amount she will have after n years) P is the principal amount (the initial $150) r is the annual interest rate (2%) n is the number of years (3) So, A = $150(1 + 0.02)^3 A = $198.47 Therefore, Sheila will have $198.47 after 3 years if she deposits $150 initially and earns an interest rate of 2% per year.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much each vendor sold of each flower.  We know that Artieqa sold 12 bottles of calendula, 9 bottles of petunia and 17 bottles of begonia. So we can start by calculating how much each vendor made from each type of flower.  For calendula, Artieqa sold 12 x 2.74 = $33.08. For petunia, she sold 9 x 1.87 = $16.83. And for begonia, she sold 17 x 2.12 = $35.64. Now let's add up all these amounts to find out how much Artieqa made in total: $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.64 = $85.55.

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 180 puppies in total and each puppy has eaten 3 cups of food. Therefore, the total amount of food consumed by all the puppies is 180 x 3 = 540 cups. Now, let's calculate how much food Cecilia has given to her 110 puppies. Since she has given them 2 cups of food each, the total amount of food given by Cecilia is 110 x 2 = 220 cups. So, the difference between the total amount of food consumed by all the puppies and the amount of food given by Cecilia is 540 - 220 = 320 cups. Therefore, the answer is 320 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sarah has $10 and she gives $2 to each of her three friends, so she will have $10 - 2 \times 3 = $10 - 6 = $4 left.  Next, we know that David has $8 and he gives $2 to each of his two friends, so he will have $8 - 2 \times 2 = $8 - 4 = $4 left.  Therefore, the total amount of money that Sarah and David have left after giving gifts to their friends is $4 + $4 = $8.
"Response:  First, we need to convert the amounts from dollars to soles:

So, Charlie does not have any more apples left with him."
Response:  First, we know that Alex has 4 cups of water and wants to give each of his friends an equal amount of water (i.e., grace). So he will divide 4 cups among them. Since there are 5 friends in total (including Alex), each friend will receive 4/5 = 0.8 cups of water. Now, let's check if this is enough for each friend to drink 1 cup of water. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of cups each friend receives by the number of cups they need to drink: 0.8 x 1 = 0.8 cups. Yes, 0.8 cups is greater than or equal to 1 cup, so each friend will have enough water to drink 1 cup.

Based on the information given, we know that Jackson has 10 watermelons. Therefore, we can say that:  10 > 7 (10 is greater than 7)  Yes, Jackson does have more watermelons than Corey.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gerald has run for 400 meters in 38 seconds. So, his speed is: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 400 meters / 38 seconds Speed = 10.5 meters/second Now, we need to find out how much time it would take Gerald to run 100 meters if he runs at a speed of 10.5 meters/second. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 100 meters / 10.5 meters/second Time = 9.6 seconds Therefore, Gerald would take 9.6 seconds to run 100 meters if he runs at a speed of 10.5 meters/second.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the number of days in each month.  We know that there are 365 days in a year and 12 months.  Each month has at least 30 days (February has 28 or 29 days).  So, let's start with March, which has 31 days.  Then, we can subtract one day for each month until we reach February.  Here's the calculation:
March - 31 days
April - 30 days
May - 31 days
June - 30 days
July - 31 days
August - 31 days
September - 30 days
October - 31 days
November - 30 days
December - 31 days
January - 31 days
February - 28 days (or 29 days)

Now, let's add up all these numbers to find out how many days there are in 12 months:

31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 28 (or 29) = 417 days

So, there are 417 days in 12 months."

So, Fredaqa needs 16 onzas more of tomatoes to make 32 onzas of tomato sauce."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 cars in total and each car takes 15 minutes to pass through the road. So, if one car passes through the road, it will take 15 minutes. If there are 5 cars, it will take 5 x 15 = 75 minutes for all the cars to pass through the road. Now, let's calculate how much time each car has to wait before its turn. There are 20 carriages in total and each carriage takes 20 minutes to pass through the road. So, if one carriage passes through the road, it will take 20 minutes. If there are 5 cars, each car has to wait for (20 - 15) = 5 minutes before its turn. Therefore, the total waiting time for each car is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has 18 sheep and each sheep gives birth to one lamb every month. So, after one month, Mary will have 18 + 18 = 36 sheep. After two months, she will have 36 + 18 = 54 sheep. And so on. Therefore, after n months, Mary will have 36 + (n - 1) x 18 = 54 + (n - 1) x 18 sheep. To find out how many sheep Mary will have after 40 months, we can substitute n = 40 into the equation above:  36 + (40 - 1) x 18 = 36 + 39 x 18 = 36 + 724 = 760 sheep.  So, after 40 months, Mary will have 760 sheep.
Response:  First, we know that Jerome has 20 friends and each friend has 4 dogs. So, in total, there are 20 x 4 = 80 dogs. Now, if each dog has 10 puppies, then there would be 80 x 10 = 800 puppies. However, the question states that only 60 of these puppies are Chihuahuas, so we need to find out how many Chihuahuas there are among the 800 puppies. To do this, we can divide 60 by 10, which gives us 6. Therefore, there are 6 Chihuahuas among the 800 puppies.

Response: 1) Johnqa has 5 friends (uj). 2) Each friend has 3 hats (manchay mikhuywan), so there are 5 x 3 = 15 hats in total. 3) Each hat has 4 flowers (chawpi mikhuywan), so there are 15 x 4 = 60 flowers in total. 4) But we need to subtract the flowers that Johnqa already gave away (chaymantataq puñunanpaq), which is 3 flowers per friend x 5 friends = 15 - 3 = 12 flowers left. Therefore, Johnqa has 12 flowers left after giving away some of them.
Response:  First, we know that there are 10 minutes in 1 kilometer, so there are 10 x 3 = 30 kilometers in 3 kilometers. Next, we know that there are 42 miles in 1 degree (of latitude), and since each degree is equal to 60 minutes of arc, we have 42 / 60 = 0.7 miles per minute. Therefore, if it takes 30 minutes to travel 3 kilometers, then it would take 30 x 0.7 = 21 miles to travel those same 3 kilometers. So the answer is 21 miles.

"Response:  We know that there are three boxes (John) and each box has a different size: 5 inches, 6 inches, and 4 inches. We also know that the total volume of all three boxes is 15 cubic centimeters. To find out how much each box holds, we can add up their volumes. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. So let's use this formula to calculate the volume of each box:  
Box 1 (5 inches wide, 6 inches long, 4 inches high): Volume = 5 x 6 x 4 = 240 cubic centimeters Box 2 (6 inches wide, 6 inches long, 4 inches high): Volume = 6 x 6 x 4 = 360 cubic centimeters Box 3 (4 inches wide, 6 inches long, 4 inches high): Volume = 4 x 6 x 4 = 128 cubic centimeters Now we have the volumes of all three boxes. Since they add up to 15 cubic centimeters, we can set up an equation: 240 + 360 + 128 = 15 Therefore, the sum of the volumes of the three boxes is equal to 15 cubic centimeters. Solving for the unknown quantity (the volume of the first box), we get: 240 = 15 So, the volume of the first box is 15 cubic centimeters. Similarly, we can solve for the other two boxes: 360 = 15 (volume of the second box) 128 = 15 (volume of the third box) Therefore, the volumes of the three boxes are: First box: 15 cubic centimeters Second box: 15 x 3 = 45 cubic centimeters Third box: 15 x 2 = 30 cubic centimeters"

Therefore, we can say that 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours (since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour)."
Response:  First, we know that there are 15 more gallons of water needed to fill the tank. So, if the current amount of water in the tank is x gallons, then the total amount of water needed to fill it up is x + 15.  Next, we know that the capacity of the tank is 110 gallons, so we can set up an equation: x + 15 = 110.  Solving for x, we get: x = 95.  Therefore, there are 95 gallons of water currently in the tank.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one gallon of gasoline is $3. Therefore, the cost of 10 gallons of gasoline will be:  
Cost = Price x Quantity  
= $3 x 10  
= $30  
Now, let's calculate the total amount spent at the new company, including the cashback premium. We know that the new company offers a cashback premium of 20 dollars for every 10 gallons of gasoline purchased. So, if we spend $30 on gasoline, we will receive a cashback premium of:  
Cashback Premium = Total Amount Spent x Cashback Rate  
= $30 x 20%  
= $6  
Therefore, the total amount spent at the new company, including the cashback premium, will be:  
Total Amount Spent = Cost + Cashback Premium  
= $30 + $6  
= $36"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marcella has 14 apples and Beatrice has 24 apples. So, if they share their apples equally among themselves, then Marcella will have 14/2 = 7 apples and Beatrice will have 24 - 14 = 10 apples. Now, let's check how many apples each of them has after sharing. Marcella has 7 apples and Beatrice has 10 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples shared between them is 7 + 10 = 17 apples.
Response:  First, we know that the total distance traveled by car is 16 km + 20 km = 36 km. We also know that the time taken to travel this distance at a speed of 64 km/h is 36 km / 64 km/h = 0.56 hours (or 36 minutes). Now, let's calculate how long it takes for the bus and subway together to cover the same distance. The bus travels at a speed of 40 km/h, so it covers 36 km in  36 km / 40 km/h = 0.9 hours (or 54 minutes). The subway travels at a speed of 50 km/h, so it covers the same distance in  36 km / 50 km/h = 0.72 hours (or 43 minutes). Therefore, the total time taken by both modes of transportation together is 0.9 + 0.72 = 1.62 hours (or 1 hour and 42 minutes).
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the cost of each item separately.  For the first item, we need to pay $10 for the juk and $5 for the clasepi, so the total cost would be $15.  For the second item, we need to pay $20 for the tawa and $10 for the yachachiq, so the total cost would be $30.  Finally, for the third item, we need to pay $15 for the tabla and $10 for the t'aqanakunku, so the total cost would be $25.  Therefore, the total cost of all three items would be $15 + $30 + $25 = $70.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours there are in 15 days:  
15 x 24 = 360 hours. Now, let's calculate how many minutes there are in 360 hours:  
360 x 60 = 21,600 minutes. Finally, let's calculate how many seconds there are in 21,600 minutes:  
21,600 x 60 = 1,312,000 seconds. So, there are approximately 1,312,000 seconds in 15 days."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jamal has taken 6 photos and each photo has been viewed 1800 times. So, in total, Jamal's photos have been viewed 6 x 1800 = 10,800 times. Now, let's consider Brittany's case. We know that she has taken 50 photos and each photo has been viewed 500 times. Therefore, in total, Brittany's photos have been viewed 50 x 500 = 25,000 times. Finally, we need to compare these two numbers to determine which one is greater. Clearly, 25,000 is greater than 10,800, so the correct answer is:  25,000.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each table. There are 10 tables in total, so if one table costs $10, then the total cost of all tables is:  
$10 x 10 = $100  Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frames. There are 4 frames in total, and each frame costs $16, so the total cost of all frames is:  
$16 x 4 = $64 Finally, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the frames to get the total cost of everything:  
$100 + $64 = $164 So the total cost of everything is $164."
"Response:  First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours and minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:  

7:13 = 7 x 60 + 13 = 425 + 13 = 438 minutes  Now, let's calculate how much sugar is needed for each cup of coffee:  

For 1 cup of coffee, we need 2 tablespoons (uj) of sugar. So, for 438 minutes, we need:  

438 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 7.3 hours 7.3 hours x 2 tablespoons/hour = 14.6 tablespoons of sugar  Therefore, we need approximately 14.6 tablespoons of sugar for 438 minutes of coffee."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all items: 3 x $15 = $45 + 2 x $20 = $40 + $60 x 2 = $120.  So, the total cost is $120.
Response:  Firstly, we have two containers of vehicles imported, each containing five vehicles. Total number of vehicles = 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles. Secondly, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by all the vehicles. Since each vehicle has to travel 30 kilometers from the port to the destination, the total distance traveled by all the vehicles = 10 x 30 = 300 kilometers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adrien has $30,000 and he wants to invest it in a business. Secondly, Lylah has $40,000 and she wants to lend some of her money to Adrien for his business. Thirdly, they agreed that if the business fails, Adrien will return only $40,000 to Lylah, which means that Adrien needs to pay back $40,000 out of the total amount invested. Now, let's calculate how much Adrien needs to pay back to Lylah. We can do this by subtracting the amount that Adrien needs to pay back from the total amount invested. So, we have: Total Amount Invested = $30,000 + $40,000 = $70,000 Amount to be paid back = $40,000 Therefore, Adrien needs to pay back $40,000 to Lylah.
"Response:  We know that Miguel has 30 sheets of paper and he wants to cut them into equal parts using a guillotine. If we assume that each part should be roughly the same size, then we can start by dividing 30 by the number of parts we want to make. For example, if we want to make 4 parts, we would divide 30 by 4:  
30 ÷ 4 = 7  So, there would be 7 equal parts of paper. However, since Miguel only needs 6 parts, we can stop here and say that there are 6 equal parts of paper."
"Response:  First, we know that there are 5 apples and 8 oranges in total.  We also know that Kaeltaj took 3 apples and Ismael took 2 oranges. So, if we subtract the number of fruits taken by each person from the total number of fruits, we get:  
Apples: 5 - 3 = 2  
Oranges: 8 - 2 = 6  
Therefore, there are 2 apples and 6 oranges left."
"Response:  First, we know that Sadieqa has been working for 8 hours (horas).  We also know that she takes a 30-minute break (pisilla) after every 4 hours of work (p'unchay). So, if we divide 8 hours into 4 equal parts, we get:  
8 hours = 4 x 2 hours + 30 minutes  
Now, let's calculate how many breaks Sadieqa takes:  
4 x 2 hours = 8 hours (since each break lasts for 2 hours)  
Adding the number of breaks to the total hours worked:  
8 hours + 30 minutes = 8 hours + 0.5 hours = 8.5 hours  
Therefore, Sadieqa works for 8.5 hours, including her breaks."
Response:  First, we know that Rosie ran 10 kilometers in 3 hours. That means she ran at a rate of 10 km/3 h = 3.33 km/hour. Next, we are given that Chamantha ran 8 kilometers in 2 hours. That means he ran at a rate of 8 km/2 h = 4 km/hour. Finally, we want to find out if there is a difference of more than 1 kilometer between their running speeds. To do this, we can subtract their running speeds:  3.33 km/h - 4 km/h = -0.67 km/h So, there is no difference of more than 1 kilometer between their running speeds. In other words, both runners have similar running speeds.
Response:  First, we know that there are 60 cartakunas (baskets) in total. Of those, 30 belong to Jennie and the rest (30 x 12 = 360) are shared among the other villagers. So, Jennie has 30 baskets.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many times ""Julia"" appears in the text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each letter in the name ""Julia"".  Here is the count for each letter:  J (1), U (3), L (2), I (2), A (1).  So, the total number of times ""Julia"" appears in the text is:  1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9.  Next, we need to calculate how many times ""wasi"" appears in the text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each letter in the word ""wasi"".  Here is the count for each letter:  W (1), A (2), S (2), I (1).  So, the total number of times ""wasi"" appears in the text is:  1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6.  Now, let's compare the number of times ""Julia"" and ""wasi"" appear in the text. Since 9 > 6, we know that ""Julia"" appears more often than ""wasi"" in the text. Therefore, the answer to the question ""Does Julia appear more often than 'wasi' in the text?"" is YES."
"Response:  First, we have to find out how many times ""t'antata"" appears in the text. There are three instances of ""t'antata"". Next, we need to determine how many times ""ima"" appears in the text. There is one instance of ""ima"". Finally, we need to count how many times ""ruwarqan"" appears in the text. There is one instance of ""ruwarqan"". Therefore, the total number of words that appear in the text is: 3 (t'antata) + 1 (ima) + 1 (ruwarqan) = 5."
Response: 1) There are 20 friends of Amy and each has 50 friends, so there are 20 x 50 = 1000 friends in total. 2) Of these, 50 are also friends with Lily, so we need to find out how many of these 50 friends are also friends with Amy. To do this, we can use the fact that if someone is friends with both Amy and Lily, they must be friends with at least one of them. So, we can count the number of people who are friends with either Amy or Lily (or both). We know that Amy has 20 friends, and Lily has 50 friends, so together they have 70 friends. Therefore, the number of people who are friends with either Amy or Lily is 70. Now, let's subtract the number of people who are only friends with Lily (50) from the total number of people who are friends with either Amy or Lily (70), to get the number of people who are friends with both Amy and Lily: 70 - 50 = 20. So, there are 20 people who are friends with both Amy and Lily.
Response:  First we need to calculate how many oranges are needed for each jar of marmalade. We know that there are 5 jars and each jar needs 4 oranges. So, in total, we need 5 x 4 = 20 oranges for all the jars. Now let's see how much money is needed for each jar of marmalade. We know that one jar costs $15. So, if we multiply $15 by 5 jars, we get $75. Therefore, the total cost of all the jars of marmalade is $75.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 500 patients in the hospital and each patient needs to be treated for 24 minutes. So, the total time required to treat all the patients is: Total Time = Number of Patients x Treatment Time per Patient Total Time = 500 x 24 Total Time = 12,000 minutes or 200 hours. Now, let's calculate how many days it would take to treat all the patients: Days Required = Total Time / Working Hours per Day Days Required = 200 hours / 8 working hours/day Days Required = 25 days. Therefore, it would take 25 days to treat all the patients if each patient requires 24 minutes of treatment.
Response:  First, we know that there are 60 llamas in total and they belong to three people: Santa, Mallki, and Elfo. Each person has 20 llamas. Now, let's focus on the third person, Elfo. We know that Elfo has 10 llamas more than what Santa and Mallki have together. So, if Santa and Mallki have 20 llamas each, then Elfo has 30 llamas (10 more than 20). Therefore, the number of llamas owned by each person is: Santa - 20, Mallki - 20, and Elfo - 30.
"Response:  First, we know that José spent $500 and Junior spent $60. So together they spent $500 + $60 = $560. Now, if they had spent all of their money, then they would have nothing left over. However, the problem states that they have some money left over after spending it. Therefore, we can conclude that they did not spend all of their money. Let's call the amount of money they have left over ""x"". We know that x is greater than zero because they have some money left over. So we can write an equation based on this information:  

x + (500 + 60) =? 

Now let's solve for x. We know that 500 + 60 = 560, so we can substitute this into our equation:  

x + 560 =? 

Simplifying, we get:  

x + 560 = x + 500 + 60 = 560 + 500 + 60 = 1120  

Therefore, the amount of money they have left over is $1120 - $560 = $560."
"Response: 1) The number of passengers who will travel in each bus (Fredtaj and his friends): 6 x $20 = $120 per group. Total amount collected from all groups = $120 x 3 groups = $360.   
2) Cost of transportation for one passenger (Pamwa and her friends): $20 x 4 passengers = $80. Total amount to be paid back = $80 x 2 trips = $160.   
3) Profit made by Fredtaj and his friends = $360 - $160 = $200."
Response:  First we need to calculate how many kilometers were traveled each day.  Monday and Tuesday both traveled for 4 days, so they covered 4 x 40 = 160 km. Wednesday traveled for 3 days, so it covered 3 x 40 = 120 km. In total, they covered 160 + 120 = 280 km.
"Response:  First, we know that the cost of the sweater is $15 and it is made of wool.  So, if we want to calculate how much money we will save by buying the cheaper one, we need to find out how much the other sweater costs.  The problem states that the other sweater costs less than $15, so let's assume it costs $x dollars.  Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  
$15 - x = amount saved  
We know that the amount saved is $10, so we can substitute this value into the equation:  
$15 - x = $10  
Now, solve for x by adding $15 to both sides of the equation:  
$15 + $10 = $25  
So, x = $25 - $15 = $10  
Therefore, the other sweater costs $10."
"Response:  We know that Brian has played 20 video games and has won 5 trophies.  If we subtract the number of trophies he has won from the total number of games he has played, we get:  
20 - 5 = 15  So, Brian has played 15 video games without winning any trophies.  Now, let's calculate how many games Bobby has played.  We know that Bobby has played 5 times more games than Brian has played without winning any trophies. Therefore, we can multiply the number of games Brian has played without winning any trophies by 5 to find out how many games Bobby has played:  
15 x 5 = 75  So, Bobby has played 75 video games."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 unicorns in Scotland. Secondly, each unicorn has a horn that can grant wishes. Thirdly, if we want to wish for something, we need to find the unicorn and ask it nicely. Fourthly, since there are 27 unicorns, we have 27 chances to make our wishes come true. Finally, if all of us work together, we might be able to find all 27 unicorns and make all of our wishes come true! So, the answer is 27.
Response:  First, we know that Rory bought $7.50 worth of chips and $1.50 worth of cookies. So, in total, she spent $9 ($7.50 + $1.50). Now, if she received $20 in change, then she must have paid with a $29 bill ($20 - $9 = $29). Therefore, the correct answer is $29.
Response:  First we need to find out how many times 75 goes into 100. We can do this by dividing 100 by 75. 100 / 75 = 1 with a remainder of 25. So, 75 goes into 100 14 times with a remaining amount of 25. Now we need to find out how many times 8 goes into 25. We can do this by dividing 25 by 8. 25 / 8 = 3 with a remainder of 1. So, 8 goes into 25 3 times with a remaining amount of 1. Finally, we need to add up all the numbers that 75 and 8 go into 100. 14 + 3 + 1 = 18. Therefore, the result of 75 and 8 is 18.
"Response:  First, we need to count how many times each letter appears in the word ""ch'ulla"".  We can do this by using a tally mark for each letter that appears in the word.  Here is the tally mark for each letter in ""ch'ulla"":

C - 3
H - 4
L - 2
L - 2
A - 1

Now, let's add up all these tallies to get the total number of letters in ""ch'ulla"".  We can do this by adding up all the numbers above:

3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 12

So, there are 12 letters in the word ""ch'ulla""."
Response:  We know that there are 20 carreteras in total, and of those, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. To find out what percentage of the total is automatic, we can use the following formula:  Percentage = (number of automatic / total) x 100  In this case, the number of automatic carriers is 12, and the total number of carriers is 20. So, we can plug these numbers into the formula like this:  Percentage = (12 / 20) x 100  Simplifying, we get:  Percentage = 60%  Therefore, approximately 60% of the total number of carriers are automatic.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 700 bees in total (chaypi 700). Secondly, we know that 300 of them are worker bees (chaypi llankʼaj), and thirdly, we know that each worker bee has 3 drones with it (sipas abejasmanta iskay kuti aswan ashkhasta kanku). Therefore, the number of drones is 3 x 300 = 900. Finally, we can conclude that there are 900 drones in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jordan has $10 and he wants to buy a game that costs $5. So, he will have $10 - $5 = $5 left after buying the game. Now, if he wants to buy another game that costs $3, he will have $5 + $3 = $8 left. Therefore, the total amount of money Jordan will have left after buying two games is $8.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of each item without taxes:  John = $2, Leche = $3, Huevos = $3, Bombillas = $3, Copas = $3. Total = $15. Next, we need to calculate the 10% tax rate:  Tax Rate = 10%. Now, let's multiply the total cost by the tax rate to find out the amount of tax owed:  Tax Owed = $15 x 10% = $1.50. Finally, we add the tax owed to the original total cost to get the final price with taxes included:  Final Price = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the cost of each product.  The first product has a price of $92 per unit and we need 3 units, so the total cost would be:  
$92 x 3 = $276  For the second product, we need 5 units and its price is $80 per unit, so the total cost would be:  
$80 x 5 = $400  Now, let's add both costs:  
$276 + $400 = $676  Finally, we need to subtract the discount of 10% (which is $67.60) from the total cost:  
$676 - $67.60 = $608.40  So, the total amount that Lucas needs to pay is $608.40."
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land and he harvests 100 ananas per hectare. So, in total, John harvests 10 x 100 = 1000 ananas. However, we are asked if Juan (John) can sell all the ananas he harvests. To do this, we need to calculate how many ananas Juan has after selling 3 kilos. If Juan sells 3 kilos of ananas, he will have 1000 - 3 = 997 ananas left. Therefore, the answer is NO, Juan cannot sell all the ananas he harvests because he still has 997 ananas left after selling 3 kilos.
Response:  First, we know that Johnny has 500 blocks of Lego.  Second, each block can be connected to other blocks in six different ways (up, down, left, right, front, and back). Therefore, the total number of possible combinations of blocks that Johnny can create with his 500 blocks is 6 x 6 x... x 6 = 6^500.  However, not all of these combinations are unique or valid. For example, if we rotate one block by 90 degrees without moving any other block, it will still count as a separate combination. So, we need to subtract out the redundant combinations. One way to do this is to divide the total number of combinations by the number of rotations of each block (which is 4! = 24) to account for the fact that each block can be rotated four times. Doing so gives us: 6^500 / 24 = 1,378,240.  This is the estimated number of unique and valid combinations of Lego blocks that Johnny can create with his 500 blocks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 30 bees and each bee can collect pollen for 6 hours. So, in total, they can collect pollen for 180 hours (30 x 6). Now, let's calculate how much time it would take for all the bees to collect pollen if they work together. We know that one bee can collect pollen for 6 hours, so if there are 30 bees, it would take them 180 hours to collect pollen (180 hours / 6 hours per bee = 30 bees). Therefore, it would take all 30 bees working together 180 hours to collect pollen.
Response:  First, we know that Brittany has $12 and she spends $10 on something. So, how much does she have left? We can calculate this by subtracting $10 from $12: $12 - $10 = $2. Therefore, Brittany has $2 left after spending $10. Now, if she wants to buy something that costs $8, will she have enough money? Yes, she will! She has $2 left, and $8 is less than $2, so she will be able to buy it.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and one of them is Dorothy. So, if we subtract 1 (Dorothy) from 12, we get 11. Therefore, Charlie has 11 friends left on Facebook besides Dorothy.
Response:  First, we know that Steve ran 3 miles in 440 minutes (or 7 hours). We can calculate his speed like this: Speed = Distance / Time So, Speed = 3 miles / 440 minutes = 0.75 miles/minute or 12 km/hour Now, let's convert the distance to meters: 1 mile = 1609.34 meters (approximately) Therefore, 3 miles = 3 x 1609.34 = 4828.01 meters To find out how many meters Steve ran in one hour, we can multiply his speed by the number of minutes he ran: Meters per minute = Speed x Minutes So, Meters per minute = 12 km/hour x 60 minutes = 720 meters/hour Finally, to find out how far Steve ran in 264 meters, we can divide the total distance by the speed: Total distance = Distance / Speed So, Total distance = 4828.01 meters / 720 meters/hour = 6.65 hours Or, in minutes, Total distance = 6.65 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 399 minutes In other words, Steve ran for 399 minutes, which is equivalent to 6.65 hours.  As for the winner, since Steve ran for 399 minutes, and the race lasted for 264 minutes (40 minutes less than Steve), the winner would be Steve, who ran for more time than the race lasted.
"Response:  First, we know that each bicycle tire costs 25 cents.  We also know that there are 5 bicycles in total and they all need new tires. So, to calculate how much it will cost for all 5 bicycles, we multiply the cost of one tire by 5:  
25 cents x 5 = $1.25  
Therefore, it will cost $1.25 for all 5 bicycles to get new tires."
Response:  First, we know that Carl has 10 packages of galletas (galletawa) and each package contains 5 cookies (sojta). So, in total, Carl has 10 x 5 = 50 cookies. We also know that each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of all the cookies is 50 x $0.10 = $5. Therefore, Carl needs to pay $5 for all the cookies.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many packets of potato chips (fritas) are needed for each person. We have 5 people and each packet contains 3 servings, so we need 5 x 3 = 15 packets of potato chips. Next, we need to calculate how many packages of potato chips we will need in total. Since there are 4 people who want to eat the fritas with cheese, and each package contains 2 servings, we need 4 x 2 = 8 packages of potato chips with cheese. Therefore, the total number of packages of potato chips we need is 15 + 8 = 23 packages.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 weeks in the semester and each week has 5 days (Monday to Friday). Therefore, the total number of class days in the semester is:  
16 weeks x 5 days/week = 80 class days.  Now, let's consider the days when Kim teaches her classes. We know that she teaches on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. So, the number of class days taught by Kim is:  
4 days/week x 16 weeks = 64 class days.  Since Kim teaches all four days of the week, she will have taught all 64 class days.  There are no extra class days for Kim."
Response:  First we need to calculate how many meters of each type of pastry are needed for 300 breakfasts.  For that, we multiply the number of breakfasts by the length of each pastry:  * Croissants: 300 x 6 cm = 1800 cm (or 1.8 m)  * Baguettes: 300 x 60 cm = 18000 cm (or 18 m)  Now we know how much of each pastry is needed in total. To find out how many units of each pastry we need, we divide the total amount by the length of each unit:  * Croissants: 1800 cm / 6 cm = 300 units  * Baguettes: 18000 cm / 60 cm = 300 units  So, we need 300 units of croissants and 300 units of baguettes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for each animal based on their dietary needs.  Gorillas require 400 bananas per day, baboons require 100 bananas per day, and chimps require 200 bananas per day.  Therefore, the total number of bananas required for all three animals is:  400 + 100 + 200 = 700 bananas per day.  Since there are 30 days in a month, the total number of bananas required for the entire month is:  700 x 30 = 21,000 bananas.  So, to feed these three primate species for one month, you would need approximately 21,000 bananas.
Response:  First, we know that Blake ran 15 minutes or 900 seconds (15 x 60 = 900). We also know that he ran 100 meters in this time, so his speed is: Speed = Distance / Time = 100 meters / 900 seconds = 0.11 meters per second (or 110 centimeters per second) Now, let's calculate how far Kelly ran based on her speed and the time she took: Since Kelly ran for 40 minutes (40 x 60 = 2400 seconds), and her speed is given as 0.8 meters per second, we can calculate the distance she ran using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time = 0.8 meters/second x 2400 seconds = 1920 meters (or 1920 meters x 100 centimeters/meter = 192,000 centimeters) So, Kelly ran 192,000 centimeters or 192 kilometers. Finally, to find out how many laps Blake ran, we need to divide the total distance he ran (100 meters) by the distance he ran each lap (90 meters): Number of laps = Total distance / Lap distance = 100 meters / 90 meters = 1 lap Therefore, Blake ran one lap.
Response:  First, we know that Rafael wants to buy books and he has $20 dollars. He spends $1.50 for one book, so he has spent $1.50 already. Now he has $18.50 left. For two more books, he will spend $2 x $1.50 = $3, so in total, he has spent $1.50 + $3 = $4.50. Therefore, the amount of money Rafael has after buying all three books is $18.50 - $4.50 = $14. So, the answer is $14.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 questions in total. Secondly, each question has 4 options (A, B, C, and D). Therefore, the number of possible combinations for each question is 4 x 4 = 16. So, the total number of possible answers is 11 x 16 = 176. However, since one option is always correct, we need to subtract 1 from this total. Hence, the final answer is 175.
"Response:  First, we know that the length of the tank is 5 meters (uj). Then, on Tuesday, it rained 7 meters (aswan yaku karqa), so the total length of the tank after Tuesday is:  
Length of tank = 5 m + 7 m = 12 m Now, let's see how much water was added to the tank on Wednesday. We are told that the amount of water added was one-third of the tank's capacity (chay pʼunchaypi yakuqa). So, if the tank has a capacity of x liters, then one-third of the capacity is:  
x/3 liters One-third of the tank's capacity was added on Wednesday, so the new length of the tank is:  
Length of tank = 12 m + (x/3) liters To find the value of x, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:  
12 m + (x/3) liters = 15 m Since the length of the tank increased by 3 meters (martes pʼunchaymanta iskay terciosman pisillaña), we can write:  
12 m + (x/3) liters = 15 m Solving for x, we get:  
x = 45 liters Therefore, the value of x is 45 liters. The length of the tank after Wednesday is:  
Length of tank = 12 m + (45/3) liters = 12 m + 15 liters = 27 m"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many days have passed since Anakin was born. We know that he is currently 10 years old and was born when his father was 20 years old. So, we can calculate the number of years that have passed as follows:  
Years = (Current age - Birth age) / Age at birth  
Years = (10 - 20) / 20  
Years = 10/20 = 0.5 or 5 years  
Now, let's calculate how many days have passed since Anakin was born. We know that there are 365 days in a year, so we can multiply the number of years by 365 to get the total number of days:  
Days = Years x 365  
Days = 5 x 365  
Days = 1825 or 1825 days  
Therefore, Anakin has been alive for 1825 days."
Response:  First, we know that 100% of $20 is $20.  Now, if 20% of $20 is $4 (20 x 20% = 4), then 80% of $20 must be $32 (20 x 80% = 32). Therefore, $36 is not enough to cover the entire amount of $20.
Response:  First, we know that Chay has 5 pu (stones) and wants to buy 3 drawings for $4 each. So, she needs to pay 4 x 3 = 12 dollars in total. But wait! She only has 5 pu, so she doesn't have enough money to buy all three drawings. If she buys just one drawing, she will need to pay 4 dollars. Since she has 5 pu, she can buy one drawing and still have 1 pu left over. Therefore, the maximum number of drawings Chay can buy is 1.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of the service is $3 per hour and the client has used the service for 3 hours, so the total cost would be:  
$3 x 3 = $9  
Next, we know that there is an additional charge of $35 for the equipment, so the total cost would be:  
$9 + $35 = $44  
Finally, we are told that the company charges a commission of 10% on the total cost, so the final amount to be paid would be:  
$44 x 10% = $4.40  
Therefore, the client needs to pay a total of $48 ($44 + $4.40)."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money is needed for the computer and its accessories.  The cost of the computer is 1090 euros (chaypaqqa computadorakuna rantiq wasiman rispa). Additional costs include a monitor (chaypin pantalla), keyboard (teclado), and mouse (ratón) which together cost 157 euros (chantapis). Therefore, the total cost of the computer and its accessories is:  
1090 + 157 = 1247 euros. Next, we need to add the cost of the software and other expenses. According to the information provided, the family needs 1500 euros (chaytaqa tukuy familian qonanku) for the year. This includes 1090 euros for the computer and its accessories, and an additional 410 euros for other expenses such as software, maintenance, and repairs. Therefore, the final answer is:

"Response:  First, we need to identify the numbers in the problem. We have: 

* 9 (chʼakiwan)
* 3 (ch'akiyuq)
* 15 (ispañullata)

Next, we need to determine how these numbers relate to each other. From the context of the problem, we know that there are 9 chunks of candy and each chunk has 3 pieces of candy inside. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on this information: 

9 x 3 =?

We also know that Sandra has 15 pieces of candy in total. So, we can add this information to our previous equation as follows: 

9 x 3 + 15 =?

Now, let's solve for the missing number. To do so, we can start by multiplying 9 and 3: 

9 x 3 = 27

Next, we add 15 to the result: 

27 + 15 = 42

Therefore, the correct answer is 42."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sethqa has 28 friends and she wants to divide them into groups of 4 or more. So, we can start by finding out how many groups of 4 or more can be made with 28 objects. To do this, we can use the formula for combinations: n! = (n - 1)! x (n - 1)!, where n is the number of objects and! represents factorial. In this case, n = 28 and we want to make groups of 4 or more, so we need to find out how many ways there are to choose 4 or more objects from 28. We can calculate this as follows:  
(28 - 1)! x (28 - 1)!) = (27 x 26 x... x 3 x 2 x 1) = 2590400.  
So, there are 2590400 ways to divide 28 objects into groups of 4 or more. However, not all of these divisions may be possible since some groups may have fewer than 4 members. To account for this, we need to subtract out the number of ways to divide the objects into groups of less than 4 members. There are 28 choices for the first object in each group, 27 choices for the second object, and so on until there are no objects left, for a total of:  
(28 x 27 x... x 1) = 28!. This gives us a total of:  
2590400 - 28! = 2590400 - 28 x 27 x... x 1 = 2590400 - 28 x 27 x... x 1 = 2590400 - 28! = 2590400 - 28 x 27 x... x 1 = 2590400 - 28! = 2590400 - 28! = 2590400 - 28! = 2590400 - 28! = 2590400 - 28!"
Response:  First, we know that Ethelpa has $8 and she wants to buy something that costs $10. So, she needs $2 more than what she has. Now, let's see if Jimmy can help her with that amount.  If Jimmy has $10, he will have $10 - $2 = $8 left after buying something for Ethelpa. Therefore, yes, Jimmy can help Ethelpa with the $2 she needs.

So, the total cost for three people would be $150."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many insects there are in total. We have 80 spiders and each spider has 8 insects, so we multiply 80 x 8 = 640 insects. Next, we add the number of mutant insects which is 3 x 10 = 30. Therefore, the total number of insects is 640 + 30 = 670. Now, let's calculate the percentage of mutants among all insects. To do this, we divide the number of mutants (30) by the total number of insects (670), and then multiply by 100. So, the percentage of mutants is (30/670) x 100% = 4.35%.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how many fingers are in each hand of Sally.  We know that Sally has four fingers in one hand and three fingers in the other hand. So, if we add up all the fingers in both hands, we get:  
Four fingers x 1 hand = 4 fingers  
Three fingers x 1 hand = 3 fingers  
Total number of fingers = 4 + 3 = 7 fingers  
Now let's count how many times Sally can clap her hands together. Since she has seven fingers, she can clap her hands together seven times. Therefore, the answer is:  
Sally can clap her hands together 7 times."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Jessica owes.  Total debt = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000. Next, we need to calculate the percentage of the debt that is interest. Interest rate = (Total debt x Rate) / 100. In this case, the rate is 50%. So, Interest rate = ($1,000 x 50%) / 100 = 50%. Now, let's calculate the amount of interest that Jessica owes. Amount of interest = Total debt x Interest rate. Amount of interest = $1,000 x 50% = $500. Therefore, Jessica owes $500 in interest.
Response:  First, we know that Billy has 60 potatoes and he wants to share them equally among his family members. So, if there are n family members, each member will receive 60/n potatoes. Now, we need to find out how many family members Billy has. We can do this by dividing 60 by the number of potatoes each member receives. In other words, we can divide 60 by 60/n. Solving for n, we get: n = 60 / 60/n = 10 Therefore, Billy has 10 family members.
Response:  First, we know that Juanwan charges $3 for lemonade and $2 for sugar. So if someone buys just lemonade, they pay $3. If they buy both lemonade and sugar, they pay $3 + $2 = $5. Now, let's calculate how much money Juanwan makes in total from selling 20 cups of lemonade. If he sells only lemonade, he makes $3 x 20 = $60. If he sells both lemonade and sugar, he makes $5 x 20 = $100. Therefore, Juanwan makes a total of $100 - $60 = $40 from selling 20 cups of lemonade.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of Asian and Japanese runas.  Secondly, we need to subtract the number of Japanese runas from the total number of Asian runas to get the number of Chinese runas. Finally, we need to divide the result by 60 to find out how many groups of 5 runas can be formed.  Here is the calculation: Total number of Asian runas = 240 + 80 = 320 Runas. Number of Japanese runas = 80 Subtracting the number of Japanese runas from the total number of Asian runas gives us the number of Chinese runas: 320 - 80 = 240 Chinese runas. Now, let's divide the result by 60: 240 / 60 = 4 Groups of 5 runas can be formed using the 240 Chinese runas.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the monthly rent of $1/4 of the total rent, which is $150 (1/4 x $600). Next, we need to add the cost of utilities, which is $150 per month (based on the information provided). Therefore, the total monthly expenses for the apartment would be $300 ($150 + $150). Now, let's calculate the daily expenses. There are 30 days in April, so the daily expenses would be $300 / 30 = $10 per day. Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on the apartment for one month as follows: $10 x 30 = $300.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Monicmanta has 4 children and each child eats 10 cups of food. So, in total, Monicmanta's children eat 4 x 10 = 40 cups of food. Now, we are asked to find out how much food Monicqa will have after feeding her 40 cups of food. To do this, we need to subtract the amount of food eaten by Monicmanta's children from the total amount of food available. Therefore, the answer is:  
40 - 40 = 0 cups of food."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lloyd has $10 and he spends $5 on mathematics books every week. So, how much money does he have left after buying the books? We can calculate this by subtracting $5 from $10:  
$10 - $5 = $5  
Therefore, Lloyd has $5 left after buying the books. Now, let's find out if he has enough money to buy the yacht. The price of the yacht is $8, so we need to check if $5 (the amount Lloyd has left) is greater than or equal to $8. We can do this by comparing the two numbers:  
$5 < $8 (true)  
So, Lloyd does not have enough money to buy the yacht."
Response:  Firstly, we know that 3/4 of the votes went to the candidate (chay atipaqqa). This means that 3/4 x 80 = 240 votes went to the candidate. Now, if 240 votes were cast in total, then the remaining 160 - 240 = 80 votes must have gone to the other candidates (kaq clasepi kaqkunaq votota jap'in chayqa). Therefore, the answer is 80.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra has 200 rose stems and she wants to sell them for $5 each. So, if she sells all of them, she will get $1000 (200 x $5). However, Fred tells her that he can only pay $4 per stem, so Sandra would have to sell 250 stems to get $1000 (250 x $4 = $1000). Therefore, the answer is 250.
Response:  First, we know that Jean has $5 and spends $30. So, she has $30 - $5 = $25 left.
"Response:  First, we know that the time it takes to run 400 meters is 55 seconds.  We also know that the time it takes to run 100 meters is 12 seconds.  So, if we want to find out how long it would take to run 400 meters at a speed of 12 seconds per 100 meters, we can multiply the distance by the speed:  
400 meters x 12 seconds/100 meters =?  
We can simplify this calculation by first finding out how many times 100 meters is in 400 meters:  
400 meters / 100 meters = 4  
So, we need to multiply 12 seconds by 4:  
12 seconds x 4 =?  
The result is:  
12 seconds x 4 = 48 seconds  
Therefore, it would take 48 seconds to run 400 meters at a speed of 12 seconds per 100 meters."
Response:  We know that there are 3 squirrels and each has 4 acorns.  So, in total, we have 3 x 4 = 12 acorns.  Now, if we want to find out the probability of getting exactly 3 acorns when we randomly select one from the bag of acorns, we can use the formula for binomial distribution:  P(X = k) = (n choose k) x p^k x q^(n-k), where X is the number of acorns selected, n is the total number of acorns (i.e., 12), k is the number of acorns selected (in this case, 3), and p is the probability of selecting an acorn (which is 1/4 since each acorn has a 1/4 chance of being selected).  Using this formula, we get:  P(X = 3) = (12 choose 3) x (1/4)^3 x (3/4)^9 = 1/8.  Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 3 acorns when we randomly select one from the bag of acorns is 1/8 or approximately 0.125.
Response:  First, we know that there are 20 chickens in total. Second, we know that each chicken lays an average of 5 eggs per day. Therefore, if we multiply 20 (the number of chickens) by 5 (the average number of eggs laid per chicken), we get 100 eggs in total. So, yes, there will be 100 eggs available for sale.
Response:  First, we have to calculate how many animals are in each group of 3 or 6. Then, we will add up all these groups to find out the total number of animals. Finally, we will subtract the number of dead animals from the total to get the final result.  To begin with, let's start with the first group of 3 animals. We know that there are 3 + 3 = 6 animals in this group. Next, we move on to the second group of 6 animals and add them up: 6 + 6 = 12 animals. Now, we need to add the third group of 3 animals: 12 + 3 = 15 animals. But wait! There is one more group of 6 animals left, so we add them too: 15 + 6 = 21 animals. Finally, we subtract the number of dead animals (5) from the total: 21 - 5 = 16 animals. So, there are 16 animals alive in the end.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mandy has taken $100 as loan from Benedict with an interest rate of 2%. Secondly, she has paid back $300 to Benedict, which includes the principal amount of $100 and the interest of $200 (2% of $100). So, the total amount paid back by Mandy is $300. Now, let's calculate how much money Benedict has left after receiving the payment of $300 from Mandy. We can do this by subtracting the principal amount ($100) and the interest ($200) from the total amount received by Benedict: $300 - $100 - $200 = $100. Therefore, Benedict has $100 left after receiving the payment of $300 from Mandy.
Response:  First, we know that Chaypi bought $20 worth of goods from Uj Comerciante. That means she paid him $20. Next, we know that Uj Comerciante sold her $20 worth of goods at a profit of $10 per unit. So he made a total profit of $20 x $10 = $200. Finally, we know that Chaypi spent $2 on transportation costs, so she lost $20 - $2 = $18.
Response:  First, we know that 20 dollars + 25 cents = 20.25 dollars.  Next, we know that 20.25 dollars x 3 = 60.75 dollars. Finally, we know that 60.75 dollars - 4.50 dollars = 56.25 dollars. So, the total cost of three tickets would be $56.25.
Response:  First, we know that Juan has been working for 3 hours (persicata). Next, he took a break of 15 minutes (iskay persajita). So, in total, Juan worked for 3 + 15 = 4.5 hours (uj minutota japʼin). Therefore, there are 4.5 hours left until lunchtime (tantan).
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much food is needed for one person per day. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an average adult needs approximately 2,000 calories per day. Therefore, if we assume that each person in the community will consume 2,000 calories per day, then we can calculate how much food is needed for three people as follows:  
1. Calculate the total number of days for which the food supply is required. In this case, it is 7 days (one week).  
2. Multiply the total number of days by the number of people who will be consuming the food. This gives us:  
Total daily calorie requirement x Number of people = Total daily caloric intake  
For 3 people, the total daily caloric intake would be:  
2,000 calories/day x 3 people = 6,000 calories/day  
Therefore, to sustain 3 people for one week, we would need a total of:  
6,000 calories/day x 7 days = 42,000 calories or 144 pounds (65 kg) of food.  
Now, let's consider the weight of different types of food items and their nutritional value. For example, rice weighs around 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg) per gallon, wheat flour weighs around 2.8 pounds (1.3 kg) per gallon, and lentils weigh"
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of all items. Total Cost = (50 x $10) + (10 x $30) = $500 + $300 = $800. Next, we need to find out how much discount will be given if 30% discount is applied on the entire bill. Discount = Total Cost x Discount Percentage = $800 x 30% = $240. Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount payable. Final Amount = Total Cost - Discount = $800 - $240 = $560. So, the final amount payable for the 10 items would be $560.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 flamenco dancers in total (Suej wasimpi). Secondly, each dancer has 3 costumes (chay pʼunchaypi), so there are 18 x 3 = 54 costumes in total. Thirdly, among these 54 costumes, only 12 are made of pink plastic (manachayqa yuraq plástico flamencos). Therefore, the number of pink plastic flamenco costumes is 12.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Violetta needs 5 colored pencils and she has $20. She spent $2 on one pencil, so she has $18 left. Now, let's calculate how many pencils she can buy with $18:  
$18 / $2 (price of one pencil) = 9 pencils  
So, Violetta can buy 9 colored pencils with her remaining money."
Response:  First, we know that there are 1,200 dollars in total (1,200 x 0.30 = 360). Now, let's calculate how many units of each price there are based on the information given:  For 1 dollar: 1,200 / 1 = 1200 units  For 0.30 dollars: 1,200 / 0.30 = 4000 units So, there are 4000 units of 0.30 dollars and 1200 units of 1 dollar. To find out how many plumes there are in total, we need to multiply the number of units of each price by the corresponding price:  For 0.30 dollars: 4000 x 0.30 = 1200 plumes  For 1 dollar: 1200 x 1 = 1200 plumes Therefore, there are 1200 + 1200 = 2400 plumes in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 40 restaurants and each one has 2 libras of carrots. So, in total, there are 40 x 2 = 80 libras of carrots. Now, if we subtract the 2 libras of carrots that the speaker bought from the market, we get 80 - 2 = 78 libras of carrots left. Therefore, the answer is 78 libras.
Response:  First we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since January 1st, which is the first day of the year. We can do this by subtracting the current date from January 1st.  For example, if today is March 15th, we would subtract March 15th from January 1st to get 8417 (days).  Next, we need to calculate the number of hours that have passed in those days. To do this, we multiply the number of days by the number of hours in a day (24). So for 8417 days, we multiply by 24 to get 196,748 hours.  Finally, we add the number of minutes that have passed in those hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so for 196,748 hours, we add 11,667,720 minutes (60 x 196,748).  Therefore, the total amount of time that has passed since January 1st is 196,748 hours + 11,667,720 minutes = 11,864,468 minutes.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 Pokémon in total. Secondly, we know that some of these Pokémon have already been caught and their names are mentioned in the list. So, to find out how many Pokémon are left to be caught, we need to subtract the number of caught Pokémon from 20. Finally, we get our answer as follows:  
20 - (5 + 3 + 2) = 20 - 10 = 10  
Therefore, there are 10 Pokémon left to be caught."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Markqa has 1,000 words and each word costs $0.05 to publish. So, the total cost of publishing Markqa would be:  
1,000 words x $0.05 per word = $50.00  Therefore, if Markqa earns $50.00 from each publication, then they would need to publish at least 100 issues (50 x 2) to reach their goal of $1,000."
Response:  First, we know that there are 5 pachas (or periods) of 6 hours each in one day, so there are 5 x 6 = 30 hours in total.  Next, we know that there are 5 liters of water needed for each period, so in total, we need 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water.  However, since there is an extra period (the sixth period), we actually need 1 more liter of water, which brings the total to 26 liters.  Therefore, the answer is 26 liters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John has won a prize of $5000 and he will receive 5% of his salary as bonus. So, if John's weekly salary is x dollars, then his bonus will be 5% of x, which is 0.05x dollars. Now, let's calculate the total amount John will receive including his bonus. Total = Prize + Bonus Total = $5000 + 0.05x Therefore, the value of x can be found by solving for x in the above equation. x = $5000 / (1 - 0.05) x = $5000 / 0.95 x = $5313.87 So, John's weekly salary is approximately $5313.87.
Response:  First, we know that there are 10 hectares of grapes (chakranpi) and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes (toneladas). So, in total, there are 10 x 5 = 50 tons of grapes per year.  Next, we know that each ton of grapes can produce 2 barrels of wine (barril vino), so in total, there will be 50 x 2 = 100 barrels of wine produced per year. Therefore, the answer is 100 barrels of wine.

5 x 89 = 445 + 71 = 516 + 92 = 608 + 100 = 708 + 86 = 804  
Therefore, Brinley has a total of 804 points. Now, we are asked if she can get 6 more points by answering one more question correctly. If she does, her new total will be:  
804 + 6 = 810  
So, yes, Brinley can get 6 more points by answering one more question correctly."
Response:  First, we know that Michael has cycled for 5 weeks and covered 25 kilometers per week. So, in total, he has cycled for 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers. Next, we are told that he has cycled for another 60 kilometers during the sixth week. Therefore, his total distance traveled is 125 + 60 = 185 kilometers. Finally, we are asked if Michael has reached the kilometer mark of 200. To find out, let's divide 185 by 2 to get the result:  Yes, Michael has reached the kilometer mark of 200!
Response:  We know that there are 25 pieces of candy in each bag and each piece weighs 40 grams. So, if we multiply 25 by 40, we get... (pause for dramatic effect)...2000 grams! That's right, 2 kilograms or 2000 grams of chocolatey goodness in every bag. And as for your request, Joepa, I'm afraid we can't fulfill it because it would be too heavy to carry around. But hey, at least you'll have plenty of chocolate to enjoy while you're trick-or-treating!
"Response:  First, we know that rose quartz is used to make 4 tortas (torta = 30) and 1/2 kilo of sugar (kilo = 100). So, in total, we have:  
Rose quartz: 4 x 30 = 120 g  
Sugar: 1/2 x 100 = 50 g  
Now, let's see what happens on Tuesday. We need to add 5 more kilos of flour (kilo = 100), so we will have:  
Flour: 5 x 100 = 500 g  
In total, we have:  
Rose quartz: 120 g  
Sugar: 50 g  
Flour: 500 g  
So, yes, there are enough ingredients to make 5 more tortas."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately.  For the first item, the cost is $1200 minus $600, which equals $600.  For the second item, the cost is $6000 minus $600, which equals $5400.  Therefore, the total cost is $600 + $5400 = $6000.
"Response:  First, we know that Saraqa paid $30 for her share of the expenses and Chuspi paid $20. So together they spent $50.  Next, we know that Saraqa gave $5 to each of their neighbors who helped them carry the heavy load. Therefore, she gave a total of $5 + $5 = $10 to her neighbors.  Now, let's calculate how much money Saraqa has left after paying the expenses and giving tips to her neighbors. We can do this by subtracting the amount she gave to her neighbors from the amount she paid for her share of the expenses:  
$50 - $10 = $40  Therefore, Saraqa has $40 left after paying the expenses and giving tips to her neighbors."
"Response:  First, we know that Jerry has 42 cows and he wants to divide them into groups of 3 or 5 cows each. So, let's start with 3-cow groups. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3:  
42 / 3 =?  
What is the result?"
Response:  We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula P = 2(l + w), where l and w are the length and width of the rectangle, respectively. Since we have two sides with equal lengths (the longer ones), we can write P = 2l + 2w. Now, we need to find out what values l and w take in order to obtain the desired perimeters. For the first one, we want to find a rectangle with a perimeter of 1 km, so we set up the equation: 2l + 2w = 1000. Solving for l and w, we get: l = 500 m and w = 500 m. Therefore, the first rectangle has a length of 500 meters and a width of 500 meters. For the second one, we want to find a rectangle with a perimeter of 6 km, so we set up the equation again: 2l + 2w = 6000. Solving for l and w, we get: l = 3000 m and w = 3000 m. Therefore, the second rectangle has a length of 3000 meters and a width of 3000 meters.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of clients that will be served by the company in one year, which is 100 x 12 = 1200 clients. Now, we need to find out how many clients will be served by each of the two branches. Since there are 50 clients per branch, we can say that Branch A will serve 50% of the total clients, i.e., 600 clients (50% of 1200), and Branch B will serve the remaining 40% of the clients, i.e., 480 clients (40% of 1200).
Response:  First, we know that Jerry has 4 minutes to finish his task and he needs to complete it in 4 minutes or less.  If he works at a constant rate (which means he works for all 4 minutes without any breaks), then he can do 1/4 of the task in 1 minute.  So, if the task takes 4 minutes, then 1/4 of the task takes 1 minute.  Now, let's find out how much work Jerry can do in 1 minute.  We are given that there are 3 tasks with different times:  Task A takes 2 minutes, Task B takes 3 minutes, and Task C takes 4 minutes.  Since Jerry has only 4 minutes total, he cannot do all three tasks.  Therefore, he will choose the shortest task, which is Task A.  Task A takes 2 minutes, so Jerry can do 2/4 = 1/2 of Task A in 1 minute.  Similarly, he can do 1/3 of Task B in 1 minute and 1/4 of Task C in 1 minute.  Now, let's add up the amount of work Jerry can do in 1 minute:  He can do 1/2 of Task A + 1/3 of Task B + 1/4 of Task C = (2/6) + (3/9) + (4/12) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12.  Therefore, Jerry can do 7/12 of the total work in 1 minute.  Since he has 4 minutes, he can do 4 x 7/12 = 56/12 = 4 1/2 tasks.  So, the answer is 4 1/2.
Response:  First, we know that Lori has $320 and she spends $32 on a belt, so she has $288 left ($320 - $32 = $288). Next, we know that she pays $8 for a hat, so she has $280 left after buying the hat ($288 - $8 = $280). Finally, we want to find out how much money she will have in total if she buys both the hat and the belt. To do this, we add the cost of the two items together: $8 + $32 = $40. So, Lori will have $280 + $40 = $320 if she buys both the hat and the belt.
"Response:  First, we know that Janeth received $2,000 and paid 10% as commission to the agent. So, the amount she paid to the agent is:  
$2,000 x 10% = $200  
Now, let's find out how much money Janeth has left after paying the commission:  
$2,000 - $200 = $1,800  
Next, we are given that Janeth spent $165 on something else. So, let's subtract this amount from what she had left:  
$1,800 - $165 = $1,635  
Therefore, Janeth has $1,635 left after spending $165."
Response: 1) How many days are there in 7 weeks? 2) How many flowers does each rose bush produce in one week? 3) Can we calculate how many flowers will be produced in total if we multiply the number of flower productions per week by the number of weeks?  Sure! Let's start with Step 1. There are 7 days in one week. Now let's move to Step 2. Each rose bush produces 6 flowers per week. So, if we have 7 rose bushes, they will produce 7 x 6 = 42 flowers per week. Finally, let's go to Step 3 and calculate the total number of flowers that all 7 rose bushes will produce in 7 weeks. We can do this by multiplying the number of flowers produced per week (42) by the number of weeks (7): 42 x 7 = 294 flowers. Therefore, if we have 7 rose bushes and each produces 6 flowers per week for 7 weeks, then we will have a total of 294 flowers.
Response:  First, we know that Harrieta has $21$ and spends $3$ on snacks. So she has $21 - 3 = 18$. Now, let's see how much each of them has after the transaction.  We know that Zack has $18$ and gives $5$ to Harrieta. So he has $18 - 5 = 13$. And Harrieta has $18$.
"Response:  First, we know that Tawa has 251 points and Noemi has 68 points.  Next, we know that Yuri has 10 points more than Noemi, so Yuri has 78 points (68 + 10).  Finally, we know that Brian has 17 points less than Yuri, so Brian has 61 points (78 - 17).  Therefore, the total number of points among all four friends is:  
251 + 68 + 78 + 61 = 498"
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many minutes are in 10 and 5 minutes respectively.  We know that there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:  
10 minutes = 10 x 60 = 600 seconds  
5 minutes = 5 x 60 = 300 seconds  
Now let's add these two amounts of time together:  
Total time = 600 + 300 = 900 seconds  
Finally, we need to convert this total amount of time from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:  
900 seconds / 60 = 15 minutes  
Therefore, the total time is 15 minutes."
"Response:  First, we know that Celine has 90 liters of water in her tank and she wants to fill up Uj's tank, which has a capacity of 120 liters. So, we need to find out how much water Uj will have after filling up his tank with Celine's water. We can start by subtracting the amount of water that Celine has from the total capacity of Uj's tank:  
120 - 90 = 30 liters  
Therefore, Uj will have 30 liters of water left in his tank after filling it up with Celine's water."
Response:  We know that Andy has 90 geraniums and 40 petunias.  To find out if he has enough seeds for both plants, we need to calculate how many seeds he needs in total.  For geraniums, each plant requires 3-5 seeds, so Andy needs 90 x 3 = 270 seeds for his geraniums.  For petunias, each plant requires 4-6 seeds, so Andy needs 40 x 6 = 240 seeds for his petunias.  In total, Andy needs 270 + 240 = 510 seeds.  Since he only has 400 seeds, he does not have enough for both plants.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the advertisement campaign.  We know that the company spent $15,000 dollars on advertising and they want to know if it was worth it.  To do this, we need to calculate the return on investment (ROI) of the campaign.  ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment  Since we don't have information about the gain from the investment, we can't calculate the ROI. Therefore, we cannot determine if the advertisement campaign was worth it or not.
Response:  First, we know that Carlos has $30 and spends $18 on a banana boat ride. So he has $30 - $18 = $12 left.  Next, we know that Benji has $18 and spends $5 on a horseback ride. So he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Therefore, Carlos has $12 and Benji has $13.
Response:  First, we know that Andrew wants to go from New Jersey to Rochester. So, he needs to take a flight from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey to Greater Rochester International Airport (ROC) in Rochester. According to Google Flights, there are approximately 6 flights per day from EWR to ROC. The flight duration is around 1 hour and 20 minutes. Therefore, the total travel time including check-in and security screening would be around 3 hours. However, it's always best to check with the airlines for the most up-to-date schedules and fares.
"Response:  We have 30 cards in total and we want to divide them into groups of 20 cards each. To do this, we can use the division algorithm. First, we will find out how many groups of 20 cards we can make with 30 cards. To do this, we will divide 30 by 20.  

30 ÷ 20 = 1 with a remainder of 10. This means that we can make one group of 20 cards and ten additional cards left over. So, our answer is 1 group of 20 cards plus 10 additional cards. Therefore, the number of groups of 20 cards we can make with 30 cards is 1 + 10 = 11."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of each meal.  For the first burrito, the cost is $6.50 (as stated in the problem).  For the second burrito, the cost is $6.50 + $2 (for the additional ingredients) = $8.50.  Finally, for the third burrito, the cost is $8.50 + $2 = $10.50.  Now, let's calculate the total cost of all three burritos:  
$6.50 x 3 = $19.50  So, the total cost of all three burritos is $19.50."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 360 degrees in a full circle. Secondly, each degree can be divided into 60 minutes. Therefore, if we multiply 360 by 60, we get 21,600 minutes in a full circle. Now, let's consider the time it takes for Kalinda to walk around the circular path once. We know that she walks at a speed of 4 minutes per lap. So, if we divide 21,600 minutes by 4, we get 5,400 laps that Kalinda can walk around the circular path in one day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ashlyn has 120 million pesos to invest and she wants to divide it among three businesses. She plans to allocate 30% of her investment to each business. So, if she invests 30% of 120 million pesos in each business, then she will invest 36 million pesos (120,000,000 x 0.3) in each business. Therefore, the total amount of money Ashlyn will invest in all three businesses is 36 million pesos x 3 = 108 million pesos. Now, let's calculate how much profit Ashlyn can expect from each business based on the percentage of profit she mentioned. For example, for the first business, she expects a 50% profit, so if she invests 36 million pesos, she can expect a profit of 36 million x 0.5 = 18 million pesos. Similarly, for the second business, she expects a 40% profit, so if she invests 36 million pesos, she can expect a profit of 36 million x 0.4 = 14.4 million pesos. And for the third business, she expects a 30% profit, so if she invests 36 million pesos, she can expect a profit of 36 million x 0.3 = 10.8 million pesos. Therefore, the total expected profit from all three businesses is 18 + 14.4 + 10.8 = 43.2 million pesos.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the amount of money that the entrepreneur will have after paying the taxes. To do this, we multiply the profit (20,000 dollars) by the tax rate (10%). This gives us:  
Tax = 20,000 x 0.10 = 2,000 dollars  
Now, let's subtract the tax from the profit to find out how much the entrepreneur will be left with:  
Profit - Tax = 20,000 - 2,000 = 18,000 dollars  
So, the entrepreneur will be left with $18,000 after paying the taxes."

"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of apples in each basket.  There are 50 baskets with 10 apples in each basket, so the total number of apples is:  
50 x 10 = 500 apples.  Next, we need to calculate the number of apple boxes required to hold all the apples.  Since there are 40 apples in each box and we have 500 apples, we can fill:  
500 / 40 = 12.5 boxes.  So, we need 13 boxes to hold all the apples."
Response: 1) We have 36 penguins in total. 2) Each group of three penguins has one puffed up (uj). So we need to find out how many groups of three penguins we can make with 36 penguins. 3) Since each group has one puffed-up penguin, we need to subtract one from each group. Therefore, we will have 36 - 3 = 33 groups of three penguins. 4) Now, let's count the number of penguins left over after forming all these groups. We have 36 penguins and we formed 33 groups of three penguins, so we have 36 - 33 = 3 penguins left over. 5) Finally, we want to know if there are any pairs of penguins among the leftovers. To check this, we can simply look at the last three penguins remaining. If they are not paired, then there is no pair. But if they are paired, then there is a pair. In this case, the last three penguins are not paired, so there is no pair of penguins. Therefore, our final answer is 0 pairs of penguins.
Response: 1) How many days are there in a week? (Answer: 7) 2) How many weeks have passed since the beginning of the school year? (Answer: 3) 3) If each week has 7 days, how many total days have passed since the start of the school year? (Answer: 21) 4) How much time remains until the end of the school year if it lasts for 180 days? (Answer: 159 days).
"Response:  First, we know that there are 20 friends in total and John has 4 friends. So, if we subtract 4 from 20, we get:  
20 - 4 = 16  
Now, we know that each friend has 8 things except for John who has only 4 things. So, if we multiply 16 (the number of friends left) by 8 (the number of things per friend), we get:  
16 x 8 = 128  
Finally, we add the number of things John has to the total:  
128 + 4 = 132  
Therefore, the total number of things all the friends have is 132."
Response:  We know that there are 25 students in total and each student has to choose one of the three activities (A, B, or C). Therefore, we can say that there will be 25 x 3 = 75 possible combinations of activities chosen by the students. However, some of these combinations may not be possible if two or more students choose the same activity. For example, if three students choose Activity A, then there will be no students left to choose Activities B or C. So, we need to subtract the number of impossible combinations from the total number of possible combinations. In this case, we have 75 - (3 x 2) = 75 - 6 = 69 possible combinations of activities chosen by the students.
Response:  First, we know that Johnny has $20 and he spends $10 on something. So, he has $20 - $10 = $10 left.
Response:  First, we know that Joanmanta has 15 apples and gives 3 to Jessamanta. So, Joanmanta has 15 - 3 = 12 apples left. Next, we know that Jessamanta has 3 apples and gives 2 to Maryqa. So, Jessamanta has 3 - 2 = 1 apple left. Finally, we know that Maryqa has 2 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples among them is 1 + 2 + 12 = 15 apples.
Response:  First, we know that there are 1000 students in total and they have to choose between three options (A, B, or C). So, the probability of each option is 1/3 or 33.3%. Now, let's see what we can do with this information. We know that 30% of the students chose option A, which means that 300 students out of 1000 chose option A. This leaves us with 700 students who did not choose option A. Of these 700 students, 3/5 or 60% chose option B, which means that 420 students chose option B (700 x 60%). Finally, we need to find out how many students chose option C. Since 420 students chose option B and 1000 - 420 = 580 students did not choose option B, we can conclude that 580 - 300 = 280 students chose option C. Therefore, the distribution of students among the three options is as follows: Option A: 300 students Option B: 420 students Option C: 280 students
Response: 1) There are 6 people in total (James and John). 2) Each person has 54 items (chuya mikhuynin). Therefore, there are 6 x 54 = 324 items in total.

"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 runas in one swan and each swan has 30 minutes. So, if we have 5 swans, it will be 5 x 30 = 150 minutes. Now, we need to add the time taken by each swan to complete its task. As per the problem, each swan takes 6 minutes to complete its task. So, we can calculate the total time taken by all the 5 swans as follows:  
150 minutes (total time) + (5 x 6) = 150 + 30 = 180 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken by all the 5 swans to complete their tasks is 180 minutes or 3 hours."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason has 1000 minutes of talk time left in his phone plan. Secondly, he spends 15 minutes talking to Patron every day. Therefore, if we divide 1000 by 15, we get approximately 67 days (1000 / 15 = 67). So, Jason can talk to Patron for 67 days straight before running out of minutes.
"Response:  First, we know that Griffin has 24 fritas and Kyle has 5 fritas.  Next, we know that Billy has some amount of fritas, but we don't know how many yet.  Finally, we know that Griffin has 27 fritas in total.  To find out if Ginger has any fritas, we need to subtract the number of fritas that Kyle and Billy have from Griffin's total number of fritas.  So, let's do that:  

27 (Griffin) - 5 (Kyle) - x (Billy) =? 

Since we don't know how many fritas Billy has, we can't solve for x yet. But we do know that the sum of all three amounts must equal Griffin's total number of fritas.  Therefore, we can set up an equation:  

27 = 5 + x +? 

Now, we can substitute the values we know into the equation:  

27 = 5 + x + 24 

Next, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:  

27 = 5 + x + 24 

Finally, we can solve for x by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:  

x = 22 

Therefore, Billy has 22 fritas.  Now, we can substitute this value back into the original equation to find out if Ginger has any fritas:  

27 = 5 + x + 24 

Substituting x = 22, we get:  

27 = 5 + 22 + 24 

Simplifying, we get:  

27 = 29 

True! Ginger has 29 fritas."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 32 snails in total and they belong to two different types of aquariums - 16 from Aquarium A and 16 from Aquarium B. Now, we need to find out how many snails each aquarium has.  Secondly, we know that there are 4 snails in Aquarium A and 8 snails in Aquarium B. So, if we divide the total number of snails (32) by the number of snails in Aquarium A (4), we get:  
32 / 4 = 8  
This means that Aquarium A has 8 snails. Similarly, if we divide the total number of snails by the number of snails in Aquarium B (8), we get:  
32 / 8 = 4  
This means that Aquarium B has 4 snails. Therefore, the distribution of snails among the two aquariums is: Aquarium A - 8 snails Aquarium B - 4 snails"
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost price of one unit of jeans. We know that the cost price is $250 and the quantity is 6 pieces per week. So, the cost price of one piece of jeans is:  
$250 / 6 = $41.67 per piece  Now, let's calculate the total cost of producing one unit of jeans including the cost of raw materials and labor costs. We know that the cost of raw materials is $30 per piece and the labor cost is $11.67 per hour. The number of hours required for production is 4 hours per piece. So, the total cost of producing one unit of jeans is:  
$30 + ($11.67 x 4) = $30 + $46.68 = $76.68 per piece  Next, we need to calculate the profit margin of Jean. We know that the profit margin is 10%. So, the profit margin per piece is:  
$76.68 x 10% = $7.67 per piece  Finally, we can calculate the total profit of producing one unit of jeans as follows:  
Total Profit = Number of Units Produced x Profit Margin Per Unit Total Profit = 5 units per week x $7.67 per unit = $38.35 per week  Therefore, the answer is $38.35 per week."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of all the items purchased. We can do this by adding up the costs of each item: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98. Next, we need to subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final price paid. In this case, the discount is $22, so we subtract that from the total cost: $98 - $22 = $76. Therefore, the final price paid for all the items was $76.
Response:  First, we know that one chaypi (chef) costs $1.50. Next, we are given that there are 50 pounds of cebollas (onions). We need to find out how much each pound of cebollas costs in terms of chaypis. To do this, we can divide the cost of one chaypi by the weight of one chaypi: $1.50 ÷ 1 = $1.50 per chaypi. Now, let's divide the weight of the cebollas by the weight of one chaypi: 50 lb / 1 = 50 chaypis. Therefore, 50 pounds of cebollas cost 50 x $1.50 = $75.
Response:  First, we know that each slice of bread contains 80 calories and there are 5 slices in total. Therefore, the total number of calories from bread is 5 x 80 = 400 calories. Next, we need to calculate the number of calories from the ham and cheese. We know that each piece of ham contains 70 calories and there are 3 pieces in total. So, the total number of calories from ham is 3 x 70 = 210 calories. Now, let's add up all the calories: 400 + 210 = 610 calories. Therefore, the total number of calories in the sandwich is approximately 610 calories.
