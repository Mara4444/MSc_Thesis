To find out how much Jennet earns from selling eggs at the farmer's market each day, we need to subtract the number of eggs she eats for breakfast and the number of eggs she uses to bake cakes from the total number of eggs she lays per day.

Total number of eggs laid per day = 16
Eggs eaten for breakfast per day = 3
Eggs used for baking cakes per day = 4

So, the number of eggs available for sale per day = Total number of eggs laid per day - Eggs eaten for breakfast per day - Eggs used for baking cakes per day
= 16 - 3 - 4
= 9

Since each egg is sold for $2, Jennet earns $2 x 9 = $18 per day from selling eggs at the farmer's market."

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. In Toulouse, there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston.
2. In Charleston, there are four times as many sheep as in Seattle.
3. In Seattle, there are 20 sheep.

We can use this information to set up a system of equations:

Let T be the number of sheep in Toulouse, C be the number of sheep in Charleston, and S be the number of sheep in Seattle.

From point 1, we know that T = 2C.

From point 2, we know that C = 4S.

Now we have two equations and three variables (T, C, and S). We can substitute the value of S from point 3 into one of the equations:

T = 2C
T = 2(20)
T = 40

Now we have the value of T: T = 40.

Next, we can substitute the value of T into equation 1 to find the value of C:

C = 4S
C = 4(40)
C = 160

Finally, we can add the values of C and S to find the total number of sheep in all three cities:

Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 40 + 160 + 20 = 220

Therefore, there are 220 sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together."

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. He then spends 2 hours stuck in traffic (at a constant speed).
3. For the remaining 4 hours, he drives at a speed of 80 miles per hour.

We can start by calculating how far John travels during each segment of his journey:

1. First 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
= 60 mi/h x 3 h
= 180 miles
2. Next 2 hours (stuck in traffic):
Since John is not moving during this time, there is no distance traveled.
3. Remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
= 80 mi/h x 4 h
= 320 miles

Now that we have the distances traveled during each segment, we need to find out how far John is from home after the entire 4-hour period. To do this, we add up all the distances he has traveled:

Total distance = Distance during first 3 hours + Distance during next 2 hours + Distance during remaining 4 hours
= 180 miles + 0 miles + 320 miles
= 500 miles

Therefore, after driving for 4 hours, John is 500 miles away from home."
"Response: 
To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to first determine her total hours worked. She worked 45 hours, which is 40 hours (her regular work hours) + 5 hours (overtime).

Next, we can calculate her regular hourly wage by dividing her weekly earnings by her regular hours worked:

$10/hour x 40 hours = $400

Now, let's calculate her overtime pay:

$10/hour x 5 hours = $50

Finally, we add her regular and overtime pay to get her total earnings for the week:

$400 + $50 = $450

Therefore, Eliza earned $450 for the week."
"Response: 
Let's denote the number of downloads in the first month as x. Since there were 60 downloads in the first month, we know that x = 60.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times greater than in the first month, so we can write:

x + 2(60) = 2(60) + 3x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 120 = 480 + 3x

Solving for x, we find that:

2x = 480

x = 240

So, there were 240 downloads in the second month.

In the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30%, so we can write:

240 - (30% of 240) = 240 - 72

Simplifying this equation, we get:

240 - 72 = 168

Therefore, there were 168 downloads in the third month.

So, in total, there were:

60 + 240 + 168 = 468 downloads over the three months."

"Response: 6 years.
Explanation: The cost of planting the lemon tree is $90. Each year, Carlos will harvest 7 lemons and sell them for $1.50 each, so his annual income from the tree will be:

7 lemons x $1.50 per lemon = $10.50 per year

The cost of maintaining the tree (pollination and fertilization) is $3 per year. Therefore, Carlos's net profit from the tree will be:

$10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year

To break even, Carlos needs to earn enough money to cover the initial investment of $90. Since he earns $7.50 per year, it will take him:

$90 / $7.50 = 12 years

However, Carlos will start earning profits in the second year, since he has already invested $90 in the first year. So, it will take him:

12 years - 1 year = 11 years

Therefore, Carlos will start making a profit from his lemon tree after 11 years."

To maximize profit at the end of the month, the merchant should choose the plan with electronic gadgets for $8000, as it is expected to have a higher growth rate (1.2%) than the jewelry plan ($2,5%). This means that the value of the electronic gadgets will increase more significantly over time, resulting in a higher profit for the merchant.

Numeric answer:
Profit = (Value of Electronic Gadgets after 1 month x Growth Rate) - Cost of Electronic Gadgets
= ($8000 x 1.2%) - $8000
= $960 - $8000
= $7680
Therefore, the profit from choosing the electronic gadget plan would be $7680."

Let's denote the distance traveled by each train in one day as x and y, respectively (x + y = 80). Since both trains travel for two days, their total distances are 2x + 2y.

On the second day, both trains move at a constant speed of 150 miles per day, so we can write:

2x + 2y = 150 + 150

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2(x + y) = 300

Solving for x and y, we find that:

x = 120 miles
y = 60 miles

Therefore, each train has traveled 120 + 60 = 180 miles over the two days."

To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to first calculate her weekly earnings as a teacher and then add her weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach.

Weekly earnings as a teacher = 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week

Weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach = 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week

Annual salary = Weekly earnings x Number of weeks worked per year
= ($700 + $450) x 50 weeks/year
= $1,150 x 50 weeks/year
= $57,500/year

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."

To calculate how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream in 60 days, we need to know how many portions she eats per day and how much each portion costs. Let's assume that Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every evening, so she consumes 30 portions per month (since there are 30 days in May).

Since each box of ice cream contains 15 portions, Cynthia needs to buy 2 boxes per month (30 portions / 15 portions per box = 2 boxes). Therefore, her monthly expenditure on ice cream is:

2 boxes x $4.00 per box = $8.00 per month

Now, let's calculate her total expenditure over 60 days:

$8.00 per month x 2 months = $16.00 (for May)
$16.00 x 2 months = $32.00 (for June)
Total expenditure over 60 days = $32.00 + $32.00 = $64.00"

"Response:  Let's denote the cost of one pair of boots as B and the cost of one pair of high heels as HH (for ""high heels""). We know that Gloria has a budget of $100 for shoes and she is considering two pairs of shoes: boots and high heels. The total cost of both pairs of shoes must be less than or equal to her budget of $100. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

B + HH <= 100... (1)

We also know that the cost of the first pair of high heels is 2 times the cost of the second pair of high heels, so we can write:

HH = 2 x HH... (2)

Substituting (2) into (1), we get:

B + 2HH <= 100

Simplifying, we get:

B + 2HH = 50 + 2HH

Now we need to find the value of HH that satisfies this equation. Since the cost of the first pair of high heels is 33$, we can substitute this value into the above equation:

B + 2(33) = 50 + 2(33)

Solving for HH, we get:

HH = 67

Therefore, the cost of the boots is:

B = 100 - 67 = 33

So, the boots cost $33 and the high heels cost $67."

"Response:  To find the median estimate, we need to first convert each of the three estimates into a numerical value. Let's do that:

1. 80 = 80
2. 20 more than half of 80 = 80 + (20/2) = 80 + 10 = 90
3. 25% more than 80 = 80 + (25/100) \* 80 = 80 + 20 = 100

Now, we have three numerical values: 80, 90, and 100. To find the median, we need to arrange these values in order from smallest to largest:

80, 90, 100

Since there are three values, the median is the middle value, which is:

90

So, the median estimate of how many marshmallows are in the bank is 90."

To calculate how many hours John spends taking care of his dogs in a week, we need to multiply the number of dogs he has by the time each dog requires per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can use this formula:

Total hours spent on dog care = Number of dogs x Time required for each dog x Number of days in a week

In this case, the total hours spent on dog care would be:

Total hours spent on dog care = 10 dogs x 0.5 hours/dog x 7 days/week
= 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his 10 dogs."

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Danah can run at a speed of 4 times faster than walking.
2. She can walk at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
3. She has to spend 2/3 of her time running and 1/3 of her time walking.

Now, let's calculate how far she can go in 6 hours if she spends 2/3 of her time running and 1/3 of her time walking:

Running distance = (6 hours x 4 x 3 miles/hour) / (2/3) = 8 miles
Walking distance = (6 hours x 3 miles/hour) / (1/3) = 2 miles

Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance = 8 miles + 2 miles = 10 miles

Therefore, Danah can cover a total distance of 10 miles in 6 hours if she spends 2/3 of her time running and 1/3 of her time walking."

To determine how many grams of chips you can eat while staying within your daily calorie goal, we need to subtract the number of calories you have already consumed (1800) from your total daily calorie goal (2000). This leaves us with 200 calories remaining.

Since each portion of chips contains 250 calories, we can divide our remaining calories by the number of calories in each portion to find out how many portions we can eat:

200 calories / 250 calories per portion = 0.8 portions

Therefore, you can eat 0.8 x 5 portions = 4 portions of chips, which is equivalent to 4 x 300 grams = 1200 grams."

To find Charlie's pure profit, we need to subtract his costs from his revenue. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Cost per pound of beeswax: $10 (from the fact that he can make 10 conical candles with one pound of beeswax)

Number of candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax: 10

Price at which Charlie sells each candle: $2

Total number of candles Charlie will sell if he makes and sells 20: 20 x 10 = 200 candles

Now let's calculate Charlie's total revenue:

Revenue = Number of candles x Price per candle
= 200 x $2
= $400

Next, let's calculate Charlie's cost:

Cost = Cost per pound of beeswax x Number of pounds of beeswax used
= $10 x 1
= $10

Finally, let's calculate Charlie's pure profit:

Pure Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $400 - $10
= $390

Therefore, Charlie will receive a pure profit of $390 if he makes and sells 20 cone-shaped candles using one pound of beeswax."

R = 2B

We know that the price of red galstuks is 50% more than the price of blue galstuks, so:
Red galstuks cost $1.5B (50% more than $B)

John spends $200 on blue galstuks, so:
$B = $200 / $40 = 5

Now we can find out how much John spends on red galstuks:
$R = 2B = 2(5) = 10

So John spends $10 + $200 = $210 on all galstuks."

To find out how many unoccupied apartments there are in the building, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and then subtract the number that is occupied. Let's start by calculating the total number of apartments:

Total number of apartments = Number of apartments per floor x Number of floors
= 8 x 15
= 120

Now, let's calculate the number of occupied apartments:

Number of occupied apartments = 3/4 x Total number of apartments
= 3/4 x 120
= 90

So, there are 90 occupied apartments in the building. To find out how many unoccupied apartments there are, we simply subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments:

Unoccupied apartments = Total number of apartments - Number of occupied apartments
= 120 - 90
= 30

Therefore, there are 30 unoccupied apartments in the building."

To calculate Mars' annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider two factors: her base pension and her bonus for length of service.

1. Base Pension: If Mars works for the same company for 40 years, she will receive an annual pension of $50,000 per year.
2. Bonus for Length of Service: After 20 years of service, Mars is entitled to a 5% bonus on her base pension. Therefore, if she serves for 30 years, she will receive a 5% bonus on $50,000 (base pension) x 20 years = $100,000 (bonus for length of service).

Total Annual Pension = Base Pension + Bonus for Length of Service

To calculate the total amount Alina paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to first find out how much she paid in the first half of the year and then add that amount to the reduced amount she paid in the second half of the year.

Let's assume that Alina paid $140 per month for the streaming service, so her payments for the first six months would be:

6 months x $140/month = $840

Now, if the streaming company took 10% less money from Alina for the remaining six months, her payments for the second half of the year would be:

6 months x ($140/month - 10%) = $624

Therefore, the total amount Alina paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

$840 + $624 = $1,464"

There were 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and twice as many sapphires as rubies. Let's break down the information we have:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubies: x (where x is the number of rubies)
* Sapphires: 2x (since there are twice as many sapphires as rubies)

We know that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so we can set up an equation based on that:

Rubies = Diamonds - 35

Substituting this into our previous equation for rubies, we get:

Rubies = 175 - 35

Solving for x, we get:

x = 140

So there were 140 rubies in the sunduk.

Now let's find out how many sapphires there were:

Sapphires = 2x
= 2(140)
= 280

Therefore, there were 280 sapphires in the sunduk."

Total number of students = 5 x 15 = 75 (weekdays) + 8 x 15 = 120 (Saturdays) = 195

Price per student = $15

Total revenue for the week = 13 x 195 = $2475

Therefore, Judy earns $2475 in one week."

To calculate the monthly payment for each phone, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

Monthly Payment = (Purchase Price x Interest Rate) / Number of Months

Where:

* Purchase Price is the cost of one phone, which is $150 in this case.
* Interest Rate is the annual rate charged on the purchase price, which is 2% in this case.
* Number of Months is the number of months over which the purchase price is being financed, which is 3 months in this case.

Using these values, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly Payment = ($150 x 2%) / 3
= $3 x 2% / 3
= $6 / 3
= $2

Therefore, Shila will pay $2 per month for each of the five phones she purchased, for a total of $10 per month."

To calculate how many packets of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, we need to divide the number of days in the first 180 days by the number of cups per day. We can do this as follows:

180 days / 1 cup/day = 180 cups

Since Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 2 cups per day after the first 180 days, she will need twice as much dog food during that period. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for the first year is:

180 cups x 2 = 360 cups

Now, we can calculate how many packets of dog food Cecilia will need based on the information given in the problem statement. One packet contains 110 cups, so:

360 cups / 110 cups/packet = 3.27 packets (round up to 4 packets)

Therefore, Cecilia will need 4 packets of dog food for the first year."

If Raymond stirs half as much laundry as Sarah and Sarah stirs 4 times more laundry than David, then the difference between the amount of laundry stirred by Raymond and David is:

(1/2)x - 4(x/4) = (1/2)x - 4x/16 = x/8

where x is the number of pounds of laundry stirred by Sarah.

So, if Sarah stirs 400 pounds of laundry, then:

x/8 = 400

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3200

Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry stirred by Raymond and David is:

(1/2)x - 4(x/4) = (1/2)(3200) - 4(3200/4) = 3200 - 1280 = 2040 pounds."

At $1.00 per 2 flowers:
18 flowers = 9 sets of 2 flowers each = 9 x $1.00 = $9

The difference in cost is:
$15 - $9 = $6

Therefore, Vinson will save $6 by buying 18 flowers at the more advantageous price of $1.00 per 2 flowers."

Question: If James is 10 years old and he is one year younger than Corey, then how old is Jackson?

Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* Emily has four children named Emma, Jackson, Corey, and James.
* Emma is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years older than Corey.
* James is 10 years old and is one year younger than Corey.

From the above information, we can deduce that:

* Emma is 5 + 2 = 7 years older than Jackson.
* Corey is 2 years older than James.

Now, let's calculate the age of Jackson based on the information provided:

* James is 10 years old, so Corey is 10 + 2 = 12 years old.
* Since Corey is 2 years older than James, Corey is 12 - 2 = 10 years old.
* As Emma is 7 years older than Jackson, Emma is 7 + 10 = 17 years old.
* Therefore, Jackson is 17 - 5 = 12 years old.

To calculate the cost of 10 gallons of gasoline after receiving the cashback offer, we need to first find out how much the cashback will be for 10 gallons.

Cashback per gallon = $0.20/gallon
Cashback for 10 gallons = 10 x $0.20 = $2.00

Now, let's add the cost of the gasoline and the cashback amount to find the total cost:

Total cost = Gasoline price x Gallons purchased
= $3.00/gal x 10 gal
= $30.00 + $2.00 (cashback)
= $32.00

Therefore, if you purchase 10 gallons of gasoline at $3.00 per gallon with the cashback offer of $0.20 per gallon, your total cost would be $32.00."

* In each of the next two days, she slept for 2 hours less than on Monday.
* She slept for 1 hour more than in these two days at the end of the week.

We can start by finding out how many hours Seidi slept on Tuesday and Wednesday:

Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
Wednesday: 6 - 2 = 4 hours

Now we know that Seidi slept for a total of 6 + 4 = 10 hours from Tuesday to Wednesday.

To calculate the profit of the hospital from these visits, we need to know the total number of patients visited and the duration of each visit. Let's assume that the average visit lasts for 24 minutes as given in the problem statement.

Total number of patients = 500 (daily) x 60 (minutes/hour) / 24 (minutes per visit) = 833.33 patients per hour

Revenue generated by doctors = 150 $/hour x 833.33 patients/hour = 125,000 $/hour

Revenue generated by the hospital = 200 $/hour x 833.33 patients/hour = 166,667 $/hour

Profit = Revenue generated by the hospital - Revenue generated by doctors

Let's denote the distance traveled by Blake as B and the distance traveled by Kelly as K. We know that:

* Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so his total distance = 2 x 100 yd = 200 yd (since he runs twice)
* Kelly runs once to the 40-yard line and back, so her total distance = 80 yd + 80 yd = 160 yd

Since Blake ran more than Kelly, we can say that:

B > K... (1)

We also know that:

K = 34 (since Kelly runs 34 times)

Substituting this into equation (1), we get:

B > 34

Simplifying, we have:

B > 34

So, Blake has run farther than Kelly by at least 34 yards."

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, the depth of water in the reservoir was 17 feet (given).
* On Tuesday, an additional 7 feet of water was added to the reservoir (given).
* On Wednesday, the depth of water in the reservoir is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday (given).

We can let x be the depth of water in the reservoir on Tuesday. Since the depth increased by 7 feet from Monday to Tuesday, we have:

x = 17 + 7 = 24 feet

Now, we know that the depth on Wednesday is two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday:

x/3 = 24/3 = 8 feet

So, the depth of water in the reservoir on Wednesday is 8 feet."

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Энакин caught x marine stars, y marine horseshoe crabs, and z fish-clovers.
* Локсин caught x - 5 marine stars, y - 3 marine horseshoe crabs, and z + 2 fish-clovers.

We can write this as two equations:

Equation 1 (Энакин):
x + y + z = 10 + 6 + 3

Equation 2 (Локсин):
x - 5 + y - 3 + z + 2 =?

Now we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x, y, and z. Let's do it!

First, let's solve Equation 2 for x:

x = 5 + y + z + 2

Next, substitute this expression for x into Equation 1:

10 + 6 + 3 + y + z + 2 = 10 + 6 + 3

Simplify:

y + z + 2 = 9

Now we have two variables, y and z, so we can solve for one of them. Let's choose z:

z = 9 - y - 2

Substitute this expression for z back into Equation 1:

10 + 6 + 3 + y + (9 - y - 2) = 10 + 6 + 3

Simplify again:

2y + 7 = 18

Solve for y:

y = 9

Now that we have found y, we can easily calculate x and z:

x = 5 + y + z + 2
= 5 + 9 + (9 - y - 2) + 2
= 5 + 9 + 7
= 21

So, Энакин caught 21 marine stars, 9 marine horseshoe crabs, and 3 fish-clovers.

As for Локсин, we know that he caught fewer marine stars and fewer marine horseshoe crabs than Энакин,"

For the third month, the price increases by 20% of the previous month's price, which is:

Month 3:
Price = 24 $ x 1.20 = 28.80 $

And so on...

After 36 months, the price would be:

Month 36:
Price = 28.80 $ x 1.20 = 34.576 $

So, the bag of marbles will cost approximately $34.576 after 36 months, assuming a 20% increase in price every two months."

To calculate how much Jackie will gain by hiring an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to subtract the cost of the accountant's services from the amount she would have earned if she had done the work herself.

First, let's calculate the cost of the accountant's services:

90 $/hour x 3 hours = 270 $

Next, let's calculate the amount Jackie would have earned if she had done the work herself:

35 $/hour x 3 hours = 105 $

Now, let's subtract the cost of the accountant's services from the amount Jackie would have earned:

105 $ - 270 $ = -165 $

So, by hiring an accountant, Jackie will actually lose $165. Therefore, it is not advisable for her to hire an accountant in this case."

Let's denote the age of each bird as follows:
Sally One = S; Gracie Red = GR; Sally Two = ST; Sally Four = SF
According to the problem, we know that:
ST = S + 3 (since Sally Two is 3 years older than Sally One)
GR = 2 x SR (since Gracie Red is twice as old as Sally Red)
SF = ST + 4 (since Sally Four is 4 years older than Sally Two)
We also know that all four birds are the same age, so we can set up an equation based on this fact:
S + GR + ST + SF = 8 + 3 + 2 + 4
Simplifying and solving for SF, we get:
SF = 15
So, the ages of the four birds are:
S = 0
GR = 6
ST = 9
SF = 15"

To calculate how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, we need to first calculate her monthly payments for each debt. Then, we can multiply these amounts by 12 to get the annual total.

For the student loan:
Minimum payment = 300 $/month
Jessica's payment = 1.5 x 300 $/month = 450 $/month (50% increase)
Annual payment = 450 $/month x 12 months = 5,400 $/year

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = 200 $/month
Jessica's payment = 1.5 x 200 $/month = 300 $/month (50% increase)
Annual payment = 300 $/month x 12 months = 3,600 $/year

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = 500 $/month
Jessica's payment = 1.5 x 500 $/month = 750 $/month (50% increase)
Annual payment = 750 $/month x 12 months = 9,000 $/year

Total annual payment = 5,400 $ + 3,600 $ + 9,000 $ = 18,000 $/year"

To calculate how much time Billy will spend preparing the potatoes for the barbecue, we need to multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to clean and cut each one. Let's use the following formula:

Time = Number of items x Time per item

In this case, the number of items is 60 potatoes (since there are 60 carrots in total), and the time per item is as follows:

* Cleaning: 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes (60 potatoes x 1.5 minutes/potato)
* Resection: 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds (60 potatoes x 5 seconds/potato)

Therefore, the total time Billy will spend preparing the potatoes is:

Time = 90 minutes + 300 seconds = 450 minutes or 7.5 hours."

To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to divide the profit by the number of gallons sold. Let's do that:

Profit = 25 $
Number of gallons sold = 20 (since each gallon contains 20 straws)

Now, let's calculate the cost of one gallon:

Cost per gallon = Profit / Number of gallons sold
= 25 $ / 20 gal
= 1.25 $/gal

Since they spend 3 $ on lemons for one gallon, we can calculate the amount of lemons used as follows:

Lemons needed = Cost per gallon x Number of gallons sold
= 1.25 $/gal x 20 gal
= 25 $

Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent 25 $ on lemons."

"Response: 17 seconds (calculation below).

Question: How do you calculate this?
Answer: To calculate the time difference between the two teams, we need to first find out how long it takes for each member of the better-prepared team to run their respective legs. Since they all run at the same speed (55 seconds per lap), we can simply multiply the number of laps by 55 to get the total time for that team's four members:

Total time for better-prepared team = 4 x 55 = 220 seconds

Now, let's look at the other team. We know that each member runs 3 seconds slower than the previous runner, so we can start with the first runner's time and subtract 3 seconds for each subsequent runner:

First runner's time = 60 seconds
Second runner's time = 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Third runner's time = 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Fourth runner's time = 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Since the fourth runner finishes in 51 seconds, we can add up the times for all four members of the worse-prepared team to get their total time:

Total time for worse-prepared team = 51 + 54 + 57 + 60 = 222 seconds

Now we have the total times for both teams. The difference between them is:

Time difference = better-prepared team's time - worse-prepared team's time
= 220 - 222 = -2 seconds

So, the more prepared team will lose by 2 seconds. However, since we are asked for the time difference in seconds, we must round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us:

Time difference = 17 seconds"

Explanation: There are six possible outcomes when Jerry rolls the die:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Among these outcomes, there are three that have an even number of dots (2, 4, and 6). Since Jerry is looking for two consecutive even numbers, the probability of getting two even numbers in a row is 3/6 or 50%. However, since he needs to get at least one even number first, the total probability of getting two even numbers in a row is 3/6 + 3/6 = 6/6 or 100% - 50% = 60%. Therefore, the probability that Jerry will get a larger number than 3 is 60%."

Total number of bricks of straw distributed among all small rodents = 160
Number of cages with mice = 3 (since there are 3 cages with mice)

So, the number of bricks of straw per cage with mice is:

160 / 3 = 53

Therefore, there are 53 bricks of straw in each cage with mice."

To calculate how much Mandy needs to pay Benedict after 3 months with an interest rate of 2% per month, we can use the formula for future value of a single amount:

FV = PV x (1 + r)^n

where:
FV = Future Value (the amount Mandy needs to pay Benedict)
PV = Present Value (the initial amount borrowed, which is $100 in this case)
r = Monthly interest rate (2%/month)
n = Number of periods (3 months in this case)

Substituting the values, we get:

FV = $100 x (1 + 0.02)^3
= $100 x 1.0486
= $104.86

So, Mandy needs to pay Benedict $104.86 after 3 months."

Let's denote the cost of each ticket as x$. We know that they spent 20,25$ in total on tickets and food. So, we can write an equation for the total amount spent:

x + (4.50) = 20.25

Solving for x, we get:

x = 16.75

Now, we know that they spent 16.75$ on tickets and 4.50$ on food. Let's find out how much each friend paid for their share of the expenses. Since they agreed to split the costs evenly among themselves, each friend paid:

16.75 / 3 = 5.58$ per person for tickets
4.50 / 3 = 1.50$ per person for food

So, each friend paid a total of:

5.58 + 1.50 = 7.08$

Therefore, each friend paid 7.08$ for their share of the expenses."

To determine how many pounds of insects ten ducks need in a day, we can use the information that each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week. There are seven days in a week, so:

10 ducks x 7 days = 70 ducks' days (since there are ten ducks)
70 ducks' days x 3.5 pounds/duck/day = 245 pounds of insects per day

Therefore, ten ducks need 245 pounds of insects per day to survive."

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Tom plants 10 trees per year.
* He cuts down 2 trees per year.
* He starts with 50 trees.
* 30% of the trees die every year.

We can use this information to calculate how many trees Tom has after each year:

Year 1:
Tom plants 10 trees and already has 50 trees, so he has 60 trees in total (50 from the beginning + 10 new ones).

Year 2:
Tom cuts down 2 trees, leaving him with 58 trees (60 - 2 = 58).

Year 3:
30% of his trees die, which is 17 trees (58 x 0.3 = 17). So, Tom has 41 trees left (58 - 17 = 41).

Year 4:
Again, 30% of his trees die, which is 12 trees (41 x 0.3 = 12). Now, Tom has 29 trees left (41 - 12 = 29).

Year 5:
This pattern continues for 5 years, so Tom will have 29 - 12 = 17 trees left after Year 5.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom will have 17 trees left."

2. After one month, she collected three times as many cards, so she had 3 x 20 = 60 cards.
3. After two months, she collected fewer cards than she did in the first month, so she had 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. After three months, she collected twice as many cards as she did in the first and second months combined, so she had 40 + (2 x 60) = 40 + 120 = 160 cards.

Therefore, Elayne currently has 160 cards with Pokémon."

To find out how much Mark earns in one week, we need to calculate the total amount he receives from both publishers and then divide it by the number of proposals he edits for each publisher. Let's denote the number of proposals edited for Publisher A as x, and the number of proposals edited for Publisher B as y. We know that x + y = 1000 (since Mark edits a total of 1000 proposals per week). The payment for each proposal edited for Publisher A is $5, so the revenue from Publisher A is 5x dollars. The payment for each proposal edited for Publisher B is twice the payment for Publisher A, so the revenue from Publisher B is 2(5x) = 10x dollars. Therefore, the total revenue for Mark in one week is 5x + 10x = 15x dollars. To find out how much Mark earns in one week, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of proposals he edits for each publisher: 15x / (x + y) = 15x / 1000 = 0.15 cent per proposal. Since Mark edits 1000 proposals per week, his weekly income is 0.15 cent x 1000 = 150 cent."

To calculate the remaining amount of money that Jennet will have after paying back the loan in monthly installments, we need to use the formula for present value of a series of payments. The formula is:

PV = PMT x (1 + r)^n

where PV is the present value, PMT is the monthly payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

In this case, the monthly payment is $165, the interest rate is not given but can be assumed to be constant over the 12 months, so we'll use an annual percentage rate (APR) of 10% as a rough estimate. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12 periods.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

PV = $165 x (1 + 0.10)^(12)

Simplifying and calculating the result using a calculator or spreadsheet software, we find that the remaining balance after 12 months would be approximately:

PV ≈ $13,478.94

So, Jennet will have approximately $13,478.94 left after paying back the loan in monthly installments over 12 months, assuming an APR of 10%."

To calculate the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zach in three years, we need to know their current ages. According to the problem, Harriet is currently 21 years old, so Adrian's age can be found by multiplying her age by 3:

Adrian's age = 21 x 3 = 63

Zach's age can be found by dividing Adrian's age by 2:

Zach's age = 63 / 2 = 31

In three years, each of their ages will increase by one year, so their new ages will be:

Harriet's new age = 21 + 3 = 24
Adrian's new age = 63 + 3 = 66
Zach's new age = 31 + 3 = 34

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zach in three years will be:

Average age = (66 + 24 + 34) / 3 = 124 / 3 = 41

So, in three years, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zach will be 41 years old."

Explanation:

1. Total number of elements in the puzzle = 360
2. Number of elements that Calinda can add per minute = 4
3. Number of elements that her mother can add per minute = Half of Calinda's rate, i.e., 2
4. Time taken by Calinda to complete the puzzle = Total number of elements / Number of elements added per minute
= 360 / 4
= 90 minutes
5. Time taken by her mother to complete the puzzle = Half of the time taken by Calinda
= 90 / 2
= 45 minutes
6. Total time required to complete the puzzle = Time taken by Calinda + Time taken by her mother
= 90 + 45
= 135 minutes
7. Since we are asked for the total time in hours, we divide the total time by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
= 135 / 60
= 9.5 hours

Therefore, it will take Calinda and her mother 9 hours and 20 minutes (9.5 hours) to complete the puzzle."

* Johnny took his salary of $20 and added $10 to it. So, he had a total of $30.
* He invested this amount of money, which tripled it within a year.

So, if Johnny invested $30 and it tripled within a year, then he now has:

$30 x 3 = $90

Therefore, Johnny has $90 after one year."

Let's denote Mary's age as M, Joan's age as J, and Jessie's age as S. We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so M = J - 2. We also know that Joan is five years older than Jessie, so J = S + 5. Finally, we are given that Jessie is 20 years old, so S = 20.

Now we can substitute these expressions into each other to find the sum of their ages:
M = J - 2... (1)
J = S + 5... (2)
S = 20... (3)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
M = (S + 5) - 2
= S + 3

So the sum of their ages is:
M + J + S = S + 3 + (S + 5)
= 2S + 8

Since S = 20, we have:
2S + 8 = 2(20) + 8
= 40 + 8
= 48

Therefore, the sum of their ages is 48."

To calculate how many hours Mike spends writing in one week, we need to know how many letters he receives and how long it takes him to write each letter. Let's assume that he receives 2 letters per week from each of the remaining 3 friends, for a total of 6 letters per week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, and it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page, it will take him 6 x 5 = 30 minutes to write each letter. Therefore, Mike spends 30 minutes x 6 letters = 180 minutes or 3 hours per week writing letters."

To calculate how many minutes Jason has left in the month, we need to subtract the number of minutes he spends talking to his boss and other people from the total number of minutes available to him.

Total minutes available to Jason = 1000 min/month
Minutes spent talking to boss per day = 15 min/day x 30 days = 450 min
Minutes spent talking to others per day = 300 min/day x 30 days = 9000 min

Therefore, total minutes used by Jason = 450 + 9000 = 9450 min

Number of minutes left for Jason = Total minutes available - Total minutes used
= 1000 - 9450
= -8450 min

So, there are -8450 minutes (i.e., minus 8450) left for Jason in the month."

To calculate how much Dijin paid for the makeup services, we need to know the total number of hours she spent getting her makeup done and the cost per hour. We are given that she spent 6 hours each day (for 4 days a week) for 5 weeks, which is a total of:

6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = 1200 hours

We are also given that Grimer Jin charges $250 per hour, so the total amount Dijin paid for the makeup services is:

1200 hours x $250/hour = $300,000

After the discount of 10%, the amount Dijin paid becomes:

$300,000 x 90% = $270,000"

To find out how much each person paid, we need to divide the total cost by three.
Total cost = 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 98

So, each person paid:
98 / 3 = 32

Therefore, Isabelle's parents paid $32 each, and she paid $32 as well."

To find out how much the pounder spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the garlic in pounds and then multiply it by its price per pound.

Total weight = 4 x 50 = 200 pounds
Price per pound = $1.50

Therefore, the total cost is:
$200 x $1.50 = $300"

Sue consumed 4 times more cookies than her sister in Monday and twice as much as her sister in Tuesday. Her sister consumed 5 pieces of cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. If one piece of cookie contains 200 calories, then Sue consumed 4 x (200) = 800 calories more than her sister on Monday and 2 x (200) = 400 calories more than her sister on Tuesday. In total, Sue consumed 800 + 400 = 1200 calories more than her sister."
