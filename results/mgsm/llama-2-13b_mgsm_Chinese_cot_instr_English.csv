"Response:  We know that 珍妮特 (Zhenni) has 16 eggs per day and she eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day. So, she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.  
She gives 4 eggs to her friends as gifts, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.  
She sells each egg for $2, so she earns 9 x $2 = $18 per day from selling eggs."
"Response:  We need to make one piece of clothing that requires 2 pieces of blue fabric and half as much white fabric. So we can start by finding out how many pieces of white fabric we need.  
White Fabric Quantity = Blue Fabric Quantity / 2 
White Fabric Quantity = 2 / 2 
White Fabric Quantity = 1 
So, we need 1 piece of white fabric. Now let's find out how much of each color we need in total. 
Total Blue Fabric Quantity = 2 (pieces) x 1 (meter per piece) = 2 meters 
Total White Fabric Quantity = 1 (piece) x 1 (meter per piece) = 1 meter 
Therefore, we need a total of 3 meters of fabric to make this one piece of clothing."
"Response: 

First, we know that Joey spent $80,000 to buy the house and $50,000 for renovations, so he invested a total of $130,000.

Second, we are told that after the renovations, the value of the house increased by 150%. This means that if the original value of the house was x, then the new value is 1.5x or $150,000 (since 150% of x is equal to 1.5x).

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = New Value - Investment
= $150,000 - $130,000
= $20,000

So, Joey made a profit of $20,000 from his investment in the house."
"Response: 

1. James decides to run 3 times per week.
2. Each time he runs, he does 3 sets of sprints (i.e., 3 x 60 m = 180 m).
3. Therefore, in one week, James runs for a total distance of 3 x 180 m = 540 m."
"Response:  We know that Wanda gives her chickens 3 bowls of mixed feed (containing seeds, yellow mealworms, and vegetables) per day, with each bowl containing 2 cups of feed. This means she gives her chickens a total of 6 cups of feed per day (3 x 2 = 6).

Now, let's consider the size of Wanda's chicken flock. If it has 20 chickens, then she needs to give them a total of 20 x 6 = 120 cups of feed per day.

So, if Wanda wants to add an extra feeding in the evening, she would need to give her chickens an additional 120 / 3 = 40 cups of feed in the evening. Therefore, the answer is 40 cups."
"Response:  We know that the first glass costs $5 and the second glass is 60% of the original price, so it will be:  
$5 x (1 - 0.6) = $5 x 0.4 = $2  
So, the second glass costs $2. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he needs to pay:  
$2 x 16 = $32  
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $32 for 16 glasses."
"Response:  We know that the number of sheep in Tulu is twice the number of sheep in Charles Town, and the number of sheep in Charles Town is four times the number of sheep in Seattle. So we can start with the information that the number of sheep in Seattle is 20.  
Let X be the number of sheep in Tulu (since it is twice the number of sheep in Charles Town). Then the number of sheep in Charles Town is 2X, and the number of sheep in Seattle is 20.  
Now we have three equations:  
1. The number of sheep in Tulu is twice the number of sheep in Charles Town:  
2X = 2(2X)  
2. The number of sheep in Charles Town is four times the number of sheep in Seattle:  
2X = 4(20)  
3. There are 20 sheep in Seattle:  
20 = 2X  
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  
X = 40  
So there are 40 sheep in Tulu, 80 sheep in Charles Town, and 20 sheep in Seattle."
"Response: 
1. The file size is 200 GB, and Kara has downloaded 40% of it, which means she has downloaded 80 GB (40% of 200 GB).
2. Before Windows reboots to install updates, Kara has spent 2 minutes downloading the file (2 GB / minute).
3. After rebooting and installing updates, Kara needs to spend an additional 20 minutes to download the remaining 160 GB (200 GB - 80 GB) of the file.
Therefore, the total time required to download the entire file is:
2 + 20 = 22 minutes."
Response:  We know that John left home at 9 am and drove for 3 hours at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. Then he turned back because he realized he had forgotten something very important at home. He spent 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he arrived home at 1 pm. If he had driven for another 4 hours at an average speed of 30 miles per hour, he would have reached his destination at 5 pm. However, since he only had 4 hours left before reaching his destination, he could drive at an average speed of 80 miles per hour instead. Therefore, he reached his destination at (4 x 80) + 1 = 320 + 1 = 321 miles away from home.
"Response:  We know that Eliza works 40 hours per week at $10 per hour, so her weekly earnings are:

40 hours x $10/hour = $400 per week

We also know that she works an additional 5 hours (45 - 40 = 5), and we can assume that these extra hours are paid at the standard rate of $10/hour as well. So, her total weekly earnings including overtime pay would be:

$400 + (5 hours x $10/hour) = $400 + $50 = $450 per week

Therefore, Eliza's weekly income is $450."
Response:  We know that in the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times. In the second month, the number of downloads tripled, so it was downloaded 180 times (3 x 60). In the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30%, so it was downloaded 60 - 30% = 42 times. Therefore, over three months, the program was downloaded a total of 60 + 180 + 42 = 282 times.
"Response:  We know that Tula bought 3 batches of sweet bread (each for $68), 2 mini paper cup cakes ($80 each), and 6 mini cheese cakes ($55 each). So we can calculate as follows:  
Total cost of sweet bread = 3 x $68 = $204  
Total cost of mini paper cup cakes = 2 x $80 = $160  
Total cost of mini cheese cakes = 6 x $55 = $330  
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $794  
Therefore, Tula spent a total of $794 at the bakery."
"Response: 

Year 1: Carlos plants the tree and spends $90 on it. He doesn't earn any money from the tree yet. So, in Year 1, he has spent $90 but hasn't earned anything.

Year 2: The tree grows and produces 7 lemons. Each lemon is worth $1.5, so Carlos earns $10.5 (7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon). However, he still needs to spend $3 on watering and fertilizing the tree. So, his total income for Year 2 is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Year 3: Again, the tree grows and produces 7 lemons. Carlos earns $14 (7 lemons x $2 per lemon), and he still needs to spend $3 on maintenance. Therefore, his total income for Year 3 is $14 - $3 = $11.

Year 4: By now, the tree should be mature enough to produce more lemons, let's say 10 lemons. At $2 per lemon, Carlos earns $20. He still needs to spend $3 on maintenance, so his total income for Year 4 is $20 - $3 = $17.

Year 5: With a more mature tree, Carlos can expect even more lemons, let's say 12. His income will be $24 (12 lemons x $2 per lemon). After subtracting $3 for maintenance, his total income for Year 5 is $24 - $3 = $21.

Now, let's calculate how many years Carlos needs to wait before he starts making a profit:

Year 1: Spent $90, didn't earn anything
Year 2: Earned $7.5
Year 3: Earned $11
Year 4: Earned $17
Year 5: Earned $21

Looking at the above table, we can see that Carlos starts making a profit after Year 4. Specifically, he starts making a profit of $17 in Year 4.

Therefore, Carlos needs to wait for 4 years before he"
Response:  We know that Melanie sold three-quarters of her vacuum cleaners in the green house and two more in the red house. So she has sold (3/4) + 2 = 7 vacuum cleaners in total. If she still has 5 vacuum cleaners left, then she had 5 - 7 = 8 vacuum cleaners at first.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 students in total, and 20% of them (20/100) choose to study modern dance. That means there are 20 x 20/100 = 4 students studying modern dance.  
Now, we know that 70% of the remaining students (70/100) choose to study ballroom dance. There are 20 - 4 = 16 students left, so the number of students studying ballroom dance is 16 x 70/100 = 11 students.  
Finally, we know that 3% of the remaining students (3/100) choose to study hip-hop dance. There are 16 - 4 - 11 = 1 student left, so the number of students studying hip-hop dance is 1 x 3/100 = 0.03 or 3%. Therefore, the percentage of students who sign up for hip-hop dance is 3%."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the profit of each option separately.  
Option 1 (buying jewelry): Profit = Price x Gain/100 = $5,000 x 2.5/100 = $125  
Option 2 (buying electronics): Profit = Price x Gain/100 = $8,000 x 1.2/100 = $96  
Now, let's compare the two options and find out which one will give us the maximum profit. We can see that Option 1 has a higher profit than Option 2. Therefore, if this merchant wants to maximize his profits at the end of the month, he should choose Option 1 (buy jewelry).  
Maximum profit = $125 (from Option 1)"
"Response:  We know that each train traveled for two days and covered different distances on each day. On the first day, Train A traveled west for 80 miles, while Train B traveled north for 80 miles. Since both trains started from the same place (St. Raphael), we can assume they were at the same location on the first day. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Train A on the first day is also 80 miles. Similarly, the total distance traveled by Train B on the first day is also 80 miles.
On the second day, both trains traveled in the same direction (north) but at different speeds. Train A traveled 150 miles, while Train B traveled 240 miles. Again, since both trains started from the same place, we can assume they were at the same location on the second day. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Train A on the second day is 150 miles + 80 miles = 230 miles. Similarly, the total distance traveled by Train B on the second day is 240 miles + 80 miles = 320 miles.
So, the total distance traveled by Train A over the two days is 230 miles, and the total distance traveled by Train B over the two days is 320 miles."
"Response:  We know that Ms. Gil earns $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as a coach. She works for 50 weeks per year, so let's calculate her total hours worked in each role:

Teacher: 50 weeks x 35 hours/week = 1750 hours
Coach: 50 weeks x 15 hours/week = 750 hours

Now we can multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works to get her total annual income:

Teacher: $20/hour x 1750 hours = $35,000
Coach: $30/hour x 750 hours = $22,500

Adding both amounts gives us Ms. Gil's total annual income:

$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

So, Ms. Gil's total annual income is $57,500."
"Response: 

1. If Claire eats 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, then she eats 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week.
2. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Claire eats 21 x 4 = 84 eggs per month."
Response:  We know that Mary walked at an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the first 4 miles and then at an average speed of 2 miles per hour for the last 2 miles. So, in total, she walked for 6 miles. To find out how long it took her to walk the entire distance, we can use the formula: Total Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is 6 miles, and the speed is (4 + 2) / 2 = 3 miles/hour. Therefore, it took Mary 6 / 3 = 2 hours to walk the entire 12-mile path.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice, and three-fourths of it is water. So, we can calculate the amount of pure orange juice as follows:  

10 L x (3/4) = 7.5 L (pure orange juice)  

Now, we add this to 15 liters of pineapple juice, which has five-sixths water content:  

7.5 L + 15 L x (5/6) =?  

First, let's calculate the total volume of the mixture:  

7.5 L + 15 L = 22.5 L  

Next, we need to find out how much water is present in the final mixture:  

(22.5 L x 5/6) - 7.5 L =?  

Simplifying, we get:  

(22.5 L x 5/6) = 18.75 L  

Subtracting 7.5 L gives us:  

18.75 L - 7.5 L = 11.25 L  

Therefore, there are approximately 11.25 liters of water in the final mixture."
"Response:  We know that 
Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. So if Raymond is x years old now, then Samantha is x - 6 years old. 
We also know that Raymond has a 23-year-old son. So his age at the time of his son's birth was 23 + (x - 6) = 23 + x - 6. 
Now we can set up an equation based on these two statements. Let's call the current age of Samantha ""y"". Then we have:

23 + x - 6 = y + 6... (1)

Also, we know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so we can write:

x = y + 6... (2)

Substituting (2) into (1), we get:

23 + (y + 6) - 6 = y + 6

Simplifying and solving for y, we find that:

y = 27

So Samantha is currently 27 years old. And using (2), we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

x = y + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33

Therefore, Raymond's son was born when he was 33 years old."
Response:  We know that Billy has 8 customers in total. The first three customers each bought one DVD, so they spent $15 in total (one DVD costs $15). The next two customers each bought two DVDs, so they spent $30 in total ($15 x 2 = $30). Therefore, the total revenue from the first five customers is $45 ($15 + $15 + $30 = $45). Since the last three customers did not buy any DVDs, there is no revenue from them. So, the total revenue for the day is $45.
Response:  We know that one candle burns for one hour and melts 2 cm each hour. So if we want to find out how much it will melt in five hours, we can multiply the amount of time by the amount it melts per hour. In this case, we have five hours, so we multiply 5 x 2 = 10 cm. Therefore, the candle will melt 10 cm during those five hours.
"Response:  We know that the discount rate is 75%, so we can calculate the selling price as follows:
Selling price = Original price x (1 - Discount percentage)
= Original price x (1 - 0.75)
= Original price x 0.25
We also know that Kael spent $19.50 on the book, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:
$19.50 = Selling price x (1 + Tax rate)
where tax rate is not given in the problem.
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (original price and tax rate). Can you use these equations to solve for the original price of the book?"
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of these items, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:  

$12 + $5 + $6 + x = $50... (where x is the cost of the pizzas)

We also know that each pizza costs $8.50, so we can substitute this value into the equation:  

$12 + $5 + $6 + 8.5x = $50

Now we can solve for x by subtracting $12 and $5 from both sides of the equation:  

$6 + 8.5x = $45

Subtracting $6 from both sides gives us:  

8.5x = $49

Dividing both sides by 8.5 gives us:  

x = 5

So Marie purchased 5 pizzas."
"Response:  We know that Misha bought 3 pairs of shorts, each pair costs $16.50, so she spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on shorts.  
She also bought 3 pairs of pants, each pair costs $22.50, so she spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on pants.  
Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes, each pair costs $42, so she spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes.  
In total, Misha spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 on all these clothes."
Response:  We know that there are 15 ice creams in each box and she buys 6 boxes. So, in total, she buys 15 x 6 = 90 ice creams. And we know that each box costs $4, so she spends 90 x $4 = $360 on ice cream for 60 days.
"Response:  We know that Henry stopped twice during his 60-mile bike trip. He rode for 20 miles before stopping the first time and had 15 miles left to go when he stopped the second time. So we can set up two equations based on this information:

Equation 1: Distance traveled before first stop = 20 miles

Equation 2: Distance traveled before second stop = 15 miles + (distance traveled after first stop)

We want to find out how many miles Henry rode between the two stops. To do this, we need to solve Equation 2 for ""distance traveled after first stop."" Here's how we can do it:

First, substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

15 miles + (20 miles) =?

Next, simplify the equation:

15 miles + 20 miles = 35 miles

Now we have our answer! Henry rode 35 miles between the two stops."
"Response:  We know that Gloria wants to buy shoes within her budget of $100 and she needs to choose between two pairs of shoes with prices X and 2X, where X is the price of one pair of high-heeled shoes. Since she has already found a pair of high-heeled shoes for $33, we can set up an equation based on this information:  

X + 2X = 100 (since the total cost should be $100)  

Simplify the equation:  

3X = 100  

Divide both sides by 3:  

X = 33  

So, the price of one pair of high-heeled shoes is $33. Therefore, the price of the other pair of high-heeled shoes would be twice as much, or $66."
"Response:  We know that Dylan is 7 years younger than Aaron, so we can write an equation based on their ages:  
Aaron's age = 7x + 11... (1)  
Dylan's age = 7(7x + 11) - 7... (2)  
We also know that the sum of their current ages is 162:  
Aaron's age + Dylan's age = 162... (3)  
Now we have three equations and three variables. Can you solve for x?"
Response:  We know that the total number of guesses is 80 + 20 + 25 = 125. Now we need to find out what the average of these numbers is. To do this, we add all three numbers together and divide by 3: (80 + 20 + 25) / 3 = 125 / 3 = 41.67. So the average of the three guesses is approximately 41.67.
"Response: 

1. Total time spent on caring for all dogs per week = (Number of dogs x Time spent on each dog's daily activities) + (Number of dogs x Time spent on walking each dog)
2. Number of dogs = 10
3. Time spent on each dog's daily activities = 0.5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 3.5 hours/dog/week
4. Time spent on walking each dog = 0.5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 3.5 hours/dog/week
5. Total time spent on caring for all dogs per week = (10 dogs x 3.5 hours/dog) + (10 dogs x 3.5 hours/dog) = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week caring for his 10 dogs."
"Response:  We know that there are 110 coins in total and gold coins are 30 more than silver coins. So we can start by finding out how many silver coins there are.  
Let x be the number of silver coins. Then we have:  
x + 30 = 110... (1)
Now we need to solve for x. Can you do it?"
"Response:  We know that Weston has fewer than 2 pieces of jewelry less than Allen's number, and Allen's number is half more than Raymond's number plus 5. So we can start with the equation:  
Allen = (Raymond + 5) / 2  
Now let's substitute the value of Raymond into this equation:  
Allen = (40 + 5) / 2  
= (45) / 2  
= 22.5  
So Allen has 22.5 pieces of jewelry. Since Weston has fewer than 2 pieces of jewelry less than Allen, Weston has:  
Weston = Allen - 2  
= 22.5 - 2  
= 20.5  
Therefore, Weston has 20.5 pieces of jewelry."
"Response:  We know that Mike played for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. So he scored 4/20 = 0.2 points per minute in the first 20 minutes. In the second 20 minutes, his scoring rate increased by 25%, so his new scoring rate is (1 + 0.25) \* 0.2 = 0.3 points per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in total, we can calculate his total score as follows:  
Total score = (0.2 \* 20) + (0.3 \* 20) = 40 + 60 = 100 points."
Response:  We know that Tri has been eating two cups of yogurt every day and now each cup costs $1.25 instead of $1.50. So he spends $2.50 per day on yogurt. Since there are 30 days in March, Tri will spend $2.50 x 30 = $75 on yogurt for the month.
Response:  We know that John has 13 sets of Legos and each set costs $15. So he has $13 \times 15 = 195$ dollars in total from selling his Legos. He spent $8 \times 20 = 160$ dollars to buy electronic games, so he is left with $195 - 160 = 35$ dollars. Now we need to find out how many sets of Legos he has left. Since he spent $160$ dollars to buy electronic games, he can afford to buy $35 / 20 = 1$ more set of Legos. Therefore, he has $13 - 1 = 12$ sets of Legos left.
"Response:  We know that John runs for 3 days each week and runs for 3 hours on the first day and half of the time on the other two days. So we can start by calculating how long he runs each day:  
Day 1: 3 hours = 3 x 60 minutes = 180 minutes  
Days 2-3: Half of Day 1 = 90 minutes (since he runs for half the time)  
Now let's calculate his total weekly running distance:  
Total distance = Total time run x Speed per minute  
= 180 + 90 + 90 = 360 minutes  
= 360 / 60 = 6 miles/week  
Therefore, John runs approximately 6 miles per week."
"Response:  We know that Dana runs at four times the speed of walking, and her jumping speed is half of running. So if she jumps for 3 miles in one hour, how far can she run in the same time?  
First, we need to calculate how long it takes Dana to walk 3 miles. Since she walks at a fourth of the speed of running, it will take her twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore, it will take her 2 hours to walk 3 miles.  
Now, let's find out how far Dana can run in 1 hour. We know that her running speed is four times faster than her walking speed, so she can run 4 times 2 = 8 miles in 1 hour.  
Therefore, Dana can run 8 miles in 1 hour, and since she has 6 hours to complete the race, she can run a total of 8 x 6 = 48 miles."
"Response:  We know that 

布兰登的 iPhone 手机比本的 iPhone 手机旧三倍。
This means that if 布兰登's iPhone is x years old, then 本's iPhone is 3x years old.

We also know that 苏茜的 iPhone 手机比本的 iPhone 手机旧两倍。
This means that if 苏茜's iPhone is y years old, then 本's iPhone is 2y years old.

Now we need to find out how many times 布兰登's iPhone is older than 苏茜's iPhone. To do this, we can divide the age of 布兰登's iPhone by the age of 苏茜's iPhone:

x / y = (3x) / (2y)

Simplifying, we get:

x / y = 3 / 2

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 6
y = 4

So 布兰登's iPhone is 6 - 4 = 2 years older than 苏茜's iPhone."
"Response: 

Step 1: Calculate the distance from Polly to the center of the dragon's fire range when she throws the golden spear without the blue gemstone.
We know that the distance is 400 feet (given in the problem).

Step 2: Calculate the distance from Polly to the center of the dragon's fire range when she throws the golden spear with the blue gemstone.
Since the distance is three times the previous distance, we can multiply the previous distance by 3:
400 x 3 = 1200 feet

Step 3: Check if the new distance is within the dragon's fire range. We know that the dragon's fire range is a circle with a radius of 1,000 feet. So, we need to check if 1200 feet is within this circle.
Using trigonometry, we can find the distance from the center of the circle to a point on the circle's circumference. In this case, the distance from the center of the circle to Polly's location (when she throws the spear) would be:
distance = sqrt((1200)^2 + (1000)^2) = sqrt(1200^2 + 1000^2) = sqrt(1200000 + 1000000) = sqrt(2200000) = 1570.8 feet

So, Polly can stand at a safe distance of approximately 1570.8 feet away from the dragon while using the golden spear with the blue gemstone to attack it."
"Response:  We know that each apple pie was cut into 8 pieces, so there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple pie in total. Since each guest took some pieces and left some behind, we need to find out how many pieces each guest took.

Let's assume that each guest took x pieces of apple pie. Then, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

x + (5 x 8) = 14

Simplifying the equation:

x + 40 = 14

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

x = 24

So, each guest took 24 pieces of apple pie."
"Response:  We know that each serving of cookies contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in total. So, the total number of calories in one bag is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories today, we can subtract 1250 from 1800 to find out how many more calories you can consume.  
1800 - 1250 = 550 calories Therefore, you can still eat 550 / 250 = 2.2 (or approximately 2) more servings of cookies."
"Response:  We know that Charlie can make 10 sticks of candy per pound of wax and each stick costs $2. So if he sells 20 sticks, his total revenue is:  

Revenue = Number of sticks x Price per stick  
= 20 x $2  
= $40  

We also know that the cost of one pound of wax and the required number of wick cores is $10. So if Charlie uses one pound of wax to make 20 sticks, his total cost is:  

Cost = Number of pounds of wax x Cost per pound  
= 1 x $10  
= $10  

Since Charlie sold $40 worth of candles and had a total cost of $10, his profit is:  

Profit = Revenue - Cost  
= $40 - $10  
= $30  

Therefore, Charlie will have a net profit of $30 from selling 20 sticks of candy."
"Response:  We know that:

1. On Monday (week 1), she wrote 5 blog posts and each took 4 hours to research and write, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing blog posts.
2. On Tuesday (week 2), she wrote twice as many blog posts as on Monday, so she wrote 5 x 2 = 10 blog posts. Since each post takes 4 hours to write, she spent 10 x 4 = 40 hours writing blog posts on Tuesday.
3. On Wednesday (week 3), she wrote one more blog post than on Tuesday, so she wrote 11 blog posts. Each post still takes 4 hours to write, so she spent 11 x 4 = 44 hours writing blog posts on Wednesday.

Therefore, the total time she spent writing blog posts over these three days is:

20 + 40 + 44 = 104 hours."
"Response:  We know that Candice has 80 stickers in her bag and she buys another pack of 10 stickers at a store. So, she has a total of 90 stickers with her. She gives one sticker to each of the 220 cups of coffee she serves, leaving her with 23 stickers left over. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Let x be the number of stickers in the pack Candice bought. (Since there are 10 stickers in each pack)

We know that Candice had 80 stickers before she bought any more, so:

80 + x = 90 (since she has a total of 90 stickers now)

Now we need to find out how many stickers were in the pack Candice bought. To do this, we can solve for x in the previous equation:

x = 90 - 80

x = 10

So, there were 10 stickers in the pack Candice bought!"
"Response:  We know that John bought twice as many red ribbons as blue ribbons, and each red ribbon costs $50% more than each blue ribbon. So if he spent $200 on blue ribbons, how much did he spend on red ribbons?  
Let x be the number of blue ribbons John bought. Then he bought 2x red ribbons.  
Since each blue ribbon costs $40, John spent $200 on blue ribbons:  
$40x = $200... (1)  
Each red ribbon costs $40 + ($40 x 50%) = $40 + $20 = $60.  
So John spent $60x on red ribbons:  
$60x = $200... (2)  
Solving equation (1) for x, we get:  
$40x = $200  
x = 5  
Now solve equation (2) for x:  
$60x = $200  
x = 3  
Therefore, John spent $3 \times 60 = $180 on red ribbons and $5 \times 40 = $200 on blue ribbons."
"Response:  We know that the total length of the metal wire is 4 feet (or 48 inches). We also know that each segment is 6 inches long. So we can start by dividing the total length by the length of each segment:

48 inches / 6 inches/segment =? segments

Do you want to try solving this problem yourself before I give you the answer?"
"Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in total and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is 15 x 8 = 120. Since three-quarters (75%) of the units have people living in them, we can calculate the number of empty units as follows:  
120 - 75% of 120 = 120 - 90 = 30  
Therefore, there are 30 empty units in the building."
"Response:  We know that each chicken lays 252 eggs per day and each egg is sold for $2. So, if we multiply 252 by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week), we get:

252 x 7 = 1,764 eggs per week

If we multiply 1,764 by $2, we get:

1,764 x $2 = $3,528 per week

Therefore, Leroy earns $3,528 per week from his chicken eggs."
"Response:  We know that Tom's boat travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. He starts sailing from 1 pm to 4 pm, which is a total distance of 4 hours x 10 miles/hour = 40 miles. Then he returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour, so it takes him:  
40 miles / 6 miles/hour = 6.7 hours (or approximately 6 hours and 42 minutes) to return."
"Response:   
Firstly, we know that Uli needs to reduce his backpack weight by 15 pounds.  
Secondly, we know that each of his comic books weighs 1/4 pound, and there are 30 of them in total. So, the total weight of all the comic books is:  
30 x 1/4 = 7 1/2 pounds  
Thirdly, we know that each of his toys weighs 1/2 pound, and he has 5 of them in total. So, the total weight of all the toys is:  
5 x 1/2 = 2 1/2 pounds  
Now, let's add up the weights of all the items:  
7 1/2 + 2 1/2 = 9 3/4 pounds  
So, if Uli removes 30 comic books and 5 toys, he will have reduced the weight of his backpack by 15 pounds (9 3/4 - 15).  
Therefore, the number of toys Uli needs to remove is:  
15 / 2 1/2 = 6  
Uli needs to remove 6 toys to reduce the weight of his backpack by 15 pounds."
"Response:  We know that the mechanic charges $60 for repairing a car tire and $40 for repairing a motorcycle tire. On Thursday, he repaired 6 car tires and 4 motorcycle tires, so his total income from Thursday is:  

$60 x 6 = $360 (for car tires) + $40 x 4 = $160 (for motorcycle tires) = $520

On Friday, he repaired 12 car tires, but did not repair any motorcycle tires, so his total income from Friday is:  

$60 x 12 = $720 (for car tires)

Since the mechanic earned more money on Friday than on Thursday, we can say that his total income for both days is:  

Total Income = $520 + $720 = $1,240

So, the mechanic earned an additional $720 on Friday compared to Thursday."
"Response:  We know that each of the two cats had kittens. Little patch (the first cat) had twice as many kittens as the number of adopted kittens, and Trixie (the second cat) had 12 kittens. So we can start by adding up all the kittens born to both cats:  
Little Patch: 2 x (adopted kittens) = 2 x 7 = 14 kittens  
Trixie: 12 kittens  
Total: 14 + 12 = 26 kittens  
Therefore, there are now 26 little kittens in the Doubtfire household!"
"Response: 

1. First, we know that Jie has 30 sticks of candy.
2. Next, we know that Jie ate 2 sticks of candy.
3. So now, Jie has 30 - 2 = 28 sticks of candy left.
4. Finally, Jie wants to pack 2 sticks of candy in each package.
5. Since Jie has 28 sticks of candy left and wants to pack 2 sticks per package, Jie can make:

28 / 2 = 14 packages

Therefore, Jie can make 14 packages of 2 sticks of candy each."
"Response:  We know that Peter spends $7 for each movie ticket and $7 for each bag of popcorn. So if he has $42, how many times can he go to the movies?  
We can start by dividing $42 by $7:  
$42 ÷ $7 =?  
What is the result?"
"Response:  We know that the maximum load of the bridge is 5,000 pounds and the weight of one box is 15 pounds. The total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. To calculate how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the maximum load of the bridge.  

So, we have:

Maximum Load - (Driver + Empty Truck) = 5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245 pounds

Now, let's divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box to find out how many boxes can be loaded:

1,245 / 15 = 83 boxes

Therefore, the truck can carry up to 83 boxes without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge."
Response:  We know that Stephen purchased living supplies online and paid $40.00 for them. The supplier added a 25% service fee, which is $10.00 (25% of $40.00). So, Stephen paid a total of $50.00 ($40.00 + $10.00) for the items. Additionally, he was charged $3.00 for shipping, bringing the final cost to $53.00. Finally, Stephen added a small tip of $4.00, making the total amount he spent $57.00. Therefore, the final price of the living supplies after adding all the extra fees is $57.00.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 clusters of grapes in the grape tree, and each cluster has 20 grapes. So, we can calculate the total number of grapes as follows:

Total number of grapes = Number of clusters x Number of grapes per cluster
= 6 x 20
= 120

In addition to these 120 grapes, there are also 67 scattered grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes is:

Total number of grapes = 120 + 67
= 187

So, there are 187 grapes in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 oranges in total, and we need to find out how many of them are good.

Firstly, we know that 1 orange is bad, so we can subtract 1 from the total number of oranges. This leaves us with 24 oranges.

Next, we know that 20% of the oranges are not ripe, which means we have to subtract 20% of 24 oranges from the total number. In percentage terms, this is equal to (20/100) x 24 = 4.8 oranges. So, we subtract 4.8 oranges from the total number.

Now, we know that 2 oranges are sour, which means we have to subtract 2 more oranges from the total number. Therefore, the final number of good oranges is:

24 - 4.8 - 2 = 17.2

Since we cannot have a fraction of an orange, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us:

17 good oranges

So, there are 17 good oranges in the basket."
"Response:  We know that 珍妮特 (Jenny) bought a necklace for her daughter and paid $500 for the materials and $800 for the craftsmanship. She also paid an additional 10% as insurance for the necklace. So we can write down the equation:  
$500 + $800 + $100 = Total Amount Paid  
where $100 is the amount of insurance she paid. Now we need to find out what the total amount paid by Jenny was. To do this, we can add up all the amounts:  
$500 + $800 + $100 = $2300  
So Jenny paid a total of $2300 for the necklace."
"Response: 
1. If Marry works for 40 years and retires at age 60, she will receive an annual pension of $50,000 starting from age 60.
2. From age 20 to age 60, there are 40 - 20 = 20 years left before retirement. During these years, Mary has the right to receive 5% of her annual pension each year.
3. So, if Mary quits working at age 30, she will have received 20 x 5% = 100,000 in total (10,000 per year for 20 years).
4. Therefore, when Mary quits working at age 30, her accumulated pension fund will be $50,000 + 100,000 = $150,000."
"Response:  We know that Alyssa has subscribed to a streaming service for $140 per year. If the initial payment is made in the first half of the year, then the amount paid so far is half of $140, or $70. Since the fee for the second half of the year is reduced by 10%, we can calculate it as follows:  
$70 x (1 - 0.1) = $63.50  
So, the total amount paid at the end of the year is:  
$70 + $63.50 = $133.50"
"Response:  We know that Sofia has already driven 100 miles since her last fill-up and needs to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill her tank. The capacity of her car's fuel tank is 12 gallons. So we can calculate how far she can drive with the remaining amount of gasoline as follows:  
Remaining amount of gasoline = 12 - 4 = 8 gallons  
Distance she can drive = (8 / 3) x 100 = 267 miles  
Therefore, Sofia can drive approximately 267 miles before running out of gasoline based on her current fuel level and the capacity of her car's fuel tank."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Jim watches TV for 2 hours each week, so in 4 weeks, he will watch TV for 2 x 4 = 8 hours.

Secondly, we know that he spends 1 hour reading books each week, so in 4 weeks, he will spend 1 x 4 = 4 hours reading books.

Therefore, in total, Jim spends 8 + 4 = 12 hours watching TV and reading books in 4 weeks."
"Response: 
1. Each school has two teams (male and female) with five players each.
2. Therefore, the total number of players for all four schools is 8 x 4 = 32 players.
3. In addition to the players, each school also has one coach for each team, so there are 4 x 2 = 8 coaches in total.
Therefore, the total number of people involved in the competition is 32 players + 8 coaches = 40 people."
"Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So we can start with the number of rubies:  
Rubies = Diamonds - 35  
Rubies = 175 - 35  
Rubies = 140  
Now we know the number of rubies and diamonds. We also know that there are twice as many green gems as rubies:  
Green Gems = Rubies x 2  
Green Gems = 140 x 2  
Green Gems = 280  
So, in total, there are 140 rubies, 280 green gems, and 175 diamonds in the treasure chest."
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls in the school and each class has 5 students, so there are 60/5 = 12 classes. Since boys outnumber girls two to one, there must be twice as many boys as girls, or 2 x 60 = 120 boys. Therefore, there are a total of 120 + 12 = 132 students in the school. Each class has 5 students, so there are 132 / 5 = 26 teachers.
"Response:  We know that Beili received $x dollars at first and then received $5 per week for 8 weeks. So she received a total of $5 x 8 = 40 dollars in addition to the initial amount. Therefore, the total amount Beili received is $x + 40. Since Beili received a total of $100, we can set up an equation:

x + 40 = 100... (1)

We also know that Beili received $5 per week, so the initial amount she received can be calculated as follows:

x = 100 - 40... (2)

Now we have two equations and two variables. Solving them simultaneously, we get:

x = 60... (3)

So Beili initially received $60 and then received $5 x 8 = $40, for a total of $100."
"Response: 

First, we know that there are 7 days in a week, and each day has 5 classes (weekdays) or 8 classes (weekends).

Second, we know that each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per day is:

Weekdays: 5 x 15 = 75 students
Weekends: 8 x 15 = 120 students

Third, we know that the tuition fee for each student is $15. So, the total amount of money earned per day can be calculated as follows:

Weekdays: 75 students x $15 = $1,125
Weekends: 120 students x $15 = $1,800

Finally, to find out how much money Zhu Di will earn in one week, we need to multiply the daily earnings by 7:

Weekdays: $1,125 x 7 = $7,925
Weekends: $1,800 x 7 = $12,600

Therefore, Zhu Di will earn a total of $7,925 + $12,600 = $20,525 in one week."
Response:  We know that there are two recipes with different numbers of instructions. The first recipe has 20 steps, and we want to find out how many steps the second recipe has. Since the second recipe is twice as long as the first one, we can multiply the number of steps in the first recipe by 2 to get the number of steps in the second recipe. So, the number of steps in the second recipe is 2 x 20 = 40. Therefore, Kaleigh needs to read 40 instructions to prepare both dishes.
Response:  We know that Tom has sold 43 blocks of brownies and 23 blocks of cheesecake. The price of each brownie is $3, so he has made $43 x $3 = $129 from selling brownies. The price of each cheesecake is $4, so he has made $23 x $4 = $92 from selling cheesecakes. In total, Tom has raised $129 + $92 = $221 for his charity organization.
"Response:  We know that Sally bought 5 phones at $150 each, so she spent a total of $750 (5 x $150). Since she chose a 3-month payment plan with a 2% interest rate per month, we can calculate her monthly payments as follows:  
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months  
= $750 / 3  
= $250 per month  
So, Sally needs to pay $250 per month for 3 months to settle her debt."
"Response:  We know that each potted million-dollar flower costs $2.74, each pot of dwarf cattle flower costs $1.87, and each pot of autumn sea chrysanthemum costs $2.12. If A Tu sells 12 pots of million-dollar flowers, 9 pots of dwarf cattle flowers, and 17 pots of autumn sea chrysanthemums, how much money will he make in total?

First, let's calculate the amount of money A Tu will make from each type of flower:

12 x $2.74 = $33.08 (for million-dollar flowers)
9 x $1.87 = $16.83 (for dwarf cattle flowers)
17 x $2.12 = $35.04 (for autumn sea chrysanthemums)

Total amount of money A Tu will make:
$33.08 + $16.83 + $35.04 = $85.05

Therefore, if A Tu sells 12 pots of million-dollar flowers, 9 pots of dwarf cattle flowers, and 17 pots of autumn sea chrysanthemums, he will make a total of $85.05."
"Response:  We know that each layer of sand has half the area of the previous layer, so we can start with the top layer and work our way down to find the average area of each layer.  
Top layer (4th layer): Area = 16 square meters  
3rd layer: Area = 1/2 x 16 = 8 square meters  
2nd layer: Area = 1/2 x 8 = 4 square meters  
1st layer: Area = 1/2 x 4 = 2 square meters  
Now we have the areas of all layers, let's add them up to get the total area of the castle: Total Area = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square meters So, the average area of each layer is: Average Area = Total Area / Number of Layers = 30 / 4 = 7.5 square meters"
"Response:  We know that in the first 180 days (half a year), Sally needs to feed her puppy 1 bowl of dog food per day, so she will use up 180 bowls in this period.  
Since there are 110 bowls in one bag, Sally will need half a bag for the first six months, which is 55 bags (110/2 = 55).  
After the first 180 days, Sally needs to feed her puppy two bowls of dog food per day, so she will use up 365 bowls in a year (2 x 180 + 180).  
Again, we can divide the total number of bowls by the number of bowls in one bag to find out how many bags Sally will need: 365 / 110 = 3.27 bags (rounded to the nearest whole number, Sally will need three and a fraction of a bag)."
"Response:  We know that Sara's washing capacity is 4 times David's, so if Sara's washing capacity is 400 pounds, then David's washing capacity would be:  
David's washing capacity = Sara's washing capacity / 4  
= 400 pounds / 4  
= 100 pounds  
Now we know that Raymond's washing capacity is half of Sara's, so Raymond's washing capacity would be:  
Raymond's washing capacity = Sara's washing capacity / 2  
= 400 pounds / 2  
= 200 pounds  
Therefore, the difference between Raymond's and David's washing capacities is:  
Difference = Raymond's washing capacity - David's washing capacity  
= 200 pounds - 100 pounds  
= 100 pounds"
"Response:  We know that Vincent can buy either 2 or 3 stems of flowers for $1 or $2.50 respectively. So, if he buys 2 stems, it will cost him $2, and if he buys 3 stems, it will cost him $3. Now, we need to find out how much it would cost him to buy 18 stems.  
If he buys 2 stems at a time, he will have to make 9 purchases ($2 x 9 = $18).  
If he buys 3 stems at a time, he will have to make 6 purchases ($3 x 6 = $18).  
Since both options give us an answer of $18, it is better to buy 3 stems at a time because he will have to make fewer purchases. Therefore, the answer is $18."
"Response:  We know that John took his dog to a beauty parlor and paid $7 times the original price for the service. So we can start with the original price of the service, which is $100.  
If John paid $7 times the original price, then he paid:  
$100 x 7 = $700  
So the total cost of the grooming service was $700."
Response:  We know that two girls each received 24 liters of water, so together they received 2 x 24 = 48 liters of water. Then, one boy received 6 liters of water, so the total amount of water received is 48 + 6 = 54 liters. Therefore, there are 54 - 48 = 6 liters of water left over.
Response:  Firstly, Charlie has 10 sheets of stickers. He buys 21 more from the store, so he now has 10 + 21 = 31 sheets of stickers in total. Then, he receives 23 more sheets of stickers as gifts on his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 sheets of stickers altogether. Next, he gives 9 sheets to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 sheets of stickers left. Therefore, Charlie still has 45 sheets of stickers left after decorating his birthday card with 28 sheets.
"Response:  We know that Alex's weight is four times Grace's weight minus two pounds. So we can start with Grace's weight. She weighs 125 pounds. Now let's find out how much Alex weighs.  
Alex's weight = 4 x 125 - 2 = 4 x 125 = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds. 
So their total weight together would be:
Grace + Alex = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds."
"Response:  We know that each rose bush has 25 roses and each rose has 8 thorns. So we can calculate as follows:  
Number of rose bushes = 3  
Total number of roses = 3 x 25 = 75  
Total number of thorns = 75 x 8 = 600  
Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total."
"Response:  We know that the team played 22 games and won 8 more games than they lost. So we can start by writing down what we know:

W (win) + L (loss) = 22

We also know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:

W = L + 8

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (W and L). Can you use these equations to find out how many games the team won?"
"Response: 

1. The number of pieces of fabric (T-shirts) he has made so far = Total number of vacations x Number of pieces per vacation
2. The total number of vacations he has taken since he was 23 years old = (Current age - Starting age + 1) x Number of vacations per year
3. Therefore, the total number of pieces of fabric he has made can be calculated as follows:
Total number of pieces = (34 - 23 + 1) x 4 x Number of pieces per vacation

Now we need to determine the value of ""Number of pieces per vacation"". Based on the information given in the problem statement, each piece of fabric is made from one sheet of cloth, and there are four sheets of cloth for each vacation. So,

Number of pieces per vacation = 4

Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get:
Total number of pieces = (34 - 23 + 1) x 4 x 4
= 11 x 4 x 4
= 440

Therefore, Jian has made 440 pieces of fabric (T-shirts) over the past 11 years."
"Response:   
1st alarm: 4 times (given)  
2nd alarm: 3 x 4 = 12 times  
3rd alarm: 12 / 2 = 6 times  
Total number of alarms: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times."
"Response: 

First, we know that Sylvia has been working for this company for exactly 5 years as of December last year (i.e., she started working in December 5 years ago). Therefore, her initial salary is $600 per month.

Second, according to the policy, for every employee who has worked for the company for at least 5 years, their annual salary can be increased by 10% each year. So, if Sylvia continues to work for another three years, her annual salary will increase by 10% each year.

Third, since Sylvia works for 12 months a year, her total monthly salary after three years would be:

Year 1: $600 x 12 = $7,200
Year 2: $7,200 x 12 = $8,640
Year 3: $8,640 x 12 = $10,368

Therefore, Sylvia's salary after three years would be $10,368 per year or $864 per month."
"Response:  We know that Marylin's first album sold 10 times as many copies as Harold's album. So if Harold sold x albums, Marylin sold 10x albums. We also know that the total number of albums sold is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  

10x + x = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:  

11x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 11:  

x = 8,000

So Harold sold 8,000 albums."
"Response:  We know that there will be 16 guests in total (including Christina), and each guest will receive 0.75 gift bags (since 1/4 of the invited guests did not attend). So, the total number of gift bags needed is:  

Total Gift Bags = Number of Guests x Number of Gift Bags per Guest  
= 16 x 0.75  
= 12  

Now we need to calculate the total cost of all the gift bags. Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost can be calculated as follows:  

Total Cost = Total Gift Bags x Price per Gift Bag  
= 12 x 2  
= 24  

Therefore, Christina needs to spend $24 on gift bags for her birthday party."
"Response:  We know that each adult dragon eats 10 pounds of dirt sandwiches and half as much for an immature dragon. So if there are 20 mature dragons and 5 juvenile dragons, they will eat in total:  
20 x 10 = 200 pounds of dirt sandwiches  
5 x 5 = 25 pounds of dirt sandwiches  
Total: 225 pounds of dirt sandwiches."
Response:  We know that Maria has three times as many pets as Xin Di, so if Xin Di has four pets, then Maria has three times four = 12 pets in total. Therefore, all three of them together have 4 + 12 = 16 pets.
"Response:  We know that Emily has four children named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, and Corey is 2 years younger than Amy. If James is 10 years old and is younger than Corey by 1 year, we can start building our equation.

Let A represent Amy's age, J represents Jackson's age, C represents Corey's age, and J represents James's age.

From the problem statement, we know that:
A = J + 5... (1)
C = A - 2... (2)
J = C + 1... (3)

Now we have three equations and four variables. Can you solve for the missing values?"
"Response:  We know that Lee completed the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds before Jerry changed his diet and improved his speed by 10%. So we can start with this information:  

Lee's time = 38 seconds  
Jerry's original time = Lee's time x (1 + 10%) = 38 seconds x 1.10 = 41.8 seconds  
Now, if Jerry improves his diet and increases his speed by 10%, he will complete the 400-meter hurdles in:  

Jerry's new time = 41.8 seconds x (1 - 10%) = 41.8 seconds x 0.90 = 37.64 seconds  
Therefore, Jerry needs to complete the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 37.64 seconds after changing his diet and improving his speed."
"Response:  We know that there are 2 times as many cats as dogs and the number of dogs is 60. So, if we let C be the number of cats and D be the number of dogs, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:

C + D = 12... (1) (the total number of pets is 12)

We also know that the ratio of cats to dogs is 2:1, so we can express this as:

C : D = 2 : 1... (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (C and D). Can you use these equations to find out how many cats and dogs there are in the community?"
"Response: 
1. First, we know that there are 2/5 male students, so there are 2/5 \* 200 = 40 male students.
2. We also know that 2/3 of female students are girl scouts, so there are 2/3 \* (200 - 40) = 80 girl scouts among female students.
3. Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 80 = 120 students who are not girl scouts.
So, there are 120 - 40 = 80 female students who are not girl scouts."
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours and James slept for 2/3 of what Harry did. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Harry slept for 9 hours = 9 x 1 (since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes)  
James slept for 2/3 of 9 hours = 9 x 2/3 (since 2/3 is equal to 4/6 or 2/3)  
Now simplify the fraction: 9 x 2/3 = 9 x 4/6 = 36/6 = 6 hours  
Therefore, James slept for 6 hours.  
So, Harry slept for 9 hours, and James slept for 6 hours. The difference between their sleeping time is 9 - 6 = 3 hours."
"Response:  We know that each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes and there are 16 cans in total. So, the total number of tomatoes is:  

16 x 3 = 48 tomatoes

Now we know that Freeda reduced the quantity by half to make the sauce. Therefore, the amount of tomato sauce she made is:  

48 / 2 = 24 cups of tomato sauce

Since each cup of tomato sauce contains 3 tomatoes, Freeda used:  

24 x 3 = 72 tomatoes

Therefore, Freeda used 72 tomatoes to make her famous tomato sauce!"
"Response:  We know that there are 30 cars in total on the highway and 5 of them have exited from the high-speed exit. So we need to find out how many cars were stuck in traffic jams.  
We also know that some cars passed through the traffic jam within the first 15 minutes, so let's call this number x. Then, there would be 30 - x cars left behind.  
Now, we know that 20 cars passed through the remaining 15 minutes, so we can set up an equation:  
x + (30 - x) = 20  
Simplifying the equation:  
2x = 60  
x = 30  
So, there were 30 cars stuck in traffic jams for more than 15 minutes."
"Response:  We know that Mary has 18 pots of plants and each window has 2 pots. So, in total, she has 18 x 2 = 36 pots of plants. If she gives one pot to each of her friends and family members tomorrow, how many pots will she have left?  
Mary will have 36 - 35 = 1 pot left."
"Response:  We know that the total number of times the doorbell rang is 60 + (1/4)x + x = 60 + (1/4)x + 10x = 70x, where x is the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell.
We also know that the second friend pressed the doorbell for 20 times more than the first friend, so the number of times the second friend pressed the doorbell is 20 + x.
The third friend pressed the doorbell for 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell is 10 + 60 = 70.
Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
70x + 70 = 60 + (1/4)x + 20 + 60
Solving for x, we get:
x = 8
So, the first friend pressed the doorbell 8 times, and the other friends pressed it the corresponding numbers of times given in the problem. Therefore, the doorbell rang 8 + 20 + 70 = 98 times."
Response:  We know that Soros has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages. He has already read 15 pages on Monday, so he still needs to read 39 - 15 = 24 pages. Since he has 4 days left, he needs to read an average of 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day.
"Response: 

1. Breakfast: 1 cup of water
2. Lunch: 1 cup of water
3. Dinner: 1 cup of water
4. Before bedtime: 1 cup of water

Total number of cups of water consumed per day = 4 cups

Since John drinks water every day, including weekends, we can calculate his total weekly water consumption as follows:

Weekly water consumption = Total number of cups of water consumed per day x Number of days in a week
= 4 cups/day x 7 days/week
= 28 cups/week

Therefore, John consumes approximately 28 cups (or 960 ounces) of water per week."
Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes for the fog to cover each 3 miles of the city. So if we want to find out how many minutes it would take to cover the entire city, we need to first calculate the total distance of the city. The city is located along the coastline and stretches inland for 42 miles. Therefore, the total distance of the city is: Total Distance = Coastal Length + Inland Length = 3 x (42 - 3) = 3 x 40 = 120 miles To cover the entire city, it will take: Time = Distance / Speed = 120 miles / 10 minutes per 3 miles = 120 / 3 = 40 minutes Therefore, it will take 40 minutes for the fog to completely cover the entire city.
Response:  If Bo-Bo has completed four parts of the puzzle and her mother has completed three parts, then together they have completed seven parts (4 + 3 = 7). So there are still three parts left to complete (1000 - 7 = 993).
"Response:  We know that Amir ate 5 pieces of crackers, and Kodi ate three times as many as Amir. So, if we let X be the number of crackers eaten by Amir, then Kodi ate 3X crackers. In total, they ate 5 + 3X = 8 + 3X crackers. Since the problem states that the total number of crackers is 12, we can set up the equation:  

8 + 3X = 12

Solving for X, we get:

3X = 4

X = 1

So, Amir ate 5 crackers, and Kodi ate 3 x 5 = 15 crackers in total."
"Response:  We know that each box has dimensions of 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches (length x width x height). So, to find out how much space is inside all three boxes, we need to multiply these dimensions together and then add up the volume of all three boxes.  
First, let's calculate the volume of one box:  
Volume = length x width x height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches  
Now, let's calculate the total volume of all three boxes:  
Total Volume = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches  
So, the total volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic inches."
"Response:  We know that Franky watches TV for 7 hours in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one hour of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, he watches three shows with different durations. So let's break it down:  
Monday and Tuesday: 2 x 1 hour = 2 hours  
Wednesday: 3 x (30 minutes/show) = 90 minutes  
Thursday: 1 x 1 hour + 1 x 30 minutes = 1.5 hours  
Friday: 2 x 1 hour = 2 hours  
Total: 2 + 90 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours  
So, Franky watched 3 shows on Wednesday, each lasting 30 minutes."
"Response:  We know that Henry made 110 pieces of biscuits this year and he wanted to make double the number of last year. So, we can start by finding out how many biscuits Henry made last year.  
Last year, Henry made x pieces of biscuits.  
We know that he wanted to make double the number of last year, so he made 2x pieces of biscuits this year.  
Now, let's see what information we have:  
Henry made 110 pieces of biscuits this year (given).  
He wanted to make double the number of last year (given).  
So, he made 2x pieces of biscuits this year (given).  
Now, we can set up an equation based on the information we have:  
110 = 2x (since Henry made 110 pieces of biscuits this year)  
Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:  
55 = x (since Henry made 55 pieces of biscuits last year)  
Therefore, Henry made 55 pieces of biscuits last year."
Response:  We know that the price of gasoline at the local station is $3 per gallon and the cashback app provides $0.20 per gallon as a reward. If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline, they will receive a total cashback of $2 (10 x $0.20). So, after receiving the cashback, the person has spent $3 + $2 = $5 to buy 10 gallons of gasoline.
"Response:  We know that 玛舍勒 (Masha) has 3 water fruit rolls with 14 pieces of fruit in each roll, so she has a total of 3 x 14 = 42 pieces of fruit.  
 similarly, 毕翠克丝 (Pikachu) has 2 water fruit rolls with 24 pieces of fruit in each roll, so she has a total of 2 x 24 = 48 pieces of fruit.  
Since both Masha and Pikachu have eaten all their fruit rolls, they have consumed a total of 42 + 48 = 90 pieces of fruit.  
Therefore, the average number of pieces of fruit consumed by each of them is 90 / 2 = 45 pieces per person."
Response:  We know that the boat is leaking water at a rate of 2 gallons per 10 feet traveled. So if Julie travels 20 feet, she will leak 2 x 20 = 40 gallons of water. Since it takes her 16 seconds to travel 20 feet, we can calculate her speed as follows: Speed = Distance / Time = 20 ft / 16 sec = 1.25 ft/sec. Now we need to find out how much water the boat will have taken in when Julie reaches the shore. To do this, we can use the formula: Total distance = Speed x Time = 1.25 ft/sec x 64 sec = 80 ft. Since the boat was initially 80 feet long and Julie has traveled 20 feet, the remaining distance is 80 - 20 = 60 feet. Therefore, the amount of water the boat will have taken in when Julie reaches the shore is: Water taken in = Leakage rate x Remaining distance = 2 gal/10 ft x 60 ft = 120 gal.
"Response: 

1. Each teacher teaches 2 classes per day, so there are 2 x 4 = 8 classes in total.
2. Each class uses the blackboard 3 times, so there are 8 x 3 = 24 uses of the blackboard per day.
3. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of uses of the blackboard per week is 24 x 7 = 168.

So, the blackboard will be used 168 times per week."
"Response:  If Lean plants 2 flowers every day and it takes 15 days for 5 flowers to grow, then in 15 days, he will have planted a total of:

2 x 15 = 30 flowers

So, after 15 days, Lean will have 30 flowers in his garden."
"Response:  We know that Jamar has 1,800 photos in his phone, and each photo can contain multiple ducks. The number of ducks in one photo is 50 times the maximum number of photos that Bridgette's phone can hold. So we need to find out how many photos Bridgette's phone can hold first.  
We know that Bridgette's phone can hold 6 times as many photos as Jamar's phone. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on this information:  
Number of photos Bridgette's phone can hold = 6 x Number of photos Jamar's phone can hold  
Now we are given that Jamar's phone can hold 1,800 photos, so we can substitute this value into the previous equation:  
Number of photos Bridgette's phone can hold = 6 x 1,800 = 10,800  
Therefore, Bridgette's phone can hold 10,800 photos. Now we can use this information to solve for the number of ducks in one of Jamar's photos:  
Since there are 50 ducks in one photo, we can divide the total number of photos Jamar has (1,800) by 50 to get the number of ducks in one photo:  
1,800 / 50 = 36  
So Jamar has 36 ducks in one of his photos."
"Response:  We know that there are two types of wood planks: 2x4x10 and 4x4x10. The total number of pieces is 10 + 5 = 15 pieces.  
The cost price of each piece of 2x4x10 wood plank is $10, so the total cost is 10 x 10 = $100.  
The cost price of each piece of 4x4x10 wood plank is $16, so the total cost is 5 x 16 = $80.  
Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.  
Now let's find out how much profit Summer can get if she sells all the wood planks. She buys them at a cost price of $180 and wants to sell them for a higher price. If she sells them for $25 per piece (which is 25% more than the cost price), then she will make a profit of:  
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price  
= $25 - $180  
= $180  
So, Summer can get a profit of $180 if she sells all the wood planks at $25 per piece."
"Response:  We know that Katy used 7 tea spoons of sugar and 13 cups of water to make coffee. If she uses a total of 120 tea spoons of sugar and water, we can calculate how much sugar she used in each cup of coffee.  
First, let's convert the number of cups from 13 to a decimal. There are 8 cups in a gallon, so:  
13 / 8 = 1.625 (rounded to two decimals)  
Now, we can calculate the amount of sugar she used per cup of coffee:  
7 / 1.625 = approximately 4.3 (rounded to one decimal)  
So, Katy used approximately 4.3 tea spoons of sugar per cup of coffee. To find out how many tea spoons of sugar she used in total, we can multiply this number by the total number of cups she made:  
4.3 x 120 = 516 (approximately)  
Therefore, Katy used approximately 516 tea spoons of sugar in her entire batch of coffee."
Response:  We know that John bought 3 pairs of shoes for each child, so he bought a total of 3 x 3 = 9 pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $60, so the total amount John paid is 9 x $60 = $540.
"Response:  We know that each container has 5 bicycles, and there are already 2 containers with 5 bicycles each in the first day. So, the total number of bicycles imported on the first day is 2 x 5 = 10.  
On the second day, there were more containers arrived, and the total number of bicycles reached 30. Since all containers have 5 bicycles each, we can calculate the number of containers as follows:  
Number of containers = Total number of bicycles / Number of bicycles per container  
= 30 / 5  
= 6  
Therefore, there were 6 containers imported on the second day."
"Response:  We know that Adrian's total income four years ago was $40,000, and his current salary is 30% higher than it was four years ago. So, if we let A be Adrian's current salary, we can write an equation based on this information:
A = 40,000 x (1 + 0.3)
= 40,000 x 1.3
= 52,000
Now, we know that Leila's current salary is 40% higher than her salary four years ago. So, if we let L be Leila's current salary, we can write an equation based on this information:
L = 40,000 x (1 + 0.4)
= 40,000 x 1.4
= 56,000
Since both Adrian and Leila's salaries have increased by the same percentage, their new salaries will be the same as their current salaries four years from now. Therefore, the total amount of money they will earn in four years will also be the same.
So, the total amount of money Adrian and Leila will earn in four years can be calculated as follows:
Adrian: 52,000 x 4
= 208,000
Leila: 56,000 x 4
= 224,000
Therefore, Adrian's total income four years later will be $208,000, and Leila's total income four years later will be $224,000."
"Response: 

1. If Michael uses 2 sheets of paper per week, that means he uses 2 x 4 = 8 sheets of paper per month (since there are 4 weeks in a month).
2. Since each sheet of paper has 30 pages, Michael uses a total of 8 x 30 = 240 pages per month."
"Response:  We know that Morissey brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so we can start by listing out what she brought:  
Apples: 5  
Oranges: 8  
Now, we know that Keir brought more apples than Morissey, but less oranges. So, let's use ""x"" to represent the number of apples Keir brought, since he brought more than Morissey. We also know that Keir brought half as many oranges as Morissey, so we can write down what he brought like this:  
Apples: x (more than 5)  
Oranges: 4 (half as many as 8)  
Now, we need to find out how many water fruits they brought in total. Since Morissey brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, and Keir brought x apples and 4 oranges, we can add up all their fruit to get the total:  
Total Apples: 5 + x  
Total Oranges: 8 + 4 = 12  
So, the total number of water fruits they brought is:  
Total Water Fruits = Total Apples + Total Oranges  
= (5 + x) + (8 + 4)  
= 13 + x + 12  
= 25 + x  
Therefore, the total number of water fruits they brought is 25 + x."
Response:  We know that Sally slept for 8 hours one day and then slept for only 2 hours each of the next two days because she had tasks to complete. So in total, she slept for 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 hours. If she sleeps for an additional hour each day for the remaining days of the week, she will sleep for a total of 12 + (2 x 5) = 12 + 10 = 22 hours. Therefore, Sally slept for 22 hours during the entire week.
Response:  We know that Roxane can run for 3 hours at a rate of 10 miles per hour, so she can run 3 x 10 = 30 miles in 3 hours. Then, we know that she can run for another 4 hours at a rate of 5 miles per hour, so she can run 4 x 5 = 20 miles in 4 hours. In total, Roxane can run 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours.

"Response:  We know that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and more than 6 fish sausages. So we can start by writing down what we know:  

38 + x (where x is the number of fish sausages) = total number of sausages  

We also know that Dylen has a total of $100 to spend on sausages. So let's write down another equation based on this information:  

$100 / ($2 per chicken sausage) = number of chicken sausages  

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use these equations to find out how many fish sausages Dylan bought?"
Response:  If Amelia made 20 friends after transferring to a new school, and Lily made 50 friends, then together they have made a total of 20 + 50 = 70 friends.
"Response:  We know that the price of each pound of watermelon is three times the price of each pepper. So if we let X be the price of one pepper, then the price of one pound of watermelon would be 3X. 
We also know that the price of one orange is less than the price of one pound of watermelon by $5. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
3X + (10 x 15) = 3X + (5)  
Simplifying the equation:  
2X + 150 = 3X + 5  
Subtracting 3X from both sides:  
X + 145 = 5  
Solving for X:  
X = 49  
So the price of one pepper is $49."
"Response: 

First, we need to calculate the total revenue from all patients seen in one day:
Revenue = Number of patients x Average consultation time x Professional fee per hour (doctor) + Number of patients x Average consultation time x Hospital fee per hour (hospital)

We know that there are 500 patients and each patient has an average consultation time of 24 minutes. We also know that the professional fee per hour for doctors is $150, and the hospital fee per hour is $200. So, let's plug these values into the equation:

Revenue = 500 x 24 x $150 + 500 x 24 x $200
= $60,000 + $120,000
= $180,000

Therefore, the total revenue from all patients seen in one day is $180,000.

Next, we need to subtract the costs associated with providing medical services:
Costs = Total number of patients x Average consultation time x Doctor fee per minute + Total number of patients x Average consultation time x Hospital fee per minute

Using the same logic as before, we can calculate the costs as follows:

Costs = 500 x 24 x $150/minute + 500 x 24 x $200/minute
= $30,000 + $48,000
= $78,000

So, the total costs associated with providing medical services are $78,000.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the costs from the revenue:
Profit = Revenue - Costs
= $180,000 - $78,000
= $102,000

Therefore, the profit from seeing 500 patients in one day is $102,000."
Response:  We know that three-quarters of the seasonal workers (60/4 = 15) quit their jobs after being spat upon by children. Then, we are left with 15 - 10 = 5 seasonal workers who did not quit after being kicked by the children. Therefore, there are 5 seasonal workers remaining in the store.
"Response:  We know that Joseph spent $500 in May and $440 in June ($500 - $60 = $440). So his total expenses for both months are:

3. 两人共同坐了 2 次雪橇，需要 2 x 6 = 12 张门票。
因此，这天他们用掉了 12 + 24 + 12 = 58 张门票。"
"Response:  We know that Walter walked 4 miles on Monday and his distance on Tuesday was 6 times as much as he walked on Monday. So, if we let x be the number of miles he walked on Monday, then the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is 6x. 
We also know that his total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday = Total Distance  
x + 6x + (Wednesday) = 41  
7x + (Wednesday) = 41  
Now we need to find out what Walter walked on Wednesday. To do so, we can subtract 7x from both sides of the equation:  
7x + (Wednesday) - 7x = 41 - 7x  
(Wednesday) = 34 miles  
Therefore, Walter walked 34 miles on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Tom washes his car 4 times a week, and each time he spends $15 on car washing. So, in one year (which has 52 weeks), Tom will wash his car 52 times.  
The total cost of car washing for one year is:  
52 x $15 = $780"
Response:  We know that Bob has 3 times fewer electronic games than Blair. So if Blair has 20 electronic games, Bob will have 20 x 3 = 60 electronic games. However, we are told that Blair lost 5 electronic games before comparing with Bob, so Blair now has 20 - 5 = 15 electronic games. Therefore, Bob also lost 5 electronic games and now has 60 - 5 = 55 electronic games.
"Response:  We know that there are 27 wild animals left in the world and three-quarters of them live in Scotland. Since three-fourths of the Scottish population is female, we can calculate the number of females as follows:  
(3/4) x (27/4) = 18 x 6 = 108  
Therefore, there are 108 female Highland cows in Scotland."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the food items:  
2 x 7.50 (submarine sandwiches) + 2 x 1.50 (packs of cookies) + 2 x 1.00 (pieces of cake) = 16.50 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 21.50  
Next, we need to add the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost: 21.50 x 0.20 = 4.30 So, the final total cost of the order is: 21.50 + 4.30 = 25.80 Now, let's add the additional tip of $5.00: 25.80 + 5.00 = 30.80 Therefore, the total amount that Rachel needs to pay for her takeout is $30.80."
"Response:  We know that Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions and completed each question in 5 minutes. So he spent 8 hours x 5 minutes/hour = 400 minutes on the first test.  
For the second test with 100 questions, we can calculate how long it would take him based on his speed from the first test:  
Time taken for the second test = Time taken for the first test x (Number of questions in the second test / Number of questions in the first test)  
= 400 minutes x (100 / 75)  
= 400 minutes x 1.33  
= 532 minutes  
Since Mark has 6 hours to complete the second test, we can set up an equation:  
532 minutes - 6 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 0  
Solving for the number of unanswered questions, we get:  
532 minutes - 360 minutes = 172 minutes  
Therefore, Mark did not answer 172 questions in the second test."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 blue candies and the number of pink candies is four times the number of blue candies. So we can start with the equation:

P = 4(B)

where P is the number of pink candies and B is the number of blue candies.

We know that B = 12, so let's substitute this into our equation:

P = 4(12)

Now we multiply:

P = 48

So there are 48 pink candies in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for rent, and we also know that 12 of them are automatic transmission cars, which means there are only 8 manual transmission cars left. So, if we divide the number of manual transmission cars by the total number of cars, we can get the percentage of manual transmission cars.

Number of manual transmission cars = 8
Total number of cars = 20

Now, let's calculate the percentage:

Percentage of manual transmission cars = (8 / 20) x 100%
= (8 / 20) x 100
= 40%

Therefore, the percentage of manual transmission cars is 40%."
"Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total. According to the problem statement, the number of worker bees is twice the number of infant bees, and the number of infant bees is twice the number of queen bees. So we can start with the following equation:  
Number of worker bees = Number of infant bees x 2 = Number of queen bees x 2 x 2 = 4 x 2 x 2 = 16  
Therefore, there are 16 worker bees."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Joel spends 2 hours playing video games every day. That means he has 24 - 2 = 22 hours per week for work.

Secondly, his part-time job pays $10 per hour. So, if he works for 22 hours per week, he earns:

22 hours x $10/hour = $220 per week

Now, let's calculate how much Joel can earn in one week if he uses his gaming time to work instead:

2 hours x $10/hour = $20 per day
$20 x 7 days = $140 per week

Therefore, if Joel uses his gaming time to work, he can earn an additional $140 per week, besides his part-time job income of $220 per week. His total weekly income would be:

$220 (part-time job) + $140 (gaming time worked) = $360 per week."
"Response:  We know that all non-food items have a tax rate of 10%. So we need to calculate the total cost of all non-food items first and then add the tax amount.  
Step 1: Calculate the total cost of all non-food items.  
We can see from the problem statement that John bought three non-food items: a light bulb, a cup, and an insect trap. The prices of these items are $3, $3, and $4 respectively. Therefore, the total cost of all non-food items is:  
Total Cost = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10  
Step 2: Calculate the tax amount.  
Since all non-food items have a tax rate of 10%, we can calculate the tax amount as follows:  
Tax Amount = Total Cost x Tax Rate = $10 x 10% = $1  
Step 3: Add the tax amount to the total cost.  
Now we add the tax amount to the total cost to get the final price of all non-food items:  
Final Price = Total Cost + Tax Amount = $10 + $1 = $11  
Therefore, the total cost of all non-food items is $11."
"Response:  We know that Lukas has three clients and is negotiating with five potential clients. Each client requires two bottles of detergent (2 x $2 = $4) and one pack of cleaning cloths ($5). So, the total cost for each client is $4 + $5 = $9.  
Lukas already has three clients, so he has earned $9 x 3 = $27 from them. If he can secure the additional five clients, his weekly income will increase to $27 + $9 = $36. His profit would be $36 - $27 = $9 per week."
"Response: 

First, we know that John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare has 100 trees. So he has a total of 10 x 100 = 1000 trees.

Second, we know that John harvests his olives every 3 months. This means he harvests four times a year (since there are 4 seasons in a year).

Third, we need to calculate how many olives John can harvest per season. Since each tree produces 50 kg of olives per season, and John has 1000 trees, he can harvest a total of 1000 x 50 = 50,000 kg of olives per season.

Finally, since John harvests four times a year, he can harvest a total of 50,000 kg x 4 = 200,000 kg of olives per year."
"Response:  We know that Johnnie has three sets of LEGO blocks: one with 500 pieces, one with more than 500 pieces (three times as many), and one with only one-quarter of the number of pieces in the first set. So we can let x be the number of pieces in the second set (more than 500) and y be the number of pieces in the third set (one-quarter of 500). Then we have:

x = 3(500) = 1500
y = 500 / 4 = 125

Now we need to find out how many pieces Johnnie needs to collect in total. He needs to collect all the pieces from each set:

Total = x + y + z
= 1500 + 125 + z
where z is the number of pieces in the first set (500).

So the total number of pieces Johnnie needs to collect is:

Total = 1500 + 125 + 500
= 2825
Therefore, Johnnie needs to collect 2825 pieces of LEGO blocks in total."
"Response:  We know that in the first 6 hours, there were 30 bees leaving the hive. In the next 6 hours, half of them returned (since they had not yet returned). So, after the first 12 hours, there were 30 - (half of 30) = 30 - 15 = 15 bees left outside.  
In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees left the hive as had already left (i.e., 2 x 15 = 30 bees). Since all these bees had not yet returned, there were now 30 + 30 = 60 bees outside the hive.  
Finally, in the last 6 hours of the day, all the remaining bees (i.e., 60 - 30 = 30 bees) returned to the hive. Therefore, the number of bees returning to the hive during the last 6 hours is 30."
"Response:  We know that the adult ticket price is $12 and the child ticket price is $10. If Bridgette's mother gave the cashier $8, then we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

$12 + $10 = $8 + x (where x is the amount of money Bridgette's mother gave to the cashier)

Combine like terms:

$22 = $8 + x

Subtract $8 from both sides:

$14 = x

Therefore, Bridgette's mother gave the cashier $14."
"Response:  We know that Charlie has 12 friends and James has 4 times as many friends as Charlie. So we can start by finding out how many friends Charlie has:  
Charlie has 12 friends.  
Now let's find out how many friends James has:  
James has 4 times as many friends as Charlie, so he has:  
James has 4 x 12 = 48 friends."
"Response:  We know that Steve lives 3 miles away from school and rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from school and rides his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take for Tim to reach home, we need to divide the distance he needs to travel (2 miles) by his speed (264 feet per minute):  

2 miles / 264 feet/minute = x minutes  

Now, let's calculate how long it will take Steve to reach home. We know that he lives 3 miles away from school and rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute:  

3 miles / 440 feet/minute = y minutes  

Since Steve is faster than Tim, we know that y < x. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:  

y + x =?  

We want to find out how much longer Steve has to wait before Tim arrives home. So, we subtract x from y:  

y - x =?  

Solve for y - x using the values we have found:  

y - x = 3 miles / 440 feet/minute - 2 miles / 264 feet/minute  

Simplify the expression:  

y - x = 3 \* 440 / 440 - 2 \* 264 / 264  

y - x = 1320 - 528  

y - x = 792  

Therefore, Steve has to wait for approximately 792 minutes (or 13 hours and 12 minutes) before Tim arrives home."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 people who ride double-wheeled bicycles and 3 people who ride triple-wheeled bicycles. So in total, we have 5 + 3 = 8 people.  
Each person rides one wheel of the bicycle, so we need to calculate how much each person pays for their share of the wheels. Since there are 3 wheels per bicycle, each person pays $25 x 3 = $75 for their share of the wheels.  
Now let's add up all the amounts paid by each person:  
$75 (from 5 double-wheeled bicycles) + $75 (from 3 triple-wheeled bicycles) = $150  
So the total amount earned is $150."
Response:  If Carl buys 10 packs of cookies and each pack has 6 pieces of cookies, then he will buy a total of 10 x 6 = 60 pieces of cookies. Since each piece of cookie costs $0.10, Carl will pay a total of 60 x $0.10 = $6. So, if Carl uses a $10 bill to pay for the cookies, he will receive $10 - $6 = $4 in change.
"Response: 

Step 1: Dave eats 14 sticks of candy before the seagull takes it away. So there are 14 - 14 = 0 sticks left.

Step 2: The seagull eats half of what Dave ate (half of 14 is 7). So now there are 0 - 7 = -7 sticks left.

Step 3: Three sparrows eat three sticks each, so they eat a total of 3 x 3 = 9 sticks. Now there are -7 - 9 = -16 sticks left.

Step 4: A bear takes two-thirds of what's left (two-thirds of -16 is -10). So now there are -16 - (-10) = -26 sticks left.

Step 5: An ant takes one stick. Now there are -26 - 1 = -27 sticks left.

Therefore, when Dave bought the bag of candy, there were 5 sticks in the bag (since he ate 14 and there were 5 left over for the seagull to take)."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 weeks in one semester and each week has 5 days. So, in total, there are 16 x 5 = 80 days of school time in one semester. Now, let's calculate how many hours Basmo spends in class per day:  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (5 days)  
3 classes/day x 1 hour/class = 3 hours/day  
Total hours spent in class per day = 3 hours/day x 5 days = 15 hours/week  
Since there are 16 weeks in one semester, the total number of hours Basmo spends in class for one semester is:  
15 hours/week x 16 weeks = 240 hours  
Therefore, Basmo spends 240 hours in class for one semester."
"Response:  We know that Bill makes 300 sandwiches per day, each with a length of 4 inches (10 cm). So, in total, he makes 300 x 4 = 1200 inches (3 meters) of sandwiches every day.  
Next, we know that Bill also makes 120 packs of chocolate-covered pretzels per day, and each pack contains 6 pieces of pretzels. Since each piece is 6 inches long (15 cm), the total length of all the pretzels is 120 x 6 = 720 inches (18 meters) per day.  
Finally, we know that Bill produces 60 long bread rolls per day, each with a length of 2 feet (60 cm). Therefore, the total length of all the long bread rolls is 60 x 2 = 120 feet (36 meters) per day.  
Now, let's add up the total length of all the products that Bill makes: 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches (51 meters) per day."
"Response:  We know that there are three types of monkeys in the zoo: macaques, gorillas, and orangutans. The number of each type is given as follows:

* Macaques: 50 individuals
* Gorillas: 30 individuals
* Orangutans: 20 individuals

We also know that each monkey needs a certain amount of bananas per month. Here's the information we have:

* Macaques need 200 bananas per month
* Gorillas need 400 bananas per month
* Orangutans need 100 bananas per month

To find out how many bananas the zoo manager needs to order for two months, we can multiply the total number of bananas needed by each species by 2:

For macaques: 50 x 200 = 10,000 bananas
For gorillas: 30 x 400 = 12,000 bananas
For orangutans: 20 x 100 = 2,000 bananas

Adding up all these amounts gives us a total of:

10,000 + 12,000 + 2,000 = 24,000 bananas

So, the zoo manager needs to order 24,000 bananas for two months to feed all the monkeys."
"Response: 

Step 1: We know that Blake ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran a total distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters.

Step 2: We also know that Kayla ran back and forth once, then she ran to the 40-yard line and returned, so she ran a total distance of (1 + 40) x 100 = 410 meters.

Step 3: To find out who ran farther, we need to compare the distances they covered. In this case, Blake ran 1500 meters, while Kayla ran 410 meters. Therefore, the winner is Blake, as he ran significantly farther than Kayla."
"Response:  We know that Rafael bought four pens for $6 (4 x $1.5 = $6), two notebooks for $8 (2 x $4 = $8), and one ream of paper for $20. So in total, he spent:

$6 + $8 + $20 = $34

Therefore, Rafael spent $34 on all the school supplies."
"Response: 

Step 1: We know that there are 11 tadpoles in total.

Step 2: 6 tadpoles swam out from under the lily pads.

Step 3: 2 tadpoles hid under the stones.

Now we need to find out how many tadpoles are left in the pool. To do this, we subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the stones (2) from the total number of tadpoles (11).

11 - 2 = 9

Therefore, there are 9 tadpoles left in the pool."
"Response: 

Day 1 (Monday): Water depth is 17 feet.

Day 2 (Tuesday): Water depth increases by 7 feet, so it becomes:

17 + 7 = 24 feet deep

Day 3 (Wednesday): Water depth is three-fourth of the previous day's water depth, which is:

24 x 3/4 = 18 feet deep

Therefore, the water in the tank is 18 feet deep on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Anan and Loki caught fish together. So we can start with the total number of fish they caught.

Total fish = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's see how many fish each person caught. Since Anan caught more sea stars than Loki, we'll start with Anan's catch.

Anan's catch = 10 (sea stars) + 3 (small fish) = 13

Loki's catch = 5 (sea stars) + 2 (sea horses) = 7

So, in total, Anan caught 13 fish, and Loki caught 7 fish."
"Response:  We know that the price of one bag of marble increases by 20% every two months. So if we want to find out how much one bag of marble will cost after 36 months (which is equal to 18 two-month periods), we need to calculate the price of one bag of marble for each period and then add them up.  
First, let's determine the initial price of one bag of marble: $20.  
Now, let's calculate the price of one bag of marble for the first two-month period:  
$20 x 1.20 = $24  
So, the price of one bag of marble for the first two-month period is $24.  
Next, let's calculate the price of one bag of marble for the second two-month period:  
$24 x 1.20 = $28.80  
So, the price of one bag of marble for the second two-month period is $28.80.  
We can continue this process until we reach the 36th month. Here are the prices for each two-month period:  
Month 1: $24  
Month 2: $28.80  
Month 3: $33.60  
Month 4: $40.32  
...  
Month 18: $75.92  
Month 19: $86.72  
Month 20: $98.54  
Month 21: $111.36  
Month 22: $124.20  
Month 23: $137.04  
Month 24: $150.88  
Month 25: $164.72  
Month 26: $178.56  
Month 27: $192.38  
Month 28: $206.20  
Month 29: $220.02  
Month 30: $233.84  
Month 31: $247.66  "
"Response:  We know that the total value of all toys is equal to the price of one doll, which is $3. So we can set up an equation as follows:

5 red toy cars x $4 = 3 play figures x $5 + 1 doll x $3

Simplifying the equation:

20 x $4 = 15 x $5 + 3 x $3

Solving for the total value of all toys:

20 x $4 = 75

Therefore, the total value of all toys is $75."
"Response:   
1. Calculate the hourly loss of income if she handles tax matters herself:  
3 hours x $35 per hour = $105 lost income per day  
2. Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant:  
$90 per month (assuming 4 weeks in a month)  
3. Calculate the total amount earned if she hires an accountant:  
($105 - $90) x 30 days = $3150  
Therefore, by hiring an accountant, she can earn an additional $3150 per month, which is more than the $105 lost income per day from handling tax matters herself."
"Response:  We know that Ai Wen has a budget of €1,500 and she spent €1,090 on the computer, €157 on the scanner, €74 on the CD burner, and €102 on the printer. So we can calculate how much money she has left for clothes as follows:  
€1,500 - €1,090 = €410 (money spent on computer)  
€410 - €157 = €253 (money spent on other devices)  
€253 - €74 = €179 (money left for clothes)  
Therefore, Ai Wen has €179 left to spend on clothes."
Response:  We know that each Spanish omelette requires 3 eggs and Sandra needs to make 15 of them for her school fundraising activity. Since she gets 9 eggs from her neighbor every time she babysits their daughter, she will need to babysit at least 5 times (15 / 3 = 5) to collect enough eggs for the omelettes. Therefore, Sandra must babysit 5 times as a temporary nanny.
"Response:  We know that Seth is twice Brook's age, so we can write an equation based on this information:
S = 2B
where S is Seth's age and B is Brook's age.
We also know that two years from now, their ages will add up to 28:
S + B + 2 = 28
Now we have two equations and two variables. Can you solve for S?"
Response:  We know that Jimmy has twice as much money as Esser. So if Esser has $8, then Jimmy has $8 x 2 = $16.
"Response:  We know that Pancho walks 20 miles per day from Monday to Friday (5 days). On weekends, he only walks for 10 miles. So, in total, how many miles does Pancho walk in one week?  
Monday - Friday: 20 miles/day x 5 days = 100 miles  
Weekend: 10 miles x 2 days = 20 miles  
Total distance walked in one week = 100 + 20 = 120 miles"
"Response:  We know that each set of uniforms consists of a hat, an outerwear, and long pants. The price of each hat is $25, and we want to find out how much one complete set of uniforms costs.  
Firstly, let's calculate the cost of one outerwear. Since its price is three times the price of a hat, we can write:  
Outerwear = 3 x Hat = 3 x $25 = $75  
Now, let's calculate the cost of one pair of long pants. We know that its price is equal to the average of the prices of the hat and the outerwear:  
Long Pants = (Hat + Outerwear) / 2 = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $62.50  
Therefore, the total cost of one complete set of uniforms is:  
Total Cost = Hat + Outerwear + Long Pants = $25 + $75 + $62.50 = $162.50"
Response:  We know that each spider has 8 legs, so if there are 80 spiders, then there are 80 x 8 = 640 legs from the spiders. Each insect has 6 legs, so if there are 90 insects, then there are 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. Finally, each rare mutant animal has 10 legs, so if there are 3 such animals, then there are 3 x 10 = 30 legs from these animals. In total, we have 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.
"Response:  We know that Sally II is 3 years old and Sally IV is twice as old as Sally III. So we can start with these two pieces of information.

Sally III is 3 + x years old (x is the unknown number)
Sally IV is 2(3+x) = 2(3) + 2x = 6 + 2x years old

Now we are given that all four birds together are 40 years old. So let's add up their ages:

Sally I (10) + Sally II (3) + Sally III (3 + x) + Sally IV (6 + 2x) = 40

Simplify the equation:

10 + 3 + (3 + x) + (6 + 2x) = 40

Combine like terms:

19 + 3 + x + 6 + 2x = 40

Solve for x:

x = 15

So Sally III is 3 + 15 = 18 years old, and Sally IV is 6 + 15 = 21 years old. The total age of the four birds is:

10 + 3 + 18 + 21 = 42

Therefore, there are 42 years among the four birds."
"Response:  We know that Jessica has three types of debts with different minimum monthly repayment amounts: student loans ($300), credit cards ($200), and mortgage ($500). To calculate how much she needs to pay each month to clear her debts within one year, we can use the following formula:  
Total Monthly Payment = (Student Loan Minimum Repayment + Credit Card Minimum Repayment + Mortgage Minimum Repayment) x 1.5 (to account for the 50% extra payment)  
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  
Total Monthly Payment = ($300 + $200 + $500) x 1.5 = $1,000 x 1.5 = $1,500 per month.  
Therefore, if Jessica wants to clear all her debts within one year by paying an additional 50% of the minimum repayment amount, she needs to pay $1,500 per month."
"Response: 
1. Preparing all the potatoes takes x minutes.
2. Each potato needs to be peeled and cut, so we need to calculate how long it takes for each task.
3. Peeling one potato takes 1/2 minute (since there are 60 potatoes, this adds up to 30 minutes).
4. Cutting one potato takes 5 seconds (again, since there are 60 potatoes, this adds up to 300 seconds or 5 minutes).
Now let's add up the total time needed to prepare all the potatoes:
x = 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.
Therefore, preparing all the potatoes will take approximately 35 minutes."
"Response:  We know that they sell each cup for $0.50 and make a profit of $25 per gallon. So we can start with this information to find out how much money they spend on lemons and sugar.  
1) First, let's calculate the total amount of money they earn from selling all 20 cups in one gallon: 
$0.50 x 20 = $10  
2) Now, let's subtract the cost of ingredients (lemons + sugar):  
$10 - ($3 + $2) = $10 - $5 = $5  
So, their profit is $5 per gallon.  
3) Since they want to make a profit of $25 per gallon, we need to increase the price of each gallon by $25 - $5 = $20.  
4) Therefore, they should charge $20 x 20 = $400 per gallon to break even.  
Now, let's check if they have enough profit to cover the cost of lemons and sugar:  
$400 - ($3 x 3 + $2 x 2) = $400 - $9 - $4 = $366  
Yes! They do have enough profit to cover the cost of ingredients.  
Finally, we can solve for the cost of lemons and sugar:  
$366 / ($3 + $2) = $366 / $5 = $73  
Therefore, they spent approximately $73 on lemons and sugar to make one gallon of lemonade."
"Response:  We know that there are 80 Japanese participants and 60 male Chinese team members. So, if we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants (240), we get:  

240 - 80 = 160  

Now, let's divide the remaining number of participants (160) by the number of male Chinese team members (60):  

160 / 60 = 2  

So, there are 2 female Chinese team members."
"Response:  We know that Zayid has $6,000 per month in income and he spends it as follows:  

* Rent: 1/4 of his salary = $6,000 x 1/4 = $1,500 per month  
* Gas: 1/3 of his salary = $6,000 x 1/3 = $2,000 per month  
* Other expenses (including food, transportation, etc.): $6,000 - ($1,500 + $2,000) = $6,000 - $3,500 = $2,500 per month  
* Charity: Half of his remaining salary = $6,000 - $3,500 - $2,500 = $6,000 - $6,000 = $0 per month (he donates all his remaining salary to charity)  

So, after paying all these expenses and making a charitable donation, Zayid has $0 left over each month."
"Response:  We know that Rani has 10 crabs and Moni has 4 crabs less than Rani. So, Moni has 6 crabs (10 - 4 = 6). Now, we need to find out how many crabs all three of them have in total. To do this, we can add up their numbers:  
Rani has 10 crabs + Moni has 6 crabs + Bo has 40 crabs = 10 + 6 + 40 = 56 crabs. 
Therefore, all three people together have 56 crabs."
"Response:  We know that Lao Er teaches math for $10 per hour and works for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. So we can calculate his earnings as follows:

Week 1:
Earnings = 5 hours x $10/hour = $50

Week 2:
Earnings = 8 hours x $10/hour = $80

Therefore, Lao Er earned a total of $50 + $80 = $130 in two weeks."
"Response: 
1. If one candidate gets 3/4 of the votes, that means they get 3/4 x 80 = 60 votes.
2. So, the other candidate gets 80 - 60 = 20 votes.
Therefore, the number of votes the losing candidate receives is 20."
"Response:  We know that Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white lilies (200 x 4 = 800). And she also ordered 5 times as many white lilies as pink carnations (200 x 5 = 1000). So in total, Sandra ordered 800 + 1000 = 1800 flowers.  
Since Sandra is unhappy with the incomplete delivery and threatened to switch suppliers, Fred must deliver at least 1800 - X flowers before 5 pm to keep her business."
Response:  We know that Mark is currently 30 years old and has been 5 years older than Jack for two years ago. So we can start with the fact that Mark was 25 years old two years ago. Now let's find out how old Jack was at that time. Since Mark was 5 years older than Jack two years ago, it means that Jack was 20 years old at that time (25 - 5 = 20). Therefore, Jack is now 22 years old (20 + 2 = 22).
Response:  We know that each team has four members and they run 400 meters or one lap around the standard track. The first team is very disciplined, with each member running exactly 55 seconds for their 400-meter segment. For the second team, the first runner runs in 60 seconds, while the remaining three runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So the second runner will finish in 60 + (3 x 2) = 69 seconds, the third runner will finish in 69 + (3 x 1) = 72 seconds, and the fourth runner will finish in 72 + (3 x 0) = 72 seconds. Therefore, the total time of the second team is 60 + 69 + 72 + 72 = 283 seconds. Since the first team is very disciplined and all members run exactly 55 seconds, their total time is 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds. Based on this information, the second team is slower than the first team by 283 - 220 = 63 seconds.
"Response: 

1. The first roll has a probability of 5/6 for an odd number and 1/6 for an even number.
2. If the first roll is odd, the second roll also has a probability of 5/6 for an odd number and 1/6 for an even number. Therefore, the probability that both rolls are odd is (5/6) × (5/6) = 25/36.
3. If the first roll is even, the second roll has a probability of 1/6 for an odd number and 5/6 for an even number. Therefore, the probability that both rolls are even is (1/6) × (5/6) = 5/36.
4. Since we want to compare the probability of rolling two consecutive odd numbers with the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers, we need to find the ratio of these probabilities.

Ratio = (probability of rolling two consecutive odd numbers) / (probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers)
= (25/36) / (5/36)
= 7/12

So, the probability of rolling two consecutive odd numbers is approximately 7/12, or 58.33%, higher than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers."
Response:  We know that 詹娜 (Jane) has picked half of the apples that her mother has picked. So if her mother has picked 20 apples, Jane has picked 20/2 = 10 apples. Therefore, in total, they have picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 groups of mice, each with the same number of mice (x). Each group has 6 mice and receives 6 stalks of hay. So, x + x + x = 160 (total number of stalks of hay given to small animals) 
We can simplify this equation as follows: 3x = 160 
Now we divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 53 
Therefore, there are 53 mice in total among the three groups."
"Response:  We know that Mani borrowed $100 from Benny at an interest rate of 2%. This means that for every month, Mani needs to pay 2% of the original amount as interest. So, in total, she needs to pay 6% of $100 as interest over 3 months. Now, let's calculate how much Mani needs to pay Benny after 3 months:  
Interest = (Original Amount x Interest Rate) / Number of Months  
= ($100 x 2%) / 3  
= $2  
So, Mani needs to pay Benny $100 + $2 = $102 after 3 months."
Response:  We know that each bag of wheat costs $20 from the farmer and $2 to transport it to the warehouse, so the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22. If the merchant sells each bag for $30, then he earns a profit of $30 - $22 = $8 per bag. Since he has a total profit of $400, he must have sold x bags, where x = 400 / $8 = 50 bags.
"Response:  We know that they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 on food, so their total expenses are:

$20.25 + $4.50 = $24.75

We also know that they played two different rides, each costing $33. So, the total amount they spent on rides is:

2 x $33 = $66

Since they want to split the costs evenly among themselves, we can calculate how much each person needs to pay by dividing the total expenses by the number of people:

$24.75 / 3 = $8.25 per person

So, each person needs to pay $8.25 to cover all the expenses."
"Response:  We know that John can pick 2 cherries per minute, and he picked cherries for 3 hours. So, we need to calculate how many cherries he picked in total.  
1 hour = 60 minutes  
3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes  
Since John can pick 2 cherries per minute, he picked:  
180 minutes x 2 cherries/minute = 360 cherries  
Therefore, John picked 360 cherries in 3 hours."
"Response:  We know that each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate how much each duck needs to eat per day as follows:  

3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds (or 8 ounces) of insects per day  
Since there are 10 ducks in total, we need to multiply the amount of insects needed per day by 10 to get the total amount needed for all 10 ducks:  

0.5 pounds x 10 ducks = 5 pounds (or 2.5 kilograms) of insects per day  
Therefore, if there are 10 ducks and they need to eat 5 pounds (or 2.5 kilograms) of insects per day to survive, then the group of ducks needs 50 pounds (or 22.68 kilograms) of insects per week."
Response:  We know that Tom plants 10 trees every year and cuts down 2 trees every year. So after 10 years, he will have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees in total. However, we are also told that 30% of the trees die, so the number of dead trees is 30% of 100, which is 30 trees. Therefore, the number of alive trees is 100 - 30 = 70 trees.
"Response: 

Step 1: On Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos in the front yard of Sally's house. (Initial number)

Step 2: On Saturday morning, 3/4 of the pink flamingos were taken away and repainted white. (Removed number)

Step 3: On Sunday morning, 18 new pink flamingos were added to the front yard. (Added number)

Now let's calculate the total number of flamingos at each stage:

Stage 1 (Friday): 18

Stage 2 (Saturday): 18 - 3/4 = 18 x 3/4 = 12

Stage 3 (Sunday): 12 + 18 = 30

Therefore, on Sunday afternoon, there were 30 flamingos in Sally's front yard."
"Response:  We know that Violeta needs 5 different colored pens and each pen costs $2. So, she will need to buy 5 x 2 = 10 pens. Since she has a budget of $20, we can calculate how much money she will have left after buying all the pens:  
$20 - $10 = $10.  
So, Violeta will have $10 left after buying all the pens."
"Response:  We know that one set of steel pens costs $1.20 and one piece of eraser costs $0.30. So if we buy 8 sets of steel pens, how much will it cost in total?  
First, calculate the cost of 8 sets of steel pens: 8 x $1.20 = $9.60  
Now, add the cost of 8 pieces of erasers: 8 x $0.30 = $2.40  
So the total cost is $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00"
"Response:  We know that there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of turnips. So we can start by multiplying 40 by 2 to get the total amount of turnips needed:  
40 x 2 = 80 pounds  
Now, since we have 200 pounds of turnips in total, we can subtract the amount used by the restaurants from the total amount to find out how much will not be used:  
200 - 80 = 120 pounds  
Therefore, 120 pounds of turnips will not be used."
"Response:  We know that there are 23,786 residents in Sodda City, including 8,417 males and 9,092 females. To find out how many children live in the city, we need to subtract the number of males and females from the total population.  
Subtracting 8,417 + 9,092 = 23,786 - (8,417 + 9,092) = 23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277. Therefore, there are 6,277 children living in Sodda City."
"Response: 

1st month: 20 cards
2nd month: 3 times 20 = 60 cards (less 20 = 40 cards)
3rd month: 2 times (40 + 60) = 2 times 100 = 200 cards

Therefore, she has 200 cards in total."
"Response:  We know that Mark edits 1,000 sentences per week for two different publishers, A and B. Publisher A pays him $5 per sentence, while Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A. So, Publisher B pays $10 per sentence.

Total amount earned from Publisher A = 1,000 x $5 = $5,000
Total amount earned from Publisher B = 1,000 x $10 = $10,000

Total weekly earnings = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000"
"Response:  We know that Baldur is drawing water from a well every day, and he draws 5 buckets of water in the morning and 6 buckets of water in the afternoon. Each bucket contains 5 liters of water. So, let's calculate how much water Baldur gets each day:  
Morning: 5 buckets x 5 liters/bucket = 25 liters  
Afternoon: 6 buckets x 5 liters/bucket = 30 liters  
Total daily water intake: 25 + 30 = 55 liters per day"
"Response:  We know that John gets $5,000 as a one-time cash bonus and an additional 5% increase in his salary. If he earns $2,000 per week (or $104,000 per year), then his total annual income before the award is:

$2,000 x 52 = $104,000

Now, let's calculate his new annual income after receiving the award:

$104,000 + ($5,000 x 1.05) = $104,000 + $52,000 = $156,000

So, John's new annual income after receiving the award is $156,000."
"Response:  We know that Joanna has 10 acres of land and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Since there are 60 pounds in a ton, we can calculate how many pounds of grapes she produces per year as follows:  
10 acres x 5 tons/acre = 50 tons/year  
50 tons x 60 lbs/ton = 3,000 lbs/year  
Now, we need to convert the number of pounds of grapes into gallons of wine, since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels (or 60 gallons) of wine. So, we can calculate the total amount of wine produced per year as follows:  
3,000 lbs / 60 gal/ton = 50 barrels/year  
Therefore, Joanna's vineyard produces 50 barrels (or 3,000 gallons) of wine per year."
"Response:  We know that Cal loves cheese and eats three sandwiches every day for lunch, with two slices of cheese per sandwich. That means he consumes a total of 6 pieces of cheese per day (2 x 3).

We also know that he eats scrambled eggs and cheese for breakfast for three days, with one extra slice of cheese per serving compared to his lunch sandwiches. So, he consumes an additional 3 pieces of cheese per day (1 x 3) during these three days.

Finally, we are told that he made a large batch of cream-filled pasta with 8 slices of cheese inside. Since each slice is equivalent to half a piece of his regular sandwich cheese, we can multiply the number of slices by 2 to get the total number of pieces of cheese used in the pasta dish: 8 x 2 = 16 pieces of cheese.

Adding up all these numbers gives us a grand total of:

6 + 3 + 16 = 25 pieces of cheese consumed by Cal this week!"
Response:  First, we know that 珍妮特 has 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So she has a total of 32 pens. Then, she buys 6 packs of blue pens, each with 9 pens per pack, so she gets 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens. And she also buys 2 packs of red pens, each with 6 pens per pack, so she gets 2 x 6 = 12 red pens. In total, 珍妮特 now has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.
"Response:  We know that Brinly has taken five exams so far and his scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To find out how much he needs to score in the sixth exam to get an average of 93, we need to calculate his current average first.  
Current Average = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 453 / 5 = 90.6  
Now, we subtract the lowest score from the current average to find out what Brinly needs to score in the sixth exam:  
Needed Score = 90.6 - 71 = 19.6  
So, Brinly needs to score at least 19.6 points in the sixth exam to achieve an overall average of 93."
"Response:  We know that Michael rode his bike for 4 weeks and each week he rode at least 5 times, with each ride being 25 kilometers long. So, in total, he rode 4 x 5 = 20 km per week.
Now, we know that he decided to reduce the number of rides to 2 times per week, but he increased the distance of each ride to 60 kilometers. So, in total, he rode 2 x 60 = 120 km per week.
Since he rode for 3 weeks, his total distance traveled is 120 km/week x 3 weeks = 360 km."
Response:  We know that there are 25 sticks of licorice in Joey's candy bag and each stick weighs twice as much as one piece of fruit. So if each piece of fruit weighs x grams, then each stick of licorice weighs 2x grams. Since there are 80 pieces of fruit in total, the total weight of all the fruit is 80x grams. The total weight of all the licorice sticks is 25 \* 2x = 50x grams. Therefore, the total weight of Joey's candy bag is 80x + 50x = 130x grams.
"Response: 
Day 1 (Monday): Lu bought 4 pieces of cake.
Day 2 (Tuesday): She bought three times as many pieces of cake as she did on Monday. So, she bought 3 x 4 = 12 pieces of cake.
Day 3 (Wednesday): She bought five times as many pieces of cake as she did on Tuesday. So, she bought 5 x 12 = 60 pieces of cake.
In total, Lu bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 pieces of cake over the three days."
"Response:  We know that the total cost of buying 20 cups is $1,200, and each cup costs $6,000. So we can calculate the number of cups as follows:  
$1,200 / $6,000 = 0.2 (or 20%)  
Therefore, if you buy 20 cups, the total cost will be:  
20 x $6,000 = $120,000  
So the cost per cup is:  
$120,000 / 20 = $6,000 per cup"
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that each time Sara watches her neighbor's kids, she earns $5. So if she wants to buy a jacket for $30 and two pairs of shoes for $20 each, she needs to earn a total of $70.

Secondly, we know that Sara has already saved $10 before starting to watch the kids. So she needs to earn an additional $60 ($70 - $10) to reach her goal.

Thirdly, we know that Sara can earn $5 per session of watching the kids. To calculate how many sessions she needs to have, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per session ($5):

$60 / $5 = 12 sessions

Therefore, Sara needs to watch the kids 12 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and two pairs of shoes."
"Response:  We know that Jeremy has a total of 42 chicken eggs per day. Since red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and white chickens lay 5 eggs per day, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  

Let R be the number of red chickens and W be the number of white chickens.  

R x 3 + W x 5 = 42... (1)

We also know that there are twice as many white chickens as red chickens. So we can write:  

W = 2R... (2)

Substituting (2) into (1), we get:  

R x 3 + 2R x 5 = 42  

Combine like terms:  

6R + 10R = 42  

16R = 42  

R = 7  

So there are 7 red chickens. Now we can find out how many white chickens there are:  

W = 2R = 2(7) = 14  

Therefore, Jeremy has 7 red chickens and 14 white chickens."
"Response:  We know that Gary likes to walk along the edges of the park, which is a rectangle with a length of 1.5 miles and a width of 6 miles. If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how long will it take him to walk around the park?  
First, let's find out the perimeter of the park. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(1.5 + 6) = 2 x 7.5 = 15 miles.  
Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Gary to walk around the park based on his speed: Time = Distance / Speed = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.  
Therefore, if Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour along the edges of the park, it will take him 5 hours to complete one lap around the park."
"Response: 

Day 1: 100 customers

Day 2: 100 + (50 more) = 100 + 50 = 150 customers

Total number of customers in first two days: 100 + 150 = 250

Now, we need to find out how many customers will come on Day 3.

Let's assume that the total number of customers who will come in three days is 500.

So, the number of customers on Day 3 can be calculated as follows:

500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, there will be 250 customers on Day 3."
"Response:  We know that the large water pool has twice as much water as the small water pool at first. So, if the initial amount of water in the small water pool is x gallons, then the initial amount of water in the large water pool is 2x gallons.  
We also know that both pools are being drained at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, the rate at which water is leaving the small pool is also 4 gallons per minute.  
Since the problem states that the large pool's water level is now four times that of the small pool, we can set up the following equation to represent this information:  
Let L be the current volume of water in the large pool (in gallons). Then we have:  
L = 2x + 4(4 minutes) = 2x + 16  
Now we need to find out how much water is currently in the small pool. To do so, we can subtract the volume of the large pool from the total volume of water in both pools:  
Small pool volume + Large pool volume = Total volume  
x + L = Total  
Substituting L from the previous equation, we get:  
x + (2x + 16) = Total  
3x + 16 = Total  
Solving for x, we get:  
x = 8  
Therefore, there are currently 8 gallons of water in the small pool."
"Response:  We know that 
Lori wants to buy two pairs of shoes and one belt, so we can write this as:  
Shoes x 2 + Belt = Total Cost 
We also know that the total cost is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00. Now we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn enough money to buy these items. So let's convert the total cost into hours worked:  
$352.00 / $8.00 per hour = 44 hours  
Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the two pairs of shoes and one belt."
"Response:  We know that 珍妮丝 borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay an additional 10%. So, the total amount she needs to repay is:

$2,000 + (10% of $2,000) = $2,000 + $200 = $2,200

Now, we are given that she plans to make 12 monthly payments of $165 each. So, let's calculate how much she will have paid after each payment:

Month 1: $165
Month 2: $165
...
Month 12: $165

Total amount paid over 12 months:

165 x 12 = $1,980

So, after making all 12 payments, 珍妮丝 will still owe the remaining balance of:

$2,200 - $1,980 = $220

Therefore, her outstanding balance after 12 months is $220."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more large flowers than roses. So we can start by writing down what we know:  
4 (roses) + 7 (large flowers) =? (total number of flowers) 
Now we need to find out how many large flowers there are. Since there are 7 more large flowers than roses, if we divide 7 by 4 (the number of roses), we get:  
7 / 4 = 1 with a remainder of 3  
So there are 1 large flower plus 3 small flowers (since there are always 3 small flowers for every 1 large flower). Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is:  
4 (roses) + 1 (large flower) + 3 (small flowers) = 8 flowers"
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times Harriet's age, and Harriet is half of Zach's age. So we can start with these two equations:  
Adrian = 3 x Harriet = 3(21) = 63 years old  
Harriet = half of Zach's age = (1/2) x Zach's age Now let's find out how old Zach is. Since he is 21 years old now, his age in three years will be:  
Zach = 21 + 3 = 24 years old Now we have all three ages:  
Adrian = 63 years old  
Harriet = 21 years old  
Zach = 24 years old In three years, their ages will be:  
Adrian = 63 + 3 = 66 years old  
Harriet = 21 + 3 = 24 years old  
Zach = 24 + 3 = 27 years old The average of these three ages is:  
(66 + 24 + 27) / 3 = 187 / 3 = 62.33 years old Therefore, three years from now, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zach will be approximately 62.33 years old."
"Response:  We know that Naomi got 68 points and Yuri's score is half of Naomi's plus 10. So we can write an equation based on this information:  
Yuri's score = (Naomi's score + 10) / 2  
Substituting Naomi's score with 68, we get:  
Yuri's score = (68 + 10) / 2  
= (78) / 2  
= 39  
So Yuri scored 39 points.  
Now let's find out how many points Brianne scored. We know that her score is 17 more than Naomi's score. So we can write another equation:  
Brianne's score = Naomi's score + 17  
Substituting Naomi's score with 68, we get:  
Brianne's score = 68 + 17  
= 85  
So Brianne scored 85 points.  
Finally, let's find out how many points Jojo scored. We know that he scored more than Naomi but less than Brianne. So we can write an inequality:  
Jojo's score > Naomi's score  
and  
Jojo's score < Brianne's score  
Substituting the values, we get:  
Jojo's score > 68  
and  
Jojo's score < 85  
We can solve this inequality by finding the range of values between 68 and 85. The difference between 85 and 68 is 17, so the range is:  
68 + 17 = 85  
Therefore, Jojo scored between 68 and 85, inclusive."
"Response:  We know that each fill-in-the-blank game takes 10 minutes and each Sudoku game takes 5 minutes. So if she completed 3 fill-in-the-blank games and 8 Sudoku games over the weekend, we can calculate the total time as follows:  

3 (fill-in-the-blank games) x 10 min/game = 30 min  
8 (Sudoku games) x 5 min/game = 40 min  
Total time = 30 min + 40 min = 70 min"
"Response: 

Step 1: Sally uses 90 liters of water from the water tank to irrigate her small garden. So, how much water is left in the tank?

We can set up an equation based on this information:

Let x be the amount of water left in the tank (in liters).

Since Sally used 90 liters of water, we know that the amount of water left in the tank is equal to the initial amount of water minus the amount used:

x = 120 - 90

Solving for x, we get:

x = 30

So, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank after Sally used 90 liters to irrigate her garden.

Now, let's consider the second part of the problem. Sally collected twice as much rainwater as she had left in the tank. How much rainwater did she collect?

We know that Sally collected twice as much rainwater as she had left in the tank, so if she had x liters of water left in the tank, she collected 2x liters of rainwater.

We also know that the total amount of water Sally had was 120 liters, so we can set up another equation:

2x + x = 120

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3x = 120

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 40

So, Sally collected 40 liters of rainwater.

Finally, we can find out how much water is left in the tank by adding the amount of water left in the tank (30 liters) to the amount of rainwater collected (40 liters):

Total water left in the tank = 30 + 40 = 70 liters

Therefore, there are 70 liters of water left in the tank."
"Response:  We know that Andy planted 90 plants of marigold and 40 fewer than marigold of dwarf cornflower. So we can start with the equation:  
90 - 40 = x  
where x is the number of dwarf cornflowers planted. Solving for x gives us:  
x = 50  
So Andy planted 50 dwarf cornflowers in total."
"Response:  We know that the company spent $15,000 in one year and three-quarters of that amount in another year. So we can start by finding out how much they spent in the second year.  
Three-quarters of $15,000 is:
3/4 x $15,000 = $11,250
So the company spent $11,250 in the second year. Now let's add up the total amount they spent over both years:
$15,000 + $11,250 = $26,250
Therefore, the company spent a total of $26,250 on advertising over two years."
"Response:  We know that Carlos rented a boat for $30 per hour and Benji rented a paddleboat for $18 per hour. If they use the boats for different amounts of time, we need to calculate their total rentals separately.

Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours, so his rental cost would be:

$30/hour x 3 hours = $90

Benji uses the paddleboat for 5 hours, so his rental cost would be:

$18/hour x 5 hours = $90

Since both Carlos and Benji have the same total rental cost ($90), it means they paid the same amount overall."
"Response: 

1. From New Jersey to Rochester by public bus takes 6 days.
2. If he drives from Rochester back to New Jersey, it will take half as long as the time taken by the public bus.
3. Therefore, the total number of days required for the round trip (including both the bus journey and the drive) is:

6 + (1/2) \* 6 = 6 + 3 = 9 days.

So, Andrew needs to spend 9 days on his road trip, with 6 days spent traveling by public bus and 3 days spent driving from Rochester back to New Jersey."
"Response: 

Firstly, James has 30 fire-type cards and 20 grass-type cards, so he has a total of 50 cards.

Secondly, if he loses 8 water-type cards, he will have 50 - 8 = 42 cards left.

Thirdly, if he buys 14 grass-type cards, he will have 42 + 14 = 56 cards in total.

Lastly, since one randomly selected card is water-type, the probability of it being a water-type card can be calculated as follows:

Probability of selecting a water-type card = (Number of water-type cards / Total number of cards) x 100%
= (8 / 56) x 100%
= 14.29% (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the probability of selecting a water-type card from James' deck is approximately 14.29%."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the meal without any discounts or promotions. We know that the basic wrap costs $6.50 and he added some extra ingredients:  
$6.50 (basic wrap) + $2.00 (meat) + $1.00 (cheese) + $1.00 (olive) + $2 x $0.25 (sauces) = $9.75  
Now, let's add the upgrade options:  
$9.75 (total cost of meal) + $3.00 (upgrade to include fries and drink) = $12.75  
Finally, we can apply the gift card:  
$12.75 (total cost with upgrades) - $5.00 (gift card value) = $7.75  
So, the final amount Chad needs to pay is $7.75."
"Response:  We know that Kaitlyn can finish 4 pieces per minute and her mother can finish half of what Kaitlyn can do, so her mother can finish 2 pieces per minute. To find out how many hours it will take for them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the number of pieces they have to finish by their combined completion rate. In this case, there are 360 pieces in total, so we can calculate as follows:  
Time = Total Pieces / Combined Completion Rate  
Time = 360 / (Kaitlyn x Mother)  
Time = 360 / (4 x 2)  
Time = 360 / 8  
Time = 45 minutes  
Therefore, it will take Kaitlyn and her mother 45 minutes to complete the 360-piece jigsaw puzzle together."
"Response: 

First, Ashlyn picked 30% of the watermelons that were ready to be harvested, which is 30% of 120 = 36 watermelons.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons had ripened, which is 3/4 of 96 (since 30% were already picked) = 72 watermelons.

So, after two weeks, there were 36 + 72 = 108 watermelons left.

Now, we need to find out how many watermelons still haven't ripened yet. To do this, we subtract the number of ripe watermelons from the total number of watermelons:

108 - 72 = 36

Therefore, there are still 36 watermelons that have not yet ripened two weeks after Ashlyn's second visit."
"Response: 

First, we know that there are 12 cars in total and each car costs $20,000. So the total cost of all the cars is:

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we know that Mark paid 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. So he paid:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000 (tax)

Finally, we know that he also paid $1,000 registration fee for each car. So he paid:

12 x $1,000 = $12,000 (registration fees)

Therefore, the total amount Mark spent on the cars and related fees is:

$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $386,000"
Response:  We know that on Monday, Kaley collected 5 more shells than Robbert, so Kaley collected 5 + 2 = 7 shells on Monday. On Tuesday, Kaley collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so Kaley collected 7 x 2 = 14 shells on Tuesday. Therefore, Kaley collected 14 shells on Tuesday.
"Response:  If there are 50 ants in the garden, and each ant can eat half a bug, then the total number of bugs in the garden is:  
50 x (1/2) = 25  
Therefore, there are 25 bugs in the garden."
"Response:  We know that there are initially 36 penguins in total. If three-quarters of them (i.e., 36 x 0.75 = 27) jump into the sea to swim, then how many penguins remain on land?

We also know that another third (i.e., 36 x 0.33 = 12) enter caves to eat. So, we need to subtract both groups from the initial number:

36 - 27 - 12 =?

Solving for the remaining penguins, we get:

36 - 27 - 12 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 penguins left on land basking in the sun."
"Response: 

1. Steve eats twice as much tomatoes as his girlfriend does.
2. He eats 6 tomatoes per day.
3. If one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, how many vines does Steve need?

Let X be the number of vines Steve needs.

Since his girlfriend eats 2 times less than him, she eats 6/2 = 3 tomatoes per day.
So, she needs 3 x 7 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now we know that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and his girlfriend eats 21 tomatoes per week, so we can set up the following equation:

X + 21 = 6

Solve for X:

X = 6 - 21 = -5

Therefore, Steve needs negative 5 vines to satisfy his daily tomato consumption!"
"Response:  We know that John has 20 friends and each friend will eat 4 pieces of pizza. So, in total, John needs to buy:  
20 x 4 = 80 pieces of pizza. 
Since each pizza can be cut into 8 slices, John needs to buy:  
80 / 8 = 10 pizzas."

Let's calculate it together!"
"Response: 

First, John had $20 in cash.

Then, he added $10 to it, so he had $30 in total.

Next, he invested this money and earned three times the original amount within one year.

So, after one year, he had $30 x 3 = $90."
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years old, and her sister Jasmine is five years older than Mary. So Jasmine is five + 2 = 7 years old. If Jasmine is 20 years old, then we can calculate their ages as follows:  
Mary (2) + Jasmine (7) + Gracie (20) =?  
2 + 7 + 20 = 39"
"Response:  We know that there are 1,000 students in total and 30% of them leave through entrance A. That means 300 students leave through A (1,000 x 0.3).  
Now, we have 700 students left (1,000 - 300 = 700), and 3/5 of them leave through entrance B. That is, 420 students leave through B (700 x 0.6).  
So, now we have 280 students left (700 - 420 = 280). These students must have left through entrance C. Therefore, the number of students who left through C is 280."
"Response:  We know that James has 6 pieces of candy and John has twice as much as James. So, John has 2 x 6 = 12 pieces of candy. Now we are given that John has 54 pieces of candy, so we can set up an equation:  
12 + 54 = 54 + x  
where x is the number of pieces of candy James has. Solving for x, we get:  
x = 36  
So, James has 36 pieces of candy."
"Response: 

1. Multiple Choice Answer: 3 books.
2. Explanation: If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's book, they will have read two books in total (Dolly's book and Pandora's book). Additionally, they will also read their own book, so the total number of books read is 3."
"Response: 

1. Total number of letters Mike receives per week = 2 x 5 pages/letter x 1 letter/week = 10 letters/week
2. Time taken to write one page = 6 minutes
3. Total time taken to write all letters in a week = 10 letters x 1 page/letter x 6 minutes/page = 600 minutes/week
4. Number of hours in a week = 7 days x 24 hours/day = 168 hours/week
5. Therefore, percentage of time spent writing letters in a week = (600 minutes/week) / (168 hours/week) x 100% = 35.71%

So, Mike spends approximately 35.71% of his time writing letters each week."
"Response:  We know that Jeremy has 1,000 minutes of mobile package per month and he makes 15-minute calls to his boss every day. So, in total, he spends 15 x 30 = 450 minutes talking to his boss each month. Since there are 30 days in this month, we can calculate how many minutes he has left as follows:  
1,000 - 450 = 550 minutes  
Therefore, Jeremy still has 550 minutes left for other calls or activities this month."
"Response: 
1. Griselda has 24 cookies and gives 5 to Kelvin.
2. Bill takes twice as many cookies from Kelvin.
3. Grizelda gives some of her remaining cookies to Kelvin.
4. Colby takes fewer cookies than Bill but more than Kelvin took.

Now let's analyze what we know:

1. Griselda starts with 24 cookies (G).
2. She gives 5 cookies to Kelvin (K), so she has 24 - 5 = 19 cookies left (G').
3. Bill takes twice as many cookies as Kelvin, so he takes 2 x 5 = 10 cookies from Griselda (G').
4. Now Griselda has 19 - 10 = 9 cookies left (G"").
5. Griselda gives some of her remaining cookies to Kelvin, so let's say she gives him x cookies (x < 9, since there are only 9 cookies left).
6. After giving cookies to Kelvin, Griselda has 9 - x cookies left (G"").
7. Colby takes fewer cookies than Bill but more than Kelvin took, so he takes x + 3 cookies (since Bill took 10 and Kelvin took 5).
8. Finally, Griselda has 9 - x - (x + 3) = 9 - x - 3 = 6 cookies left (G"").

We want to find out how many cookies Griselda gave to Kelvin, so we can set up an equation based on the information we have:

Let x be the number of cookies Griselda gave to Kelvin.

Since Griselda started with 24 cookies and had 9 cookies left after giving cookies to Kelvin, we can write:

24 - x = 9... (1)

Since Bill took twice as many cookies as Kelvin, we know that Bill took 2x cookies:

2x = 10... (2)

Since Colby took fewer cookies than Bill but more than Kelvin took, we know that Colby took x + 3 cookies:

x + 3 = 10... (3)
"
"Response:  We know that there are 4 fish in one aquarium and 32 fish in another aquarium. The difference between the number of fish in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in one aquarium. So we can write an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of fish in one aquarium. Then the number of fish in the other aquarium is 2x.

We know that the sum of the numbers of fish in both aquariums is equal to the total number of fish. Therefore, we can write:

x + 2x = 4 + 32

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 36

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 12

So there are 12 fish in each aquarium."
"Response: 

First, we know that the makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours per day, so the daily cost is:

$250 x 6 hours = $1,500 per day

Since the movie takes 5 weeks to film (5 weeks x 4 days per week = 20 days), the total cost for the entire project is:

$1,500 x 20 days = $30,000

Now, we need to calculate the discount given by the makeup artist. Since the makeup artist gave a 10% discount, we can calculate the amount paid by Jia as follows:

$30,000 x 90% = $27,000 (amount paid by Jia)

So, Jia paid $27,000 for the makeup services provided by the makeup artist over the course of 5 weeks."
Response:  We know that there are three people in total - Isabella and her two parents. The total cost of all the party supplies is $12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 98 dollars. Since they will split the cost equally among themselves, each person will pay $\frac{98}{3} = 32$ dollars.
"Response:  We know that each bag of onions weighs 50 pounds and costs $1.50 per pound. So, if our chef bought 4 bags of onions, she spent:

4 x 50 = 200 pounds
x 1.50 = $300

Therefore, our chef spent $300 on onions."
"Response:  We know that Su's sister ate 5 pieces of bread on Monday and 13 pieces on Tuesday. So we can start by writing down what we know:  
Monday: 5 x 200 = 1000 calories (from bread)  
Tuesday: 13 x 200 = 2600 calories (from bread) Now let's add up all the calories from both days to find out how many more calories Su consumed than her sister: Total calories for Monday + Tuesday = 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories For Su's sister, the total number of calories consumed is 3600. To find out how much more Su consumed, subtract the sister's total from Su's total: 3600 - 3600 = 0 extra calories Su consumed the same amount of calories as her sister. Therefore, the correct answer is 0."
