Response:  To find out how far John is from home at the end of the four hours, we need to calculate his total distance traveled during that time. First, let's break down his journey into two parts: the first two hours when he was driving at 60 miles per hour, and the last two hours when he was driving at 80 miles per hour.  Part 1 (2 hours x 60 miles/hour): Total distance = 2 hours x 60 miles/hour = 120 miles Part 2 (2 hours x 80 miles/hour): Total distance = 2 hours x 80 miles/hour = 160 miles Now, let's add the total distances traveled in each part to get the overall distance John has covered: Overall distance = 120 miles + 160 miles = 280 miles So, after four hours, John is 280 miles away from home.
Response:  If Eliza worked 45 hours this week and her regular hourly wage is $10, then she earned $450 (45 x $10) for her regular hours. Additionally, since she worked 5 hours of overtime (45 - 40 = 5), her overtime pay would be $60 (5 x $12). Therefore, her total earnings for the week would be $510 ($450 + $60).

"Response:  To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his tree farm, we need to consider the following costs and revenues:

* Initial cost of planting the trees: $90 per year (one-time cost)
* Annual revenue from selling lemons: $7 x 1.5 = $10.50 per year (starting in Year 2)
* Annual maintenance costs (irrigation and fertilization): $3 per year

We can calculate the break-even point by dividing the initial investment by the annual revenue minus the annual maintenance costs:

$90 / ($10.50 - $3) = 90 / $7 = 12.86 years

Therefore, Carlos will start making a profit from his tree farm after approximately 12.86 years."
Response:  Melanie had 5 aspirators at first and sold one-third of them to the green house, two to the red house, and half of what was left to the orange house. So she has 5 - (1/3 + 2) = 5 - 6 = 1 aspirator left.

"Response:  To determine the best option for the merchant, we need to calculate the expected profit from each choice. For the jewelry option, we have:  
Profit = (Value of jewelry x Growth rate) - Purchase price  
= (5000 x 2.5%) - 3000  
= 1250 - 3000  
= -1750  
For the electronic device option, we have:  
Profit = (Value of electronic devices x Growth rate) - Purchase price  
= (8000 x 1.2%) - 6000  
= 960 - 6000  
= -5040  
Since both options result in negative profits, it is not advisable for the merchant to make either purchase. Therefore, the best course of action would be to hold off on making any purchases and wait for better investment opportunities."

"Response:  To find the median of the numbers given by Gunter's friends, we need to first convert each number into a fraction of the total quantity in the bucket (which is 100). So, 

* 80/100 = 4/5
* 20 + (20/2) = 20 + 10 = 30/100 = 3/5
* 25% more than 4/5 = (4/5 x 1.25) = 5/5 = 1

So, the median of the three numbers is 1."
Response:  If John has 10 dogs and each dog needs 0.5 hours per day for walking and taking care of their business, then John spends 5 hours per week (10 x 0.5) caring for his dogs.
"Response:  Gretchern has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's say she has x silver coins. Then, she has 30 + x gold coins. We know that the total number of coins is 110. So we can set up the equation:

x + (30 + x) = 110

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing by 2:

x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 30 + 40 = 70 gold coins."
Response:  Siobhan has 36 bijouteries (40 - 5 = 36).
"Response:  To find out how many points Mike scored in total, we need to calculate his score for each of the two periods and then add them up. For the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points, so:  
Mike's score for first 20 minutes = 4 points. For the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than in the first period, so:  
Mike's score for second 20 minutes = (1 + 0.25) x 4 = 4 x 1.25 = 5 points. Total number of points scored by Mike = Mike's score for first 20 minutes + Mike's score for second 20 minutes = 4 + 5 = 9 points."
Response:  If Terry eats 2 yogurts per day and each yogurt costs $4 for 5 yogurts, then he spends $8 per day on yogurts. Since there are 30 days in a month, Terry spends $8 x 30 = $240 on yogurts for one month.
Response:  John has 13 sets of Lego and sells each one for $15, so he makes $185 in total ($15 x 13). He spends $20 x 8 = $160 on video games, leaving him with $185 - $160 = $25. Since he has $25 left over after buying all the video games, he must have 13 sets of Lego left.
Response:  To find out how fast John runs, we need to divide the distance he covers by the time he takes to cover it. Let's use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. In this case, the distance is 60 miles, and the time is 3 hours (1.5 hours x 2 days). So, Speed = 60 miles / 3 hours = 20 miles per hour.

Response:  To find Charlie's net profit if he sells 20 lumânare, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost first. Total Revenue = Number of lumânare x Price per lumânare = 20 x 2 = 40 dollars Total Cost = Weight of ceară de albine (in kg) x Price per kilogram = 1 x 10 = 10 dollars Since Charlie is using 1 kilogram of wax to make 10 lumânare, his total cost for 20 lumânare will be 10 dollars. Now, let's calculate his net profit: Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = 40 - 10 = 30 dollars So, Charlie's net profit from selling 20 lumânare will be $30.
"Response: 30 hours.

Explanation:
To calculate the number of hours spent writing articles by Meredith in three days, we need to first determine how many hours she spent writing each day. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, she wrote 5 articles and it took her 4 hours to write each article, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing on Monday.
* On Tuesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Monday (2x 5 = 10), but it still took her 4 hours to write each article, so she spent 10 x 4 = 40 hours writing on Tuesday.
* On Wednesday, she wrote two-fifths more articles than she did on Monday (2/5 x 5 = 6), and it still took her 4 hours to write each article, so she spent 6 x 4 = 24 hours writing on Wednesday.

Adding up the time spent writing on each day gives us:

20 + 40 + 24 = 84 hours

Therefore, Meredith spent 84 hours writing articles over the course of those three days."

Response:  To find out how much John spent on red ties, we need to calculate the total amount he spent based on the number of red ties he bought and their cost per unit. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:  Number of red ties = 2 times more than the number of blue ties (since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties) Cost of one red tie = 50% more than the cost of one blue tie We know that John spent $200 on blue ties, so let's use this information to find out how much he spent on red ties. First, we'll calculate the cost of one blue tie: $40 Since John bought 200 blue ties, his total spending on blue ties is: Total cost of blue ties = 200 x $40 = $8,000 Now, since John buys two red ties for every one blue tie, he buys 2 x 200 = 400 red ties. The total cost of these red ties would be: Total cost of red ties = 400 x ($40 + 50%) = 400 x ($40 + $20) = $8,000 + $8,000 = $16,000 Therefore, John spent a total of $16,000 on red ties.
"Response:  To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of wire (1.5 meters) by the length of each piece (15 cm). Therefore, Tracy obtained:

"Response:  To find out how much money Lloyd makes per week from selling eggs, we need to multiply the number of eggs he produces per day by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:  

252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week  

Since each egg costs $2, the total revenue for one week would be:  

1,764 eggs/week x $2/egg = $3,528 per week"
Response:  To find out how long it takes for Tom to return at 6 km/h, we need to divide the distance he needs to cover (which is half of the total distance traveled) by his speed: Time = Distance / Speed = (half of 10 miles) / 6 km/h = 5 hours
Response:  If Uriah wants to reduce the weight of his book bag by 5 kg and each comic book weighs 1/4 kg and each toy weighs 1/2 kg, then he needs to remove 5 kg / (1/4 kg + 1/2 kg) = 5 kg / (0.25 kg + 0.5 kg) = 20 books and 10 toys.

Response:  To find out how much Janet paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the materials and the construction of the bracelet first. The cost of the materials is $500, and the cost of constructing the bracelet with bijouterie is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the bracelet is: Total Cost = Materials + Construction Cost = $500 + $800 = $1300 Next, we need to subtract the insurance premium that Janet paid, which is 10% of the total cost. Insurance Premium = Total Cost x 10% = $1300 x 10% = $130 So, the final amount that Janet paid for the bracelet is: Final Amount = Total Cost - Insurance Premium = $1300 - $130 = $1170
Response:  If Marcy retires after 30 years of service and receives a $50,000 annual pension, her pension will be reduced by 5% for each year she is retired before reaching age 65 (20 years x 5% = $10,000). Therefore, her annual pension would be $40,000 ($50,000 - $10,000).
"Response:  To calculate the total amount paid for the streaming service until the end of the year, we need to first find out how much was paid during each half of the year. If the company charged $140 per month and then reduced the price by 10%, the cost for the first half of the year would be:  
$140 x 6 months = $840  
For the second half of the year, the cost would be:  
$840 x (1 - 0.1) = $752  
Therefore, the total amount paid for the streaming service until the end of the year is:  
$840 + $752 = $1,592"
Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive with one tank of gasoline, we need to divide the amount of gas in the tank (12 gallons) by the number of miles she has driven since filling up last (160 kilometers). We know that there are approximately 3.8 liters per liter, so we can convert kilometers to miles as follows: 1 kilometer = 0.6214 miles. Therefore, Sophia has driven 160 kilometers x 0.6214 miles/kilometer = 97.5 miles since her last fill-up. Since the manual states that the car's fuel tank holds 12 gallons, and each gallon is equal to 3.8 liters, we can calculate the distance Sophia can travel as follows: 12 gallons / 3.8 liters/gallon = 317.5 miles. So, Sophia can drive approximately 317.5 miles on one tank of gasoline.

$x + 40 = 100

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"Response:  If Judy teaches 5 classes per day, Monday through Friday (5 x 7 = 35 classes per week), and 8 classes on Saturday (8 x 15 = 120 classes per week), then she teaches a total of 35 + 120 = 155 classes per week.

Response:  To calculate how much money Tommy will raise by selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to multiply the number of items sold by their price per unit. For brownies, Tommy sold 43 units at $3 each, so he raised:  43 x $3 = $130 For cheesecakes, Tommy sold 23 units at $4 each, so he raised:  23 x $4 = $92 Therefore, Tommy raised a total of: $130 + $92 = $222
Response:  To calculate the monthly payment for each phone, we need to divide the purchase price by the number of months in the financing period (in this case, 3 months). So, for each phone, the monthly payment would be: $150 / 3 = $50 per month. Therefore, Sheila will pay $50 per month for each of the five phones she purchased, for a total of $50 x 5 = $250 per month.

Response:  If Sarah spends £400 on laundry and Raymond spends half as much as Sarah, then Raymond spends £200 on laundry.  If Sarah spends 4 times more than David, then David spends £100 on laundry.  Therefore, the difference between the amount spent by Raymond and David is £300 (£200 + £100).
Response:  To find out how much money is saved by buying 18 flowers at a better price, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at both prices and compare them. Let's do that!  Price per flower (3-pack):  $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per flower Price per flower (2-pack): $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per flower Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at each price: Total cost @ $0.83/flower: 18 x $0.83 = $14.64 Total cost @ $0.50/flower: 18 x $0.50 = $9.00 Since the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price ($9.00) is less than the total cost at the original price ($14.64), buying 18 flowers at the better price saves $5.64 ($14.64 - $9.00). So, buying 18 flowers in a pack of 2 for $9.00 instead of buying them individually at $0.83 each saves $5.64.
Response:  The cost of caring for the dog would be $70 (100 x 0.7).

Response:  To calculate how much Christina will spend on party favors, we need to first determine how many guests she will have. Since one-fourth of her invited guests won't be attending, we can subtract that number from the total number of guests. So, if Christina has invited 16 friends and one-fourth of them won't come (which is 4), then she will have 16 - 4 = 12 guests at her party. Next, we multiply the number of guests by the cost per guest to find out how much Christina will spend in total. Therefore, Christina will spend $2 x 12 = $24 on party favors for her birthday celebration.
Response:  To feed all 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, Ted should bring 20 x 10 = 200 kg of coleslaw (since each adult will eat 10 kg) plus 5 x 5 = 25 kg of coleslaw for the children (since each child will eat half as much as an adult). In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 kg of coleslaw to the picnic.
Response:  If Cindy has four pets and Marcia has two more than Cindy, then Marcia has (4 + 2) = six pets. Therefore, Jan has three more pets than Marcia, so Jan has (6 + 3) = nine pets in total.
"Response:  If Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey, then Amy's age can be represented as follows: 
Amy's age = (Emily's age + 5) - 2 
Since Emily's age is given to be 35, we can substitute this value into the equation above: 
Amy's age = (35 + 5) - 2 
= 42 - 2 
= 40 
Therefore, Amy is 40 years old.  Similarly, we can find the ages of the other children using the same method: 
Jackson's age = Emily's age - 5

Response:  To calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital from these visits, we need to multiply the number of patients seen per day (500) by the average time spent with each patient (24 minutes), and then multiply that result by the hourly rate charged by the hospital ($150). This gives us: Total Revenue = (500 x 24) x $150 = $360,000 per day.  To calculate the total profit generated by the hospital, we need to subtract the cost of providing care to each patient ($200 per hour) from the total revenue. This gives us: Profit = Total Revenue - Cost Per Patient x Number of Patients = $360,000 - ($200 x 500) = $360,000 - $100,000 = $260,000 per day.

Response:  If Jordan spends two hours per day playing video games and works half-time (4 hours/day) at his job earning $10/hour, he would work for 20 hours/week ($80). In one week, Jordan would earn from his job: $80 x 4 weeks = $320. Additionally, if he plays video games for 2 hours/day, he would spend: 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week playing video games. Therefore, in one week, Jordan would spend: 14 hours/week x $10/hour = $140 playing video games. So, in total, Jordan would earn $320 + $140 = $460 in one week.

Response:  To determine how long Tim will be ahead of Steve before losing the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both of them to cover the distance to their homes. Let's start by finding out how long it takes for Steve to cover the distance to his home: Distance = 3 miles Time = Speed x Time = 440 ft/min x (3 mi / 5280 ft) = 15 minutes Now, let's find out how long it takes for Tim to cover the distance to his home: Distance = 3 km Time = Speed x Time = 264 ft/min x (3 km / 5280 ft) = 9 minutes Since Tim is ahead of Steve by 9 minutes, he will lose the race after 9 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 9 minutes.

10 + 5 = 15 stars of marine life  
6 + 3 = 9 sea horses  
3 + 2 = 5 clown fish

Response:  To find out how much each uniform costs in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them up. The cost of the pălărie is $25, the cost of the jachetă is three times that of the pălărie, so the cost of the jachetă is $25 x 3 = $75. The cost of the pantaloni is half the cost of the pălărie, so the cost of the pantaloni is $25 / 2 = $12.50. Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $25 + $75 + $12.50 = $112.50.

Response:  To calculate how much Jessica pays in one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payments for her credits, we need to first calculate the total amount of money that she owes each month and then multiply it by 12 months.  For the student loans with a minimum payment of $300 per month, the total amount owed is $300 x 12 = $3600 per year.  For the credit card with a minimum payment of $200 per month, the total amount owed is $200 x 12 = $2400 per year.  For the mortgage with a minimum payment of $500 per month, the total amount owed is $500 x 12 = $6000 per year.  If Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum payments, she will pay $3600 + (50% of $3600) = $3600 + $1800 = $5400 per year for the student loans. She will pay $2400 + (50% of $2400) = $2400 + $1200 = $3600 per year for the credit card. And she will pay $6000 + (50% of $6000) = $6000 + $3000 = $9000 per year for the mortgage.
Response:  To calculate how long it will take Billy to prepare all 60 potatoes, we need to know his preparation time for one potato (1 minute and 30 seconds) and the number of potatoes he needs to prepare (60). We can use the formula: Time = Number / Rate, where Time is the total time required, Number is the number of items to be prepared, and Rate is the time taken to prepare one item. In this case, Time = 60 / (1 minute + 30 seconds), which simplifies to Time = 60 / 90 seconds, or approximately 2 minutes. Therefore, Billy will take approximately 2 minutes to prepare all 60 potatoes.
Response:  To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to divide the total amount of money they made in profit (25 dollars) by the price per pahar (0.50 dollars). So, we get: 25 / 0.50 = 50 pahars They sold 50 pahars x 20 pahars/liter = 1000 liters of lemonade. Since each liter costs 3 dollars for lemons and 2 dollars for sugar, their total cost is: 1000 liters x 3 dollars/liter + 1000 liters x 2 dollars/liter = 3000 dollars + 2000 dollars = 5000 dollars. Therefore, they spent 5000 dollars on lemons.

Response:  If Mark is 5 years older than half of Jean's age and Jean is 2 years older than Mark, then we can set up an equation based on their ages. Let J be Jean's age and M be Mark's age. We know that M = (J + 2) / 2, since Mark is 2 years older than half of Jean's age. Also, we know that J = 30, since Jean is 30 years old. So we can substitute J = 30 into the equation for M: M = (30 + 2) / 2 M = (32) / 2 M = 16 Therefore, Jean is 16 years old.

Response:  There are six possible outcomes when throwing a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Let's count how many of these outcomes result in Jerry throwing two consecutive numbers (i.e., 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, etc.).  Outcome #1: Jerry throws a 1 on the first roll and a 2 on the second roll. This outcome has a probability of 1/6.  Outcome #2: Jerry throws a 2 on the first roll and a 3 on the second roll. This outcome has a probability of 1/6.  Outcome #3: Jerry throws a 3 on the first roll and a 4 on the second roll. This outcome has a probability of 1/6.  Outcome #4: Jerry throws a 4 on the first roll and a 5 on the second roll. This outcome has a probability of 1/6.  Outcome #5: Jerry throws a 5 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll. This outcome has a probability of 1/6.  Outcome #6: Jerry throws a 6 on both rolls. This outcome has a probability of 1/6. Now, let's calculate the probability that Jerry throws three consecutive numbers (i.e., 3, 4, and 5):  Outcome #7: Jerry throws a 3 on the first roll, a 4 on the second roll, and a 5 on the third roll. This outcome has a probability of (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/216.  Since there is only one way for Jerry to throw three consecutive numbers, the probability of this event occurring is 1/216, or approximately 0.46%. Therefore, the probability that Jerry will throw more than three consecutive numbers is 1 - 0.46%, which is approximately 95.54%.

Week 1: 5 rides x 25 km/ride = 125 km
Week 2: 4 rides x 25 km/ride = 100 km
Week 3: 2 rides x 60 km/ride = 120 km
Total: 125 + 100 + 120 = 345 km"

"Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate how much money she will earn from each mowing and compare it to the total cost of the items she wants. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  
* Each time Sara mows the lawn, she earns $5.  
* She has already saved $10.  
* The jacket costs $30.  
* Each pair of shoes costs $20.  
To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can set up an equation using these values:  
$5 (earnings per mow) x (number of mows) = $30 (jacket cost) + ($20 x 2) (shoe cost)  
Solving for the number of mows needed, we get:  
$5 x (number of mows) = $30 + ($20 x 2)  
$5 x (number of mows) = $50  
Now, let's divide both sides by $5 to solve for the number of mows:  
Number of mows = $50 / $5  
Number of mows = 10  
Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."

Response:  The large pool currently has four times as much water as the small pool. If the small pool had 2 gallons of water at time t=0, then the large pool would have had 8 gallons (2 x 4) of water at that time. Since 4 minutes have passed, both pools have lost 4 gallons each, so the current volume of water in the large pool is still 8 gallons, and the current volume of water in the small pool is 2 gallons.
Response:  To calculate how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford her purchases, we need to divide the total amount she wants to spend (320 + 32 = 352) by her hourly wage (8). So, she will need to work:  352 / 8 = 44 hours
Response:  To find out how much money will be left to Janeth after she pays off the loan, we need to calculate the total amount of money that she will pay over the course of 12 months. We can do this by multiplying the monthly payment of $165 by 12: Total Amount = Monthly Payment x Number of Months Total Amount = $165 x 12 Total Amount = $1980 Now, we subtract the total amount from the original loan amount to find out how much will be left to Janeth: Remaining Balance = Loan Amount - Total Amount Remaining Balance = $2000 - $1980 Remaining Balance = $20 To find out the percentage increase in the remaining balance due to the interest rate, we divide the difference between the original loan amount and the remaining balance by the original loan amount, and then multiply by 100: Percentage Increase = (Remaining Balance - Loan Amount) / Loan Amount x 100 Percentage Increase = ($20 - $2000) / $2000 x 100 Percentage Increase = -$1800/ $2000 x 100 Percentage Increase = -90% So, there will be $20 left for Janeth after she pays off the loan, and the interest rate has resulted in a 90% decrease in the remaining balance.

"Response:  To find out how many hours it will take for Kalinda and her mother to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of working on the puzzle. Let's assume that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, and her mother can place half as many pieces per minute (2 pieces per minute). We can start by finding their individual rates:  
Kalinda's rate = 4 pieces/minute  
Mother's rate = 2 pieces/minute Now, let's find their combined rate: Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mother's rate = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute Since there are 360 pieces in total, we can divide the number of pieces by their combined rate to find out how long it will take them to finish the puzzle: Time = Total pieces / Combined rate = 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes or 1 hour So, it will take Kalinda and her mother 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle."

Response:  To find out how many students exited through door C, we need to first determine how many students remained in the building after 30% of them exited through door A and 3/5 of the remaining students exited through door B. Let's use algebra to represent this situation:  Let x be the number of students who initially entered the room (x = 1000).  After 30% of the students exited through door A, the number of students left in the room is:  30% of x = 0.3x = 300 students remain in the room.  Now, 3/5 of the remaining students exit through door B, so the number of students who exit through door B is:  3/5 of 300 = 240 students exit through door B.  Finally, we want to know how many students exited through door C, which is the difference between the initial number of students and the sum of the numbers who exited through doors A and B:  Number of students who exited through door C = x - (300 + 240) = x - 540 = 460 students.  So, there were 460 students who exited through door C.

Response:  To calculate how many minutes Jason has left this month, we need to subtract the number of minutes he spent talking to his boss (15 x 30 = 450) and the additional minutes he had for other calls (300). So, Jason has 1000 - 450 - 300 = 250 minutes left this month.
Response:  Ginger gave Griffin 3 more cartofis than Kyle took.
"Response:  There are twice as many fish in the second aquarium as there are in the first aquarium. If both aquariums have the same number of fish, then the number of fish in the second aquarium is twice the number of fish in the first aquarium. Let x be the number of fish in the first aquarium. Then, the number of fish in the second aquarium is 2x. We know that the difference between the number of melons in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in the first aquarium. So, we can set up the equation:  

Number of melons in second aquarium - Number of melons in first aquarium = 2(Number of fish in first aquarium)

Substituting the value of the number of fish in the first aquarium (x), we get:  

40 - 3x = 2x

Solving for x, we get:  

x = 16

So, there are 16 fish in the first aquarium and 2 times 16 = 32 fish in the second aquarium."
"Response:  To calculate how much Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to first determine the total cost of the makeup services based on the number of hours worked and the hourly rate. We know that Jean had 6 hours of makeup work per day, and there were 4 days per week, so the total number of hours worked per week is:  

6 hours/day x 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

We also know that the makeup artist charged $250 per hour, so the total cost of the makeup services for one week is:  

24 hours/week x $250/hour = $6,000/week

Since the filming lasted for 5 weeks, the total cost of the makeup services is:  

$6,000/week x 5 weeks = $30,000

After the film was finished, the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, so the final amount Jean paid is:  

$30,000 x 90% = $27,000"

"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of calories that each of them consumed. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:  - Luni (Monday), Sue ate 4 times as much as her sister.  - Marti (Tuesday), Sue ate twice as much as her sister.  - The sister ate 5 prăjituri (pronounced ""prah-zhee-tur-ee"") on Monday and 13 on Tuesday.  We can start by calculating the total number of prăjituri that the sister ate on both days:  Monday: 5 + 13 = 18 prăjituri Tuesday: 18 x 2 = 36 prăjituri Now, let's calculate the total number of calories that each of them consumed:  For the sister: 18 x 200 = 3600 calories On Monday, the sister ate 5 prăjituri, so she consumed 5 x 200 = 1000 calories. On Tuesday, she ate 13 prăjituri, so she consumed 13 x 200 = 2600 calories. In total, the sister consumed 3600 + 2600 = 6200 calories. For Sue: Since Sue ate 4 times as much as her sister on Monday, she ate 4 x 18 = 72 prăjituri. On Tuesday, she ate twice as much as her sister, so she ate 2 x 36 = 72 prăjituri. In total, Sue consumed 72 + 72 = 144 prăjituri. Since each prăjitor has 200 calories, Sue consumed 144 x 200 = 28800 calories. Therefore, Sue consumed 28800 - 6200 = 22600 more calories than her sister."
