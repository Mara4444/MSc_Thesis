"Response: 56 km
Explanation:
John started his journey at a speed of 100 km/h and then slowed down to 30 mi/h for the first two hours. For the next two hours, he traveled at a speed of 80 mi/h. To find the distance from John's location to home after four hours, we need to use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance would be: Distance = 100 km/h x 2 h + (80 mi/h x 2 h) = 56 km. Therefore, John is 56 km away from home after four hours of traveling."

Explanation: To calculate the future value of the pension, we need to use the formula FV = PV x (1 + r)^n, where FV is the future value, PV is the present value (which is equal to the initial amount), r is the interest rate per year, and n is the number of years. In this case, the present value is $50,000, the interest rate is 5% per year, and the number of years is 30. Therefore, the future value of the pension after 30 years is $176,890,000."

"Response: 683 eur
Explanation:
Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items that Elvira has chosen:

* Camera: 1090 eur x 2 = 2180 eur (since she wants two cameras)
* Scanner: 157 eur
* Printer: 102 eur
* PICAP for CD-disks: 74 eur

Total cost = 2180 + 157 + 102 + 74 = 2413 eur

Now, let's check how much money Elvira has left in her budget:

Budget = 1500 eur - 2413 eur = -913 eur

Since Elvira has spent more than her budget allows, she will have to pay the difference herself. Therefore, the amount of money she will have left after buying these items is:

Money left = Budget + Cost of items = -913 eur + 2413 eur = 1500 eur

So, Elvira will have 1500 eur left after buying these items."

Since Fred can only deliver 50 red roses per evening, the number of evenings it will take him to deliver all of Sandra's order is:

$800 / $50 = 16 (evenings)
Therefore, Fred will need 16 evenings to deliver all of Sandra's order."

"Response: 1500 kg (or 1.5 tons) of potatoes.
Explanation:
The price of one kilogram of potatoes is $20 per kilogram. Therefore, if the farmer sells all his potatoes for $20 per kilogram, he will earn $20 x 1500 = $30,000 in total.
If it costs $2 to transport each kilogram of potatoes from the farm to the storage, and the farmer has sold all his potatoes, then he has spent $2 x 1500 = $3000 on transportation costs.
So, the farmer's profit is $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 3 eggs produced by red crows per day and 5 eggs produced by white crows per day.

As for the red crows, since they produce only half as many eggs as the white crows (i.e., 3/5), then there are 21 x 3/5 = 10 red crows."
"Response: 30 minutes.
Explanation: To calculate the time it takes for someone to walk through a meadow with an area of 1.5 hectares at a speed of 5 km/h, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is half of the area of the meadow (since the person is walking in both directions), which is 75 square meters (half of 1.5 hectares). Therefore, the time it takes to walk through the meadow is: Time = 75 m² / 5 km/h = 15 minutes. However, since the question asks about the ""time it would take"" and not the actual time taken, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 30 minutes or 2 hours."
