Aqui está a solução da questão:

Kylar needs to pay $\$5 \times (16/2) = \$80$ for the 16 glasses.

Explanation:

The first glass costs $\$5$, so the second glass costs $\$5 \times 60\% = \$3$. Therefore, the total cost of 16 glasses is:

$\$5 + (\$3 \times 15) = \$80$

So, Kylar needs to pay $\$80$ for the 16 glasses."

Ao calcular o valor das botas, precisamos first calculate the total cost of the three options:

Bootes = $X
Heels1 = $33
Heels2 = $66
Total Cost = $X + $33 + $66 = $105

Since Gloria has to choose between these three options, we can set up the following equation:

$X = $105 - ($33 + $66) = $105 - $99 = $6

So, the value of the boots is $6."

Explicação:
Given that one of Gunter's friends thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar, and another friend thinks there are 20 more than half of the first number, we can start by finding out how many jelly beans the second friend thinks are in the jar. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend thinks there are 20 + 40 = 60 jelly beans in the jar. The third friend thinks there are 25% more than the first number, which means they think there are 25% of 80, or 20 jelly beans, plus the 60 jelly beans the other two friends thought were in the jar. Therefore, the average guess of Gunter's three friends is 80 + 60 + 20 = 147 jelly beans in the jar."

"Response:  Tom will return in approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes).
Explanation: To calculate the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. We know that the distance traveled by Tom during his trip is 4 miles (since he starts at 1 mile and ends at 4 miles), and his speed varies between 10 miles per hour when he is traveling forward and 6 miles per hour when he is returning. Therefore, we can plug these values into the formula as follows:
Time = Distance / Speed
= 4 miles / 10 miles/hour
= 0.4 hours or 24 minutes
+ 4 miles / 6 miles/hour
= 0.67 hours or 39 minutes
Therefore, Tom will return in approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) after he sets out on his journey."

Ao calcular o valor total arrecadado por Tommy, precisamos conhecer o preço médio de cada um dos baked goods que ele vendeu. Para fazer isso, podemos dividir o número de unidades vendidas de cada tipo de doce pelo preço médio de cada um.

Para os brownies, Tommy vendeu 43 unidades e o preço médio é $3/slice = $3 x 43 = $129.
Para os cheesecakes, Tommy vendeu 23 unidades e o preço médio é $4/slice = $4 x 23 = $86.

Agora, para calcular o valor total arrecadado por Tommy, somamos as somas dos valores das duas categorias de doces:
$129 + $86 = $215.
Portanto, Tommy raised $215 em dinheiro com suas vendas de brownies e cheesecakes."

Solution:
To find out how much each of them ate on average, we need to divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of roll-ups each person had.

Total number of fruit roll-ups = 24 + 14 = 38

Number of roll-ups Beatrice had = 24
Number of roll-ups Marcell had = 14

Average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Beatrice = 38 / 24 = 1.56 (or 1 1/2)
Average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell = 38 / 14 = 2.79 (almost 3)

So, on average, Beatrice ate 1.56 fruit roll-ups more than Marcell."

Sasha can make a total profit of $380 if she sells all of her leftover lumber. Here's how we calculate it:

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, Sasha paid $10 each, so she made $100 from selling those (10 boards x $10 each = $100).
For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, Sasha paid $16 each, so she made $80 from selling those (5 boards x $16 each = $80).
Total profit = $100 + $80 = $380."

On the second day, if we assume that all the containers contained 5 vehicles each, then the total number of vehicles imported on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20. Therefore, there were 4 containers imported on the second day (20 / 5 = 4)."

Ao calcular a taxa de aumento de cada um, podemos usar as informações fornecidas na pergunta:

Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, so Adrien's salary = 1.3 \* Lylah's salary (since 30% is equal to 1.3)

Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40%, so Adrien's new salary = 1.4 \* Adrien's old salary (since 40% is equal to 1.4)

Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, so Lylah's new salary = 1.4 \* Lylah's old salary

We know that Adrien's old salary was $40,000, since it was 4 years ago. So Adrien's new salary = $40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000

Similarly, we can find Lylah's new salary: Lylah's new salary = $40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000

Therefore, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is $56,000 each."

Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled (in this case, the distance between Steve's house and the school), r is the rate (in this case, the speed of Steve's bike or Tim's skateboard), and t is the time taken for the race. Since Steve's house is farther away than Tim's, Steve will take longer to reach the school on his bike. Let's assume that Steve takes 15 minutes to cover the remaining distance of 3 miles after leaving the school. Therefore, the time taken by Tim to cover the same distance will be less, since he has a shorter distance to travel. Using the formula above, we can calculate the time taken by Tim as follows: t = d / r = 2 miles / 264 ft/min = 7.9 minutes Since Steve took 15 minutes to cover the first 3 miles, it means that Tim will finish the race in 7.9 minutes less than Steve. Therefore, the winner will arrive at their house 7.9 minutes after the loser finishes the race."

3. Next, let's calculate the number of fries left after the pigeons bullied the seagull away: 33 - (3 x 3) = 25
4. Finally, let's subtract the number of fries carried off by the ants: 25 - 1 = 24

Let's analyze the situation:

* In the next 10 years, he plants 10 new trees every year (10 x 10 = 100 new trees).
* However, he also chooses to cut down 2 trees each year (2 x 10 = 20 trees lost).
* After 10 years, 30% of the original 50 trees will have died (30/100 = 30 trees dead).

So, after 10 years, Tom will have:

New trees planted = 100 - 20 = 80 trees
Trees remaining = 50 - 30 = 20 trees

Therefore, Tom will have 40 trees left after 10 years."

Este é um problema de probabilidade. Para calcular o percentual de chance que um cartão será de tipo água, precisamos first calculate the probability of picking a card of any given type, then multiply it by the number of cards of that type that James has.

The probability of picking a card of any given type can be calculated using the following formula:

Probability = Number of cards of that type / Total number of cards

In this case, there are 30 fire-type cards, 20 grass-type cards, and 40 water-type cards in total. So, the probabilities of picking a card of each type are:

Probability of picking a fire-type card = 30/90 = 0.33 or 33%
Probability of picking a grass-type card = 20/90 = 0.22 or 22%
Probability of picking a water-type card = 40/90 = 0.45 or 45%

Now, let's calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water-type card:

Percentage chance = Probability of picking a water-type card x Number of water-type cards
= 0.45 x 40
= 18

So, there is an 18% chance that a randomly picked card will be a water-type card."
