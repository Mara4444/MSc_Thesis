Response:  To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for the 16 bottles of water, we need to calculate the total cost of each bottle and then multiply it by the number of bottles he wants to buy. The formula for calculating the total cost of each bottle is: Total Cost = Price per Bottle x Discount Percentage / 100. In this case, the price per bottle is $5, and the discount percentage is 60%, which means that Kylar will get a discount of 60% off the original price. So, the total cost of each bottle would be: Total Cost = $5 x (60/100) = $3.  Therefore, if Kylar wants to buy 16 bottles of water, he will need to pay $48 ($3 x 16).

Explanation:
To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to save enough money to buy a tree of lemons, we need to use the formula:
Years = (Total cost of tree / Annual income) x Number of years until he can afford to buy the tree

Years = ($90 / $1.5) x 24 = 24 years
So, it will take Carlos 24 years to save enough money to buy a tree of lemons."

Explanation:
The total number of cars that passed through the intersection in 15 minutes is given by the formula: Total Number = (Number of Cars per Minute x Time) + (Number of Cars exempt from Trapiko Jam).
In this case, there are 20 cars that pass through the intersection every 15 minutes, and 5 cars that do not need to stop at the traffic light due to the exemption rule. Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the intersection in 15 minutes is:
Total Number = (20 x 15) + (5) = 600 + 5 = 605
Since there were initially 30 cars at the intersection, the number of cars that maneuvered through the traffic light during the first 15 minutes is:
Number of Cars Maneuvering = Total Number - Initial Number = 605 - 30 = 575
Therefore, 40 cars maneuvered through the traffic light during the first 15 minutes."

Therefore, the total number of rings produced by all three friends pressing the doorbell 35 times is 35 x 1.71 = 60.55 rings. However, since we are asked for an exact number of rings, we round up to 375 rings.

* Croissants: 120 x 6 = 720 inches (or 183 cm)
* Baguettes: 60 x 2 = 120 inches (or 305 cm)

Adding these values together gives us the total length of all the pastries made by Bill."
Response:  To determine how many saging are needed to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of saging required by each species and then add them up. The formula for calculating the total number of saging required is: Total Number of Saging = (Number of Gorillas x Required Quantity per Gorilla) + (Number of Baboons x Required Quantity per Baboon) + (Number of Monkeys x Required Quantity per Monkey) Where: - Number of Gorillas = 400 - Required Quantity per Gorilla = 400 x 2 = 800 - Number of Baboons = 300 - Required Quantity per Baboon = 100 x 2 = 200 - Number of Monkeys = 200 - Required Quantity per Monkey = 50 x 2 = 100 Therefore, the total number of saging needed to last for 2 months is: Total Number of Saging = 800 + 200 + 100 = 1,100 saging.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the average speed of both Blake and Kelly as follows:  Average Speed of Blake = Total Distance Traveled / Number of Trials Blake traveled a distance of 100 yards in 15 minutes, which means he covered an average distance of 6.67 yards per minute (100 yards / 15 minutes). Average Speed of Kelly = Total Distance Traveled / Number of Trials Kelly also traveled a distance of 100 yards in 15 minutes, but she took longer to cover that distance because she stopped after each trial to rest. Therefore, her average speed can be calculated as follows: Average Speed of Kelly = Total Distance Traveled / Number of Trials x Time Taken To Cover That Distance In this case, Kelly took 34 trials to cover the same distance of 100 yards, so her average time taken to cover that distance was 34/1 = 34 seconds per trip. Since Kelly took longer to cover the distance than Blake, her average speed is lower than Blake's. The difference between their speeds can be calculated as follows: Difference in Speeds = Blake's Average Speed - Kelly's Average Speed Blake's average speed is 6.67 yards per minute, while Kelly's average speed is 3.28 yards per minute (34 seconds / 100 yards). Therefore, the difference in speeds between Blake and Kelly is: Difference in Speeds = 6.67 - 3.28 = 3.39 yards per minute or 21.56 kilometers per hour. So, based on the given information, Blake is faster than Kelly by approximately 3.39 yards per minute or 21.56 kilometers per hour.

Explanation:
The number of insects that Jake saw was given as 90 with 6 pairs, so there are 90 x 6 = 540 insects in total. Since there were also 80 butterflies with 8 pairs each, there are 80 x 8 = 640 butterflies in total. Finally, since there were 3 bihyran mutants without wings, there are 3 x 0 = 0 mutants in total. Therefore, the total number of creatures that Jake saw is 540 + 640 + 0 = 420."

Explanation:
The total number of rats in all three groups = 3 x 10 = 30 rats
Each rat receives 6 pieces of food, so the total amount of food given to all rats = 30 x 6 = 180 pieces of food
Since there are 10 hamsters and each gets 5 pieces of food, the total amount of food given to the hamsters = 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of food
There are 20 pieces of food given to the group of small animals (kuneho), so the total number of small animals = 20 / 5 = 4 small animals per group
Since there are 3 groups, the total number of small animals = 4 x 3 = 12 small animals
Now, we need to find out how many rats are in each group. Let's assume that the ratio of rats to small animals is the same for all groups. So, if there are x rats in one group, then there will be x/3 rats in each of the other two groups. Therefore, the number of rats in each group = (x/3) x 3 = 3x/3.
Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:
Total number of small animals = 12
Number of rats in each group = 3(30)/3 = 10 rats per group
So, there are 10 rats in each group."

Explanation:
The total cost of all the bags of rice that the farmer can sell to the merchant for $20 per bag is given by:
Total Cost = Number of Bags x Price per Bag
= 100 bags x $20/bag
= $2000
Since the merchant makes a profit of $400 after selling all the bags of rice, we know that he sold:
Number of Bags Sold = Total Profit / Price per Bag
= $400 / $30/bag
= 13 bags
Therefore, the number of bags of rice that the farmer can sell to the merchant is:
Number of Bags Sold = 150 bags

"Response: 120 kg (or 120,000 grams)

Explanation:
The question states that each pato needs to eat 3.5 libra of insects per week to survive. Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to calculate how much insects each pato needs to eat per day.

1 libra = 1000 grams
3.5 libra / 7 days = 0.5 libra (or 500 grams) of insects per day for each pato

Therefore, if there are 9 patos, they will need to eat a total of:
0.5 libra x 9 patos = 4.5 kg (or 4,500 grams) of insects per day."

Response: 48 bariles of rice. Explanation: To find out how many bariles of rice are produced by Josie's 10-acre farm in one year, we need to multiply the number of hectares (10 acres) by the average yield per hectare (5 tons/hectare), and then divide that result by the weight of a barile (60 kg). So, the total production of rice in bariles would be: 10 x 5 = 50 tons / 60 kg/barile = 48 bariles.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, Carl uses 16 piraso (or 80 grams) of cheese per day for his breakfast and lunch meals. This can be calculated as follows:

Breakfast: Carl eats one sandwich every day, which requires 2 piraso (or 10 grams) of cheese. Therefore, he uses 2 x 7 = 14 piraso (or 70 grams) of cheese for breakfast each day.

Lunch: Carl eats an omelette three times a week, which requires 3 piraso (or 15 grams) of cheese per serving. Since he eats this meal three times a week, he uses 3 x 3 = 9 piraso (or 45 grams) of cheese for lunch each week.

Macaroni and Cheese: Carl prepares a large plate of macaroni and cheese once a week, which requires 8 piraso (or 40 grams) of cheese.

Total daily usage: To calculate the total amount of cheese used by Carl each day, we need to add up the amounts used for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The total daily usage is therefore: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 piraso (or 165 grams) of cheese per day."

"Response:  To get a total of 93, Brinley needs to obtain a minimum average grade of 93 in the remaining five subjects. Let's calculate his current average grade based on the first five subjects:

Grade 1 = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458 / 5 = 91.6 (approximately)

Since he already has a good average grade, let's assume that he can maintain this level of performance in the next five subjects. Therefore, we need to find out how many points he needs to achieve in each subject to reach a total of 93:

Subject 6: 91.6 - 86 = 5.6 (points needed)
Subject 7: 5.6 x 2 = 11.2 (points needed)
Subject 8: 11.2 x 2 = 22.4 (points needed)
Subject 9: 22.4 x 2 = 44.8 (points needed)
Subject 10: 44.8 x 2 = 89.6 (points needed)

So, Brinley needs to score at least 5.6, 11.2, 22.4, 44.8, and 89.6 points in the remaining five subjects to achieve a total of 93."

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we know that:
* Griffin had 24 French fries initially.
* Kyle took 5 of them.
* Billy took twice as many French fries as Kyle (so he took 10).
* Ginger gave Griffin an extra full bag of potatoes (which contained 27 French fries).
Since Billy took double the number of French fries than Kyle, and Kyle took 5 French fries, then Billy took 10 + 5 = 15 French fries.
So, after all these events, there were 24 - 5 = 19 French fries left for Griffin.
Ginger gave Griffin an extra full bag of potatoes, which contains 27 French fries. So, the total number of French fries that Griffin has now is 19 + 27 = 46 French fries."

Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, here is how much each person spent for the birthday celebration of Isabelle's sister:  * For the cake, $12 was spent per person. Since there were 8 people in total, the total cost for the cake was $96 ($12 x 8).  * For the gifts, $43 was spent per person. Since there were 8 people in total, the total cost for the gifts was $344 ($43 x 8).  * For the decorations, $15 was spent per person. Since there were 8 people in total, the total cost for the decorations was $120 ($15 x 8).  * For the favors, $4 was spent per person. Since there were 8 people in total, the total cost for the favors was $32 ($4 x 8).  * For the presents for the guests, $22 was spent per person. Since there were 8 guests in total, the total cost for the presents was $176 ($22 x 8). Therefore, the total amount that Isabelle's parents spent for the birthday celebration of their daughter's sister was $96 + $344 + $120 + $32 + $176 = $880.

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the total number of cookies that Sue consumed as follows:
Noong Lunes: 4 times more than her sister (so 4 x 4 = 16) + 1 time more than her sister (so 17) = 33 cookies
Noong Martes: 2 times more than her sister (so 2 x 5 = 10) + 1 time more than her sister (so 11) = 21 cookies
Total number of cookies consumed by Sue = 33 + 21 = 54 cookies
Since each cookie contains 200 calories, the total number of calories consumed by Sue is:
Calories consumed by Sue = Total number of cookies x Calories per cookie = 54 x 200 = 10,800 calories
Now, let's compare this to the calories consumed by Sue's sister. According to the question, Sue's sister consumed 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, for a total of 18 cookies. Since each cookie contains 200 calories, the total number of calories consumed by Sue's sister is:
Calories consumed by Sue's sister = Total number of cookies x Calories per cookie = 18 x 200 = 3,600 calories
Therefore, the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is:
Difference in calories consumed = Calories consumed by Sue - Calories consumed by Sue's sister = 10,800 - 3,600 = 7,200 calories."
