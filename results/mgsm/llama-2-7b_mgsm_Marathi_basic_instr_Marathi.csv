"Response:  The answer is (D) None of the above.

Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) None of the above because the given information does not provide any evidence to support the claim that Joshane's house was sold for $80,000 and then bought back for $50,000. In fact, the information provided suggests that Joshane did not sell his house at all, but rather continued to own it throughout the period mentioned in the question. Therefore, none of the options listed are accurate representations of the situation described in the passage."
"Response:  The answer is 120 meters.

Explanation:

The height of the three towers is given as 60 meters each. Since there are three towers, the total height of all three towers is 3 x 60 = 180 meters. Therefore, the distance between any two adjacent towers is 180 / 2 = 90 meters."
Response:  The number of cups of food that each person in the group can eat is not fixed and depends on various factors such as their age, gender, weight, activity level, and other health conditions. Therefore, it is not possible to give an exact answer to your question without knowing more details about the individuals involved. However, a general guideline for determining how much food a person needs is to consume enough calories to maintain their current weight or to lose weight if they are overweight or obese. A safe and sustainable rate of weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week, which translates to a daily calorie deficit of 500-1000 calories through a combination of reducing caloric intake and increasing physical activity. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to determine the appropriate calorie intake for individual needs and goals.
Response:  The cost of the new apartment is $500,000. Each shareholder will pay $60,000 towards the purchase price, which means that Kailey will pay $900,000 ($60,000 x 16 shares). Therefore, the total amount that Kailey will pay for the apartment is $900,000.

Response:  The download speed of a file is affected by various factors such as the size of the file, the internet connection speed, and the server's response time. In this case, since the file size is around 2 GB, it may take around 20 minutes to complete the download even with a fast internet connection (assuming an average download speed of 1 MBps). However, if there are any issues with the server or the network, it could take longer for the download to complete.
Response:  The speed of a car traveling on a straight road is directly proportional to the distance traveled and inversely proportional to the time taken. Therefore, if the speed of the car remains constant at 60 mph (96.56 km/h), then the distance traveled will be twice that of the time taken. For example, if it takes 1 hour to cover a distance of 20 miles (32.19 km), then the distance traveled would be 40 miles (64.38 km) if the speed remained constant.
"Response:  The answer is $40.

Explanation:
The total amount of money earned by Eliza and Anna in one hour is $80 (40 + 40). Since they work for 45 minutes each, their earnings per minute are:
Eliza's earnings per minute = $80 / 45 minutes = $1.73
Anna's earnings per minute = $80 / 45 minutes = $1.73
Therefore, the total amount of money earned by Eliza and Anna in one hour is $40 (1.73 x 2)."
Response:  The number of downloads of a new program in the first six months is 60, and then it decreases by 30% every three months. Therefore, after three months, there will be 40 downloads (60 x 30% = 40).
Response:  The total cost of the three donuts is $68 per dozen, and the cost of two mini donuts is $80 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost of 6 mini donuts is $496 (6 x $80).
"Response:  The answer is $300.

Explanation:

The cost of the tree is $90, and it takes 7 years to grow. If you spend $1.50 on maintenance every year, then the total amount spent on maintenance will be $10.50 after 7 years. So, the remaining amount in your account after 7 years will be $89.50 ($90 - $10.50). Since you get $300 per year for 3 years, the total amount you have in your account after 3 years will be $300 x 3 = $900."

"Response:  The answer to your question is not straightforward as it depends on various factors such as the type of business, market conditions, and the entrepreneur's skills and experience. However, I can provide some general insights based on my knowledge.

Firstly, it is important to understand that starting a new business venture requires significant investment in terms of time, money, and resources. As you mentioned, the initial investment for an electrician's workshop could be around $500,000, which is a substantial amount for any entrepreneur. Moreover, there are other expenses such as rent, utilities, and staff salaries that need to be considered. Therefore, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the costs involved before making a decision.

Secondly, the market demand for electricians' services varies depending on the location and industry. For instance, if the entrepreneur plans to start a business in a metropolitan city with a high population density, there may be more demand for their services compared to a smaller town or rural area. Similarly, certain industries such as construction, manufacturing, and IT require more electrical services than others. Thus, conducting thorough market research and analyzing the competition is crucial before launching a new business venture.

Thirdly, the entrepreneur's skills and experience play a vital role in determining the success of the business. An experienced electrician who has worked in the field for several years may have better insight into the industry and its requirements than someone just starting out. Additionally, having a strong network of contacts within the industry can help attract clients and generate leads.

Lastly, it is worth considering alternative ways to start a business without incurring the initial investment of $500,000. For example, the entrepreneur could consider partnering with existing electricians or starting small-scale projects initially and gradually scaling up operations as the business grows.

In conclusion, while starting a new business venture can be challenging, it is possible with careful planning, market analysis, and strategic decision-making. By taking these factors into account, an aspiring entrepreneur can increase their chances of success in the electrical contracting industry."
Response:  The speed of the two trains is given by the equation v1 = 20 + 3t and v2 = 40 - 5t, where t is time in hours and v1 and v2 are the speeds of the two trains in m/h. To find the relative speed between the two trains at any time t, we need to subtract the speed of one train from the other: vrel = v2 - v1. For example, if t = 2 hours, then vrel = 40 - 20 = 20 m/h.

Response:  The average height of a man is 162 cm and the standard deviation is 8 cm. Therefore, the probability that a man's height is between 154 cm and 170 cm is (162 - 8) / (162 + 8) = 0.63.
Response:  The average height of the prisoners in the jail is 80 cm.
Response:  The number of cats that can be fed with 10 kg of food in a day is not fixed and depends on various factors such as the size and age of the cat, its activity level, and the quality of the food. Therefore, it is difficult to give an exact answer without knowing more details about the specific situation. However, as a general rule of thumb, most veterinarians recommend feeding a cat around 2-3% of its body weight in food per day. So, for example, if a cat weighs 4 kg (8.8 lbs), it would need around 80-120 grams of food per day.
Response: ग्रेचेनकडे किती सोन्याची नाणी आहेत? उत्तरावर 15 सोन्याची नाणी आहेत.
Response:  The ratio of the number of days Siyoban takes to complete a task to the number of days Eron takes to complete the same task is 40:5. If Siyoban takes 36 days to complete a task, how many days will Eron take to complete the same task?
"Response:  The number of minutes required to complete a task can be calculated as follows:

Total time = (Number of tasks x Time per task) / Number of people working on the task

In this case, there are 40 minutes in an hour and 20 minutes in a half hour. So, if it takes 20 minutes for one person to complete one task, then it will take 80 minutes (20 minutes/task x 4 people) for four people to complete 4 tasks. Therefore, the total time required to complete all 4 tasks is 320 minutes (80 minutes/task x 4 tasks).

Now, let's calculate the percentage increase in time required for each additional task:

Time increase = (Time required for additional task / Time required for original task) x 100

For the first two tasks, the time increase is 50% (25% / 20%) and 75% (37.5% / 20%). For the third and fourth tasks, the time increase is 125% (62.5% / 20%) and 150% (93.75% / 20%).

Therefore, the total time required to complete all 4 tasks is 320 minutes, and the percentage increase in time required for each additional task is:

* First task: 50%
* Second task: 75%
* Third task: 125%
* Fourth task: 150%"
Response:  The cost of 20 days' supply of milk at $5 per gallon is $100. So, the customer will have to pay $30 for 30 days' supply of milk.
Response:  The number of sets in each lego is 8.
Response:  The number of days in a week is 7. So, the total number of days in 6 months is 6 x 30 = 180 days. And the total number of days in 2 years is 2 x 365 = 730 days. Therefore, there are 730 - 180 = 550 days left after subtracting the number of days in 6 months from the total number of days in 2 years.
Response:  The answer to your question is that the number of times a person can take a bath in a day depends on their personal preferences and activities. Some people may prefer to take only one or two baths per day, while others may prefer to take more frequent baths. It also depends on the individual's activity level and how much they sweat during the day. For example, someone who works outdoors or engages in physical labor may need to take more baths than someone who has a sedentary job. Additionally, some cultures or religions may have specific guidelines for bathing frequency. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to determine what works best for them based on their own needs and lifestyle.
Response:  The number of years that the brand new iPhone will be available in the market after its launch can vary depending on various factors such as production capacity, demand, and supply chain disruptions.

Response:  The dragon's height is 400 feet and its wingspan is 300 feet. Therefore, the distance between its claws is 200 feet (400 - 200 =). As for how far the pollen from the lotus flower can reach, it depends on various factors such as wind speed, humidity, and altitude. However, if we assume that the lotus flower is at an altitude of 1000 feet, then the pollen can travel up to 400 feet away from the flower due to air currents. So, in this case, the distance between the dragon's claws and the lotus flower would be 200 feet (400 - 200 =).
Response:  The number of tuked (small pieces) that Jon can make from each paisa (coin) is 8.
Response:  The number of grams of rice that can be obtained from 250 calories is not directly proportional to the number of grams of rice required for a person's daily dietary needs. However, we can estimate the number of grams of rice needed based on the recommended daily intake of carbohydrates and protein. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an average adult requires approximately 200-250 grams of carbohydrates per day, which includes 45-65 grams of fiber. Additionally, the WHO recommends that adults consume 56-91 grams of protein per day. Therefore, if a person's daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories, they would need approximately 375-475 grams of rice (based on a 50/50 ratio of carbohydrates and protein) or 250-312 grams of rice (based on a 60/40 ratio of carbohydrates and protein).
Response:  The number of ponds that can be built with the given amount of money depends on various factors such as the size of the pond, the material used for construction, and the location of the pond. However, assuming an average cost of $10 per square foot for constructing a pond, we can calculate the area of one pond using the following formula: Area = Length x Width. For example, if the length is 20 feet and the width is 10 feet, then the area of the pond would be 20 x 10 = 200 square feet. Therefore, if you have $10,000 to build multiple ponds, you could potentially build around 50-60 small ponds (assuming an area of 200 square feet each) or around 10-15 medium-sized ponds (assuming an area of 400 square feet each).
Response:  The number of blog posts written by a free-lance blogger in one week is not fixed and can vary depending on the client's requirements and deadlines. As per your question, if the blogger writes 4 articles every Saturday and Monday, and each article takes approximately 2 hours to write, then the total time spent writing blog posts in one week would be 8 hours (4 x 2 = 8). However, this time may vary depending on the complexity of the topics being covered and the writer's level of expertise.

Response:  The number of apples that can be packed in a box depends on the size of the box and the apples themselves. A standard apple box is typically around 25-30 pounds (11-14 kg) and can hold around 36-40 apples, depending on their size. So, if you have 252 apples, you would need at least 8-9 boxes to pack them all. However, it's important to note that the exact number of apples that can fit in a box may vary depending on the specific dimensions of the box and the apples.
Response:  The answer is 10.
Response:  The number of comics that Urvashi can read in one sitting is limited by her short-term memory capacity, which is approximately 15 pounds (6.8 kg) per session. However, the weight of each comic book varies greatly depending on its size and format, so it's difficult to estimate exactly how many comics she can read in a single session without knowing more details about their specific dimensions. Therefore, I cannot provide an exact answer to your question without additional information.
Response:  If the trucks and cars are equally efficient in terms of fuel consumption, then the total cost of running the fleet will be lower if there are more trucks than cars. This is because trucks generally have a higher fuel efficiency per unit of distance traveled compared to cars. So, even though the total number of vehicles may be smaller with more trucks, the overall cost of operation will still be lower due to their better fuel efficiency. Therefore, the answer is (D) Lower.
Response:  The number of houses that can be built on a plot of land depends on several factors such as the size of the plot, the zoning regulations in place, and the local building codes. In general, most plots of land are divided into two categories - residential and commercial. Residential plots are typically smaller than commercial plots and have different requirements for building homes. For example, a residential plot may only allow for one or two story buildings, while a commercial plot may allow for larger structures with multiple stories. Additionally, there may be restrictions on the height of buildings, the type of materials used in construction, and other factors that affect how many houses can be built on a given plot of land. Ultimately, it is best to consult with local authorities and experts who can provide specific guidance based on your particular situation.
Response:  The probability of a gene being expressed in two different ways (i.e., as either on or off) is equal to the probability of that gene being present in the population multiplied by the probability of it being expressed in each possible way. In other words, P(on|present) = P(present) \* P(on), where P(on|present) is the probability of the gene being expressed given that it is present, and P(present) is the probability of the gene being present in the population. Similarly, P(off|present) = P(present) \* P(off). Therefore, if we know the probabilities of a gene being present in the population (P(present)) and the probabilities of it being expressed in each possible way (P(on) and P(off)), then we can calculate the probability of the gene being expressed in one of the two possible ways using Bayes' theorem: P(on| presente) = P(present) \* P(on)/P(all), where P(all) is the sum of the probabilities of the gene being present and expressed in both ways.
Response:  The answer is $39.
Response:  The trucks are not able to carry the full load of 5000 kg due to their weight limit of 15 tons each. Therefore, they can only transport a maximum of 3755 kg per trip, which is calculated by dividing the total weight of the boxes (4250 kg) by the number of trips (6).

"Response:  The number of teachers and students in a school can vary greatly depending on the size of the school, its location, and other factors. However, here is an approximate breakdown of the ratio of teachers to students in a typical Indian school:

* For primary schools (classes 1-5), there are usually around 20-30 students per teacher. So, if a primary school has 60 students, there would be about 2-4 teachers.
* For upper primary schools (classes 6-8), there are usually around 30-40 students per teacher. So, if an upper primary school has 100 students, there would be about 3-7 teachers.
* For high schools (classes 9-10), there are usually around 30-40 students per teacher. So, if a high school has 150 students, there would be about 5-7 teachers.
* For junior colleges (classes 11-12), there are usually around 20-30 students per teacher. So, if a junior college has 100 students, there would be about 2-5 teachers.

It's worth noting that these are just rough estimates, and the actual number of teachers and students in a particular school may vary significantly depending on various factors such as the school's budget, infrastructure, and teaching staff."
"Response:  The Belly is a part of the human body that is responsible for digestion and nutrient absorption. It is located in the abdominal cavity and contains various organs such as the stomach, small intestine, liver, pancreas, and kidneys. The belly is also home to trillions of microorganisms known as gut bacteria or microbiome, which play an essential role in maintaining overall health and well-being.

The size of the belly can vary greatly among individuals depending on factors such as age, gender, weight, and muscle mass. For example, children tend to have larger bellies than adults due to their rapid growth and development during childhood. Similarly, pregnant women may experience increased bloating and swelling in their bellies due to the growing fetus and hormonal changes in their bodies.

In terms of the amount of money spent on belly care products, it is difficult to provide an exact figure as there are many different types of products available and not all of them are specifically marketed towards this purpose. However, according to industry reports, the global market for probiotics alone (a type of supplement that supports gut health) was valued at over $6 billion in 2020 and is expected to continue growing in the coming years. This suggests that there is a significant demand for products that promote gut health and overall wellness, including those targeted towards the belly region."

"Response:  The answer is 150 cups of rice.

Explanation:

The question asks for the number of cups of rice that Sesiliya would need to eat every day to maintain her weight if she consumes 180 calories per day and has a BMR of 1300 calories per day. We know that Sesiliya's BMR is 1300 calories per day, so she needs to consume fewer calories than this amount to lose weight. Let's assume that she wants to lose 1 kg of weight per week, which is equivalent to 7000 calories. Therefore, she needs to create a calorie deficit of 500 calories per day (7000 - 1300 = 500). Since she can only reduce her daily caloric intake by 500 calories without compromising her nutritional requirements, she will need to eat 150 cups of cooked rice per day (500 / 33 = 150) to meet her daily calorie needs while still losing weight."

"Response:  The number of pairs of shoes that can be made from a single piece of leather depends on the size and shape of the leather piece, as well as the design and construction of the shoe. However, assuming an average size for a pair of shoes (e.g., European size 40) and using a rough estimate of 1 square foot of leather per pair of shoes, we can calculate the maximum number of pairs of shoes that can be made from a single sheet of leather as follows:

Let's assume the length and width of the leather sheet are x feet by y feet, respectively. To make a pair of shoes, we need to cut out two pieces of leather with dimensions of approximately 12 inches by 6 inches (for the upper part of the shoe) and 8 inches by 5 inches (for the sole). So, the total area of leather needed for one pair of shoes is approximately 12 inches by 6 inches + 8 inches by 5 inches = 96 square inches.

Now, let's divide the total area of the leather sheet by the area of one pair of shoes to get an estimate of the maximum number of pairs of shoes that can be made from a single sheet of leather:

Number of pairs of shoes = Total area of leather sheet / Area of one pair of shoes
= x feet by y feet / 96 square inches
= xy square inches

So, if we have a leather sheet measuring 10 feet by 5 feet (i.e., 50 square feet), we could potentially make around 50 pairs of shoes (50 x 50 = 2500 square inches). Of course, this is just a rough estimate, and the actual number of pairs of shoes that can be made will depend on various factors such as the thickness of the leather, the complexity of the designs, etc."

In fact, most people experience multiple dreams during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep, which occurs approximately every 90 minutes throughout the night. During REM sleep, the brain enters a state of heightened activity, similar to when we are awake and engaged in mental tasks. This can result in vivid and memorable dreams that may feel like they lasted longer than they actually did. Additionally, some research suggests that certain factors such as stress, emotions, and medication can affect the frequency and intensity of dreaming. So while you may not remember all of your dreams from one night, it's certainly possible to have more than one dream within a short period of time.

Response:  The height of each box is 5 inches and the width is 6 inches. Therefore, the area of each box is 30 square inches (5 x 6 = 30). Since there are three boxes, the total area of all the boxes is 90 square inches (3 x 30 = 90).
"Response:  The number of episodes of the TV show that can be watched in a week depends on various factors such as the day of the week, the time slot, and the duration of each episode. Based on the information provided, it is possible to calculate the total number of episodes that can be watched in a week.

For example, if we assume that there are 7 days in a week (Monday to Sunday), and each day has 24 hours (except for Saturday and Sunday which have 23 hours each), then the total number of hours in a week is:

7 days x 24 hours/day = 168 hours/week

Now, let's consider the time slots for each day:

* Monday to Friday: 9 AM to 5 PM (Total hours = 8)
* Saturday and Sunday: 10 AM to 6 PM (Total hours = 10)

So, the total number of hours available for watching TV shows in a week is:

168 hours - (8 + 10) = 150 hours/week

Assuming an average length of an episode is 30 minutes, we can calculate the number of episodes that can be watched in a week as follows:

150 hours/week / 30 minutes/episode = 5 episodes/week

Therefore, based on the given information, it is possible to watch 5 episodes of the TV show in a week."

Response:  The number of gallons of gas that can be purchased with $20 is not directly proportional to the number of gallons of gas that can be stored in a gas station's tank. There are several factors that affect how much gas can be stored at a given time, including the size and capacity of the tank, the flow rate of the pump, and the demand for gas in the area. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately estimate the number of gallons of gas that can be stored in a gas station's tank without knowing more information about the specific location and circumstances involved.
Response:  The number of Mars bars in a box is not fixed and can vary depending on the size of the box. A standard Mars bar weighs approximately 0.5 oz (14g), so if you have 24 rolls of Mars bars, each roll would weigh around 3 oz (85g). However, if you have 3 rolls of Mars bars, each roll would weigh around 6 oz (170g) since there are more bars per roll. Therefore, the total weight of Mars bars in a box can range from around 6 to 24 oz (170-620g), depending on how many rolls are in the box.

"Response:  The answer to the question is that there are several reasons why the number of employees in the department may be less than the required strength. Here are some possible reasons:

1. Lack of qualified candidates: There may not be enough qualified and skilled candidates available in the job market to fill all the vacant positions in the department. This can happen due to various factors such as a lack of educational institutions offering specialized courses, limited opportunities for on-the-job training and development, or a general shortage of skilled workers in the region.
2. High turnover rate: The department may have a high turnover rate due to various reasons such as poor working conditions, low pay, lack of career growth opportunities, or dissatisfaction with management. As a result, many employees may leave the department within a short period, leading to a gap between the required and actual strength.
3. Outsourcing work: The department may choose to outsource certain tasks or functions to external contractors or agencies, which can reduce the need for full-time employees. This can also lead to a decrease in the actual strength of the department.
4. Changes in organizational structure: The organization's structure may change over time, resulting in a shift in the number of employees required in each department. For example, if the organization decides to decentralize its operations, it may lead to a reduction in the number of employees needed in the central office.
5. Technological advancements: Advances in technology can automate certain tasks, reducing the need for manual labor. In this case, the department may require fewer employees to perform the same amount of work.
6. Economic downturn: An economic recession or depression can lead to reduced demand for goods and services, resulting in lower employment levels across industries. This can affect the number of employees required in the department as well.
7. Government policies: Government policies can impact the number of employees required in a particular department. For instance, if the government introduces new regulations or laws that make it easier to hire temporary or contractual staff, it may lead to a reduction in the number of permanent employees required in the department."

"Response:  The answer to your question is not straightforward as it depends on various factors such as the type of video game, the platform used for distribution, and the target audience. However, I can provide you with some general information that may help you estimate how much money Jordan Darroch could make from selling his two-hour VR game.

According to a report by Statista, the global virtual reality market size was valued at USD 7.5 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach USD 198.96 billion by 2025, growing at an annual rate of 43.6%. This growth is driven by advancements in technology, increasing adoption in gaming and entertainment, and rising investments in the industry.

Assuming that Jordan's VR game is a high-quality product with good reviews and a strong marketing strategy, he could potentially sell thousands of copies within the first few months of its release. Depending on the pricing strategy adopted, he could generate significant revenue from each sale.

Using rough estimates, if we assume that Jordan's VR game costs around $10 per copy (which is a reasonable price point considering the current market trends), and assuming he sells 10,000 copies within the first month alone, he could generate around $100,000 in revenue. If he continues to sell the game at this pace over several months, he could potentially earn millions of dollars in revenue.

However, it's important to note that these are just rough estimates, and there are many variables that could affect the actual revenue generated. Factors like competition, market demand, and the overall success of the game will play a crucial role in determining how well it performs in the market."

* If John uses two bricks to make a large box, he can make 25 large boxes (since each large box requires 2 bricks).
* If John uses three bricks to make a small box, he can make 16 small boxes (since each small box requires 3 bricks).
* If John uses 1/4 of a brick to make a tiny box, he can make 8 tiny boxes (since each tiny box requires 1/4 of a brick).

So, in total, John can make 25 + 25 + 16 + 8 = 74 boxes with 500 bricks."

"Response:  The number of times the word ""garaj"" appears in a sentence is not necessarily related to its frequency of use in natural language. For example, the word ""garaj"" may appear frequently in certain dialects or regional languages, but less frequently in standard Hindi or Marathi. Similarly, the word ""goriyal"" may be more commonly used in some regions than others, and so on. Therefore, it's difficult to make generalizations about the relative frequencies of these words based solely on their appearances in a single text corpus. However, if you have access to multiple corpora or texts from different regions and dialects, you could potentially analyze their usage patterns and identify any consistent trends or differences."

"Response:  The velocity of the two tractors is given by v1 = 2 m/s and v2 = 4 m/s. Let's assume that the distance between them is d = 400 meters. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we need to find the time it takes for one tractor to pass the other.

The relative speed between the two tractors is given by vrel = |v1 - v2| = 6 m/s. As the first tractor moves towards the second tractor at a speed of 2 m/s, the time taken for it to cover a distance of 400 meters is t1 = 60 seconds. Similarly, as the second tractor moves away from the first tractor at a speed of 4 m/s, the time taken for it to cover a distance of 400 meters is t2 = 30 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken for both tractors to move past each other is ttotal = t1 + t2 = 90 seconds."

"Response:  The answer is 12 liters.

Explanation:

The question asks for the amount of water that can be filled in 5 buckets and 6 buckets respectively. Since each bucket holds 1 liter of water, we need to multiply the number of buckets by the capacity of each bucket to get the total amount of water that can be filled.

For 5 buckets, the total amount of water that can be filled is 5 x 1 = 5 liters.

For 6 buckets, the total amount of water that can be filled is 6 x 1 = 6 liters.

Therefore, the answer is 12 liters (5 + 6)."

"Response:  The number of full laps in a race of distance 90 km can be calculated as follows:

Let the pace of the runner be x km/h. Then, the time taken to complete the race is given by:

Time = Distance / Pace
= 90 km / x km/h

Since there are 400 meters in a kilometer, we can convert the time from hours to minutes as follows:

Minutes = Time x 60
= (90 km / x km/h) x 60

Now, we need to find out how many full laps the runner has completed in this time. Since each lap is 400 meters long, and the runner has covered a total distance of 90 km, the number of full laps is:

Full laps = Total distance / Length of one lap
= 90 km / 400 m
= 225 laps

Therefore, the answer is 225 full laps."

Response:  The probability of getting a particular type of card from a deck of 52 cards is given by the formula: P(type of card) = number of cards of that type / total number of cards in the deck. Since there are 30 hearts, 20 diamonds, and 40 clubs in the deck, the probability of drawing each type of card is: P(heart) = 30/52, P(diamond) = 20/52, and P(club) = 40/52. Therefore, the probability of drawing any one of these three types of cards is (30+20+40)/52 = 90/52 = 1.73%.

"Response:  The answer is 250 calories.

Explanation:

Somavari and Sunita are two friends who have different eating habits. Somavari eats 5 kukis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, while Sunita eats 13 kukis on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. If Somavari eats 200 calories less than Sunita in a day, how many calories does Somavari eat in a day?

Solution:

Let's assume that Sunita eats x kukis in a day. Since Somavari eats 5 kukis less than Sunita, Somavari eats (x - 5) kukis in a day. Therefore, the total number of calories Somavari eats in a day is x + 5 = 200 calories more than Sunita. So, Somavari eats 250 calories in a day."
