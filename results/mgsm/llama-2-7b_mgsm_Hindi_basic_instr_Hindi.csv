Response:  The distance traveled by James in one week is given by the equation d = 3s + 20, where s is the number of sprinters he runs in a week and d is the total distance traveled. Since James runs three sprinters per day, we can write the equation as d = 3(3s) + 20. Now, since each sprint is 60 meters long, we can substitute this value into the equation to get d = 180 + 20 = 200 meters per week. Therefore, James travels a total distance of 200 meters per week.
"Response:  The number of caps of food that the vendor should give to each mouse in a day is given by the equation:

Number of caps = Total amount of food / Number of mice

In this case, the total amount of food available for the mice is 30 kg (as mentioned in the problem). There are 20 mice in the colony. Therefore, the number of caps of food that the vendor should give to each mouse can be calculated as follows:

Number of caps per mouse = Total amount of food / Number of mice
= 30 kg / 20 mice
= 1.5 kg/mouse/day

So, the vendor should give 1.5 kg of food to each mouse every day."

"Response:  The number of years it will take to break even on the investment in planting a neem tree can be calculated as follows:

Year 1: No income from the neem trees since they are just planted and have not started bearing fruit yet. Expenses = $90 (cost of planting one neem tree).

Year 2-7: Income from selling neem seeds is $1.5 per tree per year. Expenses = $3 (water and food for each tree). Total income = $18 ($1.5 x 12 trees).

Year 8-14: Income from selling neem seeds increases by 5% every year. Total income = $21 ($1.5 x 14 trees).

Year 15: Income from selling neem seeds reaches its maximum value of $24 ($1.5 x 16 trees).

Therefore, it will take approximately 15 years for the investment in planting one neem tree to break even.

Note: This calculation assumes that the cost of planting one neem tree remains constant at $90, and that there are no other expenses or income sources associated with the neem trees."

"Response:  If the investor chooses to invest in the high-risk stocks (electronic gadgets) and the market grows at a rate of 1.2% per month, then the total return on investment after one year will be:

Total Return = (Initial Investment x Monthly Growth Rate x Number of Months) / (1 + Monthly Growth Rate)^Number of Months
= ($5,000 x 1.2% x 12) / (1 + 1.2%)^12
= $6,374.92

If the investor chooses to invest in the low-risk stocks (real estate) and the market grows at a rate of 2.5% per month, then the total return on investment after one year will be:

Total Return = (Initial Investment x Monthly Growth Rate x Number of Months) / (1 + Monthly Growth Rate)^Number of Months
= ($8,000 x 2.5% x 12) / (1 + 2.5%)^12
= $9,571.43

Therefore, if the investor chooses to invest in the high-risk stocks, they can expect a higher return on their investment compared to the low-risk stocks. However, it's important to note that there is also a higher risk associated with investing in high-risk stocks, which could result in lower returns or even losses if the market does not perform as expected."

"Response:  The height of Mount Everest is approximately 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. To calculate the distance from the summit of Mount Everest to the base camp at an altitude of 5,364 meters (17,598 feet), we need to use the formula:

distance = height - initial altitude

In this case, the height of Mount Everest is 8,848 meters and the initial altitude of the base camp is 5,364 meters. Therefore, the distance between the summit of Mount Everest and the base camp is:

distance = 8,848 - 5,364 = 3,484 meters or 11,433 feet

So, the distance between the summit of Mount Everest and the base camp is approximately 3,484 meters or 11,433 feet."

"Response:  The information provided in the question is as follows:

* The calorie content of a chip bag is 250 calories per serving.
* If you have 300 grams of chips in one bag and there are 5 servings, then each serving contains 60 grams (300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams per serving).
* Your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories.
* You have already consumed 1800 calories before eating the chips.

To calculate how many grams of chips you can eat while maintaining your daily calorie goal, we need to subtract the number of calories you have already consumed from your total daily calorie goal. So, the calculation would be:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories remaining in your daily calorie goal.

Now, since each serving of chips contains 60 grams of calories, you can eat up to 200/60 = 3.33 bags of chips while maintaining your daily calorie goal."

"Response:  The total amount of money that Lord makes in a week is:

A) $104
B) $208
C) $312
D) $416
E) $520

Answer: C) $312.

Explanation:
Lord has 252 murgis and each murgi lays 2 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by Lord in a day is 252 x 2 = 504 eggs. Since Lord sells each egg for $2, the total revenue generated by Lord in a day is 504 x $2 = $1008.

"Response:  The maximum number of drums that can be loaded on a truck with a capacity of 3755 pounds is 24.

Explanation:
The volume of each drum is given as 15 cubic feet. To find the total volume of all the drums, we multiply the number of drums by their volume:

Number of drums = 24
Volume of each drum = 15 cubic feet
Total volume of drums = Number of drums x Volume of each drum
= 24 x 15 = 360 cubic feet

Since the capacity of the truck is 3755 pounds, we need to divide the total volume of drums by the capacity of the truck to find out how many drums can fit in the truck:

Number of drums that can fit in the truck = Total volume of drums / Capacity of the truck
= 360 / 3755 = 0.95

So, the maximum number of drums that can be loaded on a truck with a capacity of 3755 pounds is 24."

"Response: आर्टी के पास 12 बर्तन मैरीगोल्ड्स, 9 बर्तन पेटूनिया और 17 बर्तन बेगोनिया बेचता है, तो वह कितना कमाएगा?

Answer:

Artie sells three types of flowers - Marigold, Petunia, and Begonia. He charges $2.74, $1.87, and $2.12 per stem respectively. Artie has not made any changes to his prices today, so he has kept all the prices unchanged. If Artie sells 12 marigolds, 9 petunias, and 17 begonias, how much will he make in total?

Solution:

To find out how much Artie will make in total, we need to multiply the number of stems of each type he sells by its price.

Marigold: 12 x $2.74 = $32.88
Petunia: 9 x $1.87 = $16.53
Begonia: 17 x $2.12 = $35.84
Total: $32.88 + $16.53 + $35.84 = $85.25

Therefore, Artie will make a total of $85.25 if he sells 12 marigolds, 9 petunias, and 17 begonias."
"Response:  If a person is building a four-story reet mahal (a type of traditional Indian house) on the coastal area and he wants to know how much land will be submerged due to sea level rise, then we can use the following formula:

Land Submergence = Total height of each story x Number of stories x Sea Level Rise

For example, if the total height of each story is 16 feet (as mentioned in the question), and there are 4 stories, then the land submergence would be:

Land Submergence = 16 ft x 4 stories x Sea Level Rise

If the sea level rises by 1 foot, then the land submergence would be:

Land Submergence = 16 ft x 4 stories x 1 ft = 64 sq.ft

Therefore, the land submergence due to sea level rise would be 64 square feet."

"Response:  If Vincent buys three packets of flowers for $2.50 each or two packets for $1.00 each, he will save money by buying in bulk. To find out how much money he will save, we need to calculate the cost per flower of each option and compare them.

Option 1: Buying three packets of flowers for $2.50 each
Cost per packet = $2.50 / 3 packets = $0.83 per packet

Option 2: Buying two packets of flowers for $1.00 each
Cost per packet = $1.00 / 2 packets = $0.50 per packet

Since the cost per packet is lower in Option 2 ($0.50) than in Option 1 ($0.83), it makes more sense for Vincent to buy two packets of flowers for $1.00 each instead of three packets for $2.50 each. By doing so, he will save a total of $1.67 (=$0.83 - $0.50)."

"Response:  The time taken by Gerald to reach the destination can be calculated as follows:

Let's assume that Gerald's speed before and after the modification of his bike are constant at 40 km/h. Therefore, the distance traveled by him in 38 seconds is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 40 km/h x 38 s = 1520 m

Now, we need to find out how much faster Lee can travel than Gerald. Let's assume that Lee's speed is 40 km/h + (10% of 40 km/h) = 44 km/h.

Therefore, the time taken by Lee to cover a distance of 400 meters is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 400 m / (44 km/h - 40 km/h) = 9.57 s

So, Lee can cover a distance of 400 meters in 9.57 seconds, which is 4.63 seconds faster than Gerald."

Explanation:
The first friend dabbled in Jerome's door 20 times before opening it, and then the second friend dabbled 1/4 of that amount (which is 5 times) in Jerome's door. Therefore, the total number of times the first two friends dabbled in Jerome's door is 20 + 5 = 25.
Now, the third friend dabbled 10 times more than the second friend (i.e., 10 x 5 = 50), so the total number of times all three friends dabbled in Jerome's door is 25 + 50 = 75.
Finally, if the fourth friend dabbled 60 times, then the total number of times all four friends dabbled in Jerome's door is 75 + 60 = 135."

"Response:  If a gasoline station is selling gas at $3 per gallon and an app company is offering a discount of $20 per gallon for users who download their app, then the amount of gas that can be purchased with $10 will depend on the number of gallons that can be bought with that amount.

Let's assume that the app company offers a discount of $20 per gallon for every 10 gallons of gas purchased. So, if someone buys 10 gallons of gas, they will get a discount of $200 ($20 x 10 gallons). Therefore, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after the discount would be $28 ($3 x 10 gallons) - $200 = $-112.

Now, let's calculate how much gas can be purchased with $10 using this formula:

$10 / (-$112) = approximately 90 gallons

So, with $10, you could buy approximately 90 gallons of gas at the discounted price of $20 per gallon."

"Response:  The profit that she will make by selling all the boards can be calculated as follows:

Total cost of 10 x 2x4x10 = $1000
Total revenue from sale of 10 boards = $1000 x 10 = $10,000
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $10,000 - $1000 = $9000

Similarly, for the remaining 30 boards, the total cost is:

Total cost of 30 x 2x4x10 = $3000
Total revenue from sale of 30 boards = $3000 x 30 = $90,000
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $90,000 - $3000 = $87,000

Therefore, the total profit that she will make by selling all the boards is:

Response:  If the salary of Edrian was $60,000 four years ago and it increased by 20% every year, then his current salary would be $84,000. Therefore, if he worked for three years after that, his total income over those five years would be $168,000 ($84,000 x 5). Now, if we compare this amount with Lilah's total income of $192,000 over the same period, we can see that Edrian earned $24,000 less than Lilah during that time. So, their combined total income over those five years would be $356,000 ($168,000 + $192,000).

Response:  Mark answered 75 questions in the first exam and spent 8 hours on it. He then took a break of 2 hours before taking the second exam, which had 100 questions. If he spent 6 hours on the second exam, how many questions did he skip? Solution: Let's assume that Mark skipped x questions in the second exam. Since he spent 6 hours on the exam, we can write an equation: Total time taken = Number of questions answered + Number of questions skipped Now, we know that Mark answered 75 questions in the first exam and 30 (since he skipped 45) in the second exam. So, we have: Total time taken for first exam = 8 hours Total time taken for second exam = 6 hours - 2 hours = 4 hours Number of questions answered in second exam = 75 + 30 = 105 Questions skipped by Mark in second exam = 105 - 30 = 75 Therefore, Mark skipped 75 questions in the second exam.

"Response:  The amount of money that Elvira can afford to spend on the computer components depends on several factors such as her income, expenses, and savings. Let's assume that she has a monthly income of $3,000 (INR 2 lakhs) after taxes.

Expenses:

* Rent: $800 (INR 60,000) per month
* Utilities (electricity, water, gas): $150 (INR 10,000) per month
* Groceries: $300 (INR 20,000) per month

"Response:  The total amount of money that Jai has after paying all his expenses and donations can be calculated as follows:

1. Firstly, let's calculate the monthly income of Jai. Since he works for 30 days in a month, his monthly salary is:

$200 x 30 = $6,000 per month

So, Jai's monthly income is $6,000.

2. Next, let's calculate the expenses of Jai. He spends $400 on groceries, $200 on transportation, and $500 on entertainment, which comes to a total of:

$400 + $200 + $500 = $1,100 per month

So, Jai's total monthly expenses are $1,100.

3. Now, let's calculate the amount of money that Jai gives away as donations. He gives $200 to his wife every month, and $100 to his daughter, which comes to a total of:

$200 + $100 = $300 per month

So, Jai gives away $300 as donations every month.

4. Finally, let's subtract Jai's total expenses from his total monthly income to find out how much money he has left over:

$6,000 - $1,100 = $4,900 per month

So, Jai has $4,900 left over after paying all his expenses and donations."

Explanation:

From the given information, we know that there are 40 reservoirs in a certain city and each reservoir can hold 2 pounds of gasoline. Since there are 200 pounds of gasoline available for distribution among these 40 reservoirs, the total amount of gasoline that each reservoir can hold is 200 / 40 = 5 pounds per reservoir.

Now, since each reservoir can hold 2 pounds of gasoline, the total number of reservoirs required to store 160 pounds of gasoline is 160 / 2 = 80 reservoirs. Therefore, 80 reservoirs will not be used to store gasoline, as they would exceed their capacity."

The total amount of money that they will have to pay as rent is given by the formula: Rent = Price per hour x Time taken. So, in this case, the total rent that Carlos and Benji will have to pay is: Rent = $18/hour x 3 hours + $30/hour x 5 hours = $276 + $150 = $426. Therefore, the total amount that they will have to pay as rent is $426.

"Response:  The probability of choosing a card from the deck that is either water or fire is 16/52 = 0.307.

Explanation:

The probability of choosing any particular type of card from the deck is equal to the number of cards of that type divided by the total number of cards in the deck. In this case, there are 30 cards of the earth element, 20 cards of the air element, and 40 cards of the fire element. Therefore, the probability of choosing a card of each type is:

Probability of choosing an earth card = 30/52 = 0.577
Probability of choosing an air card = 20/52 = 0.385
Probability of choosing a fire card = 40/52 = 0.769

Since Jamie has already chosen 8 water cards and 14 earth cards, the remaining probabilities are updated as follows:

Probability of choosing a water card = 8/52 = 0.156
Probability of choosing an earth card = 14/52 = 0.277
Probability of choosing a fire card = 40 - (8 + 14) = 38 = 0.737

Now, let's calculate the probability of Jamie choosing a card of any particular type given that he has already chosen some cards of that type:

Probability of choosing a water card = 8/52 = 0.156
Probability of choosing an earth card = 14/52 = 0.277
Probability of choosing a fire card = 40/52 = 0.737

So, if Jamie chooses another card from the deck, the probability of it being either water, earth, or fire is:

Probability of choosing any one of these three types = 0.156 + 0.277 + 0.737 = 1.160

Therefore, the probability of Jamie choosing a card of any particular type is approximately 1.160."

"Response:  The person buys 12 cars for his company and each car costs $20,000. He gives a discount of 10% on each car and spends an additional $1000 on each car for maintenance. Therefore, the total amount spent by him is:

Total cost of 12 cars = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000
Discount given on each car = 10% of $20,000 = $2,000
Maintenance cost per car = $1,000
Total amount spent by him = Total cost of cars + Discount given + Maintenance cost
= $240,000 + $2,000 + $12,000
= $254,000"

"Response:  The man can write 120 pages in a week.

Explanation:
The man can write one page in 6 minutes, and he writes two pages every day with his five friends. Therefore, he can write 14 pages (2 x 7) in a week. Since each page is long, let's assume it is 5 inches wide and 8 inches tall, so the area of each page is 5 x 8 = 40 square inches. Now, since there are 7 days in a week, the total area written by him in a week is 40 x 7 = 280 square inches. Finally, dividing the total area by the number of hours in a week (43,200 minutes), we get the answer - 120 pages per week."

"Response:  The artist made $250 per hour.

Explanation:

The artist was paid $250 per hour for the film shoot. Since he worked for 6 hours a day and 7 days a week, his total earnings were $250 x 6 x 7 = $15,000 per week. Since the film took 5 weeks to complete, the artist earned a total of $15,000 x 5 = $75,000. However, due to the low quality of work, the artist received a discount of 10%, which means he lost $7,500 ($75,000 x 10%). Therefore, the artist earned $75,000 - $7,500 = $67,500."

Let's assume the number of cups of rice consumed by Su's wife on each day is x. Since Su has 4 more cups than his wife, the number of cups of rice consumed by Su on each day is x + 4.

On Somvar, Su ate half as much as his wife, so he consumed (x + 4) / 2 cups of rice.

On Mangalwar, Su also consumed half as much as his wife, so he consumed (x + 4) / 2 cups of rice again.

Therefore, the total number of cups of rice consumed by Su in 5 days is:
(x + 4) / 2 × 5 = 75

So, Su ate 75 cups of rice in 5 days."
