"Response:  To find out how much money Janet makes at the farmers' market each day, we need to subtract the number of eggs she eats and bakes from the total number of eggs she lays.

Let's break it down step by step:

* Janet lays 16 eggs per day.
* She eats 3 eggs for breakfast (per day).
* She bakes 4 muffins per day using 4 eggs each.
* Total number of eggs used = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

Now, let's calculate the remaining eggs available for sale at the farmers' market:

Remaining eggs = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs per day.

So, Janet can sell 9 eggs per day at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, which means she makes a total of:

$2 x 9 eggs/day = $18 per day at the farmers' market."
Response:  The answer is 3 bolts.
Response:  To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to subtract the cost of the repairs from the new value of the house. So, if the new value of the house is $230,000 (150% of $80,000), and the cost of the repairs was $50,000, then Josh made a profit of $180,000 ($230,000 - $50,000).
Response:  To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint. Since James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, he runs a total of 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week. The distance of each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance James runs in a week is 9 x 60 = 540 meters. Therefore, James runs 540 meters per week.
Response:  To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day for a flock of 20 chickens, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that every day, Wendi feeds her chickens 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per bird, so for a flock of 20 chickens, she will need to feed them a total of 60 cups of feed (3 cups x 20 birds).
Response:  The total cost of 16 glasses can be calculated as follows: For the first glass, the cost is $5. For each additional glass, the cost is 60% of the previous glass's cost. So, the cost of the second glass is $5 x 60% = $3. The cost of the third glass is $5 x 60% = $3, and so on... Therefore, the total cost of 16 glasses is: $5 + $3 + $2.70 +... + $2.70 = $84.
Response:  To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 4 = 8 sheep. We also know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 8 + 80 + 20 = 128 sheep.
"Response:  To find out how long it will take Carla to download the file after the restart, we need to calculate the total time it took her to download the file before the restart and add the time she spent on the restart.
Before the restart, Carla downloaded 40% of the file in 20 minutes, so the total time it took her to download 40% of the file is:
20 minutes / 40% = 50 minutes
After the restart, Carla had to start over from the beginning, so the time it will take her to finish downloading the remaining 60% of the file is:
(60% - 40%) / 2 GB/minute = 120 minutes
Therefore, the total time it will take Carla to download the entire 200 GB file after the restart is:
50 minutes + 120 minutes = 170 minutes = 2 hours and 70 minutes."
"Response:  To find out how far John is from home after 4 hours of driving, we need to calculate the distance traveled during each leg of his journey and add them up.

1. The first 3 hours of driving:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles
2. The second 2 hours of driving (in standstill traffic):
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 2 hours = 60 miles
Total distance traveled during these 4 hours = Distance = 180 + 60 = 240 miles

Therefore, John is 240 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
"Response:  To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular hourly earnings and then add her overtime pay.
Regular hourly earnings = $10/hour x 40 hours = $400
Overtime pay = $400 x 1.2 = $480
Total earnings = Regular hourly earnings + Overtime pay = $400 + $480 = $880
Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $880."
Response:  To find out how many downloads the program had over the three months, we need to use the information given in the problem. In the first month, there were 60 downloads. In the second month, there were 3 times as many downloads as in the first month, which is 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. Then, in the third month, there was a reduction of 30%, which means that the number of downloads decreased by 30% of the previous month's downloads. So, in the third month, there were 180 - (30/100) x 180 = 126 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.
Response:  The total cost is $497.
"Response:  To determine how long it will take before Carlos starts earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate its annual income and compare it to its annual expenses.

Annual Income = Number of Lemons x Selling Price per Lemon
= 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon
= $10.50 per year

Annual Expenses = Watering and Feeding Costs + Initial Planting Cost
= $3 per year (watering and feeding) + $90 initial planting cost
= $93 per year

Since the annual income ($10.50) is less than the annual expenses ($93), it will take Carlos at least 9 years to start earning money from his lemon tree. Therefore, the answer is 9 years."
"Response:  To find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she had x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling some there. Then, she sold 2 more to the red house, so she had x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left after that. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she had (x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left after that. Since she now has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

(x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, Melanie started with 9 vacuum cleaners."
"Response:  To find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to calculate the total number of students who did not enroll in contemporary or jazz dance.

Total number of students - Number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance = 80% (since 20% enrolled in contemporary dance)
Total number of students - Number of students who enrolled in jazz dance = 75% (since 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance)
Total number of students - Total number of students who enrolled in both contemporary and jazz dance = 100% - (20 + 25) = 65% (since 20% enrolled in contemporary dance and 25% enrolled in jazz dance)

Now, let's find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:
Percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance = Total number of students - Number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance - Number of students who enrolled in jazz dance = 100% - 20% - 75% = 45%

Therefore, 45% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
Response:  To determine the maximum profit for the merchant, we need to calculate the expected value of each option and then compare them. Let's assume the probability of the jewelry market going up 2.5% is p = 0.4 and the probability of the electronic gadgets market rising 1.2% is q = 0.6. The expected value of the jewelry option can be calculated as follows: E(J) = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025)^1 = $5,375 The expected value of the electronic gadgets option can be calculated similarly: E(G) = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012)^1 = $8,368 Now, let's compare these two options based on their expected values: Option J has an expected value of $5,375, while Option G has an expected value of $8,368. Therefore, if the merchant chooses Option J, they are expected to make a profit of $5,375 - $8,000 = -$2,625. On the other hand, if the merchant chooses Option G, they are expected to make a profit of $8,368 - $5,000 = $3,368. Since the expected profit from Option G is higher than that of Option J, the merchant should choose Option G to maximize their profits.
Response:  Let's call the distance traveled by Train A on Day 1 x and the distance traveled by Train B on Day 1 y. On Day 2, Train A covers z miles and Train B covers w miles. We know that x + y = 80 (the total distance traveled on Day 1) and z + w = 150 (the total distance traveled on Day 2). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us: x = 40, y = 30, z = 60, and w = 90. So Train A traveled 40 miles on Day 1 and 60 miles on Day 2, while Train B traveled 30 miles on Day 1 and 90 miles on Day 2.
Response:  To find Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply the number of hours she works each week by the rate she is paid for each activity. For teaching, she works 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week. For coaching, she works 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week. So, her total weekly income is $700 + $450 = $1,150/week. Since she works 50 weeks/year, her annual salary is $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year.
Response:  To find out how many dozen eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she eats per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. Since Claire makes a 3 egg omelette every morning, she eats 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week. Therefore, she will eat 21 x 28 = 568 eggs in 4 weeks. So, Claire will eat 568 / 12 = 48 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.
Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles and the time taken so far is 3 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles + 1 hour for the next 2 miles). So, Marissa's average speed needed to complete the remaining distance of 6 miles is: Average Speed = 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles/hour.
Response:  The total amount of liquid is 35 liters (10 + 15 = 25). Since you spilled one liter, there are now 24 liters left. So, the answer is 24 liters.
Response:  Raymond's son was born 4 years ago.
"Response:  To find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to add up the number of DVDs bought by each customer.
The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 4 DVDs.
The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so they contributed nothing to the total.
Therefore, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs."
Response:  The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
Response:  The original price of the book was $26.87 ($19.50 x 1.25).
Response:  To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to subtract the cost of all the other items from the total amount she paid. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, so let's subtract that first: $50 - $12 = $38. Then, we can subtract the cost of the milk (5 x $3 = $15), the apples ($4 x 4 = $16), and finally the pizza (8 x $8.50 = $68): $38 - $15 - $16 - $68 = $0. So, Marie did not order any boxes of pizza!
"Response:  To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to add up the cost of each item that she bought. The total cost is:
$16.50 + $22.50 + $42 = $80.00
So, Mishka spent $80.00 on all the clothing items."
"Response:  To find out how much Cynthia spends on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes during that time and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Total number of servings = Number of days x Number of servings per day
= 60 x 1
= 60 servings

Cost per serving = Cost per carton / Number of servings per carton
= $4.00 / 15
= $0.27 per serving

Total amount spent on ice cream = Total number of servings x Cost per serving
= 60 x $0.27
= $16.20

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent $16.20 on ice cream."
Response:  The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 35 miles (20 + 15).
Response:  The price of the boots is $70 - ($5 + $33 + $2 \* $33) = $70 - $145 = $75.
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question that the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. We can write this as a proportion:

Darrell's age = 7x
Allen's age = 11x

where x is a constant. Since their total age now is 162, we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Simplifying the equation, we get:

18x = 162

Dividing both sides by 18, we get:

x = 9

So Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 109"
Response:  The average of their guesses is (80 + 20 + 25%) / 3 = 147.
Response:  To find out how many hours per week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to walk and take care of each dog's business per day. Since there are 10 dogs, John spends 10 x.5 = 5 hours per day taking care of them. Therefore, John spends 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week taking care of the dogs.
Response:  Gretchen has 42 gold coins.
Response:  According to the problem statement, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 38 jewels (Aaron has 40 - 2 = 38). We also know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so half of Raymond's jewels is 20 (since Aaron has 5 more than this amount). Therefore, Raymond has 40 jewels (as stated in the problem).
"Response:  To find out how many points Mike scored in total, we need to calculate the number of points he scored in each half and then add them up.
In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he scored a total of 4 x 2 = 8 points in this half.
In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first half, which means he scored (8 x 1.25) = 10 points in this half.
So, in total, Mike scored 8 + 10 = 18 points."
"Response:  To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the cost of each yogurt and then multiply it by the number of yogurts he buys in a month. Let's do that:

Cost of one yogurt = $5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt
Terry buys 2 yogurts a day, so he buys a total of 60 yogurts in a month (2 x 30 days).
Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt in a month ($1.25 x 60 yogurts).

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
Response:  John still has 7 Lego sets after selling all of them.
"Response:  To find out how fast John runs, we need to know his running speed for each day of the week. Since he runs for half as long on the other two days, his total time running is:

60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day

So, John's running speed is:

Time taken to run 20 miles x Speed in miles/hour = 20 miles / 1 hour = 20 miles/hour

Therefore, John runs at a pace of 20 miles per hour."
"Response:  Let's first calculate the total distance traveled by Dana during the six hours:

Running speed = 4x faster than walking speed = 4 x 3 mph = 12 mph
Walking speed = 1/2 the rate of skipping = 1/2 x 3 mph = 1.5 mph
Total distance traveled = Running + Walking = 12 mph x 6 h = 72 mi

Now, let's find out how much time Dana spends running and walking:

Time spent running = Total distance / Running speed = 72 mi / 12 mph = 6 h
Time spent walking = Total distance / Walking speed = 72 mi / 1.5 mph = 48 h

So, Dana spends 6 hours running and 48 hours walking. Now we can find out how far she travels in each mode:

Distance traveled while running = Time spent running x Speed = 6 h x 12 mph = 72 mi
Distance traveled while walking = Time spent walking x Speed = 48 h x 1.5 mph = 72 mi

Therefore, Dana travels a total distance of 72 miles in six hours, with 6 hours spent running at a rate of 12 miles per hour and 48 hours spent walking at a rate of 1.5 miles per hour."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone, which means that Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.
"Response:  To determine the maximum distance from which Polly can hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the additional throwing distance provided by the gemstone.

The formula for calculating the distance traveled by an object under thrown is given by:
distance = (initial velocity x time) / 2

Since Polly throws the javelin with an initial velocity of 30 feet per second (fps), and the flight time of the javelin is approximately 2 seconds, the total distance traveled by the javelin is:
distance = (30 fps x 2 s) / 2 = 60 feet

Now, let's assume that Polly holds the sapphire gemstone during the throw, which increases her throwing power by 30%. This means that the distance traveled by the javelin would be increased by 30% as well. So, the new distance traveled by the javelin becomes:
distance = (30 fps x 2 s) / 2 x 1.3 = 98 feet

Therefore, if Polly stands at a distance of 98 feet or more from the dragon when she throws the javelin, she will be able to hit it with the gold javelin even when holding the sapphire gemstone."
Response:  The number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 7 (5 - 14 = 7).
"Response:  To determine the number of grams of chips that you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories you have already consumed, we need to calculate the remaining calories available for the day.

First, let's convert the amount of calories in the bag of chips from calories per serving to total calories in the bag:

250 calories/serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories in the bag (based on the assumption that each serving contains 250 calories)

Now, let's subtract the number of calories you have already consumed (1800) from the total calories available for the day:

1250 - 1800 = -550 calories remaining for the day

Since negative numbers are not possible, we will round down to zero calories remaining for the day. Therefore, you can eat up to 0 grams of chips based on your current calorie balance."
"Response:  To find out how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax, we need to divide the weight of the beeswax by the weight of a single candle. Since each candle weighs 1/4 pound (or 8 ounces), we can calculate the number of candles as follows:

Number of candles = Weight of beeswax / Weight of a single candle
= 1 lb / 8 oz
= 12.5 candles

Since Charlie can make 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax, he can make 12.5 x 10 = 125 candles from one pound of beeswax.

To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to subtract the cost of the supplies ($10) from the total revenue generated by selling all 20 candles ($2 x 20 = $40). Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Supplies
= $40 - $10
= $30

So, Charlie's net profit is $30 for making and selling 20 candles using one pound of beeswax."
"Response:  To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information provided in the question.

Day 1 (Monday):
Meredith wrote 5 articles, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours researching and writing articles on Monday.

Day 2 (Tuesday):
Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote 2/5 x 5 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article took 4 hours to write, Meredith spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours researching and writing articles on Tuesday.

Day 3 (Wednesday):
Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means she wrote 2 x 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday. Since each article took 4 hours to write, Meredith spent 14 x 4 = 56 hours researching and writing articles on Wednesday.

Total time spent writing articles in the three days = 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours."
Response:  The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 58. To find this answer, we need to subtract the number of Post-it notes that Candice already had (80) from the total number of Post-it notes that she used (230). This gives us 150, which is the number of Post-it notes that must have been in the package. Since there are 58 Post-it notes in a standard pack, we know that the package contained exactly 58 Post-it notes.
"Response:  To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So if he bought x blue ties, he also bought 2x red ties.
2. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So if a blue tie costs $40, a red tie costs $40 + (50% of $40), or $40 + $20 = $60.
3. John spent $200 on ties. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he spent half of his money on red ties ($200 / 2) = $100 on red ties and $100 on blue ties.

Therefore, John spent $100 on blue ties and $100 on red ties, for a total of $200."
Response:  To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the length of the wire by the length of each piece. In this case, the length of the wire is 4 feet (which is equal to 48 inches), and the length of each piece is 6 inches. So, Tracy obtained 48 / 6 = 8 pieces of wire.
Response:  The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 72 (15 x 8 x 3/4).
Response:  To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs he sells per week. We can do this by multiplying the number of eggs he produces per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). So, the total number of eggs Lloyd sells per week is: 252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week Now, let's calculate the amount of money Lloyd makes from selling these eggs. Since he sells each egg for $2, the total amount of money he makes from selling eggs per week is: 1,764 eggs/week x $2/egg = $3,528 per week Therefore, Lloyd makes $3,528 per week on his egg farm.
Response:  To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate. We know that the distance he traveled was 2 miles (from 1 to 4 PM), and his rate was 10 miles per hour during the trip. So, if he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, the time it will take him to get back is: Time = 2 miles / 6 miles/hour = 3 hours. Therefore, it will take Tom 3 hours to get back.
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that the total weight of Uriah's book bag is 15 pounds, and that the comic books weigh 1/4 pound each. So, if he removes 30 comic books, their combined weight is 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. This means that the remaining weight in the book bag is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since the toys weigh 1/2 pound each, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 toys to bring the weight of his book bag back down to 15 pounds.
Response:  To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to subtract the total amount earned from repairing truck tires on Thursday ($60 x 6 = $360) from the total amount earned from repairing car tires on both days ($40 x 12 = $480). Therefore, the difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $360 = $120. So, the mechanic earned $120 more revenue on Friday than he did on Thursday.
Response:  The Doubtfire family currently has a total of 30 kittens (15 from Patchy and 15 from Trixie).
Response:  To determine how many bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops, we need to divide the number of lollipops left (30 - 2 = 28) by the number of lollipops that will be packaged per bag (2). Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.
Response:  Peter can go to the movies 6 times if he has 42 dollars for the week.
"Response:  To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight limit of the bridge.
The weight of the truck and the driver = 3755 pounds
The total weight limit of the bridge = 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds
Now, we can divide the remaining weight limit by the weight of a single box (15 pounds) to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck:
Number of boxes that can be loaded = Remaining weight limit / Weight of a single box = 1245 pounds / 15 pounds = 83 boxes
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83 boxes."

Total cost: $1,478
Therefore, Janet paid $1,478 for the brooch."
"Response:  The annual pension for Marcy can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the present value of the pension at the end of Year 20:
Present Value = $50,000 / (1 + 5%)^20 = $786,951
2. Calculate the annual pension starting from Year 21 to Year 30:
Annual Pension = Present Value / Number of Years = $786,951 / 10 = $78,695
3. Add the annual pension from Year 21 to Year 30:
Total Annual Pension = $78,695 x 10 = $786,950

Therefore, Marcy's total annual pension after 30 years of service is $786,950."
Response:  To find out how much Aleena has paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the initial payment and the discounted payment in the second half of the year. Let's assume the initial payment is $140 x 6 = $840. In the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less, which means they charged her ($840 / 10) = $84 x 6 = $496. Therefore, the total amount Aleena has paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $496 = $1336.
"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total amount of gas in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling up. We can do this by using the following formula:

distance = (gas in tank / number of miles driven) x 12

In Sophia's case, the total amount of gas in her tank is 12 gallons, and she has driven 100 miles since last filling up. So, we can plug these values into the formula like this:

distance = (12 / 100) x 12 = 1440 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 1440 miles on a single tank of gas."
Response:  To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the total number of hours he spends on these activities each week. Since he watches TV for 2 hours and reads for half that time (i.e., 1 hour), he spends a total of 3 hours per week on these activities. Now, since he does this 3 times a week, he spends a total of 9 hours per week on TV and reading. To find out how many hours he spends on these activities in 4 weeks, we multiply the total weekly hours by 4: 9 hours/week x 4 weeks = 36 hours. Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours watching TV and reading in 4 weeks.
"Response:  To find out how many people have been sent by all of the schools, we need to add up the number of players on each team from each school. Let's do that:
Girls' teams:
School A: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
School B: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
School C: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
School D: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
Total number of players on girls' teams: 40 players
Boys' teams:
School A: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
School B: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
School C: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
School D: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
Total number of players on boys' teams: 40 players
Now let's count the number of coaches:
Each school has one coach for each team, so there are 4 coaches in total.
So, in total, all of the schools have sent:
40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people
Therefore, the answer is 44 people."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* The treasure hunter found 175 diamonds.
* There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.
* Twice the number of emeralds as rubies means that there are 2 x 140 = 280 emeralds.

So, in total, there were 175 + 140 + 280 = 695 gems in the treasure chest."
Response:  Let x be the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2x. The total number of students is 60 + (5x - 5) = 60 + 5x - 10. Since there are 5 students per teacher, we can set up the equation: 5x - 10 = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, there are 4 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.
Response:  To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of money she received during the 8-week period from her final balance of $100. So, Bailey started with $90 ($100 - $5 x 8).
"Response:  To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to multiply the number of classes she teaches by the number of students in each class and then multiply that result by the cost per student. So, if Judy teaches 5 classes on weekdays (Monday through Friday) and 8 classes on Saturday, she will have a total of:

5 classes x 15 students/class = 75 students/weekday
8 classes x 15 students/class = 120 students/Saturday

So, in one week, Judy will have taught a total of:
75 students/weekday x $15.00/student = $1,125.00/weekday
120 students/Saturday x $15.00/student = $1,800.00/Saturday

Therefore, Judy makes a total of $1,125.00 + $1,800.00 = $3,925.00 in one week."
Response:  To prepare both dishes, Kelian needs to read a total of 40 instructions.
Response:  To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of brownies he sold by the price per slice and the number of cheesecakes he sold by the price per slice. For the brownies, that's 43 x $3 = $129. For the cheesecakes, it's 23 x $4 = $92. So, in total, Tommy raises $221.
Response:  To find out how much Sheila will pay each month for 3 months, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then subtract the amount she paid as down payment. The formula for calculating the monthly installments is: M = P / (r x n), where M is the monthly installment, P is the purchase price, r is the annual interest rate divided by 12, and n is the number of months in the loan period. In this case, the purchase price is $150 per phone, so the total cost for all 5 phones is $750 ($150 x 5). If Sheila paid a 2% interest on each phone, the annual interest rate is 2/100 or 0.02. Since there are 3 months in the loan period, we divide the annual interest rate by 12 to get the monthly interest rate, which is 0.02/12 = 0.00167. Now we can use the formula above to calculate the monthly installment: M = $750 / (0.00167 x 3) = $54.54 per month. Therefore, Sheila will pay $54.54 per month for 3 months to buy the 5 cell phones.
Response:  To find out how much Artie will make from selling these flowers, we need to multiply the number of pots sold by the price of each type of flower rounded to the nearest dollar. For marigolds, this is: Marigold sales = 12 x $1 = $12 For petunias, this is: Petunia sales = 9 x $1 = $9 For begonias, this is: Begonia sales = 17 x $1 = $17 So, in total, Artie will make $30 ($12 + $9 + $17).
"Response:  The average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle can be calculated by dividing the total square footage of all levels by the number of levels. In this case, if the top level has a square footage of 16 and there are 4 levels in total, then the average square footage of a level would be:

Average square footage = (16 / 4) = 4 square feet

Therefore, the answer to the question is 4 square feet."
"Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs and divide it by the number of cups per bag. Let's do that:
Total number of cups of dog food needed = 1 cup/day x 180 days + 2 cups/day x remaining days = 180 + (365 - 180) = 485 cups
Since there are 110 cups per bag, Cecilia will use:
Number of bags = Total cups / Cups per bag = 485 / 110 = 4.4 bags
So, Cecilia will use approximately 4.4 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. Let's analyze it step by step:

1. If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Sarah does twice as much laundry as Raymond. So, Sarah does 2 x 400 = 800 pounds of laundry.
2. If Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 1/4 of what Sarah does. So, David does 800 / 4 = 200 pounds of laundry.
3. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 800 - 200 = 600 pounds.

So, the answer to the question is 600 pounds."
Response:  To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of 18 flowers at each price. At $2.50 per package of 3 flowers, the total cost would be: 18 x $2.50 = $45.00. And at $1.00 per package of 2 flowers, the total cost would be: 18 x $1.00 = $18.00. So, by buying 18 flowers at the better price, Vincent saves $27.00 ($45.00 - $18.00).
Response:  $70

"Response:  To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses on each bush and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose. Here's how we can do this calculation:

1. Multiply the number of rose bushes (3) by the number of roses on each bush (25): 3 x 25 = 75 roses.
2. Multiply the number of roses (75) by the number of thorns per rose (8): 75 x 8 = 600 thorns.

Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total."
Response:  The team won 10 games.
Response:  To find the number of quilt blocks that Gene has, we need to calculate the number of blocks for each year of vacations and then add them up. Since Gene goes on four vacations per year, he will have 4 x 21 = 84 blocks in total by the time he is 34 years old.
"Response:  The alarm rang a total of 12 times. Here's how we can calculate that:

1. First time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. Second time the alarm went off, it rang for 3x longer than the first time = 4 x 3 = 12 times.
3. Third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time = 12 / 3 = 4 times.

So, the alarm rang a total of 4 + 12 + 4 = 18 times."
"Response:  To find out Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary at the end of each year based on the given conditions:
Year 1 (just completed): Salary = $600 x 1.1 = $660
Year 2: Salary = $660 x 1.1 = $732
Year 3: Salary = $732 x 1.1 = $804
Therefore, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $804."
"Response:  To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to divide the total number of copies sold by 10. So, if Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, and they sold a total of 88,000 copies, then Harald sold:

88,000 / 10 = 8,800 copies

Therefore, Harald sold 8,800 copies of his record."
Response:  To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags she will need. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, she will actually need (16 x 0.75) = 12 gift bags. So, Christina will spend $2 x 12 = $24 on gift bags.
"Response:  To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we can use the information provided in the problem. We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed is:

20 x 10 = 200 lbs (adults) + 5 x 5 = 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
Response:  The three girls have a total of 12 pets.
Response:  Jackson is 7 years old.
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Gerald's diet improvement will improve his time in the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run it 2 seconds faster than Gerald, if Lee now runs it in 38 seconds, then Gerald ran it in 40 seconds (since he is 2 seconds slower). So, if Gerald improves his diet by 10%, his new time for running the 400-meter hurdles will be:

40 seconds x 1.10 = 44 seconds

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 44 seconds."
"Response:  Let's start by using the information that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, if we let D be the number of dogs and C be the number of cats, we can write:

D + C = 12 (less than)

We also know that there are two cats for every dog, so we can write:

C = 2D

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use these equations to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood?"
Response:  There are 160 girls in total (2/3 x 100). Therefore, there are 40 girls who are not in the Girl Scouts (200 - 160 = 40).
"Response:  To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to subtract the number of hours that James slept from the number of hours that Harry slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate this as follows:
Harry slept 9 hours = 9 x 3 = 27 hours
James slept 2/3 of 27 hours = 18 hours (since 2/3 of 27 is equal to 18)
So, Harry slept 9 - 18 = 11 more hours than James."
Response:  To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the volume of the sauce by the volume of each tomato. Since each can of tomatoes makes 3 tomatoes and there are 32 ounces of sauce, we can calculate as follows: Number of tomatoes = Volume of sauce / Volume of one tomato = 32 ounces / 3 ounces per can = 10 cans of tomatoes Therefore, Freda used 10 cans of tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce.
"Response:  The number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 10. Here's how we can calculate it:

At first, 20 cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam (since 20 - 15 = 5). Then, 10 cars drive through in the first 15 minutes (since 30 / 2 = 15, and 10 is the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes). Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 20 + 10 = 30 cars."
Response:  Mary will remain with 36 potted plants after giving away 18 new ones to friends and family.
Response:  Let X be the total number of doorbell rings. According to the problem, the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, so X = 20. Since the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, the second friend pressed the doorbell 5 times (since 1/4 = 5). So, the total number of doorbell rings up until the second friend pressed the button is X + 5 = 25. Then, the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means they pressed it 70 times (since 10 > 60). Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings after the third friend pressed the button is X + 5 + 70 = 95. Finally, since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we add that to our total and get X + 5 + 70 + 60 = 195. Thus, there were 195 doorbell rings in total.
Response:  To find out how many pages Solo needs to read each day, we can divide the total number of pages he needs to read by the number of days he has left to finish his reading. In this case, Solo needs to read a total of 69 pages (4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 69). Since he already read 15 pages on Monday, he has 54 pages left to read (69 - 15 = 54). Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of 54/5 = 10.8 pages per day to finish all his reading within the given time frame.
Response:  John drinks 7 glasses of water in a week (Monday-Friday) + 1 glass of water before going to bed = 8 glasses of water per week.
"Response:  The time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city can be calculated as follows:

1. Divide the distance of the city (in miles) by 3 to find out how long it will take to cover each mile: 42 miles / 3 = 14 minutes per mile
2. Multiply the number of miles in the city by the time it takes to cover each mile: 14 minutes/mile x 42 miles = 588 minutes (or 9 hours and 48 minutes)

Therefore, it will take the fog bank 9 hours and 48 minutes to cover the whole city."
Response:  There are 625 jigsaw pieces left to be placed (25% + 33%).
Response:  Both Cody and Amir eat 15 cookies together.
"Response:  To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we need to calculate the volume of each box and then add them up.
The volume of a rectangular prism (such as each box) can be calculated using the formula: Volume = Length x Width x Height.
So, for Box 1:
Volume of Box 1 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
For Box 2:
Volume of Box 2 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
For Box 3:
Volume of Box 3 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Since there are 1728 cubic inches in a cubic foot, we can convert the volumes of each box to cubic feet by dividing by 1728:
Box 1 = 120 / 1728 = 0.069 cubic feet
Box 2 = 120 / 1728 = 0.069 cubic feet
Box 3 = 120 / 1728 = 0.069 cubic feet
Finally, we add up the volumes of all three boxes to get the total inner volume:
Total inner volume = 0.069 + 0.069 + 0.069 = 0.207 cubic feet
Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is approximately 0.207 cubic feet."

Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fruit roll-ups that each person has. Let's start by finding out how many roll-ups Beatrice had. Since her roll-up was 24 rolls long, she had 24 x $ width = 24 \times 2 = 48 roll-ups. Now let's find out how many roll-ups Marcell had. Since his roll-up was 14 rolls long, he had 14 x $ width = 14 \times 3 = 42 roll-ups. So, in total, Beatrice had 48 roll-ups and Marcell had 42 roll-ups. Then, to find out how much they ate on average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: $\frac{48 + 42}{2} = 50$. Therefore, on average, Beatrice and Marcell ate $50$ fruit roll-ups.
Response:  To find out how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows back towards shore, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, if Julia rowed 64 feet (which is equal to 8 times 8), then she would have taken on 8 x 2 = 16 liters of water. Therefore, the answer is 16 liters.
Response:  The whiteboard is cleaned 12 times per day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/day x 3 cleans per lesson = 12 cleans per day).
Response:  Ryan has 75 flowers in his garden after 15 days (2 x 15 = 30).
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so Jamal's phone can hold 6 x 1800 = 10800 photographs. We also know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So if there are x birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo, then Brittany's phone can hold at most 50x photographs. Finally, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo must be less than or equal to 1800 / 50 = 36. Therefore, there are 36 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she sold and then subtract that amount from the total revenue she received. Let's do this step by step:

Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x $10 = $100
Total cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 x $16 = $80
Total cost of all lumber = $100 + $80 = $180

Revenue from selling all lumber = Price per board x Number of boards sold
For 2 x 4 x 10 boards: Revenue = $10 x 10 = $100
For 4 x 4 x 10 boards: Revenue = $16 x 5 = $80
Total revenue from selling all lumber = $100 + $80 = $180

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $180 - $180
= $0

So, Sasha doesn't make any profit from selling all of her leftover lumber."
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the ratio given in the question, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 teaspoons of water. So if Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar, she used 120/7 = 17 teaspoons of sugar. Therefore, Katy used 17 teaspoonfuls of sugar.
Response:  To find out how much John paid, we need to multiply the number of pairs of shoes he bought by the cost per pair. Since John bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, he bought a total of 6 pairs of shoes (3 children x 2 pairs per child). The cost of each pair is $60, so the total cost is $60 x 6 = $360. Therefore, John paid $360 for the shoes.
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles was 2 x 5 = 10.
2. On the second day, additional containers arrived, bringing the total number of vehicles to 30.
3. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can conclude that there are 30 / 5 = 6 containers of vehicles on the second day.

Therefore, the answer is 6 containers of vehicles were imported on the second day."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, which means that if Lylah's salary is x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x. Also, we are told that Adrien's salary has increased by 40% since four years ago, so now it is (1.3x) \* 1.4 = 1.96x. Finally, we are asked to find out the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later. Therefore, the answer is:
Total Salary = $40000 + ($1.96x - $x) = $40000 + $0.96x
So, the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $40000 + $0.96x."
"Response:  To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to divide the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week = 2 x 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week
Therefore, Miguel uses 60 sheets of paper/week x 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets of paper/month

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Response:  To find out how many fruits Morisette and Kael have in total, we need to add the number of fruits each of them brought.
Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so he has a total of 13 fruits (5 + 8).
Kael brought twice the number of apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which means he brought 5 / 2 = 2.5 oranges (rounded up to 3 oranges). So, Kael has a total of 10 + 3 = 13 fruits.
Therefore, Morisette and Kael together have 26 fruits (13 + 13)."
"Response:  To find out how many hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to add up all the amounts of time she slept during the week.
On Monday, she slept for 8 hours.
For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept for 6 hours (2 hours less than Monday) + 4 hours (2 hours less than Tuesday) = 10 hours.
For Thursday and Friday, she slept for 7 hours (1 hour more than Wednesday) + 5 hours (1 hour more than Thursday) = 12 hours.
In total, Sadie slept for 8 + 10 + 12 = 30 hours throughout the week."
Response:  To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the total distance she can cover in that time. We know that she can run at a rate of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means she covers a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles in those 3 hours. Then, she slows down and runs at a rate of 5 miles per hour for 4 hours (since there are 7 - 3 = 4 hours left). So, she covers a distance of 4 x 5 = 20 miles in those 4 hours. Therefore, in total, Rosie can run 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  Let X be the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she put stamps on X/3 = 20 letters. Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie finished is X + 20 = 50. So, there were 50 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.
Response:  The number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is equal to the number of spoons that her husband gave her plus the number of spoons that she used to sample her stew. In this case, the answer is 7 + 3 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 spoons in the package that Julia bought.
Response:  To find out how many sausages Dylan bought in all, we need to add the number of chicken sausages he bought (38) to the number of fish sausages he bought plus 6. So, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is: 38 + (6 + 1) = 45 sausages.
Response:  Lily has 50 friends, and Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy has 70 friends. Therefore, the total number of friends that Lily and Amy have together is 50 + 70 = 120 friends.
"Response:  The total amount of money that Dillon will spend on the fruits is:
Watermelons x price = $3 x 4 = $12
Peppers x price = $15 x 20 = $300
Oranges x price = $15 - $5 = $10
Total amount of money spent = $12 + $300 + $10 = $322
Therefore, the answer is $322."
"Response:  To find out how much profit the hospital makes from each visit, we need to calculate the total revenue and expenses for each patient visit. Let's break down the costs and revenues as follows:

Costs:

* Doctors' fees: $150/hour x 24 minutes = $36 per visit
* Hospital fees: $200/hour x 24 minutes = $80 per visit
* Total costs = $36 + $80 = $116 per visit

Revenues:

* Patient fees: $200/hour x 24 minutes = $960 per visit

Profit = Revenues - Costs = $960 - $116 = $844 per visit

Now, let's calculate the daily profit:

Daily profit = Number of visitors per day x Profit per visitor
= 500 visitors per day x $844 per visit
= $422,000 per day

So, the hospital makes a profit of $422,000 per day from seeing 500 people."
Response:  There are 40 elves left.
Response:  To find the total expenditure of Joseph for May and June, we need to add his expenditure in each month. So, the total expenditure = $500 + ($60 - $500) = $1100.
"Response:  To find out how many tickets Pam and Fred used at the carnival, we need to add up the number of rides they took on each ride.
Pam rode the roller coaster twice, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for that ride.
Fred rode the roller coaster four times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets for that ride.
Then, each of them rode the luge twice, so they used an additional 2 x 6 = 12 tickets between them.
Therefore, in total, Pam and Fred used 12 + 24 + 12 = 58 tickets at the carnival."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. So, his total distance for Monday = 4 miles.
* On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, his total distance for Tuesday = 6 x 4 = 24 miles.
* On Wednesday, he walked a certain number of miles that is equal to the total distance he walked from Monday to Wednesday (41 miles). So, the number of miles he walked on Wednesday = 41 / 3 = 13.67 miles.

Therefore, Walt walked 13.67 miles on Wednesday."
Response:  To find out how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the cost of each car wash. Since Tom gets 4 car washes per month, and each car wash costs $15, he pays $60 per month ($15 x 4). Therefore, in a year, Tom pays $720 ($60 x 12 months).

"Response:  To find out how many female Scottish unicorns there are, we need to multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by the proportion of female unicorns. Since two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate that:
Number of female Scottish unicorns = Number of Scottish unicorns x Proportion of female unicorns
= 9 (unicorns) x 0.66
= 5.84
So, there are approximately 5.84 female Scottish unicorns."
Response:  To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to add up all of the items she is ordering. The subs are $7.50 each, so that's $15.00 for two subs. The bags of chips are $1.50 each, so that's $3.00 for two bags. The cookies are $1.00 each, so that's $2.00 for two cookies. The delivery fee is $20%, or $1.50, so that brings the total to $28.50. Finally, if Rory adds a $5.00 tip, that brings the total to $33.50. So, Rory's delivery order will cost $33.50.
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how much time Mark spent on each test. We know that he spent 8 hours on the first test and 6 hours on the second test. So, the total time he spent on both tests is:
8 hours + 6 hours = 14 hours
Now, we can use the information given in the question to find out how many questions Mark answered during these 14 hours. We know that he answered 75 questions in 8 hours, so his rate was:
75 questions / 8 hours = 9.375 questions/hour (round up to 9.4 questions/hour)
Similarly, we know that he answered 100 questions in 6 hours, so his rate for the second test was:
100 questions / 6 hours = 16.67 questions/hour (round up to 17 questions/hour)
Now, let's calculate how many questions Mark left incomplete:
For the first test, Mark answered 9.4 questions/hour x 8 hours = 74 questions
For the second test, Mark answered 17 questions/hour x 6 hours = 102 questions
So, Mark left 30 questions incomplete (74 - 102)."
Response:  The answer is 88.

Response:  The number of worker bees is 1400.
Response:  To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on video games and then multiply it by his hourly wage. If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day, that means he spends 14 hours (2 x 7) playing video games per week. If he works at his part-time job for 14 hours per week and earns $10 per hour, then he will earn $140 per week ($10 x 14 hours). Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn $140 per week.
Response:  The total cost of the items John bought can be calculated as follows: Milk = $2 x 1.1 = $2.20 Eggs = $3 x 1.1 = $3.30 Light bulbs = $3 x 1.1 = $3.30 Cups = $3 x 1.1 = $3.30 Roach traps = $4 x 1.1 = $4.40 Total cost = $2.20 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $16.60 Therefore, everything cost $16.60 with a 10% tax on non-food items.
Response:  To calculate the profit that Lucas will make each week, we first need to calculate his total income for the week. Based on the information given in the problem, Lucas's total income per week is $92. Next, we subtract his total expenses from his total income to find his profit. His total expenses are $2 x 6 = $12 for the 6 bottles of bleach and $5 x 5 = $25 for the 5 packs of cloths. Therefore, his profit each week is $92 - $12 - $25 = $45. So, Lucas will make $45 in profit each week.
"Response:  To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the total area of the field (in hectares) and then divide that result by the time interval between harvests (in months).

So, if there are 100 pineapples per hectare, and John has 10 hectares of land, he will have 1000 pineapples per harvest (10 x 100 = 1000). If John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, he will harvest them 4 times in a year (4 x 3 = 12). Therefore, John can harvest a total of 4000 pineapples within a year (1000 x 4 = 4000)."
"Response:  To find out how many Legos Johnny picked up, we need to add the number of pieces in each Lego set that he picked up. Let's do this:

* The first Lego set has 500 pieces.
* The second Lego set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.
* The third Lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, so it has 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces.

Adding these numbers together gives us a total of 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2175 pieces. Therefore, Johnny picked up 2175 Legos."
"Response:  The total number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

$$ = \frac{2}{3} \times (30 + 15) = 45 $$

Explanation:

In the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive and 15 bees return. So, the total number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours was 30. In the next 6 hours, half of the bees that had left the hive returned, which is 15 bees. Therefore, the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours was 45 bees."
Response:  Brittany's mom gave the cashier $10 (the cost of one adult ticket) + $8 (change) = $18.
Response:  James has 48 Facebook friends.
Response:  To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach their houses. Let's start by finding the time it takes for Steve to reach his house: Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 7 minutes Now let's find the time it takes for Tim to reach his house: Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 264 ft/min = 8 minutes Since Steve started first, he will arrive at his house before Tim. So, the winner will wait 7 minutes after starting the race before the loser finishes.
Response:  To find out how much money Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the cost of inflating each tire and then multiply it by the number of tires inflated. For the bicycles, each tire costs $0.25, so 5 tires x $0.25 = $1.25. For the tricycles, each tire costs $0.25, so 3 tires x $0.25 = $0.75. And for the unicycle, since there is only one tire, it costs $0.25. Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25.
Response:  The total cost of the cookies is $60 (10 x $0.10 per cookie). Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, he will receive $40 in change ($10 - $60 = -$40).

"Response:  To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he attends classes per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in the semester.

Weekly hours attended:
Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 3 x 1 = 3 hours/week
Tuesday, Thursday: 2 x 2 = 4 hours/week
Total weekly hours attended: 3 + 4 = 7 hours/week

Semester hours attended: 7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 112 hours attending classes in a semester."
Response:  To find out how long the baked goods are when put end to end, we need to measure their length one by one. Let's start with the rolls: each roll is 4 inches long, so there are 300 rolls x 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches of rolls. Next, let's calculate the length of the chocolate croissants: each croissant is 6 inches long, so there are 120 croissants x 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches of croissants. Finally, let's calculate the length of the baguettes: each baguette is two feet long, so there are 60 baguettes x 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet of baguettes. Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 120 feet = 2040 feet. Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 2040 feet long.
"Response:  To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we must first calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo over that period.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month x 2 months = 400 bananas
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month x 2 months = 800 bananas
The baboons need 100 bananas per month x 2 months = 200 bananas
Total number of bananas needed = 400 + 800 + 200 = 1,400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1,400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Response:  To find out how far the winner ran compared to the loser, we need to measure the distance between the starting point of each runner and their finishing point. Let's call the starting point of Blake ""B"" (since he started at one end of the field) and the starting point of Kelly ""K"".

For Blake:
Distance = 100 yards x 15 trips = 1500 yards

For Kelly:
Distance = 40 yards + (40 yards x 34 trips) = 1360 yards

So, the winner (Blake) ran 1500 - 1360 = 140 yards more than the loser (Kelly)."
Response:  To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to add the prices of all the items he bought. The total cost is: $1.5 x 4 = $6 for the pens, $4 x 2 = $8 for the notebooks, and $20 for the rim of bond paper. Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 on everything.
Response:  Finn can see 5 tadpoles in the pond now.
Response:  The water depth in the tank on Wednesday is 2/3 x 17 = 11 feet.
Response:  To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught together, we need to add up the number of fish each person caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish, so he caught a total of 19 fish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means she caught 5 - 10 = 5 starfish. She also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means she caught 6 - 6 = 0 sea horses. And she caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means she caught 3 + 3 = 6 clownfish. So in total, Anakin and Locsin caught 19 + 5 + 0 + 6 = 30 fish.
"Response:  After 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost $48.

Explanation:
The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20. Every two months, the price increases by 20% of the original price, which means that the new price is:

$20 x (1 + 0.2) = $24

So, after one month, the price of a bag of marbles is $24.

After two months, the price is:

$24 x (1 + 0.2) = $27.20

And so on...

After 36 months, the price of a bag of marbles is:

$27.20 x (1 + 0.2)^36 = $48.00

Therefore, a bag of marbles will cost $48 after 36 months."
"Response:  The total value of the toys is:

"Response:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of doing her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring an accountant.

Total Cost of Doing Taxes Herself = $35/hour x 3 hours = $105
Cost of Hiring Accountant = $90

Therefore, by hiring an accountant, Jackie will save $105 - $90 = $15."
"Response:  To calculate how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer and its accessories from her budget of €1500. The total cost of the computer and its accessories is:
€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1323
So, Elvira will have €1500 - €1323 = €177 left for her clothing."

"Response:  To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total number of miles he walks during the weekdays and then add that to the number of miles he walks on the weekends.

Weekdays (Monday through Friday): 5 days x 20 miles/day = 100 miles/week
Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 2 days x 10 miles/day = 20 miles/week
Total miles walked per week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles/week

Therefore, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"Response:  To find out how much each uniform costs, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The hat costs $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs $25 x 3 = $75.
3. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.
4. Therefore, each uniform costs $25 (for the hat), $75 (for the jacket), and $50 (for the pants), for a total cost of $150."
"Response:  The total number of legs that Jake sees is:
80 x 8 = 640 legs from the spiders
90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects
3 x 10 = 30 legs from the mutant invertebrates
Total number of legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs."
Response:  The total age of the four birds is 30 + 24 + 16 = 70 years.
"Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month first. The total monthly payment for Jessica's debts is:
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000/month
Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she will pay:
$1000 x 1.5 = $1500/month
So, Jessica pays $1500 per month towards her debts. In a year, she will pay:
$1500 x 12 = $18,000
Answer: Jessica pays $18,000 towards her debts in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum."
Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the time it takes him to peel and cut each potato by the number of potatoes he needs to prepare. So, if it takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato (1.5 minutes), and he needs to peel 60 potatoes, it will take him 90 minutes (60 x 1.5 = 90) to complete that task. If it only takes him 5 seconds to cut each potato, then it will take him 3 hours and 20 minutes (60 x 5 = 300) to cut them all up!
Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to divide the total amount of money they made by the cost of one gallon of lemonade. So, if they made $25 in profit, that means they sold $25 / $0.50 = 50 glasses of lemonade. Since they got 20 glasses per gallon, that means they made 50 / 20 = 2.5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we can calculate the cost of lemons as follows: Cost of lemons = Number of gallons x Cost of one gallon = 2.5 gallons x $3/gallon = $7.50. Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $7.50 on lemons.
Response:  There are no girls on the Chinese team because it is stated that all members of the Chinese team are boys. Therefore, there are no girls on the Chinese team.
"Response:  After calculating each of the expenses and donations as a percentage of Zaid's income, we can determine that he has $5,800 left over after all of his expenses and donations. Here is the calculation:
Rent (1/4 of $6,000) = $1,500
Car Fuel (1/3 of $6,000) = $2,000
Charity Donation (half of $6,000) = $3,000
Weekly Expenses for Daughter ($200) = $200
Groceries and Other Household Goods for Wife ($700) = $700
Total Expenses = $6,900
Money Left Over = $6,000 - $6,900 = $5,800"
"Response:  The total number of crabs the three have together is:
Rani - 10 = 30

Response:  For the first two weeks, Lloyd earned a total of $40 ($10/hour x 5 hours + $10/hour x 8 hours).
Response:  Let X be the number of votes the loser received. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, the winner received X + 20 votes (since there were 80 students who voted). Therefore, we can set up the equation: X + 20 = 3(80) - X. Solving for X gives us X = 16. So the loser received 16 votes.
Response:  To find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm, we need to divide the total number of red roses that Sandra wanted by the percentage of red roses in her original order. Since Sandra originally wanted 4 times as many red roses as white carnations, and there were 100 white carnations in the original order, we can calculate the number of red roses as follows: Number of red roses = Total number of red roses x Percentage of red roses in original order / 100  Number of red roses = 200 x 4 / 100 = 800 red roses Therefore, Fred must deliver 800 red roses by 5 pm to satisfy Sandra's demand.
Response:  Jean is 32 years old.
Response:  To solve this problem we need to find out how long it takes for each member of the slower team to complete their 400 meter leg. Since each runner on the slower team runs at a different pace, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. We know that the distance of each leg is 400 meters, so we just need to find out the speed of each runner.  Let's start with the first runner who runs in 60 seconds. So, their speed is: Speed = Distance / Time = 400 m / 60 s = 6.67 m/s. Now let's find the speed of the next three runners: Runner 2 - Speed = 400 m / (60 + 3) = 6.17 m/s Runner 3 - Speed = 400 m / (60 + 6) = 5.83 m/s Runner 4 - Speed = 400 m / (60 + 9) = 5.53 m/s Therefore, the total time taken by all four runners to complete their legs is: Total Time = Sum of Times = 60 + 61.7 + 58.3 + 55.3 = 275.3 seconds. Now, since the faster team completes their legs in exactly 55 seconds per person, they finish the race in: Faster Team Finish Time = Total Time of Slower Team x (Faster Team Leg Length / Faster Team Leg Length of Slower Team) = 275.3 s x (400 m / 400 m) = 275.3 s x 1 = 275.3 seconds. Therefore, the faster team wins by 275.3 seconds or approximately 4 minutes and 45.3 seconds.
Response:  The probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on the die is 1/6 = 0.17. To calculate the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling another even number on the second roll. Since there are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of six possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (0.5) × (0.5) = 0.25 or 25%.
Response:  To find out how many apples Jenna and her mother picked together, we need to subtract the number of apples that Jenna picked from the total number of apples that her mother picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, if her mother picked 20 apples, then Jenna picked 10 apples (half of 20). So, Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples together.
Response:  Let's first calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to all the small rodents: 160 + (3 x 6) = 180. Since there are three cages with equally sized groups of rats, we can assume that each cage has 60 rats (since 60 / 3 = 20). Therefore, there are 20 rats in each cage.
Response:  To find out how much Mandy needs to pay to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount that Mandy will owe including the interest. The formula for calculating the total amount is: Total Amount = Principal + Interest x Time. In this case, the principal is $100 and the time is 3 months (or 0.5 years). So, the total amount that Mandy will owe is: Total Amount = $100 + ($100 x 2%) x 0.5 = $100 + $2 = $102. Therefore, Mandy should give $102 to Benedict after 3 months.
Response:  The number of bags sold = Total revenue / Transportation cost + Profit = $30 x Number of bags sold - $2 x Number of bags sold = $3000 - $40 = $2960 / $2 = 148 bags
"Response:  To solve this problem we need to use the information given in the question to find out the total cost of the trip and then divide it by the number of people who went on the trip.
The total cost of the trip is:
$20.25 (tickets) + $33 (ride 1) + $33 (ride 2) = $86.50
Since there are three people, the cost per person is:
$86.50 / 3 = $28.50
So each person paid $28.50 for the trip."
Response:  To find out how many peaches John collects in 3 hours, we need to multiply the number of minutes he spends collecting peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per minute. Since John can collect 2 peaches per minute, and he spends 3 hours collecting peaches, he will collect a total of 60 x 2 = 120 peaches. Therefore, John collects 120 peaches in 3 hours.
Response:  To determine the daily amount of insects needed by the duck flock, we must divide the total weekly requirement by seven days. Therefore, the ducks in this flock need approximately 0.5 pounds (or 226 grams) of insects per day.
"Response:  Tom has 40 trees left after 10 years.

Explanation:
Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 new ones every year. So in total, he has 50 + (10 x 10) = 50 + 100 = 150 trees after 10 years.
Now, every year he chooses to chop down 2 trees, so after 10 years he will have 150 - 20 = 130 trees remaining. Since 30% of the trees died, he lost 30/100 = 3 trees, leaving him with 130 - 3 = 127 trees. Therefore, Tom has 127 trees left after 10 years."
Response:  The number of pink plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday is 36 (the original 18 + the additional 18 that were added). Therefore, there are 36 - 18 = 18 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday.
Response:  Violetta will receive $18 in change.
Response:  To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we need to first find the total cost of one pen. We can do this by adding the cost of the pencil and eraser together: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50. So, one pen costs $1.50. Now, let's find out how many pens that is in total: $1.50 x 8 = $12.00. Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00.
"Response: 196 pounds of carrots will not be used.

Explanation:
Let's say the total weight of carrots that needs to be distributed is $X$. Since each restaurant receives $2$ pounds of carrots, the total amount of carrots distributed is $X \times 40 = 800$ pounds. Therefore, the remaining amount of carrots that won't be used is $X - 800 = 200 - 800 = -600$ pounds."
Response:  There are 5584 children in Soda.
Response:  Elaine currently has 60 Pokemon cards.
Response:  To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first find the amount he makes from Publisher A and then add that to the amount he makes from Publisher B. Since Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence, and Mark edits 1000 sentences for them, he makes $50 (1000 x $0.05) per week from Publisher A. From Publisher B, since they pay twice as much as Publisher A, Mark makes $100 ($50 x 2) per week. Therefore, Mark makes a total of $150 per week ($50 + $100).
Response:  To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total amount of water he gets in a day. We know that he gets 5 pails of water every morning, which means he gets 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning. Similarly, he gets 6 pails of water every afternoon, which means he gets 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is 25 + 30 = 55 liters.
"Response:  To find out how much money John made that year, we need to calculate his total earnings for the year. Since he gets paid biweekly, he will receive 4 paychecks per month (since there are 52 weeks in a year). Therefore, he will receive 80 paychecks in a year ($2000 x 4 paychecks/month x 12 months/year = $80,000).
The award includes a one-time monetary reward of $5000, which is added to his total earnings. So, John's total earnings for the year are: $80,000 + $5000 = $85,000."
"Response:  To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of acres she has by the amount of grapes produced per acre, then divide that result by the number of barrels of wine produced per ton of grapes. Here's the calculation:

Number of barrels of wine per year = (10 acres x 5 tons/acre) / 2 barrels/ton = 25 barrels/year

So, Josie's farm produces 25 barrels of wine per year."
"Response:  To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add up all the amounts of cheese he used during the week. Let's do that:

* On his sandwiches, he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich = 10 slices (since he had 5 lunches)
* In his omelets, he used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich = 3 slices (since he had 3 breakfasts)
* In his macaroni and cheese, he used 8 slices of cheese = 8 slices

So, altogether, Carl used 10 + 3 + 8 = 21 slices of cheese during the week."
Response:  Janet has a total of 38 pens (22 green + 10 yellow + 6 blue + 2 red).
Response:  To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we can use the formula for calculating a weighted average: Average = (Total Score / Number of Tests) x Weight. In this case, the total score is the sum of all the scores Brinley received on the six tests: Total Score = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 +? Since Brinley wants to get an average of 93, we can set up the equation: Average = (Total Score / Number of Tests) x Weight. Solving for the unknown score, we get:? = (Total Score / 6) x 0.43 = 85. Therefore, Brinley needs to get a score of 85 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.
"Response:  To find out how many kilometers Michael did in total, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during each period of his biking activity:

1. First 4 weeks:
Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week, which means he covered a distance of 5 x 25 km = 125 km per week. Since there are 4 weeks in this period, the total distance traveled is 125 km/week x 4 weeks = 500 km.
2. Next 3 weeks:
After the first 4 weeks, Michael reduced his biking frequency to twice a week, but increased the distance he covered each time by 60%. So, he traveled a distance of 2 x 60% x 25 km = 37.5 km per week. There are 3 weeks in this period, so the total distance traveled is 37.5 km/week x 3 weeks = 112.5 km.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled during both periods:
Total distance = 500 km + 112.5 km = 612.5 km

Therefore, Michael traveled a total distance of 612.5 kilometers."
"Response:  To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of each type of candy separately and then add them up. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can use this ratio to determine the weight of each type of candy.

The weight of a single chocolate bar is 2 x 40 = 80g. Therefore, the total weight of 25 chocolate bars is 25 x 80 = 2000g.

The weight of a single candied apple is 80/2 = 40g. Therefore, the total weight of 80 candied apples is 80 x 80 = 6400g.

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2000g + 6400g = 8400g."
"Response:  To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total, we need to add up the numbers from each day:
Monday: 4 cakes

Wednesday: 5 x 12 = 60 cakes
So, in total, Rose bought 60 cakes."
Response:  The total cost of buying each cup is $450.
Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and doing chores. Let's start by calculating the amount of money Sara will make from babysitting: 4 x $5 = $20. Now let's add that to the $10 she already has: $10 + $20 = $30. So now Sara has $30 in total. Next, let's calculate the cost of the jacket and shoes: $30 / $20 = 1.5 times. That means Sara needs to mow the lawn 1.5 times to afford the jacket and shoes. Since you cannot divide by a fraction (like 1.5), we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2. Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn twice to afford the jacket and shoes.
Response:  Jerry has 10 red chickens.
"Response:  To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to multiply the length of the park (in miles) by his speed (in miles per hour):
Length of park x Speed = Time
= 1.5 x 3 = 4.5 hours
So, Gary spends 4.5 hours walking around the park."
"Response:  To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to add the number of customers she counted each day:
100 + 50 + x = 500
Where x is the number of customers on the third day. Solving for x, we get:
x = 300
So, Sloane counted 300 customers on the third day."
Response:  The small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.
"Response:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work in order to afford the shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage. In this case, the total cost is $352.00 ($320.00 + $32.00) and her hourly wage is $8.00. Therefore, Lori would need to work for:

$352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori would need to work for 44 hours in order to afford the shoes and belt."

So, Adrian's current age is 63 years old."
Response:  The answer is 49.
Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle. For the crossword puzzles, it took her 10 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 10 x 3 = 30 minutes solving crossword puzzles. For the sudoku puzzles, it took her 5 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 5 x 8 = 40 minutes solving sudoku puzzles. Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
Response:  The amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters is 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30). Since she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, there are now 60 liters of water in the tank (30 + 2 x 60 = 60).
Response:  Andy plants a total of 130 flowers (90 geraniums + 40 fewer petunias).

So, the company spent a total of $20,000 on advertising over the two years."
Response:  To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, we need to calculate the total time each of them used the boat or raft. For Carlos, he used the canoe for 3 hours, so his cost is $30/hour x 3 hours = $90. For Benji, he used the raft for 5 hours, so his cost is $18/hour x 5 hours = $90. Therefore, together they will pay $90 + $90 = $180 for their rentals.
Response:  If Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, it will take him twice as long to make the round trip compared to going there and back by the same mode of transportation. Therefore, he will travel for 12 days (6 days + 6 days).
Response:  The probability that a randomly picked card will be a water type after losing 8 of them and buying 14 more grass types is (40/94) = 0.427 or 42.7%.
"Response:  To calculate the amount that Chad still owes after using his gift card, we need to subtract the value of the gift card from the total cost of his meal.

Total cost of meal = Base burrito ($6.50) + Extra meat ($2.00) + Extra cheese ($1.00) + Avocado ($1.00) + Sauces ($0.25 x 2) + Upgrade ($3.00) = $14.75
Gift card value = $5.00
Amount owed = Total cost of meal - Gift card value = $14.75 - $5.00 = $9.75

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.75 after using his gift card."
Response:  To solve for the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to find out how many minutes they can work together in one hour. We know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so she can do 28 pieces (4 x 7) in one hour. Since her mom can only place half as many pieces as Kalinda, her mom can do 14 pieces (28 / 2 = 14) in one hour. Therefore, in one hour, they can complete 42 pieces (28 + 14) altogether. Now, we want to find out how long it will take them to complete the entire puzzle of 360 pieces. We can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can complete in one hour: 360 / 42 = 8.5 hours. So, it will take them approximately 8.5 hours to complete the puzzle.
Response:  After two weeks, 70% of the original 120 baby watermelons were left unharvested (since 30% were already harvested). So, the number of unharvested melons after two weeks = 120 x 70% = 84.
"Response:  To calculate how much Mark pays for everything, we need to add up the cost of the cars, the taxes, and the registration fees.

Cost of cars = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000
Taxes = $240,000 x 10% = $24,000
Registration fees = $240,000 x $1000 = $24,000
Total amount paid by Mark = $240,000 + $24,000 + $24,000 = $308,000

Therefore, Mark pays a total of $308,000 for the fleet of 12 cars."
"Response:  Let's break this down step by step:

1. On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Robert collects 20 - 5 = 15 shells.
2. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday, so she collects 2 x (15 + 5) = 37 shells."
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that there are half as many bugs as ants in the garden, which means that if there are 50 ants, there are also 50 bugs. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 100 (50 ants + 50 bugs).
Response:  There are 24 penguins still sunbathing.
"Response:  To determine the number of vines needed for Steve to grow enough tomatoes to eat 6 per day, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes that one vine can produce in a week. Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the total number of tomatoes that one vine can produce is:
3 tomatoes/week x 4 weeks = 12 tomatoes/month
Now, since Steve wants to eat 6 tomatoes per day, he will need:
12 tomatoes/month / 6 tomatoes/day = 2 tomato vines per month
Therefore, Steve needs 2 tomato vines to grow enough tomatoes to eat 6 per day."
Response:  To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we must divide the number of friends by the number of slices per pizza. In this case, there are 20 friends / 4 slices per pizza = 5 pizzas that John needs to order.
Response:  To find out how many pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the number of pens he will be able to make using the mixed ink. Since each pen has 1/5 of the original amount of ink, if he mixes 5 empty pens together, he will have 5 x 1/5 = 1 full pen of ink. Therefore, if he uses these 1 full pen of ink to make a new pen, he will have 1 - 1 = 0 additional pens. So, Ram gets to have 0 pens in total.
Response:  After one year, Johnny had $30.
Response:  The sum of the ages of the three girls is 54 years (Mary - 2 = 52, Joan - 5 = 47, and Jessa - 20 = 37).
"Response:  Let's first analyze the information given in the problem:

* The total number of students in the school hall is 1000.
* After the meeting, 30% of the students went out of the building through exit A. This means that 300 students (30% of 1000) went out through exit A.
* Of the remaining 700 students, 3/5 went out through exit B. This means that 280 students (3/5 x 700) went out through exit B.
* The remaining 420 students went out through exit C.

So, the total number of students who went out through exit C is 420."
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so if Robert has x candies, James has x + 6 candies. We also know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so if Robert has x candies, John has 2x candies. Finally, we are told that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 6) = 54. Solving for x, we get x = 38. So, John has 96 candies (2x = 96). Therefore, John has 30 more candies than James (John has 96 candies and James has 66 candies).
Response:  At the beginning, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book, so together they have 3 books. After reading each other's books, Dolly will have 2 + 1 = 3 books, and Pandora will have 1 + 1 = 2 books. Therefore, at the end, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read a total of 3 + 2 = 5 books.
Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and divide it by the time it takes him to write one page. Let's assume that Mike writes for 8 hours a day (since he can write a page every 6 minutes). So, in one week, he will have written: Number of days = 7 days x 8 hours/day = 56 hours Total number of pages = 5 pages/week x 4 weeks = 20 pages In one week, Mike spends: Time spent writing = Total number of pages / Time taken to write one page = 20 pages / 6 minutes per page = 333 minutes or 5.5 hours per week Therefore, Mike spends approximately 5.5 hours per week writing letters to his pen pals.
Response:  If Jason has 1000 minutes per month and he uses 15 minutes per day for calls with his boss, that means he uses 45 minutes (15 x 3) more than the amount of minutes in a month. So, he has 955 minutes left (1000 - 45). Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason has 31,550 minutes (955 x 30) available for calling others.
Response:  Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries.
"Response:  Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x. Then, the number of fish in the second aquarium is twice that amount, so it is 2x. Since the difference between the two numbers is equal to the number of snails in each aquarium (which we can assume is constant), we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 4 + 32

Simplifying this equation gives us:

3x = 36

Dividing by 3 gives us:

x = 12

So, there are 12 fish in the first aquarium and 24 fish in the second aquarium."
"Response:  To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup services over the duration of the movie shoot.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours of makeup application per week:
4 days x 6 hours/day = 24 hours/week

Next, let's multiply the total hours by the hourly rate of the makeup artist:
$250/hour x 24 hours/week = $6,000/week

Since the movie shoot lasts for 5 weeks, the total cost of makeup services over that period is:
$6,000/week x 5 weeks = $30,000

Now, since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, we subtract 10% of the total cost from the original price:
$30,000 x 0.9 = $27,000

Therefore, Jean paid $27,000 for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot."
Response:  Each person paid $70 / 3 = $23.33.
"Response:  The chef spent a total of $675 on the onions. Here's how you can calculate it:

* Number of bags = 4
* Weight of each bag = 50 pounds
* Cost per pound = $1.50

So, the total weight of all the onions is:
4 bags x 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds
And the total cost is:
200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on the onions."
"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to first calculate the total number of calories that each girl ate over the two days. Let's do this by multiplying the number of cookies they ate each day by the number of calories in one cookie (which is 200).

Monday:
Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so if her sister ate x cookies, Sue ate 4x cookies. The total number of calories Sue ate on Monday was 4x x 200 = 800 calories.
Tuesday:
Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so if her sister ate x cookies, Sue ate 2x cookies. The total number of calories Sue ate on Tuesday was 2x x 200 = 400 calories.
Total number of calories Sue ate over both days = 800 + 400 = 1200 calories.
Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister. We can do this by subtracting the number of calories her sister ate from the total number of calories Sue ate:
More calories consumed by Sue = 1200 - x = 1200 - 5 = 1195 calories.
Therefore, Sue consumed 1195 more calories than her sister over the two days."
