Response:  According to the problem, Janet has 16 chickens and she sells 4 of them every day at $2 per chicken. So, her daily income from selling chickens is:  Daily income = Number of chickens sold x Price per chicken = 4 x $2 = $8  Therefore, Janet earns $8 per day from selling chickens at the market.
Response:  We need to find out how many bolts are needed for each piece of wood and then multiply it with the total number of pieces of wood.  So, we can start by finding out how much area one bolt can cover in one piece of wood.  One bolt can cover half a square meter (since it is 5 cm wide). Now, let's calculate how many bolts are needed for one piece of wood that is 10 meters long and 1 meter wide.  Area = length x width = 10 m x 1 m = 10 sqm  Since there are 10 sqm of surface area per bolt, we need 1/10 = 0.1 bolt for every 10 sqm of surface area. Therefore, we need 0.1 bolt x 10 sqm = 0.1 cubic meter of bolts for every 10 sqm of surface area.  Now, since there are 100 pieces of wood that need to be covered, we need to multiply the amount of bolts needed for one piece of wood by 100.  So, we need 100 x 0.1 cu.m = 10 cu.m of bolts in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh bought a house for $80,000 and then he spent $50,000 on renovations. So, the total cost of the house plus renovations is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. Now, if we add 150% to this amount, we get $130,000 x 150% = $195,000. Therefore, the total value of the house after renovation is $195,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that James will run 3 sprints per day for 7 days. So, in total, he will run 21 sprints (3 x 7).  Secondly, we are given that each sprint is 60 meters long. Therefore, the distance James covers in one day is: Distance = Number of sprints x Length of each sprint = 21 x 60 = 1320 meters. Finally, to find out how many meters James covers in a week, we multiply the daily distance by 7: Total distance = Daily distance x Number of days = 1320 x 7 = 9340 meters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Wendi gives each of her three chickens different amounts of food every day to ensure they stay healthy and strong. She gives them 3 tases of food in the morning, 15 tases in the afternoon, and 25 tases in the evening for a total of 63 tases of food per day. Now, let's calculate how many tases of food Wendi needs to give to her chickens on the last day if she has 20 chickens. We can do this by dividing the number of chickens (20) by the number of chickens given food per day (3). So, Wendi needs to give 6.67 tases of food to each of her 20 chickens on the last day.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much one baso costs. According to the problem, one baso costs $5. Now, let's find out how many basos Kylar wants to buy. Kylar wants to buy 16 basos. So, we multiply the cost of one baso with the number of basos Kylar wants to buy: $5 x 16 = $80. Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $80 for the 16 basos he wants to buy.
Response:  The first Bes is equal to 16 (Toulouse).  The second Bes is equal to 8 (Charleston).  Therefore, the total number of Bes for both cities is 16 + 8 = 24.  Now, we are asked how many Tupa there are in Seattle. According to the question, Seattle has 4 times as many Tupa as Charleston, which means that Seattle has 4 x 8 = 32 Tupa. Finally, we add the number of Tupa in Seattle to the total number of Bes for both cities to get our final answer: 24 + 32 = 56. So, there are 56 Tupa in all three cities combined.
Response:  We know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute, which means she needs to download 200 GB in total (200,000 MB). Now, we are told that after 40% of the download process, Windows forces her to restart for installation of updates, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla must continue downloading from where she left off. To find out how many loads she needs to do, we need to divide the total amount of data to be downloaded by the download speed during each load. So, we have: Total data = 200,000 MB Download speed = 2 GB/minute Number of loads = Total data / Download speed = 200,000 MB / 2 GB/minute = 100 loads Therefore, Carla needs to perform 100 loads to download the entire 200 GB file.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John took 3 hours to reach his destination traveling at a speed of 60 mph. Afterward, he realized something important and turned back, taking another 2 hours to return to the starting point. He then traveled for the remaining 1 hour and 40 minutes at a speed of 80 mph. To calculate how far he was from home when he finished his journey in 5 hours, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance traveled by John would be: Distance = 80 mph x 1 hour and 40 minutes = 112 miles. Therefore, John was 112 miles away from home when he finished his journey in 5 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Eliza earned from her regular work for this week. Since she worked for 40 hours in total and was paid $10 per hour, her regular earnings are: Regular Earnings = Total Hours Worked x Hourly Wage = 40 hours x $10/hour = $400 Now, let's add the amount of overtime pay that Eliza received. According to the question, she received overtime pay three times during this week, with each payment equal to 1.2 times her regular wage. So, the amount of overtime pay that Eliza received is: Overtime Pay = Total Hours Worked x Overtime Rate x Number of Times Overtime Was Paid = 45 hours x $12/hour x 3 = $690 Finally, we can calculate Eliza's total income for this week as follows: Total Income = Regular Earnings + Overtime Pay = $400 + $690 = $1,090 Therefore, if Eliza worked 45 hours this week, her total income would be $1,090.
Response:  The program had 60 downloads in its first month and gained three times more downloads than that in the second month. This means it had 180 downloads (3 x 60) in the second month. However, after two months, there was a decline of 30%, which means it lost 54 downloads (30/100 x 180). So, the number of downloads for the program in the third month is 126 (180 - 54).
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items that Toula bought from the bakery. We can do this by multiplying the number of each item she purchased with its corresponding price per unit. Here are the calculations for each item:
Donuts - $68 x 3 = $194 Mini Cupcakes - $80 x 2 = $160 Mini Cheesecakes - $55 x 6 = $330 Total Cost = $194 + $160 + $330 = $684 Therefore, the total amount that Toula paid for her purchases is $684."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend in buying and maintaining his lemon tree per year:  Cost of buying the lemon tree = $90  Cost of maintenance (fertilizer, pruning, etc.) = $3 per year  Total cost per year = $90 + $3 = $93 So, for the first year, Carlos will have an initial investment of $90 plus annual costs of $93, resulting in a total cost of $183 over one year. Now, let's assume that each lemon tree produces seven lemons per year, which means that Carlos can sell seven lemons per year as well. At $1.5 per lemon, he can earn $10.5 from selling those lemons every year ($1.5 x 7 lemons). To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to break even or recover his initial investment, we can use the following formula: Number of years to break even = Initial investment / Annual income  In this case, the initial investment is $183, and the annual income is $10.5. Therefore, the number of years it will take for Carlos to break even is: Number of years to break even = $183 / $10.5 = 17.6 years So, based on the calculation above, it will take approximately 17.6 years for Carlos to break even or recover his initial investment if he continues to buy and maintain his lemon tree annually while also selling its produce.
Response:  If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners and she sells 3 of them to her neighbors, then she will have 5 - 3 = 2 vacuum cleaners left for herself. So, she uses 2 vacuum cleaners noon.
Response:  Firstly, we know that out of 20 students in the class, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, which means 4 students (20% x 20) enrolled in this type of dance. Secondly, we know that 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, which means 5 students (25% x (20 - 4)) enrolled in this type of dance. Finally, since none of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, there are no students who belong to this category. Therefore, the total number of students who belong to each category can be calculated as follows: Contemporary Dance: 4 + 5 = 9 Hip-Hop Dance: 0 Jazz Dance: 5 So, the percentage of students who belong to each category is as follows: Contemporary Dance: 9/20 x 100 = 45% Hip-Hop Dance: 0% Jazz Dance: 5%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing both plans. For Plan A (Alhas), the cost is $5,000 x 1 + $5,000 x 2 = $13,000. For Plan B (Electronic Gadgets), the cost is $8,000 x 1 + $8,000 x 2 = $16,000. Next, we need to calculate the percentage increase in demand for each plan based on historical data. The average monthly growth rate for Alhas is 2.5%, while that of Electronic Gadgets is 1.2%. Now, let's calculate the expected revenue from each plan assuming an equal share of demand between them: Revenue from Plan A = ($13,000 x 2.5%) = $325 Revenue from Plan B = ($16,000 x 1.2%) = $192 Finally, we add the total revenue from both plans to get the overall expected revenue for the next two weeks: Total Expected Revenue = $325 + $192 = $517 Therefore, if the negosyante chooses to maximize their earnings at the end of this period, they will choose Plan B (Electronic Gadgets) which has a higher expected revenue of $517 compared to Plan A's $325.
Response:  The first train travelled for 80 miles in one direction and then turned around to go back in the opposite direction. So, it traveled a total distance of 80 + (80 x 2) = 320 miles. Similarly, the second train traveled for 150 miles in one direction and then turned around to go back, so its total distance traveled is 150 + (150 x 2) = 600 miles. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains over two days is 320 + 600 = 920 miles.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many hours she works as a teacher and as a coach per week. As a teacher, she works for 35 hours per week, while as a coach, she works for 15 hours per week. Next, we need to multiply these numbers with the number of weeks in a year. There are 50 weeks in a year. So, her total teaching hours per year would be 35 x 50 = 1750 hours, while her coaching hours per year would be 15 x 50 = 750 hours. Now, let's calculate her annual salary based on these hours. Her annual salary as a teacher would be $20 x 1750 = $35,000, while her annual salary as a coach would be $30 x 750 = $22,500. Therefore, her total annual salary would be $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

Response:  If Marissa walked for 1 hour and covered 4 miles during that time, then she would have traveled 4 x 60 = 240 miles in total over her entire journey so far. Since she has already walked for 2 hours, she needs to cover another 240 / 2 = 120 miles per hour to reach her destination which is 12 miles away. Therefore, she needs to walk at a speed of 120 miles per hour to reach her destination.
Response:  We have 10 liters of water that we want to add to 15 liters of beer (3/4 full). If we add 1 liter of water while the container is already 3/4 full, then the total volume will increase from 15 liters to 16 liters. So, there are 16 - 10 = 6 liters of additional water added to the original 15 liters of beer. Therefore, the remaining amount of beer after adding 1 liter of water is 15 - 6 = 9 liters.
Response:  We know that Raymon was born 6 years before Samantha and he became a father when he was 23 years old. So, the difference between their ages is 6 + 23 = 29 years. Now, if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then she was born 31 - 29 = 2 years after Raymon. Therefore, the time that passed since Raymon became a father is 2 years.
Response:  Billy sold 3 DVDs to his first customer on Monday. Since each of his next two customers bought 2 DVDs apiece, he sold an additional 4 DVDs (2 x 2 = 4). Therefore, in total, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Monday (3 + 4 = 7).
Response:  If the candle burns at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, then in one hour, it will have burned 2 x 60 = 120 centimeters. Now, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle has burned for 5 hours. So, the total distance it has burned during this period is 120 cm x 5 h = 600 centimeters. Therefore, the distance the candle has burned between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM is 600 centimeters.
Response:  The original price of the book is given as $19.50 and there is a discount of 25% from the original price. To find the original price, we can use the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage) So in this case, the formula would be: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $26.80 Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.80.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marie paid $50 for all of her purchases. So, the total cost of all her purchases is $50. Now, let's calculate the cost of each item she bought:  Manok - $12 Gatas - $3 Mansanas - $1.50 Pizza - $8.50 Total Cost = $12 + $3 + $1.50 + ($8.50 x number of slices) Therefore, if Marie ordered X slices of pizza, the total cost of her order would be $12 + $3 + $1.50 + ($8.50 x X). To find out how many slices Marie ordered, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem: $12 + $3 + $1.50 + ($8.50 x X) = $50 Solution: X = $50 / ($12 + $3 + $1.50 + $8.50) = $50 / $26.50 = 3.79 slices Since there are no whole slices of pizza left over after Marie ordered 3.79 slices, we can conclude that Marie ordered exactly 3.8 slices of pizza.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Mishka spent on each type of clothing item: Shorts - $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 Pants - $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 Shoes - $42 x 3 = $126 Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $242 Now, let's find out how many dollars Mishka saved overall: Savings = Total cost - Original price = $242 - ($16.50 x 3) = $242 - $49.50 = $192.50 So, Mishka saved $192.50 on her purchases.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pieces of ice cream Cynthia buys in one week. Since she buys a portion every evening, and there are 7 days in a week, then she buys 7 x 7 = 49 portions of ice cream per week.  Next, we need to find out how much each portion costs her. As stated earlier, each portion costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost of ice cream for one week is 49 x $4.00 = $196.00. So, the answer is $196.00.
Response:  Since Henry traveled 60 miles in total and he stopped twice along the way, we can assume that his two stops were 30 miles apart. So, after stopping for the first time, he had 30 miles left to travel before reaching his destination. Then, he stopped again after another 15 miles, which means he had 15 miles left to go when he made his second stop. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is 15 miles.
Response:  The first pair of shoes costs $33 and the second pair costs twice as much, or $66. So, if we add these two amounts together, we get $99. Since there are two pairs of shoes in total, the total cost would be double that amount, which is $198. Therefore, the answer is $198.
Response:  If Nina is currently 16 years old and their ratio is 7:11, then Allen is 11 years older than Nina. So, if Nina is now 16 years old, Allen was 16 + 11 = 27 years old 10 years ago. Therefore, Allen is currently 27 + 10 = 37 years old.
Response:  We know that there are three friends who gave their estimates of how many jelly beans are in the jar.  The first friend said there were 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second friend said there were 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate. So if the first friend estimated 80 jelly beans, then the second friend estimated 160 (half of 80 plus 20).  The third friend estimated 25% more than the second friend's estimate. So if the second friend estimated 160 jelly beans, then the third friend estimated 195 (25% more than 160). Therefore, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 195 + 80 = 275.
Response:  If John takes care of his 10 dogs for 5 hours per day, then he spends a total of 5 x 10 = 50 hours per week taking care of them. Now, there are 7 days in a week, so John spends a total of 50 hours / 7 days = 7.14 hours per day taking care of his dogs.

Response:  We know that Aaron has more than twice as many coins as Siobhan. So if Siobhan has x coins, then Aaron has at least 2x coins.  Moreover, we know that Raymound has fewer coins than Aaron. If Raymound has y coins, then Aaron has at most 2y coins. Therefore, the number of coins Siobhan has is between 2x and 2y. Since 2y is less than 5 (the number of coins Aaron has), the minimum value of x must be greater than or equal to 3. Thus, the number of coins Siobhan has is 3 or more.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he scored an average of 0.2 points per minute (4/20).  In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored more than half of his total score, which is 25%. So, in this period, he scored at least 12.5 points (25% x 48 = 12.5). Therefore, Mike scored a total of 16.5 points (0.2 + 12.5) over the entire 40-minute game.
Response:  If Terry sells each of his two yogurts for $1.00, then he will earn a total of $2.00 from both sales. If he sells these yogurts to four people at $5.00 each, he will earn a total of $20.00 ($5 x 4). Since there are 30 days in a month, Terry will sell a total of 30 yogurts during that time period and earn $600.00 (30 x $20.00) in profit. Therefore, the answer is $600.00.
Response:  We know that John has 13 Lego sets and he wants to buy all of them for $15 each. So, the total cost of buying all 13 Lego sets is:  $15 x 13 = $195. Now, we also know that John has $20 in cash left after buying the Lego sets, so he can use this money to buy additional items like video games. The number of video games John can buy with his remaining $20 is:  $20 / $20 = 1. Therefore, John has one video game left after buying all 13 Lego sets.
Response:  If John runs for 60 miles in one week and he walks for 3 days, then he walked for half an hour each day. So, his daily walking time was 15 minutes (half of 30 minutes). Now, let's calculate how long he walked per day: Daily walking time = Total walking distance / Number of hours walked = 60 miles / 15 minutes/day = 4 hours/day Therefore, John walked for 4 hours every day.
Response:  If Dana can run four times faster than her walking speed, then she can cover 3 miles in an hour while walking. Since she can skip 5 kilometers in half an hour, she can cover 10 kilometers (5 x 2 = 10) in one and a half hours if she skips. So, the number of kilometers she can cover in one and a half hours is 10.
Response:  The iPhone of Brandon is four times older than the iPhone of Ben. So if the iPhone of Ben is two years old, then the iPhone of Brandon would be 8 years old (4 x 2 = 8).  Therefore, the iPhone of Brandon is eight years older than the iPhone of Ben.
Response:  First, we need to find out how far is the distance between Polly and the dragon when she throws the stone. According to the problem, this distance is 400 talampakan. Next, we need to determine how many times Polly can throw the stone before reaching the end of the dragon's tail. Based on the information provided in the problem, Polly can throw the stone three times before reaching the end of the dragon's tail. Finally, we need to calculate how long it takes for Polly to reach the end of the dragon's tail after throwing the stone. To do this, we divide the total distance (400 talampakan) by the number of times Polly can throw the stone (3). Therefore, the answer is 133.33 talampakan.
Response:  We know that Lola Jones made 5 apple pies for the firemen and she cut each pie into 20 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 x 20 = 100 slices. Now, we are told that after all the guests have finished eating their slices, there are 14 remaining pieces of pie left over. Therefore, the number of slices taken by each guest can be calculated as follows: Number of slices taken by each guest = Total number of slices - Remaining slices = 100 - 14 = 86 slices. So, ilang piraso ang kinuha ng mga bisita ay 86 piraso.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many grams of chips are in one serving (250 calories). According to the information provided earlier, there are 5 portions per 300g bag of chips. So, if we divide 250 calories by 5 portions, we get approximately 50 calories per portion. Now, let's assume that you want to consume 1800 calories per day and you have already consumed 1300 calories from other food sources. Therefore, you can safely consume 500 calories from the chips without exceeding your daily limit. In terms of grams, this means you can eat up to 70 grams of chips (500 calories / 50 calories per portion) without going over your calorie budget for the day.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many liters of beeswax and wicks are needed for each candle. Since there are 10 tapered candles per kilogram of beeswax, and each tapered candle requires 5 grams of beeswax, then:

Number of liters of beeswax = Number of kilograms x Grams per kilogram / Gram weight of beeswax
= 10 x 5000 / 83.3 (gram weight of beeswax)
= 56.7 liters

Similarly, since there are 10 tapered candles per kilogram of wicks, and each tapered candle requires 0.5 meters of wick, then:

Number of meters of wick = Number of kilograms x Meters per kilogram / Meter length of wick
= 10 x 0.5 / 0.05 (meter length of wick)
= 20 meters

Now, let's calculate the cost of materials for one candle:

Cost of materials = Cost of beeswax + Cost of wicks
= $10 x 56.7 / 100
= $56.70

Finally, if he sells each candle for $2.00, his total revenue from 20 candles would be:

Total revenue = Number of candles x Selling price per candle
= 20 x $2.00
= $40.00

So, his net profit would be:

Net profit = Total revenue - Cost of materials
= $40.00 - $56.70
= -$16.70"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Meredith writes an article in 4 hours every day as her permanent job. So, she writes 5 articles per week (7 days x 4 hours = 28 hours / 7 days).  Secondly, we are given that she wrote more than 5 articles on Tuesday and Wednesday combined compared to Monday. This means she wrote 3 times as many articles on Tuesday alone since there were 5 days in total. Therefore, she wrote 15 articles on Tuesday (3 times 5 = 15). Thirdly, on Thursday, she doubled the number of articles she wrote compared to Wednesday. So, she wrote 30 articles on Thursday (2 x 15 = 30). Lastly, we are told that she spent an average of 4 hours writing each article. To find out how many hours she spent writing altogether during these three days, we multiply the number of articles she wrote for each day by the time it takes her to write one article: 5 articles/day x 4 hours/article = 20 hours/day; 15 articles/day x 4 hours/article = 60 hours/day; 30 articles/day x 4 hours/article = 120 hours/day. Now, let's add up all these hours: 20 + 60 + 120 = 190 hours. So, Meredith spent approximately 190 hours writing articles over those three days."
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-it notes before she left for work at the coffee shop. She bought one package of Post-it notes after arriving at her workplace and used one Post-it note to label each of the 220 different types of coffee drinks available. If there are 23 Post-it notes with written messages remaining, then the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought can be calculated as follows: Number of Post-it notes in the package = Total number of Post-it notes - Number of Post-it notes used to label coffee drinks = 80 - 23 = 57 Post-it notes in the package. Therefore, there were 57 Post-it notes in the package that Candice bought.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John bought twice as many expensive curtains than cheap ones. So, if he bought x expensive curtains at $200 each, then he also bought 2x times more cheap curtains at $40 each. Therefore, the total amount of money spent by John = 2x x $40 + (2x) x $200 = $800 + $400 = $1,200.
Response:  We know that Tracy needs to support 4 feet of 1-inch diameter pipe with a length of 8 feet using a wire with a diameter of 6 inches. To find out how many pirases she needs, we can use the formula: Number of pirases = Total length of pipe / Length of each pirase. In this case, the total length of pipe is 8 feet x 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Since each piraso is 4 inches long, we divide the total length by the length of each piraso: Number of pirases = 96 inches / 4 inches/piraso = 24 pirases. Therefore, Tracy needs 24 pirases to support the 4 feet of 1-inch diameter pipe with a length of 8 feet using a wire with a diameter of 6 inches.
"Response:  We know that there are 15 apartments in total and each apartment has 8 units. So, the total number of units in all the apartments is:

15 x 8 = 120 units
Now, we are told that 3/4 of the apartment is occupied, which means that 3/4 of 120 units are occupied:

3/4 x 120 = 90 units
So, there are 90 unoccupied units in the apartment complex."
"Response:  If Lloyd has one farm of chickens that produces 252 eggs per day and he sells each egg for $2, then his daily income from eggs would be:

So, Lloyd earns $504 per day from his egg farming business."
Response:  The boat travelled for 10 miles in an hour, so it covered a distance of 10 x 6 = 60 miles in 4 hours. Therefore, it took the boat 60/6 = 10 hours to return to its original position.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many comics Uria has in total. According to the question, she has 30 comics that she wants to sell. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound per issue, Uria has a total of 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds of comics. Next, we need to determine how much weight Uria needs to lose from her books. The question states that she needs to reduce 15 pounds from her collection. So, if Uria has 7.5 pounds of comics and she needs to lose 15 pounds, then she will have to get rid of 7.5 - 15 = 7.5 pounds less than 7.5 pounds worth of comics. Therefore, Uria needs to sell 7.5 pounds worth of comics. Finally, since each large size comic book weighs 1/2 pound per issue, Uria can calculate how many issues or comics she needs to sell based on the amount of weight she needs to lose. In this case, she needs to sell 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 comics to reach her target weight loss of 15 pounds.
Response:  On Wednesday (Huwebes), the mechanic fixed 6 tires and earned $60 x 6 = $360.  On Friday (Biyenos), he fixed 12 cars and did not earn any money for fixing tires because all of them were already fixed earlier in the week. So, he earned nothing that day. Therefore, the total amount of money the mechanic earned is $360 + $0 = $360.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are initially 7 puppies in the Doubtfire family. Then, their mother informs them that two of these puppies have already been adopted and taken away from the house. So, the number of puppies left with the Doubtfire family is now 5 (7 - 2 = 5). Next, we learn that one more puppy has been adopted, leaving only 4 puppies with the Doubtfire family (5 - 1 = 4). Therefore, the final answer is 4.
Response:  If Jean has 30 lollipops and he eats 2 of them, then he has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.  To pack 2 lollipops in one container, we need containers that can hold at least 28 / 2 = 14 lollipops. So Jean can pack 14 lollipops in each bag. Therefore, the number of bags Jean can fill is 14.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 for each ticket and $7 for each bag of popcorn, then he will spend a total of $14 per trip to the cinema. Since he has $42 in one week, he can go to the cinema 3 times (since 42 / 14 = 3). So, Peter can go to the cinema 3 times in one week.
"Response:  We know that the maximum weight of each piece of wood is limited to 5,000 grams or 5 kg. The total weight of all pieces of wood must not exceed this limit.  Now let's assume we have x number of pieces of wood with weights w1, w2,..., wx, where each weight is measured in kilograms (kg).  Since we cannot load more than 5,000 kg onto the pulley system, we can write an inequality based on these constraints:

w1 + w2 +... + wx <= 5000

Now, let's say we want to find out how many pieces of wood we can load onto the pulley system without going over the limit. To do this, we need to solve for x using the above inequality. We can use substitution or elimination methods to solve for x. Using substitution, we get:

w1 = x - 5000 / (w1 + w2 +... + wx)

Simplifying and solving for x gives us:

x = 3755 / (w1 + w2 +... + wx)

So, if we want to load as many pieces of wood as possible onto the pulley system without going over the limit, we should choose the values of wi such that x is maximized. In other words, we should choose the values of wi that make the left-hand side of the equation as large as possible. This means that each piece of wood should be as light as possible while still allowing us to load the maximum amount onto the pulley system. Therefore, the optimal value of x is:

x = 3755 / (min(w1, w2,..., wx))

Therefore, the maximum number of pieces of wood that can be loaded onto the pulley system without going over the limit is:

Maximum number of pieces of wood = 3755 / min(w1, w2,..., wx)

Answer: The maximum number of pieces of wood that can be loaded onto the pulley system without going over the limit is 3755 / min(w1, w2,..., wx), where wi represents the weight of each piece of wood in kilograms."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Stephen paid $40 for his last order. Then, the delivery person added 25% to the total amount and charged him an additional $3 as delivery fee, making the new total cost $43 ($40 + $3). Finally, Stephen gave a $4 tip, so the final price of his last order was $47 ($43 + $4).
Response:  We know that there are 6 groups of 20 strawberries in each group and 67 individual strawberries scattered throughout the entire bush. So, we can calculate the total number of strawberries as follows: Total Number of Strawberries = Number of Groups x Number of Strawberries per Group + Individual Strawberries Total Number of Strawberries = 6 x 20 + 67 = 153 strawberries Therefore, there are 153 raspberries in the entire bush.
Response:  We know that there are 25 balls in the basket and we want to find out how many of them are good (mabuti). From the information given, we can conclude that: •	The first ball is bad (masamang) so it doesn’t count as good. •	20% of the balls are not good (hindi hinog), which means that 5 balls are not good (since 20% of 25 = 5). •	Two balls are worse than average (masamok), so they also don’t count as good. Therefore, the number of good balls in the basket is: 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 17 So, there are 17 good balls in the basket.
Response:  First, she spent $500 for materials to make the brochure and then added another $800 for printing costs, so her total cost was $1,300. After that, she paid 10% of the total cost as insurance, which is $130. So, in total, she spent $1,430 ($1,300 + $130).
Response:  If Marcy worked for 40 years and received an annual pension of $50,000 per year, then her total pension amount would be:  $50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000.  Since she has the right to 5% of the pension amount every year, her annual pension after 30 years would be:  $2,000,000 x 5% = $100,000.
Response:  First half of the year (January to June):  $140 x 6 = $840  Second half of the year (July to December): $840 x 6 = $5,040 Total amount paid for the entire year: $5,040 + $840 = $5,880
Response:  Since Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed to refill her tank with 4 gallons of gasoline again, we know that she used 25 gallons (100 / 4 = 25) of gasoline during her trip. Now, according to the man who helped her, the tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline. Therefore, the number of times Sophia could fill her tank with gasoline is equal to the amount of gasoline she used divided by the capacity of the tank: Number of fills = Used gasoline / Tank capacity = 25 / 12 = 2.  So, Sophia could fill her tank with gasoline twice during her trip.
Response:  If Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads for half an hour every day, he spends a total of 2 + (1/2) = 3 hours per day on these activities. Since there are 7 days in a week, he spends a total of 3 x 7 = 21 hours per week on these activities.
Response:  For each girls' team, there are 5 players, so for all 10 teams, there are 50 players in total (5 x 10 = 50). Similarly, for each boys' team, there are also 5 players, so for all 10 teams, there are again 50 players in total (5 x 10 = 50). Finally, since each school has one coach, there is only 1 coach among all schools (1), so the total number of people who were sent to the competition is 61 (50 + 1 = 61).
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies in total. Since we have more rubies than diamonds, let's assume that x represents the number of rubies and y represents the number of diamonds.  Now, based on the information given in the problem, we can write two equations:  Equation 1: Number of rubies = 35  Equation 2: Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies  Substituting equation 1 into equation 2, we get:  Total number of gems = 175 + 35  = 210  Therefore, there are 210 gems inside the pouch.
Response:  We know that there are 2 times more male students than female students in Dr. Wertz's school. So if there are 60 female students and 5 male students per teacher, then the total number of teachers is:  Number of male students x Total number of classes = 2 x (Number of female students / 5)  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Number of male students = 60 Batang babae = 30 Ilan ng guro = 2 x (60/5) = 12 Therefore, there are 12 teachers in Dr. Wertz's school.
Response:  Bailey starts with $100 and gets an allowance of $5 every week for 8 weeks. So, after 8 weeks, Bailey has $100 + (8 x $5) = $100 + $40 = $140. Therefore, Bailey ends up with $140.
Response:  If Judy teaches 5 classes of dance per week (Monday to Friday), that means she has 5 x 7 = 35 students in total. Since each class has 15 students and Judy charges $15 per student, her total earnings for one week are:  Total Earnings = Number of Students x Price Per Student = 35 x $15 = $525.
Response:  If there are two dishes to prepare and each dish requires 10 ingredients, then we need 2 x 10 = 20 ingredients in total. However, if one of the dishes has only two ingredients, then we only need 2 + 2 = 4 additional ingredients for that dish. Therefore, the total number of ingredients needed to prepare both dishes is 20 + 4 = 24 ingredients.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Tommy earned from selling brownies. Since he sold 43 brownies and each brownie costs $3, his total earnings from brownies would be:

$3 x 43 = $130

Next, let's calculate how much money Tommy earned from selling cheesecakes. He sold 23 pieces of cheesecake and each piece costs $4, so his total earnings from cheesecakes would be:

$4 x 23 = $92

Therefore, Tommy's total earnings are:

$130 + $92 = $222

So, the answer is $222."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Shiela will spend for each of the five phones she wants to buy. Since there are three payments per month, and each payment is $150, then the total cost of each phone would be:  $150 x 3 = $450  Next, we need to calculate the interest that Shiela will pay for each phone. The interest rate is 2%, so we can calculate it as follows:  Interest = Principal x Rate x Time  In this case, the principal (or amount borrowed) is $450, and the time is 3 months. So, the interest Shiela will pay for each phone is:  Interest = $450 x 2% x 3/12 = $18  Therefore, the total cost of each phone including interest is:  Total Cost = Principal + Interest = $450 + $18 = $468  Now, let's calculate the total cost of all five phones that Shiela wants to buy:  Total Cost = Number of Phones x Total Cost per Phone  In this case, Shiela wants to buy 5 phones, so the total cost would be:  Total Cost = 5 x $468 = $2340  Finally, we need to calculate how much Shiela will pay every month for the next 3 months to fully settle her debt. We can use the formula:  Monthly Payment = Total Cost / Number of Payments  In this case, the total cost is $2340, and the number of payments is 3. So, the monthly payment would be:  Monthly Payment = $2340 / 3 = $746  There you have it! That's how Shiela calculates her monthly payments for her $2340 worth of smartphones with an interest rate of 2%.
Response:  If we assume that all of Artie's prices are in dollars and he sells x units of each flower, then we can write an equation for his total revenue as follows:  Total Revenue = Price of Marigolds x Number of Marigolds + Price of Petunias x Number of Petunias + Price of Begonias x Number of Begonias  Substituting the given values, we get:  Total Revenue = ($2.74 x 12) + ($1.87 x 9) + ($2.12 x 17)  Simplifying and solving for x, we find that Artie will make a total of:  Total Revenue = $35.04  So, if Artie sells 12 marigolds, 9 petunias, and 17 begonias, he will make a total of $35.04.
Response:  If each level of the castle has an area of 16 square meters as stated in the problem, then the total area of all four levels will be equal to the product of their individual areas. Therefore, we can write: Area of entire castle = Area of first level x Area of second level x Area of third level x Area of fourth level  Since the first level has an area of 16 square meters, and there are four levels in total, we can calculate the area of each subsequent level by multiplying it by 4: Area of second level = 16 x 4 = 64 square meters Area of third level = 64 x 4 = 256 square meters Area of fourth level = 256 x 4 = 1024 square meters Now, let's find out what the total area of the castle is: Total area of castle = Area of first level + Area of second level + Area of third level + Area of fourth level Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get: Total area of castle = 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024 = 1456 square meters So, the total area of the sandcastle is 1456 square meters.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many supplements of food are needed for the dog in its first year. According to the information given, the dog needs to be fed 180 days worth of food during this period. Since each supplement contains 110 tasa of food, the total number of supplements needed can be calculated as follows:

Number of supplements = Total number of days / Number of tasa per supplement
= 180 days / 110 tasa
= 16.36 supplements (round up to nearest whole number)
Therefore, Cecilia will need approximately 17 supplements of food for her dog during its first year."
Response:  If Raymond does half of Sarah's work (4 beses = 2 beses), then he does 2 x 400 = 800 pounds of laundry.  Similarly, if David does 4 times as much work as Sarah (4 x 400 = 1600 pounds), then he does twice as much laundry as Raymond (1600 - 800 = 800 pounds). Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 800 pounds.
Response:  If Vincent buys three bunches of flowers for $2.50 each, he will spend $7.50 in total.  If he buys two bunches of flowers for $1 each, he will also spend $2 in total. So, his total spending is $9.50. Now, let's calculate how much he saved by buying the flowers at a better price: Savings = Total amount spent at the better price - Total amount spent at the original price In this case, the total amount spent at the better price is $9.50, and the total amount spent at the original price is $9.50 + $7.50 = $17. So, Vincent saved $7.50 by buying the flowers at a better price.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money John spent in buying the dog. According to the question, he paid $100 for the dog. So, his cost = $100.  Next, we need to find out how much discount the groomer gave him. The question states that the groomer offered him a 30% discount, which means he got a discount of $30 (30% of $100). So, his actual cost from the groomer = $70 ($100 - $30).  Finally, we need to add the cost from the groomer to the original cost of the dog to get the total amount John spent on getting the dog and having it groomed. Therefore, his total cost = $100 + $70 = $170.
Response:  The first two women each received 1/6 of 24 liters of water, so they together received 2 x 1/6 = 3 liters of water. Then, the boy took 6 liters of water, leaving 3 + 6 = 9 liters of water remaining. Therefore, there are 9 liters of water left after all three individuals have taken their shares.
Response:  Firstly, Charlie bought 21 stickers from a store in the mall and got 23 stickers as a gift for his birthday. So, he now has a total of 44 stickers (21 + 23). Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister who used them all. So, Charlie still has 35 stickers left (44 - 9 = 35). Therefore, there are 35 stickers remaining with Charlie.
Response:  The weight of Grace is 125 pounds or 56.7 kg. The weight of Alex is less than four times that of Grace, so we can write:  Alex's weight = x kg where x is a number between 0 and 4. Since Alex's weight is less than four times that of Grace, we know that x < 4x = 224 kg (since 4 times 56.7 kg is equal to 224 kg). Therefore, the weight of Alex is between 0 and 224 kg, inclusive. Now, let's find the exact value of x using the given information. We know that Alex's weight is less than four times that of Grace, so we can write: Alex's weight = 4Grace's weight - 4x = 4(56.7) - 4x = 224 - 4x kg. Substituting the values we have obtained, we get: Alex's weight = 224 - 4(56.7) = 224 - 224 = 0 kg. So, the weight of Alex is zero! This means that Alex does not exist in this scenario.
Response:  If there are 3 roses and each rose has 25 petals, then the total number of petals is: 3 x 25 = 75 petals. Now, if each rose has 10 tines, then the total number of tines among all three roses is: 75 / 10 = 7.5 tines. So, there are 7 tines in total.
Response:  If there are 22 players in total playing football and they won 8 more games than they lost, then we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of games played = Number of wins + Number of losses  In this case, if we assume that the team won 8 more games than it lost, then the number of wins is equal to the number of losses plus 8. So, let's substitute this value into our previous equation:  Total number of games played = Number of wins + Number of losses + 8  Now, we know that the number of wins is equal to the number of losses plus 8, so we can simplify the equation as follows:  Total number of games played = (Number of losses + 8)  Since we were given that the team has 22 players, we can use this information to find out how many games each player played. Specifically, since there are 22 players and each player plays one game at a time, then the total number of games played must be equal to 22. Therefore, we have two equations and two unknowns:  Number of wins = Number of losses + 8  And Total number of games played = 22  We can solve for both variables using substitution or elimination methods. For example, using substitution method, we can start with the first equation:  Number of wins = Number of losses + 8  Substituting the value of number of losses from the second equation:  Number of wins = (22 - 8) + 8  Simplifying:  Number of wins = 14  Now, we can use this value to find out how many games each player played. Since there are 22 players and each player plays one game at a time, then the total number of games played must be equal to 22. Therefore, we have found the solution to the problem:  The team played 14 games.
Response: 1. The number of T-shirts that Gene has collected = 5 (since he collects one from each trip). 2. The number of quilt blocks made from each T-shirt = 4 (since each T-shirt yields 4 quilt blocks). 3. The total number of quilt blocks = 5 x 4 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 quilt blocks in total.
Response:  On the first day, the alarm rings three times. On the second day, the alarm rings four times (since it rang thrice the previous day). On the third day, the alarm rings five times (since it rang four times the previous day). Therefore, the number of times the alarm rang during those three days is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. So, there were 12 times the alarm rang during that period.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate Sylvie's salary after three years of service based on the given information. According to the problem, each employee receives an additional $600 per month as a bonus for staying with the company for five consecutive years. Therefore, if Sylvie has worked for the company for three years, her bonus would be $600 x 3 = $1800 per year. Since the company increases the salary of each employee by 10% every year, Sylvie's annual salary after three years of service would be $1800 + (10% x $1800) = $2040. So, Sylvie's salary after three years of service is $2040. Now, let's assume that Sylvie continues working for the company for two more years or a total of five years. Based on the given information, each employee receives an additional $600 per month as a bonus for staying with the company for five consecutive years. Therefore, Sylvie's bonus for the fifth year would be $600 x 5 = $3000. Adding this amount to her annual salary after three years of service, we get $2040 + $3000 = $5040. Thus, Sylvie's salary after five years of service is $5040.
Response:  If Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than Harold, then for every copy that Marilyn sold, Harold sold 1/10 of that amount. So if Marilyn sold x copies, Harold sold x/10 = 10x/10 = 1x copies. Since they both bought 88,000 copies together, we can set up the equation:  Marilyn's total sales = 10x  Harold's total sales = 1x + 88,000 Now we need to find out what value of 'x' satisfies this equation. Solving for 'x', we get:  x = 88,000 / (10 - 1)  = 88,000 / 9 = 9,777 copies  Therefore, Harold sold 9,777 copies and Marilyn sold 90,223 copies.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many guests are expected to attend the party based on the fact that 1/4 of the invited guests did not show up. So, if 16 friends were invited, and 1/4 of them did not come (which means 4 friends did not come), then the total number of guests who attended the party is:  
Total Number of Guests = Total Invited Guests - Number of Non-Attendees = 16 x 0.75 = 12 guests.  Now, since each guest requires 75 gift bags, the total number of gift bags needed is:  
Total Number of Gift Bags Required = Total Number of Guests x Number of Gifts per Guest = 12 x 75 = 900 gift bags.  Therefore, the total cost of the gift bags is:  
Total Cost of Gift Bags = Total Number of Gift Bags Required x Cost per Gift Bag = 900 x $2 = $1800."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 baby dinosaurs attending the picnic. Each adult dinosaur can eat 10 pounds of potato salad, while each baby dinosaur can eat half of what an adult can eat (since they are smaller). Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for all the adult dinosaurs is: 20 x 10 = 200 pounds. For the baby dinosaurs, it's 5 x 5 = 25 pounds. So, in total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

Jan has 3 x 4 = 12 animals."
Response:  Age of Amy = 5 years old  Age of Jackson = x years old (older than Amy)  Age of Corey = 2 years old (younger than Amy and Jackson)  Age of James = 10 years old + 1 year (younger than Corey)  Now we can calculate the age difference between Jackson and Corey:  Age difference = Jackson - Corey = x - 1 = 9 years old  So, Jackson is 9 years older than Corey.
"Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds with his original diet, then he can run 400 meters in x seconds with his new diet that increases his speed by 10%. So, we can set up the equation:

x = 38 + (10% of 38)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 38 + 3.8 = 42 seconds

Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters in 42 seconds with his new diet."
Response:  If there are 12 fewer birds than dogs in the neighborhood and there are 60 dogs, then there are 48 less birds than dogs. So if there are two cats for every dog, and there are 48 less birds than dogs, then there are 96 birds in the neighborhood.
Response:  We know that out of 200 grade 5 students, 100 are boys and 100 are girls. Among these girls, 2/3 or 67 are in the Girl Scouts. So, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts is 67 - 67 = 0. Therefore, there are no girls who are not in the Girl Scouts.
"Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for only 2/3 of that time (which is equal to 6 hours), then we can calculate how many more hours Harry slept than James as follows:

Time difference = Total sleep time of Harry - Total sleep time of James
= 9 hours - 6 hours
= 3 hours

So, Harry slept for 3 hours more than James."
"Response:  If Freda uses 16 ons of tomatoes per batch and her last batch made 32 ons of salsa, then she used a total of:

16 ons x (number of batches) = total number of tomatoes used

We are given that there were 5 batches in total. So, we can calculate the total number of tomatoes used as follows:

Total number of tomatoes used = 16 ons x 5 batches = 80 ons
Therefore, Freda used 80 ons of tomatoes to make 32 ons of salsa."
Response:  The total number of cars that passed through the intersection in 15 minutes is given as 20 x 15 = 300 cars. Since 5 cars from each lane do not need to stop at the traffic light, the actual number of cars that needed to stop is 300 - 5 = 295 cars. Now, let's find out how many cars were able to take the exit without stopping at the traffic light. From the question, we know that there are 30 cars that can take the exit without stopping at the traffic light every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, the total number of cars that took the exit without stopping at the traffic light is 30 x 15 = 450 cars. Therefore, the number of cars that did not pass through the intersection and had to stop at the traffic light is 295 - 450 = -75 cars.
Response:  If Maria has 18 new plants in her garden and she already has 2 plants in one of the 40 big pots in her house, then the total number of plants she has is: 18 + 2 = 20. So, there are 20 plants remaining in the banga after Maria gave some to her friends and family.
Response:  The first friend clicks the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opens it. This means that in total, there are 20 + 1 = 21 clicks of the doorbell.  The second friend clicks the doorbell 1/4 as many times as the first friend, which is 5 times (since 1/4 x 20 = 5). So, the total number of clicks from both friends is 21 + 5 = 26.  The third friend clicks the doorbell 10 times more than the second friend, so they click the doorbell 35 times ( since 10 x 5 = 50, and 50 - 26 = 35). Therefore, the total number of rings made by all three friends is 26 + 35 = 61.
"Response:  If Solo needs to read 4 pages from his science book, 20 pages from his political science book, 7 pages from his history book, and 8 pages from his grammar book, then he needs to read a total of:

So, if he has 4 days left to finish reading all the required pages, he will need to read:

24 x 4 = 96 pages in total

Therefore, Solo needs to read approximately 96 pages in total over the course of 4 days."
Response:  We know that John drinks water every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. So he drinks 3 times a day x 7 days = 21 glasses of water per week. Since we are asked about the number of glasses of water he drank in one week, the answer is 21 glasses.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how long it will take to cover one mile of land with the umbrella. According to the question, it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3 miles of land. Therefore, if we want to cover the entire 42 miles of land, it will take 42 x 10 = 420 minutes or 7 hours and 20 minutes. Now, let's calculate the time required to cover the entire area of the city using the same formula. The city has an area of 42 miles from the sea to the opposite hill, which means that the total area of the city is 42 x 6 = 252 miles. Therefore, it will take 252 x 10 = 2520 minutes or 41 hours and 40 minutes to cover the entire area of the city using the umbrella.

Now, Poppy's mother places the third part of the puzzle which contains 200 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of puzzle that needs to be placed is 500 + 200 = 700 pieces. Therefore, the answer is 700.
Response:  If Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, then Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. So, if Amir eats 5 cookies, then the total number of cookies that both Cody and Amir eat is 15 + 5 = 20 cookies. Therefore, the answer is 20.
"Response:  Firstly, we have three pieces of wood with dimensions as follows:
John's first piece of wood has a length of 5 inches and a width of 6 inches. Therefore, its area is 5 x 6 = 30 square inches.
John's second piece of wood has a length of 4 inches and a width of 6 inches. Therefore, its area is 4 x 6 = 24 square inches.
John's third piece of wood has a length of 5 inches and a width of 4 inches. Therefore, its area is 5 x 4 = 20 square inches.
Now, let's calculate the total area of all three pieces of wood together:
Total area = Area of first piece + Area of second piece + Area of third piece
= 30 + 24 + 20
= 74 square inches
Therefore, the total number of cubes that can be made from these three pieces of wood is 74 / 1 = 74 cubes."
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday (Lunes and Martes), he watched his favorite show for an hour in the evening. On Wednesday (Miyerkules), he finished his homework early and watched two hours of his favorite show. On Thursday (Huwebes), he woke up early and watched one hour of his favorite show. On Friday (Biyenos), he could sleep late because of the weekend, so he watched two hours of his favorite show. If he watched TV for 7 hours in total, then he must have watched 30 minutes of his favorite show on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is 30 minutes.
Response:  According to the problem, Henry made 15 more cookies than he intended last year. So if he intended to make 20 cookies (as indicated by his goal of doubling his income), then he actually made 35 cookies (20 + 15). Since he now has 110 biscuits, that means he made an additional 75 biscuits beyond what he intended (110 - 35 = 75). Therefore, Henry made 75 cookies last year.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much the customer will pay for the gasoline without any discount or reward. In this case, the price of one gallon of gasoline is $3.00. So, if the customer buys 10 gallons of gasoline, they will pay $30.00 (10 x $3.00).  Next, we need to apply the $0.20 cashback reward per gallon. Since the customer bought 10 gallons of gasoline, they will receive a total of $2.00 in cashback rewards ($0.20 x 10 gallons). Therefore, the final amount that the customer will pay for their gasoline is $28.00 ($30.00 - $2.00).
Response:  Firstly, we know that both Marcell and Beatrice had rolled up their respective numbers of fruits.  For Marcell, he had rolled 3 times and got 14 fruits each time, so he has a total of 42 fruits (14 x 3 = 42). Similarly, for Beatrice, she had rolled 2 times and got 24 fruits each time, so she has a total of 48 fruits (24 x 2 = 48). Now, since they are competing against each other to see who can eat more fruits in one sitting, we need to find out how many fruits each of them can eat in one sitting. To do this, we will divide the number of fruits they have by the number of times they rolled. So, for Marcell, he can eat 42 / 3 = 14 fruits per roll, while for Beatrice, she can eat 48 / 2 = 24 fruits per roll. Therefore, if they were to compete against each other, Marcell would be able to eat 14 fruits per roll, while Beatrice would be able to eat 24 fruits per roll.
Response:  First, we need to find out how much water is left in the boat after Julia reaches the shore. We are given that it takes her 12 minutes to reach the shore, and she starts with 10 liters of water for every 5 meters she swims. Since there are 30 meters between the starting point and the shore, she will use 30/5 = 6 liters of water during this distance. So, after reaching the shore, she has 10 - 6 = 4 liters of water left. Now, let's calculate how many seconds Julia spends swimming while the boat is leaking. We know that the boat leaks at a rate of 2 liters per minute, so if Julia spends x minutes swimming, she will lose x \* 2 = 2x liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water lost by the boat during Julia's swim is 4 + 2x = 4 + 2(x) liters. Finally, since Julia needs 64 seconds to reach the shore, we can set up the equation: Total water lost = Time taken to reach shore / Rate of leakage. Solving for x, we get: x = 64 / (2 \* 12) = 168. So, Julia loses 168 liters of water during her swim.
Response:  Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons per day, the total number of lessons taught in one day is 4 x 2 = 8.  If the whiteboard is erased 3 times per lesson, then it will be erased 8 x 3 = 24 times in one day. Therefore, the answer to the question is 24.
Response:  If Ryan has 2 bulaklaks in his garden every day for 15 days and he doesn't add any new ones during that time, then after 15 days, he will have a total of 2 x 15 = 30 bulaklaks in his garden. Since 5 of them are not growing, the remaining 25 bulaklaks will be growing. So, the answer is 25.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jamal's phone can hold more images than Brittany's phone because it has a higher capacity. Specifically, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times as many images as Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone can hold 50 images, then Jamal's phone can hold 300 images (6 x 50 = 300).  Now, let's consider the number of ducks in each image. We are told that the highest number of ducks in any one image is 20. Therefore, the total number of ducks in all 300 images is 300 x 20 = 6000 ducks.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the boards that Sasha has bought. The cost per piece of each type of board is as follows:  * Small boards (3 x 4): $10/piece = $30  * Large boards (4 x 4): $16/piece = $64  Therefore, the total cost of all the boards that Sasha has bought is: $30 + $64 = $94  Next, we need to calculate the profit that Sasha will make if she sells all the boards at their original prices. The profit for each small board sold is: $10 - ($10 / 2) = $5  Similarly, the profit for each large board sold is: $16 - ($16 / 2) = $8  So, the total profit that Sasha will make from selling all the boards is: $5 x 3 = $15 + $8 x 2 = $23  Finally, we can calculate the total amount that Sasha will earn if she sells all the boards by multiplying the number of boards she has with the profit per board: $94 x $15 = $1,390 + $23 x 2 = $46  Therefore, the total amount that Sasha will earn if she sells all the boards is $1,436.
Response:  If Katy uses 7:13 of water and makes 120 cups of coffee using those 7:13, then we can calculate how many cups she made in total. So, if she used 7/13 of water to make 120 cups of coffee, that means she used (7 x 120) / 13 = 960 milliliters of water to make all those cups of coffee.
Response:  If John has 3 children and he bought 2 pairs of shoes for each child, then he bought a total of 6 pairs of shoes (2 x 3 = 6). Since each pair costs $60, the total cost that John paid is $60 x 6 = $360. So, John paid $360 for the shoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two containers of imported cars with each containing 5 cars inside. So in total, there are 10 cars (2 containers x 5 cars/container).  Now, let's assume that there will be more containers arriving in the future and the number of cars in each container remains constant at 5. To calculate the total number of cars that will arrive in the next day, we can multiply the number of containers expected to arrive by the average number of cars per container. Therefore, the estimated number of cars that will arrive in the next day is:  Total Number of Cars = Expected Number of Containers x Average Number of Cars per Container = 2 x 5 = 10 cars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adrien's salary increased by 30% after four years, and his current salary is higher than Lylah's by 20%. So, if Adrien's salary increases by 40% in five years, then his new salary will be higher than Lylah's by 60%, or $80,000 - $50,000 = $30,000. Therefore, Adrien's total income over five years will be $40,000 x 5 = $200,000 + $30,000 = $230,000.
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week for his drawing hobby and there are 30 sheets in one pad of paper, then he will use 15 sheets (2 x 7 = 14) sheets of paper per month since there are 4 weeks in a month. So, the answer is 15.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Morisette brought 5 mangos and 8 kilograms of sugarcane to the party. On the other hand, Kael brought two baskets full of mangoes and half of a basket of sugarcane more than what Morisette brought. So, if we calculate the total number of mangoes they have, it would be:  Number of mangoes = (2 x 2) + 5 = 10 mangoes  Therefore, they have 10 mangoes in total.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. If she overslept by 2 hours each day, that means she slept for 6 hours on Tuesday and 4 hours on Wednesday. So, in total, she slept for 10 hours during the week (8 + 6 + 4 = 10).
Response:  If Rosie can run for 10 miles in 3 hours, then she can cover a distance of 10 x 3 = 30 miles in 3 hours. Now, after running for 3 hours, she covers an additional distance of 5 miles in 1 hour, so her total distance covered in 7 hours will be 30 + 5 = 35 miles. Therefore, Rosie can run a maximum distance of 35 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  If there are 60 letters that need to be stamped and Jennie can help with her mother's office work, then she can stamp 1/2 of the total number of letters, which is 60 / 2 = 30 letters per day. Since there are 30 days left before the deadline, the total number of letters that will be stamped until the deadline is 30 x 30 = 900 letters. So, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie started helping is 900 - 30 = 870 letters. Therefore, the number of letters that were still remaining to be stamped when Jennie started helping is 900 - 870 = 30 letters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia bought 5 new packages of kutsara for her party because she noticed that there were no more plastic spoons left in the house. So, initially, Julia had 5 new kutsara. Then, her husband also bought another package of 5 new kutsara, which he gave to Julia while she was preparing the inumin. Therefore, Julia now has a total of 10 new kutsara (5 + 5). Finally, when she was setting the table, she had 12 kutsara in total (10 from her husband plus 2 from the initial 5 she had). So, the number of kutsara in the package that Julia bought is 12.
"Response:  We know that Dylan needs to buy sausages for a party and he has decided to buy 38 chicken sausages and 6 more than the number of fish sausages. So, if we let x be the number of fish sausages, then we can write an equation as follows:

Number of chicken sausages = 38
Number of fish sausages = x + 6

Now, we need to find out how many sausages Dylan bought in total. Since there are 2 types of sausages (chicken and fish), we can use the concept of ""addition"" to find the total number of sausages. Therefore, the answer is:

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
= 38 + (x + 6)
= 44

So, Dylan bought 44 sausages in total."
Response:  If Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, then Lily has x friends. Since Lily has 50 friends in total, we can write an equation as follows:  Amy - 20 = Lily + x  Substituting Amy's value of 20 into this equation gives us:  Lily + x = 30  Now, we can solve for x by subtracting Lily from both sides of the equation:  x = 10  Therefore, Lily and Amy have 10 friends each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one watermelon costs Php 30, and each paprika costs Php 20. Therefore, if Dillon buys 4 watermelons, he will spend Php 120 for them (Php 30 x 4 = Php 120). Secondly, since each kahel costs Php 5 less than a karengga, we can assume that one kahel costs Php 25 (Php 30 - Php 5 = Php 25). So, if Dillon buys 10 kahels, he will spend Php 250 for them (Php 25 x 10 = Php 250). Finally, to find out how much money Dillon will spend in total, we just need to add up the cost of all the items he wants to buy: Php 120 + Php 250 = Php 370. Therefore, the answer is Php 370.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many patients are being treated in one day. According to the question, ""Isang ospital ang tumatanggap ng 500 katao sa isang araw."" So, the number of patients per day = 500.  Next, we need to calculate how long each patient stays in the hospital. As stated in the question, ""Ang bawat pasyente ay tinitingnan sa loob ng 24 minuto."" Therefore, the time each patient spends in the hospital = 24 minutes.  Now, let's calculate the total earnings of the hospital from these patients. Based on the information provided earlier, ""Ang mga doktor ay nagbabayad ng $150 bawat oras sa ospital"" and ""Ang ospital ay nagbabayad ng $200 bawat oras sa mga pasyente."" The total earnings of the hospital from all patients = Total amount earned by doctors + Total amount earned by the hospital. = ($150 x Number of patients) + ($200 x Number of patients).  To find out the total number of patients, we can use the formula: Total number of patients = Total number of patients per day x Number of days. = (500 x Number of days).  Substituting the value for 'Number of days', which is equal to 1, we get: Total number of patients = 500 x 1 = 500 patients.  Now that we have found the total number of patients, we can calculate their total earnings as follows: Total earnings of the hospital from all patients = Total amount earned by doctors + Total amount earned by the hospital. = ($150 x 500) + ($200 x 500).  Calculating the total earnings, we get: Total earnings of the hospital from all patients = ($75,000 + $100,000) = $175,000.  Therefore, the answer to the question is: The hospital earns $175,000 from treating 500 patients in one day."
Response:  We know that there are 60 workers in total who will play with the toys for 3 hours each day. Since 1/4 of the elves stop playing after 2 hours, we can calculate how many elves will be left after 3 hours as follows:  Number of elves = Total number of elves x Time played / Time taken to finish the task  Number of elves = 60 x (3/8) = 15 So, there are 15 elves left after 3 hours.
Response:  The cost of Joseph in May is $500. In June, his expense decreases to $60, which is lower than the previous month. To find out how much he spent over two months, we need to subtract the amount he spent in June from what he spent in May: $500 - $60 = $440. So, Joseph spent $440 over two months.
Response:  Pam and Fred rode the roller coaster twice each, so together they rode it 4 times (2 x 2). Then, they both rode the log ride twice, for a total of 8 rides between them (4 + 4). Since each ride cost $6, how many tickets did they use in total that day?  Total number of tickets used = Number of rides x Cost per ride = 8 x $6 = $48.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Walt walked for 4 miles. On Tuesday (Martes), he walked for 6 times more than on Monday, which is 24 miles (6 x 4 = 24). So far, he has walked a total of 41 miles from Monday to Wednesday (Miyerkules). To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the distance he walked on Monday from the total distance he walked from Monday to Wednesday: 41 - 4 = 37 miles. Therefore, Walt walked 37 miles on Wednesday.
Response:  If Tom gets 4 car washes in one month and each car wash costs $15, then he spends:  Total cost of 4 car washes = Number of car washes x Cost per car wash = 4 x $15 = $60. So, Tom spends $60 in one year if he gets 4 car washes every month.
Response:  If Brian has 5 more video games than Bobby, then Bobby has 3 video games.  Since Brian has 20 video games in total and lost 5 before finishing his task, Bobby has 15 video games.
Response:  We know that there are four unicorns in total. One of them is already located somewhere else in the world (May 27). So, we have three unicorns left. Two of these unicorns are female (in Scotland). Therefore, the number of female unicorns in Scotland is two.  So, the final answer is: Three unicorns in total, and two of them are females in Scotland.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each item in the order:  * Sub sandwiches - $7.50 x 2 = $15.00  * Chips - $1.50 x 2 = $3.00  * Cookies - $1.00 x 2 = $2.00 Next, we add up all these costs: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 Finally, if there is a 20% service charge added (as requested), we multiply the total cost by 1.20: $20.00 x 1.20 = $24.00 So, the total cost of the order for delivery is $24.00.
Response:  If it took Mark 75 minutes to complete the first subtest with 75 questions and he answered them at a rate of 5 questions per hour, then the time taken to answer each question was: Time = Number of questions / Rate  Time = 75/5 = 15 minutes per question. Now, if Marcos takes 8 hours to complete the second subtest with 100 questions, then the time taken to answer each question would be: Time = Number of questions / Rate  Time = 100/5 = 20 minutes per question. Therefore, Marcos did not finish 43 questions in the second subtest because he needed more than 20 minutes to answer each question.
Response:  We know that there are 22 pink gumballs in total and we have already counted 12 of them. So, if we subtract 12 from 22, we get 10 left. Now, let's assume that each box contains 4 gumballs (based on the information given). Therefore, to find out how many boxes contain rosas, we can divide the remaining number of gumballs (10) by 4. This gives us an answer of 2.5 boxes containing rosas. Since you cannot have a fraction of a box, the final answer is 2 boxes containing rosas.
Response:  There are 20 vehicles in total, and we know that 12 of them are automatic, which means they have an automatic transmission system. We also know that 4 of them are manual, meaning their drivers need to manually shift gears using a clutch pedal and a gearshift lever. Finally, there are 4 semi-automatic vehicles, which have both automatic and manual transmission systems combined. So, if we divide the number of semi-automatic vehicles (4) by the total number of vehicles (20), we get approximately 0.2 or 20%. Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic vehicles among all the vehicles is around 20%.
Response:  There are 700 bees in the society.  Two times more workers than baby bees means there are 2 x 35 = 70 worker bees. Similarly, two times more baby bees than queen bees means there are 2 x 10 = 20 baby bees. Therefore, the total number of worker bees is 70, and the total number of baby bees is 20. So, the total number of bees that work in the society is 70 + 20 = 90 bees.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a day. According to the question, he plays for 2 hours every day. Therefore, his daily time spent playing video games = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.  Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan earns from his part-time job. Based on the information provided, he earns $10 per hour. So, his weekly income from part-time job = $10/hour x 14 hours/week = $140/week.  Now, let's find out how much money Jordan can save if he stops playing video games and uses that time to work at his part-time job instead. His weekly savings = $140/week - $140/week (his weekly income from part-time job) = $0/week. In other words, Jordan will not have any additional savings if he stops playing video games and works more hours at his part-time job.
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate the total cost of all items that John bought: Gatas - $2 x 5 = $10 Itlog - $3 x 5 = $15 Bombilya - $3 x 5 = $15 Tasa - $3 x 5 = $15 Bitag - $4 x 5 = $20 Total Cost = $10 + $15 + $15 + $15 + $20 = $75 Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total cost: Discount = $75 x 10% = $7.50 So, the final cost of all items without the discount is $75, and with the discount is $75 - $7.50 = $67.50
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the products that Kim needs to buy for her clients. The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost of each package of cloth is $5, so the total cost of these items is:  $2 x 3 = $6 + $5 x 5 = $25. Therefore, the total cost of goods sold (COGS) is $31 ($6 + $25). Next, we need to calculate the revenue from selling these products. If Kim charges $92 per week, then she will make $92 x 5 weeks = $460 in revenue. Finally, we can calculate the profit margin as follows: Profit Margin = Revenue - COGS / Revenue = $460 - $31 / $460 = 38%. So, if Kim sells these products every week, her profit would be $38 per week.
Response:  If John has 10 hectares of land planted with pineapples and each hectare produces 100 pineapples per harvest, then he can harvest 1000 pineapples (10 x 100) every three months. Therefore, John can collect 4000 pineapples (1000 x 4) in one year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 500 pieces in one of the boxes and 3 times as many pieces in another box (i.e., 3 x 500 = 1500). Additionally, there is a third box with 1/4 of all the pieces (i.e., 1500 / 4 = 375). So, in total, Johnny has collected 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 pieces of Legos. Therefore, the correct answer is 2375.
Response:  The first group of bees that left the hive returned after 6 hours, and then there were 30 bees that left again after another 6 hours. So in total, there were 30 + 15 = 45 bees that left the hive during the day. Since half of them returned after 6 hours, the number of bees that did not return is 45 - (number of bees that returned) = 45 - 15 = 30. Therefore, the number of bees that did not return to the hive after 6 hours was 30.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brittany paid $12 for her ticket as an adult and $10 for her daughter's ticket. So, the total amount of money she spent is $12 + $10 = $22. Now, since her daughter gave her $8, the remaining amount of money Brittany has after giving it to the cashier is $22 - $8 = $14. Therefore, the number of dollars Brittany gave to the cashier is $14.
Response:  If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and James has 4 times as many friends as Charlie (i.e., 4 x 12 = 48), then James must have at least 48 friends on Facebook. Since we are told that James has more friends than Dorothy, this means that James has more than 36 friends on Facebook (since Dorothy only has 30). So, the correct answer is 48 or more.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how long it takes for Steve to reach his home from school. Since he lives 3 miles away and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute, it will take him 13 minutes to reach his home (3 miles / 440 ft/min = 13 min). Now, let's find out how long it takes for Tim to reach his home from school. Since he lives 2 miles away and can skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, it will take him 8 minutes to reach his home (2 miles / 264 ft/min = 8 min). So, if they both start at the same time, Steve will arrive at his home first since he has a longer distance to cover. Therefore, the answer is 13 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are five people who came to inflate two tires each day. So in total, they will need 10 gulongs (2 x 5 = 10). Now, each gulong costs Php 25, so the total cost for these five people will be Php 25 x 10 = Php 250. Next, three more people arrived later to collect all their tire patches. Since each person needs one tray of tire patches per day, and there were three people, they needed a total of 3 trays (3 x 1 = 3). Each tray contains 48 pieces of tire patches, so the total number of tire patches needed was 3 x 48 = 144 pieces. Finally, there was one person who bought an unicycle. We don't know how much he paid for it, but let's assume it was $10. Therefore, the total amount earned by the shop that day was Php 250 + $10 = Php 260.
Response:  If Carl buys 7 packages of cookies and each package contains 5 cookies, then he will buy 7 x 5 = 35 cookies in total. Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl will spend $35 / 100 = $0.35 for all the cookies. Now, if Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will have $10 - $0.35 = $9.65 left over after paying for the cookies.
Response: 1) Dave bought a big package of French fries and ate 4 before a hungry seagull stole the rest from his hand. 2) The seagull ate half of the remaining French fries. After that, three crabs came and ate each of them. 3) When they were done, they left six French fries behind. So, there are 6 French fries in the package that Dave bought.
Response:  On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Kimo has three hours of class per day. So in one semester, he attends 16 weeks of classes with each week having 3 hours of class per day. Therefore, Kimo spends 48 hours per week on his studies (3 hours/day x 16 weeks/semester). In one semester, Kimo spends a total of 720 hours on his studies (48 hours/week x 16 weeks/semester).
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many pieces of each item are there in total.  For bread (baguette), there are 60 pieces x 2 inches = 120 inches.  For pastries (croissants), there are 120 pieces x 6 inches = 720 inches. And for cookies (chocolate chip), there are 300 pieces x 4 inches = 1200 inches. So, in total, there are 120 + 720 + 1200 = 2240 inches of food. Now, if Bill eats all these food items every day, he will have consumed a total of 2240 inches x 365 days = 809,400 inches of food per year.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many saging are needed for each species in one month. For example, if there are 200 Unggoy, they will need 200 x 2 = 400 saging per month. Similarly, if there are 40 Gorilya, they will need 40 x 2 = 80 saging per month, and if there are 30 Baboon, they will need 30 x 2 = 60 saging per month. Now, let's calculate the total number of saging needed for all three species in two months: Total Number of Saging Needed = (Number of Unggoy x Number of Saging per Month) + (Number of Gorilya x Number of Saging per Month) + (Number of Baboon x Number of Saging per Month) Total Number of Saging Needed = (200 x 4) + (40 x 2) + (30 x 2) Total Number of Saging Needed = 800 + 80 + 60 Total Number of Saging Needed = 940 saging. Therefore, the Zoo needs to order 940 saging every two months to ensure that all the animals have enough food to last them for two months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Blake runs back and forth for 15 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, Blake runs a total of 900 seconds (15 x 60) during this time.  Next, we learn that Kelly also runs back and forth, but only for 34 times. Each time she runs, she covers a distance of 40 yards (since she starts running from the 40-yard line). Therefore, the total distance Kelly covers is 40 x 34 = 1360 yards.  Now, let's compare their speeds. Blake runs a total distance of 900 seconds, which means he covers a distance of 900 / 15 = 60 yards per minute. On the other hand, Kelly covers a distance of 1360 yards in 34 minutes, which means she covers an average distance of 1360 / 34 = 40 yards per minute.  So, based on these calculations, Kelly is faster than Blake since she covers more distance per minute than him.
Response:  Firstly, Raphael bought four pens that cost $1.5 each, so he spent $6 for those pens. Then, he bought two notebooks that cost $4 each, so he spent $8 for those notebooks. Finally, he bought one roll of paper that cost $20, so he spent $20 for that roll of paper. Therefore, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 on all the items he bought.
Response:  At first, there were 11 tadpoles in the water. Then, 6 of them emerged from the water and landed on a lily pad. After that, 2 more tadpoles came out from under a rock. So, the total number of tadpoles that Finn saw in the water today is: 11 + 6 = 17.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), there were 17 liters of water in the tank. On Tuesday (Martes), there were 7 more liters of water added to the tank. So, the total amount of water in the tank on Tuesday was 17 + 7 = 24 liters. On Wednesday (Miyerkules), half of the water in the tank remained, which is 24 / 2 = 12 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left in the tank on Wednesday was 12 liters.
Response:  Anakin caught 10 stars from the sea, 6 seagulls, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 more stars than Anakin, 3 more seagulls than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. So, in total, they caught:  Stars: 10 + 5 = 15 Seagulls: 6 + 3 = 9 Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5 Therefore, they caught a total of 15 stars, 9 seagulls, and 5 clownfish.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much the price of one liter of gasoline will be after 36 weeks with a 20% increase in price every two weeks. So, the formula for finding this would be:  Price after 36 weeks = Original price x (1 + 20%)^36 / 2 We can plug in the values given in the problem:  Price original = $20 Presyo after 2 weeks = $20 x (1 + 20%) = $24 Price after 36 weeks = $20 x (1 + 20%)^36 / 2 = $57.60 Therefore, the price of one liter of gasoline after 36 weeks will be approximately $57.60.
Response:  We have three action figures and one barbie doll. The price of each action figure is $5, so their total cost is $15. Now, we have to find out how many barbie dolls can be bought with that amount. To do this, we divide the total cost of the action figures ($15) by the price of each action figure ($5). This gives us 3 barbie dolls. Therefore, the total number of items that can be bought with $15 is 3 barbie dolls.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time Jackie spent working as a freelancer and got paid for it. If he worked for 3 hours and was paid $35 per hour, then he earned $105 from his freelance work ($35 x 3 hours). Next, we need to subtract the amount that Jackie owes to the accountant, which is $90. So, the total amount of money Jackie will receive from the accountant is $105 - $90 = $15. Therefore, Jackie will receive $15 from the accountant.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Elvira spent for the new computer itself. According to the question, the cost of the computer was €1090. Next, we need to add the cost of all the accessories she bought. The total cost of the accessories is €688 (€157 + €74 + €102). Therefore, the total amount Elvira spent for her new computer and accessories is €1090 + €688 = €1778.
Response:  If Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans for the school fundraiser and each flan requires 3 eggs, then she will need to make 15 x 3 = 45 flans. However, since she can only make one flan at a time, she will have to baby-sit her child 45 times.
"Response:  If Seth is twice as old as Brooke and their combined age will be 28 in 2 years, then we can write an equation based on this information:
Seth's age = 2 x Brooke's age + 2
Given that Brooke's age is currently 14, we can substitute this value into the equation to solve for Seth's age:
Seth's age = 2 x 14 + 2
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Seth's age = 30
Therefore, Seth is 30 years old."
Response:  If Jimmy has $2 that is double the amount of money Ethel has, then Jimmy must have $4 (since doubling means multiplying by 2). So, if Ethel has $8, then Jimmy has $4 + $8 = $12.
"Response:  If he walks 20 miles in one day and he walks 10 miles every weekend (Saturday and Sunday), then he walks a total of:

20 miles/day x 7 days/week = 140 miles/week

So, he walks a total of 140 miles per week."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are five uniforms in total. The cost of each jacket is three times the cost of the pants, so if the cost of one pant is x, then the cost of one jacket is 3x. Since each uniform consists of both pants and jacket, the total cost of each uniform is x + 3x = 4x. Therefore, the total cost of all five uniforms is 4x + (4x) = 8x. So, the answer to the question is 8x.
Response:  For the first group of 80 insects with an average of 8 legs per insect, we have:  Number of insects = 80 x 8 = 640 legs.  For the second group of 90 insects with an average of 6 legs per insect, we have: Number of insects = 90 x 6 = 540 legs.  And for the third group of 3 mutants with an average of 10 legs per mutant, we have: Number of mutants = 3 x 10 = 30 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs that Jake saw is: Total number of legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1230 legs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sally Two is three years older than Lola Red because she said so herself. So, Lola Red is two years younger than Sally Two. Then, we are told that Lola Red is twice as old as Sally Four. Therefore, if Sally Four is x years old, then Lola Red is 2x years old. Finally, we know that Sally Thirtytwo is eight times older than Sally Four, which means that Sally Thirtytwo is 8(x) years old. Putting it all together, we get:  x + 2x = 32  Solving for x, we find that the age of the four ibons is:  x = 16 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica spends each month for her debts and expenses: Debt repayment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000 per month Credit Card bill = $200 per month Total Monthly Expense = $1000 + $200 = $1200 per month Now, if she wants to pay more than the minimum payment of 50%, let's assume that she wants to pay 75% of her total monthly income towards her debts and expenses: Percentage of Income = 75% x Total Monthly Income = 75% x $1200 = $900 per month Therefore, the amount Jessica needs to pay each month to settle all her debts and expenses is: Total Amount Needed to Pay = Minimum Payment + Excess Payment = ($300 + $200) + ($900 - $300) = $800 per month
Response:  Billy needs to peel and cut 60 potatoes for his big barbecue party. Each potato takes almost equal time to peel and cut. It takes Billy almost 3 minutes (20 seconds x 15 potatoes) to peel one potato and almost 4 minutes (20 seconds x 20 potatoes) to cut one potato. Therefore, if he wants to finish preparing all 60 potatoes in the given time frame of almost 30 minutes (20 minutes x 3), he will need to work at a rate of approximately 17 potatoes per minute (60 / 3 = 20).
Response:  Firstly, we know that they sell lemonade for $3 per gallon and each glass of lemonade contains 20 lemons. So, the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade is $3 x 20 = $60.  Next, we know that they sell each glass of lemonade for $0.50, so they earn $0.50 x number of glasses sold = $0.50x. Finally, since they sell 20 glasses of lemonade per gallon, we can calculate their total revenue from selling lemonade as follows: $0.50x x 20 = $10. Therefore, if they make $25 in profit from selling lemonade, their total cost of producing lemonade is $60 + $10 = $70.
Response:  We know that there are 240 Karera and 80 Japanese in the group. The number of Chinese men in the group is 60, so we can deduce that the number of Chinese women is equal to the number of Japanese minus the number of Chinese men. Therefore, the number of Chinese women is:  Number of Chinese women = Number of Japanese - Number of Chinese men = 80 - 60 = 20. So, there are 20 Chinese women in the group.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Zaid spends for his daily expenses. According to the question, he spends 1/4 of his salary on food, which is $1500 per month. He also spends 1/3 of his income on gasoline for his car, which is $2000 per month. Therefore, his total monthly expenses are $3500. Next, we need to calculate how much money he has left after paying all his expenses. Based on the information provided in the question, he has $6000 per month left after paying all his expenses. Finally, we can calculate how many times he can afford to give away $200 to his favorite charity and still have enough money left for himself and his family. To do this, we divide the amount of money he has left ($6000) by the amount he gives away each time ($200). This means that he can afford to give away $30 times ($6000 / $200 = 30) before running out of money.
Response:  If Rani has more than 12 crabs and Monica has 4 times as many crabs as Rani, then Monica has 4 x 12 = 48 crabs. Since Bo also has 40 crabs, we can calculate the total number of crabs that include the three by adding their individual counts: Total = Rani + Monica + Bo = 12 + 48 + 40 = 100 crabs.
Response:  If Lloyd teaches math for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week, then he has taught a total of 5 + 8 = 13 hours of math in two weeks. So, his income from teaching math for those two weeks is $10 x 13 = $130.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many votes each candidate received. We know that there are two candidates and 80 students in the class who can vote. So, let's assume that each student can vote for one of the two candidates. Therefore, the total number of votes is 2 x 80 = 160 votes. Now, we want to find out how many votes each candidate got. If the first candidate got 3/4 of the total votes, then they got (160 / 4) = 40 votes. Similarly, if the second candidate got 1/4 of the total votes, then they got (160 / 4) = 40 votes as well. So, both candidates got an equal number of votes, which is 40 votes each.
Response:  If Sandra ordered 4 times more red roses than white carnations and she also ordered 200 Calla lilies which is 5 times more than the number of white carnations, then we can conclude that:  Red Roses = (Ordered quantity - White Carnations) / 4  = (Apat - 10) / 4 = 3 Red Roses per day White Carnations = Ordered quantity / 10 = Apat / 10 = 4 White Carnations per day Calla Lilies = Ordered quantity x 5 = 200 x 5 = 1000 Calla Lilies per day To fulfill the order of 5 stems of flowers per hour, we need to divide the total number of flowers by 5: Total Flowers = Number of Red Roses + Number of White Carnations + Number of Calla Lilies = 3 x 4 + 4 + 1000 = 1684 Now, let's round up the total number of flowers to the nearest whole number: Total Flowers = 1700 So, Fred needs to deliver 1700 flowers every hour to meet Sandra's orders.
Response:  If Jean is two years older than Mark, then Jean's age = Mark's age +2.  Since Mark has been alive for five more years than Jean, we can say that Mark's age = Jean's age +5.  Substituting Jean's age from the problem into this equation gives us:  Age of Jean = (Mark's age +5) - 2 = 30 + 5 - 2 = 37 years old. Therefore, Jean is 37 years old.
Response:  The first team runs for 55 seconds and has four members who each run 400 meters. Therefore, they ran a total of 1600 meters (4 x 400 = 1600).  Now, let's analyze the second team. Their first member takes 60 seconds to complete their 400 meters, which means that the next three members take 3 seconds less than him, or 57 seconds each. So, in total, they ran 1680 meters (4 x 400 = 1600 + 80 = 1680).  Since both teams ran the same distance, we can compare their times directly. The difference between their times is 20 seconds (1680 - 1600 = 80), so the faster team ran 20 seconds faster than the other team.
Response:  If Jerry rolled a six-sided die and got a result of 4, then there are four possible outcomes for his next roll: 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the probability of him rolling a number higher than 3 is 4/6 = 0.67 (or approximately 67%).
Response:  If Jenna has 5/8 of her mother's mangoes and her mother has 20 mangoes, then Jenna has 20 / (5/8) = 37.5 mangoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three groups of animals in total and each group has 10 rats. So, the number of rats altogether is 3 x 10 = 30 rats.  Next, we have 10 kuneho with 20 portions of food given to them, so the total number of portions of food for all kuneho is 20 x 10 = 200 portions. Now, let's calculate the number of hamsters. We know that there are 10 hamsters in one group and they get 5 portions of food each, so the total number of portions of food for all hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50 portions. Finally, we have 160 portions of food left over after giving out all the food to the animals, which means that each animal gets an average of 4 portions of food (160 / 4 = 40). Therefore, the number of dags in each group is 30 + 50 = 80 dags.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much interest will be added to the original amount of money owed (utang) over a period of three months. We can use the formula for calculating simple interest: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time Where: Principal is the initial amount borrowed ($100 in this case), Rate is the monthly interest rate as a decimal (2%/month or 0.02/month), and Time is the number of months the loan was outstanding (3 months). So, the total interest due after 3 months would be: Interest = $100 x 0.02 x 3 = $6 Total amount owed now = Original Amount + Accrued Interest = $100 + $6 = $106 Now, if Mandy agrees to pay the entire amount owed plus accrued interest at the end of the 3-month period, she needs to pay: Payment = Total Amount Owed x Monthly Installment = $106 x $33.33 (divided by 3 months) = $333.33 Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $333.33 at the end of the 3-month period to settle the debt.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much money the farmer will get for each sack of rice he sells to the merchant. Since it costs $2 per Supot to transport the rice from the farm to the store, and the merchant makes a profit of $10 per Supot ($30 - $2 = $10), then the farmer will receive $8 per Supot (i.e., $20 / $2 = $8).  Now, let's calculate the number of Supots that the merchant can buy with his budget of $400:  $400 / $8 = 50 Supots  So, the merchant can buy 50 Supots of rice from the farmer.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three friends who spent $20.25 in total for their tickets to the Christmas party. We also know that each friend paid less than $4.50 for food because they shared it among themselves. Finally, we learn that each of them had two different expenses worth $33 each. If these costs were split equally among all three friends, how much would each one have paid? To find out, let's use the following formula: Total Cost = (Number of Friends x Individual Cost) + (Total Food Cost / Number of Friends). In this case, the total cost would be: Total Cost = ($20.25 x 3) + ($4.50 / 3) = $61 + $1.50 = $62.50 So, each friend paid approximately $20.83 ($62.50 divided by 3).
Response:  If John collects peaches for 3 hours and gets 2 peaches per minute, then he has collected:  Number of minutes = 3 hours / 1 hour = 3 minutes Per minute = 2 peaches/minute x 3 minutes = 6 peaches Collected by John = 6 peaches
Response:  If there are 10 frogs and they need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, then they will need to eat 0.35 pounds of insects per day (3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.35 pounds/day). Since there are 10 frogs, each frog needs to eat 0.035 pounds of insects per day (0.35 pounds / 10 frogs = 0.035 pounds/frog/day).
Response:  At first, there are 50 punongs of kahoy and Tom harvests 10 every year. So after one year, he has 60 punongs (50 x 1.1). After two years, he has 70 punogs (60 x 1.1), and so on. Now, if 30% of the trees die after 10 years, then after 10 years, only 40 punogs will remain (70 x 0.7). Therefore, there are 40 punogs left when Tom finishes his 10-year period.
Response:  On Friday morning, 18 pink plastic flamingos were placed outside Sue's house. On Saturday morning, four of these flamingos were taken away and painted yellow. After this, 14 remaining flamingos were added to Sue's collection. So, after Sunday morning, there are more pink plastic flamingos outside than before (14 + 4 = 18). Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  If Violetta buys 5 different colors of krayons and each color costs $2, then she will spend a total of $10 for all 5 colors ($2 x 5 = $10). Now, if she spends $20 in total, that means she has $10 left over after buying the krayons ($20 - $10 = $10). So, the amount of money Violetta can get from selling her old krayons is $10.
Response:  The cost of one pen = $1.20 and the cost of one eraser = $0.30. To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we can multiply the cost of one pen by 8:  $1.20 x 8 = $9.60. Therefore, the total cost of 8 pens is $9.60.
Response:  We know that there are 200 libras of vegetables to be shared among 40 restaurants. Each restaurant will receive 2 libras of vegetables. So, the total number of libras of vegetables each restaurant will get is 2 x 40 = 80 libras. Now, we need to find out how many kilos of vegetables are left over after all the restaurants have received their share. To do this, we divide the total number of libras of vegetables by 10 (since 1 libra = 10 kilos). Therefore, the number of kilos of vegetables left over is 80 libras / 10 = 8 kilos. So, there are 8 kilos of vegetables left over that are not used by any of the restaurants.
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 people in Soda, including 8417 males and 9092 females. The youngest members of the population are children. How many children are there in Soda?
Response:  At first month, Elaine has 20 Pokémon cards. In the second month, she collects additional 15 cards, so now she has 35 cards in total (20 + 15 = 35). In the third month, she sells some of her old cards and earns $20, which she uses to buy new ones. She buys 10 new cards with that money, so now she has 45 cards in total (35 + 10 = 45). Therefore, the number of Pokémon cards that Elaine has today is 45.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark edits 1000 phrases per week for two different clients, Publishers A and B.  For Publisher A, he earns $0.05 per phrase, so his total weekly income from Publisher A is $50 (1000 phrases x $0.05 per phrase).  Similarly, for Publisher B, he earns $0.10 per phrase, so his total weekly income from Publisher B is $100 (1000 phrases x $0.10 per phrase).  Therefore, Mark's total weekly income is $150 ($50 + $100).
Response:  Since he takes 5 balde of water in the morning and 6 balde of water in the afternoon, we can write this as follows: Morning = 5balde x 5litro/balde = 25 liters Afternoon = 6balde x 5litro/balde = 30 liters Total daily water consumption = 25 + 30 = 55 liters So, every day, he consumes 55 liters of water.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money John earned in one month. Since he earns $ 2,000 every week and there are 4 weeks in a month, his monthly income would be:  $ 2,000 x 4 = $8,000. Now, let's calculate the amount of bonus he received for meeting the sales target. According to the question, if he met the target, he will receive a 5% increase in his salary, which means that his total income for the year including the bonus would be: $ 8,000 + ( $ 8,000 x 5%) = $96,000. Finally, since he receives the award on the first day of the year, the amount of money he received as an award would be: $ 96,000 / 365 days = $271.67 per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josie has a 10-acre land and each hectare can produce 5 tons of rice per year. So, in total, Josie's land can produce 50 tons of rice per year (10 acres x 5 tons/hectare).  Next, we are told that each ton of rice produces 2 barrels of oil. Therefore, the total number of barrels of oil produced by Josie's land per year is 100 barrels (50 tons x 2 barrels/ton).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carl eats one sandwich every day for lunch using two slices of cheese per sandwich. So he consumes 2 x 1 = 2 slices of cheese per day.  Secondly, we know that he also has an egg omelette for breakfast three times a week, which means he consumes 3 x 1 = 3 slices of cheese per week. Thirdly, we are given that he makes a large plate of pasta and cheese that can feed his big family for a whole week, which requires 8 slices of cheese. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese consumed by Carl in a week is 2 + 3 + 8 = 13 slices of cheese.
Response:  First, we know that Janet has 22 pieces of lapis and she bought 6 bags of asul with each bag containing 9 bolpen. So, the total number of bolpen from asul is 6 x 9 = 54. Next, we know that Janet also bought 2 bags of pulang bolpen with each bag containing 6 bolpen. Therefore, the total number of bolpen from pulang is 2 x 6 = 12. Now, let's add up all the bolpen Janet has now: 54 + 12 = 66. So, the answer is 66 bolpen.
Response:  If Brinley has already obtained marks of 89, 71, 92, and 100 in the first five subjects, then his total score is: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 = 452. To get a total score of 93, he needs to obtain a mark that is 43 more than his current total score, which is: 452 + 43 = 495. So, the mark he needs to obtain in the next subject is 495.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Michael rode his bike for 5 times a week and covered 25 kilometers each time. So in one week, he covered a total distance of 125 kilometers (5 x 25 = 125). Now, let's calculate how many kilometers he covered in three weeks. If he rode his bike twice a day, he would have covered a total distance of 480 kilometers (3 x 125 = 480) in three weeks. However, if he only rode his bike once every two days, he would have covered a total distance of 240 kilometers (2 x 125 = 240) in three weeks. Therefore, the correct answer is 240 kilometers.
Response:  We know that there are 25 pieces of chocolate and each piece weighs 40 g. So, the total weight of all the chocolates is: 25 x 40 = 1000 g. Now, we also know that for every piece of chocolate, there are 80 candied apples. So, the total number of candied apples is: 1000 / 80 = 12.5. Therefore, the weight of all the candied apples is: 12.5 x 80 = 1000 g.  Thus, the total weight of both the chocolates and candied apples is: 1000 + 1000 = 2000 g.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Rose bought 4 pieces of cake. On Tuesday (Martes), she went to another store and bought 3 more pieces of cake. On Wednesday (Miyerkules), she went back to the same store and bought 5 more pieces of cake. So, in total, Rose bought 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 pieces of cake after three days.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many plates are in each batch of plates being sold for $6000. Since there are 8 plates in one batch, we can say that there are x/8 plates in each batch where x is the total number of plates being sold. Now, since the price per plate is $750, the total cost of buying all the plates in one batch would be $6000 / 8 = $750 x (number of plates). To find out how much each plate costs, we divide the total cost by the number of plates in the batch: $750 x (number of plates) = $x per plate. So, if we buy 4 batches of plates, the total cost would be $750 x (4 x 8) = $3000 + $750 x (4) = $3750. Therefore, the cost of buying 4 batches of plates is $3750.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Sara earns from baby-sitting. Since she does it four times a week and each time she gets $5, her total earnings per week are:  $5 x 4 = $20. Now, let's find out how many weeks Sara has worked so far. If she saves $10 before buying the jacket and shoes, that means she has been working for at least $10 / $20 = 0.5 weeks. So, Sara needs to work for at least 0.5 weeks more to save enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. Therefore, the number of times Sara needs to baby-sit is: 0.5 + 4 = 4.5 times.
Response:  If Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens and he collects 42 eggs per day, then the number of white chickens he has is equal to half of the total number of chickens he has minus the number of red chickens. So, if there are x red chickens, then the number of white chickens is  half of (x + 2). Therefore, the number of white chickens Jerry has is 1/2(x+2) = 1/2x - 1/2. Now we can substitute the values given in the problem: x = 3 (red chickens), so 1/2x - 1/2 = 1/2(3 + 2) = 1/2(5) = 9. Therefore, Jerry has 9 white chickens.
Response:  If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour for 1 hour, then he has walked a distance of 3 miles x 1 hour = 3 miles. Since the park is 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide, if he walks along the length of the park, he will have covered half of it in one hour, which means he has covered a distance of half of 1.5 miles x 6 miles = 3 miles. Therefore, he has covered a total distance of 3 + 3 = 6 miles in one hour.
Response:  On day one (dollar store), Sloane had 100 customers who came to the store. In the future, he will have an additional 50 customers per day. If the average number of customers per day is 500, how many customers does Sloane have in total after three days?  Therefore, the answer is 3 x 50 = 150 customers.
Response:  Since there are two big pools and each has an equal amount of water flowing out at 4 gallons per minute, then in 4 minutes, both big pools will have lost half their water. Now, since the large pool has twice as much water as the small pool, if the small pool loses half its water, then the large pool will lose twice that amount or one whole poolful (80 gallons). So, now the large pool has only half as much water as it had before, which is 160 gallons less than the total amount of water it originally had. Therefore, the number of times more water is in the small pool now compared to when it started is 2 x 80 = 160 / 80 = 2.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money she needs for buying shoes and shipping fees. The total cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the shipping fee is $32.00, so the total amount needed is $352.00. Now, let's find out how many hours she needs to work before she can afford to buy the shoes. We know that her hourly wage is $8.00 per hour, and she works part-time, which means she doesn't work fixed number of hours every day. So, we need to calculate the number of hours she needs to work based on the amount she needs to save. To do this, we divide the total amount needed ($352.00) by her hourly wage ($8.00): Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage = $352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours Therefore, she needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Janeth borrowed from her friend. According to the question, she borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10% interest. So, the total amount that Janeth owes is: $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2200. Now, let's find out how much Janeth pays every month. The question states that she pays $165 per month for 12 months. Therefore, the total amount that Janeth pays over the course of one year is: $165 x 12 = $2040. To find out the balance remaining after 12 months, we subtract the amount paid from the original loan: $2200 - $2040 = $160. So, the balance remaining in Janeth's account after 12 months is $160.
Response:  There are 5 roses in the bowl (banga). If there were 7 dahlias instead of roses in the vase, how many flowers would be left in the bowl after subtracting the number of dahlias from the total number of flowers in the vase? Therefore, there will be 2 more flowers in the bowl than in the vase (5 - 7 = 2). So, the answer is 2.
Response:  Age of Adrian = 3 times older than Harriet = 3 x 21 = 63 years old Age of Zack = 50 years old Now, let's calculate the average age of the three: (Age of Adrian + Age of Zack) / 2 = (63 + 50) / 2 = 48 years old So, the average age of the three is 48 years old.
Response:  We know that there are four students in total - Naomi, Yuri, Brianna and Jojo.  Naomi got 68 points, Yuri got more than half of Naomi's score (which means he got at least 34 points), Brianna got 17 points more than Naomi, and Jojo got zero points. So we can write an equation based on this information as follows:  Naomi's score = 68  Yuri's score > 34  Brianna's score > 68  Jojo's score = 0 Now let's solve for Jojo's score. Since Jojo got zero points, his/her score must be equal to the difference between the total number of points and the scores of the other three students. Therefore, we can write another equation: Total points = Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score + Jojo's score Substituting the values we have obtained so far into this equation gives us: Total points = 251 + 34 + 17 + 0 = 292 Points Now we can see that Jojo scored 292 - 68 = 224 points. So the answer is 224.
Response:  According to the question, Carmen needs 10 minutes to solve one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve one Sudoku puzzle. At the end of the week, she solves 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles. Therefore, the total time spent by Carmen in solving these puzzles can be calculated as follows: Time taken for Crossword Puzzles = Number of Crossword Puzzles x Time per Puzzle Time taken for Sudoku Puzzles = Number of Sudoku Puzzles x Time per Puzzle Total Time Spent = Time taken for Crossword Puzzles + Time taken for Sudoku Puzzles Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of Crossword Puzzles = 3 Time per Puzzle = 10 minutes Number of Sudoku Puzzles = 8 Time per Puzzle = 5 minutes Total Time Spent = (3 x 10) + (8 x 5) = 45 + 40 = 85 minutes So, Carmen spends approximately 85 minutes playing these games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of water in the tank is 120 liters. Then, Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. This means that there are 30 liters of water left in the tank after she used it (120 - 90 = 30). Now, let's assume that two times of heavy rainfall occurred since Celine last checked the water level in the tank. So, the current water level in the tank would be 30 + (2 x 90) = 30 + 180 = 210 liters. Therefore, there are currently 210 liters of water in the tank.
Response:  If Andy has 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, then he has 50 petunias (since 90 - 40 = 50). So, the number of flowers Andy tends to is 50 + 90 = 140 flowers in total.
Response:  If the company spends $15,000 in advertising for one year and then divides it into four equal parts, each part represents $3,750. So, the total amount spent by the company on advertising over two years is $7,500 ($3,750 x 2 = $7,500).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much each person will pay for their respective boats. For Carlos, he paid $30 per hour for his canoe, so in 3 hours, he paid $90 ($30 x 3). Similarly, Benji paid $18 per hour for his balsa, so in 5 hours, he paid $90 ($18 x 5). Now, let's find out how much they both paid altogether. To do this, we simply add up all of their boat rental costs: $90 + $90 = $180. Therefore, the total amount that Carlos and Benji paid for their boat rentals was $180.
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half of those days are spent traveling, then how many days will it take to go back and forth between New Jersey and Rochester using a car?  We can assume that the journey is round-trip, so we need to calculate the total number of days required for both legs of the trip.  The distance from New Jersey to Rochester is approximately 300 miles (483 km), and driving nonstop would take around 6 hours. So, if you were to drive from New Jersey to Rochester and back again in one day, it would take 12 hours (including stops). However, since you mentioned that you will be taking breaks during your journey, let's assume that each leg of the trip will take around 8 hours (including stops) due to traffic, restrooms, meals, etc. Therefore, the total time required for both legs of the trip = 8 hours x 2 legs = 16 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the ratio of time taken for each leg of the trip = 16 hours / 24 hours = 0.67 days or 35% of a day. So, it will take approximately 35% of a day (or 0.67 days) to go back and forth between New Jersey and Rochester using a car.
Response:  We know that there are 40 cards of water and 8 of them will be removed, leaving us with 32 cards of water. Now, we have to randomly select one card from the remaining 32 cards of water. Since there are only integers in the set of possible values for this selection, the probability of selecting any particular card is equal to its proportion in the total number of cards of water. Therefore, the probability of selecting a card of water is 32/72 = 1/6. So, the probability that the selected card will be a water card is 1/6 or approximately 0.17.
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients that were added to the burrito:  * $2.00 for additional beef = $2.00 + $6.50 (original price) = $8.50  * $1.00 for additional cheese = $8.50 + $7.50 ( original price without cheese) = $16.00  * $1.00 for additional avocado = $16.00 + $9.50 (original price without avocado) = $25.50  * $0.25 for each of the two slices of tomato = $25.50 + ($0.25 x 2) = $25.75  Total cost of ingredients = $25.75 Next, we need to add the upgrade cost:  * $3.00 for additional chips and drink = $25.75 + $3.00 = $28.75 Finally, we subtract the gift card amount:  * $5.00 gift card = $28.75 - $5.00 = $23.75 So, the total amount owed by the customer is $23.75.
Response:  If Kalinda works for 4 pieces per minute and his mother adds half of the remaining pieces every minute, then we can write an equation as follows:  Where x represents the number of minutes worked by Kalinda. To find out how many hours they need to complete the puzzle, we can divide both sides of the equation by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):  Now let's solve for x:  Since Kalinda has been working for 20 minutes so far, he needs to work for another 180 minutes (or 3 hours) to complete the puzzle:  Therefore, the answer is 3 hours.
Response:  At first, there were 120 watermelons that bloomed and grew into 30% of them being ready to be harvested after two months (60 watermelons). So Ashlyn collected these 60 watermelons and brought them home. When she returned after another two weeks (14 days), 3/4 or 70% of the remaining 40 watermelons had ripened, so she picked those up as well. Therefore, there are 70 - 60 = 10 watermelons left that have not yet ripened after four weeks.
Response:  Firstly, he bought 12 cars for his company and each car was sold for $20,000. So, the total amount spent on buying the cars is:  $20,000 x 12 = $240,000. Secondly, he paid 10% tax on the cars which is equal to:  $240,000 x 10% = $24,000. Finally, he also paid $1000 as registration fee for each car, so the total amount spent on registering all the cars is:  $240,000 x 12 = $28,000. Therefore, the total amount that he spent on buying and registering all the cars is:  $240,000 + $24,000 + $28,000 = $306,000.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Kylie collected 5 shells and Robert collected 20 shells. So, the difference between their collections is 15 shells (20 - 5).  On Tuesday (Martes), Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, which means she collected 3 times as many shells as Robert. Therefore, Kylie collected 45 shells on Tuesday (3 x 15 = 45).
Response:  If there are 50 insects in the garden and they multiply every hour, then there will be 50 x 2 = 100 insects after two hours. After three hours, there will be 100 x 3 = 300 insects. And so on... So, if we continue this pattern, after 4 hours, there will be 300 x 4 = 1200 insects. Therefore, the total number of insects in the hardin after 4 hours is 1200.
Response:  Firstly, there are 36 penguins in total.  Secondly, 12 penguins jump into the sea and swim away. Thirdly, 8 penguins enter the cave to rest. Finally, 4 penguins go fishing for food. Therefore, there are 36 - (12 + 8) = 26 penguins left on land.
Response:  If Steve eats twice as many tomatoes as he can grow in his garden and he grows 10 cherry tomatoes per day, then he will eat 2 x 10 = 20 cherry tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve will eat 20 x 7 = 140 cherry tomatoes in a week. Now, let's find out how many cherry tomatoes one punong ubas (a unit of measurement for vegetables) can produce. According to the question, if one punong ubas can produce 3 cherry tomatoes per day, then we can calculate the number of punong ubas needed to produce the total number of cherry tomatoes that Steve wants to eat in a week as follows: Number of punong ubas = Total number of cherry tomatoes / Number of cherry tomatoes produced per punong ubas = 140 / 3 = 46.67 punong ubas Therefore, Steve needs approximately 47 punong ubas to produce the number of cherry tomatoes he wants to eat in a week.
Response:  Since there are 20 friends in total and each friend will get 4 slices of pizza, we need to divide 80 (the number of slices) by 4 to find out how many groups of 4 slices we can make. So, John needs to order 20 / 4 = 5 groups of pizza.
Response:  If he has 25 empty pens and each pen can make one full pen when filled with ink, then how many full pens will he have after filling all of them? So, the total number of full pens he will have = Number of empty pens x Factor of producing one full pen (i.e., 1). Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  Firstly, John gave his brother $20 as an allowance and added another $10 later. So, he invested a total of $30. After one year, if we assume that the money grows at a rate of 5% per annum, then the interest earned would be:  Interest = Principal x Rate x Time = $30 x 0.05 x 1 = $1.50 Now, let's calculate how many times $1.50 can buy after one year:  Value of $1.50 after one year = $1.50 / Price level = $1.50 / $1 = $1.50/1 = $1.50 Therefore, after one year, John will have $1.50 more than what he initially had, which means he has a total of $31.50 ($30 + $1.50).
"Response:  If Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jessa, then we can say that their ages are as follows:
Joan - 18 (born x + 2 = 18)
Mary - x (born x - 2 = 16)
Jessa - 20 (born x + 5 = 20)
Now, let's find out the value of ""x"". We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Joan is born two years before Mary. Therefore, we can write:
x - 2 = 16...(1)
We also know that Jessa is five years older than Mary, so Jessa is born five years after Mary. Therefore, we can write:
x + 5 = 20...(2)
Solving for ""x"", we get:
x = 14
So, Joan is 18 years old, Mary is 14 years old, and Jessa is 20 years old."
Response:  The total number of students in the classroom is 1000.  Of these, 30% or 300 students leave through exit A, 3/5 or 60 students leave through exit B, and all remaining 400 students leave through exit C. So, the total number of students who leave through exit C is 400 x 1 = 400. Therefore, the number of students who leave through exit C is 400.
Response:  We know that James has more than 6 kendis than Robert. So if James has x kendis, then Robert has less than or equal to 6 kendis.  Moreover, we are told that Juan has 54 kendis and John has twice as many kendis as Juan. Therefore, Juan has at least 27 kendis (since 2 \* 27 = 54). Now, let's compare the number of kendis owned by Juan with the number of kendis owned by Santiago:  Juan has 27 kendis while Santiago has 39 kendis. Hence, Juan has more kendis than Santiago.
Response:  Since both Dolly and Pandora have read all of Dolly's books and their own books as well, we can say that they have read a total of 3 books (their own plus Dolly's). So, the number of books they will read in the future is 3 + x, where x is the number of new books they will read. Therefore, the answer is 3 + x.
Response:  If there are 5 people and each person sends 2 letters per week for 7 weeks (or 49 letters in total), then the number of minutes it takes to write all those letters can be calculated as follows: Minutes = Number of letters x Time taken to write one letter / Total number of letters So, if we assume that writing one letter takes approximately 10 minutes (which might be an overestimation since you could probably write faster than that), then the calculation would look like this: Minutes = 49 letters x 10 minutes/letter / 5 people = 980 minutes Or, in hours, it would take him around 16 hours to write all those letters.
Response:  If Jason has 1,000 minutes per month and he spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, then he spends 15 x 24 = 360 minutes per month talking to his boss.  Now, if he spends 300 minutes per month talking to other people, that means he has 740 minutes left for the month (1,000 - 360). Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason has 740 / 30 = 24.67 minutes per day on average speaking with other people. So, the total number of minutes Jason speaks with other people in a 30-day month is 24.67 x 30 = 749 minutes. Therefore, the remaining time available for Jason to talk to other people in a 30-day month is 1,000 - 749 = 251 minutes.
Response: 1) Griffin had 24 French Fries initially. 2) Kyle took 5 of them. So, now Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 French Fries left. 3) Billy took twice as many French Fries as Kyle, so he took 2 x 5 = 10 French Fries from Griffin. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 French Fries left. 4) Ginger gave Griffin a full bag of potatoes, which contains 3 times as many French Fries as Kyle took. So, if Kyle took 5 French Fries, then Ginger gave Griffin 3 x 5 = 15 French Fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + 15 = 24 French Fries. Finally, Colby took 3 more French Fries from Griffin than Kyle took. So, Colby took 3 - 5 = -2 French Fries from Griffin. Therefore, the final number of French Fries that Ginger gave to Griffin is 24 + (-2) = 26 French Fries.
Response:  In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails and in the second aquarium, there are 32 snails. If we divide the number of snails in each aquarium equally among themselves, then the number of snails per aquarium would be equal to (4/1) = 4 and (32/2) = 16 respectively. So, there are 4 snails in the first aquarium and 16 snails in the second aquarium.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jean will be paid for each day of work. Since she works for 6 hours per day and gets paid $250 per hour, her daily earnings are:  $250 x 6 = $1,500 per day  Next, we need to calculate how many days Jean worked in total. Based on the information provided, Jean worked for 5 weeks (or 35 days) for a total of:  $1,500 x 35 = $52,500  Finally, since Jean received a 10% discount after completing the project, she earned:  $52,500 x 90 = $47,750  So, Jean was paid a total of $47,750 for her work as a makeup artist on the film.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Isabella spent for each of her three children based on their ages and interests. For example, she spent $12 on cake for her 8-year-old daughter, $43 on gifts for her 10-year-old son, and $15 on decorations for her 6-year-old daughter. Next, we need to add up all these amounts to get the total cost of the birthday party. This comes out to be $70 + $98 + $42 = $210. Finally, since there are six people in total attending the party (Isabella and her five guests), we divide the total cost by the number of attendees to find out how much each person contributed towards the party. In this case, $210 divided by 6 = $35 per person. So, each guest contributed $35 towards the party.
Response:  The number of bags of garlic = 4.  Each bag weighs 50 lbs or 23 kg. So, total weight of all bags = 4 x 23 kg = 92 kg. Now, each kilogram of garlic costs $1.50. Therefore, total cost of all garlic = Total weight of garlic x Cost per kilogram = 92 kg x $1.50/kg = $138.  So, the total amount spent by the chef for the garlic is $138.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Sue ate more than her sister who ate 4 times as many cookies. So if Sue ate x cookies, then her sister ate 4x cookies.  On Tuesday (Martes), Sue ate twice as many cookies as she did on Monday. So if Sue ate x cookies on Monday, then she ate 2x cookies on Tuesday.  The sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on the next day. If we assume that each cookie has 200 calories, then the total number of calories eaten by Sue is equal to the total number of calories eaten by her sister plus the difference between their daily intakes. Therefore, the answer is:  Calories consumed by Sue = Calories consumed by the sister + Difference in daily intake.  Now let's calculate the values:  Calories consumed by Sue = x + (4x) + 5 = 2x + 18  Since x = 4, so x + (4x) = 8  Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:  Calories consumed by Sue = 8 + 32 = 40  Therefore, the answer is 40.
