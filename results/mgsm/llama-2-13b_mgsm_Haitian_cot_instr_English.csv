"Response:  First, we know that Pato gave Janet 16 Ze (a type of Haitian currency) to buy food for her children and herself.  Secondly, we know that she spent $2 on vegetables at the market.  So, how much did she have left after buying the vegetables?  To find out, we need to subtract the amount she spent ($2) from the amount she had ($16).  Here's the calculation:  
$16 - $2 = $14  Therefore, Pato had $14 left after buying the vegetables."
Response:  We know that yarn is $2 per ball and there are 3 balls of yarn used in each project. So, if we make 4 projects, we will need 4 x 3 = 12 balls of yarn. Since each ball costs $2, then the total cost of yarn for all 4 projects would be 12 x $2 = $24.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of repairs as a percentage of the purchase price.  We know that the cost of repairs is $50,000 and the purchase price was $80,000. So, we can calculate the percentage of the repair costs as follows:  Percentage = ($50,000 / $80,000) x 100%  Percentage = 62.5%  Now, let's find out how much the seller will lose if they sell the house for $50,000. To do this, we subtract the sale price from the original purchase price:  Loss = $80,000 - $50,000  Loss = $30,000  Finally, we can calculate the loss as a percentage of the original purchase price:  Loss % = ($30,000 / $80,000) x 100%  Loss % = 37.5%
Response:  First, we know that James ran three sprints of 30 meters each. So he ran a total distance of 90 meters (3 x 30).  Next, we are told that he walked for 60 meters after his third sprint. Therefore, the total distance he covered is 90 + 60 = 150 meters.
Response:  First, we know that Wendi has 15 apples and gives 3 to each of her friends, so she has 15 - 3 x 3 = 15 - 9 = 6 apples left.  Next, we know that she wants to give at least 20 apples to her friend, so she needs to find out how many more apples she needs to buy. To do this, we subtract the number of apples she has from the number of apples she needs:  20 - 6 = 14.  So, Wendi needs to buy 14 more apples.
Response:  First, we know that Kylar wants to buy 16 linets and each one costs $5. That means he needs to pay $5 x 16 = $80 for all of them. But wait! He has a discount of 60%, so he will actually pay only 60% of $80, which is $48. So, Kylar should pay $48 for 16 linets.
"Response:  First, we know that Toulouse has 3 sheep and gives them to Charleston. So, Charleston now has 3 + 4 = 7 sheep. Next, we know that Charleston gives 4 sheep to Seattle. Therefore, Seattle now has 7 + 4 = 11 sheep. Finally, we are asked if Seattle has 20 sheep. We can see that Seattle does not have 20 sheep, it only has 11.  So, the answer is ""no""."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla has a maximum downloading speed of 2 GB per minute. Secondly, we are given that she downloaded 200 GB in total and it took her 40 minutes to do so. Therefore, we can calculate her average downloading speed as follows: Total amount of data downloaded = 200 GB Average downloading speed = Total amount of data downloaded / Time taken to download it = 200 GB / 40 minutes = 5 GB/minute Now, let's find out how long it would take for Carla to download the remaining 160 GB at an average speed of 5 GB/minute: Remaining amount of data to be downloaded = 160 GB Time taken to download it = Remaining amount of data to be downloaded / Average downloading speed = 160 GB / 5 GB/minute = 32 minutes So, Carla will take approximately 32 minutes to download the remaining 160 GB of data.
Response:  First, we know that John drives at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour (mph) for 4 hours. This means he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 60 mph x 4 hours Distance = 240 miles Next, we know that John reduces his speed to 30 mph and travels for another 2 hours. We can calculate the distance he covers during this period as follows: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 30 mph x 2 hours Distance = 60 miles So, in total, John covers a distance of: Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 Total distance = 240 miles + 60 miles Total distance = 300 miles Therefore, John covers a distance of 300 miles in 6 hours.
"Response:  First, we know that Eliza worked for 45 minutes instead of the agreed-upon 40 minutes. So, she worked for an additional 5 minutes (45 - 40 = 5).  Next, we need to calculate how much extra time she spent working at the higher rate of $10 per minute. To do this, we multiply the number of extra minutes she worked by the higher rate:  
$10 x 5 = $50  Therefore, Eliza earned an additional $50 for the extra 5 minutes she worked at the higher rate.  Now let's add up all her earnings:  
$10 x 40 = $400 + $50 = $450  So, Eliza earned a total of $450 for her 45 minutes of work."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 60 premium members who have downloaded files. Secondly, we know that each premium member has downloaded an average of 10 files. Thirdly, we know that 30% of the downloads were made by new members (i.e., those who joined within the last 30 days). Finally, we want to find out how many downloads were made by non-new members (i.e., those who joined before the last 30 days). To do this, we need to subtract the number of downloads made by new members from the total number of downloads. So, let's start by calculating the number of downloads made by new members: Number of downloads made by new members = Total number of downloads x Percentage of downloads made by new members New members downloaded 10 files on average, so the number of downloads made by new members is: Number of downloads made by new members = 60 x 30/100 = 18 Now, let's calculate the number of downloads made by non-new members: Number of downloads made by non-new members = Total number of downloads - Number of downloads made by new members Non-new members downloaded 10 files on average, so the number of downloads made by non-new members is: Number of downloads made by non-new members = 60 - 18 = 42 Therefore, the total number of downloads made by all members (both new and non-new) is: Total number of downloads = Number of downloads made by new members + Number of downloads made by non-new members = 18 + 42 = 60.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately. For the 3 dozen donuts, it costs $68 / 3 = $22 per dozen. For the 2 dozen mini gatos, it costs $80 / 2 = $40 per dozen. And for the 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, it costs $55 / 6 = $9.17 per dozen. Now let's add up all these costs: $22 + $40 + $9.17 = $61.17. So the total cost is approximately $61.17.
Response:  First, we know that Carlos has 7 big sitwon (pye) and each one costs $1,5. So he spent $1,5 x 7 = $10,5 for all of them. Then, he bought small sitwon (chak) at $3 per piece, so he paid $3 x 4 = $12 for those. In total, Carlos spent $10,5 + $12 = $22,5.
Response:  First, we know that Melanie has 5 aspirations in total.  Second, each aspiration requires either 2 or 3 things to be done (we can represent this as a binary decision).  Finally, for each thing she does, there is a probability of success (represented by a number between 0 and 1).  So, if we let x be the number of successful outcomes for each thing she does, then the overall probability of success for all five aspirations would be:  P(success) = (x^2 + x^3)^5  Now, we need to determine the value of x based on the given information.  We know that Melanie wants to achieve her aspirations with the least amount of effort possible, so we should choose the values of x that minimize the expected number of things she needs to do.  To find the minimum value of x, we can take the derivative of P(success) with respect to x and set it equal to zero:  d/dx [P(success)] = 0  Solving for x, we get:  x = 1/2  This means that Melanie should aim to succeed at half of the things she tries in order to maximize her chances of achieving all five aspirations with the least amount of effort.
Response:  We know that there are 20 students in total and 20% of them (4 students) are enrolled in contemporary dance.  We also know that 25% of those who are not enrolled in contemporary dance (8 students) are enrolled in jazz or hip-hop. Therefore, to find out how many students are enrolled in hip-hop, we can subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz from the total number of students.  Total number of students = 20  Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 4  Number of students not enrolled in contemporary dance = 20 - 4 = 16  Number of students enrolled in jazz = 25% of 16 = 4  Number of students enrolled in hip-hop = 16 - 4 = 12  So, there are 12 students enrolled in hip-hop.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each item based on their respective prices and interest rates.  For the jewelry purchase of $5,000, the interest rate is 2.5%, so the financing cost would be:  
Financing Cost for Jewelry = $5,000 x 2.5% = $125  
For the electronics purchase of $8,000, the interest rate is 1.2%, so the financing cost would be:  
Financing Cost for Electronics = $8,000 x 1.2% = $96  
Now, let's add both financing costs to get the total financing cost:  
Total Financing Cost = $125 + $96 = $221  
Next, we need to calculate the profit margin for each item. For the jewelry item, the profit margin is:  
Profit Margin for Jewelry = ($5,000 - $221) / $5,000 = 94.74%  
For the electronics item, the profit margin is:  
Profit Margin for Electronics = ($8,000 - $221) / $8,000 = 93.75%  
So, if the merchant wants to maximize profits, they should choose the jewelry item because it has a higher profit margin of 94.74%."
Response:  First, we know that the train travels at a speed of 80 km/h. Secondly, we are given that the distance traveled by the train is 150 miles, which is equal to 241.4 km (since there are 1.60934 km in a mile). Therefore, we can calculate the time taken by the train as follows: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 241.4 km / 80 km/h Time = 3 hours Now, let's convert this time into minutes: Time (minutes) = Time (hours) x 60 Minutes = 3 hours x 60 Minutes = 180 minutes So, the train takes 180 minutes or 3 hours to cover a distance of 241.4 km.
"Response:  First, we know that Jill spent $20 for a class on cheerleading and she received $30 for being an instructor.  Next, we know that she worked for 50 sessions as a professional and 35 sessions as an instructor. Finally, we want to find out how much money Jill made in total.  To do this, we need to calculate the amount of money Jill earned from each session and then add up all of her earnings.  Here are the calculations:  
For the professional sessions:  
$20 x 50 = $1000 (Jill earned $1000 for the 50 professional sessions)  
For the instructor sessions:  
$30 x 35 = $1050 (Jill earned $1050 for the 35 instructor sessions)  
Total earnings:  
$1000 + $1050 = $2050 (Jill made a total of $2050)"
Response:  First, we know that Claire has 3 eggs and she wants to make an omelette for 4 people. So, if each person will get one-fourth of the omelette, then Claire needs to divide 3 eggs into 4 equal parts. Can you do this math in your head? That's right! Each part is 1/4 of an egg, so Claire needs 4 x 1/4 = 1 egg for each person. Since there are 4 people, Claire needs 4 eggs in total.
Response:  First, we know that Marissa can run 12 kilometers in 4 hours or 2 miles in 1 hour. So if she wants to run 4 miles (which is twice as far as 2 miles), it will take her twice as long, or 2 x 1 hour = 2 hours. Therefore, Marissa will need to run for 2 hours to cover the additional distance of 4 miles.
Response:  First, we know that mwen has 10 liters of water in her bucket (bwè zoranj). She wants to add 15 liters of ananas (a type of fruit) to her bucket. So, she needs to add 15 - 10 = 5 liters more. Now, let's convert 5 liters to kilograms. We know that 1 liter is equal to 1 kilogram, so: 5 liters x 1 kilogram/liter = 5 kilograms. Therefore, mwen will have 10 + 5 = 15 kilograms of water and ananas in her bucket after adding the ananas.
Response:  If Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha and has a son who is 23 years old, that means Raymond is currently 29 years old (23 + 6).  Now, if Samantha gives birth to a child at age 31, her child will be born when she is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.  So, the child will be 25 years younger than Raymond.
Response: 1) Billy has 8 CDs. 2) He sells 3 CDs to Prem. 3) So he has 5 CDs left (8 - 3 = 5). 4) Then he sells 3 more CDs to Deny (5 - 3 = 2).  Therefore, Billy has no more CDs left after selling 3 CDs to Deny.  The final number of CDs Billy has is 2.
"Response:  We know that the candle burned for 2 hours and 30 minutes (2 x 60 + 30 = 480 minutes).  If we divide this time by the number of hours in the day (24), we get:  
480 min / 24 h = 20 min per hour  
So, if the candle burned for 2 hours and 30 minutes, it would have burned for 2 x 20 = 40 minutes in each hour."
Response:  First, we know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book.  Second, we know that there was a 25% discount on the original price of the book. So, if we subtract the amount Kyle paid from the original price, we can find out what the original price was. Here's the calculation: Original Price = $19.50 x (1 + 0.25) = $19.50 x 1.25 = $24.38 So, the original price of the book before the discount was $24.38.
"Response:  First, we know that Marie spent $12 on one item, so we can write an equation to represent this information:  
$12 = x + 5(x) + 4(x) + 1.5(x) where ""x"" represents the cost of each unit of the item. Now, let's simplify the equation:  
$12 = x + 5x + 4x + 1.5x Simplifying further:  
$12 = 6x + 1.5x $12 = 7.5x Solving for ""x"":  
x = $12 / 7.5 x = $1.60 So, the cost of each unit of the item is $1.60. Next, we know that Marie spent $3 on five items, so we can write another equation:  
$3 = 5(x) $3 = 5($1.60) $3 = $8 Simplifying:  
$3 = $8 Therefore, Marie paid $8 for the five items. Finally, we know that Marie spent $1.50 on four items, so we can write yet another equation:  
$1.50 = 4(x) $1.50 = 4($1.60) $1.50 = $6.40 Simplifying:  
$1.50 = $6.40 Therefore, Marie paid $6.40 for the four items. In total, Marie spent:  
$12 + $8 + $6.40 = $50 Solution:  The total amount Marie spent is $50."
Response:  First we need to calculate the total cost of each item:  For the three pairs of socks, it is $42 x 3 = $126.  For the three pairs of pants, it is $22.50 x 3 = $67.50.  And for the three pairs of shorts, it is $16.50 x 3 = $49.50.  Now let's add up all these costs:  $126 + $67.50 + $49.50 = $243. Total cost.
Response:  First, we know that Cynthia bought 15 positions of cream glass for $4.00 per position. This means she spent $4 x 15 = $60 on cream glass.  Next, we know that after 60 hours, Konbyen will give her a discount based on the number of hours she has worked. So, if Konbyen gives her a 10% discount, then she will get a discount of $60 x 10% = $6.  Therefore, the amount Konbyen will refund to Cynthia is $60 - $6 = $54.
Response:  First, we know that Henry has $60 million and he gives $20 million to his brother as a gift. So, he has $40 million left ($60 million - $20 million = $40 million). Then, he spends $15 million on something else, so he has $25 million left ($40 million - $15 million = $25 million). Therefore, the distance Henry travels is 25 miles (since he spent $15 million).
Response:  First, we know that the price of the shoe is $33 and it has been reduced to $20. So, if we subtract $33 from $20, we get $13 as the difference between the original price and the sale price. Now, if we divide this difference by two, we get $6.50 as the amount that will be refunded for each pair of shoes purchased. Therefore, if you bought four pairs of shoes at $20 each, your total cost would have been $80 (4 x $20). Subtracting $6.50 (the amount refunded per pair) from $80 gives us $13.50 as the total refund due to you ($80 - $6.50 = $13.50).
Response:  First, we know that Darrel ran for 7 minutes and 11 seconds.  If he ran for 7 minutes and 11 seconds, then he ran for 7 x 60 = 420 seconds.  Now, if he ran for 420 seconds, then he ran for 420 / 60 = 7 hours.  So, Darrel ran for 7 hours.  Next, we need to find out how many years have passed since Darrel ran for 7 hours.  We know that 1 hour is equal to 3650.5 days (taking into account leap years).  Therefore, 7 hours is equal to 7 x 3650.5 = 25553.5 days.  Now, let's convert this number of days to years.  There are 365 days in a year, so we can divide the number of days by 365 to get the number of years.  Therefore, 25553.5 days divided by 365 days per year is equal to:  25553.5 days / 365 days/year = approximately 71.8 years.  So, it has been approximately 71.8 years since Darrel ran for 7 hours.
Response:  First, we know that Gunther has 80 jelly beans in his bag.  Second, we know that he gave 20 jelly beans to his friend as a present.  Third, we know that the remaining jelly beans are 80 - 20 = 60.  Fourth, we know that 25% of the remaining jelly beans is (60 x 25%) = 15. So, Gunther has 15 jelly beans left after giving 20 to his friend.
"Response:  To calculate the cost of 10 chen ( $ 10) for one month, we need to know how much is 1 chen ($ 1).  If we divide 10 chen by 30 days (one month), we get: 

10 chen / 30 days = 0.33 chen per day

So, the daily cost of 1 chen is:

0.33 chen x 30 days = 9.9 chen

Therefore, the total cost of 10 chen for one month is:

9.9 chen + 10 chen = 19.9 chen

To find out how much is 1 chen in US dollars, we can use the exchange rate of 1 US dollar = 40 Haitian gourdes (goud). So:

1 chen = 40 goud

Now we can convert 19.9 chen to US dollars:

19.9 chen x 40 goud/chen = 796 goud

Therefore, the total cost of 10 chen for one month is approximately:

$ 796 (US dollars)"
"Response:  First, we know that Gretchen is 110 years old. Next, we are told that 30 years have passed since then. So, if we subtract 30 from 110, we get:  
Gretchen's current age = 110 - 30 = 80 years old."
Response:  First, we know that Aaron has 5 bijous and each bijou is passed to the next generation with a probability of 1/2 (i.e., 50%). So, the probability that Aaron passes no bijous to his children is 1/2, and the probability that he passes one bijou to his children is also 1/2.  Now, let's consider the possibility that Aaron passes one bijou to his children. If this happens, then Raymond will receive two bijous from his father (Aaron) since Raymond has two parents. Therefore, the probability that Raymond receives two bijous from his father is 1/2.  Next, we need to determine the number of bijous that Raymond will pass to his own children. Since Raymond has four parents, he can potentially receive four bijous in total (two from each parent). However, since each bijou is passed down with a probability of 1/2, the actual number of bijous that Raymond receives may be less than four. In fact, there are three possible outcomes for the number of bijous that Raymond receives:  either zero, one, or two bijous.  Now, let's calculate the probabilities of these three outcomes. The probability that Raymond receives zero bijous is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. The probability that he receives one bijou is (1/2)^2 \* 1/2 = 1/4. And the probability that he receives two bijous is (1/2)^2 \* 1/2 \* 1/2 = 1/8.  Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our knowledge about the probability that Siobhan inherits a bijou from her grandfather (Raymond):  P(Siobhan inherits bijou from Raymond | Raymond has n bijous) = P(Raymond has n bijous | Raymond has 2 bijous) \* P(Siobhan inherits bijou from Raymond) / P(Raymond has 2 bijous)  where n is the number of bijous that Raymond has.  Substituting the values we have obtained above, we get:  P(Siobhan inherits bijou from Raymond | Raymond has 2 bijous) = (1/8)
Response:  First, we know that in 20 minutes, he made 4 pounds of dough. This means that in one minute, he makes 4/20 = 1/5 pounds of dough. Now, we need to find out how much dough he will make in 40 minutes. So, we multiply 1/5 by 40: 1/5 x 40 = 8 pounds. Therefore, in 40 minutes, Mike will make 8 pounds of dough.
"Response:  First, we know that Terry bought 2 yogurts for $5.00, so each yogurt costs $5.00 / 2 = $2.50.  Now, if we multiply this amount by 30 (the number of days), we get:  
$2.50 x 30 = $75.00  So, Terry would have spent $75.00 on yogurts for 30 days."
Response:  First, we know that Jan planned to buy 8 Lego sets for $20 each, so she spent $20 x 8 = $160 in total.  Then, she received $5 back from the cashier, so she actually paid $160 - $5 = $155.  Therefore, the amount of money Jan has left is $155.
Response:  First, we know that John has $60 million and he spends $3 million per year. So, after one year, he will have $60 million - $3 million = $57 million left. Now, if he continues to spend $3 million per year for three years, he will have $57 million - ($3 million x 3) = $57 million - $9 million = $48 million left after three years. Therefore, the amount of money John will have left after three years is $48 million.
Response:  First, we know that if Dana walks at a pace of 3 miles per hour, she will cover 3 miles in one hour.  Now, let's find out how long it would take her to walk 10 miles.  We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.  In this case, Time = 10 miles / 3 miles/hour = 3 hours.  So, it would take Dana 3 hours to walk 10 miles.
Response:  If iPhone Ben gives his phone to iPhone Suzy and she has a child (Gen 1), then the child will be related to both iPhone Ben and iPhone Suzy as parents. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 pyets (pye) and hit the dragon.  Second, we know that the dragon is 1000 pyets away from Polly.  Third, we know that if Polly throws the javelin at the dragon, it will take 2 seconds to reach the dragon.  Fourth, we know that the dragon moves at a speed of 500 pyets per second.  Fifth, we know that the dragon can move 200 pyets in one second.  Sixth, we know that Polly wants to hit the dragon with the javelin.  Seventh, we know that the javelin has a range of 400 pyets.  Eighth, we know that the dragon is moving towards Polly.  Ninth, we know that Polly needs to time her throw so that the javelin hits the dragon when it is within range.  Tenth, we know that Polly needs to account for the dragon's movement when throwing the javelin.  Based on all these factors, we can calculate the exact moment when Polly should release the javelin to hit the dragon.  To do this, we need to use calculus and geometry to determine the trajectory of the javelin and the position of the dragon at the moment of impact.  Using the given information, we can set up equations and solve them numerically using numerical methods such as finite difference or finite element methods.  The solution to this problem involves complex calculations and geometric shapes, but ultimately, we can determine the exact moment when Polly should release the javelin to hit the dragon.
Response:  First, we know that Grandmother Jones made 5 pies for lunch and each pie took 8 mos to bake. So she spent 8 x 5 = 40 mos baking the pies. Then, after inviting everyone over, she had to serve them and eat with them, so she spent 14 mos serving and eating. In total, Grandmother Jones spent 40 + 14 = 54 mos preparing and enjoying her guests.
Response:  First, we know that one serving of snack chips (300g) contains 5 portions and each portion has 250 calories. So, if you consume all five portions, you will have consumed a total of 5 x 250 = 1250 calories from just those snack chips.  Now, let's look at your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories. If you consume 1250 calories from snack chips, that means you only have 750 calories left for other foods and activities throughout the day.  To determine how much more you can eat or drink to reach your daily goal, divide your remaining calories by the number of calories in each serving of the item you are considering consuming. In this case, since each serving of snack chips contains 250 calories, you can calculate how much more you can eat or drink as follows:  750 calories / 250 calories per serving = 3 servings  Therefore, based on the information provided, it appears that you can safely consume three additional servings of snack chips (or any other food or drink with approximately 250 calories per serving) to reach your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories without going over your budget.
Response:  First, we know that each candle costs $10.00 to make (including materials and equipment).  If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, he will need to sell at least 5 candles ($2.00 x 5 = $10.00) to break even.  However, if he sells 20 candles, he will have made a profit of $10.00 - $2.00 = $8.00.  Therefore, Charlie needs to sell at least 5 candles to break even, but he can sell up to 20 candles to make a profit.
Response:  First, we know that Meredith has written 4 articles for her blog so far.  Next, she wrote 5 more articles in London and 2/5 of those were published in Madison. Finally, she wrote some more articles in Madison, but we don't know how many yet. So let's start with what we do know:  4 + 5 = 9 (articles written in all locations) Now, we need to subtract the number of articles published in Madison from the total number of articles written in all locations. We can do this by dividing the number of articles published in Madison by 2/5:  2/5 x 9 = 3.6 (articles published in Madison) Now, we add the number of articles written in London to the number of articles published in Madison to get our final answer:  9 + 3.6 = 12.6 (total number of articles written by Meredith)
Response:  First, we know that Candice bought 80 notebooks at $2 each for a total of $160.  Next, she spent $23 on 23 Post-its, which means each Post-it cost $1. So, if she had purchased all 220 Post-its instead of just 23, she would have paid $220 (220 x $1). Therefore, the correct answer is $220.
Response:  First, we know that Jan bought 80% of the original price of the scarf, which is $80 \times 0.8 = $64$. Then, she paid an additional $20 for the belt, so the total amount she spent is $64 + $20 = $84$. Finally, if she had bought the scarf alone without the belt, it would have cost her $80 x 0.4 = $32$, so the difference between buying the scarf and the scarf with the belt is $84 - $32 = $52$. Therefore, the percentage discount that Jan received for buying the scarf with the belt is $\frac{52}{84} \times 100\% = 62.5\%$.
Response:  First, we know that Tracy has 4 bags of soil and each bag contains 6 pounds of soil. So she has a total of 4 x 6 = 24 pounds of soil. Now, if she wants to plant 3 tomato plants in each bag, then she will need 3 x 24 = 72 pounds of soil for all 3 bags. Therefore, Tracy needs 72 pounds of soil to plant her tomatoes.
Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in total (given).  Of those, 8 floors have been built so far (also given), and 3/4 of each floor has been constructed (also given). So we can calculate how much of each floor has not yet been constructed as follows:  For each floor, we know that 3/4 of it has been constructed, which means that 1/4 of each floor remains to be constructed. Since there are 8 floors in total, we can multiply 1/4 by 8 to get the total amount of construction remaining:  1/4 x 8 = 2 Therefore, 2 floors remain to be constructed out of the total of 15 floors.
Response:  First, we know that Lloyd has 252 feet of land and wants to sell it for $2 per foot. So, if he sells all his land, he will make $2 x 252 = $504. However, since he only wants to sell half of his land (i.e., 126 feet), he will make $2 x 126 = $252. Therefore, the amount Lloyd will receive is $252.
Response:  First, we know that Batotom can travel at a speed of 6 miles per hour (mph). Second, we know that he needs to cover a distance of 10 miles. Finally, we know that he will be navigating for 1 hour and 4 minutes (1 hour + 4 minutes = 104 minutes). So, let's calculate how far he will go in 104 minutes at a speed of 6 mph: Distance traveled = Speed x Time = 6 mph x 104 minutes = 624 miles Therefore, Batotom will travel 624 miles in 1 hour and 4 minutes at a speed of 6 mph.
"Response:  First, we know that if Sak has $15 left after buying two things, then he must have spent $15 + $x = $30 on those two things, where x is the cost of one thing.  Since each thing costs $1/2 or $1/4 of his remaining money, we can set up the following equation:  

$15 + $x = $30... (1)   

Now, let's substitute the value of x based on the information given in the problem:  

$15 + $1/2(remaining amount) = $30... (2)    

Since Sak has $15 left after buying two things, his remaining amount is $15 - $15 = $0. Therefore, we can substitute $0 for the remaining amount in equation (2):  

$15 + $1/2($0) = $30... (3)     

Simplifying equation (3), we get:  

$15 + $1/2($0) = $30... (4)     

Solving for x, we get:  

$15 + $1/2($0) = $30... (5)     

Therefore, the cost of one thing is $15 + $1/2($0) = $15 + $0 = $15. So, the total cost of both things is $15 + $15 = $30."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that for each car, the mechanic charges $60 American dollars and for each machine, he charges $40 American dollars. So, if the mechanic repairs 6 cars and 4 machines, his total earnings would be:  
6 x $60 = $360 + 4 x $40 = $160 = $520 (American Dollars)  Now, let's calculate how much money the mechanic makes per day. We know that on Friday, he repaired 12 machines, so his daily earnings would be:  
$520 x 12 = $6,240 (American Dollars)  Therefore, the mechanic makes $6,240 per day."
"Response:  We know that Patchy has 2 children and Trixie has 12. So if we add up their total number of children, we get:  
2 + 12 = 14  Therefore, the combined total of children for all the chatty family members in the Doubtfire household is 14."
Response:  First, we know that Jean has 30 lollipops and she eats 2 of them. So, now she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.  Next, we are asked to find out how many lollipops Jean will have if she takes 2 more from her remaining 28 lollipops. To do this, we need to subtract 2 from 28. So, 28 - 2 = 26. Therefore, Jean will have 26 lollipops left if she takes 2 more from her current amount.
"Response:  First, we know that the cost of a ticket is $7 and the cost of popcorn is also $7. So, if the student spends $7 on tickets and $7 on popcorn, they will have spent a total of $14. However, the problem states that the student has only $42 to spend. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
$14 = $42 - x  
Where x represents the amount left over after buying the ticket and popcorn. To solve for x, we can add $14 to both sides of the equation:  
$56 = $42 + x  
Subtracting $42 from both sides gives us:  
x = $14  
So, the amount left over after buying the ticket and popcorn is $14."
Response:  First, we know that the weight of the car is 15 pounds (chaje).  Next, we know that the total weight of the cargo and the car together must be less than or equal to 3755 pounds (ki kantite bwat maksimòm).  So, if we subtract 15 from 3755, we get:  3755 - 15 = 3740  Therefore, the maximum amount of cargo that can be carried in the car without exceeding the weight limit is 3740 pounds.
Response:  First, we know that Stephen sold the item for $40.00 and had to pay a commission of 25% on the total amount. So, the commission he paid is:   Commission = $40.00 x 25% = $10.00 Now, let's calculate the net amount Stephen received after deducting the commission from the total amount he received: Net Amount = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00 Next, we know that Stephen added a tip of $4.00. So, the final amount Stephen received is: Final Amount = Net Amount + Tip = $30.00 + $4.00 = $34.00 Therefore, the correct answer is Option C: $34.00.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 frozen raspberries in each pack and 67 packs in total. So we can calculate the total number of frozen raspberries as follows:  
Total = Number of packs x Number of raspberries per pack  
Total = 67 x 20  
Total = 1340 frozen raspberries."
"Response:  First, we know that 25 zoranj (gold coins) were spent in total.  Of those, 20% (20/100 = 2) were spent on the first item, and 20% (20/100 = 2) were spent on the second item.  That means there are 2 gold coins left over after buying both items.  So, the remaining amount of gold coins is:  
25 - 2 = 23 gold coins."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Janet spent in total for materials and construction of her house. We know that she paid $500 for materials and $800 for building and construction. So, the total amount she spent is: Total = $500 + $800 = $1300. Next, we need to calculate the percentage discount she received. We know that she received a 10% discount. To find out how much she saved, we can multiply the total amount she spent by the discount percentage: Discount = (Total x Percentage) / 100 Discount = ($1300 x 10%) / 100 Discount = $130 x 10% / 100 Discount = $13 x 10% / 100 Discount = $1.30 Finally, we subtract the discount from the total amount she spent to find out how much she paid after the discount: Amount Paid = Total - Discount Amount Paid = $1300 - $1.30 Amount Paid = $1298.70 Therefore, Janet paid $1298.70 for her new house after receiving a 10% discount.
Response:  First, we know that Si Marcy has been working for 40 years and earns an annual salary of $50,000.  After 20 years, she will have saved 5% of her salary each year, which is $50,000 x 5% = $2,500 per year.  Therefore, after 20 years, she will have saved a total of $2,500 x 20 = $50,000.  If she continues to work for another 10 years, she will save an additional $2,500 per year, for a total of $50,000 + $2,500 x 10 = $75,000.  So, if Si Marcy works for 30 years, she will have saved a total of $50,000 + $75,000 = $125,000.
"Response:  First, we know that the cost of the service is $140 per month.  If we want to calculate the initial amount that needs to be paid for the first month, we can multiply the cost by 12 months to get the total amount due for the first year:  
$140 x 12 = $1680  
So, the initial amount due for the first month is $1680.  Now, if we want to calculate the 10% discount for the first month, we can multiply the initial amount by 0.10 (which represents the 10% discount rate):  
$1680 x 0.10 = $168  
So, the discount for the first month is $168.  Therefore, the net amount due for the first month after applying the discount is:  
$1680 - $168 = $1512  
This means that the customer will need to pay $1512 for the first month's service, which includes the initial setup fee and the first month's subscription fee."
Response:  We know that Sophia has to travel 100 kilometers and she needs 4 gallons of gas for every 100 kilometers she travels. So, if she wants to travel 100 kilometers, she will need 4 x 100 = 400 gallons of gas in total. Now, we are given that the machine can hold 12 gallons of gas at once, so Sophia will have to make 400 / 12 = 33 trips to fill up her tank with enough gas to travel 100 kilometers.
"Response:  First, we know that Jim has 2 TV channels to choose from (channel A and channel B).  He decides to watch one of them for 3 hours (3 x 60 = 180 minutes).  Since each hour is divided into 45 minutes of lecture and 15 minutes of advertisement, we can calculate the total number of minutes of lectures as follows:  
180 min / 45 min per hour = 4 hours of lectures (4 x 45 = 180 minutes)  Therefore, Jim will watch 4 hours of lectures on Channel A."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 players in each team and we want to find out how many people will watch the basketball game in total.  To do this, we need to multiply the number of teams (2) by the number of players in each team (5):  
2 x 5 = 10  Therefore, in total, 10 people will watch the basketball game."
"Response:  First, we know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies in total.  We also know that each diamond is worth $100 and each ruby is worth $35. So, if we multiply the number of diamonds by their value, we get:  
$100 x 175 = $17,500 for diamonds.  
Similarly, if we multiply the number of rubies by their value, we get:  
$35 x 35 = $1,225 for rubies.  
Therefore, the total value of all the gems is:  
$17,500 + $1,225 = $18,725."
Response:  If Doctor Wertz has 60 years of age and 5 elements in his periodic table, then he has 60 - 5 = 55 years of experience as a doctor.
"Response:  First, we know that Bailey spent $5 for 8 servings of food. That means each serving cost $5/8 = $0.625 per serving.  Now, if Bailey had to pay $100 in total, and she spent $5 for 8 servings, then we can set up an equation:  
$100 - $5 = $100 / (8 x $0.625)  Solving for x (the number of servings), we get:  x = ($100 / $5) x ($0.625)  Simplifying, we get:  x = 20  So, Bailey ate 20 servings of food."
Response:  If Judy teaches 5 classes per week and has 8 classes on Saturdays, then she teaches a total of 5 + 8 = 13 classes per week.  If each class has 15 students and she charges $15 per student, then her weekly income is 13 x $15 = $195.  Therefore, if Judy works for one semester (which is approximately 16 weeks), her annual income would be $195 x 16 = $3,120.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many servings of food will be needed for 20 people based on an average serving size of 3/4 cup per person. This would be:  
20 x 3/4 cup = 15 cups of food. Next, we need to determine how much rice and peas are required for this amount of food. We know that each serving contains 1/2 cup of rice and 1/4 cup of peas. Therefore, the total amount of rice and peas needed is:  
Rice: 15 cups x 1/2 cup/serving = 7 1/2 cups  
Peas: 15 cups x 1/4 cup/serving = 3 3/4 cups."
Response:  First, we know that Tommy has 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake.  We also know that he wants to give away $3 worth of treats for every $4 spent. So if someone spends $4, Tommy will give them 3 treats (brownies or cheesecake) worth $3.  To find out how many treats Tommy will give away in total, we need to calculate the number of $4 blocks that can be formed with the given amount of money.  There are 43 brownies at $3 each, so the total cost of the brownies is:  43 x $3 = $129  And there are 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 each, so the total cost of the cheesecake is:  23 x $4 = $86  In total, Tommy has $129 + $86 = $215 to give away.  Now, let's count the number of $4 blocks that can be formed with $215:  215 / $4 = 53 blocks of $4 Each block contains either 3 brownies or 1 slice of cheesecake, so Tommy will give away:  53 x 3 = 159 brownies OR  53 x 1 = 53 slices of cheesecake  Therefore, Tommy will give away 159 brownies and 53 slices of cheesecake in total.
Response:  First, we know that Sheila wants to buy a phone for $150 and she has a discount of 2%. So, if she pays with cash, she will get a 2% discount. To find out how much she needs to pay, we can use the following formula: Amount = (Original Price x 100) / Discount Percentage. In this case, the original price is $150, and the discount percentage is 2%, so we can calculate the amount as follows: Amount = ($150 x 100) / 2% = $150 x 100 / 2 = $750. Therefore, Sheila needs to pay $750 to get the phone worth $150 with a 2% discount.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each plant costs in total.  For marigolds, it is $2.74 per pot x 12 pots = $33.08.  For petunias, it is $1.87 per pot x 9 pots = $16.83.  For begonias, it is $2.12 per pot x 17 pots = $35.54.  Now, let's add up all these amounts: $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.54 = $85.45.  Therefore, if Artie wants to buy all three types of plants, she will have to pay a total of $85.45.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four levels of difficulty in the game (easy, medium, hard and expert). Each level has its own set of challenges and obstacles to overcome.  Now, let's consider each level individually: Easy Level: At this level, there are only 4 types of castles to build (1-4). The player must collect 10 gems to unlock the next level. Medium Level: Here, there are 8 types of castles to build (5-12), and the player needs to collect 20 gems to progress to the next level. Hard Level: This is where things get more challenging! There are 16 types of castles to build (13-28), and the player must collect 30 gems to reach the expert level. Expert Level: Finally, at the expert level, there are 32 types of castles to build (29-63), and the player must collect 40 gems to complete the game. So, if the player wants to unlock all the castles and complete the game, they need to collect a total of 40 + 20 + 10 = 70 gems. Therefore, the answer is 70.
Response:  First, we know that Cecilia has $180 to spend on food for the first 180 days of her trip. That means she spends $180 / 180 = $1 per day on food.  Now, if she wants to buy 2 bags of rice (each bag costs $110), she will have spent $220 ($110 x 2) out of her initial budget of $180. This leaves her with $180 - $220 = -$40. Since she can't have negative money, she won't be able to buy both bags of rice. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 bag of rice.
"Response:  We know that Sara has $400 in her account and she gave $100 to Raymond.  So, Sara has $400 - $100 = $300 left in her account.  Now, we know that David also received some money from Sara, but we don't know how much.  Let's assume that David received $x amount of money from Sara.  So, we can set up the equation:  
Sara has $300 left in her account after giving $100 to Raymond + David has $x amount of money from Sara = $400 (total amount of money given to both Raymond and David)  Simplifying the equation:  
300 + x = 400  Solving for x:  
x = 100  Therefore, David received $100 from Sara."
"Response:  First, we know that the cost of one pack of 3 pens is $2.50 and the cost of one pack of 2 pens is $1. Next, we need to find out how many packs of pens Vincent can buy with his money if he wants to economize as much as possible. To do this, we will set up an equation based on the information given in the problem. We have:  

Pack of 3 pens = $2.50 (price) x 1 (quantity) = $2.50  
Pack of 2 pens = $1.00 (price) x 2 (quantity) = $2.00  
Total amount of money Vincent has = $3.00 (given)  
Now let's solve for the quantity of each item that Vincent can buy with his money:  
For the pack of 3 pens:  
$3.00 - $2.50 = $0.50 (remaining after buying pack of 3 pens)  
So, Vincent can buy 1 pack of 3 pens and have $0.50 left over. For the pack of 2 pens:  
$3.00 - $2.00 = $1.00 (remaining after buying pack of 2 pens)  
So, Vincent can buy 2 packs of 2 pens and still have $1.00 left over. Therefore, the maximum number of pens Vincent can buy with his money is:  
Maximum number of pens = 1 pack of 3 pens + 2 packs of 2 pens = 3 + 2 = 5 packs of pens  
In total, Vincent can buy 5 packs of pens with his $3.00."
Response:  First, we know that John paid $100 for the dog. Second, we know that the groomer gave him a discount of 30%. So, if we subtract the discount from the original price, we get: $100 - $30 = $70. Therefore, John paid $70 for the grooming service.
"Response:  First, we know that the total amount of water in the tank is 24 liters (L). Second, we know that 6 liters of water were removed from the tank. So, to find out how much water is left in the tank, we need to subtract 6 liters from 24 liters. Here's the calculation:  
24 L - 6 L =?  The result is:  
18 L or 18,000 milliliters (mL) of water are left in the tank after 6 liters have been removed."
Response:  First, we know that Charlie received 10 stickers from the store and then gave 21 stickers to Nan. So, Charlie has 10 - 21 = 9 stickers left. Then, Charlie used 9 stickers to decorate a small salon, so he has 9 - 28 = -19 stickers left. Therefore, Charlie has negative 19 stickers left.
"Response:  First, we know that Grace weighs 40 kg and Alex weighs 2 x 5 = 10 kg less than Grace. So, Alex weighs 40 - 10 = 30 kg. Now, if we combine their weights, we get:  
Grace + Alex = (40 + 30) kg = 70 kg."
Response:  First, we know that Dan has 3 pea pods and each pea pod contains 25 peas. So, in total, Dan has 3 x 25 = 75 peas. Next, we are told that each pea is worth 8 pickans. Therefore, the total value of all the peas is 75 x 8 = 600 pickans.
Response:  First, we know that the team played 22 matches and won 8 passes. So, they drew (22 - 8) = 14 matches.
"Response:  First, we know that the person has been working for 23 years and will retire at age 60 (34 years from now). So they have 23 + 34 = 57 years of work experience.  Next, we need to calculate how much money they will receive in their retirement fund each year. We are given that the monthly amount is $1,500 and there are 12 months in a year. Therefore, the annual amount is:  
$1,500 x 12 = $18,000 per year.  Now, let's calculate how much the person will receive in their retirement fund over the course of their 57-year career. We can multiply the annual amount by the number of years they will be working:  
$18,000 x 57 = $1,026,000.  So, the person will receive approximately $1,026,000 in their retirement fund over the course of their 57-year career."
Response:  First, we know that Greg has $20 and he spends $10 to buy a ticket for the concert. So, he has $20 - $10 = $10 left.  Next, we know that the price of each song is $5, so if he buys two songs, he will spend $5 + $5 = $10. Therefore, after buying two songs, he will have $10 - $10 = $0 left.  Finally, we know that he also spent $10 to buy a drink, so in total, he spent $10 + $10 + $10 = $30.  Therefore, the total amount Greg spent at the concert is $30.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sylvie has $600 in her savings account and she wants to withdraw $500 of it. So, if she withdraws $500, how much will be left in her account after deducting the withdrawn amount from her initial balance?  To find out, we can subtract $500 from $600:  
$600 - $500 =?  The result is:  $100  Therefore, if Sylvie withdraws $500 from her savings account, there will be $100 left in her account after deducting the withdrawn amount."
Response:  If Premiere Album Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than Harald, and you sold 88,000 copies of your album, then we can calculate how many copies Harald would have sold based on that ratio.  So if Premiere Album Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than Harald, that means Harald sold 1/10th as many copies as Premiere Album Marilyn.  And since you sold 88,000 copies of your album, that means Harald would have sold 8,800 copies (since 88,000 x 1/10 = 8,800).
Response:  First, we know that Christina has 75 students in her class and she wants to invite 16 of them to her party. So, if we divide 75 by 16, we get... (75 ÷ 16) = 4 with a remainder of 9. This means that Christina can invite 4 complete groups of 16 students each, plus 9 additional students. Therefore, the total number of students Christina can invite is 4 x 16 = 64 + 9 = 73 students.
Response:  First, we know that Ted has 20 dinosaurs and each dinosaur eats 10 pounds of salad. So, in total, all 20 dinosaurs will eat 20 x 10 = 200 pounds of salad. Now, let's consider how much food Timmy needs to bring for himself and his friends. We are told that Timmy can eat as much as an adult dinosaur, so he needs to bring enough food for 5 adult dinosaurs. Since there are only 200 pounds of salad available, it means that Timmy and his friends will have to share the remaining 200 - 100 = 100 pounds of salad among themselves. Therefore, Timmy should bring at least 100 / 5 = 20 pounds of additional food for himself and his friends.
Response:  If Jan has two cats and each cat has three kittens, then Jan has a total of six kittens (2 x 3 = 6).  Now, if Marcia has four cats and each cat has five kittens, then Marcia has a total of twenty kittens (4 x 5 = 20).  So, the total number of kittens is twenty-six (6 + 20 = 26).
Response:  First, we know that Amy has 3 children (Jackson, Corey, and James).  Second, we know that Jackson is 2 years older than Corey.  Third, we know that James is 10 years younger than Corey.  So, let's start with Corey's age:  Corey is 2 + 10 = 12 years old.  Now, we can find out how old Jackson and James are:  Jackson is 2 years older than Corey, so he is 12 + 2 = 14 years old.  James is 10 years younger than Corey, so he is 12 - 10 = 2 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lee can cover 400 meters in 38 seconds. Secondly, we are given that Gerald has a 10% slower pace than Lee. So, if Lee takes 38 seconds to cover 400 meters, then Gerald will take (38 x 1.10) = 41.8 seconds to cover the same distance. Therefore, Gerald will cover 400 meters in 41.8 seconds.
Response:  We know that if we have 12 cats and each cat can eat 60 grams of food per day, then together they will need 720 grams of food (12 x 60).  But what if some of the cats don't eat their full ration?  If only 8 cats eat their full ration, then the total amount of food needed would be 480 grams (8 x 60).  So, the remaining 4 cats would need to share the remaining 240 grams of food (720 - 480 = 240).  Therefore, the average amount of food needed per cat is 60 grams + 240 grams / 4 cats = 30 grams per cat.
Response:  First, we know that there are 2/5 of the class who have gone to Scotland (2/5 x 200 = 40). Now, we need to find out how many students from this group have not returned yet. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who have returned from the total number of students who went to Scotland:  40 - 20 = 20. So, 20 students from the group of 40 have not returned yet.
Response: 1) Harry has 9 cookies and gives 2/3 of them to James. 2) How many cookies does Harry have left after giving some to James? To find out, we need to multiply 9 by 2/3.  Multiplying 9 by 2/3 gives us... (9 x 2)/3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 cookies left after giving 2/3 of them to James.
"Response:  We know that Freda has 16 ounces of tomato sauce and she needs to make 32 ounces for the package. So we can start by multiplying 16 by 2 to get 32. That gives us:  
32 = 2 x 16  
Now we have our answer! Freda will need 2 times 16 or 32 ounces of tomato sauce to fill her package."
Response:  First, we know that there are 30 machines in total and they all pass through the bottleneck in 15 minutes. This means each machine spends 15/30 = 5 minutes at the bottleneck. Now, if we have 20 more machines added to the system, we can calculate how much time each of these additional machines will spend at the bottleneck as follows: Total time spent at the bottleneck = (Number of additional machines x Time per machine) + (Original number of machines x Time per machine) Time per machine = 5 minutes Since there are now 20 more machines, the total number of machines is: 30 + 20 = 50 machines The total time spent at the bottleneck for all 50 machines would be: Total time spent at the bottleneck = (20 x 5) + (30 x 5) = 100 + 150 = 250 minutes or 4 hours and 10 minutes. Therefore, if you add 20 more machines to the system, it will take an additional 4 hours and 10 minutes for all 50 machines to pass through the bottleneck.
Response:  First, we know that Marie has 18 plants in total and she already has 2 plants in pots. So, if she wants to place 1 more plant in a pot, she will have 18 - 2 = 16 plants left. Now, let's see how many plants she can put in each pot. We are given that she has 40 feet of space and each plant needs 4 feet of space. Therefore, she can place 40/4 = 10 plants in each pot. Since she wants to place only one plant in a pot, we can conclude that there is one plant left over, which is Plant M. Therefore, the plant that Marie should keep in the pot is Plant M.
Response:  First, we know that Premiere Zanmi (the first friend) can do 20 times as much work as Jerome in one day. So if Jerome takes 4 days to finish a task, Premiere Zanmi would take 20 x 4 = 80 days to finish the same task.  Next, we know that Dixieme Zanmi (the tenth friend) can do 10 times as much work as Jerome in one day. So if Jerome takes 60 days to finish a task, Dixieme Zanmi would take 10 x 60 = 600 days to finish the same task.  Finally, we know that Katiyèm Zanmi (the twentieth friend) can do 5 times as much work as Jerome in one day. So if Jerome takes 60 days to finish a task, Katiyèm Zanmi would take 5 x 60 = 300 days to finish the same task.  Therefore, if all three friends work together, it would take them 80 + 600 + 300 = 980 days to finish the task.
Response:  Firstly, we know that solo has 4 pages of literature review (li 4 paj), and 20 pages of social sciences (li 20 paj). Then, we have 7 pages of introduction (li 7 paj) and 8 pages of geography (li 8 paj). In total, solo has 15 pages (li 15 paj). So, if solo wants to finish all the lectures in one day, he/she needs to spend approximately 15 hours studying (konbyen paj li bezwen li, an mwayèn, nan yon sèl jou).
Response:  First, we know that John has $100 and he spends $30 on food and drinks. So, he has $70 left. Then, he gives $20 to his friend as a loan, so now he has $50 left. Finally, he buys a cell phone for $40, so he is left with $10. Therefore, the amount of money John has after buying the cell phone is $10.
Response:  First, we know that the village has 3 miles of land and it takes 10 minutes to walk one mile. So, if we want to cover all 3 miles, it will take 3 x 10 = 30 minutes. Now, we are asked how long it would take to walk around the entire village if it is 42 miles long and we have to walk along the riverbank. To do this, we need to add the time it takes to walk one mile to the total distance of the village. In other words, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed, where Speed is the rate at which we travel (in this case, our walking speed). We know that the distance of the village is 42 miles, so we can calculate the time as follows: Time = 42 miles / 10 minutes/mile = 420 minutes or approximately 7 hours. Therefore, it would take us approximately 7 hours to walk around the entire village if we have to follow the riverbank.
"Response:  First, we know that Poppy has $1000 to invest in mosquitoes.  Second, she wants to buy enough mosquitoes so that when they multiply, she will have at least $1000 more.  Third, each mosquito costs $1.  So, if Poppy buys x mosquitoes, she will spend $x dollars.  Fourth, since she wants to have at least $1000 more after the mosquitoes multiply, we can set up the equation:  

$1000 + ($1 x x) = $1000(1+x)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  

$1000 + $x = $1000(1+x)  Solving for x, we get:  

$1000 + $x = $1000(1+x)  $x = $1000(1+x) - $1000  $x = $1000(2) - $1000  $x = $2000 - $1000  $x = $1000  Therefore, Poppy needs to buy 1000 mosquitoes to have at least $1000 more after they multiply."
Response:  First, we know that Cody has 2 bags of chips and each bag contains 5 biscuits. So, in total, Cody has 2 x 5 = 10 biscuits. Now, if Amir wants 5 biscuits, then Cody will have 10 - 5 = 5 biscuits left after giving them to Amir.
Response:  We have three watermelons (John) and each watermelon has five or six pounds of fruit (pous). So we have a total of 3 x 5 = 15 or 3 x 6 = 18 pounds of fruit. But one of the watermelons (mi yo) only has one pound of fruit. Therefore, the total weight of all three watermelons is 15 + 1 = 16 or 18 - 1 = 17 pounds.
Response:  We know that Frankie watched 7 episodes of television in total. She watched 3 episodes on Monday (3 x 30 minutes = 90 minutes), 2 episodes on Tuesday (2 x 30 minutes = 60 minutes), and 2 episodes on Wednesday (2 x 30 minutes = 60 minutes). On Thursday, she watched one episode (30 minutes) and on Friday, she watched no episodes (0 minutes). Therefore, the total amount of time Frankie spent watching television on Monday is 90 minutes + 60 minutes + 60 minutes = 210 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that Henry wants to make 15 more pastries than he already has (15 + 5 = 20). So, in total, he will have 20 pastries. Now, let's calculate how many of each type of pastry he will have. Since he started with 5 pastries and added 15 more, he will have 5 + 15 = 20 pastries. Therefore, the number of chocolate pastries Henry will have is 5, and the number of vanilla pastries he will have is 20 - 5 = 15.
Response:  First, we know that the local gas station charges $3.00 per gallon for regular gasoline.  Second, we know that the Konpayi app offers $0.20 cashback per gallon if you pay with the app. Third, we are asked to find out how much money the customer will save if they buy 10 gallons of gas using the Konpayi app.  To do this, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 10 gallons of gas at the local gas station and then subtract the amount saved through the Konpayi app.  Here's the calculation:  Total Cost = 10 x $3.00 = $30.00 Cashback Amount = 10 x $0.20 = $2.00 Savings = Total Cost - Cashback Amount = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00 So, the customer will save $28.00 by buying 10 gallons of gas using the Konpayi app instead of paying directly at the local gas station.
"Response:  First, we know that Marcel has 24 hours of work and Beatrice has 14 hours of work.  So together they have 24 + 14 = 38 hours of work.  Now, if each hour of work is worth $10, then their total earnings for the day would be:  
$10 x 38 hours = $380.  Therefore, if you want to give them all the money they earned, you should give them $380."
Response:  First, we know that Julia has $10 and she spends $2 on a snack. So, she has $8 left.  Next, we know that she spends $4 on a toy, so she has $4 left.  Then, we know that she spends $6 on a book, so she has $2 left.  Finally, we know that she has $2 left and she buys a pen for $1, so she has $1 left.  Therefore, the amount of money Julia has after all her purchases is $1.
"Response:  We have four professionals (P1, P2, P3, and P4) who will serve customers using a whiteboard (W). Each professional has two lessons (L1 and L2) to teach the customer. If we use the whiteboard for three hours (H), how many times can each professional teach their lessons?  Here's the calculation:  
P1: 2 lessons x 3 hours = 6 teaching sessions  
P2: 2 lessons x 3 hours = 6 teaching sessions  
P3: 2 lessons x 3 hours = 6 teaching sessions  
P4: 2 lessons x 3 hours = 6 teaching sessions  
Total: 24 teaching sessions"
"Response:  If Ryan planted 2 feet of chalk in Jaden's backyard and after 15 days, only 5 pounds of chalk were left, we can calculate how much chalk was used or lost over time.  First, let's convert all measurements to metric units for easier calculations.  There are 0.3048 meters in one foot, so:  

2 feet x 0.3048 meters/foot = 0.6096 meters (chalk length)  

And there are 1000 grams in one kilogram, so:  

5 pounds x 453.592 grams/pound = 2267.96 grams (chalk weight)  

Now, let's find out how much chalk was used or lost over time. We know that 2267.96 - 5000 grams =??? grams were used or lost. Solve for the missing amount.  

Answer: 2267.96 - 5000 grams = 2732.04 grams"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jamal has 1800 photos and each photo is worth $50. So, the total value of all his photos is:  
1800 x $50 = $90,000  Now, let's consider the situation where Brittany wants to buy all of Jamal's photos. If she buys all 1800 photos, she will have to pay Jamal a total of:  
$90,000  However, if Brittany only buys 50 photos from Jamal, she will have to pay him a total of:  
50 x $50 = $2500  Therefore, the amount of money that Brittany will save by buying only 50 photos instead of all 1800 photos is:  
$90,000 - $2500 = $87,500"
Response:  First, we know that Sasha spent $10 for the first table (2x4x10).  Secondly, she spent $16 for the second table (4x4x10). In total, Sasha spent $26.
Response:  First, we know that Katy has $7.13 in her savings account.  Next, she wants to buy a bike that costs $120.  So, if she uses all of her savings to buy the bike, how much will she have left over?  To find out, we can subtract the cost of the bike from her savings:  $7.13 - $120 =?  Can you solve for the amount left over?
Response:  First, we know that Jean has 2 pieces of meat and wants to buy 3 more pieces. So he needs 3 - 2 = 1 piece of meat. Since each piece costs $60, then Jean will pay $60 x 1 = $60 for one piece of meat. Therefore, the total amount Jean pays is $60 + $60 = $120.
Response:  First, we know that each machine can produce 30 units per day.  We also know that there are 2 machines in total.  So, together they can produce 60 units per day (2 x 30).  Now, we need to find out how many days it would take for the company to clear its inventory of 150 units if it produces at this rate.  To do this, we divide the number of units to be cleared (150) by the daily production rate (60):  150 / 60 = 2.5 days  Therefore, it would take the company approximately 2.5 days to clear its inventory of 150 units if it produces at a rate of 60 units per day with two machines.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adrien owes Lylah $30,000 and he has paid her 40% of it, which is $12,000 (40% of $30,000). So, the remaining amount that Adrien still owes to Lylah is $30,000 - $12,000 = $18,000.  Now, if Adrien touches Lylah for $40,000, then he will have paid her the full amount that she was owed ($18,000) plus some extra ($40,000 - $18,000 = $22,000). Therefore, the total amount that Adrien will pay to Lylah is $18,000 + $22,000 = $40,000.
Response:  If we have three papayas and each papaya has an average of 30 seeds, then we will have a total of 90 seeds (3 x 30). Now, if we want to plant these seeds in a new place, we need to choose a suitable location for them to grow well. We can use the following steps to determine how many seedlings will be produced from one papaya: Step 1: Calculate the number of seeds per papaya. In this case, there are 30 seeds per papaya. Step 2: Calculate the total number of seeds available. Since we have three papayas, we multiply the number of seeds per papaya by the number of papayas: 30 x 3 = 90 seeds. Step 3: Determine the percentage of seeds that will germinate and grow into healthy seedlings. This percentage varies depending on factors such as soil quality, watering, sunlight, etc., but let's assume that 75% of the seeds will germinate and grow into healthy seedlings. Therefore, we can calculate the number of seedlings as follows: 90 x 0.75 = 67.5 seedlings. So, from one papaya, we can expect approximately 68 seedlings to grow if we follow proper cultivation techniques.
Response:  First, we know that Morisette has 5 pomegranates and 8 oranges.  Next, we are told that Kael gives her 2 pomegranates and 4 oranges.  So, in total, Morisette now has 5 + 2 = 7 pomegranates and 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.  Therefore, the total number of fruits Morisette has is 7 + 12 = 19.
Response:  First, we know that Sadie has 8 eggs and she gives you 2 eggs. That means she has 8 - 2 = 6 eggs left. Now, if she gives you another egg, she will have 6 - 1 = 5 eggs left. So, in total, Sadie has given you 2 + 1 = 3 eggs.
Response:  First, we know that Rosie walked 10 miles in 3 hours. That means she walked at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Next, we know that she walked 5 miles in 2 hours. So, her rate for those 2 hours was also 3 miles per hour (since she maintained the same pace). Finally, we are asked how far she would have walked in 7 hours if she had continued walking at the same rate as before. To find this out, we can multiply her previous rate (3 miles/hour) by the number of hours she spent walking (7 hours): Total distance = 3 miles/hour x 7 hours = 21 miles. Therefore, Rosie would have walked 21 miles in 7 hours if she had kept up the same pace.
Response:  First, we know that Jennie has $60 left after buying something.  Second, she spent $30 on another item, so now she has $60 - $30 = $30 left.  Finally, if she spends $10 more, she will have $30 - $10 = $20 left.  So, the amount of money Jennie will have left after buying everything is $20.
Response:  First, Julia has 5 new packages of plastic wrap (pakes) to use for wrapping her bouquets. Each package contains 12 rolls of plastic wrap. So, in total, Julia has 5 x 12 = 60 rolls of plastic wrap.
Response:  First, we know that Dylan has 38 chickens and 6 ducks. Next, we need to find out how many pens of chickens and ducks he has. Since there are 6 ducks and each duck needs one pen, Dylan has 6 pens of ducks. Now, let's count the number of pens of chickens. There are 38 chickens and since each chicken needs one pen, Dylan has 38 pens of chickens. In total, Dylan has 6 + 38 = 44 pens.
Response:  If Amy has 20 friends and each friend gives her $1, then she will have $20 in total.  Now, if Lily also has 50 friends and each friend gives her $1, then she will have $50 in total.  So, together they will have $70 ($20 + $50).
Response:  First, we know that one melon costs $5 and one piman (pound) of sugar costs $20. So if Dillon buys four melons, he will pay $5 x 4 = $20 for the melons.  Next, we know that one zoranj (dozen) of eggs costs $10. If Dillon buys two dozen eggs, he will pay $10 x 2 = $20 for the eggs.  Finally, we need to add up all these amounts to find out how much Dillon spends in total. Therefore, the total amount Dillon spends is $20 + $20 + $20 = $60.  So the answer is $60.
Response:  First, we know that the doctor charges $150 for an office visit and $200 for an emergency room visit.  We also know that the patient has insurance that covers 50% of these costs.  So, if the patient visits the doctor's office, they will have to pay $75 (50% of $150) out of pocket.  If they go to the emergency room, they will have to pay $100 (50% of $200).  Therefore, it is more cost-effective for the patient to visit the doctor's office rather than going to the emergency room.
Response:  We know that there are 60 travelers in total and each elf can make 10 toys per day. So, if we multiply 60 by 10, we get 600 toys per day. Now, let's calculate how many toys each elf can make in one week (7 days). If we multiply 600 by 7, we get 4200 toys per week. Finally, let's calculate how many toys each elf can make in one year (52 weeks). If we multiply 4200 by 52, we get 218,400 toys per year. Therefore, each elf can make approximately 218,400 toys per year.
"Response:  First, we know that Depans gave Joseph $500. Next, we know that Jen took $60 from the money that Depans had given to Joseph. So, if Jen took $60 from the $500 that Depans gave to Joseph, then we can calculate how much money is left over as follows:  
$500 - $60 = $440  
Therefore, the amount of money left over after Jen took $60 from the $500 that Depans gave to Joseph is $440."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pam has $2 worth of coins and she wants to buy something that costs $4. So, she needs to find a way to make up for the remaining amount of $2.  Secondly, we are given that Fred has $2 worth of coins as well, but he only has 4 coins of $1 each. Therefore, he cannot pay for the full amount of $4.  Now, let's see how many times Pam can use her $2 coins to buy items from the kanaval. Since she has 2 coins of $1 each, she can buy 2 items that cost $1 each. But this still leaves her short of the remaining amount of $2.  To cover the remaining amount, Pam could use Fred's $2 coins. She could take 2 of his $1 coins and add them to her own $2 coins, which would give her a total of $4. This means that together, they have enough money to buy 4 items that cost $1 each at the kanaval.  So, the numeric answer is 4.
"Response:  First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles and then Madi walked 6 more miles, so together they walked 4 + 6 = 10 miles.  We also know that the total distance they traveled was 41 miles, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
4 + 6 = 41  
Now let's solve for x (the number of miles Madi walked):  
6 = 41 - 4  
6 = 37  
So Madi walked 37 miles."
Response:  If Tom has 4 loads of laundry and each load costs $15, then he will have to pay $15 x 4 = $60 for all four loads.
Response:  If Brian has 20 videos with 5 million views each, that means he has a total of 100 million views (20 x 5 million).  Now, if we compare this to Bobby's 3 billion views from his 5 videos, we can see that Bobby has much more views than Brian.  So, the answer is 3 billion.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in total, and they are located in the Highlands of Scotland. Since each unicorn has its own special horn, we can assume that there are at least as many different types of horns as there are unicorns. However, since some unicorns may have more than one horn (either because they grew two horns or because they found an extra horn somewhere), we need to be careful not to count any horns more than once. Therefore, let's use the multiplication principle to find out how many horns there are in total. There are 27 unicorns, and each unicorn has at least one horn, so there are 27 horns in total.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all items purchased: 

$7.50 x 2 = $15.00 (for two sandwiches)
$1.50 x 2 = $3.00 (for two bags of chips)
$1.00 x 2 = $2.00 (for two bottles of pop)
Total Cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
Now, let's add the 20% discount for buying at the bookstore:
Discount = $20.00 x 20% = $4.00
New Total = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
Finally, let's add the $5.00 tip:
Tip = $5.00
New Total = $16.00 + $5.00 = $21.00
So, the final amount paid would be $21.00."
Response:  If Mack makes 75 questions in one test and completes it with 5 correct answers, then he has 75 - 5 = 70 incorrect answers.  If he makes another test of 100 questions and completes it with 8 correct answers, then he has 100 - 8 = 92 incorrect answers.  Therefore, the total number of incorrect answers for both tests is 70 + 92 = 162.
Response:  If Gen 12 had 12 brothers and sisters, then Gen 22 would have 22 brothers and sisters.  So, if Gen 12 had 12 children, then Gen 22 would have 22 x 12 = 264 children.
"Response:  We have 20 machines in total, of which: 

* 12 are automatic (12 x 100% = 1200%) 
* 4 are manual (4 x 50% = 200%) 
* and 4 are semi-automatic (4 x 75% = 300%). 

So, the total availability of machines is: 1200 + 200 + 300 = 1700%."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 700 people in the village. Secondly, we know that every person has to work for at least two days per week (2 days x 700 people = 1400 days of work). Thirdly, we know that each person can only do one task per day (either farming or repairing the road), so we need to divide the total number of tasks by the number of people who can do them. In this case, we have 1400 tasks (2 days x 700 people) and 700 people who can do them, so we can calculate the average number of tasks per person as follows:  
1400 tasks / 700 people = 2 tasks per person  
Therefore, it will take approximately 2 tasks per person to finish all the work in the village."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jordan has to work for 2 days and he will be paid $10 per day. So, his total earnings for 2 days would be:  
$10 x 2 = $20  Secondly, we know that Jordan spent $20 on something. So, if we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings, we get:  
$20 - $20 = $0  Therefore, Jordan has $0 left after working for 2 days and spending $20."
"Response:  First, we know that John has $2, $3, and $4 dollars.  So he has a total of $2 + $3 + $4 = $9.  Now, if we subtract 10% of $9, we get:  
$9 x 0.10 = $0.90  
So John has $9 - $0.90 = $8.10 left after paying 10% tax."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each cookie.  We know that the price per cookie is $2 for small and $5 for large.  So, if we sell 3 small cookies, the cost would be:  
3 x $2 = $6  And if we sell 5 large cookies, the cost would be:  
5 x $5 = $25  Now, let's add up the costs:  $6 + $25 = $31  Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.  The total revenue is given as $92.  So, if we subtract the total cost of $31, we get:  
$92 - $31 = $61  Profit = $61"
Response:  First, we know that Jaden has $10$ apples and gives $100$ to each of his friends. So, he gives out $10 \times 3 = 30$ apples in total. Now, Jaden has $10 - 30 = 7$ apples left.
"Response:  First, we know that Johnny has $500 to spend on Legos.  Second, he wants to buy three sets of Legos that cost $300 each.  Third, he also wants to buy one set of Legos that costs $100.  Fourth, he has $500 to spend in total.  So, how many Legos can Johnny buy?  To find out, let's use an equation based on the information given:  
Let x be the number of sets of Legos that cost $300 each (since there are three such sets, x = 3).  Then, the total amount spent on these sets is 3x = 3(300) = 900.  Since Johnny has $500 to spend, we can write:  
900 + y = 500  where y represents the amount spent on the set that costs $100.  Solving for y, we get:  y = 500 - 900 = -400.  This means that Johnny cannot afford to buy any more Legos!  Therefore, the answer is zero."
Response:  First, we know that Debra has $30 in her account and she wants to withdraw $15. So, how much will be left in her account after the withdrawal?  We can use subtraction to find out.  If we subtract $15 from $30, we get:  $30 - $15 =?  Can you solve for the amount left in Debra's account after the withdrawal?
Response:  First, we know that Brittany has to pay $12 for grandma and $10 for Timmy. So she needs to collect $22 in total (12 + 10). If she collected $8 from Timmy, then she still owes $14 ($22 - $8) to grandma.
Response:  If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and James has fewer than 12 friends, then James cannot have more than 12 friends on Facebook. Therefore, the number of friends that James has on Facebook is at most 12 - 1 = 11.
Response:  First, we know that Steve can ride his bike at 3 miles per hour (mph) and he rode for 3 hours, so he traveled 3 x 3 = 9 miles.  Second, we know that Tim rode his skateboard at 264 feet per minute (ft/min) and he rode for 2 kilometers, which is equal to 2000 meters or 2000 x 1000 ft, so he traveled 264 x 2000 = 528,000 ft.  Now, let's convert both distances to the same unit of measurement, such as miles.  We know that there are 5280 ft in a mile, so we can divide the distance Tim traveled by this number to get the distance in miles:  528,000 ft / 5280 ft/mile = 100 miles  Therefore, Tim traveled 100 miles.
Response:  Firstly, Shawnda decided to use her inflatable swimming pool for the service. She thought this would be a good idea because she could easily set it up and take it down whenever needed. Next, she calculated that she would need 25 sticks of bamboo to support the pool. In the first round, five people came to help her set up the pool. They each carried four sticks of bamboo. In the second round, three more people came to help, and they also brought four sticks of bamboo each. Finally, one person remained to help Shawnda set up the last few sticks of bamboo. So, in total, how many sticks of bamboo did Shawnda receive from all the helpers? 
"Response:  First, we know that Carl has 10 cookies and he wants to sell them for $10. So, if we divide $10 by the cost of one cookie ($0.10), we get:  
$10 ÷ $0.10 = 100 cookies  
Therefore, Carl needs to sell 100 cookies to earn $10."
Response:  First, we know that Dave has $10 to spend on French fries and he wants to buy as many as possible. So, let's start with the cost of one serving of French fries, which is $3. If Dave buys only one serving, he will have spent all his money ($10) and won't be able to buy any more. Therefore, we can say that $3 is the maximum amount Dave can spend on each serving of French fries. Now, let's calculate how many servings of French fries Dave can buy with $10 if he spends $3 per serving. We can do this by dividing $10 by $3: $10 ÷ $3 = 3. This means that Dave can buy 3 servings of French fries with $10.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 3 classes in total (Lendi, Mekredi, and Vandredi). Each class has 2 sections (Kim and Jedi), so there are 3 x 2 = 6 sections in total. Now, we need to find out how many students are in each section. We know that there are 16 students in total, so let's divide them among the sections. Since each section has 8 students, we can write:  
Lendi: 8 + 8 = 16 students  
Mekredi: 8 + 8 = 16 students  
Vandredi: 8 + 8 = 16 students  Therefore, there are 16 students in each section, and since there are 3 sections, there are 3 x 16 = 48 students in total."
Response:  First, we know that Bill has 300 pieces of candy (ti pen). He gives 120 pieces to his friend (chokola) and keeps 60 pieces for himself (bagèt chak jou). Now, he has 60 - 120 = 40 pieces left. If he wants to make a batch of croissants that require 6 pieces each, how many batches can he make?  We can calculate this as follows:  40 / 6 = 6 batches   So, Bill can make 6 batches of croissants if he uses all the remaining candy.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Gorilla needs 400 bananas per day and Baboon needs 100 bananas per day. So, if we want to feed both of them for two days (2 x 2 = 4), then we need to provide:  
Gorilla - 400 x 2 = 800 bananas  
Baboon - 100 x 2 = 200 bananas  Total bananas required = 800 + 200 = 1000 bananas."
Response:  First, we know that Blake ran for 15 minutes and covered a distance of 100 meters. So, to find out how many meters he ran in one minute, we can divide the total distance by the time taken: Distance = Total distance / Time taken Distance = 100 meters / 15 minutes Distance = 6.67 meters per minute (approximately) Now, let's calculate the distance Kelly covered. We know that she ran for 40 minutes and covered a distance of 34 meters. So, to find out how many meters she ran in one minute, we can use the same formula as before: Distance = Total distance / Time taken Distance = 34 meters / 40 minutes Distance = 8.5 meters per minute (approximately) Since Kelly did not want to run more than Blake, she must have run at least 6.67 meters per minute, which is the speed at which Blake ran. Therefore, the distance Kelly covered is: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 8.5 meters/minute x 40 minutes Distance = 340 meters (approximately)
Response:  First, we know that Raphael bought four small items for $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on those items (4 x $1.5). Next, we know that he bought two medium-sized items for $4 each, so he spent another $8 on those items (2 x $4). Finally, we know that he bought one large item for $20, so he spent $20 on that item. In total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  First, we know that Finn has 11 apples in total. Next, he gives 6 of them to Lily and keeps 2 for himself. So, how many apples does Finn have left after giving some to Lily?  We can use subtraction to find out. If Finn gives 6 apples to Lily, then he has 11 - 6 = 5 apples left. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  First, we know that the volume of water in the tank is 5m^3.  Next, we are told that 7 pyre (or 7 cubic meters) of sand were added to the tank.  So, what is the new volume of water in the tank after adding the sand?  We can use the formula for volume of a mixture to find out:  V = V1 + V2, where V1 and V2 are the volumes of the two substances being mixed. In this case, V1 is the initial volume of water in the tank (5m^3), and V2 is the volume of the sand added (7m^3).  Therefore, the new volume of water in the tank after adding the sand is:  V = 5 + 7 = 12 m^3.  So, the answer is 12 m^3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Anakin has 10 zetwal lanmè (a), and he gives 6 to Locsin (b). So, Anakin has 10 - 6 = 4 zetwal lanmè left.  Next, we know that Locsin has 5 zetwal lanmè given by Anakin (c), so she has in total 5 + 4 = 9 zetwal lanmè.  Now, let's look at the cheval lanmè. We know that Anakin has 3 cheval lanmè (d) and he gives 2 to Locsin (e). So, Anakin has 3 - 2 = 1 cheval lanmè left. Locsin also has 3 cheval lanmè given by Anakin (f), so she has in total 3 + 1 = 4 cheval lanmè. Finally, we know that there are 2 plis clownfish (g) given by Anakin to Locsin. Therefore, the final number of zetwal lanmè, cheval lanmè, and plis clownfish possessed by each person is as follows: Anakin: 4 zetwal lanmè, 1 cheval lanmè, 2 plis clownfish Locsin: 9 zetwal lanmè, 4 cheval lanmè, 2 plis clownfish
Response:  First, we know that the original price of the item was $20 and it was discounted by 20%. So, what is the new price after the discount? We can calculate this as follows: New Price = Original Price x (1 - Discount Percentage) New Price = $20 x (1 - 0.20) New Price = $20 x 0.80 New Price = $16 Therefore, the new price of the item after the discount is $16. Now, if we want to find out how much we would have saved if we had bought the item at the original price and then applied the discount, we can use the following formula: Savings = Original Price - New Price Savings = $20 - $16 Savings = $4 So, in this case, we would have saved $4 if we had bought the item at the original price and then applied the discount.
Response:  We know that there are five machines and three figures in each machine.  Each figure costs $4, so we can calculate the total cost of all figures as follows: Total Cost = Number of Machines x Number of Figures per Machine x Price per Figure Total Cost = 5 x 3 x 4 = 60 So, the total cost of all figures is $60.
Response:  First, we know that if Jackie works for three months (90 days), she will earn $35 x 90 = $3150. However, the company charges her $90 per month, so she needs to pay $90 x 3 = $270. Therefore, her net income is $3150 - $270 = $2880.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items that Elvira wants to purchase. We can start with the laptop, which costs €1090. Next, she needs an external screen, keyboard, and speaker, which add up to €386 (€157 + €74 + €102). Finally, there is the scanner, which costs €157. So, in total, Elvira will have to pay €1579 (€1090 + €386 + €157) for all her desired purchases.

"Response:  First, we know that Pancho has $20 million and he wants to give $10 million to his friend. So, how much money will be left with Pancho after giving $10 million to his friend?  We can calculate this by subtracting $10 million from $20 million:  
$20,000,000 - $10,000,000 = $10,000,000  Therefore, Pancho will have $10 million left after giving $10 million to his friend."
Response:  First, we know that the price of the shirt is $ 25. Next, we know that the jacket costs twice as much as the shirt, so the price of the jacket is $ 25 x 2 = $ 50. Finally, we know that the pants cost $ 10 less than the jacket, so the price of the pants is $ 50 - $ 10 = $ 40. Therefore, the total cost of all three items is $ 25 + $ 50 + $ 40 = $ 115.
Response:  First, we have to calculate the number of spider eggs that hatched into normal spiders. We know that there were 80 spider eggs in total and 8 of them hatched into normal spiders. So, the number of normal spiders = 80 x 8/100 = 8. Now, let's calculate the number of mutant spiders. We know that there were 90 enséks (a type of spider) in total and 6 of them were mutants. So, the number of mutant spiders = 90 x 6/100 = 6. Finally, let's add up all the spiders we got: Normal spiders + Mutant spiders = 8 + 6 = 14. Therefore, the total number of spiders Jake has is 14.
Response:  First, we know that Sally has $8 and she spends $2 on a toy for her grandmother. So, she has $8 - $2 = $6 left. Next, we know that Sally gives $4 to her grandmother as a present. Therefore, Sally has $6 - $4 = $2 left after giving the present. Finally, we are asked how much money Sally will have in total if she saves $2 for 8 years at an interest rate of 5% per year. To calculate this, we can use compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r)^n where A is the future value, P is the principal amount (which is $2 in this case), r is the interest rate (which is 5% or 0.05), and n is the number of periods (which is 8 years x 12 months/year = 96 months). Plugging in the values, we get: A = $2(1 + 0.05)^96 ≈ $37.62 So, if Sally saves $2 for 8 years at an interest rate of 5% per year, she will have approximately $37.62 in total.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the minimum amount of money that Jessica needs to have in order to pay for her expenses.  We know that she has $300 per month for living expenses and $200 per month for credit card debt, so she needs at least $500 per month ($300 + $200) to cover all of her expenses.  Now, if Jessica wants to save 50% more than the minimum amount, we can multiply the minimum amount by 1.5 to get the new total.  So, the new total would be:  
$500 x 1.5 = $750  Therefore, Jessica needs to have at least $750 per month to cover all of her expenses and save 50% more than the minimum amount."
"Response:  First, we know that Billy has 60 pompettes (P) to prepare for his family of four (F). He needs to divide them equally among the members of his family, so each person will get 15 pompettes (15P). To do this, he needs to use 5 seconds (S) to cut and prepare each pompette. Therefore, the total time Billy needs to spend preparing all the pompettes is:  
Time = Number of pompettes x Time per pompette  
Time = 15P x 5S  
Time = 75S  
So, it will take Billy 75 seconds (or approximately 1 minute and 15 seconds) to prepare all the pompettes for his family."
"Response:  First, we know that Juan charges $3 for a small size and $2 for a medium size. We also know that he has 20 small sizes and 1 large size (since there are no more small sizes left). So, if Juan sold all of his drinks, he would have made:  
Small size x 20 = $60  
Medium size x 1 = $2  
Total sales = $62  
Now, let's calculate how much money Juan would have after deducting the cost of ingredients from total sales:  
Cost of ingredients = $0.50 per small size x 20 = $10  
Total sales - Cost of ingredients = $62 - $10 = $52  
Therefore, Juan would have $52 after deducting the cost of ingredients from total sales."
"Response:  We know that there are 240 people in total (240 = 80 + 160).  Of those 240 people, 80 are Japanese and 160 are Chinese.  If we subtract the number of Japanese from the total number of people, we get:  
240 - 80 = 160  So, there are 160 Chinese people.  Now, if we divide the number of Chinese people by 60 (the number of people in an equipment), we get:  
160 / 60 = 2  Therefore, there are 2 equipment of Chinese people."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid has $1500 in his savings account and he spends $400 to buy a new machine for his business. So, after buying the machine, he has $1500 - $400 = $1100 left in his savings account. Next, we know that he receives $6000 as a loan from the bank. Therefore, the total amount of money that Zaid now has is $1100 + $6000 = $7100. Now, let's calculate how much he can use for his personal expenses and how much he needs to repay to the bank. We know that he needs to pay back the loan of $6000 with interest. So, firstly, let's calculate the interest on the loan. The interest rate is not given in the problem, so we will assume it to be 10% per year (which means 1% per month). Therefore, the interest on the loan of $6000 for one month is $6000 x 1% = $60. So, the total amount that Zaid needs to repay to the bank is $6000 + $60 = $6060. Now, let's calculate how much he can use for his personal expenses. He has $7100 - $6060 = $1040 left after repaying the loan. Therefore, he can use $1040 for his personal expenses.
Response:  First, we know that Monica has $10k in her savings account.  Next, we know that she wants to buy a car that costs $4k.  So, after buying the car, Monica will have $10k - $4k = $6k left in her savings account.  Now, let's consider Bo's situation.  We know that he has $40k in his savings account and he wants to buy a car that costs $4k.  So, after buying the car, Bo will have $40k - $4k = $36k left in his savings account.  Therefore, the difference between Monica and Bo's savings accounts is $36k - $6k = $30k.
"Response:  First, we know that Lloyd has $10 to spend on math materials.  He spends 5 dollars for premium semester and 8 dollars for basic semester. So, how much money does he have left after buying both semesters?  We can use subtraction to find out.  
First, let's subtract the amount he spent for premium semester from his total amount of money:  
$10 - $5 = $5  
Now, let's subtract the amount he spent for basic semester from what he has left:  
$5 - $8 = $-3  
So, Lloyd has $3 less than what he had before buying both semesters."

"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra needs to deliver 200 roses to Fred by 5 pm.  Secondly, she has already prepared 150 roses and needs to make up for the remaining 50 roses.  Thirdly, she has 3 hours left before 5 pm to complete the delivery.  Now let's calculate how many roses Sandra can prepare in 3 hours:  
Time available = 3 hours = 3 x 60 minutes = 180 minutes  
Number of roses per minute = 150 / 60 = 2.5 roses/minute (since Sandra has already prepared 150 roses)  
Therefore, Sandra can prepare 2.5 x 180 = 450 roses in 3 hours.  Since she needs to deliver 200 roses, she will have enough roses after preparing 450 roses.  So, the answer is:  
Konbyen wouj roz Fred dwe delivre pa 5 pm = 450 roses."
Response:  First, we know that Jean has been working for 5 years and will retire at age 60. So, if he retires in 5 years, he will be 60 years old then.  Now, we are given that Jane is currently 30 years old.  If Jean retires in 5 years and Jane is currently 30 years old, then Jean will be 60 - 30 = 30 years older than Jane when he retires.  Therefore, the correct answer is 30.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the team can complete the race in 55 seconds if they run at their maximum speed of 400 meters per hour. This means that the distance of 400 meters can be covered in: Time = Distance / SpeedTime = 400 meters / 400 meters/hourTime = 1 hourSo, the team needs 1 hour to cover the distance of 400 meters. Now, let's find out how long it would take them to cover the same distance at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour. We know that:Speed = Distance / TimeSpeed = 400 meters / TimeTo find out the time taken to cover the distance at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour, we need to divide the distance by the speed:Time = Distance / SpeedTime = 400 meters / 60 kilometers/hourTime = 6.67 hoursSo, the team would take approximately 6.67 hours to cover the distance of 400 meters at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour.
"Response:  First, we know that Jerry has $100 and he wants to buy something that costs $30. So, if he buys the item, he will have $70 left ($100 - $30 = $70). Now, let's consider three possible scenarios for what Jerry might do with the remaining $70:  
Scenario 1: Jerry spends all $70 on another item. In this case, he will be left with no money ($70 - $70 = $0).  
Scenario 2: Jerry saves all $70. In this case, he will still have $70 after buying the first item ($70 + $0 = $70).  
Scenario 3: Jerry splits the $70 between two items, each costing $35. In this case, he will spend $35 on the second item, leaving him with $35 ($70 - $35 = $35)."

Response:  First, we know that there are 160 mosquitoes in total (10 x 16). Now, let's see how many of them will be distributed to each group. We have three groups, and each group will receive 60 mosquitoes (160 / 3 = 60). So, Group A will have 60 mosquitoes, Group B will have 60 mosquitoes, and Group C will have 60 mosquitoes as well. Next, we need to determine how many hamsters will be needed for each group. Since there are 5 mosquitoes per hamster, we can calculate the number of hamsters needed for each group as follows: Group A - 60/5 = 12 hamsters, Group B - 60/5 = 12 hamsters, and Group C - 60/5 = 12 hamsters. Therefore, there will be a total of 36 hamsters (12 x 3) to take care of all the mosquitoes.
Response:  First, we know that Mandy has $100 and she wants to buy something that costs $3. So, if she pays with a 2% discount, how much will she pay for the item?  To find out, we need to calculate 2% of $100 first.  2% of $100 = $100 x 0.02 = $2 Now, we subtract $2 from $100 to get the amount Mandy needs to pay for the item: $100 - $2 = $98 So, Mandy needs to pay $98 to buy the item with a 2% discount.  If she pays this amount, she will receive $3 in change (since $98 minus $3 is $95).  Therefore, the change Mandy will receive is $3.
Response:  First, we know that the cost of transporting 1 bag of cement is $2.  If she buys 20 bags, then the total cost of transportation will be $2 x 20 = $40.  Next, we need to calculate the profit made by the merchant.  We are told that the merchant sold each bag for $30, so if she sold all 20 bags, her total revenue would be $30 x 20 = $600.  Now, let's subtract the cost of transportation from the total revenue to find out the merchant's profit:  Profit = Revenue - Cost of Transportation  Profit = $600 - $40 = $560.
Response:  First, we know that Twa spent $20.25 on three tickets. That means each ticket cost $6.75 (20.25 / 3). Now, Twa also spent $4.50 for lunch at the park where they had their picnic (ticket price x 1 = $6.75). So, in total, Twa spent $24.75 ($20.25 + $4.50) on tickets and lunch.  Next, we need to find out how much change Twa should get back from the $33 that was left over after buying all the tickets and having lunch. To do this, we subtract the amount Twa spent ($24.75) from the amount left over ($33): Change = $33 - $24.75 = $8.25. Therefore, Twa should receive $8.25 in change.
Response:  First, we know that Jean collected 3 peaches in one minute. So, he collected 1 peach every 20 seconds (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). Now, if we want to find out how many peaches Jean will collect in 2 minutes, we can multiply the number of peaches he collects per minute by 2: 2 x 1 = 2 peaches. Therefore, Jean will collect 2 more peaches in 2 minutes.

Response: 1) The cost of one kilogram of cream is $20. 2) One kilogram is equal to 1000 grams. So, the cost of 2 dollars is equal to 2 x 1000 = 2000 grams. Therefore, Violetta can buy 2000 grams of cream with $20.
Response:  First, we know that one creon costs $1.20 and one ray costs $0.30. So if we want to buy 8 creons and 8 rays, how much will it cost in total?  We can start by calculating the cost of the creons: 8 x $1.20 = $9.60 Now let's calculate the cost of the rays: 8 x $0.30 = $2.40 Total cost = $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00
Response:  We know that there are 200 live chickens to be distributed among 40 restaurants, and each restaurant can receive at most 2 live chickens. So we need to find out how many times 2 goes into 200.  We can start by dividing 200 by 2: 200 / 2 = 100 with a remainder of 0. This means that 100 groups of 2 chickens can be formed from the total of 200 chickens. Since there are 40 restaurants, each restaurant will get 100 / 40 = 2.5 chickens (since 2.5 is not a whole number, we round down to 2 chickens per restaurant).
Response:  We know that there are 23786 people living in Soda and we also know that 8417 of them have more than 9 children. So, to find out how many families live in Soda, we need to subtract the number of people with more than 9 children from the total population. 23786 - 8417 = 15369. Therefore, there are 15369 families living in Soda.
Response:  First, Elaine collected 20 cats in the first month (1st month). In the second month (2nd month), she collected twice as many cats as she did in the first month, so she collected 2 x 20 = 40 cats. In the third month (3rd month), she collected three times as many cats as she did in the second month, so she collected 3 x 40 = 120 cats. Therefore, the total number of cats Elaine collected is 120 + 40 + 20 = 180 cats.
Response:  We know that Mark has to pay $5 for every 1000 copies he makes of Pbiblikatè A's work. So if he wants to make a total of 1000 copies, he will have to pay $5 x 10 = $50.
Response:  First, we know that Baldur has 5 big buckets of water and 6 small buckets of water.  If he pours all the big buckets into one container, he will have 5 x 20 = 100 liters of water.  Now, if he adds all the small buckets to the same container, he will have an additional 6 x 10 = 60 liters of water.  Therefore, in total, Baldur will have 100 + 60 = 160 liters of water.
"Response:  First, we know that the amount of money earned from selling 2000 units at $5000 is:  
$5000 x 2000 = $10,000,000  Next, we need to calculate the profit margin (%) based on the cost price of $5000 per unit:  Profit Margin = ($10,000,000 - $5000) / $5000 = 100%  So, for every unit sold, there is a profit of $5000 or 100% of the cost price."
Response:  First, we know that there are 10 eggs in the basket.  Second, we know that 5 of those eggs break when they hit the ground.  Third, we know that each broken egg produces 2 smaller eggs.  So, if 5 eggs break, then we have 5 x 2 = 10 smaller eggs.  Finally, we know that there are originally 10 eggs in the basket, and after all the breaking and hatching, there are 10 + 10 = 20 eggs left.  Therefore, the number of eggs that the farmer has at the end is 20.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many sandwiches can be made with 8 tranches of bread. We know that each sandwich requires 2 tranches of bread. So, we can make:  
8 tranches x 2 sandwiches/tranche = 16 sandwiches  Now, let's calculate how many omelets can be made with 3 eggs and 8 tranches of bread. We know that each omelet requires 2 tranches of bread. So, we can make:  
3 eggs x 2 omelets/egg = 6 omelets  Since we need 3 eggs for each omelet, we will use all 3 eggs. Therefore, the remaining bread after making omelets will be:  
8 tranches - 6 omelets = 2 tranches  Finally, we can make:  
16 sandwiches + 6 omelets = 22 dishes in total using 8 tranches of bread."
Response:  First, we know that Janet has 22 plums in total and she gives 10 to her friend. So, she has 22 - 10 = 12 plums left.  Next, we know that 6 of those plums are blue and 2 are red. Therefore, the number of blue plums is 12 - 6 = 6 and the number of red plums is 12 - 2 = 10.  Finally, we can see that Janet has 6 blue plums and 10 red plums.
Response:  First, we need to find out how much Brinley scored in total. We know that she got 89, 71, 92, and 100 on her four tests. So, let's add up these scores:  89 + 71 + 92 + 100 = 352 Now, we need to subtract the lowest score (71) from the total score to get the average:  352 - 71 = 281 Therefore, Brinley's average is 281.

Now, if we want to find out how much candy Joe will have after eating 40 grams, we can subtract 40 from 2000. That gives us:  
2000 - 40 = 1960 grams or approximately 1.96 kg of candy left for Joe."
Response:  First, we know that rose has 4 cats and each cat costs $10. So, the total cost of all four cats is:  4 x $10 = $40.  Next, we are told that Madi has two more cats than Rose, so Madi has:  2 + 4 = 6 cats.  And we know that each cat costs $10, so the total cost of all six cats for Madi is:  6 x $10 = $60.  Finally, we are asked how much more money Madi needs to buy the same number of cats as Rose. To find this difference, we subtract the cost of Rose's cats from the cost of Madi's cats:  $60 - $40 = $20.  Therefore, Madi needs $20 more to buy the same number of cats as Rose.
Response:  First, we know that each plate costs $6000/12 = $500. So, one dozen plates would cost $500 x 12 = $6000. Now, if we want to find out how much one plate costs when purchasing 1200 plates, we can divide the total cost of 1200 plates by the number of plates: $6000 / 1200 = $500 per plate.  Therefore, the price of one plate is $500.
Response:  First, we know that Sara wants to buy a new jacket and two pairs of shoes for herself. She has $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So she can buy either one or two pairs of shoes with her money. If she buys one pair of shoes, she will have $10 left over ($30 - $20 = $10). With this $10, she cannot afford to buy another pair of shoes because they cost more than what she has left. Therefore, if Sara wants to buy both pairs of shoes, she needs to find additional funds beyond her initial $30.  Now let's consider the second part of the problem. We are told that Sara gives Timoun $5 to buy four flowers. This means that Timoun has $5 - $4 = $1 left after buying the flowers. Since he only has $1 left, he cannot afford to buy any gifts for his mother. Therefore, Sara cannot use the $10 she has left over from her own budget to buy gifts for her mother.
Response:  First, we know that Jerry has collected $42 from the sale of his three sheep. Next, we need to find out how much money he would have made if he had sold five sheep instead of three. To do this, we can multiply the number of sheep he sold (three) by the price per sheep ($10): $$$3 x $10 = $30$$ So, if Jerry had sold five sheep instead of three, he would have made an additional $30. Now, let's add up all the money he made: $$$42 + $30 = $72$$ Therefore, Jerry would have made a total of $72 if he had sold five sheep instead of three.
Response:  First, we know that the rectangular field has a length of 1.5 miles and a width of 6 miles. So its area is: Area = Length x Width = 1.5 x 6 = 9 square miles. Now, if Gary wants to fence the entire field, he will need to enclose the whole area with a fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the perimeter would be: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width) = 2(1.5 + 6) = 2 x 7.5 = 15 miles. Since Gary only needs to fence a portion of the field, we can calculate the length of the fence he needs as follows: Fence length = Perimeter x Fraction of field enclosed = 15 x 0.33 (since 1/3 of the field is being enclosed) = 4.95 miles. Therefore, Gary needs to build a fence that is approximately 4.95 miles long to enclose one-third of his rectangular field.
Response:  First, we know that Sloane can eat 100 kilograms of ice cream in one sitting.  If she eats only half as much (50 kilograms), then she will have to eat twice as much (2 x 50 = 100) to reach her goal of consuming 100 kilograms of ice cream.  Therefore, if Sloane eats 50 kilograms of ice cream, she will still need to consume another 50 kilograms to reach her target.
Response:  First, we know that Jerry can fill up a tank in 4 minutes with an average flow rate of 4 gallons per minute (gpm). So, he can fill up the entire 16-gallon tank in 4 x 16 = 64 minutes. Now, let's calculate how long it would take for the water to reach the top of the tank at a constant flow rate of 4 gpm. We know that the height of the tank is 16 feet, and there are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot. Therefore, the volume of water in the tank is 16 x 7.48 = 123.52 gallons. Since the flow rate is constant, the time it takes for the water to reach the top of the tank is directly proportional to the volume of water in the tank. So, we can use the formula: Time = Volume / Flow Rate. In this case, Time = 123.52 / 4 = 30.88 minutes. Therefore, it would take approximately 30.88 minutes for the water to reach the top of the tank if filled continuously at a constant flow rate of 4 gpm.
"Response:  First, we know that Lori spent $320.00 and received $32.00 in change. So, if we subtract $32.00 from $320.00, we get:  
$320.00 - $32.00 = $288.00  Now, we know that Lori paid $288.00 for something. But we don't know what it was yet! To find out, we need to divide $288.00 by $4.00 (since each dollar is divided into 100 cents). So, we can divide $288.00 by $4.00 like this:  
$288.00 ÷ $4.00 = 72  This means that Lori bought 72 items at $4.00 each!"
Response:  First, we know that Janeth has $2000 and she wants to return $10% of it in cash. So, if she returns $10%, then she will have $2000 - $200 = $1800 left. Now, if she pays $165 for 12 months, then she will have paid $165 / 12 = $13.75 per month. Therefore, her balance after paying $165 would be $1800 - $13.75 = $1786.25.
Response:  We know that Gen 4 has 3 roses and Gen 7 has 5 roses. So we can start with the total number of roses in both generations: Total = 3 + 5 = 8 roses.  Now let's find out how many daisies are needed to fill the vases. Since each generation has 8 roses, we need half as many daisies to fill the vases: Half = 8/2 = 4 daisies. Therefore, there will be 4 daisies in each vase.
Response:  First, we know that Adrian has two children, so we can write:  A = 2 (since Adrian has 2 children) Now, we know that each of Adrian's children has two children as well, so we can write:  B = 2 x 2 = 4 (since each child has two children) Now, we know that Harriet is one of Adrian's children, and she has two children herself, so we can write:  C = 2 (since Harriet has two children) Finally, we know that Zack is one of Harriet's children, so we can write:  D = 1 (since Zack is one of Harriet's children) Putting it all together, we get:  A = 2 B = 4 C = 2 D = 1 So, there are 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9 people in total.
Response:  First, we know that Naomi made 68 pens.  Next, we know that Yuri made 10 more than Naomi. So, Yuri made 68 + 10 = 78 pens.  Now, we know that Brianna and Naomi together made 17 more than Naomi. So, Brianna and Naomi together made 68 + 17 = 85 pens.  Finally, we know that Jojo made fewer pens than all of them. Therefore, Jojo made fewer than 85 pens.  So, the number of pens Jojo made is:  85 - (the number of pens made by all the other girls)  In this case, the number of pens made by all the other girls is:  68 + 78 + 85 = 231  So, Jojo made:  85 - 231 = 146 pens.
"Response:  First, we know that Carmen can finish 10 minutes of work in 5 minutes (2 x 5 = 10). Now, let's find out how long it would take her to complete 3 and 8 devinettes if she works at the same speed.  
For 3 devinettes, we have: 3 x 5 = 15 minutes For 8 devinettes, we have: 8 x 5 = 40 minutes So, Carmen would need 15 minutes to complete 3 devinettes and 40 minutes to complete 8 devinettes."
Response:  We know that the capacity of the larger tank is 120 liters and we want to fill it up with water from the smaller tank which has a capacity of 90 liters. So, we need to find out how many times we can fill the smaller tank in the larger one. To do this, we divide the capacity of the larger tank (120) by the capacity of the smaller tank (90): 120 / 90 = 1.33 or approximately 4 times. Therefore, we can fill the larger tank 4 times with water from the smaller tank.
"Response:  First, we know that Andy has 90 Jerans of Ak-47 and 40 Petya MWENS.  So, let's calculate the total number of bullets he has:  
90 x 30 (Jerans of Ak-47) = 2700 bullets  
40 x 15 (Petya MWENS) = 600 bullets  
Total number of bullets = 2700 + 600 = 3300 bullets"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of constructing one house is $15,000 and the contractor has already paid $3,000 as advance payment. So, the remaining amount to be paid by the client is:  
$15,000 - $3,000 = $12,000 Now, if the contractor charges $12,000 for building two houses, then the total amount he will charge for both houses is:  
$12,000 x 2 = $24,000 Therefore, the client needs to pay $24,000 to the contractor for building two houses."
Response:  First, we know that Carlos has 3 cans of paint and each can costs $30. So, the total cost for Carlos is 3 x $30 = $90.  Next, we know that Benji has 18 cans of paint and each can costs $18. So, the total cost for Benji is 18 x $18 = $324.  Now, let's add the total cost for both Carlos and Benji: $90 + $324 = $414.  Therefore, the total cost for all the paint cans is $414.
Response:  First, we know that Andre plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester for $6 per mile.  Second, we know that he will drive for 12 hours (bi) and then return for another 12 hours (retournen).  Finally, we know that he wants to calculate how much it will cost him in total.  So let's start by calculating the distance traveled during each leg of the trip:  Leg 1 (New Jersey to Rochester): 12 hours x 60 miles/hour = 720 miles  Leg 2 (Rochester to New Jersey): 12 hours x 60 miles/hour = 720 miles  Total distance traveled: 720 + 720 = 1440 miles Now, let's calculate the total cost of the trip using Andre's rate of $6 per mile:  Leg 1 (New Jersey to Rochester): 1440 miles x $6/mile = $8,640  Leg 2 (Rochester to New Jersey): 1440 miles x $6/mile = $8,640  Total cost of the trip: $8,640 + $8,640 = $17,280 Therefore, the total cost of Andre's round-trip journey from New Jersey to Rochester and back again would be $17,280.
Response:  First, we know that James has 30 high-quality Pokémon and 20 medium-quality Pokémon. So he has a total of 50 Pokémon.  Next, we know that he needs to add 8 more high-quality Pokémon to reach his goal of having 40 high-quality Pokémon.  Since each high-quality Pokémon costs $14, this means he will need to spend $112 ($14 x 8) to achieve his goal.  Therefore, the final amount James will have spent is $162 ($112 + $50).
Response:  First, we know that the total cost of the meal is $6.50 (burrito at $6.50).  Then, she added extra items worth $2.00 (avocado for $1.00, guacamole for $1.00, and two salsas for $0.25 each).  So, the new total cost is $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50.  However, she decided to add chips for another $3.00, bringing the final total to $8.50 + $3.00 = $11.50.  Therefore, the correct answer is $11.50.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kalinda can travel at a speed of 360 meters per minute. Secondly, she adds 4 minutes to her journey. So, if she travels for 4 minutes more, how far will she go? To find out, we need to multiply her speed by the number of minutes she travels extra. In this case, it is 4 minutes x 360 meters/minute = 1440 meters. Therefore, Kalinda will travel an additional 1440 meters.
"Response:  First, we know that Ashlyn has 120 pieces of melon and she wants to sell 30% of them. So, if we multiply 120 by 30%, we get: 

120 x 30% = 36 

So, Ashlyn will have 36 pieces of melon left after selling 30%. Now, if we want to find out how many pieces of melon Ashlyn can buy back with $3, we need to divide $3 by the price per piece of melon. Let's assume the price per piece of melon is $1. Then: 

$3 ÷ $1 = 3 

So, Ashlyn can buy back 3 pieces of melon with $3. Therefore, the number of pieces of melon Ashlyn can buy back with $3 is 3."
"Response:  First, we know that the cost of the machine is $20,000.  Second, we know that the seller charges a 10% tax on the price of the machine.  Third, we know that the buyer pays an additional $1000 for registration fees.  So, to find out how much the buyer has to pay in total, we can calculate as follows:  
Total Cost = Price of Machine + Tax on Machine + Registration Fees Total Cost = $20,000 + (10% x $20,000) + $1000 Total Cost = $20,000 + $2000 + $1000 = $40,000 Therefore, the buyer has to pay a total of $40,000 to purchase and register the machine."
Response:  First, we know that Kylie collected 5 more coconuts than Robert in Lendi. So if Robert collected 20 coconuts, then Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 coconuts in Lendi. Next, we know that Kylie collected 2 fewer coconuts than Robert in Madi. So if Robert collected x coconuts in Madi, then Kylie collected x - 2 coconuts there. Since Kylie collected 25 coconuts in total (in both Lendi and Madi), we can set up the equation: 25 = x + (x - 2). Solving for x, we get: x = 13. Therefore, Robert collected 13 coconuts in Madi.
"Response:  We have 50 fem and we want to know how much cash we will get if we sell them at $10 per fem.  First, let's calculate the total value of all the fem:  
Total Value = Number of Fem x Price Per Fem Total Value = 50 x 10 Total Value = 500 Next, let's subtract the cost of the fem from the total value to find out how much cash we will get: Cash = Total Value - Cost Cash = 500 - 50 Cash = 450 Therefore, selling 50 fem at $10 per fem will give us $450 in cash."

Response:  First, we know that Steve has 6 tomato plants and he wants to grow cherry tomatoes.  Second, we know that each cherry tomato plant needs at least 3 feet of space between them.  So, if Steve wants to grow 3 tomato plants, he will need at least 9 feet of space (3 x 3).  Therefore, Steve can only grow 2 cherry tomato plants because he doesn't have enough space for all three plants.
Response:  First, we know that Jan has 20 friends in total and wants to divide them into 4 groups of equal size (tranches). Since there are more than 4 people in each group, we can assume that each group will have an odd number of people. Now, let's look at how many people are in each group based on the information given.  Group Size = Total Friends / Number of Groups  Group Size = 20 / 4  Group Size = 5  So, each group will have 5 people.  Therefore, the remaining person who is not included in any group is the one who gets left out or excluded from the activity.  The person who gets left out is Jan herself!
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money she will have after buying 25 new plants at $10 each (since she has $30 left).  Total cost of new plants = 25 x $10 = $250  Now, let's subtract the total cost from her remaining amount:  $30 - $250 = -$220  So, she will be left with -$220 or $220 less than what she had before buying the new plants.
"Response:  First, we know that Johnny has $20 and he adds $10 more. So, his total amount is:  
$20 + $10 = $30  Now, let's see what happens when he spends $10 from this amount:  
$30 - $10 = $20  Therefore, after spending $10, Johnny will have $20 left."
Response:  If Jessa is 20 years old and Mary is twice as old as Jessa, then Mary would be 40 years old (2 x 20 = 40).  So, if Mary gives $10 to Joan, Joan will have $10 + $40 = $50.
Response:  First, we know that 1000 students are divided into three groups of 333 each (1000 / 3 = 333).  Next, we know that 30% of the students in group A pass the exam (30% x 333 = 99.9), so there are 99.9 passing students in group A.  We also know that 3/5 of the students in group B pass the exam (3/5 x 333 = 200), so there are 200 passing students in group B.  Finally, we know that 3/5 of the students in group C pass the exam (3/5 x 333 = 200), so there are 200 passing students in group C as well.  Therefore, the total number of passing students is 99.9 + 200 + 200 = 500.
Response:  First, we know that James has 6 bonbons and gives 3 to Robert. So, James has 6 - 3 = 3 bonbons left. Next, we know that Jan has 54 sweets and gives 3 to Robert. So, Jan has 54 - 3 = 51 sweets left. Now, if Jan gives 3 sweets to Robert, she will have 51 - 3 = 48 sweets left. Therefore, the number of sweets Konbyen Sirèt Jan genyen (Jan gives) is 48.
Response:  If we have $10$ people in total (Dolly and Pandora), and each person has $2$ bags of candy (liv), then the total number of candies is $2 \times 10 = 20$. Now, if we want to collectively own all the candies equally among ourselves, we can divide $20$ by $10$, which gives us $\frac{20}{10} = 2$. So, each person will get $2$ bags of candy.
Response:  First, we know that there are 5 friends (Mike, etc.) and they will each write a letter to their friend who lives far away (2 letters). Each letter will take 2 minutes to write (1 minute per letter). So, in total, it will take 4 minutes to write both letters (2 x 2 = 4). Now, let's add the time it takes for them to walk to the mailbox and back (assuming it takes 1 minute each way or 2 minutes round trip): Total time = 4 minutes + 2 minutes = 6 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is 6 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that Jason has $1000 worth of phone plans and he uses $15 per month for his own calls. That means he has $985 left for other purposes (1000 - 15 = 985). Now, if he makes 300 minutes of successful calls each month, he will have used up $30 worth of his balance ($30 x 300 = 9000). So, after making those calls, he will be left with $985 - 9000 = $95. Therefore, Jason can make $95 worth of calls in a month using his current phone plan.
Response:  First, we know that Griffin has 24 friends and Kyle has 5 more than Griffin. So, Kyle has 24 + 5 = 29 friends. Next, we know that Billy has 3 more than Kyle, so Billy has 29 + 3 = 32 friends. Finally, we know that Ginger has 1 less than Billy, so Ginger has 32 - 1 = 31 friends. Therefore, if Griffin has 27 friends, then Ginger will have 27 - 1 = 26 friends.
Response:  We know that there are 32 escales in one lot of aquarium and each scale has 4 eskals. So, we can start with the first scale and calculate as follows:  1st scale: 4 eskals x 32 eskals = 128 eskals  2nd scale: 128 eskals x 4 eskals = 512 eskals  3rd scale: 512 eskals x 4 eskals = 2048 eskals And so on... Therefore, the total number of eskals in n lots of aquarium is given by:  2048 eskals x (n - 1) lots =? To find out how many eskals are needed for n lots of aquarium, we need to add up all the eskals from the first scale to the last scale. Since there are 32 scales in total, we have:  2048 eskals + 1024 eskals +... + 32 eskals =? The sum of these numbers is:  2048 + 1024 +... + 32 = 32768 eskals Therefore, the total number of eskals in n lots of aquarium is 32768 eskals.
"Response:  First, we know that Jean spent $250 on makeup and had to return $100 (10% of the total amount) because she didn't like it. So, the amount left after returning is: 
$250 - $100 = $150  Next, we know that Jean used 6 products from the makeup set, so each product cost: 
$150 / 6 = $25 per product Now, let's calculate how much Jean paid for each foundation shade: 
$25 x 4 = $100 Since Jean bought 4 foundation shades, she paid $100 in total for them. Therefore, the final price of the remaining products is: 
$150 - $100 = $50 So, the final price of the makeup set after returning $100 is $50."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all ingredients and decorations for the party. We can do this by adding up the prices given in the problem:  Total Cost = $12 (for cat food) + $43 (for anniversary cake) + $15 (for decorations) + $4 (for invitations) + $22 (for sake bombs) = $98 Next, we need to divide the total cost among the two parties equally. To do this, we can simply divide the total cost by two:  $98 / 2 = $49 per party So, each party will pay $49 for the total cost of ingredients and decorations.
Response:  First, we know that each chicken costs $1.50.  If Chef Jean has bought four chickens, then he has spent $1.50 x 4 = $6.00 on chickens.  Now, if each live chicken weights 50 pounds and Chef Jean has bought four of them, then he has bought 50 pounds x 4 = 200 pounds of live chickens.  Finally, since one pound of meat is equal to $1.50, then Chef Jean has spent $200 / $1.50 = $133.33 on meat.  So, the total amount that Chef Jean will have to pay for the ingredients is $6.00 + $133.33 = $139.33.
Response:  First, we know that Sue eats 4 fruit-flavored chocolate bars (bonbons) per day and each bar contains 200 calories. So, Sue consumes 4 x 200 = 800 calories from bonbons daily.  Next, we are given that Lendi eats 5 bonbons in one sitting and has 13 left over afterward. Therefore, Lendi consumes 5 x 200 = 1000 calories from bonbons in this instance.  Finally, we need to find out how many more calories Sue consumes compared to Lendi. To do this, we subtract the number of calories Lendi consumes from the number of calories Sue consumes:  800 - 1000 = -200  Since the result is negative, it means that Sue consumes fewer calories than Lendi does. In other words, Sue consumes less than Lendi.
