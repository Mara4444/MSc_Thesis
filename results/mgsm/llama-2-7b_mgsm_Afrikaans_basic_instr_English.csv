Explanation: To calculate how long it will take for Carlos to start making money with his eucalyptus tree, we need to consider the initial cost of purchasing the seedling ($90), as well as the annual costs of caring for the tree (water and fertilizer at $3 per year).

"Response: 
The handeler will make a purchase decision between two investment plans: jewelry worth R5,000 or electronic devices worth R8,000. The financial advisor speculates that the jewelry market will appreciate by 2.5%, while the electronics market will appreciate by 1.2% within the same month. If the trader wants to maximize their returns at the end of the month by making a choice, how much profit would this be?
To calculate the profit, we need to use the formula for compound interest:
Profit = PV x (1 + r)^n - PV
Where:
PV = Present Value (the initial amount invested)
r = Annual rate of return (in this case, the appreciation rates per year)
n = Number of years (in this case, 1 month)

Using the given information, we can plug in the values as follows:
PV = R5,000 (jewelry) or R8,000 (electronics)
r = 2.5% (jewelry) or 1.2% (electronics)
n = 1 month

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
For jewelry: Profit = R5,000 x (1 + 0.025)^1 - R5,000 = R750
For electronics: Profit = R8,000 x (1 + 0.012)^1 - R8,000 = R960
Therefore, if the trader chooses to invest in jewelry, they will make a profit of R750 at the end of the month, and if they choose to invest in electronics, they will make a profit of R960."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, John sold all of his LEGO sets for $15 each and used the money to buy 8 video games at $20 each. This means that he has $15 x 8 = $120 from selling his LEGO sets and $20 x 8 = $160 from buying video games, for a total of $120 + $160 = $280. Since he had 13 LEGO sets initially, this means that he still has 13 - 8 = 5 left after buying the video games."

"Response: 187500
Explanation: To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, you need to consider both the initial value of her pension and the yearly increases. The initial value is $50,000 per year, which means that after 20 years, the value would be $50,000 x 1.2 = $60,000 per year. Then, for each additional year of service, the increase is 5%, so the next 10 years would have an increase of $60,000 x 5% = $3000 per year, bringing the total to $90,000 per year. Therefore, after 30 years of service, Marcy's annual pension would be $90,000 per year."
"Response:  $2365.87
Explanation: To calculate the total amount that Aleena paid for electricity over the year, we need to consider two factors: (1) the initial deposit of $140 per month, and (2) the reduction in price of 10% for the second half of the year.
The formula to use is: Total Amount = Initial Deposit + (Initial Deposit x Reduction Percentage x Number of Months in Second Half).
In this case, the calculation would be as follows:
Total Amount = $140 + ($140 x 10%) x 6 = $2365.87
Therefore, the total amount that Aleena paid for electricity over the year was $2365.87."

Since each dose container contains 110 tablets, Cecilia will use 67,900 / 110 = 614 containers of medicine during the first year. Therefore, Cecilia will use approximately 16 years worth of medicine during the first year of her dog's life."

"Response: 35 pounds (or 15.9 kg) of applesauce.
Explanation:
To determine how much applesauce Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of applesauce that all the adults and children at the picnic will want to eat. The question states that there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. Each adult is expected to eat 10 pounds (or 4.5 kg) of applesauce, while each child is expected to eat half as much, or 5 pounds (or 2.3 kg). Therefore, the total amount of applesauce needed for the entire group is:

20 adults x 10 pounds = 200 pounds (or 90.7 kg)
+ 5 children x 5 pounds = 25 pounds (or 11.3 kg)
Total amount of applesauce needed = 200 + 25 = 225 pounds (or 102.4 kg)
Since Ted hopes to have enough applesauce for everyone, he should bring 225 pounds (or 102.4 kg) of applesauce to the picnic."

"Response: 
Sasha will make $380 in profit if she sells all of her wood.
Explanation:
To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to subtract the cost of the wood from the amount she sold it for. The cost of each piece of wood is $10 (for the 2x4s) or $16 (for the 4x4s). So, if she sells all 10 pieces of 2x4 wood, she will make $100 ($10 x 10 = $100) and if she sells all 5 pieces of 4x4 wood, she will make $80 ($16 x 5 = $80). In total, Sasha will make $380 in profit if she sells all of her wood."

Explanation: To calculate the price of a bag of chips after 36 months, we need to apply the given percentage increase in price every two months. The formula for calculating the new price is: New Price = Original Price x (1 + Percentage Increase)^Number of Months.
In this case, the original price was $20, and the percentage increase was 20%. So, after 2 months, the new price would be: New Price = $20 x (1 + 20%)^2 = $24. After another 2 months, the new price would be: New Price = $24 x (1 + 20%)^4 = $27.20. And so on.
To find the final price after 36 months, we can continue applying the formula until we reach that number. Therefore, the price of a bag of chips after 36 months will be: New Price = $20 x (1 + 20%)^36 = $148."

Explanation: The cost of each hat is $25, and there are three hats in total. Therefore, the total cost of the hats is $25 x 3 = $75. Since the question states that the cost of each badge is three times the cost of the hat, the cost of each badge is $75 x 3 = $225. Finally, since the question states that the cost of each pair of shoes is equal to the average cost of the hat and badge, the cost of each shoe is ($75 + $225) / 2 = $150. Therefore, the total cost of all five items (hats, badges, and two pairs of shoes) is $75 + $225 + $150 + $150 + $150 = $690."

Explanation: To calculate how many times Sara needs to do the chores (grass cutting and baby sitting) before she can afford the dress and shoes, we need to divide the total cost of the items by the amount she earns per time doing the chores. In this case, the total cost of the items is $30 + $20 = $50, and Sara earns $5 per time she does baby sitting. Therefore, Sara needs to do the chores 50 / 5 = 6 times before she can afford the dress and shoes."
