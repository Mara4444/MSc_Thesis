"Response: 24 years
Explanation:
Carlos will have to wait for 24 years before he can harvest his orange tree and start making profits from it. The calculation is as follows:
Years until profit = Total cost of planting + Annual maintenance costs - Revenue per year / Revenue per year
= $90 + ($3/year) x (7 oranges/year) - $1.5/orange
= $90 + $21 - $1.5
= $112.5
Dividing this amount by the revenue per year gives us the number of years required to break even:
$112.5 / $1.5/orange = 24 years
Therefore, Carlos has to wait for 24 years before he can start making profits from his orange tree."

Explanation:
Polly can throw the mirror 400 feet away from her location, which means that if she throws it at the dragon, it will take 400 feet / 5 = 80 seconds for the reflection of the fire to reach her. Since the dragon is 300 meters away from Polly, it will take an additional 300 meters / 5 = 60 seconds for the fire to reach Polly.

Explanation:
Charlie can make 10 stearin lights from 1 kg of beeswax. The cost of 1 kg of beeswax is $10 per kg, and he sells each stearin light for $2. Therefore, if he makes and sells 20 stearin lights, his total revenue will be:
Revenue = Number of stearin lights x Selling price per stearin light
= 20 x $2
= $40
His cost of producing each stearin light is:
Cost = Cost of 1 kg of beeswax / Number of stearin lights produced
= $10 / 10
= $1 per stearin light
Therefore, his net profit (revenue - cost) will be:
Net Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $40 - $10
= $30
So, Charlie's net profit will be $30."

Explanation:
Viss worked for the same company for 40 years and received a pension of $50,000 per year after retiring at age 65. After 20 years, she became eligible to receive 5% of her pension annually, which is equal to $2,500 ($50,000 x 5%). Since she retired at age 65 and received her pension for 30 years, her total pension amount would be:
$50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000
Adding the annual 5% increase in her pension, we get:
$1,500,000 + (5% x $1,500,000) = $1,600,000
Therefore, Visla will have a total pension amount of $1,600,000 after working for the same company for 40 years and receiving her pension for 30 years."

"Response:  $45
Explanation:  To calculate how much Sheila will pay each month, we need to use the formula: Total Cost / Number of Months = Monthly Payment. In this case, the total cost is $150 (five mobile phones x $30 per phone), and the number of months is three. Therefore, Sheila's monthly payment will be: $150 / 3 = $46.67. Since there is a 2% interest rate, Sheila will also have to pay an additional amount as interest, which can be calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal is $46.67 (the monthly payment), the rate is 2%, and the time is one month. So, the interest due for the first month is: $46.67 x 2% x 1 = $0.93. Therefore, Sheila's total monthly payment for the next three months will be: $46.67 + $0.93 = $48.50."

We know that the total number of gumballs is 22 + 4 = 26. Since there are 12 blue gumballs, we can subtract that amount from the total number of gumballs to find the number of red gumballs: 26 - 12 = 14 Therefore, there are 14 red gumballs.

"Response: 48 hours
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Bill has 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes. Let's assume that each roll is 2.5 cm long, each croissant is 2.5 cm long, and each baguette is 1.5 meters long. To calculate the total length of all the baked goods, we can multiply the number of each type by its corresponding length:
Rolls: 300 x 2.5 = 750 cm (or 7.5 meters)
Croissants: 120 x 2.5 = 300 cm (or 3 meters)
Baguettes: 60 x 1.5 = 90 cm (or 0.9 meters)
Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods:
Total length = Rolls + Croissants + Baguettes = 7.5 + 3 + 0.9 = 11.4 meters
Since Bill said he will work for 48 hours straight, it means he will have worked for 48 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 2880 minutes. Therefore, the time it would take for Bill to eat all the baked goods is:
Time = Total length / Working time = 11.4 meters / 2880 minutes = 40 minutes
So, Bill will finish eating all the baked goods in approximately 40 minutes."

Explanation:
To calculate how many bananas must be ordered in total over two months, we need to first determine how many each species of monkey needs per month. The gorilla needs 400 bananas per month, and the baboon needs 100 bananas per month. Therefore, the total number of bananas needed by all three species is:

Gorilla: 400 x 2 = 800 bananas
Baboon: 100 x 2 = 200 bananas
Total: 800 + 200 = 1000 bananas
Since there are 30 days in each month, dividing the total number of bananas needed by the number of days results in an average of 33.33 bananas per day (rounded up to 365). Therefore, the answer is 365 bananas."

Kelly rode along one side of the field and then back along the other side, covering a distance of 34 times the length of the field (34 x 100 = 3400 meters).
Therefore, Kelly covered a longer distance than Blake by 3400 - 150 = 3250 meters."

Sally One is not mentioned in the question, so its age is unknown.
Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, which means it is 3 + 10 = 13 years old.
Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Three, which means she is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.
Sally Four is 8 years younger than Sally Three, which means it is 8 - 8 = 0 years old (i.e., it is born). Therefore, the total number of years these four birds have lived is:
13 + 16 + 0 + 0 = 39 years."

To find out how much juice they used to make $25 in profit, we need to know how many liters of juice they sold. According to the question, they sold 20 glasses of juice per liter, and they made $25 in profit. Therefore, the number of glasses of juice they sold is:

20 glasses/liter x 20 liters = 400 glasses
Since each glass of juice costs $50, the total amount of money they made from selling juice is:

400 glasses x $50/glass = $20,000
Therefore, they spent $6 (3 dollars per liter x 2 liters) on lemons and made $19,940 ($20,000 - $6) in profit."

Explanation: If there are 10 cages with hamsters that each receive 5 pieces of food, and there is one canary cage with 20 pieces of food, then in total there will be 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of food distributed among the small rodents. Since no other part of the store uses any food, all 50 pieces of food will be used by the hamsters. Therefore, if 160 pieces of food were initially given out, then after it was divided among the hamsters, there would be 160 / 50 = 3.2 burrows with hamsters. Since there are 4 burrows per cage, there will be 3.2 x 4 = 12.8 burrows with hamsters."

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The price of each bag of wheat is $20.
* It costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse.
* Handler makes a profit of $400 after selling all bags at a price of $30 each.

Now, let's calculate how many bags Handler can sell:

Profit = Price per bag x Number of bags sold
= $400 / ($20 per bag - $2 transportation cost)

Solving for Number of bags sold, we get:
Number of bags = Profit / (Price per bag - Transportation cost)
= $400 / ($20 - $2)
= 16

Therefore, Handler can sell 16 bags of wheat."

Explanation: The information provided in the question is as follows:
* Tom plants 10 trees per year.
* He also cuts down 2 trees every quarter year (i.e., every 3 months).
* He starts with 50 trees.
* After 10 years, 30% of the trees are gone.
From this information, we can calculate that Tom has planted a total of 10 x 10 = 100 trees over the course of 10 years. Since he cuts down 2 trees every quarter year, he will have cut down a total of 2 x 4 = 8 trees during the same period. Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
100 - 8 = 92 trees.
So, the answer to the question ""Kor mange tre har han att?"" is 92."

Response:  To calculate the average score of Brinley after removing the lowest grade, we need to find out which grade is the lowest and then subtract it from the total number of grades. In this case, the lowest grade is 71, so we will subtract it from the total number of grates = 5 (the number of tests taken). Therefore, the updated total number of grades is = 5 - 1 = 4. Now, we can calculate the average score by dividing the total number of grades by 4 = 93 / 4 = 23. So, Brinley's average score after removing the lowest grade is 23.

Explanation:
To find out how much Janeth will have to pay back, we need to calculate the total amount she borrowed and then multiply it by the interest rate (which is 10%). The formula for calculating interest is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal is $2000, the rate is 10%, and the time is 1 year (or 12 months). So, the interest owed by Janeth is: Interest = $2000 x 10% x 1 = $200. Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Janeth needs to pay back: Total Amount = Principal + Interest = $2000 + $200 = $2200. Therefore, Janeth will have to pay back $165 per month for 12 months to cover the total amount she borrowed plus the interest."

Explanation:
Jason has 1000 minutes of phone time per month, which he uses up by calling his boss every day for 15 minutes and having 300 conversations in total that month. To find out how many minutes he has left after 30 days, we need to subtract the number of minutes used so far from the total amount of phone time available. In this case, Jason has used 15 minutes/day x 30 days = 450 minutes, plus 300 conversations x 15 minutes/conversation = 4500 minutes, for a total of 4950 minutes. Deducting the amount used so far from the total amount available gives us 505 minutes (or 8 hours and 15 minutes) remaining for the next 30 days."

Explanation:
Sue ate 4 gongs of candy on Monday, which means she ate 4 x 20 = 80 candies. Since Tuesday is twice as many candies as Monday, Sue ate 2 x 80 = 160 candies on Tuesday. Sister Si ate 5 kakes on Monday and 13 kakes on Tuesday, each kake having 200 calories. Therefore, the total number of calories consumed by Sue and Sister Si on Monday was 5 x 200 = 1000 calories, and on Tuesday it was 13 x 200 = 2600 calories. So, the difference in calories between Sue and Sister Si is 2600 - 1000 = 1600 calories."
