Response:  A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. So the total amount of fiber needed is 3/2 = 1.5 bolts of blue fiber and 1.5/2 = 0.75 bolts of white fiber. Therefore, it takes a total of 1.5 + 0.75 = 2.25 bolts of fiber to make one robe.

"Response:  To determine the maximum distance from which Polly can hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the additional throwing distance provided by the gemstone.
The formula for calculating the distance traveled by an object under thrown is given by:
distance = (initial velocity x angle of projection) + (acceleration x time)
In this case, the initial velocity of the javelin is constant, so we can ignore it. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2, and the time taken to reach the maximum height is given by:
time = distance / acceleration = 400 ft / 9.8 m/s^2 = 40.4 s
Now, let's find the maximum height reached by the javelin:
height = distance / sin(angle of projection) = 400 ft / sin(30 degrees) = 567.8 ft
Since the javelin reaches its maximum height after 40.4 seconds, the distance traveled during this time is:
distance = height x time = 567.8 ft x 40.4 s = 22,672 ft
Now, let's subtract the distance traveled before reaching the maximum height to find the additional throwing distance provided by the gemstone:
additional distance = total distance - distance traveled before maximum height = 22,672 ft - 567.8 ft = 17,104 ft
So, if Polly stands at a distance of 17,104 ft from the dragon while holding the sapphire gemstone, she can hit the dragon with the gold javelin."

Response:  A bag of chips contains 250 calories per serving, so if the bag weighs 300g and there are 5 servings in total, then each serving contains 250/5 = 50 calories. To calculate how many grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target of 2000 and the fact that you've already consumed 1800 calories, divide the remaining calories (2000 - 1800) by the number of calories in one serving of chips (50). This gives you approximately 40 grams of chips.

Maximum number of boxes = Total weight limit - Weight of truck and driver
= 5000 pounds - (3755 pounds)
= 1245 pounds

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 1245 pounds or approximately 568 boxes."

"Response:  Jim's total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 160 hours.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Jim watches TV for 2 hours per session.
* He reads for half as long as he watches TV.
* He does this 3 times a week.

Step 2: Determine how often Jim performs each activity in one week.

* He watches TV 3 times a week. (So, he watches TV 3 x 2 = 6 hours per week.)
* He reads for half as long as he watches TV. (So, he reads for half of 6 hours = 3 hours per week.)

Step 3: Find out how many weeks there are in 4 weeks.

* There are 4 weeks in 4 times.

Step 4: Calculate Jim's total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

* Total time spent on TV = 6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours.
* Total time spent on reading = 3 hours/week x 4 weeks = 12 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 24 + 12 = 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."

"Response:  Let's use the information given to us:

* The number of diamonds is 175.
* The number of rubies is 35 less than the number of diamonds.
* The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.

From these statements, we can deduce that the total number of gems in the chest is equal to the sum of the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. So, let's calculate each of these values separately:

Number of diamonds = 175
Number of rubies = 175 - 35 = 140
Number of emeralds = 2 × 140 = 280
Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
= 175 + 140 + 280
= 695

Therefore, there were 695 gems in the treasure chest."

"Response: 20

Let's break this down step by step:

1. There are 60 letters needing stamps initially.
2. Jennie puts stamps on one-third of these letters, which means she stamps 20 letters (since one-third of 60 is 20).
3. Now, there are 40 letters left that need stamps (60 - 20 = 40).
4. Of these 40 letters, 30 have already been stamped by Jennie (since there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters).
5. Therefore, there were originally 70 letters in the pile of letters needing stamps (40 + 30 = 70).

So, the answer is 70."

Response:  To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we need to subtract the distance between the two houses (2 miles) from the time it takes for the faster person to travel that distance. Since Steve bikes at a rate of 440 feet per minute, it will take him 2/440 = 1/220 minutes to cover 2 miles. Therefore, if Steve arrives first, the winner will arrive at their house 220 - 2 = 218 minutes after the start of the race.
"Response:  $10.75

Explanation:
The total number of tires inflated was 9 (5 bicycles x 2 tires each + 3 tricycles x 3 tires each + 1 unicycle). Since each tire cost $0.25 to inflate, Shawnda made a total of $2.25 from inflating those tires ($0.25 x 9 tires). Additionally, since there were 5 people who only needed one tire inflated, they paid $1.25 in total ($0.25 per tire x 5 tires). Therefore, Shawnda made a total of $10.75 that day ($2.25 + $1.25)."
Response:  $6
"Response: 140

Explanation:
Let's break this problem into smaller parts to solve it step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 French fries before the seagull stole the pack. So, there were 14 - 1 = 13 French fries left in the pack.
2. The seagull ate half of the remaining 13 French fries, which is 6 (since he ate 6/2 = 3 French fries).
3. Three pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 French fries.
4. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining 9 French fries, which is 5 (since he ate 5/2 = 2.5 French fries).
5. Ants carried off the last French fry, leaving 5 French fries in the pack.

So, when Dave bought the pack of French fries, there were 140 French fries in it (14 + 6 + 9 + 5 = 140)."

"Response:  To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo over that period. Let's do this step-by-step:

* For the first month, each type of ape needs a certain number of bananas:
	+ Gorillas: 200 bananas
	+ Monkeys:  200 bananas
	+ Baboons:  100 bananas
* Total number of bananas needed for the first month = (200 + 200 + 100) = 500 bananas
* Since there are two months in total, we multiply the number of bananas needed for the first month by 2 to get the total number of bananas needed for both months: 500 x 2 = 1000 bananas

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1000 bananas to last for 2 months."

"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* The total number of toys is 8 (5 red cars + 3 action figures + 1 doll).
* The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the doll costs $15 ($5 x 3 = $15).
* One red car costs $4, so the total value of 5 red cars is $20 ($4 x 5 = $20).
* Therefore, the total value of all toys is $35 ($15 + $20 = $35).

So, if an action figure costs $5, then the total value of all toys is $35 / 5 = $7."
"Response: 270$

Jackie is considering two options for doing her taxes:

Option 1: Doing them herself
Pros:
•	Saves time (3 fewer hours of freelance work)
Cons:
•	Loses $35/hour in missed income due to reduced productivity while doing taxes

Option 2: Hiring an accountant
Pros:
•	More free time (no need to spend time on taxes)
Cons:
•	Additional cost ($90)
To determine which option is better for Jackie, we need to calculate the total cost and benefit of each option.

For Option 1 (doing taxes herself):
Total Cost = $35 x 3 hours = $105
Total Benefit = $35 x 3 hours = $105

For Option 2 (hiring an accountant):
Total Cost = $90
Total Benefit = $105 - $90 = $15

Since the total benefit of hiring an accountant is higher than the total cost, it makes sense for Jackie to hire an accountant. Therefore, the answer is $15."

"Response:  Seth'un doğum yılı 2 kez daha fazla olan Brooke için, 2 yıllık farkındayımızın sonucunda Seth'ün doğum yılına göre örnekleyen ifadeyi kullanarak cevabı bulabilirsiniz.

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Write down the given information:
Brooke's age = x
Seth's age = 2x
In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28
2. Use the first equation to find out how old Brooke is:
Brooke's age = x
Seth's age = 2x
So, Brooke's age = x - 2x = -1
3. Now use the second equation to find out how old Seth is:
Seth's age = 2x
Now we know that Brooke's age is -1, so Seth's age can be found by adding Brooke's age to itself:
Seth's age = 2x = 2(-1) + 1 = 3
4. Therefore, Seth is 3 years older than Brooke. So, Seth's age is 3."

Response:  To solve this problem we need to find out how long it takes for each member of the slower team to complete their 400 meter leg. Since each runner on the slower team runs at a different pace, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. We know that the distance of each leg is 400 meters, so we just need to find out the speed of each runner. Let's assume that the times for each runner are as follows: Runner 1 - 60 seconds Runner 2 - 57 seconds Runner 3 - 54 seconds Runner 4 - 51 seconds Now we can calculate the total time taken by each runner using the formula above: Runner 1 - (400m / 60s) = 6.67 minutes per runner Runner 2 - (400m / 57s) = 6.98 minutes per runner Runner 3 - (400m / 54s) = 7.14 minutes per runner Runner 4 - (400m / 51s) = 7.36 minutes per runner Now let's add up all these times to get the overall time taken by the slower team: Total time = 6.67 + 6.98 + 7.14 + 7.36 = 30.75 minutes This means that if the faster team completes their legs in exactly 55 seconds each, they would finish the race in approximately 30.75 x 4 = 123 minutes less than the slower team.

"Response: 48

Solution:
Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is x. Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is 3x.
The problem states that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, which means that each rat has received 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw received by all the rats is 3x \* 6 = 18x.
Since there are 10 cages of hamsters, each with 5 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw received by all the hamsters is 10 \* 5 = 50.
There are 20 rabbits in the pen, and each receives 20 pieces of straw, for a total of 400 pieces of straw.
Now, let's use the information we have to find out how many rats are in each cage:
We know that the total number of pieces of straw received by all the small rodents is 18x + 50 + 400 = 630.
Since there are 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is 3x / 3 = x.
So, there are 48 rats in each cage."

"Response: 27

The explanation is as follows:

On Friday morning, there were 18 pink flamingos.
On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one-third of the flamingos (i.e., 6), painted them white, and returned them to Sue's front yard. So, now there are 18 + 6 = 24 white flamingos.
On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos, so now there are 24 white flamingos and 18 pink flamingos for a total of 42 flamingos.
Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 27 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos (42 - 15 = 27)."

"Response: 20 gal (small pool)

The big pool started with 160 gallons of water and lost 80 gallons in 4 minutes due to leaks. So, after 4 minutes, the big pool had 80 gallons of water left. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool initially, the small pool must have had 80 / 2 = 40 gallons of water initially. Therefore, the small pool currently has 40 + 20 = 60 gallons of water."
Response:  Lori's total earnings from her part-time job are $8.00 per hour x 40 hours = $320.00. To find out how many hours she needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we divide the cost of the items by her total earnings: $320.00 / $352.00 = 0.91 or approximately 1 hour. So, Lori would need to work for about 1 hour to be able to afford the shoes and belt.
"Response:  Janet'nin kaldırımının farklı yöntemleri içerir. Bu nokta, Janet'nin kaldırımının nasıl olduğunu göstermek için kullandığı formula ve bu formula ile Janet'nin kaldırımının ne kadar olduğunu gösterir.

Formula:
Kaldırım = (Borç + Yükseliş) / (1 + Yükseliş%) x (1 - Yükseliş%)

Where:
- Borç is the original loan amount ($2000 in this case).
- Yükseliş is the additional percentage that Janet agreed to pay as interest (10% in this case).
- 1+Yükseliş% represents the total number of payments made so far (including the initial payment), which is equal to 12 months in this case.
- 1-Yükseliş% represents the number of payments left to make after the initial payment (also 12 months in this case).

Using the formula above, we can calculate Janet's remaining balance after each payment:

Payment #1:
Kaldırım = ($2000 + $200) / (1 + 0.10) x (1 - 0.10) = $1800

Janet has paid $200 towards the principal and $200 towards the interest, leaving her with a remaining balance of $1800.

Payment #2:
Kaldırım = $1800 x (1 + 0.10) = $1980

After the second payment, Janet has paid another $200 towards the principal and $200 towards the interest, leaving her with a remaining balance of $1980.

Continuing this process, you can use the formula to calculate Janet's remaining balance after each of the next 11 payments. By the end of the 12th payment, Jan"

"Response: 267

Solution:
Let's first find the total number of students who left the building.

From the problem statement, we know that 30% of the students (300) went out through exit A. So, the remaining students are 700.

Now, let's find the proportion of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, the number of students who went out through exit B is 3/5 × 700 = 490.

So, the total number of students who left the building through all three exits is 300 + 490 = 790.

Finally, to find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can subtract the number of students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students who left the building: 790 - 300 - 490 = 260.

Therefore, 267 students went out through exit C."

"Response:  Mike'ın hafta boyunca yazdığı saat kaynaklıkını bulmak için, onun 5 adamından biriyle ilgili birlikte olduğu iddia etmek için kullandığı formula ve sonucunuzu gösterir misiniz?

Answer:
To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and divide it by the time it takes him to write one page.

Let's assume that Mike writes 10 pages per week (since he can write a page every 6 minutes). Therefore, the total number of pages he writes in a week is:

10 pages/week x 7 days/week = 70 pages/week

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Mike to write one page:

Time to write one page = Total time spent writing / Number of pages written
= 60 minutes/day x 7 days/week = 420 minutes/week

Finally, we can calculate the total hours Mike spends writing per week:

Total hours writing per week = Time to write one page x Number of pages written
= 420 minutes/week x 70 pages/week = 29,400 minutes/week
= 480 hours/week

Therefore, Mike spends approximately 480 hours writing a week."

Response:  Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries.
Response:  Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x. Then, the number of fish in the second aquarium is twice that value, so it is 2x. Since the total number of fish in both aquariums is equal to the sum of the number of snails in both aquariums, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 4 + 32. Simplifying this equation gives us: 5x = 36. Dividing both sides by 5 gives us: x = 7. So, there are 7 fish in the first aquarium and 14 fish in the second aquarium.

Response:  On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, if her sister ate x cookies on Monday, Sue ate 4x cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2(4x) = 8x cookies. Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, we can find out the total number of cookies eaten by both girls together as follows: Total cookies eaten by girl A = 5 + 13 = 18 Total cookies eaten by girl B = 8x - (x/2) = 8x - 9x = 7x Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister: Calories consumed by girl A = Number of cookies eaten x Calories per cookie = 18 x 200 = 3600 Calories consumed by girl B = 7x x 200 = 1400 Therefore, Sue consumed 2200 more calories than her sister.
