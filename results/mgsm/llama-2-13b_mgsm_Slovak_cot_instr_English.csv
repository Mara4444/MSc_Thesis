16 x 3 = 48 eggs per day.  Next, let's calculate how much money she makes from selling fresh eggs at market:  
48 x $2 = $96 per day.  So, Janetiny earns $96 per day selling her fresh eggs at market."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many meters of blue thread are needed for one sleeve. We know that each sleeve requires 2 screws of blue yarn and half a skein of white yarn. So let's divide the length of one sleeve (30 cm) by the width of the fabric (15 cm), which gives us 2 meters of blue yarn per sleeve. Since we need two sleeves, we will need 4 meters of blue yarn in total.  
Now, let's move on to calculating the number of stitches. We know that there are 8 stitches per meter of fabric, so we can multiply the number of meters of blue yarn by 8 to get the total number of stitches: 4 meters x 8 stitches/meter = 32 stitches.  
Finally, we can calculate the number of rows based on the number of stitches and the height of each row (which is given as 3 cm). There are 6 rows in total, so we can multiply the number of stitches by 6 to get the total number of rows: 32 stitches x 6 rows = 192 rows."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Josh paid for the house: 80,000 dollars. Then, we add the amount he invested in repairs and renovations: 50,000 dollars. So, the total cost of the house is: 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 dollars. Now, let's calculate the increase in value: 150% x 130,000 = 195,000 dollars. Therefore, Josh made a profit of: 195,000 - 130,000 = 65,000 dollars.
Response:  If James runs three times a week and each time he runs 60 meters, then he runs a total of 3 x 60 = 180 meters per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each day Wendi gives her chickens three separate portions of mixed feed containing seeds, edible insects, and vegetables to help them stay healthy. Secondly, she gives her chickens 15 shells of morning feed and 25 shells of afternoon feed. Finally, we are asked how many shells of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens at the last meal of the day if her flock consists of 20 chickens. To solve this problem, let's start with what we know about Wendi's feeding schedule: Morning Feed: 15 shells Afternoon Feed: 25 shells Total Daily Feed: 15 + 25 = 40 shells Now, since there are 20 chickens in Wendi's flock, we can calculate how much feed each chicken gets per day as follows: Total Daily Feed / Number of Chickens = Amount of Feed Per Chicken 40 shells / 20 chickens = 2 shells per chicken Therefore, Wendi needs to provide 2 x 20 = 40 shells of feed for her chickens at the last meal of the day.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Kylar would pay for each pair of glasses if he buys them individually. If the first pair costs $5 and every second pair costs 60% of that price, then the cost of each subsequent pair can be calculated as follows:  
$5 x (1 - 0.6) = $5 x 0.4 = $2  
So, the cost of each pair after the first one is $2. Now, let's calculate how much Kylar needs to pay in total for 16 pairs of glasses:  
Total cost = Number of pairs x Cost per pair  
= 16 x $2  
= $32  
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $32 for 16 pairs of glasses."
Response:  First, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So if Charleston has x sheep, then Toulouse has 2x sheep.  Next, we know that Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So if Seattle has y sheep, then Charleston has 4y sheep.  Finally, we are told that Seattle has 20 sheep.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on these relationships:  2x + 4y =?  To find out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we need to solve this equation for all three cities.  Here is one way to do it:  Start with the first equation:  2x + 4y = 2(2x) + 4(y) = 4x + 8y  Now substitute the value of x from the second equation into the first equation:  4x + 8y = 4(4y) + 8y = 16y + 32y = 52y  Therefore, Toulouse has 52 sheep, Charleston has 52 \* 4 = 208 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.  Together, they have 52 + 208 + 20 = 270 sheep.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute. Secondly, we are given that Windows needs to restart for installing updates, which takes 20 minutes. So, after the restart, Carla has to start downloading from scratch. Therefore, the total time taken for downloading the file will be: Total Time = (2 GB / min) x (Number of Minutes + 20 min) Number of Minutes = (Total Time - 20 min) / (2 GB / min) Substituting the values, we get: Total Time = (2 GB / min) x (60 min + 20 min) = (2 GB / min) x 80 min = 160 min or 2 hours and 40 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that John drives at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour (mph) for three hours (h). So, he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 60 mph x 3 h = 180 miles During the next two hours, John drives at a slower speed of 30 mph. Since he cannot drive at this lower speed for the entire two hours, let's assume he spends the first hour driving at 30 mph and the second hour driving at his original speed of 60 mph. Total distance covered during these two hours is: Distance = Speed x Time + Speed x Time Distance = 30 mph x 1 h + 60 mph x 1 h Distance = 30 mph x 1 h + 60 mph x 1 h Distance = 30 miles + 60 miles Distance = 90 miles Therefore, the total distance John travels in four hours is: Total Distance = Distance + Distance Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles Total Distance = 270 miles So, after four hours, John is 270 miles away from home.
Response:  First, we know that Eliza works for 40 hours per week at $10 per hour, so her weekly salary is: Weekly Salary = Number of Hours x Rate Per Hour Weekly Salary = 40 x $10 Weekly Salary = $400 Now, we know that Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, so she worked extra hours beyond her regular 40 hours. We can calculate the amount she earned for those extra hours as follows: Extra Earnings = Number of Extra Hours x Rate Per Hour Extra Earnings = (45 - 40) x $10 Extra Earnings = 5 x $10 Extra Earnings = $50 Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are: Total Earnings = Weekly Salary + Extra Earnings Total Earnings = $400 + $50 Total Earnings = $450
Response:  First month: 60 downloads Second month: 3 times higher than first month = 180 downloads Third month: 30% less than second month = 126 downloads Total number of downloads in three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 466
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much did Toula spend on each type of pastry. For that we divide the price per unit (in this case dollars) by the number of units she bought.  
For the big cookies: $68 / 3 = $22.67 per tuct 
For the mini cupcakes: $80 / 2 = $40 per tuct 
For the mini cheesecakes: $55 / 6 = $9.17 per tuct  
Now let's add up all the costs: $22.67 + $40 + $9.17 = $62.84  
Therefore, Toula spent in total $62.84."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend on water and fertilizer for the lemon tree each year.  $ 3 per year. Now let's calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to break even on his investment in the lemon tree. To do this, we need to divide the cost of the tree ($ 90) by the annual revenue from selling lemons ($ 7 x 1.5 = $ 10.5). This gives us:  $$ \frac {90} {10.5} = 8.62 $$ So it will take Carlos approximately 8.62 years to break even on his investment in the lemon tree.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Melanie had 3/4 of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, which is equal to 3 x 4 = 12 vacuum cleaners.  Secondly, she gave 2/3 of the remaining vacuum cleaners to the red house, which is equal to 2 x 4 = 8 vacuum cleaners.  Finally, she kept half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, which is equal to 6 vacuum cleaners.  Therefore, Melanie had 12 + 8 + 6 = 26 vacuum cleaners at the beginning.
Response:  Firstly, we know that out of 20 students, 20% were enrolled in contemporary dance, which is equal to 4 students (20 x 20%). Secondly, we know that 25% of the remaining students were enrolled in jazz dance, which is equal to 5 students (80 x 25%). Finally, we know that the rest of the students were enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students were enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dances from the total number of students. So, if we subtract 4 + 5 = 9 students from 20, we get: 11 students were enrolled in hip-hop dance. Therefore, approximately 55% of the total number of students were enrolled in hip-hop dance (11/20 x 100%).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the expected growth rate of each market for the given month.  For the jewelry market, the growth rate is 2.5%, and for the electronics market, it's 1.2%. Next, we need to determine the current value of each investment option.  The cost of the jewelry set is $5,000, while the cost of the electronic device is $8,000. Now, let's calculate the potential profit at the end of the month for each option.  For the jewelry option, we can use the formula: Potential Profit = (Current Value x Growth Rate) / 100. Substituting the values, we get: Potential Profit = ($5,000 x 2.5%) / 100 = $125. For the electronics option, we can use the same formula: Potential Profit = ($8,000 x 1.2%) / 100 = $96. Now, we need to compare these two options based on their potential profits. Since the jewelry option has a higher potential profit of $125, it would be the better choice for the merchant if they want to maximize their profit at the end of the month.
"Response:  First day, both trains travel west for 80 miles. Second day, they travel north for an unknown distance (150 miles). To find out how far each train traveled in two days, we need to add their distances from the first and second days.  
Day 1 (west): Train A travels 80 miles, while Train B travels 80 miles as well. Day 2 (north): Both trains travel the same distance (150 miles), so Train A travels 150 + 80 = 230 miles, and Train B travels 150 + 80 = 230 miles as well. Therefore, Train A travels a total of 230 miles over two days, and Train B also travels 230 miles."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Jill works as an instructor per week:  
35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year (as an instructor) Next, let's calculate how much she earns per hour as an instructor:  
$20/hour x 1750 hours/year = $35,000/year (as an instructor) Now, let's calculate how many hours Jill works as a trainer per week:  
15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year (as a trainer) And finally, let's calculate how much she earns per hour as a trainer:  
$30/hour x 750 hours/year = $22,500/year (as a trainer) So, Jill's total annual salary is:  
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500/year."
Response:  If Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning for 4 weeks (28 days), then she uses 3 x 28 = 84 eggs per month.
"Response:  First, we know that Marissa travels at a speed of 4 miles per hour for the first four miles. This means she covers the first four miles in one hour.  Next, we know that it takes her another hour to cover the remaining two miles. So, the total time taken is 2 hours.  Now, let's calculate the average speed required to cover the entire distance of 12 miles. We can do this by dividing the total distance by the total time taken:  
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time Taken Average Speed = 12 miles / 2 hours Average Speed = 6 miles/hour Therefore, Marissa needs to maintain an average speed of 6 miles per hour to cover the entire distance of 12 miles in 2 hours."
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice that is made up of two-thirds water and one-third orange juice. If we add this to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is made up of five parts water, what will be the ratio of water to juice in the final mixture?  First, let's calculate how much orange juice we need to add to 15 liters of pineapple juice to make a total volume of 24 liters.  To do this, we can divide 15 liters (the amount of pineapple juice) by 3 (the number of parts water in the orange juice): 15 / 3 = 5  So, we need to add 5 liters of orange juice to 15 liters of pineapple juice. Now, let's find out how much water is left over after adding the orange juice. To do this, we can subtract the amount of orange juice from the total volume of the final mixture: 24 - 5 = 19  Therefore, there are 19 liters of water left over after adding the orange juice.
Response:  We know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond must be 31 + 6 = 37 years old.  Now we are given that Raymond has a son who is 23 years old. So, Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 37 - 23 = 14 years old. Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.
Response:  We know that Billy has 8 customers and his first three customers bought one DVD each. So, he sold 3 DVDs to his first three customers. His next two customers bought two DVDs each, so he sold 2 x 2 = 4 more DVDs. Finally, his last three customers did not buy any DVDs, so he did not sell any to them. In total, Billy sold 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs today.
Response:  If the candle shrinks by 2 cm per hour, then it will shrink by 10 cm (2 x 5) during the first five hours of burning.
Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50, and it was discounted by 25%. So we can start with the original price of the book.  The formula to find the original price is: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)  In this case, the discounted price is $19.50, and the discount percentage is 25%, so we can plug in these values to get: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)  Simplifying, we get: Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75  Can you simplify this fraction and tell me what the original price of the book was?
Response:  First, we know that Marie paid $50 in total.  Second, she bought one loaf of bread for $12, five cans of milk for $3, four apples for $1.50, and some pizza crusts (let's call it x). Third, we know that each pizza crust costs $8.50. So, if Marie bought x pizza crusts, she would have paid $8.50x dollars. Now, let's add up all the amounts Marie spent: $12 + $3 + $1.50 + $8.50x = $50. Solving for x, we get x = 6. Therefore, Marie bought six pizza crusts.

"Response:  We know that Henry stopped twice during his 60-mile bike ride. His first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the ride. To find out how many miles he traveled between the two stops, we can subtract the distance from the first stop from the total distance of the ride:  
60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles So, Henry traveled 40 miles between his first and second stops."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one pair of high-heeled shoes is $33 and the other pair is twice as much, so the price of the second pair is $33 x 2 = $66.  Now, let's calculate the total cost of both pairs of shoes: $33 + $66 = $99.  Therefore, the total cost of all four shoes (two pairs) is $99.
"Response:  First, we know that Vek Darrella is 162 years old now (given in the problem statement).  Second, we know that Allen is 7 years younger than Darrella.  So, if we subtract 7 from 162, we get the age of Allen:  
162 - 7 =?  Answer:  155"
Response:  First, we know that the first friend says there are 80 in the jar. Second, the second friend says there are more than half of the first friend's number, so there must be at least 80/2 = 40. Third, the third friend says there is 25% more than the first friend's number, so there must be at least 80 + (25/100) \* 80 = 80 + 20 = 100. Therefore, the approximate estimate of the number of jelly beans in the jar is 100.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each dog needs 0.5 hours of care and attention daily. Secondly, there are 10 dogs in total. Therefore, the total amount of time needed for caring for all the dogs is:  
Time required = Number of dogs x Time per dog  Time required = 10 x 0.5 = 5 hours per day  Since the question asks about the number of hours spent on pet-sitting per week, we need to multiply the daily time requirement by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):  Time required per week = Time required per day x Number of days per week  Time required per week = 5 x 7 = 35 hours per week"
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So if we let S be the number of silver coins, then Gretchen has 30 + S gold coins. Since all coins have a value of 1, the total value of Gretchen's coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  30 + S = 110... 2S = 80... S = 40 Now we know that Gretchen has 40 silver coins. So she has a total of 30 + 40 = 70 coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has half as many diamonds as Raymond and Siobhan has twice as many diamonds as Aaron. So if Aaron has x diamonds, Siobhan will have 2x diamonds.  Now we know that Raymond has 40 diamonds in total, so Aaron has 40/2 = 20 diamonds. Therefore, Siobhan has 20 x 2 = 40 diamonds.
Response:  First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. So, if we multiply 4 by 20 (minutes), we get:  4 x 20 = 80 Now, we know that in the next 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more than he did in the first 20 minutes. So, to find out how many points he scored in the last 20 minutes, we can use the following formula:   New score = Old score + (Old score x Percentage increase)   In this case, the old score is 80, and the percentage increase is 25%. So, we can calculate the new score as follows:   New score = 80 + (80 x 25%)   New score = 80 + 20   New score = 100 Therefore, Mike scored a total of 100 points during the entire 40-minute game.
Response:  If Terry eats two yogurts per day and each yogurt costs $5, then he spends $10 per day on yogurts.  Since there are 30 days in a month, Terry will spend $10 x 30 = $300 on yogurts for the month.
Response:  First, we know that John has 13 Lego sets and he is going to sell each one for $15. So, if he sells all of them, he will have $15 x 13 = $195. But then he says he wants to buy 8 video games for $20 each, so he will spend $20 x 8 = $160. That means he will be left with $195 - $160 = $35. Therefore, John has 35 Lego sets left after selling all of them and buying the video games.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours John spends skiing each week.  There are 7 days in a week and he skis for 3 days, so that's 21 hours per week (3 x 7). Now let's look at each day separately:  On the first day, John skis for 3 hours. On the second day, he skis for half of 3 hours, which is 1.5 hours. And on the third day, he also skis for 1.5 hours. So, in total, John spends 21 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 24 hours per week skiing. To find out his speed, we need to know the distance he covers during these 24 hours. The problem states that he beelines 100 km per week. Therefore, John's speed can be calculated as follows: Speed = Distance / Time = 100 km / 24 h = 4.17 km/h
Response:  First, we know that Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, so if she walks at a speed of x miles per hour, she can run at a speed of 4x miles per hour.  Now, we are given that Dana can jump only half as fast as she can run, so if she runs at a speed of 4x miles per hour, she can jump at a speed of 2x miles per hour.  We also know that Dana can cover 3 miles in one hour while running, so her running speed is 3 miles/hour.  Therefore, her jumping speed is 2x = 2 \* 3 = 6 miles per hour.  Now, we need to find out how far Dana can jump in six hours.  Since she jumps for two-thirds of the time and walks for one-third of the time, we can calculate her total distance traveled as follows:  Total distance = (2/3) \* 6 miles/hour \* 6 hours + (1/3) \* 3 miles/hour \* 6 hours  Total distance = 2 \* 6 + 1 \* 6  Total distance = 12 + 6  Total distance = 18 miles  So, Dana can jump 18 miles in six hours.
Response:  We know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone, so if Suzy's iPhone is one year old, then Ben's iPhone is two years old.  Now we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Suzy's iPhone, so if Suzy's iPhone is one year old, then Brandon's iPhone is four years old.  Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is four years old.
Response:  First, we need to determine how far away from the dragon Polly can throw her golden arrow when she holds the sapphire gemstone. According to the text, the distance is 400 steps (stôp). Now, let's consider the range of the dragon's flames. The text states that the dragon breathes fire up to 1000 steps (vzdialenosť) away. So, if Polly stands at a distance of 400 steps from the dragon and throws her golden arrow, it will not reach the dragon because the dragon's flames have a longer range than the arrow's flight path. However, when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the golden arrow three times farther than she could without the gemstone. Therefore, with the gemstone, Polly can stand at a distance of 3 x 400 = 1200 steps from the dragon and still hit it with her golden arrow.
Response:  First, we know that there were 5 apple cakes and each was cut into 8 pieces. So, in total, there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple cake.  Next, we know that Babica Jonesova put 5 apple cakes on the table for her guests to serve themselves. So, if each guest took an equal number of pieces from each cake, then they would have taken 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total.  Finally, we are told that after all the guests had finished eating, there were 14 remaining pieces of apple cake left over. Therefore, we can subtract 14 from 40 to find out how many pieces each guest took: 40 - 14 = 26.  So, each guest took approximately 26 pieces of apple cake.
"Response:  First, we know that one serving of chips has 250 calories and the person wants to consume 2000 calories in total for the day.  If they have already consumed 1800 calories, then they need to calculate how many more calories they can eat.  To do this, we subtract the number of calories they have already eaten (1800) from their daily goal (2000), which gives us:  

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left to eat.  Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, the person could eat:  

200 / 250 = 4 servings or 4 x 250 = 1000 calories."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Charlie will make if he sells all 20 candles at $2 each.  To do this, we multiply the number of candles (20) by the price per candle ($2):  
Charlie's total revenue = 20 x $2 = $40  Next, we need to subtract the cost of the wax and the keys from his total revenue to find out his net profit. The cost of one kilogram of wax and two keys is $10:  
Charlie's net profit = $40 - $10 = $30  So, Charlie will have a net profit of $30 if he sells all 20 candles for $2 each."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Meredith spent writing articles each day.  For Monday, she wrote 5 articles and it took her 4 hours to research and write each article, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing articles that day.  On Tuesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Monday (i.e., 2 x 5 = 10 articles), but since each article still takes her 4 hours to write, she spent 10 x 4 = 40 hours writing articles that day.  On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday (i.e., 2 x 10 = 20 articles), so she spent 20 x 4 = 80 hours writing articles that day.  Therefore, in total, Meredith spent 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 hours writing articles over the three days.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Candice had 80 Post-its in total and she used them to label each of the 220 different types of coffee cups at work. So, if she used all 80 Post-its, there must have been 80/220 = 1/4 (or 25%) of the Post-its left over after she finished labeling all the cups.  Now, let's consider the number of Post-its in the pack that Candice bought. Since she bought a pack of Post-its, it means that there were some Post-its already inside the pack before she started using them. Therefore, the number of Post-its in the pack can be calculated as follows:  
Number of Post-its in the pack = Total number of Post-its used x Number of cups labeled per Post-it  
= 80 x 220 / 4  
= 23 Post-its  
So, there were 23 Post-its in the pack that Candice bought."
Response:  Firstly, we know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ones. So if he bought x blue ties, he bought 2x red ties. Secondly, we know that each red tie costs 50% more than each blue tie. So the cost of one red tie is 1.5 times the cost of one blue tie (i.e., $40 x 1.5 = $60). Finally, we know that John paid $200 for all the blue ties and $40 for each blue tie. Therefore, to find out how much John paid for all the ties, we can multiply the number of blue ties by the cost per blue tie plus the number of red ties by the cost per red tie: Total Cost = Number of Blue Ties x Cost per Blue Tie + Number of Red Ties x Cost per Red Tie Total Cost = x x 40 + 2x x 60 Total Cost = 40x + 120x Total Cost = 520x Since there are no other information given in the problem, this is our final answer.
Response:  We know that Tracy used a piece of wire mesh with a length of 4 feet (48 inches) to support her morning glories in the garden. The wire mesh was cut into pieces 15 cm long. To find out how many pieces she got, we can divide the total length of the wire mesh by the length of each piece:  48 inches / 15 cm = 32 pieces
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is:  
15 x 8 = 120  Next, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that only 3/4 of the units are inhabited. Therefore, the number of unoccupied units can be calculated as follows:  
120 - (3/4) x 120 = 120 - 90 = 30  So, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many eggs Lloyd sells in one week (7 days).  If his chickens produce 252 eggs per day and there are 7 days in a week, then:  
Number of eggs sold in one week = Number of eggs produced per day x Number of days in a week  
= 252 eggs/day x 7 days/week  
= 1,764 eggs/week Now that we know how many eggs Lloyd sells in one week, we can calculate how much money he earns from selling those eggs. We know that each dozen eggs costs $2, so:  
Total revenue from eggs per week = Number of eggs sold per week x Price per dozen eggs  
= 1,764 eggs/week x $2/dozen  
= $3,528 per week Therefore, Lloyd earns $3,528 per week from selling eggs."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how long it takes for the ship to travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour (mph). We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 10 miles / 10 mph Time = 1 hour Next, we need to calculate how long it takes for the ship to return at a speed of 6 mph. We can use the same formula as before: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 10 miles / 6 mph Time = 1.67 hours (or approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes) Now, let's add up the total time it took for the ship to make both trips: Total Time = Time to travel + Time to return Total Time = 1 hour + 1.67 hours Total Time = 2.67 hours (or approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes) So, it would take the ship approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes to make both trips.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much weight is in each category:  Komiksy (comics) - 15 x 1 kg = 15 kg Hračky (toys) - 15 x 1 kg = 15 kg Total weight of both categories - 15 + 15 = 30 kg Now, let's subtract the weight of the comics from the total weight:  30 kg - 15 kg = 15 kg So, we need to remove 15 kg of toys to balance the bag.
"Response:  First, we know that for each tire of the truck, the mechanic charges $60 and for each car tire, he charges $40. So if he repaired 6 tires of the truck and 4 tires of the car, his total earnings would be:  

$60 x 6 = $360 (for truck tires) + $40 x 4 = $160 (for car tires) = $520

Now, let's consider the second part of the problem. On Friday, the mechanic made 12 attempts to repair tires but did not succeed in any of them. Since he did not charge for any unsuccessful attempts, his earnings for the day will only be from the successful repairs. If he successfully repaired 6 tires of the truck and 4 tires of the car, his total earnings for the day would be:  

$60 x 6 = $360 (for truck tires) + $40 x 4 = $160 (for car tires) = $520

So, the mechanic earned more on Thursday than on Friday. His total earnings for both days are:  

$520 + $520 = $1040"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Patchy had three times as many adopted kittens as Trixie. So if Trixie had 12 adopted kittens, then Patchy would have had 3 x 12 = 36 adopted kittens.  Now, let's add up all the adopted kittens of both Patchy and Trixie. We get:  
36 (Patchy) + 12 (Trixie) = 48  Therefore, the total number of adopted kittens in the Doubtfire family is 48."
Response:  First, Jean has 30 lizards and he gives away 2 lizards to someone else. So now Jean has 28 lizards left. Now, Jean wants to put two of his remaining lizards into one basket. This means that he needs to find two baskets to place them in. Since each basket can hold only one lizard, Jean will need two baskets to carry two lizards. Therefore, Jean can fill two baskets with two lizards each, for a total of four lizards placed in two baskets.
"Response:  First, we know that Peter has $42 for the week and he needs to buy a ticket and popcorn each time he goes to the movies.  So, if he wants to go to the movies once, he will spend $7 + $7 = $14.  If he wants to go twice, he will spend $14 + $14 = $28.  And so on...  We can set up an equation based on this information:  
Let P be the number of times Peter goes to the movies. Then, the total amount spent is:  
T = 7P + 7(P - 1)... (1) where the last term represents the cost of two tickets and one bag of popcorn. Now, we know that Peter has $42 for the week, so we can set up another equation:  
42 = T + 2(7P)... (2) where the second term represents the cost of two tickets and two bags of popcorn. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:  
42 = 7P + 14P - 14 + 2(7P)... (3) Simplifying and solving for P, we get:  
42 = 9P + 28... (4) Subtracting 28 from both sides gives us:  
14 = 9P... (5) Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:  
1 = P... (6) Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 1 time with his $42."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total weight of one crate (5 kg x 12 = 60 kg). Now, let's calculate the maximum number of crates that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the limit of 5000 kg:  
Maximum weight of the truck and empty trailer = 3755 kg  
Total weight of one crate = 60 kg  
Therefore, the maximum number of crates that can be loaded onto the truck is:  
Maximum number of crates = Total weight of truck and trailer / Weight of one crate  
= 3755 kg / 60 kg  
= 62.5 (rounded up to the nearest whole number)  
So, the maximum number of crates that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the limit of 5000 kg is 62 crates."
"Response:  First, we know that Stephen paid $40 for his groceries online.  Second, he was charged an additional 25% service fee, which is $10 (25% of $40). Third, there was a delivery charge of $3. Finally, Stephen added $4 in tips, so the total amount Stephen paid was:  
$40 + $10 + $3 + $4 = $67"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of apples in each group.  There are 6 groups with 20 apples per group, so the total number of apples in all groups is:  
20 x 6 = 120 apples  
Now, let's add up the total number of apples from all groups:  
120 + 67 = 187 apples  
Therefore, there are 187 apples in total."
Response:  First, we know that there are 25 oranges in total.  Of those, 1 is bad and 20% (2 x 25 = 5) are not ripe yet. So, we subtract 1 + 5 from 25 to get the number of good oranges:  25 - 1 - 5 = 19 Good oranges!
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Janet paid for the materials and construction of the jewelry box. We know that she paid $500 for the materials and $800 for the craftsmanship, so in total, she paid:  
$500 + $800 = $1300  Next, we need to calculate how much insurance premium Janet paid. We know that she paid 10% of the total cost, so if we multiply $1300 by 10%, we get:  
$1300 x 0.10 = $130 So, Janet paid a total of $1430 ($1300 + $130) for her daughter's jewelry box."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that AK will receive over 40 years if she works for the same company and receives an annual salary of $50,000.  To do this, we can multiply the number of years she works (40) by her annual salary ($50,000): Total Amount = Number of Years x Annual Salary Total Amount = 40 x $50,000 Total Amount = $2,000,000 Next, we know that after 20 years, AK will receive 5% of her total amount as a retirement benefit. So, we need to calculate what 5% of $2,000,000 is: Retirement Benefit = Total Amount x Percentage Retirement Benefit = $2,000,000 x 5% Retirement Benefit = $100,000 Finally, we need to subtract the retirement benefit from the total amount to find out how much AK will have received in 30 years: Total Received = Total Amount - Retirement Benefit Total Received = $2,000,000 - $100,000 Total Received = $1,900,000 Therefore, if AK works for the same company for 40 years, earns an annual salary of $50,000, and receives a 5% retirement benefit after 20 years, she will have received a total of $1,900,000 over 30 years.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount paid for the first half of the year.  If the subscription fee is $140 per month and there are six months in the first half of the year (January to June), then the total amount paid for the first half of the year would be:  6 x $140 = $840. Next, we need to calculate the discount applied to the second half of the year. Since the discount is 10%, we can subtract 10% of $840 from the original price to get the discounted price for the second half of the year:  840 x 10% = $84 Discounted price for the second half of the year = $840 - $84 = $756 Now that we have the discounted price for the second half of the year, we can add it to the original price paid for the first half of the year to find the total amount paid for the entire year: Total amount paid for the entire year = $840 + $756 = $1,596
"Response:  First, we know that Sophia has already driven 160 kilometers since her last fill-up and needs to add 4 gallons of gasoline to her tank to refill it completely.  Second, we know that her car's fuel tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline.  So, if we subtract the amount she has already used (4 gallons) from the total capacity of her fuel tank (12 gallons), we get the remaining amount of gasoline in her tank after refilling:  
12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons  
Now, let's convert this amount into miles:  
There are approximately 30 miles per gallon of gasoline for most cars. Therefore, we can calculate how far Sophia can drive with the remaining 8 gallons of gasoline as follows:  
8 gallons x 30 miles/gallon = 240 miles  
So, Sophia can drive approximately 240 miles on one fill-up of gasoline."
"Response:  First, we know that Jim spends 2 hours watching television each day (3 times a week). So, in one week, he spends 2 x 3 = 6 hours watching TV. Now, let's consider his reading time. He reads for half of the time he watches TV, so he spends 6 hours reading per week as well. Therefore, the total amount of time Jim spends on both activities is:  
6 hours watching TV + 6 hours reading = 12 hours/week"
Response:  There are four schools participating in the tournament. Each school has sent two teams - one team of girls and one team of boys. Therefore, there are a total of 4 x 2 = 8 teams participating in the tournament. Each team has five players, so there are a total of 8 x 5 = 40 players participating in the tournament. In addition to the players, each school has also sent a coach for each team, so there are a total of 4 x 2 = 8 coaches participating in the tournament. Therefore, all together, there are 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people participating in the tournament from all four schools.
Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds, and we can start with them.  If there were 35 rubies, then there must have been twice as many emeralds as rubies (since there are more emeralds than rubies). So, let's multiply 35 by 2 to get 70 emeralds. Now, we add up all the precious stones: 175 + 70 = 245.  Therefore, there were 245 precious stones in the chest.
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls in school and 5 students per teacher. So if we divide 60 by 5, we get: 60 / 5 = 12 teachers.
Response:  First, we know that Bailey starts with some initial amount of money (x). Then, she receives weekly payments of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information: x + (5 x 8) = 100 We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: x + 40 = 100 Subtracting 40 from both sides gives us: x = 60 Therefore, Bailey had $60 at the beginning of the 8-week period.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Judy teaches per week.  She teaches 5 hours per day x 3 days/week = 15 hours/week.  Now, let's calculate her total earnings for the week.  If she has 15 students and charges $15 per student, then her total earnings are:  15 students x $15/student = $225/week.
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, then the second recipe will have 2 x 20 = 40 instructions.  Therefore, in total, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions to prepare both meals.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Tommy will make from selling sundaes and cheesecakes.  For each sundae, he will make $3, so for 43 sundaes, he will make:  43 x $3 = $130  For each cheesecake, he will make $4, so for 23 cheesecakes, he will make:  23 x $4 = $92  Now, let's add up all the money that Tommy will make:  $130 + $92 = $222  So, Tommy will make $222 if he sells 43 sundaes and 23 cheesecakes.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount that Sheila will pay for each mobile phone.  Since she is paying $150 per unit and there are five units, her total payment for all five phones is:  
$150 x 5 = $750  Next, we need to calculate the monthly interest rate. The problem states that the interest rate is 2%, so we can calculate the monthly interest as follows:  
$750 x 2/100 = $15 per month  Now, let's calculate the total amount that Sheila will pay over three months:  
$15 x 3 = $45  So, Sheila will pay a total of $45 in monthly installments over three months."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Artie will receive for each type of flower.  For nalievky, the price is $2.74 per stem, so if he sells 12 stems, he will receive:  12 x $2.74 = $33.08  For petúnie, the price is $1.87 per stem, so if he sells 9 stems, he will receive:  9 x $1.87 = $16.83  For begónie, the price is $2.12 per stem, so if he sells 17 stems, he will receive:  17 x $2.12 = $35.54  Now, let's add up all these amounts to find out how much Artie will earn in total:  $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.54 = $85.45  Therefore, Artie will earn $85.45 if he sells 12 stems of nalievky, 9 stems of petúnie, and 17 stems of begónie.
Response:  First, we know that each level of the sand castle will have half the area as the level below it. So if the highest level is 16 meters squared, then the second-highest level will be half that size, or 8 meters squared. The third level will be half the size of the second level, and so on.  Now let's calculate the total area of all four levels:  Level 1 (highest): 16 m^2 Level 2: half of 16 = 8 m^2 Level 3: half of 8 = 4 m^2 Level 4: half of 4 = 2 m^2 Total area: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 m^2
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many packets of dog food Cecilia will use in the first 180 days. We know that she needs to feed her puppy 1 packet (110 g) per day, so for 180 days, she will use:  
180 days x 1 packet/day = 180 packets  
Now, let's calculate how many packets Cecilia will use during the rest of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days). Since she needs to feed her puppy 2 packets (220 g) per day after the first 180 days, she will use:  
185 days x 2 packets/day = 370 packets  
Therefore, in total, Cecilia will use:  
180 + 370 = 550 packets of dog food in the first year."
Response:  We know that Sarah and David have different amounts of laundry to do.  If Sarah has 4 times as much laundry as David, then we can write an equation based on this information.  Let d represent the amount of laundry David has (in liters).  Then, if Sarah has 4 times as much laundry, her amount would be 4d.  Now, we are told that Sarah does 400 liters of laundry.  So, we can set up the following equation:  4d + d = 400  Simplifying this equation, we get:  5d = 400  Dividing both sides by 5, we find that:  d = 80  Therefore, David has 80 liters of laundry.  To find out how much more laundry Sarah has than David, we subtract their amounts:  Sarah has 4 times as much laundry as David, so she has 4(80) = 320 liters of laundry.  In summary, Sarah has 320 - 80 = 240 liters more laundry than David.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one bouquet is $2.50 if bought in a pack of three. So, the cost of one bouquet individually would be $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per bouquet. Now, let's calculate the total cost of 18 bouquets at both prices:  
Price per bouquet (individual): $0.83 x 18 = $14.64  
Price per bouquet (pack of 2): $2.50 x 9 = $22.50  
Now, let's compare the two options:  
Option A: Buy 18 bouquets individually @ $0.83 each = $14.64  
Option B: Buy 9 bouquets in a pack of 2 @ $2.50 each = $22.50  
As you can see, Option A costs less than Option B. Therefore, buying 18 bouquets individually for $14.64 will save more money compared to buying them in a pack of 2 for $22.50."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the discount that the parrot offers for being a new customer. We know that the discount is 30%. So if we multiply $100 (the original price) by 0.3 (the discount percentage), we get $30 as the discount amount. Now, let's subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much the parrot wants for the training: $100 - $30 = $70. Therefore, the cost of training the dog with the parrot is $70.
Response:  We know that two girls received one-sixth of 24 liters of water, so they received: 24 x (1/6) = 4 liters of water.  Now we know that one boy received 6 liters of water, so the total amount of water left is: 24 - 4 = 20 liters.
"Response:  Firstly, Charlie bought 21 stickers from the store and received 23 as a gift for his birthday. So, he has in total:  
21 + 23 = 44 stickers.  
Next, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he is left with:  
44 - 9 = 35 stickers.  
Finally, Charlie used 28 stickers for decorating his greeting card, leaving him with:  
35 - 28 = 7 stickers.  
Therefore, Charlie has 7 stickers left."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Grace weighs 40 kg. Secondly, Alex weighs more than Grace by 2 liters. So, if we convert 2 liters to kilograms, we get:  2 liters = 2 x 1000 grams = 2000 grams Now, let's add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:  40 kg + 2000 grams =? The total weight is: 40 kg + 2000 grams = 4200 grams Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 4200 grams or 4.2 kilograms.
Response:  First, we know that each rosebush has 25 roses.  Each rose has 8 thorns. So, to find out how many thorns there are in total, we need to multiply the number of rosebushes by the number of roses per bush and then by the number of thorns per rose.  That gives us:  3 x 25 x 8 = 450 thorns.
"Response:  We know that the team played 22 matches and won 8 times more than they lost. So if we let W be the number of wins and L be the number of losses, we can write an equation based on this information:  
W + L = 22... (1) Since the team won 8 times more than they lost, we can say that W = 8L. Substituting this into equation (1), we get:  
8L + L = 22... (2) Combining like terms, we get:  
9L = 22... (3) Dividing both sides by 9, we find that:  
L = 2... (4) Now we can find the number of wins by substituting L = 2 into equation (2):  
8(2) + 2 = 22... (5) Simplifying, we get:  
16 + 2 = 22... (6) Which is true. Therefore, the team won 16 matches and lost 2 matches."
Response:  Firstly, we know that he has one sweater from each of his four vacations per year, so he has four sweaters in total. Secondly, we know that each sweater is made up of blocks from different years of his vacation, and there are 23 years in total (since he started going on vacation at age 23). Therefore, each sweater has 23 blocks. Finally, since he goes on vacation four times a year, he has four sweaters with 23 blocks each, for a total of 92 blocks.
Response:  First time it rang for 4 times (given). Second time it rang for 3 times longer than first time, so it rang for 12 - 4 = 8 times. Third time it rang for half of second time, so it rang for 8/2 = 4 times. So the total number of rings is 4 + 8 + 4 = 16.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the current salary of Sylvia after five years of service.  If the company pays each employee $600 per month and raises their salary by 10% every year, then Sylvia's current salary can be calculated as follows:  
Year 1: $600 x 1.10 = $660 per month (salary increase of $60)  
Year 2: $660 x 1.10 = $728 per month (salary increase of $68)  
Year 3: $728 x 1.10 = $804.80 per month (salary increase of $76.80)  
Year 4: $804.80 x 1.10 = $886.48 per month (salary increase of $81.68)  
Year 5: $886.48 x 1.10 = $982.72 per month (salary increase of $95.24)  
Therefore, Sylvia's current salary after five years of service is $982.72 per month."
Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 88,000 copies of her album, and it was sold 10 times more than Harald's album. So we can start with the fact that Harald sold 88,000 / 10 = 8,800 copies of his album.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many guests will actually attend the party since only 3/4 of them are expected to show up.  So, if 16 people were invited and 3/4 of them will come, then the number of attending guests is:  
16 x 0.75 = 12 guests  Now that we know how many guests will be present, we can calculate the total cost of the gifts as follows:  
Since each gift bag costs $2, and there will be 12 guests, the total cost is:  
12 x $2 = $24"
"Response:  First, we need to determine how much food each adult and child will eat.  If an adult eats 10 pounds of salad and a child eats half that amount, then each adult will eat 10/2 = 5 pounds of salad, and each child will eat 10/2 = 2.5 pounds of salad (since children eat half as much as adults).  Now, let's calculate how much salad Ted needs to bring for the entire group:  
Adults: 20 x 5 = 100 pounds of salad Children: 5 x 2.5 = 12.5 pounds of salad Total: 100 + 12.5 = 112.5 pounds of salad Therefore, Ted should bring approximately 113 pounds of salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jan has three times as many domestic animals as Marcia. So if Marcia has two domestic animals, Jan must have six (2 x 3 = 6).  Secondly, we know that Cindy has four domestic animals more than Marcia. Therefore, if Marcia has two domestic animals, Cindy must have six (2 + 4 = 6) domestic animals in total.  Finally, we can add up all the domestic animals to find out how many there are altogether: 6 + 6 = 12.  So, there are twelve domestic animals in total.
Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, if we subtract 5 from Jackson's age, we get:  Jackson's age = 10 - 5 = 5 And then, if we subtract 2 from Corey's age, we get:  Corey's age = 10 - 2 = 8 Now, we know that James is one year younger than Corey, so:  James's age = 8 - 1 = 7 Therefore, Jackson's age is 5, Corey's age is 8, and James's age is 7.
Response:  First, we know that Lee beat Gerald by 2 seconds in a 400-meter race with obstacles. So, if we let X represent Gerald's time in seconds, then Lee's time is X + 2.  We also know that Gerald improved his time by 10% after changing his diet. So, if Gerald's original time was T, his new time after improving his diet is T / 0.9.  Now, we can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:  X + 2 = (T / 0.9)... (1)  Since Lee beat Gerald by 2 seconds, we know that Lee's time is equal to Gerald's time minus 2 seconds:  X = T - 2... (2)  Substituting (2) into (1), we get:  X + 2 = (T / 0.9)  Solving for X, we get:  X = (T / 0.9) - 2  Now, we need to find out what Gerald's time T is before he improved his diet.  If Gerald beat Lee by 2 seconds and Lee took 38 seconds to complete the race, then Gerald must have taken 36 seconds to complete the race (since 2 seconds is the difference between their times).  Therefore, we can set up another equation:  T = 36... (3)  Substituting (3) into (1), we get:  X + 2 = (36 / 0.9)  Simplifying, we get:  X + 2 = 40  Therefore, Gerald's time after improving his diet is:  X = 40 - 2 = 38  So, Gerald can now complete the 400-meter race with obstacles in 38 seconds, which is the same as Lee's current time.
Response:  We know that there are 20 cats for every dog and 60 dogs in total. So, if we multiply 60 by 20, we get 1200 cats. Now, let's add the number of domesticated animals (cats + dogs) to find out how many domesticated animals there are in total. Therefore, the total number of domesticated animals is 1200 + 60 = 1260.
Response:  We know that there are 200 fifth-grade students in total, and we want to find out how many girls are not in scouting clubs. So first, let's divide the number of boys from the total number of students: Boys = (2/5) x 200 = 80  Now, let's subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to get the number of girls: Girls = 200 - 80 = 120  Therefore, there are 120 girls who are not in scouting clubs.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for two-thirds of that time. So, if we calculate two-thirds of 9 hours, it comes out to be 6 hours. Therefore, James slept for 6 hours. Now, we need to find out how many more hours did Harry sleep than James. To do this, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept. In this case, we subtract 6 hours from 9 hours, which gives us:  
Harry slept for 3 more hours than James."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each jar of pickles contains three pickles and Freda used 32 ounces of pickle juice in her last batch. Therefore, to find out how many jars she used, we can divide 32 ounces by 3 pickles per jar. So, 32 ÷ 3 = 10 jars. Thus, Freda used 10 jars of pickles in her last batch.
"Response:  First, we know that some cars pass through the first 15 minutes of traffic jam (we don't know exactly how many), then another 20 cars pass through the remaining 15 minutes of traffic jam. So, in total, there are 20 + x cars passing through the traffic jam, where x is the number of cars that passed through the first 15 minutes. Now, if originally there were 30 cars on the highway, and 5 cars were diverted from the exit to avoid the traffic jam, then the number of cars that did not diverge and passed through the traffic jam can be calculated as follows:  
x + (20 + x) = 30  Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 20 = 30  Subtracting 20 from both sides:  
2x = 10  Dividing both sides by 2:  
x = 5  Therefore, 5 cars passed through the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam."
"Response:  Firstly, Maria has 40 windows with two plants each = 80 plants in total. Secondly, she wants to give one plant from each window to her friends and family, so we need to subtract that number of plants from the total. Finally, we can calculate how many plants Maria will have left after giving them away.  
So, the calculation is as follows:  
Total number of plants = 80  
Number of plants to be given away = 40 (one plant from each window)  
Number of plants left with Maria = 80 - 40 = 40  
Therefore, Maria will have 40 plants left after giving some away to her friends and family."
Response:  First, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. Second, we know that the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, so they pressed it 5 times (20 x 1/4). Third, we know that the third friend pressed the doorbell ten times more than the second friend, so they pressed it 5 + 10 = 15 times. Finally, we know that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell sixty times more than the third friend, so they pressed it 15 x 60 = 900 times. Therefore, the total number of doorbell presses was 20 + 5 + 15 + 900 = 935 times.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pages solo has left to read in each subject.  Secondly, we will use this information to determine how many pages he needs to read per day to finish all subjects within four days.  To calculate the number of pages left to read, let's subtract the number of pages solo has already read from the total number of pages in each subject:  Učebnica vedy: 20 - 15 = 5 pages left to read.  Učebnica sociálnych štúdií: 20 - 15 = 5 pages left to read.  Učebnica histórie: 7 - 15 = -8 pages (Solo has already read more than half of this subject!)  Učebnica zemepisnej vedy: 8 - 15 = -7 pages (Again, Solo has already read more than half of this subject!) Now that we know how many pages are left to read in each subject, we can calculate how many pages Solo needs to read per day to finish all subjects within four days.  Total number of pages left to read: 5 + 5 + (-8) + (-7) = 30 pages.  Since Solo has already read 15 pages, he needs to read an additional 30 - 15 = 15 pages per day to finish all subjects within four days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John drinks one glass of water every morning upon waking up, and another before bedtime in the evening. This means he consumes two glasses of water per day. Since there are seven days in a week, John drinks a total of 14 glasses of water per week (2 x 7). However, during the weekends, John prefers to relax and enjoys some soft drinks instead of water, so he doesn't drink any water on Saturdays and Sundays. Therefore, the number of glasses of water John consumes per week is 14 - 2 = 12.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3 miles of distance. So if there is a distance of 42 miles between two points on opposite sides of the ocean, it will take:  

(42 x 3) / 10 = 1260 / 10 = 126 minutes or approximately 2 hours and 26 minutes for the mist to cover the entire city."
Response:  First, Poppy places one quarter of the cookies (25%) on the plate. That means she has 1000 x 0.25 = 250 cookies left to place. Then, her mom adds another third (33%) of the remaining cookies. So, the total number of cookies that need to be placed is: 250 + (1000 - 250) x 0.33 = 250 + 330 = 580 cookies. Therefore, there are 580 cookies left to be placed.
Response:  If Amir has 5 cookies and Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, then Cody will eat 3 x 5 = 15 cookies.  So, together they will have eaten 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.
Response:  First, we need to find out how much volume each crate takes up.  Since each crate is 5 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches high, its volume can be calculated as follows: Volume = length x width x height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches (or 1.2 cubic feet) Now that we know the volume of one crate, we can calculate the total internal volume of all three crates by multiplying the volume of one crate by 3: Total internal volume = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches or 3.6 cubic feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frankie watched one hour of television each night from Monday to Thursday (Monday to Thursday). This means he watched three hours of television in total (1 hour x 4 days = 3 hours). Secondly, we are told that on Tuesday and Wednesday, Frankie watched one episode of his favorite series for 30 minutes each day. Therefore, the total number of episodes he watched on these two days is: 2 days x 1 episode per day = 2 episodes. On Thursday, Frankie watched an additional hour-long episode and 30 minutes of another episode. So, the total number of episodes he watched on Thursday is: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 episodes. Finally, we know that Frankie did not watch any television on Friday or Saturday because he had to stay up late both nights. Therefore, the total number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Thursday is: 1.5 episodes x 30 minutes per episode = 45 minutes. To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Thursday, we divide the total number of minutes he watched on Thursday by 30 minutes per episode: 45 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 1.5 episodes. Therefore, the correct answer is: 2 episodes (on Tuesday and Wednesday) + 1.5 episodes (on Thursday) = 3.5 episodes.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Henry made 15 more colaccios than he had planned. This means that if he had planned to make x colaccios, then he actually made x + 15.  Secondly, we know that after peeling off five of them, Henry was left with 110 colaccios. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x + (x + 15) - 5 = 110  Simplifying this equation, we get:  
2x + 15 - 5 = 110  Which simplifies further to:  
2x = 95  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  
x = 47.5  Since we cannot have a fraction of a colaccio, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Henry made 47 colaccios last year."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much fuel will be purchased in total if someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline at $3 per gallon. Total cost = Number of gallons x Price per gallon = 10 x $3 = $30. Now, let's consider the cashback offer from the company with applications. The cashback amount is $20 for each gallon filled up. So, the total cashback amount would be: Cashback amount = Number of gallons x Cashback per gallon = 10 x $20 = $200. Therefore, after filling up 10 gallons of gasoline and receiving the cashback, the net price paid by the customer would be: Net price = Total cost - Cashback amount = $30 - $200 = -$170. This means that the customer would receive $200 as cashback, and their net payment for the 10 gallons of gasoline would be negative ($170).
Response:  First, we need to find out how many packages of fruit Marcell and Beatrice have in total.  We know that Beatrice has 24 packets of length and two packets of width, so she has 24 x 2 = 48 packets of fruit in total.  Marcell has three packets of width and 14 packets of length, so he has 3 x 14 = 42 packets of fruit in total.  Therefore, together they have 48 + 42 = 90 packets of fruit.
"Response:  First, we know that the boat traveled for 16 seconds and covered 20 stops (since each stop is 6 meters long). So, to find out how many meters the boat traveled, we can multiply the number of stops by the distance between each stop:  
20 x 6 = 120 meters  Now we know that the boat traveled 120 meters. Next, we are given that the boat took in 2 liters of water per meter it traveled. Therefore, to find out how much water was taken in, we can multiply the distance traveled by the amount of water taken in per meter:  
120 x 2 = 240 liters  Finally, we know that there were 64 seconds left over after the boat had traveled for 16 seconds. To find out how much time was spent taking in water, we can subtract the time spent traveling from the total time left over:  
64 - 16 = 48 seconds  Since the boat took in water for 48 seconds, we can calculate how much water was taken in during that time using the same formula as before:  
48 x 2 = 96 liters  Adding up all these amounts gives us the final answer:  
240 + 96 = 336 liters  Of course, this assumes that the boat started with no water inside. If there was some initial amount of water already in the boat, we would need to subtract that from the total amount taken in."
"Response:  We know that each teacher has 2 hours per day and there are 4 teachers in total. So, the total number of hours taught per day is:  
2 hours/teacher x 4 teachers = 8 hours/day  Now, we know that the table is cleaned 3 times per hour, so the total number of cleansings per day is:  
3 cleansings/hour x 8 hours/day = 24 cleansings/day  Therefore, the table is cleaned 24 times per day."
Response:  If Ryan adds two flowers to the garden every day and there are no flowers that don't grow for 15 days, then he will have added a total of 30 flowers (2 x 15 = 30). So, after 15 days, the garden will have 30 flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jamal's phone can store six times more photos than Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone can store 50 photos, then Jamal's phone can store 6 x 50 = 300 photos.  Secondly, we are given that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos. Therefore, the number of photos visible on Jamal's photo of the cat in the zoo is 1800 / 300 = 6.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha will make from selling all ten pieces of 2x4x10 lumber at $10 each. That would be:  
10 x $10 = $100  
Next, let's calculate how much money she will make from selling five pieces of 4x4x10 lumber at $16 each. That would be:  
5 x $16 = $80  
Now, add up the total amount of money that Sasha will make from both sets of lumber:  
$100 + $80 = $180  
Therefore, if Sasha sells all of her lumber, she will make $180."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Katy used 7 cups of water and 13 tablespoons of sugar to make coffee. Now let's convert these amounts into their respective metric units:  
* 7 cups = 7 x 250 ml = 1750 ml (since there are 250 ml in a cup)  
* 13 tablespoons = 13 x 15 ml = 195 ml (since there are 15 ml in a tablespoon)  
Now, we can calculate how many tablespoons of sugar Katy used:  
195 ml / 15 ml/tablespoon = 13 tablespoons  
So, Katy used 13 tablespoons of sugar."
Response:  First, we know that John bought two pairs of socks for each of his three children. So he bought a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of socks.  Next, we know that each pair of socks cost $60. So the total amount John paid is 6 x $60 = $360.
"Response:  First day, there were 2 containers delivered to Seaside Port, each containing 5 vehicles. So, in total, there were 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles delivered on the first day. The next day, more containers arrived and the total number of vehicles at the port increased to 30. We want to find out how many containers arrived on the second day. To do this, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  
Let x be the number of containers that arrived on the second day. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles delivered on the second day is 5x.  Now, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after both days is 30. So, we can write an equation:  
10 + 5x = 30  Simplifying the equation:  
6x = 20  Dividing both sides by 6:  
x = 4  Therefore, 4 containers arrived on the second day."
"Response:  First, we know that Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylla's and his salary increased by 40% over the past four years. So, if Lylla's salary is x, then Adrien's salary would be 1.3x (since it is 30% higher). Now, we are given that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the past four years, so his new salary would be:  

1.3x + (40% of 1.3x) = 1.3x + 0.4(1.3x) = 1.3x + 0.52x = 1.82x  
Now, we know that Adrien earned $40,000 more than Lylla over the past four years, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  

1.82x - x = 40,000  
Simplifying the equation:  

0.82x = 40,000  
Dividing both sides by 0.82:  

x = 48,000  
So, Lylla's current salary is $48,000."
Response:  If Miguel uses two blocks of paper per week and there are 30 sheets of paper in each block, then he uses a total of 60 sheets of paper per week (2 x 30). Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Miguel uses a total of 240 sheets of paper per month (60 x 4).
Response:  First, we know that Morisette brought five apples and eight oranges. Next, we know that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette and half as many oranges. So, if Morisette brought five apples, then Kael brought ten apples (2 x 5). Additionally, since Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette, he brought four oranges (8 / 2 = 4). Now, let's add up all the fruit that both of them brought: Apples: Morisette - 5, Kael - 10 = 15 Oranges: Morisette - 8, Kael - 4 = 12 Total fruit: 15 + 12 = 27 Therefore, the total number of fruits they have is 27.
Response:  First, we know that Sadie slept for 8 hours on Friday and Saturday, so she slept for a total of 8 + 8 = 16 hours during those two days.  On Monday through Thursday, she slept for 2 fewer hours each day than she did on Friday and Saturday, so she slept for 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  Therefore, Sadie slept for a total of 16 + (6 x 4) = 16 + 24 = 40 hours throughout the week.
"Response:  First, we know that Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers a distance of:  
10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles  
Now, we are told that after 3 hours, Rosie starts running at a speed of 8 kilometers per hour. So, for the remaining 4 hours (since she runs for 7 hours in total), she covers a distance of:  
8 kilometers/hour x 4 hours = 32 kilometers  
Therefore, the total distance Rosie covers in 7 hours is:  
30 miles + 32 kilometers = 62 miles or 100 kilometers"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 60 lists in total and Jennie gives pechiky to one-third of them. So if there are x lists with pechiky, then there will be 2x lists without pechiky. Now, we know that there are 30 lists with pechiky already (given in the problem statement). So, we can set up the equation as follows:  
x + 2x = 30 + 2(60 - 30) = 30 + 2(30) = 30 + 60 = 90  
Now, solving for x, we get:  
x = 30  
So, there were 30 lists in the pile when Jennie started."
Response:  Firstly, Julia had three old plastic spoons that she was using for tasting the soup. Secondly, her husband bought a pack of five new wooden spoons and gave them to Julia. Finally, Julia used three wooden spoons to taste the soup. Therefore, we can conclude that there were eight wooden spoons in total (5 from the pack + 3 used). So, the number of wooden spoons in the package that Julia purchased is 8.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dylan bought more than 38 chicken sausages because he also purchased some beef sausages (rybie klobasy). So, let's subtract 38 from the total number of sausages to find out how many beef sausages he bought.  
Total number of sausages = 38 + x (where x is the number of beef sausages) Total number of sausages - 38 = x 

x = 6 (given in the problem) Therefore, Dylan bought 6 beef sausages and 38 chicken sausages for a total of 44 sausages."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Amy has 20 friends more than Lily. So if Lily has x friends, then Amy has x + 20 friends. Secondly, we are given that Lily found 50 common friends with Amy. Therefore, the total number of friends that Lily and Amy have together is: x + (x + 20) = 3x + 20. Finally, we can simplify the expression to get the final answer: 3x + 20 = 50. Solving for x, we get x = 16. So Lily has 16 friends, and Amy has 16 + 20 = 36 friends. Together, they have 16 + 36 = 52 friends.
Response:  First, we know that each melon costs three times as much as each bell pepper. So if one melon costs $15, then three bell peppers cost $15 x 3 = $45. Since Dillon buys four melons, he pays $45 x 4 = $180 for melons.  Next, we know that each paprika costs $15. So two dozen (20) paprikas cost $15 x 20 = $300.  Finally, we know that each pomaranč costs $5 less than each melon. So if one melon costs $15, then one pomaranč costs $15 - $5 = $10. Ten pomarančes cost $10 x 10 = $100.  Therefore, in total, Dillon pays $180 + $300 + $100 = $680.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours of observation time there are in total for all patients. We know that each patient is observed for 24 minutes per day, so if there are 500 patients, then the total number of hours of observation time is: Total hours = Number of patients x Observation time per patient (in days) x 24 (minutes/day) Total hours = 500 x 1 x 24 = 12,000 minutes Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these observations. The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the total revenue from doctor fees is: Revenue from doctors = Total hours x Doctor fee per hour Revenue from doctors = 12,000 x 150 = 1,800,000 dollars However, the hospital also charges patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue from both sources is: Total revenue = Revenue from doctors + Revenue from patients Total revenue = 1,800,000 + 200 x 12,000 Total revenue = 1,800,000 + 2,400,000 Total revenue = 4,200,000 dollars Therefore, the hospital generates $4,200,000 in revenue from these 500 patients.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 60 seasonal workers were employed at the mall in December. Secondly, one-third of the elves finished their work when children vomited on them. Finally, ten elves remained after the children kicked them in the shins. To find out how many elves are left, let's use the information we have:  One-third of the elves finished their work when children vomited on them: 60 x 1/3 = 20 elves finished their work. Ten elves remained after the children kicked them in the shins: 20 - 10 = 10 elves remained. Therefore, there are 10 elves left.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Joe spent in May and June separately. Then, we can add up these amounts to find out how much he spent in total for both months.  
May: We know that Joe's expenses in May were $500.  So, his expenses for this month are already given.  
June: We don't have an exact amount for Joe's expenses in June, but we do know that they were $60 less than in May. This means that if May's expenses were $500, then June's expenses would be $500 - $60 = $440.  Now let's add up the two amounts to get the total for both months:  
Total = May + June Total = $500 + $440 = $940 Therefore, Joe spent a total of $940 over the two months of May and June."
Response:  First, we know that Pam and Fred went to the carnival together.  They took the mountain coaster twice, so they rode it four times in total (2 x 2).  Then, each of them decided to go skiing twice (2 x 1), which means they used six tickets in total (4 + 2).  So, the correct answer is 6 tickets.
Response:  First, we know that Walt walked 6 kilometers on Monday (pondelok). Next, we know that he walked six times as much on Tuesday (utorok) as he did on Monday. So, if he walked x kilometers on Monday, he walked 6x kilometers on Tuesday. Finally, we are given that the total distance traveled from Monday to Thursday is 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  6x + x = 41  To solve for x, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation:  7x = 41  Now, divide both sides by 7:  x = 6  So, Walt walked 6 kilometers on Tuesday.
Response:  If Tom has 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, how much will he pay for a year (12 months)?  To find out, we need to multiply the number of car washes per month by 12. So, if Tom has 4 car washes per month, he will have:  4 x 12 = 48 car washes per year.  Now, let's calculate the total cost for a year:  48 x $15 = $720.  Therefore, Tom will pay $720 per year for his car washes.
Response:  If Brian has 20 videos and 5 of them are tightly contested before comparison, then he has 20 - 5 = 15 videos left for comparison.  Since Bobby has 5 times fewer videos than Brian, Bobby has 15 x 5 = 75 videos.
Response:  We know that there are 27 one-horned animals in the world and one third of them live in Scotland. Since two thirds of Scottish one-horned animals are females, we can conclude that the number of male Scottish one-horned animals is equal to two thirds of 27, which is 18. Therefore, there are 18 male Scottish one-horned animals.
Response:  First we need to calculate the cost of each item without delivery fee.  For two muffins, the cost is 2 x 7.50 = 15.00 dollars.  For two chips, the cost is 2 x 1.50 = 3.00 dollars.  Total cost before delivery fee is 18.00 dollars. Now let's add the delivery fee which is 20% of the total cost. Delivery fee = (18.00 x 20%) = 3.60 dollars. So the final price including delivery fee will be 18.00 + 3.60 = 21.60 dollars.
Response:  First, we know that Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions at a speed of 5 questions per hour. This means he spent 8 hours x 5 questions/hour = 400 minutes completing the first test. Since there were 75 questions in total, Mark answered 75 x (time taken) / (number of questions) = 75 x 400 / 75 = 300 questions correctly. Now, let's move on to the second test with 100 questions. If Mark has 6 hours to complete this test, and he wants to maintain the same speed as before, he will take 6 hours x 5 questions/hour = 300 minutes to complete the test. However, since there are 100 questions in total, Mark can only answer 100 x (time taken) / (number of questions) = 100 x 300 / 100 = 200 questions correctly. Therefore, Mark left 100 - 200 = 80 questions unanswered or incomplete.
Response:  We know that there are 4 times as many pink flowers as blue flowers. So if there are 12 blue flowers, there must be 4 x 12 = 48 pink flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we have 12 automatic vehicles and 4 manual ones, so the total number of vehicles is 16. Secondly, we know that there are 8 half-automatic vehicles (4 + 4), which means that the percentage of half-automatic vehicles is: Percentage = (8/16) x 100% = 50%.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees as drones (2 x 350 = 700). So, we have 700 - 350 = 350 drone bees. Now, we know that each drone bee is accompanied by one queen bee, so there are 350 queen bees in total. Therefore, there are no robotic bees in this scenario.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games per week. We know that he plays for 2 hours per day, so if we multiply this by 7 days, we get:  

2 hours/day x 7 days = 14 hours/week  
Now, let's calculate how much money Jordan earns from his part-time job. We know that he earns $10 per hour, so if we multiply this by the number of hours he works per week, we get:  

10 dollars/hour x 14 hours/week = 140 dollars/week  
Finally, let's add up the amount of money Jordan earns from both his part-time job and his gaming habit. We know that he spends $60 per month on video games, so if we divide this by the number of weeks in a month (4), we get:  

$60/month / 4 weeks/month = $15 per week  
Adding this to the amount he earns from his part-time job gives us:  

140 dollars/week + 15 dollars/week = 155 dollars/week  
Therefore, Jordan would earn a total of $155 per week if he spent all of his free time playing video games instead of working his part-time job."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much John paid for each item without taxes (pre-tax price). Then, we can add up all these pre-tax prices and subtract the total amount John paid to find out how much he paid in taxes. Finally, we will divide the total amount John paid by the number of items he bought to get the average price per unit.  
Pre-tax price of milk: $2  
Pre-tax price of eggs: $3  
Pre-tax price of bread: $3  
Pre-tax price of cups: $3  
Pre-tax price of pasta for rabbits: $4  
Total amount John paid: $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15  
Tax rate: 10%  
Tax amount: $15 x 10% = $1.50  
Total cost: $15 - $1.50 = $13.50  
Average price per unit: $13.50 / 5 units = $2.70 per unit"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lucas will earn from each client. For that, we multiply the number of clients x price per service (fleafla and packaging). So for 3 clients, he will earn:  
3 clients x $ 2 (fleafla) + 3 clients x $ 5 (packaging) = $ 6 + $ 15 = $ 21  
Now let's add the potential clients he is negotiating with:  
$ 21 + ($ 2 x 5 clients) = $ 21 + $ 10 = $ 31  
So, Lucas will earn $ 31 per week if all the potential clients become his regular customers."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many months there are in one year. There are 12 months in one year. Next, we can calculate how many ananas John can harvest per month based on the information that he has 100 ananas per hectare and he can harvest every three months. This means that for each hectare of land, John can harvest 33.33 ananas (100/3) per month. Now, let's multiply this number by the total number of hectares John owns (10). This gives us a total of 333.33 ananas per month (33.33 x 10) or 4,000 ananas per year (333.33 x 12). So, John can harvest 4,000 ananas per year.
Response:  First, Johnny will collect all the pieces from the first Lego box with 500 pieces. This means he will have 500 blocks. Next, he will collect all the pieces from the second Lego box with three times as many pieces as the first box, which is 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. Finally, he will collect all the pieces from the third Lego box with one-quarter of the number of pieces as the second box, which is 1/4 x 1500 = 375 pieces. In total, Johnny will have collected 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 blocks.
Response:  First, we know that in the first 6 hours of the day, there were 30 bees leaving the hive and returning later. This means that during these 6 hours, there were 30 x 2 = 60 bees outside the hive.  In the next 6 hours, half of them returned (since they had been out for 6 hours), so there were 60 / 2 = 30 bees returning.  Therefore, in total, there were 30 + 30 = 60 bees returning to the hive over the course of the day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of admission for adults is $12 each and children pay $10 each. Secondly, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $8 in small bills (dollars). Finally, we need to find out how many tickets she bought with that amount. To do this, we can use subtraction. So let's subtract the cost of one child ticket ($10) from the total amount given ($8): $8 - $10 = $ -2 This means that Brittany's mom did not have enough money to buy both tickets! Therefore, the correct answer is zero (0), as she did not give any money to the cashier.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and Dorothy has 3 times as many friends as Charlie. So, if Charlie has 12 friends, Dorothy has 3 x 12 = 36 friends. Now we are told that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, James has 4 x 36 = 144 friends on Facebook.
Response:  First we need to calculate how long it takes for each of them to get home from school.  For Steve, we know he can ride his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute (fpm), and he lives 3 miles away from school, so: Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 440 fpm = 7.5 minutes Steve will arrive home in 7.5 minutes.  Now let's calculate how long it takes for Tim to get home on his skateboard. We know he can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 fpm, and he lives 3 kilometers away from school, so: Time = Distance / Speed = 3 km / 264 fpm = 11.4 minutes Tim will arrive home in 11.4 minutes.  Since Steve arrives home first, he will wait for Tim for: Time = Time difference between Steve and Tim = 7.5 minutes - 11.4 minutes = 3.9 minutes So, Steve will wait for Tim for approximately 3.9 minutes before he finishes his race.
Response:  First day, there were 5 people who came to fill up their tires with air. Each tire costs $0.25, so they paid a total of $1.25 (5 x $0.25). Then, 3 people came to fill up their tricycle tires, which also cost $0.25 each, so they paid a total of $0.75 (3 x $0.25). Finally, someone came to fill up one tire on their unicycle, which also costs $0.25. Therefore, the total amount earned that day is $2.75 ($1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25).
Response:  If Carl buys ten packs of cookies and each pack contains six cookies, then he will get in total:  6 x 10 = 60 cookies.  Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl will pay for all of them:  60 x $0.10 = $6.00.  So, Carl will receive $6.00 worth of cookies.
"Response:  First, Dave bought a large package of crackers and stole half from his hungry roommate. Then, when the parrot landed, it swallowed half of the orange that Dave had stolen. Next, three crows ripped the remaining crackers away from the tree branch where they were hanging, each crow taking three crackers. Finally, a weasel stole two-thirds of what was left. So, how many crackers were in the original package that Dave bought?  To solve this problem, let x represent the number of crackers in the original package. We know that Dave stole half of them (x/2), so he has y = x/2 crackers left. The parrot then swallows half of these (y/2) oranges, leaving Dave with z = y/2 crackers. Three crows take three times as many crackers as there are left (3z) each, so they take 3(z) = 3(y/2) crackers. Finally, a weasel steals two-thirds of what is left (2z), so he takes 2(z) = 2(y/2) crackers. Therefore, to find out how many crackers were originally in the package, we can set up an equation based on these steps:  

x - (x/2) + (y/2) - (3y/2) + (2y/2) =?  Simplifying the equation:  

x/2 - y/2 + 3y/2 - 2y/2 =?  Combine like terms:  

x/4 - y/2 + 5y/4 =?  Now we need to find the value of x/4 - y/2 + 5y/4. This expression represents the difference between the total number of crackers in the original package (x/4) and the number of crackers left after all the events have occurred (y/2). Since Dave started with x crackers and ended up with y crackers, the difference between their values must equal the total number of crackers taken by all the animals:  

x/4 - y/2 + 5y/4 = (x/4) - (y/2) + (5y/4"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Kim will spend in class per week.  There are three daily classes of two hours each, so she will spend 3 x 2 = 6 hours in class per day. Since there are five days per week (Monday to Friday), Kim will spend 6 x 5 = 30 hours in class per week. Now, let's calculate how many hours Kim will spend in class for one semester. One semester has 16 weeks, so Kim will spend 30 x 16 = 480 hours in class for one semester.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many meters of space Bill will have after he finishes making all his pastries for one day.  To do this, we need to add up the lengths of each type of pastry that Bill makes.  We know that there are 300 pečenok (pečienok), and each one is 10 cm long, so together they make:  
300 x 10 = 3000 cm  
Next, we know that there are 120 croissants (čokoládovy croissanty), and each one is 15 cm long, so together they make:  
120 x 15 = 1800 cm  
Finally, we know that there are 60 bagets (bagety), and each one is 60 cm long, so together they make:  
60 x 60 = 3600 cm  
Now, let's add up all these values to find out how much space Bill will have at the end of the day:  
3000 + 1800 + 3600 = 9400 cm  
So, Bill will have 9400 cm or 94 m of space left in his oven after he finishes making all his pastries for one day."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three types of monkeys in the zoo - gorillas, pavians and other opices (we don't know their exact number). We also know that each type of monkey needs a different amount of bananas per month. Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, pavians need 100 bananas per month and all other opices together need 200 bananas per month. To calculate how many bananas should be ordered for two months, we can simply multiply the total amount of bananas needed per month by 2:  
For gorillas: 400 x 2 = 800 bananas  
For pavians: 100 x 2 = 200 bananas  
For other opices: 200 x 2 = 400 bananas  
Therefore, to feed all the monkeys in the zoo for two months, we need to order a total of 800 + 200 + 400 = 1400 bananas."
Response:  First, we know that Blake will run back and forth for 15 minutes, so he will cover a distance of 2 x 100 yards = 200 yards.  Now, let's calculate how far Kelly will run if she runs back and forth 34 times on a 40-yard line.  She will cover a distance of 34 x 40 yards = 1360 yards.  So, the winner (Kelly) will be 1360 - 200 = 1160 yards ahead of the loser (Blake).
Response:  First, we know that Raphael bought four packs of something (we don't know what yet), and each pack cost $1.50. So he spent $1.5 x 4 = $6 on those packs. Next, he bought two notebooks, and each notebook cost $4. So he spent $4 x 2 = $8 on those notebooks. Finally, he bought some paper for notes, which cost $20. So in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 pike in the pond according to Finn's observation. Secondly, we know that six of them emerge from their hiding place under the lily pad. Therefore, the number of pike left in the pond is 11 - 6 = 5. Finally, two more pike are seen hiding under the rock. So, the total number of pike visible to Finn in the pond is 5 + 2 = 7.
Response:  First, we know that in Pondelok (Friday), the water level was 5 meters deep. Next, we know that on Utorok (Thursday) there was 2 meters more water than usual. Finally, we are told that on Streda (Wednesday), the water level was two-thirds of what it was on Utorok. So let's calculate how much water was in the reservoir on Wednesday: Water level on Thursday = 5 + 2 = 7 meters Water level on Wednesday = 7 x 2/3 = 4.67 meters Therefore, the water level in the reservoir on Wednesday was approximately 4.67 meters deep.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Anakin caught 10 sea stars, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  Secondly, we are given information about what Locsin caught less than Anakin.  So, Locsin caught fewer sea stars by 5, fewer sea horses by 3, and fewer clownfish by 2. Therefore, to find out how many fish Locsin caught in total, we need to subtract the difference between what Anakin caught and what Locsin caught from what Anakin caught.  Sea stars: 10 - (5 x 1) = 10 - 5 = 5 Sea horses: 6 - (3 x 1) = 6 - 3 = 3 Clownfish: 3 - (2 x 1) = 3 - 2 = 1 Total: 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 Therefore, Locsin caught 9 fish in total.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much the price of the watch will be after each two-month period.  If the price increases by 20% every two months, then it will increase by:  
Price increase = 20% x Original Price  
Price increase = 0.2 x $20  
Price increase = $4  
So, after one two-month period, the price of the watch will be:  
New Price = Original Price + Price Increase  
New Price = $20 + $4  
New Price = $24  
Now, let's repeat this process for each two-month period:  
After 2 months: New Price = $24 + $4 (price increase) = $28  
After 4 months: New Price = $28 + $4 (price increase) = $32  
After 6 months: New Price = $32 + $4 (price increase) = $36  
After 8 months: New Price = $36 + $4 (price increase) = $40  
After 10 months: New Price = $40 + $4 (price increase) = $44  
After 12 months: New Price = $44 + $4 (price increase) = $48  
After 14 months: New Price = $48 + $4 (price increase) = $52  
After 16 months: New Price = $52 + $4 (price increase) = $56  
After 18 months: New Price = $56 + $4 (price increase) = $60  
After 20 months: New Price = $60 + $4 (price increase) = $64  
After 22 months: New Price = $64 + $4 (price increase) = $68  
After 24 months: New Price = $68 + $4 (price increase) = $72  
After 26 months: New Price = $72 + $4 (price increase) = $76  
After 28 months: New Price = $76 + $4 (price increase) = $80  
After 30 months: New Price = $8"
Response:  We know that the total cost of all toys is $12 (3 x $4 = $12).  The red car costs $4, so the other toys must cost $8 ($12 - $4 = $8).  Since each action figure costs $5, there are 8/5 = 1.6 action figures ($8 / $5 = 1.6).  Therefore, each hobby horse costs $1.60 ($8 / 1.6 = $1.60).
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jackie will save if she pays the accountant instead of doing it herself.  If she works for 3 hours less and earns $35 per hour, then she saves:  
$35 x 3 = $105  Next, we need to subtract this amount from what she would have paid the accountant:  $90 - $105 = -$15 So, if Jackie pays the accountant, she will be $15 short.  Therefore, the correct answer is:  -$15"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Elvira spent on the computer and accessories:  
Computer + keyboard + mouse = 1090 eur + (74 eur) + (102 eur) = 1266 eur  Now let's subtract the amount she spent from her budget of 1500 euros:  
1500 - 1266 = 234 euros So Elvira will have 234 euros left over for clothing."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans for her school charity event and she has 9 eggs in total. Secondly, we know that she needs 3 eggs for each Spanish flan, so she will need 3 x 15 = 45 eggs in total. Finally, we know that she already has 9 eggs, so she will need an additional 45 - 9 = 36 eggs. Therefore, Sandra must pay attention to the number of eggs 36 times (since she needs 36 more eggs than she already has) when checking on the development of her chicks.
"Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so if Brooke is x years old, then Seth is 2x years old.  In two years, Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2(x + 2) = 2x + 4 years old.  Since the sum of their ages in two years will be 28, we can set up the equation:  

2x + 4 = 28  
Simplifying the equation:  

2x = 24  
x = 12  
So, Brooke is currently 12 years old, and Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which means he is 24 years old."
Response:  If Ethel has $8 and Jimmy has twice as much money as Ethel, then Jimmy has $8 x 2 = $16.
Response:  First, we know that Pancho walks 30 kilometers during the weekdays (Monday to Friday). This means he covers a total distance of 30 x 5 = 150 kilometers per week. Now, we are told that on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays), he walks an additional 10 miles each day. So, the total distance covered by Pancho over the weekend is 2 x 10 = 20 kilometers. Therefore, the total distance covered by Pancho in one week is: 150 + 20 = 170 kilometers.
"Response:  First, we know that each uniform consists of a hat (which costs $25), a jacket or ""sako"" (which costs three times as much as the hat), and pants or ""nohavice"" (which cost roughly the same amount as the hat and jacket). So let's start with the total cost of one unit of each item: Hat: $25 Sako: 3 x $25 = $75 Nohavice: $25 Now, we need to find out how many units of each item are needed for one complete uniform. We can do this by dividing the total cost of each item by its price: Hat: $25 / $25 = 1 unit Sako: $75 / $25 = 3 units Nohavice: $25 / $25 = 1 unit Finally, we add up all these units to get the total cost of one complete uniform: 1 unit x $25 + 3 units x $25 + 1 unit x $25 = $25 + $75 + $25 = $125 Therefore, the total cost of one complete marching band uniform is $125."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many legs each group of insects has.  
* Pavúk (spider) - 8 legs  
* Hmyz (insect) - 6 legs  
* Bezstávovec (bug) - 10 legs  
Now that we know how many legs each group has, let's add up the total number of legs for all three groups:  
Total legs = 8 x 80 + 6 x 90 + 10 x 3 =?  
Can you solve this problem and tell me the total number of legs Jake sees in the museum exhibit?"
Response:  First, we know that Sally Dvojka is three years older than Starka Červená. So if Starka Červená is x years old, then Sally Dvojka is x + 3 years old.  Next, we know that Stará babka is twice as old as Sally Dvojka. So if Sally Dvojka is x + 3 years old, then Stará babka is 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6 years old.  Now, we are told that Sally Štvorka and Sally Tridsaťdva have the same age. So if Sally Štvorka is x years old, then Sally Tridsaťdva is also x years old.  Finally, we know that Sally Tridsaťdva has eight more years than Sally Štvorka. So if Sally Štvorka is x years old, then Sally Tridsaťdva is x + 8 years old.  Putting all of this information together, we can set up an equation to represent the ages of the four sisters:  Sally Dvojka = x + 3  Stará babka = 2x + 6  Sally Štvorka = x  Sally Tridsaťdva = x + 8  We want to find out the total age of the four sisters, so let's add up their ages:  Total Age = Sally Dvojka + Stará babka + Sally Štvorka + Sally Tridsaťdva  Substituting the equations for each sister's age, we get:  Total Age = (x + 3) + (2x + 6) + x + (x + 8)  Simplifying, we get:  Total Age = 3x + 17  Since we know that Sally Tridsaťdva has eight more years than Sally Štvorka, we can deduce that Sally Štvorka is five years younger than Sally Tridsaťdva. Therefore, the total age of the four sisters is:  Total Age = 3x + 17 = 3(5) + 17 = 1
Response:  First we need to calculate how much Jessica pays each month for her student loans, credit card debt and mortgage.  Student loan: $300/month Credit Card Debt: $200/month Mortgage: $500/month Total Monthly Payments: $1,000 Now let's assume that Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each of these debts. So she will pay: Student Loan: $300 x 1.5 = $450 Credit Card Debt: $200 x 1.5 = $300 Mortgage: $500 x 1.5 = $750 Total Monthly Payments: $1,450 To find out how much Jessica will pay in one year, we can multiply the total monthly payments by 12 months: $1,450 x 12 = $17,400 Therefore, if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum payment for all of her debts, she will pay $17,400 per year.
"Response:  First, Billy needs to prepare all 60 potatoes for the barbecue. Since each potato takes him approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds (1 min + 30 sec) to peel and cut, he will need:  
60 potatoes x 1 min + 30 sec = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes  
Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 90 minutes to prepare all the potatoes for the barbecue."
"Response:  First, we know that they sell each cup for $0.50 and get 20 cups per gallon. So, if they sell one gallon of lemonade, they will earn:  

$0.50 x 20 = $10.00 

Now, we are told that they have a profit of $25.00, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:  

$10.00 (earnings from selling one gallon) + $25.00 (profit) = $35.00 

Simplifying the equation:  

$10.00 + $25.00 = $35.00 

Solving for the unknown variable ($25.00):  

$25.00 = $35.00 - $10.00 

Subtracting $10.00 from both sides:  

$25.00 = $25.00 

Since the left side is equal to the right side, we can conclude that the amount spent on citrus fruits is $25.00."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 240 Asians in total (given). Of these, 80 were Japanese and the rest (160) were Chinese. Now, we are asked to find out how many girls were present in the Chinese group. So, let's use the information given to us: There were 60 boys in the Chinese group. Therefore, if there were 60 boys, then there must have been an equal number of girls (since the ratio of boys to girls is always 1:1). Hence, there were 60 girls in the Chinese group as well.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Zayed spends on rent, gasoline, and other expenses.  Rent is 1/4 of his salary, so he pays $1500 per month (1/4 x $6000). Gasoline is 1/3 of his salary, so he pays $2000 per month (1/3 x $6000). Other expenses are half of what remains, which is $1500 (half of $6000 - $2000 - $1500 = $1500).  Now let's add up all these amounts: $1500 + $2000 + $1500 = $5000.  So, Zayed has $5000 left after paying all his bills and giving charity.  However, he also gives his wife $700 for groceries and other household expenses, leaving him with $4300 ($5000 - $700 = $4300).
"Response:  First, we know that Rani has 10 crabs more than Monica, so Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Rani.  Therefore, Monica has 4(=4) crabs.  Now, let's add the number of crabs that Monica and Rani have:  
Monica has 4 crabs + Rani has 10 crabs = 14 crabs.  Since Bo has 40 crabs, we can find out how many crabs all three people together have by adding their numbers:  
14 (Monica and Rani) + 40 (Bo) = 54 crabs.  So, there are 54 crabs in total among Monica, Rani, and Bo."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Lloyd earned in the first week.  In the first week, he taught for 5 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned:  
$10 x 5 = $50  Now let's calculate how much he earned in the second week. He taught for 8 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned:  
$10 x 8 = $80  Finally, we add up what he earned in both weeks:  
$50 + $80 = $130  So, Lloyd earned $130 in two weeks."
Response: 1) The winner received 3/4 of the votes. 2) There were 80 students who voted in total. 3) To find out how many votes the loser got, we need to subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of voters (80). So, the loser got: 80 - 3/4(80) = 80 - 60 = 20 votes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So if she ordered x white carnations, she ordered 4x white carnations.  Secondly, we know that she also ordered 200 red lilies, which were five times as many as the number of white carnations. Therefore, she ordered 1000 red lilies (5 x 200).  Finally, we know that she threatened to change suppliers if the remaining red roses were not delivered by the fifth day. So we need to find out how many red roses she needs to receive in order to avoid changing suppliers.  To do this, let's subtract the total number of white carnations and red lilies from the original order:  Total order - (x + 4x) - 200 = 0  Simplifying and solving for x, we get: 3x + 800 = 0  Solving for x, we get: x = 267  Therefore, Sandra needs 267 red roses to be delivered by the fifth day in order to avoid changing suppliers.
Response:  We know that Mark is 5 years older than Jan and Jean is 2 years older than Mark. So we can start with the information that Mark is x years old and Jan is (x - 5) years old.  Now, we know that Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean is x + 2 years old.  Finally, we know that all three people are the same age, so we can set up the equation: x + (x - 5) + (x + 2) = 30.  Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 7 = 30.  Solving for x, we find that x = 18.  Therefore, Jean is 18 + 2 = 20 years old.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much faster the first team is compared to the second team. We know that each member of the first team runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, so their average speed is:  55 seconds / 400 meters = 0.1375 meters per second (m/s) Now, let's look at the second team. Their first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means their average speed is:  60 seconds / 400 meters = 0.15 meters per second (m/s) Since the first team is faster than the second team, they will have an advantage in terms of time. To calculate this advantage, we can use the formula: Time difference = Distance / Speed So, for the first team: Time difference = 400 meters / 0.1375 m/s = 29.8 seconds For the second team: Time difference = 400 meters / 0.15 m/s = 26.67 seconds Therefore, the first team will finish approximately 3.13 seconds before the second team.
"Response:  Firstly, there are six possible outcomes when throwing a fair six-sided die:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Now, let's count how many of these outcomes lead to either two pairs or one large number (greater than 3):  
1. One pair: 2 and 2, 3 and 3, 4 and 4, 5 and 5, and 6 and 6 (there are five possibilities). Each of these outcomes has a probability of 1/6, so the probability of getting one pair is 5/6 or approximately 0.8333 (or 83.33%).  
2. Two pairs: 2 and 2 and 3 and 3, 2 and 2 and 4 and 4, 2 and 2 and 5 and 5, and 2 and 2 and 6 and 6 (there are four possibilities). Each of these outcomes has a probability of 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36, so the probability of getting two pairs is 4/36 or approximately 0.1111 (or 11.11%).  
3. A large number greater than 3: all remaining outcomes except for 2 and 2, 2 and 3, 2 and 4, 2 and 5, and 2 and 6 (there are three possibilities). Each of these outcomes has a probability of 1/6, so the probability of getting a large number greater than 3 is 3/6 or approximately 0.5 (or 50%).  
Now, we add up the probabilities: 0.8333 + 0.1111 + 0.5 = 1.4444 or approximately 144.44%. This means that the probability of either getting two pairs or a large number greater than 3 is higher than the probability of getting only one pair."
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked half of the apples, then they picked 20/2 = 10 apples each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 klietkas (cages) in total, and each cage contains 3 potkanys (rabbits). Therefore, the total number of potkanys is 10 x 3 = 30.   Next, we know that each potkany receives 6 pieces of slamka (food), so the total amount of food given to all potkanys is 30 x 6 = 180 pieces.   Now, let's consider the case of the zajačie krčme (squirrel enclosure). We know that there are 20 squirrels in total, and each squirrel receives 5 pieces of slamka. So, the total amount of food given to all squirrels is 20 x 5 = 100 pieces.   Finally, we know that there are 160 pieces of slamka in total, and all of them have been distributed among the potkanys and squirrels. Therefore, the number of potkanys in each klietka can be found by dividing the total number of slamka by the number of pieces given to each potkany:  30 / 6 = 5   So, there are 5 potkanys in each klietka.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much interest has been earned over three months.  The formula for calculating interest is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time.  In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2%, and the time is 3 months.  So, the interest would be: Interest = $100 x 2% x 3/12 = $6.  Now, let's add the interest to the original principal to find out how much Mandy needs to pay Benedicto: Amount = $100 + $6 = $106.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of transporting each wreck from the farm to the storage is $2. So if the merchant buys x wrecks for $20, then he pays $2x for transportation costs. Secondly, we are given that the merchant sells all wrecks for $30 per unit and earns a total of $400. Therefore, the number of wrecks sold can be calculated as follows:  400 = 30x Number of wrecks  x = 13 (answer)
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each person paid for their tickets. There were three tickets at $20.25 each, so they paid a total of $60.75 (3 x $20.25). Then, they spent an additional $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, which means they saved $4.50 per ticket. So, the total amount they paid for all three tickets is:  
$60.75 - $4.50 = $56.25  
Now, let's find out how much each person should pay based on the agreement that they will split the costs equally among themselves. Since there are three people, and they paid a total of $56.25, each person should pay:  
$56.25 / 3 = $18.75"
Response:  If John can gather 3 bushels of wheat in an hour, that means he can gather 3 x 60 = 180 bushels per hour. Now, if he wants to gather 2 bushels per minute, we need to divide 180 by 2: 180 / 2 = 90. So, John can gather 90 bushels of wheat per minute.
Response:  If there are ten chickadees in the flock and each bird needs to eat 2.5 kilograms of insects per week, then we can calculate how much food they need daily. First, let's convert the weight from grams to kilograms: 2.5 kg x 1000 g/kg = 2500 g Now, let's divide the total amount of food needed per week by seven days to find out how much food they need daily: 2500 g / 7 d = 357 g per day So, each chickadee needs about 357 grams of insects per day.
Response:  First, we know that Tom planted 10 trees per year for 10 years, so he has 10 x 10 = 100 trees in total.  Next, we know that each year he cuts down 2 trees, so after 10 years, he will have 100 - 2(10) = 80 trees left.  Now, we are told that after 10 years, 30% of the trees died, which means 30% of 80 is 24 dead trees (since 30% of 80 is 24).  So, Tom will be left with 80 - 24 = 56 trees.
Response:  First, we know that there were 18 pink plastic flamingos in the front yard of Sue's house on Friday morning.  Next, we know that Susie and her neighbors took back one-third of the flamingos on Saturday morning. This means they removed 6 flamingos (one-third of 18).  So, on Saturday morning, there were 18 - 6 = 12 flamingos left in the front yard.  On Sunday morning, we are told that another 18 pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. Therefore, the total number of flamingos in the front yard on Sunday morning was:  12 + 18 = 30 flamingos.  Finally, we are asked how many more pink plastic flamingos were in the front yard than white plastic flamingos. To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of white flamingos from the total number of flamingos:  30 - 6 = 24.  So, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos in the front yard than white plastic flamingos.
Response:  First, we know that one ceruzka costs $2, so if Violetta wants to buy five different colors of markers, she will need to spend $2 x 5 = $10 on markers alone. Since she has $20 for the entire purchase, she will have $20 - $10 = $10 left over after buying the markers. Therefore, she can buy ten more items with the remaining $10. Each item costs $2, so she can buy ten items of any kind, including more markers or other school supplies.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much the pencil and eraser cost together. We know that the pencil costs 1.20 dollars and the eraser costs 0.30 dollars. So, if we multiply 1.20 by 0.30, we get: 1.20 x 0.30 = 0.36 Therefore, the total cost of the pencil and eraser is: 1.20 + 0.36 = 1.56 Now, let's calculate how much 8 pieces would cost. If we multiply 1.56 by 8, we get: 1.56 x 8 = 12.48 So, 8 pieces of the pencil and eraser set will cost 12.48 dollars.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much milk is needed for each restaurant. We have 200 liters of milk and we want to divide it among 40 restaurants. So, we can start by dividing 200 by 40: 200 / 40 = 5 This means that each restaurant will receive 5 liters of milk. Now, let's check how much milk is left over after distributing it among all the restaurants: 200 - (40 x 5) = 200 - 200 = 0 That's right! No milk is left over. All 200 liters are used up.
Response:  We know that in Soda there are 23786 inhabitants (obyvatelov). Of them, there are 8417 men and 9092 women. To find out how many children live in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. Total population = 8417 + 9092 = 17519. So, there are 17519 - 8417 - 9092 = 9010 children living in Soda.
"Response:  In the first month, Elaine collected 20 Pokémon cards.  In the second month, she collected 20 fewer than in the first month (since it says ""about 20 fewer""), so she collected 20 - 20 = 0 Pokémon cards.  In the third month, she collected twice as many Pokémon cards as she did in the first and second months combined, so she collected 2 x (10 + 0) = 2 x 10 = 20 Pokémon cards.  Therefore, Elaine has a total of 20 + 0 + 20 = 40 Pokémon cards."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark writes the same number of words for two different publishers, and each publisher pays him a different price per word. We also know that Publisher A pays Mark twice as much as Publisher B. Finally, we are told that Mark edits a total of 1000 words per week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per word. To find out how much Mark earns per week in cents, we can use this information to set up an equation:  
Let X be the number of words Mark writes for Publisher B (since he writes the same number of words for both publishers). Then we know that:  
X + X = 1000 (total number of words edited)  
2X = 1000 (divide both sides by 2)  
X = 500 (solve for X)  
Now we can calculate how much Mark earns from Publisher A:  
Mark earns 2X = 2(500) = 1000 cents from Publisher A.  
Therefore, Mark earns a total of 1000 + 1000 = 2000 cents per week."
Response:  First, we know that Baldur gets 5 vedros of water in the morning and 6 vedros of water in the evening.  One vedro contains 5 liters of water, so let's calculate how many liters of water he gets each day.  In the morning, he gets 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water.  In the evening, he gets 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water.  Therefore, Baldur gets a total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water per day.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money John will receive in one year if he receives $5,000 as a one-time payment and his salary is increased by 5%. If he earns $2,000 per week, then he earns $104,000 per year (2,000 x 52). After receiving the bonus of $5,000, his total income for the year would be: Total Income = $104,000 + $5,000 = $119,000. Now let's calculate how much John has earned in that year. Earning = Total Income - Bonus Earning = $119,000 - $5,000 = $114,000 So, John has earned $114,000 in that year.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many tons of grapes are produced per hectare. We know that each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Next, we need to calculate how many liters of wine are produced from one ton of grapes. We know that one ton of grapes produces two barrels of wine (1 ton = 2 barrels). Finally, we can multiply the number of tons of grapes produced per hectare by the number of liters of wine produced per ton of grapes to find out how many liters of wine are produced per hectare.  So, if we have 5 tons of grapes per hectare and each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, then we have:  5 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels/hectare  Now, let's convert barrels to liters. One barrel is equal to 163.4 liter, so:  10 barrels x 163.4 liters/barrel = 1634 liters/hectare  Therefore, the farm produces 1634 liters of wine per hectare.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carlo has eaten 3 sandwiches per day for 7 days, so he has consumed 3 x 7 = 21 sandwiches in total. Each sandwich contains two slices of cheese, so Carlo has eaten 21 x 2 = 42 slices of cheese.  Next, we are told that Carlo has also eaten 3 breakfasts with eggs and ham, each using one slice of cheese. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used by Carlo is 42 + 3 = 45. Finally, we are given that Carlo had some leftover macaroni and cheese, which contained 8 slices of cheese. So, the total number of slices of cheese Carlo used is 45 + 8 = 53.  The correct answer is 53.
Response:  First, we know that Janet has 22 green and 10 yellow feathers.  Next, she bought 6 blue feathered birds, each with 9 feathers, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 new feathers.  Additionally, she bought 2 red feathered birds, each with 6 feathers, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 new feathers.  In total, Janet now has 22 + 54 + 12 = 88 feathers.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total score of the first five tests for Brinley: Total Score = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 458. Next, we subtract the lowest score from the total score to get the required score for the sixth test: Required Score = Total Score - Lowest Score = 458 - 71 = 387. Therefore, Brinley needs a score of at least 387 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.
Response:  First, we know that Michael rode his bike 4 times a week for 4 weeks, so he rode a total of 4 x 4 = 16 kilometers per week.  Next, we know that each ride was 25 kilometers long, so Michael rode a total of 16 x 25 = 400 kilometers in 4 weeks.  Finally, we know that Michael reduced his rides to twice a week and increased the distance of each ride to 60 kilometers, so he rode a total of 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers in the next 3 weeks.  Therefore, the total number of kilometers Michael rode is:  400 + 120 = 520 kilometers.
Response:  First, we know that there are 25 chocolate bars and each bar has 80 candies inside.  So, in total, there are 25 x 80 = 2000 candies.  Now, we know that each chocolate bar weights twice as much as one candy, so if each candy weighs 40g, then each chocolate bar weighs 2 x 40g = 80g.  Therefore, the total weight of all the chocolate bars is 25 x 80g = 2000 x 80g = 160kg.  So, Joe's bag of sweets weighs 160kg.
Response:  First day (Monday), she bought 4 colaccos. Second day (Tuesday), she bought three times as many = 3 x 4 = 12 colaccos. Third day (Wednesday), she bought five times as many = 5 x 12 = 60 colaccos. Total number of colaccos purchased over all three days = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 colaccos.
Response:  First, we know that each tin can costs $6000 per unit.  We also know that there are 20 units of tin cans in one pallet.  Therefore, the cost of one pallet is $6000 x 20 = $120,000.  Now, let's calculate the cost of one cup.  There are 10 cups in one pallet, so the cost of one cup is $120,000 / 10 = $12,000 per cup.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $10 saved before she started babysitting and each babysitting job pays her $5. So, after four jobs, she will have $10 + (4 x $5) = $10 + $20 = $30.  Secondly, the cost of the new dress and two pairs of socks is $30 + ($20 x 2) = $30 + $40 = $70.  Finally, we need to subtract the amount Sara already has from the total cost, which gives us $70 - $30 = $40.  Therefore, Sara can afford the new dress and two pairs of socks if she babysits four times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and he has two white chickens more than red ones. So, if he has x red chickens, he will have x + 2 white chickens. Now, let's consider the number of eggs produced by each chicken. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so x red chickens will produce 3x eggs per day. White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so (x+2) white chickens will produce 5(x+2) eggs per day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the following equation: 3x + 5(x+2) = 42. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42. Combine like terms: 8x + 10 = 42. Solve for x: x = 7. Therefore, Jerry has 7 red chickens.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many kilometers Gary will walk in one hour at a speed of 5 km/h.  To do this, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time.  In this case, the distance is 1.5 miles (which is equal to 2400 meters), and the time is 1 hour.  So, the distance traveled in one hour is:  
distance = 2400 m / 5 km/h = 480 km  Now, let's calculate how many hours it will take Gary to walk around the park.  We know that the perimeter of the park is 1.5 miles, so we can use the same formula as before:  time = distance / speed.  Plugging in the values we get:  time = 1.5 mi / 5 km/h = 0.3 hours or 18 minutes  Therefore, Gary will spend 18 minutes walking around the park."
Response:  First day, there were 100 customers. Second day, there were 50 more than the first day, so second day had 100 + 50 = 200 customers. Third day, there were 50 more than the second day, so third day had 200 + 50 = 300 customers. Therefore, the total number of customers for three days is 100 + 200 + 300 = 600.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that both big and small basins have outlets that empty them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.  Secondly, we are given that before 4 minutes ago, the large basin had twice as much water as the small basin.  Finally, we are told that now the large basin has four times as much water as the small basin.  Using this information, let's set up an equation based on what we know:  Large Basin Water = Small Basin Water x 2 (before 4 minutes)  Now, since the large basin empties at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, we can say that:  Large Basin Water = Small Basin Water x 2 x 4 (gallons/minute)  Since the small basin also empties at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, we can substitute in for its water amount:  Small Basin Water = Small Basin Water x 4 (gallons/minute)  Simplifying these two equations, we get:  Large Basin Water = Small Basin Water x 8  Solving for the unknown variable ""Small Basin Water"", we find that:  Small Basin Water = 8 gallons  Therefore, the small basin currently holds 8 gallons of water."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lori will earn per hour of work. We know that her weekly wage is $8 x 40 hours = $320. So, her hourly wage is $320 / 40 hours = $8 per hour. Now, let's calculate how many hours she needs to work to buy the shoes and the socks. For the shoes, she needs to pay $320, so she needs to work for: $320 / $8 per hour = 40 hours. For the socks, she needs to pay $32, so she needs to work for: $32 / $8 per hour = 4 hours. Therefore, in total, Lori needs to work for 44 hours (40 hours + 4 hours) to be able to afford both the shoes and the socks.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much interest will be added to the original amount of $2000 over 12 months. To do this, we can use the formula for simple interest: SI = P x R x T, where SI is the simple interest, P is the principal (original amount), R is the rate (interest rate as a decimal), and T is the time (time in years). In this case, the time is 1 year, so we can substitute that value into the formula: SI = 2000 x 0.10 x 1 = 200. So, the total amount that Janeth will have to pay back is the original amount plus the interest: 2000 + 200 = 2200. Now, let's calculate how much she will pay each month. We can divide the total amount by 12 to find out her monthly payment: 2200 / 12 = 183.33. Therefore, Janeth will have to pay $183.33 per month for 12 months to repay the loan with an interest rate of 10%.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the bouquet and each rose has 7 petals. So we can start by multiplying 4 (the number of roses) by 7 (the number of petals per rose):  4 x 7 = 28  Now we need to add up all the petals in the bouquet. We have just calculated the total number of petals for all 4 roses, which is 28. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many flowers are in the bouquet?"" is:  28"
"Response:  First, we know that Adrian is three years older than Harriet, so if Harriet is currently 21 years old, Adrian is 21 + 3 = 24 years old.  Now, we are asked to find the average age of the three over three years.  To do this, we need to add their ages and divide by three.  So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zach is:  
Adrian's age (24) + Harriet's age (21) + Zach's age (half of 21) = 24 + 21 + 10.5 = 55.5.  Therefore, the average age of the three over three years is 55.5 years old."
Response:  Firstly we know that the total number of points scored is 251 and there are four students. So each student has scored 251/4 = 62.75 points on average. Now, we know that Naomi scored 68 points, so she scored more than the average. We can write an equation to represent this:  68 > 62.75 + x Where x is the number of points scored by Jojo. Since Naomi scored more than the average, we know that x must be less than 62.75. Substituting x with 62.75 - 10 (since Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi), we get:  68 > 62.75 + (62.75 - 10) Which simplifies to:  68 > 62.75 + 52.75 Therefore, Jojo scored 52.75 points.
Response:  Firstly, she spent 10 minutes completing each crossword puzzle, so for three crosswords, that's 3 x 10 = 30 minutes. Secondly, she spent 5 minutes completing each Sudoku puzzle, so for eight Sudokus, that's 8 x 5 = 40 minutes. In total, Carmen spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Celina used 90 liters of water from the tank for irrigation her small garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:  
Tank capacity - Amount used =?  We can start by subtracting 90 liters from the total capacity of the tank:  
120 liters - 90 liters =?  Simplifying the equation:  
30 liters =?  Finally, we have our answer! The amount of water left in the tank after Celina used 90 liters for irrigation is:  
30 liters."
Response:  First, we know that Andy planted 90 geraniums and 40 petunias. We can start by counting how many plants in total: 90 + 40 = 130 plants. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each plant produces. For geraniums, Andy said he planted 3 per pot, so for 90 geraniums, there are 90 x 3 = 270 flowers. For petunias, Andy did not mention how many flowers each plant produces, but since there are only 40 petunias, let's assume they produce an average of 5 flowers per pot (since geraniums produce 3 times as many flowers). So, for 40 petunias, there are 40 x 5 = 200 flowers. Now, add up all the flowers: 270 + 200 = 470 flowers in total.
Response:  First year: The company spent $15,000 on advertising. Second year: The company spent one-third of the previous year's amount on advertising. So in the second year, the company spent: One-third of $15,000 = $5,000 Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising over both years is: Total = $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Carlos will pay for using the boat.  If he uses it for 3 hours, and the rental price is $18 per hour, then his total cost will be:  
$18 x 3 = $54  Next, we need to calculate how much Benji will pay for using the canoe. If he uses it for 5 hours, and the rental price is $30 per hour, then his total cost will be:  
$30 x 5 = $150  Now that we have calculated the costs for both Carlos and Benji, we can add them up to find out how much they will pay in total. So the total amount they will pay is:  
$54 + $150 = $204"
Response:  If Andrew travels from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes 6 days (as stated in the problem). However, if he drives his own car from New Jersey to Rochester, it only takes half the time (i.e., 3 days). So, if Andrew wants to go to Rochester and return by bus, he will spend 6 + 6 = 12 days on the trip. On the other hand, if he drives his own car, he will spend 3 + 3 = 6 days on the trip. Therefore, the numeric answer is 12 days for the bus trip and 6 days for the drive-and-return trip.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the probability that any randomly selected card is an aquatic type.  We can do this by dividing the number of aquatic cards (8) by the total number of cards (70).  This gives us a probability of:  
P(aquatic) = 8/70 = 1/9  
Now, let's consider the case where James loses 8 aquatic cards and buys 14 grass cards.  We want to know the probability that one of the newly purchased grass cards will be an aquatic type.  To calculate this, we need to divide the number of aquatic cards in the new set (14) by the total number of cards in the new set (14 + 8 = 22):  
P(newly-purchased aquatic) = 14/22 = 1/5  
Finally, we want to find the overall probability that a randomly selected card from James's updated collection will be an aquatic type.  We can do this by multiplying the probabilities for each set of cards:  
Overall P(aquatic) = P(original aquatic) x P(newly-purchased aquatic) = 1/9 x 1/5 = 1/45  
So, there is a 1/45 or approximately 2% chance that a randomly selected card from James's updated collection will be an aquatic type."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of the basic burrito without any extras.  Basic Burrito = $6.50 Next, let's add the extras that were requested: Extra Meat ($2) = $2 Extra Cheese ($1) = $1 Avocado ($1) = $1 Two sauces ($0.25 each) = $0.50 Total Cost with Extras = $9.75 Now, we need to subtract the value of the gift card: Subtract Gift Card Value ($5) = $4.75 Final Price = $4.75
Response: 1) Kalinda can do 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can do half as much (since she is only able to do half of what Kalinda does). So together they can do: 4 x 2 = 8 pieces per minute.  Now we need to find out how many hours it will take them to finish the task. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 8 pieces/minute x 60 minutes/hour = 480 pieces/hour. Since there are 360 pieces in total, it will take them: 480 / 360 = 1.5 hours or 90 minutes to complete the task.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn visited the farm two months ago. This means that if there were x watermelons in total, then 0.3x were ready for harvest.  Now, we are told that after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe. So, let's call the number of watermelons that were not yet ripe at the time of Ashlyn's first visit y. Then, we can write an equation based on this information:  0.3x + y = 120 (since there were 120 watermelons in total)  Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were not yet ripe after two weeks. To do this, we can use the fact that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe. So, we can set up another equation:  3/4(y) = 30 (since 30% of the watermelons were ripe)  Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:  0.3x + y = 120 3/4y = 30  Simplifying and solving for y, we get:  y = 60  Therefore, there were 60 watermelons that were not yet ripe after two weeks.  Finally, we can calculate how many watermelons were not yet ripe after two months by multiplying the number of watermelons that were not yet ripe after two weeks by two:  2 \* 60 = 120  So, there were 120 watermelons that were not yet ripe after two months.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each car costs after taxes and registration fees are added.  Tax = 10% of $20,000 = $2,000 Registration fee = $1,000 per car Total cost per car = $20,000 + $2,000 + $1,000 = $23,000 Now, let's calculate the total cost for all 12 cars: Total cost = 12 x $23,000 = $276,000
Response:  Firstly, in Pondelok (Monday), Kylie collects 5 shells more than Robert, so if Robert collects 20 shells, then Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells. Now, let's consider Utorko (Tuesday). Since Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday, she will collect 2 x 25 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells in Utorko.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many bees are in the garden if there are 50 mravcov (ants). We know that one ant can carry 1/2 of a jablek (apple) back to its nest, so we can assume that each ant is carrying an apple half back to its nest. Therefore, if there are 50 mravcov (ants), then there must be 50 x 2 = 100 apple halves in the garden. However, since each apple half is being carried by two ants (one going and one coming), we need to divide the total number of apple halves by 2 to get the actual number of individual ants in the garden. So, 100 / 2 = 50 individual ants in the garden.
Response: 1/3 of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) will jump into the water and swim in the ocean. That means there are 36 - 12 = 24 penguins left. Of those remaining penguins, another 1/3 (24 / 3 = 8) will return to their cave for dinner. So, finally, there are 24 - 8 = 16 penguins still waiting to be fed.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve eats twice as much as his friend and he goes for a walk six times a day. So if his friend goes for a walk once a day, then Steve goes for two walks a day. Now let's calculate how many walks Steve takes in total per week. There are seven days in a week, so Steve takes 7 x 2 = 14 walks per week. Since each walk lasts for one hour, Steve spends 14 hours per week walking. Now we need to calculate how many cherry pies Steve consumes in one week. We know that his friend consumes three cherry pies per week, so Steve must consume six cherry pies per week (twice as much). Therefore, Steve needs six cherry pies per week.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend can have 4 pieces of pizza. So, the total number of pieces of pizza required is:  
20 x 4 = 80 pieces of pizza. However, since the pizza is sold only in 8-piece portions, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John needs to order:  
80 / 8 = 10 portions of pizza."
Response:  First, we know that each pen has 5 empty spaces (prázdnyho). So if we have 25 pens, we will have 25 x 5 = 125 empty spaces in total. Now, let's assume that the cost of one full pen is x. Then, the cost of all 25 pens would be 25x. But since Ram wants to save money, he decides to mix the ink from the empty pens to create one full pen. The amount of ink needed for one full pen can be calculated as follows:  Ink required for one full pen = Total number of empty spaces / Number of pens with ink = 125 / 5 = 25. Therefore, the cost of all 25 pens including the mixed ink would be 25x + 25 = 30x. Since Ram wants to minimize his expenses, he should choose the smallest possible value of x. To do this, we need to find the value of x that makes the expression 30x equal to the minimum possible value. We can solve this problem using calculus or optimization techniques. However, since it's not specified what level of mathematics the student should use, I will provide a simple algebraic solution below.  Solution: Let's consider the function f(x) = 30x. To find the minimum value of f(x), we need to find the derivative of f(x) and set it equal to zero. f'(x) = 30. Setting f'(x) equal to zero, we get: 30 = 0. This gives us no solutions, meaning there is no minimum value for f(x). However, we can see that f(x) is a constant function, so its minimum value must be zero. Therefore, the minimum cost for Ram to buy 25 pens is 0 + 25 = 25.
"Response:  First, we know that Johnny had $20 and added another $10, so he had a total of $30. Next, we know that this amount was invested and tripled in one year, so we can multiply it by three to get the final result. Therefore, after one year, Johnny had:  
$30 x 3 = $90"
Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and Joan is five years older than Jessa. So if Jessa is 20 years old, we can start with her age as our base.   1. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.    2. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.    3. Therefore, the sum of their ages is: 20 + 23 = 43 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many students left the building through each exit.  Through Exit A, 30% of the total number of students (i.e., 30% x 1000 = 300) left the building.  Through Exit B, 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., (2/5) x 700 = 420) left the building.  Finally, through Exit C, there were no students who left the building because all the remaining students (i.e., 700 - 420 = 280) stayed in the building.  Therefore, the total number of students who left the building is 300 + 420 + 0 = 720.
Response:  First, we know that James has 6 candies more than Robert. So if Robert has x candies, then James has x + 6 candies.  Next, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So if Robert has x candies, then John has 2x candies.  Finally, we are told that John has 54 candies.  So we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + (x + 6) = 54  Combine like terms:  2x + 6 = 54 Subtract 6 from both sides:  2x = 48 Divide both sides by 2:   x = 24 Therefore, John has 24 candies and James has 30 candies (since James has 6 more than Robert).
Response:  If Dolly reads one book and Pandora reads one book, then together they will have read two books (1 + 1 = 2).
Response: 1) Mike has five friends. 2) Two of them stop being friends with him. 3) Each of the remaining three friends sends two letters per week, for a total of four letters per week (2 x 3 = 4). 4) Mike responds to each letter in the same way. 5) It takes Mike six minutes to write one page.  To find out how many hours Mike writes per week, we need to divide the number of pages he writes per week by the time it takes him to write one page.  So, if Mike writes four pages per week and it takes him six minutes to write one page, then he spends:  4 pages/week x 6 minutes/page = 24 minutes/week writing.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours as follows:  24 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 0.4 hours/week or 2.4 hours/month.
"Response:  First, we know that Jason has 1000 minutes per month. Second, he has 15-minute conversations with his boss every day, which is 15 x 30 = 450 minutes per month. Third, he spends 300 minutes talking to other people, which leaves us with:  
1000 - 450 - 300 = 250 minutes for the month.  Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month, assuming he uses all of his minutes each day."
Response:  First, we know that Kyle took 5 of Griffin's marbles. So, Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 marbles left.  Next, we know that Billy took twice as many marbles as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 marbles from Griffin.  Therefore, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 marbles left.  Now, we are told that Ginger gave some of Griffin's marbles back to him, but not all of them. We know that Colby took 3 fewer marbles than Kyle took (3 < 5), so Colby took 3 marbles from Griffin.  Finally, we are told that Griffin had 27 marbles in total. So, let's add up how many marbles each child has:  Kyle has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. Billy has 10 marbles. Colby has 3 marbles. And Griffin has 27 - 8 - 10 - 3 = 6 marbles.  Since Griffin has 6 marbles and Ginger gave him some of his own marbles back, we can deduce that Ginger gave Griffin 6 - 3 = 3 marbles.  Therefore, the correct answer is 3.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 slimy fish in one aquarium and 32 slimy fish in another aquarium. The difference between the number of slimy fish in both aquariums is double the number of fish in one aquarium. If they have the same number of fish, then we can set up an equation based on this information.  Let x represent the number of fish in one aquarium. Since the difference between the two numbers is double x, we can write:  
x + (double x) = 32  Simplifying the equation:  
2x + x = 32  
3x = 32  
x = 10  Therefore, there are 10 fish in each aquarium."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much time Jeans will spend doing makeup for each day of shooting. We know that she spends 6 hours per day and needs to repeat this process 4 times a week (Monday through Thursday). So, in total, she will spend 6 x 4 = 24 hours per week. Now, let's calculate how much money Jeans will earn for her work on the film. We know that she charges $250 per hour and works for 24 hours per week. Therefore, her weekly income would be: 24 hours/week x $250/hour = $6,000/week. Since the film shoots for 5 weeks, Jeans' total earnings for the project would be: $6,000/week x 5 weeks = $30,000. Finally, as promised, the makeup artist gives Jeans a 10% bonus for the large amount of work involved. So, Jeans' final payment would be: $30,000 x 10% = $3,000. Therefore, the correct answer is: $30,000 + $3,000 = $33,000.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each person paid for the party supplies.  We know that Isabella spent $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98 on party supplies. Since there are three people involved (Isabella and both of her parents), we can divide the cost equally among them: $98 / 3 = $32 per person.  So, each person paid $32 for the party supplies.
Response:  First, we know that each vrecko (bulb) costs 1.5 dollars. So if the chef bought 4 vrecks, he paid $4 x 1.5 = $6 for all of them. But wait! We also know that each vreck weighs 50 pounds. So if the chef bought 4 vrecks, he paid $6 for 4 x 50 = 200 pounds of onions!
Response:  First, we know that Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister on Monday (4 x 5 = 20). On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister (2 x 5 = 10), so in total, Sue ate 20 + 10 = 30 cookies.  Her sister ate five cookies on Monday and ten cookies on Tuesday, for a total of 5 + 10 = 15 cookies.  So, Sue ate more calories than her sister if they both ate one sundae with 200 calories. The difference is:  30 - 15 = 15 calories.
