"Response:  To calculate how much money Janet makes from selling eggs at the farmer's market, we need to know how many eggs she sells and at what price. Let's assume that she sells all 16 eggs every day at $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily income from egg sales would be:  

16 x $2 = $32 per day

Since she sells eggs every day, her weekly income from egg sales would be:  

$32 x 7 = $224 per week

So, Janet makes $224 per week from selling eggs at the farmer's market."

Response:  If Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs, then he invested a total of $130,000 in the house ($80,000 + $50,000). If the value of the house increased by 150%, then the current value of the house is $260,000 (150% of $130,000). Therefore, Josh made a profit of $130,000 - $80,000 = $50,000.
Response:  To calculate how many meters James runs per week, we need to know his distance per sprint and the number of sprints he does per week. Let's assume that each sprint is 60 meters long (as given in the problem statement). Therefore, if James does 3 sprints per day, he runs a total of 180 meters per day (3 x 60 = 180). Since there are 7 days in a week, James runs a total of 1260 meters per week (180 x 7 = 1260).
Response:  To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens at the last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total number of cups of feed she gives to her chickens per day and then divide that by the number of chickens she has. Let's start by calculating the total number of cups of feed Wendi gives to her chickens per day:  3 x 15 (morning) + 25 (afternoon) = 75 cups of feed per day. Now, let's divide that by the number of chickens she has: 75 cups / 20 chickens = 3.75 cups per chicken. So, Wendi needs to give each of her chickens 3.75 cups of feed at the last meal of the day.
"Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 sklenic, we need to calculate the total cost of all the sklenic first. Since each second sklenica costs 60% of the price of the first one, we can use the following formula:  
Total Cost = (Number of Sklenic x Price of First Sklenica) + (Number of Sklenic x Price of Second Sklenica)  
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  
Total Cost = ($5 x 16) + ($5 x 4/2)  
= $80 + $20  
= $100  
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $100 for 16 sklenic."
Response:  Let's use variables to represent the number of sheep each city has: T = Toulouse, C = Charleston, and S = Seattle. We know that T = 2C and C = 4S. Using these equations, we can set up an equation for the total number of sheep: T + C + S =?  Now substitute the values we know: T + C + S = (2C) + C + (4S) = 2C + C + 4S = 6C + 4S. Since Seattle has 20 sheep, we know that S = 20. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get: T + C + S = 6C + 4(20) = 6C + 80 = 72. Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together have 72 sheep.
Response:  To calculate how long it will take to download the file, we need to know the total size of the file (200 GB) and the rate at which Carla can download files (2 GB/min). We also need to account for the time spent on installing updates (20 minutes), which will cause Carla to restart the download from the beginning. Using this information, we can calculate the total time required to download the file as follows: Total time = (Total size / Download rate) + Installation time Total time = (200 GB / 2 GB/min) + 20 min Total time = 100 min + 20 min Total time = 120 min Therefore, it will take Carla approximately 120 minutes (or 2 hours) to download the 200 GB file, assuming that she can maintain a constant downloading speed of 2 GB/min and there are no other interruptions or delays during the download process.
Response:  The distance from home to the destination is 120 miles (60 x 2 + 30).
"Response:  To calculate how much Eliza will earn for this week, we need to first calculate her regular hourly wage for the first 40 hours she worked. We know that she is paid $10 per hour for those hours. Therefore, her regular hourly wage for the first 40 hours is:  
Regular hourly wage = $10/hour x 40 hours = $400  
Next, we need to calculate her overtime pay for the remaining 5 hours she worked. We know that she is paid 1.2 times her regular hourly wage for overtime hours. Therefore, her overtime pay for the last 5 hours is:  
Overtime pay = $400 x 1.2 = $480  
Now, let's add up both amounts to find out how much Eliza earned for this week:  
Total earnings = Regular hourly wage + Overtime pay = $400 + $480 = $880"

2. Mini cupcakes (2 tucty x $80/tucet) = $160  
3. Mini cheesecakes (6 tucty x $55/tucet) = $330  
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $794"
Response:  To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to subtract the annual expenses (3 dollars) from the revenue generated by the tree (7 lemons x 1.5 dollars per lemon = 10.5 dollars). This gives us a net income of 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 dollars per year. Since the cost of the tree is 90 dollars, it will take approximately 90 / 7.5 = 12 years for Carlos to break even and start making a profit.
Response:  Melanie had 8 vysavačů at the beginning.
"Response:  To find out how many percent of all students are enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to add up the percentage of students who are currently enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance and subtract that amount from 100%.  The calculation is as follows:  
(20% x 20) + (25% x 80) = 400 + 200 = 600  
600 / 30 = 20  
Therefore, 20% of all students are enrolled in hip-hop dance."
Response:  To maximize profit at the end of the month, the merchant should choose the electronic devices option (Option B) with a value of $8000, as it is expected to have a higher growth rate of 1.2% compared to the jewelry option (Option A) with a value of $5000 and a lower growth rate of 2.5%.

"Response:  To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to first determine how many hours she works per week as an instructor and then multiply that by her hourly wage. Let's assume she works 35 hours per week as an instructor.  

Jill's weekly earnings as an instructor = $20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week  
Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings as a coach.  
Jill's weekly earnings as a coach = $30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week  
Now, let's add up her weekly earnings from both jobs to get her total weekly income.  
Total weekly income = $700 + $450 = $1,150/week  
Finally, to find out Jill's annual salary, we can multiply her weekly income by the number of weeks she works in a year (which is 50 weeks).  
Annual salary = $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year"

"Response:  To find out how many pizza boxes Marie ordered, we need to subtract the cost of all the other items from the total amount she paid. We can do this by using subtraction.  
$50 - $12 - $3 - $1.50 = $33.50  
Since each pizza box costs $8.50, we can divide the remaining amount by the price of one box to find out how many boxes Marie bought.  
$33.50 ÷ $8.50 = 4 boxes  
Therefore, Marie bought 4 pizza boxes."
"Response:  To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothes, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up. The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50, so the total cost of three pairs of shorts is:  
$16.50 x 3 = $49.50  
The cost of one pair of tights is $22.50, so the total cost of three pairs of tights is:  
$22.50 x 3 = $67.50  
The cost of one pair of boots is $42, so the total cost of three pairs of boots is:  
$42 x 3 = $126  
Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:  
$49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243  
Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothes."
Response:  To calculate how much Cynthia will spend on frozen yogurt over 60 days, we need to know how many cups she buys each day and at what price. Let's assume she buys one cup of frozen yogurt every evening at $4 per cup. Therefore, her daily expense on frozen yogurt is: Daily Expense = Number of Cups x Price per Cup Daily Expense = 1 x $4 = $4 per day Since there are 30 days in April and 30 days in May, Cynthia will buy frozen yogurt for 60 days in total: Total Days = 30 + 30 = 60 days Total Expense = Daily Expense x Total Days Total Expense = $4 x 60 = $240 So, Cynthia will spend $240 on frozen yogurt over 60 days.
Response:  The distance between the first and second stops is 35 miles (20 + 15).

"Response:  To find the average of the estimates given by Gunter's friends, we need to first convert each estimate into a numerical value. Let's do that:

1. First friend said there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. So, we have:

80 = x (where x is the number of jelly beans)

2. Second friend said that 20 is more than half of the first friend's estimate. So, we can set up an equation based on that:

x / 2 > 20

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x > 40

3. Third friend said that their estimate is 25% more than the first friend's estimate. So, we can calculate their estimate as follows:

x + (25% of x) = x + (25/100)x
= x + 0.25x
= 1.25x

Now, let's add all these equations together to find the average of the three estimates:

(1.25x + 40 + x) / 3 = (1.25x + 40 + x) / 3
= 1.25x + 40 + x / 3
= 1.25x + 40 + 20
= 1.95x + 60

So, the average of Gunter's friends' estimates is approximately 1.95 times the actual number of jelly beans in the jar, which is equal to 60. Therefore, the estimated number of jelly beans in the jar is:

60 = 1.95(x)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, the correct answer is 31 jelly beans in the jar."
"Response:  To calculate how many hours per week John spends caring for his ten dogs, we need to know that each dog requires half an hour of care and attention daily. Therefore, the total number of hours spent on caring for all ten dogs would be:  
10 dogs x 0.5 hours/dog/day = 5 hours/day  
Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours spent on caring for the dogs per week is:  
5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week"
"Response:  Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's say she has x silver coins. Then, she has 30 + x gold coins. The total number of coins is 110. So we can set up the equation:  
x + (30 + x) = 110  
Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 30 = 110  
Subtracting 30 from both sides:  
2x = 80  
Dividing by 2:  
x = 40  
So Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 30 + 40 = 70 gold coins."
Response:  Siobhan has 36 diamonds (2 x 18 = 36).
"Response:  To find out how many points Mike scored in total, we need to calculate his score for each of the two periods and then add them up. For the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points, so:  
Mike's score for the first 20 minutes = 4 points. For the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than in the first period, so:  
Mike's score for the second period = (4 x 1.25) = 5 points. Therefore, Mike's total score is:  
Total score = Mike's score for the first period + Mike's score for the second period = 4 + 5 = 9 points."
Response:  If Terry buys two yogurts daily at $5 for 4 yogurts and consumes them for 30 days, he will spend $5 x 2 = $10 per day, or $10 x 30 = $300 for 30 days.
Response:  John has $5 left after buying video games with the money he got from selling his Lego sets. If he sold each Lego set for $15 and had 13 sets, then he would have made $195 ($15 x 13). After buying 8 video games at $20 each, he spent $160. So, he has $5 left ($195 - $160 = $5). Therefore, John has 7 Lego sets left ($195 / $15 = 7).
Response:  To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his running speed for each day and then average it out. Let's break down his weekly distance into daily distances: Day 1: 3 hours x 10 km/h = 30 km Day 2: 2 hours x 10 km/h = 20 km Day 3: 2 hours x 5 km/h = 10 km Total weekly distance: 30 + 20 + 10 = 60 km Since John runs for 3 days a week, his weekly running distance is 60 km / 3 days = 20 km/day Now, let's calculate his average running speed: 20 km/day / 3 hours per day = 6.67 km/hour So, John runs at an average speed of 6.67 km/hour.
Response:  To find out how many kilometers Dana can travel in 6 hours if she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking, we need to first calculate how far she can run in an hour and then multiply that by the number of hours she has available. Since she can run at a speed of 3 miles per hour (mpH), we know that she can cover 3 x 12 = 36 miles in an hour while running. However, since she only runs for one-third of the time, she will actually cover 36 / 3 = 12 miles in each hour that she spends running. Therefore, the total distance she covers in 6 hours is 12 x 6 = 72 miles.

Response:  To determine how many grams of pasta you can eat while staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories and having already consumed 1800 calories, we need to calculate the remaining calories available for consumption. Let's use the nutritional information provided in the question: A 300g bag of pasta contains 5 portions, each with 250 calories per portion. This means that if you consume all 5 portions, you will have consumed a total of 250 x 5 = 1250 calories from the pasta alone. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, you have 1800 - 1250 = 550 calories remaining for the rest of your meal. To convert this amount of calories into grams, we know that there are approximately 4 calories per gram, so: 550 calories / 4 calories/gram = approximately 137.5 grams (rounded to the nearest whole number) Therefore, based on the given information, you could safely consume approximately 137.5 grams of pasta while staying within your daily calorie goal.
Response:  To find Charlie's pure profit from selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of producing and selling them first. The cost of half a kilogram of beeswax and a clay mold is $10. Since each candle requires half a kilogram of wax, the cost of making one candle is $5 (half of $10). Therefore, the total cost of making 20 candles is $100 (20 x $5). If Charlie sells each candle for $2, his total revenue from selling 20 candles is $40 (20 x $2). His pure profit is therefore $30 ($100 - $40).
Response:  To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles during those three days, we need to first determine how many articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it took her to write one article. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles and each article took her 4 hours to write. This means she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing on Monday.  On Tuesday, Meredith wrote twice as many articles as she did on Monday (i.e., 2 x 5 = 10 articles). Since each article still takes her 4 hours to write, she spent 10 x 4 = 40 hours writing on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, Meredith wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday (i.e., 2 x 10 = 20 articles). Again, since each article takes her 4 hours to write, she spent 20 x 4 = 80 hours writing on Wednesday.  Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles during those three days is:  Total hours = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 hours.
Response:  There were 23 Post-it poznámky in the package that Candice purchased if she had 220 different cups of coffee and placed one poznámka on each cup.
Response:  To find out how much John spent on red scarves, we can use the information that he bought twice as many red scarves as blue ones and that the price of red scarves is 50% more than the price of blue scarves. Let's say he bought x red scarves and 2x blue scarves (since he bought twice as many blue scarves). We know that the total cost of all scarves was $200.  First, let's calculate the cost of the blue scarves:  2x(40) = 80x  Now, let's calculate the cost of the red scarves:   x(1.5)(60) = 90x  Since the total cost of all scarves is $200, we can set up the equation:  80x + 90x = 200  Simplifying this equation, we get:  170x = 200  Solving for x, we get:  x = 11  So, John spent $11 on each red scarf and $80 on each blue scarf, for a total of $11 \* 2 + $80 \* 2 = $232.
Response:  To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy received, we need to divide the total length of wire (4 feet) by the length of each piece (15 cm). We can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying it by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot): 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Now, we can divide 48 inches by 15 cm/piece: 48 / 15 = 3. So, Tracy received 3 pieces of wire.
Response:  There are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, there are 3 x 15 = 45 occupied units. Therefore, there are 15 - 45 = 9 vacant units in the building.
"Response:  To find out how much money Lloyd will make from selling eggs in a week, we need to multiply the number of eggs he produces per day by the number of days in a week.  Therefore, the calculation is as follows:  
252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week  
Since each egg costs $2, the total revenue for the week would be:  
1,764 eggs x $2/egg = $3,528  
Therefore, Lloyd will make $3,528 in one week from selling eggs."
Response:  To calculate how long it will take for the boat to return, we need to know its speed and distance traveled. Let's assume that the boat travels at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour (mph) during both legs of its journey. The total distance traveled by the boat is 4 x 10 = 40 miles. Therefore, the time taken for the outward journey would be: Time = Distance / Speed = 40 miles / 10 mph = 4 hours. Since the boat returns at a speed of 6 mph, the time taken for the return journey would be: Time = Distance / Speed = 40 miles / 6 mph = 6.7 hours. So, in total, the boat will take 4 + 6.7 = 10.7 hours to complete both journeys.
"Response:  To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we need to subtract the weight of the comics from the total weight of his backpack. Let's do that:  
Total weight = 15 pounds (given)  
Weight of each comic book = 1/4 kilogram (given)  
Number of comic books = 30 (given)  
So, the total weight of comic books = Number of comic books x Weight per book = 30 x 1/4 kg = 7.5 kg  
Now, let's subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight of the backpack:  
Total weight - Weight of comic books = 15 lb - 7.5 kg = 7.5 lb  
Therefore, he needs to remove 7.5 pounds (or approximately 3.4 kg) of toys from his backpack."
Response:  The mechanic earned $60 x 6 = $360 for repairing six tires of heavy-duty trucks and $40 x 4 = $160 for repairing four tires of cars, for a total of $360 + $160 = $520 in one day with higher earnings.

Response:  To calculate how much Janet paid for the bracelet and insurance, we need to first calculate the cost of the materials and the craftsmanship separately. Then, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost. Finally, we multiply that amount by 1.1 (10% increase) to find out how much she paid after adding the insurance premium. Here's the calculation: Cost of materials = $500 Cost of craftsmanship = $800 Total cost = $500 + $800 = $1300 Insurance premium = 10% of $1300 = $130 So, Janet paid $1300 for the bracelet and $130 for the insurance, for a total of $1430.
"Response:  If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000 after 20 years, her annual pension after 30 years will be:  

$50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^(30 - 20) = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^10 = $78,697."
"Response:  To calculate the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to first find out how much she paid in the first half of the year and then add that amount to what she paid in the second half of the year. Let's assume that the initial payment for the first half of the year was $70 (140 x 0.5). So, the total amount she paid in the first half of the year is: 

$70 + ($140 x 0.9) = $70 + ($126) = $196

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is: 

$196 + ($140 x 0.5) = $196 + ($70) = $266"
Response:  To determine how far Sophia can drive with one tank of gasoline, we need to divide the amount of gasoline in her car's tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gasoline she used for her last trip (4 gallons). This gives us a total distance driven = 12 gallons / 4 gallons = 3 times as much as she drove last time. Since she drove 160 kilometers last time, Sophia can drive 3 x 160 km = 480 kilometers on one tank of gasoline.
Response:  To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading per week, we need to calculate the total time he spends doing each activity. Let's start with his TV-watching habit:  Jim watches TV for 2 hours per day (3 times a week), which is equal to 6 hours per week (2 x 3 = 6). Now, let's add this to the time he spends reading:  Since Jim reads for half of the time he spends watching TV, he reads for 6/2 = 3 hours per week. Therefore, Jim spends 3 hours per week reading and 6 hours per week watching TV.
Response:  There are 4 schools x 2 teams per school (1 team for girls and 1 team for boys) = 8 teams in total. Each team has 5 players, so there are 8 x 5 = 40 players in total. Additionally, each school sent one coach for each team, so there are 4 schools x 2 coaches per school = 8 coaches in total. Therefore, all together, there were 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people from all the schools who participated in the basketball tournament.
Response:  There were 175 + 35 = 210 precious stones in the chest.

"Response:  To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the number of days in the first 180 days and then multiply that by the number of meals per day and the number of meals per bag. Let's start with calculating the number of days in the first 180 days:  

Days = (180 / 365) x 365 = 179 days  
Now let's calculate the total number of meals for the first 180 days:  
Total Meals = Number of Meals Per Day x Days  
Total Meals = 1 x 179 = 179 meals  
Finally, let's calculate the number of bags of dog food needed for the first 180 days:  
Number of Bags = Total Meals / Number of Meals Per Bag  
Number of Bags = 179 / 110 = approximately 1.62 bags  
So, Cecilia will use approximately 1.62 bags of dog food in the first year."

"Response:  To find out how many rajčata Freda used, we need to know that each plechovka contains three rajčata and that the last batch of omáčka had 32 uncies of omáčka. We can set up a proportion to represent this information:

Let x be the number of rajčata in one plechovka (x = 3)
Let y be the number of rajčata Freda used (y =?)

We know that Freda used half of the total amount of rajčat in the last batch of omáčka:

Half of 32 uncies is 16 uncies (since 1 uncia = 0.5 liters)

So, Freda used 16 uncies of rajčat:

y = 16

Now we can solve for x:

x = 16 / 3

x = 5

Therefore, Freda used 5 plechovek of rajčat."

For the first box:  V1 = 5 × 6 × 4 = 120 cubic centimeters (cm³)  For the second box:  V2 = 6 × 8 × 4 = 224 cm³  For the third box:  V3 = 7 × 9 × 4 = 324 cm³  Total volume of all three boxes:  Vtotal = V1 + V2 + V3 = 120 + 224 + 324 = 668 cm³
"Response:  If Frankie watched 7 hours of television in total and watched 1 hour of his favorite program each night from Monday to Thursday, he watched 4 hours of his favorite program (1 hour x 4 nights). On Wednesday, he also watched some 30-minute episodes, but we don't know how many. So, if we subtract the 4 hours he watched on Monday through Thursday from the total number of hours he watched, we get:  

Total hours watched - Hours watched on Monday through Thursday = Number of hours watched on Wednesday  

Total hours watched - 4 hours = X hours  

where X is the number of hours watched on Wednesday. We can solve for X as follows:  

X = Total hours watched - 4 hours  
= 7 hours - 4 hours  
= 3 hours  

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 hours of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."

On the second day, the total number of vehicles increased by 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can set up the following equation:  
Number of containers = Total number of vehicles / Number of vehicles per container  
Number of containers = 20 / 5  
Number of containers = 4  
Therefore, 4 containers were brought in on the second day."
Response:  To calculate the total salary that both Adrien and Lylah received four years later, we need to know their initial salaries and the percentage increase in their salaries over time. Let's assume that Adrien's initial salary was $60,000 and Lylah's initial salary was $50,000. According to the problem statement, Adrien's salary increased by 40% after four years, while Lylah's salary increased by 30%. Therefore, Adrien's new salary can be calculated as follows: New Salary = Initial Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase) Where: Percentage Increase = 40% Initial Salary = $60,000 New Salary = $60,000 x (1 + 0.40) = $84,000 Now, let's calculate Lylah's new salary using the same formula: New Salary = Initial Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase) Where: Percentage Increase = 30% Initial Salary = $50,000 New Salary = $50,000 x (1 + 0.30) = $65,000 So, four years later, Adrien earned $84,000, and Lylah earned $65,000.
Response:  If Miguel uses two blocks of paper per week and each block contains 30 sheets of paper, then he will use 60 sheets of paper per week (2 x 30). To calculate how many sheets of paper he will use per month, we need to multiply the number of weeks in a month by the number of sheets used per week. There are 4 weeks in a typical month, so Miguel will use 60 x 4 = 240 sheets of paper per month.

Response:  If Sadie slept for eight hours on Monday and two fewer hours each of the next two days, she slept for a total of (8 + 6 + 4) = 18 hours in those three days. To find out how many hours she slept in the entire week, we need to add this amount to her sleep time for the remaining four days of the week. Since she slept one hour more each day than she did during the first three days, she slept for an additional (4 + 5 + 6 + 7) = 22 hours over these four days. Therefore, Sadie slept for a total of 18 + 22 = 40 hours throughout the week.
"Response:  To find out how many kilometers Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to first calculate her speed in kilometers per hour (km/h). We know that she runs at a speed of 8 km/h for one hour, so her average speed for one hour is:  
average speed = total distance / time taken = 8 km / 1 h = 8 km/h Now, we want to find out how far Rosie can run in 7 hours. We know that she runs for 3 hours at a speed of 8 km/h, so she covers a distance of:  
distance covered in 3 hours = speed x time = 8 km/h x 3 h = 24 km In addition to this, she has 7 - 3 = 4 more hours to run. Since she maintains the same speed throughout, she covers an additional distance of:  
distance covered in remaining 4 hours = speed x time = 8 km/h x 4 h = 32 km Therefore, the total distance Rosie can cover in 7 hours is:  
total distance = distance covered in 3 hours + distance covered in remaining 4 hours = 24 km + 32 km = 56 km So, Rosie can run 56 kilometers in 7 hours."

* Melons: 4 x $3 = $12
* Paprikas: 20 x $15 = $300
* Pomeranches: $150

Total cost: $300 + $150 + $12 = $562

Therefore, Dillon will spend $562 on his groceries."

Response:  To find out how many ananas John can harvest in one year, we need to calculate how many ananas he can harvest per month and then multiply that by 12 months. Since each hectare of his field has 100 ananas plants, and each plant produces 10 ananas fruits, John can harvest 10 x 100 = 1,000 ananas fruits per hectare per month. Therefore, for 10 hectares of land, John can harvest 1,000 x 10 = 10,000 ananas fruits per month. Multiplying this number by 12 gives us the total number of ananas fruits John can harvest in one year: 10,000 x 12 = 120,000 ananas fruits per year.

Response:  If Jackie pays for the accountant herself, she will have to work 3 hours less on her own time and lose $35 per hour of unpaid income, resulting in a total loss of $105 ($35 x 3 hours). However, if she hires an accountant, she will pay $90 and avoid losing $105. Therefore, by hiring an accountant, Jackie will save $15 ($105 - $90).
Response:  The total cost of the computer and its accessories is 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1323 euros. Subtracting this amount from the original budget of 1500 euros leaves Elvira with 1500 - 1323 = 177 euros for oblečení.
"Response:  To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit her daughter in order to collect 15 Spanish flans for the school fundraiser, we need to divide the number of flans she needs by the number of eggs required per flan. We know that each flan requires 3 eggs, so:  
15 flans x 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs  
Since Sandra's mother gives her a basket with 9 eggs every time she watches her daughter, we can calculate how many times Sandra needs to babysit as follows:  
45 eggs / 9 eggs/basket = 5 baskets  
Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit her daughter 5 times to collect enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans."

Response:  To calculate how much Jessica will pay for each month and for a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment, we need to first find out what her minimum payments are for each debt.  For her student loans, the minimum payment is $300 per month or $3600 per year (12 x $300).  For her credit card, the minimum payment is $200 per month or $2400 per year (12 x $200).  For her mortgage, the minimum payment is $500 per month or $6000 per year (12 x $500).  If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she would pay an additional 50% of the minimum payment amount.  Therefore, her total monthly payment for all three debts would be: Student Loans: $300 + ($300 x 50%) = $300 + $150 = $450 Credit Card: $200 + ($200 x 50%) = $200 + $100 = $300 Mortgage: $500 + ($500 x 50%) = $500 + $250 = $750 Total Monthly Payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500 Per year, this would be: $1500 x 12 = $18,000 So, if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum payment for all of her debts, she will pay $18,000 in one year.
"Response:  To calculate how long it will take Billy to prepare the potatoes for the barbecue, we need to know the number of potatoes he has (60) and the time it takes him to peel and cut each one. We can start by breaking down the process into two tasks: peeling and cutting. Let's assume that peeling a potato takes half as much time as cutting it. Therefore, if Billy spends 1.5 minutes peeling a potato, he spends 3 minutes cutting it. Now, let's calculate the total time it will take Billy to prepare all 60 potatoes:

Peeling:

* Time per potato = 1.5 minutes
* Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes

Cutting:

* Time per potato = 3 minutes
* Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 x 3 = 180 minutes

Total time:

* Total time = 90 + 180 = 270 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 4.5 hours (270 / 60) to prepare all 60 potatoes for the barbecue."
Response:  To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to divide their total revenue by the price of each glass of lemonade. We know that they sold 20 glasses of lemonade for $10, so the price of one glass is $10/20 = $0.50 per glass. Since they had a profit of $25 - $10 = $15, they must have spent $15 / $0.50 = $30 on lemons.
Response:  There are 60 - 80 = 40 girls in the Chinese team.

"Response:  To find out how many crabs all three people have together, we need to add up their individual amounts of crabs.  Rani has 10 more than Monica, so Monica has 40 - 10 = 30 crabs.  Bo has 40 crabs.  Therefore, all three people together have:  
30 + 40 + (10 more than Monica) = 30 + 40 + 10 = 80 crabs."
Response:  For the first two weeks, Lloyd earned $5 x 5 = $25 in week one and $5 x 8 = $40 in week two, for a total of $65.
"Response:  If the winner received 3/4 of the votes and the total number of students who voted in the class was 80, then the number of votes received by the loser can be calculated as follows:  
Let x be the number of votes received by the loser. Since the winner received 3/4 of the votes, the number of votes received by the winner is 3/4x. The sum of the votes received by both candidates is equal to the total number of voters, so we have:  
3/4x + x = 80  
2x = 64  
x = 32  
Therefore, the loser received 32 votes."
"Response:  To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver to Sandra by five o'clock, we need to divide the number of red roses she ordered (4 times as many as white carnations) by the number of white carnations she ordered. We know that she ordered 5 times as many white carnations as bílých karafiátů, so let's start with that information:

Number of white carnations = 5 x Number of bílých karafiátů
= 5 x 100
= 500

Now, we can calculate the number of red roses she ordered:

Number of red roses = 4 x Number of white carnations
= 4 x 500
= 2000

Finally, we can find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver by dividing the total number of red roses by the time remaining until five o'clock:

Number of red roses needed = Total number of red roses / Time remaining
= 2000 / 3 hours
= 667

Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 667 red roses to Sandra by five o'clock to avoid her losing her job."
Response:  If Mark was five years older than Jan two years ago and Jan is currently 30 years old, then we can set up an equation to represent this information. Let's say that Mark's age two years ago was M - 5, and Jan's age at that time was J. We know that Mark is now three years older than Jan, so we can write:  M = J + 3. Substituting for J in terms of Mark's age two years ago gives us:  M = (M - 5) + 3. Solving for M, we get:  M = 31. Therefore, Jean is 31 years old.

"Response:  The merchant sold 200 pytels of wheat because if he had sold each pytel for $30 and had a total profit of $400, then the number of pytels sold would be:  

$400 = (number of pytels x price per pytel) + ($2 x number of pytels) 

$400 = (number of pytels x $30) + ($2 x number of pytels) 

$400 = (number of pytels x $30) + $2(number of pytels) 

$400 = (number of pytels x $30) + $2(200) 

$400 = (number of pytels x $30) + $400 

$400 = (number of pytels x $30) + $600 - $400 

$400 = (number of pytels x $30) + $200 

Solving for the number of pytels, we get: 

Number of pytels = $400 / ($30 x 1) + $200 

Number of pytels = 200 

Therefore, the merchant sold 200 pytels of wheat."
"Response:  To find out how much each person will pay, we need to first calculate the total cost of all expenses. Let's break down the costs:

1. Admission tickets: $20 x 3 = $60
2. Food: $4.50 x 3 = $13.50
3. Transportation (2 rides): $33 x 2 = $66
Total cost: $60 + $13.50 + $66 = $140

Since there are three people, they will split the cost equally: $140 / 3 = $46.67 per person."

Response:  Elaine has 64 Pokémon cards now.
Response:  To calculate how much Mark will earn in one week from both publishers, we need to multiply the number of sentences he edits for each publisher by their respective payment rates. For Publisher A, Mark earns 5 cents per sentence x 1000 sentences = $50. For Publisher B, Mark earns twice as much as for Publisher A, so he earns 2 x $50 = $100. Therefore, Mark's total earnings for one week are $50 + $100 = $150.
Response:  To calculate how many liters of water Baldur will receive each day, we need to multiply the number of wells he draws from (5 in the morning and 6 in the afternoon) by the amount of water in each well (5 liters).

$2000 x 52 (weeks) + $5000 = $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000

So, John's total earnings for the year would be $109,000."
"Response:  To find out how many barrels of wine are produced by Josie's farm per year, we need to multiply the number of tons of grapes produced per acre by the number of acres she has and then divide that result by 2 (since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine). So, if her farm produces 5 tons of grapes per acre and she has 10 acres, then the total production would be:  
5 tons/acre x 10 acres = 50 tons  
Since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, the total production of wine would be:  
50 tons / 2 barrels/ton = 25 barrels/year"

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448  
448 - 71 = 377  
377 / 5 = 75.4  
Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us 76. Therefore, Brinley needs to score at least 76 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"Response:  To calculate the total distance traveled by Michael during the eight weeks, we need to first determine how many kilometers he rode each week and then multiply that number by the number of weeks he rode.  We know that for four weeks, Michael rode five times per week (25 km/day x 5 days/week = 125 km/week), and for the remaining four weeks, he rode twice as much (60 km/day x 2 days/week = 120 km/week). Therefore, the total distance Michael traveled is:  
125 km/week x 4 weeks + 120 km/week x 3 weeks = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km"
Response:  To find out how much Joe's bag of candies weighs in grams, we need to first calculate the total weight of all the chocolate truffles and then add the weight of all the sugar cubes. Let's start by calculating the weight of one chocolate truffle: 1 chocolate truffle = 2 x 40 g (since each chocolate truffle is twice as heavy as each sugar cube) = 80 g Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the chocolate truffles: Total weight of chocolate truffles = Number of chocolate truffles x Weight of one chocolate truffle 25 x 80 g = 2000 g Finally, let's calculate the weight of all the sugar cubes: Total weight of sugar cubes = Number of sugar cubes x Weight of one sugar cube 80 x 40 g = 3200 g Now that we have the weights of both types of candies, we can add them up to get the total weight of Joe's bag of candies: Total weight of Joe's bag of candies = Total weight of chocolate truffles + Total weight of sugar cubes 2000 g + 3200 g = 5200 g So, Joe's bag of candies weighs 5200 grams or 5.2 kilograms.

"Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn enough money for the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to spend. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of boots costs $20, so the total cost is:  
$30 + $20 x 2 = $30 + $40 = $70  
Sara has saved $10, so she needs to earn an additional $60 ($70 - $10). Since she gets paid $5 for each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn:  
$60 / $5 = 12 times  
Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 12 times to earn enough money for the jacket and shoes."
Response:  Let's say there are x bílých kuřat and y červených kuřat. Since each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5x. Each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3y. Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, so we can set up the equation: 5x + 3y = 42. To find out how many red chickens Jerry has, we can solve for y: 3y = 42 - 5x. Now we need to determine how many white chickens Jerry has. We know that there are more white chickens than red chickens, so we can use the fact that x > y. Substituting this into one of the equations above gives us: 5x + 3y = 42 3y = 42 - 5x 3y = 42 - 5(x) Simplifying and solving for y gives us: 3y = 16  y = 5  So Jerry has 5 white chickens and 3 red chickens.
Response:  To find out how many hours Gary spends walking along the path in the park, we need to divide the distance he walks by his speed:  Distance = Speed x Time  Distance = 1.5 x 6 miles = 9 miles Time = Distance / Speed Time = 9 miles / 5 km/h Time = 1.8 hours Therefore, Gary spends 1.8 hours walking along the path in the park.

Response:  To find out how much Janeth will have left after paying off the loan, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay over the 12-month period. First, let's calculate the monthly payment: $2000 x 165/100 = $330 per month. Next, let's calculate the total amount paid over 12 months: $330 x 12 = $4080. Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the original loan amount to find out how much Janeth will have left: $2000 - $4080 = -$2080 (negative means she will owe money). So, after 12 months, Janeth will still owe $2080.

"Response:  To determine how many minutes Jason has for the month with 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he uses for the month and then subtract that from the total number of minutes in the plan. Let's start by calculating the total number of minutes Jason uses for the month:  
Jason has 15 minutes of calls per day x 30 days = 450 minutes of calls this month.  
Additionally, he had 300 minutes of other calls, so the total number of minutes used is:  
450 + 300 = 750 minutes. Now, let's calculate the number of minutes left for the month:  
Jason has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left for the month. So, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month to use for his calls."
Response:  Ginger gave Griffin 10 hranolky (27 - 5 = 22).
"Response:  Let's say there are x fish in each aquarium. Since the difference between the number of snails in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the following equation based on this information:

x + 4 = 32 / 2 (since there are 4 snails more in the first aquarium than in the second)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 16

So, there are 16 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  To calculate how much Jean paid for her work in the film, we need to know the following information:

* Her hourly rate is $250.
* She works 6 hours per day and 4 days per week (for a total of 24 hours per week).
* The film lasts for 5 weeks (or 5 x 7 = 35 days).
* She receives a 10% discount after completing the film.

To calculate the total amount Jean pays, we can use the formula:

Total Amount = Hourly Rate x Number of Hours Worked x Number of Weeks Worked

In this case, the Total Amount would be:

Total Amount = $250 x 24 x 5 = $15,000

After applying the 10% discount, the final amount Jean pays would be:

Final Amount = $15,000 x 0.9 = $13,500"
Response:  The cost of the party was $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96. Since there are three sides (Isabelle and her two parents), each side paid $96 / 3 = $32.
"Response:  The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds and costing $1.5 per kilogram. To calculate how much the chef spent, multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag in kilograms, then multiply that result by the price per kilogram:

4 bags x 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds
200 pounds x $1.5/pound = $300"
"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the difference between their daily intakes of sušenky. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. On Monday (pondělí), Sue ate four times as much dried fruit as her sister.
2. On Tuesday (úterý), Sue ate twice as much dried fruit as her sister.
3. Her sister ate five dried fruits on Monday and thirteen on Tuesday.
4. Each dried fruit has 200 calories.

Now let's work through the problem step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate Sue's Monday intake
Since Sue ate four times as much dried fruit as her sister on Monday, her intake was 4 x 5 = 20 sušenek.

Step 2: Calculate her sister's Monday intake
Her sister ate five dried fruits on Monday, so her intake was 5 sušenek.

Step 3: Calculate Sue's Tuesday intake
Sue ate twice as much dried fruit as her sister on Tuesday, so her intake was 2 x 13 = 26 sušenek.

Step 4: Calculate her sister's Tuesday intake
Her sister ate thirteen dried fruits on Tuesday, so her intake was 13 sušenek.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of calories consumed by each girl
For Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 sušenek x 200 calories/sušenka = 9200 calories
For her sister: 5 + 13 = 18 sušenek x 200 calories/sušenka = 3600 calories

Step 6: Find the difference in calorie consumption
To do this, subtract the sister's total calorie intake from Sue's total calorie intake:

9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories
