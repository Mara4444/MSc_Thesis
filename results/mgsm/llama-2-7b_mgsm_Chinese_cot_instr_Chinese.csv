"Response:  First, we need to find out how many meters of blue fabric are needed for the shirt. Let's assume that the shirt requires half of the total amount of fabric (since it is described as ""half"" in the problem). So, if the total amount of fabric required is 20 meters, then the blue fabric required would be 10 meters (since 20 / 2 = 10). Now, we need to find out how much white fabric is required. Since the problem states that the white fabric is twice as long as the blue fabric, and the blue fabric requires 10 meters, then the white fabric must also require 10 meters. Therefore, the total amount of fabric required for the shirt is 20 meters (blue) + 20 meters (white) = 40 meters."

Since there is no value given in the problem, the answer is simply ""there isn't one""."
Response: 首先，查尔斯顿的绵羊数量是西雅图的 4 倍，意味著查尔斯顿有 8 只绵羊（4 x 2 = 8）。接下來，图卢兹的绵羊数量是查尔斯顿的 two 倍，意味著图卢兹有 16 只绵羊（2 x 8 = 16）。最後，西雅图有 20 只绵羊。因此，三个城市一起有 20 + 8 + 16 = 34 只绵羊。
"Response:  First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 200 GB of data at a rate of 2 GB per minute:

Time = Total size / Download rate
= 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
= 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes)

Now, we need to account for the restart time caused by Windows updating itself. Let's assume that the update process takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time required to download the file is:

Total time = Time to download + Time to install updates
= 100 minutes + 20 minutes
= 120 minutes (or 2 hours and 5 minutes)

So, in this scenario, it would take approximately 2 hours and 5 minutes to download a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB per minute, assuming Windows forces a reboot during the download process."
Response:  John started his journey at 10 am and traveled for 3 hours before turning back. He then traveled for another 4 hours to reach home, but he spent the first 2 hours of that time stuck in traffic. So, he actually drove for 2 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour and 2 hours at a speed of 80 miles per hour. Therefore, after 4 hours, he was still x miles away from home. Since we know that John started his journey at 10 am, we can conclude that he reached home at 2 pm.
Response:  Weekly hours worked = 45 hours x $10/hour = $450  Standard hourly wage = $12/hour (based on the problem statement) Total weekly earnings = $450 + ($450 x 1.2) = $630 So, Eliza's total weekly earnings are $630.

Response: 假設她买了 3 打甜甜圈，每打 68 美元。 total cost of 3 tarts = 3 x 68 = 204 美元。 Next, she bought 2 mini cupcakes at $80 each. Total cost of 2 mini cupcakes = 2 x 80 = 160 美元。 Finally, she bought 6 mini cheesecakes at $55 each. Total cost of 6 mini cheesecakes = 6 x 55 = 330 美元。 Therefore, the total amount she spent is: 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 美元.
Response:  First, let's calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree for one year:  Total Cost = $90 (planting) + $3 (watering and fertilizing) = $93 per year Now, let's calculate the annual income from the tree: Annual Income = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 per year So, after one year, the total profit would be: Total Profit = $10.5 - $93 = -$82.5 Finally, to find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to divide the initial investment by the annual profit: Years to Break Even = $90 / ($10.5 - $93) = 9 years Therefore, it will take Carlos 9 years to start earning a profit from his lemon tree.

Response:  Firstly, we know that 20% of the students in the dance class are learning modern dance. This means that there are 4 students (20% x 20) who are learning modern dance.  Next, we know that 25% of the remaining students are learning jazz dance. This means that there are 5 students (25% x 75) who are learning jazz dance. Finally, we know that 20% of the remaining students are learning hip-hop dance. This means that there are 4 students (20% x 80) who are learning hip-hop dance. Therefore, a total of 13 students (4 + 5 + 4) are learning hip-hop dance. So, the answer is 13%.
"Response:  Firstly, let's calculate the expected value of the two investments based on their current prices and the predicted market changes:
Expected value of the diamond investment = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,375
Expected value of the electronic product investment = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,464
Now, we need to compare these expected values to determine which investment will provide the highest return by the end of the month. If the merchant chooses to invest in the diamond, they can expect a profit of:
Profit from diamond investment = Expected value of diamond investment - Current price of diamond = $5,375 - $5,000 = $375
On the other hand, if the merchant chooses to invest in the electronic product, they can expect a profit of:
Profit from electronic product investment = Expected value of electronic product investment - Current price of electronic product = $8,464 - $8,000 = $464
Since both investments have the potential for profit, it is not possible to determine which one will provide the maximum gain without additional information. Therefore, the answer is ""none."""

Response:  Mary walked for 1 hour and covered a distance of 4 miles. Then she walked for another hour and covered a distance of 2 miles. To find the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, Mary's speed is 4 miles/hour, so if she wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles/hour, she needs to cover a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 4 miles/hour x (time left) = 4 miles/hour x (12 - 6) = 4 miles/hour x 6 miles = 24 miles. Therefore, Mary needs to walk 24 miles more to reach her destination.
Response:  First, let's calculate the total volume of orange juice in the original 10 cups. Since three-quarters of it is water, we can estimate that the orange juice accounts for 7/8 of the total volume. So, the total volume of orange juice = (3/4) \* 10 cups = 7.5 cups. Now, let's find out how much water is left after pouring one cup of orange juice into 15 cups of strawberry juice. We know that five-thirds of the remaining strawberry juice are water, so the amount of water left = (5/3) \* 9 cups = 6.3 cups. Therefore, there are 7.5 - 6.3 = 1.2 cups of water left in the remaining 24 cups of drink.

"Response: 
Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
The problem states that one candle melts at a rate of 2 mm per hour. The time period is from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
Step 2: Determine how much the candle will melt during each hour.
Since the candle melts at a rate of 2 mm per hour, it will melt 2 mm x 1 = 2 mm during the first hour (from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM).
Step 3: Find out how much the candle will melt overall during the specified time period.
To find out how much the candle will melt overall, we need to multiply the rate at which it melts by the total time period: 2 mm/hour x 4 hours = 8 mm.
Therefore, the answer is 8 mm."
Response:  First, we need to find out how much the book costs now. The problem states that the book was bought for $19.50 last year, which means its current price is 7/5 of that amount. So, if the book cost $x last year, its current price is $x / 7 = 19.50 / 7 = 2.86x. Since x is a whole number, we can round up to the nearest integer, which gives us an approximate answer of $30. However, since the exact price is not given in the problem, we cannot provide an exact answer.

Response:  John has to take care of 10 dogs every day. Each dog needs 0.5 hours for its daily tasks and exercise. How many hours does John have to spend on taking care of the dogs each week? Let's break it down step by step: Daily tasks and exercise per dog = 0.5 hours/dog Weekly time spent on dog care = Number of dogs x Daily tasks and exercise per dog = 10 dogs x 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/week So, John has to spend 5 hours/week taking care of the dogs.
Response:  Gold coins have 110 pieces and silver coins have 80 pieces. How many gold coins does Gregorian have? We can start by using the information that there are more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we divide the number of gold coins by the number of silver coins, we get: Number of gold coins ÷ Number of silver coins = 110 ÷ 80 = 1.375 (round down to nearest whole number) Therefore, Gregorian has 13 gold coins.
Response:  weston has fewer diamonds than Allen by 2 pieces. Allen's diamond number is twice that of Raymond's diamond number. If Raymond has 40 diamonds, how many diamonds does Weston have? Let's think step by step.  Firstly, we know that Allen has more diamonds than Weston by 2 pieces. So, the difference between their numbers of diamonds is 2. Secondly, we know that Allen's number of diamonds is twice that of Raymond's number of diamonds. Therefore, if Raymond has 40 diamonds, Allen has 80 diamonds (twice 40). Finally, since Weston has fewer diamonds than Allen, Weston must have less than 80 diamonds. However, we are not given any information about the exact number of diamonds Weston has, so we cannot determine it exactly.
Response:  first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. So the total score in the first 20 minutes is 4 x 2 = 8.  Now let's calculate the increase in his score after 20 minutes: (25% of 8) / 2 = 1.67. So his new score after 20 minutes is 8 + 1.67 = 9.67. Therefore, his final score is 9.67.
Response:  Triplets 每天吃 2 份酸奶，共 30 天。如果酸奶打折销售，4 份酸奶只需 5.00 美元，那么每天要 spend 5.00 / 4 = 1.25 美元。因此，Triplets 花了 30 x 1.25 = 37.50 美元买酸奶。
Response:  John wants to sell all of his toys and use the money to buy electronic games. He has 13 sets of LEGOs that he can sell for $15 each, so he will have $195 from selling those. Then, he bought 8 electronic games at $20 each, so he spent $160 on those. Finally, he had $5 left over. To find out how many sets of LEGOs John has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the electronic games from the total amount of money he made from selling his toys: $195 - $160 = $35. So, John has 35 sets of LEGOs left.
"Response:  John runs for 60 miles per week. He runs for 3 days a week and each day he runs for half the time of the previous day. So on Monday, he runs for 3 hours; on Tuesday, he runs for 1.5 hours (half of 3 hours); and on Wednesday, he runs for 0.75 hours (half of 1.5 hours). To find out his average running speed, we need to divide the distance he ran by the time it took him to run that distance. In this case, the distance is 60 miles and the time taken is: Monday: 3 hours x 60 miles / 3 hours = 20 miles per hour Tuesday: 1.5 hours x 60 miles / 1.5 hours = 40 miles per hour Wednesday: 0.75 hours x 60 miles / 0.75 hours = 80 miles per hour Therefore, John's average running speed is (20 + 40 + 80) / 3 = 50 miles per hour."
Response: 戴娜每小時可以跳跃 3 英里，那麼在 6 小時的時間里，她可以跑步 18 英里（6 小時 x 3 英里/小時），也就是說她可以跑步 3 個 6 英里的 distance. 但是，問題中說她用三分之一的時間跑步，用三分之二的時間步行，這意味著她在跑步的時間裡面只有一半的時間進行跑步動作，因此她在跑步的時間裡面可以跑 6 英里（3 個 2 英里），而不是 18 英里。 因此，戴娜在 6 小時的時間里完成了 6 + 6 = 12 英里的距禮。

Response:  Firstly, we need to find the distance between Poli and the dragon when she is not holding the blue gemstone. According to the problem, the distance is 400 feet.  Next, we need to find the distance between Poli and the dragon when she is holding the blue gemstone. Let's assume that the distance is x feet.  Now, we can use the information given in the problem to find the value of x. We know that the distance between Poli and the dragon when she is holding the blue gemstone is three times the distance between them when she is not holding it. So, we can write an equation based on this information: x = 3(400) = 1200 feet.  Therefore, if Poli is holding the blue gemstone, she can stand at a distance of 1200 feet from the dragon and hit it with the gold arrow.

Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of carbohydrates in one serving of potato chips. According to the nutrition label, each serving of potato chips contains 250 calories. Since you want to know how many servings of potato chips you can have based on your daily target of 2,000 calories, we will divide the total number of calories in a serving by the daily target. In this case, the calculation would be: Total calories in a serving = 250 calories per serving x Number of servings = 250 calories / 2,000 calories per day = 0.125 servings (or 1/8 of a serving) Now that we know the number of servings in one package of potato chips, we can calculate how much you can eat based on your current intake of 1,800 calories. To do this, we will divide the remaining amount of calories you want to consume (in this case, 400 calories) by the number of servings in the package (which is 0.125 servings). The calculation would be: Remaining calories = 400 calories / 0.125 servings = 3,200 calories So, if you want to stay within your daily target of 2,000 calories and you have already consumed 1,800 calories, you can still eat up to 3,200 calories worth of potato chips, which is equivalent to about 4-5 more servings.
Response: 首先，查理可以制作 10 根蜡烛，因此他需要 10 磅蜂蜡。 secondly，他可以將每根蜡烛售出 2.00 美元，因此他共可以获得 20 美元（10 根蜡烛 x 2.00 美元/根）。 lastly，他的供应成本为 10.00 美元，因此他的净利涤为 10.00 - 20 = - 9.00 美元。  Therefore, the net profit is - 9.00 美元.

Suppose she bought a pack of stickers on her way to work, containing 80 stickers. Then, she gave 220 coffee cups one sticker each at work, leaving 23 cups without stickers. Therefore, how many stickers were in the pack she bought on her way to work? Answer: None.
Response:  John bought twice as many red straps as blue straps. The price of each red strap is $50 more than the price of each blue strap. He spent $200 on each blue strap and $80 on each red strap. How much did he spend in total? Let's break it down step by step: Number of blue straps = Total cost of blue straps = x Number of red straps = Total cost of red straps = 2x Price of each blue strap = $40 Price of each red strap = $130 (since the price of each red strap is $50 more than the price of each blue strap) Now we can use substitution to solve for the total cost: Total cost = Number of blue straps x Price of each blue strap + Number of red straps x Price of each red strap Substituting the values we know: Total cost = x($40) + 2x($130) = $800 Since there are twice as many red straps as blue straps, we can simplify the equation: $800 = x + 2x = 3x = $266.67 This means that John spent a total of $266.67 on both blue and red straps.
Response:  Goldie has a piece of metal wire that is 4 feet long and wants to use it to support tomato plants in her garden. She cuts the wire into smaller sections, each section being 6 inches long. How many sections can she make?  We need to find out how much of the wire Goldie has left after cutting it into sections. Let's do this step by step: 1. Length of the original wire = 4 feet = 48 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot) 2. Number of sections = length of wire / length of each section = 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 sections  So, Goldie can make 8 sections from the original piece of wire.
Response:  Let's think step by step.  There are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 apartments. So, there are 15 x 8 = 120 apartments in total. Now, we need to find out how many of them are unoccupied. The problem says that 3/4 of the apartments have people living in them, which means that 3/4 x 120 = 90 apartments are occupied. Therefore, there are 120 - 90 = 30 unoccupied apartments in the building.
Response: 如果劳埃德每天产生 252 颗蛋，那么每周产生了多少颗蛋？  Weekly production = Daily production x Number of days in a week  Weekly production = 252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week Now, let's calculate how much money Leroy makes from selling eggs per week. If he sells each egg for $2, then his total weekly revenue from selling eggs is: Total weekly revenue = Number of eggs sold/Weekly production x Price per egg Total weekly revenue = 1,764 eggs/week x $2/egg = $3,528/week So, Leroy makes $3,528 per week from selling eggs.
Response:  Tom's boat travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. He sails from 1 pm to 4 pm, which means he covers a distance of 4 x 4 = 16 miles during this time. Then, he turns around and sails back, but now he is sailing in the opposite direction, so his speed is negative. To find out how long it takes him to return, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance he needs to cover is -16 miles, and his speed is -6 miles per hour, so the time it takes him to return is: Time = -16 miles / -6 miles/hour = 2 hours. Therefore, Tom returns after 2 hours.

Response:  Peter plans to go see a movie this week. He always spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn. If he has $42 this week, how many times can he go see the movies? Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Peter has available for buying tickets and popcorn. We know that the total cost of a ticket and popcorn is $14 ($7 + $7). So if Peter has $42, he can buy tickets and popcorn for 3 times ($42 / $14 = 3). Therefore, Peter can go see the movies 3 times this week.
Response:  First, we need to find the total weight of the truck and its cargo. The truck's empty weight is 3,755 pounds, and each box weighs 15 pounds, so there are 250 boxes (3,755 / 15). Now, we need to subtract the driver's weight from the total weight of the truck and its cargo. The driver's weight is 3,000 pounds, so the remaining weight is 250 x 15 = 3,750 pounds. This means that the truck can carry at most 375 boxes.
Response: 首先，史蒂芬購買了生活用品，其中的总额是 40.00 美元。然後，由于这笔訂單通過送货供应商進行，所以他們會加上 25% 的費用，即 10.00 美元（40.00 x 25%）。接下來，他們還需要收取 3.00 美元的送貨費，共計 13.00 美元（10.00 + 3.00）。最後，他加上了 4.00 美元的小費，共計 17.00 美元（13.00 + 4.00）。因此，史蒂芬購買生活用品的最終價格是 17.00 美元。
Response: 首先, 我們知道一处覆盆子树丛中有 6 簇覆盆子，每簇 20 颗。因此，在这些簇覆盆子之间有 6 x 20 = 120 颗覆盆子。接下來，問題提到整个覆盆子树丛还散落着 67 颗覆盆子。這些覆盆子可能是由不同的簇覆盆子掉落或者是从其他地方滲入的。因此，需要加上這些覆盆子的數量。所以，總共有多少颗覆盆子？  Ans：None We can start by considering the number of piles of dumplings in the tree branch. There are 6 piles of dumplings in each cluster, and there are 6 clusters in total. Therefore, the total number of dumplings is 6 x 6 = 36. However, the problem also mentions that there are 67 dumplings scattered throughout the entire tree branch. These additional dumplings may have fallen from other parts of the tree or been introduced from elsewhere. So, to find the total number of dumplings, we need to add these extra ones to the initial count. Thus, the answer is None.
Response:  First, let's think step by step. We know that there are 25 oranges in the basket, and 1 of them is bad (rotten). That means we have 24 good oranges. Now, we need to find out how many of these 24 oranges are sour. The problem says that 20% of the oranges are sour, which means that 4 of them are sour (since 20% of 24 is 4). So, we have 20 good oranges left. Finally, we can calculate the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of sour oranges from the total number of oranges: 24 - 4 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 good oranges in the basket.
Response:  first, we need to calculate the cost of the breast implant material. The problem states that Jenny paid $500 for the breast implant material. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the craftsmanship fee. The problem states that Jenny paid an additional $800 for the craftsmanship fee. Finally, we need to calculate the total amount that Jenny paid, including the insurance premium. According to the problem, Jenny paid a total of $10% of the cost of the breast implant material as an insurance premium. So, if the cost of the breast implant material is $500, then the insurance premium would be $50 (10% of $500). Therefore, the total amount that Jenny paid is $550 ($500 + $80 + $50).
Response:  First, let's calculate the annual retirement benefit for Martha starting from year 40: Annual Retirement Benefit = $50,000 x (1 + 5%)^40 = $768,900 Now, let's calculate the annual retirement benefit for Martha after she retires in year 30: Annual Retirement Benefit = $768,900 / 30 = $25,630 per year So, Martha's total retirement benefit over 30 years is: Total Retirement Benefit = $25,630 x 30 = $768,900 Therefore, Martha's total retirement benefit at age 60 is $768,900.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the initial amount of money that the streaming company will charge Alyssa for the first half of the year. Since the annual fee is $140, and the second half of the year starts in July (which is halfway through the year), the initial amount should be $70 ($140 / 2 = $70). Next, we need to find out how much the company will reduce the fee by for the second half of the year. According to the problem, the reduction is 10%. So, the reduced fee for the second half of the year is $63 ($70 x 90% = $63). Finally, we add both amounts together to get the total amount that Alyssa will pay for the entire year: $70 + $63 = $133. Therefore, the answer is $133.

Response:  Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team, with 5 players on each team. So, the total number of players from all schools is: 5 x 4 = 20 players (10 girls + 10 boys) Now, we need to add the coaches. Each school has one coach for its girls' team and one coach for its boys' team. So, the total number of coaches is: 2 (coaches) And there are 4 schools in total, so the total number of people (players + coaches) is: 20 + 2 = 22 people. Therefore, there are 22 people in total.
Response:  First, let's count the total number of stones in the treasure chest: 175 + 35 = 210 stones. Now, we need to find out how many red stones there are. Since there are twice as many green stones as red stones, if there are x red stones, then there are 2x green stones. So, the total number of stones in the treasure chest is: 210 - (x/2) = 210 - 105 = 105 stones. Therefore, there are 105 red stones in the treasure chest.
Response:  Let's think step by step. According to the problem, there are twice as many male students as female students in Dr. Weitz's school. So, if there are 60 female students, then there are 120 male students (since 2 x 60 = 120). Now, we know that every 5 male students have one teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers is equal to the total number of male students divided by 5. In this case, the number of teachers is 120 / 5 = 24. So, there are 24 teachers in Dr. Weitz's school.
Response:  Weekly income = Total amount of money she will receive / Number of weeks she will receive it for = $5/week x 8 weeks = $40  So, the initial amount of money she received is $40.
Response:  let's see... if she teaches 5 classes per day and 8 classes on Saturday, that means she teaches a total of 13 classes per week (5 + 8 = 13). And if each class has 15 students, then the total number of students she teaches in a week is 13 x 15 = 195 students. Now, if she charges $15 per student per class, then her total weekly income from teaching dance would be 195 students x $15 per student = $2,875 per week.

Response:  Let's think step by step. If the area of each layer is half that of the previous layer, then the area of the top layer must be equal to twice the area of the bottom layer. So, if the bottom layer has an area of x square meters, then the top layer has an area of 2x square meters. Now, we are given that the top layer has an area of 16 square meters. Therefore, the bottom layer must have an area of 8 square meters (since 16 / 2 = 8).
Response:  First year: Day 1 to day 180 (total days = 180)  Daily food amount for the dog: 1 bowl/day (as per veterinarian's advice) Total amount of food needed in first year: 180 x 1 = 180 bowls  Since there are 110 bowls in a bag, we can calculate the number of bags needed as follows: Number of bags = total amount of food / amount of food in each bag = 180 / 110 = 1.63 bags So, Cresselia will use approximately 1.63 bags of dog food in her first year.
"Response:  Let's start by assuming that Remond's laundry weight is half of Sarah's, which means Remond's laundry weight is 4 times David's. If Sarah's laundry weight is 400 pounds, then we can calculate the difference in their laundry weights as follows:
Remond's laundry weight = (Sarah's laundry weight / 2) x 4 = 1600 pounds - 800 pounds = 800 pounds
So, the difference in their laundry weights is 800 pounds."

Response:  John took his dog to the beauty parlor and paid $100 for the service. Since he was a new customer, the beauty parlor gave him a discount of 70%. So how much did John pay for the beauty treatment?  We can start by using the information that the original price of the beauty treatment is $100. If we give a discount of 70%, then the amount John actually paid will be 70% of $100, which is $70. Therefore, John paid $70 for the beauty treatment.

Response:  Let's think step by step. According to the problem, Zhen has three times as many pets as Maria, and Maria has two more pets than Xiaodong. If Xiaodong has four pets, then how many pets do the three people have in total? We can start by using the information that Zhen has three times as many pets as Maria. So, if Maria has x pets, then Zhen has 3x pets. Now, we know that Maria has two more pets than Xiaodong, so Xiaodong has x + 2 pets. Finally, we know that the total number of pets among the three people is equal to the sum of their individual pet numbers. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: 3x + (x + 2) =? The question mark represents the total number of pets among the three people. Can you solve for x now?

"Response:  Lee completed the 400-meter hurdle race in 38 seconds before Jerry changed his diet habits. If Lee took 38 seconds to complete the race, and Jerry improved his diet habits after that, then Jerry's time for completing the same race would be:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Before Jerry changed his diet habits, he took 38 seconds to complete the 400-meter hurdle race.
2. After changing his diet habits, Jerry's speed increased by 10%. So, if he took 38 seconds to complete the race before, he will take (10% of 38) = 3.8 seconds less to complete the race now.
3. Therefore, Jerry's new time for completing the 400-meter hurdle race is: 38 - 3.8 = 34.2 seconds.

So, Jerry needs 34.2 seconds to complete the 400-meter hurdle race after improving his diet habits."
Response:  street area has 30 cats, 40 dogs and 20 birds. If the number of cats is less than the sum of the numbers of dogs and birds by 12, then we can say that the total number of pets in the street area is equal to the number of dogs plus the number of birds minus 12. So, the total number of pets = 40 + 20 - 12 = 78. Therefore, there are 78 pets in the street area.
Response:  first, we need to find out how many girls are not Girl Scouts. Let's assume that the number of girls who are not Girl Scouts is x. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem: Number of boys = 2/5 x Number of girls - 2/3 x Number of Girl Scouts  Now, let's solve for x: Substituting the value 2/5 for the number of boys and using the fact that there are 200 students in total, we get: Number of boys = 2/5 x 200 - 2/3 x x  Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 160  Therefore, there are 160 girls who are not Girl Scouts.

Response:  First, we need to find out how many jars of pickles Freda used in the last batch of pickle sauce. Let's assume each jar contains 3 pickles. Since Freda reduced the amount of pickles by half, she used 3 x 0.5 = 1.5 jars of pickles. Now, let's convert 1.5 jars of pickles to ounces: 1 jar of pickles = 4 oz (since there are 4 pickles in a jar) So, 1.5 jars of pickles = 1.5 x 4 oz = 6 oz. Therefore, Freda used 6 oz of pickles in her last batch of pickle sauce.

Response:  First, let's think about the dimensions of each box. Each box is 5 inches wide, 6 inches long, and 4 inches tall. So, the volume of one box is: Volume = Width x Length x Height = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches. Now, we have three boxes, so the total volume of all three boxes is: Total Volume = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches. Since the walls of the boxes are 1 inch thick, the total volume of all three boxes including the empty space between them is: Total Volume + Empty Space = 360 + (3 x 1) = 370 cubic inches. Therefore, the combined content volume of all three boxes is 370 cubic inches.
Response:  Weekdays (Monday to Friday):  FRANK watches one hour of his favorite program every night after finishing his homework. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one episode each of a 1-hour program. On Wednesday, he watched several episodes of a 30-minute program. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched one hour-long program and one 30-minute program. On Friday, he stayed up late because of the weekend, so he watched two hours-long programs. Total time spent watching TV = 7 hours. Now, let's find out how many episodes Frank watched on Wednesday: We know that Frank watched several episodes of a 30-minute program on Wednesday. Let's assume that he watched x episodes. Since each episode is 30 minutes long, the total time spent watching these episodes is 3x hours. Since Frank spent 7 hours watching TV in total, we can set up the equation: 7 - x + 3x = 0 To solve for x, we can first subtract x from both sides of the equation: 7 - x = -3x Then, we can divide both sides by -3 to get x = 2. So, Frank watched 2 episodes of the 30-minute program on Wednesday.

Response:  Let's think step by step. According to the problem, 玛舍勒 and 毕翠克丝 are competing to see who can eat down the most fruit rolls. They find that there are 24 fruit rolls long and 14 fruit rolls wide for 玛舍勒's fruit rolls, and 2 fruit rolls long and 2 fruit rolls wide for 毕翠克丝's fruit rolls. If they both finish eating all of them, how many fruit rolls will they have eaten in total? We need to calculate this by dividing the number of fruit rolls by the number of people. So, if there are 24 fruit rolls long and 14 fruit rolls wide for 玛舍勒's fruit rolls, and 2 fruit rolls long and 2 fruit rolls wide for 毕翠克丝's fruit rolls, then the total number of fruit rolls is: (24 x 1) + (14 x 2) = 56 + 28 = 84 fruit rolls. Therefore, if they both finish eating all of them, they will have eaten a total of 84 fruit rolls.

Response:  First, let's think about how many times the whiteboard will be used in a day by each teacher. Since there are 4 teachers and they have 2 classes each, the total number of classes in a day is 8. Each class uses the whiteboard for 3 times, so the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a day is 8 x 3 = 24. Now, let's calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a week is 24 x 7 = 168. Therefore, the answer is 168.

We can use the multiplication formula to solve this problem: Number of flowers = Daily number of flowers x Number of days So, if Layne plants 2 flowers every day, he will have 2 x 15 = 30 flowers after 15 days. Therefore, the answer is 30 flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos. Then, we are told that the number of ducks in the photo taken by Jamal at the zoo is 50 times the maximum number of photos that Brent's phone can hold. So, if Brent's phone can hold 6 x 1,800 = 10,800 photos, then the number of ducks in Jamal's photo is 50 x 10,800 = 540,000 ducks. However, this answer is not possible as there are only 360,000 ducks in the zoo. Therefore, the answer must be zero (0).
Response:  First, let's calculate the total cost of all the wood she has:  Total cost = Number of pieces x Price per piece  For the 10 pieces of 2x4 wood, the total cost is: Total cost = 10 x $10 = $100  For the 5 pieces of 4x4 wood, the total cost is: Total cost = 5 x $16 = $80 So, the total cost of all the wood she has is: Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180 Now, let's calculate her profit if she sells everything: Profit = Selling price - Cost  To find out how much each piece of wood will sell for, we need to know the market price of wood. Let's assume that the market price of wood is $20 per board foot (which is a common price range for unfinished wood). If she sells all 10 pieces of 2x4 wood at this price, she will make: Profit from 2x4 wood = 10 x $20 = $200 And if she sells all 5 pieces of 4x4 wood at this price, she will make: Profit from 4x4 wood = 5 x $20 = $100 In total, she will make: Profit = $200 + $100 = $300 This means she will have a profit of $300 if she sells everything.
Response: 假設凱蒂使用了 x 茶匙的糖，那麼她使用的糖量是 x + 7 茶匙。同時，她使用的水量是 13 杯 water。因此，可以得出：x + 7 = 120... (1) 其中，x 是凱蒂使用的糖量。現在，我們要解釋 Equation (1)。首先，我們知道凱蒂使用的糖量是 x + 7 茶匙，而不是 x 茶匙。因此，Equation (1) becomes：x + 7 = 120 - 7... (2) Now we have a simpler equation to solve：x = 113. Therefore, 凱蒂使用了 113 茶匙的糖。

Response:  Let's think step by step.  We know that the first day, there were 2 containers of imported bicycles, and each container had 5 bicycles. Therefore, the total number of bicycles imported on the first day was 2 x 5 = 10 bicycles.  Now, let's assume that every container has 5 bicycles. So, if there are more than 2 containers arrived on the second day, the total number of bicycles imported on the second day would be the sum of the number of containers and the number of bicycles in each container. That is, 30 - 10 = 20 bicycles.  Therefore, the answer is 20 containers.
Response:  four years later, Adrian's income is $80,000 and Lara's income is $120,000.

Response:  First, let's think about how long it took Mark to complete the first test. Since he completed 75 questions in 8 hours, each question took him approximately 1 hour to answer. Now, let's find out how long it will take him to complete the second test with 100 questions. If he can finish each question in the same time as before (i.e., 1 hour), then it will take him 100/1 = 100 hours to complete the entire test. However, we are given that Mark has 6 hours of time to complete the test, which means he cannot finish all 100 questions. Therefore, the number of questions Mark did not answer is 100 - 6 = 94.

Response:  First, let's calculate the cost of each item: 牛奶 $2 美元、鸡蛋 $3 美元、灯泡 $3 美元、杯子 $4 美元。Total cost = $16 (add up all the costs) Now, we need to find out how much tax is required for non-food items. According to the problem, a 10% tax is required for all non-food items. So, we can multiply the total cost by 0.10 to get the tax amount: Tax amount = $1.6 (multiply $16 by 0.10) Finally, we add the tax amount to the total cost to get the final price: Final price = $17.6 ($16 + $1.6) Therefore, the answer is $17.6.
"Response:  Goldman 目前 already has 3 customers and is negotiating with 5 potential customers. He estimates that he will be able to clean each customer's house for $2 per bottle of bleach and $5 per pack of rags. His total weekly income from these customers would be:
Weekly income = Number of customers x Price per customer x Quantity of product used
= 3 x $2 x 2 (bottles of bleach) + 3 x $5 x 1 (pack of rags)
= $60 + $15
= $75
Now, let's calculate the profit. Profit = Total revenue - Total expenses
= Weekly income - Cost of products
= $75 - ($2 x 6 bottles of bleach + $5 x 4 packs of rags)
= $75 - $30 - $20
= $25
So, Goldman will make a profit of $25 per week."

Response:  First, let's think step by step. We know that John has thrown 500 blocks of Lego on the floor. Let's call this amount x. Then, we are told that he has thrown a set of Lego that is 3 times as many as the number of blocks he threw, and another set that is only half as many as the number of blocks he threw. So, if we can find out the number of blocks in each set, we can calculate the total number of blocks John needs to pick up. But how do we find these numbers? Let's see... If John threw 500 blocks, and there are sets that are 3 times as many and only half as many, then the total number of blocks must be equal to 3x + (3/2)x = 4x. Now, we need to find out what x is. Since John threw 500 blocks, x must be 500. So, the total number of blocks John needs to pick up is 4(500) = 2000 blocks. Therefore, the answer is 2000 blocks.

Response:  History 講故事，可以幫助我們更好地理解問題。  Let's start by thinking about the distance between Steve's house and the school. According to the problem, Steve's house is 3 miles away from the school.  Now, let's think about Timmy's situation. He lives 2 miles away from the school. If Timmy can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will it take him to reach his home after the race? To find out, we need to divide the distance between Timmy's house and the school (2 miles) by his speed (264 feet per minute). This gives us a time of 10 minutes. So, if Timmy wins the race, he will arrive at his home 10 minutes before Steve arrives at his home.
Response:  Shawnda 决定按轮胎收费，意味著每个轮胎都需要付 25 美分的费用。如果有 5 个人骑着双轮自行车过来，他們共同打气了 10 个轮胎（因为每个轮胎需要两次打气），这些轮胎的总价值为 25 x 10 = 250 美分。如果有 3 个人过来给全部三轮自行车的轮胎打气，他們共同打气了 9 个轮胎（因为每个轮胎只需要一次打气），这些轮胎的总价值为 25 x 9 = 225 美分。最後，一个人实际上是骑着单轮自行车过来的，他不会打气任何轮胎，因此没有收取任何费用。總計，這些人共同赚到了 250 + 225 + 0 = 475 美元。

首先，我們需要計算 total number of face breads, 羊角面包 and long breads that Bill makes each day.  From the problem statement, we know that Bill makes 300 face breads, 120 sheep horn breads, and 60 long breads every day. So, the total number of breads he makes is:

Total breads = 300 + 120 + 60 = 580

Next, we need to calculate the length of all the breads if they are connected head-to-tail. Since each face bread is 4 inches long, each sheep horn bread is 6 inches long, and each long bread is 2 feet long, the total length of all the breads can be calculated as follows:

Total length = (Number of face breads x Length of one face bread) + (Number of sheep horn breads x Length of one sheep horn bread) + (Number of long breads x Length of one long bread)
= 580 x 4 + 120 x 6 + 60 x 2 = 2792 + 720 + 120 = 4092 inches

Therefore, the answer is 4092 inches."

Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Jessica needs to pay each month for all her debts. Let's assume that she has three debts: student loan, credit card, and mortgage. The minimum payment amounts are as follows: Student loan: $300 per month Credit card: $200 per month Mortgage: $500 per month To find out how much Jessica needs to pay each month, we can multiply the minimum payment amount by 1.5 (to represent the 50% extra she wants to pay). So, the total monthly payment amount would be: Student loan: ($300 x 1.5) = $450 Credit card: ($200 x 1.5) = $300 Mortgage: ($500 x 1.5) = $750 Therefore, Jessica needs to pay a total of $1500 each month to cover all her debts with the additional 50% payment.

Finally, we need to subtract the amounts that Zayd spends on rent, utilities, and gasoline from his total salary to find out how much money he has left over after paying all of these expenses. If Zayd's total salary is $6000 per month, then he has $2500 left over after paying all of his expenses ($6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500).
Response:  First, let's count the number of crabs owned by Ranibal. According to the problem, he has 10 crabs. Now, let's count the number of crabs owned by Moniq. The problem states that he has 4 fewer crabs than Ranibal, so he has 6 crabs (10 - 4 = 6). Finally, let's add the number of crabs owned by both Ranibal and Moniq to find the total number of crabs they have: 10 + 6 = 16. Therefore, the three people together have a total of 16 crabs.
Response: 劳埃德在第一周做家教 5 小時，所得到的收入是 $5 \times 5 = 25$ 美元。在第二周，他做家教 8 小時，所得到的收入是 $8 \times 8 = 64$ 美元。因此，劳埃德在前两周挣了 $25 + 64 = 89$ 美元。
Response:  First, let's calculate the total number of votes that will be cast in the election. Since there are 80 students in the class and two candidates are running for office, each student will have two votes to cast (one for their preferred candidate and one for their least preferred candidate). Therefore, the total number of votes will be: 80 x 2 = 160 votes. Now, let's assume that Candidate A receives 3/4 of the votes, which is equal to 160 / 4 = 40 votes. This means that Candidate B has received the remaining 120 votes (160 - 40 = 120). Finally, since Candidate B has not been elected as the class representative, we can conclude that he or she has zero votes. So, the answer is 0.
Response: 桑德拉订购了 red rose 的 4 倍数量，等ivalent to  white chrysanthemum 的 16 倍。 additionally, she purchased 200 stems of pink lilies, which is equivalent to  white chrysanthemum's 10 倍. So the total number of roses and lilies that need to be delivered by 5 pm is : 16 x 4 = 64 + 10 x 200 = 2000. Therefore, 弗莱德 must deliver 2000 stems of red roses and pink lilies by 5 pm to keep the business of 桑德拉.
Response:  First, we need to find out how old Mark is now. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than his daughter, so he was 35 years old at that time. Now, Mark is 30 years old, and his daughter is 2 years younger than him, so she is 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Therefore, Mark's current age is 30 years old.
Response:  First, we need to find the time taken by each member of the first team to complete their 400 meters race. Let's assume that the first runner takes 55 seconds to finish their race. Now, let's calculate the time taken by each subsequent runner in the first team. Since they are running consecutively, the second runner will take 55 + 3 = 58 seconds to finish their race, and so on. Therefore, the total time taken by the first team to complete their 400 meters race is: (55 + 58 +... + 60) seconds = 270 seconds. Next, we need to find the time taken by each member of the second team to complete their 400 meters race. Let's assume that the first runner takes 60 seconds to finish their race. Now, let's calculate the time taken by each subsequent runner in the second team. Since they are running consecutively, the second runner will take 60 + 3 = 63 seconds to finish their race, and so on. Therefore, the total time taken by the second team to complete their 400 meters race is: (60 + 63 +... + 60) seconds = 240 seconds. Finally, we can compare the times taken by both teams to determine which team won. The first team took 270 seconds to complete their race, while the second team took 240 seconds. Therefore, the first team won the race by 30 seconds (270 - 240).
Response: 如果杰瑞摇出了一个大于 3 的数字，那么这个数字的 possibilites 是 $6$. 因为骰子只有 six faces, each with a probability of $\frac{1}{6}$ to land on any particular face. So the probability of landing on a face that is greater than 3 is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the probability of landing on two consecutive faces that are both odd is $\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$.
Response: 詹娜和她妈妈共同摘了 20 颗苹果。如果詹娜比她妈妈多摘了一半的苹果，那麼詹娜alone摘了 10 颗苹果（20 / 2 = 10）。因此，詹娜和她妈妈共同摘了 30 颗苹果（20 + 10 = 30）。
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 boxes of mice and each box has the same number of mice. So, there are 3 x 9 = 27 mice in total. Next, we know that each mouse gets 6 stalks of hay, so there are 27 x 6 = 162 stalks of hay in total. Now, we need to find out how many stalks of hay each mouse gets. Since there are 10 boxes of rabbits and each box has 5 rabbits, there are 10 x 5 = 50 rabbits in total. Finally, we know that each rabbit gets 20 stalks of hay, so there are 50 x 20 = 1000 stalks of hay in total.
Response:  First, we need to find out how much Man Ti owes Benny in total. According to the problem, Man Ti borrowed $100 from Benny with a monthly interest rate of 2%. To find out how much she owes after 3 months, we can use the formula: Total Amount = Principal + Interest After 3 Months = $100 x (1 + 0.02/12)^3 = $104.85 So, Man Ti needs to pay $4.85 more to Benny after 3 months.
Response:  First, we need to find out how much money the merchant made from selling all the wheat. According to the problem, the merchant sold all the wheat for $30 per bag, and he sold 400 bags in total. Therefore, the merchant's total profit is: Profit = Number of bags x Price per bag = 400 bags x $30 per bag = $12,000. Now, let's find out how many bags the merchant bought from the farmer. According to the problem, the merchant paid $2 per bag for transporting each bag of wheat from the farm to the warehouse. Therefore, the cost of transportation is: Cost of transportation = Total number of bags x Transportation cost per bag = 400 bags x $2 per bag = $800. So, the merchant's total cost is: Total cost = Cost of transportation + Profit = $800 + $12,000 = $12,800. Finally, we can calculate the number of bags the merchant bought from the farmer by dividing his total cost by the price he paid per bag: Number of bags = Total cost / Price per bag = $12,800 / $20 per bag = 640 bags. Therefore, the merchant bought 640 bags of wheat from the farmer.
Response:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food: Total Cost = $20.25 + $4.50 = $24.75 Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of people: Number of People = 3 So, each person needs to pay: $24.75 / 3 = $8.25

Response: 這個問題可以分成幾個部分：  First, we need to find out how much food each duck needs per week. According to the problem, a duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. So, if there are 10 ducks, they will need a total of 35 pounds of insects per week (10 x 3.5 = 35).  Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects each duck needs per day. To do this, we can divide the total amount of insects needed by the number of days in a week. In this case, the ducks need 35 pounds of insects / 7 days = 5 pounds of insects per day (35 / 7 = 5). Therefore, each duck needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.
Response:  Tom plants 10 trees every year and cuts down 2 trees each year. He started with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees died. How many trees does he have left? Let's break it down step by step: Year 1: Tom plants 10 trees, so he has 50 + 10 = 60 trees. Year 2: Tom cuts down 2 trees, so he has 60 - 2 = 58 trees. Year 3: Tom plants 10 trees again, so he has 58 + 10 = 68 trees. And so on... After 10 years, Tom has planted a total of 10 x 10 = 100 trees. Since 30% of the trees died, Tom has 100 / 0.3 = 333 trees left. So, Tom has 333 trees left after 10 years.
Response:  Weekend 是 Friday to Sunday. So, on Saturday morning (Week 2), the neighbors took back 3/4 of the colored plastic birds and painted them white. Then they put the white-painted birds back in Su's front yard on Saturday afternoon (Week 2). On Sunday morning (Week 3), the neighbors added 18 more colored plastic birds to Su's front yard. Now, let's count how many colored plastic birds there are in total. White birds: 3/4 x 18 = 12 White + new birds: 18 = 30 Total number of colored plastic birds: 30

Response:  Firstly, we know that the amount of money paid by Publisher B is twice the amount paid by Publisher A. So if Publisher A pays $5 per sentence, Publisher B will pay $10 per sentence.  Secondly, we are told that Mark edits 1,000 sentences per week for both publishers combined. Therefore, he earns a total of $5,000 per week ($10 x 1,000).  Finally, since Publisher B's payment is double that of Publisher A, Mark's total weekly income from Publisher B is also double, which is $10,000 per week ($5 x 2).  So, Mark's total weekly income is $15,000 ($5,000 + $10,000).

現在，我們可以計算他每天获得多少升水：

每天打出 55 升水
每桶有 5 升水
所以，他每天获得 55 ÷ 5 = 11 升 water

因此，他每天获得 11 升 water。"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the amount of money John will receive as a bonus. According to the problem, the bonus is worth $5,000 in cash and 5% raise in salary. To find out how much this is worth in terms of weekly income, we can use the following formula: Bonus = Cash + Raise x Number of Weeks in Year Where ""Cash"" is the amount of money John received in cash ($5,000), ""Raise"" is the percentage increase in his salary (5%), and ""Number of Weeks in Year"" is the number of weeks in the year (52). Plugging in these values, we get: Bonus = $5,000 + ($5,000 x 5%) x 52 = $5,000 + $26,000 = $31,000 Now that we know the total amount of money John will receive as a bonus, we can calculate his new weekly income by subtracting the amount he already made before the bonus from the total amount he will receive. So, if John made $2,000 per week before the bonus, his new weekly income after receiving the bonus would be: New Weekly Income = Total Amount Received - Previous Weekly Income = $31,000 - $2,000 = $29,000 Therefore, John's new weekly income after receiving the bonus is $29,000."
Response: 如果乔茜在她 10 英亩的农场里种植葡萄，每英亩每年产出 5 吨葡萄，那麼她的农场每年产生多少桶葡萄酒？  First, let's calculate the total amount of grapes produced by Joanna's farm per year: 5 tons/acre x 10 acres = 50 tons of grapes per year Now, let's convert the weight of grapes to barrels of wine: 1 ton of grapes = 2 barrels (assuming a conversion rate of 2 barrels/ton) So, the total number of barrels of wine produced by Joanna's farm per year is: 50 tons of grapes x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year Therefore, Joanna's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

Response:  First day: 100 customers Second day: 150 customers (increase of 50) Third day:? Customers Let's analyze the information given in the problem: On the first day, there were 100 customers in the store. On the second day, there were 150 customers (an increase of 50). To find out how many customers were in the store on the third day, we need to add the number of customers from the previous two days: 100 + 150 = 250 customers So, on the third day, there were 250 customers in the store.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the smaller pool has twice as much water as the larger pool initially. So, if the smaller pool had x gallons of water initially, the larger pool had 2x gallons of water initially. Now, after 4 minutes, both pools have emptied by 4 gal/min, so the smaller pool now has (x - 4gal) gallons of water and the larger pool has (2x - 8gal) gallons of water. Since the smaller pool had twice as much water as the larger pool initially, we can set up a proportion to find out how much water is in the smaller pool now: smaller pool water = larger pool water / 2 smaller pool water = (2x - 8gal) / 2 = x - 4gal Therefore, there are x - 4gal of water in the smaller pool now. Similarly, we can find out how much water is in the larger pool now: larger pool water = smaller pool water \* 2 larger pool water = (x - 4gal) \* 2 = 2(x - 4gal) = 2x - 8gal Finally, since the smaller pool had twice as much water as the larger pool initially, we can set up another proportion to find out how much water was originally in the smaller pool: original small pool water = original large pool water / 2 original small pool water = (x - 4gal) / 2 = 2(x - 4gal) / 2 = x - 4gal Therefore, there were x - 4gal of water in the smaller pool initially.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lori needs to save per hour of work. We know that she earns $8 per hour and the total cost of the shoes and belt is $320 + $32 = $352.

"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the age of Adrian three years after Harriet's current age.
Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, Adrian's age three years later will be:
Adrian's age = Harriet's age + 3
= 21 + 3
= 24 years old

Step 2: Calculate the average age of the three people (Harriet, Adrian, and Zak) three years from now.
The average age of the three people will be calculated by adding their ages together and dividing by 3:
Average age = (Harriet's age + Adrian's age + Zak's age) / 3
= (24 +? +?) / 3
=? years old

Since Zak's age is half of Harriet's age, we can calculate his age as follows:
Zak's age = Harriet's age / 2
= 21 / 2
= 10.5 years old

Therefore, the average age of the three people three years from now will be:
Average age = (24 + 10.5 + 10.5) / 3
= 35 years old"

Response:  James has 30 fire cards, 20 grass cards and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass cards, what is the probability that a randomly chosen card will be from the water series (round to the nearest integer)? We can start by calculating the number of water cards left after losing 8 cards. There are 40 water cards initially, minus 8 lost = 32 remaining water cards. Now, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a random card from the remaining water cards. Since there are 32 water cards remaining, the probability of choosing any one of them is 32/96 (since there are 96 total cards). So, the probability of choosing a water card is 32/96.

Response:  Johnnie initially had $20 in spare change, and then he added another $10. So, his total amount of money is $30 ($20 + $10). After one year, if the investment tripled, then Johnnie would have $90 ($30 x 3 = $90).
"Response:  Mary is two years younger than Kate and five years older than Joyce. If Joyce is 20 years old, then the total age of these three girls is? Let's think step by step. Firstly, we know that Mary is two years younger than Kate, so Kate's age minus Mary's age is equal to two. Therefore, Kate's age = 2 + x, where x is Mary's age. We also know that Joyce is five years older than Kate, so Joyce's age = Kate's age + 5. Now we have two equations: Kate's age = 2 + x; Joyce's age = Kate's age + 5. Can you solve for x now?"
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out the total number of students in the hall. Since 1000 is given as the total number of students in the school, and there are 3 entrances (A, B, and C), we can assume that each entrance has an equal number of students entering or leaving the hall. Therefore, the total number of students entering or leaving the hall through any one of the three entrances is also 1000 / 3 = 333. Now, let's analyze what happened during the meeting: 30% of the students who entered through entrance A left through exit A, which means they account for 30% of 333 = 99 students. Similarly, 3/5 of the remaining students who entered through entrance B left through exit B, which means they account for 3/5 x 333 = 206 students. Finally, all the students who entered through entrance C left through exit C, which means they account for 333 - 99 - 206 = 74 students. So, the number of students who left through exit C is 74.
Response: 首先，我們知道詹姆斯比罗伯特多 6 块糖果。因此，约翰的糖果是罗伯特的 two times = 2 x 6 = 12 块糖果。最後，我們知道约翰有 54 块糖果，所以他比詹姆斯多 12 - 6 = 6 块糖果。

"Response: 迈克是 5 个人的笔友，他和其中 2 个不再是笔友了。他们每个人每周寄 2 封 5 页長的信。他以相同的方式回应。他每 6 分钟能写一页。

1. How many people were there in total?
Total number of people = Number of friends + Number of non-friends = 5 + 2 = 7
2. How often did each person send a letter per week?
Each person sent 2 letters per week.
3. How long was each letter?
Each letter was 5 pages long.
4. How much time did Michael spend writing letters every six minutes?
Michael spent writing letters for 6 minutes every day. Since he wrote one page every 6 minutes, the total time he spent writing letters in a week is:
Time spent writing letters in a week = Total number of days in a week x Time spent writing letters per day = 7 x 6 = 42 minutes
Therefore, Michael spent 42 minutes writing letters every week."

Response:  Firstly, we know that Kelvin took 5 roots of potatoes from Grifen. Then, Colby took twice as many roots of potatoes as Kelvin, which means he took 10 roots of potatoes (since 2 x 5 = 10). Finally, Jinjie gave Grifen an extra root of potato, so now Grifen has 27 roots of potatoes in total. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  Let's think step by step.  We know that there are 4 turtles in one tank and 32 turtles in the other tank. The difference between these two numbers is twice the number of fish in each tank. So, if we let x be the number of fish in the first tank, then the number of fish in the second tank is 2x. Since the total number of turtles and fish in both tanks is equal, we can set up the equation: 4 + 2x = 32. Solving for x, we get x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 fish in each tank.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of makeup for one week. Since the movie needs to be filmed for 5 weeks, and the makeup artist charges $250 per hour, we can calculate the total cost of makeup as follows: Total cost of makeup = Number of hours of makeup x Makeup artist's charge per hour Total cost of makeup = 4 x 6 = 24 hours x $250 = $6,000 Now, let's calculate the discount that the makeup artist gave to Zhen. According to the problem, the makeup artist gave Zhen a 10% discount after the filming was completed. So, we can calculate the amount of money that Zhen paid as follows: Amount paid by Zhen = Original price - Discount Amount paid by Zhen = $6,000 - $600 (10% of $6,000) = $5,400 Therefore, Zhen paid a total of $5,400 for the makeup services.
Response:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the party supplies:  $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 = $74  Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of people attending the party:  $74 / 3 = $24 per person  Therefore, each person paid $24 for the party expenses.
Response:  First, let's calculate the total weight of the onions: 4 bags x 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds. Now, we need to calculate the cost of each bag of onions: Cost per pound = $1.50/pound So, the cost of one bag of onions is: Cost = $1.50/pound x 50 pounds = $75.00 Finally, we can calculate how much money the chef spent in total: Total cost = Number of bags x Cost per bag = 4 bags x $75.00 = $300.00 Therefore, the chef spent a total of $300.00 on the onions.
