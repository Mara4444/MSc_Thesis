Explanation:
Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. So, the new value of the house is:
New Value = Original Value + Amount Spent on Repairs
= $80,000 + $50,000
= $130,000
Since Josh bought the house for $80,000, his profit is:
Profit = New Value - Original Price
= $130,000 - $80,000
= $50,000"

Carla starts downloading the 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute, so it will take her 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to download 200 GB. However, when Windows forces a restart to install updates, it takes 20 minutes, which means that Carla has to start the download again from the beginning. Therefore, the total time it takes for Carla to download the file is 168 minutes (or 2 hours and 48 minutes)."

"Response:  $378.60
Explanation: To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to multiply her regular hourly rate by the number of hours she worked (up to 40 hours). So, her earnings for the first 40 hours she worked are:

$10/hour x 40 hours = $400

Then, we need to calculate her overtime pay for the additional 5 hours she worked. Overtime pay is calculated as 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so:

Overtime pay = $10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour

Total earnings for the week = Regular hourly rate x Number of hours worked + Overtime pay x Number of overtime hours worked
= $10/hour x 40 hours + ($12/hour x 5 hours)
= $400 + $60
= $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460."

The program had 60 downloads in the first month, which means it had a total of 60 x 1 = 60 downloads for that month.
In the second month, the program had 3 times as many downloads as in the first month, so it had 60 x 3 = 180 downloads in the second month.
In the third month, the program had 30% fewer downloads than in the second month, so it had 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads in the third month.
Therefore, the program had a total of 60 + 180 + 126 = 276 downloads over the three months."

Explanation:
Melanie started with 30 vacuum cleaners.
She sold a third of them at the green house, which is 1/3 x 30 = 20 vacuum cleaners.
So, she had 30 - 20 = 10 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.
She then sold 2 more to the red house, which is 2/10 = 0.2 vacuum cleaners.
So, she had 10 - 0.2 = 9.8 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the red house.
Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is 9.8 / 2 = 4.9 vacuum cleaners.
Therefore, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is equal to 4.9 + 10 = 14.9 vacuum cleaners in total."

John runs for 3 hours on the first day, which means he covers a distance of 3 x 3 = 9 miles. Since he runs at a constant speed during these three days, his average speed can be calculated by dividing the total distance covered by the time taken to cover it:

Average speed = Total distance / Time taken
= 9 miles / 3 hours
= 3 miles per hour or 12 minutes per kilometer (since there are 1.6 kilometers in a mile)

Therefore, John's average running speed is 12 minutes per kilometer."

Explanation:
Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse initially. She then used some of them while preparing for her job at the coffee shop. Let's assume she used x post-it notes.

At the coffee shop, she placed one post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee. So, she used up 220 post-it notes.

Now, we need to find out how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased. We can do this by subtracting the number of post-it notes she used from the total number of post-it notes she had:

Number of post-it notes in the package = Total number of post-it notes - Number of post-it notes used
= 80 - x

Since Candice had 80 post-it notes initially and she used x post-it notes, there must have been 15 post-it notes left over in the package (80 - x). Therefore, the answer is 15."

Response:  The formula to find the area of each level of a sandcastle is: Level i = (i-1) x Area of previous level Where i is the number of levels and Area of previous level is the area of the level above it. In this case, we know that the top level has an area of 16 square feet, so we can start by finding the area of the first level: Level 1 = (1 - 1) x 16 = 15 square feet Next, we can find the area of the second level: Level 2 = (2 - 1) x 15 = 30 square feet Continuing in this way, we get: Level 3 = (3 - 2) x 30 = 45 square feet Level 4 = (4 - 3) x 45 = 60 square feet Therefore, the average area of each level of the sandcastle is: Average area = (15 + 30 + 45 + 60) / 4 = 37.5 square feet

Response:  Sasha wants to calculate the total profit she will make by selling all of her leftover lumber. To do this, she needs to find out how much each board costs and then work out the total amount she can sell them for. The cost price of each board is as follows: 2 x 4 x 10 = $80 per board (for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards) 4 x 4 x 10 = $320 per board (for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards) Total cost price = $80 + $320 = $400 Now, let's find out how much Sasha can sell these boards for. Let's assume she sells them at a price of $120 per board ($100 more than their cost price). Total revenue = Number of boards sold x Price per board = 10 boards x $120 = $1,200 5 boards x $120 = $600 In total, Sasha makes a profit of $600 - $400 = $200 from selling all of her leftover lumber.

To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the number of questions he answered in the time available for both tests from the total number of questions in each test.
For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to answer 75 questions, so he answered 75/8 = 9 questions per hour. Therefore, he answered 9 x 75 = 675 questions in 8 hours.
For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to answer 100 questions, so he answered 100/6 = 16.67 questions per hour. Therefore, he answered 16.67 x 100 = 1667 questions in 6 hours.

For the non-food items, we need to multiply their prices by 1.1 (to account for the 10% tax) and then add the result to the original price. So, the cost of light bulbs becomes $3 x 1.1 = $3.30 + $3 = $6.30, and the cost of roach traps becomes $4 x 1.1 = $4.40 + $4 = $8.40.

Adding up the costs of all the items gives us the final answer of $57.68."
"Response:  $40
Explanation: To calculate the profit, we first need to calculate the total income for each client. For Client A, it would be $2 x 2 = $4 per home. For Client B, it would be $2 x 1 = $2 per home. For Client C, it would be $2 x 2 = $4 per home. And for Client D, it would be $2 x 1 = $2 per home. Therefore, the total income for all five clients would be $4 + $2 + $4 + $2 + $2 = $16. Since there are 5 clients, the total income per week would be $16 x 5 = $80. Next, we subtract the total expenses (bottles of bleach x 5 clients = $10) and cloths x 5 clients = $25), which gives us a profit of $80 - ($10 + $25) = $40 per week."
"Response: 400 pineapples.
Explanation:
To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the total area of the field (in hectares) and then divide that result by the time period between harvests (in months).

Number of pineapples per hectare = 100
Total area of the field in hectares = 10
Time period between harvests in months = 3

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
100 x 10 = 1000 pineapples / 3 = 400 pineapples
Therefore, John can harvest approximately 400 pineapples within a year."

Explanation:
At first, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Half of these bees, or 15 bees, return to the hive in the next 6 hours. Since twice as many bees left the hive than returned, the total number of bees that left the hive is double the number that returned, which is 30 + (2 x 30) = 90 bees. Therefore, Debra sees 90 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."

"Response: 5 minuten en 10 seconden.
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that Steve lives 3 miles away from the school, which means it takes him 3 x 5280 = 15940 feet to reach his house from the school. Since Steve can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute, it will take him 15940 / 440 = 36 minutes to reach his house. Now, since Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, it will take him 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet to reach his house from the school. Since Tim can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, it will take him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes to reach his house. Therefore, the winner will be waiting for 36 - 40 = 6 minutes and 10 seconds at their house before the loser finishes the race."

Response:  $6
"Response: 108
Explanation:
Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull took the rest. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries (half of 14). So, there were 7 + 14 = 21 fries left after the seagull's snack.
Three pigeons bullied the seagull away, each eating 3 fries. This means they ate a total of 9 fries (3 x 3 = 9). So, there were 21 - 9 = 12 fries left after the pigeons.
A raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is equal to 8 fries (2/3 x 12 = 8). So, there were 12 - 8 = 4 fries left.
Finally, an ant carried off one fry, leaving 4 fries behind.
Therefore, when Dave bought the pack of french fries, there were 108 fries in it (4 x 27 = 108)."

"Response: 576 feet.
Explanation:
To find out how long the baked goods are when put end to end, we need to measure their length individually and then add them up.
The length of a single roll is 4 inches = 0.08 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot). So, 300 rolls would be 300 x 0.08 = 24 feet long.
Similarly, the length of a single croissant is 6 inches = 0.12 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot). So, 120 croissants would be 120 x 0.12 = 14.4 feet long.
Finally, the length of a single baguette is 2 feet = 2 x 0.12 = 2.4 feet long. So, 60 baguettes would be 60 x 2.4 = 144 feet long.
Adding up these lengths gives us a total length of 24 + 14.4 + 144 = 576 feet. Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they would be 576 feet long."

"Response: 260 yard (of 237 meter)
Explanation:
Blake ran 15 times along the entire length of the football field, which is 100 yards (or 91 meters). Therefore, he ran a total distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards (or 1370 meters).
Kelly ran from the 40-yard line to the opposite end zone and back, which is a distance of 40 + 40 = 80 yards (or 73 meters). Since she did this 34 times, her total distance run was 34 x 80 = 2640 yards (or 2370 meters).
Therefore, the winner (Blake) ran 1500 - 2640 = -940 yards (or -820 meters) fewer than the loser (Kelly)."
Response:  Raphael spent a total of $39 on the school supplies. This can be calculated by adding up the costs of all the items he bought: $1.5 x 4 = $6 for the pens, $4 x 2 = $8 for the notebooks, and $20 for the rime of bond paper. Therefore, the total cost is $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Explanation:
Anakin caught 10 starfish, which is equal to 10 x 1 = 10 fish. He also caught 6 sea horses, which is equal to 6 x 1 = 6 fish. Additionally, he caught 3 clownfish, which is equal to 3 x 1 = 3 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish Anakin caught is 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so she caught 5 x -5 = -25 starfish. She also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so she caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Finally, she caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so she caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. Therefore, the total number of fish Locsin caught is -25 + 3 + 5 = 27 fish."
"Response:  After 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost $48.50. Here's how I arrived at this answer:

1. First, let's calculate the percentage increase in each two-month period:
Percentage increase = (New price - Old price) / Old price x 100
= ($20 + (20% of $20)) - $20
= $4 - $20
= -$16

So, the price of a bag of marbles decreases by 16% every two months.

2. Now, let's find out what the price of a bag of marbles will be after 36 months:
Price after 36 months = Original price x (1 + Percentage increase)^Number of periods
= $20 x (1 + (-16%/2))^36
= $20 x 0.8479
= $17.39

Therefore, after 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost $17.39."

If Jackie hires an accountant, she will save $35 per hour by not having to do her own taxes. Since she misses out on 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour, that means she loses a total of $105 ($35 x 3 hours). On the other hand, the accountant charges $90 for their services. Therefore, hiring an accountant will actually make Jackie $125 ($105 lost + $90 charged) better off."
"Response:  €683
Explanation:
First, we calculate the total cost of all the items Elvira bought:
Total Cost = Computer + Screen + Keyboard + Mouse + Scanner + CD Burner + Printer = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423
Next, we subtract the amount Elvira spent on the computer from the total cost:
Subtracted Cost = Total Cost - Amount Spent on Computer = €1423 - €1090 = €333
Now, we subtract the amount Elvira wants to spend on clothes from the remaining amount:
Remaining Money = Subtracted Cost - Clothes Cost = €333 - €68 = €265
Therefore, Elvira will have €265 left over for buying clothes after purchasing the computer and its accessories."

"Response:  To find out how much each uniform costs, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Hat: The hat costs $25.
2. Jacket: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so it costs $25 x 3 = $75.
3. Pants: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.
4. Total cost of the uniform: The total cost of the uniform is the sum of the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants, which is $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Therefore, each uniform costs $150 in total."

Since it takes him about a minute and a half to peel a potato (180 seconds), and only about 5 seconds to cut it up, it will take him approximately 24 minutes and 30 seconds to prep all 60 potatoes."
Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that they sold 20 glasses of lemonade per gallon and that each glass cost $0.50. Therefore, the total revenue from selling lemonade was: Revenue = Number of glasses x Price per glass = 20 glasses x $0.50/glass = $10. Now, we also know that their profit was $25. So, if their expenses were $X, then their profit would be: Profit = Revenue - Expenses = $10 - X. Solving for X, we get: X = $15. Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $15 on lemons.

"Response: 5800 $
Explanation:
Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1500$.
He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 2000$.
He donates half of the remaining amount, which is 3000$.
He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses.
He gives his wife 700$ to budget for groceries and other household goods.
So, the total amount spent by Zaid is:
Rent = 1500$
Car fuel = 2000$
Donation = 3000$
Weekly expenses for daughter = 200$
Budget for groceries and other household goods for wife = 700$
Total amount spent = 6500$
Now, let's calculate the amount left for Zaid after all these expenses and donations:
Amount left = Salary - Total amount spent = 6000$ - 6500$ = 5800$
Therefore, Zaid will have 5800$ left after all these expenses and donations."

Explanation:
To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we can use the following formula:

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes

In this case, there are 6 possible outcomes when Jerry rolls the die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Of these, only the outcomes 4, 5, and 6 are greater than 3. Therefore, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is:

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes) = (3) / (6) = 0.5 or 50%

Now, to find the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probability of him rolling an even number on the first roll, and then the probability of him rolling another even number on the second roll. Since there are three even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), the probability of Jerry rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 or 0.5. The probability of him rolling another even number on the second roll, given that he rolled an even number on the first roll, is also 3/6 or 0.5. Therefore, the overall probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row is:

Probability = Probability of rolling an even number on the first roll x Probability of rolling another even number on the second roll = 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%

So, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%."

Let's first calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to all the small rodents:
10 cages of hamsters x 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw for hamsters
3 cages of rats x 6 pieces/cage = 18 pieces of straw for rats
Total number of pieces of straw distributed to small rodents = 50 + 18 = 68 pieces
Now, we know that there are 160 pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents altogether. So, if there are X cages of rats, then the number of pieces of straw distributed to rats is:
X / 6 = 68 (since there are 6 pieces of straw per cage)
Therefore, there are 48 cages of rats (since X divided by 6 gives 48)."

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first two months = 2 x (60 + 20) = 120 cards.
Therefore, Elaine currently has 60 + 20 + 120 = 380 cards in total."

"Response: 18
Explanation:
Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(y), where y is the number of white chickens Jerry has.
The total number of eggs collected by Jerry every day is 42, so we can set up the equation:
3x + 5y = 42
Now, we are given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This means that if he has y white chickens, then he has (y+2) red chickens. Substituting this into the previous equation gives us:
3x + 5((y+2)) = 42
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x + 25 = 42
Subtracting 25 from both sides gives us:
3x = 17
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
x = 18
Therefore, Jerry has 18 red chickens."

Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
2R = R + 6
Simplifying, we get:
1 = 6
Therefore, John has 28 more candies than James."

"Response: 10 uur en 48 minuten.
Explanation:
Mike receives 2 letters per week from the remaining 3 pen pals, for a total of 6 letters per week. Since he responds to each letter in kind, he spends time writing a response to each letter. Let's assume it takes him 1 minute to write a response to each letter, which is a reasonable estimate given the length of the letters (5 pages x 500 words/page = 2500 words per letter). Therefore, Mike spends 6 minutes per week writing responses to his pen pals.
Now, let's calculate how much time Mike spends writing letters overall. Since he stops being pen pals with 2 of the original 5 people, we need to subtract the time he spent writing to those 2 people from the total time he spends writing letters. Let's assume he spent 2 hours per week writing to those 2 people before he stopped being pen pals with them. Therefore, the total time Mike spends writing letters per week is:
6 minutes + 2 hours = 8 hours and 48 minutes per week."

Explanation:

First, we need to calculate the total number of hours that the makeup artist worked on Jean. Since the movie took 5 weeks to finish, and the makeup artist required 6 hours of work per day, the total number of hours worked is:

6 hours/day x 5 weeks = 30 hours

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the makeup for each day of the movie shoot. Since the makeup artist charged $250 per hour, and worked for 6 hours per day, the daily cost of makeup is:

$250/hour x 6 hours/day = $1500/day

Now, let's calculate the total cost of makeup for the entire movie shoot:

Total cost of makeup = Daily cost of makeup x Number of days of shooting
= $1500/day x 30 days (total number of days of shooting)
= $45,000

Finally, since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount after the movie was finished, we need to subtract that amount from the total cost of makeup:

Discount = Total cost of makeup x Percentage of discount
= $45,000 x 10%
= $4500

So, Jean paid a total of:

$45,000 - $4500 = $40,500

Therefore, Jean paid $40,500 for the makeup services during the movie shoot."
Response:  Each person paid ($12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22) / 3 = $60.

Explanation:
Sue consumed 6 times as many calories as her sister.
On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 4 x 9 = 36 cookies.
Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so she ate 5 x 200 = 1000 calories.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 36 = 72 cookies.
Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate 13 x 200 = 2600 calories.
Therefore, Sue consumed 6000 - 2600 = 3400 more calories than her sister."
