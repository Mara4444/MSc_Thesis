Response:  To find out how long it will take for Carla to download the file after the restart, we need to calculate the time taken before and after the restart. Before the restart, Carla was able to download 2 GB per minute, so it took 200 GB / 2 GB = 100 minutes to download 60%. After the restart, Carla had to start over from the beginning, so it will take her another 100 minutes to finish the remaining 40%. Therefore, in total, it will take Carla 200 minutes (or 3 hours) to download the entire 200 GB file.
Response:  The driver is 1/5 of the way home after 2 hours of driving. After 4 hours of driving, the driver is 3/5 of the way home. Therefore, the distance left to go is (4/5) \* x = 2x/5, where x is the initial distance traveled. So the driver is 4x/5 miles away from home.
Response:  To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for both her regular work and her overtime work. For her regular work, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked (40 hours). For her overtime work, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of overtime hours she worked (15 hours) and then multiply that amount by 1.2 to get the overtime pay. Finally, we add up all of these amounts to get Eliza's total earnings for the week. Here is the calculation: Regular work: $10/hour x 40 hours = $400 Overtime work: $10/hour x 15 hours = $150 x 1.2 = $180 Total earnings: $400 + $150 + $180 = $730
"Response:  Total downloads = (60 + 180 + 105) x 3 = 720

"Response:  To determine how long it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate its annual income and then divide that by the initial investment. Let's do this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the annual income of the lemon tree:
	* Number of lemons produced per year = 7
	* Selling price per lemon = $1.5
	* Annual income = Number of lemons x Selling price per lemon = 7 x $1.5 = $10.50
2. Calculate the annual expenses of maintaining the lemon tree:
	* Watering and feeding cost per year = $3
	* Annual expense = Watering and feeding cost per year = $3
3. Determine when the lemon tree will start earning money:
	* Initial investment = Cost of planting the tree + First year's maintenance cost = $90 + $3 = $93
	* Time taken to reach break-even point (when the tree starts earning money) = Total annual income / Initial investment = $10.50 / $93 = 11.4 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos approximately 11.4 years before he starts earning money from his lemon tree."
Response:  Let's use the information given in the problem to create an equation. We know that Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners. At the green house, she sold a third of them, which is equal to x/3. Then, she sold 2 more to the red house, so now she had x - 2 left. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is equal to (x - 2)/2. Now we can set up the equation: x = 5. So, Melanie started with 5 vacuum cleaners.
"Response:  The total number of students = 20 + (100 - 20) / 3 = 40
The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance = Total number of students x Percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance = 40 x 75/100 = 30
Therefore, 30 out of 40 or 75% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"Response:  The profit from purchasing jewelry is:
Profit = ($5,000 x 2.5%) + $5,000 = $1,250
The profit from purchasing electronic gadgets is:
Profit = ($8,000 x 1.2%) + $8,000 = $960
Therefore, the maximum profit for the merchant would be:
Maximum Profit = $1,250 (from jewelry) + $960 (from electronic gadgets) = $2,210"
"Response:  Let's call the distance traveled by Train A on Day 1 as x and that of Train B as y. We know that both trains left San Rafael together, so their total distance traveled on Day 1 is equal to twice the distance traveled by either one of them:
x + 2y = 160 (since they traveled westward for 80 miles)
On Day 2, they traveled northward for 150 miles, so the distance traveled by Train A on Day 2 is x + 150 and that of Train B is y + 150:
x + 150 = 300 (since they traveled a total distance of 300 miles on Day 2)
Simplifying these equations gives us:
2x + 150 = 300
Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 40 miles
y = 120 miles
So, Train A traveled 40 miles on Day 1 and 120 miles on Day 2, while Train B traveled 120 miles on Day 1 and 40 miles on Day 2."
Response:  Jill's annual salary is $48,000 (20 x 50 weeks) + $45,000 (30 x 35 hours/week) = $93,000.
Response:  If Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning, then she will eat 3 x 28 = 84 eggs in 1 week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she will eat 84 x 4 = 336 eggs in a month. Therefore, she will eat 336 x 4 = 1344 eggs in 4 weeks.
"Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula:
average speed = total distance / time taken
In this case, the total distance is 12 miles and the time taken so far is 2 hours (or 2 x 60 minutes). So, if Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of:
average speed = total distance / time taken
= 12 miles / 2 hours
= 6 miles per hour
Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike."
"Response:  To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we need to subtract the amount of water that was spilled (1 liter) from the total volume of the orange drink (10 liters). So, there are 9 liters of water left in the orange drink.
Now, let's calculate the proportion of water in each drink by dividing the number of liters of water by the total volume of the drink. For the orange drink, this gives us a proportion of 3/4 or 75%. And for the pineapple drink, this gives us a proportion of 2/3 or 66.67%.
So, the remaining 24 liters of liquid contains 75% water from the orange drink and 66.67% water from the pineapple drink."

Response:  John runs at an average speed of 12 minutes per mile (60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per week).
Response:  Let's assume that Dana runs for x hours and walks for (6 - x) hours. We know that her rate of running is 4x/1 = 4x miles per hour, and her rate of walking is (2/3)(6 - x)/1 = (2/3)(6 - x) miles per hour. Since she skips at a rate of 3 miles per hour, we can say that she skis for x + (6 - x) = 9 hours. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Dana is: Distance = Running + Walking + Skipping = x(4x) + (6 - x)(2/3)(6 - x) + 9 = 5x^2 + 7x - 9 =? Solution: To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation above. Rearranging the terms, we get: x = 5x^2 + 7x - 9 / 5 =? Substituting this expression into the original equation, we get: 5x^2 + 7x - 9 = 5(5x^2 + 7x - 9) =? Solving for x, we get: x = 30 / 5 = 6 So, Dana can travel 6 \* 4 = 24 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
Response:  Brandon's iPhone is eight years old.
"Response:  To determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the javelin.

First, let's find out how much further Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone compared to when she is not holding it. We know that the distance Polly can throw the javelin increases by 300 feet when she holds the gemstone (from 400 feet to 700 feet). Therefore, the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the javelin without holding the gemstone is:

400 feet - 300 feet = 100 feet

Now, let's find out how close the dragon is to Polly. We are given that the dragon is 1000 feet away from Polly.

So, if Polly stands x feet away from the dragon, the distance between them will be:

x + 1000 feet = 2000 feet

We want to find out how far outside of this distance Polly needs to stand in order to hit the dragon with the javelin. To do this, we set up an equation using the information provided:

x + 1000 = 2000

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1000 feet

Therefore, Polly needs to stand at least 1000 feet away from the dragon in order to hit it with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone."
Response:  The number of pieces taken by the guests is 7 (14 - 5 = 7).
"Response:  To determine the number of grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories in a single serving, we need to calculate the remaining calories left for the day after consuming 1800 calories. Let's assume that each serving of chips contains 250 calories.

Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Calories consumed (in this case, 1800)
Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Now, let's divide the remaining calories by the number of servings in the bag (5):
Number of grams of chips you can eat = Remaining calories / Number of servings
Number of grams of chips you can eat = 200 / 5 = 40 grams

So, if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, you can eat up to 40 grams of chips based on the nutritional information provided."
"Response:  To find out how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax, we need to divide the weight of the beeswax by the weight of a single candle. In this case, that would be 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax. So, if Charlie has one pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles.
To find out how much it costs Charlie in supplies to make one candle, we add up the cost of the beeswax and the wick. Since one pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and one wick costs $0.50, the total cost of supplies for one candle is $10.50 ($10.00 + $0.50).
Finally, to determine Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles, we subtract the cost of supplies from the amount he sold them for. If he sold each candle for $2.00, then he made a total of $40.00 from selling 20 candles ($2.00 x 20 = $40.00). Subtracting the cost of supplies ($10.50), Charlie's net profit is $39.50 ($40.00 - $10.50)."
"Response:  To find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information given in the problem.
Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Tuesday: 2/5 x 4 hours per article = 8 hours (since she wrote twice as many articles on Wednesday)
Wednesday: 10 hours (twice as many articles as on Tuesday)
Total hours: 20 + 8 + 10 = 38 hours
Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 38 hours writing articles in the three days."

Response:  Lloyd makes $104 per week from his egg farm.
Response:  To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate. We know that the distance he traveled was 20 miles (from 1 to 4 PM), and his rate was 10 miles per hour when he was sailing. So, if he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, it will take him twice as long to get back: Time = 20 miles / 10 miles/hour = 2 hours. Therefore, it will take Tom 2 hours to get back.
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so if Uriah removes 30 comic books, they will weigh 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. Since toys weigh 1/2 pound each, Uriah needs to remove enough toy items to make up for the weight of the removed comic books. Therefore, he needs to remove 7.5 - 15 = 7.5 / 2 = 3.75 toy items. So, he needs to remove 3 toy items.

"Response:  To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight limit of the bridge.

Weight of truck and driver = 3755 pounds
Total weight limit of bridge = 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Now, we can divide the remaining weight limit by the weight of a single box (15 pounds) to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck:

Number of boxes = Remaining weight limit / Weight of a single box
= 1245 pounds / 15 pounds
= 83 boxes

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83 boxes."

Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needs to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. This means that her current tank size is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons. Since her car gets an average fuel economy of x miles per gallon, Sophia can drive x / 8 = 125 miles on a single tank of gas. So, Sophia can drive 125 miles on a single tank of gas.

"Response:  To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of brownies he sold by the price per slice and the number of slices of cheesecake he sold by the price per slice.

For brownies:
Number of brownies = 43
Price per slice = $3
Total amount raised from brownies = Number of brownies x Price per slice = $3 x 43 = $129

For cheesecakes:
Number of cheesecakes = 23
Price per slice = $4
Total amount raised from cheesecakes = Number of cheesecakes x Price per slice = $4 x 23 = $92

So, in total, Tommy raises $221 ($129 + $92)."
"Response:  To find out how much Sheila will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then divide it by the number of months she is making payments. Let's do that:
Total Cost = Number of Cell Phones x Price per Cell Phone x Interest Rate
= 5 x $150 x 0.02
= $750
Now, let's divide the total cost by the number of months Sheila is making payments:
Monthly Payment = Total Cost / Number of Months
= $750 / 3
= $250 per month
So, Sheila will pay $250 per month for 3 months to buy five cell phones on an installment plan with a 2% interest rate."
Response:  To find out how much Artie will make from each type of flower, we need to multiply the number of pots sold by the price per pot. For example, if Artie sold 12 pots of marigolds, he made $2.74 x 12 = $32.88 from those pots alone. Here are the calculations for each type of flower: Marigolds: $32.88 Petunias: $15.63 Begonias: $30.74 Total amount Artie made: $32.88 + $15.63 + $30.74 = $78.25

"Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs and then divide it by the number of cups per bag. Let's do that:
Total cups of dog food needed = 1 cup/day x 180 days + 2 cups/day x remaining days = 180 + (365 - 180) = 485 cups
Since there are 110 cups per bag, Cecilia will use:
Number of bags = Total cups / Cups per bag = 485 / 110 = 4.4 bags
So, Cecilia will use approximately 4.4 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Response:  Let's assume that Raymond does x pounds of laundry, Sarah does 4x pounds of laundry, and David does y pounds of laundry. We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so we can write:

y = 4 \* x

We also know that Sarah does half as much laundry as Raymond, so we can write:

x = 2 \* y

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving for x and y gives us:

x = 160 pounds
y = 80 pounds

So, Raymond does 160 pounds of laundry, David does 80 pounds of laundry, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry."

"Response:  To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after changing his diet, we need to use the information given in the problem.

Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. So if Lee runs the race in 38 seconds, Gerald must have run it in 40 seconds (2 seconds slower).

Now, since Gerald has improved his diet, he is 10% faster than before. This means that for every second he used to run the race, he will now run it 10% faster.

So, if Gerald ran the race in 40 seconds before, he will now run it in 36 seconds (40 x 1.10 = 44 seconds).

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds after improving his diet."
"Response:  Let's start by using the information that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, if we let D be the number of dogs and C be the number of cats, we can write:

"Response:  The total number of doorbell rings is equal to the sum of the number of doorbell rings made by each friend. Let A be the number of doorbell rings made by the first friend, B be the number of doorbell rings made by the second friend, C be the number of doorbell rings made by the third friend and D be the number of doorbell rings made by the fourth friend. According to the problem, we know that:
A + (B \* 1/4) = 20
C + 10(D) = 60
Now we can solve for A, B, C and D using these two equations. For example, from equation (1), we have:
A = 20 / 4 = 5
From equation (2), we have:
C = 60 - 10(D) = 60 - 10(60) = 60 - 600 = -540
So, the answer is -540."
Response:  To find out how many pages Solo needs to read each day, we can divide the total number of pages he needs to read by the number of days he has left to finish his reading. In this case, Solo needs to read 69 pages (4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 69) in 4 days, so he needs to read an average of 17.25 pages per day (69 / 4 = 17.25).

"Response:  B

Answer: B) 2 hours
Explanation:
From the problem statement, we know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in all. Since each hour of TV is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert the total time he spent watching TV into minutes as follows:
7 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes
Now, let's analyze the information given in the problem:
On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night, which means he watched a total of 2 hours (2 x 60 minutes/hour).
On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show, but we are not told how many episodes he watched. However, since there were 3 days on Wednesday, and each day had a different number of episodes, we can assume that Frankie watched a total of 3 x 30 minutes/hour = 90 minutes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.
On Thursday, Frankie finished his homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. So, he watched a total of 1 + 30 = 40 minutes of TV.
Finally, on Friday, Frankie stayed up late for the weekend, so he watched 2 x 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes of TV.
Adding up all these times, we get:
Total minutes of TV watched by Frankie = 420 + 90 + 40 + 120 = 650 minutes
Therefore, the answer is B) 2 hours."

Response:  After receiving the cashback reward, the cost of 10 gallons of gas will be $28.00 ($3.00 x 10).
"Response:  To find out how much each of them ate on average, we need to divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2 (since there were only 2 people in the contest). So, let's do that:
Total number of fruit roll-ups = 2 x (Beatrice's length + Marcell's width)
= 2 x (24 + 14)
= 48
Average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person = Total number of fruit roll-ups / 2
= 48 / 2
= 24
So, Beatrice ate an average of 24 fruit roll-ups and Marcell ate an average of 24 fruit roll-ups as well!"
Response:  To find how much water the boat had taken on, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows back towards shore. So if Julia rowed 20 feet (which is equal to 2 x 10 = 20), then the boat has taken on 20 + 2(20) = 40 liters of water. Since Julia rowed 64 seconds to reach shore, and each liter of water takes up 1 cubic decimeter (or 1000 milliliters), then the volume of water the boat took on is 40 liters x 1000 milliliters/liter = 40,000 milliliters or 40 cubic decimeters. Therefore, the answer is 40 cubic decimeters.
Response:  The whiteboard is cleaned 12 times per day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/day x 3 cleans per lesson = 12 cleans per day)
Response:  Ryan has 30 flowers in his garden after 15 days (2 x 15 = 30).
Response:  To find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so if Brittany's phone can hold 50 photographs, then Jamal's phone can hold 300 photographs (6 x 50 = 300). We also know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So if there are 1800 photographs in Jamal's phone, then there must be 36,000 birds (1800 x 50 = 36,000) in his photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Finally, since each bird takes up one square unit of space on the screen, and there are 36,000 birds in the photograph, then the area of the screen used by the photograph is 36,000 square units.
"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of all the lumber she has and then subtract that amount from the total revenue she will get from selling it all. Let's do this step by step:

Total cost = Number of boards x Cost per board
= 10 x $10
+ 5 x $16
= $100 + $80
= $180

Revenue = Total cost x Price per board
= $180 x ($10 + $16) / 2
= $180 x $13
= $2340

Profit = Revenue - Total cost
= $2340 - $180
= $2160

So, Sasha makes a profit of $2160 from selling all of her lumber."
Response:  To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to divide the number of teaspoons of sugar by the ratio of sugar to water. In this case, the ratio is 7:13, so we divide 120 (the total number of teaspoons of sugar) by 7 to get 17 (the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used). Therefore, Katy used 17 teaspoonfuls of sugar.
Response:  John paid a total of $180 ($60 x 3 children).
Response:  Let's call the number of containers imported on the first day x. Since there are 2 containers with 5 vehicles inside each container, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is 2x. On the second day, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30, so the number of containers imported on the second day must be 30 / 5 = 6. Therefore, the answer is 6 containers were imported on the second day.
"Response:  Let A be Adrien's salary four years ago, B be Lylah's salary four years ago, C be Adrien's current salary, and D be Lylah's current salary. We know that:
A + B = 30% of C (given)
C = 1.4B (since Adrien's salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago)
Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
A + B = 30% of C
C = 1.4B
Now solve for A, B, C, and D:
A = 40000 (given)
B =?
C =?
D =?
Using equation (1), we can find B:
B = A + B = 40000 + 20000 = 60000
Now using equation (2), we can find C:
C = 1.4B = 1.4(60000) = 84000
Finally, using equation (1), we can find D:
D = C / 30% = 84000 / 30% = 27333
Therefore, Adrien's total salary four years later was $27333, and Lylah's total salary was $60000 - $27333 = $32667."

"Response:  The total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
Watermelons x price = $3 x 4 = $12
Peppers x price = $15 x 20 = $300
Oranges x price = $15 x 10 = $150
Total amount of money spent = $300 + $150 + $12 = $612
Therefore, the answer is $612."
"Response:  To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost first. Let's assume that all 500 patients are seen in one day.
Total Revenue = Number of Patients x Charge per Patient = 500 x $200 = $100,000
Total Cost = Number of Patients x Time spent with each patient x Doctor's rate + Hospital's rate = 500 x 24 x ($150 + $200) = $360,000
 Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $100,000 - $360,000 = -$260,000
So, the hospital actually loses money by seeing 500 patients a day at this rate."

"Response:  Let's break this down step by step:

Monday: Walt walked 4 miles
Tuesday: Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, if he walked 4 miles on Monday, he walked 24 miles (6 x 4) on Tuesday.
Wednesday: Total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. Since Wednesday is the third day, we can find out how far Walt walked on Wednesday by subtracting the distance he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage: 41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.
So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."

"Response:  B) 25
Explanation:
If Mark took 75 questions in the first test and completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour, then he spent 75/5 = 15 hours on the first test. Since he had 8 hours to complete the first test, he left 8 - 15 = 7 hours of questions unanswered.
Similarly, if he took 100 questions in the second test and completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour, then he spent 100/5 = 20 hours on the second test. Since he had 6 hours to complete the second test, he left 6 - 20 = 14 hours of questions unanswered.
Therefore, Mark left 7 + 14 = 21 questions unanswered in total."
"Response:  Let's assume that the total number of gumballs in the machine is x. Since there are 4 times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, the number of pink gumballs is 4x. We know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can set up the equation:

x = 4x + 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 50

So there are 50 gumballs in the machine, including both blue and pink ones."
"Response:  To find out the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars available for rent. In this case, there are 3 semi-automatic cars out of a total of 20 cars, so the percentage is:

Percentage = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) x 100%
= (3 / 20) x 100%
= 15%

Therefore, 15% of the cars available for rent are semi-automatic."
Response:  The number of worker bees is 1400.
Response:  To find out how much money Jordan will earn in one week, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends playing video games by the amount he earns per hour. If he spends 2 hours playing video games each day and works for 4 days (Monday through Thursday), then he will work for a total of 8 hours (2 x 4 = 8). So, Jordan will earn $8 in one week if he spends his video game time working instead.
Response:  The total cost of the items after the 10% tax on non-food items is $25 + $9 + $9 + $9 + $12 = $64.
Response:  To find out how much profit Lucas will make each week, we first need to calculate his total income for the week. The formula for this is: Total Income = Number of Clients x Price per Client x Number of Items needed per Client. For Lucas, this would be: Total Income = 3 clients x $92 per client x 2 bottles of bleach + 1 pack of cloths = $286. Next, we subtract his total expenses from his total income to find his profit. His total expenses are $2 x 3 clients = $6. So, his profit can be calculated as follows: Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses = $286 - $6 = $280. Therefore, Lucas will make $280 in profit each week.
Response:  John can harvest 1,000 pineapples within a year (10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare x 4 times/year).

In this case, the number of bees that left the hive was 30, so the total number of bees that left the hive during the day was 60 (half of which were seen returning in the second 6-hour period). Therefore, the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 60 - 30 = 30."
Response:  $10
Response:  James has 48 Facebook friends.
Response:  To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we need to subtract the distance between the two houses (2 miles) from the time it takes for the faster person to travel that distance. Since Steve bikes at a rate of 440 feet per minute, it will take him 2/5 minutes to cover 2 miles = 1 mile / 440 feet per minute = 5 minutes. So if Steve starts the race first, Tim will catch up in 5 - 2 = 3 minutes. Therefore, the winner will wait 3 minutes at their house before the loser finishes the race.
Response:  To find out how much money Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the cost of inflating each tire and then multiply it by the number of tires inflated for each customer. For the bicyclists, each tire costs $0.25, so 5 customers x $0.25 per tire = $1.25. For the tricycle riders, each tire costs $0.25 as well, so 3 customers x $0.25 per tire = $0.75. And for the unicycler, since they only have one tire, it costs $0.25 to inflate it. Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25.

"Response: 5

Answer: 5

Explanation:

Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the rest. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries (half of 14). So, there were 7 + 14 = 21 fries left after the seagull's snatch.

Then, three pigeons came along and ate 3 fries each, leaving 21 - 9 = 12 fries.

Later, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is equal to 12 x 2/3 = 8 fries.

Finally, an ant carried off the last french fry, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

Therefore, the answer is 7 fries."
Response:  To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to multiply the number of days per week by the length of each class. For Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the length of each class is 1 hour, so Kimo spends 3 x 1 = 3 hours on these days. For Tuesday and Thursday, the length of each class is 2 hours, so Kimo spends 2 x 2 = 4 hours on these days. Therefore, in total, Kimo spends 3 + 4 = 7 hours per week attending classes. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 7 x 16 = 112 hours attending classes in a semester.
"Response:  The total length of all the baked goods put end to end would be:
Rolls = 300 x 4 inches = 1200 inches
Chocolate Croissants = 120 x 6 inches = 720 inches
Baguettes = 60 x 2 feet = 120 feet
Total length = 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches
So the baked goods would be approximately 168 feet long if placed end to end."
"Response:  To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we can use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

* The monkeys need 200 bananas every month. So they need 200 x 2 = 400 bananas in total for 2 months.
* The gorillas need 400 bananas every month. So they need 400 x 2 = 800 bananas in total for 2 months.
* The baboons need 100 bananas every month. So they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas in total for 2 months.

Adding up the total number of bananas needed for each species, we get:
400 + 800 + 200 = 1,400 bananas.

So the zookeeper needs to order 1,400 bananas to last for 2 months."
Response:  The winner (Blake) ran a total distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards. The loser (Kelly) ran a total distance of 40 + 40 = 80 yards. So the winner ran 1500 - 80 = 1420 yards more than the loser.

1. We know that the total value of all toys is equal to $X.
2. From the problem statement, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car costs $4. So, the total value of the doll and the red cars is $3 x 3 = $9 + $4 = $13.
3. Since the action figures cost $5 each, the total value of 3 action figures is $5 x 3 = $15.
4. Therefore, the total value of all toys is $13 + $15 = $28.

So, the answer is $28."
"Response:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of the accountant from the lost income due to doing her own taxes.

"Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to multiply the total amount by 12. So if she pays 50% more than the minimum for each debt, she will pay:
$300 x 1.5 = $450/month (student loans)
$200 x 1.5 = $300/month (credit card)
$500 x 1.5 = $750/month (mortgage)
So in a year, Jessica pays:
$450 x 12 = $5,400 (student loans)
$300 x 12 = $3,600 (credit card)
$750 x 12 = $9,000 (mortgage)
In total, Jessica pays $18,000 per year on her debts."
Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the time it takes him to peel and cut each potato by the number of potatoes he needs to prepare.

Number of red roses = Number of white carnations x 4 = 3 x 4 = 12

So, Fred must deliver 12 red roses by 5 pm to satisfy Sandra's demand."
Response:  Jean is 32 years old.
"Response:  To solve this problem we need to find the time it takes for each member of the slower team to complete their 400 meter leg. Since each runner's time decreases by 3 seconds per runner, we can use the following formula to calculate the total time for each runner: Time = 60 + (3 x Runner Number) Where ""Runner Number"" ranges from 1 to 4, since there are 4 runners on the team. So, if the first runner completes their leg in 60 seconds, the second runner must complete their leg in 57 seconds (60 + 3), the third runner must complete their leg in 54 seconds (57 + 3), and so on. Now, let's compare these times with the times of the better-rounded team: Team A: Each runner completed their leg in exactly 55 seconds. Therefore, they finished the race in exactly 2200 seconds (4 x 55). Team B: First runner took 60 seconds to complete their leg, second runner took 57 seconds, third runner took 54 seconds, and fourth runner took 51 seconds (since each runner ran 3 seconds faster than the previous runner). Therefore, Team B finished the race in 2180 seconds (4 x 55 + 3 x (57 - 60)). From here, we can see that Team B finishes the race 20 seconds behind Team A."

Since Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, and he edits 1000 sentences, he earns 5000 cents (or $5) from Publisher A. Now, since Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, he earns 2 x 5000 = 10,000 cents ($10) from Publisher B. Therefore, Mark makes a total of 15,000 cents ($15) in a week.
Response:  Every day, Baldur gets 5 x 12 = 60 liters of water in the morning and 6 x 6 = 36 liters of water in the afternoon, for a total of 96 liters per day.
Response:  John made $104,000 that year ($2000 x 52 weeks + $5000 award).
Response:  The farm produces 10 acres x 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the farm produces 50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year.
Response:  Carl used 24 slices of cheese in total during the week (6 slices/day x 3 meals/day + 1 extra slice/omelet + 8 slices/mac & cheese).
Response:  Janet has 38 pens (22 x green + 10 x yellow) + 6 x (9 x blue + 6 x red) = 38 pens.
"Response:  To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we can use the formula for calculating a weighted average:

average = (highest score x number of highest scores) + (next highest score x number of next highest scores) +... + (lowest score x number of lowest scores)

In this case, Brinley has already taken five tests with scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The highest score is 100, so the number of highest scores is 1. The next highest score after that is 92, so the number of next highest scores is 1. The lowest score is 71, so the number of lowest scores is 1.

Using the formula above, we can calculate Brinley's average as follows:

average = (100 x 1) + (92 x 1) + (86 x 1) = 93

So, Brinley needs to get a score of at least 93 on the sixth test to get an overall average of 93."
Response:  Total distance = 5 x 25 km + 4 x 60 km = 175 km + 240 km = 415 km
"Response:  The weight of the bag of candy is equal to the sum of the weights of all the individual pieces of candy. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples, the total weight of the bag of candy is:
Weight of bag = Weight of chocolate bars + Weight of candied apples
= 2 x (25 x 40) + 80
= 1000 + 6400
= 7400 g
Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs approximately 7400 grams or 7.4 kilograms."
Response:  After all three days, Rose bought a total of 60 cakes.
Response:  The total cost of buying each cup is $40.
Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to subtract the amount of money she has already saved ($10) from the total cost of the jacket and shoes ($50). So, if Sara mows the lawn 4 times (since that is how much it pays), she will have earned $4 x 4 = $16. Since $16 is less than $50, Sara only needs to mow the lawn 3 more times to be able to afford the jacket and shoes.
Response:  Let's assume that Jerry has x red chickens. Since every red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since every white chicken produces 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(2) = 10 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42 + 10 = 52 eggs per day. Now, we are given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This means that if he has x red chickens, he has x + 2 white chickens. So, the number of red chickens must be half of the total number of chickens Jerry has, which is x/2.
Response:  Gary will spend 2 hours walking if he walks at 3 miles per hour.
"Response:  To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to add the number of customers she counted each day:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 50 + 100 = 150 customers
Day 3: 150 + 50 = 200 customers

So, Sloane counted 200 customers on the third day."
Response:  The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.
Response:  Lori needs to work 40 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt.
"Response:  The remaining balance after 12 months will be:
$2000 x (1 + 0.10) = $2300
So, Janeth's remaining balance will be $2300 - $165 x 12 = $1985."
"Response:  Total number of flowers in the vase = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
= 4 + (7 - 4)
= 15
Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"Response:  The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after three years will be:
Adrian's age = 3 x (Harriet's age + Zack's age)
= 3 x (21 + X)
= 63

So, the average age of the three after three years will be 63 years old."
Response:  Jojo scored 49 points.
Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle. For the crossword puzzles, it took her 10 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 10 x 3 = 30 minutes solving crossword puzzles. For the sudoku puzzles, it took her 5 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 5 x 8 = 40 minutes solving sudoku puzzles. Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
Response:  The amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters is 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30). Since she collected rainwater that is twice as much, there are 60 liters of additional water in the tank (30 + 60 = 90). So, there are 90 liters of water in the tank now.
Response:  Andy plants 130 flowers (90 geraniums + 40 fewer petunias).
Response:  The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $22,500 ($15,000 x 3/4).
"Response:  The total cost of the rentals is:
Carlos's cost = $30 x 3 = $90
Benji's cost = $18 x 5 = $90
So, together they will pay $180 for their rentals."
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester, then it will take 3 days to travel by car from Rochester back to New Jersey (since the journey is half as long). Therefore, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, he will travel for a total of 9 days.
Response:  The probability that a randomly picked card will be a water type after losing 8 of them and buying 14 more is (40/94) x 100 = 42.6%
Response:  $6.50 + ($2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.25 x 2) = $9.75 และ $5.00 (gift card) - $9.75 = $4.25 ทุกคืนมีค่าที่ไม่ได้รับเงิน $4.25
Response:  To find out how long it will take for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to know how many pieces are in the puzzle. If there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, then Kalinda can do 4 pieces per minute, so she will finish 90 pieces per hour (4 x 25 = 90). Since her mom can only do half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom will finish 45 pieces per hour (half of 90). Therefore, it will take them 21 hours to complete the puzzle (90 / 45 = 21).
Response:  After two weeks, there were 90 melons left that weren't ready to be harvested (since 70% of the remaining melons were ready). So, the total number of melons that weren't ready to be harvested was 90 + 30 = 120.
"Response:  To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the cars first. There are 12 cars in total, so their cost is:

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Then, Mark pays 10% tax on the cost of the cars, which is:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

Next, he pays an additional $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars, which comes to:

$240,000 + $24,000 + (12 x $1000) = $308,000

So, Mark pays a total of $308,000 for the fleet of 12 cars."
Response:  Kylie collects 30 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  The total number of insects in the garden is 25 (50 - 1/2 = 25).
Response: 24 (1/3 x 36)
Response:  To find out how many vines Steve needs, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes he wants to eat by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce in a week. In this case, Steve wants to eat 6 tomatoes per day, so he needs 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes per week. Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, Steve needs 42 / 3 = 14 vines.
Response:  John needs to order 5 pizzas.
Response:  To find out how many total pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the number of pens he will be able to make using the mixed ink. Since each pen contains 1/5 of the original amount of ink, if he mixes 5 empty pens together, he will have 5 x 1/5 = 1 full pen of ink left over. So, if he uses these 25 pens to make new pens as the ink runs low, he will end up with 25 - 1 = 24 new pens. Therefore, Ram gets to have 24 total pens.
Response:  After a year, Johnny had $30.
Response:  The sum of the ages of the three girls is 53 years (Mary's age + Joan's age - Jessa's age).
Response:  Let's denote the total number of students as x. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, the number of students who went out through exit A is 0.3x = 300. Similarly, since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, the number of students who went out through exit B is 0.6x / 5 = 240. Finally, the number of students who went out through exit C is x - (0.3x + 0.6x / 5) = x - 0.9x / 5 = 0.1x = 100. Therefore, 100 students went out through exit C.
Response:  John has 32 more candies than James.
Response:  At the beginning, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book, so together they have 3 books. After reading each other's books, they will have a total of 6 books (2 + 1 + 3). So, at the end, they will collectively read 6 books.
Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to first calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Since each person sends 2 letters per week and each letter is 5 pages long, there are 10 pages per week (2 letters x 5 pages/letter). Then, since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 10 pages per week. Therefore, Mike spends 10 hours per week writing letters (10 pages / 6 minutes per page = 10 hours/week).
Response:  If Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls this month, that means he has used 700 minutes (300 + 400) more than his plan allows. So, he has 2000 - 700 = 1300 minutes left in his plan for the month. Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason has 1300 / 30 = 43.33 minutes left each day on his plan.
Response:  Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries.
Response:  Let's call the number of fish in Aquarium A x. Then, we know that the number of snails in Aquarium A is 4x/2. Similarly, the number of snails in Aquarium B is 32 - (2x/3). Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the equation: 4x/2 = 32 - (2x/3). Solving for x gives us x = 16. So, there are 16 fish in each aquarium.
Response:  Jean pays $3,750.
Response:  Each person paid $79 / 3 = $26.33.
Response:  The chef spent a total of $675.
Response:  Let's call the number of cookies that Sue ate on Monday x. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, her sister ate x/4 = 8 cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister, so her sister ate x/2 = 6 cookies on Tuesday. The total number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister together is x + x/4 = 9x/4. Since Sue ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, the difference in the number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister is 13 - 5 = 8. Therefore, Sue consumed 8 more calories than her sister.
