"Response:  
Jennet sells 16 eggs per day at $2 each (farmers market price). 
She has 3 hens that lay eggs every morning and 5 chickens that produce 4 eggs each day. 
So, in total, Jennet gets: 
3 x 4 = 12 eggs from her hens + 5 x 4 = 20 eggs from her chickens = 32 eggs per day. 
At $2 per egg, Jennet earns: 
32 eggs x $2 = $64 per day."
"Response:  We need to paint two blue walls and one pale wall with white paint. To calculate how many buckets of paint we need, let's assume that each bucket contains 5 liters of paint.

For the two blue walls, we need 2 x 5 = 10 liters of paint.
For the pale wall, we need 5 liters of paint.
In total, we need 10 + 5 = 15 liters of paint."
"Response:  We know that Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on renovations. The total cost of the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. If the value of the house increased by 150%, then the new value would be:

$130,000 x 1.5 = $195,000

So, Josh made a profit of $195,000 - $80,000 = $115,000."
Response:  We know that James runs three sprints of 60 meters each in a day. So, he runs a total distance of 180 meters (60 x 3) per day.
"Response:  We know that Vendzi has 20 curiae (cups) of food for each of her three meals per day, and she gives each cup to her cubs in three separate feedings. So, in total, she feeds them 60 cups of food per day (3 x 20). Now, we need to find out how many cups of food she needs to give to her cubs at the end of the day, assuming they eat 15 cups of food in the first part of the day and 25 cups in the second part. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups they ate in the first part of the day from the total number of cups she fed them, leaving us with the number of cups she needs to give them at the end of the day. Here's the calculation:

60 cups - 15 cups = 45 cups

So, Vendzi needs to give her cubs 45 cups of food at the end of the day."
Response:  We know that the first bottle costs $5 and each subsequent bottle costs 60% of the previous one. So if we want to buy 16 bottles, we need to calculate how much we will pay for the first bottle and then add up all the remaining bottles. First bottle = $5 Next 15 bottles = (15 x $3) = $45 Total cost = $5 + $45 = $50
"Response:  We know that in Charleston there are four times as many avocadoes as in Toulouse, and in Seattle there are twice as many avocadoes as in Toulouse. So if we have x avocadoes in Toulouse, then in Charleston we will have 4x avocadoes, and in Seattle we will have 2x avocadoes. Now let's find out how many avocadoes we have in each city:

In Toulouse, we have x avocadoes.
In Charleston, we have 4x avocadoes.
In Seattle, we have 2x avocadoes.

Now, we want to find out how many avocadoes we have in Seattle when there are 20 avocadoes in Toulouse. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

20 = x + 2(4x) + 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation:

20 = x + 8x + 4x

Combine like terms:

20 = 12x + 4x

Solve for x:

20 = 16x

Divide both sides by 16:

x = 120

So, there are 120 avocadoes in Toulouse, 480 avocadoes in Charleston, and 240 avocadoes in Seattle."
"Response:  We know that Carla can download at most 2 GB per hour (2 Gb/h). The file size is 200 GB, so it will take approximately 100 hours to download the entire file (200 GB / 2 Gb/h = 100 h). However, Windows forces a restart after 40% of the download has been completed, which takes 20 minutes (20 min). Therefore, the total time required to download the file will be:

100 h + 20 min = 120 h or 5 days and 8 hours."
"Response:  We know that John traveled for three hours at an average speed of 100 km/h, and then he returned home. So, we can calculate his total distance traveled as follows:

Total distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/h x 3 h = 300 km

Now, let's consider the second part of the journey when John was returning home. He traveled for four hours at an average speed of 80 km/h. Therefore, we can calculate his total distance traveled as follows:

Total distance = Speed x Time = 80 km/h x 4 h = 320 km

So, in total, John traveled 300 + 320 = 620 km from home."
"Response:  We know that Eliza worked for 45 hours this week and her standard hourly wage is $10. However, she received an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate for the first 40 hours worked. So, we need to calculate her total earnings for the week.

First, let's calculate her regular hourly earnings for the first 40 hours:

40 hours x $10/hour = $400

Now, let's calculate her overtime earnings for the remaining 5 hours:

5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 (overtime rate) = $60

Total earnings for the week:

$400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza earned $460 for the week."
"Response:  We know that the number of downloads in the first month was 60 times higher than the number of downloads in the second month. So if we let X be the number of downloads in the second month, then the number of downloads in the first month would be 60X.

We also know that the number of downloads in the third month was 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month. So if we let Y be the number of downloads in the third month, then Y = 0.7X (since 30% is the same as 0.7).

Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

60X + Y =? (the total number of downloads over three months)

where X and Y are the numbers of downloads in the second and third months, respectively.

Solving for X and Y, we get:

X = 20 (since 60X = 1200)
Y = 840 (since Y = 0.7X = 0.7(20))

So there were 20 downloads in the second month and 840 downloads in the third month, for a total of 1060 downloads over the three months."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of baked goods that Yana purchased:

1. Pancakes (3 dozen): 3 x 68 = 204 dollars
2. Mini-keks (2 dozen): 2 x 80 = 160 dollars
3. Minichirvanovy keksy (6 dozen): 6 x 55 = 330 dollars

Total cost: 204 + 160 + 330 = 794 dollars"
"Response:  We know that the tree will produce 7 citrons per year and each citron can be sold for $1.5. However, to maintain the tree, we need to spend $3 per year. To calculate how many years it will take to start earning money from the tree, we need to subtract the maintenance cost from the revenue. So, the calculation is:

Revenue - Maintenance Cost = Profit

Profit / Year = Number of Years to Start Earning Money

Now, let's plug in the numbers:

Revenue - Maintenance Cost = $1.5 x 7 - $3
= $10.5 - $3
= $7.5

Profit / Year = $7.5

Number of Years to Start Earning Money = $\frac{7.5}{3}$
= 2.5 years

Therefore, it will take approximately 2.5 years to start earning money from the lemon tree."
"Response:  Melania has 5 fireflies in total, and she started with 3 in the green house and 2 in the red house. So, if we subtract 3 (the number of fireflies in the green house) from 5 (the total number of fireflies), we get:

5 - 3 = 2

Therefore, Melania had 2 fireflies left after moving 3 to the red house."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 students in the class and 20% of them are enrolled in modern dance, which is 4 students (20 x 0.2 = 4). 
We also know that 25% of the remaining students (i.e., those who did not choose modern dance) are enrolled in jazz dance, which is 5 students (20 x 0.25 = 5). 
So, in total, how many students will learn hip-hop dance? To find out, we need to subtract the number of students learning modern dance and jazz dance from the total number of students. In this case, it would be: 
20 - 4 - 5 = 11 
Therefore, 11 students will learn hip-hop dance."
"Response:  We have two options: jewelry for $ 5000 or electronics for $ 8000. The market for jewelry increases by 2.5% per month, while the market for electronics increases by 1.2% per month. To maximize profits at the end of the month, we need to calculate which option will bring more profit.

Firstly, let's calculate the profit from each option:

Option 1 (Jewelry): Profit = $ 5000 x 2.5% = $ 125

Option 2 (Electronics): Profit = $ 8000 x 1.2% = $ 96

Now, let's compare the profits:

Profit from Option 1 (Jewelry) = $ 125
Profit from Option 2 (Electronics) = $ 96

Since the profit from Option 1 is higher than Option 2, it is better to choose Jewelry as the best investment option to maximize profits at the end of the month."
"Response:  We know that each train travels for two days and covers a distance of 240 kilometers per day. So, we can calculate the total distance traveled by each train as follows:

Day 1:
Train A travels for 80 miles (as mentioned in the problem)
Train B travels for 160 miles (since it travels for twice the time as Train A)

Total distance traveled by both trains on Day 1 = 80 + 160 = 240 miles

Day 2:
Train A travels for 240 kilometers (as mentioned in the problem)
Train B travels for 240 kilometers (since it also travels for the same distance as Train A)

Total distance traveled by both trains on Day 2 = 240 + 240 = 480 kilometers

Therefore, the total distance traveled by each train over the two days is:

For Train A: 240 + 240 = 480 kilometers
For Train B: 240 + 240 = 480 kilometers

So, the average speed of each train over the two days is:

For Train A: 480 / 2 = 240 km/day
For Train B: 480 / 2 = 240 km/day"
"Response:  We know that Jana works as a teacher for 50 weeks per year and has two types of workdays - 35 days in June (as a teacher) and 15 days in June (as a trainer). So we need to calculate her monthly salary first, then convert it to an annual salary.

Monthly Salary = Total weekly hours x Hourly wage
= (35 weeks x 40 hours/week) + (15 weeks x 40 hours/week)
= (1400 hours) + (600 hours)
= 2000 hours

Hourly Wage = $20/hour (for teaching) + $30/hour (for training)
= $20 x 2000 hours + $30 x 600 hours
= $40,000 + $18,000
= $58,000/year

Therefore, Jana's annual salary is $58,000."
Response:  If Claire lays 3 eggs each morning and there are 4 days in a week, then she will lay a total of 3 x 4 = 12 eggs per week.
Response:  We know that Marya walked for 12 miles and then rested for an hour. After the rest, she continued walking for another 4 miles. So in total, Marya walked for 16 miles (12 + 4). Now we need to find out how many minutes she spent resting during her break. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the number of miles she walked after her break (4 miles) by 60 to get the number of minutes she spent resting: 4 miles / 60 = 0.067 hours or approximately 4 minutes. Therefore, Marya spent 4 minutes resting during her break.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice with 3 drops of vinegar and we want to add 15 liters of beer with 5 drops of vinegar. After adding the beer, we will pour out 1 liter of orange juice. So, how many drops of vinegar will be left in the remaining 24 liters (10 + 15)?

Let X be the number of drops of vinegar in the 10 liters of orange juice. Since there are 3 drops in 10 liters, X = 3.

Now, let Y be the number of drops of vinegar in the 15 liters of beer. Since there are 5 drops in 15 liters, Y = 5.

After adding the beer, we will have a total of 24 liters (10 + 15) with a total of X + Y = 8 + 5 = 13 drops of vinegar.

Since we poured out 1 liter of orange juice, we will have 24 - 1 = 23 liters of liquid left. Therefore, the number of drops of vinegar in the remaining 23 liters is 13."
Response:  We know that Raeymand is 31 years old and has been married to Samantha for 6 years before their son was born. So, if we subtract 6 from 31, we get 25 as the age of Raeymand when his son was born. Now, let's calculate the age of the son. Since he is 23 years old now, we can say that he was born 23 - 25 = 2 years ago. Therefore, the son of Raeymand was born 2 years ago.
"Response:  We know that the first three clients buy one DVD each, so we need to calculate how many DVDs Billy has after these three clients have made their purchases. Then, we can determine how many DVDs are left for the remaining four clients.

1. First client buys one DVD.
2. Second client buys one DVD.
3. Third client buys one DVD.

Now, Billy has no more DVDs left. He has sold all three DVDs to the first three clients. Therefore, the answer is:

0 DVDs."
Response:  We know that for each hour (гадзіну) of burning, the candle grows 2 centimeters (сантыметры). So if we want to find out how many centimeters the candle will grow from 13 to 17 hours, we need to calculate the total growth for those 4 hours. Total growth = 4 hours x 2 cm/hour = 8 cm. Therefore, after 13-17 hours, the candle will be 8 cm taller than it was initially.
"Response:  We know that Kyle bought the book at a discount of 25% off the original price. So if he paid $19.50 for the book, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

$19.50 = (Original Price) x (1 - Discount Percentage)

where (Original Price) is the price before the discount and (Discount Percentage) is the percentage discount applied. In this case, the discount percentage is 25%.

So we can solve for the original price as follows:

$19.50 = (Original Price) x (1 - 0.25)

$19.50 = Original Price x 0.75

Now divide both sides by 0.75 to find the original price:

Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75

Original Price = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26 before the 25% discount."
"Response:  We know that Mary ordered 5 packs of mackerel for $3 each and 4 apples for $1.5 each. So she paid in total:

5 x $3 = $15 + $1.5 x 4 = $6

Total amount paid by Mary is $21.5.

Now we need to find out how many pizza boxes Mary ordered if each box costs $8.50. To do this, let's divide the total amount paid by Mary by the cost per box:

$21.5 / $8.50 =?

Solve for the number of boxes:

$21.5 / $8.50 = 25

Therefore, Mary ordered 25 pizza boxes."
"Response:  We know that Mishka bought three pairs of shorts, three pairs of pants, and three pairs of boots. The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50, the cost of one pair of pants is $22.50, and the cost of one pair of boots is $42. To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to multiply the number of items she bought by their respective costs. So, for shorts: 3 x $16.50 = $49.50; for pants: 3 x $22.50 = $67.50; and for boots: 3 x $42 = $126. Total amount spent by Mishka: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243."
"Response:  
1) The cost of one card with 15 pores is $4.00. 
2) Sincity buys cards every evening. 
3) She has been doing this for 60 days. 
Now let's calculate how much money Sincity will spend in total if she continues to buy cards at the same rate for another 60 days. 
To do this, we need to know how many cards she buys each day and how much it costs her. 
Let's assume that Sincity buys 15 cards per day (since each card has 15 pores). So, the daily cost for her would be: 
$4 x 15 = $60 per day. 
Since she has been doing this for 60 days already, her total spending so far would be: 
$60 x 60 = $3600. 
If she continues to buy cards at the same rate for another 60 days, her total spending would be: 
$60 x 60 x 2 = $7200."
"Response:  We know that Henry drove for 60 miles and stopped twice - once after driving for 20 miles and then again after another 15 miles. So we can start by finding out how far he drove between his first and second stops. To do this, we need to subtract the distance he drove before his first stop from the total distance he drove (60 miles):

60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles

So Henry drove 40 miles between his first and second stops. Now let's find out how far he drove in total between both stops:

40 miles + 15 miles = 55 miles

Therefore, Henry drove a total of 55 miles between his two stops."
"Response:  We know that one pair of boots costs $50 and another pair of high-quality boots costs more than $50 but less than $100. The total cost of both pairs of boots is $80. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let x be the cost of the first pair of boots (in dollars)
Let y be the cost of the second pair of boots (in dollars)

We know that x + y = 80...(1)

Since the first pair of boots costs $50, we have:
x = 50...(2)

Substituting (2) into (1), we get:
y = 80 - 50
y = 30...(3)

Therefore, the cost of the second pair of boots is $30."
Response:  If Allen and Darrel are 7 years old now, then their age difference is 7 - 1 = 6 years. In 10 years, Allen will be 6 + 10 = 16 years old.
"Response:  We have three people who are guessing how many apples are in a basket. The first person thinks there are 80 apples, the second person thinks there are 20 more than the first person, and the third person thinks there are 25% more than the first person. To find the average number of apples, we need to add up all their guesses and divide by the number of people. So, let's do that:

80 + (20 more) + (25% more) = 80 + 20 + 20/4 = 80 + 20 + 5 = 105

Now, we divide the total number of apples by the number of people:

105 / 3 = 35

So, the average number of apples in the basket is 35."
"Response: 

1) John has 10 sausages and he wants to give each one 5 minutes of exercise in the day.
2) There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60/5 = 12 half-hour periods in a day (since we want to divide the time into half-hour periods).
3) Since John wants to give each sausage 5 minutes of exercise, he will have 10 x 5 = 50 half-hour periods for all his sausages.
4) Therefore, John will spend 50 half-hour periods exercising his sausages in a day.

So, John spends 50 half-hours or 7.5 hours (50/60) exercising his sausages every day."
"Response:  We know that there are 110 men in Greece and 30 of them have more than 10 slaves each. So, we can start by finding out how many slaves there are in total.

Total number of slaves = Number of men with more than 10 slaves x Number of slaves per man
= 30 x (Number of slaves per man)

Now, we need to find out the average number of slaves per man. Since there are 110 men in Greece, and 30 of them have more than 10 slaves each, we can assume that the remaining 80 men have fewer than 10 slaves each.

Average number of slaves per man = Total number of slaves / Number of men
= (Total number of slaves) / 110

Substituting the values, we get:

Average number of slaves per man = (30 x Number of slaves per man) / 110
= (30 x ) / 110

Since there are 30 men with more than 10 slaves each, the total number of slaves they own is:

Total number of slaves = 30 x 10
= 300

So, the average number of slaves per man is:

Average number of slaves per man = 300 / 110
= 2.73

Therefore, there are approximately 2.73 slaves per man in Greece."
"Response:  We know that Aaron has twice as many stones as Silvan and five times as many birds as Raymond. So if Raymond has 40 stones, how many stones does Silvan have?

Let x be the number of stones Silvan has. Since Aaron has twice as many stones as Silvan, Aaron has 2x stones. And since Raymond has five times as many birds as Silvan, Raymond has 5x birds.

We know that the total number of stones is 40 (Raymond has 40 stones). So we can set up the following equation:

2x + 5x = 40

Simplifying the equation:

7x = 40

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 6

So Silvan has 6 stones."
Response:  We know that Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. In the next 20 minutes, he improved his performance by 25%. So, if he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, he would have scored (4 x 1.25) = 5 points in the second 20 minutes. Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is 4 + 5 = 9 points.
Response:  We know that there are 2 yogurts in each cup and we pay $5 for 4 cups of yogurt. So, we spend $5 x 4 = $20 on yogurt. If we have 30 days, then we will consume 20/30 = 2/3 cup of yogurt per day. Since there are 2 yogurts in each cup, we will consume 2 x 2 = 4 yogurts per day. Therefore, we will consume 4 x 30 = 120 yogurts in total over 30 days.
Response:  John has 13 sets of Lego and he sells each set for $15. He buys 8 sets for $20 and has $5 left. So, he has 13 - 8 = 5 more sets of Lego. Each set contains 4-6 pieces, so he has 5 x (4-6) = 20-30 pieces of Lego in total.
"Response:  We know that John runs for 3 days in September and he runs for 3 hours on the first day and 5 hours on the second and third days. So we can start by calculating how many kilometers John runs each day:

Day 1: 3 hours x 10 km/hour = 30 km
Day 2: 5 hours x 10 km/hour = 50 km
Day 3: 5 hours x 10 km/hour = 50 km

Total distance run in September: 30 + 50 + 50 = 130 km

Therefore, John runs 130 km in September."
"Response:  We know that Yana can run 4 times faster than she can walk, and she can walk for 6 hours (360 minutes) without resting. If she runs, she can cover 5 kilometers in an hour (3600 seconds). So, if she runs for 6 hours, she will cover:

5 km/h x 6 h = 30 km

Now, let's calculate how far she can go in 6 hours while walking at her normal pace. Since she can walk for 6 hours without resting, we know that she can walk for:

6 h x 12 min/h = 72 min

So, if she walks for 72 minutes, she will cover:

72 min x 1.4 m/min (since she walks at a speed of 1.4 meters per minute) = 1008 meters

Therefore, Yana can walk for 72 minutes and cover 1008 meters, which is approximately 1 kilometer."
Response:  If Ben's iPhone is four years older than Suzie's iPhone, and Suzie's iPhone is one year old, then Ben's iPhone must be five years old (4 + 1 = 5).
"Response:  We know that Polly can throw the sapphire (a heavy object) to a distance of 120 meters when she is not holding any other objects. Now, let's consider two cases:

Case 1: Polly is not holding any other objects. In this case, we know that she can throw the sapphire to a distance of 120 meters. So, if she throws the sapphire at the dragon from a distance of 1000 feet (305 meters), it will reach the dragon after covering a total distance of 120 + 305 = 425 meters.

Case 2: Polly is holding the precious stone (a light object). In this case, we know that she can throw the dagger (a heavier object than the sapphire) to a distance of 120 meters three times farther away than when she is not holding any other objects. So, if she throws the dagger at the dragon from a distance of 1000 feet (305 meters), it will reach the dragon after covering a total distance of 3 x 120 = 360 meters.

Now, let's calculate the distance at which Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the dagger while holding the precious stone. We know that she can throw the dagger to a distance of 360 meters. If she stands at a distance of x feet from the dragon, the dagger will cover a distance of 360 - x feet before reaching the dragon. Since Polly wants to avoid getting burned by the dragon's fire, she must stand at a distance greater than or equal to the range of the dragon's fire, which is 1000 feet. Therefore, the minimum distance at which Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the dagger while holding the precious stone is:

x = 1000 - 360 = 640 feet

So, Polly can stand at a distance of 640 feet from the dragon and still hit it with the dagger while holding the precious stone."
"Response:  We know that Babula Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple pie in total. If we assume that each guest took an equal number of pieces (let's say x), then we can set up the following equation:

x + 5(8) = 14

where 5(8) represents the total number of pieces taken by all guests (5 x 8 = 40).

Solving for x, we get:

x = 14 - 5(8)
= 14 - 5(40)
= 14 - 200
= -186

So, there were -186 pieces of apple pie left over after all the guests finished eating."
"Response:  We know that we have a package of 300 grams and it contains 5 portions of 250 calories each. Our daily caloric intake is 2000 calories, and we have already consumed 1800 calories. So, to calculate how many grams we can eat, we need to subtract our daily caloric intake from what we have already eaten.

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for today

Now, let's divide the remaining calories by the number of portions we have:

200 / 5 = 40 calories per portion

So, we can eat 40 calories more today."
"Response:  Charlie has 1 pound (453.6 grams) of beeswax and wants to make candles that are 10 cm long each. According to the problem, for every kilogram of beeswax, he can produce 10 candles. So, for 1 pound of beeswax, he can produce:

1 pound / 453.6 grams per kilogram = approximately 2.2 kilograms (or 2,200 grams) of candles

Since each candle is 10 cm long, their total length would be:

2.2 kilograms x 10 cm/kilogram = approximately 220 cm or 2.2 meters

Now, let's calculate the cost of making these candles. If Charlie sells each candle for $2, then his revenue from selling all 220 candles would be:

220 candles x $2 per candle = $440

However, we need to subtract the cost of the beeswax. Since 1 pound of beeswax costs $10, the total cost of producing all 220 candles would be:

$10 per pound x 2.2 pounds (of beeswax used) = $22

So, Charlie's net profit from selling all 220 candles would be:

$440 - $22 = $418

Therefore, if Charlie produces and sells 220 candles made from 1 pound of beeswax at $2 each, his net profit will be $418."
"Response:  We know that in total, Meridyty wrote 5 articles in the previous week and 2/5 more articles in the authorship than in the panels. So, she wrote 5 + (2/5) = 5 + 0.4 = 5.4 articles in the authorship. In addition, we are told that she spent 4 hours writing each article. Therefore, the total number of hours Meridyty spent writing all these articles is:

5.4 x 4 = 21.6 hours."
"Response:  We know that Kandyce bought 220 cups of coffee and had 23 packets of sugar left. Each packet contains 10 spoons of sugar, so we can calculate how many spoons of sugar she had in total:

23 packets x 10 spoons/packet = 230 spoons

Now, let's divide the number of spoons of sugar by the number of cups of coffee she bought to find out how much sugar was in each cup:

230 spoons / 220 cups = approximately 1 spoon of sugar per cup

So, Kandyce had approximately 1 spoon of sugar in each cup of coffee."
"Response:  We know that John bought more red galleons than silver ones, and the price of red galleons is 50% higher than the price of silvers. So if the price of silvers is $40 per calavera, then the price of red galleons would be $64 per calavera ($40 x 1.5). Since John spent $200 on galleons, we can calculate how much he spent on each type of galleon as follows:

Red Galleons: $200 / $64 per calavera = 312 calaveras
Silver Galleons: $200 - $312 = $72 (since $312 is the cost of red galleons)

Therefore, John spent $72 on silver galleons."
Response:  We know that Tracy used a wire of length 4 feet to make pendants for her garden. She divided the wire into 6 equal parts using a cutter. So, each part is 1/6 of the total length of the wire, which is 4 feet / 6 = 0.67 feet or approximately 22 inches long. Therefore, Tracy made 6 pendants in total.
Response:  We know that Richard lives in a 15-story building and each floor has 8 apartments. So, there are 15 floors x 8 apartments per floor = 120 apartments in total. Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that 3/4 x 120 = 90 apartments are occupied. Therefore, there are 90 vacancies in the building.
"Response:  If Lloyd sells each egg for $2 per dozen and he has 252 eggs per day, then he sells:

252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs per day

At $2 per dozen, his daily income from egg sales is:

20 dozen x $2/dozen = $40 per day

So, in one week (7 days), Lloyd earns:

$40 per day x 7 days = $280 per week

Therefore, Lloyd makes approximately $280 per week selling eggs."
"Response:  We know that Tom can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour for one and four hours in the morning. So he will cover:

1 hour x 10 miles/hour = 10 miles
4 hours x 10 miles/hour = 40 miles

In total, Tom will cover 50 miles in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take him to return back to his starting point from a distance of 6 miles away. To do this, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is 6 miles, and the speed is also 10 miles per hour (since he covered 50 miles in the morning).

Time = 6 miles / 10 miles/hour = 0.6 hours or 36 minutes

Therefore, Tom will spend 36 minutes returning back to his starting point, so the total time he spends outside is:

Total Time = Morning Time + Returning Time
= 1 hour + 36 minutes
= 2 hours and 36 minutes"
"Response:  We know that Urya has 30 comics and each comic weighs 1.5 kg, so the total weight of all comics is:

30 x 1.5 = 45 kg

Now, let's calculate how much weight Urya needs to remove from his backpack to meet the limit of 5 kg. We can subtract the weight of the comics from the total weight of the backpack:

5 kg - 45 kg = -40 kg

Since we cannot have a negative weight, we need to add something to make the calculation positive. Let's assume that Urya also has some other items in his backpack with a total weight of 40 kg (this is just an assumption, as we don't know what else he might have in there). So, the final calculation would be:

5 kg - 45 kg + 40 kg = 9 kg

Therefore, Urya needs to remove 9 kg from his backpack to meet the limit of 5 kg."
"Response:  We know that the mechanic earns $60 for each tire and $40 for each car tire. If he has 6 truck tires and 4 cars to repair on Tuesday, then his income from these repairs will be:

$60 x 6 = $360 (for truck tires) + $40 x 4 = $160 (for car tires) = $520

On Friday, if he repairs 12 machines, but does not repair any truck tires, his income will be:

$40 x 12 = $480 (for car tires only)

So, the mechanic will earn more money on Tuesday ($520) than on Friday ($480)."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 cats in the Dauthfair family and each cat has 12 kittens (except for Patchy, who had three more). So, if we multiply 7 by 12, we get:

7 x 12 = 84

Now, let's add the extra kittens from Patchy:

84 + 3 = 87

Therefore, there are 87 cats in the Dauthfair family."
Response:  If Jean has 30 cigarettes and he wants to pack two packets of 15 cigarettes each, then he needs 30 - 2 = 28 cigarettes for one packet. So, Jean can make two packets with 28 and 29 cigarettes respectively.
"Response:  We know that Peter has $42 for the month and he spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn. So, how many times can he go to the movies?

We can start by subtracting the cost of the ticket and popcorn from his total amount of money:

$42 - $7 - $7 =?

Can you solve this problem and find out how many times Peter can go to the movies?"
"Response:  We know that the weight of one wagon with 5 kilograms is 5 kg x 2 = 10 kg. The total weight of all wagons and empty freight cars will be:

10 kg x 4 = 40 kg

The maximum load that can be carried by the bridge is 5000 pounds (5 tons). Therefore, we need to calculate how many wagons and empty freight cars can be loaded onto the bridge without exceeding this limit:

5000 lb / 40 lb = 125 wagons or empty freight cars

So, the maximum number of wagons and empty freight cars that can be loaded onto the bridge is 125."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steven sold his products online and received $40.00 as payment. Secondly, he added 25% of the original price to the total amount, which is equal to $10 (25% of $40). Finally, he paid $3 for delivery, so the total cost to the customer was $53 ($40 + $10 + $3). Therefore, the net profit made by Steven after deducting the additional payments would be: Net Profit = Total Cost - Original Price Net Profit = $53 - $40 Net Profit = $13
"Response:  We have 6 stalks with 20 leaves each and 67 individual leaves scattered around the bushes. So we need to find out how many malinik (small berries) there are in total.

First, let's calculate the number of leaves on all six stalks:

20 x 6 = 120 leaves

Now, let's add the individual leaves scattered around the bushes:

120 + 67 = 187 leaves

So, there are 187 malinik (small berries) in total."
Response:  We have 25 oranges in total. Of those, 1 is dry (drénny), which means it cannot be eaten. That leaves us with 24 oranges. Out of these, 20% are not ripe yet (неспелыя). This means we need to subtract 20% of 24, which is 24 x 0.2 = 4.8. So, we have 24 - 4.8 = 19.2 non-ripe oranges left. Now, out of the remaining oranges, 2 are sour (кислыя). This means we need to subtract another 2 from our count. Therefore, the number of good oranges we have is 19.2 - 2 = 7.2.
Response:  Firstly, Janet paid $500 for the material to make the bracelet. Then she spent $800 to have it made by a jeweler. So in total, she paid $500 + $800 = $1300. After that, she paid 10% of this amount as insurance, which is $1300 x 10% = $130. Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1300 + $130 = $1430.
"Response:  If Mars works for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000, then her total pension fund will be:

P = 50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000

If she increases her pension by 5% each year, her pension after 20 years will be:

P = 2,000,000 x (1 + 0.05)^20 ≈ $2,768,900

After 30 years, her pension will be:

P = 2,768,900 x (1 + 0.05)^10 ≈ $4,322,350

So, Mars's annual pension after 30 years will be approximately $4,322,350."
"Response:  We know that Alena paid $140 per month for streaming services and the campaign offered a discount of 10% for the second half of the year. So we need to calculate the total amount she paid for the entire year.

First, let's calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year:

$140 x 6 months = $840

Now, let's calculate the amount she paid for the second half of the year with the discount:

$840 x (1 - 0.10) = $752

So, the total amount Alena paid for the entire year is:

$840 + $752 = $1,592"
"Response:  We know that Sofia has traveled 100 miles since her last refueling and she needs to travel another 4 gallons of gasoline to reach her destination. The capacity of her car's tank is 12 gallons. So we can calculate how many kilometers she can drive based on the amount of fuel left in the tank.

First, let's convert the distance traveled (100 miles) into kilometers:

1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers

Therefore:

100 miles = 100 x 1.60934 km = 160.934 km

Now, let's calculate how much fuel is left in the tank:

Fuel left = Capacity - Distance traveled
= 12 gal - 160.934 km
= 12 gal - 1609340 m

We can simplify this calculation by converting the distance traveled from kilometers to meters:

1 kilometer = 1000 meters

Therefore:

160.934 km = 16093400 m

Now we can calculate how many kilometers Sofia can drive based on the amount of fuel left in the tank:

Fuel left / Capacity = Distance traveled + Fuel needed
= (12 gal - 1609340 m) / 12 gal
= (16093400 m - 1609340 m) / 12 gal
= 0 km

Since there is no fuel left in the tank, Sofia cannot drive any further. She will need to refuel before continuing her journey."
"Response:  We know that John spends 2 hours watching television in the evening and then reads for less time than before. He does this three times a week. So, if we calculate the total number of hours he spends watching TV per week, it will be:

2 hours/day x 3 days/week = 6 hours/week

Now, let's find out how much time he spends reading each day. Since he reads for less time after watching TV, we can assume that he spends half the time he spent watching TV reading. Therefore,

Half of 2 hours = 1 hour

So, John spends 1 hour reading each day. To find out how many hours he spends reading per week, multiply the number of days he reads per week (3) by the amount of time he spends reading each day (1):

3 days/week x 1 hour/day = 3 hours/week

Therefore, John spends a total of 6 hours watching TV and 3 hours reading per week."
Response:  We have four schools with five players each (boys and girls) and one coach for each team. So, in total, we have 4 x 5 = 20 people who were present at all schools.
"Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds and 35 rubies in total. The number of emeralds was more than the number of rubies. So if we let E be the number of emeralds, then E > 35. Now, we also know that the total value of all precious stones was 100,000 gold coins. Since each diamond is worth 10,000 gold coins, the number of diamonds can be found as follows: 

10,000 x 175 = 1,750,000

Now, since each ruby is worth 5,000 gold coins, the number of rubies can be found as follows: 

5,000 x 35 = 175,000

Finally, since each emerald is worth 2,000 gold coins, the number of emeralds can be found as follows: 

2,000 x E = 2,000E

We want to find out how many emeralds there were, so we set up an equation based on this information:

1,750,000 + 175,000 + 2,000E = 100,000

Simplifying the equation:

1,925,000 + 2,000E = 100,000

Subtracting 1,925,000 from both sides:

2,000E = 875,000

Dividing both sides by 2,000:

E = 437

Therefore, there were 437 emeralds."
"Response:  We know that there are 60 children and 5 students in total. If we divide them equally among n teachers, then each teacher will have 60/n children. Since there are more boys than girls, let's assume that all 5 students are boys, so they won't be included in the count of children. Therefore, the number of teachers needed is 60/n - 5. To find n, we can set up an equation:

60/n - 5 =?

Solving for n, we get:

n = 12

So, there need to be 12 teachers to accommodate all the children, including the 5 male students."
"Response:  If Bailey has $100 and spends $5 per day for 8 days, then she will have spent a total of:

$5 x 8 = $40

So, Bailey will be left with:

$100 - $40 = $60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"Response:  We know that Judy teaches dance classes for 5 days a week (Monday to Friday) and 8 times a day (morning, afternoon, and evening). So she teaches 5 x 8 = 40 classes per week. If there are 15 students in each class and Judy earns $15 per student, then her total weekly income is:

40 classes/week x 15 students/class x $15/student = $6,000/week

Now let's calculate her monthly income. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:

$6,000/week x 4 weeks/month = $24,000/month

So Judy earns $24,000 per month teaching dance classes."
Response:  We know that Kelly has two recipes for cooking dishes, one of which has 20 instructions and the other has more than 20 instructions. To prepare both dishes, Kelly needs to read the instructions twice as much as she would need to read if she only had one recipe with 20 instructions. Therefore, Kelly needs to read 40 instructions in total (2 x 20).
"Response:  We know that Tom sells cookies for 3 dollars per dozen and cakes for 4 dollars per dozen. If he sells 43 torteks (12 x 4 = 48) and 23 luastyki keksy (12 x 2 = 24), then the total amount of money Tom will collect is:

48 x 3 = 144 + 24 x 4 = 96 = 240 dollars."
"Response:  We know that Shyla bought five major telephones for $150 each and paid for them over three months. That means she paid $150 x 5 = $750 initially. Now we need to find out how much she will pay monthly. Since there is a 2% interest rate per month, we can calculate it as follows:

$750 x (1 + 0.02)^3 = $750 x 1.02^3 = $846.40

So Shyla will pay $846.40 in total over three months, which is an average of $282.13 per month."
"Response:  We know that Arci sells three types of vegetables - marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells maligold for $2.74 per bunch, petunia for $1.87 per bunch, and begonia for $2.12 per bunch. If Arci has 12 bunches of marigolds, 9 bunches of petunias, and 17 bunches of begonias, how much will he earn in total?

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from each type of vegetable:

Marigolds: 12 bunches x $2.74 per bunch = $33.08
Petunias: 9 bunches x $1.87 per bunch = $16.83
Begonias: 17 bunches x $2.12 per bunch = $35.34

Total amount earned: $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.34 = $85.25

Therefore, Arci will earn a total of $85.25 if he sells all his vegetables at their usual prices."
Response:  We know that each level of the castle has an area of ​​16 square meters, and there are four levels in total. Therefore, the total area of ​​the castle is 4 x 16 = 64 square meters.
"Response:  We know that Cessilia will have to feed her baby 110 cups of food per day in one sumochka (pack). So, if we divide this number by the number of cups of food for each meal (let's assume it is 2 cups), we get:

110 cups / 2 cups per meal = 55 meals per day

Now, let's calculate how many packs of food Cessilia will need for the first year:

55 meals per day x 365 days = 19,725 meals per year

Since each pack contains 180 cups of food, we can calculate the total number of packs needed as follows:

19,725 meals per year / 180 cups per pack = 109 packs per year

Therefore, Cessilia will need 109 packs of food for the first year of her baby's life."
"Response:  We know that Sarah produces 4 times more than David and Raymon produces less than David. So if David produces x pounds of product, then Sarah will produce 4x pounds. And Raymon will produce less than x pounds. Now we are given that the total production of Raymon and David is 400 pounds. So we can set up an equation:

Raymon + David = 400

We also know that Sarah produces 4 times more than David, so we can write another equation:

Sarah = 4David

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (Raymon and David). Can you solve for them?"
"Response:  If Vincent can buy 3 queteks for $2.50 or 2 queteks for $1, then we have two options to calculate his expenses:

Option 1 (buying 3 queteks):
3 x $2.50 = $7.50

Option 2 (buying 2 queteks):
2 x $1 = $2

Since Vincent wants to buy 18 queteks, let's see which option is more profitable:

Option 1 (buying 3 queteks):
18 x $2.50 = $45

Option 2 (buying 2 queteks):
18 x $1 = $18

As you can see, buying 2 queteks for $1 is more profitable than buying 3 queteks for $2.50. Therefore, Vincent should choose Option 2 and pay $18 for 18 queteks."
"Response:  If John buys a shaver for $100 and Grummer gives him a discount of 30%, then he will pay:

$100 x 70% = $70

So, John will pay $70 for the shaver."
"Response:  We know that there are 24 liters of water in total and one boy drank 6 liters of water. So we can start by subtracting 6 liters from 24 liters to find out how much water is left.

24 - 6 =?

Do you want to try to solve this subtraction problem yourself before I give you the answer?"
"Response:  Charlie had 10 stickers to begin with. He bought 21 more at a discount center and received 23 more as a birthday gift. So, he has a total of:

10 + 21 = 31 stickers

Now, let's subtract the number of stickers he gave to his sister (9):

31 - 9 = 22

Therefore, there are 22 stickers left in Charlie's possession."
Response:  We know that Alex weighs 4 times less than Grace, so if Grace weighs 125 pounds, then Alex weighs 125 / 4 = 31 pounds.
Response:  We have d bushes with 25 branches each. Each branch has 8 flowers. So we need to calculate the total number of flowers in all the bushes. Total number of flowers = 25 x 8 = 200 flowers.
"Response:  We know that the football team played 22 matches and Yan won 8 times more than he lost. So, if we let X be the number of matches Yan lost, then Yan won X + 8 matches. Since the total number of matches is 22, we can write the equation:

X + (X + 8) = 22... (1)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2X + 8 = 22... (2)

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

2X = 14... (3)

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

X = 7... (4)

So, Yan lost 7 matches."
"Response:  We know that there are four blocks in each of the 34 years (since the man is 34 years old), and each block has its own unique design. Therefore, we need to calculate how many culturally significant blocks have been made over the past 34 years.

To do this, let's use the formula:

Number of culturally significant blocks = Total number of blocks x Number of years with culturally significant designs

We know that there are four blocks per year, so the total number of blocks is:

Total number of blocks = 4 x 34 = 136

Now we need to find out how many years had culturally significant designs. Since the man has been making these blocks for 34 years, we can assume that all 34 years had culturally significant designs. So, the number of years with culturally significant designs is:

Number of years with culturally significant designs = 34

Now we can plug in the values to get the final answer:

Number of culturally significant blocks = 136 x 34 = 4568

Therefore, there are 4568 culturally significant blocks in the man's collection."
"Response:  We know that Greg received three signals per day, and each signal lasted for four times longer than the previous one. So if we start with the first signal, it lasted for 4x = 4 times longer than the second signal, which means it lasted for 4 x 4 = 16 times longer than the third signal. Therefore, the total number of ringing times is:

3 (signals) x 16 (duration of the first signal) + 4 (duration of the second signal) + 1 (duration of the third signal) = 3 x 16 + 4 + 1 = 50 + 4 + 1 = 55

So the total number of ringing times was 55."
"Response:  We know that Silvia worked for five years in the company and her current salary is $600 per month. According to the policy of increasing wages by 10% each year, her starting salary was $540 (600 x 0.8). So, after one year of service, her salary would be:

$540 + (10% of $540) = $540 + $54 = $604

After two years of service, her salary would be:

$604 + (10% of $604) = $604 + $60 = $664

Therefore, if Silvia continues working for another three years, her expected salary after five years will be:

$664 + (10% of $664) = $664 + $66 = $730

So, Silvia's expected salary after five years of service will be $730 per month."
Response:  We know that Marylin sold 10 times more copies than Harald. So if Marylin sold 88,000 copies, then Harald sold 88,000 / 10 = 8,800 copies.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Krystyna will spend on each package of sweets if she buys them in bulk. We know that there are 75 packages of sweets in each order and that 1/4 of all invited guests do not attend. So, if Krystyna invites 16 people (since 1/4 of 16 is 4), she will have 16 x 3 = 48 guests attending her party. Therefore, the total cost of the sweets for Krystyna will be:

48 packages x $2 per package = $96

So, Krystyna will spend $96 on sweets for her party."
"Response:  We know that one adult can eat 10 pounds of bulb salad and children eat less than adults. If there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, we need to calculate how much bulb salad TED needs to bring for everyone.

Let's assume that each child eats half as much as an adult, so they will eat 5 pounds of bulb salad. Therefore, the total amount of bulb salad needed is:

20 adults x 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds
5 children x 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds
Total = 225 pounds

So, TED needs to bring approximately 225 pounds of bulb salad to the picnic to satisfy all guests."
"Response:  We know that Jan has three more hat-making machines than Marsia, and Marsia has two more hat-making machines than Sindzi. So if we let X be the number of hat-making machines Sindzi has, then:

Marsia has 2X + 3 = 4X + 3 hat-making machines (since she has three more than Sindzi)
Jan has 3(4X + 3) = 12X + 9 hat-making machines (since he has three more than Marsia)

Now we are given that Sindzi has four hat-making machines. So we can substitute this value into one of the previous equations:

4 = 2X + 3

Solving for X, we get:

X = 2

So Marsia has 2X + 3 = 6 hat-making machines, and Jan has 12X + 9 = 12(2) + 9 = 24 hat-making machines."
Response:  We know that Emily is 5 years older than Jack and 2 years younger than Corey. So if Corey is 10 years old, then Emily is 10 + 5 = 15 years old. And since James is one year younger than Corey, he is 9 years old. Therefore, Jack is also 9 years old.
Response:  We know that Jerry has improved his running speed by 10% after changing his diet. So if Li runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, Jerry will run it in 38 x 1.1 = 41.8 seconds (since 10% of 38 is 3.8).
"Response:  We know that there are 60 sausages in each batch and we need to find out how many households will receive them. We also know that for every sausage given to a household, two cats and one dog will be given as well. So, if we divide 60 by 2 (the number of cats per household), we get:

60 / 2 = 30

This means that 30 households will receive sausages. Now, let's calculate how many dogs and cats will be given in total:

Dogs: 30 x 1 = 30
Cats: 30 x 2 = 60

So, in total, there will be 30 dogs and 60 cats given away."
Response:  We know that there are 200 fifth-graders in total and 2/5 of them are boys. So, if we divide 200 by 5, we get 40. Now, we need to find out how many girls are in the class. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the dance club, we can multiply 40 (boys) by 3/5 to get 60 girls. Therefore, there are 60 girls in the dance club.
Response:  We know that James slept for 3 hours less than Garry. So if Garry slept for 9 hours, James slept for 9 - 3 = 6 hours. Therefore, Garry slept for more hours than James. The difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.
"Response:  We know that Freda has 32 units of flour in her storehouse and she gives 1/4 of it to each of her three daughters. So, if we divide 32 by 4, we get:

32 / 4 = 8

So, Freda has given 8 units of flour to each of her three daughters."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 30 cars on the highway and we need to find out how many of them passed through the first 15-minute traffic jam. 
Firstly, let's consider the fact that some cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes at a speed of 20 km/h less than their actual speed. This means that these cars traveled at a speed of 20 km/h less than their actual speed for 15 minutes, which is equal to 3 miles per hour (mph) less than their actual speed for 15 minutes. 
Now, let's calculate the distance covered by these cars during the first 15 minutes:
Distance = Speed x Time
= (20 km/h - 3 mph) x 15 min
= 20 km/h x 15 min - 3 mph x 15 min
= 300 km - 45 km
= 255 km
So, 255 cars passed through the first 15-minute traffic jam."
"Response: 

Mary has 18 new saplings from her beloved gardener yesterday, and now she has 40 saplings in total (including the ones she already had). She plans to add one more sapling tomorrow from each of the four districts where her estate is located. So, Mary will have:

40 (current number of saplings) + 4 (new saplings from each district) = 44 saplings tomorrow."
Response:  We know that Jerry had four chickens and each chicken made a certain number of clucks before Jerry answered, and then the second chicken made a different number of clucks. So we can start with the first chicken. If it made 20 clucks before Jerry answered, then the second chicken must have made less than 20 clucks because otherwise, Jerry would not have noticed the difference. Let's say the second chicken made x clucks. Now, if the third chicken made 10 times more clucks than the second chicken, then it made 10x clucks. And finally, if the fourth chicken made 60 clucks, then the total number of clucks is 20 + x + 10x + 60 = 90. Solving for x, we get x = 35. Therefore, the second chicken made 35 clucks before Jerry answered.
Response:  We know that Sol has to read 4 pages of scientific literature from his mentor, 20 pages of social studies research from his mentor, 7 pages of history from his mentor, and 8 pages of geography from his mentor. In total, he needs to read 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages. Since he has 4 days to finish reading, he needs to read 39 / 4 = 9.75 pages per day.
Response:  John drinks 3 glasses of water with breakfast (breakfast), and he has 3 meals a day (lunch and dinner). So, in total, John drinks 3 x 3 = 9 glasses of water per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, John will drink 9 x 365 = 3285 glasses of water per year.
"Response:  We know that we need to cover 5 kilometers in each direction (i.e., total distance = 5 km x 2 = 10 km). Since we are moving at a speed of 10 minutes per kilometer, it will take us 10 minutes to cover each kilometer. Therefore, the total time required to cover the entire city will be:

Total time = Time per kilometer x Total distance
= 10 minutes/km x 10 km
= 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes."
Response:  If there are 1000 parts in the jigsaw puzzle and Yan has placed 3/4 of the figures on the board, then he has placed 750 pieces (3/4 x 1000). That means there are 250 pieces left to be placed (1000 - 750 = 250).
"Response:  If Amir has 5 pencils and each of them is sharpened 3 times more than Kodzi's pencils, then we can calculate how many times Kodzi's pencils are sharpened.

Let X be the number of times Kodzi's pencils are sharpened. Since Amir's pencils are sharpened 3 times more than Kodzi's, we know that:

X + 3 = 5 (since Amir has 5 pencils)

Solving for X, we get:

X = 2

So Kodzi's pencils are sharpened 2 times."
Response:  We have three chests with dimensions of 5x6x4 cm each. The total volume of one chest is 5 x 6 x 4 = 240 cubic centimeters (cm³). Since there are three chests, the total internal capacity of all three chests would be 3 x 240 = 720 cm³.
"Response:  We know that Frankie watched television for 7 hours in total (3 hours in the evening and 4 hours on Friday). He spent 1 hour watching each episode of his favorite show, and there were 30 episodes in total. So, if we divide 7 hours by the time he spent watching each episode (1 hour), we get:

7 hours / 1 hour = 7 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 7 episodes of his favorite show in total."
"Response:  We know that Henry made 15 more pies than he thought he would make (he thought he would make 15 fewer). So if he thought he would make x pies, then he actually made x + 15 pies. Also, we know that he sold 5 of his pies and had 110 left over. So let's set up an equation to represent this information:

x + (x + 15) = 110

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 15 = 110

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

2x = 95

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 47.5

So Henry baked 47.5 pies."
"Response:  If someone buys 10 liters of gasoline at a price of $3.00 per gallon and then receives a discount of $20 for each gallon filled up at this station, how much will they pay after receiving the discount?

First, we need to calculate the cost of 10 liters of gasoline without the discount:

10 liters x $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Now, let's apply the discount:

$30.00 - $20.00 (discount) = $10.00

Therefore, after receiving the discount, the customer will pay $10.00 for 10 liters of gasoline."
"Response:  We know that Marcel has 3 shapleys of cherries and 14 shapleys of apples, and Beatrice has 2 shapleys of strawberries and 24 shapleys of raspberries. To find out how many fruits they have in total, we need to add up their quantities.

Marcel has:

* 3 shapleys of cherries = 3 x 10 = 30 cherries
* 14 shapleys of apples = 14 x 10 = 140 apples

Total fruit quantity for Marcel: 30 + 140 = 170 fruits

Beatrice has:

* 2 shapleys of strawberries = 2 x 10 = 20 strawberries
* 24 shapleys of raspberries = 24 x 10 = 240 raspberries

Total fruit quantity for Beatrice: 20 + 240 = 260 fruits

Now, let's calculate the average number of fruits per person. To do this, we divide the total fruit quantity by the number of people:

Average fruit quantity per person = Total fruit quantity / Number of people
= 170 + 260 = 430 fruits / 2 people
= 215 fruits per person

So, the average number of fruits per person is 215."
Response:  We know that Julia took 20 seconds to row 200 feet backward. So she rows at a rate of 10 feet per second (200 feet / 20 seconds = 10 feet/second). Now we need to find out how much water was in the boat when she reached the shore. We are given that the boat took in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it traveled forward (2 liters x 10 feet = 20 liters). Since Julia rowed backward for 200 feet, the boat took in 2 x 200 = 400 liters of water. Therefore, there were 400 liters of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore.
"Response:  We have four teachers who each use the blackboard for two hours a day. If the board is used three times during each hour, how many times will the board be used in one day?

To find out, we need to multiply the number of teachers by the number of hours they teach and then multiply that result by the number of times the board is used per hour. So, let's do that:

4 teachers x 2 hours/teacher = 8 hours (total teaching time)
8 hours x 3 uses/hour = 24 uses (total uses per day)

Therefore, the blackboard will be used 24 times in one day."
"Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers in his garden and after 15 days, 5 of them have bloomed, then we can calculate how many flowers he has in total.

Let X be the number of flowers that Ryan planted initially (X = 2).

After 15 days, 5 of the flowers have bloomed, so the number of bloomed flowers is 5.

So, the total number of flowers that Ryan has now is X + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7."
"Response:  We know that Jamal has 1800 photos in his phone and each photo takes up 50 times more space than a pigeon can hold in its beak. So if we want to calculate how many pigeons are needed to carry all of Jamal's photos, we need to first find out how much space all of the photos take up. To do this, we multiply the number of photos (1800) by the amount of space each photo takes up (50 times more than a pigeon can hold). This gives us:

1800 x 50 = 90,000

So all of Jamal's photos take up 90,000 units of space. Now we can divide this number by the amount of space a pigeon can hold in its beak (which is 1 unit) to find out how many pigeons are needed to carry all of Jamal's photos:

90,000 / 1 = 90,000 pigeons

Therefore, it would take 90,000 pigeons to carry all of Jamal's photos in their beaks."
"Response:  We know that Sasha spent $16 for each of the five packs of boards she bought, so the total cost is:

$16 x 5 = $80

Now, we know that after some time (months), the price of the same packs of boards increased by 50%. So, if the original price was $80, the new price would be:

$80 x 1.5 = $120

Sasha has ten packs of boards left, and each pack costs $120 now. So, the total amount of money she will get from selling all her boards is:

$120 x 10 = $1,200

Therefore, Sasha will make a profit of $1,200 - $80 = $1,120."
"Response:  We know that Katy used 120 tea spoons of sugar and 1 cup of water in her recipe. If we convert the amount of sugar to grams, we get: 
120 tea spoons x 5 g/tea spoon = 600 g sugar
Now, let's calculate how many cups of sugar Katy used: 
600 g / 200 g/cup = 3 cups of sugar
So, Katy used 3 cups of sugar in her recipe."
"Response:  We know that John bought two pairs of shoes for his three children at $60 per pair. So he spent:
2 x $60 = $120
on two pairs of shoes."
"Response:  We know that there were initially two containers with 5 cars each in the port of Seaside. This means that the total number of cars was 2 x 5 = 10. On the next day, more containers arrived, and the total number of cars became 30. So we need to find out how many containers arrived on the second day.

Let's assume that x containers arrived on the second day, since we don't know the exact number. Since each container has 5 cars, the total number of cars added to the existing ones would be x x 5 = 5x.

Now we can set up an equation based on the information given:

5x + 10 = 30... (1)

Solving for x, we get:

5x = 30 - 10
5x = 20
x = 20 / 5
x = 4

So four containers arrived on the second day."
"Response:  We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years ago, and Lila's salary increased by 30% over the same period. So we can start by finding out how much each of them earned four years ago.

For Adrien, we know that his salary was 40% higher than Lila's salary four years ago, so we can set up an equation based on that information:

Adrien's salary (four years ago) = Lila's salary (four years ago) x 1.4

We also know that Lila's salary four years ago was 30% lower than her current salary, so we can write another equation based on that information:

Lila's salary (four years ago) = Lila's current salary x 0.7

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use these equations to find out how much Adrien and Lila earned four years ago?"
Response:  Miguel has two sheets of paper for his drawing, and there are 30 pages in the notebook. If he uses one sheet per month, then he will use 2/30 = 1/15 of the notebook each month.
"Response:  We know that Marysetu brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought more apples but fewer oranges. So we can start by listing what they brought:

Marysetu:

* Apples: 5
* Oranges: 8

Kael:

* Apples: x (more than 5)
* Oranges: y (fewer than 8)

Now, let's find out how many fruits in total they have between them. We can add the number of apples and oranges for each of them:

Total fruit for Marysetu: 5 + 8 = 13

Total fruit for Kael: x + y =?

Since Kael has more apples than Marysetu, we know that x > 5. And since Kael has fewer oranges than Marysetu, we know that y < 8.

So, the total fruit for Kael is:

x + y = 6 + 2 = 8

Now we have the total number of fruits for both of them:

Marysetu: 13
Kael: 8

Therefore, the sum of their fruits is 13 + 8 = 21."
"Response:  We know that Sasha slept for 8 hours on the first two days and then slept for less than 8 hours on the next two days. So we can start by finding out how much she slept each day:
Day 1: 8 hours
Day 2: x hours (less than 8)
Day 3: y hours (more than 8)
Day 4: z hours

We also know that Sasha slept for a total of 8 hours over the four days. So we can set up an equation to represent this:
8 = x + y + z

Now we need to find out what values will make this equation true. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution first. Solving for x, we get:
x = 8 - y - z

Substituting this into the original equation, we get:
8 = (8 - y - z) + y + z

Simplifying, we get:
8 = 0

This means that Sasha slept for exactly 8 hours each day!"
"Response:  We know that Rosa can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for three hours, which is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. After this period, she has covered a distance of 8 kilometers. Now we need to find out how many kilometers she can cover in 7 hours.

To do this, we divide the total distance traveled (8 km) by the time taken (7 hours):

8 km / 7 h =?

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from hours to minutes as follows:

7 h x 60 min/h = 420 min

Now we can calculate the distance traveled in 7 hours:

8 km / 420 min =?

The result is approximately 19 km. Therefore, Rosa can travel approximately 19 kilometers in 7 hours."
Response:  We know that Dzeni had 60 sheets of paper and she stamped 30 of them. So, we can start with the number of sheets of paper that were not stamped yet - 60 - 30 = 30. Now, let's count how many stamps Dzeni needed to put on each sheet of paper. Since there were 5 stamps in total, and 30 sheets were stamped, we can divide 30 by 5 to get the average number of stamps per sheet - 30 / 5 = 6. Therefore, Dzeni needed to put 6 stamps on each unstamped sheet of paper.
"Response:  We know that Julia bought a new package of skis and her husband also gave her some new ones. So, in total, she has 5 + x skis, where x is the number of skis in the package she bought. We are told that she used three skis to prepare dinner, so she has 5 + x - 3 skis left. Finally, we know that she had 12 skis in her storage room, so we can set up the equation:

5 + x - 3 = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, there were 9 skis in the package that Julia bought."
Response:  We know that Dzylan bought 38 pork sausages and 6 more beef sausages than pork sausages. So, if x is the number of pork sausages he bought, then he bought 6 + x beef sausages. In total, Dzylan bought 38 + (6 + x) = 38 + 6x sausages. To find out how many sausages Dzylan bought in total, we need to solve for x. Can you do it?
"Response:  We know that Emily had 20 more sweets than Lily after they both went to school. So if Lily had x sweets, Emily would have had x + 20 sweets. Now we are told that Lily has 50 sweets. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 20) = 50

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 20 = 50

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

2x = 30

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 15

So Lily had 15 sweets and Emily had 15 + 20 = 35 sweets."
"Response:  We know that one apple costs $15, and we need to buy 4 apples. So, the total cost of apples will be:

4 x $15 = $60

Now, let's calculate the cost of peppers. We know that one pepper costs $3 more than an apple, so the cost of one pepper is:

$15 + $3 = $18

We need to buy 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers will be:

20 x $18 = $360

Finally, we need to add the cost of oranges. We know that one orange costs $5 less than a pepper, so the cost of one orange is:

$18 - $5 = $13

We need to buy 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges will be:

10 x $13 = $130

Therefore, the total cost of all fruits will be:

$60 + $360 + $130 = $650

So, if each pepper costs $15, then the total cost of 20 peppers will be $360, not $540 as mentioned in the question."
"Response:  We know that there are 500 patients per day and each patient spends an average of 24 hours in the hospital. The doctors receive $150 per hour, and the hospital receives $200 per patient per day. To calculate the profit of the balneological health resort from these visits, we need to subtract the cost of doctor services from the total revenue received from patients.

Total revenue = Number of patients x Average stay x Doctor fee per hour x Hospital fee per patient per day
= 500 x 24 x $150 x $200
= $360,000 per day

Profit = Total revenue - Cost of doctor services
= $360,000 - $150 x 500 (doctor fees)
= $360,000 - $75,000
= $285,000 per day

Therefore, the balneological health resort earns $285,000 per day from these visits."
Response:  We have 60 seasonal workers and 3/4 of them are elves who come after Christmas. That means we have 60 x 3/4 = 45 elves. Now, 10 of these elves are statuesque (i.e., they don't move) and remain in place after the children leave. So, the number of elves left is 45 - 10 = 35.
"Response:  We know that Joseph had expenses of $60 less in February than in January. So if his expenses in January were x, then his expenses in February were x - $60. 
We also know that his total expenses for both months were $500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + (x - $60) = $500
Simplifying the equation:
2x - $60 = $500
Adding $60 to both sides:
2x = $560
Dividing both sides by 2:
x = $280
So Joseph's expenses in January were $280."
"Response:  We know that Pam and Fred went to the carnival together. Pam rode the mountain gondolas twice, while Fred rode them four times. After that, each of them took two rides on sleds. If we assume that each ride cost $6, how much did they spend in total for all their activities at the carnival?

Let X be the number of rides Pam took on the gondolas. Since she rode it twice, X = 2.

Let Y be the number of rides Fred took on the gondolas. Since he rode it four times, Y = 4.

Now, let Z be the number of rides they took on the sleds. Since they both took two rides, Z = 2.

So, the total number of rides they took is:
X + Y + Z = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8

Since each ride costs $6, the total amount they spent is:
8 x $6 = $48

Therefore, the answer is $48."
Response:  We know that Walmart sells 4 million items per year, and Amazon sells 6 times more items than Walmart. So, Amazon sells 6 x 4 = 24 million items per year. Now we are given that from Sunday to Thursday (5 days), Amazon delivers 41 miles worth of items. Therefore, the daily delivery distance is 41 / 5 = 8.2 miles per day. Finally, we can calculate the total mileage for each day as follows: Daily Mileage = Total Items Sold x Distance Per Item. Substituting the values, we get: Daily Mileage = 24,000,000 x 8.2 = 193,400 miles per day.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 cars and each car costs $15 per day. So, if we multiply $15 by 30 days in a month, we get:

$15 x 30 = $450

So, the total cost of renting all 4 cars for one month is $450."
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 fewer vacation days than Bobi, and Bobi has 3 more vacation days than Brian. So we can start with the information that Brian has 20 - 3 = 17 vacation days. Now let's see how many vacation days Bobi has. Since Bobi has 3 more vacation days than Brian, Bobi has 17 + 3 = 20 vacation days.
"Response:  We know that there are 27 adnaroogs in total and 1/3 of them are located in Scottish Highlands. Since we are looking for the number of male Scottish Highland adnaroogs, we can use the information that 2/3 of all adnaroogs are males. So, if 1/3 of the total adnaroogs are in Scottish Highlands, then the number of male Scottish Highland adnaroogs is:

(2/3) x (1/3) = (2/9) x (1/3) = 2/9

Therefore, there are 2/9 or 22 male Scottish Highland adnaroogs."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the order without delivery:

2 packets of chips x $1.50 = $3.00
2 pies x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost = $5.00

Now let's add the delivery fee:

Delivery fee (20% of $5.00) = $1.00

So the total cost with delivery is:

Total cost = $5.00 + $1.00 = $6.00"
"Response: 

Yesterday Mark took a test that consisted of 75 questions and finished it in 5 hours with an hour break. Today he gave another test with 100 questions at the same pace. If Mark had 8 hours to finish the first test and 6 hours to finish the second test, how many questions did he complete unfinished?

Let X be the number of questions completed by Mark yesterday. Since he spent 5 hours on the test, he could have completed 75/5 = 15 questions per hour. Therefore, X = 15 \* 5 = 75.

Now let Y be the number of questions completed by Mark today. He spent 6 hours on the test, so he could have completed 100/6 = 16.67 questions per hour (since we cannot have a fraction of a question, round up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, Y = 16 \* 6 = 96.

The difference between the number of questions completed yesterday and today is:

Y - X = 96 - 75 = 21

So Mark completed 21 more questions today than he did yesterday."
Response:  We know that there are 22 yellow jewels in the cuckoo clock, which is four times more than the number of blue ones. If we have 12 blue glass spheres, then the number of yellow jewels will be four times as many. So, if we multiply 12 by 4, we get... (do you want to try solving it yourself or would you like me to give you the answer?)
"Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for rent, and we have to find out how many of them are automatic. So, if we divide 20 by 12 (the number of automatic cars), we get:

20 / 12 = 1 remainder 8

So, there are 12 automatic cars and 8 manual cars. Therefore, the number of automatic cars is 12."
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees as drones. So, if we have x drones, then we have 2x worker bees. Since each drone is accompanied by two worker bees, we can say that for every drone, there are 3 bees in total (2 workers + 1 drone). Now, let's use this information to find out how many worker bees there are in total. We know that there are 700 bees in total, so if we divide 700 by 3, we get approximately 233 worker bees. Therefore, there are 233 worker bees in total.
"Response:  We know that Jordan works for 8 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. If he spends 2 hours in virtual reality every day, then he spends 2 x 60 = 120 minutes in virtual reality. Since there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years for simplicity), we can calculate how much time Jordan spends in virtual reality over the course of a year: 

120 minutes/day x 365 days/year = 43,800 minutes/year

Now, let's convert this to hours: 

43,800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 730 hours/year

So, if Jordan spent all his free time playing video games instead of working, he would spend approximately 730 hours per year doing so. To calculate how much money he could have earned if he had worked instead, we need to multiply the number of hours he spent gaming by his hourly wage: 

730 hours x $10/hour = $7,300

Therefore, if Jordan had worked instead of gaming, he could have earned an additional $7,300 over the course of a year."
"Response:  We have 10 items in total, and each item has a price that is given in the problem statement. The prices are as follows:

* Malakoff (2 dollars)
* Eggs (3 dollars)
* Lamp shades (3 dollars)
* Cubes (3 dollars)
* Paste for tarantulas (4 dollars)

We need to find out how much everything will cost with a 10% discount. To do this, we can calculate the discount first.

Discount = 10% of the original price
= 0.1 x original price

Now, let's apply the discount to each item:

Malakoff:
Original price = 2 dollars
Discounted price = 2 x 0.9 = 1.8 dollars

Eggs:
Original price = 3 dollars
Discounted price = 3 x 0.9 = 2.7 dollars

Lamp shades:
Original price = 3 dollars
Discounted price = 3 x 0.9 = 2.7 dollars

Cubes:
Original price = 3 dollars
Discounted price = 3 x 0.9 = 2.7 dollars

Paste for tarantulas:
Original price = 4 dollars
Discounted price = 4 x 0.9 = 3.6 dollars

So, after applying the 10% discount, the total cost of all 10 items would be:

Total cost = 1.8 + 2.7 + 2.7 + 2.7 + 3.6 = 12.5 dollars

Therefore, the answer is 12.5 dollars."
"Response:  We know that Lucas has three regular clients who buy two bottles of belly fat each month at $2 per bottle and packaging materials worth $5 per package. In addition to these regular clients, he also negotiates with five potential customers who may purchase his products. Each potential customer needs two bottles of belly fat and packaging materials worth $5 per package.

To calculate Lucas's total revenue from his regular clients, we need to multiply the number of bottles of belly fat they buy by the price of one bottle:

2 bottles x $2 per bottle = $4 per client x 3 clients = $12 per month

Now let's add the revenue from the potential customers. If all five potential customers become regular clients and buy two bottles of belly fat each month, their combined revenue would be:

2 bottles x $2 per bottle = $4 per customer x 5 customers = $20 per month

So, Lucas's total monthly revenue from both regular and potential customers would be:

$12 (from regular clients) + $20 (from potential customers) = $32 per month

Lucas's annual revenue would be:

$32 per month x 12 months = $384 per year

His agency profit, which is the difference between his revenue and expenses, can be calculated as follows:

Again, based on the information provided, we know that Lucas spends $5 per package on packaging materials for his products. Therefore, his agency profit would be:

$384 per year - $60 per year (packaging materials cost) = $324 per year

Therefore, Lucas's annual agency profit would be $324."
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare can plant 100 pineapples. So, in total, John can plant 10 x 100 = 1000 pineapples per hectare. Since he has 10 hectares, he can plant 1000 x 10 = 10,000 pineapples in total. Now, we need to calculate how many pineapples John can harvest in one year. Since he can harvest every three months, he will have four harvests in a year (one harvest every three months). Therefore, John can harvest 10,000 / 4 = 2500 pineapples per year.
"Response:  Johnny has collected 500 Lego blocks and an additional one that contains more than three times as many blocks as the 500-block box, and another one that contains one-quarter of the number of blocks. To find out how many blocks Johnny can collect in total, we need to calculate the number of blocks in each additional box and then add them up.

Let x be the number of blocks in the first additional box (more than three times as many blocks as the 500-block box). Then, the number of blocks in the second additional box is 1/4 of x.

We know that the total number of blocks in all three boxes is 500 + x + (1/4)x =?

Can you solve for x and find the total number of blocks Johnny can collect?"
"Response:  We know that 30 bees left for work in the morning and returned to the hive after 6 hours (i.e., at noon). Then, we also know that another group of bees went out for work after lunch (at 2 pm) and returned to the hive after 6 more hours (i.e., at 8 pm). So, in total, there were two groups of bees who worked during the day. The first group consisted of 30 bees, and they worked from 9 am to 3 pm (6 hours). The second group consisted of an unknown number of bees, but we know that they worked from 2 pm to 8 pm (6 hours). To find out how many bees returned to the hive in the evening, we need to add up the number of bees in both groups. First Group: 30 bees x 6 hours = 180 minutes Second Group: (unknown number of bees) x 6 hours = (unknown number of minutes) Total Number of Minutes: 180 + (unknown number of minutes) To find out the total number of bees who returned to the hive in the evening, we divide the total number of minutes by the time it takes one bee to complete one mission (which is assumed to be 6 minutes per bee): Total Number of Bees = Total Number of Minutes / Time Per Bee Total Number of Bees = (180 + unknown number of minutes) / 6 Total Number of Bees = (180 + unknown number of minutes) / 6 Therefore, the total number of bees who returned to the hive in the evening is equal to the sum of the number of bees in the first group plus the number of bees in the second group. In this case, the number of bees in the first group is known (30), while the number of bees in the second group is unknown. So, we can write an equation based on the information given: 30 + (unknown number of bees) = (180 + unknown number of minutes) / 6 To solve for the unknown number of bees, we can isolate the variable ""x"" (the number of bees in the second group) by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation: "
"Response:  If Brytani and her mother bought two tickets for $12 each (adult) and $10 each (child), then they spent in total:

$12 x 2 = $24 (for adult tickets) + $10 x 2 = $20 (for child tickets)

Total cost = $24 + $20 = $44

If Brytani received $8 as change, then she added:

$8 - $44 = $36 (subtracting $44 from $8 gives us $36)

So, Brytani added $36 to the cashier."
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times more friends on Facebook than Darcy. And James has four times more friends on Facebook than Darcy. So if Darcy has x friends on Facebook, then Charlie has 3x friends and James has 4x friends. Now we need to find out how many friends James has. We can do this by substituting x for Darcy's number of friends in the equation for James's number of friends: 4x = 4(x) = 4(3x) = 12x. Therefore, James has 12x friends on Facebook.
"Response:  We know that Styu lives 5 kilometers away from school and can drive to school at a speed of 440 feet per hour. Cim lives 2 miles away from school and can ride a skateboard with a speed of 90 meters per minute. To find out who will arrive first, we need to convert their speeds into hours.

First, let's convert Styu's speed from feet per hour to hours:

440 ft/h x (1 h / 3600 ft) = 0.125 h

Now, let's convert Cim's speed from meters per minute to hours:

90 m/min x (1 min / 60 s) x (1 h / 3600 s) = 0.01578 h

Now, we can compare their speeds in hours:

0.125 h (Styu) > 0.01578 h (Cim)

Therefore, Styu will arrive before Cim."
Response:  We know that each pine nut costs 25 cents and there were 5 people who came to buy pine nuts on the first day. If three of them bought pine nuts for their three-wheeled vehicles, then we can assume that two people bought pine nuts for their own use. So, in total, 2 x 25 = 50 cents was earned from selling pine nuts on the first day.
Response:  If Carl has 10 packs of pens and each pack contains 6 pens, then he has a total of 10 x 6 = 60 pens. Since each pen costs $0.10, Carl has spent a total of 60 x $0.10 = $6.
"Response:  We know that Dave bought a big pack of bulbs and divided it into four parts before a hungry seagull snatched one part from his hand. Then three crows stole three pieces each from him, and an ant stole two crumbs. Finally, the mice took away the remaining five crumbs. So, how many bulbs were in the package when Dave bought them?

Let x be the number of bulbs in the package. Since Dave divided it into four parts, there are 4x bulbs in total.

The seagull stole one part, so Dave has 3x bulbs left.

Each crow stole three bulbs, so there are 3x - 9 bulbs left.

The ant stole two bulbs, so there are 3x - 9 - 2 = 5x - 11 bulbs left.

Finally, the mice took away five crumbs, so there are 5x - 11 - 5 = 5x - 16 bulbs left.

Now we need to find out what is the value of x (the number of bulbs in the package) that makes the equation true. To do this, we can solve for x:

5x - 16 = 0

Solving for x, we get:

5x = 16 + 16 = 32

So, there were 32 bulbs in the package when Dave bought them."
"Response:  We know that Kim has three 1-hour classes every day (morning, afternoon, and evening), so he spends 3 hours per day on classes. Since there are 5 days in a week, Kim spends 3 x 5 = 15 hours per week on classes.

Now, let's calculate how many hours Kim spends on classes for one semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so Kim spends 15 hours/week x 16 weeks = 240 hours on classes for one semester."
"Response:  We know that Bill makes 300 rolls of butter every day, and each roll is 15 centimeters long (15 x 2 = 30 cm). Also, he makes 120 croissants per day, and each croissant is 18 centimeters long (18 x 2 = 36 cm). Finally, he bakes 60 baguettes daily, and each baguette is 60 centimeters long (60 x 2 = 120 cm). To find out how long all these pastries will be in feet, we need to convert the lengths from centimeters to feet. There are 12 inches in one foot, so:

* 30 cm / 12 in/ft = 2.5 ft (for rolls)
* 36 cm / 12 in/ft = 3 ft (for croissants)
* 120 cm / 12 in/ft = 10 ft (for baguettes)

So, if Bill places all his pastries end to end, they will measure:

2.5 ft + 3 ft + 10 ft = 15.5 ft

Therefore, the total length of all pastries made by Bill daily will be approximately 15.5 feet."
Response:  We have three groups of people who need bananas: grandmothers (100 per month), girls (200 per month), and boys (400 per month). In total, we need to buy 700 bananas per month (100 + 200 + 400 = 700). Since the farmer delivers every two months, we need to buy 3500 bananas (700 x 2 = 3500) for two months.
Response:  We know that Blake ran back and forth 15 times, which means he covered a distance of 2 x 15 = 30 meters. Kelly also ran back and forth, but she did it 34 times, so she covered a distance of 2 x 34 = 68 meters. Since Kelly ran twice as far as Blake, the difference in their distances is 68 - 30 = 38 meters. Therefore, the winner (Kelly) is 38 meters ahead of the loser (Blake).
"Response:  We know that Rafael bought four notebooks at $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on notebooks (4 x $1.5). Then he bought two pens at $4 each, so he spent another $8 on pens (2 x $4). Finally, he bought a frame for $20. So in total, Rafael spent:

$6 + $8 + $20 = $34"
Response:  We know that there are 11 jawbones in the saxophone and 6 of them come out from under the custoya lily (the mouthpiece). That means we have 5 jawbones left inside the instrument. Now, if two of these jawbones fall off the scale (the wall), then we have 3 jawbones left inside the saxophone. So, Fin can see 3 jawbones right now.
Response:  We know that in the pond, the water level is 5 meters deep, and in the aquarium, it was 2 meters deeper than before. So if we subtract 2 from 5, we get 3. Therefore, the depth of the water in the aquarium after the change is 3 meters.
"Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 marshtshiki zoarks (marsh fish), 6 marshtshiki konkos (marsh eels), and 3 cloveners (a type of fish). Loxsin caught fewer marsh fish (5 less than Anakin), fewer marsh eels (3 less than Anakin), and fewer cloveners (2 less than Anakin). To find out how many fish they caught in total, we need to add up the numbers for each species.

For marshtshiki zoarks:
Anakin - 10
Loxsin - 5 (less than Anakin) = 5 + 10 = 15

For marshtshiki konkos:
Anakin - 6
Loxsin - 3 (less than Anakin) = 6 + 3 = 9

For cloveners:
Anakin - 3
Loxsin - 2 (less than Anakin) = 3 + 2 = 5

Therefore, Anakin caught 15 marshtshiki zoarks, 9 marshtshiki konkos, and 5 cloveners, while Loxsin caught 5 marshtshiki zoarks, 3 marshtshiki konkos, and 2 cloveners. In total, they caught 20 + 9 + 5 = 34 fish."
"Response:  We know that the cost of the marble cubes is $20 per month, and it increases by $20 every two months. So, after 36 months, we need to calculate how much it will cost in total.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first two months:

$20 x 2 = $40

Next, let's calculate the cost for the next two months (months 3 and 4):

$40 + ($20 x 2) = $40 + $40 = $80

Now, let's continue this pattern for all 36 months:

$80 + ($20 x 2) = $80 + $80 = $160

$160 + ($20 x 2) = $160 + $160 = $320

... and so on.

After 36 months, the total cost would be:

$320 + ($20 x 2) = $320 + $320 = $640

Therefore, the total cost of the marble cubes with the given conditions over 36 months would be $640."
"Response:  We know that there are five red machines and three figurines in total. The lullaby (figurine) cast three figurines, and one of the red machines cast four dollar bills. So we need to find out how many dollar bills each red machine can cast. Since there are five red machines, let's assign a variable ""x"" to represent the number of dollar bills each red machine can cast. Therefore, x + (5 x) = 12 (since there are 12 dollar bills in total). Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, each red machine can cast four dollar bills. Now we need to find out how much money the lullaby can make. Since it cast three figurines, and each figurine is worth $4, so the lullaby can make $3 x $4 = $12. In summary, the total amount of money made by all the machines is $4 x 5 = $20, and the lullaby makes $12."
Response:  We know that Jackie can work for 3 hours less and earn $35 per hour in profit. The accountant earns $90 per hour. So if Jackie works for 3 hours less, she will earn $35 \* 3 = $105 in profit. But then she has to pay the accountant $90 per hour for 3 hours, so her total cost would be $90 \* 3 = $270. Therefore, Jackie would have $105 - $270 = -$165 left after working for 3 hours less.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Elvira spent on all accessories except for the computer itself. We know that she bought a scanner for €157, a printer for €102, and a picap for €74. So, in total, she spent:

€157 + €102 + €74 = €333

Now, let's subtract this amount from her budget of €1500:

€1500 - €333 = €1167

Therefore, Elvira will have €1167 left after buying all the accessories."
Response:  We know that Sandra needs 3 eggs to make Spanish flamingos and she gets 9 eggs every time she goes to her neighbor's house. So, if Sandra wants to make 15 Spanish flamingos for school, she will need to go to her neighbor's house 5 times (15 / 3 = 5).
"Response:  We know that Brook has two children, and their ages are not equal. One child is twice as old as the other child. So we can write an equation based on this information:

Let X be the age of the younger child (in years)
Let Y be the age of the older child (in years)
Since one child is twice as old as the other, we know that:
Y = 2X
We also know that the sum of their ages is 28 years:
X + Y = 28...(1)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for X and Y?"
Response:  We know that Ethel has twice as much money as Djymi. So if Ethel has 8 dollars, then Djymi has 8 x 2 = 16 dollars.
"Response:  We know that Pancho travels 30 kilometers per day and 10 miles in an hour (since there are 1.60934 kilometers in a mile). So, to find out how many kilometers he travels in a year, we need to multiply his daily distance by the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year (accounting for leap years), so:

30 km/day x 365 days/year = 10,950 km/year

Therefore, Pancho travels 10,950 kilometers in a year."
"Response:  We know that each musketeer has three items - cap, coat, and breeches. The cost of each item is as follows:

* Cap: 25 dollars
* Coat: 3 times more than the cap = 3 x 25 = 75 dollars
* Breeches: same price as the coat = 75 dollars

So, the total cost of one musketeer is:

25 + 75 + 75 = 175 dollars

Therefore, the cost of each musketeer is 175 dollars."
Response:  We know that Jayce has 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so he has 80 x 8 = 640 legs in total. Additionally, he has 90 caterpillars with 6 legs each, so he has 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the caterpillars as well. Finally, there are 3 mutant besshrewdniks with 10 legs each, giving us 3 x 10 = 30 additional legs. In total, Jayce has 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.
"Response:  We know that Sally is 32 years old and has been working for her grandmother (Chyrvonoy) for four years. This means that Sally was born when Chyrvonoy was 60 years old (since she is now 80). So, we can calculate Sally's age as follows:

Sally's age = Chyrvonoy's age at the time of Sally's birth - Sally's current age
= 60 - 32
= 28

Therefore, Sally is 28 years old."
"Response:  We know that Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum for each month. So we can start with the minimum amounts and calculate how much she will pay if she pays 50% more than the minimum.

Minimum amount for monthly tuition: $300
Minimum amount for credit card debt: $200
Minimum amount for other expenses: $500

If Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum, her total monthly payment would be:

$300 x 1.5 = $450 (for tuition)
$200 x 1.5 = $300 (for credit card debt)
$500 x 1.5 = $750 (for other expenses)

Total monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1,500

Now let's calculate how much Jessica will pay in one year:

12 months x $1,500 = $18,000

So, if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum for each month, she will pay a total of $18,000 in one year."
"Response:  We need to boil 60 eggs for a big family gathering barbecue. The egg has an appropriate size for afarbation and knitting, so we need an appropriate amount of time for each egg. White takes appropriate power hours to catch the egg, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How many hours will Bill need to finish the podryhtok of the eggs?

Let X be the number of eggs that Bill can do in one hour. Since he needs 5 seconds to cut each egg, he can do 120 eggs per hour (5 seconds x 24 eggs = 120 eggs).

Since there are 60 eggs in total, Bill will need 60/120 = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes to finish the podryhtok of all the eggs."
"Response:  We know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell citrus juice in glass bottles. For each gallon of citrus juice, they receive $3 per dollar, and for each pound of sugar, they receive $2 per dollar. They sell each bottle for 50 cents and get 20 bottles for every gallon. If they have a profit of $25, how many bottles do they need to sell?

Let X be the number of bottles sold. Since each bottle costs 50 cents, the total revenue from selling X bottles is:

50 cents x X = $50

Since they receive $3 per gallon for each gallon of citrus juice sold, the total revenue from selling Y gallons of citrus juice (where Y = X/20, since they get 20 bottles for every gallon) is:

3 dollars x Y = 3 dollars x (X/20) = $60

Their total revenue from both citrus juice and sugar is:

$50 + $60 = $110

If their profit is $25, then their total revenue must be:

$110 - $25 = $85

So, they need to sell:

X = 85 / 0.50 = 170 bottles

Therefore, Juan and his brother Carlos need to sell 170 bottles to make a profit of $25."
"Response:  We know that there were 240 Asians in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. That means there were 160 non-Japanese Asians (240 - 80 = 160). Among these non-Japanese Asians, there were 60 Chinese people. So, if we divide 160 by 60, we get:

160 / 60 = 2

Therefore, there were 2 dancers for every 60 Chinese people."
Response:  We know that Zayid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on food and other necessities, and he has to pay $200 for utilities and $700 for groceries and other household expenses. So, we can start by calculating how much he spends on these items each month: Rent: 1/4 x $6000 = $1500 Food and other necessities: 1/3 x $6000 = $2000 Utilities: $200 Groceries and other household expenses: $700 Total monthly expenses: $1500 + $2000 + $200 + $700 = $4400 Now, let's subtract his total monthly expenses from his salary to find out how much he has left after all these expenses and savings: $6000 - $4400 = $1600 So, Zayid has $1600 left after all his expenses and savings.
Response:  We know that Monica has 4 fewer steps than Rani, so if Rani has 10 steps, Monica will have 10 - 4 = 6 steps. Now we need to find out how many times Bo can walk around Monica in one lap. Since Bo has 40 steps and Monica has 6 steps, Bo can walk around Monica 40 / 6 = 6.7 times (round up to the nearest whole number). So, the aggregate distance traveled by both Rani and Monica together is 6 x 6.7 = 39.2 meters.
"Response:  We know that Lloyd earned $10 per hour and worked for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. So, he worked a total of 5 + 8 = 13 hours. Therefore, his total earnings for the two weeks are:

13 hours x $10/hour = $130"
"Response:  We know that there are 80 students in the class and two candidates are competing for the post of class monitor. If one candidate receives 3/4 of the votes, we can start by finding out how many votes he needs to receive in order to get 3/4 of the total number of votes. To do this, we divide the total number of votes by 4:

80 / 4 = 20

So, the candidate needs to receive at least 20 votes to get 3/4 of the total number of votes. Now, let's find out how many votes the other candidate received if the first candidate received 20 votes. We can do this by subtracting the number of votes received by the first candidate from the total number of votes:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, the other candidate received 60 votes."
"Response:  We know that Sandra ordered 4 times more red roses than white gladioluses (i.e., 4x = 4 \* 100 = 400). She also ordered 200 rose stems, which is 5 times more than the number of white gladioluses (i.e., 5x = 200). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

4x + 5x = 400 + 200

Combine like terms:

9x = 600

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 66

So, Fred needs to deliver 66 x 4 = 264 red roses by 5 pm."
"Response:  We know that Mark is 5 years older than Jance, and Jean is 2 years older than Mark. So we can start with the equation:

Mark's age = Jance's age + 5

Now, we know that Jance is 30 years old, so:

Jance's age = 30

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

Mark's age = 30 + 5

Simplifying, we have:

Mark's age = 35

Since Jean is 2 years older than Mark, we can find her age as follows:

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2

So, substituting Mark's age from the previous equation, we get:

Jean's age = 35 + 2

Simplifying, we have:

Jean's age = 37

Therefore, Jean is 37 years old."
"Response:  We know that each member of the first team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so their total time for the race is:

55 seconds x 4 members = 220 seconds (or 3 minutes and 40 seconds)

Now let's look at the second team. The first runner will run 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means the next runner will have to run 3 seconds faster than the previous one, since they are trying to catch up with the first team. So, the second runner will finish the race in:

60 seconds + 3 seconds = 63 seconds

The third runner will then have to run 3 seconds faster than the previous runner, which gives us:

63 seconds + 3 seconds = 66 seconds

And finally, the fourth runner will finish the race in:

66 seconds + 3 seconds = 69 seconds

So, the total time for the second team to complete the race will be:

69 seconds + 69 seconds + 66 seconds + 63 seconds = 277 seconds (or 4 minutes and 37 seconds)

Therefore, the first team will win the race by approximately 38 seconds (277 - 220 = 57)."
Response:  If Jerry has $100 and spends $60 on two cherry flavored lollipops, then he will have $40 left. But if he had spent only $20 on one cherry flavored lollipop, he would still have $80 left ($100 - $20 = $80). So, the difference between spending $60 and $20 is $40. Therefore, the maximum amount that Jerry can gain by buying two cherry flavored lollipops instead of one is $40.
"Response:  If Jena collected fewer apples than her mother, then she must have collected less than 20 apples. So, we can start by subtracting the number of apples that Jena collected from 20.

20 - x =? (where x is the number of apples that Jena collected)

We know that Jena collected fewer apples than her mother, so we can say that x < 20.

Now, let's solve for x. We can add 20 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the negative sign:

20 + x = 20 + 20

x = 40

So, Jena collected 40 apples."
Response:  We know that there are 10 klets (cages) with hamsters in the adjoining room, and each hamster receives 5 cavals of salami. There are also 3 cages with rats in the main room, and each rat receives 6 cavals of salami. In total, we have 10 x 5 = 50 cavals of salami consumed by hamsters, and 3 x 6 = 18 cavals of salami consumed by rats. Therefore, the total amount of salami consumed is 50 + 18 = 68 cavals. Now, let's calculate how many pigs were needed to produce this amount of salami. We know that 160 cavals of salami were produced, so we can set up the following equation: 160 = 68 + x, where x is the number of pigs needed. Solving for x, we get x = 92, so 92 pigs were needed to produce 160 cavals of salami.
Response:  We know that Mandy has to pay Benedict $100 after 3 months with an interest rate of 2% per month. To calculate how much Mandy needs to pay, we can use the formula for future value of a single amount: FV = PV x (1 + r)^n, where: FV = Future Value PV = Present Value r = Interest Rate n = Number of periods In this case, the present value is $100, the interest rate is 2%, and the number of periods is 3 months or 90 days. So, we can calculate the future value as follows: FV = $100 x (1 + 0.02)^(90) ≈ $104.68 Therefore, Mandy needs to pay Benedict $104.68 after 3 months.
"Response:  We know that Gandlar bought 20 bags of wheat from the farmer for $20 per bag. The transportation cost from the farm to the storage facility is $2 per bag. So, the total cost of transporting all 20 bags would be:

$2 x 20 = $40

We also know that Gandlar sold all 20 bags at $30 per bag, so he made a profit of:

$30 x 20 = $600

Since the profit was $600 and the total cost was $40, we can find out how many bags Gandlar sold by subtracting the cost from the profit:

$600 - $40 = 560

So, Gandlar sold 560 bags of wheat."
"Response:  We have three flowers and two attributes (vases). The total cost of all purchases is $20.25. The cost of one flower is $4.50. Therefore, we can calculate the number of flowers as follows:

$20.25 / $4.50 = 4.5 flowers

Now let's talk about the vases. Each vase costs $33. Since there are two vases, the total cost of the vases will be:

2 x $33 = $66

So, in total, the customer paid $20.25 for four flowers and $66 for two vases, which equals:

$20.25 + $66 = $86.25"
"Response:  John collects persimmons for 3 hours. He can gather 2 persimmons in a minute. So, if we multiply 2 by 180 (since there are 180 minutes in 3 hours), we get:

2 x 180 = 360

So, John can gather 360 persimmons in 3 hours."
Response:  If there are 10 chickens and each chicken needs to eat 3.5 kilograms of feed per day, then together they need to eat 35 kilograms of feed per day (10 x 3.5 kg).
"Response:  We know that Tom has 10 trees per year and each tree yields 2 bushels of fruit per year. He started with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees will have died (perished). So we need to calculate how many trees are left after 10 years.

First, let's calculate how many trees Tom had at the start:
50 trees x 2 bushels/tree/year = 100 bushels/year

Now, let's calculate how many trees will be left after 10 years if 30% of them die:
100 bushels/year x 90% (since 30% will die) = 90 bushels/year

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, he will have:
50 trees x 90 bushels/year = 4500 bushels

So, after 10 years, there will be 4500 bushels of fruit left."
"Response:  On Friday morning, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's lawn. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took away 18 pink flamingos and painted them in blue color, leaving only white flamingos on Sue's lawn. On Sunday morning, there were 18 more pink flamingos on the street than white ones. So, if we subtract the number of white flamingos from the total number of flamingos, we get:

18 (pink) - 18 (white) = 36

So, there were 36 flamingos on the street on Sunday morning, which is more than the number of white flamingos."
"Response:  We know that Viallet needs to buy 5 different colored almonds and she has $20 for this purchase. Each almond costs $2, so we can calculate how many almonds she can buy as follows:

$20 / $2 per almond = 10 almonds

Since Viallet needs 5 different colors, she will be able to buy 10 x 5 = 50 almonds in total."
"Response:  We know that the cost of one alloy rod is $1.20 and the cost of one rubber band is $0.30. To find out how much 8 rods and 8 rubber bands would cost in total, we need to multiply the number of each item by its respective price. So for 8 rods, we multiply $1.20 by 8, which gives us:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60

For 8 rubber bands, we multiply $0.30 by 8, which gives us:

$0.30 x 8 = $2.40

So the total cost of 8 rods and 8 rubber bands would be:

$9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00"
"Response:  We know that there are 200 pounds of morkva (1 pound = 0.45 kilograms) and we need to divide it into 40 restaurants, each receiving 2 pounds of morkva. So, we can start by dividing 200 pounds by 40:

200 lb / 40 =?

Do you want to try solving this problem yourself before I give you the answer?"
"Response:  We know that there are 23,786 people living in Soda, including 8,417 men and 9,092 women. To find out how many children live in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. So, the number of children in Soda is:

23,786 - 8,417 - 9,092 =?

Can you solve this subtraction problem and tell me the result?"
Response:  We know that in the first month, Elena collected 20 cards of Pokémon and in the second month she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. So, in the second month, she collected 20 - 20 = 0 cards. In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as in the first month, so she collected 2 x 20 = 40 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards Elena has now is 20 + 0 + 40 = 60 cards.
"Response:  We know that Mark edits 1000 sentences per month for two different publishers, A and B. Publisher A pays him $5 per sentence, while Publisher B pays him more than Publisher A. So, we can start by calculating how much money Mark earns from each publisher per month:

For Publisher A:
1000 sentences x $5 per sentence = $5,000 per month

For Publisher B:
Since Publisher B pays more than Publisher A, let's assume that they pay $x per sentence, where x is some number greater than 5.
1000 sentences x $x per sentence = $x,000 per month

Now, we need to find out how much Mark earns in total per month. To do this, we add up what he earns from both publishers:

Total earnings per month = $5,000 + $x,000 = $5,000 + x,000

So, Mark earns $5,000 + x,000 per month, where x is some number greater than 5."
"Response:  We know that Baldur drinks 5 glasses of water in the morning and 6 glasses during the day. If each glass contains 0.5 liters of water, then Baldur consumes a total of:

Morning: 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 liters
Daytime: 6 x 0.5 = 3 liters
Total: 2.5 + 3 = 5.5 liters

So, Baldur consumes approximately 5.5 liters of water per day."
"Response:  If John earns $2000 per month and receives a bonus of $5000 once a year, then he earns a total of:

$2000 x 12 = $24,000 per year

If he also receives a 5% increase in his salary, then his total earnings for the year would be:

$24,000 + (5% of $24,000) = $24,000 + $1200 = $25,200 per year

So, if John earned $25,200 in one year and received a bonus of $5000, then he would have earned a total of:

$25,200 + $5000 = $30,200 in that year."
"Response:  We know that Jozi has 10 acres of vineyard and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year. So, in total, Jozi's farm produces 10 x 5 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate how many barrels of wine Jozi's farm produces per year as follows: 

50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year."
Response:  We know that Carl eats 2 slices of cheese every day for breakfast and has 3 days left in the month (June). He uses more calves' milk to make an omelette than he does on sandwiches. So, if he used 1/4 cup of milk for each slice of cheese, how many cups of milk did he use in total? How many slices of cheese did he eat during those 3 days?
"Response:  First, we know that Janet had 22 green and 10 yellow rubber bands. Then she bought 6 packages of blue rubber bands with 9 pieces in each package, and 2 packages of red rubber bands with 6 pieces in each package. So, let's calculate how many rubber bands Janet has now:

Green rubber bands: 22 + (6 x 9) = 22 + 54 = 76
Yellow rubber bands: 10 + (2 x 6) = 10 + 12 = 22
Blue rubber bands: 6 x 9 = 54
Red rubber bands: 2 x 6 = 12
Total number of rubber bands: 76 + 54 + 12 + 12 = 154
Therefore, Janet has 154 rubber bands now."
Response:  We know that Brynli needs to get at least 93 points in total to pass the course with an average score of 93. She has already taken five tests and scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 points respectively. To calculate the minimum number of points she needs to score in the sixth test, we can use the following formula: Minimum Points = Total Points / Number of Tests. Since there are six tests in total, we divide the total points by six: Minimum Points = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 6 = 458 / 6 = 76.33. So, Brynli needs to score at least 76.33 points in the sixth test to pass the course with an average score of 93.
Response:  We know that Michael drove for four days and covered 25 kilometers each day, so he traveled 25 x 4 = 100 kilometers in total during those four days. Then we are told that he drove two times less often after that, which means he drove only twice during the remaining three days. Since he drove 60 kilometers each time, his total distance traveled is 60 x 2 = 120 kilometers. Therefore, the total distance Michael traveled is 100 + 120 = 220 kilometers.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate bars in Joe's package and each bar weighs more than an individual apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, then the total weight of all the chocolate bars is:

25 x 40 = 1000 grams

Now, let's calculate the weight of the apples. Since each apple weighs less than a chocolate bar, we can assume that the weight of one apple is half the weight of one chocolate bar:

1/2 x 40 = 20 grams

So, the total weight of all the apples is:

80 x 20 = 1600 grams

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's package is:

1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams"
Response:  We know that Rosa bought 4 torticakes in the morning and 3 times more than that in the afternoon (3 x 4 = 12). In total, she bought 4 + 12 = 16 torticakes. On Saturday, she bought 5 times more than that (5 x 16 = 80). So, in three days, Rosa bought 16 + 80 = 96 torticakes.
"Response:  We know that the cost of 20 packs of sugar is $1200, and the cost of one taler (a unit of weight) is $6000. So, we can calculate the cost per kilogram of sugar as follows:

$1200 / 20 packs = $60 per pack
$60 per pack x 1 kg (since each pack contains 1 kg of sugar) = $60/kg

Therefore, the cost per kilogram of sugar is $60/kg."
"Response:  
Firstly, we know that Sarah wants to buy a new coat and two pairs of boots. The cost of the coat is $30, and each pair of boots costs $20 for six pairs in total. 
Secondly, we know that Sarah goes to her neighbors four times to ask for money, earning $5 each time. 
Thirdly, her parents pay her $4 each time she cleans the garden. 
Lastly, we are told that when Sarah had already collected $10, she started asking her neighbors for money before buying the coat and boots. 
So, let's calculate how many times Sarah needs to clean the garden to have enough money to buy everything: 
1) Coat: $30 x 4 = $120 (four times because she has to collect $120 before buying the coat) 
2) Boots: $20 x 6 = $120 (six pairs x $20 per pair) 
Total amount needed: $120 + $120 = $240 
Since Sarah gets $4 each time she cleans the garden, she needs to do it: 
$240 / $4 = 60 times 
Therefore, Sarah needs to clean the garden 60 times to have enough money to buy the coat, boots, and other things she wants."
"Response:  We know that there are more than two white chickens in Jerry's flock because he collects 42 eggs per day and each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day. So, if we subtract the number of eggs laid by the red chickens (3 x 2 = 6), we get:

42 - 6 = 36

Therefore, there must be at least 36 white chickens in Jerry's flock. Since there are more than two white chickens, let's round up to the nearest whole number:

36 + 1 = 37

So, there are exactly 37 white chickens in Jerry's flock."
Response:  We know that the distance to be covered is 1.5 km x 6 m = 9 km. The speed of movement is 5 km/h. So we can calculate the time taken as follows: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 9 km / 5 km/h Time = 1.8 hours or 108 minutes
Response:  We know that Sloan had 100 clients on the first day and 50 more than the previous day, so she had 150 clients in total (100 + 50). On the second day, she had 50 more clients than the previous day, so she had 200 clients in total (150 + 50). Therefore, the number of clients Sloan had on the third day is 3 times the number of clients she had on the second day, which is 600 clients (200 x 3).
"Response:  We know that there are two basins and each basin has water in it. The large basin contains four times as much water as the small basin. After four hours, the water level in the large basin decreases more than the water level in the small basin. So we can start with the fact that the water level in the small basin remains constant.

Let x be the initial amount of water in the small basin (in gallons). Since the water level remains constant, the amount of water in the small basin after four hours will also be x gallons.

We know that the large basin contains four times as much water as the small basin, so the initial amount of water in the large basin is 4x gallons. After four hours, the water level in the large basin decreases to less than half of its original amount, so the final amount of water in the large basin is 2(4x) = 8x gallons.

Now we have two equations:

1. x + 0 = x (the water level in the small basin remains constant)
2. 4x - 8x = 0 (the water level in the large basin decreases to less than half of its original amount)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 2 gallons (the initial amount of water in the small basin)

So the initial amount of water in the small basin was 2 gallons, and the initial amount of water in the large basin was 4 times as much, or 8 gallons."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Lor needs to work to earn enough money for her purchase. We know that she wants to buy two pairs of shoes at $320 and an adjustable belt at $32, so let's add up the cost: $320 + $32 = $352. Since Lor earns $8 per hour, she needs to work:  
$352 / $8 = 44 hours  
So, Lor needs to work for 44 hours to earn enough money for her purchase."
"Response:  We know that Jannet lent $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, how much will be the balance of Jannet at that time?

First, let's calculate the total amount paid by Jannet over 12 months:

$165 x 12 = $1980

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the original loan amount:

$2000 - $1980 = $20

So, after 12 months, Jannet will still owe $20."
"Response:  We have 4 jugs of water with different amounts: 3, 5, 7, and 9 buckets each. To find out how many quarts are in the aggregate storage capacity of all four jugs, we need to add up their capacities:

3 + 5 + 7 + 9 =?

Do you know the sum of these numbers?"
"Response:  We know that Adryan is three years older than Garyet, and Garyet is two years younger than Zak. So we can start with the ages of Adryan and Garyet. 
Adryan - 3 years older than Garyet = 24 (current age) + 3 = 27 years old
Garyet - 2 years younger than Zak = 21 (current age) - 2 = 19 years old
Now we have the ages of both Adryan and Garyet. Now let's find out how many years separate them from each other. 
Age difference between Adryan and Garyet = 27 - 19 = 8 years"
"Response:  We know that four students scored a total of 251 points in the exam. Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored more than Naomi by 10 points, and Brian scored more than Naomi by 17 points. So we can start by adding up the scores of all three students:

68 + (10 - 68) + (17 - 68) =?

First, let's calculate Yuri's score:

10 - 68 = -58

So Yuri scored 58 points less than Naomi. Now, let's calculate Brian's score:

17 - 68 = -51

So Brian scored 51 points less than Naomi. Finally, we can add up all three scores:

68 + (-58) + (-51) =?

Adding up the negative numbers gives us:

68 + (-58) + (-51) = 68 + 119 + 119 = 306

Therefore, Djoha scored 306 points."
"Response:  We know that Carmen spent 10 minutes solving the crossword puzzle and 5 minutes solving the word search. So in total, she spent 10 + 5 = 15 minutes doing puzzles. We also know that she spent 3 hours (180 minutes) walking around the garden. Therefore, we can calculate how much time she spent on puzzles as follows:

15 minutes / 180 minutes = 0.083 or 8.3% of her total time in the garden."
"Response:  We know that Selina took 90 liters of water from the reservoir to irrigate her small garden. If she had taken more water than was left in the reservoir, then there would be less water left in the reservoir after she finished using it. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let x represent the number of liters of water left in the reservoir after Selina finished using it.

We know that Selina used 90 liters of water, so we can write an equation:

x - 90 =? (the amount of water left in the reservoir)

Now, we are given that the reservoir initially held 120 liters of water. Therefore, we can write another equation:

120 - x =? (the amount of water used by Selina)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and?). Can you solve for x and find out how much water is left in the reservoir?"
Response:  We know that there are 90 geraniums and 40 petunias less than the number of geraniums. So if we have x geraniums, then there will be x - 90 geraniums left after subtracting all the petunias. Now, let's find out how many petunias there are in total. We know that there are 40 petunias less than the number of geraniums, so the total number of petunias is equal to the number of geraniums minus 40. Therefore, the total number of petunias is x - 40. Now, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows: Total flowers = (x - 90) + (x - 40) = 2x - 130. So, the total number of flowers is twice the number of geraniums minus 130.
"Response:  We know that the campaign spent $15,000 per year on advertising and then increased this amount by some sum (trajectory) over the next year. So we can write an equation to represent the situation:

Year 1: Campaign spends $15,000 on advertising
Year 2: Campaign spends x dollars on advertising (where x is the increase from Year 1)

We want to find out how much the campaign spent on advertising in total for both years. To do this, we need to add up the amounts spent in each year:

Total = $15,000 + x

Since we know that the campaign spent $15,000 in Year 1, we can substitute this value into the equation for Total:

Total = $15,000 + x

Now we need to solve for x, which represents the amount spent in Year 2. To do this, we can subtract $15,000 from both sides of the equation:

x = Total - $15,000

x = $15,000 + x - $15,000

x = 2x - $15,000

Solving for x, we get:

x = $30,000

So the campaign spent $30,000 on advertising in Year 2, for a total of $45,000 over both years ($15,000 in Year 1 plus $30,000 in Year 2)."
"Response:  If Carlas rents a canoe for $30 per hour and Bangers rents a paddleboard for $18 per hour, then their total cost for one hour of rentals will be:

Carlas: $30/hour x 3 hours = $90
Bangers: $18/hour x 5 hours = $90

So both Carlas and Bangers will pay $90 each for one day of rentals."
Response:  If Endru plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester and back, he will need to spend more time traveling by car than by bus. Therefore, we can assume that the number of days spent traveling by car is greater than the number of days spent traveling by bus. Specifically, if Endru spends 6 days traveling by bus and x days traveling by car, then the total number of days he spends traveling is 6 + x. Since he needs to spend less time traveling by car than by bus, we know that x > 6. So, the number of days Endru spends traveling by car is at least 7 (since 6 + 1 = 7). Therefore, the total number of days Endru spends traveling is 6 + 7 = 13 days.
"Response: 

1. James has 30 fire-type cards, 20 grass-type cards, and 40 water-type cards in total.
2. He loses 8 fire-type cards and buys 14 grass-type cards.
3. After losing 8 fire-type cards and buying 14 grass-type cards, James has a total of:

30 - 8 = 22 fire-type cards
20 + 14 = 34 grass-type cards
40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards

So, after the transaction, James has 22 fire-type cards, 34 grass-type cards, and 32 water-type cards."
"Response:  We know that Chad ordered burgers for $6.50 each and paid an additional $3.00 for extra toppings (meat, cheese, avocado, and two sauces). So, the total cost of his meal is:

$6.50 + $3.00 = $9.50

Now, we need to calculate how much change Chad should receive from his $5 dollar bill since he paid with cash. To do this, we subtract the amount he paid ($9.50) from the $5 bill:

$5 - $9.50 = -$4.50

Since Chad cannot receive negative change, he will actually receive $4.50 in change."
"Response:  We know that Kalinda can do 4 cavaliers in an hour and her mother can make 12 sticks of the same length as Kalinda in an hour. So we need to find out how many hours it will take for Kalinda to finish this puzzle.

Let X be the number of hours it takes for Kalinda to finish the puzzle. Since she can do 4 cavaliers per hour, she will have done 4X cavaliers in total. And since her mother can make 12 sticks per hour, she will have made 12X sticks in total.

We are given that the total length of all the sticks is 360 degrees, so we can set up the following equation:

4X + 12X = 360

Simplifying the equation:

16X = 360

Dividing both sides by 16:

X = 22.5

So it will take Kalinda 22.5 hours to finish the puzzle."
"Response: 

* 30% of the small pumpkins were ready for harvest after two months (30% x 120 = 36).
* After two days, 3/4 of the remaining pumpkins were ready for harvest (3/4 x 94 = 73).
* So, there were 73 - 36 = 37 pumpkins that were not yet ready for harvest after two days."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all cars:

12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000 (total cost)

Next, we need to calculate the tax on each car:

12 cars x 10% tax rate = $24,000 (tax amount)

Now, let's add the tax amount to the total cost:

$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000 (final cost)

So, Mark will pay a total of $264,000 for all 12 cars, including the tax and registration fees."
Response:  We know that Kaili collects more snails in the afternoon than Robert does (5 snails vs 20). And we also know that Kaili collects more snails in the morning than Robert does (more than 20). So if Kaili collects x snails in the morning, she will collect at least 20 + x snails in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of snails Kaili collects in the morning is greater than or equal to 20.
"Response:  If there are 50 murashek (ants) in the garden and each ant can carry 1 yablochka (small apple), then together they can collect:

50 x 1 = 50 yablochkas

So, the total amount of apples collected by all ants in the garden is 50 small apples."
Response:  We know that 36 penguins were initially standing on snow. Third of them fell into the sea. If one third of 36 is 12, then 12 penguins fell into the sea. So, there are 36 - 12 = 24 penguins left on the shore. Now, if we assume that each penguin takes up one square meter of space (this is just an assumption to make the calculation easier), and the sun has an area of 1 square meter, then there are 24 penguins x 1 square meter per penguin = 24 square meters of penguins left on the shore. Therefore, there are 24 square meters of penguins left on the shore.
Response:  We know that one vineyard worker can harvest 3 baskets of grapes per day and each basket contains 10 kg of grapes. So, in total, one worker can collect 3 x 10 = 30 kg of grapes per day. Now, we need to calculate how many workers are needed to collect 6 tons of grapes in 6 days. We know that 1 ton is equal to 1000 kg, so we can start by dividing 6 tons by 1000 kg/ton: 6 tons / 1000 kg/ton = 6000 kg / 1000 kg/ton = 6 days. Therefore, we need 6000 kg / 30 kg/worker = 200 workers to collect 6 tons of grapes in 6 days.
"Response:  We know that John wants to order pizza with 20 slices in total and each slice is divided into 4 parts. So, we can start by calculating how many whole pizzas John needs based on this information. To do this, we will divide 20 (the number of slices) by 4 (the number of parts per slice):

20 / 4 = 5

So, John needs 5 whole pizzas. Since each pizza has 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices John needs as follows:

5 x 8 = 40

Therefore, John needs 40 slices of pizza in total."
"Response:  If Ram has 25 empty pens and he can make one full pen by mixing five empty pens, then he needs to mix:

25 pens = 5 x 5 pens (since each pen is filled with 5 empty pens)

So, after mixing all 25 pens, Ram will have:

25 pens x 5 pens/pen = 125 pens

Therefore, Ram will have 125 pens in total, including the new pen made from the mixed ones."
Response:  Johnny invested $20 and got $10 more. So he has $30 in total. If the amount of money doubled every year, then after one year, Johnny will have $60 (2 x $30). After two years, he will have $120 (2 x $60), and so on. Therefore, after n years, Johnny will have $2^n \* $30 = $30 \* 2^n dollars. Since we are asked for the amount of money Johnny had after one year, we can substitute n = 1 and get $2^1 \* $30 = $40 \* $30 = $1200.
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jess. If Jess is 20 years old, then we can calculate the age of each child as follows:

Joan - 20 + 2 = 22 years old
Mary - 20 + 5 = 25 years old
Jess - 20 years old

So, the sum of the ages of the three children is:

22 + 25 + 20 = 67 years old"
"Response:  We know that there were 1000 students in school and they left through three exits A, B, and C. After passing through the corridor, 30% of the students left through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, and the rest (who are not 5/5) left through exit C. So we need to find out how many students left through exit S.

Let X be the number of students who left through exit A. Since 30% of the total number of students is 300, we have:
X = 0.3 \* 1000 = 300

Now let Y be the number of students who left through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students is 3/5 \* (1000 - 300), we have:
Y = 0.6 \* (1000 - 300) = 0.6 \* 700 = 420

Finally, Z is the number of students who left through exit C. Since the rest of the students are not 5/5, we have:
Z = 1000 - X - Y = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 380

So, the number of students who left through exit S is:
Z + Y + X = 380 + 420 + 300 = 1100

Therefore, 1100 students left through exit S."
"Response:  We know that James has 6 cups of sugar more than Robert, and John has more sugar than Robert. So if we subtract the amount of sugar that Robert has from the total amount of sugar that John has, we can find out how much sugar John has.

Robert has 54 cups of sugar, so let's subtract that from the total amount of sugar that John has:

54 - x =?

where x is the number of cups of sugar that John has.

Now, we know that John has more sugar than Robert, so we can say that:

x > 54

We also know that James has 6 cups of sugar more than Robert, so:

James has 54 + 6 = 60 cups of sugar

So, to find out how many cups of sugar John has, we can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:

54 - x = 60

Solving for x, we get:

x = 72

Therefore, John has 72 cups of sugar."
Response:  We know that Dolly reads books at her own pace and Pandora also reads books at her own pace. So, if they both read the same book together but at different times, then we can say that Dolly reads the book once and Pandora reads it once as well. Therefore, the total number of times they read the book is 2 (1 + 1).
"Response: 

1. Mike can write 2 letters per hour (as he writes for 2 hours).
2. Each letter takes 6 minutes to write (since he writes for 6 minutes before taking a break).
3. Therefore, in one hour, Mike can write 2 x 6 = 12 letters.
4. Since there are 5 people working with him, and each person writes 2 letters per hour, too, they together can write 5 x 12 = 60 letters per hour.
5. Now, let's calculate how many pages they can produce in a month (assuming a month has 30 days):

60 letters/hour x 24 hours/day x 30 days/month = 43,200 letters/month

Since each page contains 5 old-style letters, we have:

43,200 letters/month / 5 letters/page = 8,640 pages/month

So, Mike and his team can produce 8,640 pages in a month."
Response:  We know that Jayce has 1000 minutes per month for phone calls, and he spends 15 minutes each day (30 days) talking to his managers. That means he has 1000 - 450 = 550 minutes left for other people. Since he had 300 additional minutes of conversation with others this month, we can calculate how many minutes he spent on those conversations as follows: 300 / 550 = 0.54 (or 54%) of the remaining minutes. Therefore, Jayce has 550 x 0.46 = 259 minutes available for other conversations in the current month.
Response:  We know that Kyle took 5 bulbs from Griffin, and then Colbie took 3 more bulbs from Griffin. So, in total, Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 bulbs left. Now, we need to find out how many bulbs Dionne gave to Griffin. Since Colbie took 3 bulbs from Griffin, and there are less than 20 bulbs left, we can assume that Dionne gave Griffin fewer than 20 bulbs. Let's try 15 bulbs as an example. If Dionne gave Griffin 15 bulbs, then Kyle would have taken 5/15 = 1/3 of the original amount, which is 6 bulbs. Therefore, Dionne gave Griffin 15 - 6 = 9 bulbs.
Response:  We know that in the first aquarium there are 4 slimy creatures (slimes), and in the second aquarium there are 32 slimes. The difference between the number of slimes in the two aquariums is greater than the number of fish in each aquarium. Therefore, we can conclude that the number of fish in each aquarium must be equal. So, if there are x fish in one aquarium, then there will also be x fish in the other aquarium.
"Response:  We know that Maciajorka Jinsa charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours a day (8 hours x 5 days = 40 hours). She needs to make up her face four times a week (4 times x 4 weeks = 16 applications). So, the total cost of makeup services for the entire filming period is:

$250/hour x 6 hours/day x 5 days/week x 16 applications = $32,000

Now, we need to calculate the discount that Jean will receive after the completion of the film. Since she worked for 5 days, and the discount is 10%, we can calculate the discount as follows:

$32,000 x 10% = $3,200

So, Jean will receive a discount of $3,200 from Maciajorka Jinsa's bill. Therefore, the final amount that Jean needs to pay is:

$32,000 - $3,200 = $28,800"
"Response:  We have the following expenses:

* Ingredients for cake - $12
* Decorations for the day of celebration - $43
* Cleaning up - $15
* Requests - $4
* Packages with gifts for guests - $22

Total expenses = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Since there are three sisters, each person paid $96 / 3 = $32."
Response:  We know that the cost of one package of lettuce is $1.50 and the cook bought 4 packages. So, we can calculate the total amount spent as follows: Total = 4 x $1.50 = $6.00.
"Response:  We know that Sue ate 4 times more than her sister in the pancake house and 2 times more than her sister at home. So if her sister ate x pancakes at home, Sue ate 2x pancakes at home. And if her sister ate y pancakes in the pancake house, Sue ate 4y pancakes there. Now we have two equations:

At home:

2x + 4(2x) =... (Sue ate 2 times more than her sister at home)

In the pancake house:

4y + 4(4y) =... (Sue ate 4 times more than her sister in the pancake house)

Now let's solve these equations simultaneously to find out how many pancakes Sue ate in total.

Solving the first equation for x:

2x + 8x =...

10x =...

x =...

Now substituting x into the second equation:

4y + 32y =...

4y + 32y = 40

4y = 36

y =...

Now we can calculate how many calories Sue ate in total:

If her sister ate 5 pancakes and each pancake has 200 calories, then Sue ate 5 \* 4 = 20 pancakes and consumed 20 \* 200 = 4000 calories.

So Sue ate more calories than her sister, with a difference of 4000 - 3600 = 400 calories."
