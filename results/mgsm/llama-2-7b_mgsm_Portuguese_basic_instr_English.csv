Response:  The profit from buying $5,000 worth of jewelry would be higher than buying $8,000 worth of electronics in this scenario. Let's assume that the market price of jewelry increases by 2.5%, and the market price of electronics increases by 1.2%. If the commercial buys $5,000 worth of jewelry, he will make a profit of (5,000 x 2.5%) = $125. On the other hand, if he buys $8,000 worth of electronics, he will make a profit of ($8,000 x 1.2%) = $96. Therefore, the profit from buying $5,000 worth of jewelry is higher than buying $8,000 worth of electronics.

"Response: 30 miles
Explanation:
Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk, so if she runs for x hours, she will travel x^4 miles. If she walks for y hours, she will travel y^2 miles. Since she spends two-thirds of her time running and one-third of her time walking, she will cover a total distance of (2/3)x^4 + (1/3)y^2 = 6x^4 / 7 + 2y^2 / 7.
If she can walk at 5 km/h, then y = 5 \* 3.6 = 18 miles per hour. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:
(2/3)x^4 + (1/3)(18^2) = 6x^4 / 7 + 2(18)^2 / 7
Simplifying and solving for x, we find that Dana can travel 30 miles in six hours."

Explanation:
To find out how many caixas can be carried by the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, we need to calculate the total weight of the truck and its contents after loading the caixas.
The weight of the truck and its contents when empty is 1.400 kg (1.400 x 1 = 1.400).
Each caixa weighs 5 kg, so the total weight of the caixas that can be loaded onto the truck is:
Total weight of caixas = Number of caixas x Weight per caixa = 32 x 5 = 160 kg
Therefore, the maximum number of caixas that can be carried by the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 32."

Explanation:
To find the number of questions left unanswered by Mark, we need to subtract the total number of questions he answered from the total number of questions in both tests.

Total questions in first test = 75
Time taken to complete first test = 8 hours
Number of questions answered by Mark = 75 / 5 = 15
Number of questions left unanswered = Total questions - Number of questions answered = 75 - 15 = 60

Similarly, for the second test:
Total questions in second test = 100
Time taken to complete second test = 6 hours
Number of questions answered by Mark = 100 / 5 = 20
Number of questions left unanswered = Total questions - Number of questions answered = 100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, Mark left 25 questions unanswered in the first test and 80 questions unanswered in the second test."

Since there are 7 houses in total, Lucas's total revenue for the week will be $70 ($10 x 7 houses). After deducting his total costs of $20 (2 x $10), Lucas's profit for the week will be $50 ($70 - $20). Therefore, he will make $50 per week."

Explanation:
The first set of Lego has 500 pieces, and John is catching all of them. Therefore, he has caught 500 + 500 = 1000 pieces of Lego so far.
The second set of Lego has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, which means it has 3 x 1000 = 3000 pieces. Since John is catching all of these too, he now has a total of 1000 + 3000 = 4000 pieces of Lego.
The third set of Lego has 1/4 of the number of pieces as the second set, which means it has 1/4 x 4000 = 1000 pieces. Since John is catching all of these too, he now has a total of 4000 + 1000 = 5000 pieces of Lego."

Explanation:
Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours and then half of them returned in the next 6 hours. This means that 15 bees (half of 30) returned to the hive. Since there were twice as many bees leaving than returning, the total number of bees that left the hive is 2 times 15 = 30. Therefore, the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours is 30 - 15 = 15."

Response: 4
Response: 17 minutes. Explanation: Let's assume that both Steve and Tim start at the same time from their respective homes. Since Steve lives farther away from the school than Tim, it takes him longer to reach the school by bike. Specifically, it takes Steve 440 feet per minute to cover the distance of 5 kilometers (which is equivalent to 3 miles). Therefore, he will take longer to reach the school than Tim, who can cover the distance of 3 kilometers in 264 feet per minute while skating. To calculate the time difference between them, we need to divide the distance between their homes by their respective speeds: Time difference = Distance / Speed = 5 km / 440 ft/min = 11.3 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this works out to 17 minutes) So, if they start at the same time, Steve will arrive at the school 17 minutes after Tim.

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:

* Dave comprou um grande pacote de batatas fritas (initially there were x batatas fritas).
* Dave came and ate 14 of them before a seagull stole the package from his hand (Dave ate x - 14 batatas fritas).
* The seagull ate half of the remaining batatas fritas (the seagull ate x / 2 batatas fritas).
* Three sparrows came and each ate three batatas fritas (three sparrows ate 3(x/2) = 3x/2 batatas fritas).
* A crow stole two-thirds of the remaining batatas fritas (a crow stole 2/3 x = 4x/3 batatas fritas).
* Ants took the last batata frita (ants took x/3 batatas fritas).

So, when the Dave bought the package of French fries, there were x batatas fritas in it. After Dave ate 14 of them, there were x - 14 batatas fritas left. Then, the seagull ate x / 2 batatas fritas, leaving 3x/2 batatas fritas. Next, three sparrows came and each ate 3(x/2) = 3x/2 batatas fritas. Later, a crow stole 2/3 x = 4x/3 batatas fritas, leaving x/3 batatas fritas. Finally, ants took the last batata frita, leaving x/3 batatas fritas. Therefore, the answer is 14."

Explanation:
The Blake ran back and forth 15 times in the field of 100 meters, which means he covered a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters.
Since the Kelly only ran once in the opposite direction, she covered a distance of 100 meters (the length of the field).
Therefore, the total distance covered by the winner (Kelly) is 1500 + 100 = 1600 meters, while the loser (Blake) covered a distance of 1500 - 100 = 1400 meters.
So, the winner won by 200 meters (1600 - 1400 = 200 meters)."

Explanation:  To determine how much money Jackie will save by hiring an accountant, we need to subtract the cost of the accountant's services from the amount she would have earned if she did her taxes herself. The cost of the accountant's services is $90, and the amount Jackie would have earned if she did her taxes herself is $35/hour x 3 hours = $105. Therefore, the difference in value between doing her taxes herself and hiring an accountant is $105 - $90 = $15."

"Response:  $14,687.50
Explanation:  To calculate how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment for each of her debts, we need to first determine what the minimum payment is for each debt per month. The student loans have a minimum payment of $300 per month, the credit card has a minimum payment of $200 per month, and the mortgage has a minimum payment of $500 per month. Then, we multiply each of these amounts by 12 to get the total amount paid per year. Finally, we add up all of these amounts to find the total annual payment. In this case, the total annual payment would be $14,687.50."
"Response: 12 minutes and 30 seconds (12:30)
Explanation: To calculate the time it will take Billy to prepare all 60 batatas, we need to multiply the number of batatas by the time it takes him to descascar and cut each one. Since it takes him approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds (1:30) to descascar a batata, and approximately 5 seconds to cut each one, he will need around 60 x (1:30) = 60 + 5 = 65 minutes to finish preparing all the batatas. Therefore, the answer is 12 minutes and 30 seconds (12:30)."

To see why, consider that there are three numbers less than or equal to 3 on a six-sided die (1, 2, and 3), while there are four numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6, and 7). Therefore, the probability of Jerry landing on a number greater than 3 is 3/8 = 0.75.
"Response: 35

"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, a total of 160 pieces of hay were distributed among all the small rodents. Since there are 3 groups of mice and each group has an equal number of mice (as stated in the problem), we know that the number of mice in each group is also equal. Therefore, if one mouse receives 6 pieces of hay, then the number of mice in each group must be a multiple of 6.
Since there are 10 hamsters and each hamster receives 5 pieces of hay, there are 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of hay for the hamsters. This means that there are 160 - 50 = 110 pieces of hay left over for the other small rodents.
Since there are 20 coelhas in the cage and they receive 20 / 20 = 1 piece of hay each, there are 110 - 20 = 90 pieces of hay left over for the other small rodents after the coelhas have been fed.
Therefore, since there are 4 groups of small rodents in total (mice, hamsters, and two groups of coelhas), the number of small rodents in each group must be a multiple of 4."

"Response: 15
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The commerciant paid $20 per sack for the wheat from the farmer.
* It cost $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the warehouse.
* The merchant made a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks at a price of $30 each.

From these clues, we can set up the following equation:

Total revenue = Number of sacks x Price per sack
= 15 x $30
= $450

Since the merchant made a total profit of $400, we know that the number of sacks sold is equal to the amount of profit divided by the price per sack:

Number of sacks = Total profit / Price per sack
= $400 / $30
= 15

Therefore, the merchant sold 15 sacks of wheat."

"Response: 47

Explanation:
The number of flamingos of plastic rose that were more than those painted white by the neighbors is 47. This can be calculated as follows:

Initially, there were 18 flamingos of plastic rose in front of Sue's house. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one-third of them and repainted them white. Therefore, the number of flamingos of plastic rose left in front of Sue's house was 18 / 3 = 6.
On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 flamingos of plastic rose to the collection. So, the total number of flamingos of plastic rose in front of Sue's house at noon on Sunday was 6 + 18 = 24.
Therefore, the difference between the number of flamingos of plastic rose left after the first weekend (6) and the number of flamingos of plastic rose added during the second weekend (18) is 18 - 6 = 12.
Hence, the number of flamingos of plastic rose that were more than those painted white by the neighbors is 12."

"Response: 20 galons
Explanation:  Let's assume that initially, the small pond had x gallons of water. Since the large pond had twice as much water as the small pond, and it lost 4 gallons per minute, the small pond gained (x - 4) gallons of water in 4 minutes. Now, since the large pond has four times as much water as the small pond, the small pond has (x - 4) / 4 = 5 gallons of water left. So, the small pond now has 20 gallons of water (since 5 gallons is equal to 20 liters)."
"Response: 4 hours
Explanation: To calculate how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford the shoes and belt, we need to subtract her total cost from her hourly wage. Her total cost is $320 + $32 = $352.

"Response: 267
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* After the meeting, 30% of the students left through entrance A, so the number of students who left through entrance A is 30% of 1000 = 300.
* Among the remaining students, 3/5 (or 60%) left through entrance B, so the number of students who left through entrance B is 60% of 800 (the number of students remaining after the first group left) = 480.
* The remaining students (who did not leave through either entrance A or B) left through entrance C. Since there are only two possible combinations - either all students left through entrance C or none of them left through entrance C - we can conclude that the number of students who left through entrance C is equal to 1000 - 300 - 480 = 267."

Response: 480 calories more than her sister. Explanation: On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister, which means she ate 4 \* 4 = 16 times as many calories as her sister. Then, on Tuesday, Sue doubled the number of cookies she ate compared to her sister, so she ate 2 \* 16 = 32 times as many calories as her sister. Therefore, the total difference in calories between Sue and her sister is 16 + 32 = 48 calories per day.
