Explanation:
Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so she can download 200 GB in 100 minutes (200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 min). However, due to the forced restart of Windows, she has to start the download again, which takes 20 minutes (20 min). Therefore, the total time it costs for Carla to download the file is 150 minutes (100 min + 20 min = 150 min)."
"Response: 56 miles
Explanation:
John started his journey three hours ago at a speed of 100 km/h, which is approximately equal to 62 mph. Since he has been stuck in traffic for the first two hours, he has traveled a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 62 mph x 2 hours = 124 miles
Now, he has four hours left to reach home, and he can cover half of that distance in one hour at a speed of 30 mph, so he will travel an additional distance of:
Additional Distance = Half of Total Distance x Remaining Time = 124 miles / 4 hours = 30 miles
Finally, he can cover the remaining distance of 4 hours at a speed of 80 mph, so he will travel an additional distance of:
Additional Distance = Total Distance - Additional Distance = 124 miles - 30 miles = 94 miles
Therefore, after four hours, John is 94 miles away from his destination."

Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, it will take Carlos four years to start making money from his citrus tree. This is because he needs to pay for the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) before he can begin selling the citrons. In year one, he will have no income from the tree since he has not yet started selling any citrons. In year two, he will make $7 (7 x $1.50 = $10.50 - $3 = $7). In year three, he will make $21 ($7 x 3 = $21), and in year four, he will break even and start making a profit of $28 ($21 + $7 = $28). Therefore, it will take him four years to start making money from his citrus tree."

"Response: 108 hours
Explanation:
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 3/5 of them were more than she wrote on Tuesday, so she spent (5 x 3/5) = 7 hours on Monday. She also wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday, so she spent (2 x 3/5) = 6 hours on Wednesday. Therefore, the total time Meredith spent writing articles was 7 + 6 = 13 hours. Since each article takes her 4 hours to write on average, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles was 13 hours / 4 hours per article = 32.5 articles."

Explanation:  To find out how much John has spent on stropdassen, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that he bought two times as many red as blue strapdashes and that the red strapdashes cost 50% more than the blue ones. Let's assume that the number of blue strapdashes is x. Then, the number of red strapdashes is 2x. The total cost of the blue strapdashes is 40x, and the total cost of the red strapdashes is 2(40x) = 80x. Since John gave $200 for the strapdashes, we can set up the equation: 80x = 200. Solving for x gives us x = 160. Therefore, John has spent $160 on strapdashes."

Response: 375 km  Explanation: To find out how many kilometers Sophia can drive on one tank of gasoline, we need to use the information provided in the question. We know that she has driven 160 kilometers since her last fill-up and that her car's tank holds 12 gallons (or 45 liters) of gasoline. Therefore, if she drives 160 kilometers on one full tank of gasoline, then she can drive 45 / 160 = 0.283 tanks worth of distance on one tank. Since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer, we can convert this value to kilometers by multiplying it by 1000: 0.283 x 1000 = 283 kilometers. So, Sophia can drive approximately 283 kilometers on one tank of gasoline.

In four weeks, he will have spent 6 x 4 = 24 hours watching TV. Additionally, he reads for half an hour before going to bed, which means he spends 0.5 x 4 = 2 hours reading per week. Therefore, in total, Jim spends 24 + 2 = 26 hours per week on these activities."

Explanation: According to the question, there were 175 diamonds, which is half of 350 (the total number of stones). Therefore, there must be twice as many smaragdens as diamonds, or 175 x 2 = 350 smaragdens. Additionally, since there are two times as many robijnes as diamonds, and each robijne has 35 less diamonds than it does robijnes, we can calculate that there are 175 / 3 = 58 robijnes. Finally, since there are no other types of gemstones mentioned, all of the remaining 58 stones must be smaragdens, for a total of 200 edelstenen in the chest."

"Response: 320

Explanation:
Let B be the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can contain and J be the number of photos that Jamal's phone can contain. We know from the problem statement that J > 6B. Also, we know that the total number of photos that both phones can contain is equal to 1800 (the maximum number of photos that either phone can contain). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
J + B = 1800
Solving for J, we get:
J = 1800 - B
Now, we are given that Jamal's phone contains 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. So, if Brittany's phone contains B photos, then Jamal's phone contains 6B photos. This means that:
J = 1800 - B
J = 1800 - 6B
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
1800 - 6B = 1800 - B
Simplifying, we get:
4B = 1800 - B
Dividing by 4, we get:
B = 450
So, Brittany's phone can contain at most 450 photos. Now, let's find out how many eenden there are on Jamal's photo of eenden in the zoo. Since Jamal's phone can contain 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, Jamal's phone can contain 6 x 450 = 2700 photos. If Jamal's photo of eenden in the zoo contains 320 eenden, then the number of eenden per photo is:
Number of eenden/photos = Total number of photos / Number of eenden on one photo
= 2700 / 320
= 8.42
Therefore, there are approximately 8.42 eenden on Jamal's photo of eenden in the zoo."

Explanation:
The number of patients seen by the hospital is given as 500 per day. Each patient spends an average of 24 minutes at the hospital, which means that the total time spent at the hospital is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes per day.

Since each doctor charges $150 per hour and there are 24 hours in a day, the total amount earned by the doctors from these visits is 12,000 minutes / 60 (to convert to hours) = $200,000 per day.

Similarly, since each patient pays $200 per hour and there are 8 hours in a day (since they spend 24 minutes at the hospital), the total amount earned by the hospital from these visits is 12,000 minutes / 60 (to convert to hours) = $200,000 per day.

Therefore, the profit made by the hospital with these visits is $200,000 + $200,000 = $400,000 per day."

The statement ""Een derde van hen is in de Schotse Hooglanden"" means that one-third of the remaining 27 rhinoceroses are located in Scotland. Since two-thirds of the Scottish rhinoceroses are female (i.e., two-thirds of 10 = 6), we can conclude that there are 6 female Scottish rhinoceroses. Therefore, the number of female Scottish rhinoceroses is 6."

Explanation:  To find out how many questions Mark left unanswered, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in the second test. In the first test, Mark completed 75/5 = 15 vragen per hour, so it took him 8 hours to complete the test (8 x 15 = 120 vragen). In the second test, he completed 100/6 = 16.67 vragen per hour, so it took him 6 hours to complete the test (6 x 16.67 = 93.4 vragen). Therefore, Mark left 100 - 120 = 20 vragen unanswered in the second test."

Explanation: If Jordan plays video games for two hours every day and earns $10 per hour from his part-time job, he would have worked a total of 14 hours (2 hours/day x 7 days/week) during the week. Therefore, he would have earned $140 ($10/hour x 14 hours) from his part-time job. Since he spends two hours playing video games each day, he could have earned an additional $60 ($2/hour x 2 hours/day) if he had spent that time working instead. So, his total earnings for the week would be $200 ($140 + $60)."

Explanation:  To calculate Lucas's weekly profit, we need to subtract his total costs (the cost of two bottles of cleaning solution and one package of cloths for each of his three customers) from his total income (the combined amount he will receive from all five potential customers). Based on the information provided, Lucas's total income per week is $92, and his total costs are $18 ($2 x 3 customers + $5 x 2 customers = $18). Therefore, his weekly profit is $74 ($92 - $18 = $74)."

Explanation:
The total number of Legos that Johnny has is equal to the sum of the number of pieces in each box. The first box contains 500 pieces, and the second box contains 3 times as many pieces (or 1500 pieces). Therefore, the total number of pieces is 500 + 1500 = 2100 pieces. Since there are 4 boxes in total, we can divide this number by 4 to find out how many pieces are in each box: 2100 / 4 = 525 pieces per box. Finally, since one of the boxes contains only 1/4 of the total number of pieces, it must contain 525 x 4 = 2100 pieces. So, Johnny hauls up 2100 pieces of Lego."

Explanation:
Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive during the first 6 hours of observation. Since she observed them twice as many times as they left, that means there were 60 bees (2 x 30) that left the hive during those 6 hours. Then, half of these bees returned to the hive within the next 6 hours, which is 30 bees (half of 60). So, the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day was 30."

Explanation:
Steve can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute, which means he will cover 3 miles in 17.8 minutes (3 miles / 440 ft/min = 17.8 minutes). Since Tim is two miles away from the school, it will take him longer to reach home than Steve. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, it will take him 29.6 minutes to cover two miles (2 miles / 264 ft/min = 29.6 minutes). Therefore, the winner will wait for 17 minutes and 5 seconds before reaching their house."

Explanation:
Kimo has three lessons of one hour each on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, which means he has 3 x 1 = 3 hours of lessons per week on those days. He also has two lessons of two hours each on Tuesday and Thursday, which means he has 2 x 2 = 4 hours of lessons per week on those days. Therefore, in total, Kimo spends 3 + 4 = 7 hours per week on lessons. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 7 x 16 = 112 hours in a semester on lessons."

Explanation: According to the information provided, it takes Billy 1/2 minute (30 seconds) to shred an apple and 5 seconds to slice it. To determine how long it will take him to prepare all 60 apples, we can multiply the time it takes to shred one apple by 60: 1/2 x 60 = 30 minutes. Therefore, Billy will need 30 minutes to prepare all the apples for his family reunion barbecue."

"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, there were 80 Japanese and 160 Asian participants in total (240 - 80 = 160). Since the number of boys in the Chinese team is given as 60, we can deduce that the number of girls in the Chinese team is equal to the total number of participants minus the number of boys, which is 160 - 60 = 100. Therefore, there are 30 girls in the Chinese team."

Now, since the loser received the remaining votes, we have:
L = 80 - 60 = 20
Therefore, the number of votes that the loser received is 20."

Explanation:
Jerry has thrown an odd numbered die. The probability of him throwing a number greater than 3 is 40%. This can be calculated by considering that there are three numbers less than or equal to 3 (1, 2, and 3), and one number greater than 3 (5). Therefore, the probability of throwing a number greater than 3 is 4/9 = 40%."

Explanation: Based on the information provided, there are three groups of small mammals (hamsters, rats, and rabbits). Each group has an equal number of members, so the total number of small mammals is 3 x 10 = 30. Since each small mammal gets 6 or 5 strokes, respectively, the total number of strokes distributed among all small mammals is 30 x 6 = 180 or 30 x 5 = 150. Therefore, since there are no other sources of food in the store, the remaining 160 strokes must be divided equally among the three groups, resulting in 49 strokes per group. This means that there are four rats in each cage, as there are four times 49 strokes per group, which is equal to 196 strokes."

Response: 46 trees. Explanation: In year 1, Tom has 50 trees. He cuts down 2 trees, so he has 48 trees left. The next year, he adds another tree (since he didn't cut any down), so he has 49 trees. Year 3, he cuts down 2 trees again, leaving him with 47 trees. Year 4, he adds another tree, but then in years 5-10, 30% of his remaining trees die off each year, resulting in 30 trees dying and being removed from the total count. Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 17 trees left (47 - 30 = 17).

Explanation:  Based on the information provided, we can create the following equation:
Let X be the number of PokÃ©mon cards Elaine has at time t (t = 1, 2, or 3).
From the first sentence, we know that Elaine initially had 20 PokÃ©mon cards, so X = 20 at time t = 1.
From the second sentence, we know that Elaine collected three times as much money in the second month as she did in the first month, so her total amount of money at time t = 2 is 3X.
From the third sentence, we know that Elaine collected twice as many PokÃ©mon cards in the third month as she did in the first two months combined, so her total number of PokÃ©mon cards at time t = 3 is 2(3X) = 6X.
Now, let's substitute these values into our original equation and solve for X:
X = 20 + (3(20)) + (2(6X)) = 20 + 60 + 12X = 92X
So, Elaine has a total of 92 PokÃ©mon cards."

Explanation: To calculate the score needed for Brinley to have an average of 93 after six tests, we need to subtract her lowest score from her total score for each test. Let's assume that her lowest score is 86 (as given in the question). Then, we can calculate her average as follows:

Test 1: Score = 89 - 86 = 3
Test 2: Score = 71 - 86 = -15
Test 3: Score = 92 - 86 = 6
Test 4: Score = 100 - 86 = 14
Test 5: Score = 86 - 86 = 0
Test 6: Score =?

To find the score needed for Test 6, we can use the formula:
Score = Total score - Lowest score
= 3 + 6 + 14 + 0 + (-15) + (-86)
= 54
Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 54 on the sixth test to have an average of 93 after six tests."

She earns $5 for each time she babysits and her parents pay her $4 for each time she mows the lawn. To determine how many times she needs to mow the lawn to buy the new jacket and shoes, we can divide the cost of the items by the amount she earns per time she babysits: $30 / $5 = 6 times and $20 / $4 = 5 times. Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn ten times to have enough money to buy the new jacket and shoes."

Explanation:  According to the information provided in the question, both swimming pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so it had 8 gallons more water than the small pool. Now, since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, it must have 16 gallons (4 x 4) more water than the small pool, for a total of 24 gallons (8 + 16) more water. Therefore, the small pool now has 2 gallons less water than it did four minutes ago."
"Response: 41 hours

"Response:  The probability that a randomly chosen card is of Water type after James has lost 8 Water cards and bought 14 Grass cards is:

$$ \frac{40}{74} = 0.551 \approx 0.55 $$

Explanation:

James initially had $30$ Fire-type cards, which accounts for $\frac{30}{74}$ of his total collection. After losing $8$ Water-type cards, he has $22$ Water-type cards out of his remaining $66$ cards, which accounts for $\frac{22}{66}$ of his total collection.

When he buys $14$ additional Grass-type cards, he now has $36$ Grass-type cards out of his total collection of $74$ cards, which accounts for $\frac{36}{74}$ of his total collection.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen card is of Water type after James has lost $8$ Water cards and bought $14$ Grass cards is:

$$ \frac{\frac{40}{74}}{\frac{30}{74}} = \frac{40}{\frac{30}{74}} = \frac{40}{0.55} = 0.55 $$"

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, it takes Kalinda 4 minutes to add one piece to the puzzle and her mother can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. Therefore, if they work together for 1 hour (60 minutes), Kalinda will have added 60 x 4 = 240 pieces to the puzzle, while her mother will have placed 60 x 0.5 = 30 pieces. This means that after 1 hour, they will have completed approximately 270 pieces of the puzzle (240 + 30). To complete the remaining 90 pieces, they will need to work for an additional 8 hours (90 / 10 = 9 pieces per hour). So, in total, they will need 12 hours to complete the puzzle (1 hour + 11 hours)."

Explanation:
Let X be the total number of students who left the building through exit C.
From the given information, we know that 30% of the remaining students (i.e., 70%) left through exits A and B together, so their combined contribution to X is:
X = 3/5 \* 70% = 42
Now, we need to find out how many students left through exit C. Since the total number of students leaving the building is equal to the number of students who left through each exit, we can set up the following equation:
X + (1 - X) \* 1000 = 42
Solving for X, we get:
X = 267
Therefore, 267 students left the building through exit C."
