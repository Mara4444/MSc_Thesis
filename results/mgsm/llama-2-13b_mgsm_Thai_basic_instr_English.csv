To calculate the return on investment (ROI) of buying and renovating the house, we need to know the following information:

1. Purchase price of the house: $80,000
2. Cost of renovation: $50,000
3. Increase in value after renovation: 150%

Using the formula for ROI, we can calculate the return as follows:

ROI = (Gain from investment - Cost of investment) / Cost of investment

In this case, the gain from investment is the increase in value of the house after renovation, which is 150% of the purchase price or $120,000 (150% x $80,000). Subtracting the cost of renovation ($50,000) gives us the net gain:

Net Gain = $120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000

Now we can calculate the ROI using the formula:

ROI = ($70,000 - $80,000) / $80,000

ROI = (-$10,000) / $80,000

ROI = -12.5%

Therefore, based on the given information, the return on investment for buying and renovating the house would be -12.5%. This means that for every dollar invested in the house, the owner would lose 12.5 cents."

The cost of raising one child from birth to age 18 is approximately $231,440. This includes expenses such as food, clothing, shelter, education, healthcare, and other necessities. However, if the parents can save $90 per month starting from the child's birth, they could potentially accumulate enough funds to cover these costs by the time the child turns 18. Specifically, with an average monthly savings of $90 and an assumed annual interest rate of 3%, the total amount saved would be approximately $36,920, which is equivalent to the estimated cost of raising one child from birth to age 18. Therefore, it is possible for the parents to save enough money to cover the costs of raising their child over the long term by consistently setting aside $90 per month starting from the child's birth."

If the father wants to choose the plan that gives him the highest income, he should choose Plan A (the washing machine) because it has a higher interest rate of 2.5%. The total cost of the washing machine is $5,000, and the interest rate per month is $125 ($5,000 x 2.5%). Therefore, the total amount paid over 3 years would be $4,675 ($5,000 + ($125 x 36 months)).

On the other hand, if the father chooses Plan B (the refrigerator), the total cost is $8,000, and the interest rate per month is $160 ($8,000 x 2%). Therefore, the total amount paid over 3 years would be $5,376 ($8,000 + ($160 x 36 months)).

So, by choosing Plan A, the father will save $799 compared to Choice B ($4,675 vs. $5,376)."

If Ms. Smith has worked for the company for 40 years and her annual salary is $50,000 per year starting from Year 20, she will have received a total of:

To calculate the amount of money that the mother will have after paying for her children's expenses, we need to subtract the total cost of their expenses from her monthly income.

Total cost of children's expenses = (2 x $2) + ($5 x 5) = $40 + $25 = $65

Monthly income = $100

Amount left over for mother = Monthly income - Total cost of children's expenses = $100 - $65 = $35

Therefore, the mother will have $35 left over for herself each month after paying for her children's expenses."

To calculate how many pieces of 500-square-centimeter tiles are needed to cover the entire floor area, we need to divide the total floor area by the size of one tile.

Total floor area = 20 square meters x 3 rooms = 60 square meters

Therefore, number of pieces of tiles needed = Total floor area / Size of one tile
= 60 square meters / 500 square centimeters
= 120 pieces of tiles

So, you will need 120 pieces of 500-square-centimeter tiles to cover the entire floor area."

The team that wins this race will be the one who can complete the 400-meter distance in the shortest time possible. Let's assume that each member of Team A and Team B has an average running speed of 20 kilometers per hour.

For Team A:

* The first runner completes 400 meters in 1 minute (60 seconds), which is equivalent to 20 kilometers per hour.
* The second runner takes 2 minutes (120 seconds) to cover the same distance, which means they run at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour.
* The third runner finishes in 3 minutes (180 seconds), which translates to 6.7 kilometers per hour.

Total time for Team A: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 minutes (360 seconds).

For Team B:

* The first runner covers 400 meters in 1.5 minutes (90 seconds), which is equal to 26.67 kilometers per hour.
* The second runner takes 2.5 minutes (150 seconds) to cover the same distance, which means they run at a speed of 12 kilometers per hour.

To calculate the total amount of money that J will pay over 12 months, we need to first calculate the interest rate as a decimal.

Interest Rate (decimal) = 10%/100 = 0.10

Next, we can calculate the monthly payment amount using the formula:

Monthly Payment Amount = Principal x Interest Rate / (1 - (1 + Interest Rate)^(-Number of Payments))

In this case, the principal is $2,000, and the number of payments is 12.

Monthly Payment Amount = $2,000 x 0.10 / (1 - (1 + 0.10)^(-12))
= $2,000 x 0.10 / 0.8333333333333333
= $2,000 x 0.10 / 0.8333333333333333
= $241.67

Therefore, J will pay $241.67 per month for 12 months, totaling $2,900.04 ($2,000 in principal plus $900.04 in interest)."

To find out how many students exit through door C, we need to first calculate the total number of students who exited through doors A and B. Let's assume that 30% of the students exited through each of these doors.

Number of students who exited through door A = 30% of 1,000 = 300
Number of students who exited through door B = 30% of 1,000 = 300

Now, let's subtract the number of students who exited through doors A and B from the total number of students to get the number of students who exited through door C:

Total number of students - (number of students who exited through door A + number of students who exited through door B) = 1,000 - (300 + 300) = 400
