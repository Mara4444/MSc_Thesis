"Response: 80
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
En Toulouse hay el doble de ovejas que en Charleston, which means there are twice as many ovejas in Toulouse as in Charleston.
In Charleston, there are 4 times more ovejas than in Seattle. This means that for every oveja in Seattle, there are 4 ovejas in Charleston.
So, if there are 20 ovejas in Seattle, then there are 80 ovejas (20 x 4) in Charleston.
Since Toulouse has double the number of ovejas as Charleston, there are 80 + 80 = 160 ovejas in Toulouse."
Response: 3 hours and 58 minutes. Explanation: If Carla can download 2 GB per minute, then she has downloaded 80 GB (2 GB x 40%) during the 20-minute period when Windows forced a restart. Therefore, the total amount of data downloaded is 80 GB + 200 GB = 280 GB. Dividing this value by the rate at which Carla can download data (2 GB/minute) gives us the total time required for the download, which is 140 minutes (or 2 hours and 20 minutes).

"Response: 360
Explanation: To calculate how much Eliza earns this week, we need to multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked. For the first 40 hours (up to 40 x $10 = $400), she earned $400. For the remaining 15 hours (at $1.2 times her hourly rate = $18), she earned an additional $270 ($18 x 15). Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $400 + $270 = $670."
"Response: 210 descargas
Explanation:
In the first month, there were 60 downloads, so in the second month, there would be 60 x 3 = 180 downloads (since it's three times more than the previous month). In the third month, there would be 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads (since it reduced by 30%). Therefore, the total number of downloads during the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 210."

"Response: 6 years
Explanation: To calculate how long it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to consider both the initial investment and the annual costs of caring for the tree. The total cost of planting the tree is $90, plus there are annual costs of $3 for regulating and nourishing the tree. Since each year the tree produces 7 lemons that can be sold for $1.5 each, the total revenue per year is $10.5 (7 lemons x $1.5 each). Therefore, it will take 6 years for Carlos to break even on his investment ($90 + $3 \* 6 = $630), at which point he will begin to make a profit every year."

"Response: 40%
Explanation: Let X be the number of students who signed up for dance hip hop. Since 60% of the remaining students (i.e., 80% - 20%) signed up for dance contemporary, and 75% of the rest (i.e., 30% of the remaining students) signed up for dance jazz, we can write:
X + (60/100) \* (80 - 20) = 100
X + (60/100) \* 60 = 100
X = 40
Therefore, 40% of the total number of students signed up for dance hip hop."
Response: 3476. Explanation: To maximize the gain at the end of the month, the merchant should choose the option that has the highest expected value. The expected value of the joyas is $5000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5125 and the expected value of the dispositivos electrónicos is $8000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8160. Therefore, the merchant should choose the option with the higher expected value, which is the dispositivos electrónicos. The gain at the end of the month would be $8160 - $5000 = $3160.

"Response: 18 liters
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that the orange juice contains two-thirds of water and the pineapple juice contains three-quarters of water. So, if we mix equal volumes of both juices, there will be two-thirds + three-quarters = 7/6 = 1.167 liters of water in each liter of the mixed juice. Since we have 24 liters of the mixed juice after adding the orange juice, we can calculate the amount of water as follows:

Water content = Total volume of mixed juice / Volume of one liter of mixed juice
= 24 liters / 1.167 liters per liter
= 20.3 liters
Therefore, there are 20.3 liters of water in the 24 liters of mixed juice."

Explanation: Let's analyze each friend's calculation:
Friend 1 said there are 80 caramels in the frasco.
Friend 2 said there are 20 more than half of Friend 1's count, which is 40 (since half of 80 is 40).
Friend 3 said there are 25% more than Friend 1's count, which is 105 (since 25% more than 80 is 105).
Now, let's find the average of these three calculations:
Average = (80 + 40 + 105) / 3 = 136
Therefore, according to their friends' calculations, there are approximately 136 caramels in the frasco."

"Response: 18 miles
Explanation:
Dana can run four times faster than he can walk, so if he runs for 1/3 of the time and walks for 2/3 of the time, his total distance traveled will be 4 times greater than if he had walked the entire time. Since he can walk at a rate of x miles per hour, and he walks for 2/3 of the time, his total distance traveled while walking is (2/3)x miles = 12 miles. Similarly, since he can run at a rate of 4x miles per hour, and he runs for 1/3 of the time, his total distance traveled while running is (1/3)4x miles = 12 miles. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Dana in six hours is 12 + 12 = 24 miles."

"Response: 450 grams
Explanation: To determine how many grams of potato chips someone can eat if their daily calorie goal is 2000 and they have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to use the information provided in the question. According to the nutritional label, each serving size of potato chips contains 250 calories. Since there are 5 servings per bag (300g), the total number of calories from potato chips in the bag is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. Therefore, if the person has already consumed 1800 calories, they have room for 1250 - 1800 = 450 calories worth of potato chips. This translates to approximately 450 grams based on the density of potato chips."

Explanation: To find out how much John spent on corbatas, we need to add up the cost of the corbatas he bought. Since he bought twice as many red corbatas as blue ones, and each red corbata costs 50% more than each blue one, we can calculate the total cost of the corbatas as follows:

Cost of blue corbatas = $40 x 2 = $80
Cost of red corbatas = $40 x 2 = $80
Total cost of corbatas = $80 + $80 = $160
Therefore, John spent $160 on corbatas."

"Response: 2 hours
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (in this case, the speed), and t is the time. We know that Tom travels for 5 hours in total (from 1 pm to 4 pm), so his distance traveled is:
d = rt = 10 miles/hour x 5 hours = 50 miles
Now, we are asked how long it takes him to return. Since he navigates at a speed of 6 miles per hour, his distance traveled on the return trip is:
d = rt = 6 miles/hour x 2 hours = 12 miles
Therefore, it takes Tom 12 miles / 6 miles per hour = 2 hours to return."
"Response: 60
Explanation: To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we need to subtract the weight of the comics from the total weight of his backpack. The weight of the comics is 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds, so if he takes out 30 comics, he will have taken out 7.5 + 15 = 22.5 pounds. Therefore, he needs to take out 60 toys (22.5 - 15) to reach his goal of removing 15 pounds from his backpack."

Explanation: To calculate how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide his total budget of $42 by the cost of each movie ticket ($7) and the cost of popcorn ($7). This gives us: $42 / ($7 + $7) = 6. Therefore, Peter can go to the movies six times during the week."
"Response: 4296 cajas
Explanation: To find out how many cajas can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, we need to calculate the total weight of the truck and its contents after loading the cajas. The total weight is calculated as follows:
Truck + Cajas = (Conductor + Camion vacío) + (Weight of each caja x Number of cajas)
First, let's calculate the weight of the truck and its contents when it is empty: Truck + Camion vacío = 3755 libras
Next, let's calculate the weight of each caja: Weight of each caja = 15 libras
Now, let's calculate the total weight of the truck and its contents after loading the cajas: Total weight = Truck + Camion vacío + (Weight of each caja x Number of cajas)
Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total weight = 3755 + (15 x 4296) = 4296 libras
Therefore, the maximum number of cajas that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 4296 cajas."

"Response: 180 000$/año
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Marcy has worked for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000 after year 20. Additionally, she is entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year starting from year 20. Therefore, if she retires after 30 years of service, her annual pension would be:

Pension = $50,000 (initial amount) + ($50,000 x 5%) (annual increase)
= $50,000 + $2,500
= $52,500/year
Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service would be $52,500."
"Response: 1680
Explanation: To calculate the total amount that Aleena will have paid for the service by the end of the year, we need to find out how much she was charged in each half-year period and then add those amounts together.
In the first half-year, the company charged her $140 x 6 = $840. In the second half-year, they charged her $140 x 6 - ($140 x 10%) = $720. Therefore, the total amount she will have paid by the end of the year is $840 + $720 = $1680."
"Response: 80 miles
Explanation: To find out how many miles Sophia can travel with one tank of gasoline, we need to divide the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gasoline left in her tank after refueling (4 gallons). This gives us an estimate of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline (100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles/gallon). Since the manual says that the tank holds 12 gallons of gasoline, and Sophia wants to know how far she can go with just one tank, we multiply the number of miles per gallon by the capacity of the tank (12 gallons): 25 miles/gallon x 12 gallons = 300 miles. Therefore, Sophia can travel approximately 80 miles with just one tank of gasoline (300 miles - 100 miles = 80 miles)."

"Response: 15
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Jan has three times more pets than Marcia, which means that if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets.
* Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, which means that if Cindy has x pets, then Marcia has x + 2 pets.
* Cindy has four pets, so Marcia has x + 2 = 4 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets owned by each person to find the total number of pets:

Jan has 3x pets, and Marcia has x + 2 pets, for a total of 3x + x + 2 = 6x pets.
Cindy has 4 pets, so the total number of pets is 6x + 4 = 10 pets.
Therefore, the answer is 10."

Since there were originally 30 cars on the highway, and 20 more cars passed through in the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam, this means that 10 cars (20 - 10 = 10) did not pass through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 15 (10 + 5 = 15)."

"Response: 180 times
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The first friend tocked the bell 20 times before Jerome opened the door. So, the first friend tocked the bell for x = 20 times.
* The second friend tocked the bell x + 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend tocked the bell for x = 20 times, the second friend tocked it for x + 1/4 = 30 times (since 1/4 is equal to 30).
* The third friend tocked the bell 10 times more than the second friend. So, the third friend tocked the bell for x + 10 = 40 times (since x = 30).
* The fourth friend tocked the bell 60 times. So, the total number of times the bell was tocked is x + x + x + x = 180 times (since each friend tocked the bell once)."

Response: 10.5 rollitos.
"Response: 120 liters (or 35 gallons)
Explanation:
The question states that the boat began to take on water while it was in the lake and that two liters of water entered for every ten feet that Julia rowed towards the shore. Since she rowed twenty feet in sixteen seconds, we can calculate how much water entered the boat during that time as follows:

Water entering the boat = Water per foot x Number of feet rowed
= 2 liters/foot x 20 feet
= 40 liters (or 11 gallons)

Since Julia took 64 seconds to reach the shore, we know that the total amount of water that entered the boat during that time is equal to the distance she traveled multiplied by the rate at which water entered the boat:

Total water in the boat = Distance traveled x Rate of water entry
= 64 seconds x 40 liters/second
= 2560 liters (or 700 gallons)

However, since Julia started with an empty boat, there were no water in the boat initially. Therefore, the final amount of water in the boat when she reached the shore is equal to the total water that entered the boat minus the initial volume of the boat:

Final water in the boat = Total water in the boat - Initial volume of the boat
= 2560 liters -?

We are given that the initial volume of the boat is 120 liters (or 35 gallons), so we can plug this value into the equation above to solve for the final volume of water in the boat:

Final water in the boat = 2560 liters - 120 liters
= 2440 liters (or 700 gallons)

Therefore, the final volume of water in the boat when Julia arrived at the shore was 2440 liters (or 700 gallons)."
Response: 12 times per day. Explanation: Each class uses the blackboard once in two days, so there are 2 classes per day.

Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:
Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This means that for every 6 photographs that Brittany's phone can hold, Jamal's phone can hold 6 x 6 = 36 more photographs.
The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in the photography that Jamal took of the ducks in the zoo. If Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photo, then the number of birds in Jamal's photo is 50 / 1 = 50 birds.
Now, we know that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photographs. Therefore, if Jamal took a picture of 50 birds, he must have taken at least 1800 / 50 = 36 pictures of each bird. So there are 36 patos (birds) in the photography that Jamal took of the ducks in the zoo."

Explanation: To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate her speed for each hour and then multiply it by the number of hours she runs. According to the question, Rosie's speed decreases from 10 miles per hour to 5 miles per hour after 3 hours. So, during the first 3 hours, she runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour x 3 hours = 30 miles. During the remaining 4 hours, she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour x 4 hours = 20 miles. Therefore, Rosie can run a total distance of 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours."

Explanation:
To find out how much Dillon will spend on each item, we need to divide the cost of that item by its price per unit. For example, if we want to know how much Dillon will spend on one pimiento, we can divide $15 (the cost of one pimiento) by 3 (the number of pimentos he wants to buy). This gives us $5 per pimiento.
Similarly, if we want to know how much Dillon will spend on one naranja, we can divide $10 (the cost of one naranja) by 10 (the number of naranjas he wants to buy). This gives us $1 per naranja.
Now, let's calculate the total amount Dillon will spend on all the items:
For sandías, Dillon needs to buy 4, so the cost is $3 x 4 = $12.
For pimientos, Dillon needs to buy 20, so the cost is $15 x 20 = $300.
For naranjas, Dillon needs to buy 10, so the cost is $10 x 10 = $100.
Adding up these costs gives us a total of $336. Therefore, the answer is $336."

"Response: 15 minutes
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steve can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute, which means he will cover 3 miles (distance between Steve's house and school) / 440 = 6.8 minutes to reach school. Since Tim lives closer to the school than Steve, it will take him less time to reach school. Therefore, if Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute, he will cover 2 miles (distance between Tim's house and school) / 264 = 7.9 minutes to reach school. Since Steve has already reached school before Tim, Steve will be the winner of the race. To find out how much time Steve will spend at home before Tim finishes the race, we need to subtract the time taken by Tim to reach school from the total time taken by Steve to reach school: 6.8 - 7.9 = 1.1 minutes. So, Steve will be at home for 1.1 minutes before Tim finishes the race."

"Response: 4167
Explanation: To calculate how much Jessica will pay in all her debts each month, we need to find out what percentage of the minimum payment she wants to make for each loan and then multiply it by the minimum payment amount. For example, if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for her student loans, that means she will pay half of the minimum payment plus an additional $150 (since the minimum payment is $300). So, her monthly payment for the student loans would be $450 ($300 + $150). Similarly, for her credit card bill, she will pay half of the minimum payment plus an additional $100 since the minimum payment is $200, so her monthly payment for the credit card bill would be $300 ($200 + $100). And finally, for her mortgage, she will also pay half of the minimum payment plus an additional $250 since the minimum payment is $500, so her monthly payment for the mortgage would be $750 ($500 + $250). Therefore, Jessica's total monthly payment towards all her debts would be $4167 ($450 + $300 + $300 + $750)."

To find out how long it will take Billy to prepare all 60 papas, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Billy takes around one minute and thirty seconds (1:30) to pelare each papa, and only five seconds to cut them. Since he has to prepare 60 papas, we can calculate the total time needed as follows:
Time = Number of papas x Time per papa
= 60 x 1:30
= 90 minutes (or 10:30)
Therefore, Billy will need approximately 10 minutes and 30 seconds (10:30) to finish preparing all 60 papas for his family's big barbecue."

Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the problem:
Given that the commerciant pays $20 per sack to the farmer and makes a profit of $400 after selling all the sacks at $30 each. We can set up an equation based on this information as follows:
Profit = Number of sacks x Price per sack
$400 = (Number of sacks) x ($30)
To find out how many sacks were sold, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the price per sack:
Number of sacks = Profit / Price per sack
Number of sacks = $400 / $30
Number of sacks = 1333/3
Therefore, there were 444 sacks sold."

Let's assume that each time she cuts the grass, she earns $4, and each time she cares for a child, she earns $5. Therefore, if she cuts the grass 4 times and cares for children 4 times, her total earnings will be: $4 x 4 = $16 + $5 x 4 = $20. Since Sara already had $10 saved up, her new total savings will be $10 + $16 + $20 = $46. This means it will take her 6 times of cutting the grass or caring for children to save enough money to buy the jacket and shoes ($46 / $7 = 6)."
"Response: 18
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x gallinas rojas in Jerry's coop. Since all the hens lay eggs equally (i.e., no bias towards any particular breed), we can say that the total number of eggs laid per day is equal to the sum of the number of eggs laid by each breed:

Gallinas rojas = 3x/2 (since they lay 3 eggs/day)
Gallinas blancas = 5(2 + 2) / 2 = 5(4) / 2 = 20
Total eggs laid per day = Gallinas rojas + Gallinas blancas = 3x/2 + 20 = 42
Now, since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white hens than red hens, we can set up the following equation:

Number of red hens = Total eggs collected - Number of whites collected
= 42 - (2 + 2) = 42 - 4 = 38
Therefore, Jerry has 38 red hens in his coop."
"Response: 2 hours
Explanation: If Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour and the park is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles, he will walk for 2 hours to cover the entire park. To calculate this, divide the distance of the park (1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles) by his walking speed (3 miles/hour). This gives you 2 hours as the time it takes him to complete the walk around the park."
"Response: 300
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 100 customers on day one, and then an additional 50 customers on day two for a total of 150 customers. On the third day, there were 50 more customers than on the second day, so there were 200 customers in total on the third day (150 + 50 = 200)."
"Response: 16 gallons
Explanation: Let's assume that the initial volume of water in both piscines is V. Since the large piscine had the same amount of water as the small one initially, their volumes are equal: V = x.
Now, we know that the large piscine has four times the volume of water as the small one, so we can write: V_large = 4x.
We also know that the rate at which the water is escaping from both piscines is 4 gal/minute, so after 4 minutes have passed, the volume of water lost from both piscines is: Volume lost = Rate x Time = 4gal/min x 4min = 16 gal.
Therefore, the remaining volume of water in the small piscine is: x - 16 gal = 0.
So, the small piscine now contains 0 gallons of water."
"Response: 40 hours
Explanation: To determine how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford her shoes and belt, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then divide it by her hourly wage. The total cost is $350 ($320 for the shoes + $30 for the belt), and her hourly wage is $8 per hour. Therefore, Lori needs to work for 40 hours (($350 / $8) = 40) before she can afford her desired purchase."

"Response: 360 liters
Explanation: Initially, there were 120 liters of water in the tank. Then, Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, leaving 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30) in the tank. After that, she collected double the amount of rainwater, which is 2 x 90 = 180 liters. Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 30 + 180 = 360 liters."

Response: 22 500 dollars. Explanation: To find out how much money the company spent on advertising during both years, we need to use the information provided in the problem. The company spent $15,000 on advertising during the first year and then spent one-third of that amount ($15,000 / 3 = $5,000) on advertising during the second year. Therefore, the total amount that the company spent on advertising over the two years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.
"Response: 42
Explanation: To find out how much they will pay in total for the rentals, we need to calculate the cost of each rental and then add them up. For the canoe, the cost is $30 per hour x 3 hours = $90. For the banana-shaped kite, the cost is $18 per hour x 5 hours = $90. Therefore, the total cost for both rentals is $90 + $90 = $180."
"Response: 3 days
Explanation: If it takes half the time to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car as opposed to bus, then it will take twice as long to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car compared to returning from Rochester to New Jersey by bus. Therefore, if it took 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester and back by bus, it would take 12 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester and back by car (6 + 6)."
"Response: 50%
Explanation:
James initially has 40 cards of type water, which means that there is a 50% chance that any card he draws will be of type water. After losing 8 water cards and buying 14 herb cards, his total number of water cards decreases to 32, while his total number of herb cards increases to 54. Therefore, the probability of drawing a water card remains at 50%."

"Response: 2 hours and 15 minutes (165 minutes)
Explanation:
Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so it will take her 360/4 = 90 minutes to add all the pieces. Since her mother can locate half of the pieces in the same time, she will need 90/2 = 45 minutes to find the remaining pieces. Therefore, it will take them 90 + 45 = 165 minutes or 2 hours and 15 minutes to assemble the puzzle."

Mark pays $240 000 for all 12 cars.
Explanation:
Total cost of each car = $20 000 x 12 = $240 000
Impact of taxes and registration fees:
Taxes (10% of $20 000) = $2000 x 12 = $24 000
Registration fee ($1000 x 12) = $12 000
Total cost = Total cost of cars + Taxes + Registration fee = $240 000"

"Response: 270
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The total number of students in the school was 1000.
* After the meeting, 30% of the students left through exit A, which means 300 students (30% of 1000) left through that exit.
* Of the remaining 700 students, 3/5 (or 60%) left through exit B, which means 420 students (60% of 700) left through that exit.
* Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is equal to the number of students who did not leave through exits A and B, i.e., 700 - 300 - 420 = 280 students.
So, the number of students who left through exit C is 280."
"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, James has 6 more caramelos than Robert, which means that James has 6 + 6 = 12 more caramelos than Robert. Since John has twice as many caramelos as Robert, and John has 54 caramelos, we can deduce that John has 2 x 6 = 12 more caramelos than James. Therefore, John has 12 + 12 = 24 more caramelos than James."

"Response: 10 hours
Explanation:
Mike receives 5 letters per week from his 5 friends, and he responds to each letter with one of his own. Since he can write a page in 6 minutes, it takes him 6/minutes = 1 hour to write one letter. Therefore, he spends 5 hours writing letters from his 5 friends.
Since two of his friends stopped being pen-pals, he no longer writes letters to them, so he now has 3 friends who he still writes to. He spends 3 x 5 hours = 15 hours writing letters to these friends.
Therefore, Mike spends a total of 10 hours (15 hours - 5 hours) writing letters per week."
"Response: 700 minutos (or 11 hours and 20 minutes)
Explanation:
Jason has a plan of 1000 minutos per month, which is equivalent to 16 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). He spends 15 minutes every day talking to his boss, so that's 45 minutes per week or 180 minutes per month. Additionally, he has used 300 minutos more than his plan allows for other calls, leaving him with 700 minutos remaining. Therefore, Jason has 700 minutos left without using them this month."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Kyle took away 5 patatas fritas from Griffin, which means that Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 patatas fritas left. Then, Billy doubled the number of patatas fritas taken by Kyle, so he took away another 19 x 2 = 38 patatas fritas from Griffin. After that, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her own patatas fritas, which is not specified in the question but can be assumed to be a small amount (let's say 5 or 6). Finally, Colby took away 3 patatas fritas from Griffin, leaving him with 27 patatas fritas at the end. Therefore, the total number of patatas fritas given to Griffin by Ginger and Colby is 6 + 5 = 11 patatas fritas."
"Response: 16 pescados (or fish)
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
* In one aquarium, there are 4 snails.
* In another aquarium, there are 32 snails and twice as many fish as in the first aquarium.
* The difference between the number of snails in both aquariums is equal to the number of fish in the second aquarium.

Now, let's use this information to find out how many fish are in each aquarium:

Number of fish in the first aquarium = Number of snails - Snails in the first aquarium = 4 - 4 = 0

So, there are no fish in the first aquarium.

Number of fish in the second aquarium = Twice the number of fish in the first aquarium + Number of snails in the second aquarium = 2 x 0 + 32 = 64

Therefore, there are 64 fish in the second aquarium."

$750
Explanation: To find out how much money the chef spent on cebollas, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that result by the cost per pound. So, if there are 4 bags of cebollas and each bag weighs 50 pounds, then the total weight is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. If it costs $1,50 per pound, then the total cost is 200 pounds x $1,50 = $300. Therefore, the chef spent $300 on cebollas."
