Response:  First, we know that Janet sells her eggs at $2 per egg to farmers every day. If she sells 16 eggs per day, then she earns $32 per day from egg sales ($2 x 16). Next, we know that she spends $3 per day on food for herself (3 x $1) and $4 per day on ingredients for making brioches for her friends (4 x $1). So, her total daily income is $32 - $3 - $4 = $25 per day.
Response:  We need two screws of blue fiber and half of white fiber. So we have to calculate how many screws in total do we need.  To find out, let's divide the number of screws of blue fiber by 2 (since we need two) and add the number of screws of white fiber that we need (which is half).  Therefore, the total number of screws needed is:  2 (blue fibers) + 0.5 (white fibers) = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5  So, we need 2 and a half screws in total.
"Response:  First, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent an additional $50,000 on repairs. So, the total amount he invested in the house is:  
$80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000  Next, we are told that after the repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%. This means that the new value of the house is:  
New value = Old value x 1.5 = $80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000  Now, let's calculate the profit: Profit = New value - Total investment = $120,000 - $130,000 = $10,000  So, Josh made a profit of $10,000 from his investment in the house."
Response: 1) James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, for a total of 180 meters per week (3 x 60).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Wendi gives her chickens three meals per day and each meal contains three bowls of mixed feed for chickens which includes seeds, worms, and vegetables to keep them healthy. In the morning, she gives her flock of 20 chickens 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she gives them an additional 25 bowls of food. So, in total, how many bowls of food does Wendi need to give to her chickens every day?  To find out, let's add up the number of bowls from each meal:  3 (morning) + 3 (afternoon) = 6 bowls/day x 20 chickens = 120 bowls/day
Response:  If each pahar costs $5 and 60% of that is $3, then two pahars would cost $6 (2 x $3). So, if Kylar buys 16 pahars, she will pay 16 x $6 = $96.
Response:  First, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So if Charleston has x sheep, then Toulouse has 2x sheep.  Next, we know that Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So if Seattle has y sheep, then Charleston has 4y sheep.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  2x + 4y =?  We know that Seattle has 20 sheep, so let's substitute that in for y:  2x + 4(20) =?  2x + 80 =?  Solve for x and you get:  2x = 70  So Toulouse has 2x = 140 sheep, and Charleston has 4y = 320 sheep.  Together, they have 140 + 320 = 460 sheep.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute. Secondly, she needs to restart her computer after installing updates, which takes 20 minutes. Finally, she has to start downloading from scratch again. So, in total, it will take:  
20 minutes (for installation of updates) + 2 minutes (to restart the download) = 22 minutes To download a 200 GB file, it would take approximately 22 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 1320 seconds or 13.2 hours."
"Response:  First, we know that John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour. That means he covers a distance of:  
distance = speed x time  
distance = 60 x 3  
distance = 180 miles  
Next, we know that John spends two hours in traffic, so he has to drive for an additional 2 hours at a slower speed. We are given that he drives for this portion of the trip at a speed of 30 miles per hour. So, we can calculate the distance he covers during these two hours as follows:  
distance = speed x time  
distance = 30 x 2  
distance = 60 miles  
Now, let's add up the total distance John travels:  
total distance = distance from first 3 hours + distance from last 2 hours  
total distance = 180 + 60  
total distance = 240 miles  
Finally, we need to find out how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours. Since he started 240 miles away from home and drove for 4 hours, we can calculate his final location as follows:  
final location = starting point + distance traveled  
final location = 240 + 240  
final location = 480 miles  
Therefore, after driving for 4 hours, John is 480 miles away from home."
Response:  First, we know that Eliza worked for 45 hours this week. We also know that her regular rate per hour is $10. So, if she worked for 45 hours, her total earnings at her regular rate would be: Total Earnings = Number of Hours x Regular Rate Total Earnings = 45 x $10 = $450 Next, we are told that Eliza received overtime pay for the first 40 hours she worked. Overtime Pay = Number of Overtime Hours x Overtime Rate Overtime Pay = 40 x 1.2 x $10 = $480 Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week include both her regular pay and her overtime pay: Total Earnings = $450 + $480 = $930
Response:  First month: 60 downloads Second month: 3 times as many downloads = 180 downloads Third month: 30% less than 180 downloads = 126 downloads Total number of downloads in three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 466
Response:  First we need to calculate how much did she spend for each type of pastry. For gogoşi, it was $68/duzină = $68/3 = $22.67 per unit. For mini-cupcakes, it was $80/duzină = $80/2 = $40 per unit. And for mini-cheesecakes, it was $55/duzină = $55/6 = $9.17 per unit. Now let's add up all these costs: $22.67 + $40 + $9.17 = $62.84. So Toula spent in total $62.84.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend each year for planting and maintaining the tree. We know that he needs to pay $90 for planting the tree, and then he needs to spend $3 per year for watering and fertilizing it. So, in total, Carlos will spend $90 + $3 = $93 per year. Now let's look at the revenue side of things. We know that the tree will produce 7 lămâi per year, and each lămâi can be sold for $1.5. So, the total revenue from selling the lămâi is 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 per year. Now, let's subtract the expenses from the revenue to find out when Carlos will start making a profit: Profit = Revenue - Expenses Profit = $10.5 - $93 = -$82.5 per year Negative profits mean that Carlos will not make a profit in the first few years. To find out exactly how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit, we can divide the negative profit by the annual expenses: Years until profit = -$82.5 / $93 = 0.9 (approximately 9) years This means that Carlos will need to wait approximately 9 years before he starts making a profit from his lămâie.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Melanie sold one-third of her aspirators to the green house, which means she had three times as many aspirators as she sold (3 x 1 = 3).  Secondly, she sold two more aspirators to the red house, so now let's subtract what she sold from what she had before: 3 - 2 = 1. Finally, she sold half of what was left to the orange house, so let's divide what was left by two: 1 / 2 = 0.5 or one and a half. Therefore, Melanie started with five aspirators in total.
Response:  We know that 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance and 25% of the remaining students (i.e., those who did not enroll in contemporary dance) enrolled in jazz dance. So we can start by finding out how many students did not enroll in contemporary dance.  There were 20 students in the class, so if 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance, then 20 x 0.2 = 4 students did not enroll in contemporary dance.  Now we know that 4 students did not enroll in contemporary dance, and 25% of these students (i.e., 1 student) enrolled in jazz dance. Therefore, there are 1 student who enrolled in jazz dance.  Finally, to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance from the total number of students in the class.  Total number of students = 20  Students enrolled in contemporary dance = 4  Students enrolled in jazz dance = 1  Therefore, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:  Total - Contemporary - Jazz = 20 - 4 - 1 = 15  So, 15 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the estimated value of each option at the end of the month based on the growth rates provided. For the jewelry option, we have:  
Value at the end of the month = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125  
For the electronic devices option, we have:  
Value at the end of the month = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096  
Now, let's compare the two options and determine which one would provide the highest profit. Based on the calculations above, the electronic devices option has a higher estimated value at the end of the month ($8,096) compared to the jewelry option ($5,125). Therefore, if the merchant wants to maximize their profit, they should choose the electronic devices option."
Response:  The first day, both trains travel for 80 miles westward. So, the distance covered by each train is 80 miles. On the second day, they travel northwards for 150 miles. Therefore, the total distance covered by each train in two days is: Day 1: 80 miles + Day 2: 150 miles = 230 miles.
Response:  First, we need to calculate Jill's weekly income as a teacher and as a cheerleading coach separately.  As a teacher, she earns $30 per hour x 35 hours per week = $1050 per week.  As a cheerleading coach, she earns $20 per hour x 15 hours per week = $300 per week.  Now, let's add up her weekly income from both jobs: $1050 + $300 = $1350 per week.  Since there are 50 weeks in a year (assuming she works full-time all year round), her annual income would be: $1350 x 50 weeks = $67,500 per year.
Response:  First, we know that Claire eats 3 eggs per day for breakfast, so she consumes 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week. Since there are 4 weeks in 4 weeks, Claire will eat a total of 21 x 4 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.
Response:  First, we know that Marissa took one hour to cover the first four miles at a certain speed. Then she spent another hour to cover the next two miles. So, in total, she spent two hours to cover six miles. Now, we want to find out what speed she needs to maintain for the remaining distance of 6 miles if she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To do this, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (speed), and t is the time taken. Since Marissa has already covered 6 miles, the distance left to travel is 6 - 6 = 0 miles. Therefore, there is no distance left to travel, and the equation becomes t = d/r. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: t = 0 / 4 = 0 hour(s). This means that Marissa needs to maintain a constant speed of 4 miles per hour to cover the remaining distance of 6 miles in zero time! In other words, she needs to run at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour to cover the entire distance of 12 miles in exactly one hour.
Response:  We have 24 liters of drink (15 liters of pineapple juice + 9 liters of orange juice). If we add 3/5 of 15 liters of pineapple juice to 2/3 of 9 liters of orange juice, we get: 3/5 x 15 = 6 liters + 2/3 x 9 = 6 liters = 12 liters. So, there are 12 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink.
Response:  We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is currently 31 - 6 = 25 years old.  Since Raymond had his son at age 23, his son must have been born when Raymond was 23 + 6 = 29 years old.  Therefore, Raymond's son is currently 31 - 29 = 2 years old.
Response:  First three clients buy one DVD each, so we have 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs sold. Next two clients buy two DVDs each, so we have 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs sold. Total number of DVDs sold is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs. So, Billy has sold 7 DVDs on Monday.
"Response:  First, we know that the candle burns for 4 hours (from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm).  Second, we know that it burns down by 2 cm every hour. So, if we multiply the number of hours by the amount it burns down each hour, we get:  
2 cm/hour x 4 hours = 8 cm  Therefore, after burning for 4 hours, the candle will be 8 cm shorter."
"Response:  First, we know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50, which is 25% less than the original price. So, if we set up an equation based on this information, it would look like this:  
Original Price = (19.50 x 100) / 75  Original Price = $26.67  Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.67."
"Response:  First, we know that Marie paid $50 for her meal.  Next, we know that she spent $12 on chicken, $3 per package of milk (there were 5 packages), and $1.50 per piece of fruit (there were 4 pieces).  That adds up to:  
$12 + $3 x 5 = $30 + $1.50 x 4 = $6 + $50 = $50  
So, Marie did not buy any pizza."
Response:  First, we know that Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, so she spent 3 x $16.50 = $49.50 on shorts. Next, she bought 3 pairs of pants, so she spent 3 x $22.50 = $67.50 on pants. Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes, so she spent 3 x $42 = $126 on shoes. In total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 on all three types of clothing.
Response:  First, we know that Cynthia consumes one portion of ice cream every evening, so she will need 30 portions in total for 60 days (since there are 2 daily meals).  Secondly, each box contains 15 portions of ice cream, so she will need to buy  30/15 = 2 boxes per day.  Finally, since each box costs $4, her daily expense on ice cream will be 2 x $4 = $8.  Therefore, after 60 days, her total expenditure on ice cream will be 60 x $8 = $480.
Response:  First, we know that Henry stopped after 20 miles and then he had another stop at 15 miles before the end of his journey. So, if we subtract 20 from 60 (the total distance), we get 40 miles. Now, we need to find out how many miles were between the first and second stops. We can do this by subtracting 15 from 40: 40 - 15 = 25 miles. Therefore, there were 25 miles between the two stops.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the price of the boots. Secondly, one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. So, let's call the cost of the second pair of high heels x. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:  2x + 33 = 5 more than the cost of the boots. Simplifying the equation, we get:  2x + 33 = 40. Solving for x, we get:  x = 16. Therefore, the first pair of high heels costs $16, and the second pair costs twice as much, which is $32. The total cost of both pairs of high heels is $48. Now, let's compare this amount with the cost of the boots:  Boots: $40. We can see that the total cost of the boots and one pair of high heels ($40 + $16) is equal to the total cost of both pairs of high heels ($48). Therefore, the cost of one pair of boots is $40.
Response:  First, we know that Darrel is 7 times older than Allen, so if Darrel is x years old, then Allen is 7x - 7 years old.  We also know that the sum of their ages is 162, so we can set up an equation:  x + (7x - 7) = 162  Simplifying this equation, we get:  8x = 162  Now, dividing both sides by 8, we get:  x = 20  So, Darrel is 20 years old and Allen is 20 \* 7 - 7 = 143 years old.
Response:  First, we know that Gunther is trying to count the number of jelly beans in a jar. Second, one of his friends says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. Third, another friend says there are 20 more than half of the first amount, which means there are 20 + (half of 80) = 20 + 40 = 60 jelly beans. Fourth, a third friend says there are 25% more than the first amount, which means there are 80 x 1.25 = 100 jelly beans. So, the median of their guesses is 100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 dogs and each dog needs 0.5 hours per day for walking and taking care of their business. So, in total, all the dogs need 5 hours per day (10 x 0.5). Now, we want to find out how many hours per week John spends taking care of the dogs. There are 7 days in a week, so if we divide 5 hours per day by 7 days, we get: 5 hours/day ÷ 7 days = 0.71 hours/day (or 42 minutes/day) Therefore, John spends approximately 42 minutes per day taking care of the 10 dogs.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and there are 30 gold coins more than silver coins. So we can start by finding out how many silver coins Gretchen has. Since there are 30 gold coins more than silver coins, if Gretchen has x silver coins, she will have x + 30 gold coins.  Now we know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up an equation: x + (x+30) = 110  Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 30 = 110 Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us: 2x = 80 x = 40 Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  And since there are 30 gold coins more than silver coins, Gretchen also has: 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's beads, so we can start with that information.  Half of 40 is 20, so Aaron has 5 + 20 = 25 beads.  Now, we know that Siobhan has fewer beads than Aaron, so we can subtract Aaron's beads from the total number of beads to find out how many beads Siobhan has.  40 - 25 = 15.  Therefore, Siobhan has 15 beads.
Response:  First, we know that Mike played for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. So, he scored 4/20 = 0.2 points per minute in the first 20 minutes. Now, we are told that in the next 20 minutes, he scored with 25% more frequency than before. This means his new scoring rate is 1.25 x 0.2 = 0.25 points per minute. Since there were 20 minutes left to play after the first 20 minutes, Mike scored a total of 20 x 0.25 = 5 points in the last 20 minutes. Therefore, his final score was 4 + 5 = 9 points.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much Terry spends per day on yogurt. We know that he eats 2 yogurts per day and each yogurt costs $4. So, his daily expense on yogurt is:  
$4 x 2 = $8 per day. Now let's calculate his total expense for 30 days. $8 x 30 = $240. Therefore, Terry will spend $240 on yogurt for 30 days."
Response:  First, we know that John has 13 sets of Lego and he sells each one for $15. So, if he sells all his Lego sets, he will have $15 x 13 = $195. Then, he spends $20 x 8 = $160 on 8 video games. Finally, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. Since he has $35 left, he must still have some Lego sets left. Therefore, the number of Lego sets he has left is $35 / $15 = 2.
Response:  First, we know that John runs for three days per week, so he has four days off.  Second, we know that he runs for a total of six hours per week (three hours each day).  Third, we know that he runs at a constant speed, so his distance traveled is directly proportional to his running time.  Now let's calculate his average speed:  Total distance = Speed x Time  Distance = 60 miles/week x 1 hour/mile  Distance = 60 miles/hour  Since John runs for three hours each day, his daily distance is:  Daily distance = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours  Daily distance = 180 miles/day  Therefore, John's average speed is:  Average speed = Daily distance / Running time  Average speed = 180 miles/day / 3 hours  Average speed = 60 miles/hour  So, John averages 60 miles per hour when he runs.
"Response:  First, we know that Dana can run at a speed of 4 miles per hour (mph). If she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking, then she must spend 2 hours running (1/3 x 6 hours = 2 hours) and 4 hours walking (2/3 x 6 hours = 4 hours).  Since she can jump with a speed of 3 mph, she will cover 3 miles in 1 hour while jumping. Therefore, the total distance she covers in 6 hours is:  
Distance = Speed x Time  
= 3 mph x 2 hours + 4 mph x 4 hours  
= 6 miles + 16 miles  
= 22 miles  So, Dana can travel 22 miles in 6 hours if she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking."
Response:  We know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. So if Ben's iPhone is two years old, then Brandon's iPhone is eight years old (2 x 4 = 8).  Now we know that Suzy's iPhone is one year old. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is seven years older than Suzy's iPhone (8 - 1 = 7).  So, Brandon's iPhone is seven years old.
Response:  First we need to calculate how far Polly can throw the golden arrow without holding the precious stone. We know that she can throw it 120 meters. Now let's add the distance that the precious stone adds to her throwing power. The text states that with the precious stone, she can throw three times as far as without it. So, if she throws the golden arrow without the precious stone, she can reach 120 meters. With the precious stone, she can throw three times that distance, which is 360 meters (120 x 3). Therefore, if Polly holds the precious stone and throws the golden arrow, she can reach a maximum distance of 360 meters from the dragon's flames.
Response:  First, we know that there were five plăcintă and each was cut into eight pieces. So, in total, there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of plăcintă.  Next, we know that after the party, there were 14 leftover pieces of plăcintă. Therefore, if we subtract the number of leftover pieces from the total number of pieces, we can find out how many pieces each guest took:  40 - 14 = 26  So, each guest took approximately 26 pieces of plăcintă.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one serving of potatoes (250g) contains 250 calories. Secondly, we know that there are 5 servings in a 300g bag. Finally, we want to consume 2000 calories daily and have already eaten 1800 calories. So, if we eat another serving of potatoes, how many calories will it add to our total daily intake? To find out, we can calculate as follows: Total daily calorie intake = Daily calorie goal - Calories already consumed Daily calorie goal = 2000 calories Consumed calories = 1800 calories Therefore, Total daily calorie intake = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories Now let's determine how much of the remaining 200 calories we can consume from the potatoes: Potato serving size = Total daily calorie intake / Number of servings in the bag Potato serving size = 200 / 5 = 40 grams
"Response:  First, we know that Charlie spends $10 to buy one kilogram of beeswax and a wick (fitil). So, if he wants to make 20 luminaires, he will spend:  
$10 x 20 = $200  Next, we know that each luminary brings in $2, so Charlie's total revenue from selling all 20 luminaires is:  
$2 x 20 = $40  Now, let's subtract his costs:  
$200 - $40 = $160  Therefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 luminaires is $160."
Response:  First, we know that she wrote 5 articles last week and 2/5 more articles on Monday than on other days of the week. So, if she wrote x articles on Monday, then she wrote 2x/5 articles on other days (since there are 5 days in a week). Now, let's calculate how many hours each article takes her to write. We know that an average article takes her 4 hours to write. Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing all her articles can be calculated as follows: Total hours = (number of articles on Monday) x (time taken per article) + (number of articles on other days) x (time taken per article) Total hours = (2x/5) x 4 + (3x/5) x 4 Total hours = 8x + 12x Total hours = 20x Total hours = 20(5) = 100 hours Thus, Meredith spent 100 hours writing all her articles last week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Candice had 80 bilete in her pocket before she went to work at the cafe. Secondly, we know that she put one Post-it note on each of the 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes used is 220. Since Candice had 23 leftover bilete Post-it, we can subtract 23 from 220 to find out how many were in the package she bought: 220 - 23 = 197. So there were 197 bilete Post-it in the package Candice bought.
"Response:  First, we know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ones. So if he bought x blue ties, he bought 2x red ties.  Second, we know that each red tie costs 50% more than each blue tie. So the cost of one red tie is 1.5 times the cost of one blue tie (or $40 x 1.5 = $60).  Finally, we know that John spent a total of $200 on all his ties. Therefore, the total cost of all the blue ties he bought was $200 / $40 per tie = 5 ties.  Since John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.  The total cost of all the ties John bought is therefore:  
10 red ties x $60 per tie = $600 + 5 blue ties x $40 per tie = $200 = $800."
Response:  First, we know that Tracy used one meter and a half of wire to support her rose plants in the garden. Next, we are told that she cut the wire into pieces of 15 centimeters each. So, if we divide the total length of wire (one meter and a half) by the length of each piece (15 centimeters), we can find out how many pieces she got.  One meter and a half divided by 15 centimeters is equal to... (let me calculate)... 15! That means Tracy got 15 pieces of wire, each one 15 centimeters long.
"Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:  
15 x 8 = 120 units. Now we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. The problem states that ""3/4 of the building is occupied"", so we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:  
3/4 x 120 = 90 units. Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to get the number of available (or free) units:  
120 - 90 = 30 units. So, there are 30 units available for rent or use in the building."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many eggs Lloyd sells in one week. We know that he sells 252 eggs per day and there are 7 days in a week, so:  
Number of eggs sold in one week = Number of eggs sold per day x Number of days in a week  
= 252 x 7  
= 1764 eggs per week Now, we can calculate how much money Lloyd makes in one week from selling eggs. We know that each egg costs $2, so:  
Total amount earned in one week = Total number of eggs sold x Price per egg  
= 1764 x $2  
= $3528 per week"
Response:  First, we know that Nava can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour (mph). We also know that he travels for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), so we need to calculate how far he goes during this time. To do this, we multiply his speed by the number of hours he travels: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 10 mph x 3 h Distance = 30 miles Now, we know that Nava returns with a speed of 6 kilometers per hour (km/h). We want to find out how long it takes him to return. To do this, we divide the distance he needs to cover by his speed: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 30 miles / 6 km/h Time = 5 hours So, it will take Nava 5 hours to return.
Response:  First, we know that each book of banded drawing paper weighs 1/4 kilogram (kg). So if Uriah has 30 books of this type, their total weight is: 30 x 1/4 kg = 7.5 kg. Now, let's consider the toys. Each toy weights half as much as one book of banded drawing paper, so they weigh 1/2 x 1/4 kg = 1/8 kg. Since Uriah has 30 toys, their total weight is: 30 x 1/8 kg = 3.75 kg. In total, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 + 3.75 = 11.25 kg from his shelf.
Response:  First, we know that for each tire of the truck repaired, the mechanic will charge $ 60. For each wheel of the car repaired, the mechanic will charge $ 40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired six truck tires and four car wheels. So, the total amount earned from Thursday's work is: 6 x $ 60 = $ 360 + 4 x $ 40 = $ 160 = $ 520.  Now let's look at Friday's work. The mechanic repaired 12 cars, but did not repair any truck tires. So, the total amount earned from Friday's work is: 12 x $ 40 = $ 480. Therefore, the total amount earned in two days is: $ 520 + $ 480 = $ 1,000.
Response:  First, we know that Patchy had three times as many kittens as Trixie. So if Trixie had 12 kittens, then Patchy would have had 3 x 12 = 36 kittens. But we also know that all of these kittens were adopted from the animal shelter. Therefore, the total number of kittens in the household is 36 + 12 = 48 kittens.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jean has 30 apples and he wants to pack two apples in each sac. So, if we divide 30 by 2, we get 15 as our quotient. Therefore, Jean can fill 15 sacs with his remaining apples.
Response:  First, we know that Peter has $42 per week and he spends $7 for a movie ticket and $7 for popcorn each time he goes to the movies. So, if he wants to go to the movies more than once in one week, he will run out of money before the end of the week. Therefore, the maximum number of times Peter can go to the movies is:  42 / (7 + 7) = 42 / 14 = 3 trips.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total weight of the camion with the driver and empty: 3755 pounds (driver + camion). Then, we add the weight of each box: 15 pounds x number of boxes =? Next, we subtract the weight of the camion and driver from the maximum weight allowed for the bridge: 5000 - 3755 =? Finally, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:? / 15 =? The solution is as follows: Total weight of camion and driver: 3755 pounds Maximum weight allowed for the bridge: 5000 pounds Weight of one box: 15 pounds Subtracting the weight of the camion and driver from the maximum weight allowed for the bridge: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds Dividing the remaining weight by the weight of one box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded: 1245 / 15 = 83 So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 83.
Response:  First we need to calculate the price of the food without any additional fees or taxes. We know that the cost was $40. Next, we need to add the 25% service fee which is calculated as follows: 25% x $40 = $10 So now we have the total amount with the service fee added: $40 + $10 = $50 Now we need to add the delivery commission of $3.00. Therefore, the final price of the food for Stephen will be: $50 + $3.00 = $53.00 Finally, Stephen added a tip of $4.00, so the grand total paid by Stephen will be: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00
Response:  First, we know that each group of grapes has 20 fruits, so there are 6 groups x 20 fruits per group = 120 fruits in total for all groups.  Now, we have 67 individual grapes scattered throughout the bush.  To find out how many more grapes there are besides the ones in the groups, we can add 67 to 120:  120 + 67 = 187.  So, there are 187 grapes in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 25 portocales in total.  Second, we know that 20% of them are immature, which means that 20/100 = 2/5 of them are immature.  Third, we know that 2 are acrid and 2 are rotten, so we need to subtract those from the total number of portocales.  Finally, we want to find out how many are good, so we can say that the number of good portocales is: 25 - (2 + 2) = 25 - 4 = 21.  So, there are 21 good portocales.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much did she pay for the materials used to make the bracelet. We know that she paid $500 for the materials. Next, we need to calculate how much did she pay for the jewelry used to construct the bracelet. We know that she paid $800 for the jewelry. Finally, we need to calculate the total amount she paid, including the cost of the materials and the jewelry, as well as the insurance premium. To do this, we multiply the total cost of the materials and jewelry by 1.1 (1 + 0.10), since the insurance premium is 10%. So, the total amount Janet paid = ($500 + $800) x 1.1 = $1300. Therefore, the answer is $1300.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much of her pension will be vested after 20 years and then add that amount to the percentage increase for each year she works beyond 20 years.  After 20 years, Marcy has worked for the company for half of the total time (20/40 = 0.5), so she has earned 50% of the pension benefit.  Therefore, her vested pension benefit after 20 years is $50,000 x 0.5 = $25,000 per year.  Now, let's calculate the annual increase in her pension benefit due to her additional 10 years of service.  For each year beyond 20 years, she earns 5% more than the previous year's vesting amount.  So, after 30 years, her pension benefit would be: $25,000 + (5% x $25,000) = $25,000 + $1,250 = $26,250 per year.  And after 40 years, her pension benefit would be: $26,250 + (5% x $26,250) = $26,250 + $1,312 = $27,562 per year.
"Response:  First, we know that the monthly fee for the streaming service is $140.  If the company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year (6 months), then she paid:  
$140 x 6 = $840  Now, if the company charged her 10% less for the second half of the year (6 months), then she paid:  
$840 x 0.9 = $752  So, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service for the entire year is:  
$840 + $752 = $1,592"
"Response:  First, we know that Sophia has already traveled 160 kilometers since she last filled up her gas tank, so we can subtract that from the total amount of gas in her tank to find out how much is left:  
12 gallons - 160 km / 4 liters/km = 84 miles  
Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 84 miles (135 kilometers) on one fill-up of gas."
Response:  First, we know that Jim spends two hours watching TV and then he sleeps for half of that time (since he reads for the other half). So, if he watches TV for 2 hours, he sleeps for 1 hour (50% of 2 hours). Therefore, in total, he spends 3 hours per day on these activities (2 + 1 = 3). Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends on these activities over four weeks:  Week 1: 3 hours/day x 7 days = 21 hours Week 2: 3 hours/day x 7 days = 21 hours Week 3: 3 hours/day x 7 days = 21 hours Week 4: 3 hours/day x 7 days = 21 hours Total hours spent on TV and reading over four weeks: 21 hours/week x 4 weeks = 84 hours
Response:  First, each school sent one team of four players (two boys and two girls) for a total of 4 x 4 = 16 players. Second, each school also sent one coach for each team, so there were 4 x 2 = 8 coaches in total. Therefore, the total number of people sent by all schools is 16 + 8 = 24.
Response:  First, we know that there were 175 diamonds in total. Next, we are told that there were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. This means that if there had been as many rubies as diamonds, there would have been 35 + 175 = 210 rubies. However, since there were only 2 times more smaragds than rubies, there were actually 2 x 35 = 70 smaragds. Therefore, the total number of precious stones was 175 (diamonds) + 70 (smmaragds) + 35 (rubies). So, the answer is 280.
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls at school and each teacher has 5 students. So we can start by finding out how many teachers there are.  To do this, we can divide the number of students (60) by the number of students per teacher (5): 60 / 5 = 12  Therefore, there are 12 teachers at the school.
"Response:  First, we know that Bailey has $x dollars at first. Then he receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so he gets: 

$$ 5 \times 8 = 40 $$ additional dollars.  So, after 8 weeks, Bailey has: 

$$ x + 40 =? $$  Now, we know that Bailey has a total of $100 after 8 weeks. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

$$ x + 40 = 100 $$ Solving for $x$, we get: 

$$ x = 60 $$ So, Bailey had $60 at first."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many students Judy teaches in total per week. There are 7 days in a week and she teaches 5 classes per day, so she teaches a total of 5 x 7 = 35 classes per week. Next, we need to calculate how many students she teaches overall. If each class has 15 students, then she teaches a total of 35 x 15 = 525 students per week. Finally, we can calculate her weekly income as follows: Weekly Income = Number of Students x Price Per Student So, her weekly income is $525 x 15 = $7,875 per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second one has twice as many instructions as the first one. So, if we double the number of instructions in the first recipe, we get 40 instructions for the second recipe. Therefore, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions to prepare both dishes.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Tommy will make from selling each type of dessert.  For brownies, he will make $3 per brownie, so if he sells 43 brownies, he will make $43 x $3 = $129.  For cheesecakes, he will make $4 per cheesecake, so if he sells 23 cheesecakes, he will make $23 x $4 = $92.  Now, let's add up all the money that Tommy will make: $129 + $92 = $221.  So, in total, Tommy will make $221 from selling both brownies and cheesecakes.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all five phones: Total Cost = 5 x $150 = $750 Now, let's calculate the monthly payment for each phone based on a 3-month repayment period and a 2% interest rate per month: Monthly Payment = Total Cost / (1 + Interest Rate)^Number of Months Monthly Payment = $750 / (1 + 0.02)^3 Monthly Payment = $750 / 1.06^3 Monthly Payment = $498.32 So, Sheila will pay $498.32 per month for 3 months to purchase the five smartphones at $150 each with a 2% monthly interest rate.
Response:  First, we know that Artie sells three types of flowers - calendula, petunia and begonia. He usually sells calendula for $2.74 per bouquet, petunia for $1.87 per bouquet, and begonia for $2.12 per bouquet. Today, he has no change, so he decides to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 bunches of calendula, 9 bunches of petunia, and 17 bunches of begonia, how much will he make in total?  To find out, let's calculate the total amount earned from each type of flower first:  Calendula: 12 x $2 = $24  Petunia: 9 x $1 = $9  Begonia: 17 x $2 = $34  Now, add up the totals to get the grand total: $24 + $9 + $34 = $67
Response:  Firstly, we know that each level of the sandcastle will have half the area of the previous level. So if the topmost level has an area of 16 square meters, then the second-from-top level will have half that area, which is 8 square meters. The third level down will have half the area of the second from top, which is 4 square meters, and so on. Therefore, the average area of one level of the sandcastle is 4 square meters.
Response:  First, we know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy with one bowl of food for dogs every day for the first 180 days. That means she will use up 180/365 = 1/2 of a bag of dog food per day. Since there are 110 servings in each bag, Cecilia will use up half of a bag every day for the first 180 days. Therefore, she will need 180 x 110 = 19800 servings of dog food during this period. After the first year, she needs to give two bowls of food to her puppy every day, so she will use up twice as much food. To calculate how many bags of food she will need after the first year, let's divide the total number of servings needed (19800) by the number of servings in each bag (110): 19800 / 110 = 179.17 or approximately 180 bags of dog food per year. So, Cecilia will need 180 bags of dog food per year for her puppy.
"Response:  First, we know that Sarah spală 4 times more than David, so if David spală x pounds of laundry, Sarah spală 4x pounds of laundry.  Next, we know that Raymond spală half as much as David, so Raymond spală (1/2)x pounds of laundry.  Finally, we are told that Sarah spală £400 worth of laundry.  So, to find out how much Raymond and David together spală, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  
Sarah + Raymond = Sarah + (1/2)David  
(4x) + (1/2)(x) = 400  
3x + (1/2)x = 400  
4x = 400  
x = 100  
So, David spală 100 pounds of laundry, and Raymond spală 50 pounds of laundry (since he only spală half as much).  Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry spală de Raymond and David is:  
Raymond - David = 50 - 100 = -50 pounds."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one flower in a pack of three is $2.50. So, if Vincent buys 18 flowers, he will pay 18 x $2.50 = $45. Now, let's compare this with the price of two packs of flowers. Two packs of flowers contain 6 flowers each, so the total cost would be 2 x $1 = $2. If Vincent buys two packs of flowers, he will pay $2 + $2 = $4. Therefore, by buying two packs of flowers instead of one pack of three, Vincent saves $45 - $4 = $41.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the original price without any discounts.  The cost of caring for the dog is $100 (as mentioned in the problem). Next, we need to find out how much the reduction is worth.  We know that the reduction is 30%, so we can multiply $100 by 30/100 to get $30. Now, we subtract the amount of the reduction from the original price to find the final price with the discount: $100 - $30 = $70. Therefore, the final cost of caring for the dog after the discount is $70.
Response:  First, we know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water each, so together they received 2/6 = 1/3 of 24 liters of water. This means they received 8 liters of water in total.  Next, we know that a boy received 6 liters of water. So, if we subtract the amount of water the girls received from the total amount of water available (24 liters), we get: 24 - 8 =?  To find out how many liters of water are left, we can simply add the amount of water the girl received to the amount of water the boy received: 8 + 6 =?  Therefore, there are 14 liters of water left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie had 10 autocolante initially. Then she bought 21 more from the store, so now she has 10 + 21 = 31 autocolante in total. Next, she gave 9 autocolante to her sister, leaving her with 31 - 9 = 22 autocolante. Finally, she used 28 autocolante to decorate the birthday card, leaving her with 22 - 28 = 4 autocolante remaining. Therefore, Charlie has 4 autocolante left.
Response:  First we know that Alex weighs 1.5 kg less than Grace, so if Grace weighs x kg, then Alex weighs x - 1.5 kg. Now we need to find out how much both of them weigh together in kg. We can do this by adding their weights: x + (x - 1.5) =?  To solve for x, let's add the two expressions: x + x - 1.5 =?  Simplifying: 2x + 0.5 =?  Solving for x: 2x = 95  Therefore, Grace weighs 95 kg and Alex weighs 93.5 kg (since Alex weighs 1.5 kg less than Grace).  So, their combined weight is: 95 + 93.5 = 188.5 kg.
"Response:  First, we know that each tufiș of trandafiri has 25 trandafiri.  Second, we know that each trandafir has 8 spini. So, to find out how many spini there are in total, we need to multiply the number of tufișe of trandafiri by the number of trandafiri in each tufiș and then multiply that result by the number of spini per trandafir. Here's the calculation:  
25 (tufișe of trandafiri) x 25 (trandafiri in each tufiș) x 8 (spini per trandafir) = 4000 spini.  Therefore, there are 4000 spini in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the team played 22 matches and won 8 more than they lost. So, if they lost x matches, they won x + 8. Since they won more than they lost, their total number of wins is greater than or equal to the number of losses. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information: x + (x + 8) = 22...
Response:  Firstly, we know that she has been going on vacation for four times a year since she was 23 years old, so she has been doing this for 11 years now (23 + 11 = 34).  Secondly, each shirt represents one block of her vacation memories, and there is one shirt for each year of her vacations. Therefore, in total, she has collected 11 blocks of vacation memories (11 x 4 = 44).
Response:  First time it sounded for four times more than the first time, so it sounded for 4 x 3 = 12 times. The second time it sounded three times longer than the first time, so it sounded for 3 x 12 = 36 times. The third time it sounded for half the time of the second time, so it sounded for 36 / 2 = 18 times. Therefore, the alarm sounded 18 times in total.
Response:  First, we know that Sylvie has been with the company for five years as of December. This means she started working there in December of year one.  Second, we know that the company pays each employee $600 per month. Third, we know that the company has a policy of increasing salaries by 10% every year for employees who have remained with the company for five years. So, if Sylvie has been with the company for five years, her salary will increase by 10% every year.  Now let's calculate her annual salary after three years of service:  Year 1 (December to December): $600 x 12 = $7,200  Year 2 (January to December): $7,200 x 1.10 = $7,920  Year 3 (January to December): $7,920 x 1.10 = $8,648  Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three years of service is $8,648.
Response:  We know that the first album of Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than the one of Harald. So if Marilyn sold x copies, Harald sold 10x copies.  Now we are given that in total, both albums sold 88,000 copies. Therefore, Marilyn sold 88,000/10 = 8,800 copies and Harald sold 88,000/10 = 8,800 copies as well.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many gift bags Christina needs in total. Since one-fourth of the participants will not come, she needs 4 times 16 = 64 gift bags (since each guest receives 4 gift bags). Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost would be: 64 x $2 = $128.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much food each adult will eat. We know that one adult will eat 10 kg of salad, so if there are 20 adults, they will eat a total of 20 x 10 = 200 kg of salad. Now let's calculate how much food each child will eat. We know that one child will eat half as much as an adult, so if there are 5 children, they will eat a total of 5 x (1/2) = 25 kg of salad. To find out how much salad Ted needs to bring in total, he should add up the amount of food needed for both adults and children: 200 kg + 25 kg = 225 kg. So Ted needs to bring at least 225 kg of salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.
Response:  We know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. So if Cindy has four pets, Marcia will have four + two = six pets. Therefore, all three girls have the following number of pets:  Cindy - four, Marcia - six, and Jan - eight (since she has three more than Marcia).
Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So we can start with those two pieces of information.  If Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, then Jackson must be... years old. (We don't know his age yet.) And if Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, then Corey must be... years old. (Again, we don't know his age yet.) Now let's look at the third piece of information: James is 10 years old and is one year younger than Corey. So we can set up an equation based on that: Corey = James + 1. Now we have three equations and three unknowns. Can you use these equations to figure out how old Jackson is?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lee takes 38 seconds to run 400 meters with obstacles, so we can say that his speed is 38/400 = 0.95 meters per second (m/s). Now, we are told that Gerald has improved his diet and increased his speed by 10%, which means he now runs at a speed of 1.1 x 0.95 = 1.045 m/s. Therefore, if Gerald runs 400 meters with barriers, it will take him approximately 400 / 1.045 = 38.27 seconds.
Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined. So if there were x dogs and y cats, then there would be x + y - 12 rabbits.  Since each cat has two rabbits, we can write this as 2x + 2y - 12.  Now we know that there are 60 dogs (or 60 cats), so let's substitute that into our equation:  2x + 2y - 12 = 60  Simplifying and solving for x and y gives us:  x = 30  y = 24  So there are 30 dogs and 24 cats in the neighborhood.  Each cat has two rabbits, so there are 24 x 2 = 48 rabbits.  In total, there are 30 + 24 + 48 = 102 animals living in the neighborhood.
"Response:  We know that there are 200 students in the class and 2/5 of them are boys. So, we can start by finding out how many boys there are.  There are 2/5 of the total number of students who are boys, so if we multiply 200 by 2/5, we get: 

Boys = 2 x 200 / 5 = 40 boys.  Now we know that there are 40 boys in the class.  Next, we know that 2/3 of the remaining students (those who are not boys) are girls. So, we can find out how many girls there are by multiplying the total number of students who are not boys by 2/3.  Girls = (200 - 40) x 2/3 = 160 x 2/3 = 80 girls.  Therefore, there are 80 girls in the class.  To find out how many girls are not in the scouts, we need to subtract the number of girls who are in the scouts from the total number of girls.  Girls not in scouts = 80 - 20 = 60 girls.  So, there are 60 girls who are not in the scouts."
Response: 1) Harry slept for 9 hours last night. 2) His friend James slept for only 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, James slept for 9 x 2/3 = 6 hours. Therefore, James slept for 6 more hours than Harry.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each container of strawberries contains three strawberries and has a weight of 40 grams. Secondly, we are given that when Freda cooked the strawberries in sugar syrup, she lost half of their volume. Therefore, if she used x strawberries to make 32 units of sauce, then she must have used 2x strawberries initially (since she lost half of them). Now, let's substitute this value into our first equation:  3x = 40(3) = 120 grams  Since Freda only used 32 units of sauce, we can set up an equation based on that information as well:  32 = 3x So now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use these equations to find out how many strawberries Freda used?
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 30 cars on the highway. Secondly, we know that some cars passed through the first 15 minutes of blockage (we don't know exactly how many). Thirdly, we know that another 20 cars passed through the remaining 15 minutes of blockage (again, we don't know exactly how many). Finally, we know that 5 cars took an exit to avoid the blockage. So, let's start by subtracting the number of cars that took the exit from the total number of cars on the highway: 30 - 5 = 25. Now, let's subtract the number of cars that passed through the first 15 minutes of blockage from the remaining cars: 25 - x = 20, where x is the number of cars that passed through the first 15 minutes of blockage. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5 (since there were 5 cars that passed through the first 15 minutes): x/5 = 20/5 = 4. Therefore, 4 cars passed through the first 15 minutes of blockage. So, the total number of cars that passed through the blockage in the first 15 minutes is 4 + 20 = 24 cars.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has 2 plants already in her 40 pervas windows. So she has 2 plants now.  Second, we know that yesterday she received 18 new plants from her favorite nursery. So she will have 2 + 18 = 20 plants tomorrow. Finally, we know that she wants to give one plant each to her friends and family, so she will be left with 20 - 1 = 19 plants. Therefore, Mary will have 19 plants after giving away one plant to each of her friends and family.
Response:  First, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.  The second friend pressed the doorbell for 1/4 more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed the doorbell for 5 times (20 x 1/4).  The third friend pressed the doorbell for 10 times more than the second friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell for 15 times (5 + 10).  Finally, the fourth friend pressed the doorbell for 60 times.  So, in total, the doorbell rang 20 + 5 + 15 + 60 = 95 times.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pages Solo has left to read in each subject area.  Secondly, we will divide that number of pages by the number of days he has left to finish reading. Finally, we can find out how many pages Solo needs to read per day on average.  So let's start!  In total, Solo has 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages left to read. He has 4 days left before the exam, so we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days: 39 / 4 = 9.75 pages per day. Since you cannot have a fraction of a page, Solo should aim to read approximately 10 pages per day to finish all his reading within the given time frame.
Response:  We know that John drinks one glass of water before going to bed every night (on weekdays). So, he drinks 7 glasses of water per week (7 days x 1 glass/day). In addition, we know that John also drinks one glass of water during each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), so he drinks 3 more glasses of water per day, for a total of 21 glasses of water per week (3 glasses/day x 7 days). Therefore, John drinks a total of 28 glasses of water in a week (7 + 21).
Response:  First, we know that it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3 miles of the city. So if we want to find out how many minutes it will take to cover the entire city (which is 42 miles long), we need to divide the length of the city by the distance covered per unit of time (in this case, 3 miles).  Therefore, we can calculate as follows:  42 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes = 420 minutes or approximately 7 hours.  Thus, it would take approximately 7 hours for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
Response:  First, Poppy put one-fourth of the pieces on the table, so she has three-fourth left to place. Now, her mother puts one-third of the remaining pieces on the table, so she has two-thirds left to place. To find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we can multiply the number of pieces that Poppy has left by the number of pieces her mother has left. 3/4 x 2/3 =?  We know that there are 1000 pieces in total, so let's see what we get when we simplify this expression: 3/4 x 2/3 = 6/12 = 2/3  Therefore, there are 2/3 x 1000 = 667 pieces left to be placed.
Response:  First, we know that Cody eats three times as many pancakes as Amir. So if Amir eats 5 pancakes, Cody will eat 3 x 5 = 15 pancakes. Therefore, together they will eat 5 + 15 = 20 pancakes.
Response:  First we need to find out the volume of one box.  Volume = Length x Width x Height  Volume of one box = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches  Volume of one box = 120 cubic inches  Now let's calculate the total volume of all three boxes:  Total volume = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box  Total volume = 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches  Total volume = 360 cubic inches Therefore, the total volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic inches.
Response:  First, we know that Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. Next, we know that he watched one hour of his favorite show every night from Monday to Thursday (Monday through Thursday). Therefore, he watched 4 hours of his favorite show (1 hour x 4 days = 4 hours). On Wednesday, he also watched some episodes of another show for 30 minutes. So, let's add that to our total: 4 hours + 30 minutes = 4 hours and 30 minutes. Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. We can do this by dividing the total number of minutes he watched on Wednesday by 30: 30 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 1 episode. Therefore, Frankie watched 1 episode of a 30-minute show on Wednesday. Finally, we can calculate the total number of episodes he watched each day as follows: Monday - 1 hour Tuesday - 1 hour Wednesday - 1 episode (30 minutes) Thursday - 1 hour Friday - 2 hours Total episodes watched per day: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 episodes per day.
Response:  First, we know that Henry made 15 more pastries than he wanted to make. So if he wanted to make x pastries, then he actually made x + 15.  Next, we know that he threw away 5 pastries because they were too hot. So the number of pastries he has left is x + 15 - 5 = x + 10.  Finally, we know that he has a total of 110 pastries. So we can set up the equation:  x + 10 = 110.  Solving for x gives us:  x = 90.  Therefore, Henry made 90 pastries last year.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much the customer pays for 1 gallon of gasoline at the local gas station. We know that the price per gallon is $3. Therefore, the cost of 10 gallons would be:  10 x $3 = $30 Now, let's consider the cashback offer from the application company. They offer $20 cashback for each fill-up. So, if someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline, they will receive:  10 x $20 = $200 cashback In total, the customer will pay $30 for the gasoline and receive $200 in cashback, making their net cost:  $30 - $200 = -$170 Negative? That can't be right! It looks like the customer actually makes money by buying gasoline at this station!
Response:  First we need to find out how many pieces of fruit each person can eat if they eat everything.  For Marcel, he has 3 rows and 14 columns, so he can eat 3 x 14 = 42 pieces of fruit.  For Beatrice, she has 2 rows and 24 columns, so she can eat 2 x 24 = 48 pieces of fruit.  Now let's say that both people eat all the fruit.  Marcel eats 42 pieces and Beatrice eats 48 pieces.  So in total, they eat 42 + 48 = 90 pieces of fruit.  But wait! We were asked for the average number of pieces of fruit each person ate. To find this, we divide the total number of pieces of fruit by the number of people. In this case, we have 90 / 2 = 45 pieces of fruit per person.
"Response:  First, we know that the boat took 16 seconds to travel 20 meters. That means it traveled at a speed of: 

Speed = Distance / Time 

Speed = 20 m / 16 s 

Speed = 1.25 m/s 

Now, we need to find out how much water the boat took in. We are given that the boat takes two liters of water for every ten meters it travels. So, if the boat traveled 20 meters, it would have taken: 

Water taken = Distance x Water per distance 

Water taken = 20 m x 2 L/10 m 

Water taken = 40 L 

Finally, we want to know how long it took for Julia to reach shore after the boat started taking on water. We are given that the parts were 64 seconds apart. So, if the boat started taking on water after 16 seconds, Julia reached shore after: 

Time = Distance / Speed + Start time 

Time = 64 s - 16 s 

Time = 48 s 

Therefore, it took Julia 48 seconds to reach shore after the boat started taking on water."
Response:  We know that there are 4 professors who use the classroom and each professor has 2 lessons per day. So, in total, there will be 8 lessons per day (4 professors x 2 lessons per day). Now, we need to find out how many times the blackboard is cleaned per day. Since the blackboard is cleaned every 3 hours, it means that it is cleaned 8 times per day (8 lessons per day x 1 cleaning per 3 lessons). Therefore, the blackboard is cleaned 8 times per day.
Response:  If Ryan plants two flowers per day and there are 15 days in total, then he will have planted a total of 2 x 15 = 30 flowers.  Now, if 5 of these flowers did not grow, then we need to subtract 5 from 30:  30 - 5 = 25.  So, after 15 days, Ryan has 25 flowers that grew.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of photographs that can be stored on Jamal's phone is 6 times greater than the number of photographs that can be stored on Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone can store 50 photos, then Jamal's phone can store 6 x 50 = 300 photos.  Secondly, we are given that there are 1800 birds in the photo taken at the zoo with Jamal and his friends. Therefore, if each bird takes up one photo, then there would be 1800 / 300 = 6 photographs of birds in the photo. However, since some of the birds may be partially obscured or overlapping, it's possible that not all 6 birds can be seen clearly in each photograph. So let's round down to the nearest whole number. There would be approximately 5 photographs of birds in the photo taken at the zoo with Jamal and his friends.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha spent on all the wood she has. We know that she has 10 plates of 2x4x10 and five 4x4x10 plates. So, in total, she spent:  
10 x 10 x 2 = 200 dollars for the 2x4x10 plates  
5 x 10 x 4 = 200 dollars for the 4x4x10 plates  
Total amount spent = 200 + 200 = 400 dollars  
Now, let's find out how much Sasha can sell each plate for if she wants to make a profit of 50%. To do this, we will use the formula:  
New price = Old price x (1 + Profit percentage)  
In this case, the old price is what Sasha paid for each plate, and the profit percentage is 50%. So, we have:  
New price = 10 x 10 x 2 = 200 dollars x (1 + 0.5) = 200 x 1.5 = 300 dollars per plate for the 2x4x10 plates  
New price = 5 x 10 x 4 = 200 dollars x (1 + 0.5) = 200 x 1.5 = 300 dollars per plate for the 4x4x10 plates  
Since Sasha has 10 plates of each type, her total profit would be:  
Profit from 2x4x10 plates = 10 x 300 = 3,000 dollars  
Profit from 4x4x10 plates = 10 x 300 = 3,000 dollars  
Total profit = 3,000 + 3,000 = 6,000 dollars"
"Response:  We know that Katy used 7 times more sugar than water in her coffee. So if she used x liters of water, she used 7x liters of sugar. Since there are 100 grams of sugar in each liter of sugar, we can calculate how much sugar Katy used as follows:  
Let's start with the amount of water she used. The problem states that she used ""câteva"" (several) cups of water, but it doesn't give an exact number. Let's assume she used 5 cups of water (since each cup contains 250 milliliters). Therefore, the amount of water she used is:  
Now let's move on to the amount of sugar she used. Since she used 7 times more sugar than water, we can multiply the amount of water she used by 7:  
So Katy used 7 x 5 = 35 liters of sugar. Since there are 100 grams of sugar in each liter, we can calculate the total amount of sugar she used as follows:  
Therefore, Katy used 35 x 100 = 3500 grams of sugar."
Response:  First, we know that John bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. So he bought a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. We also know that each pair cost $60, so the total amount John paid is 6 x $60 = $360.
Response:  We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each in the first day, so the total number of vehicles imported was 2 x 5 = 10.  On the second day, we are told that the total number of vehicles in the port increased from 10 to 30. Therefore, the number of additional vehicles imported on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20. Since all containers contained 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4. So, there were 4 containers imported on the second day.
"Response:  First, we know that Adrien earned $120,000 four years ago and his salary increased by 30%. So, his current salary is:  
$120,000 x 1.3 = $156,000  Now, we know that Lylah's salary was 30% less than Adrien's salary four years ago. So, her current salary is:  
$156,000 / 0.7 = $222,857  Therefore, the total amount of money received by both Adrien and Lylah four years later is:  
$156,000 + $222,857 = $378,857"
Response:  First, we know that Miguel uses two sheets of paper per week, so he uses 2 x 4 = 8 sheets of paper per month (since there are four weeks in a month). Now, if there are 30 sheets of paper in a block, then Miguel uses 8/30 = 1/4 of a block each month. Therefore, Miguel uses one-fourth of a block of paper every month.
Response:  First, we know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 pears. Next, we know that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette and half as many pears. So, if Morisette brought 5 apples, then Kael brought 10 apples (2 x 5). Additionally, since Kael brought half as many pears as Morisette, he brought 4 pears (half of 8). Therefore, in total, there are 5 + 10 + 4 = 19 fruits.
"Response:  First, we know that Sadie slept for 8 hours less in two days, so she slept for 8 + 2 = 10 hours each of those nights.  If she slept for 10 hours each of those nights and then slept for an additional hour more each night for the rest of the week (for a total of 7 nights), she would have slept for a total of:  
10 + 1 + 1 +... + 1 = 10 + 7 = 17 hours."
"Response:  First, we know that Rosie can run at a rate of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers a distance of:  

10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles  

Next, we know that after 3 hours, Rosie runs at a rate of 5 miles per hour for another 4 hours (since there are 4 hours left in the 7-hour time period). So, she covers an additional distance of:  

5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles  

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can cover in 7 hours is:  

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles"
Response: 1) Jennie puts timbres on one-third of the letters that need them. So if there are x letters that need timbres, she will put timbres on x/3 of them. 2) She has already stamped 30 letters. So, if y is the number of letters in the original pile, we know that y - 30 is the number of letters left to be stamped.  Now we can set up an equation based on these two facts:  If Jennie stamps timbres on one-third of the remaining letters, then the number of letters she stamps is (y - 30)/3.  But wait! We also know that she has already stamped 30 letters, so the total number of letters she has stamped is 30 + (y - 30)/3.  Simplifying this expression gives us:  30 + (y - 30)/3 = 30 + y/3  Solving for y gives us:  y = 90  Therefore, there were 90 letters in the original pile when Jennie started.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia bought a pack of 5 new spoons. Secondly, she used three spoons to taste the tocană while cooking it. Finally, when she went to set the table, she had 12 spoon rests in total. So, if we subtract the number of spoons she used (3) from the total number of spoon rests (12), we can calculate how many spoons were in the pack that Julia bought: 12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, there were 9 spoons in the pack that Julia bought.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dylan bought more fish bones than chicken bones. Secondly, we know that she bought 38 chicken bones. Thirdly, we know that she bought more fish bones than chicken bones. So let's add up all the numbers to find out how many fish bones and chicken bones Dylan bought in total. We can start with the number of chicken bones:  38 + 6 = 44 (since there are 6 more fish bones than chicken bones) Now we have our final answer! Dylan bought 44 bones in total - 38 chicken bones and 6 fish bones.
Response:  First, we know that Amy made 20 new friends at her new school, so she has 20 + 5 = 25 friends in total.  Now, if Lily made 50 friends, then together they have 25 + 50 = 75 friends.
Response:  First, we know that one pepene costs three times as much as one piper. So if one pepene costs $15, then one piper must cost $15 / 3 = $5.  Next, we know that one portocală costs $5 less than one pepene. So if one pepene costs $15, then one portocală costs $15 - $5 = $10.  Now let's calculate how much Dillon will spend in total:  He needs to buy 4 pepene, which means he needs to pay 4 x $15 = $60 for pepene.  He also needs to buy 20 ardei, which means he needs to pay 20 x $5 = $100 for ardei.  Finally, he needs to buy 10 portocale, which means he needs to pay 10 x $10 = $100 for portocale.  In total, Dillon will spend $60 + $100 + $100 = $260.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money the hospital earns from each patient visit. We know that the doctor charges $150 per hour and sees each patient for an average of 24 minutes (which is equivalent to 0.4 hours). So, the total amount earned by the doctor per patient visit is:  
$150 x 0.4 = $60 per patient visit. Next, we need to calculate how much the hospital earns from each patient visit. We know that the hospital charges $200 per hour and has a capacity of 500 patients per day (which is equivalent to 500 x 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes). So, the total amount earned by the hospital per day is:  
$200 x 12,000 = $2,400,000 per day. Now, let's calculate the daily profit of the hospital. To do this, we subtract the cost of providing medical services (doctor fees + hospital overhead) from the total revenue generated by the hospital. Based on our calculations above, the daily cost of providing medical services is:  
$60 x 500 = $30,000 per day. Therefore, the daily profit of the hospital is:  
$2,400,000 - $30,000 = $2,370,000 per day. Finally, to find out the annual profit of the hospital, we multiply the daily profit by 365 (the number of days in a year):  
$2,370,000 x 365 = $849,950,000 per year."
Response:  Firstly, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her store during Christmas time. Secondly, one-third of the elves quit after the children vomit on them. Thirdly, 10 more elves quit after the children hit their shins. So, we need to find out how many elves are left. We can do this by subtracting the number of elves who quit from the original number of elves hired. In this case, if one-third of the elves quit (20), and then another 10 quit, that means there were 40 elves left (60 - 20 - 10 = 40).
Response:  First, we know that in May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than in May. So, in June, Joseph spent $500 - $60 = $440. Therefore, the total amount Joseph spent for both months is: $500 + $440 = $940.
Response:  First, Pam went on the roller coaster twice and Fred went four times, so they both used up all their tickets for that ride. Then, they each rode the luge twice more. So, in total, Pam used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets and Fred used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets.
Response:  First, we know that Walt walked 6 km on Monday (Luni). Next, we are told that he walked 6 times more miles on Tuesday (Marți) than he did on Monday. So, if Walt walked x kilometers on Monday, then he walked 6x kilometers on Tuesday. We also know that the total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday (Luni - Miercuri) is 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  6k + 6x = 41 where k represents the distance Walt walked on Monday and x represents the distance he walked on Tuesday. Now let's solve for x. To do so, we need to isolate the variable x in our equation. We can start by subtracting 6k from both sides of the equation:  6k + 6x = 41 - 6k 6x = 35 Now divide both sides by 6 to find x: x = 35/6 x = 5.83 miles So, Walt walked 5.83 miles on Tuesday.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Tom pays for each car wash. We know that each car wash costs $15. So if Tom gets his cars washed four times a month (i.e., 4 x $15 = $60 per month). Now let's multiply this amount by 12 months to find out how much Tom pays in one year: $60 x 12 = $720 per year.
Response:  If Brian has 20 games and lost 5 before making the comparison, then he has 20 - 5 = 15 games left. Since Bobby is 5 times less than Brian, Bobby has 15 x 5 = 75 games.
Response: 16 of the remaining 27 unicorns are in Scotland (two-thirds). Since two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female, we can find out how many females there are by multiplying 16 by two-thirds.  Multiplication gives us: 16 x 2/3 = 11 So, there are 11 female unicorns in Scotland.
"Response:  First we calculate the total cost of the order without delivery fee and tip:  
2 x Supa = 2 x 7.50 = 15.00$  
2 x Chips = 2 x 1.50 = 3.00$  
2 x Prăjituri = 2 x 1.00 = 2.00$  
Total Cost = 15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00$  
Now let's add the delivery fee (20%) to the total cost:  
Delivery Fee = Total Cost x 20% = 20.00 x 20% = 4.00$  
New Total Cost = Total Cost + Delivery Fee = 20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00$  
Finally, let's add the tip (5 dollars) to the new total cost:  
Tip = 5.00$  
Final Cost = New Total Cost + Tip = 24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00$  
So, Rory's order will cost 29.00$."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. So, he spent 8 hours x 5 questions/hour = 400 minutes completing the first test.  Secondly, we know that Mark completed the second test with 100 questions in 6 hours. Therefore, he spent 6 hours x 5 questions/hour = 300 minutes completing the second test.  Now, let's calculate how many questions were left incomplete for each test:  For the first test:  400 minutes - 300 minutes (time taken to complete the second test) = 100 minutes (remaining time) x 5 questions/minute = 500 questions (left incomplete)  For the second test:  300 minutes - 240 minutes (time taken to complete the first test) = 60 minutes (remaining time) x 5 questions/minute = 300 questions (left incomplete)  There are 500 questions left incomplete for the first test and 300 questions left incomplete for the second test.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 bile de gumă albastre and 4 times as many bile de gumă roz. So we can start with the number of bile de gumă albastre:  
12 bile de gumă albastre x 4 = 48 bile de gumă roz.  Therefore, there are 48 bile de gumă roz in total."
Response:  We know that there are 20 machines available for rent, and we have been given information about their types: 12 automatic machines, 4 manual machines, and some semi-automatic machines (but not how many). To find out how many semi-automatic machines there are, we can subtract the number of automatic and manual machines from the total number of machines. So, we start with the total number of machines: 20. Subtracting the number of automatic machines (12): 20 - 12 = 8 Now subtract the number of manual machines (4): 8 - 4 = 4 Therefore, there are 4 semi-automatic machines. As a percentage, this is: 4/20 x 100% = 20%
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees as drones. So, if we let x represent the number of drone bees, then the number of worker bees would be 2x.  Since there are also twice as many puis as workers, the number of puis is 2(2x) = 4x.  Finally, since there is one queen for every 700 bees, there is one queen.  Therefore, the number of worker bees is 2x, the number of drones is x, and the number of puis is 4x.  The total number of bees is 700, so we can set up the equation:  2x + x + 4x = 700.  Simplifying this equation gives us:  6x = 700.  Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:  x = 116.  So, there are 116 drone bees, 232 worker bees, and 464 pupae.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jordan spends two hours per day playing video games, which is equal to 14 hours per week (2 x 7 = 14). Secondly, we know that he works half-time for $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from work are:  
$10/hour x 20 hours/week (half-time) = $200/week  
Now, let's calculate how much money Jordan would make in one week if he spent all of his time playing video games instead of working:  
14 hours/week (video game time) x $10/hour = $140/week  
Therefore, if Jordan spent all of his time playing video games instead of working, he would earn $200 + $140 = $340 per week."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much each item costs without any discount or taxes. Then we will add up all these amounts and subtract the total amount of money that John spent. Here are the calculations for each item: Lapte (milk) - $2 Ouă (eggs) - $3 Becuri (light bulbs) - $3 Pahare (cups) - $3 Capcane pentru gândaci (traps for flies) - $4 Total cost without taxes = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15 Now let's apply the 10% tax rate to all non-food items. We can use the formula: Tax = 0.1 x Cost Non-Food Item So, the tax for each non-food item is: Tax on milk = 0.1 x $2 = $0.2 Tax on eggs = 0.1 x $3 = $0.3 Tax on light bulbs = 0.1 x $3 = $0.3 Tax on cups = 0.1 x $3 = $0.3 Tax on fly traps = 0.1 x $4 = $0.4 Total tax = $0.2 + $0.3 + $0.3 + $0.4 = $1.2 Now we add the total cost without taxes ($15) to the total tax ($1.2): Final cost = $15 + $1.2 = $16.20
"Response:  First, we know that each customer needs two bottles of cleaner and one pack of cleaning cloths. So, if Lucas has three customers, he will need to buy:  
2 x 2 = 4 bottles of cleaner (at $2 per bottle) = $8  
1 x 1 = 1 pack of cleaning cloths (at $5 per pack) = $5  
Total cost for three customers = $8 + $5 = $13  
Now, let's look at the potential clients that Lucas is talking to. If he gets all five of them as customers, he will need to buy:  
2 x 2 = 4 more bottles of cleaner (at $2 per bottle) = $8  
1 x 1 = 1 more pack of cleaning cloths (at $5 per pack) = $5  
Total additional cost for five potential customers = $8 + $5 = $13  
So, in total, Lucas will have spent:  
$13 (for his current customers) + $13 (for the potential customers) = $26  
His total revenue for the week will be:  
$8 (from his current customers) + $5 (from the potential customers) = $13  
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $13 - $26 = -$13 or -$1 per week."
Response:  First, we know that there are 10 hectares of pineapple fields and each hectare has 100 pineapples per month. So, in total, there are 10 x 100 = 1000 pineapples per month. Since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, he will have 4 opportunities to harvest in one year (12 months). Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can collect in one year is 1000 x 4 = 4000 pineapples.
Response:  First, we know that Johnny has three sets of Legos with different numbers of pieces: 500, 3 times as many as 500 (so 1500), and 1/4 of 500 (which is 125). To find out how many blocks Johnny will lift if he lifts all of his Legos, we need to add up the number of pieces in each set. So let's do that:  500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.  Therefore, Johnny will lift 2125 blocks if he lifts all of his Legos.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours and half of them returned within the next 6 hours. So, if there were x bees who had left the hive before Debra started monitoring again, then half of x (x/2) would have returned during her second observation period. Additionally, each bee that had left before Debra started monitoring again but did not return yet will also come back within the last 6 hours of the day. Therefore, the total number of bees returning to the hive in the last 6 hours is:  x + (x/2) = 3x/2. Since Debra saw twice as many bees returning as she saw leaving, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is 2(3x/2) = 6x. Finally, since Debra saw 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours, the total number of bees returning to the hive in the last 6 hours is 6x - 30. The correct answer is: 6x - 30.
Response:  First, we know that the cost of admission for an adult is $12 and for a child is $10. So if Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8, she must have given her $8 - $10 = $2 less than what she would have paid for two tickets. Since one ticket costs $12, the total amount she paid for both tickets is $12 + $12 = $24. Therefore, Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8 - $24 = -$16 (negative sixteen dollars).
Response:  We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and Dorothy has 3 friends on Facebook. So, if we divide 12 by 3, we get... 4! That means James has 4 times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Since James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy, James must have 4 x 3 = 12 friends on Facebook.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how long it takes for Steve to get home from school. We know he can go at 440 feet per minute, so if he has to travel 3 miles (which is equal to 15,000 feet), it will take him:  
Time = Distance / Speed Time = 15,000 ft / 440 ft/min Time = 33.3 minutes Steve starts at 2:30 PM and finishes at 2:63.3 PM So now let's calculate how much time Tim needs to catch up with Steve. We know that Tim can go at 264 feet per minute, and he has to cover a distance of 3 kilometers (which is equal to 9,000 feet). So it will take him:  
Time = Distance / Speed Time = 9,000 ft / 264 ft/min Time = 33.7 minutes Since Steve finished at 2:63.3 PM, and Tim starts at 2:30 PM, Tim will catch up with Steve after:  
Time difference = Finish time - Start time Time difference = 2:63.3 PM - 2:30 PM Time difference = 33.7 minutes + 33.3 minutes Time difference = 67 minutes Therefore, Tim will catch up with Steve in 67 minutes."
Response:  First, we know that each tire costs $0.25 to inflate. There were 5 people who came with bicycles and wanted to inflate both of their tires, so they paid $0.25 x 2 = $0.50 per person. Three people came with tricycles and wanted to inflate all four tires, so they paid $0.25 x 4 = $1.00 per person. Finally, one person came on a unicycle and did not need to have any tires inflated, so they did not pay anything. In total, the amount earned in that day was: $0.50 + $1.00 + $0.00 = $1.50.
Response:  First, we know that Carl buys ten packages of cookies, and each package has six cookies inside. So, in total, Carl buys 10 x 6 = 60 cookies.  Next, we know that each cookie costs $0.10, so the total amount Carl pays for all the cookies is 60 x $0.10 = $6.00.  Now, let's look at the change Carl receives. He pays with a $10 bill, but he only needs to pay $6.00 for the cookies, so the change he receives is $10 - $6.00 = $4.00.  Therefore, the answer is $4.00.
Response:  First, Dave ate 14 cartofi prăjiți. Then, the flamingo ate half of what was left (14 / 2 = 7). Next, three sparrows ate three each (3 x 3 = 9), leaving five cartofi prăjiți. Finally, a mouse took two thirds of what was left (5 / 2 = 3), so there were only five cartofi prăjiți remaining. Therefore, when Dave bought the package, it contained 5 + 14 = 19 cartofi prăjiți.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in one week, Kimo has 3 hours of classes per day, for 3 days (Luni, Miercuri, and Vineri), so he has a total of 9 hours of classes per week. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo will have a total of 9 x 16 = 144 hours of classes in a semester.  Now, let's consider the days when Kimo has only two hours of classes (Marți and Joi). On these days, he has 2 hours of classes each, so he will have a total of 2 x 2 = 4 hours of classes per week. Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends in class during a semester is 144 + 4 = 148 hours.
Response:  First, we know that Bill has 300 pieces of bread, and each piece is 15 cm long, so the total length of all the bread is:  300 x 15 = 4500 cm  Next, we know that Bill has 120 croissants with chocolate, and each croissant is 20 cm long, so the total length of all the croissants is:  120 x 20 = 2400 cm Finally, we know that Bill has 60 baguettes, and each baguette is one meter long, so the total length of all the baguettes is:  60 x 100 = 6000 cm Now let's add up the total length of all the products: 4500 + 2400 + 6000 = 13900 cm So, if Bill places all his products end to end, they will be 13900 cm or 139 meters long!
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paznicul needs to order bananas for all the monkeys in the zoo every two months. Secondly, we have information about how many bananas each species of monkey needs per month: - Maimutes need 200 bananas per month - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month - Baboons need 100 bananas per month To calculate how many bananas Paznicul needs to order for two months, we can multiply the number of bananas needed per month by two: Maimutes: 200 x 2 = 400 bananas Gorillas: 400 x 2 = 800 bananas Baboons: 100 x 2 = 200 bananas Therefore, Paznicul needs to order a total of 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas for two months.
"Response:  First, we know that Blake has run back and forth 15 times, so he has covered a distance of 2 x 100 = 200 meters.  Now, let's look at Kelly's runs. She ran once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total distance of 80 yards (since there are 96.5 yards in a football field). But she did this 34 times, so her total distance traveled is 34 x 80 = 2720 yards.  Since Kelly traveled farther than Blake, she is the winner. The difference between their distances is:  
Winner: Kelly - Blake = 2720 - 200 = 2520 yards."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much Raphael spent on stationery. We know that he bought four pens which cost $1.5 each, so in total he paid:  4 x $1.5 = $6 Now let's move on to the notebooks. He purchased two of them at $4 each, so the total for this item is:  2 x $4 = $8 Finally, there's the pack of paper worth $20. So, altogether Raphael spent: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34
Response:  First, we know that 11 puşti are swimming in the lake.  Next, we know that 6 of them emerged from under a willow tree. So, there are 11 - 6 = 5 puşti left in the water. Now, we know that 2 of these remaining puşti are hiding under a rock. Therefore, there are 5 - 2 = 3 puşti visible to Finn in the lake right now.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the water level in the reservoir was higher on Monday than it was on Wednesday. This means that the water level decreased between Monday and Wednesday.  Secondly, we know that the water level on Wednesday was two-thirds of what it was on Monday. So if the water level on Monday was x feet, then the water level on Wednesday would be two-thirds of x, or 2x/3 feet.  Now let's use this information to find the height of the water level on Wednesday. We know that the adâncimea apei (water level) on Monday was 17 feet, so we can set up an equation based on this:  17 = 2x/3  To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:  51 = 6x  Now divide both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:  25.5 = x  Since x is equal to 25.5, we can now calculate the height of the water level on Wednesday as follows:  2x/3 = 2(25.5)/3 = 51 feet  Therefore, the adâncimea apei (water level) in the reservoir on Wednesday was 51 feet.
Response:  First, we know that Anakin caught 10 stars of marine life, which is a lot! Next, we see that Locsin caught fewer stars than Anakin, with only 5. That means that Locsin missed out on 5 opportunities to catch something. Now, let's look at the other sea creatures that they caught. Anakin caught 6 crabs and 3 clownfish, while Locsin caught 3 crabs and 2 clownfish. This tells us that Anakin caught more crabs (6 vs 3) and more clownfish (3 vs 2). Finally, we can add up all the sea creatures that both Anakin and Locsin caught: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 for Anakin, and 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 for Locsin. So, in total, Anakin caught 9 more sea creatures than Locsin did.
Response:  If the price increases by 20% every two months, then after one month, the price will increase by 20/100 = 1/5 of the original price. So, if the original price is $20, the price after one month will be $20 x (1 + 1/5) = $20 x 1.2 = $24.  After two months, the price will increase again by another 20%, so the price will be $24 x (1 + 1/5) = $24 x 1.22 = $29.28.  After three years (which is equal to 36 months), the price will be $29.28 x (1 + 1/5)^(36-1) = $29.28 x (1 + 1/5)^{35} = $29.28 x 2.75 = $81.21.  Therefore, after 36 months, the price of the bag of balls would be approximately $81.21.
Response:  We know that one figurine costs $5 and one red machine costs $4.  So if we have three figurines, they would cost $5 x 3 = $15.  And if we have five red machines, they would cost $4 x 5 = $20.  Therefore, all the toys together are worth $15 + $20 = $35.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time Jackie spends doing her own accounting work if she decides not to hire an accountant. We know that she will spend 3 hours less per week (3 x 60 = 180 minutes) and that she earns $35 per hour as an independent worker. Therefore, the amount of money she saves by doing her own accounting is:  
$35/hour x 180 minutes = $6,300 per year  
Now, let's look at the cost of hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90 per month, which translates to $1,080 per year ($90 x 12 months). So, if Jackie decides to hire an accountant, she will pay $1,080 per year for their services. Comparing the two options, we can see that:  
If Jackie does her own accounting, she will save $6,300 - $1,080 = $5,220 per year in costs. If she hires an accountant, she will pay $1,080 per year. Therefore, the more financially advantageous option for Jackie is to do her own accounting work."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Elvira spent on the computer and its accessories: Computer = 1090 € + Scanner = 157 € + CD-burner = 74 € + Imprimanta = 102 € Total = 1323 € Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from her budget of 1500 €: 1500 € - 1323 € = 177 € So, Elvira will have 177 € left for clothes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each time Sandra wants to make one Spanish flan, she needs three eggs from her neighbor Mrs. Sandrei. So for 15 flans, she will need 45 eggs in total (15 x 3). Now, let's see how many times Sandra has to take care of her children if Mrs. Sandrei gives her nine eggs every time she takes care of them. We can calculate this as follows:  Total number of eggs needed = 45 eggs (for 15 flans) Number of times Sandra needs to take care of her children = Total number of eggs needed / Number of eggs per visit  = 45 eggs / 9 eggs/visit = 5 visits Therefore, Sandra needs to take care of her children five times to get enough eggs for making 15 Spanish flans for the school fundraiser.
Response:  We know that Brooke is two years younger than Seth, so we can start with Seth's age.  If Brooke is two years younger, then she is (28 - 2) = 26 years old. Now we can set up an equation based on this information.  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write: Seth's age = 2 x Brooke's age  Seth's age = 2 x 26  Seth's age = 52  Therefore, Seth is 52 years old.
Response:  If Ethel has $8, then she has 8 dollars.  Now, we know that Jimmy has more than Ethel, so if Jimmy has x dollars, then Ethel has x-8 dollars.  We want to find out how many dollars Jimmy has, so let's set up an equation based on this information.  Here is the equation:  Jimmy has x dollars.  Ethel has x - 8 dollars.  We know that Jimmy has more than Ethel, so we can say that x > (x - 8).  Simplifying the equation, we get:  x > x - 8.  Solving for x, we get:  x = 10.  Therefore, Jimmy has 10 dollars.
Response:  First, we know that Pancho merges 30 kilometers per day, except for weekends when he walks 10 miles. So, during the weekdays, Pancho drives 30 km/day x 5 days = 150 km. Now, let's calculate how many miles Pancho walks during the weekends: 10 miles/day x 2 days = 20 miles. Therefore, in one week, Pancho drives 150 km + 20 miles = 170 miles.
Response:  First, we know that each hat costs $25. Next, we know that each jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the cost of one jacket is 3 x $25 = $75. Finally, we know that the cost of the pants is half the cost of the jacket, so the cost of one pair of pants is $75 / 2 = $37.50. Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $25 + $75 + $37.50 = $147.50.
"Response:  First, we know that Jake sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so he sees a total of 80 x 8 = 640 legs from the spiders alone. Next, we know that he sees 90 insects with 6 legs each, so he sees a total of 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. Finally, we are told that there are three ""mutant"" invertebrates with 10 legs each, but since they are not specified as being either spiders or insects, let's just count them separately. So, Jake sees a total of 3 x 10 = 30 additional legs from these mutants. Therefore, the total number of legs that Jake sees is: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs."
Response:  First, we know that Sally 4 is three years older than Sally 3. So if Sally 3 is x years old, then Sally 4 is (x + 3) years old.  Next, we know that Bunica Roşie is twice as old as Sally 3. So if Sally 3 is x years old, then Bunica Roşie is 2x years old.  Finally, we know that there are four birds in total. So let's add up all their ages: Sally 3 + Sally 4 + Bunica Roşie = Total Age  We can substitute the expressions for each bird's age into this equation: Sally 3 + (x + 3) + 2x = Total Age Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this as: 3x + 3 + 2x = Total Age Simplifying, we get: 5x + 3 = Total Age Now solve for x to find out how old Sally 3 is: 5x + 3 = x(5) + 3 = 15x + 3 Since we want Sally 3 to be 8 years old, we set up the equation: 15x + 3 = 8 Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us: 15x = 5 To find x, divide both sides by 15: x = 5/15 = 1/3 Therefore, Sally 3 is 1/3 years old, and Sally 4 is 1/3 + 3 = 4/3 years old.  As for the total age of the four birds, we have: Sally 3 + Sally 4 + Bunica Roşie = (1/3) + (4/3) + 2(1/3) = 10/3 years old.  The total age of the four birds is 10/3 years old.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays each month for her credits, credit card, and mortgage.  Monthly payment for student loans = $300 Minimum monthly payment for credit card = $200 Minimum monthly payment for mortgage = $500 Total monthly payments = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000 Now, let's assume that Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt. So, she will pay: 150% of $300 = $450 for student loans 150% of $200 = $300 for credit card 150% of $500 = $750 for mortgage Total increased monthly payments = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1,500 In one year, Jessica will pay: 12 x $1,500 = $18,000 If Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, she will pay $18,000 in one year.
"Response:  First, we know that Billy needs 1.5 minutes to cook one potato (1 minute and 30 seconds). Second, we know that he can cut 60 potatoes in 5 seconds (since there are 60 potatoes and it takes only 5 seconds to cut each one). So, if we divide the total number of potatoes by the time it takes to cut one potato, we get:  
Time to prepare all the potatoes = Total number of potatoes / Time per potato  
Time to prepare all the potatoes = 60 / 1.5  
Time to prepare all the potatoes = 40 minutes  
Therefore, Billy will take 40 minutes to finish preparing all the potatoes."
Response:  First, we know that they sold 25 gallons of lemonade because they made $25 in profit. We also know that each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Since they sold 25 gallons, their total revenue was 25 x $5 = $125. Now, we are told that they earned $25 in profit, so their total expenses must have been $125 - $25 = $100. Finally, since they used 20 pounds of lemons per gallon and there were 25 gallons sold, they used a total of 25 x 20 = 500 pounds of lemons. So, the cost of lemons was $3 x 500 = $1500. Therefore, the amount spent on lemons was $1500.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 80 Japanese runners in total. Secondly, we know that there are 60 male Chinese runners. Thirdly, we can deduce that there must be at least 24 female Chinese runners (since there cannot be more than 240 runners overall and all the Japanese runners are male). Therefore, the number of female Chinese runners is 24.
Response:  First, we know that Zaid spends one-fourth of his salary on rent (25%), one-fourth on fuel for his car (25%), and half of what remains on charity (50%). He also gives his daughter $200 per week and his wife $700 per month for household expenses. So, let's calculate how much he has left after all these expenses and donations.  Rent: 25% of $6000 = $1500 Fuel: 25% of $6000 = $1500 Charity: Half of ($6000 - $3000) = $1500 Total Expenses: $1500 + $1500 + $1500 = $4500 Left After All Expenses: $6000 - $4500 = $1500 Donation to Wife and Daughter: $1500 Therefore, Zaid will have $1500 left after all expenses and donations.
Response:  We know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so if Monic has x crabs, then Rani has x + 10 crabs.  We also know that Bo has 40 crabs and Monic has 4 less than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  Rani has x + 10 crabs Monic has x crabs Bo has 40 crabs Total number of crabs = x + (x + 10) + 36 To simplify this equation, we can combine like terms: Total number of crabs = 2x + 10 + 36 Simplifying further gives us: Total number of crabs = 2x + 46 The final answer is: Total number of crabs = 2(x) + 46, where x is any positive integer.
Response:  First, we know that Lloyd earned $10 per hour as a tutor. Second, we are given that he had 5 hours of tutoring in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. So, let's calculate his earnings for each week separately. Week 1: 5 hours x $10/hour = $50 Week 2: 8 hours x $10/hour = $80 Total earnings for both weeks: $50 + $80 = $130
Response:  We know that the winner received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in class. So we can start by finding out how many votes the winner received.  3/4 x 80 =?  Now let's find out how many votes the loser received. The winner received 3/4 of the votes, so the loser received the remaining 1/4 of the votes. 1/4 x 80 =?  Finally, add the number of votes the winner received to the number of votes the loser received to find out the total number of votes cast.? +? = 80.  Can you solve for the unknown numbers?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white carnations. So if she ordered 200 white carnations, she also ordered 800 red roses (4 x 200).  Secondly, we know that she ordered five times more caly than white carnations. So if she ordered 200 white carnations, she also ordered 1000 caly (5 x 200).  Finally, we know that she wants to receive all the missing red roses before 5 pm. To calculate how many red roses Fred needs to deliver, let's divide the total number of red roses ordered (800) by the number of roses she still needs (300), which gives us:  800 / 300 = 2.67  Therefore, Fred should deliver approximately 267 red roses to Sandra before 5 pm to fulfill her order and avoid losing the business.
Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age. So, if we find out how old Mark is now, we can determine how old Jean must be.  First, let's calculate how old Mark is now:  Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age. Therefore, Mark's current age is:  Mark's current age = (2 x 5) + Half of Jean's age  Mark's current age = 10 + Half of Jean's age Now, we need to find out what half of Jean's age was two years ago. Since Jean is currently 30 years old, her age two years ago was:  Jean's age two years ago = 30 - 2  Jean's age two years ago = 28  Therefore, half of Jean's age two years ago was:  Half of Jean's age two years ago = 28 / 2  Half of Jean's age two years ago = 14  Now we have all the information we need to calculate Mark's current age:  Mark's current age = 10 + Half of Jean's age two years ago  Mark's current age = 10 + 14  Mark's current age = 24  So, Mark is currently 24 years old.  Finally, we can use this information to find out how old Jean is:  Jean's current age = Mark's current age + 2  Jean's current age = 24 + 2  Jean's current age = 26  Therefore, Jean is currently 26 years old.
Response:  First we need to calculate how long it will take for each member of the second team to run their respective laps. We know that the first runner will finish in 60 seconds, so the second runner will finish in 57 seconds (since they are 3 seconds faster). The third runner will finish in 54 seconds (since they are 2 seconds faster), and the fourth runner will finish in 51 seconds (since they are 1 second faster). Now let's compare these times to the times of the first team: The first runner of the first team will finish in 55 seconds, as we were told. The second runner will finish in 55 seconds as well, since they have the same time. The third runner will finish in 55 seconds, and the fourth runner will finish in 55 seconds as well. Since all four members of the first team finish at the same time, there is no difference in their finishing times. Therefore, the two teams will cross the finish line at the same time, and neither team will win.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the probability of Jerry throwing two consecutive numbers.  We can do this by finding the number of ways he can throw two consecutive numbers and dividing that by the total number of possible outcomes.  To throw two consecutive numbers, Jerry must choose one number first and then choose the next number that is one more than the previous number.  So, there are n+1 possible choices for the second number if the first number is n.  Therefore, the probability of throwing two consecutive numbers is:  P(consecutive numbers) = (n+1)/6 = 1/2.  Now, let's find the probability of Jerry throwing three or more consecutive numbers.  There are three or more consecutive numbers if Jerry throws three or more numbers in a row that are all equal.  The probability of this event is:  P(three or more consecutive numbers) = (5-1)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.  Finally, we want to find the probability that Jerry throws more than two consecutive numbers.  This is the same as finding the probability that he throws three or more consecutive numbers, which we just calculated:  P(more than two consecutive numbers) = 2/3.  Therefore, the probability that Jerry throws more than two consecutive numbers is 2/3.
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together received 20 apples from their farm, then they must have divided them equally between themselves. Since Jenna alone received half of what her mother received, she must have gotten 10 apples (half of 20). Therefore, both Jenna and her mother together received 20 + 10 = 30 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 cuşti with hamsters and each hamster receives 5 pieces of food. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food distributed to hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.  Next, we know that there are 3 cuşti with shrews and each shrew receives 6 pieces of food. So, the total number of pieces of food distributed to shrews is 3 x 6 = 18. Finally, we know that there are 20 bucăţi of food left over for other animals (iepuri). Therefore, the total number of pieces of food distributed among all animals is 50 + 18 + 20 = 88. Now, let's find out how many shrews are in each cage. We know that there are 3 cuşti with shrews and each cage contains an equal number of shrews. So, if we divide 18 by 3, we get 6. Therefore, there are 6 shrews in each cage.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much interest Mandy owes Benedict for the first three months. To do this, we multiply the principal amount (100) by the monthly interest rate (2%):  Interest = Principal x Rate x Time  Interest = 100 x 2 x 3  Interest = 600  So, after three months, Mandy owes Benedict $600 in interest. Now, let's add the interest and the principal amounts together to find out how much Mandy needs to pay Benedict altogether:  Total = Principal + Interest  Total = 100 + 600  Total = 700  Therefore, if Mandy was able to pay Benedict after three months, she would need to pay him $700 in total ($100 in principal plus $600 in interest).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the merchant bought each sack of wheat from the farmer at $20 per sack, so the total amount spent by the merchant is: Total Amount Spent = Number of Sacks x Price Per Sack = 10 Sacks x $20/Sack = $200  Next, we know that the cost of transporting each sack from the farm to the warehouse was $2 per sack, so the total transportation cost for all 10 sacks is: Transportation Cost = Number of Sacks x Cost Per Sack = 10 Sacks x $2/Sack = $20  Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated by the merchant after selling all 10 sacks at $30 per sack: Revenue = Number of Sacks x Price Per Sack = 10 Sacks x $30/Sack = $300  Finally, we can find out how many sacks the merchant sold by subtracting the transportation cost from the total revenue and dividing by the price per sack: Number of Sacks Sold = Total Revenue - Transportation Cost / Price Per Sack = $300 - $20 / $30 = 10 Sacks So, the merchant sold 10 sacks of wheat.
Response:  First, they spent $20.25 on 3 tickets at the fair. That means each ticket cost $6.75.  Next, they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. So, if they spent $6.75 on each ticket, they spent $6.75 x 3 = $20.25 on food.  Finally, they went on two different rides that cost $33 each. So, in total, they spent $20.25 + $20.25 = $40.50 on rides.  Since they were evenly splitting all costs, each person paid $40.50 / 3 = $13.50 for everything.
"Response:  We know that John collects strawberries for 3 hours and can gather two strawberries per minute. So, we need to calculate how many minutes he spends collecting strawberries.  
First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 x 60 = 180 minutes Now, we divide the number of minutes by the number of strawberries he can collect per minute: 180 / 2 = 90 strawberries Therefore, John collects 90 strawberries during his 3-hour strawberry-collecting period."
Response:  First, we know that each rat needs to eat 3.5 kilograms of insects per week. Since there are ten rats in total, we can multiply the amount needed by each rat by the number of rats:  10 x 3.5 kg = 35 kg of insects per week.
Response:  First, we know that Tom plants 10 trees per year, so he has planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees in total over the past 10 years.  Next, we know that he cuts down 2 trees per year, so he has cut down 10 x 2 = 20 trees over the past 10 years.  Now, we need to find out how many trees are left after 10 years. We can do this by subtracting the number of trees cut down from the total number of trees planted: 100 - 20 = 80.  Finally, we know that 30% of the trees die, which means that 30% of 80 is 24 (since 30% of 80 is 24). So, there will be 80 - 24 = 56 trees left after 10 years.
Response:  First, there were 18 flamingos in the front yard of Sue's house (on Friday morning). Then, on Saturday morning, one-third of the flamingos were taken away and painted white. So, after that, there were 18 - 1/3 = 12 flamingos left in the front yard. Finally, on Sunday morning, 18 more flamingos were added to the collection, bringing the total number of flamingos to 12 + 18 = 30. Therefore, at lunchtime on Sunday, there were 30 flamingos in the front yard of Sue's house.
Response:  First, we know that Violetta wants to buy new colored pencils and has prepared $20 for this purchase. Second, we know that each colored pencil costs $2. So, if she wants to buy 5 different colors, how many pencils can she afford to buy with her $20? To find out, let's divide $20 by $2 (the cost of one pencil): $20 ÷ $2 = 10. This means that Violetta can buy 10 colored pencils with her $20.
Response:  First, we know that one creon costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30. So if we buy eight of each, we will have to pay: 8 x $1.20 = $9.60 for the creons and 8 x $0.30 = $2.40 for the erasers. Therefore, the total cost is $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 200 kg of mushrooms to be distributed among 40 restaurants. Secondly, each restaurant will receive 2 kg of mushrooms. So, if we divide 200 kg by 2 kg per restaurant, we get: 200 kg / 2 kg/restaurant = 100 restaurants Therefore, 100 kg of mushrooms will not be used (since there are only 40 restaurants).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are exactly 23786 people living in Soda. Secondly, we know that among them, there are 8417 men and 9092 women. Finally, we know that the rest of the population is made up of children. So, to find out how many children there are in Soda, we can subtract the number of men and women from the total population. Total population = 8417 + 9092 + x (where x is the number of children) Subtracting both sides gives us: 23786 - 8417 - 9092 = x We simplify this equation by first subtracting 8417 from both sides: 23786 - 8417 = 9092 + x Now we simplify further by subtracting 9092 from both sides: 14694 = x Therefore, there are 14694 children living in Soda.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 cards and collected three times as much, so she collected 60 cards (20 x 3).  In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she collected 40 cards (60 - 20).  In the third month, she collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first two months combined, so she collected 120 cards (40 + 80).  Therefore, Elaine has a total of 120 cards.
Response:  First, we know that Mark edits 1000 propoziții in each week for two editors. Second, we know that Editor A pays Mark $5 per propoziție, so if Mark edits 1000 propoziții for Editor A, he will earn $5 x 1000 = $5000 from Editor A. Third, we know that Editor B pays Mark twice as much as Editor A, so if Mark edits 1000 propoziții for Editor B, he will earn $5 x 1000 = $10,000 from Editor B. Therefore, in one week, Mark earns a total of $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.
Response:  First, we know that Baldur receives 5 glasses of water in the morning and 6 glasses of water in the afternoon. We also know that each glass contains 5 liters of water. So, let's calculate how many liters of water Baldur receives in total each day. Morning: 5 x 5 = 25 liters Afternoon: 6 x 5 = 30 liters Total: 25 + 30 = 55 liters per day
Response:  First, we know that John received $5000 as a reward and his weekly salary is $2000. So, he earned $5000 + $2000 = $7000 in total for the year. Since he received the prize at the beginning of the year, he earned this amount throughout the year. Therefore, his annual income was $7000.
Response:  First, we know that each acre of grapes produces 5 tons per year.  So if Josie has 10 acres of grapes, she will have 10 x 5 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Next, we know that each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, Josie will have 50 x 2 = 100 barrels of wine per year.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Carl has consumed 7 sandwiches per week (since he had one every day for lunch), and each sandwich contains two slices of cheese. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese consumed through sandwiches is:  
7 sandwiches x 2 slices/sandwich = 14 slices of cheese/week  
Next, we are told that Carl has also made three omelets per week (since he had one every other day for breakfast), and each omelet contains one slice of cheese. So, the total number of slices of cheese consumed through omelets is:  
3 omelets x 1 slice/omelet = 3 slices of cheese/week  
Finally, we are informed that Carl has prepared a large dish of macaroni and cheese once a week, using eight slices of cheese. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese consumed by Carl in one week is:  
14 slices from sandwiches + 3 slices from omelets + 8 slices from macaroni and cheese = 25 slices of cheese/week."
Response:  First, we know that Janet had 22 verdigris and 10 galleries. Then she bought 6 boxes of blue pixels and 2 boxes of red pixels. We also know that there were 9 verdigris in each box of blue pixels and 6 verdigris in each box of red pixels. So let's add up how many verdigris Janet has now: 22 (initial) + 9 x 6 (blue pixels) + 6 x 6 (red pixels) = 22 + 54 + 36 = 108 verdigris.  Therefore, Janet has 108 verdigris now.
Response:  First, we know that Brinley has already taken five tests and has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We also know that the smallest score is dropped from the calculation of the median, so let's drop the smallest score (71) from the list of scores. The updated list of scores looks like this:  89, 92, 100, 86 Now, we add up all these numbers to find the total score:  89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 467 Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests taken (5):  467 / 5 = 93.4 So, Brinley needs a score of at least 93 on the sixth test to achieve an overall average of 93.
Response:  First, we know that Michael rode his bike for four weeks (four weeks x five times per week) = 20 times.  Second, during each of those rides, he traveled 25 kilometers, so in total, he rode 20 x 25 km = 500 kilometers.  Finally, during the third week, he rode only two times per week and covered 60 kilometers each time, which is 2 x 60 km = 120 kilometers.  Therefore, the total distance Michael rode his bike is 500 + 120 = 620 kilometers.
Response:  First, we know that each chocolate in the bag weighs twice as much as a marble. So if one marble weighs 40 grams, two marbles would weigh 80 grams (since each chocolate weighs twice as much). Therefore, the total weight of all 25 chocolates is 25 x 80 = 2000 grams.  Since there are also 80 meringues, their combined weight is 80 x 40 = 3200 grams.  Finally, to find out how much the entire pumpkin-shaped basket of goodies weighs, we add the weights of all the chocolates and meringues together: 2000 + 3200 = 5200 grams.  So, the pumpkin-shaped basket of goodies weighs approximately 5200 grams or 5.2 kilograms.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 pastries.  On Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought three times as many pastries (3 x 4 = 12).  On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought five times as many pastries as she did on Tuesday (5 x 12 = 60). In total, Rose bought:  4 + 12 + 60 = 76 pastries.
"Response:  First, we know that one half of a dozen (or 30) plates costs $6,000 each. So, if we buy two dozen plates, it will cost us twice as much - or $12,000. Now, we are told that two dozen plates cost $1,200 less than the cost of one half of a dozen plates. Therefore, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
$12,000 = 2(6,000) + 1,200  
Simplifying the equation:  
$12,000 = 12,000 + 1,200  
Solving for the cost per plate:  
Cost per plate = $12,000 / 24 plates = $500 per plate."
Response:  First, we know that Sara has already saved $10 before starting to babysit. So she has $10 + $5 = $15 in total. Now let's see how much she needs to earn for each item: Jacheta costs $30, so she needs $30 - $15 = $15 more. Each pair of shoes costs $20, so she needs $20 x 2 = $40 more. In total, she needs $15 + $40 = $55 more. Since she gets paid $5 per session, she needs to babysit 5 sessions (5 x $5 = $25) to afford all three items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day. Secondly, we know that each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day and there are two more white chickens than red ones. Finally, we know that each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day. So let's start with the total number of eggs laid by all chickens: 5 (white) + 3 (red) = 8 eggs/day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs/day, he must have at least 42 - 8 = 34 chickens. Now, if we divide 34 by 2 (to account for the extra white chickens), we get 17. So Jerry has 17 red chickens.
"Response:  First, we need to convert miles to kilometers because we know that Lui Gary walks at a speed of 5 km/hour. There are 1.60934 kilometers in one mile, so:  
Marginu parcului = 1.5 x 1.60934 = 2.414 km 
Time spent walking = Distance / Speed  Time spent walking = 2.414 km / 5 km/h  Time spent walking = 0.4828 hours or approximately 29 minutes and 14 seconds."
Response:  On the first day, Sloane counted 100 clients.  On the second day, she counted 50 more than the previous day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 200 clients.  On the third day, she counted 500 - 200 = 300 clients.  Therefore, Sloane counted 300 clients on the third day.
Response:  We know that both pools have leakage of 4 gallons per minute.  If the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, then it must have started with two times 4 minutes \* 4 gallons/minute = 32 gallons more water than the small pool.  Now, we know that the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so the difference in water between the two pools is now four times 4 gallons = 16 gallons.  Therefore, the large pool currently contains 32 + 16 = 48 gallons of water.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how many hours she needs to work in order to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt together. We know that the total cost of both items is $320 + $32 = $352. Since she gets paid $8 per hour, we can set up an equation as follows:  
Time = Total Cost / Hourly Wage Time = $352 / $8 Time = 44 hours So, Lori would need to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy both the shoes and the belt."
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Janeth borrowed in total: 

2000 x 1.1 (to add the 10% promised) = 2200$ 
Now let's subtract what she will pay each month for 12 months: 

2200 - (165 x 12) =? 
Can you solve this problem and find out how much money will be left for Janeth until she pays off her debt?"
Response:  We know that there are four tulips in the vase and seven daisies more than tulips. So we can start by finding out how many tulips there are: 4 x 3 = 12 Now we need to add the number of daisies to find the total number of flowers in the vase: 12 + 7 = 19 Therefore, there are 19 flowers in the vase in total.
Response:  First, we know that Harriet is 21 years old now.  Second, we know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet.  Third, we know that Zack is half as old as Harriet.  So let's start with Adrian's age.  If Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, then Adrian's age can be found by multiplying Harriet's age by three.  That gives us:  Adrian's age = 3 x 21 = 63 years old  Now, let's find Zack's age.  Since Zack is half as old as Harriet, we can find his age by dividing Harriet's age in half.  That gives us:  Zack's age = 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old However, since Zack cannot have a fraction of a year, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us:  Zack's age = 11 years old Finally, we can calculate the median age of the three by adding their ages and dividing by three.  This gives us:  Median age = (63 + 21 + 11) / 3 = 85 / 3 = 28 years old Therefore, the median age of the three is 28 years old.
Response:  First, we know that Naomi scored 68 points. Second, we know that Yuri scored 10 more than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points. Third, we know that Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Finally, we want to find out how many points Jojo scored. We can set up an equation based on the information given:  68 + 78 + 85 = 251   To solve for Jojo's score, we add the three scores together:  68 + 78 + 85 = 231 So Jojo scored 231 points.
"Response:  First, we know that Lui spent 10 minutes solving one rebus and 5 minutes solving one Sudoku. Next, we know that she solved three crosswords in total over the weekend, but we don't know how long each took her to solve. Finally, we know that she solved eight Sudokus in total over the weekend. To find out how much time Lui spent playing these games overall, we need to add up all of the times she spent on each activity. Here is the calculation:  
* Time spent solving one rebus = 10 minutes  
* Time spent solving one Sudoku = 5 minutes  
* Total time spent solving crosswords = 3 x (time spent solving one crossword) = 3 x (10 + 5) = 3 x 15 = 45 minutes  
* Total time spent solving Sudokus = 8 x (time spent solving one Sudoku) = 8 x 5 = 40 minutes  
Therefore, Lui spent a total of 45 + 40 = 85 minutes playing these games over the weekend."
"Response:  First, Celine used 90 liters of water from the reservoir for her garden. So, the amount of water left in the reservoir is:  
Reservoir water remaining = Initial water - Water used  
= 120 - 90  
= 30 liters Now, we know that twice as much rainwater was collected as the amount of water left in the reservoir. Therefore, the total amount of rainwater collected is:  
Rainwater collected = Reservoir water remaining x 2  
= 30 x 2  
= 60 liters So, there are now 60 liters of water in the reservoir after Celine collected twice as much rainwater as the amount of water left in the reservoir."
Response:  We know that Andy plants 90 geraniums and fewer petunias than geraniums. So we can start with the number of petunias. If Andy plants fewer petunias than geraniums, then he must plant at least one less petunia than geranium. This means that if Andy has 90 geraniums, he will have 89 petunias (since 90 - 1 = 89). Now let's add up all the flowers Andy plants: 90 geraniums + 89 petunias = 179 flowers.
Response:  First year: The company spends $15,000 on advertising. Second year: The company spends one-third of $15,000, which is $5,000, on advertising. Total amount spent on advertising in two years: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Carlos will pay for using the canoe. Since he rented it for 3 hours, and the cost is $30 per hour, his total payment will be:  Carlos's payment = $30 x 3 hours = $90 Next, we need to calculate how much Benji will pay for using the boat with bananas. Since he rented it for 5 hours, and the cost is $18 per hour, his total payment will be:  Benji's payment = $18 x 5 hours = $90 Now that we have calculated the individual payments, let's add them up to find out the total amount they will pay: Total payment = Carlos's payment + Benji's payment = $90 + $90 = $180 Therefore, the total amount they will pay for the rentals is $180.
Response:  First, we know that Andrew will travel for 6 days by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. That means he will spend 6 days on the road, plus an additional half day (1/2) traveling from Rochester back to New Jersey by car. Therefore, in total, Andrew will be away for 6 + 1/2 = 7 days.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of cards that James has after he buys new ones. We know that he has 30 cards of type fire, 20 cards of type grass, and 40 cards of type water. If he loses 8 cards of type water and buys 14 cards of type grass, how many cards does he have in total?  
Total number of cards = 30 + 20 + 40 - 8 + 14 =?  Now, let's calculate the probability that a randomly selected card is of type water. We can do this by dividing the number of cards of type water before James buys any new ones (40) by the total number of cards he has after he buys new ones. Probability of a card being of type water = 40/ Total number of cards = 40/(?). Can you fill in the blank with the correct value for the total number of cards?"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total price of the meal without any discounts or promotions.  To do this, we add up all the extra items that Chad added to his basic burrito:  Carne (2 dollars), Brânză (1 dollar), Avocado (1 dollar), and two sauces (0.25 dollars each) for a total of: 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 9.75 dollars. Next, we add the additional toppings that Chad chose: Chips and a drink, which cost 3 dollars in total. So, the final total before any discounts is: 9.75 + 3 = 12.75 dollars. Now, let's apply the 5-dollar gift card that Chad has. We subtract the amount of the gift card from the total: 12.75 - 5 = 7.75 dollars. Therefore, Chad owes 7.75 dollars for his meal at the ""Fă-te-tu-sute""."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. So, if Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, then her mother can place 2 pieces per minute (since she places half as many). Now, let's calculate how long it will take for them to finish the puzzle together. There are 360 pieces in total, so they need to add/place all of them. We can start with Kalinda's contribution. She can add 4 pieces per minute, so it will take her minutes to add all 360 pieces:. Since her mother can place only 2 pieces per minute, it will take her twice as long to place all the pieces: Therefore, it will take both Kalinda and her mother minutes to complete the puzzle altogether.
Response:  First, we know that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested two months after planting. This means that 30% of 120 = 36 watermelons were ready to be harvested.  Next, we are told that when Ashlyn returned two weeks later, three-quarters of the remaining watermelons were ripe. This means that 75% of (120 - 36) = 84 watermelons were ripe. In total, then, there were 36 + 84 = 120 watermelons that were not yet ripe at the time of Ashlyn's first visit.  Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not yet ripe two weeks later is 120 - 36 = 84.
Response:  First we calculate the total cost of all 12 machines without any discounts or additional fees: 12 x $20,000 = $240,000 Next, we add the 10% tax on the total cost: $240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000 So the total cost with tax is: $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000 Finally, we need to add the additional fee for each machine: 12 x $1,000 = $12,000 Therefore, the grand total that Mark needs to pay is: $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kylie collected more than twice as many shells as Robert on Monday (2 times 20 = 40). Secondly, we know that Kylie collected 5 cartridges less than Robert on Monday (20 - 5 = 15). Therefore, if Kylie collects two times as many shells as she did on Monday, she will collect 2 x 15 = 30 cartridges on Tuesday.
"Response:  First, we know that Dax found half of the number of ants in the garden. If there were x ants in the garden, then Dax found x/2 ants. We also know that Dax collected some meres (a type of beetle) and found 50 of them. So, if we let y be the total number of insects in the garden, we can write an equation based on the information given:  
y = x + 50... (1) Since Dax found half of the ants, we can substitute x/2 for the number of ants he found:  
y = x/2 + 50... (2) Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Can you solve for x and y?"
Response: 1/3 of the penguins swim in the ocean, which means 36 x 1/3 = 12 penguins are swimming in the ocean.  Another 1/3 of the penguins go into the cave to eat dinner, which means 36 x 1/3 = 12 penguins are eating in the cave. That leaves how many penguins still at the beach?  36 - (12 + 12) = 36 - 24 = 12 penguins are still at the beach.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve eats 6 roşii per day and his friend eats 2 roşii per day. So, if Steve eats 6 roşii per day, he needs 6 x 7 = 42 roşii per week. Since each vine can produce 3 roşii per week, Steve would need 42 / 3 = 14 vines to satisfy his daily consumption of roşii.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend should have 4 slices of pizza. Since pizzas are cut into 8 portions, we can start by dividing 20 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs: 20 / 8 = 2  Therefore, John needs to order 2 pizzas.
"Response:  If Ram uses five different styles and each style has enough ink to write for a certain number of pages, then he can use all five styles together to make one full pen worth of writing.  So if he buys 25 pens and uses them up at the same rate as his current pens, he will have written 25 x (number of pages per pen) = 25 x (pages per pen).  To find out how many pens he will have in total, we need to divide the total number of pages he writes with all 25 pens by the number of pages per pen.  Therefore, the total number of pens he will have is:  
25 x (pages per pen) / (pages per pen) = 25.  This means that Ram will have 25 pens in total after using up all 25 of them."
Response:  First, Johnny had $20 and added $10 more, so he had a total of $30. Next, he invested this amount, which tripled in one year. So, after one year, he had $30 x 3 = $90.
"Response:  First, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So if Joan is x years old, Mary is x - 2 years old. Second, we know that Joan is five years older than Jessa. So if Jessa is y years old, Joan is y + 5 years old. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  If Joan is x years old, then Mary is x - 2 years old and Jessa is y years old. The sum of their ages would be:  x + (x - 2) + y =?  Simplifying the equation:  3x - 2 + y =?  Solving for the unknown variable ""y"":  3x - 2 + y = 20  Subtracting 2 from both sides:  3x + y = 18  Dividing both sides by 3:   x + y/3 = 6  Since Jessa is 20 years old, we know that y = 20. Plugging this value into the previous equation:   x + 20/3 = 6  Solving for x:   x = 4  Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:  4 + 20 = 24"
"Response:  Firstly we know that there were initially 1000 students in the classroom and after an event (which is not specified) 30% of them left through entrance A, which means that 300 students left through entrance A. Now we have 700 students remaining in the classroom.  
Now, 3/5 of the remaining 700 students left through entrance B, which means that 210 students left through entrance B (3/5 x 700 = 210). So now we have 490 students remaining in the classroom.  
Finally, all the remaining students left through entrance C, which means that 490 students left through entrance C. Therefore, the number of students who left through entrance C is 490."
"Response:  First, we know that James has 6 more bombones than Robert. So if Robert has x bombones, James has x + 6 bombones.  Second, we know that John has twice as many bombones as Robert. So if Robert has x bombones, John has 2x bombones.  Finally, we know that John has 54 bombones in total. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x + (x + 6) = 54  
Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 6 = 54  
Subtracting 6 from both sides:  
2x = 48  
Dividing both sides by 2:  
x = 24  
So, James has 24 + 6 = 30 bombones, and John has 2 times 24 = 48 bombones."
Response: 1) Dolly reads her own book and Pandora's book. 2) Pandora reads her own book and Dolly's book. 3) Both Dolly and Pandora read their own books and each other's books. In total, they will have read 4 books each (their own + the other's). So, collectively, they will have read 8 books until the end.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mike has five friends with whom he communicates through letters. Secondly, two of his friends have stopped being friends with him. Thirdly, each friend sends two letters per week, and Mike responds in a similar manner. Lastly, Mike can write one page every six minutes. To find out how many hours Mike spends writing per week, let's break down the information given: 1) Number of friends = 5 2) Friends who have stopped being friends = 2 3) Number of letters received per week = 2 x 5 = 10 letters 4) Number of letters written per week = 2 x 5 = 10 letters 5) Time taken to write one page = 6 minutes Now, let's calculate the time spent writing per week: Total number of pages written per week = 10 (letters received) + 10 (letters written) = 20 pages Total time taken to write all pages = 20 pages x 6 minutes/page = 120 minutes or 2 hours Therefore, Mike spends 2 hours writing per week.
Response:  First, we know that Jason has 1000 minutes per month. Second, he makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day, so that's 450 minutes (15 x 30) of calls to his boss. Third, he has 300 minutes of other calls, so that's another 300 minutes. Now let's add up all these minutes: 1000 + 450 + 300 = 1750 minutes. So, in this month with 30 days, Jason has 1750 / 30 = 58.33 minutes per day.
Response:  First, we know that Kyle took 5 of Griffin's fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.  Next, we know that Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries.  So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left after Billy took his share.  Now, we know that Ginger gave Griffin some fries, but we don't know how many. We do know that Colby took three fewer fries than Kyle, so Colby took 3 less than 5 = 2 fries.  Therefore, if Griffin had 27 fries at the end, and he started with 19, then Ginger must have given him 8 fries (27 - 19 = 8).
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many fish in one aquarium as there are in the other. So if we let x be the number of fish in the first aquarium and y be the number of fish in the second aquarium, then we can write an equation based on this information:  
x + 3 = 2(y + 4)  Now we need to solve for x and y. To do this, we can start by using the distributive property to expand the parentheses:  
x + 3 = 2(y + 4) = 2y + 8  Next, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the 8:  
x + 3 - 8 = 2y - 8  This simplifies to:  
x = 2y - 11  Now we have found the value of x, which is equal to 2 times the value of y minus 11. But we also know that x is the number of fish in the first aquarium, so we can substitute y with 4 (since there are 4 fish in the second aquarium):  
x = 2(4) - 11 = 8 - 11 = 7  Therefore, there are 7 fish in the first aquarium. And since we know that there are twice as many fish in the first aquarium as there are in the second aquarium, there must be 2 times 7 = 14 fish in the second aquarium."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much time Jean spent working on the movie: 6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = 800 hours. Next, let's calculate how much he was paid for each hour of work: $250/hour. Now, let's multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly wage: 800 hours x $250/hour = $200,000. Finally, let's subtract the discount given by the makeup artist: $200,000 x 10% = $20,000. So, Jean paid $200,000 - $20,000 = $180,000 for the makeup services.
Response:  First, we know that Isabelle spent $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98 on the party. She divided the cost equally among her two parents, so each parent paid $\frac{98}{3} = 32$ dollars. Therefore, Isabelle paid $32$ dollars.
Response:  First, we know that each package of cabbage costs $1.50. Since the butcher bought four packages, he spent $1.50 x 4 = $6 on cabbage.  Next, we need to find out how much the butcher paid in total for all the ingredients. We are given that one kilogram of cabbage costs $1.50, so if the butcher bought four packages (which is equal to 4 kg), then he paid $1.50 x 4 kg = $6 for cabbage. Therefore, the total amount the butcher paid is $6 + $6 = $12.
"Response:  First, we know that Sue ate more than her sister four times as much as her sister did. So if her sister ate x prăjituri, Sue ate 4x prăjituri.  Second, we know that Sue ate twice as many prăjituri on Monday as she did on Tuesday. So if she ate 2x prăjituri on Monday, she ate 4x - 2x = 2x prăjituri on Tuesday.  Third, we know that Sue's sister ate 5 prăjituri on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. So in total, her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 prăjituri.  Now let's calculate how many calories Sue ate. We know that each prăjitor has 200 calories, so Sue ate:  
2x + (4x - 2x) \* 200 = 2x \* 200 + (4x - 2x) \* 200 
Simplifying this expression gives us:  
2x \* 200 + 4x \* 200 - 2x \* 200 = 6x \* 200 
Therefore, Sue ate 6x * 200 = 1200 calories more than her sister."
