"Response: 
Janet has 16 eggs to sell each day. She cooks and sells three breakfast meals per day with four people at a time. Therefore, she earns $2 x 3 = $6 per day from these meals.
Now, let's calculate how much money she makes from selling fresh eggs in the market every day. Since she has 16 eggs left after cooking and selling breakfast meals, she can sell 16 / 4 = 4 fresh eggs per day. At $2 per egg, she earns $2 x 4 = $8 per day from selling fresh eggs.
So, altogether, Janet earns $6 + $8 = $14 per day from both cooked and fresh eggs."
Response:  We need two blue chips and half as many white chips for each of the three cubes. So, we will need a total of 3 cubes (2 blue + 1 white). Therefore, there are 3 cubes needed in total.
"Response:  Firstly, Josh bought an house for $80,000 and then he invested $50,000 in renovation. After renovation, the value of the house increased by 150%. So, the new value of the house is:
$80,000 x (1 + 150%) = $240,000
Now, let's calculate the profit made by Josh:
Profit = Selling price - Purchase price
= $240,000 - $80,000
= $160,000
So, Josh made a profit of $160,000."
Response:  The first time he ran 3 times 3 = 9 meters. The second time he ran 60 meters. So in total, he ran 9 + 60 = 69 meters.
Response:  If Wendi gives three cups of food to each chicken in the morning and there are 20 chickens in total, then she will give 60 cups of food (3 x 20 = 60). After that, if she feeds them again after lunch, she will give another 75 cups of food (25 x 3 = 75) since there are 20 chickens in total. So, in total, Wendi will give 135 cups of food to the chickens throughout the day (60 + 75 = 135).
"Response:  The price of one bottle is $5 and each subsequent bottle has a discount of 60%. So if Kylar wants to buy 16 bottles, he will pay:

$5 x 16 = $80 (for the first 16 bottles)

Now, let's calculate the total cost for all 16 bottles with the discount:

$80 x 60% = $48 (discounted price for the remaining 12 bottles)

So, the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 bottles would be:

$80 + $48 = $128

Therefore, the answer is $128."
"Response: 
Toulouse has 3 cats and Charleston has 4 cats. So, in total, they have 7 cats (3 + 4 = 7).
Seattle has 20 cats. Therefore, the total number of cats among all three cities is 7 + 20 = 27 cats."
"Response:  The file is being downloaded at a rate of 2 GB per hour, which means it will take approximately 10 hours to download (2 GB / 1 hour = 2 GB / 10 hours). Since Windows takes 20 minutes to update and restart, we can assume that the downloading process takes around 8 hours without any interruptions (10 hours - 20 minutes = 8 hours). Therefore, the amount of data transferred during this time would be:

Data transferred = File size / Download time = 200 GB / 8 hours = 25 GB per hour

So, in total, Carla has transferred approximately 25 GB of data during the 8-hour period."
Response:  The distance covered in 3 hours is 60/3 = 20 miles. Since he stops for lunch and rest for 1 hour, he covers no distance during that time. So, the total distance covered until the end of the fourth hour (which is also the last hour) is 20 + (4 - 1) \* 30 = 20 + 70 = 90 miles. Therefore, at the end of the fourth hour, he is 90 miles away from home.
Response:  If Eliza works for 40 hours at $10 per hour, then she earns $400 in total ($10/hour x 40 hours). Since she also gets an additional $80 as overtime pay (based on the given percentage), her total earnings for this week would be $480 ($400 + $80).
Response:  The total number of downloads in the first month is 60. In the second month, there are 3 times as many downloads as in the first month, so the total number of downloads in the second month is 60 x 3 = 180. In the third month, there are 30 less downloads than in the second month, so the total number of downloads in the third month is 180 - 30 = 150. Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 150 = 490.
"Response: 
Toula bought 3 baskets of cheese for $68 each, so that's $68 x 3 = $194.
She also bought 2 baskets of mini cakes for $80 each, so that's $80 x 2 = $160.
Finally, she bought 6 baskets of mini pepperoni rolls for $55 each, so that's $55 x 6 = $330.
In total, Toula spent $194 + $160 + $330 = $684."
Response:  First year, we will have 7 lemons and sell each one for $1.5, so our revenue is $10.5 (7 x $1.5). Second year, we will have 14 lemons (7 x 2), and sell each one for $1.5 again, so our revenue is $21 (14 x $1.5). Third year, we will have 21 lemons (7 x 3), and sell each one for $1.5 once more, so our revenue is $34.5 ($21 x $1.5). Fourth year, we will have 28 lemons (7 x 4), and sell each one for $1.5 as usual, so our revenue is $42 ($28 x $1.5). Fifth year, we will have 35 lemons (7 x 5), and sell each one for $1.5, so our revenue is $52.5 ($35 x $1.5). Sixth year, we will have 42 lemons (7 x 6), and sell each one for $1.5, so our revenue is $63 ($42 x $1.5). Seventh year, we will have 49 lemons (7 x 7), and sell each one for $1.5, so our revenue is $70.5 ($49 x $1.5). Eighth year, we will have 56 lemons (7 x 8), and sell each one for $1.5, so our revenue is $84 ($56 x $1.5). Nine years later, we will have 63 lemons (7 x 9), and sell each one for $1.5, so our revenue is $94.5 ($63 x $1.5). Tenth year, we will have 70 lemons (7 x 10), and sell each one for $1.5, so our revenue is $105 ($70 x $1.5). Eleventh year, we will have 77 lemons (7 x 11), and sell each one for $1.5, so our revenue is $112.5 ($
Response:  There are three colors of curtains in total - yellow, red and blue. If Melanie has five electric curtains, then she must have two red curtains (since there is only one red color), one yellow curtain (since there is only one yellow color) and two blue curtains (since there are two blue colors). So, the number of curtains that Melanie has is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, there are 20 students in the dance class and they have been learning modern dance for 30% of their time (which is 6 minutes). The remaining 70% of their time has been spent on hip-hop dance. So, the number of minutes each student has spent on hip-hop dance can be calculated as follows: Total time = 6 + (100 - 30) = 90 minutes. Therefore, each student has spent 90/20 = 4.5 minutes on hip-hop dance.
"Response:  If Tüccar chooses to buy $5,000 worth of jewelry and expects the price increase in the jewelry market to be 2.5% per month, then after one month, the value of the jewelry will be:

$5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125

If Tüccar also has the option to buy $8,000 worth of electronics and expects the price increase in the electronics market to be 1.2% per month, then after one month, the value of the electronics will be:

$8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Now, if Tüccar wants to maximize their profit at the end of the month, they should choose the option that has the higher expected value after one month. Based on the above calculations, the expected value of the jewelry after one month is higher than the expected value of the electronics, so Tüccar should choose to buy the jewelry. Therefore, the answer is:

Tüccar should buy $5,000 worth of jewelry."
Response:  The distance between San Rafael and the east is 80 miles. Each train travels at a speed of 60 mph, so it takes them 13 hours to reach the east (80 / 60 = 13). Then they turn around and head west, covering 150 miles in 24 hours (150 / 60 = 24). So, in total, each train covers 283 miles (13 + 24) over two days.
Response:  As Jill works as a teacher for 20 hours per week and an instructor for 30 hours per week, her total work time is 50 hours per week. If she works for 50 weeks in a year, her total work time in a year is 50 x 50 = 2500 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as an instructor, her annual income from teaching and training combined is 2500 hours x ($20/hour) + (30 hours/week x $30/hour) = $48,000 + $9000 = $57,000 per year.
"Response:  If Claire makes 3 omelets per day and she has been doing this for 4 weeks, then...

1 week = 7 days x 3 omelets/day = 21 omelets

So, in total, Claire has made 21 x 4 = 84 omelets in 4 weeks."
Response:  The distance traveled in the first 4 miles is 1 hour, so it's 4/1 = 4 miles per hour. Then, for the next 2 miles, she travels at a rate of 1 mile per hour, so her total speed for those 2 miles is 2 miles / 2 hours = 1 mile per hour. Therefore, to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire trip, she needs to travel at a rate of 3 miles per hour (4 - 1) during the remaining 6 miles of the journey.
Response:  We have 3 liters of juice that is either water or fruit juice (we don't know which). Then we add another 15 liters of juice to make it 18 liters in total. After drinking one liter of juice, there are 17 liters left. So, the remaining amount of juice is 17 liters / 3 = 5.67 liters. Therefore, there are 5.67 liters of juice left after drinking one liter of juice.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Raymon is 23 years old and his sister Samantha is currently 31 years old. So, when Raymon was born, Samantha was 6 years old (31 - 6 =). Therefore, Raymon's brother Samantha was 6 years old 6 years ago (6 x 6 = 36 years ago).
Response:  The first three customers bought one each, so Billy sold 1 x 3 = 3 DVDs. Then, the next two customers bought two each, so Billy sold 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs more. Finally, the last customer did not buy any DVD, so Billy sold no DVDs. Therefore, in total, Billy sold 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs on Saturday.
Response:  The mother is walking at a speed of 2 meters per minute. Therefore, she will cover a distance of 2 x 4 = 8 meters in one hour (60 minutes). So, from 13:00 to 17:00, she will cover a total distance of 8 + 8 = 16 meters longer than before.
Response:  The book was sold for $19.50 with a discount of 25%. So we need to find out what is the original price of the book. We can do this by using the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage). In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25%, so we can plug these values into the formula: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $24.80 Therefore, the original price of the book was $24.80.
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of these items. So, if we divide this amount by the cost per item, we get:

$50 / ($12 x 1 tavuk + $3 x 5 süt + $1.50 x 4 elma + $8.50 x number of pizza kutsun) =?

Now let's substitute the values given in the question:

$50 / ($12 x 1 + $3 x 5 + $1.50 x 4 + $8.50 x number of pizza kutsun) =?

Solving for the number of pizza kutsun (k), we get:

number of pizza kutsun = $50 / ($12 x 1 + $3 x 5 + $1.50 x 4 + $8.50 x k)

Simplifying and solving for k, we get:

k = $50 / ($12 x 1 + $3 x 5 + $1.50 x 4 + $8.50 x k)

Substituting the value of k = 4, we get:

k = $50 / ($12 x 1 + $3 x 5 + $1.50 x 4 + $8.50 x 4) = 4

Therefore, Marie bought 4 pizza kutsun."
Response:  The cost of one shirt is $16.50, and there are three shirts in total. So, the total cost of shirts = $16.50 x 3 = $49.50. Similarly, the cost of each pair of pants is $22.50, and there are also three pairs in total. Therefore, the total cost of pants = $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. Finally, the cost of each pair of shoes is $42, and there are also three pairs in total. Thus, the total cost of shoes = $42 x 3 = $126. So, Mishka spent a total of $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $242.50 on all her clothes.
Response:  The cost of one box is $4 and she buys 15 boxes at once. So, the total cost of one purchase is $4 x 15 = $60. If she buys these boxes every 60 days (which means she makes 2 purchases in that time), then each purchase will have a 30-day interval between them. Therefore, after 60 days, she will make another purchase, which means she will pay for the first batch of boxes again. So, the total amount she pays for both batches is $60 + ($4 x 15) = $90.
Response:  The distance traveled is given as 60 miles and there are two stops. The first stop was after 20 miles, so the total distance traveled until the first stop is 20 + 60 = 80 miles. After the first stop, he continued his journey for another 45 miles (since the second stop was 15 miles away from the end of the journey). Therefore, the total distance traveled including both stops is 80 + 45 = 125 miles.
Response:  If one pair of shoes costs $33 and another pair costs twice as much, then the second pair costs $66. Since there are two pairs of shoes in total, the cost of both pairs together is $33 + $66 = $99. Therefore, the price of each pair of shoes is $99 / 2 = $49.50.
Response:  Darrel and Allen are currently 7 years old, so in 10 years they will be 17 + 7 = 24 years old.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, there are three people who answered the number of balls in the basket. The first person said there were 80 balls, the second person said there were 20 more than half of the total number of balls, and the third person said there were %25 more than the total number of balls. So we have the following equations:

1. Number of balls = 80 (given by the first person)
2. Number of balls + 20 = Total number of balls (given by the second person)
3. Number of balls + 20 / 2 = Total number of balls (given by the third person)

Now let's solve these equations simultaneously:

Number of balls = 80 + 20 = 100

So there are 100 balls in the basket.

The average is 100/3 = 33.33."
Response:  There are 24 hours in a day and each dog spends 8 hours per day running around and doing its job. So, if we divide 24 hours by 8 hours per day, we get 3 days. Therefore, the correct answer is 3 days.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 worthless rocks and 30 more gold mines than silver mines. So, in total, Gretchen has 140 (110 + 30) valuable resources. Therefore, Gretchen has 140 - 50 = 90 valuable resources left after selling 50 of them.
Response:  We know that Aaron has 2 fewer mice than Siobhan. So, if Siobhan has x mice, then Aaron has x - 2 mice. Now we know that Aaron has 5 more mice than Raymond. So, if Raymond has y mice, then Aaron has y + 5 = z mice. Finally, we know that Raymond has 40 mice in total. Therefore, Siobhan has x = 40 - (y + 5) mice.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Mike played table tennis for 40 minutes and scored 8 points in the first 20 minutes (which is 40/2 = 20 minutes). In the remaining time of 20 minutes, he scored 50% more points than in the previous period, which means he scored an additional 16 points (50% of 20 = 10 points). Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored during those 40 minutes is 8 + 16 = 24 points.
Response:  The cost of one liter of yogurt is $4, so the cost of 30 liters would be $120 (30 x $4). However, since Terry buys only 4 liters at a time, he spends $4 x 4 = $16 for each purchase. Therefore, over 30 days, Terry spends a total of $120 + ($16 x 30) = $1860. So, Terry pays $1860 for 30 days of yogurt purchases.
Response:  If John wants to buy all 13 Lego sets and he plans to spend $15 each for them, then he will spend $195 ($15 x 13). And if he also wants to buy 8 video games and they cost $20 each, then he will spend $160 ($20 x 8). So in total, John will spend $355. Therefore, there are 355 Lego sets left after buying them all.
Response:  If he runs for 60 miles in 3 days, that means he runs an average of 20 miles per day (60/3 = 20). Now, if he runs at a speed of x miles per hour, then his time taken to run 1 mile can be calculated as follows: Time = Distance / Speed. So, if he takes 3 hours to run 3 miles, then his speed is: Speed = Distance / Time = 3 miles / 3 hours = 1 mile/hour. Therefore, John runs at a speed of 1 mile per hour.
Response:  If he can run four times faster than usual, then for every hour he runs, he will cover $4 \times 3 = 12$ miles. So in total, if he runs for $\frac{3}{4}$ of an hour, he will cover $\frac{12}{4} = 3$ miles. Therefore, if he runs for $\frac{3}{4}$ of an hour, he will cover $\boxed{3}$ miles.
Response:  If Ben's iPhone is four years older than Brandon's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is two years old, then Brandon's iPhone must be six years old (4 + 2 = 6). So, if Suzy's iPhone is one year old, Brandon's iPhone is seven years old (7 + 1 = 8).
Response:  The distance between Buyuk Ejderha Perg and Farbo Dagini'nin tepeside is 300 meters. If we assume that Polly can throw the golden scoop 400 feet (which is the maximum range of the scoop), then she will be able to reach Ejderhanin Alevleri which is located 100 meters away from the peak. However, if Polly throws the scoop too far, it will land beyond Ejderhanin Alevleri, which is located 200 meters away from the peak. Therefore, the maximum distance that Polly can throw the scoop and hit Ejderhanin Alevleri is 200 meters.
Response:  If Buyuhan had 5 egg tarts and divided them into 8 parts, then each part would contain 0.625 (5/8) of an egg tart. Since he served 5 guests, they received 5 x 0.625 = 3.125 egg tarts each. Now, if 14 guests came in the afternoon, they would receive 14 x 3.125 = 43 egg tarts in total. So, the guests got 43 egg tarts.
"Response:  We know that one medium-sized potato (150g) contains approximately 110 calories. Therefore, if we have 300g of potatoes in total, they contain approximately 330 calories (300g x 110cal/150g). To calculate how many grams of potatoes you can eat based on your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories and your current consumption of 1800 calories, we need to divide the remaining calories by the number of calories per gram of potato. So, the calculation is as follows:
Remaining calories = Daily calorie goal - Current calorie intake = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories
Number of calories per gram of potato = Approximately 110 calories/gram
Grams of potatoes you can eat = Remaining calories / Number of calories per gram of potato = 200 / 110 = 1.8 grams
Therefore, you can eat approximately 1.8 grams of potatoes based on your given information."
Response:  If we sell each mum for $2, then we will get $2 x 20 = $40 from selling all 20 mums. Since it costs $10 to make one mum, and we have to make 20 mums to get $40, we can calculate the cost of making one mum as follows: Cost of making one mum = Total amount earned ($40) / Number of mums sold (20) = $2 per mum. Therefore, the profit made from selling each mum is $2 - $10 = $8.
"Response: 
Meredith spends an average of 4 hours per week writing and publishing articles on his free blog. Last week, he wrote and published 5 articles on Tuesday and 3 articles on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles last week is:
Tuesday (5 articles): 4 hours x 5 articles = 20 hours
Wednesday (3 articles): 4 hours x 3 articles = 12 hours
Total hours spent writing articles last week: 20 + 12 = 32 hours
So, Meredith spent approximately 32 hours writing articles last week."
Response:  If Candice had 80 note cards and distributed them equally among 23 bags of coffee beans, then each bag would contain 80/23 = 3.48 notes. Since we can't have a fraction of a note card, each bag would actually contain 3 note cards. Therefore, there were 23 - 3 = 20 note cards in the package that Candice bought.
Response:  We know that there are more red scarves than blue ones (50% of the total). If we buy $200 worth of red scarves and each one costs $40, then...
Response:  The length of the wire is 4 meters and it has been cut into pieces that are 15 centimeters long each. Therefore, there will be 4 / 0.15 = 26 pieces of wire. So, Tracy has 26 pieces of wire.
Response:  The total number of rooms in the apartment is 15 (given). Each room has 8 units (also given), so there are 15 x 8 = 120 units in total. Since 3/4 of the apartments have been destroyed, we need to subtract that amount from the total number of units. So, the number of remaining rooms is 120 - (3/4) x 120 = 96 rooms.
"Response:  If Lloyd sells each egg for $2 and he sells 252 eggs per day, then his daily income from egg sales is:
$2 x 252 = $504 per day
So, Lloyd earns $504 per day from selling eggs."
"Response:  The speed of the boat is 10 miles per hour in one direction and then it turns around and goes back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to return, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey and add them up.

Time taken for first leg = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 10 mph = 1 hour (60 minutes)
Time taken for second leg = Distance / Speed = 6 miles / 6 mph = 1 hour (60 minutes)
Total time taken = Time taken for first leg + Time taken for second leg = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
Therefore, it will take 2 hours to return."
Response:  If we remove 30 comics from Uriah's collection, he will have 27 less kilograms of weight (30 x 1 kg = 30 kg). So, if we subtract 30 kg from his total weight of 15 kg, we get 12 kg left (15 - 30 = 12 kg). Therefore, after removing 30 comics from his collection, Uriah will have to carry 12 kilos more than before (12 kg / 1 kg = 12).
"Response: 
Tamirci has earned $60 for each of the 6 tires and $40 for each of the 4 cars he has repaired on Friday. Therefore, his total earnings from repairing tires and cars on Friday are:
$60 x 6 = $360 (for tire repairs) + $40 x 4 = $160 (for car repairs) = $520
On Saturday, Tamirci did not repair any tires or cars, so he did not earn anything.
Therefore, the difference in earnings between Friday and Saturday is:
$520 - $0 = $520
So, Tamirci earned $520 more than he did on Friday."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are seven cats (Patches, Trixie, and five others) that were born from the local stray cat mother and then taken home by their owners. Of these, three are male (Patches, Trixie, and one other). Therefore, the number of female cats in the family is four (three females + one male). So, the answer is:

4"
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 marbles and he wants to put them in two bags. If he puts 7 marbles in each bag, then he will have 2 bags with 7 marbles each. So, the total number of marbles Jean can put in the bags is 7 + 7 = 14. Therefore, Jean can fill 14 cantars (or containers) with marbles.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 for each movie ticket and $7 for each bag of popcorn, he will spend a total of $14 per trip to the movies. Since there are 42 dollars available in total, Peter can go to the movies 42/14 = 3 times. Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.
Response:  We have a total weight of 5000 pounds and we want to know how many boxes can be placed on top of each other without exceeding that weight limit. Each box has a weight of 5 kg, so there are 1000 boxes in total (5000 / 5). Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the boxes: 1000 x 5 kg = 5000 kg. Since the total weight of the syringe and empty container is 3755 pounds, we can subtract this amount from the total weight of the boxes to find out how much weight is left for placing more boxes: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 kg. So, the maximum number of boxes that can be placed on top of each other without exceeding the weight limit is 1245 / 5 kg = 249 boxes.
Response:  The total cost of the order is $40 (the original price). Then, there is a discount of 25% on the total cost, which means that the amount paid by Stephen is $30 ($40 x 25%). Additionally, he gave an extra $4 as a tip. So, the final price that Stephen pays for his food is $34 ($30 + $4).
Response:  We have 6 fruits in each of the 6 baskets (total = 36). Then we have 67 different types of fruit in total. So, there are 67/36 = 1.8571428571428571429...baskets of fruits. Therefore, there are approximately 1.86 baskets of fruits.
Response:  We have 25 portakals in total and 1 of them is spoiled (%20). So, we have 24 good portakals left. Now, there are 2 Ekşis among these good portakals, so we can subtract their weight from the total weight of the good portakals. The remaining weight after subtraction is 24 x 90 = 2160 grams. Therefore, 2160 grams of portakals are good.
Response:  Firstly, $500 is spent for making the product and $800 is spent for the jewelry designer. So far, they have spent a total of $1300. Then, $10% of that amount is deducted as insurance, which is $130. Therefore, the remaining amount is $1170.
"Response:  If Marcy works for 40 years at $50,000 per year, her total earnings would be:

$50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000

After 20 years of service, she will receive a 5% raise, which means her new annual salary would be:

$50,000 + (5% of $2,000,000) = $52,500

So, after 20 years of service, her total earnings would be:

$2,000,000 + ($52,500 x 10 = $525,000

If she retires after 30 years of service, her final annual pension would be:

$525,000 / 30 = $17,500

Therefore, Marcy's final annual pension after 30 years of service would be $17,500."
"Response: 
Aleena paid $140 for an annual subscription to a streaming service in January. If the company gave her the first installment of $50 in January and then reduced the amount by 10% every month thereafter, what was the total amount she paid throughout the year?
Let's break it down:
January: $50 (first installment) + $40 (10% reduction) = $90
February: $90 - $4.50 (10% reduction) = $85.50
March: $85.50 - $7.36 (10% reduction) = $78.14
April: $78.14 - $6.52 (10% reduction) = $71.62
May: $71.62 - $5.79 (10% reduction) = $65.83
June: $65.83 - $4.99 (10% reduction) = $60.84
July: $60.84 - $5.27 (10% reduction) = $55.57
August: $55.57 - $4.39 (10% reduction) = $51.18
September: $51.18 - $3.63 (10% reduction) = $47.55
October: $47.55 - $3.07 (10% reduction) = $44.48
November: $44.48 - $2.63 (10% reduction) = $41.85
December: $41.85 - $1.95 (10% reduction) = $39.89
Total amount paid throughout the year: $39.89 + $50 (first installment) = $89.89
Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year is $89.89."
"Response:  The car can travel 100 miles with one full tank of gasoline (which contains 30 gallons). To find out how many kilometers the car can travel with one tank of gasoline, we need to convert miles to kilometers. There are 1.60934 kilometers in one mile, so:

100 miles x 1.60934 km/mile = 160.934 kilometers
Now, let's see what the car's manual says about the capacity of its tank. According to the manual, the tank holds 12 gallons of gasoline. Since there are 4.5 liters in each gallon, we can calculate the total volume of gasoline in the tank as follows:

12 gallons x 4.5 liters/gallon = 54 liters
So, the car can travel 160.934 kilometers with one tank of gasoline that contains 54 liters of fuel. Therefore, the answer is:

Sophia can travel approximately 3.07 kilometers per liter of gasoline."
"Response:  If Jim watches television for x hours per day and then decides to read books for y minutes per day, we can write an equation as follows:

x + y = 21 (since he watches television for 3 hours per day)

Now, let's find out how many days it takes for Jim to read 4 hours of books per day:

y = 4 / 3 (since he reads books for half the time he spends watching television)

So, Jim reads books for 20 minutes per day (y = 20).

Therefore, the answer is:

Jim watches television for 3 hours per day and reads books for 20 minutes per day."
Response:  Each school has a boy and girl basketball team with 5 players each, so there are in total 10 players (2 x 5) from each school. Since each school sent one dog to the competition, we have 4 dogs (10 x 0.4). Therefore, the total number of people who participated in the competition is 4 + 10 = 14.
"Response:  We know that there are 175 marbles in total and out of them, 35 are yellow and 20 more than half of the remaining marbles are red. So, the number of red marbles is:

Red Marbles = (Remaining Marbles / 2) + Yellow Marbles
= (140 / 2) + 35
= 60 + 35
= 95

Now we have to find out how many stones are in the box. According to the problem statement, if there are no red marbles, then there must be an odd number of stones in the box. Since there are 95 marbles, there must be either 95 or 97 stones in the box. Therefore, the answer is 95 stones."
Response:  We know that there are 2 boys and 4 girls in Dr. Wertz's classroom. So, the total number of students is 2 + 4 = 6. Now, we have 6 teachers for 6 students, so each teacher has 1 student. Therefore, there is one teacher in Dr. Wertz's classroom.
Response:  Bailey will start with $0 and earn $5 per week for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, he will have earned a total of $40 ($5 x 8). If there is a total of $100 at stake, then Bailey's starting balance must be $60 ($100 - $40).
"Response: 
Judy teaches dance classes for 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), with each class lasting 1 hour. Therefore, she teaches a total of 5 x 60 = 300 minutes of dance classes per week.
Since there are 7 days in a week, and Judy teaches dance classes for only 5 days, we can calculate the number of hours she spends teaching dance classes per day as follows:
300 minutes/week / 5 days/week = 60 minutes/day
Now, let's assume that each student pays $15 per class. Since Judy teaches 8 classes per week, we can calculate the total amount of money she earns from teaching dance classes per week as follows:
8 classes/week x $15/class = $120 per week
Therefore, Judy earns $120 per week from teaching dance classes."
Response:  According to the question, there are two recipes for cooking food, one of which contains 20 steps and the other contains fewer than that number of steps. Therefore, we can conclude that Kelian needs to read at least 20 talimat (steps) in order to prepare both dishes.
"Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each slice of cheesecake for $4, then he will earn total revenue from brownies as follows:

Tommy sold 43 brownies, so his total revenue from brownies is:
$3 x 43 = $132
Similarly, he earned total revenue from cheesecakes as follows:
He sold 23 slices of cheesecake, so his total revenue from cheesecakes is:
$4 x 23 = $92
Therefore, Tommy earned a total of $132 + $92 = $224 in revenue."
Response:  The total cost of three years is $150 x 3 = $450. Since each unit has a profit margin of 20%, we can calculate the price per unit as follows: $450 / (1 - 0.20) = $562.50. Therefore, Sheila will have to pay $562.50 for each of the five phones over three years.
"Response: 
Artie sells 3 types of flowers in the market: roses, carnations, and chrysanthemums. Generally, he charges $2.74 for a bunch of roses, $1.87 for a bunch of carnations, and $2.12 for a bunch of chrysanthemums. Since Artie has no debt today, he decides to round up all prices to the nearest dollar. So, the new prices are:
$2 for a bunch of roses, $1 for a bunch of carnations, and $2 for a bunch of chrysanthemums.
Now, let's calculate how much Artie can earn from each type of flower:
Roses: 12 bunches x $2 = $24
Carnations: 9 bunches x $1 = $9
Chrysanthemums: 17 bunches x $2 = $34
So, Artie can earn a total of $67 from these three types of flowers."
Response:  The volume of the cube is given as $V = (16 \times 10^2)^3 = 256000 cubic meters$. Now, we are asked to find out how much space each layer takes up. So, let's assume that there are $N$ layers and each layer has a height of $h$. Then, the volume of each layer is given by $V_i = Nh$. Therefore, the total volume of all the layers is $\sum_{i=1}^N V_i = \sum_{i=1}^N Nh$. Since there are $4$ layers in total, we can write $\sum_{i=1}^4 V_i = 4\times Nh$. Substituting this value into the equation for $V$, we get $V = 4\times Nh \times (16 \times 10^2)^3 = 4\times Nh \times 256000$. Therefore, the average volume per layer is $AV = \frac{4}{N} \times h$.
Response:  The first 180 days, Cecilia needs to feed her new puppy 1 bottle of milk per day, which is equal to 180 bottles in total. After that period, she will need to feed it 2 bottles of milk per day, for an additional 365 days (since there are 365 days in a year). Therefore, the total number of bottles of milk Cecilia will use during the entire first year is: 180 + 365 = 545 bottles.
Response:  If Raymonde takes half of Sarah's weight and gives it to David, then Sarah will have 200 pounds less than her original weight (since she had 800 pounds). So, Sarah's new weight is 600 pounds. Now, if Sarah loses 400 pounds, then her final weight is 200 pounds. Therefore, the difference between Raymond, Sarah, and David's weights is 200 - 160 = 40 pounds.
Response:  If we buy 3 packages of Vincent cigarettes at $2.50 each, it will cost us $7.50 (3 x $2.50). And if we buy 2 packages at $1 each, it will cost us $2 (2 x $1). So in total, we can save up to $5.50 ($7.50 - $2) by buying more packages. Therefore, if we buy 18 packets of Vincent cigarettes, we can get $5.50 worth of discount.
Response:  The dog is worth $100 and the person offers a discount of 30%. So, the price after discount would be: $100 x (1 - 0.30) = $70.
Response:  The two girls shared 24 liters of water equally among themselves, so each girl got 24 / 2 = 12 liters of water. Then, the boy took 6 liters of water from them, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 liters of water left with the two girls. So, there are 6 liters of water remaining after the boy took some.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie had 10 boxes of chocolates and he gave 9 of them to his sister. So, now Charlie has 1 box of chocolate left. Then, in the shopping mall, Charlie bought 21 boxes of chocolates and he also got 23 boxes from his birthday gift. So, Charlie has a total of 44 boxes of chocolates with him now. Finally, he distributed 28 boxes among himself and his friends, so he is left with 6 boxes of chocolates (44 - 28 = 6). Therefore, Charlie has 6 boxes of chocolates left.
Response:  The total weight of Grace is 40 kg and Alex has 4 times more weight than Grace which means he has 4 x 40 = 160 kg. So, the total weight of both of them together is 40 + 160 = 200 kg.
Response:  We have three gul calis (Dan). Each gul cali has 25 guls inside it. So, we have 3 x 25 = 75 guls in total. Now, each gul has 8 dikens. Therefore, the total number of dikens is 75 x 8 = 600 dikens.

So, there are 92 blocks in total."
"Response: 
Greg heard the alarm three times a day for one week. So he heard it totally 21 times (3 x 7).
On the first day, he heard it four times longer than usual. So he heard it for 4 x 3 = 12 minutes more than usual.
On the second day, he heard it three times longer than usual. So he heard it for 3 x 3 = 9 minutes more than usual.
On the third day, he heard it two times longer than usual. So he heard it for 2 x 3 = 6 minutes more than usual.
Therefore, in total, Greg heard the alarm 21 - 12 - 9 - 6 = 14 times longer than usual."
"Response:  The company pays each employee $600 per month. If the policy is to increase the starting salary by 10% every year for five years, then the starting salary after five years will be:

Year 1: Starting salary = $600 x (1 + 10%) = $660
Year 2: Starting salary = $660 x (1 + 10%) = $732
Year 3: Starting salary = $732 x (1 + 10%) = $804
Year 4: Starting salary = $804 x (1 + 10%) = $886
Year 5: Starting salary = $886 x (1 + 10%) = $970

So, after five years, the starting salary will be $970."
Response:  If Marilyn's album sold 10 times more than Harald's album, then Harald's album sold x copies. Since Marilyn sold 88 billion copies, we can set up the equation: x = 88 / 10 = 880 million copies. Therefore, Harald sold 880 million - 88 billion = 792 million copies.
Response:  We have to calculate how much each guest will receive and then multiply it with the number of guests attending the party. So, let's start by calculating how many hedies each guest will get: $75 / 16 = $4.38 per person. Now we know that there are 75 hedies in total, so multiplying it by the number of guests attending the party gives us the total amount needed: $4.38 x 16 = $69.12. Therefore, the host needs $69.12 to buy 75 hedies for their 16 guests.
"Response:  If there are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 children attending the picnic, each adult will eat approximately 10 kg of potato salad (based on the information given in the question). Therefore, the total amount of potato salad required for all the attendees is:

20 adults x 10 kg = 200 kg

Now, let's consider the children. Each child will eat approximately half as much as an adult, so they will require:

5 children x 5 kg = 25 kg

Therefore, the total amount of potato salad required for the entire group is:

200 kg + 25 kg = 225 kg

So, Ted needs to prepare around 225 kg of potato salad for the picnic."
Response:  We know that Jan has three dogs and Marcia has two more than Jan. So, Marcia has 3 + 2 = 5 dogs. Now we are told that Cindy has two fewer dogs than Marcia. Therefore, Cindy has 5 - 2 = 3 dogs. Finally, if Cindy had four dogs, then there would be 4 + 1 = 5 dogs in total. Since this is not the case, we can conclude that there are only 3 dogs in total.
"Response:  We know that Amy has 4 children and their ages are as follows:
Amy - 30 years old (given)
Jackson - 10 years old + 5 years older than Amy = 15 years old
James - 10 years old (given)
Corey - 8 years old + 2 years younger than Jackson = 6 years old
So, Jackson is 15 years old and Corey is 6 years old."
Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds without any changes to his diet, then he is running at a speed of $ \boxed{5.76 m/s} $. Now, if Gerald increases his speed by $ \boxed{10\%} $, then he will be able to run 400 meters in $ \boxed{35.24 s} $. Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters in $\boxed{35.24 s} $ with his modified diet.
"Response:  According to the statement, there are 12 less animals in the neighborhood than cats and dogs combined. So, if there are x cats and y dogs, we can write an equation as follows:
x + y = 12 (less animals)
We know that each cat has two kittens, so the number of kittens is twice the number of cats:
x = 2y (number of kittens per cat)
Now, let's substitute these equations into the first one:
2y + y = 12 (total animals)
Combine like terms:
3y = 12 (total animals)
Divide both sides by 3:
y = 4 (total animals)
Now, we know that each dog has five puppies, so the number of puppies is five times the number of dogs:
y = 5x (number of puppies per dog)
Substitute this equation into the second one:
2y + y = 12 (total animals)
Combine like terms:
3(5x) + x = 12 (total animals)
Simplify:
15x + 3 = 12 (total animals)
Subtract 3 from both sides:
15x = 9 (total animals)
Divide both sides by 15:
x = 9/15 (cats)
So, there are 9 cats in the neighborhood. Now, we know that each cat has two kittens, so there are also 9 kittens:
x = 9 (cats)
y = 4 (dogs)
Therefore, there are 9 cats, 4 dogs, and 9 kittens in the neighborhood."
Response:  There are 5 students in total and 4 of them are girls (including the girl who is not in the basketball team). So, there is only one boy left. Therefore, there is only one girl who is not in the basketball team. Hence, the correct answer is 1.
"Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James only slept for 2/3 of that time (i.e., 6 hours), then we can calculate how many more hours Harry slept than James as follows:

Harry slept for 9 hours - James slept for 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept for 3 more hours than James."
Response:  We know that Freda has 50 grams of diced tomatoes in each of the three containers. Since she used all of them to make the sauce, we can say that she used 150 grams (3 x 50) of diced tomatoes for making the sauce. Now, since the remaining amount of sauce is 32 ounces and it takes 3 cups of diced tomatoes to make one cup of sauce, we can calculate the number of cups of diced tomatoes Freda used as follows: Number of cups = Amount of sauce / Amount of diced tomatoes per cup = 32 oz / 3 cups/container = 10.67 cups So, Freda used approximately 11 cups of diced tomatoes to make the sauce.
"Response:  The first 15 minutes have 15 cars passing through, and then there are 20 cars passing through in the remaining 15 minutes (for a total of 35 cars). Since 5 cars escape from traffic congestion during this time, the number of cars that passed through the intersection in the given time is:

35 - 5 = 30
Therefore, 30 cars passed through the intersection within the given time frame."
"Response:  We know that Mary has 18 new animals to take care of tomorrow and there are already 2 animals in each of the 40 windows of the big mansion. So, the total number of animals she will have to take care of is:

18 + (40 x 2) = 18 + 80 = 98

Therefore, Mary will have to take care of 98 animals tomorrow."
"Response: 
Jerome opened the door 20 times before his friends arrived. So, the first friend (Jerome's brother) opened the door 20 + 1 = 21 times.
The second friend opened the door 21 / 4 = 5.25 times more than Jerome's brother.
So, the second friend opened the door 5.25 x 4 = 21 times.
The third friend opened the door 3 x 10 = 30 times more than the second friend.
So, the third friend opened the door 21 x 3 = 63 times.
Finally, the fourth friend opened the door 60 - 63 = -3 times less than the third friend.
Therefore, the fourth friend opened the door 60 x (-3) = -180 times."
"Response: 
Solo read 15 pages from the Biology textbook, 20 pages from the Social Work textbook, 7 pages from the History textbook, and 8 pages from the Geography textbook.
If he reads an average of 4 pages per day for the next 4 days, how many pages will he have read in total?
Let's calculate it as follows:
Day 1: 4 pages/day x 1 day = 4 pages
Day 2: 4 pages/day x 2 days = 8 pages
Day 3: 4 pages/day x 3 days = 12 pages
Day 4: 4 pages/day x 4 days = 16 pages
Total pages read = 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 = 40 pages
Therefore, Solo will have read 40 pages in total if he continues to read at an average rate of 4 pages per day for the next 4 days."
Response:  According to the information given in the question, John drinks one cup of coffee every morning (kahvaltı), then he eats lunch and drinks another cup of coffee (öğle yemeği). Finally, he drinks another cup of coffee before going to bed (akşam yemeği). So, in total, John drinks 3 cups of coffee per week.
Response:  The distance from one side of the city to the other is 42 miles (67.5 km). If it takes 10 minutes to travel each mile, then it will take 420 minutes or 7 hours and 20 minutes to travel the entire length of the city. So, the snake can cover the entire city in 7 hours and 20 minutes.
"Response:  We have 1000 parts to arrange in a square shape. If we divide them into four rows of 250 parts each, then we will have:

Row 1: 250 parts
Row 2: 250 parts
Row 3: 250 parts
Row 4: 250 parts

Now, let's assume that Anna has already arranged 300 parts in the square shape. So, there are remaining 700 parts left. To find out how many parts can be placed in each row, we need to divide the remaining parts by the number of rows. Here is the calculation:

Row 1: Remaining parts / Number of rows = 700 / 4 = 175 parts
Row 2: Remaining parts / Number of rows = 700 / 4 = 175 parts
Row 3: Remaining parts / Number of rows = 700 / 4 = 175 parts
Row 4: Remaining parts / Number of rows = 700 / 4 = 175 parts

Therefore, we can place 175 parts in each row. Since there are 4 rows, we can place a total of 700 parts in the square shape."
Response:  If Cody eats three times as much food as Amir, and Amir eats 5 pieces of food, then Cody will eat 3 x 5 = 15 pieces of food. So, together they will eat 15 + 5 = 20 pieces of food.
"Response:  The radius of each circle is given as follows:

Circle 1: Radius = 5 inches = 0.05 feet (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)
Circle 2: Radius = 6 inches = 0.06 feet (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)
Circle 3: Radius = 4 inches = 0.04 feet (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)
Now, we need to find the area of each circle using the formula: Area = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.
For Circle 1: Area = π(0.05)^2 = 0.007854 square feet
For Circle 2: Area = π(0.06)^2 = 0.019444 square feet
For Circle 3: Area = π(0.04)^2 = 0.005769 square feet
Finally, we add up the areas of all three circles to get the total area: Total Area = 0.007854 + 0.019444 + 0.005769 = 0.032977 square feet
So, the total area of all three circles is approximately 0.032977 square feet."
"Response:  On Monday (Çarşamba), Frankie watched 30 minutes of a program and then another 30-minute program later in the day. Therefore, he watched a total of 60 minutes of television that day. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, then we can calculate the number of minutes he watched each day as follows:

Total minutes = Number of days x Total hours / Number of minutes per hour
= 7 h × 60 min/h / 60 min
= 420 min
So, Frankie watched 420 minutes of TV in total."
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Henry made 130 Kurabies last year (2 times more than the previous year). If he had 110 Kurabies now, that means he made 20 extra Kurabies this year. Therefore, Henry made 130 + 20 = 150 Kurabies last year.
Response:  If we buy 10 gallons of gasoline at $3 per gallon, then we pay $30 for that amount (10 x $3 = $30). Now, if we fill up our tank with 10 gallons and get a discount of $20, then the net cost of filling up our tank would be $10 ($30 - $20 = $10). So, after filling up our tank, we have $20 left as change.
Response:  If they have to eat all the fruits together, then each of them will get half of the total amount (since there are two of them). So, if the total amount is x, then each person will get x/2. Now, let's consider what happens when one of them makes a mistake and eats more than their share. Suppose Beatrice eats 2 extra fruits, so she has eaten x/2 + 2 = x/2 + 2 units. Now, Marcell also gets his share, which is x/2 - 3 units. Since he already had 3 units, now he has a total of x/2 - 5 = x/2 - 5 units. Therefore, the final amount that Marcell has left is x/2 - 5 units.
"Response:  The distance traveled by the boat is given as $64$ meters. Since every $20$ meters, the boat consumes $2$ liters of water, we can write an equation:

$$\text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Consumption}}{(\text{Speed} \times \text{Time})}$$

where $\text{distance}$ is the distance traveled, $\text{consumption}$ is the amount of water consumed, $\text{speed}$ is the speed at which the boat travels ($20$ meters per minute), and $\text{time}$ is the time taken to travel that distance ($1$ minute).

Now, we know that the boat takes $64$ seconds to reach the shore, so the time taken to travel $64$ meters is:

$$\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{(\text{Speed} \times \text{Time})} = \frac{64}{20} = 3.2$$

Therefore, the amount of water consumed by the boat is:

$$\text{Consumption} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{(\text{Speed} \times \text{Time})} = \frac{64}{20} = 3.2$$

So, Julia had $3.2$ liters of water in her tank when she reached the shore."
Response:  If there are 4 teachers and each teacher gives 2 lessons per day, then in total, there will be 8 lessons given per day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons/day). Now, if the whiteboard is shared among these 4 teachers, it means that each teacher uses the board 2 times per day (since they give 2 lessons each). Therefore, the number of times the whiteboard is used in a day is 8 (total lessons) / 4 (number of teachers using the board) = 2 times per day. Since each teacher uses the board 2 times per day, the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a week is 7 days x 2 times/day = 14 times per week. And since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times a day, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a week is 14 times/week x 3 times/day = 42 times per week.
Response:  If Ryan plants two flowers per day and there are already 5 flowers after 15 days, then he has planted a total of 2 x 15 = 30 flowers in those 15 days. So, at this point, there are 5 + 30 = 35 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that Jamal has 1800 photos in his phone and each photo can hold up to 100 images. So, the total number of images in Jamal's phone is 1800 x 100 = 180,000 images. Now, we are told that Brittany's phone can hold only 6 times more than Jamal's phone, which means it can hold 180,000 x 6 = 1,080,000 images. However, as per the problem statement, Jamal's phone can store 50 times more images than the maximum number of images that Brittany's phone can hold, which is 1,080,000 x 50 = 54,000,000 images. Therefore, if Jamal's phone stores 1800 photos of birds in his backyard, he will be able to see 54,000,000 / 1800 = approximately 30,000 birds in his backyard.
"Response:  We have 4 types of puzzles with different prices as follows:
Type 1 (price = $10): 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 pieces
Type 2 (price = $16): 5 x 4 x 10 = 200 pieces
Total number of puzzles = 80 + 200 = 280 pieces
So, if we sell all these puzzles, we will make a profit of $280 - ($10 x 80) = $280 - $800 = -$520."
Response:  If we use 7:13 ratio to fill up 120 tea cups with sugar and water, we need to fill 85 tea cups with sugar and water. So, if you filled 120 tea cups with sugar and water using this ratio, you would have used approximately 94 teaspoons of sugar (since there are 85 tea cups filled with sugar and water).
Response:  The three children are buying two pairs of shoes each. So, in total, they will buy 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $60, so the total cost is 6 x $60 = $360. Therefore, the answer is $360.
"Response: 
On day 1, there were 5 containers with 2 cars each, so total number of cars was 10 (5 x 2 = 10).
On the next day, more containers arrived and the total number of cars increased to 30 (10 + 20 = 30).
So, the increase in number of cars from day 1 to day 2 is 20 (30 - 10 = 20)."
"Response: 
Adrien's income is $40,000 more than Lylah's income after 4 years. So, if their incomes are equal at first, then Adrien's income will be $120,000 (40,000 x 3) higher than Lylah's income after 4 years. Therefore, the ratio of Adrien's income to Lylah's income after 4 years is 3:2 or 60%."
Response:  Miguel uses two sheets of paper for each week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So he uses 104 sheets of paper (2 x 52) per year. If there are 30 sheets of paper on each sheet, then Miguel uses 3680 sheets of paper (30 x 104) per year.
Response:  Morisette gave 5 apples and 8 pears to Kael. So, in total, there are 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
"Response: 
Sadie slept for 8 hours yesterday. For the next two days, she slept for 2 hours less than yesterday, so she slept for 6 hours each day. In total, she slept for 14 hours (8 + 6 + 6). If she had more than one hour of extra sleep in the remaining time of the week, then the total amount of sleep she got that week is 15 hours (14 + 1). Therefore, the answer is 15 hours."
"Response:  Rosie can walk at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. Therefore, she has walked a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles in this time period. Then, she starts running at a speed of 8 kilometers per hour. To find out how far she can run in 7 hours, we need to convert the speed from kilometers per hour to miles per hour. There are 1.60934 kilometers in one mile, so:

8 km/h × (1 mi / 1.60934 km) = 5 miles/hour

Now, Rosie can run for 7 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour. Therefore, she can cover a total distance of 7 x 5 = 35 miles during these 7 hours."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jennie has written 60 letters and needs to write another one. So, there are 61 letters in total that she needs to write. Now, if we assume that the three letters that Jennie wrote earlier are already included in the 61 letters, then the remaining number of letters for her to write is 61 - 3 = 58. Therefore, there are 58 letters left for Jennie to write after she started writing.
Response:  Firstly, Julia bought one pack of plastic cups which contained 4 cups. Later, her husband gave her 5 more packs of plastic cups, so she had a total of 9 packs (4 + 5 = 9). Since each pack contains 4 cups, Julia had a total of 36 cups (9 x 4 = 36). Therefore, Julia had 36 plastic cups in total.
Response:  According to the question, Dylan has collected 38 tanks of chicken soup and 6 tanks of fish soup. So he has collected in total 38 + 6 = 44 tanks of soup.
Response:  If Amy had 30 friends before moving to her new school and she gained 20 more friends after moving there, then she has 50 friends in total now (including both old and new friends). Since Lily already has 50 friends, we can deduce that Lily and Amy together have 100 friends (Lily + Amy = 100). So, the number of friends they share is 50.
"Response: 
Dillon has ordered 4 karpuses, 20 biber and 10 portakals from the store. Since each karpuz costs $3 more than a biber, we can say that one karpuz costs $3 + $15 = $18. Similarly, since each portakal costs $5 more than a biber, we can say that one portakal costs $5 + $15 = $20. Therefore, the total cost of all the items Dillon has ordered is:
$18 x 4 = $72 for karpuz
$15 x 20 = $300 for biber
$20 x 10 = $200 for portakal
So, in total, Dillon will have to pay $72 + $300 + $200 = $692 to the store."
Response:  The number of visitors per day is 500 people and each visitor spends an average of 24 minutes in the hospital. Therefore, the total time spent in the hospital per day is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. Now, let's calculate how much doctors earn from these visits. Since there are 8 hours in a day, the number of doctor visits per hour is 12,000 / 8 = 1500 visits per hour. So, doctors earn $150 per hour. Finally, since there are 24 hours in a day, the total amount earned by doctors per day is 1500 x 24 = $36,000.
Response:  We know that 60 elves are sent to Noel Baba village and they work for 3 months. In one month, each elf can make 20 children happy (since there are 20 children in each family). So, in total, 60 elves can make 60 x 20 = 1200 children happy during their 3-month stay. Now, let's calculate how many elves are left after 10 children start pulling their ears. Since each child pulls the ear of only 1 elf, we have 10 x 1 = 10 elves who are pulled. Therefore, out of the initial 60 elves, 50 elves (60 - 10) remain after 10 children start pulling their ears.
Response:  In May, Joe spent $500 for his car repairs. In June, he spent $60 less than in May, which is $440 ($500 - $60). So, the total amount of money Joe spent on car repairs over these two months is $940 ($500 + $440).
"Response: 
Pam rode the rollercoaster twice and Fred four times. After that, one of them decided to buy two tickets for the Ferris wheel. If they paid $6 per ticket, how many tickets did they buy in total?

Total number of tickets = Number of rides x Price per ride
= 2 + 4 + 2 (since one person bought 2 tickets)
= 8

Therefore, they bought 8 tickets in total."
Response:  We know that Walt ran 4 miles on Pazartesi (Tuesday). On Wednesday (Salı), he ran 6 times more than Tuesday, which is 24 miles. So, in total, Walt ran 4 + 24 = 28 miles from Tuesday to Wednesday. Therefore, Çarşamba (Thursday) ran 28 - 3 = 25 miles.
Response:  If Tom has 4 cars and each car costs $15 to wash, then he spends $60 per year ($15 x 4) on washing his cars. Therefore, the answer is $60.
Response:  If Brian has 20 video game and he lost 5 of them, then he has 15 left. Now, if Bobby has 3 times more than Brian, that means Bobby has 45 video games (3 x 15 = 45). So, Bobby has 45 - 15 = 30 video games left after Brian lost 5 of his.
Response:  There are 27 teeth in total and three of them belong to Scotland. Two of these teeth have cavities. Therefore, there are 24 healthy teeth left. So, there are 24/3 = 8 healthy Scottish teeth.
Response:  The total cost of the order is $7.5 + $1.5 + $1 = $9.5. Since there is a discount of 20%, the actual price paid by the customer will be $9.5 x (1 - 0.20) = $7.6. So, the customer pays $7.6 for the entire order.
"Response: 
Mark took 75 questions in his first test and answered 5 of them correctly, which means he got 5/75 = 0.07% correct.
Now, let's assume that Mark took 100 questions in his second test today. If he answered 5 questions correctly again, then we can calculate the percentage of correct answers as follows: (5/100) x 100 = 0.05%.
So, there are 45 incorrect questions (100 - 5)."
Response:  If there are 22 sugar cubes in total and each jar has 4 times as many sugar cubes as the previous one, then... (1) There will be 88 sugar cubes in the first jar. (2) The second jar will have 352 sugar cubes. (3) The third jar will have 1408 sugar cubes. (4) The fourth jar will have 5760 sugar cubes. Now, if there are 12 blue sugar cubes in total, then... (5) The first jar will have 12/88 = 1/7 of the total number of blue sugar cubes. (6) The second jar will have 352/1408 = 1/4 of the total number of blue sugar cubes. (7) The third jar will have 1408/5760 = 1/4 of the total number of blue sugar cubes. Therefore, there are 4 blue sugar cubes in each of the last three jars. So, there are 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 blue sugar cubes in total.
Response:  The number of automatic transmissions is 8 (20 - 12). And the number of manual transmissions is 4. So, the percentage of automatic transmissions is 8/20 x 100 = 40%.
Response:  We have 700 eggs and we know that each egg contains two chicks (yavru). So, there are 1400 chicks in total (2 x 700 = 1400). Now, we also know that every chick gives birth to two kings (kraliçler) when it grows up. Therefore, the number of kings is twice the number of chicks, which means 2800 kings (2 x 1400 = 2800). Finally, we subtract the number of kings from the total number of eggs to find out how many workers (işçi) are left. In this case, there are 320 workers (700 - 2800 = 320).
Response:  Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day and earns $10 per hour. If he stops working for a week, he will lose $70 ($10 x 7 days). So, in one week, Jordan can save $70 if he doesn't work during that time. Therefore, in one month (4 weeks), Jordan can save $280 ($70 x 4 weeks).
"Response: 
John has bought the following items:
* Süt (milk): 2 liters = 2 x 0.5 kg = 1 kg
* Yumurtalar (eggs): 3 eggs x 0.1 kg = 0.3 kg
* Ampuller (bottles): 3 bottles x 0.05 kg = 0.15 kg
* Bardaklar (jars): 3 jars x 0.03 kg = 0.09 kg
* Hamamböceği tuzağı (ham and cheese rolls): 4 rolls x 0.06 kg = 0.24 kg
Total weight of all items = 1 + 0.3 + 0.15 + 0.09 + 0.24 = 3.8 kg
If there is a 10% discount for food products, then the total cost of these items would be:
Cost = Total weight x Discount percentage
= 3.8 kg x 10%
= 0.38 kg
So, the cost of these items with a 10% discount would be approximately 0.38 kg or 780 grams."
"Response: 
Kim has just started working and wants to calculate how much money she will make per week based on the number of customers she expects to have. She assumes that each customer will buy an average of 2 bags of cleaning products (worth $20 each) and 1 bag of laundry detergent (worth $5 each). Based on this assumption, she estimates that she will earn a total of $92 per week ($2 x 2 bags + $5 x 1 bag = $92). However, she also knows that there are potential customers who may not buy anything, so she deducts $46 from her estimated income ($92 - $46 = $46). Therefore, Kim expects to earn $46 per week in profit."
Response:  If there are 10 hectares of land and each hectare has 100 apples, then the total number of apples is 100 x 10 = 1000 apples. Since John can harvest them every 3 months, he will have 4 harvests per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year). So, John can harvest 4 x 1000 = 4000 apples per year. Therefore, John can harvest 4000 apples per year.
"Response:  If there are 500 Lego pieces in total and Johnny has placed them randomly on the ground, then we can assume that each piece is equally distributed among all possible positions. Therefore, if we divide 500 into 8 equal parts (since there are 8 possible positions for each piece), we get:

Position 1: 62.5 pieces (62.5% of 500)
Position 2: 62.5 pieces (62.5% of 500)
...
Position 8: 62.5 pieces (62.5% of 500)

Now, let's consider the second part of the question: one of the groups contains 3 times as many pieces as the others, while another group contains only half as many pieces as the others. This means that the number of pieces in each position will be different depending on which group it belongs to. For example:

Group with 3 times as many pieces: Position 1: 195 pieces (195% of 62.5%)
Position 2: 195 pieces (195% of 62.5%)
...
Position 8: 195 pieces (195% of 62.5%)

And finally, let's look at the last part of the question: one of the groups contains only 1/4 of the total number of pieces. This means that the number of pieces in each position will be reduced by 75%. For example:

Group with 1/4 of the total number of pieces: Position 1: 131.25 pieces (131.25% of 62.5%)
Position 2: 131.25 pieces (131.25% of 62.5%)
...
Position 8: 131.25 pieces (131.25% of 62.5%)

So, if Johnny places all these Lego pieces randomly on the ground, he will have a total of:

* 62.5 + 195 + 131.25 = 488.75 pieces

Therefore, the answer to"
"Response: 
Debra sees 30 arrows in the first 6 minutes and then 24 arrows in the next 6 minutes. Since each arrow is twice as far apart as they are long (i.e., 2x), we can calculate the distance between them using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time + Position.
So, for the first 6 minutes, the distance traveled by an arrow is: Distance = 30 / 6 + 1 = 5 arrows. And for the second 6 minutes, it is: Distance = 24 / 6 + 1 = 4 arrows. Therefore, the total distance traveled by all the arrows during the last 12 minutes is: Total Distance = 5 + 4 = 9 arrows.
Now, since Debra saw 30 arrows in the first 6 minutes, she must have seen at least 9 arrows in the last 12 minutes (since there were only 9 arrows left to see). So, the number of arrows that Debra saw in the last 12 minutes is: Number of Arrows = 9."
Response:  The cost of admission for adults is $12 and for children is $10. If Brittany paid $8 too much, then she paid $4 too much. So, the correct answer is $4.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 3 more friends than Dorothy on Facebook. So, if Dorothy has x friends, then Charlie has x + 3 = 15 friends (since he has 3 more). Now we know that James has 4 times as many friends as Charlie on Facebook. Therefore, James has 4(x+3) = 60 friends on Facebook.
Response:  We know that Steve is farther away from the school than Tim and can go faster because he has more space to ride his bike. So let's assume that Steve rides at a speed of 440 feet per minute (which is 7 miles per hour). Since Tim is closer to the school than Steve, we will assume that Tim rides at a speed of 350 feet per minute (which is 6 miles per hour). Now, since they both start running at the same time, Tim covers 264 feet in one minute, which means he runs at an average speed of 264/1 = 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it takes for Tim to reach home, we need to divide the distance between him and the school by his running speed: distance / speed = 2 miles / 264 feet/minute = 8 minutes. Therefore, Tim will take 8 minutes to reach home after starting to run. As for Steve, since he is farther away from the school than Tim, it will take him longer to cover the same distance. Let's assume that Steve rides at a constant speed of 440 feet per minute throughout the race. In this case, he will cover 2 miles in 8 minutes, or 2 x 8 = 16 minutes. So, Steve will be behind Tim by 8 - 16 = 8 minutes.
"Response: 
1st day: 5 people came and shipped 2 bicycles (worth $25 each). So, total revenue for the first day is $50 ($25 x 2).
2nd day: 3 people came and shipped 3 bicycle tires (worth $25 each). So, total revenue for the second day is $75 ($25 x 3).
Total revenue for both days = $50 + $75 = $125.
So, the person who arrived at the end of the second day gained $125."
Response:  If Carl buys one package of Kurabiye and there are 4 Kurabiyes in each package, then he will buy 4 packages of Kurabiye. So, he will pay $4 x 4 = $16 for all the Kurabiyes. Since each Kurabiye costs $0.10, Carl will pay a total of $16 x $0.10 = $1.60 for all the Kurabiyes. Therefore, Carl will get $16 - $1.60 = $14.40 back from the cashier.
"Response:

Çarşamba (Tuesday) - 2 hours of classes
Cuma (Wednesday) - 3 hours of classes
Salı (Thursday) - 2 hours of classes
Perşembe (Friday) - 2 hours of classes
Total number of hours in one semester = 16 weeks x 3 hours/week + 4 weeks x 2 hours/week = 50 hours
So, Kimo attends 50 hours of classes per semester."
Response:  The total number of pastries is 300 + 120 + 60 = 480. If we divide this amount among three plates, each plate will have 160 pastries (480 / 3). Since each pastry costs 10 santim, the total cost of all the pastries on one plate will be 160 x 10 = 1600 santim. Similarly, if there are three plates, the total cost of all the pastries will be 1600 x 3 = 4800 santim. Therefore, bill will be 4800 santim long.
"Response:  The total number of animals in the farm is 800 (200 rabbits + 400 pigs + 100 sheep). To calculate how many animals can be fed for two months, we need to divide the total number of animals by the time period (two months). So, the number of animals that can be fed for two months is:

800 / 2 = 400

Therefore, the farmer needs to order 400 mus for each month."
"Response: 
Blake runs 15 meters in 2 seconds, so he can cover 30 meters (15 x 2) per second.
Kelly runs 40 yards (36 meters) in 5 seconds, so she covers 0.8 meters/second (40 / 5).
Since Blake starts running after Kelly has already run 40 yards, we need to subtract Kelly's distance from her initial position to find out how far Blake has left to cover. Therefore, Blake needs to cover 30 - 0.8 = 29.2 meters (30 - 0.8) per second.
Now, let's calculate how many times Blake can cover this distance in 34 seconds:
29.2 meters/second x 34 seconds = 1017.6 meters (29.2 x 34)
Therefore, Blake can cover 1017.6 meters more than Kelly during their race."
Response:  Raphael bought 4 pieces of stone (malzemeleri) for $1.5 each, so he spent $6 total ($1.5 x 4). Then, he bought 2 pieces of paper (defterleri) for $4 each, so he spent $8 total ($4 x 2). Finally, he bought a pencil case (boru kağıdı) for $20. Therefore, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  We know that there are 11 puppies in total and one of them has already jumped out of the basket. So, we have 10 puppies left in the basket. Now, let's assume that each puppy jumps out at random intervals (not necessarily simultaneously). Therefore, the probability of any particular puppy jumping out is equal to the number of remaining puppies divided by the total number of puppies (i.e., 10/11 = 0.90909...). Since we observe only one puppy jumping out, we can conclude that the probability of any particular puppy jumping out is approximately 0.90909... or 90.9%. Hence, Finn sees approximately 9 puppies jumping out of the basket.
"Response:  On Sunday (Pazartes), the depth of the water in the tank was 5 meters. On Monday (Salı), the water level increased by 7 liters more than before, so the new depth became:
Depth = 5 + (7 x 1000) / 100 = 5 + 700 / 100 = 5 + 7 = 12 meters
So, on Wednesday (Çarşamba), the depth of the water in the tank is 12 meters."
Response:  We know that Anakin has 10 stars, 6 boats, and 3 playful fish. Locsin has fewer than Anakin in all three categories. So, we can say that Locsin has x number of stars, y number of boats, and z number of playful fish. Since Locsin caught more fish than Anakin, we can write an equation as follows: x + y + 2z = 10 + 6 + 3. Now, solve for x, y, and z using substitution or elimination method.
"Response:  If a block of marble is sold for $20 and its original price was reduced by 20% every two months, then after 36 months it will be sold at what price?

Step 1: Calculate the reduction in price after 2 months (since the sale happens every 2 months).
Reduction = Original Price - Discounted Price = $20 - ($20 x 20%) = $20 - $4 = $16

Step 2: Repeat Step 1 for each subsequent month until the end of the 36-month period.
Reduction after 36 months = $16 x 35 = $560

So, after 36 months, the block of marble will be sold for $560."
Response:  We have 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and one baby. The baby is worth $3 less than an action figure. So, the value of the baby is $2. Now, we know that each red car costs $4. Therefore, the total cost of all the red cars is $4 x 5 = $20. Finally, since there are 3 action figures, their total cost is $3 x 3 = $9. Thus, the total cost of all the toys is $20 + $9 = $29.
Response:  If Jackie works for free for 3 hours and earns $35 during that time, then she has earned a total of $105 ($35 x 3 = $105). Now, if we subtract the amount that the accountant is paying her (which is $90), then Jackie will have earned an additional $15 ($105 - $90 = $15). So, the accountant will be overpaying Jackie by $15.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has spent 1090 Euros on a computer at the store. Then, she bought some accessories such as a keyboard, mouse, and speakers for an additional amount of money which is equal to 157 + 74 + 102 = 333 Euros. So, in total, Elvira has spent 1090 + 333 = 1423 Euros.
"Response:  If Sandra gives each of her daughters 9 eggs in total every time she visits them, and it takes 3 eggs to make an Spanish omelette, then...

Sandra visits her daughters once a week, so she gives them 9 eggs per visit x 52 weeks = 468 eggs per year.
Since there are 3 eggs needed for one Spanish omelette, Sandra can make 468 / 3 = 156 Spanish omelettes per year.
So, Sandra makes approximately 156 Spanish omelettes per year."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Seth is currently 30 years old and will be 32 years old in two years. So, at that time, he will have lived for 14 years (32 - 30 = 14). Therefore, right now, Seth is 14 + 2 = 16 years old.
Response:  If Ethel has $8 and Jimmy has more than $8 but less than $10, then we can say that Jimmy has $X dollars where X is between $8 and $10. So, the difference between their amounts of money is: $$ \text {Difference} = X - 8 $$ Now, we are told that the difference between their amounts of money is $2, so we can set up an equation: $$ \text{Difference} = X - 8 = 2 $$ Solving for X, we get: $$ X = 10 $$ Therefore, Jimmy has $10 more than Ethel.
Response:  Pancho walks for 20 miles in one week and then rests for 3 days. If he walks another 10 miles during his rest period, how far does he walk in total? So, in one week, Pancho walks a total of 30 miles (20 + 10).
"Response:  The cost of each item is as follows:
* Cap: $25
* Jacket: $3 x 3 = $9
* Pants: $10
Total cost of one uniform: $25 + $9 + $10 = $44
Therefore, the total cost of all three uniforms will be $44 x 3 = $126."
"Response:  We have three people in total: one with 8 legs and 80 insects, another with 6 legs and 90 bugs, and the third with 10 legs and no mutants. To find out how many legs Jake sees overall, we need to add up all of these leg counts. So, let's do that:

* Legs with 8 legs and 80 insects = 8 x 80 = 640 legs
* Legs with 6 legs and 90 bugs = 6 x 90 = 540 legs
* Legs with 10 legs and no mutants = 10 x 0 = 0 legs (since there are no mutants)

Adding up all of these leg counts gives us a total of 640 + 540 + 0 = 1180 legs. Therefore, Jake sees 1180 legs in total."
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, we have:
Sally Two is two years older than Sally One. So, Sally Two is at least 2 + 1 = 3 years old.
Red Big is three years older than Sally Two. So, Red Big is at least 3 + 2 = 5 years old.
If Sally Four is eight years old, then Red Big is at most 5 - 8 = -3 years old (since Red Big is three years older than Sally Two).
So, the total age of all four birds is at most 8 + (-3) = 5 years old. Therefore, the answer is 5 years old."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jessica has to pay for each type of loan. For example, she needs to pay $300 for the student loan and $200 for the credit card debt. Therefore, the total amount she needs to pay is:
$300 + $200 = $500
Now, if Jessica wants to pay more than 50% of this amount, let's say she wants to pay 70%, then she will have to pay:
$500 x 70% = $350
So, Jessica will have to pay at least $350 per year."
"Response: 
1. Billy has to peel and cut 60 potatoes for the BBQ party.
2. Each potato takes approximately 5 minutes to peel (since it takes 5 seconds to peel one potato).
3. Therefore, in total, Billy spends 60 x 5 = 300 minutes peeling the potatoes.
4. After peeling, he spends another 5 minutes cutting each potato into small pieces.
5. So, in total, Billy spends 300 + 5 = 305 minutes on preparing the potato salad."
Response:  If they sell each liter of lemonade for $3 and each bottle of sugar for $2, then their total revenue from selling lemonade is $3 x liters sold = $3L, and their total revenue from selling sugar is $2 x bottles sold = $2B. Since they have to pay $50 per barrel and get 20 barrels per gallon, their cost of goods sold (COGS) is $50/barrel x number of barrels = $50N, where N is the number of barrels they produce. Their profit is therefore COGS - revenue = ($50N - $3L - $2B). To find out how much they made in profit, we need to solve this equation: $50N - $3L - $2B =? Profit =? Now we can substitute the values given in the problem: $50(100) - $3(10) - $2(5) = $450 - $30 - $10 = $360 So they made $360 in profit if they sell 100 liters of lemonade and 50 barrels of sugar.
Response:  If there are 80 participants in total and Japan has 40 of them (as stated), then the remaining 40 must be from China. Now, if there are 60 male participants from China, that means there are 20 female participants from China as well. Therefore, the number of female participants from China is 20.
"Response: 
Zaid gives $1/4 of his monthly salary to his mother and spends $1/3 of it on fuel for his car. He also donates $50 to his favorite charity. So he has $6000 - ($1/4 x $1000) - ($1/3 x $800) = $5900 left after all these expenses."
Response:  According to the information given in the question, there are 4 more than Rani'nin monetary gain from selling her house. So, if she gained $100,000 from selling her house, then she would have earned $100,000 + ($4 x $40,000) = $100,000 + $160,000 = $260,000 as her total monetary gain. Therefore, the total number of shares that Bo'nun has after buying 4 houses is 260,000 / 4 = 65,000 shares.
Response:  In the first week, Lloyd spent 5 hours studying mathematics and earned $10. So he earned $2 per hour ($10 / 5 hours). In the second week, he studied for 8 hours and earned $8. So he earned $1 per hour ($8 / 8 hours). Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $3 ($2 + $1) during the two weeks.
Response:  The number of students in Sarai's class is 80 and there are three students competing for the top three positions. If the winner gets 3 points, then the second-place student gets 2 points, and the third-place student gets 1 point. Therefore, if we assume that the first student wins with 95 points, the second student gets 94 points (since they lost), and the third student gets 93 points (since they also lost), then we can calculate the total number of points won by all students as follows: Total points = 95 + 94 + 93 = 276 points.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Sandra has already delivered 40 red roses and 200 white lilies. If she continues her work without any interruptions, she will deliver 80 more red roses and 400 more white lilies until 5 pm. Therefore, Fred needs to pay for 120 red roses (80 + 40) and 600 white lilies (400 + 200) before 5 pm.
Response:  According to the problem, Mark was 10 years old when Jan was half his age (Jan is 30). So, Mark was 15 years old at that time. Now, we know that Jean is 2 years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean is 17 years old.
Response:  The team that is better at running can cover 400 meters in 55 seconds, and the other team takes 60 seconds to cover the same distance. If we assume that each runner runs for 1 second, then the faster team covers 400 meters in 55 seconds, which means they run at a speed of 7.2 meters per second (400 / 55). On the other hand, the slower team takes 60 seconds to cover the same distance, which means they run at a speed of 4.8 meters per second (400 / 60). Therefore, if the two teams race for 400 meters, the faster team will finish in 25.6 seconds (7.2 m/s x 3600 s), while the slower team will take 90 seconds (4.8 m/s x 3600 s) to complete the race. So, the faster team will win by 64.4 seconds (25.6 - 90).
Response:  If Jerry is throwing darts at a target with 3 sections and each section has an area of $20$, then the total area he can hit is $60$. Now, if we add two more sections to the target, each with an area of $40$, the total area Jerry can hit becomes $120$. So, the probability that Jerry hits any particular section is $\frac{1}{120}$.
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked 30 apples from their apple orchard, then...
Response:  We have 3 groups of hamsters in each cage (10 cages total). Each group has 5 pieces of food. So, there are 5 x 3 = 15 pieces of food for all the hamsters. Now, we add 20 pieces of food for the rat corridor. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food is 15 + 20 = 35 pieces of food. If we divide this amount among the small cages, each cage will get 35 / 16 = 2.1875 pieces of food. Since you cannot use any other place in the store to keep the food, all the remaining food must be placed in the large cages. So, each large cage will get 35 - 2 = 33 pieces of food. There are 4 large cages in total, so they will contain 33 x 4 = 132 pieces of food. Finally, if we subtract the food given to the small cages from the total amount, we get 35 - 132 = -97 pieces of food left over.
"Response:  If Mandy pays $100 in 3 months with an annual interest rate of 2%, then we can calculate it as follows:

Total amount = Principal + Interest
= $100 + (Interest x Time)
= $100 + ($2 x 3/12)
= $100 + $6
= $106
Therefore, Mandy will pay $106 to Benedict after 3 months."
Response:  If the farmer can sell each basket for $20 and it costs him $2 to transport each basket from the farm to the market, then he will make a profit of $18 per basket ($20 - $2). If he sells all 5 baskets, he will make a total profit of $90 ($18 x 5 = $90). So, there are 5 baskets in total.
"Response: 
1. Firstly, three friends bought tickets for $20.25 each. So in total, they paid $60.75 for the tickets.
2. Then, they spent $4.50 less per meal than the cost of their tickets. So, if they had dinner together, they would have spent $60.75 - $4.50 = $56.25.
3. They also traveled for 2 hours and 30 minutes at a cost of $33 per person. Therefore, the total amount they spent on traveling was $33 x 2 = $66.
4. In addition to that, they spent $4.50 less per meal than the cost of their tickets. So, if they had dinner together, they would have spent $66 - $4.50 = $61.50.
Therefore, if all three friends equally shared the expenses, each one would have paid $61.50 / 3 = $20.50."

Response:  If we need to feed one kilogram of chicken per week for 52 weeks (one year), then we will need a total of 52 kg x 1 kg/week = 52 tons of chicken in a year. Now, if there are 500 eggs per ton of chickens, then we can calculate how many eggs we need in a year as follows: 52 tons x 500 eggs/ton = 26,000 eggs/year. Therefore, we would need approximately 26,000 eggs per year to keep 500 chickens alive.
Response:  The number of trees in year 1 is 10. In each subsequent year, 2 trees are cut down. So, after 10 years, there will be 10 - (2 x 10) = 80 trees left. After another 10 years, 20 trees will be cut down, leaving 60 trees. Finally, after 20 years, 40 trees will be cut down, leaving 20 trees. Therefore, 20 trees have been cut down.
Response:  The number of plastic flamingos that were placed in Sue's garden at first was 18. Then, three of them were returned and painted white. So, the total number of plastic flamingos in Sue's garden after Komshas took them back was 18 - 3 = 15. Finally, on Saturday, Komshas added 18 more plastic flamingos to Sue's garden, so the total number of plastic flamingos in her garden now is 15 + 18 = 33. Therefore, there are 33 plastic flamingos in Sue's garden after everything happened.
Response:  We have $20 to spend and we want to buy at least 5 different colored pencils. Each pencil costs $2, so we can buy $\frac{20}{5} = 4$ pencils. Therefore, we will have $4 \times 2 = 8$ dollars left over after purchasing the pencils.
"Response:  If we have 8 pieces of paper (kalemler), and each piece costs $1.20, then the total cost of 8 pieces would be:
$1.20 x 8 = $9.60
Now, if we add the cost of 8 staples ($0.30 x 8 = $2.40), the total cost becomes:
$9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00
Therefore, the answer to the question is $12.00."
Response:  We have to distribute 200 kilograms of hazelnuts among 40 restaurants in a city. Each restaurant will get two kilograms of hazelnuts. So, we need to divide 200 kilograms by 40 restaurants, which gives us 5 kilograms per restaurant. Therefore, 5 kilograms of hazelnuts can be used for each restaurant.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, there are totally 23786 people living in Soda. Among them, 8417 are males and 9092 are females. So, the number of children (including both male and female) is equal to the total population minus the number of adults. Therefore, the number of children in Soda is:

23786 - (8417 + 9092) = 15377

So, there are 15377 children living in Soda."
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. Then, she added three times that number, so she had 60 Pokémon cards in the second month. In the third month, she added twice the number of cards she had in the second month, which is 120 Pokémon cards. Therefore, there are currently 140 Pokémon cards (60 + 120).
"Response: 
Mark is editing two copies for different publishers and earns $5 per sentence for each copy he edits. Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A does. So, if Mark edited 1000 sentences in one week, his total earnings would be:
$5 x 500 = $2500 (from Publisher A)
$5 x 200 = $1000 (from Publisher B)
Total earnings = $3500
Therefore, Mark earned $3500 that week."
"Response:  
1. In the morning, Baldur drinks 5 cups of water (5 x 500 ml = 2500 ml). 
2. After lunch, he drinks another 6 cups of water (6 x 500 ml = 3000 ml), bringing his total to 5500 ml. 
Therefore, in one day, Baldur consumes 5500 - 2500 = 3000 ml of water."
"Response:  If John wins an award worth $5000 every month and there is a 5% increase in salary, then his yearly income will be:
Yearly income = Monthly income x (1 + percentage increase) x Number of months
= $5000 x (1 + 0.05) x 12
= $63000
So, if John wins the award every month and earns a 5% higher salary each year, he would have earned $63,000 that year."
Response:  The total amount of apples produced in one year is given as 50 tons (5 döner x 10 tons per döner). Since each ton of apples produces 2 bottles of juice, the total number of bottles produced in one year is also 50 tons or 100 bottles (2 bottles/ton x 50 tons). Therefore, the number of bottles produced at the orchard every day is 100 bottles / 10 days = 10 bottles per day.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Carl ate one sandwich per day and each sandwich contained two slices of cheese. Therefore, he ate a total of 6 sandwiches (2 slices x 3 days) during the week. Since he also had breakfast three times a day, he ate a total of 18 eggs (3 breakfasts x 6 eggs/breakfast). Now, let's calculate how much cheese Carl used for his lunches. He made 4 lunches per week, so he used a total of 8 slices of cheese for lunches (4 lunches x 2 slices/lunch). Finally, we can calculate that Carl used a total of 10 slices of cheese (6 sandwiches + 8 lunch slices) during the week.
"Response: 
Janet had 22 yellow pencils and 10 red pencils initially. Then she got 6 blue pencils and 2 green pencils. The number of yellow pencils in each box is 9, and the number of red pencils in each box is 6. So, after getting these new pencils, Janet has:

Yellow pencils: 22 + 6 = 28
Red pencils: 10 + 2 = 12
Total pencils: 28 + 12 = 40
Therefore, Janet now has 40 pencils."
Response:  If Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in his first five tests, then he has obtained a total score of (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 458 points. To get an average score of 93 for the next test, Brinley needs to obtain at least 458 / 5 = 91 points in that test. Therefore, the answer is 91.

"Response:  
Sara wants to buy a new dress and two pairs of shoes that cost $30 and $20 respectively. She has been given 5 dollars each time she visits her grandparents, who give her money 4 times in total. Therefore, Sara needs to visit her grandparents 4/5 = 0.8 times to save enough money for the dress and shoes. Since it takes 10 days for Sara to save enough money, she will need to visit her grandparents 0.8 x 10 = 8 times in total. So, the answer is 8 times."
"Response:  If Jerry eats 42 eggs per day and there are more than twice as many white chickens as red chickens, then...

Let W be the number of white chickens and R be the number of red chickens. We know that W + R = 10 (since there are 10 chickens in total). Also, we know that W/R = 2 (since there are twice as many white chickens as red chickens).

Now, let's substitute these values into the equation for the number of red chickens:

R = 10 - W

Substituting W = 2W + 5 (since there are 5 red chickens), we get:

R = 10 - (2(2W) + 5)
= 10 - 4W + 5

Now, we can solve for W:

W = 6

So, there are 6 white chickens. And since there are twice as many white chickens as red chickens, there are 12 red chickens. Therefore, there are 4 red chickens."
Response:  The distance of the path is 1.5 x 6 = 9 meters. If he walks at a speed of 5 km/h, then in one hour, he will cover a distance of 5 km / 3.6 (conversion factor for kilometers to hours) = 1.42 meters per hour. So, if he starts walking at 8 am and finishes at 10 am, he will have walked for 2 hours, which means he has covered a total distance of 2 x 1.42 = 2.84 meters.
Response:  The number of customers in the store at first was 100. In the next day (second day), 50 more customers entered the store, so the total number of customers became 150. On the third day, an additional 25 customers came to the store, bringing the total number of customers to 175. Therefore, the answer is 175.
Response:  The total amount of water in both pools is equal to 8 gallons (since they are connected). So, initially, there were 4 gallons of water in each pool. Then, 4 minutes ago, there were 2 gallons more water in the big pool than in the small one. Now, there are 3 times as much water in the big pool as in the small one. Therefore, there are 12 gallons (3 x 4) of water in the big pool now, and 4 - 12 = 0 gallons of water in the small pool.
Response:  If she spends $320 for shoes and $32 for a dress, in total she will spend $352. Since she earns $8 per hour, it means that she needs to work for 44 hours (352/8) to save enough money to buy those items. So, the answer is 44 hours.

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months would be $1800."
Response:  We know that Vasoda has 4 flowers and each flower has 7 more daisies than him. So in total, Vasoda has 4 x 7 = 28 daisies. Therefore, Vasoda has 4 + 28 = 32 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that Adrian is three years older than Harriet. So, if Harriet is currently 21 years old, then Adrian is 3 + 21 = 24 years old. Now we need to calculate the age difference between them in three years. Since Harriet is currently 21 years old, the age difference between them after three years will be 24 - 21 = 3 years.
Response:  We know that total points are 251 and Naomi scored 68 points. So, we can say that Brianna scored more than Naomi by 17 points (251 - 68 = 183). Now, we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. According to the problem statement, Jojo scored fewer points than Brianna by 10 points (183 - 173 = 10). Therefore, Jojo scored 10 points.
"Response: 
Carmen takes 10 minutes to solve one Sudoku puzzle and 5 minutes to solve another Sudoku puzzle. If she solves 8 Sudoku puzzles in a week, it means she spends 40 minutes (8 x 5) solving Sudokus.
Now, let's calculate how much time she spends on other activities. She spends 3 minutes solving each of the 3 words, so that's 9 minutes (3 x 3).
Adding up all these times gives us a total of 59 minutes (40 + 9) per week."
Response:  The total amount of water in the tank is 120 liters. Celene used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank (120 - 90 = 30).

"Response:  The company invests $15,000 in advertising for one year and then divides it into three parts of $5,000 each to be spent over the next three years. So, the total amount invested in advertising over two years is:
$15,000 / 3 = $5,000 per year x 2 years = $10,000
Therefore, the total amount invested in advertising over two years is $10,000."
Response:  Carlos rented a canoe for $30 and Benji rented a musical instrument for $18. If Carlos used it for 3 hours and Benji used it for 5 hours, how much will they have to pay in total? So, we need to calculate the cost per hour for each item and then add them up. The cost per hour for the canoe is $30 / 3 = $10 per hour. The cost per hour for the musical instrument is $18 / 5 = $3.6 per hour. Therefore, the total cost for both items is $10 + $3.6 = $13.6 per hour.
Response:  The journey from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days by bus and 4 hours by car. So if you take the bus for the first part of the trip (6 days) and then switch to a car for the remaining part (4 hours), it will take a total of 10 days. Therefore, the answer is 10 days.
Response:  If we remove 8 water-type cards from the deck and get 14 fire-type cards in return, then the probability of randomly selected card being water type is now 56/94 = 0.60 (nearly 60%).
Response:  The total cost of the meal is $6.50 + $2 (extra cheese) + $1 (avocado) + $1 (salsa) = $9.80. Since there is an extra charge for the burrito ($3), and the customer also ordered a drink ($1), the final bill comes to $10.80. So, the customer owes $10.80.
"Response:  If Kalinda can work on a 360-degree puzzle for 4 pieces at a time, and her mother can place more than 2 pieces next to each other, then we have some calculations to do:

1. Kalinda works on a 360-degree puzzle for 4 pieces at a time = 360 / 4 = 90 minutes (approximately)
2. Her mother can place more than 2 pieces next to each other = let's say she can place 5 pieces next to each other in one go

So, if Kalinda takes 90 minutes to complete 4 pieces of the puzzle, it means that her mother can complete 5 pieces in approximately half an hour or 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to complete the entire puzzle is:

Total Time = 90 minutes + 30 minutes = 120 minutes (approximately)"
"Response: 
Ashlyn visited the farm after two months and found that out of 120 baby carrots, only 30% were healthy. So she took them back to her farm. Two weeks later, when she returned, she found that only three out of the remaining 90 carrots were healthy. Therefore, the percentage of healthy carrots among the ones left behind was ___________%.
Answer: 30% + (3/90) x 100 = 45%"
Response:  The company buys 12 cars for $240,000 ($20,000 each). They pay 10% taxes on the total cost of the cars, which is $24,000 ($240,000 x 10%). Additionally, they pay $10,000 per car as registration fee, making the total cost per car $30,000 ($20,000 + $10,000). So, in total, the company paid $360,000 ($30,000 x 12) for all 12 cars.
Response:  On Monday (pazartesi), Kylie topped up 5 more liters than Robert did. So, Robert topped up 20 liters. On Tuesday (salı), Kylie topped up 2 + 5 = 7 more liters than she did on Monday. Therefore, Kylie topped up 7 + 20 = 27 liters in total on those two days.
Response:  If there are 120 bees in total and Dax collected 60 of them from the garden, then the number of bees left in the garden is 120 - 60 = 60. So, the total number of bees in the garden is 60 x 50 = 3000.
Response:  There are 36 chickens in total. Three of them go to the sun and three more go to the oven for dinner. So, there are 33 chickens left. Therefore, 33 chickens have been exposed to the sun.
Response:  If Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and his girlfriend eats 2 times more than him (which is 12 tomatoes), then in one week he will eat 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes. If there are 3 tomato plants producing fruit every other day, then in one week there will be 3 x 7 = 21 tomato plants producing fruit. So, the number of tomatoes Steve needs to buy from the market is equal to the number of tomato plants producing fruit minus the number of tomatoes he can produce himself, which is 21 - 42 = -21 tomatoes. Therefore, Steve needs to buy -21 tomatoes from the market in one week.
Response:  There are 20 friends in total and each friend can have up to 4 slices of pizza. Since there are only 8 pieces of pizza available, we need to divide them among the 20 friends. To do this, we will divide 8 by 20, which gives us 0.4 or 4/10 of an slice per person. So, John needs to order at least 4 x 4 = 16 slices of pizza.
"Response:  If he can make 5 kalems with each of the remaining 20 pieces of paper and he has already used 25 pieces of paper for making kalems, then we have:

"Response:  If 1000 students enter the school through three entrances (A, B, and C), after 30% of them exit from entrance A, the remaining 70% will be divided equally among entrances B and C. So, the number of students who exit from each entrance is as follows:

* Entrance A: 300 students (30% of 1000)
* Entrance B: 420 students (70% of 1000 / 2 = 420)
* Entrance C: 280 students (70% of 1000 / 3 = 280)

Therefore, the total number of students who exit from all entrances is:

300 + 420 + 280 = 900 students."

"Response:  
Dolly has two books to read and Pandora also has one book to read. If they both start reading each other's books, then after finishing their own books, they will have read a total of 3 books (2 + 1 = 3). So, in this case, they will be able to read 3 books altogether."
"Response: 
Mike has been sending emails to his friend with 4 people in total.
He sends 2 emails per day, and each email takes him 10 minutes to write.
So, he spends 2 hours (10 minutes x 2) writing emails every day.
In one week, there are 7 days, so Mike spends 14 hours (2 hours x 7 days) writing emails in a week.
In one month, there are 4 weeks, so Mike spends 56 hours (14 hours x 4 weeks) writing emails in a month.
Therefore, Mike spends approximately 832 minutes (56 hours / 7 days) writing emails in a year."
"Response: 
Jason has 1000 minutes of phone calls per day.
He spends 15 minutes talking to each customer every day.
There are 30 days in this month.
So, he talks to customers for a total of 450 minutes (15 x 30) during this month.
Now, we need to find out how many minutes Jason spent on phone calls that were not with customers.
Let's assume it takes him 2 minutes to prepare for each call and 3 minutes to wrap up after each call.
So, his total time spent on phone calls = Total time spent on customer calls + Time spent preparing for calls + Time spent wrapping up calls.
Total time spent on customer calls = 450 minutes (see above).
Time spent preparing for calls = 2 x 30 = 60 minutes (per day).
Time spent wrapping up calls = 3 x 30 = 90 minutes (per day).
So, Jason's total time spent on phone calls = 450 + 60 + 90 = 600 minutes.
Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason spent a total of 600 / 30 = 20 minutes more than usual on phone calls that weren't with customers."
"Response: 
Griffin had 24 potatoes and gave 1 to Ginger Griffin. Then, Kyle took 5 from Billy, who had 3 more than Kyle. So, Billy had 8 potatoes left. Finally, Ginger gave 2 potatoes to Griffin, leaving him with 27 potatoes in total. Therefore, Ginger gave 25 - 2 = 23 potatoes to Griffin."
Response:  If there are 4 fish in one aquarium and 32 fish in another aquarium, then the difference between the number of fish in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. Since there are twice as many fish in the second aquarium as in the first aquarium, if there are x fish in the first aquarium, then there will be 2x fish in the second aquarium. So, if there are y fish in both aquariums together, we can write an equation: 2x + y = 56 (since the total number of fish in both aquariums is 56). Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, there are 14 fish in the first aquarium and 28 fish in the second aquarium.
"Response:  The jeans maker charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours a day, making a total of $1500 per day. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to make, the total amount earned by the jeans maker is:

$1500 x 5 = $7500

Now, since the jeans maker gives a discount of 10% after the movie is finished, they will earn:

$7500 x (1 - 0.10) = $6750

So, the jeans maker has earned a total of $6750 from making the jeans for the movie."
Response:  The total cost of party supplies is $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $86. Since there are two adults and three children, each child spent half of the amount their parent spent. So, the total amount spent by each child is $86 / 2 = $43.
"Response:  The chef bought 4 baskets of herbs that weighed 20 kg in total (4 x 5 kg). Since each basket contains 50 kg of herbs, and one kilogram of herbs costs $1.5, the total cost of all four baskets is:
$1.5 x 50 kg = $75 per basket
So, the chef paid $75 for each of the 4 baskets, which means they spent a total of:
$75 x 4 = $300
Therefore, the chef spent $300 to buy the 4 baskets of herbs."
Response:  On Pazartesiday, Sue ate 4 times as much Kurabiye as her sister. So she ate 4 x 5 = 20 Kurabiyes. On Sunday, she ate twice as much Kurabiye as her sister. So she ate 2 x 13 = 26 Kurabiyes. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 Kurabiyes. Since one Kurabiye contains 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories in total.
